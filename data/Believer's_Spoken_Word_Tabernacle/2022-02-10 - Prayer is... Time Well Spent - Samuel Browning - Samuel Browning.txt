with thanksgiving in my heart i'd like to just sing this before we approach the word [Music] i will enter his cage with [Music] foreign one more time [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] and assemble ourselves together and then it's a privilege and then in this hour it's just something there's something special about it you know when believers when we are able to get together it's just something special you know the song that we know it says we're together again just praising the lord something good is bound to happen something good is in store amen that's that's expectation we we have that confidence no matter how it is sometimes that we you know we go through things in life and there's things that we're facing things sometimes even in in our spirit we feel down but yet we have that expectation i can just get to the house of god i've got a hope he said brother samuel i thought it was faith but a hope remember faith gives us hope and a hope is an expectation we have an expectation that god is going to do something for us god's going to speak to our hearts he's going to minister to our lives now it may not come exactly the way that we're thinking about it but he's going to speak to our lives amen and that's what we have with just such a real joy in our hearts just so thankful amen for what god is doing to be a part of that amen in this hour we see everything that's going on within the world we see to see world powers and a lot of things i don't know if this is me or or what that is but it's being you know a mass and things like that in the earth and yet it's a time that when we're looking at that when the scripture said when you begin to see these things lift up your head for your redemption draw at night amen and we begin to see all of that things that are taking place and i'm grateful to god that there's a real peace that god gives to our lives i don't know but i i think i think this it might be me and if it is i apologize for that we'll we'll change up here if we have to but let's just look to the lord in a word of prayer amen here this evening you have a need on your heart why don't you just make it known to the lord let's just invite him to pass by our way heavenly father lord we're standing here tonight lord we're not standing here to be seen we're standing here tonight lauren because we love you lord jesus lord there's needs in our lives we've not come here lord just that needs would be met because there's many needs that we have that are before us in our minds upon our hearts but father we believe that god that before there could ever be that need you've already lord provided the answer and lord we know that the answer is not something outside of you that that will never satisfy but father our answer and all that we have need of lord is in you so lord for every need for every situation we invite you o god that you would direct the battle lord we're minded in the word of god where it speaks of the hour that we live in that our strength would be as we turn the battle to the gate lord and father we're we're taking lord every one of these requests every need lord all that's upon the hearts of your children with uplifted hands and lord we place them before the throne of god we lord look beyond these walls and this physical address and we look oh god into that lord realm where we see oh god the father the lamb of god seated their lord in power lord jesus on our behalf and to know that god that that same spirit lord that has raised us up that lord that authority lord we are partakers of that lord so father as we come tonight lord and take collectively every one of these requests lord behind the needs lord father whether it's for physical need lord healing her lord of things financially oh god spiritual needs tonight lord we just lord invite you o god that you will come lord and minister to every need in a very special way oh god help us lord as speaker and here to be able to step aside and to lay aside oh god all the cares of of the day and of this life and to enter in lord in these moments and may our lives just be so affected oh god in your presence lord so challenge the lord that father when we would leave out of here lord from this gathering lord that we would be more determined we'd be a better people lord god because you come lord god not just because we've come to church but because you come lord god so we invite you lord that you come lord you're the one who makes the meeting lord you're the one that we look to see lord and to hear from lord for it's just one touch from you lord just a few words from you lord means more father than anything of this world to us lord so we just invite you lord that you'll come and minister to every need father fill every heart lord refill lives lord we pray we just love you thank you father jesus precious name amen amen let's turn in the bible to luke chapter 11. i'm just going to read a few verses actually we'll read through verse 13 if you will but in luke chapter 11 verse 1 it says and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just continue reading from there for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and i have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend this is this is me i think just if you just switch it to this if you would please okay i'll turn this off i say unto you though we will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his opportunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth i want you to think of this this scripture here in the opening part here in verse 1 the disciples seeing the life of the lord jesus now remember they have had a witness as far as knowing and believing of all that they can see at that moment that this is the messiah we know there are events that took place in the crucifixion and there of the resurrection that was hidden and to be revealed in another moment but there was there was that insight that window into his life that if you were to ask them in the in the um layout of the life of the lord jesus they would tell you he spent much time in prayer over and over in the book of luke it's recorded ten times he was in prayer and we recognize that within this in verse 1 when they saw this they seen the effectual working but they're asking him teach us to pray as john taught his disciples also you see the teaching of it was more than just about praying of how to how to put your body because they these these were israelites they knew about you know the different things of prayer and so forth they knew about that they knew the different prayers they weren't ignorant of that remember simon was even spoke to by his father in regards looking for the messiah here's what moses has said unto the spirit of god that the lord that god shall raise a prophet like and unto me he was taught those things so they weren't ignorant of prayer but you see what's being said in verse one is is inspire to us direct us into what we need to be asking for right now you see because our lives lives itself it goes by so quickly and i'm going to deal with some of this here tonight and what i want to speak on is time well spent the life goes by so quickly and yet here it is they're asking him which is a great question and brother branham takes that and i read that to you out of feast of the trumpets where he's praying and asking god lord teach us the things for us to ask that would be beneficiary for your kingdom's sake and it's so it's not about us it's about him and we recognize that when we have that set even in that priority it will affect and give us direction in the lives that we live down here john taught his disciples on what to pray for see the word being ministered actually brought forth what they should be praying for at that moment that's the same way it was with daniel when daniel understood by the books the inspiration came and daniel began to pray he began to confess his sin confess the sin of the people and begin to make supplication unto god so it shows that prayer itself is is that which is very directed with god and god is the one who's directing it in our lives if we can just be sensitive like as we looked at here a month ago a month and a half or what have you when we looked at jesus took took him to the field and he says the harvest is right and he says pray ye the lord of harvest he'll send laborers into the vineyard and remember jesus himself he's standing as the lord of the harvest he knew what they needed but you see they had to ask for it god just doesn't give it without being asked for it and i want you to take notice of this scripture here as we're reading uh this is no doubt a very familiar scripture to us but i want you to consider here is one going one friend going to another friend and it's going at midnight it's not somewhat of a convenient hour i don't know about you but you know knocking at that time of the night maybe in my house one thing you may get riled up is dogs i mean i'm up once in a while i mean a lot of times you know the way the schedule i probably would be up at midnight but to understand what it is it's a time that's not convenient are you hearing me now it's about something that's not convenient but it's about there's a need and this person recognizes that regardless of the hour this is a need and the other friend on the inside who's able to give what's being asked for is not rising up out of his bed to give the friend the bread that he needs but he's rising up because of his friend's importunity or his shamelessness in asking i tell you if there's anything that we need to be and the scriptures would show us as believers is to be shameless in our asking when god speaks to our heart to ask god and you know like brother brad who told us he said ask god for big things he wants you to ask for big things and he says a matter of fact the big things are just as easy as the little things now think of this as the scripture is set here it says now i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you brother branham dramatized this scripture for us and he speaks to us in this manner that he says it's one that's standing right there and saying papa it's me again i'm not leaving until this prayer is answered you got me on your hands right now there's a need that i've got right here i i've got a need you know what that is that's desperation and knowing that it's only god that can meet that need he will not rise up because of being a friend he will rise up because of our shamelessness in saying thou alone are able to do this work lord and i need your touch lord i need a move of god right now in my life he will rise he will rise and answer for everyone that asketh receiveth i think we just ought to say amen to that and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open you know what that scripture verse 10 has on it time time because it takes time to seek for things i mean i know we're living in an hour right now you can't find it just order it on amazon it'll be here in the next hour but look what that also does in our lives it creates even though we're not we're not in a place where i don't want to be impatient but things around us work to create an impatience and prayer is not instant mashed potatoes sometimes prayer you've gotta it's plant the potatoes water the potatoes and then harvest the potatoes and then take them in and make them without microwave that's prayer this is why prayer coupled with patience and patience is that of faith that's why jesus said with patience possess ye your souls i mean we want patience right now time time and money is time time time time you know we hear that we hear that expressed time time time if a son i want you to look at this if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he will he for a fish give him a serpent or or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them to ask him amen it's a desire it's the asking that that in itself for that of the holy ghost for healing for all those things that with every need that we have because inside of christ every redemptive blessing is to the believer every redemptive blessing and things that even in this hour we understand we're not praying for a revival to strike the nation we've been taught by the spirit of god the message has come to us and we are praying should be praying for rapture god that i'll be counted worthy to escape lord that my life is found lined up lord oh lord i want my life to be right in step with you lord god amen oh my it's examination time it's examining hour it's it's calling on god for that word to be made manifest in our life and think about this you know when we look at here with things and i want you to think of just some terms here this evening i want you to think of some terms here of interest investment need and priority brother braham says it like this it's just so this quote is always just your soul but so dear to my heart and out of the pergaming age brother brahman says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst so let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in 1st john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we've desired of him now we ask what is the will of god there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 who is he that sayeth and it cometh to past when the lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name there it is again jesus the name is the word which is his will you can't separate god and the word they are one i know you know getting this hour and it seems to be i don't know i'm not sure why confusion about what the absolute is but it's very clear what the absolute is it's the revelation of jesus christ paul said the we or an angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel brother branham put it like this he said paul was saying if i come around and say something different than he has already said through my ministry then you count me a curse showing he said paul was pointing out to us that it is the revelation that we have confidence in and if we have confidence in the revelation and it is the revelation it will do what it highlights and anchors within the word of god noah didn't have a bible job didn't have a bible come on now i know we want to say the stars and so forth but you realize brother rem said what they had was the revelation and that's the most important thing because we realize a person could have the written word and not have the revelation but it's a revelation that brings us in contact with god and it's a revelation that has prevailing power within it it brings the absolute in our lives which is unlimited in its power what that says is that it's unlimited of what god will do paul said now unto him who's able to do abundantly exceeding above all that we could ask or think there's nothing that even now or if time tarries that can rise that's greater than god coming on the scene and meeting that need come on friends there's nothing can rise nothing is greater than god where we can't take and stand on the promise of god's word every opposition that comes every trial every test every adversity every sickness is a challenge are we going to stand on god's word amen we have been made i'll say it this way we have been made priests and kings unto our god we didn't take this to ourselves we didn't make ourselves that just as paul said aaron no man taketh this calling to himself we didn't do this but god has made known through revealing himself in our life it's god who's been his rich in mercy and as a priest of god i want you to think about this for a moment as a priest of god we are consecrated to please him serve him love him and live for him we're not our own we've been bought with the price there in israel the priest did not decide of when to come and go and say well you know what today's a bad day i'm not going to be able to be there in the tabernacle it wasn't about them i mean they might have been able to say in their tent i'll just catch it in my tent then one about them are you hearing me now i'm preaching it wasn't about them it was about the body and god said i have redeemed them i purchased them unto myself that tribe that out of all the other tribes this was a tribe that would be in god's dwelling place to serve him and to minister on behalf of the people of god you and i as the bride of jesus christ you know we get to looking at it and we sometimes we're looking at all the bride of jesus christ it's a great responsibility we are brought in as priests of god to please him to love him to serve him that's what's exhibited or to be exhibited out of our life where we've laid down our lives lay down the things of the world it's not about us you hearing me now it's not about us it's about him it's about his body amen that's why when a person gets you know they get you know somewhat upset at this one or this one and pull away it's about you you're making it about you it's not about you it's not about me it's about the body it's about jesus christ i can set it home and i can stream it the prince of god comes in there i know i've had to do that at a time but it's not about you it's about the body it's not about you or me it's about the body of jesus christ for sake not to assemble ourselves together as the manner of some art come on friends oh my we're priests and kings unto god we don't live our life for ourselves we've been purchased and redeemed for service in the things of god this is why paul could write in romans 12 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service think about what responsibility that brings to you and i the pastor won't do it for us the prophet won't do it for us the lord jesus won't do it for us all of this has been made a way that we can come and live in this place of presenting and it's not just one-time presentation we are made priests of god and the sacrifice is the offering up of our lives that we would present our own bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service now notice this admonition in verse 2 and be not conformed to this world pressured but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i want to just go into this scripture here i'm just going to skip here just some other scriptures i want to go right to matthew 6 6. but thou when thou prayest yes amen enter into the closet and when thou has shut the door thy door notice thy door how many knows sometimes we've got to shut our door he said brother sam i always shut my bedroom door now i'm talking about the door many times of our own mind the door of our own the doings and everything we've got on our mind to say oh god just like the curtain dropped upon my soul and the world was sealed out and i was sealed in i need that curtain to drop right now lord and we enter in we begin to enter in and worshiping and because we realize we must enter in to his presence and it's entered to enter speaks there's a designated place now i realize that every one of us we no doubt have maybe you have a place in your home that's a designated place of where you go when you pray sometimes it might be different rooms multiple rooms you know when you have kids it narrows down but at any rate this is more than just a bedroom a closet there's a designated place that god has provided for you and i my lord and that's in jesus christ that we can enter into that presence that has so changed and transformed our lives i hope you're hearing me now tonight then it's not confined to oh i can only feel his presence when i get in my prayer closer or my bedroom but in reality we and i are able to walk with god in communion i'm telling you friends i've had wonderful experiences sometimes right in the middle of the store because already our lives was already in tune with god and his presence something just drops right there so communion prayer is not a on off on off on it's not a switch pray without ceasing amen that means that that means is is that there isn't breaks in our communication with god there might be times where we have more time than other times but you got to watch that because that it don't become a pattern come on we're still walking in this flesh we must mortify the deeds of this body and as priest of god we we enter in to his presence and i want you to see in the scripture says enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly his secret it has been made known to you and i right we're not it's not in the darkness it's not obscure the secret is where that he has revealed himself in his word he has made himself known to you and i remember jesus could he would walk right by many and they didn't know who he was it was a secret god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself it was a secret yet it was right out in the open yes amen is that right so the secret it speaks of that revealing where god has opened to you and i the father who seeth in secret you've got one who stands here as our high priest of his own word that the things that you and i are privileged to be able to approach the living god he doesn't send there with ooh ah oh my he's there to move on our behalf whatever you have need of and god deals and he strikes with our heart whether it's in a service or whether it's on a monday morning or a tuesday morning you've got an instant access with the lord jesus let me tell you something his phone is never on vibrate hallelujah his phone is never on do not disturb him but his ears are open his eyes are upon us he knows what you and i have need of oh my this is why when entering into prayer i wonder i want you to think of this he will reward the openly there's a return in your investment there's a return in your investment this is why paul would admonish the believers and colossians to seek those things which are above set your affections on things that are above brother branham would say it like this he would say you know and i read this quote to you i want to pull out a few points from here tonight out of blind bartimaeus and he speaks of how there's many there's something about getting alone to yourself now brother brown may talk about getting a loan to ourself and getting on our phone and he's talking about getting a loan to ourselves many people he said never pray until they come to church and many people think the only place to pray is at church but the bible said pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and when we get by ourselves you know we'll usually pray different than what we would if we prayed in church it's a secret prayer that jesus spoke of and he saying and brother brown quotes that scripture brother bram said when we're praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it it seems like we get in a better connection with god to get along so there's many places look the walk with a believer in communion with god is not an on and off as we said it's not just saying well i can't contact him outside of you know the walls of my bedroom no you any place you can contact god amen but let's just be honest there are some times where i've been in places that it's a little harder to pull into a gear oh yeah thank god for some of these noise blocking headphones never again i was getting ready for a service to minister you know here the first part of last year and i'm right i'm getting ready to go in and minister a sunday evening service and right outside of the hotel room right there i thought there was a brawl taking place it wasn't a shady hotel either but i mean it was like i mean all the swearing and ungodly words and everything i didn't know i thought it was going to go out the window but you know what all that was for is to try to upset my spirit amen you know why the enemy bombards you with different things is to try to upset your spirit and what's the same well here you get yourself settled down but you realize that anything in the world the world doesn't settle us down you say well brother branham went hunting right here in this quote brother graham says many of many of the men i was with thought i was climbing the mountain early in the morning to go hunting he said i wasn't going up there alone to go hunting i was going up there to contact god sometimes you just have to have good excuses glory be to god i got another call coming in you do yeah jesus is on the line [Applause] come on friends you know these things that we we find we get a better connection to get along and there's many times in my life it's perhaps in your life he says that you just have to get alone once in a while with jesus oh he said that being alone it's there that when the greatest revelation and inspiration comes is when we're alone with god we'd take more time on that that's a big statement if we take more time on that i'm sure that we would live a better life a more victorious life in christ now matthew 14 22 and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone i want you to think of this he sent the multitudes away he sent him away he sent his disciples away now let's just look at this the disciples were closer than the multitude right let's just bring it down to our own life fellowship is fine fellowship is good fellowship is necessary but fellowship should never with one another should never be above prayer if there's one that we men we want to make sure that we have an insane fellowship with that's the lord jesus and when we're in fellowship with him guess what we'll be refreshing to others are you with me separated i want you to think look at this he was separated in order to close off and to get into prayer you remember in the scripture where it speaks of how that anna she was a widow she was in the temple praying and fasting she was a widow she didn't have any other duties or responsibilities she had been mad you know her husband had passed on mary mary is grown now mary is 18 years old right she or she is i would say that if we could look at this with anna remember she was one that was part of the overcomers in that day and she was able to be there and to give herself into prayer think about zacharias zacharias had a responsibility as part of the priesthood to be in the temple and offering insects at certain times there was a responsibility but now as it comes to you and i let me read you this scripture first corinthians 7 5 this is speaking of husband and wife defraud you not one another except it be with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempts you not for your incontinency so now now once you think of this not only now you're a son of god a daughter of god a husband and wife and here you know they had their walks in the lord and now here they stand as husband and wife before if they wanted to go in praying and fasting they didn't have to tell nobody are you with me but now paul says the responsibility it falls to the husband or to the wife to have that mutual agreement to say hey there's some things i just want to give myself to prayer and fasting for right now just so what so that it keeps satan out of the way and out of the mind are you with me so there's a responsibility because a husband and a wife paul deals with that in that chapter as they are to one another but yet to recognize that there are times that we step aside in prayer and fasting and that should be openly declared and known this is where brother brown would say regarding the lord jesus he spent much time brother ryan would say this he would say this over and over and there's just certain things i just kept looking over these here just kept looking over and just just waiting and how the holy spirit would just quicken the different parts to it brother branham made this statement like this and i don't think i put this one on the screen but he says our loving savior had spent much time he's talking about before he went to jairus's house he had spent much time in prayer listen to this statement he was busy all the time that's a powerful statement busy all the time moving from place to place he didn't have any airplanes or he didn't have rail cars he they walked right they didn't have the state-of-the-art shoes oh this fits the arch just right in this right so in other words here his life it was busy but what was he busy about the father's business now listen to me now all of that the maniac of gather gadara all those things that you could line all the way out but remember brother branham would point us to this place he says he spent much time in prayer for these things that was before him not just for them but he spent much time in prayer and this was a result it's not us praying we understand it's not praying to gain merits but he was in prayer because the burden of the hour was upon him if his disciples were asking him teach us how to pray he knew how to pray he knew what to be asking for in that hour he knew what the promise was for that hour are you with me it was quickened to him of isaiah 53 he bore up our infirmities carried away our sicknesses that was quickened to him and he knew that he needed the strength of his father in him to perform that word is that right the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise whole glory be to god he was busy all the time but remember moses let's go to moses moses was busy too but moses got too busy that he forgot circumcision so sometimes busyness is always not about bad things it can be good things moses could have argued with god lord you're the one who called me to stand as a deliverer to these people that god also could speak to moses and say but that does not that does not alleviate you from walking in a balance of your time but god i'm to be a deliverer but moses you're also a father you're also a husband hello those things were not taken from you but now you must bring them in and ask god lord how do i balance all of this friends that's just not for ministry that's for all of our lives because there's things sometimes it comes our way and we have to ask god how do i balance all of this what if you will if i can say it this way what is the fact that can be trimmed out of my life are you with me and being honest with god what are some things i could cut out that's not necessary he spent much time in prayer before the cross the bible says he prayed earnestly before going to the cross that's right that was his destiny but he prayed earnestly strengthened for that moment in luke 6 12. i've referred to this one many times and it came to pass in those days this is what brother brown was referring to he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god brother abraham says if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer so if you only knew what time in prayer meant i didn't i didn't count that up but how much of the word is used here time time in prayer i want you to think of this here but iran would go on to that you know jesus spent a lot of time in prayer we see that it speaks about even how the disciples went away that night they went out on the boat and then we see how satan come right after him the devil brother rams as soon as the devil sees you out of fellowship with christ right then he'll set out for you as hard as he can just as soon as he sees you away from prayer away from consecration brethren tells us in this in this message further on down that jesus had went up alone to pray because there was a battle to be fought i think we can put ourselves here there's sometimes where we don't know battles that are coming on then there's other times where we know there's some showdowns coming is that right and the greatest thing that we can do is follow the example he knew there was a battle coming up across the sea he knew all of that and brother brad said he felt the pressure of that battle coming so he went up in the mountain to pray alone this is our example because we feel the battle we feel the pressures we feel pressure coming we feel things as it comes our way and there's things sometimes that we have to face we have to say or we have to do and we know there's a battle coming but i'd rather be prepared for that battle i would rather be so under the control of the holy spirit i'm talking about my emotions i'm talking about everything all of it to be so surrendered to him i want you to think of this here in the scripture paul would write of this in uh in ephesians 5 and i just want to read two verses of scripture here there's more than we could read but notice paul says in verse 15 see that you walk circumspectly that means with wisdom not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil now notice this word redeeming the time we know we know what redemption is redemption is to bring back to someone what rightfully belongs to them it's redeemed by a payment a price to recover from the power of another to ransom to buy off now look at the second part of this this of this meaning of redeeming it's to buy up to buy up for oneself for one's use i know some things may have lost their meaning but in order to buy something it requires money there's a purchase that has to be made you don't just walk into mcdonald's and say i want a hamburger they'll say sure they'll punch it in and then you know whatever it is inflation it's 10.99 i just want a cheeseburger no it's 109. you have to purchase it this is what paul is writing of redeeming the time buy it up for oneself but it's my time that's right that's why it must be redeemed just like in our lives we have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb we didn't become sons and daughters of god we didn't become sheep of god we always were he paid the price that was required to bring us back under his authority and possession so now paul puts this redemption of time into our hands and lets us know you've got the power amen you've got the authority to buy up for oneself to make wise and sacred use of every opportunity for doing good so that zeal and well-doing are as it were the purchase money by which we take we make the time our own amplified bible says it like this i'm going very slow purposely here making the very most of the time buying up each opportunity because the days are evil let's say it like this when looks redeeming the time it's as though that every allotment of time has a sold sign on it our time in our life i don't get time i don't have time i don't got time sorry i don't got time don't get tired i don't got time right it's as though every lot is sold so it's not based on us buying up what's available we've got to redeem some things that's been taken amen there's a sold sign there but that lot belongs to me but we have to buy it back how do we buy it back through sacrifice some things have to be laid down because to redeem is to secure back from the power of another that's why david would say teach us to number our days listen brother brahman says it like this in his wonders to perform he's talking about singing and getting into the word of god he says you know you go to singing hymns and you start reading the bible and that stranger the same one from luke 24 will appear to you as you meditate on his word it was while those who went to emmaus along the road begin to talk about him that he stepped out from the bushes and walked with them through the day the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings we have too much time to watch television a lot of other things we could put in there too much time to read the newspapers or listen to something that we ought not to be listening to and we are not redeeming the time but we're giving it you catch what he says here we're giving it satan isn't taking it we're giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the lord jesus the things of the world is a very broad term you're not talking about going on drinking a fifth of whiskey it's simply letting down on the things of god and the bible said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of god christians live on the word i've given you many quotes at different times from charles spurgeon i really enjoy charles spurgeon very very tremendous man of god he says if you have not the time you guys know who charles spurgeon is right i mean he's a real charles spurgeon was a real man of prayer it always struck me from years he says i mean way back i don't know when was it back in the 14 1500 somewhere around in there way back in the early times if you have not the time god gave it to you you must have misspent it that's powerful statement in it just like to see the value of what we have in our our disposal god gave us time god gave us an allotment job said he set the boundaries where we can't cross god even has given us allotment within the day he's given us moments in the day and god doesn't tell us how to spend it that's right you know me let me say it like this there my mom remembers this uh when my papa brown he was a mine foreman and they lived in a in a a coal camp so guess what when you worked now this didn't happen all the time but it happened in early times the coal mines paid you in script so guess what that script was useless outside of going to their coal mine owned store you know what i'm talking about brother dave you didn't go oh who has the best deal no no you work for them they give you script and then you got to go to their store you see it's things that when we we're looking at it that when we see it that's not how it is with god god has given us time but god is saying he's not sent there you know he puts everything out no no no you got to spend it right here but he allows he's put into our church you you handle it just like he puts places the money through the jobs we're the ones who's responsible for it what we do with it right now is that right goes into another place here in the message gonna have just a few more moments he says he's admonishing the people he says quit reading the old funny stories and looking at old no-good television programs and get back to church and to pray listen what he says here he said a woman says well i just can't find time to read my bible to my children brother brahman says why susannah wesley had 17 children and bless her heart and she spent three hours a day with no modern convenience now listen brother brahm's not wording this to condemn sisters you see many times what satan wants to put is put something out there to make us believe it's just like as i said i think the holy spirit took us two weeks ago on things that sometimes our schedules can get interrupted and satan would like to make us believe oh your schedule's interrupted well if i can't be right there in the bedroom i'll make this car my closet i'll pray right here are you hearing me it's recognizing i'm not going to be defeated because there's nothing going to stand between me and my god if daniel could live a victorious life in babylon without the holy ghost how much more has the son and daughter of god that we can live right in the midst of mystery babylon a victorious life right in the midst of satan's eden amen hallelujah conditions and our surroundings does not determine whether i have victory or not we have a place in god that we can come to brim says she didn't press a button wash her dishes she didn't turn on a tap and get a little water out like that she packed it from the spring and raised 17 children and could spend three hours a day in prayer i know sometimes i don't have anything down in front of me but i know sometimes you know when we look at this and we read about it he didn't say that suzanna wesley was on her knees now there might be somewhere in the writing that says she was on her knees for three but remember prayer is not the position of our body you talking about 17 children i mean she had to find time to pray and with the needs of 17 children come on friends it's like having a whole great preschool high school right there 17 years old but she found three hours a day at least to pray she was in contact i just want to believe it like this she was in contact with god she might have got up a little bit before them and said god give me this day my daily bread she was in contact and when she was making the egg she was still in contact she was available to almighty god she didn't turn it on and off she realized he is right here with me amen you ought to take that and put that right in the devil's nose he's been in your craw all day you ought to put it right back in his nose what did she raise up out of that notice the effect of this what did she raise up out of this a john and a charles men that shook the world in their days brother said that's what we need more of today is mothers and people consecrated put god first he said we put everything else first and belong to society down there i belong to society too it's up there society belong these are but the society to belong to is a society of jesus christ poor degraded outcast people i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them so glad to belong to that society now notice this word separate yourself come out from the world and don't be partakers with them abraham separated himself and god blessed him how many know that's true and give every promise that he give him he confirmed them to him when he separated himself i'm going to give you another quote before of charles spurgeon here real quick look at charles spurgeon he makes this statement he says it's not a matter of time so much as a matter of heart if you have the heart to pray you'll find the time you might have to find the time in other unconvenient scenarios but you will find it you'll find the time to pray because your heart is in it yes you see think of it in terms of investment i have a figure here in front of me of one day equals eighty six thousand four hundred seconds a little big conversion huh zachary one day this is how many seconds now you realize that if we could put this in dollar signs here eighty six thousand and four hundred dollars and that could be given to you daily and don't anybody start shouting now i've got it here in the slide i don't i think i had it there at eighty six thousand four hundred seconds and now you are given that amount daily man i'm retiring pretty soon man he's gonna put this away but the catch is you lose it whatever you don't spend and tomorrow starts another eighty six thousand four hundred dollars now some of you thinking target here i come exactly what i'm spending on buffalo print here this here i know exactly but i'll say i got no way man i want your mind out there i want you to bring it back back in here now you see we are given 86 400 seconds every day we don't accumulate it what we don't use right like that of the money it goes back and we have a new set each day it matters than what we do each day with what god has given us and we evaluate our life you say brother samuel that sound that that's tension brother braham said when we become a christian you add tension to your life and the tension is the blessing is am i pleasing to my lord now think about that e every investment there's an investment in our time paul said it like this in first corinthians 6 12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any in first corinthians 10 23 paul said all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not that's where it comes down in our lives that god help me to evaluate what things are edifying spiritually building up friends we realize god has spoke to us very clearly we're not you're not we're not going to get away from the natural cares of life there's things that we have to attend to even the things that we don't want to attend to tax season coming up and everything we don't want to attend to some of these things like oh there's you know medical bills or insurance bills or we got to pay we got to get on and pay the bills for this month i don't think anybody in their right mind enjoys doing that or says yippee i'm gonna have some time taking up with that not one person enjoys that i don't think but we recognize there's things that we have to attend to in this life but then there's other things that god god doesn't do it for us but he entrusted to you and i to evaluate in our own life what's expedient to our lives what edifies in our life and think about that with time time well spent all right i'm just going to end right here jesus said in this scripture we opened give us this day our daily bread this is time time time time there's time we can't get back think how brother brahms sat there when he spoke to us in the adoption messages right before that he preached rejected king the first time and he spoke about his visitation beyond the curtain of time and here he was laying in bed remember before he's translated from this body into that theophany here he's laying in the bed and what does he say he says here i am about 50 years old what have i done for you lord i don't know about you but when i think of that i think my goodness what do i have to say brother ramon trying to be humble he was being real with the time that i have here i am almost 50 years old what have i done for you lord because there was a desire in his life i want to do more you see what was it it wasn't this is not the genealogy of random this is a genealogy of a son of god this is what pulsates in our life as sons and daughters of god this is what rivets in our hearts is lord what can i do for you lord time brother brown thought about that with time now just to leave here with this i have these slides but i'm not going to ask them to put them up i'm just going to refer to this this place here you know when we read this quote here and i didn't have any plans on this but it just struck me here yesterday evening just pouring over these things we sometimes look at things and and we can look and say well television programs i'm exempt from that i'm exempt from this okay but we recognize there's things that could come into our life and take our time things that could come in so subtly and that can take our time away from what's the most important thing and one of the things that i was just so impressed upon that came was one thing that we can all say that has come about it's almost in every home and that's these phones the amount of time the average i hope we're not average i hope we're below all right but the average time 144 minutes that a person spends on social media but say i don't have social media average time of americans on their device is five hours a day i i grant it if you probably if you looked at mine and it came to probably maybe yours too this is how i listen to the message from right from here so i can catch it keep going with it when i'm in the store wherever i'm at that's where i listen to it but you also realize you can evaluate everything else that's going on you say brother samuel you know i just go back to one of those you know i'll go back to the original phone you know campbell soup can you know string to somebody else's soup can that'd be nice wouldn't it well no i know phones themselves that's not the only thing but it's one of the things so slightly so subtly how things can come in and it's not even phone when you look at even internet usage and friends listen let's just be real sometimes it just goes from one click to another click to another click to another click to another click to another client oh brother samuel i'm studying but brother bannon tells us and it's clear you can do too much singing too much studying but you can never do too much praying see we have to think about moses what he did and we come back to that quote there can be too much of things that are good things but you can never spend too much time in prayer the things that god is making not just and all of this here it works to try to take away of our time it's incredible when you look at some of the statistics with different things that if a 10 year old starts out there's the over the amount that would possibly be used within a lifetime would be the total of six years and eight months has been dedicated to phone the social media and the internet i say this right here because i know i'm speaking to those who have children parents those who will have children and parents i say right now we must be vigilant all of us to be vigilant in our lives if all of us no matter children or not but very vigilant with these things it can come ever so quickly and i can say this right here look this is not even believers these some of these statistics this is not even from believers but say a person this is from people out in even a psychology realm with looking at mental and mental issues that are going on and saying a person should spend no more than 30 minutes on social media are you hearing me at but sammy you shouldn't say no i have we have to be plain brother brown called we love lucy susie you see all of those things he brought it down but to do what to discern the things that's going on but time well spent it's time in prayer it's time in prayer and if there's anything in the way then get it cleared out if there's anything that causes you not to have confidence to come before him in prayer don't let that stand between you and god repent get that cleared out so the channel is open so you can come before god in prayer and ask god to give to you what you have need of it's time well spent time in prayer is time well spent and satan is vigilant to take our time to fill our time and that's why we have to be vigilant with these things it don't just happen it's not we know it's not just a turn of the switch it's not even when we look at a service like this tonight it's not even something that we just hear tonight and say that's exactly right but it brings us to examination we have to examine our own lives where is my life at where is this at and really examine our lives you see jesus spent much time in prayer i say the bride of jesus christ we're called to spend much time in prayer it's not it's not something of a duty don't look at it it's not to be a duty it's a fellowship it's an opportunity brother branham made this statement like this and the prophet elisha he said you say well brother branham brother brown says you'll find yourself he says you you begin to let down on your prayer life and you wonder what's happening to spiritual blessings he said and you think brother branham but i'm a christian i really don't need to pray that much he said that's a sign if you're a christian you need to pray more than anything because we need his leading there's needs when god is speaking to our hearts and services there are needs that stand out very personal in our lives and as we pray we're seeking for god are you with me friends sometimes there's things there's a wrestling and it's a dying and it's just looking to god's god i i need this lord in my life direction questions we have and we need his his leadership don't you love him tonight i say god may we make a real if i'd say in this way consecration a reconsecration of our lives i mean time well spent heavenly father lord jesus lord when we could stand and we could lord evaluate and of our own accord lord we need help lord because lord sometimes we don't always see things the way that you see them lord you said in your word that lord your ways they're not our ways but they're higher lord i pray father here tonight that god that you would take us lord as your children lord your people that god day in and day out lord sacrificing lord of their life laying side time lord no doubt even as they've gathered here they're tired and weary from the tasks and toils of the day mothers with their children and daddies that's been lord laboring through the day lord god others lord that have passed through some of those seasons of time but yet lord god it's still sacrifice but father i believe that god that as we we come to the house of god it's time well spent but we don't want not as a hearer but to be a doer of the word lord father i pray god that may you just lord help us every one of us lord to so lord evaluate that i'm sure lord there's some things that can be trimmed out things that's infringed upon our time with you lord now lord it it comes to us to redeem redeem that time redeem it it doesn't fall to anybody else it falls to us will we redeem that time we can't go back and redo it but we can buy back take back what rightfully belongs to us we can evaluate down through things oh god and lord with a seal and a desire to do that which is pleasing to you god i pray right now this evening you're here father your presence lord this lord that you've placed lord upon my heart and lord you're here to minister lord to your children you've not come lord to bring condemnation the word comes and brings conviction but not condemnation and lord we can look into our lives and our hearts lord we are witnesses of time well spent in prayer sometimes lord through the course of life sometimes lord things little by little by little begin to encroach may we lord god look upon look over the landscape of our life knowing that god we only are we're here just for a moment of time and lord i'm sure there's some things that if we'll just ask that lord that you would direct us and say you need to buy back up that you need to buy that you need to bring this back from the power of another oh god you're standing right there lord with us lord father from our hearts lord a sacrifice oh god a desire lord to lay it down there'll be a contesting of that lord but i pray heavenly father may we see god of that value of the time and the hour in o god of the things that lord jesus that lord you desire to do in our lives oh god and as we look upon this field it's white with harvest we pray to the lord of harvest we seek lord for those things lord that would be beneficial beneficiary to the kingdom of god lord we've got decisions to make right here lord when we pray there's not only petitions lord but there's decisions that lay before us there's decisions upon hearts lord should i go this way or should i go that way all of these things order before us in prayer lord as well as even in our own lives lord coming to you and lord looking in the mirror of the word and saying oh god change me lord give me strength lord in this area of my life lord i pray father may from this moment lord it just be such a resonating lord that an evaluating and a redeeming of time that god that they we would recognize as sons and daughters of god that time belongs to us it belongs to us but redemption requires sacrifice granted lord we pray grant him lord jesus granted lord jesus oh in the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah oh yeah that's a
