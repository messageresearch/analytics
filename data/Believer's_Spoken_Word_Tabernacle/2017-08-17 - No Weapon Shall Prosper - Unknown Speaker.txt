stand here this this evening Lord Lord at this appointed time behind this pointed place smart Lord we approach you with all the reverence that we know how born more than I ask God that you'll come and be with us in this service Lord as you already have may you open the word to us father to bring encouragement to the prey we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to the glory of God amen I'd like to read from night tonight from Isaiah chapter 54 verse 17 no weapon that is formed against these shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord you may be seated I want to speak on no weapon shall prosper no weapon that is formed against thee it means created any weapon created it also means that there is no ordained weapon that no weapon that is ordained to prosper every weapon that is formed is ordained to fail and it says every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment it means to persist every witness that would persist against the in judgment thou shalt condemn them as being guilty this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the LORD they're just our Justice is of him it's our heritage it's our portion let's look in Isaiah 59 19 oh sure they feared the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now that word standard means a way of escape live up a wave xscape it also a standard means a banner they would the the children of Israel when they came forth and as they were set up according to the tribes after they came out of Egypt they each had a standard or a flag or a banner for each tribe and each one of them represented something and it is always been a time that when those went in anyone went into war to battle they always had a standard or a flag as we would call it that went out before them and here he's going to lift up a standard before him a wave xscape in Exodus 1715 I want to just read this it says Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah nessa which means the Lord is our banner he's our standard he's the one that he that is our wave Escape is in the Lord look with me in Psalms 25 through seven you it says we will rejoice in thy salvation in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all thy petitions know now know that no I that the Lord sayeth his anointed he will hear him with his home with his holy heaven with the from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots summon horses but we will remember the name of the Lord and it says now I know that the Lord sayeth his anointed that he will hear him with his holy heaven from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand Isaiah 59 and one says behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is his ear heavy that means dull or insensitive that it cannot hear he hears our cry and his hand is able to reach to every situation that we have some trust in chariots summon horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God made me think of a song that we used to always sing in the name of Jesus we have the victory amen and I thought of how that when Peter and and John went out from the upper room and as they were going past a gate called beautiful Peter the thing that the saw stand that Peter said to the man that was there that was begging the Rose Lane he said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give are thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk in the name of Jesus amen we'll remember amen when we have nee when we're in trouble we remembered to call on his name and Peter reached out and took the man by the right hand and bidding to arise and it said that he rose up immediately and not only did he walk but he began to leap about amen there's power in the name of Jesus [Music] demons trembled at the name of Jesus amen Satan doesn't want to hear you call on the name of Jesus we'll remember well we call to mind to remember the name of our Lord and his songs of Solomon it talks about he talks about his bride being terrible as an army with banners meaning that an army that went forth in time of war as they would have their banners set before them there would be symbolic images and and things that wrote on them and these things were meant to not only unite the people who was marching behind them but it was also meant to strike terror in the hearts of their enemies for many times on those banners would be the would be things that would declare past victories that would declare that they had been in battle and had won victories and it would be a declaration of that and it was to to strike fear into the heart of the enemy I'll tell you want friends we have a banner tonight and that is Christ Jesus and he has defeated every foe that ever came against him if we'll stay friends what the devil likes to do is get our focus on ourselves our situation and how small we are and how insignificant and how uncapable that we are but he's already won the victory he is our banner and it's a blood-stained banner tonight where he overcame death hell and the grave and he took away the keys I love the way said he took the way Satan's own keys Satan doesn't have keys to his own house anymore Jesus said I have them in the time before Israel came out of Egypt we know that there was many plagues that came upon Egypt and then the last plague was the death angel was to pass through and they were instructed to put blood on the doorposts on the windows of the door and it was to be a token to them that when the death angel solid he would pass over that token there's also the word for banner it was a banner it was a standard that was raised up against the Death Angel the Death Angel couldn't pass over that standard but everyone that wasn't behind that standard the firstborn of everything man beast and all died the Wrentham says this in revelation of Jesus Christ he says now remember this Christ in the truth church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army Satan knows that if you get your faith aligned with this word that you are invincible and that's why he tries to get your focus off that that's why he tries to use scare tactics he'll try to to get us thinking that I one time I was having trouble with my throat I'll give you an example I was having trouble my throat I was having trouble swallowing and I thought well I'm gonna have to go to the doctor it's really giving me a lot of problems and and I didn't know what it was and then somebody came by was visiting with me in debt and they said yeah her brother had that and he died they rushed him to the hospital and turned out to be cancer and he died from it right away this thought went all man you got throat cancer see that's the way the devil works it worked that way too right away to tell you it's something real bad but the thing is don't accept that the devil was trying to tell me that and I hadn't even been to see the doctor yet don't Satan that's the way comes what to try to strike fear because where fear is faith can't take root the perfect love casts out fear amen and I I knew in my heart I love the Lord and I knew the Lord loved me and I knew that Satan couldn't touch me with anything unless the Lord would let him and I was not gonna leave this earth til it was my time and the Lord bit me home so I said I'm not gonna listen to that you know when I went in they just said I had acid reflux and that it had scarred my throat and that's what was the scar tissue building up was closing off my throat while I was having trouble swallowing and all that you know and they just stretched my throat out and everything was fine see that's the way it is it could be something just real simple what's going on but Satan will try to blow it out of proportion feel something comes up and you think all men the sky is falling and it's not and we go around running like Chicken Little the sky is falling the sky is falling look out everything that's going to go wrong it seems to be going wrong you know I said to my mom today under ideal situation under ideal circumstances you could never go through a trial if all these the circumstances were ideal but they're not that's not the way it is that's not the way life is and that's not the way God leads Shubh he led the children of Israel one of the first places they came to was the river was the the waters of Myra which means bitter to the first place they come to was these bitter waters why would he lead his children into these waters that were bitter that they couldn't even drink it was so that he could show them that he was Jehovah God and they instructed Moses said take these branches down and lay them over into the water when they did it turned the water sweet many times we think the situation we're in is real complicated and we think you know boy this is going to be a real task you get this straightened out but with the Lord it was just a simple thing I when I was on my way back home from this last trip I got down to Columbus Ohio and and traffic was coming to a stop that somebody ran into the back of my truck and then my first thought was I hadn't had it two months and I you know got pulled over to the side and I was standing out there waiting on the police to come to make a police report and but they had so many accidents going on that with the injuries and that that they told us said if there's no injuries just exchange information and go on we ain't got time to stop for everybody there were so many accidents and so I was standing there so we just chained the information I went home and I said well it's just gonna delay me and it did it delayed me by a day from my original plans but I don't know why it had to happen I still don't know the thing that I you know God had his hand on me and what I one of the things that I was right away thankful for was that no one was hurt not just myself but the young lady who was driving the car behind me her and she had another young girl in the car was it neither one of them were hurt and I thank the Lord for that that no one got hurt and it was only these two vehicles involved and and not any other people or any other vehicles and I don't know how you know or why it happened or I don't even know exactly how it happened I just know that I was glad to get stopped and then hurt a crunch and so but I don't have to know what happened you know maybe there maybe there was a need for God to delay me a day from when I said and I don't know and I may never know but the thing is I don't have to know because I know that his hand is upon me and wherever I go and whatever I'm doing he's watching out for me he knows things that I don't know he can see things I can't see who knows what may have laid up ahead maybe it wasn't to delay me by a day maybe it was to delay me by an hour I don't I don't know but I know that he had his hand upon me and there was no injuries and the truck fixed and there's no big deal you know I I didn't get angry or anything I just was really uh really down about it I wasn't I wasn't mad at the girl or mad at anybody else - I wasn't hollering nothing like that I just was I just felt really down about the thing that here was my truck smashed in the back but when I took it in they sure me they could make it look new and they did and Oh for whatever reason it was while it served its purpose was no scent there was no reason to be upset about it everything was gonna be all right every tongue that shall rise against the end judgement shot by condemn I tell you Satan works constantly to try to bring false accusations against you by myself [Music] one of the one of the boys that we had took and adopted and raised well he wanted to go live with his his birth mother after some time because he didn't like our rules and and he didn't want to abide by them and I let him go because I was tired of him not abiding by him and staying you know sneaking out of the house and staying gone two three or four in the morning and coming in not knowing where he been and what was going on or what kind of trouble he was gonna get into or what kind of trouble he was gonna get me into and then you know then the disrespect that he showed and all that and so I let him I said you can go and so there he was and then we were going through that thing with you with the one of the girls that I told you about when I was here - last time and while we were going through that while he wanted his sister he wanted us to let her go to come stay where he was staying and I said I'm not letting her out of my sight and I'm not letting her to be influenced by anyone else and long as the court case is going on I was gonna keep my eye on her and so he when I wouldn't do when he wanted why him and his girlfriend got together and they went on Facebook and they wrote up this big old long long long thing bunch of lies about us and our family and about how that that girl had been abused and all kinds of other things they accused us of doing and and that and they just it was horrible and so my wife she printed it off and so they they had blocked her on Facebook from her seeing it dad blocked her I don't know how all that works but I was I was raising pups and selling pups and I was advertising on Facebook and I wasn't advertising them under my name and so then none of them knew I had a Facebook because it was just about my dogs and so my wife said he'd go on your Facebook and see if I can get in and see what they broke but somebody told us about it and she printed this stuff off and it was horrible didn't what was even the worst part about it the prosecuting attorney on the case we were dealing with got ahold of it and so she was gonna bring him in as some kind of witness which all he had was a bunch of lie and it was really hurtful thing and I thought well some of the things they said I thought the next thing you know what we're gonna have the animal protection we got here on us because some of the stuff that he had said about how we treated animals or whatever and those you all know me they've known me for years but you know how wouldn't mistreat no animals and I it was it really hurt all these lies he made up and then they went and reported all this stuff to all the different news agencies and I guess they were going to try to force us to give up that girl but I well I'm not going to do it and I told them I said she's going to stay with us until this court trials over with I said and then after that then we'll see and but you know just the they they came din later knocked on the door on him on to that was that all happened on a Thursday and on Monday they him and the girlfriend came in knocked on the door and ever seen sorry and all this in the other you know and I don't know why they were saying sorry but I've been praying for for God to do something to take that down but even by the time they took it down it has spread all over the place and being it was down in Tennessee why it spread to even some of the other churches down there and I called up a friend of mine was telling him hey if you see this stuff or anybody under seasoned you know I'll tell you what it is he's telling a bunch of lies because he's trying to force me to do something he want and so even even the the girl she told that when the lawyer and the prosecutor showed her what they had printed off she told him she says that's a lie she's my they never treated us like that so even her with all her lies and what she was trying to force our hand everything she said in all that ain't true you know and so the lawyers couldn't couldn't try to use that against us saying you know that she didn't have a good home environment and you know after they took it down you know and and but it had already got out there and it hurt and it hurt to even think about it but the thing is and I thought about this scripture every tongue that shot rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn and here they had said these things that weren't true and they had persisted to try to bring accusation against us but they're the ones that's going to be guilty because you you know anyone that would lie on a child of God is in trouble that's the truth but one thing that he should have known better than was that the Lord said touch not my anointed to do my prophets no harm and his own maternal grandmother she did some things against us said some things and then called up and left a message on my machine this had been some time before all this she left it just a horrible message to me in and then my mom was down visiting and we went to drive over password that her grandmother had worked there at a local newspaper she was outside in the front smoking a cigarette when we drove by and when she saw me she coming she just quickly turned turned her back like this and I said I don't know if my mom remembers as I said all I wish she hadn't done that I wish she hadn't have done that there wasn't no time after that she had a stroke she ended up in a nursing home and before she left here my daughter was one of the nurses end up taking care of her and before she left here my daughter said she had lost her mind completely you can't you can't touch God's children and think you'll get by with it and I even to her own daughter warned her and said mom don't say them things about him or do those things you don't know he's a man of God but brother branham says he said I was thinking today this isn't a Redemption by power how that this day we're going to have to answer for I'm going to have to answer for the questions that was before me or the generation that will be after me but in judgment I'm just then I'm not going to have to answer for the generation that was before me or the generation was after me but in the judgment I'll stand with this generation and I said with all the preaching I said sometimes it seems I told my wife sometimes it seems it doesn't do any good but I've gotten to be the voice of warning anyhow regardless of what the people does about it I've got to preach the gospel anyhow and give a witness under the resurrection of the power of Jesus Christ that then forsake it turn their back God will judge them at the judgement for it I'm only responsible for preaching and other ministers to who preached the gospel and here Moses he told him to lift up the rod that rod was a judgement rod now it wasn't Moses rod it was God's rod if you notice Moses he took the rod he held it like this pleasecome he hovered over the waters to turn the blood it was God's judgment rod and that same rod get it that same rod was what he smoked the rock with and the cleft come in the side of the rock and the waters came out of the rock now the rock was Christ and it was God's judgment the day you eat thereof the day you'll die smoke Christ at Calvary and paid that bitter agonizing death no man could ever describe what it was or never will their God placed all the divine judgment upon him and smote him in a sign when out of his side come water and blood and spirit for our Redemption remember the preaching of this word will stand in the judgement and a heart to stand behind it and I'll have to be a witness to that I can't take it back I've done said it I got to stay with that it's going to meet me in the judgment just as God said his word can't be tucked back now I weigh every word first of my heart to see if I want to say it myself I [Music] say it God has me say it I say it anyhow cause it's him I want to be sure because I don't want any mistakes at that day they tried to this word here where it's talking about if every tongue that shall rise against the end judgment it's not talking about necessarily be judgment it just it means any tongue that would rise to get you to say something to bring some kind of accusation against you that but it's God why would they do something like that because they don't like the spirit that's in them doesn't like the spirit that's in you pardon me people should be more careful but you know what we're living in a time and generation where there's less respect now lenders I think then there's ever been on the time of this earth children don't respect parents they don't respect teachers they don't respect elders they're not taught to respect them it's because they're being raised by a generation who who were a bunch of renegades you and I think about the professor's that's in the college in the 60s that were probably smoking pot now they're now they're in the colleges as elder professors they got all these liberal ways of thinking they tried to teach him pass on to this generation come from a generation where they didn't want to call mom and dad mom and dad anymore they wanted to instead of calling mom and dad they wanted to call him by their name disrespect and now we're living in a time of complete disrespect program says in the midst of professions you know it's going to be awful dark down at the river that day ain't going to be nobody there to help you you ain't going to take no money down there your friends are going to be in the same shape you are in it's going to be an awful dark you got it cross I want to be sure my tickets right I want to be sure when I look up that I see the red blood banner of my master that's what I want to know that I've come underneath that blood of Jesus Christ and that the judgments of God I don't come into the condemnation the judgments of God are held back why because we've already allowed ourselves to be judged here by God and by His Word then when I hear after wild the old ship blow it's going to be alright then I don't want no trouble down there then I want it settled in here now if there's any trouble I want it settled now I'm going to need every bit of grace I can get at that day I'm gonna be honest we need every bit of grace surgeons would see Jesus said all around over the country you find I said to some of my friends that was with me and I said I wonder what it'll be when we cross over the other side and all this generation stands up in the judgment those I've preached to and those I'll have to stand as a witness for or against God will know all things where they received or whether they did not and the attitude they've taken and what it'll be then when it in to millions around the world I thought about these children that we took in to raise we adopted him we gave them we gave him love we gave them what we didn't treat him any different than we did the first four that were born to us we stood in court and we raised our hand and swear to the judge that we would treat those children just like as if they had been born to it that was the very words we had to swear when we were adopting them and and we did and they've had grand opportunities Madison the oldest girl she's still with us she's 19 years old he's graduated high school she's completed two EMT course she goes out on she voluntarily goes out on rides with these EMTs different times who were volunteer work she's working as a CNA at the nursing home were my daughter Jessica worked and she signed up to go to college to become a nurse and college starts here in September she starts in to school for that and not only that but she received they are paying completely for her schooling and because of other things that she done in this while she was in high school she got other to call it I guess scholarships she even got a scholarship from the Red Cross and you know the other ones the other three leftist had the same opportunity to make something of themselves and one day I know they'll look back and you'll see they missed it it was this year if the oldest boy would have stayed with us and followed through he would have graduated from college this year but instead he's out somewhere trying to make a go of it by starting his own little businesses which is failure after failure because he tries to take a shortcut with everything and because he didn't want to serve God that's why he wanted to leave us cuz he he wanted to do worldly things and wanted to have a live-in girlfriend and all these other things and he knows it's wrong but one day they'll they'll look back and they'll see the opportunities that they walked over top of us and left you know and here will is the youngest boy still when is he starting high school this year just started as a freshman and we're doing all we can to point him in the right direction just keep him in prayer because I know in these high schools why there's all kinds of things to try to distract them and I just want him to have his life just firmly dedicated to the Lord where he can overcome these things of the temptations of the world but I know that they not only had these opportunities for bettering themselves in those ways but they were kept in the house of the Lord and they were taught the things of the Lord and they know better than the stuff they're doing I talked to the oldest boy on the phone he told me I know better I know I'm wrong he said but I I just can't come back to church he said cuz I don't know if I'm ready to quit doing this stuff and serve God in the judgment some day if they don't turn around we'll stand as a witness that will stand as a witness against them they had opportunity they were raised by parents that kept him in church kept of the word there gave them good examples and they'll it will stand as a witness against them in that day they won't be able to say well God I didn't cause I had a bad dad and I had a bad mom and all this in the other and don't be no excuses because God gave them opportunity the Bible says this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord it's this is what falls to us it's our heritage that no weapon would prosper it's our heritage that no tongue would be able to rise against us in judgment it belongs to us whether I'm said not only do the things we can see belong to us he said that we are heirs to the things that you cannot see we're heirs he said to all the temporal things you can see said we're heirs to this world but he says we're also heirs to two things you can't see like healing divine healing summon you you can't see it but yet it's there amen and there's only there was only one way brother Bentham said to get anywhere with God and that is to believe that he is here and he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him you've got to believe that you've got to have faith to believe that I've told you the truth and I would not tell you unless first I know that it was true and I'm sure though me being a man and subject to mistakes that God is infallible and can't make a mistake he said if you believe according to your faith be it unto you how does this work the he that no weapon would prosper because we have faith to believe that's God's Word and that's our heritage I believe no weapon will prosper I believe that no tongue will be able to stand up in judgment against a child of God or the venom said in the church age book said their righteous is of me saith the Lord the Jews did not call him holy then they do not call him holy now but he is the holy one where thou shall not leave my soul in Hell neither without suffer thy Holy One to see corruption they sought their own righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy holiness is of the Lord any quotes but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption and he quotes again that we might be made the righteousness of God in him it was Christ or perish and they perished for they refused him the men of that age even as today were making the same mistakes as the Jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the Philadelphia age they were taking refuge in the church it's not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in Christ this is the record that God has given us eternal life that this life is in his son he than half the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not life and he says again but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead she also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you man is made holy by the Spirit it is a spirit of holiness that raised Jesus from the dead that dwells in us and makes us holy and His Holiness there he stands the holy one we will stand with him clothed his righteousness holy with his holiness oh I'm so glad that my holiness is not of myself I'm glad that I'm in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imparted unto me rather random in this message of faces of substance he was preaching of course on faith and he talked about people coming into prayer line he said that would say they had faith and he said and some of them he said were suffering from cancer and citizen I knew they didn't have enough faith to be healed from a toothache and he said but faith it's a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen see it's a substance it's something direct something that you really have not something you're imagining something that you think you have but it's some direct positive act that you have you see what I mean it's a substance and things hoped for the evidence of things not seen let's take part of this scripture the substance of things hoped for there's three things Hope charity and faith is that right now hope is one element faith is another element charity is another element charities love I've seen many people come here by lovely people real Christians but didn't have enough faith to be healed and some sinner passed by and has faith to be healed it's another element all together it's not how well you serve God it's an element that you possess yourself it's not how well you serve God but it's if you're fully persuaded how is it that no weapon of prospered because we're fully persuaded that's God's Word and no matter what comes up against us it'll not prosper it will not get victory over us it will not defeat us because we already have the victory in Christ Jesus the laburnum was talking about Elizabeth and how he said that it couldn't seem like didn't seem like maybe she was pregnant but said the angel of the Lord had spoke to her and though they many wouldn't believe it because they said she was bearing brother BAM says she was looking to the unseen then God's promises if you'll look to the unseen then God's promises always produce what is asked for we asked the Lord we you know I go to the Lord and I pray to him like I was just talking to someone I let him know how I'm feeling that way if I'm not feeling right if I got a wrong view on something we can get it straightened out amen if if something has bothered me in a way to where I don't go around pouting about it well somebody's hurt my feelings well I get down and I pray and I tell God how I'm feeling how it's bothering me you know and if it's on me then we can get that straightened out I can get over that little petty feeling you know hallelujah because you don't want brother BAM said you seem like your brother do something against should go and pray for him you'll find out after wise not wasn't your brother it was the devil amen sometimes people will say something and and they don't mean it the way you end up taking it and but the devil will jump on that and get you before you know it your thoughts is doesn't ran a million miles off with it and you got this before you know it you got this person like that they're against you when they're not against you at all the devil tries to work on feelings like that I pulled the church back home we need to get our focus off these little petty feelings and things and get our focus on where we're at we're at the end time we're getting ready to take a rapture and what our focus should be on is Lord what do I need to take this rapture where am i lacking one of my yet missing what because we know we have to be perfect to go Lord when we're in is it outside of this flesh what do I need and I ask the people I said I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand or to actually tell me but think this to yourself when's the last time you prayed for the preacher before you come to church you know we should be praying for one another we should be praying for this service and if you got any complaints about what's being preached didn't start praying about it so our dumb Lord gave me to preach something else let's see how far that gets you we should put the Lord first that's where our focus should be as you know the man of God came down there was a little woman she was getting two sticks to go make a fire and he said go make me a cake first and she said I only got enough cake enough meal and enough all to make one cake for me and a lad we're gonna eat it and then we're gonna die and he said make me a cake first and said the mill barrel never will be empty in the crew so all will never run dry nor the RAM said see she had to put God first we should always put God first he says she put God before her children she put God before anything else she taken the kingdom of God first God must have first place in your first place in your life first place and everything you do and what or what you are first place in your God must be first he doesn't want the second place he doesn't deserve the second place he deserves the best and the first and all that we've got he deserves it blessed be his holy name for God also bearing witness he gave testimony both with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will not what men's not what men say what the church said but what God's will was what we need to seek the will of God not the favor of our neighbor not the favor of your children not the favor of your husband or your wife but seek the will of God and do that first maybe y'all don't have any family troubles up here we get him down our way but you know what what comes first is God not family and if we'll put him first he said he was the eternal one an object of worship he had nothing to worship and there was no angels no nothing but God alone him alone is eternal but in the order to be God there had to be something to worship Him so he created angels and beans and cherubims and so forth and worship him his great clam began to unfold his great plan but remember you in the stature that you are in this warning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now for you there's some part that's in you that's eternal there eternal and eternal only belongs to God and in God was his thinking of you sitting right where you are now it is thinking I stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and knows all things therefore he could tell the infant beginning because he's eternal and you being a son or daughter of God then you were in his thinking at the beginning and then when the Holy Spirit come and you're on earth walking around here as a sinner way down in your life there there is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry I heard the presbyterian brother I heard the Baptist talking about back there and the Free Will Baptist preaching and my fellow brother that you there's something in you something that you never put in there is something that you couldn't desire to be in there is something that's contrary to your own nature it's the foreknowledge of God taking place God's Word say why did you read that to show you that you are ordained and the Bible says that there is no weapon that is ordained to prosper against you but you are ordained of God to win I believe if we get our focus right everything else is gonna fall in place I wanted to share one other thing with you before I close tonight brother Branham was talking about he saw this young woman said she was dancing across the floor where he was and said he saw her and then up to him walked to a person that he called dr. Brown and they got to talking and he and he said dr. Brown told him said we've got thousands of members and he said we sent out he said I sent out thousand cards and ask people if they pledge that they come on Wednesday night prayer meeting at least for six months in the year and he said do you know how I'm in he responded out of thousands he said five and brother Branham said you don't want he said you see that little girl over there dancing around across the floor he said that Clayton Mike Mitchell was spinning that old wildcat thing whatever it was you think that she he would have to get her to sign a card to come down there and dance he said do you think mr. Mike Mitch would have to have her sign a card to come on over there naw she pawned what clothes she had gone to get there for it's in her heart she couldn't live without it I said you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down there to the altar and let them pray through to the Holy Ghost sets their souls on fire and there'll be no signing cards and here's the part I wanted to get to you if God's in their heart God goes to church he loves to worship if God's in her heart God goes to church he loves to worship Amen I love to go to church now you say does your flesh always feel like one nope nope les doesn't always feel like going matter of fact or more times than not it don't feel like going it cannot let them get discouraged real easy but it's something in me that cries for the fellowship of my brothers and sisters there's something in me that knows that we get together we draw strength from one another amen have you been going through something then you get around your brothers and sisters you begin to realize I'm not alone we're going through this but the Word of God speech that we're going to be victorious amen hallelujah they come to the instruments tonight let's all stand I just think that of course victory is mine victory is mine victory is mine [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'm on my way to heaven and the journey gets sweeter everyday walking with Jesus talking with Jesus all in all the way but my soul gets so happy I sing and I shall not today I'm on my way to heaven and the journey gets sweeter every day let's eat again I bought my way to him [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] my heart [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen I didn't matter what trials come our way the journeys getting sweeter why cause we're getting nearer to the end of our journey amen been a long time been a long journey but we're drawing near to the end that not to make us afraid it ought to make you shout with joy amen amen I'm ready to be done hey man I'm ready to go on to the next stage amen where it don't have to be interrupted worshiping the Lord Amen we just can sing and breeze and worship the Lord we don't have to stop go to work tomorrow there be a day a man is coming a man I'm looking forward to a man amen [Music] [Music] you [Music]
