life all over my life I see your promises in fulfillment all over my all over my life Hallelujah [Music] amen amen amen amen amen amen you think about that scripture uh where David said at the very end of Psalms 23 he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow after me all the days of my life amenallah and I never forget years and years ago I heard uh my brother Tim puit quote that scripture and this was back in 97 but he went in and defined that word as it's in the Hebrew lexicon which means follow after means chase after I wasn't chasing after God's goodness and now I'm still it's God's goodness his Mercy that's chasing after me [Music] thank you Lord that's powerful it's powerful that's never never left me every time I read that scripture you know I can I can almost hear Brother Tim's voice when I read it but it's just that that I love how that's so defined you know because it means a little different than to follow after that means I'm being pursued amen we're being pursued by the mercy and the goodness of God Amen I'm so glad about that aren't you amen so good to amen be in Fellowship here tonight good to be gathered together we just want to turn our attention to the amen to the word of the Lord tonight I also want as we invite go into the scriptures I want to ask you as we get ready to have a word of prayer uh to also remember brother Homer Loria if you would when he got back um last week he got hit with the flu some days after he got back and so um so we just um we've been been inh been holding him up in prayer and then I just checked on him here again just yesterday and he he said he's you know it's it's been rough you know he's had some uh the medicine had some shots and things like that so certainly appreciate the prayers that we just continue to hold him up in prayer amen and we sir love brother Homer sir appre appreciate him here de dearly and so I know there's many other needs and requests that were mentioned here tonight even some that I don't see that maybe normally or typically would be here we just want to remember them in prayer as well amen and so let's let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer amen and maybe if you got a need on your heart just an uplifted hand to the Lord Lord just just pass by my way Lord tonight amen amen Heavenly Father Lord we are standing here Lord not because we're Worthy but because you're the worthy one Lord you have made us accepted in the Beloved amen Lord we are completely as Paul would sum it up we are your workmanship Lord from start to finish Lord father we we're standing by your grace tonight and Lord with that pulsation in our hearts Lord we lord want to lift up Lord Brother Homer and dear God every other request that Lord has already been mentioned every unspoken request every need behind every uplifted hand burden Lord upon a heart we want to Lord lift it Lord Before the Throne of God so Lord we come in that alls sufficient name there's no greater name that Lord that could be ever given than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to think of it dear God that Lord as you have given us your name that's your own life Lord oh God like the prophet talked about Moses going down to Egypt with that Rod of judgment Lord and how that Rod Lord it it typified the very deity that is in the name of Jesus Christ and so Lord we're standing here father with our hearts oh God just Lord with Redeeming Grace and Lord our hearts Lord filled with the goodness of God and Lord with calling upon the name of Jesus Christ for the different needs Lord every need that right now that is upon the hearts and minds of your children Lord for brother Homer Lord I pray that you'll continue to minister strength and healing to his body Lord father throughout the assembly Lord may you continue to minister strength to the body Lord of Believers Lord touching those Lord that might be Lord sick Lord in their bodies I I don't know father each one but you know those needs Lord father you know the needs that's behind the hands you know Lord and you are more than able and willing to minister to each of our needs Lord as we just put them all Lord and lay them all before you tonight we ask that you would come in a special way once again Lord God give us Grace that we can step out of the way that you can step in minister to our hearts and say what needs to be said tonight Lord we commit this service and your lord and all that will be said and done into your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen let's go in the scriptures to back to Job chapter 26 and want to just say it was just such a wonderful time on Sunday that time of Fellowship my I I was so thankful for all that the Lord did for us in the service but I that that time of Fellowship there I well I left out of there and I didn't even need my Sunday nap I was so encouraged I I really mean that I was so encouraged I I know brother Aon we talked about being tired and I talked about going home and but I tell you it was so just so just so blessed me amen just to see amen the people of God and being able to come together and I know sometimes we have extraneous circumstances and so forth but it's just such a blessing amen wasn't it just such a blessing so amen um let's go let's look here in a few verses of scripture and then we'll um let you be seated I want to go back here into verse one and job answered and said how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength and how hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is to whom hast thou uttered words and whose Spirit came from thee amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you go ahead and kick it over for me Brianna if you don't mind I want to just speak here tonight on a a thought that's continuing with where we were at in job 26 and that is I'd like to if the Lord would help us and that is living beyond our duty and we think of Duty we think of responsibility we think of purpose and if the Lord will just just help us tonight uh to as we look upon these things and to recognize that within it you know job is speaking to uh the Brethren who are there and as we have mentioned before I I don't believe that these Brethren came in a way that they would um I believe they intended to be helpful I don't believe they intended to come there and weary him and everything else I believe they had a lot of good intentions but you know this is where that even with all of the intentions and the motives sometimes there there's a takes a time of actually testing um and really seeing God with what I have on my heart how how should that come forth remember David had had real good intentions on bringing the ark back to Jerusalem had very good intentions when he put the Ark on the on the new cart but but God uh God will bless when it's it's got to be just more than good intentions we want to operate according to God's Will and so we remember that even when David just when he went and he sought counsel and sometimes those are things that in our life and I know sometimes we don't always have the uh o opportunity to go and maybe to exactly at a moment go and there's some things that doesn't Merit us getting away and praying you know there's when you see a need you just act upon it if it would be out here tonight or wherever it would be but there's other times where we can have uh something that comes upon our heart maybe someone or uh and and some need and we begin to pray even within at times in the family we we know it sometimes we we don't just jump on things and express things right away sometimes we have to wait for the right time the right words and and that's where even within that God's also teaching us patience you see through the things that we encounter in life and the little things that we go through it God is working out and molding our character our character is molded in so many different facets as we will uh wait on the Lord and Look to Him in many things and I think uh all of us have no doubt been there at one time or another where we have acted ahead of God or acted ahead and we've got really enthused about something and and realized that where we were enthused if we just take it before God and wait on the Holy Spirit God will not only uh give and condition us for the moment but he'll open the door and those are things that we can always count on with God and is as he will do that and I I'm just those are things that I know that I'm speaking also to some veterans and things tonight but those are just things sharing from my heart as God would lay it even upon my heart that you know we've learned to wait upon God and I think that's the greatest one thing that we can do is wait on him and so within this I I want to look at this thought of living beyond our our duty and perhaps these are things that will uh go beyond or maybe to uh God will help was to develop this point within here but you know within these these Brethren as they came to job you know they they knew the expression that was through job's life as we've read through many times rehearsing different scriptures they saw how he strengthened the feeble they saw how his words were encouraging to others and it and it should have been at that time that they would have been able to take at a lesson and an example to just sit there at that moment even when they came and it must have been overwhelming because the Bible said they sat there for seven days and didn't utter a word I can't imagine how job must have looked to them it it no doubt was so startling to them that they might have walked up and maybe it was just like they were going to walk right past him but they knew they were on his property but but somehow or another when looking at him after seven days then that's where they begin to some way in their own way tried to minister help but yet it wasn't ministering help now I believe believe that God will always and he will come in ways to minister help to us to bring us back on the right pathway if we've gotten off on the wrong path his grace will always do that God never leaves us at a dead end but God will always bring us to Calvary I remember one of the first times is through the first moments of in just myself just ministering and and preaching I remember one of the things that my dad sat down and he told me he said son he said you never leave the people without a way back he said you can preach things and he said the strength he said and how correction can come he said but you never leave the people without a way back he said because Calvary has always made a way for restitution so those are just things that even I can remember when we were on route to just being a boy just when God had called me and things that he would just drop my way and I've always looked at that because there's no situation Beyond Redemption if God is delivered I look at it this way if God has dropped and brought a message to you you and I then I I don't believe there's anything beyond Redemption I in other words if there is then it's going to be something between that individual or that person's in God but it's not going to be between me and that individual and God knows how to sort all those things out so so in living beyond our duty you know it's like you know within something that sometimes you can even walk into stores or places of certain restaurants you know and man I mean you know if you go to ask them Beyond they're running the register and so if you if you go to ask them maybe for a refill that's that's that's beyond their Duty and yet they're working for that you know that restaurant I mean you know that that's beyond but yet you know when you you see things I can remember probably many of us can fellowship with this that when you worked and you did things when I taught school and other things like that there are many things that we at times will do that was beyond just what the necessities of our own classroom or our own responsibility is there's times where we would go beyond just just to be of a help and and to see there was a need that was there maybe sometimes you know walking by a classroom and man I needed to get down to mine but somebody May needed a table moved and you know the janitor wasn't there the fireman so you know we just don't set around you know I mean we were Union but you know you just don't sit around and just say well we'll just wait for the next guy who's a union guy to you know show up you know we didn't lean on shovels or anything like that we just would get in there and if you need this mood hey all right I I help you move move this hey I you're go ahead you need to get in there when these finish copying I'll bring them over to your room or I'll run them down and sometimes it's little things like that of just even in the natural of living beyond our duty because sometimes we can get so trapped just within our own borders and yet God wants us to live uh not not and when I want to say this in this way living beyond just what he's called us to do because when we go beyond with just what he's called us to do there's a blessing within it and what God and it's a help that God has called us and where and where he would call us to minister to let me let me get into this here in the scripture here in tonight it says in Romans 12:4 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office or the same function so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait or on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exort on exhortation he that giveth Now watch how this watch how Paul will go into this he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity or in other words not as though to promote one's own self-interest so notice how this is being tied in of the many gifts in the body Paul did not somehow just you know lift up the ministerial gifts and then take these parts down here on he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity then somehow put us in the footnotes or superscription on really really small letters but it's a vital part of the body of Jesus Christ he would say let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence and he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness I I certainly believe that all of us are called to show Mercy but you know when we look at this then evidently evidently that there would be some within the body that would even this would be such a part of their Ministry to actually show Mercy I I wonder how much that maybe that they would struggle because no matter what God has called you to when you really you you never feel sufficient to the task you you don't as a matter of fact the whatever God has called you to the more you feel insufficient as you go along I I've been ministering for for well now pastoring for 22 years I don't feel that I'm more capable now than I was when I started matter of fact I feel more insufficient than I did when I first started I I feel the burden even in a greater way I feel the responsibility in a greater way I I tell you I realize my my need of him is in a greater way than it's ever been I'm not just telling you that that's the truth that's exactly how I feel over and over over asking God Lord give me the wisdom because I don't know how to approach this I might think but I I need your wisdom you see God has a way of so tempering Our Lives to where that he will help us and encourage us to look beyond our insufficiencies and to look to him who is the sufficiency of all things remember God did not call us because we had great strengths we had great abilities but God himself Paul would actually say it like this you see that not many mighty and Noble is actually called but God has called the base things the weak things many things that we would look over in the choosing but God has called it in that way why the prophet said as we would surrender our weaknesses to him he'll pour his strength in and move through our lives so so the whole thing comes down to him receiving the glory and I would say that no doubt that no you know within things that those who would would give those who would show Mercy those even when it comes to the difference of the ministering of the gifts I mean because no man who's a minister knows exactly to what what level of how God is going to even use that Ministry or that gift it's really not up to the man as far as how that gift is used the Bible said every gift will make room for itself so a man anybody that has a gift doesn't have to trample over doesn't have to put himself forward if God sees fit to use that gift in whatever capacity it will have to be God to use that gift and may God help that individual to stay in a place to where God can continue to use it but let me just say this if God would take one gift and maybe it's a ministering gift and God would take that gift and that man might only preach once out of a year and here's a pastor that would preach time and time again but you know what as long as that one person would stay within what God has called them to do they are thought of just as much in the conom and Kingdom of God as him that would Minister or those that would sing specials over and over we are thought of just as much if we will do what God has called us to do but many times brother Ram says God has to drive us into our correct Ministry aren't you glad that he'll do that I'm glad he will amen so cuz I'll tell you what he had to drive me cuz I didn't want to be a pastor I was happy just being a minister being a pastor I left the room many times a mom can witness to it when Dad would go to bring it up I I got to a point I said I'm telling you I'll see you tomorrow good night I I didn't want it it wasn't that I didn't love God's people I love God's people it just scared me to death when I seen the responsibility of it and I looked at it and this is exactly what I told my dad if you need me to visit more people if you need me to take the midweek Services I'll do anything more that you want me to do but you're my pastor no more discussion then something happened but needless to say you know when you get to looking at it I I think that for the most part that we can Fellowship on that point that many times as we deal with that part of feeling insufficient and one of those things because sometimes we will do the very thing that the Bible tells us not to do in comparing ourselves with one another and that's the worst thing that we can ever do God uses each one in a very a certain way and a certain uh uh just for a certain uh calling and a certain way he wants to use it and to a certain degree now notice how brother BR puts this here because when we're talking about this it's actually yielding our members now we know what yielding is you know when you're yielding it's like brother Bram described that coat you know you trying to put the coat on you put your arm in here now you need somebody to take your hand and put it down this sleeve to yield means simply to get out of the way and some one of the greatest places for us to get out of the way is right here yes is right in our minds that's where Satan will try to get us in our minds and we start entertaining certain thoughts but this is exactly what God calls us to do is just yield I I'll I will do my work through you now brother B says it like this and our hope is in God he said all right now here his spirit is here he's the same yesterday today and forever he's moving in his church church you know what's the matter with it here's what it is you're not yielding to the Holy Spirit you receive the Holy Spirit and think well that's as much as I go I mean I'm sealed I mean let's look at it let's just Fellowship don't read ahead of me now let's just Fellowship what what's what what what is all the laboring what is all the ministering of the word be sealed right give your life to the Lord the salvation of the Lord God working cleaning up that life and then that life being filled with his presence that's the whole goal is that lives would be sealed Away by the spirit of the Living God the the Holy Spirit that's the achievement in our life it's nothing less than that it's to be filled with God's spirit to be inhabited by him but remember Sanctified means set aside for service and the Holy Spirit comes to put us in service is that right now notice he says you're just ready to go to to work for God then when you're when you receive the Holy Spirit by Believing on Jesus Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit then you're just a candidate to go to work for God then go to yielding your members to him and see what he will have you do he might have you to preach sing testify pass out tracks talk to people bring someone to church all kinds of gifts and helps that's in the body of Christ some are called for one thing and some another now this is what was the key here is that the prophet would say at the end of that point right there go to yielding your members to him see what he will have you to do right oh my as he goes on he says but no matter what you got how little it is well brother Brandon the only thing I can do I I I might I might talk to some people well that may not be very much to you but put it in the hands of Jesus and see what he'll do with it like the little fishes that was in the little boy's hand it could only feed him but when he put it in Jesus hand it fed 5,000 so it will be with you put what you have in his hand now notice how notice how the prophet has said this inviting somebody to church passing out tracks Ministry all of these other parts preaching singing testifying it's all part of the body remember the spirit of God working in our life I can say it like this our lives are not meant to be a black hole where it's all of a sudden it's just and just the spirit of God received and there's no outworking that's not how God intended it it's just like the plants that are out here or the the crops across the road they receive nourishment not just the rain that's coming down but do you realize every time that we have a thunderstorm you can study this out in science when we study when we have a thunderstorm and lightning strikes the ground you know what's happening nitrogen is being put into the soil and our plants need certain nutrients in order nitrogen being one of them that will actually begin to bring from that soil sometimes we wonder why the tests and trials we come through as the Bible said love it has it says in the Book of Psalms sometimes we're tossed like a bottle stopper we're tossed on the sea of Life the Bible said when we come to our wits end when we're in places and it seems like lightning striking here and lightning striking there remember the prophet said the old southern expression raining cats and dogs but yet we're realizing out of all of that what's God doing he's imparting into our life the nutrients that are actually needed to produce fruit within our lives my my my and yet and yet through all of this through little things that we that we can do and I don't want when I say little things I'm not belittling anything I'm just saying sometimes the things that we're looking at we can actually be looking Beyond where we're at and what God has called us to do and somehow we look at it as it's insufficient it's menial it'll never have any impact at all but remember like the lord gave us that example again last week we do not know that little lady's name who rented that horse that horse barn cleaned it out it was not a a Duty or for a job that anybody would have been signing up for I mean come on I mean I don't even like picking up the dog stuff in my backyard let alone going and picking up horse manure out of a barn and cleaning it up but you know what God put that burden on her heart and she did her part God God worked through her and yet now we know Dwight Moody and what came out of it let me tell you something every soul that Dwight Moody led to the Lord will be attributed to her account and yet we don't even know her name but God knows her name he knows all about it you know I wonder if she could have no doubt wrestled in her mind well I wonder who's going to come and oh maybe I can't do that I I wouldn't be able to do that but I I would say that it got to such a place in her life through all the tests through all the trials through all the molding and all the shaping to where she would get to such a place to say yes Lord see that brings it down home doesn't it it gets get God works with us and works with us sometimes we'd wonder why he continues to fool with us right because man we'd be ready to discipline our children and leave them in the corner or SWAT them or anything else as many times as he's had to tell us and get on us about things or encourage us but you know what God continues to work and to encourage us because he wants to live out that part and portion of what he's called us to do and you know what it isn't enough to me to tell him God this is what I want to to do I want to do this but God may not want that may not be what God's called me to do God may may God will use somebody else this is why we God doesn't want us being like somebody else God wants us to be who we are and him living his own life through US amen woo my my my so it's living beyond self that's a tall task cuz really there's nobody we love better than self that's all right I'll say amen for you and me both right living beyond self but you know what this is where the Holy Spirit comes by way of the new birth to Deliver Us from self and he keeps working in our lives depending on how we're made up you know and all these different things God but God's still working to Deliver Us from self and bring us into that place of living for him you know brother BR would say it like this in one place I want you to just listen to this before I read the next quote he tend of how that Paul himself said I preach the gospel and Paul said you know I've got a right to live of the Gospel he said but I've chosen to sacrifice and make tents on the side Paul said marriage is Honorable the bed undefiled it's it's it's it's totally permissible by God it's an honorable thing but Paul said I've chosen not to be married now it wasn't Paul was laying down a pattern for everybody else to follow he's just speaking of the sacrifice that he himself had made now where did Paul get this kind of an example he got it from the Lord Jesus because when God became one of us he lived Beyond his own Duty his duty was to come down remember the prophet said his whole purpose was to redeem you and I but he lived beyond the purpose of redemption when he stood in Pilot's off he said for this purpose have I come is that right to bear witness unto the life but he lived Beyond it he ministered healing to those in the Physical Realm emotional realm spiritual realm he even took about and cared for those who did not even have necessities to eat he lived Beyond his own Duty now he could have no notice God could have just simply said look I don't got time for that I'm here just to be the sacrifice I don't got time for that you're hungry get a job go to work I mean you you come out here you came out here in in a meeting like this and didn't even bring something to eat aren't you glad that God's not a lecturer like some of us are aren't you glad that when we when something has been done wrong that he doesn't line it up and and oh it should have been done this way but you know what God doesn't expect you to be perfect cuz there ain't no way you can be perfect but God himself comes to minister to our needs not to lecture us on these different things but listen friends within all of this he lived Beyond his own Duty that was eternal life amen let me just say this to you this very thing right here on display it's the message on display this is not Sunday school this is the message on display so as a matter of fact when I was down there in Jeffersonville and talking just with some of them around within the city you know what the Catholics loved brother brandham go figure that one out they loved him in in Jeffersonville they loved him in the surrounding Community he he stood for the word of God but they had such a love and a respect for him you know even the testimonies that would go around remember even the some of the stuff where different ones have said this about the bridge and whatever more and voice of God Brother Joseph and them went and they interviewed that one mayor vissing you can see it on online he talks about how his daddy and grandfather and things like that he begins to break all that down about the bridge and how you know there were just people falling in the cement pisters where they were pouring them I mean they didn't stop because if you stop the job to ride everything up it stopped the progress on the bridge that's why there's no records of people dying from off the bridge but he would write this or actually express it he said bill brandham was the kind of person he said he when he went and hunted bear he would take bare meat to the neighbors and to the people in the community that were in need not just to people who were of the brandom Tabernacle although that would have been a great blessing too yeah right I mean that would have been tremendous just that alone now understand I'm not I'm not here God's not bringing a word to make everybody spiritual philanthropist that's not what this is about it's about what God has called us to do and will test us to live beyond our own Duty come on sometimes we've already been tested within this to live beyond our own Duty we're tested sometimes within these things now watch brother Bram says this he says we want to do something beyond our duty if you are really born again of the spirit of God and say well it's my duty to go to church I guess I have to oh my I want to do more than that I want to win some souls for Christ I want to do something I want to visit the sick or do something for him it's my duty to preach funerals it's my duty to preach the gospel it's my duty to pray for the sick but let me do something else let me get out and do something where God will honor Me by it so not just do the bare minimum right in other words we have our own little world that we live in and Friends listen I understand the pressures and things that we we have today there things that we have I mean your more and more is not only being required of you out at your work and different things and then you have with family you have so many different things that can be so taxing there can be even with the the amount of spirits that we're dealing with in this hour the present darkness that is around us but listen god listen let me say this to you God did not put us here that we would just be survivors we are we are built to be Overcomers as a matter of fact that God would even recognize in the pergami and age of those who were there in Satan's seat and were living a Victorious overcoming life right at Satan's seat Victorious and God would even call it out in the back in the book of uh uh in the church age of uh to uh um uh the church age of of the batara and how that the darkness was present and brother B says let Satan come with his pressures and how that he would try to stop and and stifle the work of God and he said what's the answer to of the believer to that increased labor and sacrifice to the kingdom of God wow to battle against the oppression of Lady of of of thara same thing with Lady oia and what is it increased service not not wor Works to try to work my way in and oh I'm going to do this to to get no no remember the blood of Calvary has already done that for you and I listen if I don't let me just say it like the prophet said it if I Don't Preach another message I'm saved if I would refuse right now and say Lord I'm done I'm tired I'm I'm done I I I don't want to I don't want to you know lay and study and pray and and then just labor with him this I I'm done I I don't want to I don't want to Pastor I don't want to do that no more now it's one thing for me to say that but if that's not what God has entrusted for me to do then God is entrusted to give me the strength and the leadership that I need that I need for him but you realize it will not have one effect on my my eternal destination it does not change that I'm a son and daughter of God but what will change is if I stand there at the Judgment seat of Christ we all Paul said must stand at the Judgment seat of Christ not the white Throne the Judgment seat of Christ and give an account for the Deeds Done in this body when God will say well I mean you you came to church and you supported you you wouldn't let me use you more you were too self-centered Samuel you you're too you you allow things you didn't even allow others when well God I was I got so discouraged but you didn't allow me to minister encouragement to you Hallelujah you didn't allow it you say is that is that real oh it's very real friends but we're not doing it I listen I me say right now everything that we're doing we're not doing for rewards amen I don't care if I get any reward or not what what the what burns within my heart not just to preach the gospel but to minister to somebody else along the way they may not even darken this church door they might go to another church then and someone along the way at the grocery store or somewhere it doesn't matter as long as I can be of a help to somebody to encourage somebody along the way amen but let me just tell you this right here the Bible says if an Infidel does provide a man who don't provide for his own house is worse than an Infidel you say what does that mean if my focus is outside of what's going on here my focus is wrong I want to be a help to others but this is right here the body of Jesus Christ not just me for every one of us who call this our home church is that right yes woo got quiet but it'd be all right something beyond our own Duty now when we think about that you know it's kind of like even in our Even in our home and in our homes the Bible says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others I mean you know son or daughter my goodness man they can keep keep their room they keep it clean they keep their room clean but when it comes to helping out with the dishes mom's got this dad's got this I know that's a big step the the room clean I know that's a big step but you know even going Beyond well that's not my responsibility I'm not the wife here I'm not the mother here I mean but you see some of those things where we have to that instruction comes of living beyond just our own Duty because marriage itself is living beyond your own Duty right if you try to do that and try try to do that I tell you uh don't try to do that cuz I don't want to be back in that office but that becomes a selfish life because Mar marriage itself is actually the highest form of sacrifice yes right because in order to be United with him he had to give his life completely for you and I right it's it's a sacrificial life it's living beyond duty this is why the prophet did not look at sister meia and say man she's all tore up hey honey I'll be in the recliner cuz I have had a taxing day I am all wore out remember brother BR said he was tired that day he was all wore out he had had people telling him you better listen to me if you don't listen to me God's going to bring that airplane down you're riding on you need to listen to me all this all sorts of nonsense as well as helping out people in need no wonder sister mey was in a nervous wreck with with having people walk through the house like that but he could have went over to his recliner and said you know what I'll see you later just let me know let me know when it's time to put my phone down so I can come and have dinner when you get it ready oh wow yeah woo how do we get here y that's good but see sometimes that going beyond our own duty is sometimes it may not be that you know for goodness sake some of us then our wives don't want us in there helping out cuz it'd be nothing but burnt offerings we'd be offering up they don't want us in there like that but maybe our duty within it would just be to sit there and talk and more than likely as a husband it's just to listen and say my wow oh my dear yes and and just to listen you know how it is because how did we get here because you know even with men men it's like 10,000 words a day women 30,000 words a day some maybe a little bit more and you know sometimes our 10,000 words we gave them all out within the first hour a couple hours of the day we're actually having to borrow words but sometimes living beyond our own duty is just our presence being right there so brother Brenham didn't pull that card and say I'll be in there he got him on an apron he lived Beyond his own Duty hallelujah oh my oh that that dish so it bothers my hands have her buy you some that'll soften it and soften your heart soften your attitude my goodness goodness gracious oh my so notice look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others friends I believe with all my heart I I can tell you from experience this is a challenge it's a challenge it's and God's not asking you and I in this scripture to go around and say now sister rosan I want you to tell me all your needs right now then go to the next person we got a great stopad and we've went around like from cubicle to cubicle and we've got everything wrote down that's not it at all the prophet actually tells us in this way it just living so close to Christ to where that sensitivity when there's a need because God is not expecting us to gang pile on somebody altogether but it might be you ministering to somebody else and you ministering to somebody else as the body itself ministering one to another right ameno my my my now notice this here I I know I got I got to keep on moving here so when we look at this brother randam you know he would he would make this statement he says you know many times he said you know he said like Elizabeth and Mary he said when they ran out and they begin to greet one another hug one another like women used to do they'd meet one another smile and be friendly he said I tell you that's a whole lot the matter with the people today they're not friendly like they used to be the people has got too selfish got to a place where they think they live in a little world by themselves you know he said that's the truth brother BR said we used to be able to go to the farm next door and borrow $50 if we ran tight he said now he said you got to have a written contract I mean in today's economy you got to have a a written contract for a dollar you know promised note but notice consider within this the life of the Lord Jesus and you know let me just kind of move through here a couple places in the scripture in first in First Peter chapter 4 Peter would write like this the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins right I don't know about you but I could use more of the love of God I could I need more of the love of God cuz this whole thing of fervent charity means the forgiving of offenses of one another God let the love of God be so great in our lives to where it doesn't stick on our lives because we are members one of of another listen friends there you can't you can't talk those things out it's got to come from in his presence his presence is what sweetens you and I as we will surrender ourselves to him now with that being said with being fervent in charity brother Ram says use or not brother Ram but Peter says use h Hospitality one to another without grudging oh my let me get to that in a minute as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God now let me read this here in layman's terms Amplified it says practice Hospitality to one another those of the household of faith be hospitable be a lover of strangers with brotherly affection for the unknown guest the foreigners the poor and all others who come your way who are of Christ's body and your part or my part might be simply a little bit greater within this area of what God has gifted us to be now I I tell you every one of us we've all got challenges and God works with us in such certain ways isn't it just incredible that God does not take your temperament if it's not so so fitted for certain things and make you the door greeter and but yet he'll still work on your life he'll still mold and shape your life right I mean cuz God I mean think about it brother Carlos was out there at the door and and you coming in to say hey how come I ain't how come I ain't seen you last Sunday what's going on here you know I ain't seen you for a month you got the Holy Ghost I wonder how many people would be in here right there at the door they would be thinking dear God is this truck here today let me see is that Marine sign in yeah he's dug in the bay buddy he's waiting on you he's ready to throw some personal grenad your way you know to kind of welcome you ain't it incredible but yet listen God in fitted everybody to that now you might think that's something like a little iial task that oh you know Brother Carlos just out there greeting this he don't know at all that I was going to say this and neither did I but you know what you might think that's a little thing that's out there but let me tell you something that very thing out there is so necessary it's so necessary of greeting the people of God when they come in the door and welcome them to the house of God come on friends to welcome one another I thank God that there's a welcoming and a Warmness even in that right there because sometimes when we come in here that's the first smiling face and encouraging word that we have received and God works through that part of the body Brother Carlos ain't demanded hey I want to do this and hey I want to do that I need to do this he stands right there by that door and he welcomes you when you come [Music] in and who even act like some of you know how to speak Spanish when you don't your Patron you right don't laugh at that one Brother Carlos I don't want to get in trouble on that now notice this it says be Hospital be lovers I already read that part and in each instance do it ungrudgingly cordially graciously without complaining but as representing him as each of you have received a gift a particular spiritual Talent a gracious Divine endowment employ it for one another as it befits good Trustees of God's many sided Grace that was just one side of God's grace but I read some others to you testifying singing specials right Min ministering to one another but notice even in this part of using Hospitality wow without grudging in other words being true like brother Aaron would y'all like to come over on Sunday don't don't answer that man just this is just example would y'all like to come over for Sunday it's Apple time man Apple Cris would y'all like to come over sister Rosanne y'all y'all come on over on Sunday and then all of a sudden after I get home it's like why in the world did I do that but it's grudgingly oh it's not outward ly it's grudgingly see it's not attributed to our account when it's done grudgingly but it's seeing the Need You Realize friends listen I I know I I'm just I'm just preaching from my heart you know it's incredible how at times that I found out that I was criticized for having not not here not here not here not here among the the people here right now and things like that criticized for having Fellowship dinners but you know what it was a misapplication of quotes it shows you why some people they and all of us need a pastor right not our own Pastor not shepher ourselves among but we need the leadership of the holy spirit because having a fellowship dinner is not what the prophet called soup suffers that was social events that had no merit whatsoever to pay a preacher but if the prophet of God was so against it why would he encourage it even in the message Shalom I see you've brought something for lunch to sit down and have lunch with one another oh how that Thrills my heart hallu what's the objective well I'll tell you there's times where we get down as even in the fellowship dinner to be able to talk with one another be able to you know to minister to one another it didn't mean that we've got to sit down and quote quotes with one another in scriptures if those if that all comes about that's fine but sometimes it doesn't bother me a bit if some of your your you know your children come in here maybe they're not even serving the lord maybe they wouldn't even darken these doors right now but it might be the grace of God even through that moment and that time that would make contact with their lives amen is that right listen friends sometimes people have been so church burned preacher burnt and religious burnt and everything else they need to see it's not religion this is a life Hallelujah that don't bother you don't bother me a bit don't bother me a bit at all now employ these various talents that's what we want to do sometimes the talents and things that God gives us is not what we would actually as I said we sometimes don't see the value or we look at it as being insufficient you know when God would give the vision to Moses about the Tabernacle and he said let the people make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them God had men that were filled with the spirit of wisdom that would be able to U work with the medals and things like that they would be able to teach others others would learn but then you know what there was also different ones of the women who were able to spin goat's hair they were able to do certain things that maybe they didn't have maybe the certain thread that somebody else had they didn't have the black onx Stones it didn't matter what they had God knew what they had and it was needed just as much as anybody that would have had the gold or the silver because what it was going to do is come together to make a Dwelling Place for God that's what we want we want to surrender Lord I Surrender what what little talent I have I want to surrender it into your hands that you might have a Dwelling Place a place to be able to move and to work through think about this woman how many youever heard the the the of the sister in the scripture named Tabitha or also known as as Dorcas right in the scripture and the Bible tells us that here you know she had gotten very sick in verse 36 it's says that at japa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and arms Deeds which she did right now she didn't preach couldn't right sisters can't preach right Paul said I suffer not a woman to teach or assert authority over a man that's right is that right right she couldn't do that I would I wonder would would sister Dorcas or Tabitha I wonder if she was even one that says I you know what I I I can't give a testimony in front of everybody I I just I'm not not able to do that she wasn't able to do it didn't means she didn't have testimonies to give somehow or another those testimonies got out but and God had there was a special gift within her life she had good works meaning that there was an expression of her faith of that faith in her life but there's also noted this the arms Deeds charitable things that she did now you know Tabitha wasn't sitting around with you know a tripod that was readed and had a big bucket in the bottom and ringing a bell outside of Walmart that's not the kind of arms deed she was doing she won the first Salvation Army she was doing arms Deeds but nobody you would not it was not something that was publicized she didn't have her own little Etsy shop or her own little Instagram post of of here is darkas that does Deeds charitable for all you didn't know but notice when she passes on and she's sick and she passes on when Peter comes in verse 39 when he comes in there they're the all those that are gathered they're weeping and man they're sad Peter has to put them all out but what they're actually holding on when they when they came up there the Bible says at the end of that verse showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them it may not have seemed like some great spiritual thing but she was moved by her heart and the talents that God gave her was the ability to make coats make garments and she was able to do that for the body of Christ and there were many people who were warmed because of her taking notice Beyond her own self that's pretty incredible isn't it if this wasn't important I don't reckon this would be in the Bible if it wasn't important God would just you know this s in there but sometimes you know what it is we need to be admonished brother R says it like this remember when he talks about little Edith right she'd got to a place and how that God never did you know heal her of intile paralysis but God did relieve her pain until you know just like about a year year and a half of before she passed on but she came into the time of menopause brother Brown tells about it in the message indictment and he says you know he says within that he said she's come to such a place he said oh she she looks bad she she don't look too good he said but listen he said why don't I think he said I think it would be good if you all would make a trip down there maybe even the sister Tabernacles oh Lord you mean it's not us for no more but remember friends if our focus is be more let me just B brother Nathaniel's church if my focus is more on helping out at brother Nathaniel's church I've got the wrong Focus but I want to be of help if there's somebody over there different ones I know going through surgery and things like that praying for them checking on them and things like that maybe you know something that maybe we're a little closer to or whatever more sure we want to be a help if we can take a meal to him absolutely we want to be a help but notice our focus is right here but sometimes Our Lives can get to such a place to where it's just like we're on oneway track I wonder this arms Deeds I wonder if that'd kind of be equivalent to like when someone's sick and getting meals together well brother time that don't seem too spiritual well it was reckoned to God to to her account and a matter of fact when the prophet of God stood there and his wife had that growth on her on in there in her female organs remember what he put before God he never said Lord you know my wife she reads how many of my message books a day she reads x amount of chapters Lord she listens to so much gospel music he never said one thing about that he said Lord she irons my clothes for me she cooks my meals when I come home and I'm all worked up after a meeting she lets me and has my hunting clothes ready for me to go hunting he says and brother Bram stops and he says and you sisters wonder how you can serve the Lord how you serve your husbands brother Samuel that's not very deep well yes it is you see first of all is our position in Jesus Christ as a spirit filled son and daughter of God is that right but as the prophet would lay it over and over in the adoption that in God's economy there are so many positions and he said to think in God's economy a housewife a preacher a pastor a factory worker see God living out himself through a positioned son and daughter of God in what God has called them to do right sometimes I wonder if we don't complain too much in where God has us instead of saying Lord what would you have me do right where I'm at cuz there's obviously you don't make no mistakes Lord I know I can made them I've made many mistakes but what would you have me to do right where I'm at Lord oh my you love him my let me just let me try to get get to a point here I'm skipping an awful lot some of you are like some you're probably thinking that's a help then I'm not trying to be a help like that but I want to just I want to just bring this to us here in this way let me bring this down just within this point seasons change in our lives I realize that if God carries I don't know when but when God carries somebody else will be standing here somebody else will be the pastor I'm not putting in my resignation I'm just I'm just saying I realize and sometimes I know that it's what's difficult sometimes is when seasons and chapters of our lives change it's hard to see the purpose of God still in our lives sometimes that's the hardest thing I remember when brother John lefon when he stepped away and he retired you know Sister um Loretta just couldn't couldn't go on and brother John really kept a incredible schedule there in Arkansas and and for health reasons that that part of for her he he they stepped aside and you know that was one thing that brother John he he did he kind of you know it really kind of struggled with that part because you're used to going and going and going and brother John told me he said I love being a pastor I love being a pastor I I know what he's saying but you know he come to a spot where you're used to just you know you're kind of like used to that lane and that vein and then you think what do I do now what do I do now I talked a little bit about that to brother roel Sorano one time and brother roel said man I ain't even thought of that he said I didn't think of that I know it's not something we sat around and want to think but we know it's something that sometimes is true that seasons can change but what are we going to do when seasons change for some of us seasons have seasons will change but you know what just because seasons change does not mean that your purpose has been minimized it's not minimized there's things that I knew that even as my dad and I didn't I kept things from my dad I didn't didn't share things with him I just took the burden um and I just you know I didn't go around with the needs and things like that but you know what that gift of a pastor was still there in his life and the years on down the road he could just tell me at different times I know this and I know that and I know that how the gift is there God drops the burden and that that gift is there so it didn't mean now it didn't mean that he had to go and then take over in that spot but you know what he did he prayed he realized season had changed but it was a big help in prayer let me read this in closing pray this would be a help to you this this particular scripture has always been a great blessing to my heart epais Paul writes of him first of all in opening chapter of Colossians refers to him as a fellow prisoner in the book of Fon also in the book of Philippians he's one that took supplies to Paul from the Philippian from from the colossian uh uh people and Philippian people but notice what he says epais sometimes you'll read it epaphroditus but it's the same person who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you always laboring fervently for you in prayers now where he was at he wasn't preaching anymore opening chapter of Colossians he was known as a faithful Minister but now that part of his life had changed right but now where he's at he's laboring as a priest in interceding on behalf of the people he's seeing that there's a need for you know even of maturing but notice notice how he takes this in his position in being able to do this no doubt he could have not have effectively done this as great maybe before as right now but he's been able to labor he's been able to see he's been now he's taking into account and he realizes the greatest thing that he can do for the people of God where he's at right now is to pray for him he might be a prisoner but it's not going to stop him from praying for God's people that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God for I bear him record that he hath a great Zeal for you and them that are in ladyo IA and them in herius think of this what about what about our season something changes it doesn't stop what that labor and that desire is for the body certain things can can change but may God help us if everything out of this that we can pull out and there was so many more things but God give us Grace to live beyond our own Duty I want to live beyond I don't you you you know it's like when they give you the job description when you go to work they sit down they hand you the job description actually it's way more than what's wrote there you can do what's right there but really to be effective you'll start recognizing it's more than that you don't stand on that job description say let me see just say uh if there is a needle that falls on the floor here in the patients room uh you do not pick that up you wait for the nurse Tech to do that oh you think what am is this Union or what I mean you're reading on but you realize sometimes you know what you see it you pick it up right it's like a piece of paper on the floor I wait for the janitor to get it this is our church this isn't the janitor or a janitor's church this is our church right this is our building that that's how we have to look at it the prophet said we're to look at it you make it your church this is the brownings church this is your your church if God carries it may not be a Browning standing here it's not a Browning's church it's God what God started the church it's our church we each have our part within this but it's collectively together right right you love him still love me yes yes nobody don't pull your tomatoes out now but God give us Grace to live beyond our own Duty that's what I that's my desire that quote when brother B says my duty to preach funerals my duty to to minister my duty all those things it's my duty but God I want to go I want to live beyond that help me to see help me to be sensitive Lord I'm not we're not trying you're not trying to work your way into heaven gra Grace of God's already been extended to you but you know what it is is I want to do something even beyond what you've called me to do Lord I I want to go I want to go be on a me pushing or pulling but help me to be sensitive maybe it's like Dorcas making you know goat coats and and garments maybe it's something in that way maybe it's you know being to we that when all of a sudden man when somebody you're you're aware someone's sick maybe you're you're praying for them you're sending them a text or maybe as coming together when you hear of this right here it's coming together to maybe to get meals together or you know a gift card or whatever more now listen friends we all want that kind of a treatment when we feel that way is that right why we got quiet in here do I need to open up the rest of these slides but listen this is a part do you realize this is a part even when Paul stood in one place he told him when they brought to Paul in prison heas brought him certain things that was needed and yet Paul himself was not begging for it but Paul writes in the book of Philippians he said the reason that I've done it is not so much a desire for my want or my need to be met but that you might fruit might abound in your life the need was put out there to see is they going to be a response and God ministered through the hearts of those people you know what they were actually doing it was an expression of Christ through their life of even the gospel that they'd received you say oh brother Samuel that ain't very deep James said pure religion undefiled is to visit visit the F the the fatherless those and the widows that are widows indeed and also to live an undefiled life I say God help us live beyond our own needs help us I I know you understand God's not trying to tax us that's not that's not what this that's not what this this this ministry and the words about it's not trying to tax us and where we leave out of here oh I got to it's not at all just just be sensitive to him and say Lord help me to be more sensitive to my surroundings help me to be more sensitive to the needs help me to be more inclined to that it's a battle in this age but you know what God has given us what's needed as we can stay in his presence to help us to be sensitive to minister to the needs of one another and let me tell you something it's it's unlimited what God will do Among Us just in these simple expressions of care you say what would that do that's love being expressed and then you get a people working together where the love of God's being expressed and it's moving throughout the body you know what it does the atmospheres begin to break down it's a it's it's that which begins to create a place for the Holy Spirit the dove of God just to come right in and set down right among us and continue to work in a greater way you don't you love him amen and said Simplicity help us Lord let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father thank you Lord for your mercy tonight Lord I can certainly Lord with from the depths of my heart I can say Lord I there's more Lord there's more Lord God help us to be sensitive Lord that we can live beyond our duty Lord I don't want to just Lord is serving you as just something Lord that where it becomes just doing well that's just what I'm supposed to do Lord I realize here that there's come sometimes Lord I'm not to do it too much but there's sometimes Lord where maybe our song leaders have been out in different places few different times over the years where I've had to come out here and Lead songs and then preach I don't mind it Lord it may not be the most convenient thing because of what I have to look at to study to reflect over to just meditate in them last moments but you know Lord you've never failed just I've only had to do it a few times I think about Lord my good friend brother Nathan Bryan he has to do it many times over yet he Lord God is a congregation much much larger but yet a few song leaders sometimes Lord with the different things and they're in different places but that's just one small example Lord but you know father I think right here in this in this little group this Gathering that you have brought us together never forget Lord when we had that that little time was had for sister Sharon and her and brother brother Joshua Lord is he brought her back here Lord to home Lord there was so many different things that I remember when her dad greeted me on the phone but the just way would interpret between us and Lord God God of how that is so overwhelmed them of the expression of love from the gifts from Lord God the special times that we just had for them it overwhelmed them her father there's another Minister there with them at the time they were just so overwhelmed said that's that's so opposite of what we've heard of things about America Lord it just speaks Lord in this this time we we are Americans that's true but oh God before we are Americans we're Christians that might be the country Lord that we're from I'm I'm grateful Lord to to live here but I'm so thankful this is not my home I'm glad it's not my Final Destination amen Lord God how we thank you Lord for the Constitution all those things that men those were men that were Lord God moved moved upon to where even they would set many of them who were the original Founders they would have a chair at the end of the table for the Lord Jesus to be present when they would write those things Senators congressmen the reason public education came about was not to make people smart it was the firm belief as they would read the McGuffy reader it was with the firm belief that if men would read in the scriptures and Avail them lives being able to be taught to read and read the scriptures there'd be no need for the police force that was the reason for public education how far it is Fallen Lord God but father I'm thankful that we've received the spirit from that land of our rebirth where Paul would write our conversation is from above for he shall change our vile bodies that conversation that he writes there is that constit ution that comes from that land above Lord your Prophet would speak of this over and over about how that Brotherly Love was ceasing how that he said we wouldn't even know if the neighbor died we wouldn't even know he said used to be when somebody got down we'd go over and chop wood for them he said what's happened it's ceasing natural affection is ceasing he would say it countless times now Lord it wasn't something that the prophet was trying to hold some seminar and try to make us better people as far as to do this and do that but he's letting us know you get closer and deeper in the love of God don't don't let the things and the cares of this world don't let it saturate your life but in the things that you have to do let your life be saturated with the love of God because Lord character is more than a match for the God of this evil age the God of this evil age that would exalt itself to the throne of worship in man but yet the character of Jesus Christ coming on full display in a bride body that would exalt the Lamb of God the one who lived Beyond his own Duty Lord Jesus if in the scriptures your Prophet would pick it up in that day on Calvary and he would tell the church I want you to notice one thing he said very carefully when he as as a Shepherd which separate as it were sheep from the goats your Prophet told us at that time that sheep that spoke out there in Matthew is actually the foolish virgin but yet would live in such a way that he would brother BR would bring that down into our lives and say I want you to notice when the rewards were commended to them I was hungry and you fed me I was naked and you clothed me when I was thirsty you gave me a drink of water and he would call brandom Tabernacle to notice that how it was something he said that was just lived out so automatically through their lives Lord and see we would read on down there in the paragraph the very thing that the prophet would draw us to is our walk with you Lord our walk with you I wonder sometimes Lord when we stop and evaluate on this I wonder if we're really walking as deep as we think we're walking Lord myself included in that I wonder I wonder Lord if we are not just so allowing Lord of this world CU it's a spirit of this age out here this the spirit of this age we see it all around it's even come out in expressive movements think about it even those that would stream this service tonight they do it on YouTube it's a time lord of self self-gratification self men shall be lovers of themselves that's the spirit of this age [Music] Lord and I know Lord I'm I'm not speaking to Lord God to people of the world tonight I'm speaking to my brothers and sisters we're not walking around and snapping selfies of oursel constantly and looking just oh elevating oursel but sometimes Lord we just get caught in our own little world we don't mean to Father you know that we don't mean to I ask you to forgive us Lord forgive us Lord May there come a fresh anointing Upon Our Lives Lord God is it would be prayed in that opening prayer where Lord God would be said as I've read it to him Lord a few Services now let us be so Anointed with his spirit that we could go to one another in the deepness of Trials and troubles and begin to give his sympathy to our brothers and sisters as he pours it through through our lives help us Lord help us you're not trying Lord to lay more on us you're not trying to change the job description that's not at all you're just trying to Lord to help us to see a son my daughter don't get caught in your own little [Music] world but just be sensitive just and staying in my presence looking to me Lord how what would you have me to do let me not look even at what you youve called me to do is something that's insufficient it's what good is this part oh that probably won't make no difference I wonder if Tabatha didn't think that in the scripture wonder if she didn't have to battle through that but oh God I know that there were some who were there who were warmed by what she had given them and you raised her back to life oh God help us Lord help us start right here with me start right here with me Lord right here with me oh God help me Lord to live beyond my own Duty not just my duty to study that's part of it Lord to preach but God help me to live beyond that Lord help me to be sensitive to be mindful help me not to step over things Lord that you're asking and drawing my attention to oh God help me Lord help us as a people Lord forgive us Lord God lord you know father we are but flesh that's why you would speak to us and remind us Lord to me it's a Marvel how you would speak and encourage Us in this and then you'll turn right around you're the one who helps us to be sensitive to see a need or someone that we can Minister Lord God you'll give us the grace to do it and then you'll turn right around and reward us and it wasn't even us that caught it it wasn't us Lord oh God help us to be sensitive Lord oh Lord Jesus you have placed right here in this local body so much talent Lord Lord God not just something of music but talents may we not take our talent and bury it but may we take Lord that talent that gift that's been bestowed into our lives help us Lord to use it by yielding ourselves to you Lord help us father help us Lord oh I love you Lord I love you Lord Jesus I love you Lord I appreciate Lord God how that you've gone beyond your [Music] duty you know as I told you the other day when I was walking through here and praying Lord there's been many times I look and all I see is one set of FO friends cuz there's been many times you've carried me I'm so glad Lord I'm so thankful some of the ways Lord that you've carried me is right through the prayers of brothers and sisters sometimes Lord God of things Lord of just certain encouraging texts that's come my way sometimes Lord just just little tokens Here There and Lord likewise likewise Lord I look at things Lord like that in those measures Lord you know just how to encourage us I pray father let me be Lord if I can be a fraction of what others have been to me let me just Lord God granted I pray help me Lord help us as a people hallelujah anybody else feel that way tonight Lord I Surrender the talent in my life Grant it Lord you see father beneath the hands of your children you see Lord in each of Our Lives we give to you Lord Sanctified to your purpose and your calling granted Lord by your

church here and we were saying about the the the ones that the Lord said come you bless to my father for I was sick and in prison you visit me and and and brother brandom said he said look at these sheep they said Lord when did you visit when did we visit you when did we do these things he said in so much as you've done it to my little ones you've done it unto me and he said to the others said
