[31:41] ourselves to you now Lord for your glory
[31:44] Lord that you would lead us Lord tonight
[31:46] we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[31:49] amen I want to just start reading and
[31:53] Deuteronomy 9 and I'd like to just begin
[31:56] reading at verse 23
[32:02] Moses is making known of this to the new
[32:08] generation of what had taken place when
[32:12] the older those older ones and then
[32:16] throughout the journey of where they've
[32:18] come to at this point remember what
[32:22] we've been looking at Israel is at the
[32:24] point and at the place of crossing over
[32:26] and Moses is not only directing them
[32:29] with counsel going into the land but
[32:31] he's also reminding them of God's
[32:35] covenant throughout the whole journey
[32:38] and I believe that's important so we
[32:42] look here in verse 23 here Moses breaks
[32:44] in on this and he lets them know
[32:46] likewise when the Lord sent you from
[32:49] Kadesh Barnea saying go up and possess
[32:53] the land which I have given you
[32:55] then ye rebelled against the commandment
[32:58] of the Lord your God and you believed
[33:00] him not nor hearkened to his voice you
[33:04] have rebelled against the Lord from the
[33:07] day that I knew you
[33:08] thus I fell down before the Lord forty
[33:12] days and forty nights as I fell down at
[33:15] the first now I want you to catch what's
[33:17] just been said here I'm not gonna have
[33:20] you standing long I know it's been a
[33:21] week
[33:22] but notice what it says in verse 24
[33:26] ye have been rebellious against the Lord
[33:30] from the day that I knew you
[33:32] thus I fell down before the Lord forty
[33:37] days and forty nights as I fell down at
[33:40] the first because the Lord had said he
[33:43] would destroy you I wonder how much
[33:49] within the humanity this would be
[33:53] possible it's not it's not humanly
[33:57] possible it's something that goes
[33:59] completely against human nature so there
[34:02] has to be a greater nature over human
[34:06] nature in Moses right now because he
[34:12] speaks out that you've been rebellious
[34:14] since the day that I knew you but thus I
[34:16] went and prayed for you
[34:19] I prayed therefore and oh my look at
[34:22] this
[34:22] I prayed therefore unto the Lord and
[34:25] said O Lord God destroy not thy people
[34:29] and thine inheritance which thou has
[34:33] redeemed through thy greatness which
[34:36] thou has brought forth out of Egypt with
[34:39] a mighty hand remember thy servants
[34:44] Abraham Isaac and Jacob look not unto
[34:50] the stubbornness of this people nor to
[34:52] their wickedness nor to their sin so
[34:55] notice what's taking place here this
[34:58] inside of Moses this intercessory he's
[35:01] turning the very eyes of God from the
[35:04] stubbornness from the wickedness and
[35:06] he's turning God's eyes to the promise
[35:10] which is veiled in Moses life and he is
[35:15] a part of it
[35:17] look at this lest the land wench whence
[35:20] thou broughtest out say because the Lord
[35:24] was not able to bring them into the land
[35:26] which he promised them and because he
[35:28] hated them he hath brought them out to
[35:30] slay them in the wilderness
[35:33] yet they are thy people and dine
[35:37] inheritance which thou broughtest
[35:39] out by thy mighty power and by thy
[35:43] stretched out arm may God bless you
[35:46] bless the reading of his word you may be
[35:49] seated
[35:54] I'd like to speak to you on a thought
[35:59] intercession according to the promise
[36:04] you know when we look at this with
[36:09] intercession for intercession itself to
[36:15] take place it is for one that would
[36:18] intercede which would be to intervene on
[36:21] the behalf of someone else and the real
[36:28] reality is it is that there's no way
[36:32] that one could actually be able to stand
[36:37] and to intercede unless they themselves
[36:40] were one with the promise and with the
[36:46] Lord who made the promise because
[36:49] outside of that there's no power there's
[36:52] no ability to intercede but when one is
[36:55] is united with the Lord and United with
[37:00] him and the promise of his word then it
[37:03] is a life of intercession that works
[37:05] then according to the promise and I look
[37:09] at this that how Moses himself these
[37:11] words that we read across here that in
[37:15] every in every aspect of the prayer in
[37:18] the intercession that's offered up
[37:21] intercession itself it is according to
[37:24] the promised word intercession is not
[37:28] just saying bless the people Lord
[37:32] intercession is not saying Lord they're
[37:35] good people that in itself is not
[37:38] intercession but intercession must
[37:41] operate and it is true intercession is
[37:44] according to the promise
[37:46] so when we look at that the thing that
[37:48] that same spirit of Christ that in inner
[37:51] sight interceded in Moses according to
[37:54] the spirit of promise and then if we can
[37:56] think back to even that same spirit of
[37:59] God when Moses came down from the
[38:03] mountain there was judgment that came
[38:06] upon those who had actually sinned
[38:11] against the Lord because God had told
[38:13] Moses he said I will not blot out but
[38:17] those that have sinned against me and so
[38:21] to know that when we think of an in this
[38:23] terms and I don't want to get too deep
[38:25] in this year but to recognize when we
[38:28] look at the Lamb's Book of Life there's
[38:31] not a name that can be added nor removed
[38:34] from the Lamb's Book of Life but because
[38:38] of the fall that took place there in
[38:40] Eden we not only find there to be the
[38:44] Lamb section but we find the book of
[38:46] life there's many lives that would have
[38:49] never even been upon the earth if there
[38:51] had not have come a fall in the
[38:54] beginning but there's many people that
[38:57] would be born upon this earth that dole
[38:59] they would not be of the elect but there
[39:02] would be those who would desire to be
[39:05] saved they would never have the the
[39:08] ability by by election in formation of
[39:11] God to understand God's program to
[39:14] because they were not a part of God but
[39:17] yet they would look to the Lord and God
[39:19] would save them that's happened with in
[39:22] every generation in each of these plans
[39:25] we'll look at a few examples tonight if
[39:27] the Lord help us but then you have
[39:28] others whose names they were never on
[39:31] the book of life then you had names that
[39:34] were wrote on the book of life but
[39:36] because they stood against the Living
[39:39] God
[39:39] their names were removed remember even
[39:43] God broader revising there will be a
[39:46] final revision of the role you know
[39:49] after after ever all the events have
[39:52] climax there'll be a revision and to
[39:54] think of how that God he has he is so
[39:57] placed it and this is where I want your
[39:59] to be that what God has ordained within
[40:02] his word it's going to be there is some
[40:05] there is nothing that can stop God's
[40:08] Word from coming to pass we know it has
[40:12] to be God to bring it to pass and God
[40:14] Himself is the one who gave the word and
[40:17] he fulfills the word and to think of
[40:20] this intercession that was moving within
[40:23] the heart of Moses I want to just say it
[40:26] like this that you know the Spirit of
[40:28] Christ the life of that promise what was
[40:31] once a promise that was there it had
[40:34] been rehearsed as a promised and they
[40:36] were down in Egypt and it was being
[40:38] rehearsed as a promise
[40:39] God made a promise to Abraham it kept on
[40:42] rehearsing it but when the day came that
[40:45] God made a visitation there and came
[40:48] time to fulfill that promise it was no
[40:51] longer putting that promise off to a
[40:53] future date but it was a declaration
[40:56] that God who made that promise has now
[40:59] on the scene to fulfill that promise and
[41:02] let me just say it like this God in this
[41:04] age has not come to make promises God
[41:08] has come in this hour to fulfill
[41:10] promises but they have looked for the
[41:14] rapture and the coming of the Lord the
[41:16] Church of the Living God like as we
[41:18] mentioned on Sunday they moved with
[41:20] urgency looking for this promise
[41:23] believing that they would see it in
[41:26] their generation by being a part of it
[41:29] through the new birth but yet to
[41:31] recognize that there were many in lives
[41:33] that were laid all the way down within
[41:36] this great Lamb's Book of Life that he
[41:39] himself would have to thoroughly redeem
[41:42] waiting on you and I to come on the
[41:44] scene and our names to be splashed in
[41:47] that Clorox bleach and to think of it of
[41:49] how that within the midst of this time
[41:51] there is an intercession that's
[41:53] according to the promise Moses in this
[41:56] he wasn't asking God Lord just look over
[41:59] their sin and and keep going on I want
[42:02] you to remember every time that when the
[42:05] Israel themselves rose up here the
[42:08] previous on the golden calf and on and
[42:10] on their repeat
[42:11] who died instantly are you with me there
[42:16] were lives that were that were died
[42:18] there because they had sinned against
[42:21] the Lord and then in this case were
[42:23] those who had brought up an evil report
[42:25] they died right there right there as God
[42:29] spoke in the camp then you had many
[42:31] others who went along with what was said
[42:33] and they they came to their death as God
[42:36] said I will not allow them to enter into
[42:38] the land but this is my point that I
[42:40] want to draw you to this intercession
[42:42] and to think how that God himself had
[42:45] brought him out by way of a promise but
[42:47] thank God that God had by way as a
[42:51] pillar of fire he had a heart that that
[42:54] heart was so yoked to the promise of God
[42:57] where Moses himself would stand there
[43:00] not as a natural man but he would stand
[43:03] there where a promise had so taken ahold
[43:06] of his heart be that promise you
[43:08] couldn't have separated Moses from that
[43:12] promise that promise was Christ revealed
[43:15] to Moses in Moses and through Moses it
[43:18] was simplicity right there you realize
[43:20] when the promise is you are united with
[43:23] that promise it would be easier for
[43:25] someone to separate the bone in the
[43:28] muscle and everything from you but you
[43:30] are unable to be separated from the
[43:33] promise because you are always a part of
[43:36] that promise we were always a part of
[43:38] that word but the Spirit of God comes
[43:41] down to you and I and makes known that
[43:44] hey I interceded for you before you knew
[43:47] anything about it and I've already made
[43:50] a way for you thank God for the Spirit
[43:54] of intercession thankfully God had a
[44:00] prisoner that wasn't that was a prisoner
[44:04] to his will not his own will his own
[44:08] will it would have been easier for Moses
[44:11] to wipe his hands and say I'm through
[44:13] with it they spoke against you they
[44:16] spoke against me this had to be
[44:20] something bigger than flesh of Moses you
[44:24] know what God was so
[44:25] here with the heart that is full of love
[44:28] and intercession it will stand for God's
[44:31] Word knowing that God cannot fail
[44:37] you couldn't have bat Moses off of this
[44:39] promise this was not the same Moses who
[44:43] when he rose up and slew an Egyptian and
[44:45] then something his brothers said wow
[44:47] you're gonna do the same thing to us and
[44:49] he took out of there and ran he
[44:51] separated himself he went off and
[44:53] noticed he forgot all about the promise
[44:56] he became occupied with sheep raising he
[45:00] lost his vision as the prophet told us
[45:02] but this time you were not going to get
[45:04] Moses away from it because it wasn't
[45:07] something of his intellect it was
[45:09] something that was already sowed in his
[45:11] heart and now the same God that had
[45:14] sewed it in his heart had brought it to
[45:16] a reality this was not Moses acting out
[45:19] this was the Spirit of Christ acting
[45:22] through Moses on behalf of his word Who
[45:30] am I who you see here intercession on
[45:34] behalf of the people forgiveness and
[45:37] mercy was about the promise the
[45:43] fulfillment it's about the fulfillment
[45:45] of the promise this intercession was
[45:49] about the promised God and made it one
[45:51] about pity but it was according to the
[45:56] word I believe we can take a look good
[45:59] lesson here that our prayers should be
[46:03] according to the word not just bless
[46:07] them Lord let him keep going to know but
[46:10] it ought to be prayer according to the
[46:11] word if the word has been revealed to us
[46:14] we ought to have prayer it ought to be
[46:16] an intercession that rises up within us
[46:20] according to the promise that we are
[46:22] born of the Bible even to think you know
[46:27] struttin hearts some months ago in
[46:29] reading of how that Moses would look
[46:32] upon them in the opening chapter of do
[46:34] neurone Deuteronomy 1 and he said you
[46:36] know God said he wouldn't
[46:38] why you and he said he's done it he said
[46:41] the Lord God make you a thousand times
[46:43] more than what you are and bless you as
[46:46] he promised you
[46:47] you see Moses did not look upon the
[46:50] people and just you know just ride it
[46:53] off but Moses knew what God said he
[46:56] won't fail him I look dismal
[46:58] it may look dark but this is God's
[47:01] promise I'll tell you what that's why
[47:04] there's such a need for a uniting with
[47:07] the heart of Christ
[47:08] we don't need uniting with letters we
[47:11] don't need uniting with quotes and
[47:13] prints we need to be united with the God
[47:16] who made the promise and then we've got
[47:18] the heart of God who made the promise
[47:21] pulsating in us
[47:24] you can throw scriptures and quotes
[47:27] around the dime a dozen but if you don't
[47:30] have the heart of God behind it you're
[47:32] thrown around things and placing it here
[47:34] and there and don't even have the right
[47:36] thought and context that's behind it
[47:42] brother Brandon tells us how many times
[47:44] over and over the Lord Jesus cannot
[47:49] intercede on anything other than his
[47:51] word Lord I hope I get better he's still
[47:55] sitting there and he ain't interceding
[47:57] because his promise does not I hope you
[48:01] but if you say Lord by your stripes
[48:05] I'm already heal Bertram said there he
[48:09] is standing as an intercessor shaking
[48:12] his bloody Garnett and declaring it's
[48:16] finished
[48:17] I've interceded for them all of their
[48:19] needs what they have need up you realize
[48:21] a word from you where did that word come
[48:24] from that word has come from the throne
[48:27] of God from the mighty Conqueror himself
[48:30] that you could rise up in the midst of
[48:32] your weakness oh my in the midst and a
[48:35] time when you feel so weak but you can
[48:37] call on him he is the high priest and
[48:40] apostle of our profession
[48:42] [Music]
[48:44] we enter seeds according to his word I
[48:51] break in on this in numbers 14 this
[48:57] particular part that we've read in
[48:59] Deuteronomy and here Moses is before God
[49:03] now mind you this ain't the first time
[49:10] mind you even before they left Egypt the
[49:14] first instance when Moses and Aaron went
[49:19] before Pharaoh and Pharaoh said the
[49:23] tally of their bricks shall not diminish
[49:24] you let them go gather strongly and they
[49:28] came to Moses and said what have you
[49:31] done to us it didn't start in the
[49:35] wilderness it was already there
[49:37] now I'll tell you what any one of us in
[49:40] our natural makeup now I know some of
[49:46] you might have on some of those seven
[49:48] virtues you might have a little bit more
[49:50] spilled naturally in your life than what
[49:52] others of us do but that ain't what
[49:54] we're talking about come on you see it
[50:01] would have taken something more Moses if
[50:04] he ran before he would've ran again but
[50:10] Moses was a part of God he was a part of
[50:14] the promise one time he had eyes and
[50:17] looked out the window and looked upon
[50:18] his brother but now he had eyes that not
[50:21] only seen them as people of the promise
[50:23] but it had become illuminated in his
[50:25] heart that these indeed are the promised
[50:28] people and what God had made it was not
[50:30] a man who made this promise God made the
[50:32] promise and God can't fail the Lord said
[50:38] unto Moses in verse 11 how long will
[50:40] this people provoke me how long will it
[50:43] be ere that they believe me for all the
[50:45] signs which I've showed among them how
[50:47] will smite them with the pestilence and
[50:49] disinherit them and I will make of thee
[50:51] a greater nation and mightier than thee
[50:57] this is second time God has said this
[51:00] they're right and let me just say it
[51:03] like this he's not talking about the the
[51:06] natural genetics of Moses for that
[51:10] promise that was made there is a
[51:12] spiritual seed in whom was in mind when
[51:17] the promise was uttered are you with me
[51:19] in the scripture there in Exodus
[51:22] remember you find I don't say an
[51:24] argument but I want you to find when God
[51:27] told Moses he said bad people
[51:29] he called Multan Moses that people have
[51:32] sinned and you're a Moses said your
[51:35] people
[51:36] you say well who's worthy
[51:38] it was Christ and Christ is God it was
[51:43] Christ there in Moses these are his
[51:46] people
[51:47] Oh glory be to God and Moses said unto
[51:51] the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear
[51:55] it for thou broughtest up this people
[51:57] and I might from among them and they'll
[52:00] tell it to the inhabitants of the land
[52:02] for they have heard that thou Lord art
[52:04] among this people that thou Lord art
[52:07] seen face to face and that that cloud
[52:09] standeth over them and that thou goes
[52:11] before him by daytime in a pillar of
[52:14] cloud and in a pillar of fire by night
[52:15] now if thou shalt kill all this people
[52:18] as one man then the nations which have
[52:21] heard the fame of thee will speak saying
[52:25] because the Lord was not able to bring
[52:29] this people into the land which he sware
[52:30] into them therefore he had slain them in
[52:34] the wilderness and now I beseech thee
[52:37] this this word beseeched is one of
[52:40] prayer and entreaty which and in treaty
[52:45] means to earnestly make a humble request
[52:50] you said Moses is coming before God and
[52:54] he's telling God to reconsider and
[52:57] that's a humble request humility is
[53:00] according to the word come on friends
[53:05] you can find people all around not even
[53:07] believers some people very humble in
[53:10] spirit that ain't no sign the humility
[53:14] is a humility by the word you with me
[53:19] Cain was a humble guy but Cain could not
[53:23] came build a church Cain brought an
[53:25] offering come on now they say my words
[53:27] that's the prophet's word Cain was
[53:29] humble but Cain could not come to the
[53:31] level of humility or the depth that Abel
[53:34] could come to Abel was able to submit
[53:37] himself to the revealed program and will
[53:41] of Almighty God he didn't have to
[53:44] understand why this lamb he didn't have
[53:46] to he knew this is what was been
[53:49] revealed as the provided sacrifice and
[53:51] he went and did it by faith now I
[53:55] beseech thee let the power of my Lord be
[54:00] great well I just love that his power
[54:04] brought him out of Egypt right the blood
[54:06] yeah it was demonstrated bringing them
[54:09] out of the mightiest nation on the earth
[54:11] his power was made manifest his power
[54:15] there at the Red Sea was made manifest
[54:17] and noticed the very Spirit of Christ
[54:20] inside of Moses is interceding let thy
[54:23] power be great let me just say this to
[54:25] you right now we sing that song Amazing
[54:27] Grace we sing it many times and so often
[54:30] but how much greater that God's grace
[54:33] means to you and I right now tonight as
[54:35] a believer then when we first believed
[54:39] oh it's even so much greater to think of
[54:42] the greatness of how that God drew us
[54:45] unto himself cleaned up our lives and he
[54:47] stepped on the inside and put a burning
[54:50] fire of himself on the inside and then
[54:52] to think as trials as tests this thing's
[54:55] gone throughout the years and yet
[54:57] there's something beyond our own will
[54:59] that keeps motivating us that keeps
[55:02] pushing us that keeps moving in our life
[55:05] it's not our own will it's not our own
[55:08] goodness it's not our works it is the
[55:11] sovereignty and foreordination of
[55:14] Almighty God that God's program His Word
[55:17] will not be defeated if his word can be
[55:20] defeated then God can be defeated but
[55:23] God cannot be defeated he's not a man
[55:26] that he should lie nor the son of man
[55:28] that he should repent he ain't never had
[55:31] to take back a word and ain't about to
[55:33] start now let the power of my Lord be
[55:38] great you might have a need in your life
[55:42] right now that you're calling let the
[55:43] power of the my Lord be great according
[55:49] as thou has spoken nots this
[55:51] intercession according to the promise
[55:54] according as thou hast spoken saying the
[55:59] Lord is long-suffering and of great
[56:01] mercy forgiving iniquity and
[56:04] transgression and by no means clearing
[56:07] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[56:09] father's upon the children under
[56:11] the third and fourth generation
[56:14] you say what Moses has done right here
[56:16] within this portion right here this is
[56:19] what God has revealed to him after the
[56:22] past situation with the calf
[56:26] in Exodus 33 that whole part up through
[56:30] the remember Lord you spoke you was
[56:32] gonna send somebody with me who is it
[56:34] that thou you're gonna sin with me and
[56:35] God says glad you asked because I was
[56:37] wanting you to do that but you know I've
[56:39] got I want you to ask him that I'll move
[56:40] in and show you and make myself known in
[56:43] a greater way to you it was it that
[56:45] Moses you know when we look at this had
[56:47] he had an experience at the burning bush
[56:48] he did once it faith it was a solid
[56:51] absolute experience but within this
[56:53] right here the very heart of Moses was
[56:56] calling out and God would reveal himself
[56:58] according to Moses do you realize all
[57:01] glory
[57:02] do you realize God revealed himself to
[57:04] Moses in this way and when this
[57:07] situation God already had knowledge of
[57:10] this but God would step on the scene and
[57:13] Moses he was not just somebody who had
[57:16] accumulated a whole string of quotes and
[57:18] scriptures but this man was living by
[57:21] the word when it came time for this
[57:23] situation he reminded God of the word
[57:26] that God had just revealed to him this
[57:29] is who you are the Lord not was not will
[57:33] be the Lord is pardon I beseech thee
[57:41] pardon the iniquity of this people
[57:43] according unto the greatness of our
[57:45] mercy has thou has forgiven this people
[57:47] from Egypt even until now so how did
[57:54] they make it from Egypt even till now by
[57:58] him by his forgiveness how do you and I
[58:01] make it from day to day by him by his
[58:04] forgiveness let me tell you something
[58:07] every one of us need an intercessor on
[58:09] the throne every one of us need the lamb
[58:14] on the mercy seat come on friends it is
[58:18] I'm not talking about going around and
[58:20] willful sin I'm talking about that each
[58:22] and every one of us every day of our
[58:25] lives we need the intercessory work of
[58:28] the lamb sometimes we thought things
[58:31] wrong we've said things wrong sometimes
[58:33] mistakes and traps and other things we
[58:36] need the intercessory of the land no
[58:39] the scripture would speak to you and I
[58:41] in revelations 12 that we have overcome
[58:44] him by the blood of the Lamb glory if my
[58:49] brother and sister that's the working
[58:51] power of the new birth where you and I
[58:54] are connected with the Living God of the
[58:57] promise now if you think you're living
[59:04] too good that you don't need an
[59:05] intercessor you're already deceived you
[59:09] need an intercessor I need an
[59:11] intercessor hallelujah
[59:15] then the Lord said I have pardoned
[59:20] according to thy word see Moses word was
[59:26] God's Word but as truly as I live all
[59:31] the earth shall be filled with the glory
[59:34] of the Lord I want you I could preach
[59:36] months on this scripture right here
[59:37] notice what God is saying my program
[59:41] will not be interrupted sure as I live
[59:45] he lives yet he ever liveth to make
[59:49] intercession as truly as I live
[59:54] the Robina God the earth shall be filled
[59:58] with the glory of the Lord do you
[1:00:00] realize this promise it pertains to not
[1:00:03] only the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:05] it not only pertains to the working
[1:00:08] through the Gentile ages it not only
[1:00:10] pertains to the rapture the wedding
[1:00:12] supper the Millennium it goes clear into
[1:00:15] the future home for as surely as I live
[1:00:18] the whole earth shall be filled with the
[1:00:22] glory of the Lord huh he's undefeatable
[1:00:31] but within this because almost men verse
[1:00:36] 22 which have seen my glory and my
[1:00:40] miracles which I did in Egypt and in the
[1:00:44] wilderness and have tempted me now these
[1:00:46] 10 times and they're not hearken to my
[1:00:48] voice surely
[1:00:50] they shall not see the land which I
[1:00:53] swear into their fathers neither share
[1:00:55] any of them provoke to me see it spirit
[1:00:59] of intercession spirit of intercession
[1:01:02] is not pity spirit of intercession is
[1:01:05] according to the word do you realize
[1:01:07] that promise it was identified with
[1:01:10] those who are written within that
[1:01:11] section of the Lamb's Book of Life to
[1:01:14] wear their names cannot be removed I
[1:01:16] want you to look at it when you get home
[1:01:17] I don't got time to read it here but the
[1:01:19] Bible at the very end I believe it's
[1:01:20] Exodus 25 26 27 the very last Scripture
[1:01:24] it talks about how that God he actually
[1:01:26] removed those men who made the calf that
[1:01:29] Aaron made that's how it's said he's
[1:01:31] reason removed those men who made the
[1:01:34] calf that Aaron made isn't it amazing
[1:01:36] that though Aaron himself was an
[1:01:38] artificer he was one who actually had
[1:01:41] molded and shaped the gold but yet God
[1:01:43] Himself all the mercy and grace of
[1:01:46] Almighty God that God did not slay Aaron
[1:01:49] you know why because Aaron was already
[1:01:52] in the book explain that I can't I can't
[1:01:59] are you with me I can't explain that but
[1:02:02] I believe it the only thing that I know
[1:02:06] for sure is is that God could not cross
[1:02:08] over and remove Aaron's name oh my so I
[1:02:17] if I was you I wouldn't be trying to get
[1:02:20] your eraser out and remove my name or
[1:02:21] anybody else's name you just make sure
[1:02:25] your name's there and live like it's
[1:02:27] there leave about a very spirit and
[1:02:30] heart of Almighty God who put it there
[1:02:34] but my servant Caleb because he had
[1:02:39] another spirit with him and have
[1:02:42] followed me fully him will I bring into
[1:02:46] the land where until he went and his
[1:02:48] seed shall possess it
[1:02:51] see God recognize those who rebelled and
[1:02:54] then God recognized those who fully
[1:02:56] obeyed Caleb's foot was not in the land
[1:03:01] remember he was the one standing over a
[1:03:04] there he had toured the land seen the
[1:03:06] land he represented the tribal Judah but
[1:03:08] remember what Caleb stood there he and
[1:03:10] Joshua in the midst of those spies that
[1:03:13] brought up an evil report but yet Caleb
[1:03:15] himself sealed the people and he told
[1:03:18] them the Lord is forests let us go up
[1:03:21] and take it at once you see he all
[1:03:24] already fully obeyed from his heart you
[1:03:28] see this is why it's so important that
[1:03:29] we must have fellowship with the spirit
[1:03:32] and the word Moses was harnessed to it
[1:03:36] he was yoked to the Living God no wonder
[1:03:39] Paul could even Express this in his
[1:03:41] working were there among the churches
[1:03:43] and Paul would say I work according to
[1:03:45] his working that worketh in me mightily
[1:03:48] to think of even how that Israel through
[1:03:51] their journey you can see even in this
[1:03:53] part through the wilderness you can see
[1:03:55] the church ages let alone when they get
[1:03:57] into the land that there is a period of
[1:03:59] time that God is actually working and
[1:04:01] dealing with Israel you know the Bible
[1:04:03] says there was a mixed multitude that
[1:04:05] came out of Egypt is that right but yet
[1:04:07] within the midst of that mixed multitude
[1:04:09] God already knew that there was going to
[1:04:12] be seed in there that was promised that
[1:04:14] was actually going to inherit the land
[1:04:17] so you see intercession itself was not
[1:04:21] God saying I'm not going to deal with
[1:04:22] disobedience no God will deal with
[1:04:24] disobedience God will deal and he will
[1:04:27] correct
[1:04:27] he will reprimand he will actually
[1:04:30] remove listen friends not just in the
[1:04:32] future he'll actually remove lives and
[1:04:35] hearts and names who will not be
[1:04:37] obedient unto Him you realize brother
[1:04:41] Bram tells us in multiple places in this
[1:04:42] in the message that if the person will
[1:04:45] not take correction from God he said God
[1:04:47] will take them out of this earth because
[1:04:49] he will not lose one I want to receive
[1:04:54] correction don't you I don't want that
[1:04:57] testimony other side God had take me
[1:04:58] early why well I was stubborn I wouldn't
[1:05:03] listen to him I don't want that you
[1:05:07] realize there will be rewards handed out
[1:05:09] on the other side Paul speaks of this
[1:05:11] before the throne I don't want that to
[1:05:14] be on my resume I want it to be Lord
[1:05:16] thank you for every time you
[1:05:18] with me thank you for every time you
[1:05:19] corrected me every time you straighten
[1:05:21] me out because I realize it's for my
[1:05:22] benefit so this word itself the word of
[1:05:27] the round will go into this and the
[1:05:28] message for zooming and he deals with
[1:05:30] how the word itself it must be abiding
[1:05:33] within our lives not it cannot be just
[1:05:35] upon our intellect but it must be
[1:05:37] abiding within our hearts he goes on to
[1:05:40] say notice God had called Moses out and
[1:05:43] said I'm going to destroy the whole
[1:05:44] nation just step aside you ever thought
[1:05:48] about those words before just step aside
[1:05:51] you mean God had to tell Moses step out
[1:05:54] of the way what when God's just do it
[1:05:58] it's because it was the heart of God the
[1:06:02] Spirit of Christ that was represented in
[1:06:04] Moses and God could not walk over his
[1:06:09] own word he would be defeating himself
[1:06:13] so he told Moses step aside
[1:06:19] Moses interceded all of these words
[1:06:22] throwed himself in the bridge throwed
[1:06:26] himself in the breech
[1:06:27] it was Christ in Moses you see God would
[1:06:30] have killed a whole bunch one time for
[1:06:32] sin but Christ's throat his self in the
[1:06:35] breach for the whole human race
[1:06:37] Moses throat itself in the breach for
[1:06:39] Israel why they were a people of the
[1:06:42] promise a promise that God had made
[1:06:48] notice he said you made a promise God
[1:06:51] you made a promise that you take them
[1:06:55] into the land that's right what did
[1:06:57] Moses do to God when it looked like God
[1:07:00] was going to do something contrary he
[1:07:02] thrilled the word in his way oh brother
[1:07:05] mem said a man how I love that I feel
[1:07:07] like shouting just talking about it put
[1:07:10] the word in the way God can't walk over
[1:07:13] his word remember he said remember that
[1:07:17] servants Lord Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:07:23] glory be to God God had remembered a
[1:07:26] promise that's why in this hour has its
[1:07:28] lifted up in this hour it's bringing God
[1:07:31] to the attention it's quick into our
[1:07:33] lives and reminding God not that God
[1:07:36] forgot but it's reminding you know that
[1:07:38] reminding says it says i'm united with
[1:07:41] this promise i'm one with this promise i
[1:07:44] know you didn't forget it but i want you
[1:07:46] to know it is the heartbeat of my life
[1:07:48] it's what i think upon it's what I live
[1:07:51] for
[1:07:51] it's what I delight in remember that
[1:07:54] covenant Oh God
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:07:59] he said you promised to do it you said
[1:08:02] you'd take them to a good land that was
[1:08:05] flowing with milk and honey I've told
[1:08:07] them what you said and here we are we're
[1:08:10] on your hands we're on your hands you're
[1:08:15] the one who brought us out you brought
[1:08:17] us out here
[1:08:18] you're the one has provided manna
[1:08:19] forests provided quail you've provided
[1:08:21] water you've opened the Red Sea you've
[1:08:23] done all this were on your hands this
[1:08:27] trip is an all-expense-paid ticket by
[1:08:31] you we're on your hands God said I'll
[1:08:40] tell you I'll take that stubborn bunch
[1:08:42] and let them rot in the wilderness but
[1:08:45] I'll take them children of theirs that
[1:08:47] they say that wouldn't go anywhere they
[1:08:50] perish in the winters
[1:08:51] I'll take them over you said God
[1:08:55] wouldn't keeping a promise oh but he was
[1:08:56] he was standing true to his promise and
[1:09:00] he was their children that would have
[1:09:02] the spirit of the promise inside of them
[1:09:06] God did not make a promise just because
[1:09:09] people are along for the ride
[1:09:10] but everybody that comes along for the
[1:09:13] ride everybody's meaning that you know
[1:09:14] that ain't true
[1:09:15] 1st Corinthians chapter 10 they all
[1:09:17] drink from the same rock they all pass
[1:09:19] through the Red Sea they all eight men
[1:09:21] are they all but there were a few inside
[1:09:25] of the all who were a part of that
[1:09:28] promise and that promise made more than
[1:09:30] anything to them in the world they were
[1:09:33] not of the people who tempted the Lord
[1:09:35] or provoked him but they were people who
[1:09:38] waited on God they looked and walked
[1:09:40] patiently they believed what God had
[1:09:42] said he would perform
[1:09:47] sometimes it's just a carrier these
[1:09:51] people do you realize if God had
[1:09:53] destroyed them
[1:09:56] there have been nobody to go in the land
[1:09:59] but if you look at just the people so
[1:10:03] remember what we read and open and catch
[1:10:05] stubborn people but you see it was what
[1:10:09] was on the inside of them that was going
[1:10:11] to come forth Oh help me preach a little
[1:10:13] bit if it was just looking upon our
[1:10:16] flesh there ain't none of us that's
[1:10:20] worthy your best day is filthy rags in
[1:10:25] his sight
[1:10:26] Amen God didn't provide good walks he
[1:10:30] provided his own life his blood to be a
[1:10:34] token he didn't say when I see your good
[1:10:37] works I'll pass over you he said when I
[1:10:40] see the Blood I will pass over you
[1:10:46] whether this message is a life it's a
[1:10:49] lot that's to be lived and you've got
[1:10:51] the life inside of you you'll heed the
[1:10:53] news you'll refrain from the don'ts
[1:10:55] you'll heed to the Spirit of God you'll
[1:10:57] you'll live a life that is righteous the
[1:11:00] works that will come out of your life
[1:11:01] will testify to the grace that you've
[1:11:04] received but don't go looking down at
[1:11:09] your works and look down your nose in me
[1:11:11] or anybody else because you still need a
[1:11:14] high priest just as much as I do
[1:11:21] Moses was able to stand in the breach
[1:11:26] for the people let me just move on
[1:11:32] brother and we'll say it like this in
[1:11:34] one place and I just read these one to
[1:11:36] read these points to you brother Brown
[1:11:38] will say it in one place and he'll talk
[1:11:39] about Moses you know out of the
[1:11:41] scripture when you you look at the
[1:11:43] scripture in Psalms 106 verse 23 it says
[1:11:47] therefore he said that he would destroy
[1:11:48] them had not Moses his chosen stood
[1:11:52] before him in the breach to turn away
[1:11:56] his wrath lest he should destroy them
[1:11:59] how could Moses you know what it means
[1:12:01] to stand in the breach that there's not
[1:12:03] a gap do you realize what the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] is to you as a genuine believer when
[1:12:10] you've been born of the Spirit of God it
[1:12:13] is the does away with the breach between
[1:12:16] you and God
[1:12:18] it is the abstract - the title deed
[1:12:21] there is no longer a separation and here
[1:12:24] Moses himself he stood in the breach how
[1:12:27] could he do it because he had the Spirit
[1:12:29] of Christ on the inside of him it really
[1:12:35] brings the perspective of one in a
[1:12:36] million but LeBron tells us he goes into
[1:12:39] this and the message water from the rock
[1:12:41] he says Oh am I talking about how the
[1:12:44] people had grumbled and complained he
[1:12:46] said here's the power of a believer he
[1:12:49] thrown himself in the breach for the
[1:12:51] people and said God don't cross over
[1:12:54] don't cross over me take me first for
[1:12:58] you take them lord have mercy
[1:13:03] in the midst of their own but he said
[1:13:07] take me first before you touch them he's
[1:13:11] drawing the attention it's not to Moses
[1:13:15] the man spirit of Christ that promise
[1:13:18] that is made flesh God said God could
[1:13:25] not cross Moses the love of that people
[1:13:28] Moses had what if Moses would have
[1:13:31] separated himself
[1:13:32] what if Moses would have said I don't
[1:13:35] know about these people these can't be
[1:13:37] the people
[1:13:39] I mean they're sorry they're sorry oh my
[1:13:41] goodness
[1:13:42] there's just look at him how could he
[1:13:47] are you with me
[1:13:48] how could he separate himself one of
[1:13:52] Moses would have taken the attitude well
[1:13:54] I've got to be separate from sin he was
[1:13:57] in his heart tell me how Jesus could
[1:14:00] walk on this earth separate from sinners
[1:14:03] yet he was in the house answer me that
[1:14:07] question what is separation separation
[1:14:11] is a condition in your heart remember
[1:14:16] what they called him a wine-bibber they
[1:14:19] looked on him why you mixing with these
[1:14:21] people but remember what Jesus said he
[1:14:23] told us we're the salt of the earth and
[1:14:24] the salt cannot save unless it makes
[1:14:27] contact there's got to be contact glory
[1:14:33] be to God there's people you and I work
[1:14:35] with there's people that we rub
[1:14:37] shoulders worth the media spin limiters
[1:14:38] bring it on down right here it's beyond
[1:14:40] just the ranks of the message it's right
[1:14:42] here in our local assembly there's
[1:14:44] hearts and lives that need ministering
[1:14:46] to intercessory that needs to work there
[1:14:50] it must be the love and the burden of
[1:14:52] Christ within the body to be separate
[1:14:56] from sinners does not mean that I'd go
[1:14:58] along with the sin but it means that I
[1:15:02] go along and I become all things to all
[1:15:05] men that I may win some to Christ Paul
[1:15:07] did not mean that he was a partaker of
[1:15:09] their sins but Paul recognized the grace
[1:15:11] of God that come to me ain't none of you
[1:15:14] he said they were bigger sinner than I
[1:15:15] was I was the chiefest Paul never forgot
[1:15:18] the grace of God that came his way
[1:15:21] that's what makes me wonder sometimes
[1:15:24] where I wonder if people ever did
[1:15:25] experience God's grace because you see
[1:15:28] you'll live by the depth of the
[1:15:30] sacrifice that's revealed to you if the
[1:15:33] sacrifice revealed to you is very
[1:15:35] shallow
[1:15:35] you'll live very shallow but if it's
[1:15:38] revealed with great all-sufficient power
[1:15:40] as our Passover you'll live by the
[1:15:42] regenerative power of the blood of the
[1:15:45] lamb in your life you'll be able to see
[1:15:47] things and look beyond things of fall
[1:15:49] look
[1:15:50] almost everything and see various I need
[1:15:52] right there there's a heart that's
[1:15:54] crying out for God but if we're in the I
[1:15:59] don't know I don't know if I can hire
[1:16:01] that God can use you you're not in the
[1:16:05] right temperance of love for God to even
[1:16:06] usually let me go on with my message
[1:16:07] tonight you've got to have love right
[1:16:12] brother I'm standing there on the
[1:16:14] platform what did he do he looked at the
[1:16:16] feet of the man come on measured his
[1:16:20] shoulders realize his foot no there
[1:16:23] won't work coat won't work he had a
[1:16:26] heart floor that man just heard by the
[1:16:29] Rams say here just hear the morning
[1:16:30] listen to a message brother Graham talks
[1:16:32] about Burt how many know how many times
[1:16:34] brother Graham talks about old Burt
[1:16:35] night God he hunted with and yet brother
[1:16:39] Ram watch out brother Ram will dramatize
[1:16:40] it you know the way brother Ram will
[1:16:42] dramatize it
[1:16:43] I guarantee maybe some of us maybe even
[1:16:44] wouldn't hang around with a guy called
[1:16:46] Burt but brother Brandon went hunting
[1:16:48] with him and evidently the hunting that
[1:16:51] brother Brandon did with him ain't the
[1:16:53] hunting like me and some of the brothers
[1:16:54] would do we're generally were out in
[1:16:56] separate tree stands but he and brother
[1:16:57] branham were close together and there
[1:16:59] are things that brother Brent said oh no
[1:17:00] he's not going to do that tell me he
[1:17:02] ain't gonna bring up that whistle and
[1:17:03] blow that whistle whatever more but you
[1:17:05] see what was the outcome of it what was
[1:17:08] the outcome the man's soul was one for
[1:17:11] the kingdom of God because the Prophet
[1:17:15] was able to submit and manhandle by the
[1:17:18] Spirit of God his own pride who and God
[1:17:22] could not cross Moses the love of that
[1:17:25] people Moses had do you realize you
[1:17:28] can't talk to nobody unless you got love
[1:17:30] for him you can't you might as well be
[1:17:33] quiet you cannot do that you've got to
[1:17:36] have love for him it's like me if I went
[1:17:38] to another church and I'm sitting and
[1:17:40] I'm watching people and looking around
[1:17:41] if I don't know the heart of those
[1:17:43] people how in the world could I get up
[1:17:45] and say I've seen you doing this wrong
[1:17:47] first of all I would never do something
[1:17:48] like that
[1:17:49] that's the pastor's authority within
[1:17:51] that assembly but second of all I don't
[1:17:54] even know the heart of those people I
[1:17:56] don't know their culture their ethnicity
[1:17:57] I don't know how they think but you know
[1:18:00] what they are God's people
[1:18:02] there's something I might think I see
[1:18:04] that something wrong then I must and
[1:18:07] will by the spirit of intercession out
[1:18:09] of love for God's people in her seat and
[1:18:12] say lord help him and help me just to
[1:18:16] commit and forget it
[1:18:26] the heart of God seemed that and
[1:18:31] couldn't cross over his prophet brother
[1:18:35] Branham picks this up and says can you
[1:18:36] see it what prayer can do she already
[1:18:41] said can you see what prayer can do
[1:18:45] change God yes after God's already spoke
[1:18:48] something that's going to be prayer can
[1:18:51] change it and then he picks up and tells
[1:18:53] us about Isaiah in Hezekiah how God
[1:18:57] changed his mind
[1:18:58] Hezekiah began to pour his heart out and
[1:19:00] God sent Isaiah back and said alright go
[1:19:02] tell him
[1:19:03] prayer changed it what changed it in
[1:19:07] each one of these situations with Israel
[1:19:09] prayer what kind of prayer prayer
[1:19:11] intercessory prayer according to the
[1:19:14] promise you know what that means in your
[1:19:17] life that means the same way in your
[1:19:18] life in marriage with your children
[1:19:20] you've got a promise in God's Word
[1:19:22] you've got a promise in God's Word they
[1:19:24] and their offspring shall be there with
[1:19:26] them you've got a promise in God's word
[1:19:29] of a husband and wife you've got a
[1:19:30] promise all the way through I can resign
[1:19:32] them all tonight it'll just take up too
[1:19:34] much time but you have promises in the
[1:19:36] word that you're able to bring before
[1:19:39] God and say Lord that my heart would
[1:19:42] match your heart that what you can see
[1:19:45] is your heart in me that that promise
[1:19:48] might come to pass because that's my
[1:19:50] promise Oh Sammy you don't know no no no
[1:19:55] no no but Sammy no no no it's God who
[1:19:58] made the promise and if God made the
[1:20:00] promise God didn't call me to fulfill it
[1:20:03] he's the one who fulfills it
[1:20:07] prayer can change it the Bible tells us
[1:20:11] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:20:14] and God shall raise a mother
[1:20:16] it also lets us know that we're to pray
[1:20:20] for one another that we may be healed be
[1:20:24] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:20:27] man availeth much I'm just trying to get
[1:20:29] to get somewhere let me get to this
[1:20:31] point here and then walk we'll just
[1:20:32] close so many places in the scripture
[1:20:36] that you could see this with
[1:20:37] intercessory prayer in job John chapter
[1:20:41] 1 verse 4 the Bible said his sons went
[1:20:44] and feasted in their houses every one
[1:20:46] his day and sent and called for their
[1:20:49] three sisters to eat and to drink with
[1:20:51] them and he was so when the days of
[1:20:54] they're feasting were gone about that
[1:20:56] job's sent and sanctified them and rose
[1:21:00] up early in the morning and offered
[1:21:02] burnt offerings according to the number
[1:21:04] of them all for job said it may be that
[1:21:09] my sons have sinned and cursed God in
[1:21:12] their heart that word curse means to
[1:21:14] bless oneself curse God in their hearts
[1:21:17] thus did job continually you know what
[1:21:22] this was a type a type of the Living God
[1:21:26] the Lord Jesus Christ is ever liveth to
[1:21:31] make intercession for you and I he is
[1:21:34] seated there until every one of his sons
[1:21:37] and daughters come home joke did it
[1:21:42] continually her adventure they might
[1:21:44] have done this you know what he put but
[1:21:47] offering of the lamb when any type of
[1:21:49] temptation could come and it was about
[1:21:51] his children and saying this and saying
[1:21:53] that notice even when the report came
[1:21:55] that your children have perished but
[1:21:58] joke could stand there on the promise
[1:22:00] that God had revealed to him I have
[1:22:03] offered up the lamb on their behalf all
[1:22:06] god help us I'll tell you as parents as
[1:22:09] families as each and every one of us as
[1:22:11] husbands in a household moms and dads we
[1:22:14] need to continually Oh
[1:22:16] for the lam continually we need to
[1:22:19] continue to show that word and set that
[1:22:22] word before children before household
[1:22:25] continually God can bring out of the
[1:22:31] ground what's not been planted but the
[1:22:35] urgency as I heard the Prophet saying
[1:22:37] the message inspiration he said all God
[1:22:40] help us that we may so before the
[1:22:43] nighttime cometh he said we must so that
[1:22:47] there'll be a crop for tomorrow
[1:22:50] it's an urgency and so on I want you to
[1:22:53] think of this as we wind this down the
[1:22:57] Lord Jesus himself the Bible records an
[1:23:00] in Isaiah 53 of how that God beheld the
[1:23:08] lamb he beheld the offering up of his
[1:23:13] sword he poured his soul unto death
[1:23:16] verse 12 said he was numbered with the
[1:23:18] transgressors and he bare the sin of
[1:23:20] many and made intercession for the
[1:23:24] transgressors you see I don't want to
[1:23:28] say simple truth because I'm not making
[1:23:30] light of that but I'm bringing this to
[1:23:33] this place but that is the real reality
[1:23:36] of what God has done for you and I it
[1:23:39] has always been that that down through
[1:23:41] the ages were Satan has wanted to take
[1:23:44] away from the word and the effectiveness
[1:23:46] of the sacrifice but you see God has
[1:23:49] always moved to bring the attention by
[1:23:53] way of his angel messengers to every age
[1:23:56] it is pointed back to the all-sufficient
[1:23:59] sacrifice that was made for you and I it
[1:24:02] was made for you in mind don't you
[1:24:04] realize that when God would send his
[1:24:06] spirit and to think how that Paul would
[1:24:08] stand there and he would say it has been
[1:24:10] given to us the word of reconciliation
[1:24:13] we pray you in God's stead that you
[1:24:16] would be reconciled to God we pray you
[1:24:19] in Christ's stead he would let it be
[1:24:21] known we are ambassadors we are
[1:24:23] representatives of that light and of
[1:24:25] this glorious possible we have
[1:24:28] to bring the good news the announcement
[1:24:30] that there's been a sacrifice and
[1:24:32] offering and it was made with you in
[1:24:34] mind and that light has shined down
[1:24:37] through the ages in every Gentile Church
[1:24:39] age and what was it it was the Spirit of
[1:24:41] God moving in intersession to call his
[1:24:45] children unto himself those who he had
[1:24:49] redeemed after cross we were reconciled
[1:24:54] to God and because we were reconciled
[1:24:58] payment ransom was made then the
[1:25:01] announcement comes to you and I and
[1:25:04] there is that which rises up within us
[1:25:06] and recognized I was a part of that
[1:25:09] transaction that transaction was made
[1:25:12] with me in mind
[1:25:17] hallelujah it calls us back to the
[1:25:20] redemptive work of Calvary all down
[1:25:22] through the ages Paul and them folly was
[1:25:27] going to come in their day I'd rainiest
[1:25:29] and then thought it was going to come in
[1:25:31] their day Martin and them live you see
[1:25:33] what they had to live that way that was
[1:25:35] the spirit there that had moved upon
[1:25:38] their life the issuing of the Holy
[1:25:40] Spirit their depth of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:42] that came in that day and they live they
[1:25:45] live true to that word but you realized
[1:25:47] that God there had to stay that her the
[1:25:50] lamb had to remain on the mercy seat
[1:25:52] until the last name is actually come
[1:25:56] into manifestation and where it comes to
[1:25:59] the place to where the name is actually
[1:26:02] splashed beneath the Clorox bleach we're
[1:26:06] living in the time of the finishing up
[1:26:09] of all things oh and I'm so glad as the
[1:26:13] prophets head oh god I hope he's there
[1:26:16] tonight for my sin and your sin an
[1:26:22] intercessor on the throne interceding
[1:26:27] for you and I who is it
[1:26:29] that sent the stars in his right hand he
[1:26:32] did who is it that brought you to
[1:26:36] himself he did who is it to see to it
[1:26:39] that this truth crossed your path
[1:26:41] he did let me just tell like this simply
[1:26:44] put you and I would not even be here
[1:26:47] tonight if it had not been the offering
[1:26:49] up of the Lord Jesus Christ he made a
[1:26:52] prayer of intercession in John 17 and
[1:26:55] that prayer of intercession was
[1:26:57] reflective to what had already taken
[1:27:00] place before the foundation of the world
[1:27:02] and he was standing to make intercession
[1:27:05] for you and I I pray father that thou
[1:27:08] make us that one even as thou art in me
[1:27:12] that we might be in them and that prayer
[1:27:17] has been in fulfillment soon and very
[1:27:23] soon it'll be the completion the
[1:27:27] complete answering of the prayer that
[1:27:30] was made and he has seated there on the
[1:27:35] midde toriel seat making intercession
[1:27:37] for you and me think about what kind of
[1:27:42] lives that maybe some of us were in
[1:27:44] conditions that you could say I'm glad
[1:27:48] that God didn't come glad my number
[1:27:49] didn't call them because I wouldn't be
[1:27:50] ready
[1:27:51] he knew that he knew that his
[1:27:56] intercession held for your life and for
[1:28:00] my life Ramana you might even been
[1:28:03] raised around the word of truth just as
[1:28:05] I was but you know what we had to come
[1:28:08] into manifestation to where our names
[1:28:11] would be as the Prophet said in souls in
[1:28:13] prison thoroughly redeemed we were
[1:28:16] already redeemed how did you become
[1:28:18] thoroughly redeemed when you become
[1:28:20] expressed in this our loving he's seated
[1:28:28] there on the mercy seat tonight
[1:28:32] interceding on behalf of his promise you
[1:28:39] and I can keep him busy tonight you
[1:28:41] realize that we can say we can put all
[1:28:45] of our petitions by faith in need
[1:28:48] before him he's not gonna rise from that
[1:28:52] throne until the last one has come in
[1:28:59] glory be to God
[1:29:01] that's just bare hands Lord
[1:29:09] how we thank you tonight father thank
[1:29:14] you Lord Jesus
[1:29:15] for the greatness of your mercy Lord we
[1:29:21] realize Lord that your mercy it holds
[1:29:26] for us
[1:29:26] Oh God
[1:29:30] as your prophet would say I don't want
[1:29:34] God's justice I could never stand it so
[1:29:40] you would go on to say if I got we got
[1:29:43] what we deserved we would get help but
[1:29:49] father your mercy oh it doesn't let us
[1:29:53] get by but your mercy comes and eels
[1:29:59] with our life brings us to you corrects
[1:30:02] us cleans us up fills us up and helps us
[1:30:07] to grow up chastening us correcting us
[1:30:10] edifying us
[1:30:12] we're your workmanship or how we thank
[1:30:18] you tonight
[1:30:21] I'm so grateful Lord for the
[1:30:25] intercession that was made according to
[1:30:29] the promise or it's always been
[1:30:33] something that touched my heart
[1:30:35] after a cutting message like the message
[1:30:38] the indictment your prophet would move
[1:30:43] in there in that place I find this to be
[1:30:47] very remarkable because in that same
[1:30:51] message he's also speaking of how that
[1:30:55] himself he wanted to have a heart for
[1:30:59] the people it lost the feeling and he
[1:31:05] was recalling that and then after
[1:31:06] speaking in the message Lord God I
[1:31:11] believe it was your spirit that moved in
[1:31:13] and said Lord but I asked for mercy
[1:31:18] for those Lord some of those Lord that's
[1:31:21] in these systems and different things
[1:31:25] he prayed for ministers Lord that were
[1:31:29] in those systems judgment Lord God an
[1:31:35] indictment was pronounced it was the
[1:31:41] same spirit of Christ
[1:31:43] letting it know if this is an ending
[1:31:47] with the mercy of God could step in and
[1:31:52] pray there were a live Lord many
[1:31:58] different lines different ones of a
[1:31:59] different ones that we know what I think
[1:32:02] of different ministering brothers I know
[1:32:04] that were at that time they were in an
[1:32:06] organization I think of my own dad Lord
[1:32:10] whose went on home to be with you Oh God
[1:32:14] I think of each of our lives it shows a
[1:32:18] sword it shows each of us sir pastor
[1:32:25] husband is a dad it shows each of us as
[1:32:30] believers of the body of Jesus Christ of
[1:32:35] that burden at desired would that
[1:32:40] intercession according to the promise
[1:32:42] [Music]
[1:32:46] or god help us help us to keep our eyes
[1:32:50] on you help us Lord to walk with
[1:32:53] submissive hearts Lord help us Lord that
[1:32:57] as you would admonish us through Paul's
[1:33:02] letter to the Philippians looked not
[1:33:06] just on your own things but look upon
[1:33:11] one another
[1:33:12] considering one another praying for one
[1:33:16] another
[1:33:17] interceding for one another help us lord
[1:33:22] help us that we may have a real heart
[1:33:30] father for husbands for wives for
[1:33:34] children or myself as a pastor for each
[1:33:37] and every brother and sister that's here
[1:33:39] avoid different ones that will hear this
[1:33:41] service Lord some no doubt the streaming
[1:33:43] I pray God may we have your heart Lord
[1:33:52] Oh Lord Jesus for the letter killeth
[1:33:57] but the spirit giveth life help us in
[1:34:01] Jesus father what a comfort it is you're
[1:34:06] not gonna lose a one you made the
[1:34:09] promise the Lord I think about it how
[1:34:12] many of us Lord many that are older than
[1:34:13] me sitting here I was just sort of a
[1:34:17] little something in diapers and even
[1:34:19] before that many of them Lord were
[1:34:21] following the truth of this hour no
[1:34:25] doubt they never thought they never
[1:34:29] thought we would be here this long when
[1:34:32] I think back 22 years ago when you were
[1:34:34] 23 years ago after you got a hold of my
[1:34:36] life I never thought we would be here in
[1:34:38] 2018 getting ready to go in 2019 I've
[1:34:42] never even seen things the Lord never
[1:34:44] even foresaw things I didn't need to I
[1:34:48] don't need to know the future of this is
[1:34:51] going to happen in that but Lord things
[1:34:52] that we've seen happen right around in
[1:34:56] our own range some things sword we've
[1:34:59] seen people walk away and other things
[1:35:00] Lord or things that we fought that we've
[1:35:05] never even entertained never even
[1:35:06] thought about it but father you know
[1:35:09] Lord and I pray God for your mercy I
[1:35:14] don't know Lord whose cross the line and
[1:35:16] who has it but I pray God for your mercy
[1:35:21] Lord there's no doubt Lord God that
[1:35:24] there's some Lord God that got caught in
[1:35:27] the wave they need a real birth they
[1:35:31] need a real absolute leader real anchor
[1:35:33] Lord they really needed to meet you Lord
[1:35:35] but I pray God I ask for your mercy for
[1:35:39] their lives Lord God not that you would
[1:35:42] bless them I don't pray in a way of pity
[1:35:43] I pray Lord God that you'll deal with
[1:35:47] their hearts Lord Jesus turn their
[1:35:50] hearts Lord God I pray help them to see
[1:35:53] the error of their
[1:35:54] lord help them to see Lord God that
[1:35:56] spirit of air Lord God that would move
[1:35:59] around them Lord God
[1:36:01] granite lord I pray Heavenly Father or
[1:36:06] God right here in our sembly Lord what
[1:36:11] God I pray father for so many different
[1:36:14] needs
[1:36:14] there's lives Lord that they need a
[1:36:17] deeper walk with you I pray that God
[1:36:20] that you would move for them Lord I pray
[1:36:22] that you would move Lord God for the
[1:36:25] discouraged in heart Lord I pray father
[1:36:28] for those Lord better suffering in their
[1:36:30] body lord I pray that you would move for
[1:36:32] them Lord God those Lord God that maybe
[1:36:34] in their spirit Lord that are troubled I
[1:36:37] pray Heavenly Father that God that you

[1:36:42] would ease or God may I pray father
[1:36:44] peace be still or God tonight Lord and
[1:36:49] may you who is the great rest or God and
[1:36:52] love her Lord of our soul may there not
[1:36:56] be one here tonight Lord or God under
[1:36:59] the sound of my voice
[1:37:00] Lord Jesus that would Lord go without
[1:37:04] Lord making you their refuge would their
[1:37:08] wrists granite Lord we pray help us lord
[1:37:13] help us we may not be a prophet like
[1:37:17] Moses was but I don't believe that
[1:37:20] that's why your prophet he ministered
[1:37:22] this he never said in that quote what's
[1:37:26] the power of a prophet no that's not
[1:37:28] what he said he said what's the power of
[1:37:31] a believer and we're believers would we
[1:37:35] may not be prophets we may not have all
[1:37:37] but we're believers
[1:37:40] in another part of the message Israel in
[1:37:42] the church part for your prophets tells
[1:37:44] us like this he said watch a man before
[1:37:48] God look at the power of a saint before
[1:37:53] God what were Saints sanctified ones
[1:37:58] born of your spirit believers may we
[1:38:04] throw our lives may we live our lives
[1:38:07] not for ourselves but may we live it
[1:38:12] unto you living for others
[1:38:16] help us Lord I pray we love you and
[1:38:21] thank you Lord in Jesus me all your
[1:38:26] loving tonight blessed be the name of
[1:38:32] the Lord
[1:38:34] aren't you glad for his intercession you
[1:38:39] know you think about it like this I got
[1:38:42] to thinking about this on the way to
[1:38:43] church thought about that of John 17 the
[1:38:50] intercessory prayer that was made
[1:38:52] thought about the lamb seated on the
[1:38:54] mercy seat thought about him being our
[1:38:57] high priest of our profession thought
[1:39:02] about how that God would move down and
[1:39:04] begin to deal with our lives I got to
[1:39:07] thinking about that habit you know I was
[1:39:10] out doing my own thing but then God
[1:39:12] began to deal with my life he began to
[1:39:15] deal with your life what was that that
[1:39:18] was the effect of that prayer of
[1:39:21] intercession that was moving it was made
[1:39:25] it was already declared before the
[1:39:27] foundation of the world but here the
[1:39:29] Lamb of God begins to sound that out and
[1:39:32] then the same spirit of that lamb would
[1:39:34] move into the hearts of different ones
[1:39:36] and you didn't even know it I didn't
[1:39:38] know it but our name was being brought
[1:39:40] before the throne of God I hope it don't
[1:39:46] stumble you but your name might have
[1:39:47] been brought before before the throne of
[1:39:50] God it might have been by somebody who
[1:39:51] was a Baptist they might have been a
[1:39:54] Pentecostal and what they knew is that
[1:39:56] he's a savior come on somebody he's a
[1:39:59] savior they would say Lord save him Lord
[1:40:02] save him Lord God knew he had more for
[1:40:05] you but it was somebody who knew you
[1:40:09] that prayed for you but God said I've
[1:40:11] already prayed for him he an hour to be
[1:40:15] united in this life you see you didn't
[1:40:18] stop it was gone moving all the time
[1:40:23] he was calling you to himself the
[1:40:25] effects of that spirit of intercession
[1:40:27] do you realize tonight healing that
[1:40:29] you've received in your body is because
[1:40:31] there's an intercessor on the throne
[1:40:33] means that you've had met in your life
[1:40:35] it's the effect of the intercessor
[1:40:38] moving upon your life when you've been
[1:40:41] discouraged when you've been down do you
[1:40:43] realize what that is when you when you
[1:40:45] look and you said ma I just don't feel
[1:40:47] like I've got any strength at all but
[1:40:48] you thought of the word what was it the
[1:40:50] Spirit of God moving down said let the
[1:40:53] weak say I am strong and you said I am
[1:40:56] strong
[1:40:56] what is that the intercessor went to
[1:40:59] work and virtue was released from the
[1:41:04] throne of God
[1:41:05] Bobby intercessor himself they might
[1:41:09] think we're nuts my thing were fanatics
[1:41:12] but we know we know we've received the
[1:41:16] experience and the experiences of the
[1:41:20] release of his virtue in our lives don't
[1:41:24] you love him

[1:41:28] and let me just let you in on a little
