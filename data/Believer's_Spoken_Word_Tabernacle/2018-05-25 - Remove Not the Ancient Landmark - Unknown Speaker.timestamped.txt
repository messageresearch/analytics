[38:04] such man
[38:08] [Music]
[38:10] yeah
[38:13] [Music]
[38:15] the bro
[38:25] [Music]
[38:29] you're the reason a man is a very reason
[38:34] love that brought him down to earth and
[38:36] we know that it was not just a chance
[38:39] but God came on a mission and he came to
[38:44] set free what had been taken captive
[38:46] that belonged to him amen and your
[38:50] witnesses tonight that I once was held
[38:53] captive but I've been set free and it
[38:56] took it took one greater than us to come
[38:59] on the scene and set us free and we're
[39:02] witnesses tonight of that amen and we
[39:04] thank God for His mercy tonight only and
[39:07] I just want to say God bless you today
[39:10] visitors that have come I know with the
[39:14] local church I sent it out and we had
[39:17] posted it there on Facebook as well -
[39:19] but brother jewel had to had to cancel
[39:22] out and I told him don't don't think
[39:25] about it it's okay he was under the
[39:27] pressure one of the friends of the
[39:29] family had had passed some of you may
[39:31] know I don't know I've met brother John
[39:33] Keith years ago he's from down around
[39:36] Beaufort South Carolina and he passed
[39:37] away suddenly they're in on Thursday
[39:42] night early Friday Friday morning
[39:44] actually was up in the johnson city
[39:46] tri-cities area when he when he passed
[39:48] at the hospital and you know it just
[39:51] shows one thing that you know you're
[39:53] always it's it's a place for a believer
[39:55] where you know I had I said that night
[39:57] they were they were talking about him
[39:59] getting good night's rest I said he went
[40:01] to sleep on this side and he woke up you
[40:04] talk about a good night's rest he had a
[40:06] real good night's rest he woke up really
[40:09] refreshed but we want to remember the
[40:12] family and and brother Jule was just
[40:14] really just really torn and not knowing
[40:17] what was going to do and he had asked me
[40:20] to pray and pray that he'll just you
[40:21] know the funeral being on different day
[40:23] and I just didn't have the heart to pray
[40:24] about that I said you know I know what
[40:27] that is the family they're going through
[40:28] that and so we'll just pray for that and
[40:31] so one thing about it there might be a
[40:34] different vessel but I believe that
[40:36] Lord he always is present if if we're
[40:41] focused on him coming because he's the
[40:43] one that really is the one who meets our
[40:45] needs and I just want to say I'm
[40:48] thankful that brother Alexander McGillis
[40:51] he was able to come and and you know
[40:54] even a brother Jesse Smith tomorrow to
[40:57] take it with the youth service I don't
[40:59] look at it that's just by chance
[41:00] God has things arranged we have a more
[41:03] of a greater understanding of that God
[41:05] has things arranged and you know to me
[41:07] I've never been able to understand it
[41:09] I've never been able to understand why I
[41:12] would go from here and why would go to
[41:14] minister somewhere else because to me if
[41:16] you're eating peanut butter and jelly
[41:18] you're eating peanut butter and jelly
[41:19] but you know God will even change the
[41:22] vessel that served that peanutbutter
[41:24] sandwich
[41:26] that's God's mercy because God's
[41:30] objective is just that we get it and in
[41:33] that something you know God could demand
[41:35] a lot of things and say you sorry humans
[41:37] and this but see God came down and
[41:39] become one of us
[41:40] and he understands everything that we go
[41:43] through even the commonalities but I'm
[41:45] glad that His grace it will override all
[41:49] of those things and then we can step
[41:51] back and say goodness
[41:53] Lord how you spoke and minister to my
[41:56] knee tonight and no doubt you know
[41:59] brother Randy you've heard is it my
[42:01] never heard it like that before and you
[42:03] preached fifty parts on it but you know
[42:07] it God has a way of doing it and that
[42:09] wonderful I'm just so thankful for that
[42:11] tonight and I'm just so grateful that
[42:13] brother Alexander and sister Maria that
[42:16] they would would come here and be with
[42:17] us in such a short notice and we
[42:19] certainly appreciate so
[42:23] without me without any further ado we
[42:25] want to just turn the service right over
[42:27] to to brother Alexander ask him just to
[42:29] take his liberty tonight and you know
[42:31] it's like this of all the truth that God
[42:33] has given us within this age and what is
[42:35] being ministered but yet when that word
[42:37] is coming remember it's divine
[42:39] inspiration of the Holy Spirit there's a
[42:41] channel that's being opened up and when
[42:43] that channel is opened up it's one of
[42:45] those things that you want to just move
[42:47] right in that channel for what God is is
[42:50] speaking to our hearts about and you
[42:52] watch there is that there's a blessing
[42:53] and there is needs that would be met
[42:56] right here tonight there's a channel
[42:58] that God has to open we want to move
[43:00] right in that channel you know when that
[43:02] man who was there on the stretcher and
[43:04] he could not get to that pool but here
[43:07] the angel would come down and they would
[43:09] trouble that pool at a certain time you
[43:11] know brother Brennan said it like this
[43:12] he said that wasn't a natural wind he
[43:14] said that was a supernatural wind
[43:16] he said because as soon as the person
[43:18] stepped in that water the water ceased
[43:20] trouble it was a supernatural wind and I
[43:23] believe in that same supernatural wind
[43:25] tonight because I've had an experience
[43:28] of that supernatural wind in my soul how
[43:31] many witnesses of that tonight okay men
[43:33] it changed your life when when we
[43:36] couldn't get to but he came to where we
[43:38] were at and lifted us up yeah that's
[43:40] real grace amen that's real grace
[43:43] tonight so we want to move in that
[43:45] channel where the Lord is speaking to
[43:47] our hearts tonight amen you hungry amen

[48:57] they started on time and so I was I'm
[49:00] not saying as a joke it's just it's so
[49:02] uncommon but they were taught you know
[49:04] if you set a certain time you do it a
[49:06] certain way and so I just really
[49:07] appreciated that there's somebody put a
[49:09] lot of work into there so praise the
[49:10] Lord for that and and if you have your
[49:13] Bibles tonight we'll have you stand I
[49:16] had a certain thought uh and uh the Lord
[49:20] kind took me a different way I see the
[49:21] Lawson's here they just heard this last
[49:23] week so sorry
[49:25] but we just believed Lord bring about a
[49:27] fresh anointing to it if I sound a
[49:30] little hoarse tonight I've been sick all
[49:32] week and the Lord has just made a way
[49:34] for me to be here I'm already sweating
[49:35] buckets you can see and usually takes me
[49:37] just a few minutes to do that so so you
[49:39] just pray for me tonight that I can find
[49:42] my liberty in the Lord amen and I
[49:43] believe that God can do anything I've
[49:47] just watched him do so many things and I
[49:50] believe that he's no different tonight
[49:52] amen proverbs chapter 22 this evening
[49:55] and we're gonna look in the 28th verse
[49:58] it's a short reading tonight proverbs
[50:01] chapter 22 verse 28 it says this remove
[50:04] not the ancient landmark which thy
[50:07] fathers have said amen
[50:10] remove not the ancient landmark which
[50:12] thy fathers have set and one if we just
[50:14] bow our heads for word of Prayer this

[50:17] word now Heavenly Father we are
[50:20] certainly grateful for the opportunity
[50:23] to be here tonight Lord not just as
[50:26] church members but as sons and daughters
[50:28] of God and and the Lord our hearts are
[50:30] warm tonight by the presence of the Holy
[50:33] Spirit in this place Lord the warship
[50:35] and the friendly spirit of the people

[50:58] call from the altar and may everything
[51:00] that's said and done before your glory
[51:02] get yourself great glory and honor in
[51:04] this place I asked father lower there's
[51:07] many needs here tonight perhaps needs
[51:09] that we are not even aware of ourselves
[51:11] but before we would even know or ask
[51:13] about these needs you knew what they
[51:15] were and father I believe a divine
[51:17] appointment has been made with the
[51:19] people of God here tonight before the
[51:22] foundation of the world
[51:24] nothing has taken place tonight by
[51:26] happenstance or by chance but you have
[51:28] ordained this meeting and the the
[51:30] bringing about of how has come to pass
[51:32] because you have a divine purpose and it
[51:35] Lord and we just want to surrender to
[51:37] you now and say Amen LOI
[51:39] we accept Lord what you would have to do
[51:41] in our lives and we appreciate Lord that
[51:43] you would be mindful of us even the
[51:45] little things and father we just ask now
[51:48] you'd come bless this service the
[51:50] reading of the word which has been read
[51:52] tonight
[51:52] may your come in unfold a revelation to
[51:55] us and make this word more real to us in
[51:57] our own lives that we might live
[51:59] victorious as overcomers in the name of
[52:02] the Lord Jesus Christ and father would
[52:04] give you all the praise and glory and
[52:06] honor in Jesus name Amen and amen god
[52:09] bless you tonight just take a few
[52:12] moments here you may be seated
[52:14] while I remain standing amen
[52:17] take a few moments tonight and we'll
[52:18] just parachute out as brother Joel would
[52:20] say at the end amen I'm gonna preach on
[52:24] remove not the ancient landmark hey man
[52:28] and you look at this scripture we read
[52:30] tonight and the the idea of a landmark
[52:32] goes clear back to the book of
[52:33] Deuteronomy in the nineteenth chapter
[52:35] and I'll be referring to there for a
[52:37] little bit this evening and want to kind
[52:38] of just lay a foundation if I can but
[52:40] the ancient landmark of the idea is laid
[52:42] out by Moses in the book of Deuteronomy
[52:44] in the nineteenth chapter and the
[52:46] prophet of God he tells us the word
[52:48] Deuteronomy itself it means two laws
[52:51] Amen yeah it's what God does he has two
[52:54] different laws one of them is a law of
[52:56] life and one is a law of death one is a
[52:59] lot of blessing and one is a law of
[53:01] cursing and so to follow the word of
[53:04] life is to be blessed and to reject the
[53:06] word of life doesn't God place the
[53:08] perform a choices and now choose you
[53:09] this day life or death and then he
[53:11] exerts them to choose life so God wants
[53:13] us to have life you understand the Bible
[53:16] says that the thief comes to steal and
[53:18] to kill and destroy but he said I am
[53:20] come that you might have life and it
[53:23] abundantly amen so when you know when
[53:26] you hear a minister you see something
[53:28] whatever it be and it's something it's a
[53:30] source of death or it's trying to rob or
[53:32] take from the people of God what God has
[53:34] given us you know who's bringing it amen
[53:36] cuz listen God wants us to have life and
[53:39] he wants us to have it abundantly amen
[53:40] not just an abundance of stuff that
[53:43] pertains life but his own life Zoe in
[53:46] abundance the power to overcome him and
[53:48] that this mortal will be quickened by
[53:50] his spirit it would be thrown into
[53:52] subjection to the Word of God it would
[53:55] quicken this mortal body by his spirit
[53:57] that dwelleth in us is that right and so
[54:00] it's a law of life and death and the
[54:01] believer is that right the Paul said the
[54:04] law of God I want to serve God with the
[54:06] law of my mind he said but there was
[54:08] another law in me the law of sin and
[54:10] death of my members and when I would go
[54:12] to do good evil as present the things I
[54:14] would do I don't the things I don't want
[54:16] to do that's what I do
[54:18] amen but thank god there's another law
[54:20] for the believer tonight while the world
[54:22] is subject to vanity while the world is
[54:24] subject to the nature of sin that they
[54:27] are born in the believer has another
[54:29] recourse tonight they've come to the
[54:31] very person a man of eternal life Jesus
[54:34] Christ and that is right now and this is
[54:37] simply tonight if you were a believer
[54:38] there is right now no more condemnation
[54:41] to those who are in Christ who walk not
[54:44] after the flesh but after the spirit who
[54:47] they were we are made alive how but the
[54:50] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[54:53] Jesus it has made us free from the
[54:55] lobster net hey man look I'm not just
[54:58] trying to get free from The Lofts and
[55:00] there's so many Christians they still
[55:01] struggle with it but I can proclaim
[55:03] right now by faith no matter if there's
[55:05] mistakes no matter if there's trials or
[55:07] things I'm going through the law of the
[55:09] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has
[55:12] already made me free from the law of sin
[55:15] death listen I'm not halfway at the
[55:18] prison house today I have escaped the
[55:20] corruption that is in the world through
[55:22] last how by the holy ghost that liveth
[55:25] in me listen my nature has changed from
[55:28] the things of death and the things alive
[55:30] and that's why you're here tonight
[55:32] that's why I'm here tonight
[55:33] we didn't come here to fulfill a
[55:35] religious obligation like some sinners
[55:38] they go to church and they do the things
[55:39] they hate and they say the things they
[55:41] hate and they continue to do things that
[55:42] they hate but they do because get them
[55:45] to heaven one day but we're here tonight
[55:47] because our nature has been changed the
[55:49] axes been laid to the root of the tree
[55:50] the law of sudden death has been
[55:53] destroyed in the law of the spirit of
[55:55] life in Christ Jesus amen oh yeah well
[56:00] praise the Lord the law of blessing in
[56:02] the law of cursing the law of life in
[56:03] the law of death now this book of
[56:05] Deuteronomy lays up the laws of
[56:06] inheritance and the promised land is
[56:08] that right we know from the Book of Ruth
[56:10] you look at the idea of an inheritance
[56:13] that if a man if you found a bondage or
[56:15] if his if his progeny if they died or
[56:18] something happened
[56:19] he had an inheritance and if something
[56:22] were to take place he could go back and
[56:23] redeem that inheritance is that Alright
[56:26] the person could go back if you had
[56:29] somebody if you had a child Lee died and
[56:31] they had no children by their wife but a
[56:35] kinsman redeemer was the rise up whoever
[56:38] the next of kin was the rise up and
[56:39] raise up children in the deceased name
[56:42] that their inheritance would not perish
[56:45] from the earth amen now this is what
[56:48] happens in the Book of Ruth of course
[56:50] Boaz he goes and he goes before the
[56:52] elders of the gates and and he's trying
[56:54] to take their inheritance through Naomi
[56:57] because there's a Ruth that he wants to
[56:59] purchase amen now notice there's a near
[57:01] kinsman in the equation
[57:03] Amen there's a near kinsman there and he
[57:05] says okay look there's an inheritance it
[57:07] has to be redeemed
[57:09] would you like to inherit it well of
[57:11] course he's like yeah I'd love to buy
[57:13] that land I'd love to have the
[57:15] inheritance of the Atlantis's that's
[57:17] fine but know this on the day
[57:20] you redeemed the inheritance of Naomi
[57:22] you must also take Ruth as your wife
[57:24] well he wasn't interested in the wife he
[57:27] was just shouldn't land so he said let's
[57:28] I can't do that with Marv my own
[57:31] inheritance he says he could not take
[57:34] this inheritance without marring his own
[57:36] inheritance a man I'm so thankful the
[57:38] devil can't come behind the blood of
[57:40] Jesus Christ tonight he'd actually
[57:41] become your brother to do it it's all
[57:42] right well it's the truth anyhow hey man
[57:45] praise the Lord
[57:46] he's like I'm not able to redeem it you
[57:48] do it so boy takes off his shoe before
[57:50] the others of the gates and that day he
[57:52] redeems the inheritance of Naomi now
[57:56] listen he was not like this first
[57:58] kinsman a man he was not really like he
[58:01] had a field and then he was interested
[58:04] in the land he had land is that right
[58:05] but what he was interested in was the
[58:08] bride that come with it is that right
[58:11] listen our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[58:13] he died to pay for the sins of the world
[58:15] because he won in the white house not
[58:18] because he wanted North Korea because he
[58:21] wanted a Walmart but there was a bride
[58:23] that come with that inheritance we were
[58:26] the treasure in that field is that right
[58:28] you were the mr. that was hid its Christ
[58:31] in you the hope of glory and the world
[58:34] passes you by and they see a widow woman
[58:36] they see some off scouring the earth but
[58:39] yet in the sight of God you are precious
[58:41] and elect amen the Bible says brother an
[58:44] consider your calling not many noble not
[58:47] many mighty are called is that right but
[58:49] God has chosen the foolish things the
[58:51] basin's yeah the things that are
[58:53] despised to confound the wise to can
[58:57] found the my desire listen God took the
[58:59] very best that he had he took his very
[59:02] inheritance and he gave it to what the
[59:04] very worst of humanity the lowest of the
[59:07] hallelujah couple amens their truth
[59:10] anyhow Paul cities of chief of sinners
[59:13] himself that's how he felt about it
[59:14] listen God give it back to the very best
[59:17] a human had offer but the very worst
[59:20] say ma'am because there is something
[59:21] hidden inside your field
[59:23] there is something hidden inside your
[59:25] vessels that Alright God had a thought
[59:27] of you before the foundation the world
[59:30] look he didn't see you is defeated he
[59:32] didn't see you some sinner some
[59:34] passionate job he saw a sinless virtuous
[59:37] bride of Jesus Christ he said if I got
[59:41] to bite myself hey man I won't tell the
[59:44] devil about I'm not going to tell the
[59:45] world about it but am i hot that church
[59:47] that feels nothing will buy for myself
[59:49] and I'm gonna redeem that inheritance
[59:51] under myself well hallelujah hey
[59:55] remember the time talks about this in
[59:57] the breach between the seal she talks
[59:58] about this girl or god it's the word for
[1:00:01] Redeemer amen
[1:00:02] but Isis fulfilling though the Word of
[1:00:05] God
[1:00:06] I'll the right of redemption is the
[1:00:07] Redeemer amen and our Redeemer did the
[1:00:11] same thing now I want you to watch this
[1:00:12] because we're talking bout two laws a
[1:00:13] lot of life and a lot of death amen
[1:00:16] because this word girl has a compound
[1:00:19] meaning as well what is a meaning of
[1:00:21] life as a redemption but the same word
[1:00:24] appears in the scripture as an Avenger
[1:00:26] of the blood when you read Deuteronomy
[1:00:28] 19 the bottle is out the supremacist a
[1:00:30] man that if a man would arise that
[1:00:32] listen let's say we're out in the field
[1:00:33] one day and brother browning I are
[1:00:35] working all sudden his he says you know
[1:00:37] I don't I don't like brother Alex very
[1:00:39] much he just he just whacks me in the
[1:00:41] back head and I drop dead I don't know
[1:00:43] why he would do that let's say he goes
[1:00:45] and does that hey man my mine near
[1:00:47] kinsman is required as an Avenger oh
[1:00:49] girl same day who is a redeemer in one
[1:00:52] instance is an Avenger in the other he's
[1:00:54] required by the law to raise up and find
[1:00:57] vengeance for me hey man because that's
[1:01:01] what the law required so the same word
[1:01:03] for redeemer is the same for an Avenger
[1:01:06] is that right now Christ is the Avenger
[1:01:08] of the but is that right he's the
[1:01:09] Avenger of the brother and the vengeance
[1:01:11] is mine saith the Lord
[1:01:12] and going all kinds of scriptures about
[1:01:14] this revelations chapter 19 verse 2 says
[1:01:16] were true and righteous are his
[1:01:18] judgments for he have judged the great
[1:01:20] which did corrupt the earth with
[1:01:21] her fornication and hath avenged the
[1:01:25] blood of his servants at her hand hey
[1:01:28] men listen I found something out my life
[1:01:30] while ago I found out God can fight a
[1:01:32] battle a lot better than I can
[1:01:35] it's the truth it's alright I'll tell
[1:01:37] you what when I was a sinner I used to
[1:01:38] try to get my own way a man I'm gonna
[1:01:40] get back at this guy I'm gonna do this
[1:01:42] I'm gonna do that but I found that God
[1:01:44] fights battles a lot better than I do is
[1:01:46] you just silly let God deal with the
[1:01:47] problem in man God knows exactly how to
[1:01:50] rectify a situation he knows exactly how
[1:01:52] to bring your enemy to its knees amen so
[1:01:57] now you have an Avenger tonight and your
[1:01:59] Avenger is also a gun a Redeemer as well
[1:02:03] amen it's a lot of life and the law of
[1:02:05] death amen now we're talking with the
[1:02:08] landmark tonight because we're talking
[1:02:10] about this scripture I hope this is all
[1:02:11] right as I just kind of lay a foundation
[1:02:13] tonight but in this place where they had
[1:02:15] the Redeemer and they had the right of
[1:02:17] redemption and they had these different
[1:02:18] things they'll out the cities of refuge
[1:02:20] and this pertains to their Redeemer a
[1:02:22] man there was six cities of refuge laid
[1:02:24] out and Deuteronomy 19 and the purpose
[1:02:27] of these was this let's go back to the
[1:02:28] original story and this time he's
[1:02:30] swinging a golf club and the Bible uses
[1:02:32] an axes example whatever be and he's not
[1:02:35] meaning to do anything and the axe head
[1:02:37] flies off and strikes me that had not
[1:02:39] died now he didn't mean to kill me
[1:02:40] didn't mean to do it is that right it
[1:02:42] was an accident but yet there's an
[1:02:44] Avenger that's required to come after
[1:02:46] him so his only recourse is to flee to
[1:02:49] one of these cities of refuge amen if a
[1:02:51] man was innocent and his cause he was
[1:02:54] not really he didn't mean to do it
[1:02:55] though he was he was outwardly guilty
[1:02:58] though it looked like he was guilty of a
[1:02:59] crime he could flee to one of these six
[1:03:02] cities of refuge and when he would go
[1:03:05] out now Brooklyn I like high dramatized
[1:03:06] this he says you might be he might be
[1:03:08] heading towards that city refuge he's
[1:03:10] looking on every rock he's looking
[1:03:11] around every tree because there's an
[1:03:13] enemy knows there's an Avenger that's
[1:03:15] hard to get him there's a pressure that
[1:03:17] comes with that but once it comes into
[1:03:19] that city of refuge all the pressure is
[1:03:21] gone
[1:03:22] he knows he's safe from the Avenger
[1:03:24] livens you cannot touch him or take his
[1:03:26] alive when it comes to that City of
[1:03:29] Refuge a man and program said so does
[1:03:31] today we have a City of Refuge there was
[1:03:34] people in the world they didn't mean to
[1:03:36] be sinners they were born in sin they
[1:03:38] were shaped in the neck they didn't mean
[1:03:40] to do those things but God has given us
[1:03:42] a refuge God has given us a way of
[1:03:44] escape from the Avenged
[1:03:46] Christ has not appointed us unto wrath
[1:03:49] but to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ
[1:03:52] is that right who's been sent off that
[1:03:54] man to come to the city he had to plead
[1:03:56] his cause before the gate and if that
[1:03:58] man lied office if he was lied he come
[1:04:00] there by false pretence he said it did
[1:04:02] not matter if that man clung to the very
[1:04:04] horns of the altar then Avenger could
[1:04:06] come in and drag him on the street and
[1:04:09] slay him is that right he says but if he
[1:04:11] was innocent his cause was found just
[1:04:13] before the other that muncher could not
[1:04:16] come in and could not take his life well
[1:04:18] I believe we have a refuge today brother
[1:04:20] Branham said is that right we've got a
[1:04:22] place for people that don't mean to do
[1:04:23] wrong but they've got a place where they
[1:04:25] can let off the pressure it's in Christ
[1:04:28] amen and that beautiful we got a place
[1:04:30] where we don't have to pretend and then
[1:04:33] we don't have to try to be something you
[1:04:35] just are you just are the Ridhima man so
[1:04:38] many Christians struggle trying to be
[1:04:40] something amen
[1:04:41] but listen just be who you are you are
[1:04:43] the redeemed you are the redeemed of God
[1:04:46] you are the Bride of Christ you are the
[1:04:48] saved you're the viewer the inheritance
[1:04:51] that he saw is that right well praise
[1:04:53] the Lord amen
[1:04:55] there's a City of Refuge today how do
[1:04:57] you get into it well by one spirit we're
[1:04:59] all baptized into one body is that right
[1:05:02] praise the Lord somebody now I talked
[1:05:05] about this inheritance I'm coming to a
[1:05:06] thought with this I want you understand
[1:05:08] this inheritance God lays out the cities
[1:05:11] of refuge anyways all these rules about
[1:05:12] the inheritance and there's a reason
[1:05:15] he's doing this because this is
[1:05:16] inheritance it's not like something that
[1:05:18] you you know you bought in the paper and
[1:05:20] you're gonna leave it to your kids and
[1:05:21] and you know six months after you die
[1:05:23] they're gonna squander it all like some
[1:05:25] people's inheritance amen you see that
[1:05:27] is that right the Bible talks about that
[1:05:28] in the book of Ecclesiastes out a man
[1:05:30] let well it's only just spending is that
[1:05:32] right this inheritance is not like that
[1:05:35] this was to be an everlasting
[1:05:36] inheritance to all generations and so
[1:05:40] God is very particular about this
[1:05:41] inheritance because if I have an
[1:05:43] inheritance in this promised land that
[1:05:46] might shouldn't have that inheritance
[1:05:48] and their children after them will have
[1:05:49] that inheritance and there shall not for
[1:05:51] them will have the same inheritance look
[1:05:54] sold into slavery that I'm not going to
[1:05:56] dad yet every 50 years there's a Jubilee
[1:05:58] and if the sounding of the Jubilee they
[1:06:00] can return to their original inheritance
[1:06:03] it did not matter what was over their
[1:06:04] head or what their condition was an
[1:06:07] inheritance belong to those people
[1:06:09] forever and then listen I believe God
[1:06:11] has given us an inheritance I don't
[1:06:13] think was just for a day gone by I don't
[1:06:15] believe this Pentecostal blessing was
[1:06:17] just for one church age I believe it
[1:06:19] promises this Bible or just for another
[1:06:21] day amen
[1:06:22] I believe it's to all God's people for
[1:06:24] all generations the Bible says every
[1:06:25] ever promise of God in him is yay and
[1:06:28] ever promised amen is that right if you
[1:06:31] come into Christ if you've come into
[1:06:33] your city of refuge your place of an
[1:06:35] inheritance night these redemptive
[1:06:37] promises belong to you just as much so
[1:06:40] they belong to Moses as much as it along
[1:06:43] to lies if not more
[1:06:44] you've got more revealed today than they
[1:06:46] had is that right well hallelujah the
[1:06:50] Apostle Paul said we're looking for your
[1:06:51] glass darkly but then he said in one
[1:06:53] hour a day
[1:06:54] he said face to face what has happened
[1:06:56] to us a man has come and turned on the
[1:06:59] light is that right the working changed
[1:07:01] the mayor didn't change but when the
[1:07:02] truth is vindicated it becomes lies
[1:07:05] we have vindicated word come and light
[1:07:08] is shined upon this word that these
[1:07:10] promises that are still the same with an
[1:07:12] appropriate realization by this
[1:07:14] revelation of what belongs to us today
[1:07:17] we're not guessing we're not probing God
[1:07:20] has declared it to us here the Prophet
[1:07:22] Malachi 4 is that right well hallelujah
[1:07:26] praise the Lord no matter what condition
[1:07:28] you were in when you heard the Jubilee
[1:07:30] you could go back to the original
[1:07:32] inheritance that your father set as
[1:07:35] misses don't remove the extra lemma
[1:07:36] which thy fathers have set what in
[1:07:39] Malachi come to do restore the hearts of
[1:07:41] the children to their fathers is that
[1:07:44] right the landmark was not to be moved
[1:07:46] that your fathers had said Amen well
[1:07:50] praise the Lord you dorami
[1:07:51] in chapter 19 verse 14 says thou shalt
[1:07:54] not remove thy neighbor's landmark which
[1:07:57] they have old time
[1:07:58] Amen I like the hat which they've all
[1:08:01] done of setting them inheritance which
[1:08:03] thou shun hair
[1:08:04] and that the LORD thy God giveth me to
[1:08:06] possess today man so when these people
[1:08:08] come into this land and they built Lee
[1:08:10] cities a refuge and then do all these
[1:08:11] things they would come to their
[1:08:13] inheritance and for them to know it
[1:08:15] doesn't listen like I said this
[1:08:17] inheritance this is gonna go on for
[1:08:18] awhile by the grace of God and so for
[1:08:21] them to know what belong to them he said
[1:08:23] I want you to go to your land and sell
[1:08:25] some landmarks once you go to the edge
[1:08:27] your property and put some landmark
[1:08:29] there and want you to go over here and
[1:08:31] find the edge of your property and maybe
[1:08:32] pop some stones up here let me drop a
[1:08:35] staking over here never got that amen I
[1:08:37] remember my daddy was literally bought
[1:08:38] new property they had won them big it
[1:08:40] wasn't rebar one of them big ball sticks
[1:08:42] they driving the ground they men and you
[1:08:45] knew when the farmer hit your tree he
[1:08:46] crossed your property line cuz you knew
[1:08:49] exactly where his land and his land
[1:08:50] ended and where yours began is all right
[1:08:52] it's a landmark well they didn't have
[1:08:54] GPS in google.com back then that's how
[1:08:57] they knew they put landmarks up so they
[1:08:59] said don't remove these landmarks now is
[1:09:02] that right
[1:09:03] in fact blood in this Bible in the book
[1:09:05] of Deuteronomy he pronounces a curse on
[1:09:08] those that would move the landmark now
[1:09:10] why is that because when you move this
[1:09:13] landmark
[1:09:14] you're not just robbing your neighbor
[1:09:15] you're robbing his children you're
[1:09:18] robbing his children's children you're
[1:09:20] robbing every generation afterward amen
[1:09:22] it's just like murder you're not just
[1:09:24] killing the man but every child that
[1:09:26] that man would have afterwards he's
[1:09:28] thinking about Abel every child that was
[1:09:30] in him by potential died when he died is
[1:09:33] that right
[1:09:35] he meant somebody is this water praise
[1:09:38] the Lord I'm getting me some water here
[1:09:39] excuse me amen
[1:09:42] so the danger these landmarks a man was
[1:09:45] that they could be moved so God
[1:09:46] pronounces a curse on them that would
[1:09:48] move the landmark thank you Lord and
[1:09:51] even up to the time the 10th in the New
[1:09:53] Testament the Roman government had
[1:09:55] penalties they still use landmarks then
[1:09:57] that place penalties on those that would
[1:10:00] move the landmarks so the system existed
[1:10:01] for thousands of years amen and so we
[1:10:04] look at these atop my landmark tonight
[1:10:06] and the inheritance and the danger is
[1:10:08] this look the penalty was very severe
[1:10:11] you understand the cursing and the
[1:10:13] penalty from whether moving the
[1:10:14] landmark was very severe so he was the
[1:10:18] danger that you had to watch out for if
[1:10:20] I wouldn't to take your landmark and I
[1:10:22] wanted to move it I'm not gonna get a
[1:10:24] bulldozer and moving a mile down the
[1:10:25] road
[1:10:26] hey man I'm not gonna get it and try to
[1:10:30] move it all the way down the road if
[1:10:32] this is your landmark on your property
[1:10:34] and I want to steal I'm saying man I
[1:10:36] don't want to get caught you know what
[1:10:37] I'm gonna do them I go out there I'm
[1:10:38] going this I'm gonna go I'm gonna go off
[1:10:42] for a while I like to the grass grows up
[1:10:44] and all the weeds cover it and you don't
[1:10:46] know any different and you go out there
[1:10:48] look one day so it looks like it's the
[1:10:49] same spot and you go off wrong here
[1:10:51] comes a thief and he does it again now
[1:10:53] listen inches turn into feet and after a
[1:10:56] while featuring in two miles the yards
[1:10:58] turn the miles is that right after a
[1:11:00] while this you know 40 50 years because
[1:11:02] remember this is each generation and
[1:11:04] before you know you wanted you might
[1:11:06] have your generation have another thief
[1:11:08] rise up your sons a thief and they keep
[1:11:11] doing this and after 40 50 60 years amen
[1:11:14] the landmark isn't even anywhere where
[1:11:16] it used to be what it used to look like
[1:11:20] what's your heritage used to look like
[1:11:22] and what it looks like today they not
[1:11:25] even in the same ballpark now listen
[1:11:27] that didn't happen overnight it was just
[1:11:31] a little bit of the time just a little
[1:11:33] bit of the time he moves it a little bit
[1:11:36] that's what a thief with new lead screws
[1:11:37] in a little bit at a time you realize
[1:11:39] when the serpent come in the garden and
[1:11:41] Teplin
[1:11:41] he did throughout the whole thing that
[1:11:43] God said he didn't say oh god don't know
[1:11:46] what he's talking about God's a big ol
[1:11:47] liar no I said one thing is it all
[1:11:49] surely you shall not die just a little
[1:11:52] bit Oh God knows you shall not surely
[1:11:55] die hey man he knows that you'll be as
[1:11:58] gods all right listen it looks so
[1:12:00] inviting gonna look so subtle it didn't
[1:12:05] seem sinister at all but what it does it
[1:12:07] causes death hey man the inheritance of
[1:12:10] life passed away from every generation
[1:12:13] born from Adam is that right
[1:12:15] and then Adam we all died because a
[1:12:17] wooden three-letter word hey man listen
[1:12:20] what happened to human worries they
[1:12:22] forfeited something they were robbed is
[1:12:24] that right the thief comes to steal kill
[1:12:26] destroy
[1:12:27] hey man somebody well praise the Lord
[1:12:29] that's the truth listen if you had this
[1:12:32] inheritance and you had this land I hope
[1:12:34] you said I'm coming with us tonight amen
[1:12:35] because I'm coming somewhere real quick
[1:12:36] saying man if you had an inheritance and
[1:12:39] your daddy left you something in your
[1:12:41] daddy's that he left you something and
[1:12:42] you had an inheritance in the land there
[1:12:44] was only one way to make sure you
[1:12:46] weren't gonna get robbed you had to go
[1:12:48] back check the landmark not once a year
[1:12:51] not once a revival meeting not when it
[1:12:55] was convenient but you had to go back
[1:12:57] and check it every week maybe maybe
[1:12:59] every day is that right listen if you
[1:13:01] let it go long enough of the grass grows
[1:13:03] up and all the thorns and the thistles
[1:13:05] and weeds start descending you don't
[1:13:07] miss something amen you've got to go
[1:13:09] back and you've got to check it and
[1:13:11] you've got to examine it all the time
[1:13:13] listen it's not enough to go and check
[1:13:15] it when it's convenient hey man I'm not
[1:13:18] gonna check it when you feel like it
[1:13:20] amen you've got to go back and look at
[1:13:22] that landmark every day maybe if you've
[1:13:25] got a thief lived next to you especially
[1:13:26] you've got to make sure it's in the same
[1:13:29] spot because if it's not you're not the
[1:13:31] only one getting robbed
[1:13:32] he'll coming to rob your children he'll
[1:13:34] coming to rob your peace from your home
[1:13:36] he'll come and take your joy to come and
[1:13:38] take your healing from you is that right
[1:13:39] you see where I'm coming tonight
[1:13:41] we've got landmarks we've got a better
[1:13:44] landmark we've got a better system amen
[1:13:46] we're heirs of God with joint heirs with
[1:13:49] Christ and this Bibles give us exceeding
[1:13:52] great and precious promises whereby we
[1:13:55] are made partakers of the divine nature
[1:13:56] amen these landmarks these promises your
[1:14:00] landmark you can read this Bible tonight
[1:14:02] I don't have to tell you about it you
[1:14:04] can go home and if you can read you can
[1:14:06] read for yourself exactly what belongs
[1:14:08] to you
[1:14:09] he can read Isaiah 53 so you know with
[1:14:11] the scribes
[1:14:12] I'm already healed you can go and read
[1:14:16] in the Bible he said I'm the Lord that
[1:14:17] healeth thee I can do all things through
[1:14:20] Christ who strengthens me listen you've
[1:14:22] got landmarks tonight it tells you
[1:14:24] exactly what belongs to you it's laid
[1:14:27] out for you and your inheritance unless
[1:14:29] I don't move these promises we're just
[1:14:31] for our Pentecostal forefathers I
[1:14:33] believe as every generation afterwards
[1:14:35] am
[1:14:36] I belongs to the people of God today
[1:14:38] we've got inheritance tonight we've got
[1:14:41] landmarks in the land that tell us what
[1:14:43] belongs to us amen
[1:14:45] well I tell you what it's joy
[1:14:47] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:14:49] hey man it's the manifestation of the
[1:14:51] Spirit its authority and power and the
[1:14:54] children of God hallelujah what praise
[1:14:58] the Lord
[1:14:58] it's the truth tonight is that right
[1:15:00] we've got so much that we possess and
[1:15:03] what the devil would love to do what he
[1:15:05] wants to do is that right listen it's
[1:15:07] just like this country you look at the
[1:15:09] laws as country's fallen upon and what
[1:15:11] it is today and it don't look today like
[1:15:13] what it used to look like it didn't
[1:15:14] happen overnight it was one little
[1:15:17] change one little compromise one little
[1:15:19] thing at a time
[1:15:20] a woman can walk down the street today
[1:15:22] that has thrown her in the insane
[1:15:23] institution 100 years ago for dressing
[1:15:25] the way she does but today it's
[1:15:27] acceptable and then you walk down the
[1:15:30] street with a dress long hair and they
[1:15:32] looked at you like you're the crazy one
[1:15:35] it's the truth what happened you didn't
[1:15:37] happen overnight but somewhere the devil
[1:15:40] snuck in he's certain moving the
[1:15:42] landmark just a little bit through
[1:15:43] Hollywood your popular opinion through
[1:15:46] men's ideas he moved the landmark a
[1:15:49] little bad
[1:15:50] I used to marvel when I when I first got
[1:15:52] converted and I read the book of Judges
[1:15:55] that generation had passed since Josh
[1:15:58] will come in the promised land and they
[1:16:00] already knew not God and I thought to
[1:16:02] myself how is this possible how could a
[1:16:04] generation you're so far away from not
[1:16:06] what I've seen with my own eyes this
[1:16:08] country had a prophet I've indicated
[1:16:11] ministry on the face of the earth but
[1:16:13] they rejected by the rest of 1956 they
[1:16:16] rejected this gospel and where are they
[1:16:18] but 40 50 years later they're plumb on
[1:16:21] the other side of insanity amen
[1:16:23] I have to think of myself with the band
[1:16:26] said they go completely insane if you
[1:16:28] were sitting in that meeting what would
[1:16:29] you think might happen brother branham
[1:16:31] ever what's he meaning completely insane
[1:16:33] let's try a man Moses just exaggerated
[1:16:37] wouldn't be completely insane man they
[1:16:38] don't know a bathroom he is now
[1:16:41] hey man they can't tell their left him
[1:16:44] from the right it's the truth brothers
[1:16:47] and sisters they don't know where
[1:16:49] they're at
[1:16:50] what is it they've gone insane the
[1:16:52] landmarks move so much that's what
[1:16:54] happens when they let you before our
[1:16:55] before long you're not even in your
[1:16:57] original land you're like man what is
[1:16:59] this I don't remember this being here
[1:17:01] what's this tree over here about man
[1:17:03] you're not even in the same land anymore
[1:17:06] hey man somebody well it's the truth
[1:17:09] hey man what happened it didn't change
[1:17:11] overnight this is the devil he doesn't
[1:17:13] try to come and Rob us overnight and
[1:17:15] this is why I'm during the street or not
[1:17:16] because I want you to think about this
[1:17:18] the devil's not gonna try and Rob us
[1:17:19] like that tonight because he knows we
[1:17:22] know better and then he's not gonna come
[1:17:24] up you see this whole Bible's wrong hey
[1:17:27] man this whole Bible is just a bunch of
[1:17:28] nonsense it's a bunch of hogwash and
[1:17:31] quit believing this Bible that's
[1:17:32] something he comes to you amen but what
[1:17:34] he's gonna do is gonna try and move one
[1:17:35] little landmark at a time one little
[1:17:37] scripture well you out God is the same
[1:17:39] yeah Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:17:41] today and forever but just not in this
[1:17:44] way not in that way
[1:17:46] we have God used to do those things but
[1:17:49] he don't do that no more but he's not
[1:17:52] trying to throw it all on at once we'll
[1:17:54] get you to move one little scripts at a
[1:17:56] time and then it move you another
[1:17:57] scripture and it move you another
[1:17:59] promise before you know it amen you look
[1:18:02] at Christian they come to church and
[1:18:03] they get saved through the Holy Ghost
[1:18:06] and God the Son in their life but the
[1:18:08] devil begins to work in their home he
[1:18:10] works through their circumstances and
[1:18:11] maybe their family maybe their job
[1:18:13] whatever be and after a while they begin
[1:18:15] to lose the things are used to have but
[1:18:17] be didn't happen overnight but they get
[1:18:19] to set the plays 20 30 40 years down the
[1:18:22] line where they don't even look like
[1:18:24] what it used to look like what happened
[1:18:26] the devil stole something from you well
[1:18:29] hallelujah hey man I tell you what I
[1:18:33] believe in the power of God amen
[1:18:35] listen we've got landmarks tonight hey
[1:18:38] listen the Apostle Peter lead on the
[1:18:39] landmark of the day of Pentecost they
[1:18:41] said what must we do to be saved
[1:18:44] he said I'm allowed a landmark for you
[1:18:45] God give me the keys of the kingdom so
[1:18:47] here's what you're gonna do repent and
[1:18:49] be baptized every one of you in the
[1:18:52] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:18:55] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:18:58] Holy Ghost who's the devil up to come
[1:19:00] and tell you well that was from Batman
[1:19:02] but Peter wrote on that same landmark no

[1:28:37] can look at all these things will you
[1:28:38] look at people that are losing their
[1:28:39] inheritance we can look at people that
[1:28:42] once stood for this message and they
[1:28:44] were walked away we can look at all
[1:28:46] these things and we've got to make a
[1:28:47] decision or we're gonna give in to or
[1:28:50] we're gonna stand on the Word of God
[1:28:51] just let me tell you when I look at
[1:28:54] these things and I look at people giving
[1:28:56] up I look at people falling away that
[1:28:57] doesn't discourage my face
[1:28:59] hey man that just gives me one more
[1:29:01] reason to go hon I said this person
[1:29:03] don't want to serve God if this person
[1:29:05] don't want to believe the message I'm
[1:29:06] gonna believe anyhow you can choose this
[1:29:09] day which gods you want to serve but as
[1:29:11] for me and my house we're gonna serve
[1:29:13] the Lord we're gonna walk in this
[1:29:15] inheritance this is what I'm gonna make
[1:29:17] my stand amen amen praise the Lord while
[1:29:21] I was reading the story that I hope this
[1:29:22] is all right it's about these two
[1:29:23] brothers they're identical twins and
[1:29:25] their father was an alcoholic and he
[1:29:28] grew up an alcoholic he had these two
[1:29:30] boys and he died because of that whole
[1:29:32] ism and one of his sons become an
[1:29:33] alcoholic as well and one did not become
[1:29:36] another identical twins but yet ones are
[1:29:38] not walking one is not hot that's one
[1:29:40] that becoming alcohol why did you become
[1:29:42] an alcoholic he said because my father
[1:29:44] was an alcoholic
[1:29:48] it wasn't drunkard he said why didn't
[1:29:51] you become a llama hogs it because my
[1:29:52] father was an alcoholic hey man listen
[1:29:57] to people the same thought but a
[1:29:59] completely different response one saw
[1:30:02] his father's not always an excuse to
[1:30:04] become one and once all the need to rise
[1:30:06] above it a man listen I don't look at
[1:30:09] these things I don't look at the
[1:30:10] discouragement and people falling away
[1:30:12] and say you know what I might as well
[1:30:14] just give up my mom will just fold no I
[1:30:17] said you know I'm not gonna allow that
[1:30:19] to happen a man by the grace of God
[1:30:21] listen not you it's not my mind it's not
[1:30:23] my power but by the spirit a man can we
[1:30:27] let his spirit have Liberty in our lives
[1:30:30] like when we first got saved or if we
[1:30:33] got too formal in our ideas have we
[1:30:35] gotten too dignified in our worship or
[1:30:37] could he still have the same Liberty
[1:30:39] that he can have it or laugh like that
[1:30:41] first night when I got saved
[1:30:43] amen Oh God can I surrender tonight like
[1:30:47] I did back there or I let things creep
[1:30:50] in hey man where the remm talks about
[1:30:54] this and the sermon all of the hours
[1:30:56] come times about Jehoshaphat said
[1:30:57] jehosophat looked at his forefather
[1:30:59] David and how he served God and the
[1:31:02] blessing of God was life and looked at
[1:31:04] Ahab of course you know I have he died
[1:31:05] even I believe when I was alive and how
[1:31:07] he disobeyed he didn't he didn't walk
[1:31:09] after the ways of David he saw one beam
[1:31:11] blast so one being
[1:31:12] first and brother message Jehoshaphat he
[1:31:15] made a decision to walk in the ways of
[1:31:18] his father David is that right
[1:31:21] hey man I made a decision to go hey
[1:31:24] brother man says he made a decision go
[1:31:26] back to the old landmark that David had
[1:31:28] said he said God blessed him God will
[1:31:32] bless anyone who go back to the old
[1:31:34] landmark of the Bible and start from the
[1:31:37] Bible
[1:31:37] not according to theology but or some
[1:31:40] man-made theology from true Bible
[1:31:42] theology and start from the old landmark
[1:31:45] and move up God will move with you I'll
[1:31:49] tell you what that just that makes me
[1:31:51] feel pretty good amen
[1:31:52] to know that if I moved he's gonna move
[1:31:54] with me amen
[1:31:56] cuz that's what I'm looking for tonight
[1:31:57] I'm not looking for me with God
[1:31:59] I'm looking to be a move of God I'm
[1:32:01] looking to know that when I move God
[1:32:03] moves with me as I write I can see the
[1:32:05] rustling in the mulberry trees the wind
[1:32:08] blowing through my life and I'm aware
[1:32:10] that there's a witness of the Spirit
[1:32:12] that God is doing something to me and I
[1:32:14] couldn't do not just 10 years ago but
[1:32:17] tonight in this place but that same God
[1:32:20] that visited me that spoke to me that
[1:32:24] preserved my life he's still the same
[1:32:26] God in my life tonight he's still number
[1:32:29] one in my life he still can tell me what
[1:32:33] he wants and I'll say yes Lord amen Lord
[1:32:36] I don't care what the world says I'm not
[1:32:38] worried about what other people think
[1:32:40] I just from me in my house we're still
[1:32:42] gonna serve the Lord no matter of ten
[1:32:46] years go by 20 years go by

[1:40:00] stay I don't feel like moving her back
[1:40:02] no I'd be moving back right away hey he
[1:40:07] said but what if your neighbor finds out
[1:40:08] he's the bad guy but you know what I
[1:40:10] understand sometimes it's his word
[1:40:13] against yours but you know what the
[1:40:14] scripture give a remedy for that you
[1:40:15] know that powers chapter 20 verse 10
[1:40:18] does remove not do a landmark and
[1:40:20] they're not in the fields of the
[1:40:21] fatherless for their Redeemer your goal
[1:40:25] your Avenger the Redeemer is mighty he
[1:40:30] shall plead their cause listen if the
[1:40:34] natural Redeemer was mighty listen if he
[1:40:37] found out if your brother found out

[1:40:42] know what he day went gird his sword on
[1:40:44] his waist we walk over your property and
[1:40:46] so you know what we're putting up with
[1:40:48] this devil one that we're gonna go and
[1:40:51] we're gonna take back the land and we're
[1:40:53] gonna get back everything but the devil
[1:40:55] stole from us
[1:40:56] we're not leaving a hook behind we're
[1:40:59] not giving one inch to the devil we're
[1:41:02] gonna take it all back maybe you come

[1:41:07] sword because that man who robbed you he
[1:41:09] was a curse over his life Who am I
[1:41:13] that's just a natural listen I believe
[1:41:16] we've got landmarks tonight Moses
[1:41:18] pronounced a curse amen praise the Lord
[1:41:24] pronounced a curse on them that moved
[1:41:26] the landmark but how much more when a
[1:41:28] man stands in the pulp X he tries to
[1:41:31] move the landmark of this word and then
[1:41:33] the Apostle Paul said their curse to
[1:41:35] another man comes and preacher the
[1:41:37] gospel that I've preached let him be
[1:41:40] accursed what is it you've got a
[1:41:43] redeemer
[1:41:43] he's mightier than your brother next
[1:41:45] door he's minor than the police officer
[1:41:48] down the street or the sheriff you've
[1:41:50] got a redeemer that's the very creator
[1:41:52] of heaven
[1:41:55] but I want it saved your soul and silly
[1:41:58] with a baptism of the Holy Ghost here's
[1:42:00] the Avenger and the redeem of your
[1:42:02] inheritance tonight if you come to your
[1:42:06] inheritance in you tonight so you know
[1:42:08] what I feel for the Devils are robbing
[1:42:09] me somewhere I feel like I'm not living
[1:42:11] where I'm supposed to live I guess what
[1:42:13] you don't have to go back and take it by
[1:42:15] yourself you just call up your redeemer
[1:42:17] he's mighty to plead your cause I tell
[1:42:24] you I had to calm it right away
[1:42:26] Shh I'd be letting Hill you know what I
[1:42:29] believe something's wrong I want to live
[1:42:31] in my inheritance amen that natural
[1:42:35] Redeemer was that mighty how much more
[1:42:38] this Redeemer it's giving us authority
[1:42:40] he's given us power is that right
[1:42:42] whoever says this in perfect faith is
[1:42:44] could you compare a Christian today with
[1:42:47] him Christians of long ago how them
[1:42:49] disciples walked and the power of the
[1:42:51] Spirit moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:42:54] just the prisoners I preached the other
[1:42:55] night a prisoner to the word and will of
[1:42:57] God he couldn't even move until God
[1:43:00] moved him is would you like to see a
[1:43:02] church rise like that he said it's going
[1:43:04] to it's going back it's got to come it's
[1:43:07] on the road now I believe let me hope
[1:43:09] this isn't some presumptuous tonight but
[1:43:12] I'd like to get except for the night I
[1:43:13] believe it's here now
[1:43:14] I believe I'm looking at it tonight hey

[1:43:23] their sword and then put on the whole
[1:43:25] armour of God they're not here for a
[1:43:27] picnic they're not here for a walk in
[1:43:30] the park they're ready for battle this
[1:43:32] is the greatest battle ever fought and

[1:43:36] the task because I've equipped you with
[1:43:38] my spirit and my word now you've got
[1:43:43] people to night

[1:43:54] is here he's here tonight to help you
[1:43:57] take back everything let me say
[1:44:01] everything everything that the devil has
[1:44:03] taken from you listen he's a squatter it
[1:44:06] don't belong
[1:44:07] yeah well praise the Lord hope that's
[1:44:12] alright tonight no brother I said we put
[1:44:13] too much stress on the mechanics and
[1:44:15] nothing on the dynamics that's true is
[1:44:17] that right we could talk a good talk we
[1:44:19] can talk about this word but where is it
[1:44:21] at in our life well we know that's what
[1:44:25] it is we were afraid of what people say
[1:44:27] about us well then hey just the Holy
[1:44:29] Roller that's all they are well I'm
[1:44:31] gonna tell you what the Prophet said he
[1:44:32] said I ain't never seen a Holy Roller
[1:44:33] yet

[1:44:38] well you're just getting fanatical I
[1:44:41] don't know about you but I got a reason
[1:44:43] to praise God I got a reason to rejoice
[1:44:46] well I can show you by science if you're
[1:44:49] something a lot of motion is dead is
[1:44:52] that right if your religion ain't got no
[1:44:54] motion go go bury it somewhere because
[1:44:56] it's dead I mean look I'm not saying I'm
[1:44:58] not interested in a dead religion
[1:44:59] another shouldn't dead letter tonight I
[1:45:02] want to see the power that pulsation of
[1:45:05] the Spirit
[1:45:06] in my life I believe I have but I want
[1:45:09] to see it again tonight I want to see
[1:45:11] the great away when I wake up tomorrow
[1:45:12] I'm gonna see it again I want to see it
[1:45:14] after that again and again and again
[1:45:18] that's how I feel about it
[1:45:20] I don't believe that it's just gonna
[1:45:21] write another book of Acts I believe
[1:45:23] what's going on right now I think that
[1:45:24] churches here right now but can we
[1:45:26] believe that man we're always putting
[1:45:29] that off to somewhere else that's what
[1:45:32] man does he always looks at what God is
[1:45:34] going to do and looks back at what God
[1:45:36] has done and he misses don't miss it
[1:45:38] tonight I pray look at me anything
[1:45:40] special about me or you as human beings

[1:45:46] because it's his will to do it listen
[1:45:48] God wants to bless you so much more than
[1:45:51] you want it

[1:45:57] life God's had to show me time and time

[1:46:02] if you want the Holy Ghost God wants to
[1:46:04] give up t more than you want it hey man
[1:46:07] we live so far below our privileges
[1:46:09] because we think we're being humble
[1:46:10] we're not we're just being dumb that's
[1:46:15] what it is but if you know praise the
[1:46:18] Lord it's actually pride
[1:46:20] actually what it is we think it's
[1:46:22] humility but it's actually pride one
[1:46:24] because we think we know better than God
[1:46:25] and two because we think we don't need
[1:46:27] his help
[1:46:29] well God humble some of us tonight amen
[1:46:32] hey man I believe to not hate well the

[2:07:03] but
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:11] something
[2:07:12] [Music]
[2:07:34] I may appreciate the Lord tonight you
[2:07:39] know I think the Lord has just really
[2:07:42] been very clear tonight we can know a
[2:07:44] lot about the word but if we don't know
[2:07:48] the author then the word is powerless
[2:07:51] but the author is what gives the word
[2:07:53] power because then you can begin you
[2:07:57] look and you you see what belongs to you
[2:08:00] now you know the enemy he's never
[2:08:03] setting back but as if I think it was
[2:08:05] clearly trade here tonight how that
[2:08:09] things can move so so subtly and try to
[2:08:12] move the landmarks now you know this is
[2:08:15] a when you look at the things that we
[2:08:18] have now we don't have rocks in our yard
[2:08:20] some people will plant a tree they'll
[2:08:23] plant a bush they'll plant certain
[2:08:25] things but we have those pins that they
[2:08:27] put in the ground I mean you look at
[2:08:30] those pins they put in the ground those
[2:08:31] things can get bent
[2:08:32] somebody can pull them up and they can
[2:08:35] actually pull it up and put it I had
[2:08:36] that happen to me they pulled it up and
[2:08:38] put it in a different place and when
[2:08:41] that happens you know it gets to a place
[2:08:44] that I could look at that pin where they
[2:08:46] moved it and I can think wow I have less
[2:08:49] property but there is a document and
[2:08:52] that document is on file they might have
[2:08:56] moved the pin around here but they
[2:08:57] haven't and cannot alter the document
[2:09:00] there is one who has authority to read
[2:09:03] that document only thing I have to do is
[2:09:06] go and have and make access of that I'll
[2:09:08] go right down to the county and the
[2:09:10] county will pull that document right out
[2:09:12] and it lets me know from this point of
[2:09:14] your property to this point it's this
[2:09:16] such and such a many feet this many feet
[2:09:19] and so many inches I can go right back
[2:09:21] to there and there is authority then I
[2:09:24] can enforce what I know rightfully
[2:09:26] belongs to me you see when you know what
[2:09:29] belongs to you that's authority you've
[2:09:32] got a right to enforce it you can mow
[2:09:34] clear to that line right over there
[2:09:36] because you know that's mine and you
[2:09:39] know what that is that's real Liberty
[2:09:41] that's Liberty you don't have to worry
[2:09:43] am i encroaching on somebody else's land
[2:09:45] that's Liberty that's the same way it is
[2:09:48] within every aspect in every part of our
[2:09:50] lives the enemy would love to and he
[2:09:53] likes to try to encroach but tonight how
[2:09:55] the Holy Spirit has been so clear and
[2:09:57] spoke to us tonight we have a redeemer
[2:10:00] we have a redeemer amen you're born and
[2:10:04] sealed with the Holy Spirit and if
[2:10:06] you're not you can be that's a landmark
[2:10:08] that's a promise for you tonight that is
[2:10:11] the promise that God has given for every
[2:10:14] generation you believe that and every
[2:10:17] promise that we that is there for you
[2:10:20] and I don't let the enemy bring any
[2:10:22] encroachment upon those these are our
[2:10:25] promises that God has given to us and
[2:10:28] the Holy Spirit has come to enforce
[2:10:31] those claims that we have in him you
[2:10:34] believe that amen
[2:10:36] let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight
[2:10:38] amen is before we're being dismissed
[2:10:41] you got a need on your heart just let it
[2:10:44] be known to the Lord Lord Jesus you've
[2:10:48] spoke so so personal to our hearts in
[2:10:51] our lives
[2:10:51] Lord there's not a heart that I would
[2:10:54] say that is gathered in here tonight
[2:10:57] those that Lord that would hear it Lord
[2:11:00] Jesus our hearts are touched Lord what
[2:11:04] encouragement you give to us through
[2:11:07] your word to every heart that would be
[2:11:09] here Lord to hear it to know the Lord
[2:11:11] you are the same God the promise that
[2:11:13] you made you're the same God Lord here
[2:11:17] present to make that promise real to
[2:11:20] every heart in every life lord I pray
[2:11:23] tonight Lord for every heart and every
[2:11:25] hand that Lord is lifted up Lord there's
[2:11:28] things that Lord Jesus that perhaps that
[2:11:30] they can look at Lord and see where
[2:11:32] maybe there's things that have been Lord
[2:11:34] taken from them like was mentioned
[2:11:36] through our brother tonight Lord you
[2:11:38] mentioned about joy you mentioned Lord
[2:11:40] about the prayer life you mention Lord
[2:11:43] about healing you mention Lord about so
[2:11:45] many different areas in so many things
[2:11:48] Lord and I pray tonight to know
[2:11:50] that the Holy Spirit Lord you are so
[2:11:53] personal to where the Lord it's it's
[2:11:55] personal to each of us that Lord that
[2:11:58] it's something that can come before a
[2:12:00] slore to where that we could see Lord if
[2:12:03] there's in any way that there's any
[2:12:05] place or God that has been moved in any
[2:12:08] way and Laura I'm reminded that it's not
[2:12:10] all together Lord something that we look
[2:12:13] at that we're doing or not doing
[2:12:15] sometimes Lord it's simply our attitude
[2:12:18] is out of line Lord sometimes the Lord
[2:12:20] it's it's our heart Lord has become
[2:12:23] filled with other things Lord God in our
[2:12:26] lives Lord to wear that even as your
[2:12:28] prophet would speak about how criticism
[2:12:31] would enter into his own life and he
[2:12:32] would say and declare I'm determined to
[2:12:35] blast my heart out and never have a
[2:12:39] negative fall anymore Lord Jesus you
[2:12:42] know each and every one of my stone and
[2:12:45] to you Lord you are our Redeemer Lord
