one to make mention to you was conversing with brother Scott Walker today and he accepted a job over here a fellowship and he turned down the one in Tennessee God God provides donee well in an atmosphere like this it's hard to tell what will take place it's dangerous god is good at me god is good amen we want to look here in this verse of scripture proverbs 18:22 and then we'll let you have your seats it said whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of the lord amen may God bless His Word and bless you as you're being seated so good to see CH and every one of you and a man just I know the Lord rewards you for your sacrifice many some of you coming straight from work and other places and may God just richly bless you for your labor of love and being here because you you've come here to receive from him that's what we've all come for tonight we love it so literally we love seeing one another we appreciate that we love being in his presence we've come to receive from him tonight and we've not only come to receive but we've also come to give is that right we come to give we come to put our our shoulder to the we'll look a fire in our hearts that God would just come among us in a special way we're looking at this scripture here and when we are looking at it I don't know so much tonight whether I'm gonna preach to preach some things or just teach some things we'll just see how it kind of goes tonight but and when I look at this here in the scripture he who finds a wife we recognized that where we were at when we've been looking at this in the time where God Himself has been taking a people for his namesake among the Gentiles when Joseph was put was put out from among his brethren he was given the Bible says a wife and to know that that is exactly what the Lord Jesus has indeed been given is that of a wife a bride of people out of the Gentiles and then to recognize that as soon as our time is up here which were at the end right now we we don't know it just at any moment you know and I think of it like this you know you know God knows exactly and he's the one that's getting everything in place and in order and I'm so glad that that he is the one that's in our midst and he's the one throughout all of the of the earth that's setting everything in order as a matter of fact brother branham would say it like this regarding the angel of the Lord he said in 1960 in Daniel 70 weeks he said the angel of the Lord is present on earth now getting everything together he was there he's assembling the 144,000 of the Jews and he's also getting the bride in line in an order with the word in order to take us out of here everything itself is heading up within this hour so when we look at this thought that who finds a wife we recognize as it's very clear to us and I believe it should be that when a person when we look in the scriptures the who so here would be that of a man and not just a man but it would be that of a husband one who were those attributes that have laid within him you know like you take a little girl she likes playing house with dolls and you know serving make-believe food and things as long as she starts serving real food when she gets older but you know she starts out with make-believe food you know in the in the kitchens and you know she plays with the dolls and you see those attributes that are already there within her but yet within its season those things that were there will actually come into the time and season of when that purpose is to be brought forth and then when we look at that within the natural we recognize here in the scripture of where we're looking at this it speaks of the season of time that we are living in in this hour because the Lord the Lord Jesus is not taking unto himself a girl or just that of a of a woman he's taking one to himself that she possesses the attributes that he is seeking for because he's going to make his future home and to think of it that it's he himself he already knows what lays within our lives he already knows the season of time that we're in and let's just be her and in that you and I have been sold with that word predestinated seed of God God already has out what is taking place right now is something that God has already laid out in his word it's not something strange or new that he's doing but God is actually fulfilling what he already spoke and so we're in a season and time of fulfillment and it is a blessing to be able that our eyes would be open and you might say I don't see everything but remember don't let the devil get you all scattered about that it's to recognize that first and foremost you see that there is a difference and you recognize that the word in itself this is not just something good to be followed but you recognize that this is the very person of Jesus Christ you recognize that it is the Living God that it comes down and deals with our heart speaks to our lives and moves upon us because a man cannot know these things and I'll say like this even if a man even myself if I knew what your need might be it would be hard-pressed for me to fulfill it even if it's something within the material realm it would be hard-pressed for me to fulfill it but yet within this it takes something that is so much greater than what somebody else can supply it has to be God in order to supply what you and I need and to tell you the truth when God speaks to our hearts and moves on our life you can't explain it you can't explain it and this is exactly where you look at then a man himself would move into this season here to where that there are clear desires and clear objectives that he's wanting that of a woman that would display what is truly in his heart brother brems said it like this in the church and its condition he says you know love you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature loving has to unite with love and a husband and a wife has to love one another if they ever make the grade you know love itself it overlooks a multitude of faults is that right and we're all filled with faults you don't just say my husband or my wife every one of us are filled with false so it requires love to be able to overlook those faults in let's just stay with me a moment it not only takes love to overlook them but even within those folks sometimes the faults itself can just even be in the demeanor that we would take or even in a negative thought way it takes love itself to be projected and manifested and to wash and sanctify and lift us into that place to where what was negative no longer holds us captive what does that love love we'll do that in an in a home between a husband and a wife and that same love that operates between Christ and his beloved bride it elevates you and I into a place that we do not deserve so we can never look at it that we've deserved it but His grace has swept over our life and he says this is what I chose you to be it's just like a seed when any seed can only bring forth after its own kind but Roosevelt says now phase that a family has to love one another if they ever make the grade and he says you search everywhere and you find a girl to be your wife that you love and she searches finding a husband that she could love now I want you to notice the wording here not just trying to find a woman see Jesus remember that the branch el says it like this in Christ a mystery he said he's not revealing his truth to flirter Jesus don't want to flirt he wants somebody that's real somebody that's interested in him simply because of him no matter what he can do for you sure he's a healer he has all things in his disposal but it is not because of that I mean what um nobody in here would say if you looked up on a marriage and you know no doubt there may be some that you could know or think of where you know somebody married somebody simply because of money that ain't love they married not the person they married their bank account come on somebody but you see when you marry the person in no matter what's in that bank account but there is sufficient funds to be deposited in one another's account by love that can be deposited you say where is that account out that's in that bowl of the human heart brother Ram says it is that bowl that's there he said that that within your marriage it must be oil that is put in that bowl now remember oil itself is to be put in daily hello somebody oils got to be put in and continued to put in this is the order that the lights themselves stay burning and don't get nervous we're not just gonna settle them that but I believe with all my heart when we're preaching the Word of God I believe that the word it ought to come down to where we're living not just stay up here in mysteries but the mystery itself when broken it should come down to where the rubber meets the road the puddin is simple is like this to where when you leave you can pack it up in your lunchbox and take it with you she's searching for a wife ha ha ha no let me correct that she's searching for a husband that she can love and God searches trying to find a soul that he can love so he represented himself here on earth as a gentle dove and a gentle lamb and if that lamb would at one moment one minute ever taken on the nature of a snarling wolf that dove would have took her flight immediately she'd have got away because it has to be like nature's to unite now you and I both know it takes god coming by our way just change our nature the Bible says he give us a new heart and a new spirit and the reason of that because we couldn't even get along with ourselves much less anybody else glory be to God now when we look at this here in the scriptures if we open up here in Genesis 2 when we were at last week and I want you just to just to take this in just a moment here in verse 21 it says the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so he's taking from the substance that he's already created so what he's already created now he takes a rib from that substance now to think about it now when he takes from that substance he himself God makes a woman by the living substance that is already present is that right now what now when you look at this after God has brought her forth then he wakes Adam up from the sleep you see Adam God could see something in Adam and say it's not good is that right you said it's not good you know the Bible says it's not good for man to be alone the word alone in the Hebrew and it spelled out it is B ad bad that's what it is you can look it up to be alone is bad that is why he said I will not leave you as orphans I will send to you the comforter the Holy Ghost so that you're not alone though you may walk on your job and you feel alone because of what all you see around you but yet you realize I am NOT alone what it is you don't fit in anywhere here there's been life that's come in here and the life listen now the life coming in is what has brought the separation is that right so it's not good for man to be alone here God is unfolding the mystery within this that how that is he would lay Adams asleep then God brings forth and God makes out of the woman and then God brought her unto the man in the tremendous because the Bible said whoso findeth a woman find a favour with God it don't mean that the man's got to go clear across the other side of the world it means that the husband man who is coming into that season must be fit when he is ready for husband he will then be looking for attributes of wife are you with me that's what he's looking for and that's the same way that when God comes here in this hour he's looking for the attributes of life now you think about it here is Adam himself you know you you know you talk about arranged marriage this is Adams this is Adams choice but Adams choice is God's choice you see he got Adam did not wrestle with it he accepted God's choice and Adam himself now as he he's woke up you know and you realized you and I could say there wasn't nobody else now come on brothers you realize don't want nobody else for you come on brother Brian's got his hand up back there and these they have both of them up I got both of mine on there are nobody else for me is that right so it is just that way because you see a revelation if something that comes personal come on now and it don't keep study don't stop it becomes more real as the days go on now notice Adam he steps up in this time and he says this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of me now look how look how the transitions taking place here in verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother 19 just talking about him moving out of his house y'all go preach with me this ain't just talking about him moving out of his house it is well now that there is an establishing of his house his domain his kingdom very mem he is going to put his influence he is going to be that how there is going to be a domain of which he himself will be the influencer of that domain so here God is letting it be clear there's a transition where that man is transitioning to the role of a husband and one of the roles in transitioning is leaving everything in order to cleave unto his wife this is where the man will find comfort this is where he'll find satisfaction this is where when trouble comes he Cleaves to his wife because she will be a comfort unto him and vice versa remember birth event tells us when fear when things would you know the the you know things would take place there in the garden and he said you know Eve she said oh and Adam would say oh don't worry that's Leo the Lion you see he was one that was placed there that could settle her that's how God set it up now I know let me just deal with this a moment boy we're gonna get somewhere tonight though we're gonna get to her some time but you see sometimes you know we look at things let me say this to you as a man I know this is very simple but as a man sometimes we think just because we said it boom it all changes pow right there well you know what there is a word that comes but remember when a word goes forward there's a season for the word to come to past and there must be an atmosphere pressing to bring conditions in order for that word to be fulfilled that's even there is there in that natural home brother branham just couldn't say to me to say listen straighten up get beside yourself come on now gods on our side you know God is faithful gods on our side come on snap out of that he didn't do that but remember over and over as you know sometimes I would demonstrate that he puts on that apron and he begins to take the role of a servant not just because of the apron not just because of the apron not just because he was washing dishes he was serving her needs she needed him in a way to settle her emotionally and that's how it is with God working with our lives you see God can speak a word but now he comes to back that word up and when it comes to back that word up he provides the necessary atmosphere and the atmosphere is not an atmosphere of command or demand but the atmosphere is that which is generated from the source of which the word was spoken and it was spoken from the source of divine love so it's spoken from the source of divine love when divine love goes forth then what happens grace itself will step in and begin to produce what love has actually called for you see we're in an age and in all these things sometimes we don't even realize it's all around us that things itself goes we're in an seeds were even in this time we see the word coming to pass but let me remind you that the word itself even in the word coming to pass sometimes we see prayers answered and it seems like popcorn going off and then there's other times where we're praying and it wonder if the popcorn maker is even plugged in I just put it that simple tonight and you wonder if it where it's happen is that right but remember this is where patience comes in you must have patience and patience is a result of faith to know that this is God's Word regardless of my feelings regardless of my symptoms regardless of what I see or what I think God said so so what must we do make sure that we stay in an atmosphere of his love he shall cleave unto his wife you you can go through the scriptures you find that that that that this is where the satisfier is supposed to be this is why it's something that's entitle II off limits that that a man should never be talking to another woman about his problems come on somebody a woman should never be talking to another man about her problems it ought to be confining in one another and you know why the me just said like this as a husband you realize then don't you let the devil try to put one over on you yeah it's not for you listen to me close it's not that you've got to have all the answers it's that you know the source of all the answers that's what's important Joshua didn't have all the answers but he knew where to go Joshua 1 keep yourself in the word he kept himself in the word meditating and then when the angel of the Lord showed up with a battle plan for Jericho he recognized who it was he submitted himself and he received the leadership that when that leadership was brought back into the camp was a stability even in his words that because there would be an atmosphere now that would come upon the camp that would absolutely dispel fear you believe there's power in the Word of God I believe that with all my heart I believe there's power in the Word of God even as we are praying and looking to God so even when we come into situations in our home and I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but how many times were we been in situations here maybe even today and you don't know what to do as a husband as a wife as a father has a mother you don't even know how to answer but remember stand still you are serving the Living God and this situation this issue you watch him come on the scene and direct it when anxiousness wants to can't wants to come up you stand there and say God himself he will not fail he will answer and that's the comfort we receive from one another think of it you realize the Lord Jesus he himself has this scripture would speak he would have a life that would be able to comfort him in this hour we're always looking at Oh us comforting him but remember the Bible said he dwelleth in the praises of his people to praise him it brings him on the scene it comforts him but brother brems says when that you know he said when that husband comes in the wife just sets him down in the chair climbs up on his lap and just tells him what a good provider he is well you're getting quiet on me well you know what will preach this five six seven fifteen twenty five times come on now you might as well say dear Jesus help me come on now but it's been the saving of my husband we'll know what's going on he might think I'm putting him in a wrestling hold you don't know what he might think come on now you understand right now the Lord Jesus he loves your attention there is nobody that makes his heart go pitter-patter rock your attention lack your praise does not just in the good Pam's but even in the times we're even you can be so unsettled but yet in the midst of you'd say Lord you're faithful yard you're good so this junk from here of marriage I just I love how it was so set forth in the scripture that God he never opened up Adams foot and took a bone from his foot because he said you shall not walk on her she's not from the sole of your feet but he said I'm gonna open up that side which is right next to your heart and God took her from right next to his heart that which he would cherish oh my so when we consider this and Sweethearts you know those were some of the first sweethearts and we look at some of these examples here in the scripture you know there are many examples that speak not only to us as husbands and wife but there is examples that speak in the scripture of where that we are living in this hour in the time of wife which the time of life is the time to make that home it's the time for there to be life to come fourth so when we look at it here in the scripture I want to just go into another place in some sweethearts here in the Bible by the name of Abraham and Sarah familiar places with us but the Bible would say it like this in Genesis 16 now Sarah hi abraham's wife bear him no children remember she was she wasn't fertile she was terrible and she had a handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and sorry I said unto Abram behold now the LORD hath restrained me from bearing now it's true that she wasn't able to bear that in itself is true and let me just say like this you know everything in itself has a timing there is a right season and there is a right time God withheld hannah from bearing he Samuel couldn't come until Eli was ready to be removed come on now John could not come to Zacharias and Elizabeth until it's ready to introduce the Messiah everything had to be just in order and God knew where that word was gonna fall in when it was going to fall and she tells Abraham I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be notice it may be there's no maybes with God that's a sure sign right there there's no maybes it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah I and seria Abraham's wife took Hagar her made the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife to be his wife and he went into Hagar she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and Sarah said unto Abram my wrong be upon thee I have given made into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in her eyes the Lord judge between me and thee you see even though it was Serio's idea Abram listened to it so you know who was accountable he was my wrong beyond thee come on now then listen you and I have one who bears all wrong are you with me now think of this now this is why it's so careful we want to find the will of God you know a me remember our brother branham puts it within this here and that that sorry i was looking at hagar and said man she's a beautiful beautiful woman you know God for some reason I'm not able to bear why don't I just give Hagar to Abraham she's I mean I'm sure he'd be delighted in her she's beautiful and you know perhaps God will gonna is gonna give me a child by her see yeah here's the thing that it comes down to if Abram himself would have just stood there and just looked and I hope you'll listen to me tonight and look at this don't just let this be words tonight but let it be an application to our life because listen in your life there are patterns let's just be honest sometimes there's negative patterns we need God's grace in overcoming but there's also spiritual patterns for how God has dealt with you and proved his word and you know what that's for you and Abram could have just looked glad told him I'll show you the land is that right he did when he got in there and the land God said this was the land I'm talking about Abram worshiped right then Abraham you know he went about his way famine came up and he left and went on down to Egypt but you see his faith got him a chair that didn't change God's mind about him oh come on somebody that didn't change God's mind Abram come back in the land and here love you still you know hanging around with them it was hard for Abram to separate from Locke that's his nephew he raised him at his table come on now separation isn't always something that's easy the Prophet talked about when God called him to go from the East out to the West he said I had to leave everything that was dear to me to follow the will of God but I tell you when God speaks to your heart there is something that begins to take place in your life but everything else you stand like Elijah and say it doesn't matter it's God that matters hallelujah that's the same way in every service and day after day when he would speak to us about his will when he speaks and makes a note to our heart is something about it that as were in contact with God and we stay in that atmosphere that's why it's important to stay in the atmosphere because it opens you and I have to receive from him hear from him and submit to him in simplicity but it's when we get out of the atmosphere and then here we are praying and we're trying to pray but our prayer is almost like pumping a pump you're not going to get nothing that way the Holy Spirit is timid come on some honey that's where to come back in love with him and you know maybe it might be you just need to put on some music to settle your spirit down you need to say God help me get back in line so I can receive from you hallelujah because let me tell you something you don't think he wants to talk to you he wants to talk to you he loves to talk to you he does God Himself does not desire to hide or keep his way back for your life from you you might be standing at a crossroads but let me tell you something tonight you can cast down that evil spirit that would be trying to whisper in your ear as though God doesn't care I'm telling you God cares and if you'll just stand still you will witness the salvation of the Lord that God will direct your path the Bible the Word of God is true that acknowledged the Lord in all the paths and he will direct that footsteps Sara said I'm gonna help I'm gonna provide a little help now hold on a moment let me get this straight you're gonna help him Hooper who has made the atoms molecules and the earth that you're standing on you're gonna help him he don't need your help I know there's times we want to see things come to past there's things we want to see happen but you know what as we continue to mature in the Lord you realize there's a season and a time and it's Satan's desire to try to get everything in and our people and get you worked at it alive oh my goodness look at where everything's at but wait a minute here step back that ain't doing nothing for God well I'll tell you we're just gonna go tonight daddy doing nothing for God you need to recognize that's not the Holy Ghost that's the enemy you need to claim your rights that this land is given to the peace of God come on somebody you can never do anything in hates and it ever come out right you can never do anything without peace ruling over it and it come out right I'm telling you tonight I'm not just preaching to you or giving you a few things where I preach them from experience in my heart over and over their times we don't know what to do in situations and it would do you good and students calling around everybody else in your family and asking for their suggestion you ought to go to the Heavenly Father and say what do you see in this situation because let me tell you something he's got eyes and those eyes don't have ulterior motives they don't have ulterior desires remember his heart and his I said beloved I would that there would be and good health and prosper but she's going to help God out and Abraham went along with it you see it was an alternative route you know how the Bible teaches us in the book of Galatians Galatians 4 this Hagar is that of the law works of the flesh and you and I both know there's no works of the flesh that can stand justified in God's presence the Bible is clear in the Book of Isaiah that our works are filthy rags in his sights understand me even though our works might be that which is according to his word but if it's generated just based on our strength then God said those are your works but if they're our works that's motivated by the Spirit of God then God don't call them our works he says it's holy works by holy faith God doesn't need our help he just needs our surrender that's exactly right the law can make nothing perfect or complete I think tonight we just ought to be so set on our heart I'll just stay with grace you see grace provides grace provides oh my I hope that just rings so deep in our heart grace provides no does not provide grace provided Israel a prophet grace provided the pillar fire grace provided every step of the way now lets you to look at this here and we're just gonna rest in this just a few moments here in Genesis 17:1 God makes himself known to Abraham again and when Abram was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now I want you to think about this before we continue to read the original promise that God gave Abraham clear back in Genesis 11 that is recorded in the opening of Genesis 12 you never read Sarah's name in there you don't read it in there but yet it is in there but it just has to be the right season for that to come forth let me just say it like this for you and me you can set underneath the word and you can be looking and saying I don't seem like I see myself in that keep looking keep staying in the camp and keep looking and keep feeding on the world Sarah listen every time Abraham would go out and come back there was no mention the Lord never mentioned Sarah's name before able to get you I can tell you talked to God today did me I wonder was like when he he would come home from work she said I know you talked to him today how can you tell it's just a presence about your life and so she's wanting to know you know kind of like who called who who was it the Claudia who text you oh you're getting texts from no not text from worse that day that you know ways to get that you know see what you know talk to him and try to find out but there was no word concerning sorry I but yet she was there she was there not but you see right then you can understand you see of where that here it is laying here like in a mystery form just like that of the Gentile bride but I want to call your attention back to words in that promise when God gave that promise he said I will I have already I will bless thee it had everything to do with him is that right this was going to be his work and so here when God he would let the stream of life dry up in Abram Abraham had already fathered an Ishmael God said I lot I gotta let him get dead Sarah I was already barren her womb was dead Abraham was all dried up all right he got tired of trying but when he got tired of trying that's when the Lord showed up of his efforts had expired and God said got you just where I want yet whoo Abraham had been trying Sally I had been trying but you see they had been trying but God had a reserve deployment season and when they came to the end of their way that's when he could reveal himself that I am the old mighty God the all-powerful God the L Satya I am the God to bring to pass the promise that I've spoken hallelujah he made himself known in that time that I am the most powerful I'm telling you we don't need an intellectual gospel we need the power of God it won't be intellect that packs the brought out of here it's not intellection gives you victory it takes the power of God to produce the life of Jesus Christ it takes the power of God moving inside to bring that word to pass he said I'm the Almighty God and I will verse to make my covenant between thee me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly I don't have time to read these other scriptures that refer to it but God this same phrase the same word the Almighty God it's the same one that every time God would reveal himself to Jacob to Isaac he would make himself known that I am the Lord God Almighty aren't you glad he makes himself known to you that I am the all-powerful one this is exactly what is eat you heard when the creatures were moving the living creatures were moving in the Book of Ezekiel he said when their wings were moving it was the vice of the Almighty and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him I want you to think about this how God he moves on the scene here and verse 4 as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations hallelujah many nations see God was showing right here in this scripture God as Paul would say in the book of Galatians preached the gospel to Abram this was the gospel being preached he would be the father of many nations by what not by the natural seed but by the spiritual seed right here we even in this church right here all kinds of different nationalities come on we don't even got to go outside this church but to think all around the world he is bringing together a bride a mini nations Kindred's and tongues and she is one body there's one church there's one bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and he's bringing it all together and this think of it you and I are living in the closing moments and this word was spoken and preached to Abraham you tell me this word don't got power in it brother this word right here of verse 4 it had an effect in your life and that effect in my life where we can stand and say Abraham is my father neither shall that name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham you know what your name is it's your character you're not I mean there's a lot of things a lot of people I didn't name my boys after because I had some in classroom her name certain things you know what I mean you know you go to start talking about some man they'll say James who what's what's his last name because you know what when you get the surname on there the surname will tell you who that James is is that right you see look at this God said thy name God was changing Abraham's character oh he was not just changing his name like taking a nameplate off and putting another one off God was speaking to the expression of the word that was sowed in his life that character of word that laid there God was saying that you're the expression of your life shall be called Abraham for a father of many nations have high made v-not will I have already he's dead right now come on now Sarah's dead but here in the presence of God notice his faith growing and he says I have made thee I will make me exceedingly fruitful I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee we recognize that this chapter here in Genesis 17 if that were Abraham notice handy Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect how can Abraham be perfect how can you be perfect how can I be perfect there's got to be a representation on the inside that comes out and stands on our behalf my brother and sister that's why it takes the Holy Ghost and here where Abraham is spoken to by God I am the Almighty God and you know what God revealed himself to take my breasts take my life and draw it into you he's weak you with me he's still weak he still sterile see still sterile it ceased to be between them as husband and wife but you know what he's nursing from the Almighty God his strength is gone it will take the strength of God to produce this so he's drawing that's what mother mem says when God speaks through a man's heart he said when the Holy Ghost moves upon your life he said you could square your shoulders back put your head up and start walking he circles the promises a sure thing what God spoke to your heart hey man it's it's like we're something tonight it's already done he was inviting Abraham come nourish strength into your body he changed Abraham's name from Abram to Abraham you know to do this God when in order to change his name he simply just took Abram and he split it apart and he stepped in the middle yeah he stepped in the middle with the 5th no more though that letter the 5th letter there of the he Bravo which is he steps in the middle of a name and that right there means the breath the inspiration the understanding the spiritual revelation the life giver he stepped in the middle of Abraham's life and it becomes Abraham hallelujah and he stepped in the middle of Abraham's life and then he comes to the end of Syria and he puts the Amen on her life and then of himself and that going on the end of her main May means one who is faithful lovely delicate affectionate hallelujah that's the power of the Living God that moves on our lives going to be to God hallelujah you know put the bat in the center like this he said you know he said he put yellow him he put part of God's name because God is father of all and he made his name being at him he put part of his name with Abraham and made him a partner with him I want you listen this through his seed he would bring forth the seed and bless every nation in the earth he'd be the father of many nations Abraham wouldn't reproduce the faith of Elohim Abraham would reproduce the faith of Elohim do you realize what you are called to do to reproduce the faith of Elohim not us not a strength but it is him how can we reproduce that it's not us his faith itself it has to be his faith his word his life become preeminent in our lives [Applause] it's all him it's all him it's what God has spoken now once you think of this right here if God don't have faith in his own word then he shouldn't have spoken but he has faith in his own word when he's spoken he brings with the past it's already finished it's already settled all it takes us for us our faith to get brought up into that atmosphere and it ain't about us trying to oh my goodness I'm gonna try to get there oh my goodness I'm gonna try to get know anything about that it is just simply take hold of El Shaddai I and nurse the strength into your life day by day and you know what that baby has just as satisfying come on now he just is satisfied that's the way a believer is when God has made a promise and that promise he can anchor in your heart you're satisfied it's done it's finished it's over you see when that drops in your heart it's done oh I know the symptoms might go on you say how can it drop and things keep going because you got to remember the Word of God is a creative word there were two women in a meeting one of them had that goiter the other one had stomach problems there right that woman could not eat the other one there had that growth on her body in the meeting it was pronounced well she went home and she kept having the same issues but she kept saying God has healed me are you with me remember her husband said you better what about doing I think you're bringing a reproach on God you better not be doing that how do you know I was the honey I think you're bringing a reproach on God but all of a sudden one morning she happened to just think about finishing the oats that her child had left in the bowl and the old mill would tear her up but she ate it and nothing happened so what did she do she made some eggs come on now and about that time her neighbor down the road she already had woke up that morning and the growth that was long her life it had fallen off in the sheets I'll tell you what happened the Prophet said the angel of the Lord who spoke to their hearts in that meeting he was visiting that neighborhood that day who was it that was coming through that neighborhood the Almighty God they had been nursing from El Shadia drawing that promise e'en into their lives I don't mean to be too plain but when a baby's nursing it ain't busy looking at everybody else it's got its eyes on mama you're with me it's kind of Sighs on mama come on now brother branham's let's poke pretty plain like this too it's got its eyes on mama let me tell you something when you're nuts in the right way you've got your eyes on Jesus who is your strength and your sustainer [Applause] and Abraham also God lets him know circumcision tied in with this the name change the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he lets him know when you get hurt as for sehri I die wife in verse 15 thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall her name be and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yeah I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations kings of people shall be of her you know that wonderful I will bless her not just give her a sensation I'll bless her when God blesses it's a releasing of his life Jerry men and yeah I will bless her amen a neighbor him you know Abraham goes on in verse 17 shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old Abraham looking at his self and shall Sarah that is 99 old 99 or 90 years old bear but you see Abraham doesn't know see Abraham he doesn't know there's coming to change but God is already given an announcement you call her Sarah God has already let it be known there's gonna be a change coming because there ain't no wait Sarah can bear you a child because you can't even give her anything all right you you can't even give her anything so there's got to come a change in you that ain't just Sarah got a change Sarah can't say Libra has got a change no you both got to be changed you see it that's a why it ain't just one oh boy so-and-so's got to get changed no we all got to be changed let me tell you something we need more change than just going back to our youth we need to get all the junk out of our life there's got to come a change or else well on the other side we'd end up right back in the same mess there's got to come a correction of everything in our lives [Music] hmm but Sarah has or Sarah verse 19 the wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed forever that God went on to say in verse 21 I'm closing we'll just stop here my covenant will I establish with Isaac in verse 21 which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham what a lesson John Ben stop and look at Abraham and say you know what you always do the same stuff you always act like this no his word is going to prevail you remember in this chapter it's the breath of the Almighty it's God's inspiration coming forth let me tell you something there might been a lot of things and we can look at right here that seemingly was in the way but God Himself is moving and he keeps on speaking his word there is no negative in his word you say how does that apply to me there's to be no negative in your words when we come and we are in prayer we are coming with a positive promise made by a positive God backed up by a positive Holy Ghost that brings about a positive faith positive results come on somebody we're not we're not here this is not no matter what you feel or what you think brother Graham goes into this place here and he says you might be sitting here tonight he says and you think you're old and you might think maybe I'm not much good he said but let me tell you something Abram and Sarah was much older than you you can't get much worse than when God speaks and you're laughing because you know what to the mind to the reasoning yeah I don't know how this is gonna be I don't know how this is gonna take place I don't know how this is gonna happen God didn't ask you Abraham how he didn't ask you to try to figure it out sometimes that's our biggest problem is we get in between here and instead let God get in between here he gets in between here then he gives you strength to control between here come on now because all sorts of reasonings and everything else can arise and let me tell you something everything around you can present to you why you are not a fit candidate let me say this to you God has spoken God has spoken to your life God has spoken to your heart this is God's promise prevents us here the power of Almighty God he said is here he said and to think of it he said he that knows your life and while his anointing is here not me this is what he says not me but him it's not the bulb that's giving the light it's the current in the barber is that right it ain't the bulb it's the current and it's not the bulb it's not that that heals it's the current the anointing have a mighty God that comes through that performs the word and we can rest within that list and if you don't take anything else out of this tonight you realize the position you realize the place we're in but I want you to take out of this tonight as it applies to our life the Lord Jesus himself has laid aside everything to be united with you to nourish you to comfort you to strengthen you to encourage you that's what that's that's what he does he's provided of his life but I don't know what your needs are tonight but I want you to look at this right here don't get caught up on what your need is but look to him and you draw strength from him well if I could just know we don't want any Ishmael's you can't produce this I can't produce it it takes God is that right it has to be God sometimes you nurse on a promise and you nurse for a while you don't matter your nursing is you are satisfied you are satisfied within that because it's his strength that'll bring it about you know there's not one thing in my life there's not one thing within any life that's standing here that any of us can take credit for not one of us can say well I'm standing here because I know it's because of him it's because of him and we receive that strength from him in our lives you know he's providing for us like a faithful husband he's provided all that we have need of you know you take a promise and the promise when God makes that promise it's something that stands out to you you take that promise and you water it you water that with praise drawing strength and you watch God come I know every one of our lives every one of us sometimes where we sometimes we get into places I believe God helps us as we come along and heaven mature when we realize it takes patience there's sometimes there's things we pray for and it's like that then there's other times those things were praying for it seems like the answer it's not coming but it's all the way Abraham waited for 25 years I'm not telling you you gotta wait for 25 years but I'm just telling you Abraham he waited for 25 years but this chapter that we're in moving in even to this next chapter where that the one who has now appeared to him as the Almighty God he comes in the fullness of his power and his strength and he comes walking down the road with two angels you see what Abraham did there's something that happened between Genesis 17 and Genesis 18 something happened because as God went on and kept talking to Abraham God let him know I'm not just giving you a promise that's lingering out here I'm telling you service going to bear assignment in the appointed time in this coming year see God's now let it be known this is the season of the coming promise something takes place because you find abraham sitting in that door of his house the Rebbe says he's looking down so no doubt Abram just finished praying he said about that time is it Abram looked up he said in something spoken Abraham's heart and said there's something about these men well Brandon goes on to say he said Abraham kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere so that he could recognize the Lord when he showed up let me tell you something he's got your address he's got your number and every promise he fulfills it he's the Almighty God let's just pray Lord [Music] Lordan you are the Almighty God our lovely more Jesus the Lord where you would make your self known that I'm your strength giver Lord is true we cannot produce this on our own it'll not be us that produces a rapture that's you it's not you it's not us that has changed our lives it's you you the Lord that's changing us father whatever the need is Lord in any heart oh god me Lord tonight it rests within there that father by your power your authority you bring your word to pass in your season lord help us to be in the condition help us to be the Lord in that atmosphere that can recognize you help us to be Lord in that place just giving ourselves to you giving ourselves Lord for the Holy Spirit to the Word of God and Lord you are our strength you are our life no wonder David could write in Psalms 27 that which would speak Lord of this hour that we're living in the Lord is the strength of my life lord I pray hope God may your strength would just flow Oh God for every need tonight every need behind every uplifted hand in every heart Granite Lord or God may the worry the fret all of that Lord be laid aside because in you every promise is

at it you think I don't even seem like I'm hearing it in the right way don't get occupied with that God will see to it that you get what you need how many times you ever listen to a message and you listen to it you think I never heard that well you heard the message just before God gives to you what you have need of so we can look at it we can try to get our feet set just right now I've got to
