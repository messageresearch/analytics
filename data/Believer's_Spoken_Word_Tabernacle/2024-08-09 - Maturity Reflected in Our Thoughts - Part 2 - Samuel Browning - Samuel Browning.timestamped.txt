[23:57] to aren't you
[23:59] my if I tell you if if all that we had
[24:01] to look forward to there no wonder that
[24:04] the world is in a place of insanity of
[24:07] where they're at right now but I'm so
[24:09] thankful amen that there's been a a
[24:12] breaking in our lives From Another
[24:14] Dimension you know I just was reading
[24:17] where the Prophet was saying of how that
[24:20] there was a lady that she just just
[24:23] dropped in her heart bring the baby to
[24:25] the meeting and brother Bram said you
[24:27] know he said she was a Believer but he
[24:30] said something Came From Another
[24:32] Dimension that thought and struck her
[24:36] heart take your baby to church
[24:39] tonight brother Bram said see he says
[24:41] that that thought he said they just
[24:43] don't come just from nowhere he said it
[24:45] dropped From Another Dimension just like
[24:47] he said these these he describing it
[24:50] then how that words travel along these
[24:53] lines and now we're living in an age
[24:55] where it's not words traveling along
[24:57] telephone lines we're living in an age
[24:59] where things are being beamed the
[25:02] signals and to think about that in this
[25:04] hour you know the prophet said we're
[25:07] going to realize he said that to see he
[25:09] said to recognize that the God who
[25:11] always was has always been here and you
[25:15] know what the reality of it is God has
[25:18] supplied by the promised word of this
[25:20] hour what is needed in order to make
[25:24] himself known amen and you know what
[25:27] what God did did through the life of the
[25:30] Prophet because that was that was
[25:32] ordained as the prophet he found his
[25:35] place in the scripture and the believer
[25:38] today as we find our place in the
[25:40] scripture and in Christ we become a
[25:43] channel as well you know brother Bram
[25:45] said it just like this in Revelation
[25:47] book of symbols he said once he said
[25:49] you're born again of the spirit of God
[25:52] you have now been placed in a position
[25:55] for Angelic Association
[25:59] that's so good because Angels come to
[26:02] minister the word of God to us amen
[26:05] isin't that
[26:06] wonderful amen that's something it it we
[26:09] we our hearts are charged with that
[26:11] because we're Witnesses of that of God
[26:15] has ministered and and continues to
[26:17] minister to our hearts oh I tell you
[26:20] friends we we're not alone we're not
[26:22] we're not wandering amen God is is the
[26:26] chief Shepherd to draw us together and
[26:29] lead us all the way home amen amen God
[26:32] bless you this evening amen and I
[26:34] certainly uh certainly thank our
[26:37] musicians and brother Brian amen and we
[26:40] just want to uh just look to the word of
[26:42] the Lord for a few moments here this
[26:44] evening and just ask that the God will
[26:47] just um just minister to us and um I
[26:51] know uh different ones that you know
[26:54] we've been and we're not the only ones
[26:55] that's battled with sickness and
[26:57] different ones and things things um but
[26:59] we want to remember um one another in
[27:02] prayer and uh that God will just I know
[27:05] he'll see us through amen I know he will
[27:08] he is seeing us through and so um we
[27:11] just want to remember amen different
[27:13] ones that are in prayer that the Lord
[27:15] would just continue to strengthen them I
[27:17] think sister Naomi uh uh brother brother
[27:21] Brian and sister Barb um and uh just
[27:24] some different ones and you know I'm so
[27:27] thankful that we have truly in the
[27:29] atonement there's
[27:31] healing amen I'm so thankful for that
[27:34] amen God bless you let's stand to our
[27:35] feet and we want to go right into the
[27:37] word of the Lord so good to see each and
[27:39] every one of you amen that's here
[27:41] tonight and and
[27:43] uh amen so let's look here in the
[27:47] scriptures in um 2 Corinthians chapter
[27:51] 10 and and verse three and I want to go
[27:55] right back into this and uh just to
[27:57] further play a little bit more of a of a
[28:00] groundwork in dealing with our thoughts
[28:04] um and in our mind and you know the the
[28:07] the prophet God would lead him to preach
[28:09] the message the greatest battle ever
[28:11] fought and that is a very it's a very
[28:13] key message that is that is to be
[28:16] applied all throughout because we're
[28:18] we're living in that time we're truly
[28:20] the greatest battle that's ever been
[28:22] fought it's being fought right now yes
[28:25] it is and so you'll find all throughout
[28:28] the message you find the little glimpses
[28:31] here and there where uh from that um
[28:35] understanding that Revelation it
[28:36] continues to um uh be spread out but yet
[28:40] there for us to draw from and I believe
[28:42] God wants us to be victorious in this
[28:45] hour uh you know like like this like the
[28:49] statement brother Bram made God did not
[28:51] just save us and then just step back and
[28:53] become disinterested he's with us all
[28:56] the way yes he is even in the times that
[28:59] maybe we don't feel like it when God
[29:01] told the saman age I know the
[29:04] tribulation but God knew of it he just
[29:07] didn't give in but he was there and
[29:09] giving the sustaining strength to the
[29:11] Believers then and he's the same God for
[29:14] you and I tonight amen let's just read
[29:16] here in verse three beginning for though
[29:19] we walk in the flesh we do not war after
[29:24] the flesh now Satan's Satan's always
[29:27] always busy to try to get us out into
[29:29] that realm and when I say flesh I'm also
[29:32] talking the spirit realm because you're
[29:33] a you are a three room house your body
[29:38] Spirit
[29:39] Soul right and Satan is always wanting
[29:42] to get us out in the flesh cuz soon as
[29:44] he can get us out in the flesh he's
[29:46] already got us whipped right there we're
[29:47] already we already whipped remember when
[29:49] the maniac came on the platform that
[29:51] night uh when brother brandham was
[29:53] standing there and Satan was was really
[29:56] trying to get him to come out into the
[29:58] Flesh and everything he did spit in his
[30:01] face and so forth what that Maniac did
[30:04] and I know we're aware of this maybe
[30:05] some are not but I want you to
[30:07] understand Satan's objective he wants to
[30:10] if he can get us out into that place
[30:13] that it's flesh and we begin to act out
[30:15] in fleshly or carnal ways and that
[30:18] sometimes isn't even in actions it's
[30:19] just in thoughts he's already the battle
[30:23] right there he's got that that that
[30:25] particular battle right there but this
[30:27] is where we we battle against remember
[30:29] he came to draw brother Bram Satan was
[30:31] trying to draw him out into that but
[30:33] brother Bram says I chose to think
[30:37] different thoughts yeah that's good now
[30:39] let me ask you this
[30:42] question how could he choose to think
[30:45] different thoughts if he didn't
[30:48] recognize that he was a Son of God yeah
[30:51] that's right and recognize that as a
[30:54] that really as in a dual reality he's in
[30:57] contact with another realm if you've
[30:59] been born again you're in contact with
[31:01] another realm you have access to that he
[31:04] could either live by that or allow
[31:07] himself to be brought out here in the
[31:09] flesh that's a good is that right
[31:12] y amen so this is constantly the battle
[31:16] that we we are set before us for the
[31:18] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[31:23] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[31:27] down of
[31:29] strongholds casting down
[31:33] imaginations and every High thing that
[31:36] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[31:39] God I want you to notice every High
[31:41] thing is anything that seeks to put
[31:44] itself above God's word we cast it down
[31:49] that's right not not going to let it
[31:50] stay there and bringing into captivity
[31:54] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[31:58] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[32:01] Disobedience when your obedience is
[32:06] fulfilled amen how many of you ever
[32:08] entertained the wrong
[32:11] thought this is where that last
[32:13] scripture comes in having in a
[32:15] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[32:19] when your obedience is fulfilled this is
[32:21] what remember brother Brandon will use
[32:23] these words I don't mean to keep you
[32:24] standing but remember the words brother
[32:25] brand would use he'll use the word tow
[32:28] hold yeah spelled like toe like our toe
[32:30] tow hold and he says you know when the
[32:32] enemy gets you in a Toe Hold you've got
[32:34] to have a strength that's able to break
[32:37] it now what a Toe Hold You know for me I
[32:39] I kept listening to what brother Ram was
[32:41] saying a toe hold and and I remember I
[32:43] looked it up the one day and I thought
[32:45] well this is what a tow hold is for you
[32:47] and I it would be someone tapping out or
[32:50] they're brought into submission there's
[32:52] got to be something a hidden power on
[32:54] the inside that maybe when we're about
[32:57] at that place place of the tap out but
[32:59] there's something that we're Tapped Out
[33:01] to the right
[33:03] source and that's when he steps on the
[33:05] scene abolutely there's the hidden man
[33:09] in our heart yes he is is that right in
[33:12] the Garden of Eden it was the bride that
[33:15] was hidden in the groom now here we are
[33:18] in Satan's Eden but now it is the groom
[33:21] hidden within the
[33:23] bride amen the same same almighty God
[33:26] walking here Among Us
[33:28] amen let's just bow our heads real
[33:29] quickly in a word of prayer father
[33:32] certainly Lord we want to say thank you
[33:36] tonight for your mercies Lord once again
[33:39] father we just Lord we could Lord gather
[33:43] together and just to have prayer Lord
[33:45] for the remaining part of the time and
[33:48] it would never suffice Lord to give you
[33:50] thanks Lord for what you've done Lord
[33:53] and and what you are doing and Lord what
[33:56] you're about to do but we just want to
[33:59] say we love you father how we can Lord
[34:02] see Lord and take notice of your care
[34:05] Lord to our lives Lord and how we
[34:08] appreciate that so much Lord we love you
[34:11] father and Lord we just Lord our hearts
[34:14] are just drawn in these times and
[34:16] moments Lord we just want to be Lord a
[34:19] better servant Lord we want to serve you
[34:22] better Lord and so we just ask you Lord
[34:25] that as we would just lay Lord our our
[34:27] feeble efforts and everything Lord upon
[34:30] the altar Lord in our lives that God May
[34:33] there come Lord a fresh quickening lord
[34:36] of the spirit of God into our lives Lord
[34:38] a fresh refilling Lord of your spirit
[34:41] Lord may you move throughout this
[34:43] congregation tonight Lord in the visible
[34:46] and invisible audience Lord and father
[34:49] May every Lord hold or any hold that the
[34:52] enemy would have Lord I pray that God
[34:55] may it be released tonight Lord in the
[34:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[35:00] whether it's physical or spiritual Lord
[35:03] we know that God that this Warfare we're
[35:06] in is not flesh and blood Lord but it's
[35:08] a Warfare against principalities and
[35:11] spiritual darkness and wickedness and
[35:14] high places but we're thankful Lord for
[35:16] that reality greater is he that is in us
[35:20] than he that's in the world we're
[35:22] resting and we're trusting Lord in you
[35:25] and you alone father we love love you
[35:27] and thank you now Lord in Jesus precious
[35:30] name amen amen God bless you as you're
[35:33] being
[35:34] seated I want to continue to speak on
[35:38] that thought for a few moments and on
[35:40] maturity being reflected in our thoughts
[35:43] and we were looking at that scripture of
[35:46] last week where Paul had wrote and said
[35:50] when I was a child I thought as a child
[35:54] and um I spake as a child but when I
[35:57] became a man I put away childish things
[36:01] and you know I'm thankful because if it
[36:04] had not been as we were saying before uh
[36:08] I think last week if it had not been for
[36:10] the mercy of God coming to our lives and
[36:13] even working with us dealing with us and
[36:16] surely every one of us I know myself and
[36:19] I'm sure we can Fellowship around this I
[36:21] can look back across and through my life
[36:24] and I can see that where God has
[36:27] remitted situations whether it's tests
[36:30] it's test and it's trials truly that's
[36:32] where our molding and shaping and
[36:34] character character building comes from
[36:36] but God has so worked through those
[36:39] means to bring me to a realization of
[36:43] myself that I can do nothing without him
[36:45] there's things that God has pointed out
[36:47] even within it to where that we can look
[36:50] at and he's there he's changing us he's
[36:52] molding us and that that doesn't mean
[36:54] that God is doing away with who you and
[36:57] I are but what it is it's God bringing
[37:00] that it comes to light and when you and
[37:02] I can recognize that and see that
[37:05] weakness and see that tendency and put
[37:08] that before God then God that invites
[37:10] God to take over and it doesn't mean
[37:13] that we're not going to battle it just
[37:15] simply means remember overcoming the
[37:17] prophet said is two parts it's
[37:20] recognizing the devil at every one of
[37:23] his tricks and then to recognize that
[37:27] the god in you is greater and has
[37:30] already overcome that thing so it's it's
[37:33] there's a constant a constant listen and
[37:36] the way that we recognize that is by a
[37:39] spiritual
[37:40] discernment and that spiritual
[37:42] discernment is as we're staying in
[37:44] fellowship with the lord it's even as we
[37:48] come to the house of the Lord you you
[37:50] and I staying in the word of God and in
[37:52] prayer a constant relationship with him
[37:55] it it sharpens our our spiritual senses
[37:59] to be able to discern good from Evil and
[38:03] remember we're living in a day let me
[38:05] just say this to you it'd be really easy
[38:07] if everything was black and white but
[38:09] everything's not black and white there's
[38:11] a this is the day where the Bible said
[38:14] it will be a day as known unto the Lord
[38:16] where and neither day nor day nor night
[38:18] neither light nor Darkness we're living
[38:21] in that time where that Pale Horse
[38:23] anointing is upon the people it's a
[38:25] grizzled effect it's a it's a grayish
[38:28] it's it's not having like one exact
[38:31] exact color but I want to say this to
[38:32] you if everything was in black and white
[38:35] my that would be very simple in terms of
[38:38] discernment but we're living in an hour
[38:41] that we cannot walk by our own means or
[38:45] even our reasonings we've got to trust
[38:48] the spiritual discernment of the holy
[38:50] spirit cuz he'll always keep us centered
[38:54] in the word and that's what we're
[38:56] depending on and I'm grateful to God
[38:59] that that same Pillar of Fire he's right
[39:01] here with us and he has divided himself
[39:04] into those of us that have been born
[39:07] again of the spirit of God and if you
[39:09] haven't just say Lord let every part of
[39:11] my being be open and surrendered to you
[39:13] lead me to that place Lord of full
[39:16] surrender because let me tell you it
[39:18] won't be a church that'll do it won't be
[39:20] a man that'll do it it's God who brings
[39:22] us to a place of full surrender that's
[39:25] what the pillar of fire does it's super
[39:27] natural so now with thinking of that in
[39:30] the maturity being reflected in our
[39:33] thoughts with things this is where when
[39:35] brother brandom would say this and I
[39:37] want to just just uh drop these things
[39:39] in here uh tonight out of the greatest
[39:42] battle ever fought brother BR says
[39:44] you've got to get the soldier the Holy
[39:47] Spirit placed at the Battlefront that
[39:51] takes God's word he is the word and he
[39:55] stands there and there's nothing going
[39:58] to stop it
[40:00] then now notice get him placed at the
[40:03] Battlefront and what is what the whole
[40:05] what what the prophet is dealing with is
[40:08] is get the holy spirit in that rightful
[40:11] place of the Soul because this is God's
[40:15] then listen the spirit itself is not
[40:18] God's Abode in our human Spirit or Upon
[40:22] Our flesh that's not God's Abode and we
[40:24] can see that because if it's just an
[40:27] anointing that comes on the spirit or
[40:29] the flesh many in lady OA have that but
[40:32] it never translates into a sacrificial
[40:36] life that's lived according to the word
[40:39] but if the Holy Spirit who is the word
[40:42] if he gets down on the inside in that
[40:44] Soul which is that place that he has
[40:48] prepared for himself to dwell then he is
[40:51] setting on the control tower of our soul
[40:54] to give the influence and he has given
[40:58] us the authority as a son and daughter
[41:01] of God to reign in this
[41:06] vessel so it's that's important getting
[41:08] the Holy Spirit on the inside this is
[41:10] why that when you listen into the
[41:13] message this is why the message come is
[41:16] to bring a real true New Birth on the
[41:19] inside to bring a real Born Again
[41:22] experience man has diluted it churches
[41:26] has diluted and not throwing off but I'm
[41:28] just trying to say that God himself has
[41:31] brought and restored that to you and I
[41:34] of what the real true New Birth is that
[41:37] it is the spirit of God coming upon Sons
[41:41] and Daughters of God to bring that
[41:43] reality in our life and manifest through
[41:47] our
[41:49] lives yes sir Hallelujah not a handshake
[41:52] not even an agreeance in our mind all
[41:55] all of those things have their place and
[41:57] part but nothing nothing can replace the
[42:02] real reality of the new birth and so
[42:05] this is why we need that soldier on the
[42:07] inside which is greater is he that is in
[42:11] you than he that's in the
[42:13] world
[42:15] Amen listen friends don't despise it
[42:18] just say Lord be it unto
[42:20] me be it unto me Lord that's good the
[42:23] prophet goes on to talk about how how
[42:26] that so many do not even clear out the
[42:29] the channels of their Spirit conscience
[42:32] memory reason affection imagination and
[42:35] all of those things and just leave it
[42:37] there but you know you know how we clean
[42:39] it out how those things are cleaned out
[42:42] it comes the prophet says you've got to
[42:44] clean it out conscience memory thoughts
[42:48] laying aside everything that's a real
[42:50] key amen laying aside everything well I
[42:55] I know so and so claimed to have the
[42:56] Holy Ghost lay it
[42:58] aside I know so and so claimed and
[43:02] professed their healing but they they
[43:04] they they they died lay it aside because
[43:08] the Bible says very clearly we realize
[43:10] healing there's times where there's
[43:12] healing in this Dimension or it can be
[43:15] in the next Dimension yeah that's good
[43:17] you see you don't want to try to serve
[43:19] God through your conscience or through
[43:21] your reason we can't do that Satan chose
[43:24] the mind but God chose the heart
[43:29] amen amen let me just say this friends
[43:32] you can try to figure God out and you'll
[43:34] never be able to do it no sir this is
[43:37] why when the Holy Ghost has come when
[43:39] when Jesus would say regarding that of
[43:42] the Holy Spirit he says you cannot tell
[43:45] from whence the wind cometh and where it
[43:47] goeth has anybody ever seen the wind you
[43:50] might say my the other day I know I was
[43:52] here when all of that and I'm watching
[43:54] the clouds and here everything flying
[43:56] around the other day but I didn't see
[43:58] the wind but I saw things that were
[44:00] being affected by the
[44:04] windall right yes sir is that right it's
[44:07] that that's where it comes down to the
[44:09] new birth and the reality I can't
[44:11] explain it but I know what happened to
[44:13] me I know what I was I know what I was I
[44:17] knew where my desires were but I know
[44:20] what came in my life and when he changed
[44:23] my life from all of those things of the
[44:26] world and there's a desire just to
[44:28] please him even when it brings me to a
[44:31] place to say Lord I see my error I see
[44:36] Lord even my thoughts or my attitude or
[44:38] my Fe God you're there to mold me
[44:42] Lord we want to lay all that aside and
[44:45] come watch this come from the inside out
[44:48] with that unadulterated word of God that
[44:51] that it's the truth now this is what I
[44:53] love about the spirit of Truth we can
[44:56] take this portion right here of the
[44:57] message and you could leave that that
[45:00] particular script or that quote and you
[45:02] could leave it and say well that's the
[45:04] new birth and praise God God and I don't
[45:07] really need to focus on that quote no no
[45:09] we do because Jesus remember there's
[45:12] things that come to you and I even after
[45:14] the New Birth and sometimes there's
[45:17] thoughts can get in our mind you can get
[45:19] worries in your mind you can get
[45:21] frustrations in your mind come on
[45:23] fellowship with me Paul remember brother
[45:26] brandom was getting ready to go out off
[45:28] the scene and he was going to go out
[45:30] there you know and and said you know
[45:32] I'll just stomp out of the Wilderness
[45:33] whenever it you know I get a message and
[45:36] I'm just going to do this there was a
[45:38] complex and you know what a complex is
[45:40] it's a way of thinking about something
[45:43] that's right he was filtering everything
[45:47] that he was seeing through that complex
[45:50] and it just started with one little nail
[45:52] one little board and it kept building
[45:55] until eventually that com Lex became a
[45:58] residence in the spirit of William
[46:01] brandham and this is why listen to me
[46:03] this is why brother brandham if you'll
[46:05] listen to the message standing in the
[46:06] Gap then it preaches flashing red lights
[46:09] of his coming then he continues through
[46:11] that month there in in in in July and
[46:13] he'll make this statement over and over
[46:15] all he says it's so easy to build a
[46:19] complex yeah it sure is yes that's and I
[46:22] don't know about you but sometimes I
[46:24] didn't even realize when I had one yeah
[46:26] that's right
[46:28] there you go I didn't and all of a
[46:30] sudden you realize wait a minute here
[46:32] I'm processing everything through this
[46:35] oh my and you know what when you can
[46:37] recognize it and then submit it to God
[46:39] it's
[46:40] liberating it doesn't mean that we're
[46:42] not going to be tested against it just
[46:45] simply what it means is we've recognized
[46:47] the devil and oh God help me to stay in
[46:50] that place of submission to recognize
[46:52] him
[46:53] Lord you see that's part of maturity
[46:55] maturity isn't well I'm a Son of God I
[46:58] tell you I tell I'm going to go out here
[47:00] and I'm going to you know the storms
[47:01] that we have to deal with is the storms
[47:04] in our own
[47:05] life oh I want to go out to Colorado no
[47:08] that was an example to show you that the
[47:11] same thing where God used a prophet to
[47:13] control a snowstorm in Colorado is the
[47:16] same Holy Spirit Works through your life
[47:18] to stop
[47:20] storms there might have been things
[47:22] that's overtaken your family grudges and
[47:25] everything else that you can look back
[47:27] down and say man it has swept through my
[47:30] family but you have been equipped with
[47:33] thus sayith the Lord to speak to that
[47:36] storm yes sir Hallelujah you're not just
[47:39] an ordinary people you're a supernatural
[47:43] people the pillar of fire has come and
[47:46] led you out of
[47:48] Egypt and the Egypt I'm talking about is
[47:52] your first
[47:54] birth Hallelujah he has smelt the the
[47:57] Tabernacles of ham he has smoked that
[47:59] for that on the inside let my son go
[48:03] that he may serve me that's what the
[48:06] word came to your life it spoke to the
[48:09] son and daughter it spoke let it go
[48:12] every desire let it go let it go let my
[48:15] son let my daughter serve me and he
[48:19] leads us all the
[48:21] way so we take that word this is why
[48:24] even as we come and we're listening to
[48:27] the word of God Hebrews 12 for the word
[48:30] of God is quick alive powerful sharper
[48:32] than any two-edged sword dividing a
[48:35] under the bone from the marrow even the
[48:38] spirit and comes down God Is So precise
[48:42] God doesn't come in a service and do a
[48:44] hack hacksaw job he's precise I know
[48:48] sometimes God might use a minister
[48:50] sometimes maybe even an evangelist and I
[48:52] know times that I felt like that I've
[48:53] preached scrambled eggs many times uh
[48:57] but you know when I I I say that in a
[48:59] manner but when you look at it God is
[49:02] precise in what he's doing and I that's
[49:05] the kind of person I want operating on
[49:08] me I want I want that precision and this
[49:10] is why Jesus said you're clean through
[49:12] the word that I've spoken you see when
[49:14] we can take that word in and you think
[49:17] about it where there's Witnesses all
[49:18] through this Congregation of where you
[49:21] have sat here and maybe the way and
[49:23] you've persevered and come and the
[49:26] spirit of God has come and delivered the
[49:28] word to your heart maybe it's been while
[49:31] you're at home working and meditation
[49:33] and here you are you're just in tune and
[49:35] in fellowship with God and all of a
[49:37] sudden it drops in that word and when
[49:39] you take that word in and let and lay
[49:43] aside everything else it will clean out
[49:46] all of those other channels let me tell
[49:49] you something we need continual
[49:51] cleaning is that right once the soul has
[49:54] been clean the soul don't need to be
[49:56] washed any more but we need to be washed
[49:58] with the washing of Water by the
[50:01] word that's why the word is there to
[50:04] wash and to cleanse and and you know
[50:06] this is why we need the word now look at
[50:08] this here with this in our thoughts and
[50:10] I want to go to one of the uh scriptures
[50:12] in Ephesians 6:1 17 where it speaks of
[50:16] one of the parts of our armor and it
[50:19] says take and take the helmet of
[50:21] salvation now notice this whole armor is
[50:25] given to you and I what is that whole
[50:27] armor well the whole armor putting on
[50:29] the whole armor is the word of God you
[50:31] know you can't put on one part of the
[50:33] armor not the other the the armor of God
[50:37] is is the holy spirit is the word of God
[50:40] coming into your life that's the soldier
[50:43] getting the soldier in the beginning is
[50:45] that right but notice how Paul would
[50:47] write this brother Shane he doesn't
[50:49] write it as though that well you know
[50:51] you really don't need to do it but he
[50:52] says take the helmet of salvation so in
[50:55] other words what you already have in
[50:58] Your Arsenal and your disposal take it
[51:02] use it amen is that right in 1
[51:05] Thessalonians 5:8 let us who are of the
[51:08] day be sober putting on the breastplate
[51:12] of Love of faith and love and for an
[51:15] helmet the hope of
[51:18] Salvation that's an expectation that's
[51:20] what hope we ministered on that it's an
[51:23] expectation I I don't know how how all
[51:26] of this is going to come out but I'm
[51:28] expecting
[51:30] God the Hebrew children didn't know how
[51:32] things were going to turn out but they
[51:34] were expecting God they said whether
[51:37] whether he delivers us or not out of
[51:39] here we are not going to
[51:41] Bow we're not bowing what was it they
[51:45] had an
[51:46] expectation they had a hope in God
[51:49] because they already knew
[51:53] himall the Bible doesn't let us read of
[51:57] all the little excerpts from their
[51:59] experiences and their Journeys that led
[52:02] up to their it doesn't do that but you
[52:04] and I know that there were experiences
[52:07] that led to that moment God is building
[52:11] and their faith is growing what's
[52:13] happening there's a maturing that's
[52:15] going on and maturing doesn't mean that
[52:18] we become independent as far as you know
[52:21] oh I'm just going to do this on my own
[52:22] no when we when maturity we recognize I
[52:26] I need
[52:28] him and with that reality I know
[52:31] sometimes those are just a phrase that
[52:33] sometimes it could become common to us
[52:35] but it's recognizing that my and our
[52:38] submission to him that every channel
[52:41] Lord let it be cleaned and clear that he
[52:45] can work
[52:46] through because you and I are
[52:49] instruments were to be instruments of
[52:51] his now I want you to think of this the
[52:54] prophet would say it like this and
[52:56] greatest battle ever fought he said now
[52:59] how you going to let this helmet what it
[53:01] does it's a protection what is helment
[53:04] made out of brass brass can even be
[53:08] tempered it's hard harder than iron what
[53:13] is brass it's
[53:15] judgment so it speaks of take this
[53:18] helmet of salvation we are going to have
[53:21] to bring every thought to judgment that
[53:25] is so that's our responsibility God is
[53:29] not he won't do that for us but he's
[53:31] equipped us to be able to bring every
[53:34] thought into
[53:37] judgment a brass headpiece notice the
[53:40] Salvation or knowledge of knowing this
[53:44] my healing comes from God my salvation
[53:48] comes from God my experience matches his
[53:52] word not the church's idea the word
[53:55] there you you are covered over with a
[53:59] protection the helmet of salvation
[54:02] Deliverance take that then go marching
[54:07] forward brother Bram would go on further
[54:09] in that quote I don't have it up there
[54:11] for you but he said notice he says as
[54:13] you take this helmet take the word of
[54:15] God he said the devil will follow after
[54:18] you every day and he'll try to scare the
[54:21] liver out of you look at these words he
[54:23] uses he says like this kingly Priestly
[54:27] big
[54:29] Goliath wow you know what he's trying
[54:31] look at these words kingly Priestly I I
[54:33] don't know you know for me these words
[54:35] the spirit of God just begins to take
[54:37] hold and I begin to just meditate
[54:39] thought why would brother R say that
[54:41] kingly Priestly big Goliath because King
[54:45] is one who would have power and a priest
[54:47] is one who is trying to offer something
[54:50] to you and I but notice how Satan will
[54:53] constantly try to do that to scare the
[54:56] deliver out of you and I but you have
[54:58] and I have an access to a helmet of
[55:02] salvation but I don't have to know all
[55:05] of the answers but I know the
[55:09] answer I know who's holding me I know
[55:12] that my experience matches God's word I
[55:15] know my healing comes from the Lord a
[55:18] helmet of salvation you might say well
[55:21] why do I need that because salvation is
[55:24] ongoing God continues to deliver you and
[55:27] I time and time again he delivers us
[55:31] even sometimes when our thoughts and our
[55:33] attitudes get wrong he delivers us from
[55:36] sickness he delivers us gives us the
[55:39] strength in testing and trials and one
[55:42] of these mornings he will Deliver Us
[55:45] from this Wretched
[55:48] Man the end Paul said of our Salvation
[55:53] Hallelujah now let's look at our
[55:55] responsibility here from our text 2
[55:57] Corinthians
[55:58] 10:5 casting down imagination this is
[56:03] all arguments reasonings and every High
[56:06] thing that exalteth itself against the
[56:09] knowledge of God and bringing into
[56:13] captivity every thought of The Obedience
[56:17] of Christ you know how a lot of these
[56:20] things take place where people then
[56:23] different things and sometimes they'll
[56:24] find oh this one got on a plane with
[56:26] this or or how did somebody get back in
[56:28] this development or how did somebody you
[56:30] know why because somebody just some
[56:32] seemingly looked at a person or or
[56:34] something just kind of it just seemed
[56:36] okay listen you cannot trust any
[56:39] disguise no matter how what it feels
[56:41] like what it looks like our
[56:43] responsibility is to bring every thought
[56:49] captive and you let me tell you
[56:50] something even the spirit of God when
[56:53] David thought that he was going to build
[56:55] a house house for the Lord even the what
[56:58] he thought and he looked at it this is
[57:00] what I'm going to do and Nathan said do
[57:02] all that's in your heart I mean you're
[57:04] going to do something for God but
[57:06] remember here David needed to seek out
[57:09] God's provided way that was consult the
[57:12] prophet of God how should the ark be
[57:15] brought up how should the house be built
[57:17] and remember God came back around and
[57:19] told David you can't do it but your son
[57:22] is going to do it what was it even
[57:26] showing that even in our Humanity we can
[57:30] sometimes let thoughts slip and it isn't
[57:32] so much the back and white thoughts but
[57:35] sometimes it's the things that comes in
[57:37] such a mixed way but I'm so glad for The
[57:40] Living Word of God that's there to equip
[57:43] you and I and help us bring these things
[57:47] captive so
[57:52] good I don't know about you but
[57:54] sometimes you know when you go past
[57:56] certain
[57:57] checkpoints they can take a hold of you
[57:59] and bring you
[58:00] back and say hey we need to look at this
[58:03] oh yeah I don't know about you but you
[58:05] know when you pass through the airport
[58:07] and things like that sometimes they'll
[58:09] let you go through you know on those
[58:10] scanners and I've I've went through I've
[58:12] only had just a few Pat downs and so
[58:14] forth but I'll tell you sometimes they
[58:16] get to look and say hey wait a minute
[58:18] we're we're looking at some here come on
[58:20] over here and I you have this I mean
[58:21] they could ask me do do you do you have
[58:23] like some you know like something you
[58:25] know in your waste like maybe some medal
[58:27] or tag no they don't just say okay Mr
[58:30] Browning go ahead and go on they say
[58:32] okay we'll just step over here and then
[58:35] they take a
[58:37] wand that's right pat down and
[58:40] everything you know why they're
[58:43] capturing
[58:45] capturing every part now you and I both
[58:47] know there's things that can slip
[58:49] through that but it can't slip through
[58:52] the Holy
[58:53] Spirit you see God's not asked you and I
[58:56] in our natural senses to discern the
[59:00] enemy's advances but what God has
[59:03] equipped you and I with when the soldier
[59:05] is there in the beginning we can bring
[59:08] every thought subject to that on the
[59:12] inside prise God that's what we want to
[59:14] do captive every thought to The
[59:17] Obedience of Christ that actually that
[59:20] word means to bring into captivity right
[59:24] lead away captive I don't know about you
[59:25] but I've always been grateful when I get
[59:27] Beyond security that's one of the things
[59:29] I always test you know text my family I
[59:31] I'm I'm past security Now that means now
[59:34] I can go I can go get my Starbucks go
[59:36] get my Americano and go sit down by the
[59:38] gate if I got time that's what that
[59:42] means man I mean you we we've got it but
[59:45] you know my brother one time when he was
[59:47] traveling with me one of the first times
[59:49] we went to the Philippines together in
[59:50] 2017 he had you know his carry-on bag
[59:53] but he had all of these things in his
[59:55] carry on bag actually had his uh
[59:56] toiletries bag inside of there he had oh
[1:00:00] man these nice good siiz bottles of
[1:00:03] sprays and all this other stuff I mean
[1:00:05] they were nice he had just bought them
[1:00:08] just laid them in there they scanned
[1:00:10] that stuff and they had it laying over
[1:00:12] there on the other side and they invited
[1:00:14] him over opened it up and they asked him
[1:00:18] what's
[1:00:19] this oh he says well that that's my
[1:00:22] toiletry so I can see that so they asked
[1:00:24] him do you want us to throw it in the
[1:00:26] trash can here right or do you want to
[1:00:29] call go back out and call somebody to
[1:00:31] pick it up cuz you're able to take this
[1:00:33] and go back out right right now he had a
[1:00:36] choice at that time either go back out
[1:00:39] and go through all that line again try
[1:00:41] to call my mom or my wife and say hey
[1:00:43] can you come pick up a can of powder or
[1:00:46] I'm sure they weren't going to drive
[1:00:47] clear over to Cleveland for a can of
[1:00:49] powder or some other kind of spray or
[1:00:51] this or that but you understand what I'm
[1:00:53] saying what they did was they just okay
[1:00:56] can you take it if not it goes right in
[1:00:58] the trash I think that's exactly what we
[1:01:01] need to do with every thought we need to
[1:01:04] bring it right over here and say yep and
[1:01:06] there's something that just doesn't seem
[1:01:08] right so let's open it up and let's let
[1:01:11] the word go through
[1:01:13] it and then we can decide throw it right
[1:01:17] here not taking it with me in my journey
[1:01:21] you see what you don't want to happen is
[1:01:24] this is why we want to bring every
[1:01:25] thought in captivity you do not want
[1:01:28] Satan to come in and hijack your
[1:01:33] spirit because if he comes in and
[1:01:35] hijacks your spirit he'll have you
[1:01:37] thinking certain things are real and
[1:01:40] they're not real at
[1:01:42] all he'll have you thinking certain
[1:01:44] things are true and it's not even true
[1:01:46] at all I can't get to that tonight but
[1:01:48] he can come in and if he can hijack it
[1:01:51] just right he'll cause you to act
[1:01:53] certain things out that are not not even
[1:01:56] true that is so true yes sir that's in
[1:01:59] the imagination abely that's even in
[1:02:02] reasoning come on let's bring it on down
[1:02:04] here how Satan can get right in there
[1:02:06] and maybe you haven't heard from God in
[1:02:08] a while and as maybe a young believer
[1:02:11] even as an older believer you haven't
[1:02:13] heard from God in a while and you wonder
[1:02:15] where's he at why why haven't I heard
[1:02:17] from him and Satan can get right in
[1:02:19] there he can suggest to reasoning well
[1:02:22] God don't love you God don't care
[1:02:25] he can do that and you know what if you
[1:02:27] and I allow it then here we come and we
[1:02:30] sat down in the house of God we don't
[1:02:33] worship that's right we just said here
[1:02:36] we'll sit on the preacher that's right
[1:02:38] well and yet God is trying to help
[1:02:41] us because listen friends those are
[1:02:43] channels in there that you and I must re
[1:02:49] over is so that's why the Bible said he
[1:02:53] that ruleth his spirit is greater than
[1:02:54] he that taketh the city yeah is that
[1:02:57] right yes sir so we notice we don't want
[1:02:59] to become a
[1:03:00] hostage in our own
[1:03:04] Gates Now watch how brother Brown will
[1:03:06] put this in greatest batt of fa now
[1:03:08] watch the devil will try to come right
[1:03:12] back he's worse than a
[1:03:15] mosquito watch this if he can get in
[1:03:18] there at all he's got your army routed
[1:03:23] right then you know what it means when
[1:03:26] when an army is routed every all the
[1:03:27] ranks are broken yeah they're just
[1:03:30] running scattering that's right if he
[1:03:32] can get in there at all he's got them
[1:03:37] routed if you've got your senses see
[1:03:40] taste feel smell here they're all right
[1:03:43] we need them don't
[1:03:44] we I don't know about you but I'm glad
[1:03:46] when I can taste
[1:03:48] food yeah yeah I'm glad when I can smell
[1:03:52] it
[1:03:53] too right I'm glad that I can see I'm
[1:03:55] glad I thank God for my senses I'm
[1:03:58] grateful for that I'm glad that I can
[1:04:00] hear right I I thank God for him but God
[1:04:03] never intended for those
[1:04:06] senses to be our
[1:04:09] leadership that's never intended that no
[1:04:12] sir but watch what he says but don't
[1:04:15] trust them unless they agree with the
[1:04:20] word they're all right they're all right
[1:04:23] but if they disagree with the word don't
[1:04:26] you listen to them yeah do you
[1:04:31] understand Satan will come right there
[1:04:33] and right through your mind and right in
[1:04:36] that spirit and you know whose voice
[1:04:38] tone he'll speak in your own voice
[1:04:41] you'll hear yourself your own voice he
[1:04:43] don't use brother Shane's voice on me he
[1:04:45] don't use brother Brian's Voice or
[1:04:47] brother Bill or brother rockos or
[1:04:49] Brother Ray or brother brother Drake he
[1:04:51] don't use their voices he cloaks it in
[1:04:54] my own voice
[1:04:58] this is why with discernment and
[1:05:00] maturity you discern that Spirit not by
[1:05:03] the voice but what is behind it and
[1:05:07] bring it subject to the word of God
[1:05:10] capturing every thought and say let's
[1:05:12] open this
[1:05:15] up
[1:05:17] Glory a don't listen to
[1:05:22] them you've been given Authority right
[1:05:24] here don't listen to them
[1:05:26] imaginations conscience memory reasons
[1:05:29] affections they're all right if they

[1:06:09] to mark them that cause division it and
[1:06:12] then how things will just start to flood
[1:06:14] right in to do what build our case to
[1:06:18] isolate our own selves you know what

[1:08:24] we can hold things
[1:08:26] we got a choice God ain't going to

[1:11:29] we couldn't find what we never knew we
[1:11:30] would
[1:11:33] need don't stop remember the prophet
[1:11:35] says this don't stop to
[1:11:39] listen praise God remember Nelly Sanders
[1:11:43] when she had got delivered right the
[1:11:45] Holy Spirit had so touched her heart and
[1:11:47] her life brother R going through that
[1:11:49] but how that she is walking by that
[1:11:51] Music Hall walking on the other side of
[1:11:54] the street and she thought
[1:11:55] oh that music boy It really used to
[1:11:57] bother me it don't bother me no more
[1:12:00] brother BR said oh that's just what you
[1:12:03] think and she began to stand there and
[1:12:06] all of a sudden now it went from
[1:12:10] reasoning to memories oh I remember when
[1:12:13] Lee and I used to win these dance
[1:12:16] competitions what she doing memories
[1:12:19] imagination then it's opening in
[1:12:22] affection yeah come on you see it goes
[1:12:25] from gate to gate to gate it can go so
[1:12:28] quick and before she knew it there was a
[1:12:32] spirit that came on her but she knew
[1:12:35] where to go get help and she ran she
[1:12:38] took a c and ran up there to Brother
[1:12:41] rand's house she said Oh Brother random
[1:12:43] brother random brother random I'm lost
[1:12:44] I'm lost I'm lost brother random help me
[1:12:46] help me help me said well I don't
[1:12:47] believe you're lost Nelly I don't
[1:12:49] believe you're lost and he begin to take
[1:12:51] her by the hand and he begin to pray and
[1:12:53] he says you know he said I didn't know
[1:12:54] too much about casting out Devils at the
[1:12:57] time he said but I said Satan this is
[1:13:00] God's daughter she belongs to the Lord
[1:13:03] you're going to have to take your hands
[1:13:05] off of her she oh I love this she didn't
[1:13:08] mean to do that
[1:13:11] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:13:15] be to God and remember that Spirit it
[1:13:17] rose up out of there remember brother B
[1:13:20] said like a bat with long hair it
[1:13:22] sobered up the drunk man he had picked
[1:13:24] up
[1:13:27] you'll hear Brother R even commend Nelly
[1:13:29] Sanders on and on in different messages
[1:13:32] all throughout the
[1:13:34] message but what happened she be to just
[1:13:36] yet entertain
[1:13:38] something anything disagrees with what's
[1:13:41] on the inside get rid of it I want to
[1:13:43] remind you you're the one who's in
[1:13:45] charge Lord You're the one who's in
[1:13:48] charge this is why we want the Bible
[1:13:50] would say that every one of us should
[1:13:52] know how to possess a vessel and
[1:13:55] sanctification and honor you see that
[1:13:58] Battleground like brother Ram would
[1:14:00] would speak of this here let me go to
[1:14:02] greatest Bor of fought paragraph 110
[1:14:04] there's your Battleground your
[1:14:05] Battleground is back here at the
[1:14:07] beginning back in your mind that opens
[1:14:12] your mind opens up and accepts the
[1:14:15] spirit or it rejects the spirit I want
[1:14:19] you to understand thoughts are not just
[1:14:21] thoughts they come from
[1:14:23] somewhere they sure do yeah you can have
[1:14:26] little consciences little feelings
[1:14:29] little Sensations and all these things
[1:14:31] that has nothing to do with it that's
[1:14:32] just little Sensations and things but
[1:14:34] when it comes to reality your mind opens
[1:14:38] it up your mind either accepts it or
[1:14:42] rejects it he says it's your mind that
[1:14:46] opens the door or closes the door and
[1:14:50] listens to your conscience listens to
[1:14:54] your memory
[1:14:55] listens to your
[1:14:58] affections that's so good yeah this
[1:15:02] would kind of almost be the equivalent
[1:15:04] somebody came to your house and was
[1:15:06] going to run down somebody else and you
[1:15:10] stood right there at the door and said
[1:15:12] I'm sorry I don't got time for this
[1:15:13] right just close the door God bless you
[1:15:15] brother if you sister who yeah if I I
[1:15:17] don't I don't have time for that why
[1:15:19] it's not edifying I I don't have time
[1:15:21] for it right and and that's not it's not
[1:15:23] you or I demeaned you realize just even
[1:15:25] in doing that it can totally change the
[1:15:27] circumstance and situation CU do you
[1:15:29] realize when Satan does things like that
[1:15:30] listen to me now when Satan does like
[1:15:32] that and can get up on somebody's mind
[1:15:34] and they go to start looking at somebody
[1:15:36] else and somebody might be dead wrong
[1:15:38] they might be wrong as wrong could be
[1:15:40] and what that person is saying might
[1:15:42] actually be truth but you know what
[1:15:43] happened Satan is getting their
[1:15:45] attention off of where it needs to be
[1:15:49] our attention can never be upon one
[1:15:51] another I can never focus on brother Ry
[1:15:53] or Brother Richard or brother Richie or
[1:15:56] brother Bill I can't focus on them and
[1:15:58] expect to live a Victorious Life you
[1:16:01] know why they're flesh just like I am
[1:16:04] they need the grace and mercy of God
[1:16:06] just like I
[1:16:07] do is that right I can't focus on that I
[1:16:12] have to focus on what the word is
[1:16:14] speaking to my life I can pray for my
[1:16:18] brother I see one in need that's my
[1:16:20] responsibility as a Son of God is to
[1:16:22] take dominion over over the tongue that
[1:16:26] it don't talk about
[1:16:28] him that's it you know so and so did
[1:16:32] this this and this and this and they did
[1:16:34] this this and this and this and then
[1:16:35] here's the cherry on top you you pray
[1:16:37] for them why did you have to say
[1:16:41] everything why'd you have to say
[1:16:42] everything maybe it have been better if
[1:16:44] it had been an apple and got put in the
[1:16:45] snout before anything could have come
[1:16:47] out right just pray for them take it and
[1:16:50] pray for
[1:16:51] them is that right oh God help us that's
[1:16:54] part of maturity friends you might look
[1:16:56] at that and say well that ain't that
[1:16:58] great big of a Ministry it
[1:17:00] is in the book of Colossians there was a
[1:17:03] man by the name of aaas he was
[1:17:06] recognized as praying for the Perfection
[1:17:09] of the
[1:17:11] Saints not that he preached meetings or
[1:17:13] did this he prayed for
[1:17:16] Perfection among one
[1:17:20] another don't ever despise what God has
[1:17:23] you to do
[1:17:25] when your mind Clos itself to these
[1:17:26] things and let God the spirit of his
[1:17:28] word come in it blows the rest of the
[1:17:31] stuff out this is what this is what one
[1:17:33] of these Daisy cutter bombs do yeah
[1:17:36] that's right it comes in and it
[1:17:39] just when we can receive the word
[1:17:42] hallelujah you say well how how do I
[1:17:45] receive it well it begins first with
[1:17:47] agreeing right receiving it in our mind
[1:17:50] and as you'll take that word in not your
[1:17:52] thoughts but God's thoughts
[1:17:55] it has within it
[1:17:58] power transforming power it has power to
[1:18:03] clean channels out
[1:18:06] amen oh my this is why the prophet in
[1:18:10] the message is super sense and I want
[1:18:11] you to think of this scripture 2
[1:18:13] Corinthians 5:7 for we walk by faith and
[1:18:17] not by
[1:18:19] sight walk by faith this is how we walk
[1:18:22] we walk by faith we our life it's moving
[1:18:27] on by faith faith is a master of every
[1:18:33] circumstance faith is that of the good
[1:18:37] man in the house I want you to watch how
[1:18:41] the prophet places this in the message
[1:18:43] the six the super sense you see which
[1:18:46] one okay the six sense that's faith
[1:18:51] faith come for this reason only that was
[1:18:55] to make the five senses in you deny
[1:18:59] anything that's contrary to God's word
[1:19:01] amen that's what the six sense is for
[1:19:04] the scripture speaks of casting down
[1:19:05] reasonings watch he goes on six senses
[1:19:07] come upon the human being to make them
[1:19:10] deny anything that's contrary to the
[1:19:13] word of God any symptom any symptom
[1:19:17] that's contrary to God's promise the six
[1:19:19] sense says it isn't there amen what says
[1:19:25] it's not there the six sense notice the
[1:19:29] natural man only has these talking about
[1:19:31] the five natural senses they're all
[1:19:33] right if they can be brought in
[1:19:36] submission to the six
[1:19:41] sense if the natural mind says and it
[1:19:44] reads the word of God and said this is
[1:19:45] the word of God it's speaking the truth
[1:19:48] but if it reads it and it says it's not
[1:19:50] all the word of God or you know it was
[1:19:52] one time but it ain't now then that six
[1:19:55] comes in and says he's the same
[1:19:58] yesterday today and
[1:20:01] forever see the soldier at the
[1:20:05] beginning right the word of God
[1:20:08] established in our hearts this is why
[1:20:11] with faith and the Holy Spirit the word
[1:20:13] of God is so important remember how Paul
[1:20:16] let me try to bring this down remember
[1:20:17] how Paul would write in Romans 7 I don't
[1:20:19] have time to read all of it but Paul
[1:20:22] would say in verse 14 we know that the
[1:20:25] law is spiritual but I am carnal sold
[1:20:27] under sin for that which I do I allow
[1:20:31] not for what I would that do I not but
[1:20:35] what I hate that do I if then I do that
[1:20:39] which I would not I consent unto the law
[1:20:42] that it is good now then it is no more I
[1:20:45] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:20:48] for I know now watch this this is a
[1:20:50] maturity for I know that in me that is
[1:20:54] in My Flesh dwelleth no good
[1:20:58] thing I'm telling you your flesh My
[1:21:00] Flesh man it'll side right against the
[1:21:02] real you on the inside in a moment you
[1:21:05] don't ever want to take him in a
[1:21:07] fight never never take and rely on your
[1:21:11] reasoning your affections or any of your
[1:21:13] senses natural or those five spiritual
[1:21:16] don't ever come against the enemy with
[1:21:18] that because those things it'll side
[1:21:21] right with the devil all the time them
[1:21:23] guys are turn codes man you don't want
[1:21:26] them this is what Paul is saying I know
[1:21:30] this is a reality of maturity I know
[1:21:34] amen but Paul you're born of the stock
[1:21:36] of Benjamin Paul you're the prophet of
[1:21:39] God Paul you got understanding in
[1:21:42] Mysteries Paul but see what's what it is
[1:21:45] Paul
[1:21:47] recognizes within me he's not talking in
[1:21:50] his soul no when you read Paul's gospel
[1:21:53] in Romans Colossians Philippians all the
[1:21:55] way through it almost sounds like
[1:21:57] there's two people in one body and yet
[1:21:59] there is there's a real man that has
[1:22:02] come from God on the inside and he's
[1:22:04] walking in this vessel God made Adam
[1:22:08] first Spirit man then put him in a flesh
[1:22:12] body you see that's part of the maturing
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:17] recognizing being able to discern and
[1:22:20] separate the Realms in our lives this is
[1:22:23] where Paul said I know that in me that
[1:22:25] is in my flesh that means flesh and
[1:22:28] spirit dwelleth no good thing for to
[1:22:31] will is present with me but how to
[1:22:35] perform that which is good I find not
[1:22:37] for the good that I would do I do not
[1:22:40] but the evil which I would not that I do
[1:22:44] how many have you ever said I'll tell
[1:22:45] you what soon as I get done with this
[1:22:47] I'm going to go
[1:22:48] pray there you go and all of a sudden
[1:22:51] here it
[1:22:52] is later on at night
[1:22:55] later on or whenever more and you look
[1:22:58] man man how did that how did that
[1:23:01] because you know why evil is always
[1:23:05] present you know what evil is this right
[1:23:08] here this guy right
[1:23:10] here right here it's always it's evil is
[1:23:13] always present this guy don't feel like
[1:23:16] doing certain things he don't the flesh
[1:23:19] don't are you with me yeah so notice for
[1:23:24] the good that I would do I do not but
[1:23:25] the evil which I would not that I do now
[1:23:28] if I do that I would not it is no more I
[1:23:30] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I
[1:23:33] find in a law that when I would do good
[1:23:36] evil is present with me watch this now
[1:23:40] for I Delight in the law of God after
[1:23:44] the inward man that's important it's got
[1:23:47] to be a delight a
[1:23:49] desire is for the word of God in the
[1:23:53] Inner Man
[1:23:55] psalms 27 this one thing have I
[1:24:00] desired is that right that's but I see
[1:24:04] another law in my
[1:24:06] members so Paul you mean there's still a
[1:24:10] battle out here in your members Paul
[1:24:12] wrote of it in Galatians 5 the spirit
[1:24:14] capital S not human Spirit capital S for
[1:24:18] the spirit lusteth against the flesh
[1:24:21] meaning there's desires that are against
[1:24:23] the flesh
[1:24:25] the spirit desires to be in tune with
[1:24:27] God right and the flesh lusteth against
[1:24:31] the spirit these two Paul said are
[1:24:34] contrary one to the
[1:24:38] other but I see another law in my
[1:24:41] members Waring against the law of my
[1:24:44] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:24:47] the law of sin which is in my members oh
[1:24:49] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:24:54] me from the body of this death I thank
[1:24:58] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so
[1:25:00] then with the mind I myself serve the
[1:25:04] law of God but with the flesh the law of
[1:25:09] sin thank God for a strength on the
[1:25:13] inside to bring that outer man in
[1:25:15] subjection yes amen Amen brother BR in
[1:25:19] the prayer of a super sense he said the
[1:25:20] six sense the super sense oh God he's in
[1:25:23] prayer pour it out on me give it to me
[1:25:26] and to everyone who needs it Pour thy
[1:25:29] six sense into me Lord I'm willing to
[1:25:32] surrender these five my own knowledge
[1:25:36] thoughts casting down all reasonings
[1:25:38] Lord let Thy word be true and every
[1:25:41] man's word Al lie every reasoning every
[1:25:44] doubt be Cast Away and let me walk by
[1:25:46] the super sense the sense of the Holy
[1:25:50] Spirit he goes on to say if the six
[1:25:53] sense says God keeps his word I give
[1:25:55] myself to him I surrender all I got to
[1:25:58] him my S says this will bring it to pass
[1:26:01] my faith in God's word then call
[1:26:03] anything else contrary to it as though
[1:26:06] it wasn't Abraham met God and God said
[1:26:09] you're going to have a baby by Sarah him
[1:26:11] 75 ver 65 Abraham called everything that
[1:26:14] was contrary to that as though it wasn't
[1:26:17] he walked as if he seen God and he
[1:26:20] believed are you hearing are you hearing
[1:26:22] what the prophet said he walked as if he
[1:26:25] seen God he saw God by dreams he saw God
[1:26:29] in Vision he saw God In Lights yes come
[1:26:33] on the prophet walking us through even
[1:26:35] the church ages he received all of these
[1:26:39] visitations and Abraham was called crazy
[1:26:42] because of the vision he was walking by
[1:26:46] but the prophet said one day that which
[1:26:48] I have heard of I now see with my own
[1:26:52] eyes when Isaac came the vision was made
[1:26:57] material but he had to walk through all
[1:27:00] that ridicule he had to walk through all
[1:27:02] that contesting and what was it doing it
[1:27:04] was trying to contest against the word
[1:27:06] that he had received but that word he
[1:27:08] had received had found a bedding
[1:27:11] ground in Abraham's life do you love him
[1:27:14] oh yeah amen let's Stand Together praise
[1:27:18] God he called anything that said that he
[1:27:22] wasn't any reasoning anything else
[1:27:25] that don't make a bit of difference what
[1:27:26] the doctor said right what anybody else
[1:27:29] said what his own mind said what
[1:27:32] anything else said God was right and he
[1:27:35] stayed with
[1:27:36] it and I just love how brother brandham
[1:27:38] in this this prayer he says oh God give
[1:27:42] me more right after this he says God
[1:27:44] give me more of that six sense so that I
[1:27:47] can Minister Faithfully to your
[1:27:50] children I say tonight Lord I want more
[1:27:53] of that six sense amen I want more Faith
[1:27:56] Lord pour it in me Lord you know what
[1:27:59] faith is it's a revelation of God's will
[1:28:02] it might just start with a little
[1:28:03] something here tonight because as God is
[1:28:06] dealing with each of our lives across
[1:28:07] such a spectrum but you know what if we
[1:28:09] can just say Lord I want more of that
[1:28:12] Faith tonight Lord oh God I want more
[1:28:15] just to pour it in Lord Jesus let it
[1:28:18] just so moveed through my life Lord I
[1:28:20] tell you friends he not only will
[1:28:22] dismantle and he dismantle desires but
[1:28:25] he goes right down if we'll just bring
[1:28:28] every thought captive and bring it over
[1:28:31] here well brother Samuel this don't it
[1:28:32] don't seem too bad remember there's a
[1:28:34] lot of terrorists that looked pretty

[1:28:41] don't want to I I don't want you know
[1:28:44] we're living in a day where it's kind of
[1:28:45] like in this agenda and everything but I
[1:28:48] want you to understand I'm not getting
[1:28:50] in a political realm but it's almost got
[1:28:52] into the spiritual realm I don't want to
[1:28:53] offend nobody
[1:28:55] I don't want to do this you know I don't
[1:28:56] you know I got no no no no it's your
[1:28:59] responsibility I don't care what their
[1:29:01] last name is I don't care what their
[1:29:02] origin is I don't care what the thought
[1:29:04] is Bring It subject to the word of
[1:29:08] God are you hearing me cuz many times
[1:29:11] it's those things that we just let we
[1:29:13] can let go and my my
[1:29:17] my ah you know what there's many listen
[1:29:21] there's many many individuals when you
[1:29:24] look at a lot of these things and
[1:29:26] shootings and things and things with
[1:29:28] that that has taking place sometimes
[1:29:30] it's it's it's amazing to me sometimes
[1:29:32] as you know over the years I remember a
[1:29:34] lot of it started out when I was just
[1:29:35] graduating from from uh from college to
[1:29:38] be a teacher out there in Coline that
[1:29:39] was one of the first ones that I
[1:29:41] remembered and it was really big but you
[1:29:43] know what there's things that you you
[1:29:46] start hearing and it's whether it's
[1:29:48] there at a school or whether it's a dad
[1:29:50] or it's a mom or it's somebody sometimes
[1:29:51] it's people you would look at and think
[1:29:53] well these would be respectable citizens
[1:29:55] yeah that's right and all of a sudden
[1:29:58] something got a hold of them right and
[1:30:01] there's things that probably people
[1:30:03] could say oh they wouldn't hurt a
[1:30:05] flea I've heard people tell me that
[1:30:07] about dogs too yeah they weren't Hur to
[1:30:10] flee that's okay they can't have
[1:30:14] mine oh W many times you know what it is
[1:30:17] just got oh no they're real good person
[1:30:18] it's the people that was right around
[1:30:20] them that looked at and said oh don't
[1:30:24] worry about them they're not a threat I
[1:30:25] tell you you better take every threat
[1:30:27] serious are you hearing me I'm not
[1:30:29] talking about out there now that's one
[1:30:31] thing we we're walking if we're walking
[1:30:33] with him we can trust him we can look to
[1:30:35] the Lord are you with me cuz friends if
[1:30:37] we didn't think about it you'd be
[1:30:39] looking everywhere when you go into a
[1:30:40] supermarket and everything I believe in
[1:30:42] knowing your surroundings is that right
[1:30:44] I believe there's right times to go out
[1:30:46] to the store and so forth but you know
[1:30:48] what I don't believe that word meant to
[1:30:49] live in
[1:30:51] fear but I do believe that we should
[1:30:53] bring every thought yes subject to the
[1:30:57] word of
[1:31:00] God sometimes I can remember even in my
[1:31:03] well you know even how the devil would
[1:31:04] still like to try to come the devil
[1:31:06] would try like to try to come and well
[1:31:07] there's nothing to you you don't have
[1:31:09] there's nothing about you you're not
[1:31:11] you're not really part of it you're not
[1:31:12] really going to make it all you say
[1:31:14] Brother Sam you mean the devil would
[1:31:16] actually come and Whisper those things
[1:31:18] do you think he ever stopped
[1:31:20] that but one of these days when I'm
[1:31:22] standing right there and pressing
[1:31:24] through as God gives me Grace day by day
[1:31:26] and Moment by moment I can one day be
[1:31:29] able to say just as he gave me
[1:31:31] overcoming Grace there this is the
[1:31:33] moment of Goodbye World Goodbye
[1:31:37] hallelu Oh hallelujah oh he's no
[1:31:40] respected person listen he rose right up
[1:31:43] in the prophet's bedroom remember
[1:31:46] brother Bram said he was brother Bram
[1:31:48] described how he looked he said he
[1:31:49] looked like one of those Ali he looked
[1:31:51] like Ali oop the cartoon character I
[1:31:53] didn't know what that looked like so I
[1:31:54] had to look it up that's one time I was
[1:31:57] thankful for Google cuz I could pull up
[1:31:58] the image of what Aly oop looked like
[1:32:00] brother BR said he's all big and you
[1:32:02] know what he told the prophet he said
[1:32:03] you're nothing but a bluff you don't got
[1:32:05] no power with god wow and he kept coming
[1:32:10] and brother Bram said finally he said I
[1:32:12] had
[1:32:13] enough and said Satan praise the Lord
[1:32:16] thou are an affront to me get behind
[1:32:21] me he left
[1:32:24] so don't think that he ain't going to
[1:32:25] try to come and don't try to come around
[1:32:28] even sometimes even listen even while
[1:32:30] song leaders are standing here musicians
[1:32:32] are playing he'll try to get and move
[1:32:34] and say well I tell you what look you're
[1:32:35] messing everything up look at you you're
[1:32:37] the one you're you're just all out of
[1:32:38] sorts you just need to walk off the
[1:32:41] platform you think he don't tell
[1:32:44] sometimes even as ministers I'm just
[1:32:45] giving you a little bit of an Insight
[1:32:47] because the very things that you battle
[1:32:49] with when you can come and sit down and
[1:32:50] the enemy says look at you you can't
[1:32:52] even get your mind centered you can't
[1:32:54] even get it right your mind's everywhere
[1:32:56] else well it ain't going to do you no
[1:32:58] good to be here what should you do at
[1:33:00] that time keep sitting and say thank you
[1:33:04] Lord for your mercy you know what you're
[1:33:06] doing you're cutting a hole right
[1:33:08] through that Gloom and that devil praise
[1:33:11] God that's and the angels of God they're
[1:33:15] ready to move
[1:33:17] in and move in God says hold on hold on
[1:33:20] hold on hold on hold on hold on I I want
[1:33:22] you to watch what my son or daughter
[1:33:24] do hallu just want and the ministering
[1:33:27] Spirits they're ready to go they're
[1:33:29] ready to go and Minister wait wait wait
[1:33:31] wait wait wait wait watch even before
[1:33:34] you get to them what just just watch
[1:33:36] them stand right here and they begin to
[1:33:38] just say thank you Lord thank you Lord
[1:33:41] something begins to move oh my the
[1:33:44] angels are marveling and looking and you
[1:33:47] know what they're looking at at the
[1:33:49] effect of what the Holy Ghost is inside
[1:33:53] of the of the believer that
[1:33:55] is yes sir and you know how that's been
[1:33:59] able to happen because the spirit of God
[1:34:01] even sometimes friends when it can
[1:34:03] escape us and get by us but the spirit
[1:34:06] of God will come right back
[1:34:07] around and that thought comes into
[1:34:10] subjection and say wait a minute I'm a
[1:34:13] Believer that's right and I'm going to
[1:34:15] Worship the
[1:34:17] Lord God's got something for me today
[1:34:20] God did not call me here just for
[1:34:21] nothing he's got something for me
[1:34:24] my mind might be a million places all it
[1:34:27] may it may be all so seemingly scattered
[1:34:31] and even if I hit the wrong note I'm
[1:34:32] going to hit the wrong note for the
[1:34:35] Lord are you hearing me sometimes the
[1:34:38] enemy can get where people get up and
[1:34:40] they sing a special sometimes you just
[1:34:42] can't seem to hit the right key or the
[1:34:44] right note it's like brother Bill always
[1:34:47] said from when the church first started
[1:34:49] go
[1:34:50] forward there's no other
[1:34:54] place to go so if you feel like you've
[1:34:58] been hitting wrong notes in your life
[1:35:00] don't put don't set the microphone down
[1:35:02] nope nope no we're not going to mute it
[1:35:05] back there either God's not going to
[1:35:07] mute it around your life you take that
[1:35:12] microphone Lord I'm depending on you
[1:35:15] Lord I'm depending on you
[1:35:18] Lord hallelujah you know what that is
[1:35:21] that's casting down imaginations that
[1:35:23] tells you well you failed here you've
[1:35:24] done this you've done but cast it down
[1:35:26] because why there is a word of
[1:35:31] Grace that comes to lift you and
[1:35:34] I thank you Jes bring it subject to the
[1:35:37] word tonight thank you Father you love
[1:35:40] him amen let's just pray Hallelujah
[1:35:43] heavenly father thank you Father thank
[1:35:46] you for your mercies tonight once again
[1:35:49] Lord
[1:35:51] father I just Lord I'm so thankful ful
[1:35:54] that you're the chief Captain Lord among
[1:35:57] us you're the great five-star general
[1:36:00] you've never lost a battle
[1:36:02] Lord father there's a few victories that
[1:36:07] few things that Lord battles are where
[1:36:09] I've let slip away but I'm so glad that
[1:36:12] the war has already been
[1:36:14] won but Lord
[1:36:16] I I know I can speak not only for me but
[1:36:19] for everybody
[1:36:23] I want to win
[1:36:26] Lord even in battles Lord of areas
[1:36:30] where you've brought me Lord
[1:36:34] too help me Lord It's a moment to
[1:36:37] surrender yeah it's a moment Lord with a
[1:36:41] Readiness to Revenge all
[1:36:44] Disobedience when our obedience is
[1:36:48] fulfilled help us Lord the real
[1:36:50] arresting of our thoughts Lord
[1:36:53] father all of these things Lord and as
[1:36:55] it pertains to our
[1:36:58] lives it's
[1:37:00] surrender it's
[1:37:03] submission Lord may
[1:37:05] we capture every thought don't let those
[1:37:10] thoughts run
[1:37:11] loose like letting somebody questionable
[1:37:15] run through an
[1:37:16] airport that won't happen Lord I've seen
[1:37:18] them where when something got called
[1:37:21] there can be people Lord all of a sudden
[1:37:23] off officer security things can take off
[1:37:26] it's
[1:37:28] questionable help us
[1:37:31] Lord that we would lead captive I think
[1:37:34] how that word
[1:37:36] says bringing into captivity that not
[1:37:39] only means to bring it into captivity
[1:37:42] but
[1:37:43] sometimes that deals with as a part of
[1:37:45] that meaning means lead into
[1:37:50] captivity that our thoughts would be led
[1:37:53] to this place of the word hallelujah
[1:37:57] what does the word
[1:37:58] say that's right Lord
[1:38:02] Jesus how we need you
[1:38:05] Lord Lord I I know I have to I know
[1:38:09] these five senses in order
[1:38:11] to be here upon this Earth but I I want
[1:38:14] to be more in contact with that six
[1:38:17] sense Lord I want more of that six sense
[1:38:20] Lord that faith in my life
[1:38:23] like your Prophet Lord would speak Lord
[1:38:25] to where we're would be walking in that
[1:38:27] world of a perfect Faith a complete
[1:38:30] faith
[1:38:31] Lord walking as Sons and Daughters of
[1:38:34] God help us Lord we want to continue to
[1:38:38] grow Lord we want to Lord God continue
[1:38:41] to mature that all the greenness out of
[1:38:45] our life would be baked out in your
[1:38:47] presence
[1:38:49] Lord Lord help us I
[1:38:52] pray May you Lord God continue to move
[1:38:55] and through the things that we've heard
[1:38:57] Lord you've spoke to our hearts you've
[1:39:00] taken us on this little pathway Lord
[1:39:03] because
[1:39:05] job thought that it was you that was
[1:39:09] doing this to
[1:39:11] him but it wasn't you doing it it was
[1:39:14] you permitting it Satan was doing it but
[1:39:18] Satan was trying to make him think this
[1:39:22] way
[1:39:24] and your Prophet said as long as job
[1:39:26] thought that
[1:39:28] way he was
[1:39:31] whipped in his
[1:39:35] mind Lord God that shows right
[1:39:39] there we do not want Lord our spirit
[1:39:42] help us that our spirit is not
[1:39:46] hijacked and held hostage
[1:39:49] Lord whether it's through affection
[1:39:52] memory con I
[1:39:55] reasoning I don't want to keep them like
[1:39:57] the prophet would use that
[1:39:59] terminology if you'll keep them I don't
[1:40:01] want to keep them Lord right I don't
[1:40:03] want to keep them I know that Lord I
[1:40:06] there's things that I wish I could get
[1:40:07] so far out of my memory I wish there's
[1:40:09] things Lord that I never seen or knew or
[1:40:12] heard but Lord God the way that we keep
[1:40:15] them
[1:40:16] out is by
[1:40:19] receiving something that's
[1:40:21] greater and submitting Lord to you oh
[1:40:25] Lord Divine love has a way of going down
[1:40:29] and
[1:40:30] dismantling
[1:40:32] hurt
[1:40:33] Stingers Lord that can get stuck and it
[1:40:37] has away Lord the Holy Spirit Lord the
[1:40:39] great oil of God and has a way to move
[1:40:42] down lord and move through the gates of
[1:40:44] our spirit Lord and through those
[1:40:46] channels Lord God oh as we'll take the
[1:40:49] word of God in Lord it'll come from the
[1:40:52] inside
[1:40:54] out and it'll blow those things out Lord
[1:40:58] amen
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:00] father I want my channels blown out
[1:41:04] Lord I want to stay in that way Lord I
[1:41:07] don't want things to accumulate
[1:41:09] sometimes Lord it can get to a matter
[1:41:11] and all of a sudden there's just been an
[1:41:14] accumulation and you realize oh my
[1:41:16] goodness where did all of this come
[1:41:19] from Lord we don't see it until we see
[1:41:24] it and we can only see it as you give us

[1:49:05] fellowship you had with
[1:49:08] job that sweet and precious
[1:49:12] communion between you and job where you
[1:49:15] had spoke to his
[1:49:17] heart and his heart had been wooed to
[1:49:21] submission and it was a life Lord that
[1:49:24] was lived according to your word no
[1:49:27] written bible at that time only what was
[1:49:30] written in the heavens but job Knew You
[1:49:34] by Revelation and that's the most

[1:49:50] God and Lord the real your true reality

[1:50:02] Revelation that job was holding in his
[1:50:05] life and had a hold on him one
[1:50:09] day job came forth with a testimony at

[1:50:15] heard of thee with a hearing of the year
[1:50:18] but now mine eyes seeth thee Oh God here
