i'm pressing i'm going up yonder i'm going up yonder to be with my lord [Music] amen that's where i'm going if anybody asks you where's the matter with him where's he going i'm going up yonder because death ain't going to change me the only the only death that brings the changes by the new birth right here but that physical death is not going to change us what we are here is what we will be over there if we're identified with him here we'll be there we will be in the rapture amen because he's coming to claim what belongs to him death will not change us at all it only moves us from one place to the other it's like right now the time that we're living in you're going to the nurseries or other things to buy plants to plant they grow them to a certain place a height and then you take them home after that time you gotta you actually got to put them in a bigger pot or put them inside of your beds or your landscaping you know why they've reached a full growth in that pot and they need room to expand that's why brother branham tells us in the future home he says the rapture itself will be a transplanting so it's taking what was here and moving it there oh glory be to god amen i'm glad that he's still working on me amen aren't you glad there's a desire in your heart to serve god to please him to live for him amen we didn't put that there god put that there but may we so surrender to the god who placed it there and makes that desire come to a reality may we so surrender ourselves to him and say god everything that you have desired and what you put in my heart i want to release lord i want to release myself amen just so glad to see each and every one of you just good to be in the house of the lord amen we thank god for these beautiful days we've had i just think thank the lord so much for that and and um so we must we might as well enjoy it from what i understand you know and everybody always says well it's ohio i hear that from people in arizona i hear that from people that so that's just not an ohio thing i hear from people new mexico everybody always says stick around amen but i'm so i'm glad that we're on well in our way on spring here i want to just before i invite brother jerry here to come i want to just remind you the announcement was set out for the memorial day meetings there's details on that announcement of the service times as well as the lord willing the dinner that will be there on sunday afternoon after that service so if you'll just just look at that and just make preparations for that and let's just have just really our hearts and be in prayer for those services as well and don't just wait and be in prayer for them but be in prayer for every service because we come whatever we come expecting we'll receive and i tell you right now we ought to expect big things we ought to expect big things right here this morning because there's nothing greater than god nothing no situation is greater than the lord god's above all of that also i know the prayer request was sent out to continue to remember sister linda cavillo in prayer and we just asked that you just really just continue to do that different ones as they come to your heart in the assembly different brothers and sisters as they come to your hearts and just just just pray you might be on the job you might be driving and other things let's let's be in prayer for one another amen there's things that when god puts something on your heart you want to respond to that and you know it just god is mindful of each of our needs sometimes we can get in trouble of second thinking and second guessing ourselves you know i've got in trouble of that of many times of thinking i should have sent this text or i should have called here i should have done that but no i don't want to bother this i don't want to bother that and there was a situation here this morning i won't go into but i'm glad i hate it to the lord amen because it was very much needed and god is so mindful he's mindful of us isn't he amen and i believe that this morning as we come together i want to say it just um just a great privilege to have brother jerry here and i just i just wanted to be able just to sit and glean and feed as well with you so we just want to just pull on the gift of god and we say it very often but it's very true it's not brother jerry that has control over this service it's not the gift in his life that has control over the service god comes down and uses that gift based on the needs in our life and i'll tell you right now if you pull on the gift of god whatever your need is you go to pulling on that just whatever it is you can be in you're praying in your heart and you just begin to pull and god will take the direction that he's already seen for this service and god can take the man of god right off of his notes or those things just begin to come out of what god's already god already knows and has had him to study on so to remember that that in this service we've not come to be spectators we've come to get in we've come to pull on the gift of god we've not come to just hear things that go along with what we think or i believe this or i feel this but we've come here to pull on the gift of god where our shortcomings are we want to know we want to know and the grace of god that shows us from where we are to where we need to be amen i i want that this morning amen we want that this morning don't we how many say lord i'm gonna pull i'm gonna pull on the gift of god like that like that woman with an issue of blood i know that the lord jesus has what i have need of amen could we just stand amen and let's just sing that little course as our brother would come touching jesus is all that really matters there was a woman who tried many positions [Music] yet grew worse so to jesus she came and when the crowd [Music] tried to restrain her she whispered [Music] these words through her pain she whispered these words oh touching jesus is all that really matters and then [Music] one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name let's just hang it again oh touching jesus it's all that really matters in your life will never be the same [Music] and there's only one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name amen you may be seated just for a moment that's the question i sing this song pray for my my voice isn't what it used to be sometimes i have trouble singing on the key or keeping my voice from cracking but we sing for the glory of god [Music] my heart is like a house one day i let the savior in [Music] there are many rules [Music] we would visit now and then but then one day he saw that door i knew the day had come too soon i said jesus i'm not ready [Music] for us to visit in that room cause that's the place in my heart where even i don't go i got some things in there i don't want no one to know but he handed me the keys there's a love on his face he said i want to make you clean [Music] let me go in your secret place [Music] and as i opened up the door and the devils walked in i was so ashamed his light revealed my hidden sin but when i think about that dream now i'm not ashamed anymore because i know my insane [Music] no longer hides behind that door it was a place in my heart where even i wouldn't go [Music] i had some thanks in there i didn't want no one to know but he handed me the king there's the love on his face he made me clean [Music] i let him in my secret place is there a place in your heart where even you don't go you got some things in there you don't want no one to know well he's handing you the key [Music] here's the love on his face he'll make you clean let him go in your secret place [Applause] praise the lord you stand with me go to the lord in prayer before we read the scripture this morning father lord we come to you now at this point in time of this service lord father turning to the word lord we're looking for you to come father to speak to the people lord you knowing their needs god as they would pull on you lord this morning from you what they have need of the answers that they need and the salvation they need restoration they need whatever it is lord they need lord let them just pull on you this morning dear god and may you come and just minister in a way that father would be encouraging will be uplifting dear god would would bring peace to the individual's lord we ask god that you have your complete will way in this service in jesus name i'd like to read from jeremiah chapter 29 begin at verse 11 through 13. what i would like to speak on this morning is before i know the plans i have for you jeremiah 29 11 says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end that ye shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart amen you may be seated in the new international translation it says for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not harm you plans to give you hope and a future this letter this was a letter that was sent to the israelites that were in babylon in captivity they had been taken captive from jerusalem and god told them that they were going to remain in captivity for a long time but he told them to go ahead and to build homes and plant gardens and raise families and then god added that after 70 years of babylon had been fulfilled that he would turn his attention toward them and make good on his promise to bring them back to jerusalem and he guaranteed them that he wouldn't forget him and their hope of returning home would come true god kept his promise to the israelites when he sent the king of persia king cyrus and he conquered babylon and then after cyrus congress he allowed the jews to return home so after 70 years of captivity they were able to go back to jerusalem because of the promise of the lord and he said then you'll call on me and come and pray to me and i'll listen to you that's what they did he said you'll seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart turn me to philippians chapter 4 verses 6 through 9. be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus finally brother whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you we all want peace mankind wants peace in their hearts they want personal peace and the way to get this piece is through prayer and supplication he says when you you should call on me and you'll pray and i'm going to hear you he said he would hear us when we pray and it's it's through prayer and you know many times you're looking for maybe an answer to something and you want a piece about it and you think well i'll go in prayer and i'll ask god and then god's going to come down and he's going to give me an answer and then i'll have peace that isn't the way it always works what gives you peace is the presence of god that you know no matter what comes you're going to weather the storm no matter what direction needs to be taken god's going to direct you that way whatever needs to be said is going to be said whatever needs to be done is going to be done because you're following the lord so your peace rests in him not yourself if god just come down and told you do this and do this and do this and you say well if i do all those things i'll have peace or if i say this certain thing i'll have peace or if i handle this situation a certain way i'll have peace you would be dependent upon yourself but god wants you to be dependent upon him for your peace so there's times you go into prayer when you go into prayer you get into the presence of god and brother branham says once you get into the presence of god he says sometimes we talk too much we need to just get quiet and begin to listen and see what god will do once we get in his presence and it's the presence of god that settles down around you and gives you that peace i remember years ago when i was uh going to i was in need of back surgery and it was the very first one and i didn't know what to do and i talked to the surgeon and i told him i said well i'm going to have to pray about this he said well you go pray about it mr browning and when you're done then you call me back up and tell me what your answer is and so i said all right so i went to prayer and you know i never one time said god what should i do about my back i never one time asked god god what should i do should i have this surgery or not instead i just got down and i prayed and i prayed for different ones and i worshiped the lord until the presence of god come down then i just got quiet and i just bathed in his presence and you know there was a peace that come down and settle around me i was able to get up then and go on the phone and tell the surgeon i know everything's going to be all right go ahead and schedule the surgery that's the way the peace of god comes why because you're trusting in him i wasn't trusting in the doctor i'm sure the surgeon was was a good surgeon and and and you know after you talk to him you have confidence but it wasn't him and his abilities it was god that i was trusting in i had to uh i had to have three back surgeries in my life the third surgery i talked to a orthopedic surgeon and he said we're gonna have to fuse some bones together and he said uh uh he said that's all i do i don't operate nothing else except the back and he says so he said but i can do my best to what i know what to do he said but then it'll take god to heal it and fuse those bones together when he said that i knew i had the right surgeon i knew you know he was talking about depending on god i was dependent on god so we went ahead with the surgery you know somebody said to me one time said brother i i wanted to give a testimony you know but if i thought i had a back problem that you had but god healed me and i and i said well you go ahead and give a testimony because i knew god healed me too i might have had to add the surgery but you know why i was laying on my back do you know how many messages i got do you know how many sermons came to me and things i studied while i was laying on my back i didn't have any time to do anything else but just laid there so god wanted me laid up for a while god's got a plan for each and every one of us and he knows what it is we might not know his plan but god knows the plan he has for you if you're not positively sure this morning that you have that peace of god then you need to you need to get it i'd raise my hand to god and i'd say god i want the peace that passes all understanding amen i want to surrender i want to i want to come now i want to re-consecrate myself to you look there's nothing in your life that's hid from god god knows everything you know you might be able to put on a front to other people but you can't with god god sees right through it it's just like people come and offer excuses why they why they can't go to church or why they weren't there and everything else and i said well i'll accept it but i don't know whether god will or not hallelujah you know when we see things that seem to be going wrong and you you feel like that peace is escaping you that's when you need to go back to the foundation that's when you need to come back to god get back on your knees and if it's so be it tear down whatever you think you've built up and get back down to the foundation because it doesn't matter how tall you built your defenses up you know the higher they are the harder they fall and uh you know the you know what gets in your way many times or most of the time i'll tell you what gets in my way most of the time is jerry browning brother branham said the biggest enemy he had was william branham he said you need to let loose and let god too many times we try to take it into our hands and see what we can do about it we think if we can get it figured out then we'll have that peace if we can get our plans on order then we figure well once i got my plans all down know what i'm going to do then i'm going to have some peace but friends you know what this whole world wasn't set up under your plans this whole world was created under god's plans mankind was created under god's plan and in god's way god created the heavens and the earth in his way according to his plans man's tried to alter things and make things according to their plans and it just won't work out here not long ago they took and they transplanted a pig's heart into a man it didn't work he died that wasn't the way god intended it but i'll tell you one thing i know a great physician who can create a new heart without ever even opening your cavity i know a god that can set it straight without you ever even have to go through anesthesia my goodness if a pig's heart's the closest they can get to man we're hurting if we're going to depend on man but god had his own plans and god created man he spoke him into existence then he went down and and and took from the dirt and the elements and he created a body for man to live in and you know some friends god created that body to live forever it was perfect adam was never going to grow old eve was never going to grow old they were never going to die you say well could they get cut yeah but friends your body today testifies it'll heal itself you get a cut you just put something on it put a band-aid around the next thing you know it's mended that's god's creation that's god's plan man can take and say well i i'll make a uh something to help you along you know but god can grow legs god can grow eyes like that that young girl that came up there and didn't have any eyes and brother brandon prayed for and he said and said she went to walk away and he said just a minute i forgot to ask you what color of eyes you wanted that's god that's god's plan amen we've got to let go as long as you got yourself in the way god can't do anything brother ram says i just i got to get out of the way and then god can go to work lay aside those weights he said you can't he says give time to old-fashioned heartfelt pouring out of the lord jesus christ until the holy ghost pours down upon your soul and you get beside yourself anybody ever got beside themselves you don't know you ain't paying attention to anybody else what's going on with them what they're doing in church anybody else raising their hand if they're saying it or not you've just got off beside yourself in a world all your own just you and jesus in a crowd of people you can do it no matter where you're at you don't got to be in church you can be wherever you are and just get along with the lord i i get out driving and you know i i get to drive and i get to thinking on the things of the lord and and it just goes into automatic pilot wherever i went the last time i was driving that's where i end up that might not have been where i intended to go but that's where i end up and when i got my co-pilot with me she'll say uh you were supposed to turn here remember you're going to the bank but you can get along with just you and jesus amen he said you know you can't be with yourself and with jesus too you can't you have to find out the biggest enemy you got if i can get william branham out of the way think about this now if i can get william branham out of the way jesus can have a wonderful time hallelujah you know that's what we need to do when we get in service we need to get ourself out of the way it's our self that's hindering us from having a good service it's our self that's hindering us from from being able to feel the presence of god when it comes down get yourself out of the way he said brother adam how do you see visions he said i get myself out of the way and then it just happens it's god he said it's not me it's god in the man hallelujah he said but the biggest enemy i got is william branham he's always in my way he's always in god's way he always gets in god's way he's too tired he don't want to do this he don't want to do that if i can crucify that guy then god can use me how many times you know you feel well i'm just too tired to do this boy that's just a hassle i don't feel like doing that what is it it's your own flesh getting in your way but you need to crucify that flesh die out to it like i said the other day you only got one time to be mortal and that's now you imagine when the children of israel got down there and where they had them egyptian taskmasters that had been whipping them and forcing them to do things then they got down there and got on the other side of the red sea and then the red sea fell in and just drowned all their taskmasters no wonder they had a hallelujah breakdown it ain't no wonder that moses began to sing it's no wonder that that marian picked up her tambourine and began to dance and the daughters of god began to dance before the lord why they were having a glorious time their enemy had been destroyed and that's what we need to do destroy the enemy and brother adam said the biggest enemy is ourselves drown it hallelujah it's a reason we can't rise up in faith many times you know we're human and we'll get maybe a pain i hear some uh last year some months for months and months i had this pain in the back of my head and it wouldn't go away i'd take tylenol whatever else and i was going to the doctor and the pain wouldn't go and it was just there all the time and i was getting to where i was learning to live with it just go on and do what i needed to do with the pain there every day i got up every night i went to bed the pain was just there and you know there was a little voice in my shoulder and kept telling me you know what you've got some kind of tumor or something in your head and that's why it's causing you all this pain but i said i'm not going to accept that because i know that death can't take me till it's my time to go and it ain't my time to go until god's finished with me and as long as god's using me then i've got something to do here yet that's god's plan and god knows the plan he has for my life come to find out my blood pressure the medicine wasn't controlling it kept going back kept going back to the doctor i don't know how many times i went back started he went to the new doctors finally got it under control and the pain left i said see there devil it wasn't no tumor i'm you might want me to fall over dead but i'm not going to not yet brother branham said he said the devil hates me and i know he hates you too and he's my enemy but as long as god is my friend i don't have to fear the devil i'll just drive him back just take the word of god and move him right on back out of the place that he thinks he's holding and he has no thr strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right to anywhere he's just a devil he hasn't got a legal right to any man that's accepted the promise of jesus christ he's whipped yes sir he swept in sickness he swept in disappointments he swept in everything he swept in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is is a big old shadow he's just the devil hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah second corinthians chapter 10 verse 4. for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds we're not facing the devil with carnal weapons we're not facing our enemy with carnal weapons you know carnal weapons uh man progressed with them first they started out with stones and then you know they progressed putting them together making some kind of weapon out of them and then they put a stick and a stone together and made an arrow you know and then they made a spear and then they realized well if i put a a a stick to a string and and pull it back well i've got a bow and i can shoot that arrow and then they progress from there onto muskets you know if i pack this ball down in here on some top of some powder some black powder then it'll shoot off the end of this and then then they progress from there to the to the remington you know and they had uh a 22 and then they progressed from there and then they had the 38 and then they had different things you know and then shotguns and then they they had a machine gun and and then they had the atomic bomb but god gave us the best weapon he could at the start god didn't give us something just to suffice and get by with and say well i'll think of something better later on but god give us the greatest thing he could give mankind and that was prayer prayer changes things prayer can even change the mind of god it did one time a man was was told by the prophet you're going to die he went god turned his face to the wall cried before god and prayed and god come down and said i'll give you a little more time prayer is more powerful than an atomic weapon hallelujah what we need to do is humble ourselves we're not there's no big eyes and little hues humble ourselves and get down before god and pray and you know it doesn't matter how it doesn't matter what position you're in when you pray some people think they got to kneel down to pray you don't have to kneel down to pray unless that's just what you're feeling you know we come to the altar and we kneel before the lord and that's fine but you can pray in a prostate position they did in the bible you can pray standing up you can pray walking around you can pray driving down the road you can pray doing dishes you can pray doing the laundry you can pray mowing the lawn it doesn't have to be no special time for prayer you can you can pray paul said i would the mankind would pray all the time hallelujah praise the lord the bible said we should be able to boldly say the lord is my helper i shall not fear boldly say it the lord is my helper i shall not fear amen in everything we face god is our helper he's the one that's in control the woman said well i was trusting god to the rings broke brother brahman said that's the very time to trust god when he leaves your control i'll tell you what there's been many i i'm the kind of guy the way i'm made up you know as a human i always try to solve things i always try to figure it out and find out how i can solve it my wife says you know you're trying to build a bridge before you get there i said what if i get there and there ain't no bridge i want to have material to build the bridge with you know i'm always trying to look ahead and make plans and figure out it's like playing a game of chess figure out the next move but that ain't that ain't how it is with god you got to turn loose to that realize it's in god's hands it's his plan for your life god's got a plan god knows what he's doing hallelujah there was a woman named miss weber the time of the prophet she was in the hospital and she was dying and she had been part of some some kind of uh government uh office and the women she had worked with the government office come down to visit her in the hospital and she said i know if i can get brother bill just to come pray for me i'll be all right she said the doctors gave up my cousin opal to cancer said she had to mourning to live brother branham she said brother bill come prayed for and said the lord healed her and she's still alive and those women that come to visit all that old guy said he he's nothing to him he's a big fake they're just mind reader and they they said you know uh all that religion just a bunch of fanaticism and and that woman miss weber later she said uh hold on just a minute i might be laying here dying but i ain't gonna stand for that she said i watched him grow up from a boy i've lived in this community all my life and i've saw him and watched his life she said i know that god's in him and she said and i know if he'll pray for me i'll be healed and i'll live brother branham said when she stuck up for god that way he said the angel lord just happened to be listening he said the angel of the lord heard that and so he came to brother brown brother i heard the angel lord walk in the door walked over to me and he said i heard what miss weber said and said she stuck up for me said now you go to church tomorrow they're going to bring her to service she's going to be sitting over on the left side about so far back and you tell her that i heard what she said and that she's healed and she's going to live hallelujah don't be afraid to stand up for god [Applause] friends i'll tell you what the doctors might have had their plan and what they thought was going to happen to miss weber but god had a different plan do you know how the angel lord just happened to hear what she was that he happened to be there and hear it because he knows she was going to say it god knew knows what's on the inside of you friends god knows you better than you know yourself god knows exactly what you're going to do in any situation that's why it allows it to come your way have you considered my servant job there is none like him in all the world now i'm going to tell you something as a human i hope god never says that about me but he said if you consider my servant job there's none like him in all the world and satan said yeah but you got a hedge around him i can't touch him he said but if you'll remove that head she says i'll make him curse you god knew what job would do god said go ahead well i want to prove you wrong i want you to see just how wrong you are you know you're just fully yourself right now god knew what job would do he knew how job would act oh sure job the the flesh side of job did get the question why is this happening to me and of course he had just comforters you know something how they call them comforters you are a secret sinner job you've done something wrong brother braham said just because you're going through something doesn't mean you've done anything wrong it's just god showing what you will do god's not doing it just to find out what you'll do god had plans for you to be on this earth and he had plans for what he wanted you to do and each one of you has got a purpose to serve and i don't care what kind of sickness you'll get nothing and can take you out of this world until you've served that purpose that god sent you here for you know brother jack cole he was a mighty man of faith brother benham called him a bulldog of faith and he he would pray for the sick and and they would get healed you know and then he caught a disease and died and people begin to say well it's because he got off of the word and so god took him brother rem said that's not slow he said death can't take you until god's finished with you whatever purpose god sent you here for until that's been resolved you're here you might as well face it hallelujah god can do the same thing for you he did for miss weber if you'll just stick up for god he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah you know brother branham might not be here to call you out call you by name tell you where you're from tell you what your address says tell you the last time you saw the doctor or who he was with or whatever but the same god that did all that stuff still here and it ain't that it ain't that's not what we're looking for anyway what you want's healing it wouldn't do you a bit of good if somebody come over here and told you your name and didn't know you and told you your name and nothing happened what we want is to be healed and the one who who spoke through brother branham at that time and and brought out those things that was god you've me many times on the messages you hear brother man i'm just kind of at the end just kind of thought he said oh you all know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on him and then he would say now he's here he's he's jesus christ the same yesterday today forever he's still the same god the same god that healed back then it's the same god that heals today the same god that saved back then is the same god that saves today he's still in the business of salvation hallelujah he's still in the business of deliverance hallelujah and you know what he does with his word that's the weapon he's given you that's not a carnal weapon that's the weapon that jesus christ used hallelujah for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not harm you plans to give you hope and a future and after after 70 years of
