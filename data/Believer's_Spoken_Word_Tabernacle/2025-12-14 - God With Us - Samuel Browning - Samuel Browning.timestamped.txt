[26:45] be happy. Oh, oh, sing it one more time.
[26:49] Oh, will everybody
[26:52] Oh yes, Lord.
[26:54] For everyone.
[26:57] Oh, over there
[27:00] we will shout. We're going to sing
[27:05] everybody
[27:08] over there.
[27:10] Well, now I'm so glad I crossed over the
[27:15] line. Well, now I'm so glad I cross
[27:19] further, but I'll talk about the line
[27:23] that separates the darkness from the
[27:26] light. I'm so glad.
[27:30] Oh, sing now. Oh, well, I'm so glad I
[27:35] cross over.
[27:37] But, aren't you glad? I'm so glad I
[27:40] crossed over.
[27:42] I talk about the line that separates the
[27:46] darkness from the light. I'm so glad I
[27:49] cross.
[27:51] Oh, well, I was traveling along the back
[27:55] roads. I was heading in the wrong
[27:57] direction. Oh, will Satan thought he
[28:00] surely had? Oh, my soul locked and
[28:03] bound. But it was through God's love and
[28:06] mercy. Oh, his grace turn me around and
[28:09] I'm back.
[28:11] Oh, how many's glad this morning? Oh,
[28:14] we're singing. I'm so glad I crossed
[28:18] over. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad I
[28:22] cross.
[28:24] I'll talk about the line that separates.
[28:29] Well, I'm so
[28:34] hallelujah. Well, I said down the wrong
[28:37] direction. Oh my sin was dark as night.
[28:40] Oh my savior was standing between. Oh my
[28:44] soul and a light but my Jesus gave me a
[28:48] light to shine when he saved this soul
[28:51] mine and I'm glad. Oh how many is that
[28:54] this morning? Hallelujah. Well now I'm
[28:58] so glad I cross so good line. Well, I
[29:02] sing it. I'm so glad I cross.
[29:07] I talk about the love that separates the
[29:10] darkness from the light. I'm so glad.
[29:16] Oh, well, I was heading down the wrong
[29:19] direction. Oh, my sin was dark as night.
[29:23] Oh, well, Satan was standing between.
[29:26] Oh, my soul and the light. Oh my Jesus
[29:29] gave me a light to shine. Oh yes.
[29:34] And I'm glad
[29:36] this morning. Oh well now I'm so glad I
[29:42] cross over the line. Well now I'm so
[29:46] glad.
[29:49] I'll talk about the line that separates
[29:52] the darkness from the light. I'm so
[29:55] glad.
[29:58] Oh, one more time. Well, now I'm so glad
[30:03] we crossed over the light. Well, now I'm
[30:07] so glad I'm crossing.
[30:10] I'm talking about the line that
[30:13] separates the darkness from the light.
[30:16] I'm so glad
[30:18] over in time.
[30:22] Hallelujah.
[30:25] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Aren't
[30:29] you glad you crossed over the line this
[30:31] morning? Hallelujah. You know what the
[30:34] best part about it is? Amen. Satan can't
[30:36] get through that.
[30:39] He He can do whatever he wants to do. He
[30:41] can tell you whatever he wants to tell
[30:43] you, whatever he wants to say. Amen. But
[30:45] you've already crossed over the line.
[30:46] Amen. What he says doesn't matter. Amen.
[30:48] It's what he says matters.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. Amen.
[30:55] Hallelujah. I was just having a little
[30:56] good time there for a second. Amen.
[30:59] Don't you appreciate his presence this
[31:01] morning.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing that song.
[31:05] Amen. I may hungry for the word of God
[31:07] this morning.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I certainly am, too. Amen. Amen.
[31:12] Let's sing that song. Amen.
[31:14] Hallelujah. Well, I just lost it right
[31:16] here. That's not good.
[31:18] Amen. When he reached down his hand for
[31:20] me, let's sing that song this morning as
[31:22] brother Samuel comes. Amen. Aren't you
[31:24] glad that he reached out his hand for
[31:25] you?
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't have to, but he did
[31:28] because he loves you so much.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, once my soul
[31:36] was astray
[31:39] from the heavenly
[31:42] way.
[31:44] Oh, I was wretched
[31:48] and bound.
[31:52] warm as could be.
[31:56] Lord my savior
[31:59] from above
[32:01] and gave me peace,
[32:04] joy and love.
[32:07] That's when he came
[32:13] for me. Aren't you glad this morning?
[32:19] When he reach
[32:21] out
[32:26] all help me sing it this morning.
[32:30] Oh when you reach
[32:35] oh for me
[32:41] I was lost.
[32:44] I was undone.
[32:46] I was without God
[32:50] for his son. But I'm so glad that he
[32:53] reach
[32:55] down his hand
[32:58] for me.
[33:03] Oh, I was here
[33:07] ringing despair
[33:10] when he came when he came to me there.
[33:15] Oh, he showed me.
[33:20] Oh yes, Lord.
[33:23] Oh, hallelujah, Lord.
[33:30] Oh, thank you, Jesus. You gave me glory
[33:35] complete.
[33:37] Oh, when he reach
[33:41] down
[33:44] for me. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[33:48] Oh, when he reached
[33:52] down his hand.
[33:56] Oh, for you and for me.
[34:03] Oh, yes, Lord.
[34:06] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[34:11] Oh, I was lost.
[34:14] I was undone
[34:17] without God
[34:20] for the son. That's where he reached
[34:25] down his hand
[34:28] for me. Oh, sing it one more time.
[34:33] Oh, when he reach
[34:36] &gt;&gt; down his hand.
[34:40] Oh, aren't you glad about that this
[34:43] morning.
[34:46] Oh, he reached.
[34:49] Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, how we
[34:52] thank you, Lord Jesus. How we thank you,
[34:55] Lord. Oh, I was lost.
[34:58] I was a dumb. I was without God.
[35:03] God or his son. That's when he reached
[35:09] down his head.
[35:12] Oh.
[35:14] Oh. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[35:18] Let's sing that song. Have your way.
[35:20] Have your way. Amen. How many wants the
[35:23] Lord just to have his way this morning?
[35:25] Amen.
[35:27] Amen.
[35:29] Amen.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, have your way.
[35:38] Have your way,
[35:41] Lord. Have your way.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit,
[35:53] come fill our hearts.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord God. have your
[36:00] name.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, soul.
[36:05] And as we wait,
[36:09] we wait on you, Lord.
[36:13] And as we pray,
[36:16] we pray unto you
[36:20] because speak your word
[36:24] into our hearts
[36:28] and have your way. Oh, let's sing it all
[36:33] together once again. Have your way. Oh,
[36:37] have your way.
[36:42] Have your way.
[36:45] Have your way.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy
[36:54] Spirit,
[36:56] fill our hearts
[37:00] and have your way. As we wait,
[37:07] oh, and as we wait.
[37:11] We wait all you long
[37:15] and as we
[37:20] pray unto you
[37:23] speak your word
[37:27] to our hearts
[37:31] and heaven.
[37:43] Hallelujah.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[37:52] Amen. So good to be here this morning.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um
[37:58] so so appreciate seeing each and one of
[38:00] you and I know some weren't able to make
[38:02] it and um we always kind of leave that
[38:05] to the discretion of each one and but
[38:07] I'm thankful that God made a way that we
[38:10] could be here
[38:11] &gt;&gt; and um others that would be connecting
[38:14] and through streaming and so forth. But
[38:17] it's good to be together.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in his presence. And uh
[38:21] I certainly always believe every time we
[38:23] come together, God has something for us.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; And he knows just what we have need of.
[38:28] And sometimes it's not exactly that we
[38:32] see what God is seeing, but God knows
[38:35] what lays just right ahead. And God is
[38:38] always working to prepare us
[38:41] &gt;&gt; uh for victory.
[38:43] He's he's not a God does not relish in
[38:46] defeat but he rejoices in the victory in
[38:50] our lives and that victory is his word.
[38:53] It's where his will has had been able to
[38:57] prevail over our own will and so we
[39:01] that's a that's a very great thing.
[39:03] Amen. I think how brother Ram says it in
[39:06] um
[39:08] God be with us where be all the
[39:10] miracles. And he says at the end of it,
[39:12] he said, "God, if there's been anything
[39:15] accomplished in this past year in our
[39:18] lives, it's because your spirit
[39:22] &gt;&gt; has overrode our stubborn rebellion
[39:27] &gt;&gt; that your word might be fulfilled
[39:28] through us."
[39:30] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Brother Sammy, I'm a
[39:31] believer." Brother Brandham was a
[39:32] believer too. Brother Bram was not
[39:34] praying that because of the people
[39:36] there. But you see, it's when you be
[39:38] begin to see those things within us and
[39:41] recognize by the word to be able to
[39:44] separate what is the son and daughter of
[39:46] God and that other part that's around
[39:49] us. Because remember the quickening
[39:52] power never come to bring uh the dirt to
[39:55] life. It come to bring the seed on the
[39:58] inside. And so what grace, what grace
[40:01] that God has given us. Amen. Let's just
[40:03] stand. And I want to say thank you to
[40:05] the musicians and um just so good to be
[40:08] together.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; And um
[40:19] you have to forgive me. I forgot. I
[40:21] standing here looking at it. I'm
[40:22] thinking that's not the text I'm using.
[40:25] So, I forgot on my first couple slides
[40:27] to put my text in, but um we're going to
[40:30] go to Isaiah chapter 7
[40:33] here this morning and um
[40:38] to get into our our thought here. So
[40:44] Isaiah chapter 7
[40:47] and verse uh verse 10
[40:57] and I want to work with this um
[41:00] scripture if the Lord will help us here
[41:01] for the next little bit. And um
[41:07] I understand that this is the the
[41:09] Christmas season, but this is the text
[41:11] I'm taking is not because of the
[41:13] Christmas Christmas season.
[41:16] Uh this the text that I'm taking is just
[41:18] really the burden that's been on my
[41:20] heart for actually uh a few months and
[41:25] uh throughout weeks has just continued
[41:27] to compile as we've been going through
[41:29] this in Leviticus chapter 8. And uh so I
[41:33] I believe that God will help us to see
[41:35] the the thought within this. And um so
[41:40] let's read here in Isaiah chapter 7 and
[41:43] verse 10.
[41:45] Moreover, the Lord spake again unto
[41:47] Ahaz, saying, "Ask thee a sign of the
[41:50] Lord thy God, and ask it either in the
[41:53] depth or in the height above." But Ahaz
[41:56] said, "I will not ask, neither will I
[41:59] tempt the Lord. And he said, "Hear ye
[42:02] now, oh house of David. It is a small
[42:06] thing for you to weary men, but will you
[42:09] weary my God also?"
[42:13] Therefore, the Lord himself shall give
[42:15] you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall
[42:19] conceive and bear a son, and shall call
[42:22] his name Emmanuel.
[42:25] Butter and honey shall he eat that he
[42:27] may know to refuse the evil and choose
[42:30] the good. For behold, for before the
[42:33] child shall know to refuse the evil and
[42:35] to choose the good, the land that thou
[42:37] aboreest shall be forsaken of both her
[42:41] kings. Let's just ask the Lord's
[42:44] blessing here upon his word here this
[42:46] morning.
[42:49] Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we just
[42:52] come before you, Lord, here this morning
[42:54] and just uh are so thankful that God
[42:58] that you have uh made a way that we
[43:00] could be here. We thank you, Father, for
[43:04] just giving strength, Lord, in in our
[43:07] body, Lord, for for just giving for
[43:10] touching us, Lord. And Father, watching
[43:13] over us upon the roads. And we just Lord
[43:16] we so thank you for your mercies Lord
[43:18] here this morning. It's just such a
[43:20] privilege Lord that to be able to come
[43:24] Lord and to gather Lord around the word
[43:26] of God. Now we Lord are asking that Lord
[43:30] that you would just now take Lord the
[43:33] word take our lives and God may you open
[43:37] the word and reveal yourself unfold it
[43:41] to our lives and may we may we see and
[43:44] may we hear your voice oh God and may we
[43:48] Lord just move with grace Lord to act
[43:51] upon your word we pray we just Lord
[43:54] commit this service now into your hands
[43:56] and ask that you would just be with
[43:59] every need, Lord, that's been spoken and
[44:01] unspoken. Those that are able to be here
[44:04] and those that are streaming, Lord, may
[44:06] your presence, Lord, just move just so
[44:09] freely, Lord, right here among us, Lord.
[44:11] And just, oh God, to convey that burden,
[44:15] Lord, that you have placed, Lord, in my
[44:17] heart, Father, as a man, I'm
[44:20] insufficient, Lord, to to do this, Lord.
[44:23] But, Father, I'm trusting in you. You
[44:25] are my sufficiency and Lord, we're
[44:28] looking to you that God that it's what
[44:31] you desire to deliver, Lord. So, I just
[44:34] commit myself and this congregation into
[44:37] your hands and we ask for your perfect
[44:38] will, Lord, here this morning. And we
[44:41] thank you, Father, for your mercy once
[44:43] again in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God
[44:47] bless you. You may be seated.
[44:52] Um, I want to take with this focus and
[44:57] just to kind of focus our attention here
[45:01] for a few moments on God with us because
[45:06] that is the name or his name being
[45:10] called Emmanuel is God with us or with
[45:15] us is God. And in the book of Matthew,
[45:21] remember it even with all of this being
[45:25] uh prophesied
[45:27] and known
[45:28] uh the prophet, I love how he uh
[45:31] dramatizes this in the message. Um and
[45:35] with this of Joseph and Mary and just
[45:38] speaking how that even in their
[45:41] uh courtship of how that they were
[45:44] fellowshipping about the promise of
[45:47] Isaiah and in that promise of Isaiah,
[45:51] you know, brother Brandham was
[45:52] dramatizing it of how that when they
[45:54] went to the synagogue, they uh were
[45:57] hearing uh things expressed such as just
[46:01] God being a God of history and that of
[46:04] the Red Sea and and and so forth. But as
[46:08] they fellowshipped, there was things
[46:10] that
[46:11] it's so as believers, it just something
[46:14] wasn't resonating just right. And I
[46:16] think how that when you know, Joseph in
[46:20] that drama would actually begin to
[46:23] express about that of Isaiah
[46:26] and you know, they were talking what do
[46:28] you think about this? And Joseph just
[46:30] simply said, you know, brother Bam,
[46:32] dramatizing, if God God has spoke
[46:35] through his prophet, it will not fail
[46:39] &gt;&gt; because it's God's word. That's right.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; It will come to pass.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; You see, the the battles that we have
[46:48] always before us, the battles um do not
[46:51] change. Sometimes the front's the way it
[46:53] looks, but there's always been
[46:55] opposition. This is why that there's
[46:57] always been a battle. There's always
[46:59] been a conflict. When God gives a word
[47:02] and he's fulfilling his word in that
[47:04] season, it's always calling the people
[47:06] back to one thing, back to the true
[47:09] reality of the living God. that then
[47:13] through that revelation that the people
[47:15] then might be able to recognize who they
[47:18] are by seeing God and then recognize the
[47:22] privileges that God has for them, the
[47:25] rights and the relationship. And we we
[47:29] so within looking at this, it's very
[47:32] important as recognizing that God being
[47:36] there and being present with us because
[47:39] when when Matthew
[47:42] uh records this and the referring to
[47:44] this scripture and how that Joseph when
[47:47] these things were taking place even
[47:50] though they were well-versed in the word
[47:53] and in the scriptures but one of the
[47:56] things that I I love so so much is how
[47:59] the scripture says that even through all
[48:01] of these things, Joseph himself, he
[48:05] thought on these things. So, it's so
[48:09] important of taking in the word and
[48:11] meditating on the word of God. There's
[48:14] things that God will drop and deliver
[48:16] our way. And there's things that to be
[48:18] quite quite honest that even as while
[48:21] the word is coming forth at times that
[48:23] we're not always going to see the
[48:24] application we're not always going to
[48:27] understand it but it's to take the word
[48:29] in and just just just begin to take the
[48:32] word just to pray over that word and and
[48:35] just as we're we're dwelling upon that
[48:37] you know the prophet would always take
[48:38] the scripture draw nigh to God and God
[48:40] will draw nigh to you and he'll tie that
[48:43] scripture in James to that of us in our
[48:47] thinking and the thoughts that we
[48:49] entertain and we know that we are living
[48:51] in a time that in an hour that where our
[48:54] mind is constantly embombarded it's it's
[48:57] really um it's very can be very
[49:00] difficult to just shut everything out
[49:02] and I'm talking about uh the bombardment
[49:05] from all the things of media and
[49:07] everything else we have the devices and
[49:08] our all around we've got devices I mean
[49:11] you've got devices in your cars now that
[49:13] everything is is all around in in order
[49:16] to um keep people connected. And I think
[49:19] if that's if that's so prevalent where
[49:22] they would have things to where to keep
[49:24] people connected with Wi-Fi and our cars
[49:26] and everything and oh that's so
[49:28] important and everything, then I think
[49:29] it's a it's an age and a time and an
[49:31] hour where there's a bride who wants to
[49:34] be more than just a of a connected. She
[49:36] wants to be in tune. Lord, I I want to I
[49:39] want to be in tune at all times. I want
[49:41] to be I want to be right where you're
[49:43] at. I want to be moving. I want to be
[49:45] help me to catch what you're doing in
[49:47] this moment in this season. And so when
[49:50] when when when Matthew or is recording
[49:52] this and we see that how that God he
[49:56] visits Joseph by a dream and we know
[49:58] that that's because there wasn't a
[50:00] prophet on the scene at the time and God
[50:03] worked through a secondary way. It
[50:05] wasn't anything that would be of great
[50:07] symbolic uh stature because when God
[50:10] would give something of that nature, God
[50:12] will have a prophet on the scene to
[50:14] interpret that. And so there are are
[50:17] things that
[50:18] when we when we look at this in God with
[50:21] us and I want to just hone in on this
[50:23] phrase with the significance of God with
[50:26] us because when and I don't I don't want
[50:29] to lose you but I want re to to kind of
[50:32] reflect back there in Leviticus 8 when
[50:35] their priests are coming into
[50:37] consecration
[50:39] that whole process is done over and they
[50:42] continue to go through the same process.
[50:44] Yes, seven days for a complete
[50:46] consecration.
[50:48] And God has taken his bride through
[50:51] seven church ages.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; And so we're living in the hour where
[50:56] the bride, where the promises, where the
[50:58] marriage of the lamb has come. We are
[51:02] living in an hour that the word that has
[51:06] come has come to unite us to Christ to
[51:09] where that these two are no longer one.
[51:13] And so we recognize within that
[51:15] fulfillment of that word, that's what
[51:17] brings the unity. That's what brings the
[51:20] harmony. This is why if you think back
[51:23] to a few of the services that we've been
[51:25] in even as brother Josh right in the
[51:28] same vein was here last week it it must
[51:32] be the word for this season and that
[51:36] word being ministered of this season in
[51:39] order to bring the evening time results.
[51:43] So you we don't need to go back and make
[51:46] the gospel simpler because the gospel
[51:49] can be no more simpler than Christ
[51:52] himself being revealed.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And uh you know we see that it's the
[51:57] word it's not to understand it in this
[51:59] way. It's not your duty. It's not my
[52:02] duty to make someone see. But it is it
[52:06] is God in his mercy because it it's
[52:10] nothing that we did to make ourselves
[52:12] see.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard this brother preach. It
[52:15] wasn't that brother.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Uh you know, oh I I heard brother
[52:18] Brandham on tape say this. It wasn't
[52:20] brother Brandham.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus said flesh and blood has not
[52:25] revealed this unto you
[52:27] &gt;&gt; but my father which is in heaven. And
[52:30] that's what gives us the confidence
[52:32] because it's not and that's why as we
[52:34] see this message, this message is not
[52:36] the understanding of William Bran.
[52:39] That's right.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; This message is is is the son of man
[52:43] being revealed. It's simply God's
[52:45] thoughts.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; And that's where that the word being
[52:49] spoken in season, it's the inspiration,
[52:51] the Holy Spirit to bring the quickening
[52:54] to the seed for that hour. And it's God
[52:57] with us. Now it's it's it's very very
[53:02] very true that when we see this with
[53:04] God, God with us, the ultimate is God's
[53:08] desire is to dwell in us. And that God
[53:12] would have preeminence in our lives.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Because even after God comes in in us,
[53:19] he now wants preeminence in our lives.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; And that of preeminence is not is not a
[53:25] is not a gift. It's a victory.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And so we find that to where that he's
[53:30] becoming the chief in all things. He's
[53:33] becoming the head of all things. It's
[53:36] resting and relying in him. And we and
[53:38] that is built. I want you to understand
[53:41] this is all built where God by his
[53:44] presence revealing himself is what
[53:47] brings the confidence. It brings
[53:50] security. It brings rest. It It brings
[53:53] about a yielding within the heart and
[53:56] life of the believer because God is a
[53:59] gentleman. He won't force himself. But
[54:02] we must yield our lives to him. And
[54:06] that's what God wants us to do is simply
[54:08] to yield. And how do we yield? By faith.
[54:11] And how DOES FAITH COME? BY HEARING the
[54:13] word of God. And what is faith? It's a
[54:16] revelation of God's will. God shows you
[54:19] what is the truth and then you walk in
[54:22] it because he has spoke to you.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; So here the prophet picks this up in a
[54:28] very short message the presence of God
[54:31] unrecognized and he says if he is
[54:34] present then everything is settled.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's a big statement.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; If he's present then why everything is
[54:42] settled? He made the word. He's here to
[54:45] confirm it. He proves it. He's the same
[54:47] yesterday, today, and forever.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:50] &gt;&gt; We see him night after night,
[54:52] infallibly, day after day, year after
[54:54] year. Not one time has he predicted
[54:56] anything, regardless when it was that it
[54:58] would happen out of the thousands of
[55:00] times, perfectly right on the dot. And
[55:03] he said, "Those of you that know the
[55:04] ministry know it to be true. Regardless
[55:07] how even impossible, it's happened just
[55:10] the same. He is God. And if we would
[55:13] just recognize that and take a hold of
[55:17] it.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, if we could only
[55:21] do that tonight, people, if we could
[55:24] only realize that he is appearing to us
[55:28] in these meetings for one purpose, and
[55:31] that's to release our desires that we
[55:35] have in him to us. But we've got to
[55:38] recognize his presence. And now how you
[55:42] recognize his presence is when the
[55:44] promised word for this age is made
[55:47] manifest. Not the promised word of Moses
[55:50] age or any other age but the promised
[55:53] word for this age.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So God has God in the fulfillment of the
[56:00] promise of his word. It releases if when
[56:04] we can recognize his presence, then it
[56:07] releases the desires we have in HIM
[56:09] BECAUSE ONLY him revealing himself can
[56:13] actually re release the desires that he
[56:16] put within us.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE THOSE DESIRES THAT ARE WITHIN
[56:21] YOU? Where did they rise from? They're r
[56:23] they are RAISING FROM THAT SEED that he
[56:27] put within you. as the seed is desiring
[56:30] for that water is desiring for that
[56:33] light and the prophet ties the water and
[56:36] the revealing of the word TO THE
[56:38] INSPIRATION OF THE HOUR THAT IS POURED
[56:41] OUT upon the people of God.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And so it's to recognize him uh and and
[56:47] he's appearing he's making himself known
[56:51] to us. And I think that's this is not
[56:53] just words to be forgotten, but it's to
[56:57] understand God making himself known to
[57:01] YOU PERSONALLY. RIGHT? EVEN in the midst
[57:04] of a service, God revealing himself
[57:07] personally to you.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; He's didn't get a mistake. HE DIDN'T
[57:12] DELIVER SOMETHING TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.
[57:14] HE'S NOT SPEAKING TO THE WRONG PERSON.
[57:17] He's speaking to you.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And to me. And so I want to just look at
[57:22] this here a few moments on this portion
[57:26] of God with us and how that God is if
[57:31] faithful in the fulfillment of his
[57:34] promise to uh move in our lives and our
[57:38] hearts to build the faith that is needed
[57:42] in order to obtain the promise in that
[57:45] hour. Now notice when HERE WHEN GOD AS
[57:49] GOD became one of us, we we understand
[57:52] that that purpose of God becoming one of
[57:55] us was indeed in purposed in redemption.
[57:59] That's true. And God also, he came that
[58:02] he might uh be a uh a faithful and
[58:06] merciful high priest, one that would so
[58:09] uh faithfully understand all if all of
[58:13] the complexities of humanity. Brother
[58:15] Ram said he had frustrations.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; That to me is powerful because it didn't
[58:21] it's not saying that he was but he
[58:22] experienced those things. So he
[58:24] experienced that those parts of humanity
[58:26] you know even headache and so forth.
[58:28] Brother Bram goes into that and draws
[58:30] from it because in his body he was
[58:33] absolutely totally MAN BUT INSIDE
[58:36] totally God.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; And that's why THE PROPHET SAID HE MADE
[58:40] A CHOICE IN TOTAL DELIVERANCE. HE MADE A
[58:42] CHOICE. He could have been a man, BUT HE
[58:45] CHOSE TO deliver his natural being into
[58:49] the hands of the God who lived in him.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Who was he? He was God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; He was Emmanuel.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT TO JUST JUST JUST LOOK AT
[58:58] THIS HERE just for a moment. Let me just
[59:00] go through a few passages of scripture.
[59:03] And here he comes. Remember, the
[59:05] responsibility
[59:07] of God coming is is for redemption. That
[59:10] is true. to die upon the cross uh to TO
[59:14] PAY THE PRICE FOR sin debt. But I want
[59:17] you to see ALSO THAT THE WHOLE TIME of
[59:20] the journey even of the three and a half
[59:23] years and then after he raises there and
[59:26] walks with them in Luke 24 IT'S IT'S
[59:29] ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THEIR FAITH HAS TO BE
[59:32] BUILT IN THE LIVING GOD AND THEN INTO
[59:35] THE PROMISE that pertains to them.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND GOD HAS SEEN TO IT THAT IT'S
[59:41] NOT UH UP TO US TO TRY TO FIND OUR WAY,
[59:45] &gt;&gt; but he said, "I'm here to lead you."
[59:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO GUIDE YOU ALL the way. He's
[59:50] here to bring faith. HE'S HERE TO BUILD
[59:52] FAITH WITHIN THE WORD. BECAUSE A PERSON
[59:55] COULD NEVER CAN NEVER THEY could have
[59:57] never RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT UNLESS
[59:59] THEIR FAITH HAD BEEN BUILT FOR IT. I I
[1:00:01] DON'T CARE. I KNOW YOU COULD SAY, "WELL,
[1:00:03] THEY WAS OFFERED UP ON CALVARY." BUT
[1:00:05] UNLESS THEIR FAITH WAS BUILT FOR IT AND
[1:00:07] TO REALIZE WHAT HE HAD DID FOR THEM AND
[1:00:10] THAT IT WAS FOR THEM, THEY WOULDN'T
[1:00:11] RECEIVE IT.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET TELLS US BACK, HE
[1:00:14] SAYS, HE SAYS, IN ORDER IN ACTS 19, THEY
[1:00:18] HAD TO COME TO THE PRESENT REALITY THAT
[1:00:21] THE ATONEMENT HAD BEEN OFFERED UP BEFORE
[1:00:24] THEY COULD RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; SEE, THE WORD, IT'S NOT GOD JUST SAYING,
[1:00:29] WELL, YOU KNOW, WELL, I RECEIVED THE
[1:00:31] WORD IN A B OR I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST
[1:00:33] IN A BAPTIST CHURCH. NO, YOU DIDN'T.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; OH, I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN A
[1:00:37] PENTECOSTAL CHURCH. NO, YOU DIDN'T.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED A BAPTISM, BUT
[1:00:41] YOU NEVER RECEIVED A WORD BIRTH.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; THE NEW BIRTH COMES UNDER THE MINISTRY
[1:00:47] OF THIS HOUR. THIS IS THE HOUR OF THE
[1:00:50] SEALING ANGEL.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID HE WOULD SEND THE SPIRIT IN
[1:00:57] IN MY NAME. AND WHAT IS HIS NAME? IT'S
[1:01:00] HIS WORD BEING REVEALED.
[1:01:04] YES, SIR.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Just watch this in the scripture here
[1:01:07] for a few moments in John 7 VERSE 33.
[1:01:12] THEN SAID JESUS UNTO THEM, YET A LITTLE
[1:01:14] while
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; and I am with you and then I GO UNTO HIM
[1:01:19] THAT SENT ME.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; SO HERE HE IS, GOD WITH US. HE'S WALKING
[1:01:24] WITH THE DISCIPLES.
[1:01:26] And remember he says you you'll seek me
[1:01:29] but you won't find me. Where I am
[1:01:30] thither you cannot come. Now, he's not
[1:01:32] talking to the disciples. He's speaking
[1:01:34] to that of of the Pharisees of the Jews
[1:01:37] that were surrounding him even in that
[1:01:39] time. And here the as as they're asking
[1:01:42] the question, how how is this going to
[1:01:44] be? And what do you mean we can't find
[1:01:45] you? AND SEE WHAT JESUS IS POINTING THEM
[1:01:48] TO IS THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO CATCH THE
[1:01:52] WORD FOR YOUR DAY.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IN THE
[1:01:56] MESSAGE DESPERATION, HE SAID THE
[1:01:58] BIRTHRIGHT IS RIGHT AMONG US. AND IF
[1:02:01] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT'LL PASS RIGHT
[1:02:03] THROUGH US. BRANDOM tabernacle
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; and Esau. Now, I don't want TO GO THERE,
[1:02:12] BUT WHEN WE LOOK HERE IN THE SCRIPTURES,
[1:02:14] JESUS GOES ON TO SAY, "IN THE LAST DAY,
[1:02:16] THAT GREAT day of the feast, JESUS STOOD
[1:02:19] AND CRIED AND SAID, IF ANY MAN THIRST,
[1:02:21] let him come unto me and drink, and he
[1:02:24] that believeth on me, AS THE SCRIPTURE
[1:02:26] SAID, OUT of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:02:28] of living water." And this he spake of
[1:02:30] the spirit which they that believe on
[1:02:32] him should receive. For the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[1:02:36] not yet glorified. IN JOHN CHAPTER 12,
[1:02:40] JESUS SAID UNTO THEM, "YET A LITTLE
[1:02:42] WHILE IS THE LIGHT with you.
[1:02:46] Walk while you have the light, lest
[1:02:49] darkness come upon you. For he that
[1:02:51] walketh in darkness knoweth not whether
[1:02:54] he goeth. While you have light, believe
[1:02:57] in the light that you may be the
[1:02:59] children of the light. And these things
[1:03:01] Jesus spake and departed from them. SO
[1:03:03] HE'S DRAWING JESUS HERE DRAWING this
[1:03:06] attention
[1:03:08] that here what is PRESENT IS LIGHT FOR
[1:03:11] them to walk in. You say what light? To
[1:03:14] lead them from where THEY ARE TO WHERE
[1:03:17] THEY need to be. RIGHT?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; AS THE PLYAS PETER WOULD WRITE UNTIL THE
[1:03:21] DAY STAR RISE IN YOUR HEART AND THE
[1:03:23] PROPHET SAYS IT'S THE DAY STAR THAT IS
[1:03:26] LEADING US TO THAT PLACE TO THE REAL
[1:03:29] GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE TO BE BORN IN OUR
[1:03:32] LIVES. SO GOD SENDS HIS WORD AND HE IT'S
[1:03:36] GOD ACCOMPANYING HIS WORD GOD WITH US TO
[1:03:40] LEAD US INTO THE PLACE THAT HE IS
[1:03:42] CALLING US TO. GOD DOES NOT TAKE HIS
[1:03:45] HANDS OFF. GOD DOES NOT JUST SAY, "WELL,
[1:03:47] HERE'S THE WORD. YOU FIGURE IT OUT." GOD
[1:03:50] IS WITH US.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; HE'S INTERESTED IN HIS WORD COMING TO
[1:03:55] PASS.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO FORCE A GROUP OF
[1:03:58] PEOPLE. WE'RE BELIEVERS. HE STAYS RIGHT
[1:04:00] THERE UNTIL FAITH RISES TO TRUST HIM AND
[1:04:05] TO BELIEVE HIM.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE WALKING in that light.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SCRIPTURE.
[1:04:14] You could see it even throughout the
[1:04:16] ecumenical world. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED
[1:04:19] when they rejected uh the Lord Jesus and
[1:04:23] then WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAD COME, THE
[1:04:28] JEWS TURNED THAT DOWN AND THE PROPHETS
[1:04:30] SAID THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE IT WAS
[1:04:32] THAT'S where it was sealed away right
[1:04:33] there in Acts. THEY THEY THEY REJECTED
[1:04:37] THAT OF the Messiah. They rejected THE
[1:04:40] HOLY SPIRIT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE
[1:04:42] BLIND. BUT THERE WAS ALSO THE PARALLEL
[1:04:45] THAT WALKING IN THE LIGHT TO RECOGNIZE
[1:04:47] THE LIGHT OF THIS HOUR. HERE HE WAS
[1:04:50] WALKING IN THEIR MIDST. AND HERE YOU
[1:04:53] FIND MEN THAT COULD NOT EVEN READ THEIR
[1:04:56] NAME AS the prophet SAID ABOUT PETER. IF
[1:04:58] THEY WROTE HIS NAME ON A BOX CAR, HE
[1:05:00] WOULDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE IT.
[1:05:03] NOW, THOSE ARE NOT JUST LITTLE
[1:05:05] VERNACULARS THAT THE PROPHET WOULD P PUT
[1:05:07] IN THERE TO JUST TRY TO FILL SPACE, BUT
[1:05:10] HE'S LETTING US KNOW THAT IT'S NOT BY
[1:05:12] POWER. IT'S NOT BY MIGHT. IT'S THE HOLY
[1:05:15] SPIRIT. IT'S GOD REVEALING HIMSELF TO
[1:05:18] YOU AND I OF WHAT THE WORLD MIGHT
[1:05:20] CONSIDER TO BE OUTCAST AND NOT WORTHY.
[1:05:23] AND TRULY, WE'RE NOT WORTHY. NO MAN
[1:05:25] COULD BE WORTHY. NO, NOT ONE. AMEN.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; THERE WASN'T A PHARISEE WORTHY.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; NOBODY was worthy.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But God placed it in that way.
[1:05:39] And it's God working in our lives
[1:05:41] because it's super it's a supernatural.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's supernatural, friends.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; While you have the light, walk in it.
[1:05:51] Jesus would go on to say in John 13 when
[1:05:54] he was gone out Jesus said now is the
[1:05:56] son of man glorified and God is
[1:05:59] glorified in him and if God be glorified
[1:06:01] in him God shall also glorify him in
[1:06:05] himself and shall straightway glorify
[1:06:07] him little children yet a little while
[1:06:10] and I am with you
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; you'll seek me and as I said to the Jews
[1:06:16] whether I go you CANNOT COME SO NOW I
[1:06:19] say unto you And Peter says,"Lord,
[1:06:22] whether goest thou?" And Jesus said,
[1:06:24] "Whether I go, thou canst not follow me
[1:06:27] now."
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; But thou shalt follow me afterwards.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Knowing full well Peter what he would
[1:06:36] do, deny him three times.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; SEE ALL OF THIS, GOD ALREADY KNEW.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW. LISTEN NOW. HERE IS THE GOD OF
[1:06:47] GLORY, GOD WITH US, EMMANUEL.
[1:06:50] AND HERE WAS JUDAS RIGHT with him.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; And it never had the effect on Judas.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; That it had on Peter.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; It never had an effect. It never had he
[1:07:05] was always, you know, like like like
[1:07:07] like as Judas always trying to always
[1:07:10] trying to fit it in. You know, the
[1:07:11] prophet also places it very clearly in
[1:07:14] three kinds of believers. He said Judas
[1:07:16] was that one was never really just quite
[1:07:20] just sold around, you know, he was
[1:07:21] always looking for a a loophole in it.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; See, this is what may this is the
[1:07:27] something that I listen to and I look
[1:07:29] very carefully for because God has not
[1:07:32] entrusted the ministry in this hour to
[1:07:35] go around and decipher brother Brandham
[1:07:38] meant this here. Brother Bram didn't
[1:07:39] mean this over here. Brother Brandham
[1:07:41] meant this. That's a that that's not the
[1:07:43] spirit of God. That's that's that's not
[1:07:46] God. I I you know because this is where
[1:07:48] I simply would stop at is where's your
[1:07:49] vindication?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Was there a pillar of fire over your
[1:07:53] head?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; You see, BEGIN TO THINK HE BEGINS. WE'RE
[1:07:56] GOING YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME THINGS
[1:07:58] THAT WE CAME OUT OF.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; GOD BROUGHT A PEOPLE OUT FROM UNDER THE
[1:08:03] REASONING OF MAN.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; WELL, FRIENDS, LISTEN. WHAT A BLESSING
[1:08:09] IT IS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR GOD'S VOICE AND
[1:08:11] TURN TUNE OUT ALL OTHER VOICES.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just GOING TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. IF
[1:08:17] I'M NOT SPEAKING TO THE MESSAGE THROUGH
[1:08:19] THE MESSAGE AND IN THE MESSAGE, THEN I'M
[1:08:21] WRONG.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE, GOD HAS ALREADY VINDICATED
[1:08:27] IT. AND I'M NOT HERE, I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:08:29] TAKE TIME, OH THAT I HAVE TO PROVE THAT.
[1:08:32] THAT'S I'M NOT GOING INTO THAT TRAP. GOD
[1:08:34] HAS ALREADY VINDICATED IT. AND HE'S
[1:08:36] VINDICATING IT IN LIVES AND HEARTS EVEN
[1:08:38] THROUGHOUT THIS CONGREGATION. NOT JUST
[1:08:41] IN THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:08:43] WHICH IS TRUE, BUT HE'S ALSO VINDICATING
[1:08:46] IT IN LIVES AFTER THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS
[1:08:49] come being changed and changed and
[1:08:51] changed.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; So, I say this respectfully, but I don't
[1:08:57] have time for that.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I'm settled.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; No questions.
[1:09:05] SO GOD WITH US. Walk while you have the
[1:09:09] light here in this moment. Think of even
[1:09:13] the beginning. Now just make a make a
[1:09:16] track with me back to Genesis 1. Here is
[1:09:19] the earth void without form in darkness.
[1:09:25] And God speaks and says, "Let there be
[1:09:29] light."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says there was light.
[1:09:33] And the spirit of God after God spoke,
[1:09:36] the spirit of God began to move upon the
[1:09:40] waters. The Holy Spirit began TO MOVE.
[1:09:43] SEE, THE WORD being spoken, GOD GOD WAS
[1:09:47] CALLING for what was needed IN THAT
[1:09:50] HOUR. LET THERE BE LIGHT. AND THE
[1:09:52] PROPHET SAID HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE
[1:09:54] DARKNESS THAT WAS COVERING THAT OVER.
[1:09:56] LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS. MANY TIMES
[1:09:59] THROUGHOUT even the message where
[1:10:00] brother Brandon will say he said you you
[1:10:02] see a person and you you see how this is
[1:10:05] he said but you KNOW HE TALKED ABOUT A
[1:10:07] YOUNG MAN he said I see this young man
[1:10:09] he said he was all chained up and so
[1:10:10] FORTH HE SAID I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO
[1:10:12] WATCH AND SEE WHEN THE HOW THIS YOUNG
[1:10:14] MAN IS WHEN HE GETS OUT FROM UNDERNEATH
[1:10:16] THOSE CHAINS AND SO BROTHER RAM'S JUST
[1:10:18] WATCHING this in a vision and he SEES
[1:10:21] WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN GETS OUT FROM THOSE
[1:10:23] CHAINS HE'S LIKE MY HE'S NOT EVEN
[1:10:25] ANYTHING LIKE HE WAS ACTING HIS HIS
[1:10:27] BEHAVIOR AND WHATEVER MORE. SO WHAT WAS
[1:10:29] IT? THE BEHAVIOR WAS NOT THE YOUNG MAN.
[1:10:33] IT WAS THE CHANGE OR THE SPIRITS OR THE
[1:10:36] DARKNESS HE WAS UNDER.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE WORD COMES TO DIVIDE
[1:10:42] TO DRIVE BACK. THAT'S WHY LISTEN
[1:10:43] FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY I I UNDERSTAND THAT
[1:10:46] THE WORD THERE IS A MOLDING AND THERE IS
[1:10:48] A SHAPING THAT'S VERY TRUE IN OUR LIFE
[1:10:50] AND A CONTINUAL MOLDING. BUT SOMETIMES
[1:10:53] THERE'S SITUATIONS AND THERE'S THINGS
[1:10:55] THAT IT'S NOT PERSONALITY. IT'S
[1:10:58] DARKNESS.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It's darkness
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; that must be cast away.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Because the people are good people, but
[1:11:09] it's the darkness, the influence.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? That's
[1:11:16] why brother Brandon will pick it up in
[1:11:17] the message shalom and he's talking
[1:11:19] about he said you TAKE PEOPLE THEY WANT
[1:11:21] TO DO RIGHT THEY HEAR ABOUT NOT CUTTING
[1:11:24] THEIR HAIR AND ALL OF THESE THINGS HE
[1:11:26] SAID THEY WANT TO DO RIGHT HE SAID BUT
[1:11:28] IT'S DARKNESS GROSS DARKNESS UPON THE
[1:11:31] PEOPLE THAT'S DRIVING THEM I SAY GOD
[1:11:34] HELP US TO HAVE THAT REVELATION THAT
[1:11:36] WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH FLESH AND BLOOD
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T APPROACH IT WITH REASONING
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THE ONLY
[1:11:45] THING HE SAID THAT'LL CAST OUT A SPIRIT
[1:11:49] IS DIVINE LOVE.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU DON'T CAST OUT SPIRITS BY
[1:11:53] CRUEL AND INDIFFERENT LIVING. AND JUST A
[1:11:56] QUICK SYNOPSIS ON THAT, YOU DON'T
[1:11:58] APPROACH THE SPIRIT THE SAME WAY THAT
[1:12:00] IT'S COMING. YOU APPROACH IT WITH
[1:12:02] STEADFASTNESS AND CONFIDENCE IN THE WORD
[1:12:05] OF KNOWING WHO YOU ARE. AND LORD, THAT'S
[1:12:07] YOUR SON. THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER. I'M
[1:12:09] GOING AFTER THEM.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; GY.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:12:16] So that first light that struck the
[1:12:20] earth was not sunlight. It was shikina
[1:12:23] light.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; It was God's light by his word that
[1:12:28] began to set everything in motion. It
[1:12:30] began to move as the prophet said in
[1:12:32] rising of the sun with love and
[1:12:35] compassion on that first day to drive
[1:12:38] back and turn darkness INTO NIGHT. WHAT
[1:12:40] WAS IT? IT WAS GOD WITH US. GOD WITH HIS
[1:12:44] ATTRIBUTE CALLED THE EARTH. GOD WITH US
[1:12:46] SEEDS THAT WERE LAYING down beneath that
[1:12:49] earth.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to just say once again, I
[1:12:53] know I've we have really
[1:12:57] moved through this in previous services
[1:12:59] and once again, brother Josh, just
[1:13:00] stepping right in that same vein.
[1:13:03] God creates the conditions by his word.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN GOD WHEN GOD when when the
[1:13:10] need was for a body change FOR ABRAHAM
[1:13:13] AND SARAH, GOD CREATED THE CONDITIONS by
[1:13:17] his word.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; You see WHAT IS NEEDED? GOD CREATES BY
[1:13:21] HIS WORD THE FAITH THAT'S needed for
[1:13:24] this hour. That's so good.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So when you find here Moses,
[1:13:31] Moses comes to the burning bush and God
[1:13:36] remember God attracts here his
[1:13:39] attention. He's attracted
[1:13:41] and God begins to make known, I've come
[1:13:44] down. I've heard their cries,
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And I've come down to deliver them.
[1:13:51] And here God makes known to Moses.
[1:13:55] Certainly,
[1:13:57] I'm going to be with you. BECAUSE MOSES,
[1:13:59] HE WOULD HAVE THE SAME uh response that
[1:14:03] each one of us EVEN IN OUR APPROACH TO
[1:14:08] THE WORD OF EVEN GOD DEALING WITH OUR
[1:14:10] LIFE WHEN HE'S BRINGING A HEART AND A
[1:14:13] LIFE ALL THE WAY THROUGH OF
[1:14:15] JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, baptism
[1:14:17] of THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEN EVEN WHERE
[1:14:19] THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION WORKING IN OUR
[1:14:21] LIFE TO BRING US TO THE FULLNESS OF
[1:14:23] ADOPTION, IT'S THE SAME THING THAT WE
[1:14:26] LOOK AT AND SAY, "GOD, ME,
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN I?" BECAUSE WHERE WHERE WE LOOK
[1:14:32] AT MANY TIMES, AND THIS IS WHERE GOD IS
[1:14:35] WORKING BY HIS WORD TO GET US TO A
[1:14:37] PLACE, IT'S NOT THAT HE HE DOESN'T WANT
[1:14:40] US TO BE AWARE OF OUR WEAKNESSES. HE
[1:14:42] DOES. BUT WHEN HIS PRESENCE IS BEING
[1:14:45] REVEALED, IT IS NOT TO TO CONDEMN US OR
[1:14:49] TO LOOK DOWN ON US, BUT IT IS TO EXPOSE
[1:14:53] OUR WEAKNESSES AND OUR NEED OF HIM. AND
[1:14:55] IF THERE'S ANY PLACE GREATER PLACE OF
[1:14:58] SAFETY, there is none other place
[1:15:01] outside OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD REVEALING
[1:15:04] HIS WORD WHERE WE CAN JUST COMPLETELY
[1:15:07] OPEN OUR HEARTS AND SAY, "LORD, ME."
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ME.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And yet, YET THIS IS WHAT GOD IS WORKING
[1:15:15] WITH MOSES IS TO surrender those
[1:15:18] weaknesses.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And certainly I will be with thee. I've
[1:15:25] sent thee and I'm going to bring you
[1:15:27] back to this mountain and you're going
[1:15:29] to worship me on now. He didn't tell
[1:15:31] Moses. He didn't tell him everything
[1:15:33] that was going to transpire between
[1:15:35] there and getting back to that mountain.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; If he had, it probably would have been
[1:15:39] overwhelming. YEAH,
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD FIRST TOOK A HOLD OF YOUR LIFE,
[1:15:43] IF HE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING FROM HERE TO
[1:15:45] THERE, IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:15:46] OVERWHELMING.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS THE PROMISE. CERTAINLY, I
[1:15:50] WILL BE WITH YOU.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; God made real, I'll keep EVERY PROMISE.
[1:15:59] THAT'S WHAT GOD WAS MAKING known there
[1:16:01] in the burning bush. HE WAS CALLING in
[1:16:05] to Moses attention the promise that he
[1:16:08] had already made through Abraham.
[1:16:10] There's three words and the prophet
[1:16:12] would preach this message uh a couple
[1:16:15] times here and these three words are
[1:16:18] very very significant. Hearing
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; recognizing and acting on it.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] It's very it's very key
[1:16:31] because
[1:16:35] often times when we can come out of
[1:16:39] service
[1:16:41] or we get or we get away
[1:16:44] uh the enemy knows how to all of a
[1:16:47] sudden start to draw upon our minds, our
[1:16:50] hearts and other things to try to ful
[1:16:53] try to put the pressure that we forget
[1:16:56] the things that God has spoke to us
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; that God is desiring to call forth from
[1:17:04] our lives,
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, you might have been
[1:17:08] able to put the insurance bill to the
[1:17:11] side. You might have been able to put um
[1:17:13] uh the things with with job to the side.
[1:17:16] And all of a sudden, all it takes is
[1:17:17] just something just of a little trigger.
[1:17:19] And we begin to get focused upon those
[1:17:22] things. And it isn't that we shouldn't
[1:17:24] be mindful, but everything has to stay
[1:17:27] in its right priority.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "SEEK YE FIRST THE
[1:17:32] KINGDOM OF GOD." SO, I JUST SAY IT LIKE
[1:17:34] THIS. IF A PERSON SAYS, "WELL, I'M GOING
[1:17:36] TO GET all this in order and then I'll
[1:17:37] serve God." Satan will keep you running
[1:17:39] on a rat race from now to the rapture.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You you this is Listen, let me tell you
[1:17:44] something. The complexities of life,
[1:17:46] life is complex.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:17:49] Uh, and we NEED TO JUST APPROACH IT IN
[1:17:52] THIS WAY AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO BE
[1:17:54] WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE ME TO BE AS A as a
[1:17:56] as A SON OF GOD, as a daughter OF GOD,
[1:17:58] AS A HUSBAND, AS A WIFE, AS A FATHER OR
[1:18:01] MOTHER, WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE. I WANT
[1:18:03] TO BE WHAT YOU'VE CALLED ME TO BE,
[1:18:04] LORD."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO US TO TRY TO FIGURE IT
[1:18:08] OUT, BUT TO FOLLOW HIM.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Good preacher.
[1:18:15] So here when God speaks to our hearts
[1:18:19] uh you know he begins to hear that voice
[1:18:22] coming from from there I've heard the
[1:18:24] cries of my people and I remembered my
[1:18:26] covenant and I've come down TO DELIVER
[1:18:27] THEM. THE FIRST THING he heard God's
[1:18:30] word and he recognized it was God
[1:18:33] because it was the word and HE BE TO
[1:18:36] EXAMINE IT BY THE WORD. AND IF GOD MAKES
[1:18:39] A PROMISE IN THE WORD THEN GOD WILL BACK
[1:18:42] UP THAT PROMISE. AND HE SAID HERE
[1:18:45] HUNDREDS OF YEARS LATER HE HEARD THAT
[1:18:47] VOICE AND THAT VOICE WAS SPEAKING TO HIM
[1:18:50] WAS PURELY SCRIPTURAL. SO HE WAS IN
[1:18:53] ACTION.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I wanted TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. IT'S MORE
[1:18:59] THAN JUST DOCTRINE.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; God is moving on a PEOPLE AND CALLING A
[1:19:07] PEOPLE THAT HE SEES CHARACTER. AND THAT
[1:19:11] CHARACTER THAT GOD SEES IS HE'S SEEING
[1:19:13] THE POTENTIAL THAT LAYS WITHIN OUR LIFE.
[1:19:16] JUST LIKE HE SAW IT IN REBECCA'S LIFE.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRAM SAID HE ELEAZAR WAS
[1:19:21] SEARCHING FOR A BRIDE THAT WOULD STAND
[1:19:24] STILL AND LISTEN AND LET ELEAZAR TAKE
[1:19:28] THE CLOTHING OF THE WORD AND DRESS HER
[1:19:31] FOR RAPTURE.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S SO GOOD.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT KIND OF A CHARACTER? A
[1:19:35] WILLINGNESS.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; SO GOOD.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I'M TALKING ABOUT BRIDE
[1:19:40] MATERIAL FRIENDS.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST KNOWING THE DOCTRINES THAT WHEN
[1:19:46] WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT HERE
[1:19:48] TO UH TO JUST TO SAY WELL YOU DON'T NEED
[1:19:50] TO KNOW THE DOCTRINES. BUT YOU KNOW THE
[1:19:52] THINGS OF IT IS IS YOU CAN KNOW THE
[1:19:54] LETTER AND MISS HIM.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE LIFE IS CHARACTER. AND WHEN
[1:20:00] THE WORD BEGINS TO DEAL WITH OUR LIFE IN
[1:20:02] OUR CHARACTER AND IN OUR WALK AND IN OUR
[1:20:05] LIFE, OUR BEHAVIOR, OUR CONDUCT, AND IF
[1:20:08] WE PULL BACK, WE GOT TO EXAMINE, IS THAT
[1:20:11] GOD SPEAKING TO US?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF THIS WORD DOES NOT PRODUCE A
[1:20:17] CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER, THEN IT'S FAILED.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; But I say this word can't fail.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; It will produce a Christlike character.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; This is brother Ram says, God gives a
[1:20:39] promise and when his spirit comes, it
[1:20:42] fulfills that promise. The first thing
[1:20:44] you hear it preached, then you recognize
[1:20:47] that that's God's truth. Then you go
[1:20:50] into action. The carnal mind thinks
[1:20:52] you're just off the deep end. Let me
[1:20:54] just say this. Come back to this once
[1:20:56] again. Then you recognize here.
[1:20:58] recognize it being you hear it preached,
[1:21:00] you recognize it, then you go into
[1:21:01] action right here between these places
[1:21:04] right here. And I said this here just
[1:21:07] moments ago, but I'm going to say it as
[1:21:09] it's really coming fresh right there.
[1:21:13] Let me just tell you something. Brother
[1:21:14] Brandham recognized in Misha Walka. He
[1:21:16] heard the word.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; He seen it was truth.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; But right in between here, he made a
[1:21:23] fatal mistake.
[1:21:25] He went and and brought it to his
[1:21:28] mother-in-law
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; and it cost him.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Abraham. Now watch how the prophet will
[1:21:37] take this. And and when I say that,
[1:21:38] brother Brandham let brother Brandham
[1:21:40] left that out for you and I life story.
[1:21:42] Let let my mistakes in those things let
[1:21:44] them be stepping STONES FOR YOU. GOD
[1:21:46] ALLOWED THAT TO BE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:21:48] THE PROPHET WAS NOT ONE THING YOU FIND
[1:21:49] ABOUT brother Brandham? He wasn't a
[1:21:50] proud man.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; That ain't lifting brother Brandham up
[1:21:53] cuz I'm NOT. CUZ LET ME TELL YOU, IF you
[1:21:55] read how it was before the Holy Ghost
[1:21:58] come, remember brother Brandham was
[1:22:00] always like a a a hothead.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. You know, you read read through
[1:22:05] read through life story. Read through
[1:22:07] the supernatural PART. EVEN WHEN THEY
[1:22:09] HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IN A SUIT LIKE THAT,
[1:22:10] YOU LOOK LIKE A PREACHER. HE WAS READY.
[1:22:13] HE SAID, "YOU take that back."
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO
[1:22:17] EXPLODE. THAT'S WHO HE WAS. BUT WHAT
[1:22:19] WHAT WHAT CHANGED THAT? THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; And then that's where the prophet said
[1:22:28] to you AND I SWEETEN YOUR TEMPER WITH
[1:22:31] PRAYER.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; SO THIS PART HERE, THIS IS WHY THE
[1:22:38] PROPHET SAID REGARDING ABRAHAM, HE SAID
[1:22:40] ABRAHAM WHEN GOD REVEALED TO HIM ABOUT
[1:22:43] OFFERING up Isaac, he didn't even say a
[1:22:45] word to Sarah.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because Sarah had been
[1:22:49] trying to talk him out of it.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:22:53] THINK ABOUT IT. HERE HE WAS. HE COULD
[1:22:55] NOT SAY ANYTHING. AND THIS IS WHY THE
[1:22:57] PROPHET SAID EVEN AS THAT THAT WAS GOING
[1:22:59] OFF AND HE SAYS THAT LITTLE BUZZER THERE
[1:23:02] WAS GOING OFF IN ABRAHAM AND HE SAID
[1:23:03] EVEN WHEN ABRAHAM there walking up the
[1:23:05] MOUNTAIN AND HE GETS UP THE MOUNTAIN HE
[1:23:07] SAID HERE THE SATAN COMES AND SAYS
[1:23:09] WHAT'S Sarah going to say about this?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM'S ALREADY SAID WE'RE GOING UP
[1:23:15] HERE TO WORSHIP. WE'RE COMING BACK OFF.
[1:23:17] I DON'T KNOW HOW THE IN BETWEEN IS GOING
[1:23:19] TO HAPPEN, BUT I'M GOING INTO ACTION
[1:23:22] BECAUSE I'VE HEARD GOD'S VOICE. I
[1:23:24] RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOD THAT'S SPEAKING
[1:23:27] TO ME.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And I understand, friend, sometimes this
[1:23:36] right here within this, and I think we
[1:23:38] don't have to spend, you know, a month
[1:23:40] of Sundays on that that sometimes people
[1:23:42] say, "Well, God has spoke to me and this
[1:23:44] and that." And then you begin to look
[1:23:46] and you think, well, it's completely out
[1:23:49] of the word.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So, who spoke to you?
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; THIS IT HAS TO FOLLOW CHARACTERISTICS,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; NOW, watch this here. Here. He's going
[1:24:07] down into Egypt. And I want you to watch
[1:24:10] how the prophet says this here. He's
[1:24:12] going down. He's heard the voice. He's
[1:24:14] recognized it and he's obeyed and he
[1:24:16] says hear uh this voice and he's obeying
[1:24:20] it and and you say, brother Bram says
[1:24:22] and you say I can't do it. Yes, YOU CAN.
[1:24:27] IF GOD SPEAKS TO YOU, RECOGNIZE IT TO be
[1:24:30] his promise AND GO INTO ACTION AND SEE
[1:24:33] WHAT GOD DOES will take over. The
[1:24:37] says, "I CAN'T WALK." YES, YOU
[1:24:39] CAN. JESUS SAID SO. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:24:42] WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU
[1:24:44] PRAY, believe you receive them. You
[1:24:46] shall HAVE THEM. MAYBE THE MAN'S GOT
[1:24:48] CANCER. HE SAYS, "I CAN'T LIVE." YES,
[1:24:49] YOU CAN. GOD SAID SO.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; SEE, the the THE THE ANSWER TO IT, GOD
[1:24:56] SAID SO.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SAID SO, IT'S A YES, YOU CAN.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; When they came to the Red Sea,
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; HERE THEY COME TO THE RED SEA AND
[1:25:07] THEY'RE STANDING THERE. AND I WANT YOU
[1:25:09] TO remember these ARE VERY FAMILIAR
[1:25:11] PARTS WITH THEM. HERE IS GOD WITH US.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; HERE IS GOD. HE'S BROUGHT THEM OUT OF
[1:25:17] EGYPT. BUT REMEMBER THE PROMISE IS TO
[1:25:20] TAKE THEM IN TO the land.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; AND THEY COME HERE AND MOSES under
[1:25:27] inspiration. The people I want you to
[1:25:30] catch this friends. The people were, "Oh
[1:25:33] my, WE'RE GOING TO DIE. OH MY GOODNESS.
[1:25:37] WE'RE GOING TO BE OVERTHROWN. AND HERE
[1:25:38] WE ARE. YOU BROUGHT US OUT HERE. THEY'RE
[1:25:40] THEY'RE SEEING IT AND IT'S FEARFUL. IT'S
[1:25:43] TREMBLING.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES STANDS THERE
[1:25:49] WITH THE PROMISE OF GOD IN HIS HEART.
[1:25:52] AND HE SAYS, "THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR
[1:25:54] YOU AND YOU SHALL hold your peace." AND
[1:25:56] HE CRIES AND GOD SPEAKS TO MOSES, "SPEAK
[1:25:59] UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT THEY GO
[1:26:02] FORWARD."
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE TO GO BUT
[1:26:06] FORWARD.
[1:26:08] WE CAN'T GO BACKWARD. WE GOT TO GO
[1:26:10] FORWARD. WE CAN'T GO BACKWARD IN OUR
[1:26:12] THOUGHTS. WE CAN'T GO BACKWARD IN OUR
[1:26:14] ATTITUDE. WHATEVER THAT GOD HAS DONE FOR
[1:26:16] YOU, KEEP GOING FROM THERE.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; MAKE ANOTHER STEP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
[1:26:22] BACK AND REVISIT THAT. KEEP GOING.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER SAMUEL, THERE'S
[1:26:26] OPPOSITION. THAT IS ONLY TO TRY TO
[1:26:30] HINDER YOU AND GET YOUR ATTENTION OFF OF
[1:26:32] THE REALITY. GOD IS WITH US.
[1:26:40] So good.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; God didn't give him a map down in Egypt
[1:26:43] and say, "Here, here's some tapes and
[1:26:45] books. Figure it out."
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't do that.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; But God accompanied his people
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; all the way through all of their ups and
[1:26:57] downs.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this on the Red Sea. I love
[1:27:04] how the prophet places this in the
[1:27:07] supersigned message. He said, "At the
[1:27:10] Red Sea, he showed that he would make a
[1:27:13] way for those who were trying to do
[1:27:15] right and follow his commandment. No
[1:27:18] matter what cuts it off, God proved at
[1:27:20] the Red Sea and gave a sign that he
[1:27:23] could open up the sea.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; In every temptation,
[1:27:27] he'll make a way of escape.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "Mother don't believe it. Daddy
[1:27:31] don't believe it. The church don't
[1:27:32] believe it." I don't care who don't
[1:27:33] believe it. If you believe it, God will
[1:27:36] make a way of escape.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE A SIGN THAT HE WOULD.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, THIS IS YOUR SIGN.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS MADE A WAY of escape.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; YET, IT'S VERY HUMBLE. IT'S VERY HUMBLE.
[1:27:52] YOU YOU KNOW, EVERY EVERY SIGN THAT GOD
[1:27:55] DISPLAYS AND HE MAKES AND HE GIVES
[1:27:57] FORTH, IT REQUIRES HUMILITY TO RECOGNIZE
[1:28:01] THAT SIGN. AND SURRENDER TO WHAT GOD IS
[1:28:04] SAYING BEHIND THAT SIGN.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; He's speaking through that.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Watch the Bible says they were on their
[1:28:16] way straight to the promised land where
[1:28:18] God promised them and the Red Sea shut
[1:28:20] them off and they got in trouble. They
[1:28:21] didn't know what TO DO. GOD SHOWED THAT
[1:28:23] HE WOULD make a way of escape in every
[1:28:26] temptation and every trial. Right?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; I don't have to ask for hands. We've
[1:28:33] been there.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And if we haven't, if we're not,
[1:28:36] remember, if we're not in a trial, we've
[1:28:38] just come out of one or we're heading
[1:28:39] into one.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; But God PROMISED HE'LL MAKE A way of
[1:28:43] escape.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And and it's not about our flesh
[1:28:49] escaping. It's about his word coming to
[1:28:53] pass. Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; You can't quit smoking, take God one
[1:28:59] time.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You can't quit lying, can't quit
[1:29:02] stealing,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; can't quit having temper, take God with
[1:29:05] you one time.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel like going to church
[1:29:08] and you can't GET ANYWHERE, TAKE GOD
[1:29:10] WITH YOU ONCE. TAKE HIS PROMISE. HE
[1:29:12] PROVED IT AT THE RED SEA THAT HE'LL MAKE
[1:29:14] A WAY OF ESCAPE. GOD HAS GIVEN MANY A
[1:29:17] SIGN. SO WHAT WAS THE SIGN WAS TO BUILD
[1:29:20] FAITH IN THE LIVING GOD.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; THEN AT THE RED SEA, THIS IS WHERE
[1:29:25] ISRAEL WHERE DAVID WROTE IN PSALM 78,
[1:29:28] THEY MISUNDERSTOOD.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; THEY JUST KEPT ON LIKE A HOG UNDERNEATH
[1:29:33] TREES, APPLES DROPPING AND YOU KNOW JUST
[1:29:35] EATING UP THE APPLES AND AND JUST
[1:29:37] WALKING THROUGH THE RED SEA. THEY FAILED
[1:29:39] TO RECOGNIZE, WAIT A MINUTE HERE,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID GOD SAY THROUGH MOSES? THE LORD
[1:29:45] SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU. HOLD YOUR PEACE
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN THEY COME THROUGH THE LAND
[1:29:50] WHEN THE NEXT OPPOSITION OR THEY COME
[1:29:52] THROUGH THE RED SEA AND THE NEXT
[1:29:54] OPPOSITION THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU
[1:29:56] THAT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING OF WELL THE
[1:29:59] PAST IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE A SIGN THAT
[1:30:02] GOD WAS LETTING ISRAEL KNOW I'LL BE WITH
[1:30:05] YOU THROUGH EVERY TRIAL through every
[1:30:07] temptation
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; so the previous listen now the previous
[1:30:13] experiences in your life that God has
[1:30:16] brought you through.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Is what has increased your patience now
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; to where you can stand, listen, you can
[1:30:26] stand in trials now that you never would
[1:30:28] have been able or fit to stand in prior
[1:30:31] to.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying when I say fit, I'm
[1:30:38] not talking about you losing the Holy
[1:30:39] Spirit. I'm just talking about things
[1:30:41] that would just so overwhelm you. But
[1:30:43] even in the midst of it, there's things
[1:30:45] that we do feel overwhelmed, but there's
[1:30:46] an anchor that holds us and and there's
[1:30:48] a there there's a maturing. See what
[1:30:50] it's God with us that's bringing us
[1:30:53] along.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that, friends.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Very, very thankful for that. When you
[1:31:01] when we consider that of how every every
[1:31:03] believer passing through the Red Sea,
[1:31:05] let me just skip a few things and get to
[1:31:07] this get to a couple points here.
[1:31:11] Satan
[1:31:14] also wanted to break
[1:31:17] that of with us.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; When Israel
[1:31:23] even after knowing what was right,
[1:31:26] ten commandments
[1:31:29] so forth, then and God had already spoke
[1:31:32] chapters before and here Israel
[1:31:36] makes a golden calf.
[1:31:41] And it was Moses,
[1:31:45] Christ and Moses, and I want you to
[1:31:46] catch this, that stood in the breach and
[1:31:51] in the gap for the people.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It's quite amazing how that when Moses
[1:31:59] goes down there,
[1:32:01] the part of a man, it flares up and he
[1:32:05] threw the commandments.
[1:32:09] out of frustration,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; out of anger. Is that right? Brother Ram
[1:32:13] tells us that to that place that was
[1:32:15] temper,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:19] But isn't isn't it tremendous how that
[1:32:22] Satan's desire was to try to break that
[1:32:25] away where Moses it would break that ele
[1:32:29] that element of God with us because you
[1:32:31] see it was Christ in Moses that was God
[1:32:38] bringing the people to the promise of
[1:32:41] the hour.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:44] And Satan does his best
[1:32:46] to try to bring discouragement.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And I want you to see it like this.
[1:32:55] Brother Brandon will take countless
[1:32:58] points throughout the message
[1:33:01] of how that you said people wonder,
[1:33:05] "Brother Brandon, why are you still
[1:33:07] going out among the Pentecostals?
[1:33:09] They're wrong."
[1:33:11] And brother Bram will say in another
[1:33:13] place
[1:33:14] greatest file perseverance on and on
[1:33:16] throughout the message he said they were
[1:33:18] the wrongest that's a word but he says
[1:33:23] that's who I'm to go to.
[1:33:26] I want you to catch this.
[1:33:29] The prophet had got to such a place that
[1:33:33] he had lost the feeling for the people.
[1:33:38] He had become I'm talking about brother
[1:33:40] Brandham now. He had become frustrated,
[1:33:44] right? Why? Because it's just like they
[1:33:46] were rejecting. It's like they weren't
[1:33:48] they weren't coming in and following
[1:33:50] along. But let me just tell you
[1:33:51] something. God didn't excuse that
[1:33:53] behavior.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; And neither could God use him as long as
[1:33:59] he was frustrated or discouraged or
[1:34:01] looking down on the people.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Can't be used. But you see how Satan
[1:34:07] would like to break that? He'd like to
[1:34:08] break that in homes. He'd like to break
[1:34:11] that. Let's bring it down. He'd like to
[1:34:13] break that in the church
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; to where it's just oh my oh my I tell
[1:34:18] you the word's being preached and why
[1:34:19] isn't this Listen,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; you've come here individually not to
[1:34:24] look at the church.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I can see the needs, but I've come here
[1:34:30] to feed.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you daily it's taking the
[1:34:35] needs and daily and weekly God let my
[1:34:38] heart be right. Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Because otherwise it can be of no help.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; What what is that? THAT'S SATAN'S DESIRE
[1:34:47] TO BREAK GOD WITH US.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; GOD'S DESIRE IS TO HELP US. AND YOU
[1:34:52] KNOW, IT'S LIKE I SAID, IT'S VERY EASY
[1:34:54] TO GET DISCOURAGED. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO
[1:34:56] JUST LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING and you
[1:34:59] can see this and you can see THAT IF
[1:35:00] YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU IT'LL START
[1:35:02] RIGHT IN YOUR HOME. IT'LL START RIGHT IN
[1:35:04] YOUR FAMILY. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU
[1:35:05] SOMETHING. WHAT WE NEED WITHIN WHAT WHAT
[1:35:07] IS NEEDED WITHIN THIS HOUR IS TO
[1:35:10] REMEMBER WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR LIFE
[1:35:13] AND OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. GOD IS WITH
[1:35:16] US. IT'S NOT US THAT'S BRINGING RESULTS
[1:35:18] OR THE CHANGE. IT IS GOD THROUGH US.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SO GOOD.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T LET MY WIT BE SMOKY.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; TRIM IT LORD. THIS IS LAMP TRIMMING TIME
[1:35:31] SO THAT THE LIGHT MAY BURN WITH CLARITY,
[1:35:35] intensity
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; because it's hard
[1:35:39] to express and have the joy of the Lord
[1:35:42] and have frustration at the same time.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; It won't.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; It won't.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And listen to me. Having frustration is
[1:35:52] not anybody's fault.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; It's not the people's fault. It's not
[1:35:57] your family's fault.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you have frustration,
[1:36:00] it's because of you.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; And you have to stay in the right
[1:36:04] channel. And let me say, let me listen.
[1:36:06] Oh, brother Samuel, if I was Brother
[1:36:08] Brandham, Brother Brandham being a
[1:36:09] prophet,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; didn't even catch it when it was taking
[1:36:14] place. He's preaching the seals. This
[1:36:16] had already started.
[1:36:18] A powerful series of messages. It had
[1:36:22] already started in his life. And being a
[1:36:24] prophet, you know what that shows over
[1:36:25] and over? What brothers tell us,
[1:36:26] brother? Oh, brother Brandham, I guess
[1:36:28] you don't have to. You know, God just
[1:36:29] shows you everything. He brings it right
[1:36:31] down to us. He says, "No, he doesn't. I
[1:36:34] have to work it out just like you do."
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Brandham, he does he
[1:36:44] doesn't even catch it until he's there
[1:36:48] and God working with him through the
[1:36:49] seven peaks, through the, you know,
[1:36:51] seeing seeing that of the bum on the
[1:36:52] side of the road on on you. You
[1:36:54] understand? and standing in the gap. But
[1:36:55] what God's doing, God's working with
[1:36:57] him, and God brings him back into that
[1:36:59] place to where first of all, he had to
[1:37:03] recognize, I've lost a feeling,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And remember over and over, even with
[1:37:11] the services I spoke to on Thursday
[1:37:13] nights, you can't serve God unless
[1:37:17] you're willing to serve his people.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:22] and the only way we can serve. So, let
[1:37:24] me let me just move on in this part of
[1:37:26] it that it it's Satan's desire to try to
[1:37:29] bring
[1:37:31] discouragement.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And when I say it's our fault, I want to
[1:37:35] say it like this. It's not it's not
[1:37:39] something
[1:37:41] that even as I mentioned that with
[1:37:42] brother Bham that all of a sudden you're
[1:37:44] going to come to a spot and say, "Oh, I
[1:37:46] recognize it. Oh, I recognize it." It
[1:37:49] just it can come in. soul to a place.
[1:37:52] And you know when you start to catch it
[1:37:54] is when you recognize, wait a minute,
[1:37:57] I'm complaining.
[1:37:59] Uh
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; oh,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I'm complaining. That's a heart issue.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; That's a heart issue. When you begin to
[1:38:10] complain, even in your home, it's a
[1:38:13] heart. Oh no, it's my husband. Oh, it's
[1:38:14] my wife. Oh, no. You You're missing it.
[1:38:16] because you'll never win them if your
[1:38:18] heart is not right.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; See, see how Satan wants to block God
[1:38:24] with us.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; It takes the presence of God moving with
[1:38:29] us to bring us into the promises. What
[1:38:32] if Jesus had said, "You guys arguing
[1:38:35] over who's going to be the greatest."
[1:38:37] Such carnality.
[1:38:39] Lord, give me some give me some people
[1:38:42] that are
[1:38:44] got a little bit more oomph to them.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Got a little bit more understanding over
[1:38:48] here arguing about this.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing that's went
[1:38:54] through all the way through the
[1:38:55] scriptures. Humanity.
[1:38:58] Humanity.
[1:38:59] But you know what? All of that within
[1:39:01] humanity, it didn't stop God from
[1:39:05] dwelling with his people. Because let me
[1:39:08] tell you something. God's got a vision
[1:39:10] that's greater than our vision.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why it's important that we
[1:39:15] are in tune with God's vision.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; So now within this part of even how God
[1:39:22] had let Israel know, I'm going to send
[1:39:24] my angel before you. He'll bring you
[1:39:28] into into that place.
[1:39:31] I think that's a that's a scripture.
[1:39:32] Sorry. As God said here, I'll send an
[1:39:35] angel before you to keep you in the way
[1:39:38] and to bring thee into the place that I
[1:39:41] prepared. Beware of him. Obey his voice.
[1:39:44] Provoke him not for he'll not pardon
[1:39:46] your transgressions. For my name is in
[1:39:48] him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his
[1:39:50] voice and do all that I speak, then I'll
[1:39:52] be an en enemy unto thine enemies and an
[1:39:54] adversary unto thy adversaries.
[1:39:57] Here was
[1:39:59] here was Joshua and Caleb.
[1:40:02] And here they are after them seeing and
[1:40:05] witnessing
[1:40:09] the evidence of what God had spoke
[1:40:13] through the prophet and they were
[1:40:16] witnesses of it. And when the rest
[1:40:19] looked at this sign
[1:40:21] of a land that flows with milk and
[1:40:24] honey,
[1:40:27] they forgot.
[1:40:29] They were not looking at
[1:40:33] what they should have been focused on.
[1:40:36] God is with us.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; God has brought us safe thus far. But
[1:40:43] instead, it was looking at the giants,
[1:40:46] looking at the obstacles.
[1:40:48] Friends, anytime we get our focus upon
[1:40:50] all the obstacles, all the why, and all
[1:40:53] the can't be, and all of this,
[1:40:57] we're getting our eyes off of the God
[1:40:59] who's with us.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; The God who is with us is the God who
[1:41:03] will take us all the way through.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; God being right there present to lead
[1:41:09] and to guide. And then here they come.
[1:41:11] They come to to this moment with Balum.
[1:41:15] It says after here they come to this
[1:41:17] moment with Balum and there were those
[1:41:20] that go after
[1:41:22] you know and Balum you know Balam is
[1:41:25] just looking down upon the people all he
[1:41:27] can see is their faults.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; He got up to he got up to a place. This
[1:41:31] is why that when we look at this and you
[1:41:34] you hear you know as I said within
[1:41:38] things where things begin to pick out
[1:41:39] and this and pick and pick. I just tell
[1:41:42] you when when when picking is going on,
[1:41:45] we're in the wrong position.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Balam was was HE WAS UP IN A HIGH PLACE
[1:41:52] AND LOOKING DOWN ON THEM. AND ANYTIME I
[1:41:54] DON'T CARE LIKE BROTHER RAM SAYS, I
[1:41:56] DON'T CARE WHAT WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE,
[1:41:58] THEY WERE WRONG. BUT WHAT BALAM FAILED
[1:42:00] TO SEE WAS THE PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T GOD EXCUSING THEIR WRONG.
[1:42:10] BUT IF ALL YOU CAN SEE IS A BUNCH OF
[1:42:13] FAILURES, YOU'RE NOT LOOKING THROUGH THE
[1:42:15] PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS WHAT LOOKS
[1:42:20] DOWN AND THERE CAN BE EVER SO MUCH
[1:42:22] BROKENNESS
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; CAN BE EVER SO MUCH WELL I DON'T SEE
[1:42:27] THIS AND I DON'T SEE THAT AND I DON'T
[1:42:28] SEE THIS AND I DON'T SEE THAT and I see
[1:42:30] this and I SEE THIS AND I SEE THIS. ARE
[1:42:32] YOU SEEING anything in the word?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go.
[1:42:36] IS THERE ANYTHING? BECAUSE SEE, THROUGH
[1:42:39] ALL OF THESE COMPLEXITIES OF THINGS,
[1:42:41] GOD'S WORKING IN OUR CHARACTER AS
[1:42:44] INDIVIDUALS.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. That's right.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; To be patient,
[1:42:50] to be temperant,
[1:42:52] and to all this because certainly God
[1:42:53] has certainly patient with us.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's certainly been patient with us.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; God working, God with us, right? There
[1:43:02] guiding and bringing them along. And so
[1:43:05] here when Israel did they come into that
[1:43:07] place, brother Ram just said it like
[1:43:09] this. He said regarding Balum, he said
[1:43:12] what he failed to see was the smitten
[1:43:14] rock and the brass serpent and that
[1:43:15] pillar of fire. He tried to judge them
[1:43:17] from a moral standpoint. He failed to
[1:43:20] see the higher call of God by grace, by
[1:43:24] election. They were in line and with
[1:43:26] God's word. Did you catch that? They
[1:43:29] were they were in line with God's word.
[1:43:33] What are you saying, brother Samuel? I'm
[1:43:34] saying that the word that calls is the
[1:43:37] word sufficient to do the work.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; So, it's God working. Same God. Let me
[1:43:49] I'm trying to just tie this here. T just
[1:43:52] a couple more points. We've seen this
[1:43:54] with Abraham and Sarah. Taken that in a
[1:43:57] few services. How that God was right
[1:43:59] there with Abraham. He calls him out of
[1:44:01] of of the valley of Shennar. And God
[1:44:04] works with Abraham through all of his
[1:44:06] ups, through all of his downs, AND THEN
[1:44:09] ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when Sarah is
[1:44:12] in a place
[1:44:14] uh and all through all of their
[1:44:16] misunderstandings. I don't want to dwell
[1:44:18] upon that portion, BUT IT WAS GOD THAT
[1:44:20] WAS WITH THEM THE WHOLE time for what
[1:44:23] purpose? IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT WHAT HE
[1:44:28] HAD SPOKEN. YES. AMEN.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; What if the first time and wonder what
[1:44:36] if the first time when Abram doesn't
[1:44:39] even he doesn't fully leave out of the
[1:44:41] land of Shener? Oh.
[1:44:45] Oh, I knew he wouldn't come very far.
[1:44:47] Well, he's just like a lot of other
[1:44:49] people.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; What faith is that? How can you You
[1:44:53] can't You can't have fa You got TO HAVE
[1:44:54] FAITH. FAITH IN WHAT? IT'S NOT FAITH IN
[1:44:57] PEOPLE. IT'S FAITH IN GOD. AMEN.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND ABRAHAM HERE HE IS
[1:45:04] WALKING ALONG AND GOD AND GOD DEALING
[1:45:07] WITH HIS LIFE. GOD KNOWS HOW TO DEAL
[1:45:09] WITH EVERY ONE OF US. THIS IS WHY THE
[1:45:12] WORD IS SUPREME TO WORK AND TO MINISTER
[1:45:16] AND TO BRING CONVICTION TO DEAL WITH OUR
[1:45:18] HEARTS TO DEAL WITH OUR LIVES JUST IN
[1:45:20] THE RIGHT SEASON.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; This is why God
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; will work right through his word. He's a
[1:45:27] faithful father.
[1:45:29] And the attribute of pastors that is
[1:45:31] much different than evangelists and so
[1:45:33] forth. Evangelist is like the uncle that
[1:45:35] comes in town
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; you know and sometimes the teacher is
[1:45:39] like the you know we we all understand
[1:45:41] that friends you know but but the pastor
[1:45:44] let me just SAY BECAUSE WITH THE PASTOR
[1:45:46] a person says well I I hear I I hear you
[1:45:49] KNOW IT PREACHED ON this and we
[1:45:50] shouldn't do this and we need to LAY
[1:45:51] THIS ASIDE. THEN I'M HEARING YOU KNOW
[1:45:53] IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD TAKING CARE OF IT.
[1:45:55] WHAT IS IT? IT'S OUR FATHER MINISTERING
[1:45:58] TO US WHAT WE HAVE NEED OF.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T COME AND HIS CHILDREN TO
[1:46:03] TOTALLY WIPE THE SPIRIT OUT OF THEIR
[1:46:05] LIFE.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; IT SAID PROVOKE YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO
[1:46:09] ANGER.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; HARDNESS WILL KILL THE SPIRIT.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW CORRECT YOU ARE WITH
[1:46:16] THE WORD. HARDNESS WILL DRIVE AWAY THE
[1:46:19] SPIRIT.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; It's not about being correct. It's about
[1:46:24] being right. in correcting God's word,
[1:46:27] correcting your spirit, correcting your
[1:46:30] heart?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Because hardness breeds resentment.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; And God does not work with his children
[1:46:39] to bring about hardness. This is why
[1:46:41] that God working with us as his family.
[1:46:44] There's times to sit down. There's times
[1:46:46] to talk. There's times to encourage. And
[1:46:49] to catch catching that time, it's
[1:46:50] catching the season just like it is with
[1:46:52] your with with your own family. You have
[1:46:54] to catch that moment. You have to catch
[1:46:55] that season. It's not the same pattern
[1:46:58] all the time. It's catching that season
[1:47:00] and that moment of even of even as they
[1:47:02] get older and you know there's no longer
[1:47:04] going down to the basement you know and
[1:47:05] taking genuine leather and and yet still
[1:47:07] even talking then uh you know and really
[1:47:09] working why what the purpose and all
[1:47:11] that but even then it's working with
[1:47:13] them to to minister to what THEY HAVE
[1:47:15] NEED OF AND NOT JUST EVEN OF SOMETIMES
[1:47:17] the things that is done that you think
[1:47:19] oh dear God but don't respond in
[1:47:21] hardness
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; because God's not hard
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; no sir
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; God even knows the time
[1:47:33] to talk about certain things.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can think, "Oh,
[1:47:38] you know, it's been like at times my
[1:47:40] wife and I and uh
[1:47:44] oh, there she is. Don't worry, I'm not
[1:47:46] going to say anything bad." But there's
[1:47:48] even in those times because you know
[1:47:49] what? We've never passed this way before
[1:47:50] that I can look and say,
[1:47:55] "Not now.
[1:47:57] Not now." And you know what? Let me just
[1:48:00] say this. She's done the same thing to
[1:48:02] me.
[1:48:04] She told me, "Honey, no. No. Just wait."
[1:48:08] I said, "Thank God we're thank God. God
[1:48:10] knows what you're doing putting it
[1:48:11] together." You know, because there's
[1:48:13] certain little things and you know that
[1:48:14] for me and there's certain little things
[1:48:15] for her. But you know what? In listening
[1:48:17] to that, I found that to be God.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I found that to be God. I'd love to be
[1:48:25] able to say, "Man, I listen to it every
[1:48:26] time. Every time was perfect." No, I I
[1:48:28] couldn't be able to say it like that if
[1:48:30] I hadn't made the mistakes.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; But you know what? When you make
[1:48:33] mistakes and you recognize you make
[1:48:34] mistakes, be quick to apologize.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And humble yourself. Because you know
[1:48:38] what that's also doing? That's teaching
[1:48:40] your children of what the life of the
[1:48:42] Holy Spirit is all about.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; It's not about, well, I know. I know
[1:48:46] everything. I've got everything right.
[1:48:47] Everything I've done, you know, it's
[1:48:48] just like it's like God touching Earth.
[1:48:50] No, that's not true.
[1:48:53] That's not true. That's that's false.
[1:48:56] Oh my.
[1:48:59] Let me leave with this.
[1:49:02] Here's Elijah standing on Mount Carmel
[1:49:06] and here the children of Israel are
[1:49:09] gathered together.
[1:49:11] And even after here they are, there's
[1:49:14] you don't see any courage. You don't see
[1:49:16] anybody stepping forward. Nobody
[1:49:18] stepping out on the word. They they they
[1:49:22] believed it. You see, there were 7,000
[1:49:26] that believed
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Jehovah God.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; But they needed
[1:49:34] to see God.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; They needed to have that reality. God
[1:49:41] with us. And it would bring a courage in
[1:49:44] their hearts.
[1:49:46] They had been told, brother Ram
[1:49:48] dramatized it like this in a true sign
[1:49:49] overlook look as though Jehovah doesn't
[1:49:51] care. And he says absolutely Jehovah
[1:49:53] cares about his word.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And Elijah showed us the simplicity
[1:49:58] bringing the stones back together,
[1:50:00] getting the wood in order and the
[1:50:02] sacrifice in order, laying everything
[1:50:05] according to the order of the word. I'm
[1:50:08] so grateful in this hour that God
[1:50:10] through the ministry of Elijah,
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; showed us how to put our lives in order.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for that?
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; It it is God working under that to put
[1:50:23] to show the order. Even the order of a
[1:50:26] home, order of family, order of marriage
[1:50:28] order. God showed it's all under this
[1:50:31] order. It must all be founded upon the
[1:50:34] altar of God.
[1:50:40] So the things that we want, we're
[1:50:42] desiring God to come to things we're
[1:50:45] praying about, things we're looking for.
[1:50:48] But if we'll follow God's order,
[1:50:52] sometimes that order, it might require
[1:50:55] humility.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Well, it will always require that, but
[1:50:59] it may require that of humility.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; To repent.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:06] Because we understand that repentance is
[1:51:08] not just sorry and I'm sorry and I
[1:51:09] continue on. It's real repentance.
[1:51:13] Real repentance is sorrowful. Real
[1:51:16] repentance
[1:51:18] uh as I said even when things are are
[1:51:20] made right or wrong and forgive me and
[1:51:23] you are extending that out you you
[1:51:25] recognize that anytime there's
[1:51:27] repentance then there's got to be trust
[1:51:29] rebuilt maybe with persons or parts
[1:51:32] around us. Is that right? Well, we got
[1:51:35] quiet there. You see, many times we're
[1:51:37] looking say, "Well, hey, wait a minute
[1:51:38] here. If I've repented, then you just
[1:51:40] forgive me." And we go on. There's a
[1:51:42] truth to that. Forgiveness will lead to
[1:51:46] trust.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Bring forth fruits
[1:51:51] meat for repentance."
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, what can bring
[1:51:55] confidence that that repentance was
[1:51:58] godly?
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So sometimes this
[1:52:03] and then this is where all of that comes
[1:52:05] that all comes to play and then it's
[1:52:07] coming into this place God right there
[1:52:10] with Israel and here the fire of God
[1:52:14] after all the water after all is poured
[1:52:17] on here God comes down and vindicates
[1:52:20] his word that he's given Elijah and he
[1:52:23] vindicates that word I'm with you. What
[1:52:27] did that do? Elijah didn't see it.
[1:52:30] Elijah didn't see the 7,000 coming out
[1:52:33] of the caves. Elijah didn't see that. It
[1:52:35] was God that had to tell him after he
[1:52:38] took off running. God had to tell him,
[1:52:42] "Hey, I've got 7,000. You're not the
[1:52:44] only one. You feel all alone. You feel
[1:52:47] You feel that you're the only one." He
[1:52:49] wasn't running him down because that's a
[1:52:50] real feeling.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? LIKE, LORD, I'M THE
[1:52:54] ONLY ONE. I'M THE ONLY ONE STANDING FOR
[1:52:55] TRUTH. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S STANDING.
[1:52:57] I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S RIGHT. OH, GOD.
[1:52:58] I'M THE ONLY ONE. AND GOD HAD TO SAY,
[1:53:01] "WAIT A MINUTE."
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; I USED YOU AS A CHANNEL
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; TO COME up there and for the WORD TO BE
[1:53:11] PUT BACK IN PUT IN ITS PLACE AND THE
[1:53:14] PEOPLE HAVE ROSE WITH COURAGE IN THEIR
[1:53:16] HEARTS BECAUSE YOU WERE A CHANNEL FOR ME
[1:53:19] TO COME DOWN THROUGH.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; I think you're SEEING VERY CLEARLY GOD'S
[1:53:25] CALLED US TO BE A CHANNEL. CALLED US TO
[1:53:27] BE CHANNELS, BUT HOW EVEN THE ENEMY
[1:53:30] WOULD LIKE TO GET IN THERE AND hinder
[1:53:31] that channel.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Because even throughout the
[1:53:34] congregation, WE HAVE LIVES, WE HAVE
[1:53:36] HEARTS, lives that HAVE JUST COME TO
[1:53:39] KNOW THE LORD. LIVES ARE IN JOURNEY,
[1:53:41] LIVES THAT ARE MAYBE YOU MIGHT SAY,
[1:53:42] "WELL, THIS PERSON'S BEEN WALKING FOR 15
[1:53:45] YEARS OR 20 YEARS OR 30 YEARS." BUT LOOK
[1:53:48] BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND LOOK DOWN
[1:53:50] AND SAY, "A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD."
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yes, sir.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; We must have that.
[1:54:00] We must have that
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; because that's what God has for us. It's
[1:54:05] God with us.
[1:54:09] And God being with us,
[1:54:12] it brings us to that place
[1:54:15] for him to fulfill his word in our life.
[1:54:18] So God just doesn't just do something.
[1:54:22] God just didn't
[1:54:25] do something in the lives of the
[1:54:26] disciples,
[1:54:28] but he he manifested himself. He walked
[1:54:32] with them. He was right there with them
[1:54:34] the whole way. This word, what God is
[1:54:38] even desiring to do in our lives, he's
[1:54:42] right here with us to bring us all the
[1:54:45] way.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; No matter the obstacles, because we're
[1:54:47] going to have them.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; You're going to have opposition. You're
[1:54:50] even going to have times of up and down.
[1:54:53] David said he knows my in- and-outs. He
[1:54:54] knows my up uprising and my downside. He
[1:54:57] knows that. But God also knows and has
[1:54:59] confidence in his word. His word knows
[1:55:01] how to straight line things.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; He knows how to bring things right in
[1:55:05] line and bring things right in order.
[1:55:08] And sometimes God will speak and deal
[1:55:10] with things right through the word. And
[1:55:12] it will be word by word by word by word
[1:55:15] by word. And then there's other times
[1:55:16] the Holy Spirit will come and it's God
[1:55:19] making known his word, God making known
[1:55:21] his promise. And it just calls to the
[1:55:23] person, calls to the individual's heart,
[1:55:25] calling to our lives, hey, it's time.
[1:55:27] It's time to rise and take the promise
[1:55:29] of God for your life. It's time. It's
[1:55:31] time to rise. And you know what? The
[1:55:34] only thing that can actually deal with
[1:55:37] and dismiss every excuse,
[1:55:40] every fear,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; is the presence of God.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Because there's no
[1:55:46] other, as the prophet said, and I close
[1:55:48] with this, there's no other higher court
[1:55:52] of appeal than the presence of God.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; When God has spoken,
[1:56:00] don't look at yourself. Look at the word
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; and go to action upon that word.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I might be in the
[1:56:09] flesh. That's the devil. You go upon the
[1:56:12] word. You've heard the word. You
[1:56:14] recognize this is God speaking. You
[1:56:16] recognize it. You go into action upon
[1:56:18] that word and take a hold of that word
[1:56:20] and watch what God will do through your
[1:56:24] life.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Why? God with us.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; See, the God that's right here with us
[1:56:31] is the God who comes in us. And yet,
[1:56:33] he's right here still right with us,
[1:56:34] guiding us all the way. It's him that's
[1:56:37] revealing, even showing up our
[1:56:40] weaknesses and our deficiencies. But
[1:56:42] isn't it incredible? He's as a faithful
[1:56:45] father, he's not doing this in a way to
[1:56:48] dishearten us.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; If you feel disheartened, it's not the
[1:56:54] voice of God.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; God's voice is not trying to take
[1:56:58] anything from you. As a matter of fact,
[1:56:59] he's trying to let you know what he
[1:57:01] already has for you.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; That's why he's here to encourage you.
[1:57:03] Is God with us?
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[1:57:10] Heavenly Father,
[1:57:14] Lord, how thankful we are. I Lord as
[1:57:18] I've
[1:57:20] just spoke Lord just from my heart here
[1:57:22] this morning
[1:57:24] many things Lord that
[1:57:27] been very
[1:57:29] very present Lord as we've been looking
[1:57:31] at these uh points Lord of being fully
[1:57:35] consecrated to the word by the spirit
[1:57:38] and just Lord just to see that that
[1:57:41] aspect your prophet would would catch it
[1:57:45] even among
[1:57:46] uh the people that would even be there
[1:57:48] to where their hesitancy
[1:57:51] at times to just grab a hold of the word
[1:57:54] and and just to take what the word was
[1:57:56] saying.
[1:57:59] Lord, I'm so glad that you you have
[1:58:03] provided what we have need of. Lord,
[1:58:08] every one of us, how many times as your
[1:58:10] prophet when he takes that of Abraham
[1:58:12] and Sarah and he brings it right down to
[1:58:14] our lives, he said, "How many times?"
[1:58:18] Like he said, "God would have killed
[1:58:20] Sarah if she hadn't been part of
[1:58:22] Abraham."
[1:58:23] He said, "Oh, how many times
[1:58:27] would we have been dead?"
[1:58:30] even things Lord that we have looked at
[1:58:33] in our life
[1:58:35] and the words speaking to our hearts.
[1:58:38] Oh, it it may not be
[1:58:42] where we would where we would see it
[1:58:44] like Sarah laughed in her heart, but yet
[1:58:49] when the word comes to speak to us, then
[1:58:52] all of a sudden, Lord, there's that
[1:58:54] voice and that thought, "Yeah, but you
[1:58:57] tried before.
[1:58:59] Yeah, but you said before.
[1:59:03] And then the thought, well, how how many
[1:59:04] times are are you going to have prayer?
[1:59:08] How many? But Lord,
[1:59:10] I pray may in your presence right here.
[1:59:16] Your name shall be called and is called
[1:59:18] Emmanuel, God with us.
[1:59:21] It's in your presence.
[1:59:24] like your prophet as he said there in
[1:59:26] that message is super sign.
[1:59:30] Take God with you.
[1:59:33] If something that's troubling,
[1:59:36] maybe it's a besetting sin, maybe it's a
[1:59:38] weight, take God with you.
[1:59:43] Put it into God's hands.
[1:59:47] Maybe there's something that Lord that
[1:59:49] we just don't know how to get beyond.
[1:59:52] But your grace is sufficient.
[1:59:56] Father,
[1:59:58] you accompany your word.
[2:00:01] And where your word is preached, the
[2:00:03] Holy Spirit
[2:00:06] moves,
[2:00:09] oh God.
[2:00:13] No greater move, Lord, that we could
[2:00:15] could ask and be thankful for it than
[2:00:18] that our hearts would be moved, Lord.
[2:00:23] For Lord, through that
[2:00:26] it'll set everything else in motion. I
[2:00:30] ask right now, Father,
[2:00:33] in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord God,
[2:00:36] may you just pierce through every doubt
[2:00:40] of darkness, every doubt of unbelief.
[2:00:44] Oh God, may every heart, Lord, the
[2:00:46] request that they would have on their
[2:00:48] hearts, needs that they have, petitions,
[2:00:51] Lord, promises.
[2:00:54] I pray, Father,
[2:00:56] may it be focused in upon your voice,
[2:01:01] looking unto Jesus, who's the author and
[2:01:03] the finisher of our faith.
[2:01:06] Lord, you're right here with us to guide
[2:01:08] us, you've never forsaken us.
[2:01:12] And even if Lord that we've
[2:01:15] maybe gotten away from you, maybe like
[2:01:19] your prophet said, we get the feeling
[2:01:20] that maybe we've got a right for this or
[2:01:22] a right this. And he said the spirit of
[2:01:26] God, the dove will just take its flight.
[2:01:27] But it don't go very far. It just goes
[2:01:29] up on that limb and the only thing that
[2:01:31] we have to do is become
[2:01:34] a lamb again.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Invite the dove of the Holy Spirit.
[2:01:39] invite him back to lead us,
[2:01:42] Lord. I pray may you give grace to every
[2:01:45] heart to just realize, Lord, and just to
[2:01:49] just pull and draw upon that simplicity,
[2:01:51] your desire for fellowship, your desire
[2:01:55] to be right there with us, Lord, to not
[2:01:58] only to be with us, but to walk in us
[2:02:00] and to bring us into that place that you
[2:02:03] prepared. I'm asking that Lord that you
[2:02:06] would help me as the pastor of this
[2:02:10] assembly. Lord,
[2:02:14] help me Lord
[2:02:16] that Lord that I would have the patience
[2:02:19] that's needed for this season, for this
[2:02:23] hour.
[2:02:26] Lord, you know, over and over I as I
[2:02:29] come to you, Lord,
[2:02:33] I see Lord in my own self
[2:02:38] that need of you, Lord. Oh, I know,
[2:02:41] Lord. I've I've said that over and over,
[2:02:43] but I just see Lord, within this time,
[2:02:48] oh God, as I've asked you, Lord, you can
[2:02:51] have my hands,
[2:02:54] but I want you to have my heart.
[2:02:56] I want you to, Lord, everything, every
[2:02:58] part, every every aspect of my life.
[2:03:01] Just Lord God,
[2:03:05] I commit it, Lord, all to you. Because
[2:03:07] when my heart is right, then Lord, the
[2:03:09] hands, they'll be right.
[2:03:15] There's a lot of battles, Lord, that we
[2:03:17] come through. There's a lot of things
[2:03:19] that can be discouraging. I don't just
[2:03:21] speak, Lord, as as a pastor, but Lord, I
[2:03:23] know I'm speaking to families,
[2:03:25] father, mother, husband, wife, so forth.
[2:03:31] Oh God,
[2:03:35] help us to be in tune.
[2:03:40] Help us to be in tune, Father.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, so temper us in this moment.
[2:03:47] Oh God, it's in your presence, Lord,
[2:03:50] where our hearts are softened.
[2:03:53] It's in your presence,
[2:03:56] Lord. Help us.
[2:03:59] We don't want to go through motions.
[2:04:02] We want to enter in
[2:04:06] saturate our lives. Lord
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; with the due of heaven. Lord,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; forgive us Lord of
[2:04:14] Father the slackness. Forgive us Lord of
[2:04:18] Dear God just just allowing and and not
[2:04:22] recognizing. But I believe your presence
[2:04:24] is here to help us to catch these
[2:04:28] things, Lord.
[2:04:30] As we have families, we have hearts, we
[2:04:32] have loved ones, Lord, there's others
[2:04:34] right here in the assembly,
[2:04:38] right here, each and every one of us.
[2:04:42] God, use us
[2:04:44] how you would see fit
[2:04:47] that others might see you
[2:04:51] to see you.
[2:04:54] Grant it Lord I pray.
[2:04:59] We love you Lord. We thank you for your
[2:05:00] mercies.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Oh grant it Lord in Jesus name.
[2:05:08] Amen.
[2:05:11] Hallelujah.
[2:05:14] Oh my. You just take a hold of that
[2:05:16] promise. Go ahead.
[2:05:20] I know his spirit
[2:05:23] that's moving
[2:05:27] to
[2:05:30] give my heart
[2:05:34] and he speaks
[2:05:37] to me.
[2:05:41] Oh,
[2:05:43] and I
[2:05:45] agree.
[2:05:51] And Lord, please come
[2:05:55] and take
[2:05:57] control.
[2:05:59] I feed
[2:06:01] the poor.
[2:06:05] Oh,
[2:06:07] at night
[2:06:09] I lay in bed
[2:06:13] and I began
[2:06:17] to cry
[2:06:24] and my mind
[2:06:27] just
[2:06:30] know exactly
[2:06:34] Wow.
[2:06:40] Oh, I can't explain
[2:06:44] with tongue or pen.
[2:06:48] But the spirit's growing
[2:06:52] deep
[2:06:54] within.
[2:06:56] It must be God
[2:07:00] here in my soul.
[2:07:03] Cuz I feel
[2:07:06] the pull.
[2:07:11] I feel
[2:07:13] the
[2:07:19] I hear the call.
[2:07:27] And I know his spirit.
[2:07:31] It's moving
[2:07:33] me
[2:07:35] to give my all.
[2:07:40] Help me give my all. He speaks
[2:07:45] to me
[2:07:50] and I I agree.
[2:07:59] Lord, please come
[2:08:02] and take
[2:08:04] control.
[2:08:06] I feel
[2:08:08] the Oh,
[2:08:14] I went to hear the word
[2:08:20] and with
[2:08:22] each line
[2:08:24] and pray.
[2:08:30] He was drawing
[2:08:34] me
[2:08:36] to give
[2:08:38] a higher
[2:08:41] praise.
[2:08:46] I know there's a deep
[2:08:50] a deep call to the deep.
[2:08:54] It's like a great magnet
[2:08:58] pulling
[2:09:00] me.
[2:09:01] And I know for sure
[2:09:05] that I'll reach my goal
[2:09:09] cuz I feel
[2:09:12] the poor.
[2:09:15] Oh, I feel the poor. I feel
[2:09:19] the poor.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:25] I hear
[2:09:27] the call
[2:09:34] and I know his spirit
[2:09:37] moving
[2:09:39] me
[2:09:41] to give
[2:09:43] my all. Help me give my all. He speaks
[2:09:51] to me.
[2:09:53] Lord, you speak to me and I
[2:10:06] please come

[2:10:10] control.
[2:10:13] I feel the
[2:10:17] Lord.
[2:10:20] Oh Lord, please come
[2:10:24] and take control.
[2:10:28] I feel
[2:10:32] the
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:10:40] meal
[2:10:42] with your glory
[2:10:47] and overwhelm
[2:10:50] me
[2:10:52] for I am yours. Oh Lord, I am thirsty.

[2:17:01] For in my weakness, you are merciful.
[2:17:09] The redeemer of my past and present
[2:17:14] wrongs.
[2:17:16] Oh Lord, you are the holder of my future
[2:17:20] days to come.
[2:17:24] Oh Lord, your presence
[2:17:29] is heaven
[2:17:33] to me.

[2:19:23] to me.
[2:19:32] Oh my. Thank you, Lord.

[2:19:38] Moses said, "Lord,
[2:19:40] if your presence go not up,
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; don't take me any further.
[2:19:47] I want to stay right where your presence
[2:19:49] is.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want to make another step. I I I
[2:19:55] want your presence
[2:19:57] to be right with us, Lord.
[2:20:00] Lead us, Lord, into that place.
[2:20:03] Oh,

[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:08] Isn't that powerful? Just to be able to
[2:20:10] have that request, to have that
[2:20:12] openness, to have that with God and say,
[2:20:15] "Lord, if your presence go not with me,
[2:20:18] don't take me, Lord Jesus. I don't want
[2:20:20] to go I don't want to move one step
[2:20:22] further cuz it's not going to be you. I
[2:20:24] want to be where you're at, Lord.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; I want to be right where you're at,
[2:20:27] Lord. Walking right in step with you,
[2:20:30] Lord Jesus."
[2:20:32] Hallelujah.
