invite you Lord that you'll just come and be the speaker and they here here together Lord and just have your way Among Us Lord we pray we commit this service Lord into your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I'm going to ask you to turn with me if you would to uh The Book of Ruth and I want to at least begin there and many things upon my heart um we'd like to just look in some of these points and and I want to I want to go here to beginning with verse 16 and that's just or verse 15 in order to refer back and bring us up to where I want to actually start with here today Ruth chapter two sorry Ruth chapter 2 Ru chapter 2 verse 15 and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaths and reproach her not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an epha of barley and she took it up and went into the City and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed and notice in verse 19 and her mother-in-law said unto her where hast thou gleaned today Lord and where roughest out now what she's looking at is evidence the evidence is causing her to ask a question where have you been today it wasn't because Ruth herself looked different it's what she is in possession of that's what caused Naomi to ask this question and notice Blessed Be he that did take knowledge of thee she knows but this evidence someone has taken knowledge of you because you would not have come back here with this much see the awareness of of Naomi making her aware of this and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had rought and said the man's name with whom I wrot today is Boaz prise the Lord and Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law Blessed Be he of the Lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and Naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next Kinsmen that is so good amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just draw your attention there just for a moment when we look at how that God through Boaz and this type we know that Boaz himself it's a type of Christ our Our Redeemer our kinsman redeemer and when we look at that term of kinsman in the Scripture it is it is one who has to be of a near relative and there's qualifications that not only must they be of a of a near relative but they also must be be willing to do the work of the Kinsman what's needed to pay the debt to release what has come into under the uh property of somebody else they've got to be willing to release it and they also have to be willing or able financially to be able to do that and I'm telling you there's no one else that could release you and I from the debt of sin but God himself come down and become one of us if you look back in the scripture of Ruth chap 2 and verse 1 the Bible says and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of ELC and his name was Boaz so notice the description of of Boaz that he he's a mighty man of wealth now I want you to notice in the scripture here I want to just begin to lay this in Naomi is not planting Ruth in the field Naomi was not somehow you know trying to bring na Ruth into a place to you know try to find Boaz you find no mention of the instruction of Naomi saying try to find Boaz but she knows Naomi has returned back to her Homeland she also knows that these fields that are to glean in are a part of the tribe it's connected with the family and here she is sending Ruth in to glean as Ruth would glean as other other uh uh those that would pour and would come in there but yet she received a special privilege to be able to glean with boaz's handmaids Boaz when he descends he speaks to the chief Reaper remember there's a chief Reaper who's over the rest of the Reapers God sends he has seven stars in his right hand is that right God sends a message to a generation it's God coming as the scripture said he that hath an ear let him hear what the scri what the spirit sayth to the churches that's not only speaking to us coming down as an individual but first it God speaks to the messenger of that age and God delivers a word that will actually sweep down and it takes a hold of the predestinated seed who are in that age and so here Boaz he comes to the Reapers and says who is this damsel who is she we we've looked at this in the scripture and the chief Reaper is the one that begins to disclose who she is this is this is Ruth uh uh the moitas the morit is that came back with Naomi and he says unto her when he finally comes to talk to her it has been fully showed to me all that thou Hast done leaving thy land of Nativity leaving the country and coming here to sojurn you know she had to make a decision she had a choice that was before her that's good is that right yeah now I want you to turn back in Roman in Ruth chapter one and I want you to look in Ruth chapter 1 with me here for just a moment and in Ruth chapter 1 when when n when Ruth and Ora are at this place and they're you know they their their husbands had passed away away uh Naomi's husband had passed away and they hear that there's the Gathering of of God has blessed the country of Israel the Homeland with bread now remember when all of this has happened God's trying to get Naomi and trying to get all of them back in position think of this here is a Jew here's a gentile the same event is putting both back in position that's why the prophet could stand there in the early part of the message and he says the angel of the Lord is on Earth tonight the same one that's running Israel back to the Homeland is the same one that met me that night and delivered this message to me and is right here Among Us it's God getting all of these parts together right where they need to be but notice how this was mentioned here with Naomi and with Ruth in in verse uh8 when the scripture says or verse 7 let me go there when when she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah and Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me now watch this the Lord grant you that you might find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they left lifted up their voice and wept now notice here because even of where their care at that point here is where Naomi could say may you find rest in the house of your husband because why you see this word rest here we know that there we know that we're coming to that place as we're looking in the scripture where Naomi will say in the beginning of Ruth chapter 3 I I that I may find rest for you or a security for you but right back here in chapter one she said because of your kindness may you find rest in the house of your husband now Ruth's husband's dead Orphus husband's dead but remember they were free they were they were uh of even of time to even be remarried they had a choice to go back and marry right back among the systems that they were a part of is that right you see listen friends this is why that when we consider the message of the hour that we've received it's a calling to a higher standard and the standard that we're being called to is Christ in you the hope of glory not just a good person not just good works yeah listen for a real child of God those works are already packed in you when you come here they're in the seed but it takes the Holy Spirit to come upon you to begin to release that that's a scripture for ordained that we would walk in them but listen that's is why that you can look at it and you can talk to maybe some that are in denominations don't try to run them out of where they are if they don't have a burden to walk on with God leave them alone they have found their rest there but that's not the rest of the Holy Ghost are you with they're happy where they're at there'll be there'll be tribulation they're not going to go in the Rapture because to go in the Rapture you must come into the rest of God which is the Holy Ghost upon your soul that changes your nature and lines you with the word of God if there's attributes you can say well I believe the word of God if there's attributes coming out against the word of God then it hasn't went down to where it needs to be are you hearing me now you haven't found a place of rest because to find rest when he comes in fully to your life the desires of sin are gone it's a love for God this is where the Fulfillment of what God did after six days on the seventh day the Bible said God rested from all his labors and when the Holy Spirit has come into a life it's not you laboring against sin but there is a rest that has come into your life and you have ceased from your worldly Ways by the power of the holy spirit that separates you from the desire they could line everything up in from you but you say I have no desire for it why Who removed that desire God Amen thank you Lord that's so good no she said that you know that you might find rest there but you know there's a call you can't I'll tell you how blessed it is if you can't be just satisfied just in looking and saying well I thank God for salvation but there's there's deeper walk there's a deeper walk listen friends we're living in the hour of the sealing Angel we're living in the time where the seal is required the time where the Seal of the token is given to the Church of the Living God and you know what that seal is listen even before the seal itself comes upon a life when he comes Among Us it brings AR rest to realize first of all I did not bring myself to this I didn't bring myself here I'm not the one that stirred this up in my life there was something already there on the inside you see the ministring because listen I'm telling you who this is his one of the characteristics of Christ's own word and his name is a man of rest that's who Noah was Noah his name means a man of rest Solomon a man of rest I'm to bring a rest and this is why when the word when we can stop and just just listen this is why he passes among us the way he does and let me just tell you something rest doesn't mean like me laying down here on this bench that's not what rest means rest means me you yielding to his leading that is so good that's that's what it is it's with the rest to know he's here he's right Among Us he's the one that's leading the Church of the Living God he's the one that's that's moving in a way like I said there on Thursday night the winds that swept through here the other the I think it was Wednesday or Tuesday when they swept through here and some of you I don't know if you've seen the how some of those trees and things had' Fallen back back there but you know when you see it I never seen the wind you didn't see the wind either am but you saw evidence that the wind was moving trees were swaying leaves were blowing limbs were falling you were seeing the evidence of things being affected by the wind is that right and that's the same thing that as he comes Among Us he's identifying himself that he's the same yes yesterday today and forever how does he do that how do you and I know him we know him as he comes according to his word and reveals himself by his word and opens our understanding God I hope you understand this I I I think we've we've we've even laid upon this listen friends we recognize and and we need healing there's times where God will do Miracles just like this and other times the miracle will come later on but let me just tell you something around the bride is not the only place where there's healing are you hearing me this is why the part of it listen to me this is why the part of it that that many they can get caught in a thing and say well they have healings over there or or there so and so was healed here sure you can walk even maybe among other churches today there's testimonies I I have loved ones there's testimonies that they have but listen friends God not coming back for simply testimonies of healing to the body there's a deeper work than that and that's the soul that's what the Holy Ghost came to do it came to redeem thank you this body will eventually come under the Redemption but Redeemer means something that belongs to him this is why you battle with this constantly because this the way it came he did not come this is not what he came to redeem he came to redeem the soul and it will lead us back to a place to where the very atoms of our body will be changed we won't be coming through a woman come on he's not going to have to go to the graveyard and open up the graves I know we sing that song it's all right I don't mind the song Ain't No Grave going to hold my body down but it ain't scriptural I'm I mean I'll still sing it but it's not because you know why it doesn't matter where it's at it could be a spoonful of Ashes here or there buried in the sea or whatever more consumed by fire but God will speak and we will come [Applause] forth Hallelujah this is why the whole ministering of the word it brings us here into a place of rest and I want you to notice this how that even when Naomi comes to Ruth here and she asked her the question she says where have you been today where have you been hallu you know what church where you going where have you been where because she what she's looking at is the evidence right you see that's what ought to be that's what must be in our lives you know what a seal is a seal is an Evidence yes that's what the Seal of the holy spirit is when God dealing with your life that's an Evidence it's an Evidence of the holy spirit that takes a life through justification sanctification and then into the baptism of the Holy Ghost where you and I are recognized as Believers Hallelujah the seal it's an evidence that shows coming and going it's an Evidence in our life that will cause others to ask a question listen friends it's not about listen what she was looking at was the evidence right we can be ever so smart God's not coming back for scripture memorization God's not coming back to see how many quotes we can quote I believe in getting in the word that's no excuse for not being in the word because let me tell you something if there's something in you listen your flesh will always want to kick against it but I'm going to tell you if you don't have something on the inside to pull that outer man in line it's time you get what you need to pull that outer man into line there should be a love of God in your soul for the things of God it ought to be the things of God that matter more than anything of this world I'm not talking about smoking and drinking and anything else that's on very much an elementary level I'm talking about if there's anything that has a priority above the word of God and the simple things even with that it comes with the forsaking not to assemble ourselves together come on Friends when we're not making excuses and reasoning against the word of God let me tell you something don't you try to compare yourself with somebody else you compare yourself with the word that's what'll bring you rest that's what'll bring you stability because you can look at somebody else and say I should be doing this I should be doing that then you only become an impersonator you must have a direct connection with God you are an individual and God intends for you to have an individual experience and for him to work with you in an individual level amen this is why Boaz came to Ruth individually he came to you on an individual level somebody might have spoke to you might have been a human Veil but it was God clothed in that Veil that spoke to you absolutely yes it's God dealing and moving and working in your life that's is that right so notice here where where she's at where where have you been you know she's seeing an Evidence in her life I'm sure many can fellowship with me on this there were evidences when God begin to get a hold of a life there's evidences that started to come in my life even though it wasn't all at once but there were evidences there were things that begin to move and go and flee out of my life desires begin to go there were evidences that that you know other could see that this these are things that I'm no longer bothered by but you know what the things that even that were still seeming to tug on my life brother Samuel what did you do I laid it down by God's grace and said Lord I don't want this in my life you got to be willing to lay it down well I need God to take it from me the prophet said in marriage of the Lamb he said me people are saying oh if God only take this evil spirit from me I'll serve him he said you have something to do am it's where we stand on that place and say I'm not going to tolerate the enemy taking this in my life the intimidation and and the things that he wants to try to hold me with I want to be a fully evidenced Christian come on friends we got to take the initiative the spirit of this age is a spirit of soft Easy Living it's like everything needs to be handed to us and done for us listen he's already went to Calvary he rose from the grave he ascended on high and he sent back the Holy Ghost he sent a message to you and I now it is up to you and I do you now believe am hallu that's where it comes down to now when we look at this here with Ruth where have where have you been today because you're seeing the evidence praise the Lord and Naomi after Ruth says this is the man's name Boaz now it's evident Naomi has not talked with Ruth about Boaz right right but this is the man's name who took knowledge of me and Naomi said unto her daughter Blessed Be he of the Lord who hath not left left off his kindness to the living and to the dead right and Naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next Kinsmen now I want you to notice what's happened when Naomi came back into the land she said call me Mara call me bitter because God hath dealt with me bitterly let me just say this to you God we was not going to lose one when Naomi went out decisions that were made no doubt it wasn't Naomi's decision but she being a faithful companion has she walked with immc and went out there but notice anytime brother br will say it over and over he takes Abraham's life brings it all the way down anytime we get out of the god-given land that God has given us there's always going to be trouble let me just say this to you it's a good litmus test that when you see trouble coming around don't always be quick to call trouble trials are you hearing me friends because sometimes that can be very deceiving and sometime the troubles are not trials it's God trying to bring us to awareness you've got outside of the boundaries of the land that I have given you to abide in that's right yeah friends it's of the Lord's mercies that we're not [Music] consumed it's of the God's mercies because let me just tell you something like this there's times when every one of us have gotten out of the bounds of this land sometimes we got out of the bounds of this land with our attitudes come on now because remember it's not all black and white this is the word of God but remember what was revealed in this hour God did not come and reveal a Doctrine it was the person of Jesus Christ the character of almighty God has been brought on display to the Church of the Living God so there's sometimes where you don't find things as far as saying where is this at in the scripture how do I approach this situation you have to look at the character of Christ how do I approach this as a Christian as a Believer remember the prophet said even when tests and Trials Come not to be complaining and moping but let us conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of god notice not not the Holy Spirit conduct for us but us being empowered some you know when when the Holy Spirit is come it is quickened you and I as Sons and Daughters of God but it is not you and I sitting around like the Pinocchio puppet and God doing everything it's up to us to yield and surrender to the word of God it's up to you and I the Bible said if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body the Bible said that the weapons of our Warfare are are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds we just in our own reasoning in our own thought process we are a failure but if we will submit to the Holy Spirit which is the word of God which is the character of God then we receive a strength to pull down strongholds Hall oh brother you might say brother Samuel when I look at this with Naomi and I look at it too like this here you have a situation that Naomi I'm just going to tell you she didn't see any hope she knew the Bible lets us know in Roman in Chapter 2 that there was a man a mighty man of wealth of Boaz but remember she had been out of the land it ain't like how you and I communicate today even across the seas you know like I have to turn my ringer off cuz I have brothers in Uganda and other places you know right you know texting in the middle of the night and so so it ain't like that they they didn't have that but you know what God is leading everything right just where it needs to be but as soon as Naomi catches a glimpse of what is in Ruth's possession Ruth does not even fully aware of what she has are you hearing me friends when God sent this message in this adal see and day the church was not fully aware of what was among them the birthright had come among them the Seal of the Living God had come among them the son of man was visiting the church in his fullness and his power but how many said oh the gifts in operation that's a prophet but don't he to his Doctrine oh no don't follow that don't go along with that listen you can even find the different ones today that'll talk of it there's there's men that have actually went and they meet up in Arizona in a hotel room and here they are they have connections with different ones that are you know in the message and things and they get out there and they're talking yes this is a special place this is where the Angels Came and they're in the hotel and we believe that what God did there it was only just a little tip of what God is going to be doing through a group of people and I looked at that in the video and I'm saying you got women sitting there in pants they got earrings in that you can put a saddle on and put your feet in come on Friends the Holy Ghost cleans us up you know an earrings AR it's a sign of slavery it is that right the Bible said when they refused to go away they were bored in the ear right is that right this is why that even when we look at that even with paint paint's not even real there's only one person in the Bible that ever painted her face and that was Jezebel are you hearing me follow me now you're not going to find one scripture it says Thou shalt not paint thy face I know where I'm at brother Brown quotes are writing forsaking it all in the message but what you look at is the characteristic why was it being done look even science tells you it's not even natural the carcinogens that are in it come on friends that's so good it's not natural you know what it is it's Spirits this is where Ruth was at here she was and and the situations that was moving around and Naomi is working and and wanting to minister to Ruth but so many have looked at just the message and did not catch it for what the message really is now let me tell you something we can sit here all day and throw off on that but I'm asking you have you caught what this message is all about this message is about a relationship between Christ and his bride that's right it's about Christ coming in you the hope of glory amen are you hearing me right oh my when he comes in man oh has he he's the love of your life it's all that matters it's all that matters that forsaking and laying aside of everything now notice this if Naomi had not been there Ruth would if Naomi hadn't said anything Ruth would have never known she'd had just continued on with handfuls of purpose thank God for handfuls of purpose but what are they about because you realize that the church and when I say the church even sometimes it can come right Among Us well God's blessing me I you know I feel good I feel but you see friends that can be so deceptive it's got to come where is your life with the word that takes a courageous stand amen cuz you could rehearse all the doctrines of the message you can be anointed to speak in tongues you can have all kinds of emotions and I believe in emotions I'm not against emotions but at the end of the day there's only one thing that declares we are an overcomer and that's the word of God are you hearing me this is why when the holy spirit being poured out it can be poured out upon All Flesh it can come there upon the Flesh and anoint the flesh anoint even in the spirit but it's got to come down to the soul the purpose of this message was to bring a relationship between God and man is that not what the prophet said at the end and the closing of the church age book right even on the leaflets in the tape box that they put on there not for one moment do I bring a message to start an organization or that people might follow me but I have one purpose and one goal that I am for and that's to see a real relationship and Union to be brought between God and his people the only way that Union could be is because veils have been torn down veils of tradition Where Have You Been Ruth and Ruth said well the man's name is he's Boaz it's Boaz can you imagine Naomi Boaz because you know why she knows who Boaz is you see Jesus of the new is Jehovah of the old what he came to fulfill he came to fulfill that of the Old Testament all of what spoke of him in his messiahship is that right also was hidden in there about the calling of a gentile bride but that was all hidden in there and laid in there naomy now ministering to Ruth about what is at hand I want you just to just to think of this of how that where it's at and you know brother BR says it like this let me let me find it here as he says it in this manner he says concerning who it is right here that that is Among Us and I want you to watch how he's got it heard it here in the message the Easter seal I don't have it up there he said I want you to think of it he's he's talking to the people at the end he said how can you leave something like this uh don't you believe him H how can you do it h you you just it looks like you just you have to pull yourself away do you feel that he said maybe it's just me but but I had a feeling just a strange feeling when I come among the people where you set together like this I know somewhere invisible here just like radio television whatever it is passing through this room Christ is in this room just think Our Redeemer is here notice he's seeing the evidences I I feel his presence come on friends oh brother Samuel we're not to go according to feelings the brother brandom said it like this he said for those that want to tear down upon emotions he said let me ask you what is it that comes Upon a person he said that would cause them to begin to praise the Lord and Shout cuz I know a lot of these things have taken a hit because it's really unbalance the way things have been presented but let me just say it to you like this brother R said what it is that could not be a response like that if the Holy Spirit not coming upon a nerve somewhere and there's a response to the word of God hallelujah come on friends sometimes they realize you got a lot of dry hides that's try to take away the real moving of the Holy Spirit reduce it down to just a a believism and a and just what we just accept it and we just believe it the holy spirit let me just go ahead and tell you the day that the holy spirit is no longer welcome here I will [Applause] resign how resigning you can have it all because without him this church is nothing you can have all the books you can have all the tapes you can have all the quotes but if you don't have him let me just say what a prophet said it's nothing but a Beed dead corpse hallu we don't want to legislate worship out of the church we don't want to legislate a moving of the Holy Spirit Come on [Applause] friends and I think it's clear enough you know exactly where I stand according to the word you you be how God has made you to be if not then you just simply be impersonating somebody else that's are you hearing me right amen amen well I might as well say it while I'm at it that's why I don't believe we come here to work and try to evaluate I wonder if so and so's doing this because of so and so you need your mind in the right place God never sent you or anybody here to sit here and be a judge of somebody else you need to come and get focused on God who knows God might get a hold of you come on Friends I tell you better be careful the voices you listen [Applause] to abely a lot of times I've had individuals well I see this quote I said yeah but there's another quote too I'm not just a one quote man you if you take that quote and then it's going against this one right here something's wrong not with the quotes with your interpretation nothing wrong with the message nothing wrong with the message is that right now notice this just think Our Redeemer he's here who could be any happier than people who possess with Bible evidence of every word of God being made manifest to see even to angels and his being as they have Through the Ages Hallelujah think of it what we're seeing and moving Among Us now let me just let me just turn the corner here to try to try to tie this here just a moment Naomi she didn't see any hope but as soon as this evidence was seen in Ruth's possession right she had a restored hope hallelujah amen is that right she had faith in God but now she now she begins to talk about a he's a near Kinsman notice she's not just focused on those handfuls of meal like glory to God thank God hey look they were happy they weren't starving they were well fed but but the purpose of this who is it it's it's him it's him it's he's a he's he's a Kinsman he's a next of kin is that right I want you to think about there no doubt has been we can see down through the scriptures there's been many times no doubt times in your life my life and will be where it looks like there's no hope for a situation oh yes for a thing maybe a marriage maybe a home maybe you look at a loved one it seemed like they're going the completely opposite way remember when the fall took place in the garden there was no hope in sight but then God stepped down amen and when God stepped down he said behold I make a way back amen amen I will put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed what did he do he gave them a real hope an expectation where there wasn't any it looked like it was defeated and that's what looked like to be defeat but God came on the scene yes amen every time when it looks like where where as the prophet said where the message and the messenger are in a place of defeat that's when God steps on the scene that's the same way that it is in your life same way in my life I want you to think of it here even as where we stand in this hour John being a type of the Bride John there in Revelations 5 John he he looked and and the Bible said I I saw there was no one Worthy in in in heaven or in Earth there was there was great notable men Elijah Jeremiah many of the rest of them but none of them was worthy to take the book it looked like all hope was lost are you hearing me it spoke of the bleakness of condition of where it would be in the end time where it looks like there's no hope but at that moment there was a Voice Hallelujah that came and said John weep not for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof hallelujah what was it the opening of the word it was a restoring of the church to the original hope and that hope is the coming of the Lord the changing of these bodies the rapture all will be redeemed the Earth coming into full Redemption a millennium a future home a wedding supper no wonder it's the most Sublime act in the scriptures when he has taken the book amen now let me tell you this that same God through that right there of taking the book and he he stood there night after night revealing yes what was in the contents of those seals amen is that right that's why the prophet could point back to he said remember he said here he is standing the lamb he said we know that God is not three separate persons but it's the same almighty God is that right it was the angel of the Lord among the Church of the Living God as a matter of fact the prophet could say it in another place he said he he took the seals off himself off of himself and through that and through that it breathed a hope into the Church of the Living God it because you know why it breathe life anywhere where there's life when that comes in you can look at a situation and they can say there's no hope here no hope here no hope here as far as what you see as far as what you know but God's word has been raised back up as an absolute that God's word cannot fail because God can fail it's impossible Hallelujah he swore by himself he not only gave the promise but he swore by himself I will fulfill and keep the word he's made it certain as he's come Among Us Ruth what is that it's the certainty of God that he keeps his promises Hallelujah so what are you look at him don't look at yourself there ain't nothing certain about you or me look at the word the word is the evidence she wasn't looking at Ruth she was partner to the evidence the evidence the evidence why do I know that he's taking kindness in me look at the evidence look at how he's dealt with your life look at how he spoke to your heart even when you tried to get away he drew you back hall it's evidence Hall hallah blessed be the Lord who not left off kindness Mercy loving Mercy Mercy he breathed right back into the Church of the Living God a living reality where Paul Paul could even take it and say you and I in Ephesians 2 we we didn't even have brother Joy there was nothing of a promise of adoption of covenants there was no hope Paul said no Hope We Were Strangers of the Commonwealth of Israel but Christ himself oh my but now now in Christ Jesus ye who were far off are made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ that shows it's not of our works our righteousness our goodness do you realize even a character in your life to raise up and say it's nothing but the truth let me just say this to you this shouldn't stumble you it might be a person maybe their hair would be bobbed off and painted up and maybe it' be a man wearing short britches and all of a the word comes across his pathway and say that ain't nothing but the truth and God began to deal with that life you know what that is that's a character that God can begin to work on and bring to a full complete expression listen God knows what's buried beneath this dirt come on friends he's the one he knows yes Hees hallu we didn't have any hope no but God came amen are you with me God came that's why it's important to recognize him in his appearing as he's appearing among us this is why even as you look at everything where it looks like brother BR says a a thumbs down time even when they went into the fa fiery furnace they did not have any hope that they were going to be delivered but they knew one thing we are we know in whom we have believed we know we're going to be delivered from your hands right we ain't bowing I don't know what's going to happen in there but I sure ain't bwing I'm not caving to this world are you with me they went in there but when they got in there that's where God made himself known to them in a way like they never knew him before God even made the king that threw him in there testify there's a one among them he looked like the son of man it looks like the one I've heard them talk about it looks like it how do you know I see the evidence the fire is bending out from them it's not consuming [Applause] them he met him in the fire it was hope that was breathed in them then think about it they were walking brother Joey and fellowshipping in the midst of the fire you know what that means Brother Ray right in the the midst of a test or trial that we can have fellowship with God just as great if not greater that's what Paul said that I might know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings is that right sometimes it takes those little things because of this flesh that we're still in it takes those things to get us tendered up a little bit and back tendered up into his presence and right there that communion is so sweet anytime you ever invite him into the test or trial or where you're at he is still the same tree of life and when you place him in Troubled Waters he'll sweeten the Waters of Mara for you hallelujah how many know that's the truth hallelujah Witnesses all throughout this building oh my when it looked like the message was about defeated that's when God stepped in oh my when it looked like here the Lord Jesus they took him captive and remember it shook the the the disciples the Sheep take Smite the shepherd it'll scatter the Sheep when it looked like it was all defeated we thought he was the one here they took him in Pilot's Hall and he stood there he looked defeated but he wasn't defeated he knew exactly where he was standing and he said you could have no power over me right except it was given you see that's how you need to recognize your trials there's not a trial could come my way except God permitted it sometimes the boss does this or that and I know sometimes we have to go according to proper channels but sometimes even with when we go to proper channels are you hearing me now sometimes it's also to recognize that you know what God can be and is permitting that if everything is being steadfast in your walk with God God's permitting that also to temper you temper me to see how we're going to respond respond how we're going to react come on are we going to take out the picket line of a bad attitude come on Friends listen we're still flesh I'm preaching to I'm I'm including myself I can't hop down there and hop back up here at the same time but what are we going to do right is that right but notice when it was in that time of real weakness that's the time when the greatest Victory came he rose on that Easter morning when it looked like there was no hope for the Church of the Living God here he came and he came how does he bring hope he don't bring Hope by just some inflated thing he brings hope through the fulfilling of his word am because when his word is be and I know you say well that was Job chapter 19 but you got to remember there's a there's a revealing as he comes in the middle of the book and then as he comes at the end of the book and when it got to the end of it job was standing there and when remember job spoke where it looked like there was no hope for anything to be restored are you hearing me now he talked about a tree being uprooted I think it's job 17 where it's not just where the sap has went down and The Roots and it's going to come back up again he talked about that in job 20 job 19 but in job 17 he said I'm like a tree that's been uprooted where there ain't no hope there ain't going to be no blossoms coming on on this tree it's been uprooted and see there there there's things and situations that like that that can come into our life even now but job as he stood there and he all throughout his trial but then it broke and job said I know my redeemer liveth what did God do he revealed himself to job that I'm your Redeemer your Redeemer liveth he's alive what a glorious Revelation that's a revelation you realize the prophet ties it in that's a revelation that broke all of the holes and the Gloom around job's life because why when you realize that's a redeemer I belong to him amen it becomes such an great and Assurance of whose property I am amen oh my oh my brother Bram says you know you think about it he said sometimes he said in those great dark hours we're living in when all hope seemingly is gone it's Christ the solid rock we stand when all other grounds are sinking sand Lazarus had passed looked like no hope right but then he came amen and once again when they looked and said well I know in the last days he'll rise but but he announced right there who he was you see the evidence is right here among you I am the resurrection and Life The God Who promised the Resurrection The God Who will bring that forth I am the resurrection and life right then and there what was it there was a hope that was breathed into their heart and God went and told two women two women right to roll away the stone mhm these two I don't know how tall they were maybe they were This Tall maybe I don't know how tall they were I don't believe that they had shoulders like barn doors either they might have had to step around some big guys some big Pharisees excuse me excuse me what are you doing we're going to go rolling away the stone oh Lord we knew we knew they were Fanatics we knew ever since that they started following him and we kicked them out of our church oh we Lord even in a situation like this you think you all would have some sense but they walked over and they did their part showing their faith see God might be asking you to roll away the stone in your life some that stone might be repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall received the gift of the Holy Ghost that stone to be rolled away maybe might be to make something right that you need to make right are you with me roll away that stone because if you roll away that stone how do I roll it away not by your natural strength but faith in the word of God what the word is asking you to do will move that stone away and what seemed hopeless will be standing right before you Hallelujah your Victory your deliverance your healing the Holy Ghost roll away the stone you if they would have caught a peak of Lazarus cuz I'm sure when they rolled away the stone their breath probably was taken away brother Bram tells us his nose had already fallen in yeah corruption had already set in are you hearing me now and I I know just give me a few more minutes here if you you and I would have looked at the situation we would have said not just because oh you know he's been he's dead we could have said well I've seen God rais the dead before but when just to look at that situation and his nose has already fallen in corruption's already set in but God let you and I know that even though the corruption can set in but the word of God is still above corruption let me tell you that's the same way it is maybe in your life your family's life or a loved one's life it might looked as corrupt as corrupt could be but there's nothing beyond the hope of almighty God it's a God who breathes hope into your life Why by breathing his word in fulfillment and we see the evidence hey there's hope there's hope for me when the devil say oh you've tried you've done this you've done that but here he comes with his evidence and what do you do don't look at all of your failures you look at the evidence of God still speaking to your heart God dealing with your life and your heart raising up and saying yes Lord Lord more than anything look at that evidence because that evidence is God's sign it's God's seal of what God intends and desires to do in your life it's that evidence I don't know about you but there's been there's been I've had needs I've had situations sometimes of things that I'm praying about and man I don't see no movement on it maybe I just maybe if four or five of you come up here we'll just Fellowship maybe not everybody's been there but I think everybody has been sometimes we're praying for things and it don't seem like anything's going the right way as a matter of fact it seems things like it's going contrary but then all of a sudden God will come in through a service God will come in in a way maybe it's why you're driving to work maybe it's why you're listening to a message and all of a sudden just one little something will drop your way it's not even a something that says it's finished it's over or are this and this and this it might just be a little something of a l of secret whispered from him you know what that is that's an Evidence that's an Evidence what seems like there's no hope he restores hope hallelujah how does he do it by the breath of his word hallu brother brandham or the banks brother L we out there fishing I love this story I know we know it but R caught that fish little Sunfish Sometimes some of you know what fishermen know it as pan fish they're real flat and maybe they're maybe like about like that but they're not real big in body right but he caught that and he pulls out the hook trying to get it out you know how it is sometimes trying to get out a hook sometimes you get more than just loosening from the fish everything came out of that little fish all brother Brandon describes it its inance its insides had been ripped out and brother L said looks like you shot your last wad little fishy you see that's what it looked like he's only saying what he sees if you or I would have been there look brother Bram didn't keep watching that little fishy as a matter of fact when you read the account right right brother brandom and then would be like they're right here on this corner of the building and the way that that that is set up that little fishy it actually just kept on floating along and it went back into what looked like a little Cove it just kept on floating along let me tell you something right now it was out of the sight of the Prophet it was out of the sight of the of the other men in the boat but it wasn't out of God's sight it didn't matter if it was a little fish brother BR said there were cases on the list at home to be prayed for of children other things that were big cases Hallelujah and God moved down for that little fish when that was said and spoken that way and God said little fishy I give you back your life you know what it was here was a Son of God that was under the control of the mind of Christ let me tell you the mind of Christ has come back into the Church of the Living God it's God speaking over your life of things that you may not even see but God's word brings hope in your life the very insides was ripped out you tell me how that happened I'll tell you God God put it back together again brother brandom never told us that all of a sudden the insides just went right back in the fish he didn't even describe it in that way he said as soon as that was said that little fishy be the flap turned up and went off fishing you know what happened it looked like something Beyond Redemption it looked like it was beyond hope it was rote off it can never it can never happen but God moved down by his word and showed you and I there's nothing impossible nothing is impossible to them that believe when he's here he's in the building he's Among Us he's in your life he's the restorer of Hope in his word he the one that brought Naomi back to see hey wait a minute these handfuls of purpose and you you say it was Boaz blessed be the Lord that have not left off kindness to the living and to the dead it's God that restores hope it was gyrus he finally broke down and went to go get the master his daughter passed away and as he got back with Jesus he's almost there to his house I mean can you imagine he's seen he's not only heard Miracles but he's seen Miracles along the way back to his house remember the woman with the issue of blood she's healed on the way and he gets maybe to about I don't know maybe where the driveway's at out here I don't know maybe the door the Bible don't really give us a a certain measurement but he was n to his house enough to where one of his servants brother Jos could run out there and say hey don't don't trouble the master no more your daughter's dead he went to get the master when life was still in her body right right that there would be a turn of events and she would rise up be healed but this situation she's dead life is gone from the body but look what Jesus said the very next verse after that said gyrus don't even get a word out and the Lord Jesus turns to him and said fear not did I not say amen I would come to their house and thy daughter shall live again notice he referred him back to the word that he gave before the situ situation occurred and that's what God has done in this hour he didn't give us a new book he didn't give us a new Bible he took the seals off the word He restored the original promise he's given let me tell you if God's given you a promise in his word that promise might have seemed like it's drifted back into a Cove and your heart and things might have been ripped out but it is not Beyond Redemption [Applause] Hallelujah I looked in heaven saw no one I looked on Earth beneath the Earth saw no one I was looking for somebody is there somebody that can take the book is there somebody that can tie me back in behold John the lion of the tribe of Judah hallu hasth prevailed to take the book to loose the seals thereof Hall God's not giving you a new word he's restored the hope that belonged to the church in the original promise that he gave remember Paul Paul being the first church agent messenger he said be not moved away from the hope the church got moved away from the hope but God has restored us back to the hope and that is the rapture the change of these bodies who's done it by him by his by his appearing his appearing right here among us we love his appearing is that right we love his appearing it's not just here in church he's in the body he's in his bright body this is what he went to Calvary for this is what he paid the price for this is why the blood was shed that he might pay the price that he might come and live inside of his children [Applause] that's why the message come that's why the evidences this is why God night after night healings took place so that you and I could see situations that looked so far gone there's nothing beyond God I tell you right now I trust there's been May there be such a breath of the holy spirit that would Breathe Right into hope right into lives an expectation that no matter how much you've might have felt like and looked like defeat where it seemed like there was no hope but may the breath of almighty God breathe right down into your life and receive that evidence that there is indeed a hope for Revival there is indeed a real a real Living Hope how do I know look what you look look at the evidence look at the evidence look at the evidence H do you love him this morning I tell you don't turn loose to that evidence but let the evidence fully take a hold of you let the evidence let it let the evidence lead you to the person who has given the evidence right Rebecca and Rebecca's brother and mother they were fine with the gifts that elaser left good we're fine we're fine with the gifts but Rebecca said I'm going with you I know I don't I appreciate the gifts but I know there's more because the giver I want the giver I want to give her that that's what I want Rebecca got on the camel that she watered right and she rode all the way to her bridegroom amen I'm telling you he's still God you might feel your life is like a little fishy I love that story yeah yeah yeah squirrels came into existence where squirrels shouldn't even be you catch it the prophet it wasn't just squirrels being spoken to existence it didn't make any sense for squirrels coming out of a certain type of tree the prophet you and I may not know that if you don't hunt squirrels but the prophet put that out he said I'm going to make this real ridiculous right come on speak to the mountain 1959 Los Angeles he said I'm going to make this ridiculous there'll be a squirrel come out of there you know what anybody that would have been an avid squirrel Hunter said That's crazy cuz you know why the prophet said squirrels won't come out of there now I know this right now but you see what it was showing that even in lives and situations where it seemed like there was nothing that godliness that could come out but the spoken word of God it has been spoken over your life spoken over this generation and what does it do it brings forth a real son and daughter of God it delivers you from your first birth Hallelujah it delivers to you and I the real New Birth of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you love him hallelujah oh my there is a restored hope and one of these days this is why then when we're looking look this is why you ought to be looking for the coming of the Lord this is why look you say well well here I am in church when you come to church you ought to be looking for him to come you ought to expect him to come right where you're at when you get up in the morning you ought to be expecting his coming it may not be the Corporal coming but you're expecting his coming you see if you're in living in expectation for his coming then you're looking for his coming and you'll recognize his coming when he'll come and say hey don't go that way turn this way hey look at this hey you know what it is it's his coming we're a part of his coming it has restored a hope where Satan has wanted to take things and just literally rip it right out of the Church of the Living God could float right back in a Cove but let me tell you something you might have got buried beneath a complex you might have gotten buried beneath all of those things but God didn't forget about the Cove you're in God knows right where you're at you've always been a part of his word and God himself has sent his word to find you and seek you out he sent his word to heal them this word has come to bring healing to our lives what is it it's the Breath of God gyrus fear not right remember what I said to you I'm come your daughter shall live right he's I keep my word I keep my appointments I keep my my word you see you see what it's about you you see what the Lord Jesus was doing he took his Focus off of his fear and put it on the word because if you focus on yourself there's fear are you hearing me this birth this first birth what does it do it produce fear it produce unsettlers you and I back to the promise of the Living God is that right It Centers us right back that's why brother Ram says I learned he said as a young Christian he said as a young Christian he said there were times he said the devil could beat me all around the stump on my feelings he said finally he said I come to a place to recognize I have met God's requirements by his word and I'm standing right there am and he goes into the house and when he goes into the house there's laughter he said se's not dead she sleepeth the Bible said those who were in the house they turn from mourning I don't know I've been to a funeral here in the states of course I ain't been everywhere but I ain't never heard mourning like I did when I that man got shot in front of us in Honduras and people started Gathering and wailing and the mour and I've never experienced that maybe they do some of that in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica and other countries maybe in Africa I but I've never experienced it here but that morning then when he said that she's only sleeping they laughed him to scorn that's so good so you know what Jesus did Jesus didn't sit down and say here I'm going to convince you nope he just simply said get out sir get out yes sir what was he doing he was putting anything out that was Rising its head against the word coming in fulfillment that's what you've got to do in your life you've got to go right over to the door and the good man of the house faith will open the door and say get out get out you're not welcome here hope nobody's outside be me news anchor out there but you understand what I'm saying sometimes we let too many laughters stay in our mind we let too many scorners stay in our mind we receive the promise of God and then we walk out of here with a promise of God in our heart we begin to water and then all of a sudden the enemy wants to raise up and mockery and laughter and what's he trying to do he's trying to knock the confidence out of your life that God has put in your life in a service put them out that's what you got to do you got to put them out right how do I put them out sometimes you got to break the associations you're around you can't expect you can't expect Faith to build and accumulate if you're fellowshipping with people who don't believe it that's how sicknesses return come on friends God can deliver you of bitterness and grudges and resentment and all sorts of things in this service physical conditions but you get around a bunch of unbelievers that don't believe it it'll come right back come on you saying I should quit my job that's not what I said at all I'm telling you don't be a partaker of them you don't got to fit in with them you weren't meant to be a part of this world you are a part of God before the foundation of the world you can try to fit into the world now as soon as the next another person comes along they'll dump you and kick you to the curve cuz they don't care about you but there's one who cared so much for you that he left the portals of glory and he shed his blood and he sent back the Holy Ghost and is knocked Faithfully on your [Applause] heart that's right he Peter James and John Glory faith hope charity yeah Jesus you think we need a crowd nope all I need is faith hope charity wherever two or three AG greed Jesus don't need a crowd to do anything he only needs to surrender there's only a surrender he took a little lad's lunch and multiplied it am he can take what little faith you have the brother the prophet said the little faith you had to bring you to the house of God he said you put her in his hands and watch what he'll do with it and he spoke to her Tabitha he spoke to her Arise My Daughter arise and he took the maiden by the hand and she arose and you know the prophet he would preach that same text many times but when he preached the first time proving his word in 1964 he said this text has a spiritual application of the Bride of Jesus Christ in this last days when he was on his way it looked like all hope was gone but when he comes in the room my my my my my that's where hope is restored let's bow our heads let's bow our heads Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you are so mindful lord of the needs Lord in our lives Lord you know Lord even the situations that may be that we are standing in or that would be before us Lord even that which Lord we would have come out of you know every condition you know every even every spiritual situation you you know Lord All
