highest amen i tell you we just don't feel that way that's a reality amen it becomes more real each and every passing day amen we just thank god for his mercy in this hour we're just thankful amen to be a part of the very redeeming work of almighty god amen it becomes more as i said more and more precious to us to see that god has everything provided you know when you think of it when god let him out of egypt uh they didn't they didn't have to think will i have clothes sufficient will my shoes hold out they didn't that was not even the concern the concern here they had cried to god for deliverance that was the one focus they weren't focused on anything else and everything that was within the promise god unfolded their clothes the bible says their clothes did not wear out their shoes didn't wear out you tell me what clothing or shoe manufacturer makes something like that now you know what i'm saying i mean you go to buy things right now and i will tell you a five-year plan so i asked the guy i said why years ago i said why are you selling me a five-year plan on this he said to tell you the truth sir he said everything's made out of plastic he said it it only lasts about five years anymore i mean my mom and dad had freezers and refrigerated from when i before i was born and it continued on through most of my life so now you know everything is man and making it better making it better man gets a hold of it and makes it cheaper that's the same way if it's just manhandling the word it does not produce the original product but when god when god takes a hold of his word oh my it'll produce the original product that'll stand the test of time amen oh my i'm glad god has everything provided amen we just want to say we're just so thankful to the lord for his mercy this morning and allowing us to come together i want to i know it was already mentioned we want to welcome back brother brother joshua i certainly like to amen [Applause] amen we certainly have missed our brother and uh but i want to just read this from brother joshua he wanted to convey this to you may the lord jesus christ bless you i want to offer you thanksgivings i want to thank us thank you the saints of god for the love you showed for me and all the prayers and support you provided for me before during and after my surgery i also want to thank the lord jesus christ jehovah rafa and the great comforter because despite all the discouragement he heard your prayers and through his never-ending grace and mercy he provided me with comfort and faith during the whole time of my healing after the surgery it has been a challenging time dealing with pain and a prospect of many potential post surgical related complications but through it all god has been faithful even as i am still on this healing journey it's been also such a blessing to have you all watching after me in one way or another through your prayers phone calls and visits may the lord jesus christ bless you and return to you and hundredfold all that you have done for me bless you brother joshua amen amen i'm just so thankful to have amen each and every one of you i want to remind you as we get ready to turn into the word god bless you musicians thank you as we get ready to look into the word here this morning i want to remind you that this coming thursday we will not have service and the purpose as you seen on the calendar it's in light of the upcoming meetings that we have on saturday and sunday with brother darrell ward on saturday it will start at 6 00 and sunday at 11 and that the cancelling of the service on sunday well you know that's not an easy thing for me to do because i mean my we can have service every day of the week and just the the things that the word of the lord is just so rich and so precious to us but i know there's things sometimes that maybe that you have to attend to and you're kind of accustomed to doing that on saturday but it'll give you an opportunity if it's able to to kind of get those things out of the way so we can just have a time just to really focus in on these on these services and for brother daryl being here with us and like it is in any time of our life and i think we've said this more and more even this past year at least to me it always is something that we look at it and that is the lord willing so we i want you just to be in prayer for the services here saturday at 6 00 and sunday at 11 and let's just come just expecting just to receive from god amen brother brother daryl has just to me just i really appreciate brother darrell's ministry and we're we're expecting to hear from god and you know god has different gifts within the body god doesn't want all of us to be the same every gift it works different and just like what i mentioned before even like with brother daryl brother daryl's ministry is such a a ministry that works to so build faith and there's just so many things and god has used our brother in such a tremendous way i've witnessed it working with him with the young people uh also you know within other times and prayer lines and things and how that god is so moved in such a very special way and so we just want to just come with a real a real expectation will you be in prayer for that amen and just really work you know anything we do you know we're living in we're living in an age and whether we recognize it or not we can look at it and say well this age and these things are not affecting me the spirits of this age are this they are are the spirits remember brother bram says it comes with it's a soft easy living nervous tensions and that drawn to material things and all those things those are pressures that want to come our way and and probably every one of us because even after you've been filled with the spirit of god you still deal with soft easy living none of us wants to push a little bit or move a little bit or sacrifice a little bit but i can tell you this that every sacrifice that we make for the things of god uh well it won't be something years from now you'll have out this to the side of the curb waiting for the trash man to come on bulk day but everything you sacrifice that you really put in i tell you what it's eternal amen there's there's dividends that we reap from that amen in the prince of god so i just want to encourage you in that uh also remember the young people this coming friday evening uh there at our home we'll have the youth meeting and i had to fit it in there because lord willing i will be gone for a few days ministering in the middle of that of that next week so and but i'll be back here for that thursday service but i have to try to fit all that in and i didn't want to come back and you know preach somewhere else preach your thursday and then have a youth meeting friday and then have sunday service so i just have to try to i know my limitations so we just look to the lord well happy to be here amen how many just expecting amen to receive something from the lord this morning amen let's just go to him on a word of prayer and we'll just as we prepare to look into the word here this morning heavenly father lord we are just so thankful to be able lord to come together once again in the precious name of our lord jesus christ lord we believe that god even as we are gathered here lord you said that you would be in our midst and lord we sense your presence here knowing that god that the angels of god have taken their position lord around this building lord and father we ask that you lord will now come and just lord move aside oh god the man part lord and that you would speak to us lord and that god our ears our hearts would be inclined to hear from you lord we just lay aside all of the cares and frustrations and worries and all of those things we place them o god before you and lord for every need that's upon the hearts of your children lord we just invite you that you will just come in a very personal way father this morning may you lord just have your way in the name of jesus christ amen amen second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14. remember brothers i'll let you know when i when i need this i have some slide second corinthians 5 14. for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead that he died for all that they which live should not should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again so paul is writing not a physical death but he's writing that where we were dead spiritually so he died that now he might come back and there would be a resurrection in our life of that seed of his own life that he sowed there remember as he revealed himself to john on the isle of patmos i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore is that right in the book of ephesians you were dead in sin and trespasses but now hath he quickened is that right so now verse 16 second corinthians 5 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you and christ's dead be ye reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him amen may god bless you and bless the being of the word as you're being seated i just going to continue to under that thought of you have a voice but i want to be very specific in examining this this morning of the living voice of god the living voice of god and the scriptures that we have have read from here this morning when we see there's a great responsibility that is given to us as believers and we recognize that when we as look here in the scripture that our lives when this when the revelation of jesus christ has really struck our hearts it's no longer us living our lives unto ourselves but it's unto him now who died and rose again and we we no longer paul wrote here we read from this in the scripture we no longer know christ in the flesh now paul is dealing with those and speaking to those where just some years prior to that there were those remember who walked when has god walked and was present there in the body of jesus christ and paul is declaring that right now we know no man after the flesh paul is declaring he came he paid the price and he ascended back on high now we know him as they knew him how did they know him they knew him as he revealed himself in the word amen is that right is so this is how they knew when he walked on the road to emmaus he didn't they their eyes were withheld that they should not know him so what did he do he took the word and he began to reveal the things the bible said concerning himself the events the modern events that were taking place christ himself begin to take the scriptures that was one time prophecy that had already been revealed that had already come flesh and were fulfilled now he's declaring that has been fulfilled so how did then how did they know him how do you and i know him we know him as he reveals himself in his word by his presence in this hour now that's the same way then with every son and daughter of god paul brings this right down i'm just trying to lay some of this for a little bit of a foundation of where i'm going to move here this morning it's the same way with every son and daughter of god that is baptized into christ we become a new creation of almighty god and all things the bible has said of the world are passed away there's a new man paul would write over that over and over there's a new man on the inside you see what has happened is there has been the inside man has been transformed or we could say quickened or made alive and now the earthly tabernacle that we walk in this earthly temple reflects an inward work that has taken place so now this only becomes the visible part that expresses there has been a new creation take place on the inside so this is where paul now we can bring the scripture even to our own self you no longer know no man after the flesh even in our own lives though we have our identity of our family trees or whatever nationality we are a part of but yet we recognize by the grace of god that we are sons and daughters of god so we are not known by the old life that we live but we are known now by the life of christ that has come to you and i and has made us new creatures so that we are a new creation in the same old temple and the things that this old temple used to reflect it no longer reflects why there's a new man on the inside is that right it's like you walk by you know you walk my house wow why are they changing the shutter colors they're going you know the pink and lime green and then leaving off the mob what's going on and sometimes you look and say no these it ain't the same person who's living there there there's there's a different person living there so the person on the inside who's living there it begins to reflect itself on the outside amen so it's a sovereign work of grace this is the work of god where god himself reconciles us to himself by jesus christ and god god became kin folks our kinsmen becoming one of us made in the likeness of sinful flesh that he might suffer and pay the ransom i want you just to listen to these points through the act of reconciliation that began in christ now i want you to catch this i the act of reconciliation that began in christ god dwelling in christ he's now continuing on that same work in redeemed subjects that is the lamb of god preserving his rights upon this earth hallelujah this is the continuation we are witnesses of him so now i want you to look at the orders we'll look at this here a little bit and just i'm just giving a highlight of points of these things of where i want to go i want you to notice the order that the reconciliation that was manifested that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself and he is the word he was reconciling drawing there the world unto himself then through jesus christ and you see he is the word we are reconciled unto god by being baptized into the body of jesus christ by one spirit we receive the word of reconciliation remember we are reconciled and through that reconciliation then we receive the word of reconciliation and so then the word of reconciliation is the is the revelation of jesus christ to us personally that's what the new birth is are you hearing me now a person can say i know who jesus is he has revealed himself to me he is the son of god nobody can dispute what you've said is that right but does your life your actions your character match and reflect him to be the same that's the litmus test right there it's not just somebody who says i believe that jesus christ the son of god to say that then we even in that right there then now you are responsible to receive that same life inside of you to repent of your sins to be cleansed and to be born again of the spirit of god because you are declaring that he has made a way that i no longer have to be a servant of sin i can become now an expressed son and daughter of god is that right it takes away excuses so the word of reconciliation now moving in our life it is declared by the seal of the living god the token that we are covenant-born sons and daughters of god we are ambassadors of christ is that right with the seal the seal of the living god you know a seal like we we have you know sometimes you have to have things notarized and when they put the seal up on something there's papers you can't just take anywhere and have anything done they want it notarized is that right there's some different ones different sisters are setting here they are notaries and they have a special machine it doesn't matter if they have the qualifications it's not just their signature they have to put that that paper when they put that seal it presses itself into that paper that paper that was once just blank like that now takes on the impression of that seal and you know how it is when you feel it like that you feel it on the back side you feel it on the front side that's what the seal of the holy ghost does they're coming and going you are sealed into christ you are a reflection of god wherein your life was like a blank slate but it's come into the very press of the holy spirit and god has pressed his seal his image upon your life that's the seal of the living god it's god living his life through us that's the identification of what a real believer is and i want to just drop this this reconciliation that begins in our life with where the deposit of the word of reconciliation the holy ghost that reconciliation just doesn't stop here in this body amen reckons being reconciled back home amen soon and very soon in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there's to come a completion of this reconciliation to where our soul that has been redeemed then we receive that theory then the glorified body and here we come together a full reconciliation coming to the wedding supper to the millennium to the future home are you with me this reconciliation the work that has started in you does not stop amen it's a work of reconciliation now i've mentioned those things and i want to read this quote here from what house will you build me preached in tucson here i want you to listen how brother branham places this he says i know that each one of you if you feel like i do am so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i just can't hardly stand it some experiences i just had up in the mountain just just to feel that once again that's something that when i was first saved was so glorious to my heart and we can come into a place and we can sit and we see it among us that we're drying now remember what brother brother bram is talking now to a group of people okay that have gathered there in arizona but they they did not have a church to go to i want let me just say drop this here for a moment brother branham never advised him to follow him out there as a matter of fact he said don't do it you're with me i've been in those areas and press gotten you know the trailer court i went into some of those places and talking with different ones that have been even a part of those things brother brown never desired that to come in that way but remember what brother branham is saying are you with me what brother branham is seeing going on here he's seeing where people are not on sundays they're not going anywhere and their kids are out riding bicycles on sunday they're going about other things and brother brahma is looking and say wait a minute here what's he saying it is a burden on his heart because he knows there's got to be a place where the people are fed and this word is ministered we stay in fellowship let me just pause church doesn't save you but it keeps you in fellowship that's a direct quote you can't be as good outside of church as you can be in church that's another direct quote are you with me if the love of god's in your heart you can't wait until the church doors are open that's another quote there's another quote jesus always goes to church we can keep on going and going and going what brother branham is saying think of the title what house will you build me this is not just a title to speak a little something because brother perry comes up and preaches after brother branham takes this 30-some minutes if you haven't listened to this message what house will you build me go through it i've been through it over and over and over and over and over and brother branham as he's going into this he's finding amongst the people there where there's things that's going on and what is it it's not of the real message of the hour let me tell you something the message of the hour is not a movement of man it is the flow of almighty god from the throne of almighty god it's his life the love of god that moves down into our hearts so let me just read this here he says we come into a place and we can sit see it among us that we're drying as we sit here in the desert i get among my brethren they talk with me i talk with them also in a little way of watching feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong what's going on i begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit now everybody knows what recline recline is where you start just kind of relaxing and just kind of resting and there's no more pressing that's going on recounting like we got it made in the shade everything is peachy but that that's not that's not true that's a lie of the devil you're in a constant warfare until you cross onto the other side there's a battle that's going on let me just say this this is why you need the live ministry of the word to discern that spirit that would want to try to hinder you god's not against you he wants your life to be a channel that reflects him he wants everything for you he wants it more for you than you want it for yourself i'm not just talking about the holy ghost i am talking about the holy ghost but i'm talking about a real a victorious life each and every day and every moment of our life god's desire is greater than our desire but we've got to be able to identify that's true i'm reclining a little bit now let's look i feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it become too natural a thing to us see any time listen listen listen these are things as far as with stealing this humanity guess what things can become common to us very quickly is that right become very common church everything everything around can become very common that's dangerous and we know that we need it is not what i'm not going to let it come down and i'm not going to let it become god no no it takes god staying in his fellowship it takes god in his presence he's the one that moves in our life that keeps the freshness about our life some of you probably been walking out on the grass at different times you know in the past couple weeks my goodness i tell you we've had some nice dues of the morning it's been wet you know what i mean it's i mean it's been thick any thicker you'd see fish swimming in the yard i mean it's been thick out there cushions you've got outside on your lawn footage furniture good luck maybe by evening time you'll be able to set on them it's thick that's happened because we know the humidity that was in the air is that right listen let me tell you what the do represents god never promised jacob he said oh i'll this is to be part of the covenant with you i'll give you all kinds of rain and thunderstorms and whatever more god said i'll give you the dew from heaven anybody hear the dew coming no it's a silent coming are you with me it's a secret coming but the dude does something in the secret coming that all the rain the rain is wonderful the rain can do but the dew itself is something so so simple so secretive but when you go out at a certain time of the day then you can walk back on the grass where is the duet the do that came it comes from god it goes back to god it's so simple of how it happens now notice how brother brown would say this he says we must worship in the spirit where the spirit of god not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself my my mind now i want to just breaking into this and dealing from our test and that and that point we'll see where we get to this morning but i want to re take us back into a place to recall how moses himself hear israel coming out of egypt and moses receives from the lord the ten commandments he's called by god to enter up into the mountain and god as he enters into the cloud that's upon the mountain he enters into the presence of god and god there gives to him the ten commandments or as we would know it was the very inscription of god's own nature but i want you to remember it was not inscripted upon soft tablets it was on stony tablets god was showing that was the condition that was present in the lives of every person our lives were stony tablets there had to come something about that would change our lives from a stony condition because you see if it's just written in stone you can't move stone around but when it's written in the heart then the heart itself will pulsate that to the rest of the body so moses as he receives the word of god and it was glorious paul writes of it it was glorious of what was received i want you to remember when moses came forth from the presence of god the second time when he came forth the second time he had a veil on god's speaking what he was going to do in this day he had a veil on is that right now god came forth with the veil and his face shown with the glory of god is that right that was a scripture they the all of israel could see his face was shining with the glory of god this wasn't hollywood production you know with lights coming on behind the lights flashing ever no it was a glow about his life that was the shekinah glory of almighty god why because the word which is god had been given to moses and the shekinah glory accompanied moses to bring the word to the people are you hearing me now he came down if we could say it like this to have his picture taken with them the shekinah glory accompanied the word and moses as he had the word it was veiled but after he gave the word out moses look look when god give him the word and he comes back down among the people moses then begins to express to interpret the writings that god had given him because he's one who is inclined with god moses was speaking as god because he had the revelation from god for the people he was veiled but after the word was given out then moses was no longer veiled the veil was taken off because then that word would be placed behind the veil in the tabernacle it would be placed under badger skins now let me just refer to this here just a moment every one of us here we live in a three-room house just hold on a moment benjamin i want to read these scriptures here in exodus 25 21 thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that i shall give thee so this was not going to be a testimony that moses makes up but what god was going to put into the ark what he said what goes in the ark is the testimony i'm going to give you i'm going to give you a testimony and it will be the testimony and then it goes on in verse 22 and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony so now when the the the testimony is placed in the ark then the ark becomes known as the ark of the testimony these are all the things which i've given thee in commandment unto the children of israel now let me just let me just work with this here just a moment here and i want to just deal with this can you can you change that benjamin please okay i'm doing i just i wanted to do this because sometimes these things what i just read can seem so vague in our minds we need something more than just we need something greater than simon browning to make it plain i can't make it plain when i interested in the spirit of god to come and reveal it quicken it make it alive make it clear god laid this out of this tabernacle this is the vision that he gave to moses of this tabernacle this was a type of man god's desire has always been to dwell inside of man god's place of rest rest is you know you come into your house you don't rest in the kitchen you rest a little bit in the parlor or the living room family room whatever you want to call it but you rest in the bedroom it's a place of rest where you receive real rest and refreshment there's nice things you know in the living room you can sit down in your recliner and my you know you can just kind of rest in there but there's the real place of rest is is that part of the bedroom that's where you receive refreshment is that right when you you know like how many times you know you you go by nowadays oh you'd only eat six hours of sleep uh give it a month oh you need seven and a half give it a year oh you need nine hours give it another six months oh you only need five hours it just depends on what flavor of the month is going on is that right i mean but your body lets you know whether you need more rest or not is that right so the rest itself how this was a type of man of how that when you come you know when you look here uh uh uh of the tabernacle god would dwell in and i want to just maybe to draw here the attention here just for a moment as we look at it these are the parts right here of the badger skins the badger skins well everybody knows what a badger is anyone like a badger for a pet no why they're mean that was once you that was once me what happened you're not seeing a live badger up there but it's the skin that was on that badger a new creation in the same old temple [Applause] now i want to just move here into this place this is now just a snapshot of that of three courts because you and i are made as a three-room house body spirit and soul and you find it here in the outer court let me just let me just refer to it in this way this is body out here right in here this is spirit these are all you remember if you look in in the uh the previous drawing the previous one you have if you have the five uh posts there conscience memory affections reasoning right this is the spirit realm you got body and spirit but you see this inner realm right here that's the soul this is the place that god dwells the other place the spirit and the body only reflect what's going on in the soul [Applause] this is why the new birth is more than a work of the body or the spirit the new birth is the work and the soul that's what being born again is you see you can come into a body of believers right here and you can have fellowship with the body of believers your spirit can even be moved and it's inclined with wow these are this is good i i really enjoy this but it's got to go deeper to where it comes into a change on the inside and remember the scriptures that we read the testimony that i give thee put into the ark and the ark right here i'm sorry for drawing this on up but the ark right here that is the type of the human heart place this room right here of the of of the innermost part the smallest room but when god is dwelling there it has the impact an effect on every other part of our life this is why the change has got to go deeper than just the body we can conform to things but that'll never work even in our spirit we can fellowship around the good things of god and even you know like the word and things but it's got to go deeper it must come to a place on the inside to where now it's no longer just fellowshipping around the word but now is the word living itself in and through our lives that's god's purpose oh my everybody clear amen ben go ahead switch off please now in the in this ark where this remember the testimony i give you who gave you your testimony but samuel no no this testimony is just like it was given to moses it's a testimony that god gives you personally it's your personal testimony and god places the personal testimony in the ark in our heart amen see god provided a place for himself he's jehovah's ira he's jehovah gyra he provided the place you could right here when you deal with the soul even you can preach all seven compound redemptive names of jehovah he is jehovah rapha we needed healing in our soul we were sick we didn't need our own righteousness we needed his righteousness but this testimony it would be placed in the ark that was behind the inner veil which is seen there on the picture it is the place let me just say this this was a place where when there was a discrepancy that arose a dispute on who was it that god chose to stand in the office of the levite and priests this was the place where god had the rods brought in and aaron's rod which was a dried stick but it was off of an almond tree and it came into this place the most holy place and inside of there in a 24-hour period of time it budded it blossomed and it bore almonds it went through the whole cycle it's the same thing with turning the water into wine it went through the whole cycle is that right squirrels coming into existence went through the whole cycle same thing in your life it went through the whole cycle and aaron's rod remember was god declaring this is whom i've chosen and it was god himself giving an absolute that would dissolve every doubt should there ever arise a question come back to the sacred sands of my grace where i have confirmed my self to you that's what the testimony does it's also the place that when the manna fell in the wilderness remember god provided what they had needed to eat the manner that fail they were to go out and gather that up but remember they were only together what they would eat don't keep none of that manna up you keep it up it'll canker where did the manna come from it came from god right but you look and say well that come from god how can that canker because there is an ordained place for the manna to come where it will never canker this is why god had them to take an omer and fill the omer with the original manna that fell on the first day let me type going back to the day of pentecost the same original holy ghost that same holy ghost when it comes into the soul and brings a change it'll never canker but if it's only on the flesh it'll canker only a matter of time and it's out again if it comes into the spirit it may not go out there but it'll complain and find fault here and this and that and whatever more but you see what does it it can't curse but if the holy ghost ever comes down to the inside there is no cankering that experience is just as fresh as the moment that it was received [Applause] why because it's the testimony of god himself therefore the ark became the ark of the testimony because it held the testimony and our life becomes the habitation of god because the testimony of jesus christ comes into our life this is where as we move from the type to the anatype and just moving over some scriptures god's desire as we were looking at that the tabernacle there god's desire was to have a place to dwell that was only these were only a type where god would catch moses up and moses would catch the heavenly patterns he would catch how could how could how could anybody know how to prepare god a place to dwell in but god would catch moses up and god's mercy his desire to dwell among his people was so great that he knew it must be that where his pattern must now come from the heavenly and be spoken upon the earth and it now become fruition and so god had one reserve he that happened here that could be caught up there in that cloud and received the pattern from almighty god in that pattern to be communicated onto this earth so then what was in heaven could now be reflected upon earth see the rest of the nations could look at that tabernacle i showed you and say what is that what a mess who would put badger skins up over the top of a tabernacle like that where all these colors and what are all these things and whatever more but it doesn't it had no meaning for them you see they had their own tabernacles they have their own temples but in those tabernacles and temples which are inspired by demons come on now paul brought it right on down there's doctrines of devils are you with me he called them also in the book of revelation synagogue of satan but what we find is they could look at this tabernacle and say what in the world is that but it was god's mystery what god's desire was he gave the pattern to moses moses carried that pattern out men that fulfilled that pattern let me just tell you something why it's important to follow the pattern god will not recognize anything that's not his word are you hearing me i'm talking about the new birth god will not recognize anything that's not according to his word but every time that god comes god is recognizing this is the original pattern there's a lot of saying a lot of things to be spoke there it shows that in every facet of our life if you want god to be present you want god then follow the pattern of god hallelujah so here here we find this this rest the rest of man and notice of how that solomon himself solomon would follow the same pattern is that right he followed the same pattern how god came on the scene the pillar of fire comes down descends and it fills the tabernacle it goes clear back there where did the pillar fire stop in solomon's temple not not in the holy place not not in the inner outer court not in the holy place it went to the innermost part amen that's where the holy ghost is meant to go you see now when we move from the type to the anatype oh my my my my mind the word itself now the word is made flesh and dwelt among us we're coming to to jesus christ the bible would record we beheld him the only begotten of the father he declared or as john would write it he revealed he revealed god in so much in such completeness till it was god in the flesh is that right notice his ministry was not a writing ministry jesus never came down to write are you with me he did not come down and now he's going to write a bunch of commandments and it's not a writing ministry this is the ministry of revealing what has been written amen that's why he came in his fullness is to reveal the writing amen revealing in what not in seminars not in teaching but reveal it by expressing by god's very mind concerning his word was now expressed through the body of jesus christ psalms 40 verse 6 sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened or loosed burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required you see god's desire was for fellowship that would be complete not just things that's covered over but to where there's an absolute transformation on the inside then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me where it's root this is where i come see jesus he came when it was time for that part of the drama to be fulfilled probably everybody in here has seen a drama right you've seen it some of you are with me this morning everybody's seen a drama at some point in time you do not come out on stage until it's time for your part in the drama the script was written before the foundation of the world all of the villains that was in there and all those things all of those parts were already wrote there and the holy spirit is on the scene to give the inspiration that those that are standing back there they begin to receive inspiration that now they're on the scene and it's time for this part to be acted out and you know what it's not the people doing the acting it's god acting through man same god all the time just changing his mask i look out here i see a masked god mass woo you having a good time i am then said i know i come in the volume of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will oh my god yay thy law is within my heart this was different yes there had been delight in the law but now where is this the light coming from this delight is not just coming from oh i enjoy the word i enjoy it but now it's an inward delight because look thy law is within my heart this was a prophecy concerning the lord jesus what was it the testimony i have preached now notice what this testimony did the testimony within the innermost part i have preached righteousness in the great congregation how many knows you don't have to be a preacher to preach your life preaches sermons your life preaches sermons is that right ah i have not refrained my lips oh lord thou know see what see what the coming into expression does it does not hold back it's a releasing i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the great congregation what is it the lord jesus is declaring this is prophetic that the life where the testimony is placed is no longer a life that's sealed up and silenced but it is a life that the seals have been taken off of it it's a life where the voice has been released through and in the lie so it's not us that speaker but the blood speaketh better things you see the seals the taking of the book that's a mere reflection of what god has done in your life to take the seals off of your life to remove the hindrances and the thoughts and the thinking and creeds and dogmas but now the breaking the seals back is to reveal as a son and daughter of god baptized in the holy ghost under the blood now stands as a spokesman for the living god [Applause] hallelujah oh my jesus let me just say it here as the prophet could say it jesus is our moses of today god was veiled in christ manifesting himself his word through that body in john 14 9. look at he said to philip remember they asked him show us the father he said have i been so long with you yet thou hast not known me philip he that hath seen me had seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works it's not me making myself no there's something behind me what is it the testimony believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake you see that's the same testimony in our lives that a person says ah i can't believe i can't you you the bride of jesus christ the scripture applies because we have a greater witness well i can show you here i can take you here and i can take you there somebody in the spirit realm can do that though i understand all mistress and have not the love of god god can speak in tongues and everything else without the love of god the testimony of jesus christ is nothing but a rattling noise are you hearing me faith to move mountains nothing but a rattling noise if it doesn't have the testimony on the inside [Applause] is that right hey listen friends this is why this world and everyone else don't take it personal when you talk about being a christian and they look at you and they and they first of all look and think let me see they've seen so much hypocrisy listen they've seen gifts this there's been many people have seen gifts work they've seen people go and pray for people and they come up out of hospitals and it ends up being nothing but a hypocrite i'm gonna preach it straight you know why that is because they never got born again come on now let's get right down to the rubber of the boat we're talking about the testimony of jesus christ then whether or not you ever pray for anybody whether you ever speak with tongues whether you ever move a mountain it's the testimony of jesus christ in your life that is identified in the word and your life is identified as a christian not because of who you associate with or what church you come to but you're identified by the presence of jesus christ in your life whoa if you can't believe me believe the works right believe the works they they testify me walking right in the word and jesus said it like this in john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also greater works means more more right you take one grain of wheat put it in the ground what comes up multiple grains how many ever planted corn before remember my daddy used to get you know he'd get the corn from the seed catalogs he'd take one little corn dad would separate him all have him on the kitchen table he's got his sweet corn here he's super white right here brother oh he has the beans over here they all came in brown paper bags from the seed catalog company but he knew if i plant one of them seeds one of them little seeds of corn what's going to come out as a whole ear you see god was bottled up in one man god became flesh the testimony of god was placed in one earthen vessel but now that the life has been offered up and the life that was within there the blood paid the ransom and now the holy spirit comes back to do what raise up a mini-membered body not one kernel but a whole cob [Music] if i didn't have to preach i'd run man i i i mean i just feel like turning loose oh that ain't just here that's at home too glory be to god oh my you see here's what jesus was saying let me just put it in here in my paraphrasing my words i will send back the holy ghost the living word of god and i will continue to do the same works through your mortal body being with you and in you until the end of the age you will be identified by my presence abiding in your life i will declare myself alive by my life being lived through your life it will be the testimony of jesus christ that will reflect through you making your testimony to bear witness of the scene i want you to consider this this is pretty simple everybody remember john dillinger i mean he's a he's a lightweight compared to nowadays hate to say it like that but you know what i'm saying i mean you know but if i said simple if i said i had the spirit of john dillinger in me what would you expect me to do not go around and serve tea and biscuits you would expect me to be packing some guns right gangster you'd expect me to be robbing some banks matter of fact you'd be saying but watch your eyes around that boy because that guy man i'll tell you what he won't just rob your blind he'll come right to your face right the owner man i'm tell you what you think now it's it's funny if they if they you know and what they have you walk into the bank with now brother let me tell you something right now if anybody giant dillinger's coming in oh lock the vault everybody lock it look why because the spirit of john dillinger is present in my life so what are they doing they're expecting the works of john dillinger to be done are you with me come on now y'all you all have talked a little bit and i don't care what side of the railroad tracks you come from everybody knows a statement apples don't fall far from the tree is that right yes sir buddy now notice what if i said i was beethoven or mozart what would you expect you'd expect me to really enjoy classical music and write it and compose it if i had that spirit in me let's bring it down what if i said that i'm a christian amen and i've got the spirit of jesus christ living within me what would you expect the same things that he did that i would do not me to do with it come on amen it wasn't the spirit oh me trying to act like john dillinger no the spirit was within me and now my body just reflects what's inside the ark itself it spoke of an inward work that would emanate throughout all of that life let me just try to just wind this down here the scripture says in hebrews 10 14. everybody okay now i haven't parachuted yet i'm on the i click click i'm on the line you heard the click right brother joy click click on the link for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he has said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them notice i will put them there i will write them there what is this the testimony that i give thee yes and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more you know you and you you and i can walk around and say uh you know we could remember certain things that were done but even the things that were done in the body it haunts us in the fence in the sense of us oh god we no our sins are forgiven the debt is settled but it's still that part that oh my that this was done but remember when god has moved to the innermost place and the testimony is there it's not the same old person there is a new creation let me just let's just try to give it a simple example brother drake there's no doubt where you where you and sister rebecca moved somebody else lived in that house before right okay so whoever lived there when you moved in the neighborhood probably this happened to some of you you can you can move into a house and it wasn't your house but you move into it but there was a reputation of the people who lived there before you lived there maybe they were the kind of people that put their recycle bin out on windy days and the wind just blew the recycle all over the place is that right and you get people that kind of just dropping hints what it is they're reminiscing about somebody who used to live there and that's what that person would do but you're not that person same old house but there's a new person on the inside there's a new person that says windy day i'll get up early and put the trash out i know that one very deep and very spiritual but it might help somebody might help you with your neighbors a little bit there you understand what i'm saying what makes the difference people can talk about oh my the neighbor who used to live there they can talk about your life there's people that remember things you used to do you remember but what you know on the inside that same person don't live here no more i don't have the same appetite and the same desire that i used to have my desire is to please jesus christ is to live for him the guy that used to set his recycle bin out like that the guy that used to run around the guy that used to drink the guy that used to do all that that guy don't live here no more there's a new man on the inside and a church didn't make you a new man it's god himself that makes you a new man and a new woman i will write my laws upon your heart i will put my laws into your mind and when that takes place your sins and iniquities i remember no more devil wants to accuse you god said who are you talking about well you know son no who are you talking about amen what do you mean who am i talking about you know as good as well samuel this or bill this or joey this or brian this you know goody well carlos this or you know greg this or richie that you know good as well oh i see your problem that's not the same guy on the inside you can do what you want to in front of him he's got my seal on him go ahead buy him a whole pallet full of sick cigarettes you won't touch him come on somebody do whatever you want to ain't going to bother him you know why there's a new man on the inside it's united with jesus christ let me just i want to really just drop this down the testimony of jesus christ works within our life to bring the reflection of his presence of his life you and i both can feel we can all fellowship on this point there's a there's people that sometimes you work with and you go into a job go into a home you don't know what you're going to find you don't know if you're going to find somebody that every other word out of their mouth is swear word or they're going to talk about how much they drank the night before or or what they did you know running around fornicating adultery and everything you don't know what they're going to talk about but you know sometimes tell you what it's refreshing when you hear somebody's got a clean mouth and they and they themselves they don't profess nothing right then again maybe they're they're professing some of what they of what they know and they can only reflect what has been made known to them you see the testimony of jesus christ it will produce a good clean moral life but just a good clean moral life is not the testimony of jesus christ are you hearing me it's a life the lord jesus we all agree he lived a good clean moral life the bible said he was tempted without sin but what made him god is because god dwelled inside of him when he walked about the confidence blind bartimaeus had the woman at the well on and on and on we could go their confidence was god was in christ so the testimony of jesus christ is when our life has been transformed from the inside out and we're no longer talking about the message amen we've become the message amen we are a reflection of the message of this hour our lives declare that our hearts have been turned you love him this morning where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin where remission of these you see it speaks of the the very depths within our life let's just close this is why that the testimony of jesus christ ben can you go back to that slide just a minute please buddy this is why the testimony of jesus christ i am closing this is why the testimony of jesus christ it's got to be more than just right out here it's got to be more than just on our spirit because in our spirit it we start thinking differently i shouldn't do this shouldn't do that shouldn't do this and that's all part of the journey are you with me that's all part of the testimony but the objective is that the testimony finds its place in our life that's where it comes down to the soul where it comes down to the change on the inside this is the place in here where the rod dissolves doubt this is the place in here where the manna never cankers it's the place of life it's the place that now his presence his presence now it emanates throughout all of the court so where is our influence from then our influence is to be lived from right here well i've marked this all up but this is where we're to live our life from not from what we're reading out there not from things well so and so treated me this they did no live from inside yes amen let the inside flow to the outside the testimony of jesus christ it is the spirit of prophecy what is prophecy divine inspiration preaching it's uttering what do our lives do whether you're a preacher such as the gift god's place in my life or you're called to be a witness and your life preaches a sermon amen let the world live in me dear lord show me myself within thy word show me myself and show me my savior and let let me just sing it now oh let the worldly in me just our voices let the world live in me jim lord oh show me myself within thy word o show me myself and show me my savior and let the world live and let the world oh let the world live in me i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want you love love to there's just no more love for i could never [Applause] the lord and i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor yes command oh i pledge allegiance to [Music] the lamb lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Applause] oh pure and holy [Music] real softly now i'll be [Music] oh sanctuary for you lord prepare me o lord prepare me to be a sanctuary o pure [Music] i will be a living oh sanctuary [Applause] [Music] for you amen hallelujah as our heads are bound here in his presence amen i wonder as we're in his presence here this morning he's spoken so personally to our hearts i wonder if there would be one that would say lord i want that testimony in the innermost part of my being i want that to dwell lord i want my life it to be a real reflection of you maybe there's things the testimony of jesus christ is there but maybe there's things you've allowed to accumulate in your spirit maybe in your body but you say lord i i want a real renewing of the holy spirit lord a cleaning out maybe you've never surrendered your life to god but right now this morning is that where you recognize there's been a a man surrendered to god and god has come down to let you know this is not the work of a church it's the work of almighty god and that he himself will take your life and transform it as a trophy of his grace would there be one that would say god that's me this morning lord i want to give my life completely to you lord amen god bless your hands amen hallelujah let's just as we join together in prayer heavenly father lord we realize as we stand here that this testimony is not a testimony that any church or any man can give to us but lord it's ministered to us by the holy spirit but it's a work between you and your child lord to where that we stand as new creatures in christ jesus now lord i pray behind those hands you know the real request lord no doubt through this building there's many lives that they lord god have received that testimony of jesus christ in the innermost part of their being there there's been a change that's come about in their life more than just good morals which we thank you for that but it's a love affair between you and your people lord but maybe there's been a reclining of the spirit maybe there's things that's entered into that spirit got in the way but lord right now they would just like to ask for a renewing of the holy spirit would you just move down in a special way for their needs just as much as lord you would move down for that heart that would say lord i want that testimony in the very depths of my soul not just on my body where i'm trying to conform not just on my spirit where i know what's right and the word begins to yeah the word we're agreeing with the word but where it comes to the soul and now from the very inside outside to the outside it reflects the testimony of jesus christ just the simplicity lord that you gave to us in the example that the prophet would give us time and time again about john dillinger beethoven mozart on and on we could go and if the spirit of one of them would live inside of us we would do the works that they did but the spirit of jesus christ living inside of a child of god then we can lord say that this day this scripture is fulfilled that he would do the works he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also this day this scripture is fulfilled granted lord we pray may you continue to work in each of our lives lord may we lord as the dew falling upon the grass lord where it comes down in such secret such silence it descends o god upon lord the grass upon the plants upon the leaves and then it arises lord that that light begins to come upon that dew drop and that dew drop begins to move around until eventually the strength of the sun draws it back to where it come from granite lord may we live under the refreshment of the dew from heaven lord that our lives would be sweet peaceful gentle loving full of joy from the dew of heaven granite lord for that is your word to the firstborn of the covenant thank you for the dew we love you and we praise you now father in jesus name hmm let's sing that lord [Music] prepare me if you'd like to stand i

over again [Music] with you over and over again [Music] i love him better every day oh i love him better every day [Music] oh i love him better oh [Applause] are there tests are there trials are there temptations the prophet said you find something he said that there's a real temptation he said you overcome it a couple times and you watch a testimony bloomberg [Music] how do i overcome it by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony what is the word of our testimony he has become the high priest of his own word amen and what we are confessing is what he has declared we are amen glory be amen god i'm gonna say i'm a witness you see what happens then from the testimony on the inside it becomes a testimony blooming here a testimony blooming there a testimony blooming there why because it's his life that brings forth when you can say your testimony oh this is my testimony who gave you that testimony it's his testimony that come and has given a testimony to you and i and it's producing through you and i oh you know i feel like singing through many dangerous toes and snares we have already come our testimony isn't that we're always who my they were just always on the mountain no no no but god unless the valleys come to show the testimony is there and then what does it do it brings a forth the testimony of his goodness in our life you love him oh my my how precious he is to us yes amen amen could we just thank him let's just let's just take just a moment here and just to say thank you lord father thank you lord jesus i don't even feel like those words lord would
