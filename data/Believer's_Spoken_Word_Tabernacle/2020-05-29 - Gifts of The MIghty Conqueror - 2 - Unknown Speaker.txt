good to be in the house of the Lord so good to see each and every one of you and it's been certainly been nice over the over the time just being able to see you and it's not the same some of you have seen over video conference calls that we've had and you've had to look at my ugly face and you know but I've got to least see you then and but it's so nice to be able to see you in person and just we certainly love you and just really just appreciate you I can say by far but that wasn't indeed the hardest thing that for me that that I had during this time was not being able to see you all and so we're just we're here we're here tonight and those that are streaming is still at home we're gathered together around the word and we're just expecting just to receive something from the Lord that God would just speak to us in a personal way if you would let's open up in our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4 and we want to just begin there and read some verses of Scripture some things that we just kind of begin to look at again or begin to look at here last Thursday and starting into this in verse 4 of Ephesians 4 Paul would write by inspiration there is one body and one spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men I remember the scripture we looked at last week if Psalm 68 in in in in the prophecy that was spoken through David the scripture said he received against now here is in the mighty Conqueror as he's ascending back up now coming into position he is dispersing those gifts that he has received and he gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated so I want to as we look here in the scripture and just continuing to take that part on gifts of the mighty Conqueror I want to just continue our our scripture here of Ephesians and looking at verse 12 because what we've just read it expresses that of the gifts that he himself has given and remember these gifts the whole way that this would be portrayed is that when one had conquered another nation they would take that of the spoils they would take the riches and as they themselves were making their procession back into their homeland they were dispersing of gifts and valuable things and things that were that were spoils of the victory the things that they would release it was all declaring the victory that was already brought to those people and to think of it that the gifts that God has placed we in the church as well as every every member of the bride of Jesus Christ it is to display his victory now just let me just say it like this your life as we looking at that you may not have one of the five ministerial gifts that we just read and would focus upon here but to remember that in your life your life when you have received the Holy Ghost and God has done that work by the new birth your life is a trophy and a testament of his victory and he and this is where in your life it is now the life of the overcomer living through you and you are an overcomer he because it is his life that's living through you you see your life will preach many sermons that the these right here that I've read up that will never that will never reach or reach to different ones but a life that will preach a victory where a person can say you know maybe to a sister how was it that you how is it that you dress like this or how is it that you've let your hair grow and we know it's it's much deeper than that that reflects an inward work that has taken place but how is it and there is a life that can truly and genuinely be reflective of victory and the victory is the overcoming of our own will to wear that the will of God has set down upon the throne and he's reigning this is why the scripture would say that behold all things all things are passed away and behold all things have become new because it becomes a life that's under a new administration and it now is his victory that is being made manifest through our lives that's why Paul said no man that that that can call Jesus accursed no man can call him lord but by the holy ghost and see the Holy Ghost it gives an authority because you are a received of that victory in your life that you know that you have passed death unto life and it is his victory that has come and not just been announced but now his manifest through your life so every one of these the gifts they are gifts from the mighty Conqueror they are not gifts that have with any compromise at all these these gifts that we look at here in verse 12 it goes into the purpose of this ministry because there's a purpose for it and that purpose is for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we be that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love let me just just for tonight let me just take all of those scriptures and summarize it in this way that every it is the objective and should be the goal for every individual that hears the gospel that they themselves desire to receive of that Liberty from which they are being called to and when receiving that Liberty that life also that they would grow and mature as I looked throughout this a building and you can even you know looking at one another we we grow and we change and this is kind of something whether we want to or not you grow and change you either lose hair you got to dye your hair you got to do something here things change about your life you grow right but this is the this is the objective of what God would set forth even the ministry so that he himself is the tutor of his church and it's him working through these five ministerial offices so that the church might come into that expression and grow and mature this is all he is working that day I'll be honest with you right now if they're read these scriptures and this was left up to my flesh or your flesh or any other flesh to fulfill we would be in trouble but it is not up to any man to fulfill these scriptures it's only as God has vessels that are able to be yielded to him and it's God accomplishing and achieving his own world so then the Scriptures bring it in here ah as we look at here in the scriptures that it says in first Corinthians 12 27 now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps government's diversities of tongues you got to think when we look at this here we find in the scripture you find in in in in here within the scripture that here when the Ministry of the Son of Man has been opened up noticed the charge and commissioned in mark 16 is go you therefore into all the world you do not read in mark 16 the word pastor you do not worry read the word teacher you do not read the word evangelist but he says go you there forth which would be apostles are you with me because you see God does not give something unless there's a need for it if there wasn't churches that had already been established if there's not churches established there's no need for a pastor but once the church has been established then there's a need for a pastor and there's needs see all of these minister of gifts are based on the needs have God ministers to the needs of his body he is the husband of his church his church is his wife so he is the one to minister and to care for our needs and he has a way of doing that through each one of these offices now to think how that Paul would write and encourage um Timothy in this time he would write and speak to Timothy in first Timothy 4:14 neglect not the gift that is in thee it means do not be careless with it or to as go to put it aside if God gave a gift he intends for that gift to be used God does not decorate his house with things like they do it some restaurants and they put rakes on the wall and they're just rakes on the wall and nobody use them that's not how God puts gifts in the church they're not to be looked at and then looked at and says oh my in that a wonderful gift no the gift is there for God to use to minister to our needs so this is how God he's a God of purpose and here how Paul would write neglect not the gift that is in thee and I can say it like this I would you know I could preach on this one here tonight for a long time but to realize that within it every one of us has a part within this body every one of us just as I heard the prophets say here just the other day he said someone could say he said like you know a kid at a house and say well you know it ain't my job to bring in the wood that suze job she always brings in the wood he said but if you see there's wood needed to be brought in then you're a part of that then you go and gather the wood and bring it in you see it's it's all a part of that it's how everything working together in coordination for one objective and that is Jesus Christ that he might be glorified we're not interested who gets the glory it should not be glory going to any man the glory should go back to the Lord Jesus Christ if any gift takes away from that then that gift is not right it's not in line it's not in order there should be no gift that draws people to itself the gift if it's properly placed and comes into its position around Christ as he's revealed in that hour that gift yielded is like the gold the frankincense and the myrrh it testifies of his presence on earth being revealed in that hour and it declares him for who he is so he said neglect not the gift that is in thee so you know those that seem special don't hang your harp on a willow tree now the same I think we're talking about ministering gift it is a gift come on now I mean you ain't been captured and taken into Babylon which was given thee by prophecy now remember given thee by prophecy it was not prophecy that placed it in Timothy's life prophecy itself only brought forth what God had already sown there with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery the hands of the presbytery that of their of the ministry the elders lay hands on timothy did not impart the gift into Timothy the laying on of hands were simply to recognize what had already come to fruition in Timothy's life and they are saying we agree that this gift lays here in this life hallelujah is not in parting gifts so here brother Branham you know he goes into this and he says now when we look at it he says I'm nothing I'm just your brother there's nothing to me but the Holy Spirit in predestination for then gives God has set in the church not what some elder laid his hands on God said in the church first apostles then prophets and so forth God set them in their their divine gifts for ordained of God God for our dinner God knew that they would be there just like he told with Jeremiah I ordained you to be a prophet in the foyer in your mother's room that gift was already laying there remember the scripture said gifts and callings are without repentance there can be lives that have gifts but is that gift intended to operate in the body of Jesus Christ let me just speak very plainly just because somebody was a preacher in a denomination do not mean that they are to preach to the bride of Jesus Christ now you with me just because somebody was a deacon here or a trustee there it doesn't mean that automatically when they're gonna be a deacon in the body of Jesus Christ or that no it doesn't mean that it's not just simply as something that's carried around it does does this come together to reflect the vision of Christ in this hour oh my I'll tell you great is the humility for one who is able to come and the word the manifestation of Jesus Christ means more to them than any gift in their life brother Ram goes on to say here in faith cometh by hearing look what he says here God set some in the church to dramatize okay let me just take you back it was a cool October evening and blind Bartimaeus sat next to the wall when brother Branham goes through that I don't know about you whether I'm in October or not I can feel that breeze it's gifted to be able to do that in a place to where you and I can come into that place right there some are set in order to dramatize think one brother band doing faith faith as a substance remember I asked for different people play the sound and they got their back turned this way did you smell it no did did you see it no but what was it well I heard it ah you heard it see he dramatized trying to bring those things up why would God even direct a man to do that because his love desires that his children would be edified God will go to great lengths to see that his word is godly oh I love that don't you he said notice he set some in the church to dramatize some to preach fiery sermons others to pray for the sick but all these gifted brothers there in the church for one purpose that's to unite the kingdom of God here on earth the Brotherhood so this ministry now the Lord Jesus Christ it's a call to true ones it's a call to the real grounds of true fellowship with God that's oneness with him his life in us and we in him that's what the ministry calls true in the ministry is a declaring that Liberty has come amen it declares Liberty has come now think about how that God has so coordinated that the body is one unit yet every part is needful and instrumental that we the example God gave us last week of how that the cells of my body need food but my cells can't go to the pantry and open it up and get it right my hands can't open up the pantry unless my feet get me there but even after I get the food I've got to have some teeth and I've got to be able to chew it then I've got to be able to swallow it there's got to be some digestive juices down there to bring it along and then there's got to be that of blood that's able to transport it into the cells and finally what the cells are calling for that ah but you see it's all part of the body it's one coordinated effort that's why brother Branham would take and he would speak in the two parts and humble thyself and he spoke of the third pool the operating of that word he said he will take all parts coordinating one with another and you know what that takes that takes a lot of sacrifice it takes down laying down ideas laying down opinions laying down thoughts it takes to where everybody's willing to lay down for one objective that's Jesus Christ and I'm glad that he's present to bring us into that place to where we get our eyes off of ourselves and our eyes are focused just on him we want to see him glorified oh I believe that's it well that's the work of the Holy Spirit working in our midst even now God has set has chosen and set this church in such a way that that that it could ever be just one office or one gift but rather it would be the Holy Ghost working through a mini membered body where the Spirit of God works through a great diversity to accomplish his work don't misunderstand me but this church cannot survive alone on my ministry let's say you're the pastor of this church that's true but it's just like with that not to get off on that part tonight but it's just to understand that you know what there's times when my children have needed braces or they need to go to the doctor guess what I'm not I'm not I'm not the guy whatever you call it that puts on the braces on the mouth or I'm not the guy that says here here's the blood pressure cuff let me check your blood pressure stick out your tongue now let me see if you got a sore throat no I take them to somebody who's able to address that God has specialist in the body he has specialist let me tell you something when one of my children has been helped and somebody says hey we need to put this device on it'll help with their bite or we need to put these for these things on or they need to take this medicine or they need to avoid eating at this time in my I'm thankful for that wisdom that they have that's how God has made us God has placed it you say why would it have to be somebody else to come in and it's got to be called to minister to that need that's how God orchestrated it so we don't come to rest on a man our rest is in the Lord Jesus Christ this is his ministry it's the work of the ministry and I tell you God's love is so great that He desires to see that the message has gotten to his children he'll use every divine avenue that he's placed in the church now I told you these things I found this this burden upon my heart because I see a great need in the church for these things right now it's one of those things that I think that you know and God has to give the inspiration and the unction for the moment but it's that we would have an understanding and of what God has placed at our disposal it's like if you went into your kitchen and your husband got you a bunch of certain pots and certain things and you looked at and said man them things are kind of nice what do they do or you never even asked you just assumed you know maybe here you are working with one pot and you're using this pot for something and you don't need to be using that pot for that this pots designed for it so it needs it that helps to understand you know like certain things like hey don't use that skillet to cook pegs use this skillet over here oh it cooks eggs better they don't stick in it oh thank you for that you see God has placed the gifts in the body for the edifying of the body Oh glory this is why that every when God wrote his word brother Brandon would play it place that he said God gave His Word and that should be sufficient if it was my word he said are your word people wouldn't take it could be it but not God God's not willing that any would perish so God has placed in the church five ministerial gifts and if it still is not got through those five ministerial gifts God has placed nine spiritual gifts listen to me now that every single member of the body of Jesus Christ is subject to one of those nine spiritual gifts at any moment that's why you want to be a bit over the center I don't know if I could do that no be available it's not what you could do it's him coming down and using you hallelujah so to draw all of this is not was not to scatter the church but it's true draw the church together it's to make ready for the coming of the Lord now when brother branham you know would place it like this how that God he would say it like this in the message Jesus Christ the same and he speaks of how he says now in the second paragraph that I have there if you couldn't take my word for it that'd be enough but not God no he moves every stone that can be moved to see if he can get you to believe then he sends his spirit into us sometimes it works in different ways he sends it into us to reveal himself it's very important it works in different ways even among the five ministerial gifts every evangelist is not the same every pastor is not the same every teacher is not the same every apostle is not to say now you might have certain preferences but remember your preferences is all pertaining to you God takes five ministerial gifts and he lifts the devil he exposes him remember these gifts aren't outside the body they're in the body in the message looking at the unseen he said if I didn't mean if I didn't believe your word you'd say let him go I might say the same thing about you but not God not God he he's long-suffering he sends gifts and so forth his love and his long-suffering so when God has set a gift before us this is God being long-suffering it's God's love to us how many times we you've been in a service and you think oh my goodness it's like he's been sitting in our home church it's like this being said here it is this look goodness every time you have any contact with this brother no and it's like where did my goodness how all this is lining up who's doing it it's gone denominations had a good idea but they failed to recognize it's God who oversees his body that's why we don't have an earthly headquarters that we contact to say hey are we on the right page hey are we doing just right hey am i listening to the right tape hey am i listen oh we don't have an earthly headquarters we have a heavenly headquarters that we have been brought in contact with by the Holy Ghost it is called the New Jerusalem it is the mother of the three children of God amen were under his leadership his unction I don't have to call you up and say listen to this message hey brother in unison this message hey you listen brother Adam you listen this message hey you look I don't have to do that I'm so glad that it's not based on me I'm glad that there's one in our myth that he confirms himself by confirming his word that it's him leading us that ought to just lift every big iron little you hallelujah he's long-suffering this is why brother Randall would write it like this as well I'm just laying upon these things these five ministerial offices now when brother Branham was standing here these are things that in the church at that time they were claiming all the rest of the four ministerial gifts but they weren't claiming profits what's what he writes here this or speaks then there's five ministry officers how many believes that sure that's first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists how many knows that now how can you say there's a pastor or evangelist without saying there's a prophet how can you say there's a prophet when there isn't an apostle some people like to say oh there's pastors evangelists and teachers but they don't want to say prophet that's changed come on now people around the message wanna sale there's a prophet but they don't want to say there's pastors teachers apostles evangelists whoa look how that's changed the same God said teachers and evangelists said prophets he keeps his word we don't pin knife it we just preach it it's up to God to take care of his own work you see God has set this in the church God has sent us I don't have time to labor on this tonight but this is what I'm preaching to you God has sent to us the message in this hour and we have no other message to preach let me just say it clearly as brother Perry green and it's so blessed brother Branham in what house will you build me brother brother brother Perry says I am only here to back up what God has already given to this generation the same angel of the Lord that met the prophet and delivered that message and stood there night after night after night he's still right here with his children he's never left us we've been made aware laughter said God open his eyes that he might see we've been stabilized with the reality the mighty Conqueror is in our midst [Applause] Jesus and Luke 22 and many he had to he had to deal with this a number of times not just in the different Gospels but even in the Gospel of Luke this came up a couple times where there got to be this you know strife among them the Bible says among the disciples which of them should be accounted the greatest he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so that's confidence in it this ain't gonna be the way it's going to be with you all how can that be because his life was going to come into them he was the example son of God he was the example ministry he was the example because the bride is to be a reflection of the groom is that right so then to see that this is not going to be so because he though not in physical corporal form but he would come back into his church to lead his church Oh glory be to God but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but I am among you as he that serveth see a real true gift is not about you serve me a real true gift with a real true objective and motive has nothing to do with a man images bring it down so it is even more clear it has nothing to do with the fact of a man saying well you know I could go work but it's easier I would rather do this that man did don't don't even think about it because then it's not at all what you think it is totally the wrong motive and wrong objective are you with me I know it's getting down kind of a little tight but the reality of it is it's not even let me bring it down to this it's not even about what that man wants to preach there's many things and I say I mentioned these things to you so that you understand that there's been times were here things are studied out and you know you might think well it's all easy but here I am I'm right there at the desk and all of a sudden I sense a change car like no Lord no Lord no no no no I know what that's gonna Intel and I'm talking about only maybe a 45-minute window sometimes you only all you have is just a few words on a piece of paper god knows what he's doing god knows what he's doing you know him in my earlier time brother Brian made out could've thought oh my lord lord did I not give myself more to you maybe I should have been praying more maybe I should have been doing this more maybe I should have been doing this more maybe I said no God is just letting God lets me know I've got this you might be on a your nerves might be on a ball of pins and needles but get up there and act like it don't act like it act like you know what you're doing you know realize sometimes preachers are good actors but when he comes and takes over and he just starts unfolding that then I mean we're swimming in good water then brother but you see it's not all together the things that even that a minister wants to preach it's not about seeing this and seeing that there's a lot of things of of outlines that I haven't separate things I haven't even come close not even to preach it and even upon these things of waiting for a time when when is the right time not begging God but seeing the need but even in seeing the need it's just like it is with your own family you wait till appropriate times yeah you don't know so I'm saying you don't tell your wife maybe you ought to look to do the chicken like this when you're eating the chicken right there wait till a day later maybe kind of make a suggestion a week later come on brothers I can get a witness on that there's some experienced ones here so now look how brother Brandon would put it like this and I have heard but now I see he talks about Jove and he said Joel had a channel of communication to God that he got by inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and letting God move in he knowed he was justified it was a gift it was a gift for the people not for Joel but for the people think about it Joe didn't know what was going on blood bombs even tells us over and over he said many times he said you might take blood I mean you're a prophet you know what's going on here you know it's a he said no he said he keeps things from me as well things he said that I don't even know about he does and brings the past and I find out after it's already happened so it's not God is he's obligated in a way God is training even as he trained Joe he trains every Minister office he trains you and me he trains us to wait on him it's when we can get ourselves out of the way then he steps in that's why brother Branson when you talk to that level and take the token with you well become a channel that's look what he says here it was a gift it was a gift for the people not for job but for the people know and brother ban him here he is Minh in a car accident here he's laying in a room on the way back to Jeffersonville he said put my hand on your mom Billy sister me he prayed for it but the gift as he told us over and over it's not for me hmm that means a lot to me there's a lot of things when I'm listening to the message it means a lot more than just doctrine I'm seeing a life that's been left I'm seeing a life that has come to maturity and been molded and been changed by the Living God Alleluia that's what all divine gifts are to serve God's people with it's like a song leader a song leader might have songs picked out to get up here and sing God may not want him to sing those songs they might even been the songs that he likes to sing God may not want him to sing those songs somebody might have requested hey were you singing this song he gets up here he's under the anointing and the Spirit of God takes him down this pathway right here you see he's following the Lord not a list and you would see all of the supplies we're following him this is why we're all divine you it's not about it's just serve God's people or mine let me get going everybody's not ordered to be a prophet not ordered to be praying for the sick all of them is not ordered to be pastors and so forth but it's a channel that God has opened to them a channel now I want you to look here let me just let them to me let me let me skip over and go to John 17 here is the Lord Jesus in his prayer and he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word through that word you said well it's gotta be his word but remember once he has committed that word and given that word it belongs to me we become one with it then it is no longer I that speaketh it's Christ in me Laure Peter God that they all may be one notice the purpose of this word going forth that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I envy that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me see the union with him Calvary made way for a union where you and I could be united with a Living God so then it's not us carrying the message its Christ in us carrying his message its Christ in you the hope of glory its Christ in your preaching his gospel it's not your words oh if I just you know sometimes and all of us have been there well if I could just you know the right words I had this brothers man at work hard this lady at work her or this one at work remember jesus said take no thought you're not that whole phrase deal don't become anxious about it take no thought what should I do you'll be available be available and God shut down and use you how many times God step down and use the Prophet and he didn't even use one scripture a man was converted by a by preaching about an apple tree help me now brother Han you ought to be shouting on this one he there was a man converted and a deer walked out there he saw God in nature [Applause] you'll be chewing on that one a while you see what it is it is not about what this scripture of that scripture your the Word made flesh I said you're the Word made flesh no Ramin a God in the highest may God help us through their word through your word that they would believe you see it's not our words that brings the conviction it's his presence coming behind that word it's not our word alone that moves the mountain it's his presence behind that word that pulse is that mountain to be removed my brother branham made this day I'm just gonna refer to this quote bin so don't get to it this brother I made a statement may not be seemingly the most popular but it's still truth he said the most important thing of the day is a good god sent preacher I admire their gift and their gift is before anything that else could be done as a preeminent preacher is a man who knows how to rightfully divide the Word of God to bring to her what to bring the faith of the people that's what the Ministry of the word is all about that our faith would raise so with that in mind let me just say this to you God's a preacher yo with me I said God's a preacher because it has to be him preach but this ain't the first time God's preached and you know what brother Brian he ain't changed his message Galatians 3 8 and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached who preached God preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed God's a preacher he may not be one of the five ministerial gifts in your life but he still preaches he preaches salmon's sometimes among your family he preaches series little waves that go you there for teaching all nations and baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ is to announce the acceptable year of the Lord as the jubilee you know that speaks up come back to your inheritance come back to what rightfully belongs to you we're Satan is trying to rob you of your inheritance but remember there is not one part of that inheritance that belongs to this tribe can pass to another tribe when AI did what he did through as Jezebel's cunning way to Naples vineyard but yet no matter all of that cunning ways to try to take away that inheritance you can't remove that inheritance to whom it belongs true that lays in the third nation of Almighty God and no matter what the enemy could have tried to rob you and keep you back from your rightful inheritance of the Holy Ghost but God has seen fit that belongs to you no repeated God in the highest this is what Paul would say in 2nd Corinthians 3 for such trust we have through God through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament Abel what makes you able the sacred sands of God's grace meeting that pillar of fire what makes you an able believer meeting God face-to-face it makes you able it equips you not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the spirit giveth life notice Paul and I want you to take take notice of this this is the working of a true apostolic ministry it's a ministry that works within the body listen to me carefully it recognizes the body of which it is a part of and it recognizes that God works in every part of his body this is not a Ministry of song this is the ministry of David here's me Saul took daughters and sons and everything for himself but David equipped them to fight but second Corinthians five what's what's watch this you'll find the same thing in the ministry of Malachi for all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the Ministry of reconciliation house but I'm not a preacher but you're a witness come on now you're a witness to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation a word but the same that will bring people in to a true relationship with Jesus Christ dude right not a word that creates trench members but a word that actually will bring people to a place of reconciliation to whether that in harmony was God hey man where is the ministry of the true atonement coming through the church to where Christ is reconciled with his people where people are not united with a gift they're not united with a personality they're not united with a man they are united is the victory of Jesus Christ hallelujah God is not resting his church upon the shoulders of man he said upon this rock I'll build my church then we are ambassadors for Christ it's kind of like the same when you went to Texas you were an ambassador and you brought back some Goods and goods kept you going back there as an ambassador god bless you sister the same thing for you to smile like a possum it's the same thing your ambassadors knew you were ambassador you are represent them adjust down let me bring it on down now you are an ambassador you are a representative of what this church stands for if this church don't believe in wearing pants you shouldn't be wearing pants this church believes in a real genuine baptism of the holy ghost you want to be a partaker of it come on now you're an ambassador your life is an ambassador of billboard preach medicine I will we are ambassadors of Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him 2nd Corinthians 6:1 we've in as workers together with him better day workers together with him God does not work outside of his word he doesn't work outside of his body he works through his body when the eunuch was reading Isaiah 53 listen Isaiah was the prophet he had it open in the scroll of Isaiah 53 and God took Philip from Samaria and caught him away for one person did you hear me one person God will cause a man to be the dead into a meeting that might have hundreds for one person that ought to make you rejoice because you know what God don't have favorites what he's done for others he'll do for you hallelujah hey man who goes after you leave the man a man go after the one he went after the one who was there at Samaria I'm glad he'll come and minister to my knee workers together with him here came Philip down to the eunuch you understand what you read how can i except some man teach me but not the man but recognize God works through man let me just move on from that God works through the office of man so we find we know what took place there with that of the eunuch now notice beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain so we want to be workers don't we that's why when God has done something for your life listen when God has really touched a life it ought to be the call out of our hearts like Paul what would you have me do Lord what can I do for your body what can I do Lord God to help the work on Lourdes what can I do don't receive the grace of God in vain for he saith I have heard thee in a time accepted into the day of salvation have ice occurred thee behold now is the acceptable time that hold now is the day of salvation now to think how's that God replace these in here of ministering spirits and I'm just going to move on here and skip over a few things and go keep on going here we have Paul he's setting forth the work of the Ministry of the Son of Man in the diversity of the offices you don't find Peter speaking these things about pastors prophets teachers evangelists you don't find Peter but yet Peter picks up on this and Peter will then use the term elders bishop are you with me these are things that notice within mark 16 these words were not there but yet the Lord Jesus being the fullness the great diamond he had within him every one of these gifts are you with me he was prophet its teacher pastor evangelist apostle right they wanted him to stay in this town and he said no no I must need to go to the other town that preached to is that right now watch out that Paul is going through this once again he's inclusive therefore seeing we have this ministry singular as we have received mercy we think not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the Word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake your servants not your Lords not sure dictators your servants servants is to serve his body it's him ministering to the needs of his wife his care is so precise his care is so delicate his care is so intentional his care is so perfect and in all of it its edifying we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts notice the same what happened in Genesis 1 the same God where there was darkness he spoke and light let there be light so the spoken word and light that light is the life of men well what is fear look what he's saying for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ in the face in the presence of Jesus Christ you know Paul is saying here we have no light of our own we have no light of our own the light is that which is reflected it's a reflected light a light that he himself has shined into us but notice it's his right not our life his life and where does it do it shows forth Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever that's why brother Graham said the message of the hour in one house will you build me it's not just to be the flame of the other it's to be the flame of our hearts because he said and we know this would be the truth if it's not the flame of our hearts we can't rightly present it to others but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God earthen vessels probably everybody in here knows what a clay flowerpot is there's an earthen clay a vessel now it's not like some of these make-believe pots that I've seen it lowers they look they look that way my lord I thought one one come on for shelter oh here goes a million pieces it just looked that way it wasn't breakable it was just fiberglass but you take one of those clay pots you might only have drop it this far get a break you know why it's made out of fragile frail weak material and God has chosen frail weak material that he might step inside and display his strength I'm talking about you tonight I'm talking about every one of us tonight not just the ministerial gift I'm talking about every one of us it's greater is He that is in us hallelujah many times we could have went to pieces but there's one on the inside brother we're not held together by Elmer's glue were held together by the supernatural power of God amen that's guiding us through the excellencies of the power of God and not of us brother Branham would stand in the message birth pains he said don't you look at the messenger you look at his message focus on that message you see this diamond that we we looked at let me just close this diamond we talked about last weekend we'll pick this up here maybe next week you know a diamond let me leave you with this you know a diamond that's it's important some of the brothers writing everything inside sighs sighs sighs no in reality the most important thing about a diamond is the cut because those who are cutting it that's what they do for a living I even know they use lasers now but the cuts what's most important the weight is also important so they have a trying to get this balanced out with weight and cut because if they get the cut a little off to where it doesn't really show the fire on the inside of that diamond they can still charge if they make it bigger they can still charge a pretty good price for it but in order to get that fire to show that's in it it takes the right kind of cut because when they put that cut in there one who makes it must understand the lights and the angles many times you know they ask you some sister gets the keys let me see the ring better saying you get a ring yeah all right man all right yeah but how it's cut determines its brilliance there's a couple qualities and I'm just going close brilliance and dispersion brilliance is how much light it returns the run the cut itself will determine how much light it returns the dispersion will actually be how much internal fire it displays so it's got to be cut just right he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him Norah Peter God the cut was made by the master cutter he knew exactly where to cut it so that the brilliance of that light might return so that the dispersion of the eternal internal fire might come forth and just to think a little bride he gave you the wedding band and it's got that diamond right there on it in that awesome he's given his gifts to the church and every one of those gifts pastor prophet teacher evangelist apostle all the nine spiritual give you that which lays in your life is for the body of Jesus Christ how glorious is the body of Jesus Christ because of him oh you know you almost stand there to see the Queen of Sheba remember when she came to Solomon and she stood and she came and watched her she had proved him with hard sayings the Bible says she stood in his house and she watched his servants put meat she watched him how they went up the stairs and she said there was no spirit well she said happy what gift is it that God has placed in our midst that's what the Ministry of Malachi 4 came to bring the church where the church had got off target come on now they got off target he came to bring it back around the real true genuine gift that we ought to be rallying around and that is the Lord Jesus Christ the ghost thank God for the eyes in this hour to catch that and bring the church you know what that is that's an apse that's the absolute of the church this is the anchor of the church this is the place of safety of the Church of the Living God this is the place of stabilizing that's just Heavenly Father Lord we thank you tonight for your mercy Oh God Lord how the Lord that you come you Lord enlighten our lives Lord out of this service tonight I know that it's more than just that we would understand one beginning Lord as you're just beginning to move into this Lord take us through this with them the gifts the officers are placed in the church I believe within every one of these I believe there's things that Lord that you're speaking as you as you do in each service you have a personal conference with every life Lord Jesus I pray that here tonight as your word has gone forth I asked Lord Jesus that you would Lord you come to encourage that harder that life that they may rise take their inheritance I pray that their faith has raised a little bit tonight Lord if it hasn't raised quite to that place I pray that God it's it's moved even if it's moved just an answer I pray that it's moved an inch Lord that's closer to you than it was when it first came in here I pray that God for any heart it might be looking in their life there's a question that they would have what would you have me do I pray Lord that you'll let them and let them see what your desire is of how that you desire to use them in every one of these parts every one of these things norden's for your glory it's amazing Lord I I said in my office many times and I listen and listen to the songs that are sung listen to the specials listen many times Lord to the prayers it's being prayed over the prayer requests and hearing the Lord how that you're just bringing a service together none of us have talked about it they don't they don't know what I'm gonna speak on you don't know they angled the direction I don't know the songs they're gonna see God how that you bring things together I I pray that it just help us Lord to see your love may we see it it's your long-suffering nor their every gift you've placed in the body it's your love being reflected back into the church help us O God to be sensitive I pray you and help each and every each and every one of your children tonight may there be more may every one of us being more consecrated to be available to be available to you lord I think of the woman Lord with a little alabaster box she knew you were gonna be there she was moved to do you a service Lord God may we be moved Lord to do you a service but you said as you've done it unto the least of these you've done it unto me Oh God how we are so thankful for the Holy Ghost we're so thankful for the word God you've sin Anissa Weier thankful for the body of Jesus Christ Lord I'm thankful for each and every gift I'm thankful for each and every every gift you placed in the body oh god I think I thank you for every soul you have played and redemption lord I thank you lord I thank you for every life that you're working on right now I thank you Lord God I think your father every songwriter thank you for every gift that you place in every talent Lord in the body thank you Lord God for every burden Lord God that you placed upon our hearts Oh God I think of sister Bruce Lord I've looked at that statement many many times your prophet she thought she was gonna perhaps pass away she was in that interview with you with the Prophet and when the Prophet began to pray mother Branham would use these words he said she's like Dorcas of old father and she said value to this church Lord we meet her Lord what many people did not know is how sister Bruce would get a burden on her heart to pray for somebody she couldn't stop until she prayed for him she'd go to the hospitals and pray for him many miracles many things took place that yet Lord God is not a lot than knew about it but yet Lord she saw her part what you asked her to do and she was willing she said yes Lord God may you find the same in us may you find it Lord God among us Lourdes ministers may you find it Lord God among our lives Lord Jesus it's not about crowds not about the size of the crowd not about the size of the church not about how many people that we can have around us Lord this is for every one of us it's about serving your body and help us Lord to be available help us to be available help us Lord that we can remember that as you came down the god of glory you took on the form of a servant to minister to our needs Gordan I want to say it I believe there's others tonight they will join me I'm available I'm available papa Lord God if you want to use me Lord not just his reach the word I think of how your prophet would say it like this when he challenged himself and brother Neville he said that this is what God has called me to do but what about beyond this can I do for the kingdom of God Oh Lord Jesus help us lord help us father I pray may we not try to live maybe the psalm leaders or not try to limit you and just say well I lead songs but Lord God may it be Lord from the heart Lord what else would you have me do Lord Jesus for each and every one of us Lord it's a vital part in your body we never see the cells taking in the nourishment that's been broke down and carried in the bloodstream invented but we see the effects of it because that life has strength the body has strength because the food was able to get to the right place help us Lord we might be the feet we might be the hands the ears the eyes the nose but what a blessing it is to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ maybe we do our part Lord I pray being yielded being every gift it's to get ourselves out of the way help us Lord I pray tonight in the name of Jesus Christ I'm in like to be consecrated that way Lord I want to I want a fresh consecration I want a fresh consecration to be used by you follow your lead amen sing to the back go ahead god bless you if you'd like to stand amen
