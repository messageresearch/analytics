discover sort through those memories my [Music] one more time yes it's a water cover [Music] [Applause] [Music] thankful to the Lord that we have representation that we feel that call to perfection amen that called to perfection were in that week our salvation comes to its end where we move from this this life into that next life into that body that is waiting for us because not only did Calvary within the atonement it's a dual atonement it was the atonement for our soul and the atonement for a body and we experienced the effects and the realities of that here in our soul we're to know that he had forgiveth all our iniquities he brings a reality and a release in our heart from that old nature we've been set free and then while in the course of this time he made a promise to us that hew he lifts of all diseases so that covers the gamut of everything no matter what pandemic or whatever comes we have the promise of assurance in the Lord no matter what new name new want no 1 acronym they come up with we have the promise God has it fully covered amen we know that none of these things could have happened if there would not have been a fall in the beginning and any sickness or anything that God permits to come our way Satan can do nothing even in bringing what we have experienced and see even how that this has brought not only our nation but many other nations to a standstill and has brought us to a place to where where we are were gathering like this to try to comply and to help and do our part even as the citizens of this nation that we are part of but we recognize that there is a great reality wherein that Christ himself has made a way that we can be free first of all from the greatest plague and the greatest plague is death spiritual death is to be free from sin amen and we know that that's the last plague to strike the land and that left leg is striking the land I'm talking about spiritual death it's been striking the land that's the most severe splegg there is his spiritual death and so we thank God for a provision that's been made a man through Calvary and how truly our eyes have been anointed to look and to be caught in that blood stream where we can be identified as sons and daughters of God in this hour I want to say here the the this afternoon we certainly love and appreciate each and every one of you I want to say thank you mom I want to say that I appreciate how that the different ones that have come here to be able to man the different position so that we could be able to stream this and I want to say I so appreciate brother Brian holdren brother Brian's work in laboring throughout the years where we have at times where we've maybe had to be home or go back and go back into a service and archive it and I certainly thank God that brother Brian is gifts and talents that the Lord has given him that it's we it's been a blessing to us here and not just in that but in many other ways but I I'm certainly appreciative of that that when we come into this time and and brother Brian you know it's just uh just a real wonderful brother he and sister Susanna and their family and we just appreciate them for that there's things that they're even working for with me right now or some other things and one of the things that I want to do in coming up here this coming week someday I don't know exactly what platform I'm going to use but I would like to maybe just have a little bit of a an informal time and I'll be doing this from my home or I'll just entertain questions and answers pertaining to these things right here that we are dealing with I believe that God has been answering a lot of questions that even are not set forth or maybe haven't been set forth but maybe one thing without me really elaborating on our preaching about it today we recognize that within it that where their head there has indeed an announcement of plagues and and that from the Book of Revelations from revelations 8 and we recognize all of those things even when we look at that within Egypt and we know that there are plagues that are coming upon the earth that will come upon the earth and that will fall upon everyone without the baptism of the Holy Ghost do I believe that this is that no I I don't but I don't have the word of the Lord on that but I can't say that that's what this is because I believe God gives us the strength in the anchor that in the midst of no matter what comes my faith and our faith is to rest in that God is our all sufficiency no matter in any situation the main thing is is to be in Goshen and Goshen is a type of Christ to be under the blood that's the main and most important thing within this I think we're wasting energy if we're trying to figure everything out God has given us a clear promise light has come to us in this hour and I'm grateful for the Holy Spirit that he is the one who delivered to us the word in this hour and he's present to bring it together and to enlighten us in every step of the journey I'm so grateful that one of the things that to me it wasn't just a song that brother Branham was singing at the end of the message leadership the brother Branham at the end of that song at the end of that service if you'll notice he sings a song god be with you till we meet again and that is truly the reality is God is veiled in his bride that same the same age of the Lord the same Holy Spirit the same God is here with us so I want to and I'm going to look at doing it perhaps on either through a certain instrument that I use for the youth meeting on Friday night we had a wonderful youth meeting but it was all over the over the platform that I used the zoom platform and I was able we were able to see one another's faces and I was able to interact with them and we had a nice Bible study and just a real wonderful time fellowship around the word of the Lord and so we certainly look for that once again and I would say this to you if those that are part of this assembly I know myself I don't have a Facebook account and I'm not planning on getting one but if there is someone as you are here a part of this assembly because this particular streaming thing that I'm going to do where I greet the assembly this is just for the local assembly I'm not going outside of the local assembly I'm staying just confined here so if you have some of you that have not linked up into Facebook yet I want to encourage you if if you and your spouse or whomever do that for not only this time but also for even announcements that'll come and I know like I said not everybody has Facebook but we have to do we'll do the best that we can and we're gonna try we'll let you know hopefully by tomorrow by way of email on how that we're going to approach that and just to have a little bit of time where I can kind of kind of just greet you and talk to you and maybe there won't be any questions and that would be fine it would be fine as well but there be some things we can just have a little bit where I can just just deliver a little bit of a direct connection with you I certainly miss all of you my I miss all of you we we're so that's the hardest thing that within the midst of this as my wife and I were talking is just we just we just miss being together with the rest of God's children it's nothing that does my heart good you know I just I love being together and that's something that the love of God puts in your heart amen as we see that the brother BAM told us from the love of God is in your heart you can't wait for the church doors to open you can't wait to get together with the rest of your brothers and sisters so we're just certainly looking to the Lord and I don't know exactly you know I don't have anything of a date for us or whatever at this time but without any further ado I'll you know be able to speak to you on some sort of a platform and I'm kind of looking at this to be on Tuesday Tuesday evening that I can kind of just be able to just address you a little bit and it'll be more informal I'll be in my office at home so may the Lord bless you and I'm so thankful that God's provided all of these different avenues for us we want to remember and the prayer requests we want to remember sister Shirley crest that the Lord had just continued to move for her she's been dealing with a lot of pain and they have been continuing to move her surgery back and so we want to we just want to ask that the Lord would just move down for sister Shirley and God would relieve that pain and so we just we want to just bind our hearts together with that also for brother Mark Schaefer in the time of his recovery as well and brother Mark is doing well is there an appetite it's little by little and you know it's a process recovery healing as a process we want to just continue to remember him in prayer also brother her brother herb you know right now he's there in the hospital and in the ICU and he really needs a touch from the Lord and so we've just want to bring that that these things would stay before you in your hearts and also for our brother Gabriel that God would just continue to strength him strengthen him and touch him and so I want to look into the word of the Lord here this morning and before we do maybe we just want to just have prayer and before we turn and open into the word Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're just so thankful that we Lord know you to be our Father and that we are your children Lord oh god of the royal seed of Abraham Lord Oh father for that precious royal blood Oh God that was shed for us Lord

Oh you're the love of our life Lord you're our joy and our peace Lord we love you and just appreciate you Lord now we just give ourselves to you Lord and look to you that you'll just direct us in your word now and all things we ask it for the glory of God amen and amen hallelujah I want to go to Acts chapter 27 I just just felt just to go ahead while we would this was still so fresh in our hearts and our minds just the Lord just seemed to press some things up on my heart and I want to just move to verse verse 20 and just read there and when neither Sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away but after long abstinent Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete to obtain this harm and loss and now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me howbeit we must be cast upon a certain Island amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word I want to continue with that the title be of good cheer the Lord is in full control but I want to draw your attention here in the scriptures and as we recognize that perfect peace what perfect peace is is to have the governing of all things under the leadership of the Holy Spirit it's to let every one of our five natural senses see taste feel smell in here and every spiritual sense imagination reasoning conscience memory affection to let all of those be under the governance of the holy spirit all our abilities all our skills all the understanding he has given us is to be brought into submission to him and that is our responsibility and that is where we are to arrest every thought or bring every thought into captivity all the natural senses which God he has given us the natural senses in order to contact our earthly home and yet within that he never placed that we would be led by our natural senses neither are we to be led by our spiritual senses but it is to be governed by the holy spirit or rather that's sixth sense that faith that faith of God that is deposited in our lives now as we were looking at in this even on Thursday that very as Paul let him know you should have listened to me you should have hearkened to what was being said and we recognize that you know many times we are in the face of or we have been or will be in the face of individuals that are more trained than what even we are even where you know when someone would be maybe in a situation medically and everything where the medical doctors what they have wrote they have diagnosed by the symptoms and the knowledge and everything and even according maybe to all of their machines they can look at all of that and they make a declaration but yet within it we have a choice will we allow that of their abilities and thank God for it we don't shirk that at all but we realize that we also have another report we know that like brother Branham would say it like this for the RAM called doctors God's agents we know that they're God's agents God has allowed him to tap into that in order to help suffering humanity let me just say it like this maybe for you or I let's say for your eyes that it was something where we did not need doctors or there was not a channel we would go by a medical way still for somebody who does not know God in that way or have access to that place if there is something that could be available to help them in our hearts as a Christian as a believer we do not want to see humanity suffer this is why we even reach out and we have within us to give reason of the hope that lies within us we have within us as Peter said sanctify the Lord always in your heart that you might be able to declare it what is within your bosom to be able to lead others we the desire within our heart truly when God has ever touched that live and what God means to you and I we know that we cannot give it to somebody else but all if it was in our ability to open somebody else's eyes we would do it if it was in our ability to heal somebody we would do it but we but what we can do and what we do have is access to the one that has done it in us the one that we know that is able and and willing and ever-present to fulfill his word so even in this our natural leadership our natural or our natural senses our natural abilities this is why and that you know even when I had spoke to young people in some meetings before and even here in our local youth meetings but even when in the other places where I've been to mention to them that listen you might have an education that ranges into a PhD level and your pastor may not have even a high school graduation he may not even have even a high school diploma but what you have to realize is God has allowed you to come to that ability that you have those skills have been refined that he placed within you but never substitute the leadership of the Holy Spirit for your natural abilities it's always to bring us into that place to submit under the leading of the Lord that it's not a Doctorate submitting to a middle school education but it is our lives submitting to the authority of the Holy Spirit that's where this age has failed they have looked at things that you know remember they feel so rich and they have need of nothing there's got to be such training what school did you have from are you qualified never has a school qualified a man it is God that qualifies that man God does not call the qualified God qualifies the called it's God who does the work hey man it's God who'd who makes the calling so within this it's our lives that have a continual direction that we find to come under the leadership of the Holy Spirit our reasonings and our our imaginations and the reality is that for all of us we all face that battle over and over even in every different situation you even face that battle who in someone where the enemy would try to come into your mind and maybe somebody walks walks by and they didn't shake your hand and immediately the enemy says I see what that person did and this and brother BAM says you'll find yourself if you start entertaining that you start acting differently toward that brother so we understand it's constantly to have to bring it in line with the Holy Spirit we need and for that we need God's grace so I look back at the scripture here in in in acts 27 and where the scripture when Paul would write this is the third day he went and there was neither Sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us and all hope that we should be saved was then taken away you see Paul look remembers we were saying on Thursday God had wrote his his his word in the heavens there are things that even when we come in through times where we are praying and we are looking for the will of God in a situation and we don't get a direct answer and we're looking for God we know we have direct precious promises but we're looking and saying Lord what is your mind in this situation what we're asking for if we're actually asking God it would you reveal that this situation that it's past it's over with that's what we're asking is for direction for his course you see they had taken a core in sailing this ship and the course the time and everything by not heeding to the word of the Lord they come into a trouble a situation because they did not heed the counsel and so within it Paul Paul's declaration was all hope that we should be saved was then taken away brother Brandon would say it like this regarding this he said Paul was just as scared as the rest of them it might be hard to swallow but maybe get your glass of water next to you to help you walking about with chains on him any minute the old ship would capsize and go over that'd be the end of it no moon and stars 14 days and nights her pitching back and forth in the storm no way to hold it nor nothing but little Paul thought perhaps he'd pray through all hopes was gone he was a man known as I blow travel put this in here he was a man no matter how much he was acquainted with God all hopes was gone Paul did not know what the outcome was going to be gone had not told him you're gonna go to Rome and you're gonna appear before Caesar God had not told him that he didn't know the outcome in this particular situation he was a man as as James would describe subject unto like passions such as we are and and we are aware and if you're not aware fear itself it brings paralysis it can absolutely paralyze faith what fear does fear itself and let me just say breach just for a moment here fear works in a manner as the enemy would come it works in a manner to close off like you take a person that deals with anxiety or if you've ever dealt with it into such a place it can so take ahold of a person to where it literally like just hijacks their brain to where they don't even know what to do or to try to process and you could say don't worry that won't help them a bit it won't help them to unfold all of them but if it comes to a place to where things itself that they should be thinking about or doing they're not able to do that are you with me it paralyzes fear paralyzes faith when we were made to be open and to be led by the Spirit of God the Bible said that the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God that is a promise that belongs to sons and daughters of God to be led by the Spirit of God so Paul was given grace to be able to actually as Weber the member said he was scared as the rest of them it gave him grace to be able to pray through in the midst of that hour now listen Paul didn't know how this journey was gonna fare prior to speaking to the Lord direct prior to the Lord speaking to him directly however after the Lord spoke to him he then had a course of faith that was set God let him know personally you're gonna stand before Caesar so Paul knew whatever happens from this moment cleared at the time I'm standing before Caesar nothing is going to stand in my way there's nothing that can hinder this Paul knew that was the word of the Lord let me remind you every vision is sure and the Prophet would be clear to let us know in the Hebrew series he deals with it a lot but you'll hear him mention it throughout the message he said there's not a vision that heals you the vision only declares and make you aware of the presence of God and it makes you aware of the surance that we have in the Lord he said you must have faith in what he said how many times brother bana step away and say now whatever he said whatever he said do you believe it so the vision has been spoken the vision we must have faith in the vision God has given us a vision for this hour we must be certain in that vision and you must know personally that you are a part of this vision that's going to be something that you have settled in your heart and the vision I'm talking about is the vision of the word the vision of Christ I'm talking about abiding in him do you know that you are a part of him and his life is in you and you are in him Paul knew now let me just move a little bit Paul knew by revelation now let's just let's just divide this Paul knew by revelation he belonged to the Lord that was not his fear he knew where he was going should the Lord choose to take him home if there the ship would have busted apart Paul knew where he was going he known whom he had believed he knew he knew I was chiefess of sinner Amen but what is what his mercy did for me Paul that was not his fear his fear was not about once he a child of God or not did he belong to the Lord there was no fear in that but notice in every situation and you know what must speak across the whole entire assembly as well I've been with people before their spouse or they have went into surgery or different ones and you know what there is an uncertainty or a settlement now sometimes it's before I get there sometimes it's before I talk with them that is not anything that you're any less or any week that shows we are still in our humanity and unless God gives us direction we do not know are we going to come out of this or come out of that or come out of this but we know one thing that God keeps us through all things amen so by the way this was of course this course must be our course of faith as well we must have a clear course let me just say it for every one of you you've got to know where that you're in the ship and where is your testimony taking you you've got to know by the testimony of your life I'm telling you you know by the life you live you know if the love of the things of the world is in your life you've got a testimony that's taking you not into the presence of God not into the joys of the Lord it's taking you away and you want to be very quickly and very sound to say Lord I want to exchange for a real testimony we've got to know this is an hour you must know that you're in Christ you're in the ship and then let me just say this to you this is a light thing that's going on right now a very light thing compared to what's coming in the tribulation if I can describe a like this this is a to think for what's coming and yet there my I've had some two things and they might in my be even less than a toothache I'm not saying that to make a lot of it but in the tribulation it'll be things one right after another after another after another the judgments of God being poured out this is why it's be sure that you are accounted worthy to escape all those things that are going to come and our worthiness is by the blood of the Lamb hallelujah this is why Paul would know in situation that Paul would come into he would speak even in Philippians of how that Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death oh my so God had given divine revelation to Paul Paul would see that indeed he was going to stand before Caesar this was the course of Paul's faith his hope was clear see they didn't have any hope all hope was gone but now by this direct revelation remember all of these three abideth faithful Faith Hope charity not Hope first remember we were dealing back in the first part of March with the helmet of salvation hope is not the first hope comes after faith faith is the substance of things hoped for you have to first have the faith and in faith brings expectation you see it brings a clearer direction Paul can let him know hey be of good cheer and this is the reason he wasn't just telling him hey you guys cheer up hey you stop being so sad hey sup looking down remember Paul wasn't even that way Paul himself the angel of the Lord spoke to Paul and said fear not these are not words that are just words to be minced around God told it to Joshua he told it to Gideon he would tell it even to Elijah when Elijah was there in the cave the fire going out consuming man more would come up I would go out and God told him fear not to go down now before a.m. he would walk down and face am not in fear not wondering whether his life was going to be you know in jeopardy he knew God had spoke directly fear not and that's the same way the Lord spoke to Paul he addressed fear not I'm telling you right now there is power in the present revelation of this vision that's been unfolded in this hour to break the fear the hold of fear and to dismantle every little bit within a life we're a life itself can hopeless but there is power in the word to break that hole and give you a clear course of faith sometimes people wonder about what am I gonna do this if I give my life to God what about my wife what about this or what about that let God take care of that that's only a trap of the devil to get y'all worried put your faith in Christ it was three days they've been tossed about no Sun no moon no sign of the Sun kind of sound like the resurrection kind of sound like the resurrection didn't know what was going on right we had hoped he had been the Redeemer but then he showed up he had an appointment with them it's the same way it sounds in our lives when all hope is gone yeah and I'm not talking about where we're worried about this one or a loved one er are they you know seal I'm not talking about that I'm talking about even when we go through situations those things yes could worry as if somebody isn't ready to go but the things even within a situation where we don't have maybe a direct word lack but Paul had in the sense that you're gonna stand before Caesar right just like exactly one brother Brandon remember how many times when brother down brother dal was getting ready to pass away but remember the Spirit of God it wasn't because brother brother Branham had an affinity where brother down no and because brother branham he showed us that clearly in the message that this gift was not based on his control or the affinity that he would have with individuals it was strictly under the governments of the Holy Spirit and remember he spoke to brother down the Spirit of God moved down and said Behold and we held that they would meet again and notice how that here they were brother Branham pulling up brother Dale pulls up outside of the tabernacle and as brother Browns getting ready to walk in brother now brother now now comes out and shakes his hand and brother Branham takes that example and he says see he says how the natural person would think that these things are just arranged he said but it's not arrange its divinely orchestrated by Almighty God he was showing you and had the simplicity of how sons and daughters operate the word goes forth we walk we believe it and looked for God to arrange everything in order in other words when the handkerchief has to be there whoever's got to put it there will put it there it is that arranges all the pieces of the vision in his time that thus sayeth the Lord might break forth well glory be to God the Lord gave him a vision Paul was not worried third day Paul took a long abstinence what a good example for us sometimes we stay too much talking about the problem student making an abstinence and getting away and seeking God so this is where submission to the leadership this is where power comes in this is where the power of God will move in to dismantle fear because fear comes when you're out here residing within these outer realms and trying to figure it out and process it but to come before the Lord he can come right there and settle you and I in every situation after the word of the Lord came forth behold be of good cheer there's not that there's no harm gonna come to any man's life the ship is going to be lost but every man's life is going to be preserved safely aren't you glad that we're in this ship this life of Jesus Christ aren't you glad that he gave his life for you and I that you and I could come safely into the fold he made great provision for you and I that in a time like this that you and I could have the abiding peace and the comfort of the Holy Spirit and I'm telling you it's not just something right now and this time but it's hand of how you're doing it I'm living every day like I live every other day I'm trusting in the Lord every day of my life I trusted him for my necessary food I've trusted him for every direction he has provided all of my needs I'm not just talking about in the past few weeks he has provided all of my needs throughout the years of my life he is faithful to his word Matt didn't mean that that ship all of a sudden when the word of the Lord went forth I like how brother Adam will go into it and really putting it and we we see it in the scripture but brother bran would use the words like he said that ship just pitching as hard as it ever was he was just rocking and reeling but it didn't bother Paul faith is positive and that's why I've said that this positivity of where faith itself makes it stand and to see that win you know doctors and things like that brother BAM could say they could stand there and they say you're gonna die in the next hour but he said if you knew that she was going to get well he said it wouldn't matter if you were all covered over with cancer or eaten up with leprosy that wouldn't scare you one bit why because you knew you're going to get well right now Paul Paul had lost you know he had lost all hopes I mean this this must be the end I mean how many brothers you know brother branham even talked about him he's on the airplane I mean however how many times the airplanes he talked about you know diving down and creaking and cracking and everything else and my goodness you know but the bill you know and different things you've been on them been in situations like that before you don't know if this is the end or not right but we're not fearful in that we don't know who we are now what God gives us direction here you see he said me of good courage this when we when we look at this this ship was going to be wrecked somewhere you've got to be cast upon an island now Paul remember when he told them he told him eat they didn't eat it one till fourteen days later think about this from the third day to the 14th day right it wasn't until eleven days later that eventually they began to eat the Bible said once that they saw Paul eating brother branham said it like this he said after that vision broke he said Paul started making sandwiches he said Paul was walking up and down there and he was eatin one sandwich after another sandwich telling them be of good cheer movement senator madam ins sharks and everything else following the boat he said but Paul was walking in the midst of it he had a sure word of prophecy he could eat in the midst of that time we have received the show word of prophecy and man we have received of the Lord and for you and I it is not hindering our appetite but all the word of the Lord is so precious we are privileged to have this secret place in Christ to have this secret food that God has stored up for us and God Himself breaking to our hearts for this hour that we're living in well he is our encouragement Oh glory be to God now to think of this think of this here in the scripture huh we have promises of healing in the word as in Sim and without me taking the time as an assembly we have been laboring and preaching in these promises from back in the back in the December time going promise after promise where God would tell us in the book of Proverbs chapter four it spoke of how that not only would his word be health to our soul but it's health to our body he told us to take that word in he told us and that and the Lord that he loved me he let us know yes sickness will come but I'm the Lord that heals you he told us in Exodus 23 I will bless your bread and your water thank God for that consume and there's a lot of junk in our bread and water but he said I'll bless your bread and water if we look to him and said Lord all things on a busy brief Thanksgiving in prayer amen I will bless your bread and water and I will take sickness from among you amen and Deuteronomy 7 he reiterates Exodus 15 we find description as a of 53 by His stripes we were healed is that right in the very center of the Bible Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that's within me forget not his benefits who forgiveth thee of all thine iniquities who healeth e of all thy diseases we have the promise and songs and Mandy one but when the pestilence or whatever would come don't be afraid Amen we have the promise as it proceeds on down that Nina not show any plague come nigh thy dwelling oh where is it be safe in Jesus Christ we have a promise and if we are in Christ in crash every promise is yay and amen and this is why but the word that God has sent to you and I in this our remember what Paul said it shall be even as it was told unto me God has come in this hour and confirmed his word his presence that indeed he's the same yesterday today and forever on the constant war and the unchangeable God every promise I made it is sure all these are the sure mercies of David and this is why the Prophet could stand there in the message perfect faith and he'll talk about the vision of the little boy in Finland and how the vision was announced years before it ever took place are you with me now when brother Branham was standing there and he came upon that little boy remember how brother Bram tells it he doesn't know that it's that vision he walks around and he says to brother Jack morning he says it's the place kind of seems familiar he's looking at the background or the setting of it still doesn't know but it isn't until after they pull back the blanket dozin asked him to read on the Flyleaf that brother Branham makes this statement he said there wasn't a demon out of hell that could have stopped that little going from raising up let me tell you there's not a demon out of hell that can stop or hinder the word of the Lord sayeth the Lord is sure I am sure it shall be even as it was told me this is why and that's in that message brother Ram said the vision that has come forth he said death couldn't hold that little boy he said that was God speaking through a vision and he picks up the Bible he says this is more than the vision he says if this word if this word has told you something then you can have the same confidence then what's going to happen you understand God you and move through that of a profit there was a message that was to be delivered in this hour to restore the same faith to the Saints of the Living God to restore that same Bible faith not for people to believe in the Bible people already did believe in the Bible a good Baptist will believe in the Bible they can now quote many of you but that's not what it is it's to have the same Bible faith because it is the same life of God that would be operating in the Church of the Living God and that's where brother Branham would take us in this part with Paul he said Paul was so charged full of the Holy Ghost and he said oh God may he have a church in the end time that's so charged with the Holy Ghost what brings the charge of the Holy Ghost oh brother it ain't a key of G on the music it ain't that at all what brings the charge of the Holy Ghost in the church is the real baptism of the Holy Ghost that is poured out through the revelation of a word it brings a charge in that life where that life can never be the same again it is transformed by the power of Almighty God this is what it does to you so then we've got promises we'll go to Santa when I'm praying for my wife or I'm praying for my husband I just need a direct word from the Lord you've got it right here has this been made alive to you now we don't maybe you don't have direction or direct such as within so many days they're going to raise up but you can't make that happen anyhow but the thing that we can do and show such great respect and admiration to the Lord is to take him at his word that's the greatest compliment that we can take a promise of God and stand there and say Lord I don't need a special vision to let me know that this is for me I'm one of your children I'm born of the very life I am from your loins I the royal seat of Abraham there is a covenant that you have made with me there are promises that you've given me now this situation is before us and I go in the name of the Lord to meet this uncircumcised devil oh yes when we pray for the sick we're not we're not coming out with just hope no we're praying with faith they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the pair of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up we can have confidence that's what the real working of the Holy Spirit does it brings confidence back in the word now faith and they just bring this down that don't mean I'm stopping faith doesn't make us act irresponsible God told Israel I've given you the land but there was a pathway in an order you see faith has to find the course even when God had told Joshua there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life this is why when Joshua was out seeking for the will of the Lord concerning Joshua Jericho it was not the mid you say to you like this it was not a question whether Jericho was going to be overthrown that's not what he was praying about Lord are you gonna but it was not the prayer he was going to seek the will of God in that situation this is the leadership of Joshua the Holy Spirit moving through the adopted sons and daughters of God what the maturity is is not us running errantly on our own leadings no the charity is where we recognize I can do nothing without him I do nothing but what I see the father doing first then that doeth the son likewise so he told Joshua with this and I said as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee so Joshua's faith was settled in the Lord and he sucked look what this happened he sought the counsel of the word through Eliezer in every situation if you recall in in in in in the scripture I think it's in numbers 27 and where God gives a direction in numbers 27 is numbers odd numbers 27 where he gives the direction of there shall be a man that shall go out before Israel he's telling Moses put some of your honor upon him that the children of Israel might have that of you know the confidence and he and he shall not go forth without conferring with that of the Urim to Mum and that of Eleazar the priest see within this of the leadership of the spiritual joshula just not operate and say I've got the message of Moses I can just do what I want no but the spiritual Joshua recognizes authority and leadership you see the Roman centurion the reason the word could have an effect is because he can recognize when he was standing in the presence of one who had a greater authority for a present situation it was not that Jesus was a great learned military man this guy was a great learn military man but he said I'm a man under Authority I know what it means to say go and they go come and they come and what was he doing he was recognizing there is aware that is present that can address the certain situations and that's exactly what the spiritual Joshua does that has been brought into the land of promise by one spirit we are baptized into this body it recognizes we must be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit not our feelings not our leadings but under his leading that's victory this is why brother Brown would say that a man that's been able to conquer himself out of humble thyself a man that's been able to conquer himself has more power than the man that would run and scream all over the building but the RAM was not in dealing away you know what worship what he's talking about is the greatness of humility is being able to conquer ourselves Oh glory do you realize Jesus oh my I'm a priest can I preach this for a few moments well there's not enough of you here to stop me and you better not turn me off either but Jesus notice how the Lord Jesus in humility the Bible says he humbled himself unto death and became obedient even until the death of the cross notice became obedient unto the death of the cross he prayed brother Ram would tell us in souls in prison now Jesus prayed to dodge the cross is that right he knew as he said in John 12 now is my heart traveled right here he felt the encroachment of fear coming around because of the death not because of who he was but because of what he knew awaited but remember here he was willing to drink his cup do you realize what that means Jesus did not go - did not go to Calvary because he was sick of living are you with me he did not lose his will to live that's not what he went to Calvary he loved the sunsets brother Ram told us he loved the sunsets he loved his brother and he loved that fellowship that communion he had with him but he knew in order to bring about the perfect oneness and real true communion there had to be an all sufficient sacrifice that the life inside of that blood might come in them and bring them in him that they might be one even as high and my father are one so that they would be he did not go because he was I'm tired of living I'll tell you this world that would have been a selfish reason he did not take his life because he was tired you know what what's the use of living no that's not what Calvary was or girl would be to God you know and it goes to show you and I let me preach a little bit if the enemy is trying to snatch away from you the joy of living you've got a right as a son and daughter of God because our husband the Lord Jesus Christ he never went to Calvary and defeated the devil because he was tired of living he went to Calvary he endured for the joy that was set before him made God by the Spirit of God come into your heart and renew the joy there's a reason to live the reason is more than your job it's more than your family although they need you but there is more than that there is that to serve the Lord and to be available to God and a let the joys of the Lord enter into your life so Satan is telling you there's no use I say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ get behind me Satan you rebuke him he came that we might have life and have it more abundantly when they came to the note you know even in the land that had to be under that leadership pride is what calls some of the men who went and spied out AI the next city so we don't need to take everybody there don't don't don't throw them don't trouble everybody it wasn't because everybody that they won matter of fact there wasn't everybody that did Jericho it was God but God wanted everybody in the same March God wanted everybody in time the God had wanted everybody get back in step God wanted everybody in step but what caused that to where men see see how sin would pervade there in the body what did it do it caused him a sin of pride would cause them to say we don't need to we don't need that much see what they were looking at they were going back on and they were leaning back on a word instead of making sure that their heart was in line with a God who gave the word then when their heart is in line their spirits in line their minds in line their attitudes in life when everything's in line with the God who gave the word then the word will come to pass now the Bible says here in acts 28 1 and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called Malita and the barbarous people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us everyone because of the present reign and because of the cold and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand isn't it incredible this beast could have bit Paul and nobody else would have saw it but God let it be declared in the presence of them all this venomous Viper was hanging on his hand when he had raised it up they said among themselves no doubt this man's a murderer whom though he have to escape the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live and he shipped off the Beast into the fire and felt no harm howbeit they looked when he should have noticed the natural inclination of hope who against hope who the hope was when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly I wonder if they were just all sitting around like this y'all got room in your your place to bury see this is what the natural course would have been these individuals and Milito are the multis people they understood this when this type of a bite took place by this Viper that this is what's going to happen the band's gonna swell up you know a fixation things through the nervous system and they're gonna fall dead this was the expectation but little did they know that this was not his end there was a greater power that was working in Paul's body than the power of just his natural immune system there was a greater power Paul had been shot up with the vaccination of the holy ghost brother he was immune to anything there is nothing that could touch his life until the purpose of God had been fulfilled he knew that there is nothing present nor anything to come should have fallen dead suddenly but after they looked a great while and so no harm come to him they changed their mind and said this was a God notice lowercase G little did they know indeed he was he was a son of God redeemed by the blood of the Lamb and Alou you think of this now here the scripture now let's look here Paul himself this was not spelled out in every part of the vision are you with me now he was spelled out you're going to stand before Caesar what that let him know is they're going to be shipwrecked and you're going to stand before Caesar but he did not know of all of the things that would come in between but you know what he didn't worry about it because he was walking in the one who was Alpha and Omega he's walking in the a man which is the Soviet of God so here Paul would have a confidence within the word think of it the pulsation of the word within his life remember the Great Commission was given to that of the apostles they were they were there holding that revelation by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in their life and they themselves there would be a dispersing or a taking of the gospel we understand that there had to be some persecution that would arise in Jerusalem to actually cause it to further disperse and bring that that gospel into other people's lands and among other people and yet we also know that that happened the Apostles and how that they would go packing that a gospel it was to bring the good news but yet it did not mean that within what they were carrying though it was the good news though it was a present reality though indeed they were men of God who had been born of the Spirit of Almighty God yet there would they still were walking in a body that was still waiting to be redeemed there would be times and situations that they would come up on as Paul would recall in many times he would call it perils P er ILS many perils at times where your hunger and thirsty and your you know beaten and shipwrecked three times and on and on that Paul would speak about now notice this is what Jesus said in mark 16 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues sad thing about it is I think we only think about this terms of Scripture if there's only a case that arises of this sickness but you realize when you pray over your food you're casting out Devils I'm not just talking about from the grocery store but from a lot of these individuals no Doubt's have been serving and cooking our food for a long time come on somebody I mean a lot of these things when things that I've been studying here for over the past week and weeks and so forth you find that a lot of things even in Europe there was a lot of things because of the uncleanness among the people now notice this in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh my in Psalms 91 13 now she'll tread upon the lion and the adder the young lion and the dragon shall trample underfoot I always think a brother Daniel you know when he would give this example in the camp meetings he would say some were called some are sent and some just packed up their bags and wind what this is speaking of is to know God has purposed when he let him know you're gonna walk through some places but I want you to know I'm with you you might get snake-bitten but you've got an anti-venom you got an anti-venom you are right in the center of my will he didn't tell us that every circumstance surrounding would be perfect nor was he advising them to act carelessly are you with me this is why brother Branham when he's asked the question you know there's a person that asked brother Branham a question about the snake handlers oh man my dad preached at one of those Church one time he said he couldn't figure out why in the world when he preached on mark 16 he said they like the tour the house down he said I knew I seen some boxes sitting up here he said I don't know what the box is worried you know thought they were offering tithing boxes or whatever more kind of glad they didn't open them things but notice the rambling sound like this he said now if we try to tempt the Lord into something we're in for it he said I don't think the Lord means for us to get a bottle of arsenic and see if we could drink it to prove that we got faith he said no more than you bring me a snake and I pick it up that it would show you that I have faith he said to what I do believe is if I am baptizing people or doing the work of the Lord or out in the jungle and the snake bit me I'd walk right on in the name of the Lord I believe that's what it meant see brother Adam you know he would go on and he would tell us he said now you know I don't believe in tempting God or push trying to push God into anything but Paul when he got bit he just shook it off I mean you know it's just as simple as this right here I know that God is my healer but I still got health insurance yeah I don't know how many individuals you know at times has told me brother Sammy can you tell me about that plan you got because truly if something happens to me it'll really sink me the reality is is because the cost of it all it takes is one situation we're not promised of they'll never be any situation we're not promised that we can't put things together and say this is no you can't do that God and Trust these things to us it's just like you know I've heard where people who individuals will would leave their doors open and I would often I looked at Maleficent well I said I you know I think we live in an ok and said community I said but ain't no way in the world I'll leave my door open no way Wow luck it we don't you don't you trust God I do trust God but God trusts me with what he's entrusted to me come on somebody it's just like I trust God that God's gonna keep my automobile my outermost bill is gonna last they don't mean that I don't take it for regular maintenance of oil change and tire rotation and do the other stuff come on now that God ain't gonna do that for me God ain't going to come down and say same they don't worry I got your house buddy I'll lock it for you know God has entrusted that to me there is a responsibility that's given to me it's just like in the washing of my hands oh brother Samuel there you go getting carnal now I'm not getting carnal I'm just being real this is laid out in the scripture for us clear back in the Book of Leviticus faith does not act in a manner of irresponsible he just shook it off he shook off the snake he wasn't all excited now this is where I want to draw you down to he wasn't all excited in its head oh lord help me help me help me to do it Lord he wasn't but neither did he say bring me that snake he never tempted God this is what I love but he had faith in God to overcome the snake bite just say it like this you know very well like brother [Music] Giovanna Prakash they sent me pictures even you know yet where they're working in the leper colony he'd been doing that for years on end nobody could walk in there and say be close brother Prakash goes in the leper colony I'll go in the leper colony you better know God's tending you in there if God sends you there he'll keep you are you with me you better know what you're doing you cannot go out that's why the scripture said thou shall not tempt the Lord amen because when God leads you somewhere it isn't that there ain't gonna be pearls and things come your way just like sometimes when you've been overseas and sickness would come our way but God said I'll give you faith to overcome it you know brother Branham was quick to say it he said I'm not saying those people don't got faith he said they can drink a saline and arsenic he said they drink it and they go right on he said they got faith but he said don't prove nothing and don't prove nothing bill Simon what are you saying where I just say it like this if I know there was a whole place where a bunch of people had the coronavirus guess what I wouldn't go well brother Sam you don't have faith no I have wisdom remember what Martin Luther Omaha had one plan on sharing this today but Martin Luther said in the time when the plague hit the area in Europe he said I shall fumigate the place I shall take all necessary medicine I shall avoid others and I myself will be sure not to go where others are that I might infect them or they might infect me and Martin Luther said this is a god-fearing faith for it does not act recklessly so don't prove anything Oh huh so brother Samuel what would you do if somebody sees so help me Jesus find the next hour of the story it's not out of fear because these bodies these bodies are still under the curse of sin but brother Ram said you just be real sweet humble Christian and live the life and then God will take care of the rest of it this is why brother Branham would make this statement and I've got got to labor on a couple of these points this is why he would make the statement in the message to token and he deals with this thought of how he says we and knew us and the word had become one husband and wife have been united together he said then when the word we and the word become one he said then every promise belongs to us it obeys you when they win you say to the hand hand go it'll be you he said but then you want to watch what you do you would want to put your hand in a fire just to say see me do it oh no but if there is something in that fire I got to reach for it it'll obey me see not reaching in the fire because I'm going to prove and I have got faith in this time no no that's not faith faith will always act in humility and accordance with the Word of God but faith remember what they think there's not something that's just loose and haphazard faith finds the perfect will of God and moves in it if there is something in that fire I got a reach for it it'll obey me you see you want to watch what you're doing may God help us may God help us I'll tell you if there's one thing about it I think you know that I know there's many in the Assembly they're already very cautious and I and I appreciate all that and one thing about it it's just even taught me to be a little bit more cautious on things we can be a little bit more cautious on things and take certain precautions and take take things some things a little bit more seriously and I'll talking about worry I'm not talking about fear I'm talking about where faith is operating in the right direction now this is where the scripture and I really am I'm trying to bring this down here this is where the Scriptures deal we're here in in first John 4:17 here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world just as he is seated in power and authority he by the Holy Spirit the word is seated in power and authority over sin in our lives we are a reflection on earth what he is in the heavens is that right the moon is the reflection of all the Sun is in its absence so we have a boldness in judgment we already know we have passed from death unto life and I say for everybody that's what you have to know that is indeed when your love is made complete there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love notice notice the dividing of fear paul had no fear in terms of security in his salvation but to know what is going to be the outcome in this situation he did not know that but he looked to the lord who gave direction in a presence that you're a situation that was not conducive for a time of prayer if we would look at it in a natural funneled out here was I mean the boats rocking and not only take the boats Rocking Paul's happen to battle beyond all of his mind is that right but you see there's an atmosphere but Paul was able vibe from that charge of the Holy Spirit in his life was able by the grace of God to move in that situation now you see where here we are now look we've got to go out and I'm going to say this to you the reason I believe the Lord would lay this so heavily upon my heart because whatever day that they would hit the resume button and then they would say that it would be you know good or it would be fine for us to be able to congregate together again I believe these things apply just as much as I believe that there's things that we can do a little bit better on as people and become a little bit more alert on I think if there's one thing about it if somebody hasn't been a faithful hand washer before I hope to goodness that you're a faithful hand washer now because you can be a carrier I mean let me just tell you right quick there's not been the first time that you might say well brothers saying how could that be at a church dinner hey brothers and sisters I know of a church dinner it was a big old meeting and people had the church dinner and everybody there got sick message Church or a church that was under it you see it didn't anyone just being it was something within the food however the food was cooked for one or more brother Sammy does that make you concerned do you worry that no I don't worry I've known that for years but I do believe that within wares of many things were ignorant of and I thank God for it but I do believe that we have to apply ourselves take necessary precautions I believe it's very very important we see yesterday where our governor actually he didn't he said I can't enforce it but he has put it in place he recommended right now he said if you ain't doing streaming for your churches you need to be doing it or whatever he said don't be coming together because they just do as a church that just got quite a bit of it but here's what here's what it is and for somebody to take to think well we're in the message that now did that that I mean the cancer comes and other things come and so forth and on and on and on and on and on the reason that notice the reason that things would bring a scare the reason that it hurts like Bill Graham talks about he said when you're frying your egg of a morning and he said the grease pops out of the skillet he said the first thing you do is reach for that bottle to settle it he said but remember it's not the grease that burns you it's the fear so God doesn't want us to walk in fear notice that Viper latched on to Paul's hand when Paul here he was he didn't even know it he cuz he felt no harm he left off he felt no harm there was that of the word that was present to combat that situation there was a perfect love that was present that could overthrow that fear that's why brother Ram could say when that grease pops on you he said you're full of the Holy Ghost he said but if you left he said fear that's when Satan steps in this is where perfect love cast him out oh this is an hour of casting him out this is an hour where he's to be he's to be cast out for God hath not given us a spirit of fear but a power of love and of a sound mind so we thank God for His mercy he delivers us from the confusion of not knowing who we are but to know who we are you see with knowing who we are and this is where brother brand deals with in that part of the quote knowing who we are it brings an atmosphere and the situate creates by the brem says you're the one who creates the situation then it's an atmosphere that's created now much that we could say about that with our minds about what we're giving ourselves to but I think it would be fitting in this time and I rather than put this off till Thursday I thought it would begin just press of the Lord to go ahead with us today and that's why I was bringing it God knows our needs he knows that no doubt that there's there has been those that's come in contact with people that's had this virus and to know that sometimes that can be where the enemy can try to play upon that upon people's minds and we understand that and we realize that has nothing to do with who we are as a son and daughter of God but this is where that I'll tell you I'll tell you to be honest with you I think this is a time when I look at this island that they were cast on when you look at what took place there was more healings that took place after this because the people saw the working of the Lord after this they wintered there for three months they were stranded on this island is that right you know an island is a place that's surrounded by water it's separated from the mainland and God has a way in times like this of bringing us on an island he said you know I want to just separate you unto myself a little bit now I know and I thank God that really for our church right here we've not been touched like other churches when it's come to the workforce because there's some churches right now in the states in the states that have really been touched that their churches have been really the people in there or out of work they don't have the and I think one thing for all of us that are able to work some of you are able I know they've given you permission to go into your some of you to your job in your office and work others of you there's been so many that have went to their stay at home and they work from home I tell you what in all these things we need to be thankful we need to be thankful because we're learning we're certainly not better no more than anybody else God don't love us any better than anybody else he loves all his children but we just want to be thankful to the Lord and be mindful and keep them in prayer in those different states and you know some of those are in where the hot spots are right now in those areas but you see nonetheless this is an island of opportunity it's an island of opportunity that where and and I would say it very clearly please don't tune me out at this time if this is one thing out of this all set your heart in a course that I'm going to get closer to God don't feel your time your time with idleness don't feel it with the same old stuff don't fill it up with more junk but let let let it be more time that and I know as I said some people are still I think I just talked with you know some different ones some brothers are still going into their places of employment and different ones you know that I know of and I understand that not everybody maybe they they don't have their hours or as so forth hasn't changed but I would say that regardless if it's one over it's two or if it's throughout the family let us take this island of opportunity that that we have been cast upon because remember it was an island that John was cast upon and John was on that island he said I am your brother now we know that John was cast upon that Island the Isle of Patmos it was not it was simply as it was it wasn't notice John never said it's because that they thought I was a religious fanatic or they thought I was a nut John did not even mention their accusations John said I'm here on this island for the word of the Lord the patience of Jesus Christ that's why I'm here and to a believer we know why we're all not the island called Malita but we are on this island we're gone all the way through the Scriptures we're gone even when he came down into and to Egypt he wanted to bring his people out on a three days journey in the book of Hosea chapter 2 speaking of Israel even of her time that's coming there in that of the 144,000 but yet it still applies I will allure her into the wilderness that I might speak comfortably with her God uses these times when the nation of Israel was in a time of distress famine was upon the land yet there was a little woman in therapist who was sustained she was part of the vision there was a man by the name of Elijah he never had any want for food as a matter of fact he didn't have ever he didn't have ready eats he didn't have all that he had something better he had that of the crows to deliver his sandwiches believe me it was without money or price and the menu was just what was needed in that hour hold there's an oncoming storm on the horizon oh he could look here's another one ever-present water from the rock KOCO repeated on there was that which was delivered to him in that time we are cast on an island of opportunity and we know our destiny that's the question for every one of you do you know your destiny you might be on this island of opportunity right now but this might be the opportunity for you to fully surrender your life to God and really get serious and say you know what I'm not making excuses no more I'm not just saying well I don't understand all this you know the message and I understand this but you know what I just no no ask God to reveal it to you say God help me to die to myself he requires obedience to his word get down and obey his word ask God to take the love of the world out of your life let it be a time than when they were on the ship getting rid of things like we talked about on Thursday night let it be a time where there's things of baggage that you've been carrying for years it might not be sin per se it might be grudges and hard feelings and unforgiveness and this and that get rid of it it doesn't matter it's weighing down the ship this is an island of opportunity that we've been cast upon to draw closer to the Lord spend more time in prayer with God not just until the quarantine is over but make a real declaration within our let it be something in our heart and I believe you we begin to see my I've been allowing the enemy to take things away from me that belong to me there's promises to be obtained in this hour you see we're not just looking as a people of God well I I wonder when this is going to return back to normal I wonder when we can get back to normal you know pharaoh had that attitude over and over and I'm not gonna preach on that today but favor always had that oh I've had old attitude Oh take it away and huh we've sinned we've done wrong soon as God removed it he was back to his old ways again they want to be like Pharaoh you want to get on the winning side you want to make sure you get in the ship with all your heart soul mind body and strength don't just give God your strength God wants more than just ya coming to church God wants more than just an association around this message you can't take any other way any other way it's like getting on a lifeboat well I'll just you know I'd do a lot for the church you know I help out you know the brothers are I open the door or I do this that's a lifeboat you need to get in the ship and say God fully baptized me in the body you don't have to depend on what you do for the church or I'll do this or I do that you don't have to depend on that because that is not salvation there is only one name that you can be saved and that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is a known place that salvation is in and salvation is of the Lord and in the midst of this time it's a time to really consecrate ourselves because listen not to show back up when the doors resume and you show up with the same dragging and bagging and lugging around the same things you've been lugging around up and down and in and out and do I have it or don't I have it or do it this or do i dad or do our this it's time to release that baggage it's time to get anchored in Jesus Christ I say it from the bottom of my heart we're given a time this island is an island of opportunity brother Samuel I want to spend more time with my family we ought to huddle him up right next to us let them know of the promise let them know there's a greater plague than coronavirus that's already been going through the land hey man that goth angels already been going through the land spiritual death is moving in church after church after church but yet death no life medalists may win not may god help us have a balance i i'd give this unction from my heart within it that our hearts not be charged with foolishness let it not be filled up with more things that bring emptiness and bring more unbelief and invite fear but you need to be filled with the love of God you need to keep yourself as joob said Joseph building up yourself your most holy faith keeping yourself in the Holy Ghost the love of God amen this is an hour of great consecration of great seriousness I believe that was on my heart that's my prayer God turn every life upside down I prayed this for every Ford if the ones that I can know and so forth and so on god I don't care what you got to do take peace lord until it's a full surrender lead them to a place of desperation to where they're willing to die to themselves and be born anew in Jesus Christ they don't know that you're the only place of safety Lord God bring them to that place of humility where they're willing to lay down their own will I tell you that's how we ought to be praying in this hour we ought to be desperate with that for our children ought to be desperate for one another how to beat this is an hour of desperation it's an hour to look there is a certainty of on coming judgement and mean that's every man and woman boy and girl must know whether standing in Jesus Christ amen to be certain that you are in the coming of the Lord amen don't let your millet yourself be consumed with knowing the ins and outs I'm not saying to be ignorant there can be things that we can know about the virus there's a lot of things that I've study that goes beyond that in this past week with with things that's been dealing that different ones down through the ages have dealt with have just been in steady on that it's not to be ignorant of it but neither are we to be consumed with it don't let it be everything you talk about and everything you hear and everything this and everything that well I can't help it it's all over my post then you might need to defriend or you might need to get rid of that note we've got a choice what we're going to submerse ourselves in we submerse ourselves in the things of god it brings life it brings strength it brings stability it brings hope and I believe with all my heart this is the hour as we're living in this time we need to take this opportunity that we have we need to make good use of it amen may God my heart's desire is that it'll make hearts and lives more appreciative I've come into the house of God you know make more of a determination to come to the house of God than it is to use an excuse and and when the reality of it is I'm preaching straight from my heart you know when things are an excuse but don't make your soul don't make excuses for that come to the supper come and eat of the Word of God it'll give you strength it'll give you overcoming power it will bring to you that everlasting life amen be of good cheer the Lord is in full control and I just say very clearly if you don't know the Lord or if you've been coming here to the church or maybe somebody listening in and not even a part of this you make sure your life is right with God and if it's not right with God you don't have to wait till the quarantines over there's been a quarantine that's already been broke through Calvary the blood cell was broke that can bring you in where we were isolated and kept off from the blessings and promises of God but now through him by the ringing of the veil the Holy Spirit brings us in what we were isolated or quarantined off from but now we can have access into the presence of Almighty God what do I have to do obedience and obedience begins with repent and if you've repented the next thing is be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you say I can't get to the water right there but God knows your heart you let your heart be aligned with God and that's what even repentance is and obedience goes even as I've told the young people on Friday night it's the simple little things you do it's not just coming to church that's part of it but it's about you obeying the Word of God it's about reading the Word of God it's about praying it ain't about the quantity it's the quality make yourself available Oh let's pray let's pray father how think for we our Lord oh we're so grateful we have that resting abiding peace and you know your God we're trusting in you then as you would give us leadership direction in this our Lord we realize that you speak and give us a counsel also within your word Lord I pray that you would help us to be even more sensitive more more sensitive to even those things that you've put in our hands to control there's things Lord Jesus that you've put in our hands for us to do nobody else can do it for us we have to do it there's things that we can pray and ask you for because widows in the way in the world we can do it or anybody else can do it but you're able to do it so lord help us help us as we walk in this life even from the simplest of things about our life help us to recognize the Lord you've placed us here with the care for things Lord help us the Lord God I pray that Lord in the midst of the time in the hour we know that Lord even when we would come back together Lord whenever that time would be I don't know but I'm certain Lord that there will be things that maybe we would be a little bit more cautious which is not altogether it's not bad at all it's not a lack of faith that we would wash our hands or or we would make sure if we're running a temperature that we make sure we're not going to come to the house of God if we're sick deathly sick or something like that we understand that Lord we're not proving our faith to anybody the Lord I'm also aware that when that time would come as your children even before we come back together in together in the church even as we're going out to the stores different appointments that different ones have to go to treatments that they they are in the middle of Lourdes were walking our faith is in you we're not going out and doing anything because we are proving that will nothing can touch me no that would not be faith that would be tempting you but Lord when we come back together again when that comes about I'm certain Lord God that there will be thoughts and different things that could come or come our way maybe Lord depending on where things itself and where the virus where it would be pervading or whatever more maybe there would be some Lord that would make certain decisions would we think any less of them not one bit not one bit all over asking for Lord is you would help us in the midst of this time because one thing that we know Lord God that when you've given us true faith true faith will never run down the actions of somebody else it just rests in you so Lord we thank you for that Lord we just we ask Lord that you would guide us Lord we're thankful for the vision of the word then Lord that we are seated in oh god I just I thank you for this peace Lord God you've provided I know I'm not the only one that can say this but you've provided or Jesus more than what Lord God who could ever imagine Lord you are faithful help us or Jesus help us we need you Lord we need your strength I pray that God is I pray every hour Lord Jesus help them help the medical professionals help the medical science Lord help those the Lord God that are trying to look and bring things together for a cure yes we know we know Lord we know for certain that that you are the answer but Lord I'm looking also dear God if there's something Lord that can help the rest of humanity we'd want to help a lord I pray for them lord I pray for those on the front lines we've got many setting right here Lord or are a part of this congregation they're right on the front lines working in hospitals nursing homes different ones Lord that on the front lines some of them working Lord God right on the actual unit that is over this virus Lord I pray God that you would just keep your hand upon them Lord strengthen them Lord protect them I pray that Lord God watch over each and every one of us Lord Lord we're trusting in you we love you Lord we have this promise Lord in your word promise after promise you've given us what as we look into it today may we take that same faith within this word knowing we can have the same confidence in the Word of God Lord I pray this morning you know how to speak in situations in needs you've done it right here time and time again we're different once lord have been like Paul was they were on that third day in all hopes was gone that they would be saved lord I pray this morning any hope that's been diminished may you restore it with a personal visitation Lord just like you visited Paul may you personally visit your children Lord as they stand in need the Lord we would just ask that even as we would depart God as each and every one would go we ask that Lord you would just continue to keep your hand upon us we're trusting in you Father what a rest there is in you lord our course is certain and I pray God for every soul that's listening or will listen may they make their
