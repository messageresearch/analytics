[1:21] discourage them but
[1:23] look what god did god came and he drew

[1:41] battling on
[1:42] but what it was it was a supernatural
[1:44] god he could not get away from a god
[1:47] that had touched his life
[1:48] right there in blue sky where we had a
[1:51] prayer meeting
[1:54] he knew there's a living god there's a
[1:56] real god
[2:00] god came down and god did the work
[2:04] in that life
[2:08] that's a testimony where you can stand
[2:10] and say you might look at your life and
[2:12] say
[2:12] i still got this and i still got that
[2:14] but don't you
[2:15] make allowances for it say i'm gonna
[2:18] stand upon this word
[2:19] i want jesus christ to be so identified
[2:23] in my life
[2:27] amen
[2:34] hallelujah
[2:41] whosoever be ashamed of me and of my
[2:44] words
[2:45] in this generation my words in this
[2:47] generation
[2:49] living word whoever's ashamed of it he
[2:51] said i'll be ashamed of you
[2:53] amen because this word is him
[3:00] well if i lived in the days of noah
[3:01] you'd be standing with christ today
[3:05] remember if i was back there with peter
[3:06] you'd be standing with christ today
[3:09] let me just tell you right now you'd be
[3:11] standing
[3:12] with brother branham the prophet
[3:18] [Applause]
[3:22] the messenger and the message are one in
[3:24] the same way
[3:30] hallelujah
[3:36] don't everybody's getting nervous you
[3:37] gonna call me out next i didn't have it
[3:39] on my heart to even think i didn't think
[3:40] about that
[3:41] but god god wanted that there's somebody
[3:44] here that needed that
[3:46] amen there's somebody here that needed
[3:48] that or maybe that will stream this
[3:50] service
[3:50] somebody needed that somebody that maybe
[3:53] is at the point of saying
[3:55] what's the use you're about ready to
[3:57] echo what the devil
[3:58] is trying to whisper to you but let me
[4:00] tell you something what you see
[4:02] is not the strength of man and a woman
[4:05] you see the strength of god taking hold
[4:07] on that life all they had to do was
[4:09] surrender
[4:10] to the power that was dealing with their
[4:13] life
[4:14] to bring them across that dividing line
[4:21] the greeks came to jesus they came to
[4:24] philip we want to see jesus
[4:33] they came and they looked at him
[4:39] they heard about him they heard about
[4:42] him
[4:43] remember what are greeks they're given
[4:45] to wisdom
[4:47] what paul said they got to figure
[4:48] everything out
[4:50] wisdom and figure it all out they looked
[4:53] at him
[4:55] he's just a man you're right
[4:58] he is a man but it's what's behind the
[5:01] man
[5:04] it was god in the man
[5:08] brother bram said what it was it was god
[5:09] in the form of man he said now be real
[5:10] careful right here
[5:12] he's the same yesterday today and
[5:13] forever
[5:16] god came in the form
[5:19] of jesus christ to redeem us are you
[5:22] with me
[5:23] god borrowed the form of william branham
[5:25] to come and deliver the word to you and
[5:27] i
[5:28] yeah while the rest of the world
[5:31] said he just like any other preacher he
[5:34] just like any other man
[5:35] miracles oh you know listen my dad was
[5:38] my dad preached back in pentecost i
[5:40] wasn't i don't
[5:41] wasn't alive i don't remember that time
[5:43] but my dad when he came to the message
[5:45] this was not the first time he saw
[5:46] miracles
[5:47] but there were miracles and when dad
[5:48] would go around and preaching you know
[5:50] 10 20 nights straight going around
[5:52] throughout the hills and preaching
[5:53] revivals he saw people getting up off of
[5:55] bed
[5:55] saw cops now i understand what i'm
[5:57] trying to say is that there was
[5:59] something that was greater than just
[6:00] signs and wonders there was a longing
[6:02] inside of my dad's heart
[6:04] he knew there's more he began to see
[6:06] there's things that's not right
[6:08] in that of the organization it was a
[6:10] longing that was on the inside of him
[6:12] it was longing for the word
[6:15] [Applause]
[6:18] don't misunderstand me like i said on
[6:19] thursday night there ain't never been
[6:21] another ministry
[6:22] that's been close to the ministry of
[6:24] brother branham
[6:27] i'm just trying to tell you signs and
[6:29] miracles and wonders
[6:30] that is not in itself what caught benny
[6:35] and for some that's all they saw they
[6:38] never caught the revelation
[6:39] of who it was so when somebody else rose
[6:43] up on miracles
[6:46] followed it's to recognize
[6:49] jesus christ to recognize this word
[6:52] that god would deliver to our lives and
[6:55] still notice what jesus said
[6:58] just bring this down here
[7:02] jesus said except a corn of wheat
[7:06] right fall into the ground
[7:12] die in a bottle alone
[7:18] he was not only speaking to them
[7:21] and letting them know of the mystery of
[7:24] god the
[7:25] outpouring of the holy spirit that would
[7:27] move down
[7:28] how that from that one from that
[7:32] one seed that would come forth the life
[7:35] to water the other seeds
[7:39] it was much it was more than that
[7:41] brother brandon picks that up an
[7:42] unwrangling of god
[7:44] he said the word was speaking to them
[7:47] for their life except
[7:51] you die you abide alone
[7:56] all right you see it's a terrible
[7:59] condition to be alone
[8:03] sometimes you can be in the midst of a
[8:05] crowded gathering
[8:07] and you feel
[8:12] walking down malls or wherever they're
[8:14] called nowadays whatever
[8:18] you can walk all the way and walk around
[8:20] there you're not there with your
[8:23] friend or somebody serving the lord with
[8:26] you
[8:27] wife husband so forth he feels all alone
[8:31] because there's other people that's
[8:33] there but
[8:35] you need something deeper there's a
[8:36] deeper fellowship than just people amen
[8:41] you could have your wife or you could
[8:42] have your husband but there's something
[8:44] about it
[8:45] when you're connected you have somebody
[8:48] who shares the same desire
[8:52] that you share that's where you can find
[8:55] fellowship are you with me
[8:59] you can you can walk down through there
[9:01] and you can feel all alone
[9:04] but the thing that jesus was trying to
[9:06] let him know
[9:08] if you don't die die to yourself
[9:11] die to your own thoughts die to your own
[9:13] ideas you remain alone
[9:16] but with that death it makes a way now
[9:19] how can we get there
[9:20] we can't on our own that's right are you
[9:23] with me
[9:24] it isn't that you know that that jesus
[9:26] comes comes down
[9:28] i'm gonna borrow you for a minute it
[9:31] isn't that jesus comes down and goes
[9:33] like this and says come on paul
[9:34] i want you to come up here with me come
[9:36] up here with me once you come up here
[9:37] with me
[9:38] you're going to come and go with me
[9:40] jesus is not
[9:42] a wrestler
[9:45] well i got your shirt all wet man
[9:50] but this is what he does
[9:54] hey i've been noticing you
[9:58] there's some things that there's a
[10:00] desire
[10:02] i see within you i see within your life
[10:07] you say that's right he starts getting
[10:10] closer
[10:12] finally he says you want that desire to
[10:15] become a reality in your life
[10:18] come follow me give me your hand
[10:22] and he leads us into the place
[10:25] amen of life
[10:35] thank you so don't mistake it when when
[10:38] god is speaking
[10:40] and there's things that he's dealing
[10:41] with sometimes it seems like oh
[10:43] that's very harsh or this is calling out
[10:45] it ain't god is angry with you
[10:48] god's putting the devil on notice
[10:51] you can't have my son you can't have my
[10:55] daughter
[10:56] you know what he's calling out there's
[10:57] something within you he's calling out to
[10:59] that character
[11:00] that's on the inside there's a character
[11:04] that he wants to express all of our
[11:06] strength
[11:07] all of our struggles will never express
[11:09] it
[11:10] but when he comes he's the one that
[11:13] brings
[11:14] forth that character that's down on the
[11:17] inside
[11:18] he leads us out
[11:28] amen i'm going to read this because the
[11:30] holy spirit had me put this down
[11:32] yesterday
[11:37] this is the same longing that rises in
[11:40] the heart of the believer
[11:42] when the comforter is revealing himself
[11:44] to be the same god today
[11:47] that i am your satisfier i
[11:50] am your thirst quencher i am your desire
[11:54] i am the fountain of life that
[11:56] transforms your life from a dry
[11:59] parched ground of barrenness to a place
[12:01] lush
[12:02] with the glory of god i am your portion
[12:05] i am your sustainer i am your keeper
[12:08] i am your deliverer i am your peace i
[12:11] am your god and you are my child let me
[12:14] come fully in
[12:15] and you shall know that i am in the
[12:17] father and the father in me
[12:19] and i in you and you in me i
[12:22] am
[12:24] [Applause]
[12:28] he leads us to the fountain of living
[12:30] water he
[12:32] is that fountain of living water
[12:35] if any man believeth on me as the
[12:37] scripture has said
[12:39] out of his belly shall floor
[12:43] rivers of living amen
[12:57] lord jesus
[13:02] i spoke lord
[13:05] just as you've given it to me here
[13:11] my lips my heart even examples that
[13:15] you've had
[13:16] to stand examples you've
[13:20] taken now lord
[13:24] i'm asking the lord for these
[13:27] hearts that are gathered here this
[13:29] morning
[13:31] lord i pray
[13:36] that you would just move down for them
[13:39] in a special way
[13:43] lord it's not what we can explain
[13:49] but it's your presence coming right down
[13:52] here among us
[13:56] living god making yourself
[14:00] known to that heart
[14:04] lord
[14:08] what you have spoken
[14:11] i'm your satisfier i'm your deliverer
[14:14] i'm your portion
[14:16] what i pray right now
[14:19] that heart dear god that desires to say
[14:22] lord
[14:23] they might have husband wife they might
[14:26] have friends
[14:27] but they feel all alone
[14:31] but there's a comforter and there's only
[14:34] one
[14:35] only one husband can give us comfort
[14:38] wife can give us comfort mom can give us
[14:40] comfort dad can give us comfort but we
[14:42] need a greater comforter than
[14:44] that we need the comforter
[14:49] now lord i pray you gave an example
[14:53] right here
[14:55] you don't put us in a headlock
[14:58] no you don't force us
[15:02] your presence has come you've touched
[15:05] many hearts even as they said here in
[15:07] these services
[15:08] and have said hearing services their
[15:10] hearts and their lives have been touched
[15:12] by your presence
[15:13] that's so that they would know this is
[15:15] not a man's word
[15:18] they would realize that there's a
[15:20] greater one that's here
[15:22] they would recognize lord the one that i
[15:24] stand and represent and i preach about
[15:28] the same one who changed my life they
[15:30] realized lord god
[15:31] we're not speaking of some historical
[15:34] event
[15:34] we're talking about a living god we're
[15:37] talking about the i am that i
[15:38] am now lord
[15:42] may they be like that of the bed melech
[15:46] there's some standing right here
[15:49] they made a decision
[15:52] [Music]
[15:53] faith in the living word is always
[15:56] rewarded
[15:58] i pray heavenly father if thou they've
[16:00] heard
[16:01] and seen was a man
[16:04] i pray that god you'd help them right
[16:06] now i believe lord this morning you've
[16:08] given grace
[16:11] may they recognize lord god
[16:14] it's more than a man my hands
[16:18] are the same as their hands
[16:23] the chemicals i'm made out of other
[16:25] brothers and sisters
[16:26] same 84 cents worth
[16:33] but that's not what'll do it it's to
[16:36] recognize
[16:38] who's in our midst
[16:41] it's to recognize say lord
[16:45] be exalted in my life
[16:50] lord i ask right now god
[16:54] may lord the hearts the lord you may
[16:58] tender by your spirit

[17:04] may it be
[17:04] god a real declaration to say lord
[17:08] i surrender all i'll give it all to you
[17:12] lord
[17:15] i'm not gonna hold nothing back
[17:19] i don't want the holy ghost added to my
[17:21] life i want to surrender my life
[17:24] lord i want you to take all of me
[17:34] [Music]
[17:36] it's the one that want to be remembered
[17:38] in prayer
[17:40] i can pray for you and i believe god
[17:42] will hear my prayer god bless you
[17:44] i believe god will hear my prayer but it
[17:47] ain't what i believe
[17:48] it ain't because of me
[17:52] but i believe with all my heart that
[17:54] he's here
[17:55] it's whether you believe or not
[17:58] he's here to minister to your need
[18:03] let's go to him when i'm praying
[18:07] whatever the need is upon your heart
[18:09] [Music]
[18:11] whatever that need is i want you to make
[18:13] that known before him
[18:14] if there's anything about it in your
[18:16] life that would hinder
[18:18] that would hinder that from coming about
[18:20] if you know if there's anything at all
[18:22] in your life
[18:24] right now just settle and say lord
[18:26] really settle and say lord forgive me
[18:28] lord
[18:31] i don't want to be i don't want that in
[18:32] my life forgive me lord jesus
[18:36] let it be a real repentance and watch
[18:37] him come
[18:40] maybe there's something you've been
[18:42] dealing with and you're saying god
[18:44] i need a change to come in my life
[18:48] you're one of me you want to be
[18:49] identified say lord
[18:52] change me lord you promised in your word
[18:54] from glory unto glory
[18:58] god bless your hands
[18:59] [Music]
[19:01] this isn't a formality of a service
[19:05] but i believe it's the grace of god that
[19:07] gives us an opportunity
[19:08] to respond to his word
[19:11] [Music]
[19:13] you know god said in the book of
[19:14] jeremiah from his heart
[19:16] he said i've corrected my children but
[19:19] they haven't received my correction
[19:22] i believe as his children we want to
[19:25] receive his correction
[19:27] we want to move in that word we want to
[19:30] forsake our own thoughts forsake our own
[19:32] ideas
[19:36] oh my heavenly father
[19:44] i think of these moments lord
[19:48] the very sacred and solemn moments that
[19:51] were gathered here
[19:53] we've come here this morning lord we
[19:56] mean business
[19:58] we know lord this isn't about just
[20:00] coming and
[20:02] fulfilling a duty no we've come here
[20:05] lord
[20:06] we want to hear from you
[20:12] the lord jesus
[20:15] their hands that have went up throughout
[20:17] this building
[20:20] but i'm asking lord god that behind
[20:24] those hands as they
[20:25] lord are in prayer
[20:29] lord there was there's something more
[20:31] they defied
[20:32] gravity to raise that hand
[20:36] there was something an impulse your
[20:38] prophet tells us like this
[20:39] he said the angels are right there right
[20:42] where we're sitting
[20:43] and it's the angels that move upon us
[20:44] and say raise your hand
[20:46] respond to the word lord
[20:50] i believe with all my heart that the
[20:53] angels of god
[20:55] your prophet call them ushers
[20:58] they're here you're here
[21:02] the lord for these hearts right here
[21:05] they
[21:05] want something more than just an emotion
[21:09] they don't want just a feeling they
[21:11] don't want just an emotion
[21:12] you know lord god what's behind that
[21:14] hand there's hands that went up lord
[21:17] that they want to really surrender their
[21:19] life they want to sell it right here
[21:21] this morning
[21:22] they want to let it all be ended right
[21:23] here they're tired of walking alone
[21:26] they desired that the comforter would
[21:28] come to them lord god
[21:30] and make his abode in their life now i
[21:32] asked lord jesus
[21:34] but you would move lord god for those
[21:36] hearts right now
[21:37] may they recognize that that promise
[21:39] belongs to them
[21:41] may they see lord god that the holy
[21:43] ghost it was made available for them
[21:45] knowing that they would be here and they
[21:47] would be desiring of it lord god you
[21:49] made a way that they could receive it
[21:51] oh lord god even lord when they lord
[21:54] would be
[21:54] down lord downcast in their spirit
[21:57] downcast in their mind
[21:58] but lord you made a way lord god that
[22:01] you would come
[22:02] you would sweep by that heart lord you
[22:04] would inspire their hearts lord god
[22:06] to reach up and say lord god i will
[22:09] lay everything on the line lord god i
[22:12] want you lord jesus
[22:14] [Music]
[22:19] lord i pray they made that stand
[22:25] [Music]

[22:34] you've never had to take it back and you
[22:36] won't take it back
[22:39] your word is true repent and be baptized
[22:42] in the name of jesus christ
[22:44] and not maybe not perhaps you
[22:47] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[22:52] for the promise is unto you
[22:57] and your children and as many as are far
[23:00] off
[23:02] as many as the lord i got you
[23:08] lord that apostolic age is still in
[23:10] session
[23:12] you're still calling to hearts and lies
[23:16] i pray heavenly father
[23:20] may you lord
[23:24] just continue to move
[23:27] in our hearts this message lord it goes
[23:30] beyond just
[23:31] reaching lord for souls you've
[23:34] you've reached for souls in each one of
[23:36] these services
[23:37] god i wonder here in this service
[23:40] [Music]
[23:42] i wonder if we forgot
[23:47] the voice that spoke to us
[23:51] it's promised us deliverance we hear
[23:55] everything around us taking place we see
[23:58] everything going on

[27:08] samuel what did that do
[27:09] when god speaks to your heart it puts an
[27:12] expectation
[27:14] in your heart for him amen
