[47:06] Lord
[47:07] behalf of all these the other requests
[47:10] you've got a need on your heart even as
[47:12] we're approaching the word of the Lord
[47:14] God is mindful he's mindful there's no
[47:18] need that's that's too small for him you
[47:23] know it's one thing to say it we believe
[47:26] it but God came in this hour and he
[47:29] demonstrated that to us there was a
[47:33] little fishing not a big one not a big
[47:35] one a little one
[47:38] where it's in size had been pulled out
[47:43] it was impossible for that fish to live
[47:46] again but because of that God came down
[47:53] and he spoke alive to that little fish
[47:59] I've never heard how brother branham

[48:03] inside him how those things I don't that
[48:06] to me the details apart about it it
[48:08] don't matter

[48:25] the same God that can give new lungs new
[48:29] liver new heart new kidneys he's the

[52:41] amen
[52:42] let's look in the word of the Lord here
[52:44] this morning the first Kings chapter 19
[52:48] and I'm just gonna read a few verses of
[52:51] Scripture and then we'll just let you
[52:53] have your seats
[53:02] just wanted just some things that you
[53:06] know we've been dealing with here with
[53:08] how God just dropped all of that
[53:11] together with the stability in the midst
[53:14] of instability but this is one of those
[53:16] parts within it and just not knowing
[53:19] exactly where that God would have it to
[53:22] be but I want to just speak to you this
[53:26] morning if the Lord would help us on
[53:29] strength for the journey before you
[53:34] strength for the journey before you
[53:37] first Kings chapter 19 verse 1 and an a
[53:42] had told Jezebel all that Elijah had
[53:46] done and withal how he had slain all the
[53:49] prophets with a sword then Jezebel sent
[53:54] a messenger unto Elijah saying so let
[53:57] the gods do to me and more also if I
[54:00] make not thy life as the one as the life
[54:03] of one of them but tomorrow about this
[54:06] time and when he saw that he arose and
[54:10] went for his life and came to bear Sheba
[54:14] which belongeth to Judah and left his
[54:18] servant there but he himself went a
[54:22] day's journey into the wilderness and
[54:25] came and sat down under a juniper tree
[54:29] and he requested for himself that he
[54:34] might die and he said it is enough now O
[54:38] Lord take away my life for I'm not
[54:42] better than my father's and as he lay
[54:46] and slept under a juniper tree behold
[54:49] then an angel touched him and said unto
[54:53] Him arise and eat and he looked and
[54:57] behold there was a cake Baken on the
[55:00] coals and a cruse of water at his head
[55:02] and he did eat and drink and laid him
[55:06] down again
[55:07] and the angel of the Lord came again the
[55:10] second time and touched him and said
[55:13] rise and eat because the journey is too
[55:17] great for thee and he arose and did eat
[55:21] and drink and went in the strength of
[55:24] that meat forty days and forty nights
[55:28] unto Horeb the Mount of God
[55:36] Whitten who like to get a hold of this
[55:38] one
[55:44] what kind of meat was this he went in
[55:49] the strength of this meat for 40 days
[55:52] and 40 nights and he came thither unto a
[55:59] cave and lodged there and the hold the
[56:04] word of the Lord came to him and he said
[56:07] unto Him what doest thou here Elijah may
[56:15] God bless his words you're being seated
[56:27] so much within God's Word and we see
[56:30] there's always an application the word
[56:35] is how the Spirit of God will take it
[56:38] and always apply it and just address
[56:42] present needs in each of our lives we
[56:47] find here
[56:49] Elijah where as a servant of God there's
[56:53] three stages that we we notice here we
[56:56] see Mount Carmel and from Mount Carmel
[57:00] experience where the showdown was where
[57:05] Israel was divided between two opinions
[57:08] his bail God or as the Lord God and here
[57:15] God in His mercy came and made himself
[57:19] known to bring the separation so that
[57:25] the people were no longer held between
[57:26] two opinions what took place on Mount
[57:30] Carmel did it make everybody a believer
[57:32] it did out of all of those who spoke on
[57:37] that mountain the Lord he is the God the
[57:40] Lord he is the God but yet it didn't
[57:44] make everybody who was there a believer
[57:50] but then we find that after this when we
[57:54] look at it that Elijah himself if I can
[57:57] just read this to you and going into
[58:00] this brother Brannon would say it like
[58:03] this I don't have this on the screen but
[58:05] I want you just to listen to this you
[58:07] said Elijah was worn out his nerves were
[58:11] all on the edge he said it's just like
[58:15] the people today we need a juniper tree
[58:20] he said I preach to tired people nervous
[58:23] people I pray for nervous people and
[58:26] it's a nervous neurotic upset world
[58:30] right now that we're living in
[58:33] everybody's just on the edge as to say
[58:36] or to speak like it's just any little
[58:40] so upsets them listen to me now God's
[58:45] people is that way the world is that way
[58:50] we all need a juniper tree a place to
[58:56] rest pressure itself there is no one
[59:03] that is exempt from pressure pressure as
[59:07] brother Brandon would put it it makes
[59:09] the good act this way and makes the bad
[59:11] act this way it makes the unbeliever act
[59:14] this way it makes believer act this way
[59:16] pressure has an effect even after a life
[59:21] has totally been born again but remember
[59:25] your spirit and your flesh never got
[59:28] born again it's not an excuse but it's
[59:31] the reality of that in this life that we
[59:33] walk as Jesus said we walk in this world
[59:36] but we're not of this world
[59:39] we have to experience pressures and sort
[59:43] through things that come our way when
[59:45] you're on the job this report comes or
[59:47] this rumor comes or this statement comes
[59:50] and it's a time that you've got to sort
[59:52] all that out you have to be able to take
[59:55] that and put it into the hands of God
[59:57] and put your life there but how have a
[1:00:00] great of a testimony when God would
[1:00:03] allow those things to rise and God would
[1:00:05] give us grace to be able to do that
[1:00:07] there is a thing that when pressure
[1:00:10] comes many times weariness will follow
[1:00:13] it when sometimes when a person gets
[1:00:16] sick weariness will follow sickness when
[1:00:21] weariness follow sickness then there's
[1:00:23] things that thoughts can start
[1:00:25] bombarding a person and they can get
[1:00:27] down and they get weak and you know it
[1:00:30] was even in those times when brother
[1:00:31] Branham was interviewing sister Bruce he
[1:00:33] was explaining even of how the enemy was
[1:00:36] coming to work on her in her makeup but
[1:00:38] he pointed out you're sick and you're
[1:00:40] weary and that's when the enemy likes to
[1:00:43] come and during those times of weariness
[1:00:45] and you know to realize we are
[1:00:50] in a time that within not just in this
[1:00:53] time but all the way down through the
[1:00:55] scriptures there is a need for every one
[1:00:58] of us to come aside and rest sometimes
[1:01:03] we can go get so focused on everything
[1:01:07] that's going on in life but yet there's
[1:01:09] a time that we must and we need to be
[1:01:12] refreshed there has to be a renewing in
[1:01:17] our lives Elijah you know brother
[1:01:20] Brandon would put it that he was weary
[1:01:22] he was feeling blue within himself and
[1:01:26] you know you think about Elijah and
[1:01:28] think about within him brother bran
[1:01:30] would say many times he said people
[1:01:32] think God's prophets they just ought to
[1:01:35] be continually going and bombarding and
[1:01:38] continually he said like a rocket he
[1:01:40] said but let me say this he said that
[1:01:43] when you go as hard like a rocket like
[1:01:45] that you're eventually going to fall
[1:01:47] like a rock because the reality of it is
[1:01:51] your only there is only so much that you
[1:01:54] can do in your natural strength but you
[1:01:57] say well I've got God's strength behind
[1:01:59] me but remember this thing gets tired
[1:02:02] and it gets weary whether we like it or
[1:02:06] not
[1:02:06] and whether you want admit it or not
[1:02:07] there's times even sometimes in a
[1:02:09] service we can get tired and weary hope
[1:02:14] it's not this morning but the reality is
[1:02:18] why this body can only handle so much it
[1:02:24] can only it can only take so much we are
[1:02:27] going to a place we are going into a
[1:02:29] land where we'll never have to worry
[1:02:32] about that again but your is there is
[1:02:37] good counsel that for all of our lives
[1:02:40] it it behooves us for what God has
[1:02:43] commissioned us to do I'm talking about
[1:02:45] as husband has wife has family for each
[1:02:49] and every one of us in our life there is
[1:02:52] a need for us not to just all the time
[1:02:56] be goin goin goin goin goin goin goin
[1:02:58] there's a need to rest Jesus sit come
[1:03:01] aside
[1:03:02] brother branham in the message thy house
[1:03:05] preached in Tifton Georgia just in a
[1:03:07] little living room he spoke there in
[1:03:10] that house and he said many people he
[1:03:12] said now he said they come to ask me and
[1:03:14] say brother Branham how in the world if
[1:03:16] the coming of the Lord is upon us how in
[1:03:19] the world do you got time to go fishing
[1:03:21] you see the thought listen that's not
[1:03:27] that kind of a thought right there is a
[1:03:29] thought sometimes it could permeate in
[1:03:31] our minds but you realize if you don't
[1:03:35] rest and refreshed you can't go on we
[1:03:41] all have we all have limitations brother
[1:03:43] Branham had to recognize this and it
[1:03:45] wasn't something that just come easy it
[1:03:47] was something he had to deal with
[1:03:48] something he had to go through look in
[1:03:50] the journey of Israel here they come
[1:03:52] tomorrow after Marah hard bitter trials
[1:03:56] and tests there's any lien Elaine was a
[1:03:59] place of palm trees a place of Springs
[1:04:01] of water a place of rest where they
[1:04:04] could be refreshed and prepared for the
[1:04:06] next part of the journey brother Branham
[1:04:11] made this statement in regards that
[1:04:12] question he said if I didn't if I didn't
[1:04:18] he said with all that if I let it weigh
[1:04:20] on my mind he said it would go crazy
[1:04:22] I've got to get out brothers don't call
[1:04:31] off sick tomorrow and go fishing wait
[1:04:36] till you get the honey-do list then you
[1:04:37] can know that wouldn't be good counsel
[1:04:41] would it but there's got to be there's
[1:04:45] got to be in taken an output and we
[1:04:49] think about what we're taking in and you
[1:04:51] know brother Branham would say like this
[1:04:52] he said many times we you know as we sat
[1:04:55] around in these meetings he said we're
[1:04:56] taking in two things of God but there
[1:04:59] needs to be a giving out in our life
[1:05:01] what we're taking it but you know the
[1:05:04] only way that what God is giving to us
[1:05:07] what we're feeding on can come out of
[1:05:09] our life is when we take that and pray
[1:05:12] over it and submit to it and then God in
[1:05:15] weakness moves behind and brings that
[1:05:18] word to pass you see it's nothing where
[1:05:20] we can take the word and say I am gonna
[1:05:22] take this word and I'm gonna mime just
[1:05:25] gonna go along that way we find
[1:05:26] ourselves down because it's not us that
[1:05:32] can do it it's got to be him that
[1:05:38] doesn't mean that we as believers just
[1:05:40] go off and forget about it it means we
[1:05:43] giving ourselves to him what God is
[1:05:48] illuminated to our hearts and our lives
[1:05:50] we give ourselves to him because man
[1:05:53] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:05:56] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:05:58] mouth of God
[1:05:59] how much you think of this statement
[1:06:00] here just for a moment brother Branham
[1:06:03] would take this this this whole part
[1:06:05] right here with Elijah
[1:06:08] how did Elijah was tired and he was
[1:06:12] weary but God prepared a juniper tree
[1:06:17] for him it was not by chance I want you
[1:06:24] to look at this he takes off and he runs
[1:06:27] to bear Sheba to Judah with his servant
[1:06:31] then he leaves his servant there and he
[1:06:33] goes on out into the winters he's alone
[1:06:36] but this is all under the plan of God
[1:06:40] sometimes the plan of God and what God
[1:06:43] is doing in our life he doesn't even
[1:06:45] make sense to us much less to anybody
[1:06:48] else but God is at work he's not the
[1:06:52] author of confusion amen he is
[1:06:56] overseeing everything every test every
[1:06:58] trial that comes away every sickness
[1:07:01] every circumstance he's overseeing it
[1:07:06] sometimes you and I feel so alone you
[1:07:11] get weary you feel so long Elisha was in
[1:07:16] this condition he was feeling so long
[1:07:21] that's what he speaks in latter parts
[1:07:24] here of the word and the only one is
[1:07:26] left he felt alone you know it's not
[1:07:31] good for a man to be alone we can move
[1:07:37] that on into the spiritual but I want
[1:07:39] you to see here God provided the loving
[1:07:42] kindness of God provided Elijah with the
[1:07:46] juniper tree that to me is so tremendous
[1:07:52] how God seen to it and knew his prophet
[1:07:56] was going to come to that place and it
[1:07:59] was God's orchestrated measure that
[1:08:02] Elijah would come to that place so God
[1:08:06] prepared that juniper tree for Elijah
[1:08:09] think of this a prepared place when
[1:08:14] Moses was there God told him come and
[1:08:18] stand upon the rock there is a place
[1:08:21] beside me it was a prepared place when
[1:08:31] Elijah he had already remember when the
[1:08:35] dew had been cold and God had spoke to
[1:08:38] his life he comes out of the wilderness
[1:08:40] and said it'll not rain or Dew glut told
[1:08:43] him to say that good 2 a.m. and speak
[1:08:46] those words and he went and spoke those
[1:08:48] words and God withheld the rain and the
[1:08:51] dew from Israel and here he was provided
[1:08:58] a place down there get thee to the brook
[1:09:02] Cherith he goes to that place he goes
[1:09:06] and he's he's fed by Ravens he drinks
[1:09:09] from the brook that brook dries up I
[1:09:13] hope you hear of me now there's
[1:09:16] sometimes God has to let things dry up
[1:09:18] why there's another Junction
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:23] sometimes we don't understand that it's
[1:09:26] called moving us along the way he's
[1:09:28] maturing our lives he's bringing us into
[1:09:31] appointed places that he has for us and
[1:09:35] he said I commanded a little woman to
[1:09:38] sustain me down there in therapist well
[1:09:42] is what she had it didn't look like that
[1:09:43] he had commanded her to sustain him but
[1:09:46] a little did he know God's command well
[1:09:48] she had a heart that was willing to be
[1:09:50] submissive a heart that could recognize
[1:09:52] God's presence and God's voice and God
[1:09:54] sent his servant down there and his
[1:09:56] servant here he comes think of a God had
[1:09:59] a there was a need in the prophets life
[1:10:01] for him to be sustained but she needed
[1:10:04] to be sustained as well God was working
[1:10:07] on both ends sometimes you do not even
[1:10:12] know whether the things that have
[1:10:14] befallen you things that have come out
[1:10:16] to you come on Joseph I'm talking to you
[1:10:18] there are things sometimes that comes
[1:10:20] out you don't know why you're in certain
[1:10:22] places and what this has come about but
[1:10:24] God has put you there to preserve life
[1:10:29] and you wonder why am I here that don't
[1:10:32] even make sense it's things that you
[1:10:37] wouldn't have even chose but God has
[1:10:40] chosen you see the scripture let me just
[1:10:47] drop this in here the scripture says in
[1:10:50] Philippians 2 verse 5 let this mind be
[1:10:54] in you which was also in Christ Jesus it
[1:11:00] goes on to talk about
[1:11:01] he took the form of a servant just
[1:11:05] submitting in the submissiveness of his
[1:11:07] life once again I find this this portion
[1:11:12] of Scripture would not had an
[1:11:14] opportunity to speak on it but I find
[1:11:16] this really incredible that Paul this
[1:11:19] unction and this would be given during a
[1:11:22] time when he is in prison
[1:11:26] and he's writing of the greatness of the
[1:11:31] mind of Christ being in the believer and
[1:11:34] Paul writes in the book of Philippians
[1:11:37] this is the same book where we find the
[1:11:42] text read of the mighty Gordonville
[1:11:45] before us unveiling of God in this hour
[1:11:47] think of it it's a text that when we
[1:11:49] look at it the whole book of the book of
[1:11:52] Philippians it deals with singleness of
[1:11:55] mind it deals with the focus among the
[1:11:58] believers and of a yielded submissive
[1:12:01] servant's heart that God might be
[1:12:07] expressed I say we need help to come
[1:12:16] into that servant place we need help
[1:12:21] 1st Corinthians 2:16
[1:12:23] who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[1:12:27] he may instruct him but we have the mind
[1:12:31] of Christ let me just say this even when
[1:12:35] we received the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:12:37] mind of Christ yet we need God's help
[1:12:44] to yield not take our own thinking but
[1:12:50] let his thinking be preeminent women God
[1:12:54] we need the grace of God in that
[1:12:57] overriding of our lives Lord let my
[1:12:59] thoughts be overrode what you think of
[1:13:07] this as out of the Seventh Seal just
[1:13:11] think of this the Seventh Seal when the
[1:13:14] supernatural he's talking about this
[1:13:16] experience with Elijah when the
[1:13:18] supernatural comes in that's the mind of
[1:13:21] Christ you become so far away from your
[1:13:26] own thinking so he said your own mind
[1:13:28] always said don't let me try to explain
[1:13:29] it cuz I can't I couldn't do it
[1:13:31] there's nobody could do it how could
[1:13:34] that man that's the Elijah stand up
[1:13:36] there on the mountain under the presence
[1:13:39] of God and pulled down fire from heaven
[1:13:42] then rain right behind the fire then
[1:13:45] closed the heavens it didn't rain for
[1:13:47] three years and six months go back and
[1:13:49] call the rain on the same day and under
[1:13:52] that anointing how many know I'm talking
[1:13:56] about when the Prophet stood there in
[1:13:59] that bull pasture when he stood there
[1:14:01] when the maniac came upon the platform
[1:14:03] when he stood there and the Hornets came
[1:14:06] out of the nest
[1:14:07] what did he say he says oh I wish I
[1:14:09] could stay under that anointing all the
[1:14:11] time but recognize what invited that
[1:14:17] anointing the mind of Christ to move in
[1:14:20] what invited that what did the Prophet
[1:14:23] élysée said he chose to think different
[1:14:26] thoughts they were thoughts that
[1:14:30] considered the humanity of that man he
[1:14:33] was bound by Devils but God who through
[1:14:37] his prophet he showed you and I do not
[1:14:40] get caught in that warfare with that and
[1:14:45] looking at like it's flesh and blood
[1:14:47] recognize it's a spiritual warfare
[1:14:52] [Applause]
[1:14:55] you'll never defeat spirits with our own
[1:14:59] strength
[1:15:02] don't happen
[1:15:04] you can't outward it you can't out
[1:15:06] reason it you cannot it but
[1:15:09] there's one thing there's one thing that
[1:15:12] the devil can't stand in the face of and
[1:15:15] that's the love of God that's what Jesus
[1:15:24] took and whipped the devil with the love
[1:15:27] of God he stood upon that word his love
[1:15:32] for the word of God hallelujah under
[1:15:37] that anointing he took four hundred
[1:15:39] priests and killed him
[1:15:41] that's what Elijah did then he run into
[1:15:44] the wilderness screaming for his life on
[1:15:46] a threat of one woman Jezebel she swore
[1:15:51] that she'd take his life when they
[1:15:54] happen all of them was there to see the
[1:15:56] presence of God and great miracle done
[1:15:59] the spirit had left him in his natural
[1:16:03] way of thinking he didn't know how to
[1:16:06] think you know brother Branham would say
[1:16:10] it like this people speak even in before
[1:16:18] then of Ministers but I believe it
[1:16:20] applies to all of us he said you watch
[1:16:22] after God has used you he said within
[1:16:26] that service the next day he said Satan
[1:16:29] is there present to try to knock every
[1:16:32] ounce of confidence out of you that the
[1:16:35] Holy Ghost has instilled let me just
[1:16:37] tell you something that is not just for
[1:16:40] me the Holy Spirit jesus said my words
[1:16:43] they are spirit and life
[1:16:47] Paul said I was with you and great
[1:16:50] trembling and weakness that your faith
[1:16:52] might stand in the power of God God is
[1:16:55] in stealing
[1:16:57] confidence in your life the Holy Spirit
[1:17:02] is instilling confidence
[1:17:04] in our life strength for the journey
[1:17:07] that lays before you the reality is you
[1:17:12] don't know and I don't know what lays
[1:17:14] before us even in the oncoming hours we
[1:17:17] don't know what lays before us tomorrow
[1:17:20] we don't know what next month or next
[1:17:22] year or we don't know those things but
[1:17:26] God does Grund us it is natural way of
[1:17:33] thinking he didn't know how to think he
[1:17:35] couldn't think for himself
[1:17:37] remember the angel putting to sleep
[1:17:39] rested him raised him up
[1:17:40] gave him some cakes put him back to
[1:17:42] sleep rested him raised him up give him
[1:17:44] some cakes again we don't know what
[1:17:46] happened to the man for 40 days then he
[1:17:48] was pulled back in a cave somewhere and
[1:17:50] God called him I love how brother bran
[1:17:56] will take this and he'll dramatizing
[1:17:58] showing God's care to each of our lives
[1:18:03] Elijah was in it was in a place to where
[1:18:08] he felt like what good is anything doing
[1:18:14] I've preached of labor and it's still
[1:18:17] going on the same way listen this gets
[1:18:21] down to children and you know loved ones
[1:18:24] and on and on and on sometimes you just
[1:18:26] get weary because the weariness comes
[1:18:29] we're coming to the end of our rope God
[1:18:36] don't do things how we think he's going
[1:18:38] to do it he specializes in rolling up
[1:18:42] our plans
[1:18:45] you know why cuz he's God he don't have
[1:18:51] to do it our way
[1:18:51] who have known the mind of the Lord that
[1:18:54] we might instruct him how weariness many
[1:18:59] times come from that plans or things are
[1:19:03] not going according to how we think they
[1:19:06] ought to go but it doesn't mean that
[1:19:10] nothing's happening he's weary me to say
[1:19:21] like this he was depressed he was
[1:19:25] discouraged I'm sorry this is the Bible
[1:19:29] this is the mighty prophet of God but
[1:19:32] God didn't chose to hide or cloak that
[1:19:34] humanity he's weary he's tired he's made
[1:19:44] a request just let me go let me let me
[1:19:47] come on home
[1:19:48] let me come on home sometimes you know
[1:19:52] even in the midst of things you can get
[1:19:54] weird you can get tired
[1:19:56] whether it's disease whether it's
[1:19:57] affliction whether it's trials battles
[1:19:59] you can just get weary and we've all
[1:20:03] been there if you haven't you couldn't
[1:20:05] do it and the Prophet the voice that the
[1:20:08] Holy Spirit spoke back to me
[1:20:10] in the adoption series from brother Brad
[1:20:13] sir let me just come on home he said are
[1:20:15] you trying to escape your trials trials
[1:20:21] are the molding ground sitting under
[1:20:29] this Ministry of the word
[1:20:31] it doesn't mold your character you know
[1:20:34] I preached if we preach these things it
[1:20:36] doesn't mold your character you're
[1:20:38] coming and feeding on the word it and
[1:20:40] gives you strength but the molding of
[1:20:43] our character your character my
[1:20:45] character it comes through the things we
[1:20:47] suffer trials and tests in different
[1:20:51] ways
[1:21:00] who God had the juniper-tree fruit he
[1:21:04] already had it prepared now this wasn't
[1:21:06] a five-star hotel but all the service it
[1:21:09] had there this is one of them little
[1:21:13] places you might have passed up it was a
[1:21:16] nice little bed-and-breakfast
[1:21:18] it had really some incredible cooks
[1:21:22] there as a matter of fact with all the
[1:21:26] angels brother Brown said here when it
[1:21:28] Elijah came in he laid under that
[1:21:30] juniper tree all the angels that was
[1:21:32] gathered around
[1:21:34] he said God looked upon his servant God
[1:21:38] said which one have you got the softest
[1:21:41] hands come on you do I want you to
[1:21:47] stroke his brow brother Branham said
[1:21:56] then god looked around again and said
[1:21:58] which one of you is the best cook
[1:22:05] world had counted him as an outcast he
[1:22:09] had been rejected the message had
[1:22:13] seemingly been rejected he could not see
[1:22:16] any results sometimes you ever been in a
[1:22:22] in a setting in a situation sometimes
[1:22:24] you don't see results you're looking for
[1:22:27] results and sometimes you're not seeing
[1:22:31] results it can discourage you I'm
[1:22:37] preaching to myself as much as I'm
[1:22:38] preaching to you but God brought down
[1:22:43] the best cook and he with the softest
[1:22:46] hands God who's going to care for his
[1:22:49] servant his servant had done everything
[1:22:52] that God had asked him to do he rose up
[1:23:00] that angel was there for the brem said
[1:23:02] he just wasn't you know moving his head
[1:23:04] over the brow and hanison Elisha you
[1:23:08] stood for the Lord he's taking care of
[1:23:11] you now just just just eat this now
[1:23:15] going back to sleep God not only
[1:23:19] provided the juniper-tree he provided
[1:23:21] the drink and the sustenance he let him
[1:23:27] go back to sleep
[1:23:30] then he came back over the Bible says
[1:23:32] then the age of the Lord came a second
[1:23:35] time and woke him up and said my John
[1:23:40] come on you gonna you got to rise up you
[1:23:43] need to you need to eat and Elisha you
[1:23:46] know brother Branham to say it like this
[1:23:47] he said Elisha his little frail hands
[1:23:49] were shaken when they woke him up and he
[1:23:52] was trying to wipe his eyes and and get
[1:23:56] him open his humanity the weakness the
[1:24:01] frailty it was on display he was alone
[1:24:07] just where God wanted him and he told
[1:24:12] him arise and eat you've got to raise up
[1:24:18] and eat he said because the journey is
[1:24:21] too great for you
[1:24:25] there's no way Elisha could have went
[1:24:29] forward any further if God hadn't
[1:24:33] sustained him he had a need for strength
[1:24:38] he was in a time of despair he needed
[1:24:46] strength for him he didn't see a journey
[1:24:50] ahead of him he didn't know what would
[1:24:52] lay ahead of him but God knew there are
[1:24:55] plans there are things yet that you are
[1:24:58] to do in the midst of trouble God
[1:25:08] provided care for his servant you know
[1:25:12] there's a need for strength let me just
[1:25:16] say this to you
[1:25:17] the scripture would talk about it in the
[1:25:20] book of first John chapter 3 and it
[1:25:23] would talk about the young men youth the
[1:25:27] strength of your youth stamina that you
[1:25:31] have as young people as young men and
[1:25:34] young women but even in your natural
[1:25:37] strength when it comes to walking
[1:25:41] with the Lord you need more than your
[1:25:44] natural strip you need God's strength to
[1:25:47] back up and to flow through your natural
[1:25:50] strength because Isaiah said in Isaiah
[1:25:56] chapter 40 that even the youth would get
[1:26:00] faint and weary as is talking in a very
[1:26:06] this is the Holy Spirit talking in a in
[1:26:09] a deep level there and Isaiah's talking
[1:26:11] about the inner part of an individual
[1:26:14] he's talking about that though the
[1:26:16] Eagles need to renew their strength if
[1:26:19] that renew wait on the Lord renew their
[1:26:24] strength they'll mount up think of this
[1:26:29] work we're living in the time here that
[1:26:32] what lays before us we need strength for
[1:26:35] the journey that's before us last year
[1:26:42] ain't good enough
[1:26:44] last month ain't good enough you've got
[1:26:49] to have strength for the journey right
[1:26:51] now hallelujah God came and he touched
[1:26:58] him once you think of this here program
[1:27:01] said God laid him down under the juniper
[1:27:05] tree and put him to sleep so he could
[1:27:08] rest awhile
[1:27:12] huh my did he not have a lot to do he
[1:27:18] did was it not things that had to be
[1:27:21] carried out he did but God knew he
[1:27:26] needed rest might say after liquor
[1:27:31] preach here sometimes as I've said here
[1:27:35] in moments ago we need rest
[1:27:39] brother Brennan said you know many times
[1:27:41] brother Brown say well I'd rather wear
[1:27:43] out than rust out but then balance that
[1:27:44] on down in the message there were others
[1:27:47] that brother branham said I've got a
[1:27:48] word from the Lord to take to that
[1:27:50] brother that it's not his business to
[1:27:52] try to do all the work I said thank you
[1:27:58] Lord you see go and go with the desire
[1:28:05] but God had come to a place the mind of
[1:28:09] Christ had pulled back in this moment
[1:28:13] where the brem said he knew he was
[1:28:15] hungry he woke him up an angel touched
[1:28:18] him and there were some cakes baked and
[1:28:21] laying on the coals and he ate the cakes
[1:28:24] and went back to sleep again he must
[1:28:27] have really been tired that revival and
[1:28:30] their miracles that he had performed the
[1:28:32] supernatural upon him he was wore out
[1:28:34] and then the angel let him sleep a
[1:28:36] little more and when he woke him up
[1:28:37] again he said eat some more because the
[1:28:40] journey is very hard listen this and how
[1:28:42] oh how we need in this journey that
[1:28:45] we're in now to find a place of rest and
[1:28:48] to feast on the Word of God so that
[1:28:51] it'll give a strength not just listen to
[1:28:57] it feed on it that was God's complaint
[1:29:05] into the Sundays and AIDS they were
[1:29:09] listening to the word to gain positions
[1:29:12] and debate and laram said they did not
[1:29:16] receive it for practical out working in
[1:29:20] their life when we reckon we receive it
[1:29:24] as practical out working when we're
[1:29:26] standing there and recognizing that God
[1:29:28] I need you to come Lord and to make this
[1:29:34] manifest in my life let my heart let my
[1:29:38] spirit love my mind let all that is
[1:29:40] within me be an alignment Lord with you
[1:29:48] night after night go to the room and
[1:29:51] rest and come back the next morning
[1:29:53] fresh and eat some more for there's a
[1:29:55] great journey and a great battle ahead
[1:29:58] for the church I believe we have been
[1:30:02] children long enough God's going to turn
[1:30:06] his church into manhood now we've played
[1:30:10] and frolicked as children but now we're
[1:30:12] gonna have to put away childish things
[1:30:14] and take on manhood maturity Paul say
[1:30:18] when I was a child I speak as a child
[1:30:20] he's because he's sucked as a child but
[1:30:23] now it's time that we think like men and
[1:30:25] women now for we've got to get down to
[1:30:29] business
[1:30:30] in the words that the Holy Spirit would
[1:30:34] speak through fall for now is our
[1:30:37] salvation nearer than when we first
[1:30:40] believed
[1:30:44] this is a time for maturity a time that
[1:30:50] to stand as men and women of God
[1:30:53] redeemed by the blood of the land born
[1:30:56] of his spirit here's God he's giving
[1:31:02] sustenance to his tired and weary
[1:31:04] servant that mind of Christ was pulled
[1:31:07] back Elijah didn't know the next move to
[1:31:09] make remember Elijah didn't go up there
[1:31:11] on Mount Carmel by his own thoughts or
[1:31:14] something he wanted to do it wasn't
[1:31:17] listen to me he did not go to Mount
[1:31:19] Carmel because he saw a need
[1:31:21] he's the need he saw but he gave himself
[1:31:25] to God and God said this is how I want
[1:31:29] to address that need prophets wait on
[1:31:35] God's leading the Lord had mightily used
[1:31:43] him but in the midst of a threat of one
[1:31:48] woman
[1:31:48] he ran what if you'd been living in that
[1:31:54] day there goes your prophet running
[1:32:03] but God was in control God had prepared
[1:32:08] a juniper tree for Elijah sometimes what
[1:32:13] the world closed defeat looks like when
[1:32:20] it's all washed up that's when God's
[1:32:25] getting ready to step in he's got to let
[1:32:31] it get to that place
[1:32:35] whoa breach with me now he's gotta let
[1:32:39] it get to that place with you and me
[1:32:46] when I get to the end of our way he's
[1:32:53] going to extreme Fannin larger though to
[1:32:55] me this is quite a paradox it really is
[1:32:58] because it's so as I said contrary to
[1:33:02] our thinking what we saw when Elijah
[1:33:05] steps out of we you know we know it
[1:33:07] Tishbite but we don't know we don't have
[1:33:09] any background there's no family there's
[1:33:12] nothing that we can go to it's like he
[1:33:15] just stepped out of a middle of nowhere
[1:33:20] that in itself is the same pattern God
[1:33:24] uses nobodies
[1:33:29] God uses nobodies because he has the
[1:33:38] hardest time getting somebody's to
[1:33:40] become nobodies that's what Paul said he
[1:33:47] said do you see cannot you see by your
[1:33:49] choosing how God is not chosen the great
[1:33:52] and mighty things to call into himself
[1:33:55] there's a view but is it God has chosen
[1:33:58] the weak things of this world to
[1:34:01] confound
[1:34:04] I think it would not be that way come on
[1:34:08] now you know our preacher it's just like
[1:34:11] when you're picking kickball teams or
[1:34:13] whatever more forgive me for dragging
[1:34:15] you back on the elementary playground
[1:34:16] but you know the person who can't kick
[1:34:19] well can't catch well is the last one on
[1:34:21] the wall and whatever team wants and
[1:34:24] takes them Foursquare tetherball
[1:34:32] whatever you going to do but not God God
[1:34:41] don't big based on abilities higher and
[1:34:47] gods picking was from his minds from the
[1:34:51] lines of his mind and we would look at
[1:34:55] those of God's children that would be
[1:34:58] earthen vessels that the glory of God
[1:35:02] would dwell in we would never pick them
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:08] but after all it's not by might nor by
[1:35:13] power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:35:18] this mountain shall be removed god don't
[1:35:25] need our strength he needs our yielding
[1:35:37] I wonder if the prayer requests going in
[1:35:40] a church on it like pray for brother
[1:35:42] Elijah he said well I just feel a little
[1:35:44] down he's a little discouraged he's a
[1:35:48] little depressed he's a little upset
[1:35:52] he's wanting to go on home
[1:35:55] some of us say ho my that's terrible and
[1:35:59] it is we would feel because we would
[1:36:03] love brother Elijah but little do we
[1:36:08] know God said this place I've prepared
[1:36:13] it but God the situation's yeah I
[1:36:17] allowed the situation's to go like that
[1:36:20] you pulled back your mind yeah how did
[1:36:27] he know to come to this juniper tree
[1:36:29] well I knew this is where he was going
[1:36:32] to end up and his pathway was guided the
[1:36:36] whole time
[1:36:36] think about it brother harun he did not
[1:36:38] feel at that time going in there leaving
[1:36:41] his servant gone to the juniper tree I
[1:36:43] guarantee you he didn't feel spiritual
[1:36:47] he didn't feel spiritual you know what
[1:36:50] I'm talking about there's times you go
[1:36:52] in your prayer closer there's times when
[1:36:54] you're walking and things of God it's
[1:36:56] heavy in the mill you don't feel
[1:36:58] spiritual but God is leading
[1:37:05] hallelujahs sub dungeon you go through a
[1:37:07] surgery you go through a sickness you go
[1:37:10] through a trap you don't feel spiritual
[1:37:13] you're not to have that Mount Carmel
[1:37:15] every day in every situation but there's
[1:37:20] a need for juniper trees
[1:37:36] God needed Elijah to get weak he needed
[1:37:43] Elijah to get to a place where it's just
[1:37:45] him all alone ask you some questions
[1:37:54] this had monition of the angel of the
[1:37:58] Lord that came and woke him up the
[1:38:01] second time fed him the first time put
[1:38:04] him back to sleep
[1:38:05] woke him up the second time rise and eat
[1:38:09] for the journey is too great for thee
[1:38:14] he received strength what strength do
[1:38:18] you have where is your place of rest
[1:38:23] have some questions where did you make
[1:38:26] your place to let off the pressure well
[1:38:32] I'm all worked up so you know I just get
[1:38:34] on the computer sometimes that's just
[1:38:38] like pulling gas on fire
[1:38:48] think deep now what what do you make
[1:38:54] your place of rest when you're under
[1:38:57] pressure what do you make your refuge
[1:39:04] what are you feeding on is it giving you
[1:39:10] discernment to see impending judgment
[1:39:17] does it bring clarity to your walk with
[1:39:20] the Lord come on now this discernment in
[1:39:29] this hour
[1:39:29] you're discerning don't just be looking
[1:39:31] at what you see out here discern the
[1:39:34] spirits that are behind it the message
[1:39:41] of this hour it took us back from just
[1:39:44] looking at and just sing denominations
[1:39:47] it gets back to the root and the motive
[1:39:50] of it the motive of it is that it is a
[1:39:54] refusal to go on with the Word of God a
[1:39:58] rejection of his life and they take
[1:40:02] another life that's why they bear their
[1:40:05] names Eve was not called Eve she was
[1:40:12] called Adam but when other seed was
[1:40:16] found in her then she was called Eve
[1:40:18] which means mother of all living
[1:40:26] oh god help us the journey is too great
[1:40:30] for you you need strength from this meat
[1:40:34] I'm talking about this meat that is in
[1:40:37] due season
[1:40:44] God has sent us a message in this hour
[1:40:48] and as even keepers in the vineyard we
[1:40:52] are charged to give meat in due season
[1:40:58] but this is not based on a man's
[1:41:01] intellect it's God's work
[1:41:10] famine you know what famine is where you
[1:41:12] say well family you know it's a it's a
[1:41:13] lack of food famine ain't all together
[1:41:15] like a food famine is a lack of the
[1:41:18] proper nutrients let me just make it
[1:41:24] simple you can get hungry and grab your
[1:41:26] so-called Snickers bar and a few moments
[1:41:29] later your Sugar's done spiked and
[1:41:31] you're ready for another one
[1:41:33] you don't answer not proper nutrients
[1:41:38] you can be eaten but not getting proper
[1:41:40] nutrients you've got to be feeding the
[1:41:48] scripture said there'd be a famine for
[1:41:49] the hearing for the hearing where would
[1:41:52] it be at the famine would be in the
[1:41:54] hearing so it shows that within that
[1:41:57] this journey from this body of Duncan
[1:42:01] the journey were on is a journey from
[1:42:03] this dimension into that other dimension
[1:42:06] this journey that we are called upon
[1:42:08] right now is a journey that all of the
[1:42:11] ages have been waiting on amen the seven
[1:42:16] churches they have been marching in step
[1:42:19] they have marched in step and in beat
[1:42:22] with that word that God had given that
[1:42:24] out but they have been waiting and
[1:42:26] looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:42:29] Paul preached it Paul announced it Paul
[1:42:33] would express that of the rapture that
[1:42:36] was coming this journey is too great
[1:42:45] we need strength hallelujah to live a
[1:42:54] victorious life it's too great for you
[1:42:56] you need to give yourself strength from
[1:42:58] this meet you didn't bring your soul
[1:43:02] into rapture you don't catch you away
[1:43:04] from the world listen
[1:43:05] Satan is drawing listen to me now Satan
[1:43:10] is drawing a focus to his kingdom
[1:43:13] don't you thinking going down without a
[1:43:16] fuss he's trying to draw focus me to
[1:43:24] tell you something that devil is way too
[1:43:26] slick to try to pull you up a fifth of
[1:43:29] whiskey and pour you a glass here take
[1:43:31] this
[1:43:32] ain't no deception in that you've
[1:43:35] already overcome that he wants to try to
[1:43:39] bring it real close even within word and
[1:43:42] situations you see he's all about trying
[1:43:45] to get your focus off of the prize the
[1:43:52] Bible said look unto Jesus the author
[1:43:56] and the finisher of our faith
[1:43:58] [Applause]
[1:44:02] sames trying to draw it his attention
[1:44:06] the attention of the people to his
[1:44:07] kingdom look what his kingdom's made up
[1:44:09] of worry frustration enmity hatred
[1:44:12] hatred strife that's not God's kingdom
[1:44:18] let me just tell you something we ain't
[1:44:21] taking God's kingdom and trying to
[1:44:22] straighten out satan's kingdom we've
[1:44:24] received your kingdom that cannot be
[1:44:27] moved there is a land brother where
[1:44:31] we're going to
[1:44:34] [Applause]
[1:44:38] well I feel like preaching on the
[1:44:40] Millenium right now but I got to just
[1:44:41] hold that this is a time that we're
[1:44:50] living in where the Bible said that
[1:44:52] Satan is as a roaring lion going about
[1:44:57] he's got announcements he's got this
[1:44:59] seeking whom he may devour we're living
[1:45:03] in a time where he's getting ready to be
[1:45:05] cast out
[1:45:05] I said he's getting ready to be cast out
[1:45:10] and when he's cast out the Bible said in
[1:45:13] the Book of Revelations chapter 12 woe
[1:45:15] to the inhabitants of the earth then
[1:45:19] rather all these things and corn moles
[1:45:22] and plagues and everything else that
[1:45:24] ain't even been the head man it's been a
[1:45:28] demon in the place in the man of sin a
[1:45:33] demon has been there but when he is
[1:45:35] kicked out the demon that's been a
[1:45:37] placeholder is removed and the devil
[1:45:40] himself sets right down I don't plan on
[1:45:47] being here
[1:45:51] matter of fact I'm making plans daily
[1:45:53] not to even get involved with them
[1:45:56] [Applause]
[1:46:04] you're not going to be able to you're
[1:46:06] not going to be able to stem this tide
[1:46:07] without a proper diet he went
[1:46:14] independent strength of this meat let me
[1:46:16] just narrowed this down he went into
[1:46:17] strength of this meat for 40 days and 40
[1:46:20] nights
[1:46:22] brother David that was more than just
[1:46:25] organic from Whole Foods or wherever it
[1:46:29] is on where you get this stuff
[1:46:35] this wasn't man-made engine ingenuity
[1:46:38] man didn't provide this food let me
[1:46:43] remind you man hasn't provided the food
[1:46:46] that we're eating on the Bible has been
[1:46:51] with us for hundreds of years but when
[1:46:55] blood comes along brother he takes seed
[1:46:58] and it becomes bread it becomes realize
[1:47:04] to us no longer just seed promises it
[1:47:09] becomes life to us it becomes our daily
[1:47:15] bread it becomes everything to us and it
[1:47:22] keeps on multiplying but Briony don't
[1:47:25] ever run out hallelujah
[1:47:33] 40 is temptation he went in the power of
[1:47:40] this meat through every temptation and
[1:47:45] they just tell you something greater is
[1:47:48] He that is in you
[1:47:53] there is power in this word pajamas
[1:48:00] powers in this word you can be sent here
[1:48:03] covered over with all kinds of spirits
[1:48:05] you can be sitting you're covering over
[1:48:07] with all sorts of things about your life
[1:48:09] but all you've got to do is believe in
[1:48:12] him that's freaking to you hallelujah
[1:48:18] Satan starts losing ground you might be
[1:48:33] under a juniper tree I can't go on I
[1:48:36] just can't go on I just can't keep
[1:48:39] pushing but God knows right where you're
[1:48:41] at
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:44] he's seen do it this place has been
[1:48:47] provided for you my strength is all gone
[1:48:54] I just don't feel like they can make
[1:48:56] another step this place is for you
[1:49:04] let me just tell you something
[1:49:06] the God that prepared that juniper tree
[1:49:09] was there to meet his servant the places
[1:49:16] God prepares he's there to meet you
[1:49:27] Elijah what are you doing here
[1:49:30] what do us now here Aichi are he has if
[1:49:37] God didn't know brother answers if God
[1:49:41] didn't know
[1:49:49] but God needs Elijah to come to his end
[1:49:59] in the message perfect strength
[1:50:04] where the bream talks about God allowed
[1:50:06] all of the church in that day all of
[1:50:09] that to walk away from Elijah Elijah
[1:50:13] took off running and Elijah was in a
[1:50:17] place of such weakness but God said this
[1:50:26] is where I want
[1:50:31] but Lord what's gonna happen I'm gonna
[1:50:33] cap his ministry cap his ministry
[1:50:38] you shouldn't it be another quadruple
[1:50:41] Mount Carmel experience oh this is gonna
[1:50:43] be greater how is this gonna be greater
[1:50:49] because I am going to fully achieve the
[1:50:53] purpose that I've intended to achieve
[1:50:56] through his life and God would allow
[1:51:01] this brother brand would bring it in
[1:51:03] perfect strength God would allow Elijah
[1:51:06] to get to his in so much that it Elijah
[1:51:09] said I'm the only one I've done this
[1:51:15] what they've done is they've slayed your
[1:51:17] prophets they've done this they've done
[1:51:19] that remember how Paul picked it up in
[1:51:21] Romans 11 how did he talk to you about
[1:51:23] Elijah was interceding against Israel or
[1:51:26] look what they've done look what they've
[1:51:27] done look what they've done look at it
[1:51:29] oh this was God's justice but God's
[1:51:35] mercy said I've got 7000
[1:51:39] there's a real net they're very small
[1:51:43] but I've got a rim that
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:51:47] you maybe don't see the effect of your
[1:51:51] message out there but I want you to know
[1:51:53] there is 7,000 that when you have
[1:51:57] yielded and courage has been given to
[1:52:01] them they're gonna stand now
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:15] we need those times I said we need those
[1:52:19] times we need those times when we feel
[1:52:21] like that our wheels are just spinning
[1:52:23] and it don't seem like there's no
[1:52:24] results
[1:52:25] we need those times for God sometimes
[1:52:27] they remind us but God doesn't always
[1:52:28] come down when we're crying about it God
[1:52:33] doesn't always come down when we're
[1:52:35] complaining about it but it's when we
[1:52:37] finally get to a place because the
[1:52:39] complaining doesn't invite him on the
[1:52:41] scene but when we get your place to say
[1:52:48] Lord I need you to fulfill this word in
[1:52:53] me Lord I can't do it on my own
[1:53:00] that's what maturity brings it brings a
[1:53:04] realization of our need for him let me
[1:53:11] just say this to you it might be a
[1:53:12] simple carnal example but I'm telling
[1:53:14] you right now my wife that little sweet
[1:53:17] heart that God gave me I need her more
[1:53:19] now than what I thought I did when we
[1:53:23] got married I realize now that Lord God
[1:53:27] haha I need her I need her I need her
[1:53:33] coming that's just here in this thing
[1:53:35] this time she is my best friend there's
[1:53:39] nobody I can talk to nobody can speak to
[1:53:42] me like she can how much more God you
[1:53:51] know if that means brother Carlos I know
[1:53:52] right now I need him more than ever but
[1:53:57] Trevor my strength won't cut it
[1:53:58] I need him brother Tommy my strength
[1:54:02] won't cut it
[1:54:03] I need his strength
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:10] just like God let Elijah get to this
[1:54:13] place to where he'd come to the end of
[1:54:14] his way God said this what I wanted to
[1:54:16] hear I wanted to hear that take me on
[1:54:21] home I'm no better than my father's I'm
[1:54:23] the only one left that's just what I
[1:54:25] wanted to hear
[1:54:33] he's in a cave now now Carmen juniper
[1:54:38] tree forty days to a cave this listen
[1:54:42] look what the strength of this meat did
[1:54:43] the strength of this meat carried him to
[1:54:47] the next appointed place
[1:54:55] I thought the third pool is just a no
[1:54:58] it's a it's not a public show it's not a
[1:55:02] public show look away to Jesus brother
[1:55:05] bream said don't ever let him tell you
[1:55:07] you're gonna be walking into hospitals
[1:55:09] and empty in her mouth you're not gonna
[1:55:12] be doing that that's not the working of
[1:55:14] the third pool the working of the third
[1:55:17] pool oh yeah miracles signs wonders yes
[1:55:21] but the overcoming this is individually
[1:55:24] God capping lives God comes and caps
[1:55:33] your life he caps my life in the way
[1:55:39] that he chooses
[1:55:43] here is Elijah what do us down here he's
[1:55:47] in a cave
[1:55:52] maybe he's quarantined is it okay
[1:56:01] what's the use of going out
[1:56:04] there nobody else I'm the only one
[1:56:10] God comes down and calls him out of
[1:56:13] there
[1:56:14] here comes a wind
[1:56:17] the Lord brings a wind Lord brings
[1:56:20] earthquake and he brings a fire but what
[1:56:25] followed that was a still small voice
[1:56:31] all of that earthquake wind and fire
[1:56:34] were all effects of God moving but it
[1:56:38] was the still small voice that calls the
[1:56:43] Prophet to wrap his face with his mantle
[1:56:45] and come out and talk to the Lord you
[1:56:51] see that cave that still small voice you
[1:56:54] can experience a lot of earthquake wind
[1:56:57] and fire but there's nothing that'll
[1:56:59] settle your soul like a still small
[1:57:03] voice from God
[1:57:06] after it's all said and done after the
[1:57:09] shouting after the jumping after the
[1:57:11] running I believe in that as much as
[1:57:13] anybody else but you know what I'm
[1:57:14] talking about when that's all said and
[1:57:16] done a still small voice is where you
[1:57:20] stand in authority God has spoke to you
[1:57:25] person and it's just it's settled let me
[1:57:28] just say something to you you watch how
[1:57:31] God can move so precisely in a service
[1:57:33] he'll move just like that supernatural
[1:57:36] star that guided the wise men and nobody
[1:57:39] else saw it it came to Jerusalem and it
[1:57:42] went out but when they left out of
[1:57:45] Jerusalem when none of the people could
[1:57:47] answer him as soon as they left out of
[1:57:49] Jerusalem that star came back to him and
[1:57:51] the started Adam to where it was taking
[1:57:54] him they thought Jerusalem might be able
[1:57:57] to help him you think a church a church
[1:58:02] you know maybe the church should be able
[1:58:04] to help but remember God is the one who
[1:58:07] has been dealing with your life sure
[1:58:12] some of you started in a church or you
[1:58:13] started here maybe God dealt with your
[1:58:15] life maybe in a Baptist Church or a
[1:58:17] Pentecostal Church or you know maybe it
[1:58:19] was even that
[1:58:20] a Catholic Church it might be hard might
[1:58:22] blow your mind about it but remember if
[1:58:24] that Catholic is trusting in Jesus
[1:58:26] Christ they mean their part of the bride
[1:58:30] but they're saved but you see a man had
[1:58:35] just been part of your journey God had
[1:58:41] something more for you but in the cave
[1:58:45] is where now God calls him out and he
[1:58:48] speaks to him in a steel small voice
[1:58:52] Elijah is at his end he can't take
[1:58:54] another step
[1:58:55] he can't go forward he doesn't see
[1:58:57] anything in front of him all he all he
[1:58:59] can eat weary he's worn he doesn't see
[1:59:03] why should I go on I'm the only one but
[1:59:06] God comes and strengthens him lets him
[1:59:09] know of the effect of the word but it's
[1:59:11] a still small voice that speaks to him
[1:59:15] God was letting him know what took place
[1:59:22] on Mount Carmel yeah there was a lot of
[1:59:27] noise there was a lot of movement but
[1:59:29] what you didn't see was that still small
[1:59:32] voice that spook to that 7000
[1:59:43] you know
[1:59:46] it's deep things things that are great
[1:59:52] they don't make a lot of noise
[1:59:57] think about how much noise you make in
[1:59:58] the middle the night but getting a glass
[1:59:59] of water or even during the day and yet
[2:00:04] the Sun drinks up billions millions of
[2:00:09] gallons whatever it is don't you got the
[2:00:11] point evaporating it you don't hear it
[2:00:13] you don't hear going on when the
[2:00:17] daybreak comes on you hear people
[2:00:18] sometimes flickering on lights and
[2:00:20] everything else but when the day breaks
[2:00:21] you don't hear it a wagon that is empty
[2:00:28] you hear it but when it's loaded you
[2:00:33] don't hear it as much it's the great
[2:00:38] things are the things that are still
[2:00:41] that are quiet it's God moves in and
[2:00:45] that stillness and once you think about
[2:00:47] this cave this cave today it's not a man
[2:00:54] may it's not a cave that's up in Horeb
[2:00:56] but this cave today that God calling you
[2:01:02] to calling me to this cave it might be a
[2:01:05] cave in your spirit it might be a cave
[2:01:09] in your mind it might be the cave in
[2:01:12] your soul
[2:01:15] and God is speaking to our hearts
[2:01:18] there's things let me just say it's to
[2:01:20] you very clearly there's things
[2:01:22] sometimes that you can get to looking at
[2:01:24] within your life let me just say the
[2:01:27] scripture said if our heart condemn us
[2:01:30] God is greater than our heart there
[2:01:37] might be things that you've got that are
[2:01:39] condemning you because you know you're
[2:01:42] not standing where you need to stand
[2:01:44] with God at one time you were fervent
[2:01:46] with God but you've lost your fervency
[2:01:50] and you started feeding on other things
[2:01:52] instead of the Word of God
[2:01:55] you see what happens when sin starts in
[2:01:58] alive and there's things that you fail
[2:02:00] to make right you say brother Samuel
[2:02:03] ain't no way I can make it right there's
[2:02:04] a blood for you to make it right there
[2:02:07] is a Holy Ghost that says make it right
[2:02:10] I mean you say it in terms get that
[2:02:15] monkey off your back there might be
[2:02:24] things in your spirit that is so poor up
[2:02:28] maybe things that you've set maybe light
[2:02:30] as you've told may be things you
[2:02:34] shouldn't have said maybe a way you
[2:02:36] shouldn't have talked to your wife or
[2:02:37] talked to your husband you got to make
[2:02:39] that right this is what the cave is for
[2:02:44] is to come to that place and say God I
[2:02:47] need you Lord I'm sorry Lord God forgive
[2:02:53] me that's all it takes it takes a real
[2:02:57] pouring out in your heart come on church
[2:03:02] it takes a real pouring out God brings
[2:03:05] us to this place why God's there he's
[2:03:08] not away from you he meets you there why
[2:03:12] you need strength for the journey that's
[2:03:15] before you God wants to use you hey
[2:03:19] listen Elijah God wants to use you
[2:03:22] there's three things you have left to do
[2:03:26] in order for Jehu Elijah
[2:03:30] Jehu and hay ZL to be anointed you got
[2:03:35] anoint Elisha remember the three things
[2:03:41] God told Elijah to do he anointed Elijah
[2:03:44] but it was Elijah that did the other two
[2:03:47] same God working through another vessel
[2:03:52] but it's necessary all those parts that
[2:03:55] are there got to work his brother Brent
[2:03:57] said sometimes in a cave of our memory
[2:04:04] there's any condemnation lay it out
[2:04:06] before God say Lord forgive me you win a
[2:04:09] straight god forgive me don't let the
[2:04:12] devil put you don't listen it ain't it
[2:04:14] is not God that puts you back in the
[2:04:16] cave
[2:04:16] God doesn't keep you remember he spoke
[2:04:19] to Elijah to draw him out of that cave
[2:04:22] to call him out of that cave into that
[2:04:25] place where God can let him see it's a
[2:04:28] still small voice that you need Elijah
[2:04:30] it's a still small voice that you need
[2:04:33] to minister to your life it's a still
[2:04:35] small voice for those of you this
[2:04:37] morning you're without strength in your
[2:04:39] life
[2:04:40] and you've come to a spot to say I'm not
[2:04:44] the end of my road let me just help you
[2:04:49] if you say I can't do it it's got to go
[2:04:54] a little bit deeper I agree you can't do
[2:04:57] it but if you can say Lord I can't do it
[2:05:01] I need you to do it Lord I need you to
[2:05:09] do it Lord I can't turn my life around I
[2:05:13] need you Lord help me Lord you wants God

[2:05:24] that cave to that place right there in
[2:05:27] your life God will step right on the
[2:05:29] scene
[2:05:30] I wonder here this morning that many say
[2:05:37] Lord I want to renewal
[2:05:44] I need to renew I'm weary so tired I
[2:05:50] need a renewal Lord I need a refreshing
[2:05:56] remember this refreshing it doesn't just
[2:05:59] come without confession let everything
[2:06:02] if there's anything at all just lay it
[2:06:04] out you don't have to search real deep
[2:06:05] if there's anything right there that's
[2:06:07] before in your mind to your heart just
[2:06:08] lay it out say God forgive me cleanse me
[2:06:12] Lord and let him come by in that still
[2:06:18] small voice and let him strengthen you
[2:06:23] he's got to work for you to do this is a
[2:06:26] camping it's a camping this working of
[2:06:33] this furtherance of the minute it's a
[2:06:35] camping Matthew six he's whosoever will
[2:06:39] hide himself and his closet and pray I
[2:06:43] will hear and he the father who sees in
[2:06:48] secret will reward thee openly
[2:06:51] it's not a public show it's a work
[2:06:56] that's taking place
[2:07:00] right inside the life of the individual
[2:07:03] it's not a little room somewhere you're
[2:07:05] going to it's right here
[2:07:09] you meet you right here I say Lord all
[2:07:16] of us if you need the Lord this morning

[2:08:00] need you I need you
[2:08:04] let's pray father you're Jesus
[2:08:15] I give this audience of myself Lord
[2:08:19] we're in your hands these needs that
[2:08:24] Lord that you would speak to this
[2:08:27] morning you would speak to our hearts
[2:08:31] strength for the journey that's before
[2:08:34] us it's not according Lord to the minds
[2:08:41] of man you come in such simplicity like
[2:08:47] the star that moved the wise men as your
[2:08:50] prophet would tell us he said that star
[2:08:51] can move right through an audience of
[2:08:53] people lives will be changed hearts are
[2:08:59] become so aligned with you the
[2:09:05] Scriptures would speak the kingdom of
[2:09:07] God cometh without observation now Lord
[2:09:11] I've prayed with and prayed for many
[2:09:16] many people many of your children but
[2:09:18] there's one thing that I can't see
[2:09:21] unless you would help me to see it it
[2:09:25] always begins it's in their heart
[2:09:31] you're you stood on the outside where
[2:09:34] they put you out on the outside of the
[2:09:37] church knocking in Revelations three who
[2:09:41] ever hear my voice and will open the
[2:09:44] door I will come in
[2:09:50] now Lord I can't no other man can bring
[2:09:55] a heart to that place but you're the one
[2:09:59] to bring a heart to that prepared place
[2:10:02] that you have for it to where it's
[2:10:04] willing to lay down that you can step in
[2:10:06] I pray God that even if they're not for
[2:10:11] that point yet I pray that God let these
[2:10:13] be words if they would take with them
[2:10:15] yes it would be words that when they lay
[2:10:18] their head on their pillow at night they
[2:10:20] think about it even become Lord of
[2:10:22] prayer in their heart that would say God
[2:10:24] bring me to that place that my pastor is
[2:10:28] talking about through your word bring me
[2:10:30] to that place Lord where I'm willing to
[2:10:33] lay it all down I got too much I'm
[2:10:37] trying to solve too much I'm trying to
[2:10:39] get right like a leopard you try to lick
[2:10:44] your sponsor they only stand out more
[2:10:45] you can't take away your spots you don't
[2:10:49] have the power but there is power in the
[2:10:52] blood of the Lamb
[2:10:54] there's power to loosen you it set you
[2:10:57] free
[2:10:59] not praying for you this morning
[2:11:04] father as many of your children here
[2:11:11] they've already received that experience
[2:11:18] with you they've had a cave experience
[2:11:22] Lord sometimes in the course of life
[2:11:26] your prophet talked about when you
[2:11:29] brought him into a little cave he had a
[2:11:34] little situation with that tax case and
[2:11:37] you called him into a cave he had to get
[2:11:41] condemnation away from his heart you
[2:11:46] gave that as an example to us to me I
[2:11:50] can so relate to a man like that
[2:11:53] I appreciate dear God that he he never
[2:11:58] tried to hide his humanity
[2:12:00] it just shows your greatness Lord but
[2:12:05] what an encouragement is I read Lord
[2:12:07] through the message over the years of
[2:12:08] listening and listening and listening I
[2:12:10] find over and over I find that the Lord
[2:12:14] is I'm listening to the message over and
[2:12:16] over not just in perfect strength but I
[2:12:20] find your prophet making the statements
[2:12:22] like he did in perfect strength when he
[2:12:24] said this Tabernacle needs a killing and
[2:12:26] I need one with it when he would say
[2:12:30] we're too strong when he would say in
[2:12:34] images of Christ while the Tabernacles
[2:12:36] have a revival I want to have a revival
[2:12:39] I want more of the Holy Ghost to take
[2:12:43] over more of William Branham he said I
[2:12:47] know that it'll take more it'll take
[2:12:50] more than just reading it'll take him to
[2:12:53] do it
[2:12:55] how so Reid I hear your prophet saying
[2:12:59] or this statements it struck me so much
[2:13:01] one of the other places when he was
[2:13:04] talking about the on coming of the third
[2:13:06] pole
[2:13:07] he told brother Leo write this down he
[2:13:10] said that will not be so much a change
[2:13:13] in my ministry as it will be a change in
[2:13:16] me Oh God
[2:13:24] that's what you're doing
[2:13:28] circumstances situations test trials
[2:13:33] these prepared places Lord that we
[2:13:37] wouldn't choose no one would choose as
[2:13:40] far as to say to feel the way that
[2:13:42] Elijah felt in yet Lord we've all been
[2:13:47] there maybe some are there this morning
[2:13:49] but that was a prepared place it was all
[2:13:53] in your orchestration now then don't
[2:13:58] seem very glorious to us but it Lord
[2:14:01] it's what you were going to bring out of
[2:14:03] that out of the juniper tree out of the
[2:14:07] cave

[2:14:24] church let anoint them with oil and if
[2:14:30] there be any sin it shall be forgiven
[2:14:34] you said if we confess our sins he's
[2:14:38] faithful and just to forgive us and
[2:14:40] cleanse us from all unrighteousness

[2:14:55] that God that your spirit would just
[2:14:57] move for every life and every heart

[2:22:33] halleluyah halleluyah think about it for
[2:22:41] a moment Paul would write under
[2:22:46] inspiration he was crucified in weakness
[2:22:51] but he was raised in power think about
[2:22:55] it says in Isaiah 53 everybody was just
[2:22:59] looking on oh he was such a great man
[2:23:08] why don't the Angels come and deliver
[2:23:10] him now they were mocking
[2:23:16] I think the Bible says God seen the
[2:23:20] travail of his soul and was satisfied
[2:23:25] what no one else knew was taking place
[2:23:29] was the greatest victory he already won
[2:23:34] the victory in Gethsemane it's being
[2:23:37] manifest right here but the rest of
[2:23:40] world didn't see it even caught satan by
[2:23:43] surprise here's the great the great one
[2:23:49] but you see it took that that weakness
[2:23:52] coming to that place but then God
[2:23:54] stepped in and raised him on that Easter
[2:23:58] morning at times how God brings us into
[2:24:04] those times not just in the new birth
[2:24:05] but then even after that then what his
