right now as they're under attack amen it's just uh any unspoken prayer request us this morning uplifted hand let's just go together with our brother uh just a quick testimony too um uh last week at work I'd been battling a sinus infection for like a couple of weeks and so I went to work it's actually after Thursday night felt pretty good and there was something I'd been working on for for a few months and I actually got some good news about it so I was I was doing pretty good and then Satan laid a uh a trap for me there and U and I actually failed so you say that's not much of a testimony but see a few a week before that or so brother Samuel had said something in his sermon he said you know when you're on the Mountaintop that's when the test comes so through the failure of that test I actually that that uh that became more real to me you know so we sang a song last last week where it said he looked beyond our our faults and saw our needs and you know I didn't I didn't need to pass a test at that moment God knows I it wasn't about that you know passing or failing but but uh what I needed was his word to become just a little more real to me and maybe maybe that day even through the failure you know maybe I made a half a step in my walk with the Lord you know and I'll take I I'll take that over a pass or a fail or you know just his word becoming more real to US mean means more than me than than what I do or don't do or or anything anything like that so I just wanted to to share that with you you know sometimes it's we we we never want to fail a test you know it always feels bad but you know even every single test that Satan lays isn't for you know one thing or another it's he he wants to destroy us you know so every test he lays with the purpose of destroying us but you know every time we walk past that test is a time that he failed so there's still victory in our failures so even even at the end we can come we can come out and say you know what God still give God the glory and it's still you know a victory for the kingdom of God and we'll learn from it so just wanted to kind of share that with you so let's just go before the Lord in prayer dear Lord Jesus we just come before you Lord we just thank you for this time this opportunity just another opportunity to come Lord and just to Worship You Lord and to exalt you Lord just hopeing everything that we do Lord that Lord you would be exalted Lord and I just pray Lord for the for this service Lord that you would just come Lord and just be able Lord to just manifest yourself to each and everyone Lord in just a special way this morning Lord Lord we're not here Lord to just see each other Lord or just to even gather with with with people Lord as a even as a lord some look at it as formality and such Lord but it's it's so much deeper than that lord it's coming another opportunity Lord Lord to meet with you Lord and to to learn of you Lord and to have a closer walk with you Lord and Lord that's our our our desires Lord we're just we're just thirsty Lord I believe just a people that comes Lord just thirsting Lord for a deeper Closer Walk with You Lord and Lord we just want to put these requests Lord before your throne of Mercy Lord in each each and every one Lord we just each one is you know serious Lord and in in in our hearts Lord as we want to hold them before for you Lord but Lord the prophet taught us Lord that by your stripes we were healed Lord and we weren't healed on any day we were healed you know 2,000 years ago and I always wondered about that didn't disbelieve it Lord but just didn't understand it Lord as in the other day I was reading in the scripture where where you was talking to Thomas and you said here's the nail prints in my hand and here's here's put your hand in my side where the where the spear pierc me Lord but the the stripes aren't mentioned in there Lord and I believe that you went down with the stripes Lord but when you Rose in your glorified body Lord I believe that your stripes were healed Lord as a representation lord of the healing that you're going to have for your body on Earth Lord so I believe all these request Lord that the healing was was done back then it's a finished work Lord your body was healed Lord so our bodies can be healed Lord and I just Lord I just pray Lord for each one of these requests Lord maybe just Lord realize that healing Lord physical emotional Lord spiritual wherever the case may be Lord you have already provided everything we need Lord and Lord we just want to commit all these into your hands Lord and just for the tithes and offerings Lord I just pray that you bless them Lord just exceedingly B may they go Lord to your intended use Lord and Lord I just pray you just continue to

to share a few words today's the first day of Pastor appreciation month and uh I just want to give him a rose now and uh just want to say I love you brother Samuel thank you for being a friend a good pastor and um you know if you uh want to text him or send him a card this month you know want to say something nice to him take him out for dinner or something you know just to let him know that you uh yeah he always loves food so preaches about it all the time so you know just uh say something to him let him know how much you appreciate him he goes through a lot um the enemy likes to come and

um and let's just give him a hand clap of Praise this morning we love [Music] you well appreciate that and I certainly love you all and U I'm just looking forward to us spending eternity together that's why all of our labors are for amen we pray we labor together and I tell you when we stand there on that day it's going to be worth it all and I I I pray that I am and I believe God will allow me to stand there to listen for every one of your names to be called Hallelujah I'm looking forward to that day amen you talk about a time of shouting well we're we're getting it use we're getting it right now because we have a liberty in our soul that's right that that the world's lost its hold on our lives even how God continues to move on our hearts it's just there's no grip there no more there's things just it's just passing away but to think about it on that day no wonder no wonder as the prophet lays that out we see it in the scripture when the Lord Jesus raised from the grave he was with them the Bible tells us in the book of Acts for a period of 40 days and the prophet said when he when that Resurrection comes we will be gathered with the Saints for a period of time of 30 to 40 days and he said you know he goes on to say it like this he says you see he knows that we're going to be looking around to see who made it that's right and so he gives us ample opportunity we're rejoicing but also going to greet but he wants at that time when he descends that all attention would be upon Him amen amen God's got everything arranged yes he does you know aren't you glad it's it's not something that we have to think about or worry about the whole Christian walk is a walk of rest am that's really what it is it's a rest in him and we're just we're thankful to be a partaker of that just so glad that each and every one of you here this morning uh I also have that down Sister Rita you give her testimony Hereafter before the communion time and we just want the Lord just to come and have his way and just to deal in our hearts and I want to just say brother Brian and the rest kind words and um you just let me know where you would like to go for [Laughter] dinner just teasing you but um we love you and the Lord and we just want to take a few moments and look into the word this morning and uh appreciate the musicians and amen don't you just thank God for our musicians amen I tell you I mean we've got to it's just a blessing um I've been I've been to assemblies that would have a have a few more in number than what we have and you know if if a song leader is not there the pastor is leading the song matter of fact another assembly that where I've been multiple times and uh they've um they've tried to say hey could we make some swaps here we'll swap you a few preachers for a couple song leaders because when uh you know the the song leader or the couple song leaders are not there there because of different duties and things then the pastor will lead the singing and then go right in and uh but you know all those times we we labor like we do we go ahead like we do and it makes you appreciate sometimes you know we we think back on that and I just want to say that the song leaders and also the musicians I appreciate because I know these brothers and I know the musicians they take it seriously and I really appreciate that that shows there's an atmosphere that's created because it it's not just that man it's not just the music positions but it's you coming with and putting your lick of fire together and I tell you what it's a little bit easier to enter into something like that and get together and because we we just have one purpose when we come here and that's to lift him up so let's look here in the scripture and I want to just uh for a few moments of verse 23 of 1 Corinthians 11 sorry I didn't tell you the chapter and I want to read from here and with this being where we'll uh take communion and and do footwall Wasing here after um ministering of the word and we'll give time that for any hearts that to be clear or any that would like to be prayed I know I've had one request already to pray uh for someone um so we we're we'll be willing to do that as well verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as of as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world I tell you when I I read that even in verse 31 and verse 32 I see the grace of God yes because even what would slip us I'm grateful that when it slips Us in some way whether it's we just Overlook it or we don't esteem it the same importance but I'm glad that God so loves us as our heavenly father that he'll correct us that's Grace that's grace verse 33 wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer heavenly father as we lord stand here in this moment Lord how grateful we are for your grace Lord Upon Our Lives Lord and father we are standing here this morning Lord with Lord a a desire Lord in our hearts Lord that just Desiring to please you Desiring Lord in every way that God that our lives would Lord be as vessels Lord that you are free to use and Lord that you're operating through you're manifesting your life and changing us Lord from Glory into glory Lord the whole part of our life is we just want our lives to be consumed by you Lord and I pray that Lord that you would just come by our way in these few moments and a very simple little thought Lord that you've placed on my heart for this morning I'm asking that you'll come Lord and and give me Grace that I can just step out of the way that you can say what needs to be said Lord for you know our needs Lord you know what we have need of and we just Lord look to you this morning that you'll come Lord and heal those that are sick among us visible and invisible audience Lord that you will Lord touch every heart Lord according to the needs in our life Lord we pray may you pour out of your spirit Lord and may you find God vessels Lord that are Lord open and available Lord and yielded Lord to you father for we love you Lord and we want to be closer to you Lord we want to serve you better Lord we just ask that you would have your way now in this service Lord may your presence Lord as we already sense it here Lord now as we just enter into that Lord and just to allow you oh God to just have your way now father we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I'd like to just speak here just for a few moments just on a just on a thought uh spiritual checkup and I want to just begin here with this part of it that you know communion itself when you we look at it and it's uh it's how the prophet referred to it as a it's a time of a showdown it's a time that I believe to examine our lives very closely under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and I I couldn't emphasize that enough that we want his guidance in our examination we want to know we don't want to go off on our own with it because we can go to either either extreme we want him who is is the truth he's the balanced one and we want to be under his guidance in that examining and I believe however I I believe that we would certainly be um uh living beneath our privileges if we only approached it and approached our walk or evaluating our walk we would be living beneath our privileges if we only did it when we knew communion service was coming up communion service when we think of that that's a testimony and I know there's been all sorts of things that you know could be laid out and you know sometimes you still have individuals that say well I you know I I don't believe we should take Natural communion it's spiritual communion but we want to stay with the word of God this is just like water baptism when you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that water does not save you that water does not clean you right but that is according to the word and it is as the scripture says you making an outward declaration that an inner work had taken place that's right that's what you're saying I'm not ashamed to be identified with him and the same way it is with communion you are testifying that the word of the Lord is abiding in my heart that he has changed my life He's My All In All and he and I are in Fellowship thank you Lord that I am a partaker not just not just at church that's why I'm so grateful that the real Gospel of Jesus Christ it brings that the relationship is not a membership but the relationship is a union between you and Jesus Christ that when you go into your job when you go back to your home it's god with skin on it's the Lord Lord right there to direct you with every problem every adversity every situation of life it's God living his own life through your yielded vessel and so communion means to talk with one another it means to speak with one another now I know sometimes we we all maybe some more than others we have habits where we don't we don't uh commune maybe we talk too much and you know we can step away from there and maybe it would do us all a realm of good to say what did the other person say well I I don't know you know I don't know I just I I don't know well did you do all the talking I guess I did you know um but communion and then you know even when we talk to the Lord in prayer you know brother Brandon would go over that many times he said you know he said sometimes even in myself he said I do too much talking and even we find that in prayer prayer is not about that you know it's how much that I can talk or how much that I can say you know sometimes as you've been serving the lord for any length of time your time in prayer and talking to the Lord sometimes you know it's just things that what you roll rolls out of your heart is just praise and thanksgiving there's needs to pray about but there's things that is just coming out of your heart that's just Thanksgiving It's Just Praise And I mean it's bubbling out at that in those moments and you know and there's times where in prayer that you have it to where you are worshiping and it seems like I don't feel anything taking place but you're creating an atmosphere you're you're wanting you're wanting just to invite him just to worship him in the situation cuz I I I would say friends that it wasn't a too it wasn't a very comfortable moment for Mary Magdalene to make her way to the feet of Jesus and wash his feet she had critics she heard their Whispers all around and she knew how it would be when she went into the into that house but she made her way because there was something moving in her heart that was greater than all of her feelings aren't you grateful that there is a pulsation of the spirit of God that can move in your heart that will actually supersede all of your feelings and all of your thoughts I I'm a witness and I know I'm speaking to other Witnesses and that don't ever stop but that's where the Prophet would tell us yield to that pulsation of faith and move with it because she didn't know how she was going to meet the need that God was calling her to do but God supplied every time God calls you to do something God Will Supply what's needed to accomplish the task that's so good and so when we look at prayer sometimes with prayer you know we know it's not just even uh the position of our body it's our heart and there's times where in prayer that and I I'm just speaking but I just say it openly that there's times in prayer where I've sat down in times you know and and I've ready to go into prayer sometimes it's happened when I may be in the midst of going into a meeting and and uh I might be in you know you're in a different setting maybe I'm in a hotel room and things and sometimes I just get out I don't want to disturb the family or my wife or anybody else and uh I just get out and find somewhere to prayer then there's other times where there might be another room in that in that hotel a room and get out there and you just find the presence of the Lord and there's not anything that you're saying out of hear but it's just meditation it's things that there's a communion and I'm hearing his voice and how that God is speaking you know to my heart and things that he's saying and and sometimes it isn't that I've even said anything auditorily but it's just been a moment in a time and before you look around how much time has passed by but it's a communion with the Lord amen and I just want to just encourage you that when we're looking at this of communion it's our prayer and it's being in fellowship with him and feasting on his word we are declaring that I am a partaker of his own life remember he he gave them he says except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood what was he speaking about the word that has been made flesh because you can't live you can't live from something in the past you've got to live by that which is present and which is life right and here he is declaring that and that's where you and I remember it was when Abraham when Abraham returned from the battle and he's returning back he meets mzc in Genesis 14 and here when he meets MDC MDC gives to him bread and wine after Abraham had fought the Battle and the battle if we can bring it this way the Battle of life you realize there was a battle that was fought in Gethsemane and he overcame there was a battle there here Calvary the lamb is offered up he went to the lowest parts of hell and he deposited our sins there let me just tell you the journey to the lowest parts of hell was not a joyful Journey but the Lord Jesus the Bible says has he endured the cross despising the shame he was able to look past all of the shame everything that he that he would have to go through and be put through because he could see your Delight in your joy in the Liberty that would be brought by his sacrifice and he did it because he could see your life liberated he could see your life my life changed he could see you healed he did it for the joy that was set before him and he endured it and then he offered there on the day of Pentecost who do we find coming back among the Believers the same God here he is delivering what the Bread and Wine to the old Overcomers it's the same mezc the same one that met Abraham is the same God giving to Abraham a feast to the Overcomer giving him what's needed and that's why even in the typ here of the Bread and Wine it's a type that we are a partaker of the word and the spirit we are true worshippers and this is why that when we we have that that own our testimony that even as we declare it here I'm a partaker of of the word of life I am one with him and so I I believe that that is something as we always want to stay before us um that that I want to be available to him I want to I I I I want to always be in a place we want to always be in a place not just certain times of the year where we become uh very uh uh conscious but we listen we want to be conscience of God at all times and and this life this world the way Satan is he battles to constantly to some in many ways to numb us to try to get our minds and there's listen there's so many things sometimes that we have on our minds and problems we're faced with and things that arise and sometimes you feel like I can't take another one I can't take anything else mouning up you you just feel like you're pulled in a mini million different places but you know even when we look at those those moments we say God help me Lord help me Lord I need your help I want to remain in that place to where that I'm conscious of him at all times where I however if however he wants to use me but it's also even in the ways that I'm not aware of that he is using me because in this particular even assembly how many of us have had people come over to us on even on your job or on others at different times your family listen your life is being watched not just what you say our lives are being watched and so they're watching that life they're watching our testimony what do we do where what do we stand for how do we approach things is is Christ the very fervency of our life or do we just have a a religion do we just have something that we do on certain days or is he our life is he our everything amen amen you see that's more important and that's more powerful than any words that we could say is a life to be lived amen many people will never give maybe a time of day for anything to be spoken verbally but your life continues to thunder out greater than anything we could ever say am we've all had these moments where of all the things that be said they'll find you on your job and say could you keep this in prayer can you keep this in prayer I remember the last school I worked at I mean I had a wonderful principal that knew you know she was a uh you know a Christian as far as all that she knew and so forth she'd come get me out of the classroom I what your class you go go pray for this one down the hallway down here will you go pray for this one they just got news that their husband got cancer and so forth so I just go do it I'm doing what my boss told me to do that's right uh but I really enjoyed working for her and uh you know we we'd have some different times even when situations would arise and um she'd call me in the office I got a big try these are things coming up so forth well you pray for me sure well let's have prayer let's look to the God for guidance on this but you see there's things that in other words you to have confidence in your prayer uhhuh yes to have confidence in your prayer to have confidence that you know how how does that confidence have it's not by how great we are in our speaking it's about the life that's what brings confidence so I don't believe communion in it in all is to be a scary frightful time see remember Catholicism is all about taking communion they call it Mass but it's all with the pretense of I hope I'll be accepted that's not Christianity this is in remembrance not only of the work he's done but as we're looking at what he did we are partakers of what he's done and is doing in me thank you Lord yes amen we're not doing it in fear of I hope I'll be accepted we are doing it in saying I know what he's done for me I know what he's doing in my life and I am rejoicing in the liberty and the Forgiveness of my sins that'sall so I certainly believe there should always be that devotion and sincerity leading up to it and this is where that when we look at this where Paul would write in 1 Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven that you might be a new lump as ye are unleavened so Paul's not taking anything from them but remember here among the people there was a situation that was in the church that was going on and going on where you had that you know a young man living with his um you know his stepmother and all those things and brother Brandon brings that right back down down to when we lift from under the protection of the blood and brother Brandon brought that same thing on down to even when you had uh the one the one young man who even just called someone a Holy Roller or the people in a church a bunch of holy rollers and his dad got up and relied him from the protection of the blood why cuz he wouldn't make it right is that right now we s Paul is dealing with this here because it's things that's been let go and it's just get and what's happening what Paul's looking and what he's saying is Purge out therefore the old leaven what's leaven it's sin right and he notice that you might be a new lump as ye are unleavened so you are unleavened God's done a work in your life but you need to take out Purge out those things that are hindering from me working and manifesting myself through through you that's so good good preaching for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with own Leen neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth it's a It's Our Lives devoted to him amen I want to just you know is just praying and I'm just looking you know to the Lord I going back through in the message I've heard but now I see and you know I've been really drawing from that for well over a year now and preaching on job but as I was going back through it here even in the other day and just praying over some things Lord do I continue on with that of uh humility with things you know I've studied and I believe this also pertains to that of humility but I want you to notice that how brother BR would bring this with job in job's life and his walk with God uh how many of you read in the Book of Job and you're aware that job is he is standing even when accusations are coming and you have men that are trying to say this is why this is happening and this is why this is happening and this is why this is happening and I tell you what if job had not had a revelation he' have been blown this way he'd have been blown this way he'd have been blown this way you see it would have come from this church to come from this church or this website this website you got to know where you're standing that's right the objective of the Gospel is that we be not blown around as children right but that we're stable we're solid in Jesus Christ we know in whom we have believed we know where we belong and we're standing and so when we look at it this is where why that that that brother Brandon when he takes that whole message on I have heard but now I see you realize that job was in a place that he knew where he was standing that I've not sinned now job was not listen to me now job was not looking at himself he was looking at the sacrifice because God had spoke to job's life he had revealed the provided way like he did to Abel like he's done to every other believer is that right he did that and job responded to that word and now even job we don't we don't have all the way down through there but it's undoubted job had mistakes job had flaws job had failures but he had a sacrifice he had a revelation of his Passover and job had a revelation that in this re in this sacrifice this word that's been revealed lays my cleansing lays my healing lays the atoning work for me so so job's s complete confidence was in the sacrifice amen so good yes sir I know what I don't want to go all the way here but just let me drop this point but what even Satan was doing when caused his friends to turn against him and begin to say all of these all of these things it was actually started even though job where he was standing was true it started to pull job in into a place to where he was justifying himself let me just tell you something you or me and ourselves have can we have no grounds of justifying ourselves the best week you have you still are in need of the blood of Jesus Christ we are in need of his righteousness amen so the desire to be perfect it's not about that my one column my ones versus losses oh I've got more ones than I've got losses that's not what it's about our desire for Perfection is to please him amen that's that's that's what Perfection is is to have that that that right there that there then there's nothing that's in between that because even when things come up in our life and the Holy Spirit deals with our heart quickly say Lord forgive me and get it out of the way why that's Perfection working upon your life to be pleasing to the Lord so brother Bram was talking about faith having a channel to move into and he says it like this and I have heard but now I see he said job was checking himself with the genuine faith that God had give to him that he was just and that he had done everything that God required him to do now I want you to catch that job was checking himself with the genuine faith that God had given he was not checking himself by what the men were saying he was checking himself with the absolute that he had received which is that Revelation from God personally to him you you see what I'm saying because we will disappoint one another that's why you have to have an absolute in your life and that absolute is to be Christ revealed to you that he is my redeemer he's my savior he's my Lord he's my healer he's mine and I am his you have to have that absolute and that absolute comes between you and God alone then when everything else is against you you've got grounds that you can stand on it's an anchor that holds you it's an absolute this is why brother bam goes on to say he says when we're going to be prayed for for our sickness I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do I I I love this this personal placing we're we're approaching God on things now it should be the first thing have I done everything he's required me to do amen you see I think that should be a very a very a litmus test that before we're writing for others to pray are you in position to receive it are you hearing me now because you know we're not just going through acts of well I know I got this need in my life but God will never move if the Channel's not right so listen if you're praying and asking God the thing that you also have we have to be listen friends God God's not standing there ashamed for you and I to say Lord my heart's not in the right channel God wants us to be honest with him am cuz he sees it anyhow amen he already knows right and it's what God wants us to to be honest with him and say Lord Lord I now want my life my heart in the right Channel and as a believer that should be an examination because listen friends just as much as an inspiration can drop for our healing as brother Bram goes on into here for other things just as much as that inspiration will drop for healing we are to be in channel for Rapture amen for that inspiration to drop let me tell you something God's not God's not going to move at the last 30 seconds and get us ready to go God's getting us ready he sent a word to prepare us for that moment against that day amen so that's the reason you know when let me just move on from there this is why when the when as Peter would say in First Peter 4:17 the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel listen how brother brandham approaches this and how can I overcome he says when we come here we are here for one specific purpose right this is the house of correction am this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God now if you just say Lord I'll lay aside even all my complexes against correction I'll lay aside all of my complexes about this because as soon as a scripture or something can be read like this you can just but you got to understand when God is coming to correct you he's not doing it out of frustration amen God never chastens us out of frustration that's so good he doesn't do that and God knows exactly what you're able to handle and I'm able to handle no more than just when when our children we come to a place to R realize when do we start to discipline them there's got to be a time right there's a time where they start you start seeing where they're recognizing and then they're starting to push the envelope a little bit and you're realizing boundaries must be established here I mean they can't help it when they're so small they cry right they cry you might say I know some big crybabies but you you've got people that listen as a baby they don't how and they're not doing it Defiance like well they're really screaming here they're they're they're two months old they don't know how else to respond but when you start seeing the no and then that's when correction comes is to establish boundaries for their health wow how do we get here but you see what what real correction is about it's not about despising it's not about frustration it's real genuine love because what correction does the Bible says is Drive the foolishness out of the heart Hallelujah God doesn't he just like God knows when to do it he knows when to he knows when to bring correction how to bring correction he watches over all these things in our life and I'm glad you know God God doesn't operate the way that sometimes even in the timeline and even the way to bring correction cuz we might be looking at it that it's something that my it's got to be something if maybe if I can put the visual where the belts got to come off and it's you know spiritually speaking here even where the belt's going to come off correct correct is not always that there's many times you've received correction I've received correction even on your job you've received correction and it hasn't been a demoting a Dem meriting or where you've been docked in pay or kicked out of work for a day there's times where correction can simply come hey don't do it like this do it like that it's correction so correction is not always something that's right flames of fire shooting out of their eye it's not always correction that's right that's good but it doesn't matter how we take it it's true because if we don't take it in that way and in that manner then there will be why that's his grace brother said here we come together and we gather here and we are under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is among us and we're here to take Reckoning among ourselves that means to to calculate to think of to see where our short places are our shortcomings and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be so that's the whole purpose of Us coming here amen it's it's God coming and let me just say something friends as I said correction itself isn't alt together you're doing this wrong you're doing that wrong no remember brother BR says study where we are and catch where we need to be yes that's good when I worked at the greenhouse my boss no doubt he kept me on in the Summer where with a couple other guys that played football man some of the work he'd have us do I know it was just it was like cleanup work but it was hard work right picking going down them plastic green houses on my hands and knees picking out weeds before he put the black tart down be 10 and something degrees in there with them fans and my nose didn't respond to that well bloody nose and things and he'd run out for a little bit swigging the water down but I I look back on this time and there was things that when I would stand there this is for me and I how God has made me but I also think that we all kind of look this I would I wanted to know what's the plan for the day is this all I'm going to be doing today what's the outcome what's the goal why so I know checkpoints along the way right we're going to do these three green houses you're going to do these three green houses today then we're going to come to the warehouse and we're going to stack trays and it's like you know where you're at that's how God does that's why this bride message listen to me now that's why this bride message is not a message of man handling man because you're not brought in position by pressure that's good you're brought in position by the Holy Ghost that's right hallu Israel gets put back by national pressure but we're not put back by naal national pressure we're put back by the Holy Ghost and God will use measures of Correction but what I'm trying to say to you is is that what greater way of correcting when you're even learning a job you're looking at something is to see one who is perfect calling you to Perfection so you don't have a fallen image speaking to a fallen image you have the image of Jesus Christ reflected through Fallen images but it's him that we're looking at it's him that we're seeing we're looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of it that's why he the word is to be set before us because he's what we're to strive for he's what we're to press for because our life is to be molded Amen to match his image sure shortcomings we're here to see where our short places are boy what a comfortable thing to look at huh where you going going to let my get my shortcomings made known right yeah but our shortcomings are faults failures to meet a certain standard typically in a person's character plan or system and we all have them yeah see the Holy Ghost is an inward work that begins inwardly and comes outward right amen he works from the inside out true the Holy Ghost is the gift of God to be born again it's God's Sovereign Grace but our character is a victory and victories do not come without battles and guess who the battles are not my brother not my sister not my boss not my this the battle is my own self right contending with my own self when here is the word in front of me well brother Samuel they're acting disobedient to the word but your attitude might be disobedient to the character of Christ and God is allowing that to be showed up to see will you allow him to mold and make you and give you overcoming Gra in that area don't mean that it's never going to bother you but you have to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks and recognize then that the god in you has already overcome that thing this is why brother Bram could say in the message Faith forgive us of our shortcomings all of the things that we've done that's wrong even our wrong thoughts right we pray that you'll forgive us on our motives if they're not just according to Thy word and thy will forgive us Lord and let us ask Act only in thy will Amen in the message Look Away to Jesus brother Bram is just talking about the effect of the third pool coming into his own home with a healing of his wife and he opens and he says we thank we are thankful father forgive us of our shortcomings I know that seems very very simple but that's very much a part of our prayer amen because we have them we have where we've missed the mark right I mean when I'm shooting my bow in or testing that out or you shooting a gun you don't go out there to say man I wonder where we can shoot this Arrow so we can go find it no way sometimes they get dug in the ground and you don't find them to a year later you what do you do you set the target up and you try to hit the target but you don't all of a sudden go out to 40 yards and do it you get you you you go in close and then you work your way back out and you're seeing where your grouping is at you're shot that are fired is it around where I'm aiming because if you can hit it close up you hit it further back right and the reason you're you're doing what they call sighting it in because you got to tune it there's some things that's got to be dialed in you're drawing about all my no it's not hitting right what do you do you you you you dial it in why do you do that you say me brother Samuel I don't even hunt but you you're getting the point though right why why why is that done it's done so that when it matters you're ready that's why it's important as we're coming to the house of God we just don't shoot our gun in shoot our bow in and say bless God I can put it in the case I got it all sighted in no it needs to be checked continuously amen why because we've got to Target The Rapture that we're focused on Amen least little things even sometimes in travel were different ones as I've heard I've never traveled myself and had things toted or the gun or bow or things like that but different ones where they've traveled with those things and they get to the location they're going to hunt and then they find out they go out there and they test it why because during the trip even though it's padded it's got such padding that squeezes that gun in that case or that bow in that c it squeezed so tight it looks like oh this is nothing's going to move move this sight out of line you test it anyhow why because it matters that's right and many times little bumps little turbulences little things of Life can get it out of sink that's so good that's why we always need to test it on the target amen it's a checkup that's look look how brother Ram says this we are small people we are uneducated more or less an illiterate people but we are so thankful that we have a great omnipotent God who watches over and cares for us for we don't know how to care for ourselves we commit ourselves to you the Bible says in Proverbs 14:15 the simple believeth every word but The Prudent man lookth well to his going you know you speak of this of of the checkups I know that uh when we talk of checkups it's not like when we're sick you know anybody a lot of times when you're sick you we would go to the doctor or we go somewhere like that and we we want to we want to hey whatever if there's a assistance that's needed we want to feel better but yet we understand we're talking about checkups here it's more than it's not just about when we're sick but it's even in the times that we and ourselves we feel very good we feel well and every one of us have been listen don't go to sleep on me now everyone don't go oh no but saying my wife's been nagging me about this I don't want to do that I I'm sorry I don't mean to get you in a bad mood but keep it spiritual here you know the the the screenings the physical exams that you have to do you don't have to do it they recommend you do it why do they recommend you do it why is some of the ages and things that they change why do they do that brother Samuel they're just after money okay friends I we we understand certain things but why is is it that they put that out there like that with screenings right why do they have screenings to be done why do they have things what's the objective is to try to work in prevention before something takes place is that right how many individuals that when they went for certain screenings didn't want to go but boy are they glad they caught that cancer yeah they're grateful right there's so there's times that even when we would go in maybe we're feeling something in our body that we can't even explain what's going on so immediately like any wise person we do we call up Google sure enough I've got this thank God that thank God we can't print out pharmacy license because I'm sure we'd all have our Pharmacy Li I need to write out this prescription they have said I have this this this this and this sure enough that's you know what I feel like that now oh my goodness yep I'm I'm feeling it have this prescription there's a lot of things that can change why do those ages change why do they change ages when you get certain screenings why have they done that cu the hybrid condition that we're in yep the hybrid food well bless God you know my parents ate biscuits and gravy every morning and man I should be able to do yeah but they things were a little bit different yeah and even the way things were right I mean you're not talking to a person that don't like more biscuits and gravy more than anybody else I love it let me just say it like this it'd be better to have a checkup than to have an out autopsy right yep because an autopsy there's nothing you can do about it y the results are final that's why it's important to have a spiritual checkup continuously let our lives be evaluated by the word of God because once it passes out of this lifetime we we don't have the next opportunity we don't have that opportunity now it becomes an autopsy what happened to this person well they turn a letting down here this starting to happen and this and it becomes a shipwreck a car wreck becomes something that when they're wrecked off what happened oh it started with this it started with that it started with this just little things and now what happened right because an autopsy is going in to find out internally what was it that led to this death that way that's what was the cause that's why we need spiritual checkups not just wait for communion service but allow the Holy Spirit every moment of our life Lord examine my life I get many other scriptures here but the the the thought of is is already all brought together David is asking God here and I do want to read maybe one scripture David is re is referring and asking the Lord in verse 26 or verse two of Psalms 26 examine me oh Lord and prove me and try my Reigns in my heart this is what we want you know it takes it takes humility it takes first of all it takes humility to go in for a checkup it takes humility for us to allow the word to examine our life you realize just coming to church is not enough humility that's right you've got to let the word examine your life it's got to open up to a place to where God how do you see me listen friends don't judge yourself by well the person that's school or the person might oh man you see them they got nose rings all over they got purple pink hair they got this well sure I could look at that and feel pretty good but that's not what you're to judge by you don't judge yourself by somebody else you judge yourself by the word CU if you judge yourself by somebody else you'll feel pretty good man I got this thing all I'm a better person than them I mean I mean look at them they're all this and that you're looking at the wrong thing that's right and you know what that does that produces produces a condition of lukewarmness that's goodl to where all what you're looking at and evaluating your life by is something that you're hit you're hitting it a little bit closer to the Target but that's not what it's about right it's about where are you in your walk with the Lord what does God say Amen what does he say what does he say about where I am that's that's that's the open that now listen friends we should be able to speak on these terms like this and not become oh I don't know where I'm at I I don't we should be able to be able to look at the word of God and invite God to evaluate our lives and not in a manner do I have the Holy Ghost don't I have the Holy Ghost but evaluate our lives in a term to realize I know where my heart is at and you know where your heart's at if you don't have if you haven't moved to that place where it's a love affair because when it's religion it's miserable how do you know been there done that got the t-shirt it's miserable right because it's just form there's nothing in the heart It's Not A Love Affair it's keeping myself looking right for everybody else around me or if I don't do this God's going to be out to get me that's not a love that's fear that's right oh I want to be pleasing there's a difference between wanting to be pleasing to him and being fearful in a tormenting fear God's desire through Calvary was to bring the love of God into our hearts that we could see the love of God perceive it that he laid down his life for us and then receive that fire that was in his bosom into ours that's so good and it's a love affair you know what love does love does makes you do things even when you don't feel like doing it that's right ites love causes you to sacrifice your own will your own ideas it causes you to evaluate things and look at what's really important that's what that's what real love does I want you to think of this here David's asking God examine me now I know how many people how many can carry this Bible around or even have our message but how many invite this because you see when we get into this place of examination it's it's bringing Jesus off the cross out of the grave and personal to our lives that's so good where does our lives match up with the word that's so good examine me Lord now I'm going to tell you the heart of the Bride of Jesus Christ it is a heart that desires to be examined and to be pleasing to him yes sir Hallelujah it's like when we like when I would you know you had had to have physical exams when I played Sports it was no choice then you'd go in there I remember some guys I could call their names right now I went to school with in s Dusky these guys were physical specimens I mean that I'm not exaggerating but after they get when they went through that physical exam some of these young men men that I had I'm talking about out of my class they wanted to play basketball they wanted to play football boy we we would have loved to have had them I mean I guess if they'd have been a team player I don't know how they'd have been on a team but as far as athleticism I mean the guys were just you know they probably came out of the wound defined you know there's people like that you know they any we won't go there but they get him in a physical exam but they had a heart murmur and they couldn't play they wanted to but they had a heart condition that wouldn't allow them to play you see you have to let the word discern your heart is there anything in your heart that's presenting that's preventing you preventing God from bringing you fully in that's okay oh Lord I I I really want I I really want to serve you but will you have listen listen you have to evaluate your heart and then listen friends that evaluation of your heart never stops never stops God it's not us waiting on God it's God waiting on us that's right and I think my what if they would have just what if it had been me I mean if it had been to me like hey I want this guy man he'd be a good he'd be a good he'd be a good safety this gu be a good safy Rock Solid and coming up there flying and man it'd be great what if they to ask me hey Sam what do you think man I think this guy be good as us I'd be going what I see on the outside but what's on the inside if he gets out there he could die that's why it's important friends that you go all the way with the Lord amen go all the way with him let let him do a a full work a full change in your life let him examine every area of your life and if you put any any any signs up restricted area listen I'm just going to tell you God won't blow it up God won't tear it down you just pull back he pull he's a gentleman he'll never force himself on anyone oh brother Samuel I've accepted him as my savior he'll stand on the welcome mat won't move a one foot more in your life right you are the one who is in control of how deep he goes if you want him to stay on the welcome mat he'll stay there well I don't want him to stay there well then say Lord take everything out of me yes well brother s what's that mean take everything out of me like like I've got magazines plugged in here no it's desires take anything that I have the slightest value where it's even equal with you or even a little above you take everything that I value and let it rise to the place to where I only value him and him alone amen that's good because then you're in a place of surrender yes and let me say this that's ongoing in your Christian walk God continues to deal with our lives once he's brought us into that that place there's things that we can testify in our lives that maybe in the first parts of our Christian Journey we can look back on and say wow God's brought me from there to where I am now some things that I used to hold on to and I'm not talking about you understand friends as Believers I'm not talking about running around the world I'm talking about things that we look at in the way that you begin to look at as a believer of you begin to look at in terms of what things that hinder the working of the Lord in my life that's how you evaluate it's not about oh I because Paul said all things are lawful unto me but all all things are not expedient right you Lov him that's why in this exam you know when we you have it they look for sometimes you can see things outwardly right you can see things that sometimes the doctors will look at things and they can tell outwardly hey hey something's wrong outwardly and listen friends let me just say this that's why that within this the scripture says let a man examine himself what I just read here for our text let a man examine himself you know what God desires for us to do is to look at that word take the word and examine our own lives by it that's you talk about making God proud and our lives surrendering to that this is why the scriptures says the same word that we in that scripture we used examine himself you know that same word is also same meaning same meaning in the Greek is the same word that says because they did not like to retain God in their conscience that's good God gave them up to a reprobate mind they didn't want him I don't want this condemnation in my mind mind I don't want we're living in that time the world hates absolutes that's right they hate the absolute of traditional family hate the absolute all of these things they hate that you know where that come from from the pits of hell that's right yes sir Satan knows if he can get people away from even the protections of the word he can destroy them Y and sometimes people are walking under under their they are still partaking as far as in a manner of certain principles and yet yet Satan can come around so slightly through media through all other things because let me tell you something it's Spirits yes and it works to do what remove that fortification that protection remove them from all of those principles but this is why it's got to be more than just a word you're holding out here it's got to be more than just a principle out here it's got to be the Principal in here it's got to be something that's holding you it's evaluating it's God listening to our our lives I'm glad that you know when they go in to do blood work remember one of the first times when they they did some of that at school you I want to go I want to blood work done I don't want to T stff done you know because you start thinking what's my cholesterol level going to be what's my this going to be you know what you can feel very fine you can feel good good but blood work don't lie that's right that's right doc the doctor said how you been doing doing fine doc only eating two box of debie cakes a week doing good doc okay I've been doing real good I've been watching my this and watching my that blood work don't lie we know that man we can say all the things I've been watching I've been watching I've been blood work don't lie right so you know sometimes listen friends sometimes even what we see on the outside let me just tell you something don't diagnose one another because sometimes what you see on the outside may not have anything to do with sin it might actually be having everything to do with something that a person is going through so God's not called us to examine one another he's the one that examines us and then we take what he has said and examine ourselves how by presenting ourselves to him and even cuz sometimes everything can seem so right on the outside oh the teas is the teas is crossed the eyes is dotted and this is right and this is right and that is right but God said let's do a little bit of blood work ah I see some plaque buildup that's floating around we need to put you on a little bit of a blood thinner thin it down I know some of you like man this is real encouraging no I'm talking about spiritual God will bring out the spiritual Ste stethoscope Lord everything is good to go he begins to listen oh your lungs are not full capacity you're you're something's wrong you're not operating in full capacity it begins to hear in your heart oh what's that a doing there what's that Grudge doing there what's that and he he begins to do a checkup up you know why that checkup is about it's for prevention come on we can finish this an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure that's an oldie but a goodie this is what the holy spirit is doing friends not just service after service that's why it's important that we as we're in the house of God you're tuning in you're it's evaluating our Liv not just listen don't don't I encourage you it'd be like this you go to the doctor you get the results how many you know what I'm talking about in the natural no hands are going up just head nods just nod the head buddy it matters what you do with the results yeah yeah it matters what you do with what the word is saying about your life in the service at the end of the service and after the service don't take your results and put them on the counter and then your wife has to say what are these here put these in your office they go here that's where everything else goes I just put here just put them in here put them in here put them in there put them in there you know and it becomes like you don't leave things lay around that you care about right and let me tell you something the re exams that God brings our way he cares he cares do you care it's a moment a time that our lives would be really examined because I I want I want the checkups I need the checkups I I don't want to become a casualty that an autopsy has performed on what happened to them they were so on fire they were so fervent my it seemed like the world was going to come apart what happened oh it just started little by little a little bit of forsaking to assemble together forsaking prayer forsaking oh brother Samuel I read and I pray and I listen friends there's a lot of things that we can do understand me now religiously that's good but are you obeying all the work that's good do you evaluate all the work are you living day by day Moment by moment that I want my life to be pleasing to him amen In A Love Affair not like the Bible says let every man be careful for he that thinketh he standeth lest he fall why why would Paul put that in that that that chapter because in that chapter is where he's talking about God sent a prophet here came the pillar of Fire here came The Parting of the Red Sea here they were baptized unto Moses here came the Mana here was The Rock in the and they were just looking at all of this all around them no possibility in me falling you've already started to fall as soon as you begin to look and evaluate your life and your walk by something besides the word of God and it's not listen friends that's why it's not enough just to have our own little communal part just Among Us ourselves as our family and just among but we want the word of God yes because the word of God Don't Lie amen it's like the blood work it don't lie it gets down to where the needs are at in our life and this is our desire I want him to be on display yes Lord the Rapture is my goal that's what I'm that's what I'm looking forward to am and until that moment of catching away I want to live every moment pleasing to him amen that doesn't mean you've got to quit your job it just means you've got to Val you've got to Value him more than you value your job because after all he gave it to you and God never gives you something to take you away from his presence right oh that's too much of a burden you're listening to the wrong person you need to evaluate it based on the word of God it's a spiritual checkup right how many times they tell people hey you better slow down right you better slow down I can keep going I can keep going hey you got to slow down I say God continue to help us Lord a spiritual checkup regular checkups why it's prevention brother Bram identified that I'm closing brother Bram identified that I we just where the churches had got to they didn't aim to get there the the Pentecostal Church didn't need to get to where it is today but how did it how did that happen they neglected the examining by the word and it got to a place to where they no longer wanted to word to examine their lives you're not telling me I'm overweight you're not telling me I need to lose a few pounds this is fall buddy this is pumpkin pie season this is Apple Cris time not now oh I'll wait till after the first of the year that's when I'm really going to tone it down always putting off for another day and you can't and we do that it becomes easier easier easier easier but why put off to tomorrow what you can do today it's about this moment it's about this time it's about the moment of Lord I want every moment to count I want my life to match your word amen and I'll tell you the grace that is so solemnly and sovereignly given by God that even if you're not standing where you need to be standing today no matter where you're at God has sufficient Grace to release to you not only a pardoning of your sins but to also realign anything that's got out of line Thank You Lord because you start going off in one little area it'll lead to a greater angle friends that's why we need him amen that's why we need him that's why just us taking the word in according to our own reasonings it'll never work it's got to be him it's got to be him and when we can see it from him we can present ourselves and say forgive me Lord amen Lord let me rise and try again Lord Lord forgive me of my faults and my failures where I've missed the mark where I'm missing the mark Lord give me Grace Lord I accept not just give it but I accept the grace that's given in this checkup you love him yes sir let's just SP our heads in a word of

side here and I was really down I didn't want to say nothing to anybody you know was a devil was speaking and then my precious brother Samuel he preached and had just touched me when he preached it don't matter if you're die either way you're healed if you die from it if you're here either way you're healed so in my heart that black Satan's eye one more time cuz the devil was woring with me over the Mas that the doctor that they had bound he was here on my right side he was probably about that big and um well me and sister py two weeks ago went in they wanted a biopsy we went into the have my biopsy done well anyways I'm going to say this first py come to have coffee with me the night before I was to go in and them do that and um I looked at her before she left I said I ain't got no cancer

Lives we're no longer we're the same Lord we're we're Witnesses of what you've done in us a paradox and we ask that God that is this bread Lord representing the precious body of our Lord Jesus oh God when there was no way for us to get back you became the way back lord you stepped down lord God and took on a body of Flesh no wonder Lord as a prophet could call it what humiliation the king of glory stepped down to Adorn himself in a robe of Flesh and bone to pay that price of redemption that's what Grace really is Lord Grace is the result of when the price has been paid that's why we can preach Lord of this message of Grace because every requirement for a Kinsman has been met it has been [Music] satisfied thank you for going to Calvary for for us Lord thank you Lord for making a way for us that we can come into our inheritance as Sons and Daughters of God thank you for shedding of the blood Lord when there was nothing Lord God that can cleanse the stain the stench the desires Lord can do the work but you shed your blood to pay the price to satisfy the debt to not only purchase us out of the slave market but such a purchase that we can never be sold again for we have come back into under the possession of our rightful owner oh God how we thank you Father for the blood that was shed and inside of that blood cell Lord was this life life oh God lord is the wine representing the blood that was shed and inside of there is the life that then comes back Upon Us Lord Cries Out Freedom redeemed oh Lord we love you this morning God I pray Lord Jesus we thank you for healing our sister Lord we thank you Lord God for every life that you've touched Lord we thank you Lord [Applause] God we're unworthy but we thank you Father may you bless your children Lord in the name of Jesus
