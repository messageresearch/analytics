Minister to every need that's here Lord as we said moments ago sometimes when we come it's it's not hard Lord to raise our hands and and to worship truly Lord no matter how we feel it's not something

the house of the Lord this morning and amen I want to say it was good to see uh Brother Carlos out there at his post and uh welcoming amen the saints of God in and um I tell you when when you're not here you're missed and I don't know even when my boys they got home on Thursday night said man I miss Brother Carlos being there just you know that smile and gree us at the door you know and so we that means a whole lot and um so we're just so thankful for that and uh I want to say it's good to have uh good friends here brother Ivonne and sister Linda amen and we just uh so thankful to have them you're with us I want to ask you as we're getting ready to read the word of the Lord I want to ask you to remember us in prayer um there's a event we're going to here in hosting and brother Paul and myself and other ministers and um then from there and that'll be through the first part of the week and then from there uh my wife will take take me to straight to the airport on Thursday morning I fly to Belgium for for a men's meeting uh that'll be going on over there through the weekend so um it'll be through the night and then hit the ground running on Friday and then um come back home on Monday morning of course it'll be Sunday night for you all um so I look for a Sunday night flight out of there by the way if I could have stepped from the pull pit onto a plane and you know I've never um haven't met you know the Brethren and things like that that are over there but um um Lord willing meeting up with brother Barry coffee there and then we'll we're going on over for that meeting so you just would you be in prayer for us Lord will just give us safe traveling mercies and as well as for the meetings that are there I know they're under great expectation and so I would just ask the Lord just that he would bless that let's look here in the scriptures um I want to begin reading at vers verse 8 um this as we start to look at it this is where the the first time as we said last week where Ruth would actually have a very personal encounter with Boaz she's in his field already um but she now is going to have a personal encounter as far as where he's going to speak to her then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from thin but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have not I charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art of thirst go into the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger what what humility is coming out of her heart and Boaz answered and said unto her it hath been fully showed me all that thou Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and art come to a people which thou knewest not hither toor the Lord recompense thy work now remember all of this that's been done that we just read that Boaz has taken knowledge of Ruth has not done this out of trying to earn merits remember as the prophet lays that out in the in the opening of the Holy Ghost series he said Ruth she was moved by that of a purpose of God that was moving her to make the decision she was making now Ruth had to make those decisions just like you and I have to make those decisions being a child of God an elect child of God a seed of God that doesn't remove making decisions that's what allows you to make the decisions you do as the influence of the Holy Spirit would come upon you to do so so only what's being worked out Boaz is taking notice of what has been already working out in Ruth's life then he says the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust then she said let me find favor in thy sight my Lord or we can read it I believe I will find favor in thy sight for thou Hast comforted me now notice what real Comfort does real Comfort it isn't it brought her to a place it it's it how God is how it's Boaz is speaking to her hearest thou my daughter it's settling her it's giving her of a of a greater encouragement I shall I believe I shall find favor why for thou Hast comforted me for that thou Hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though I be not like one unto one of thine handmaids in verse 14 this is where we want to draw from again this morning and Boaz said unto her at mil time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers now remember watch how her position she doesn't go and set in the middle of them or try to draw attention to herself she just in humility she sits down with the rest of them she is coming into places that she's being invited into remember when Jesus said when you come into a feast don't take the uppermost seat unless you're asked to step down but when you come in take take the lowest position then he that's governor of the feast will invite you into other places and that's the way it is with the Lord when we are serving the lord as God deals with our heart he invites us into justification invited into sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then the culminating as it works into the adoption so it's God always inviting us it's not us putting ourselves anywhere it's not us even meriting some someplace it's always just going where God has invited us I want to take up his invitation don't you brother BR would take a whole series on identification and preach and continue to use that same term invitation when we have an invitation for our character to be molded to his I I want to take that invitation don't you that's one invitation I want to RSVP and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left let me read this quote to you before I let you be seated out of redeem demon Redemption this is a wonderful message if you haven't listened to it recently brother Bram says when it comes the midday and he said you get tired come over and sit down under the tree and take the morsel of bread and dip right in with the rest of them I like that that's Fellowship get around under the shade tree always says' don't you love to get under there and just dip right in with the rest of them amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated pray the Lord will just help us this morning we want to just continue to look at this a point in this journey here within Ruth of the importance of feeding and fellowship and as I mentioned to you here last week to think of how that Ruth herself must have felt when here she is invited to eat at the table there with Boaz and the rest of the Reapers now Boaz really uh Ruth does not understand uh the magnitude of the situation she doesn't even she doesn't understand what's going on that's why brother Bram could say in things that are to be he says when you staggered to the altar in that mission that night he said you had no idea exactly what was taking place but it was God beginning to deal with your heart and then God God would lead you on from there and it becomes more real it's just like with every step you take with God you're always able to look back and see God's grace that has brought you to that place of submission but also to see in much of a greater measure the value of that decision or the value of the word coming in our lives Ruth and herself would this would be attributed very much in ways like that of a person who would come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their lord and savior they would repent of their sins what a glorious reality that is I I remember when those burdens were lifted when there was a remitting of past sins and yet within it you know you can look at the word as Ruth herself is seeing this and my what a what a what a blessing this is that that I'm being that I'm being invited this way but she doesn't realize and doesn't know who this is she doesn't really see the magnitude of real of what it is as a Redeemer now many times this terminology is used very seemingly almost interchangeably and there's a part of it that is but it's it's used that way so much among the rest of the Christian World they'll use S salvation they'll use Redemption as almost interchangeable terms but yet it's not exactly interchangeable terms Redemption simply means to bring back what always belonged to that original owner and that's what Redemption is all about so we we understand that in order for that that Redemption it's more than just that moment at the altar it's more than just as we repent it's more than that but full Redemption full reconciliation is the same way that it was when the Bible says God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself it's where deity itself the Holy Ghost comes on the inside of an individual and then they begin to experience the real effects of redemption that begins to move in their Life by way of the new birth where the desires of the world is gone and they are tied back into their representation Before the Throne of God and then is there that birth has come it's just like when you've come out of your womb or the womb of your mother just like myself I'm not the same size I was I don't look the same way but in order for that maturing to take place it doesn't happen inside of the womb it's got to be a birth and this is why that when we can see in in the way that the economy of God that we can see it in in that of a of through Galatians and brother Brandon would take countless messages on hear ye him and speaking to you and I in the hour in we're living in the time of the adoption of sons and to realize that the new birth is not the adoption but the new birth is that beginning in our life where we are born of the spirit of adoption that which will bring a maturing in our life as we yield to his molding his leading his Direction in our life and so to realize that you know within it all I I want to stay in a place to where I'm tender I want to God help me and and not not that it's about me but I I realize this old sticky carnal nature that I pack around with me I I know that I I know what it is to have to bring this man in subjection to the word and and get down and pray and and reach out and and die to myself I I know what that's like and I I don't believe I'm talking anything that's foreign to the rest of you but I want to live so I want to live close to him so when the things itself is beyond what my flesh or anything cuz my flesh cannot do it I want to live into such a place to where the spirit of God is able to so move into my life and help me in the moments when it's time for me to die more to Samuel that more of God can come into place because remember the adoption itself that in itself is not just something that's handed to us it was never handed to a son when he came oh oh well if I'm a Son of God and when he gets to a certain point no remember he had to be proven and God will allow situations to develop God will allow things to come our way remember Brother Brad will say it over and over and over through the message he said God will allow things to happen just to test our reaction to how we are going to react when certain things don't go our way or somebody said this this offended us or this didn't happen God will allow that and and what that what that is about that's about you and I dying it ain't about the other person it's not about fixing that other person so they're pleasing me and and not ruffling me no when we sense that ruffling that's just God letting us know son there's some more greenness to be baked out of your life that that that's a place to stay under the presence of God under the revealing of the word and what that will do is that'll take you from just a seed that's coming to birth till like it was prophesied regarding Gideon you will be a cake of Resurrection power that'll roll into the enemy's Camp that's what I want to be don't you brother B says I want to continue to have that greenness break out baked out of my life until I have become the bread on his table is that your desire that he would be a very partaker of the life that he's placed in your in in your life that's what real Thanksgiving remember the song We Sing and we know the scripture I think it's Psalms 100 I will enter into his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart that there is something where as Believers we come there were certain things to where a worshipper would come and actually eat there with the priest and it would be one of those as a Thanksgiving offering and they would eat in Thanksgiving of what of what God had blessed what God had provided for them and that's exactly what God promised to you and I at the end of this Gentile age he said that he would stand he's standing on the outside he's knocking on the door whosoever will open that door I will come in and suck with him what a what a beautiful reality that there is a Thanksgiving when God has really done something in your life then your life itself it is something where you have become a tabernacle that deity is dwelling in and what do you have Feast of Tabernacles you have God dwelling in temporary booths you have a feast going on on the inside in your life there is a Thanksgiving and and you're thankful to the Lord for everything that's taking place in your life that you see him doing that's something to really Rejoice about is't it amen now when I think of this with Ruth you know there's no doubt about it how she must have felt to when you know all of this the invitation was given and to know that it was not anything of her merits and there's no doubt that maybe something would have touched her heart to say oh I wonder if there's something else that that I could do is there something something more that I could do that would be natural you and I would have that same thing I remember when I first started to serve the Lord and some of the rest of you can relate to that too I remember when God be to deal with my heart in sanctification and how you know it set your mind in order for thinking on Holiness and and you're wanting to be it's just like it's almost like a hyper sensitivity to want to be right and you're asking is you know you think this sideburns all right you think this and there's just certain things about it because it's just so moving in your heart you don't want anything like that of the world what is that that's the spirit of God moving Upon Our Hearts setting our mind in order for Holiness and you know what that never leaves you as a Believer because then it moves the same spirit of God that moves upon your heart in that way then it moves to set down to where the very desires that was there that you're looking at and saying oh I I shouldn't do this because the word says this and you're you're honoring it you you you it's a loving to the Lord but it's not to the depth of love that God desires to do by the baptism of the Holy GH goes but it is a start and you're giving yourself to the Lord but eventually the things that you found yourself saying we I I I I can't do this and and and you know this shouldn't be done eventually it moves to such a higher level and really what it is is you've been raised into your rightful position and you're not just looking at this world down here but you're actually looking down on it because Christ himself has raised you above the love of the world and the things of the world I'm telling you friends the things that we can look at in the word of God we can see very clearly if the love of the world is still there in our hearts we've not yet arrived but let me encourage you keep pressing because the same God that has brought you this far will see you the rest of the way huah hallelujah hallelujah we're on a journey we're on a mission we're not leaving H behind are you hearing me yes sir so we understand that because even within our lives there's a there's a continuing on and a moving in the purpose of God and she was she was you know the spirit of God was drawing her and she was yielding and well you know as you begin to see uh with this scripture that we read here at meal time he had he spoke to her Come Thou hither now remember that moaz was not want to send down a delegation to Ruth and say Ruth it's meal time remember what Boaz said you you need to come on down we are going to carry you down there you don't just just get on this you know this place and we've got Bears that'll bear you down there no she was going to have to display her own obedience to the word of God God allows situations to come about in order for Faith to be displayed remember James could say well I have all Faith but James said if your faith doesn't have works then it's dead Faith itself it actually walks and operates not only from our heart but then it puts our feet in motion is that right so God could now Boaz could have done that Boaz could have said Ruth I'll tell you I feel so bad for you and how things have come and you and Naomi and you know but God listen friends when God deals with our life he doesn't come with a pity party are you hearing me now I know in this age it's almost like in this age it's almost like it's an age of pity me but that's a spirit that's not you that's a spirit of this age that's a spirit of entitlement are you hearing me what an amazing grace of God that God's going to take a people in Rapture Hallelujah because why not because I'm entitled but because I've been elected by the grace of God and God has moved upon my heart and his grace has come to you and I and give us Grace to override our own Rebellion that will be simply the grace of God Abraham did not provide that Ram up there God provided that Ram God let him go clear to the last moment did God not know what was in Abraham's heart did he not know he knew it but the Bible says in verse one of Genesis 22 then the Lord did tempt or aay Abraham the word a say is like when they drill down deep in the Earth for four samples and they bring it out and you can see the different layers and God knew it was laying there the whole time but God wanted to show in the end time the display that would be made Not only was that a reflection of Calvary but it also was a reflection of what God would do in the end time because what was offered up in Genesis 15 it came into manifestation again in Genesis 22 so the same Ram that has brought your salvation has brought your deliverance has brought you has brought everything that same Ram will provide a change of this Mortal body from one dimension into the next Dimension the same almighty God God speaking of an end time worken but through obedience God could have let Abraham Abraham I know I know no you don't have to go through all this can you imagine what he went through what he felt and here brother Braham dramatized that of how he wouldn't even let the alarm clock he wasn't going to hit the snooze button that morning because he didn't want to wake Sarah up he slipped on out and then when he got to that place to where that knife was pulled back ready and the angel of the Lord stopped him that's in the scripture God let him come clear to that very Place why to display that faith that says I'm going to take God at his word I don't know how it's going to work I don't know how God has not showed me this is how it's going to take place but I trust God completely and that's exactly where God calls the believer to in this hour when we can come to a place to where I don't have to know then what's going to happen next and happen next and happen next but to trust him that he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I trust him and I take him at his word he said he would heal me when I'm sick in my body how it's going to be that's not my business to figure it out my business is to take him at his word how is God going to sa my loved ones that's not my business to figure that out it's my business to take him at his wordl oh my and Me time Ruth come hither God is allowing even throughout all this chapter as if God gives us Grace to look at in coming Services you'll see God is allowing her character God allowing things to be tested even as if we go into Ruth chapter 3 God is allowing things to be displayed just like when God sent this message to you and I in this hour and to think how when God would send this message God would send a prophet with a word and knowing that it would be rejected it would be rejected they were not rejecting necessarily brother brandham they were rejecting the word they were rejecting the spirit of God that's the same thing Steven charged them with there that day when they got ready to Stone him he called them religious men he said but you do always resist the Holy Ghost even as your fathers I tell you friends that's why it's got to be more than just knowing the letter knowing the written word you've got to know the person of Jesus Christ this message is not about books and tapes and pictures this message is about Jesus Christ Living in your life that's the real gospel that's why the prophet could through a Litany of quotes say that he said the Bible itself is not altogether the gospel because the gospel is the Living Word of God this word was meant to live and it takes the same spirit of God who gave it to breathe upon that word it's like the valley of dry bones but come hither Ruth come hither now I would say that there probably was times that Ruth because it went on for days maybe the first time after this is spoken to man the first time she was like man man my goodness what favor Lord you given me but I wonder as the days went on aches from gleaning because Boaz didn't come and glean for her he wasn't going to he wasn't Boaz was not going to maintain her personal walk for her she was going to have to do that so even with this right here I wonder if there were times that where Ruth said man I don't feel like it I'm just I'm just going to take a break right here I'm I'll sit right here now you know I'm preaching down where we're at because we still walk in this flesh let me just tell you you could look around this room right here you could pick out veterans and everything else that's been serving the lord different ones that let me tell you something right now if I asked you to write on a piece of paper those that you could count on to be here every service would you be on that list would you be oh don't look at me straight like that I'm asking you the question we we look so many times on other things but what I'm trying to get you to see is friends it's not about attendance just coming physically but I'm trying to get you to see what do you think the battles is even for those who come here on a service after service basis some of them satting right here and got tests later on that night some people sitting here they got pressures going on the job they got illnesses in their body they have things going we don't come to the house of God because it's convenient and if feels good and it's the easy thing to do there are religions of convenience some of them even you only got to hit a button now streaming streaming is a wonderful thing but it will never take the place of fulfilling Hebrews 10 right never do I believe yeah I know there's there's situations even sometimes of individuals that stream here but but listen You'll never ever you can ask any that I would find out about you could ask them if I don't encourage them to get with a fellowship of Believers that's true it's important my brother and sister I understand sometimes there can be circumstances and things that's come about but let me tell you something it's more than just about us feeding on the word of God is not just about you and you alone you have your own personal walk with God but God has called us to come and set together as a flock a flock that he has purchased with his own blood Hallelujah so yeah brother Samy do well I mean know have streaming do I believe it yeah I believe in streaming but I don't believe in streaming takes the place of having a local church that you assemble with I couldn't and be a Bible believer that's right I couldn't I couldn't do that and be a message believer that's so good I I to me my desire is listen my desire is not I don't care whether I'm the one standing here preaching or not I love to come together with God's children I love to come together when I'm sitting sometimes maybe in another meeting and I've got one or two services but I love to set there in glean from the ministry and the rest of the body that is there the spirit of God do you realize that the spirit of God while we're here is not just a one-way track he is moving throughout this assembly let me tell you something what will determine if he moves on you is your attitude whether or not what kind of attitude you have it'll just skip right over and it'll keep moving but you know what whether I'm in need or not somebody else is in need God help me to be sensitive that the spirit of God will have a conduit to flow through me to the next for what so that a chain of faith can be built what should I do Ruth come at me time and this is what I want you to do eat of the bread the bread is what staff of life I want you to eat of it I don't want you to tell me how beautiful it is I don't want you to tell me oh this is a beautiful table my boy how wonderful you all have done this my my the setup oh it's just oh it's breathtaking this breath it looks so scrumptious and so delicious my the you know the steam rolling off oh in that no God didn't call us together to talk about the message are you hearing me sometimes friends listen this is where it becomes very very crucial to our lives sometimes there's things listen I think it ought to be when we leave the house of God there's things that God has spoken so personally to each and every one of us in a certain degree but listen friends don't just get caught up in the moment don't get caught up in Emotion but you make sure that you're feeding from God and there's things being taken down into your soul not just wow that that was a great service why was it a great service why why was it a great service well because of this because of that no no it's got to be a great service because you had a meeting with God wonderful things I love to see God deal with lives work with lives bring conviction I love to see God filled with the spirit of God but every service it's about a Divine appointment between you and God and with the rest of the body remember the sons of God were to come and present thems three times out of the Year and that three times out of the year in the feast it would represent that of Son of God Son of Man son of David in every dispensation in every Church Age The Sons and Daughters of God have been assembled by the voice of almighty God this is why the scripture said he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you've not been assembled by man amen you've been assembled because you have been blessed and ordained and chosen to hear the voice of the just one you've been ordained hallu Hallelujah and I want you to dip dip your morsel in the vinegar now I don't know about you now if this offends you this ain't nothing spiritual on this part that I'm going to say but if it offends you you forgive me but I don't like sharing salsa bowls when I go to Mexican restaurants oh no you get your own why cuz I've seen double Dippers I I told you it ain't nothing spiritual but you see there is certain times and certain things that we are we are coming together this was not where Boaz had individual bowls handed out here so you can just be to yourself here so you can just be to yourself but to dip the bread Hallelujah as you reach break it off and dip it there in that soof man I can almost taste that herbs and stuff now Lord have mercy I'm thinking of certain restaurants writing Lord help me and you break that off and you dip it in there and you just try to get them herbs off of there onto that olive oil that's there and that vinegar and that in there my you eat that see you're you're you're eating off it's together it's Community Bowl it's a time when we're coming together to Feast on the word of God I want you to think of this the scripture tells us in Hebrews chapter 10 remember brother B would admonish us that when a person has first given their life to to the Lord I read you many quotes on that last week of even when a life has has come to the Lord find a good church home but he wasn't just saying find a place that's called a church he said find a good Full Gospel Church that'll lead you on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that believes in the spirit of God coming in and doing a work that believes in the Full Gospel pray over that brother R would tell us later in choosing of a bride pray over that church and so we notice that within this uh you know let me just say it like this I I really don't think in many times there's things where people do pray I think sometimes we just go by our feelings oh I just feel this and I feel that and that's why you have to look and say oh where where are you at now where are you at now oh oh you're oh you're over here oh that's where you are I remember my mom one time she didn't mean it I'm going to tell on her she didn't mean it but you know uh this there was a you know a noted individual that you know and that you never knew where she was going to be I mean she be at this church for a while and this church for a while and this church for a while listen friends I know sometimes there are certain circumstances let me just tell you what I got confidence in and what my prayer is is God let every child of God cuz I know I'm praying according to the will of God that they'll find their position in the body are you hearing me but you know she I walked up to the person she said and you know he didn't walk up to her that person came Oh Sister brownie so good to see you God bless you and it came out of my mom's mou so so where you what what church you at now and my mom said I wish I could have grabbed it and put it back in cuz my mom's not that kind of a person I'm not bragging her up she just my mom if there's anybody that can be ever so political in the way that they can strategically say things she's very very very very astute at that but after she said that she said I wish I could have grabbed those words she said I thought my Lord but you see that's what it was what was it it was the testimony that had already been lived out now you realize why God brings us together because we're going to rub one another right let me tell you what a Shepherd is for a Shepherd is not just for feeding the flock although you're not feeding off of me you're feeding off of him a Shepherd is to be in tune with god brother Ram said because he's feeding in the shepherd's place he should never leave that word but feed the sheep food what's sheep food sheep food is that food that is in season where the Dew has fallen and those particular plants have come up along those hillsides of Judea it is where the nutrients of the word is need is there for to change you and I from Glory unto glory in that moment God knows just what we need like I told you last week in Psalms 23 I listen this is just me I I think I can be free like this when brother Ram said we always used to think you know that heaven was someplace we were floating around you know on clouds and harps and everything else he said but since the opening of The Seven Seals we have found out that's not how it is at all it's not the ending here it's just that here we stay from here over there well that's the same way it was for me with Psalms 23 when it speaks of he leadth me in G Green Pastures you just think that my goodness because you think of the richness of the word you think of my there's nothing lacking with the word of God that's true that's true there is absolutely nothing lacking with the word of God but remember the Bible said there would come a famine in the last days in a famine not for bread and water but for the hearing of the word of God and the prophet would lay that in and step around in spiritual food and do season and say that's the spiritual drought that's on right now notice where the famine was at in the hearing of the word of God not only is the word to be heard but God give us Grace to hear what he's saying to usall are you hearing me so it's not just leading around and you know here we are like sheeps you know when we walk our bellies just rolling around walk from this pasture boy I'll tell you there's so much grass in here my good I'll just lay down no that that's not what Psalms 23 is but when you Zone in on it and look at it as it is David would speak of it there's certain trails that are LED around those Mountain sides as they're leading them up into that table land but that table land like I told you last week is a place it's going to require a journey to get there but the Shepherd has gone before to clear out the obstacles out of the streams but he's not going to take away the hardness of sometimes a foot slips and and sometimes you hear a a lion roar sometimes you he's not going to take that away he's there to go with you all the way Amen in other words he's got a place prepared to take us to is that right and he's also provided like he said behold I've sent my angel to keep thee in the way and bring thee into the place that I prepared for thee God's God bringing us to that place but we realize a lot of this right here if it was like that can you imagine how that would be I mean here you are going from pasture to pasture and it's just nothing but lush green grass we would be so lazy more than we are now y that's good we would just be laying down and eating a little bit and burping and everything that that's not how it is you say hi brother samel where do you get that in scripture the Bible said ask and it shall be given to you knock and it shall be open seek and you shall find those Prin Les are always all the way through the word of God that's why God when he made a promise to restore Israel in Jeremiah 29 he said when you will begin to seek me with all your heart then I will be found of you how do you find god with a fully surrendered heart that's how you find God so God has has it set up that way that it's not just going to be me sitting here and looking around and saying hm M that looks awful good oh it's Prime too it two days so I I don't have to go out don't have to go out he'll just they'll drop it at my doorstep and Lord if you give me Grace to walk to the front door to open it I will try to put forth and exert there's enough energy sometimes I know there's certain blessings that certain things within that but you understand what I'm saying God's not doing that to us spiritually friend you with me you see sometimes the things like that that we look at and think oh that don't have no effect on me that don't you realize how it can get to such a place we're used to things we don't have to even go out to the store anymore it's things just dropped right in our lap and if it's not dropped in our lap well I went to service and my it didn't seem like the last service maybe God wants you to pray a little bit more and take those things and say God what you spoke to My Heart Lord Make It Real in my life but sometimes we want Prime drop as I told you last week and if God lets me tear terries and allows me to bring it I'll show you God never intended every single service to be a camp meeting service we need camp meetings we need Revival I've got quotes laying in front of me here we need them but God never intended us to live on Mountain Top Mountain Top Mountain Top Mountain Top Mountain Top and listen friends I'm afraid sometimes that that's too many are leaving on mountaintop experiences waiting for the next fix waiting for the next day when God really wants wants to establish his church when God sends a move of God when a Revival comes it's to do a work that'll keep you in the valley that you live in the valley like you live on the mountain but once again we're living in an age of just drop the package right here let me see who makes this revival yeah I'll take that one right there yeah we'll drop it from right here brother BR that's why he could say in the church ages he said I'm afraid he said too many have not recognized the effect of this last day Spirit where people would begin to get cold let down on the things of God because somehow we can get in our mind this comfort of well I'm in the message but let me just tell you the prophet said when you say you've got the Holy Ghost every gun out of hell is trained on you right he's not training it on on The ecumenical World sure there's certain things that there different ones could be experienced or one more but listen you know where Satan's fighting at same way he's fighting Israel like he's doing he'd like to wipe Israel off the map because he knows he cannot destroy God's word but Israel can't get her visitation until the bride has been taken home to Glory so where is Satan fighting the hardest psalms 27 the enemy who who came against me to consumed me stumbled yay stumbled and he fell Satan is against the revealed work of almighty god listen don't take it personal when you have well my boss said this or my so and so said that don't take it personal they can't help that there a spirit that's upon them but you need to recognize and be sure there's a different Spirit on the inside of you and it's not because of something that I've done but it's something that you can realize there's something deeper going on here a spiritual warfare listen brother Bram never did one thing to that maniac to caus that maniac to come up there you with me come me bringing down in our terms boots and leather brother brand wasn't showing up to work late brother brand was sitting around on a job brother BR W walking around from machine to sheine and doing everything else and you know talk to this and talk to that talk to this and all of a sudden the bus boss comes up and says we're going to have to discipline you glory to God I'm suffering for the gospel no you're not suffering for the gospel you're suffering because you've not submitted yourselves to the ordinance of men that is so good are you hearing me that's part of the fear of the Lord right that's part of all those things sometimes we wonder where why in the blessings of God why I'm this oh I'm being persecuted and it really has nothing to do with anything else but our own actions woo how did we get here if y'all seen where I'm at right here you know I ain't moved at all hardly really I ain't he moved but God knows God knows brother Bram did not do that that's why we check our own lives we check our own lives oh I tell you I would never have yelled at that boss I would never have done that but if you know I just got under his Spirit Well you still got to repent if you did something was wrong don't be blaming it on somebody else repent of it oh well if I my mom said you know I got under that influence don't you have a greater power on the inside of you don't there something on the inside that'll bring conviction and say though I might have been around in a wrong influence maybe you're standing around with a group of people and you joined in with things about the boss or with others you can't step back and say well that was just those guys and I got under their Spirit you've got to take responsibility for your own life and your own walk with almighty God you see what happened if you keep blaming other people it'll continue like it has all the way down through your life where you're looking for somebody else to blame what's going on Lord have mercy y'all probably be glad that I'm taking off aren't you don't worry we'll sail back verse 23 of Hebrews 10 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised now notice let us hold fast he's faithful but let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering I have believed God has given me Grace to believe let us hold fast the profession of our faith now you know this as Bible readers you can go through this of the New Testament you'll find it over even in the seven Church ages God at different times will talk about how they have received his faith it'll talk about how God has gifted a man a Measure of Faith is that right then you'll find where it also God will come back around and brother Bram say notice here in this verse to the church age he's not talking about his faith now he's talking about their faith thou Hast been faithful thou has been faithful he's not faithful to forget thy labor of love that's well you say well how would that come about it's got to be his faith well his faith moving upon our life and moving in our life it causes us should our desire should be Lord help me to yield to what is the invisible becomes visible right it it it becomes visible through our lives and you know what he who gave us the strength gave us the grace turns around at the end and rewards us for doing what for simply submitting and yielding and saying here Lord I'll be a billboard for you right I I I'll be an example for you I'll be like a screen for you to display and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works now there might be some of the good provokers but you got to be provoking on the right thing that word provoke means to incite in love that doesn't mean you know where the the minister or others around us sometimes are sitting around and you know they're just you know it's like those bubbles they have out nowaday or they've had them out since I before I was little you pull out the stick you know and you get them all over he a little boor a little girl and you know finally you get so bored with blowing out through this right here you end up you want a bigger one and and you go on and on but you realize that with in these very things here that sometimes where God will operate and move these things to incite things is not just God moving and just blowing upon us but sometimes God's got to correct us he's got to speak to us and let us know hey hey hey hey hey I'm your father I I'm I'm the king you're my son remember like the remember like the slave that was in the field asked him what is it that you do for this guy I see him conduct himself in such a different manner what is it you got you give him a Temperpedic mattress nope nope he sleeps on the same makeb believe mattress that has Springs and everything else as everybody else do you give him a better meal nope he eats in the mess hall with everybody else oh do you give him preferential treatment in line nope he he does it all the time matter of fact there's times where I've seen him lay down his tray and clean up a mess on the floor and keep on with his tray and keep on going oh boy good what is it that you do different oh no it's not what I do it's what he's realized it's what he's recognized so you see what he's doing this young man is not about him no it's about who his father is so good and because he knows who his father is though his father is separated from him from Seas he is reflecting where his father is seated he is reflecting it down here in a bed of timej he's reflecting through his life that is so good now watch how this States here let us consider that means think of one another I realize friends we're living in a time and and please understand me we're living in a time right now we're doing good to remember when our bills are due am I the only one in here you just go over sometime s you look at things and thank God for online bill pay I mean it I mean it you know it it don't it sa cut down some times I can remember when I would sit down just for an hour making sure the PS and q's and everything else and making things out you know putting the stamps on and everything else but it still takes time and sometimes you know we get to a place and we're trying to do this and you know they here they set up Auto reminders I wonder every time when they do those things set up Auto reminders I remember I wonder if that ain't just reported to the labor agency you can request five more more minutes of their time yeah that's good come on we're living in a time where where like like that of pharaoh where the children of Israel are being asked to make bricks without straw don't take it personal it means your deliverance is near hallah it's not going to get easier it's going to get harder that's right you're going to have to press harder than you've ever pressed beforeall Hallelujah it's not going to get easier to come to the house of God listen many times are easier to read easier to pray easier to get in the message oh it'll get easier one day to really get in there with God it's not going to get easier there's no better time than right now today is the day of salvation here we're standing as Isaiah said and Paul identified on whom the ends of the world have come I'm telling you we're at the end I tell you the only reason that all those things has not turned loose yet is because there's still a bride member that has not come into position but while we're waiting on that one to come into position while we're waiting on them to to be sealed and come to adoption yes that's so good are you hearing me while we're waiting on seal to come to adoption in the meantime I'm here this is still going on then I need to keep growing there's more there's more of God for me there's more of God I want more of God I don't want more of this world I want more of God oh my my my my my my notice not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is now they had this evidently in Paul's day too right I like how John wack life he he writes a lot about these things so you've had it down Through the Ages so it's not something that is just all of a sudden in this age that's come about but you realize it's been all the way down through the times that even this admonition not forsaking which this word forsaking means to abandon desert leave in Straits leave helpless to totally abandoned utterly forsaken now let's just say we were getting ready to have let's just say we're getting ready to have a landscaping time out here and everybody has been invited and here we are my you some of you might say brother Samy that's your thing but let's say here we are because we we we we we need to Green this up we need to it it it we we need to get some Shrubbery we need to get some things Hey listen the Tabernacle in the wilderness didn't look like no shabby little thing come on now Solomon's Temple want no shabby little thing you you you can't put that on me that's right because it's a scripture I believe God deserves our best CU he gave us his best or brother Samuel shrubs and all those things don't make a difference I'm not going to go there but let's just let me get back to my example let's say that we've all been exi invited here to do some landscaping and we're all going to come that's what that's what we're going to come together for and one of a sudden if let's say brother Joey you look at it and say they got enough Brothers there to do that they don't need me there well maybe you're not going to do the shoveling sister Rachel says they got other people there can make lemonade and run it to the brothers they don't need me then brother Dave Crest says well you know I I don't have the strength like I used to have they they won't need me they I mean what what what could I do maybe brother Dave's the one to sat in the lawn chair and say keep digging brother Samuel move it over this way just a little bit more that's so good but what if one by one it just starts off oh they don't oh they don't oh they don't pretty soon it might be down to just a couple man crew right you know why they don't need me we fail to recognize we're a part heart of a body think of in your home in your home what if your kids what if your husband whoever pays the bills what if they decided you know what this really a't important I just this month I don't feel like it we're getting down to Ground Zero aren't we but this I'm I'm reading to you the scripture you see that forsaking is about a Carefree not caring attitude stay with me here and don't don't turn off on me sometimes sometimes the reason those things happen and if you will allow the spirit of God to minister to you it's because we get ourselves tied up with so much of the world to where we're so tied down to where we can set in church but we can't even enter in let me tell you something some of you how God has delivered you from cigarettes and smoking and all other sorts of things but God also wants to deliver you from things traps things that maybe you've run to when you got a little down and you run some people run to there's so many different V various things that people will run to and sometimes it isn't that those things are sin but then it just starts to take over their life and remember Satan comes in innocently white horse Rider right just riding real slow real innocent you don't have no power he's just riding innocent he can only ride as far as you let him ride but remember James says no man no man is tempted other than by whatever desire is there and when that comes forth in the F full fruition you read that in the Book of James that's the four horse riders right there the progression that's right of sin because Satan wants to so entwine and entangle our lives this is why that quote I referred to you last week and let me just give me Grace to just tie this point up this is why when brother Brandon makes a statement I want you to understand this this is one point where you need to be able to stand right now there should not be a quote that could be read right here or a scripture that would cause you to draw back amen that is so good let me tell you there's some strong language the Bible is filled with strong language you know why that is it's to break veils it's to break veils the reason sometimes where where we can get into a fix and people can set in a certain way and getting a certain way it's because of a veil Spirit Veil and it has to be broken and it takes the spirit of God to break it but this is why brother Bram could say he said now listen he said to missw workk he said you can get by with that he said maybe to miss a day or two he said but don't miss going to the house of God now why is he saying that listen I I don't don't be pulling up your toes and your oh man we're going to talking about if you just think it's Church attendance you're missing it you're that I'm I'm not I'm not even talking that that's not what it is it's deeper than that we come here to feed on the things of God we come here that he might sh shepher us and direct us it don't stop when the benediction prayer is made you keep feeding in that Hillside cuz there's places he brings us to it stings in our life it'll take a week's worth of dying Hallelujah that's true it'll take a week's worth of it'll sting but you know what if you no don't look around just feed on where he's brought you if you feed on where he's brought you it's got power in it to give you virtue to overcome the things in your life that you're battling with that you're struggling with if it's unforgiveness whatever there is power in the word brother Samuel I go to the bookstore why waste your money God has sent an open book to you and [Music] I but in order to get that open book you have to go and take it it ain't going to be delivered to you go to the angel that standed on the land and see and take take now walk up and say may I please have it take it if you want it take it the promised land is before you take it if you want Deliverance take it if you want the Holy Ghost take it if you want healing take it these are the Redemptive blessings of the Lord that belong in the household of God to the sheep of the living Goden it's the value that's why brother Brandon when he had a quote I referred to when he talked about missing a day word listen listen listen if you don't take this in the right way you might you may not you may not see you may not see you might think oh well listen what you can't disagree with is the word of God you can't disagree with that you can't disagree with that quote now you can let Satan try to get in your mind well that was just Brother Sam if I'm reading you the word of God if I gave you $100 or somebody else gave you $100 don't you tell me you turn it down this is why the prophet said don't you pay any attention to the messenger you listen to his message are you hearing me thank God for his grace to Deliver Us from all this favoritism I got to have my favorite I got to have my favorite preacher got to have my favorite song got to have my favorite this we might like certain ones there might be certain things we're inclined to but we want him to be our favorite if there's one I want to hear from it's him it might be from a brother who stands right here don't sweat a bit he may not even move there may not be any inflection in his voice but you can hear the spirit of God speaking through him why cuz God has all sorts in the body cuz we need all sorts so I I say that I say that reading and that that part of that quote for this manner don't don't don't take it don't don't be offended with it I'm not trying to share a code I'm just trying to tell you how to approach that and say Lord there's things that I want I need to see what you've said through your messenger what you've said in your word there's a reason it's being said what's the value show me the value you know there's things right now our boys we're sitting there in the living room and I love it there times and how we're there together and coming there for devotion and we're sitting around and then other times when it's just they come and sit around and and then they'll start talking and then you just start hearing certain things you hear them start talking about certain things that they've heard you've worked with them you have certain projections you've put before them and you know just trying to drop little things and and things that they would be saying along the way I'll tell you to me when they come around and it isn't listen listen listen it isn't about me feeling like I was ride all along I tell you what my heart rejoices is I say God thank you that they're getting it yes because you know why I've told I've told him I've told many I said you know what you're further advanced than where I was at your age you are you're you're further Advanced there's certain things of where God in his grace not not not not because of me but that's where it met my heart listen listen of things that he might have been contested certain things I don't know about that Dad I don't know about that Dad now I'm not going to let all the family secrets now but I'm just going to tell you we're a real family like we're a real family God has a real family sorry to say we're not born like the prophet says and you must be born again 1961 he said you're not born born again he said one night and then a fully matured Son of God the next night brother B I'll tell you what he called that nonsense you grow into maturity and sometimes you're growing you're learning we learn through our lessons we learn through our mistakes it gets through certain phases of life when you can present things and say it's your decision no your decision but you need might look at it this way see it gets to that point now I never told them at 5 years old it's your decision Daddy's presenting it before you no this is the way it is then it gets to a certain spot it's just like I think brother John Fon and what he told brother brother Isaac and this how I felt if you don't have these same convictions you can borrow mine cuz while you live in my house you're going to have these convictions because I am I am the Holy Ghost to you until you get old enough to receive it and I I've got a promise where a prophet said if we keep keep you under that of the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost then God will step in on the scene he said but you first got those adoles and years sorry I went like a bypass let me get back to the point ain't God good but God come God will bring it right back around and there's things that they start talking about and saying of things Dad I know where you were pretty strong on this and you you wouldn't let this have you wouldn't let us have a phone to this age and you wouldn't all those see let me just tell you something something I I got to go with it as it's coming if you could you could come up as a parent and ask me brother Samuel what time should I give my my my son or daughter a phone and you know what I'm going to tell you pray because I'm going to tell you it's an individual walk you listen God has entrusted you the stewardship of their life that's right and every child is different you didn't blanket like all of a sudden we're 16 years of age we get our driver's license I'm glad some of my friends at 16 didn't get it cuz I had some that did turn 16 I got in the car with them one time never got in the car again crazy they shouldn't have had them you know any video games where you get another lives but my point is as it comes back around and the value that all of a sudden you begin to see and each one of are you are you hearing me now as parents that's why it's important to pray don't say oh you know what oh oh brother Samuel gave so and so he he gave a zachar he he gave so and so he did it at this age you're to have your own walk with God God has put me here as an example that's true but what I'm what I encouraging you listen I'm not your absolute Jesus Christ is your absolute the word of God is your absolute the message of the hour is your absolute all of that it's the word of the Lord it ties Us in that's why listen you can come and I can give I can present questions to you to think up and pray on but you got to make that decision right you have to do that because listen that's where the Prophet said you show your faith is when you make decisions and if you don't have faith then don't make the decision keep waiting on God well they're I don't know why I'm on this track right now well brother Samuel they're pressuring me I've been there get around with the rest of the young people and I I I I feel you know I feel inferior you know they they know this or they know that that won't be the first time in your life that's right this ain't about you baby ain't about you oh man brother Samuel I does God give into everything we want when we want it oh this is why brother BR tell us in the church ages he said if we instantly got our request the very moment we prayed we would become more impatient than we are God's tempering us once again we just went on a bypass but the point and I trust that you've gathered even in this point it's why it's coming down to with these things that the Lord is looking having us to look at this scripture because it's value yes there's things that my dad told me I didn't see it when he told me but I hold it more value there's things like brother Ivon and other ministers at times and where we've just things that's been shared experience wisdom just listen just listen you get under oak trees you listen right I maybe can't relate because I've not been there but I want to hear right you say why why do you want to hear because I'm going to come through that same path and when I come through that path this is what I found is God reminds me you're not an oddball you're not alone amen amen Elijah got to feel in that way Lord I'm no better Lord than my father's right right he felt that way he felt what Jeremiah felt he felt or they you know he felt like or Jeremiah end up feeling what he felt like they felt what what they felt like value sometimes the things that you know how it is right now where your mom or dad or somebody else has told you something and you didn't see the value of it brother Drake when you were going through Plumbing school there's certain things that they instructed you brought in your um wisdom from the you worked in that water treatment didn't you he worked in that water treatment for years but he had to learn the whole thing with the branching of plumbing and all those things like he's seen no dad he's seen a lot of stuff was went but you know what he's had to learn to value with certain things that why certain older veteran plumbers have said boys watch out for this when when you text this right here watch this right here may not have understood it but you get to a certain spot then you realize oh I see the value now I know why you do this check first now I know why see that's as we walk with God we know even as we're known we begin to see the value of the things that we've done that's why the prophet said after you've given your life to the Lord and you've walked on you come back and you can see the value of when God Drew you to the altar so I'll tell you so good as we walk on with God there's things that even when we look at these principles you may not altogether see the full value on it's just you know about being in the house of God oh forsake not to S me together here's here scriptures about coming to church don't I've got more but I don't want you I've told you this last week how I felt on my heart for quite a while with Le this laying before me is don't look at this about coming and filling a Pew look at it and say God help me to see the value help me to see the value right do you love him let's pray Heavenly Father Lord this is something that for every one of our Lives seeing the value lord well obedience Lord is the the greatest thing that you ask for one time lord a man by the name of Saul we see it in other places of scripture we saw a lord where he he got to a place he intruded into another office because of a lack of patience Lord he would have received patience the Bible says POS possess you with patience possess you your souls Saul would have received patience if he would have just kept feeding and drawing from the word of God Samuel would have been there because you keep all of your appointments then we see how that Saul went on and when he was given charge of what to do regarding the amalekites as he began to come back to the camp Samuel could hear the bleeding sheep oxen and he would ask Saul what is that I hear Saul first saluted the prophet of God I have done what the Lord has commanded me to do but yet he really hadn't he thought he had he had done what he thought was best to do and when he was asked the question why why why do I hear this bleeding immediately showing the weakness of man he turned around and he blamed the people the people the people the people Lord Jesus the value of US Gathering Together around the revealed word of the [Music] Lord I don't want to take my own way I realize Lord that this is why many times that when we talk about this important part that the prophet will always bring together through the message and the scriptures as well we come to the house of God to feed on the word of God and fellowship with one another Lord I don't want my way I remember what my way what it led to in my life many scars many scars and Lord You've you gave me Grace Lord just like you've given many Lord God right through this assembly that Lord Jesus where you've drawn us to a place and there was a part in our life Lord to say yes Lord yes Lord if you have me Lord I want to serve you and then Lord how that you would take our lives and work with our lives and move in our hearts to where you would get our lives our hearts your Prophet would say it like this to where you can get that first nature to agree with the word of God then you come in and kill it and raise up raise up that new man quickly you come into that good ground then Lord we've been equipped to subdue our own will cuz we still have it we still have it but we're not under the Dominion of that first birth but Lord there's times like you would take us in some of the examples you gave here this morning no doubt Ruth got weary sometimes she got tired cuz it wasn't just the next day and out of a sudden the next day here it is the end of harvest no there was even a testing time that went clear through Harvest time but she would glean there's no doubt she would get weary tired Lord we understand that there's times when there's physical reasons and ailments and things Lord sometimes there's situations that come our way where we're not able to be gathered together oh how it just causes us to long for those times Lord but help us Lord those of us that maybe Lord would be standing Lord in good health as of now have our strength have the ability help us Lord God in seeing the value of coming to the house of God it's more than these four walls it's more than the pews it's more than the preacher it's more than the ministering it's more than being able to read out of the Bible and know the next verse that comes next or to finish a quote but lord it's being able as a lamb as a sheep to be led by the feeding of the word cuz you you know what we need Lord in our lives Lord I believe God throughout this congregation there's others that would join with me I don't want to see more of Samuel they could put their own name in it I want to see more of Jesus I want to see more of you [Music] Lord so Lord help us to recognize the more that we'll give into our own will [Music] the more of us will be shown but the more that we can surrender to the will of God then the more God will display himself in and through our lives Lord even when it comes to things that maybe under the sound of my voice things that have been struggling areas Lord that might seem ever so difficult how could this ever be taken out of my life or maybe it's a sense Lord of security to feel a certain way to be looked upon a certain way but Lord God I I pray right now would you just move to that heart and let them see the value that you saw in their soul Hallelujah that you were willing to come down and become one of us that you were willing like the scripture said to endure the shame and the suffering and you did it the scripture says you did it for the joy that was set before you because Lord God you could see beyond that moment you did it that we might have joy this moment you did it that there might be Deliverance in the camp of the Living God you did it Lord that salvation might come Lord to hearts and lives you did it Lord that the Holy Ghost Lord could move down lord into lives and hearts Lord Lord and change us Lord from creatures of time creatures of Eternity you did it for the joy that was set before you because that moment was not a joyous moment it was Calvary and that day on Calvary you made a way glory be to God that every son and daughter of God could follow you to be delivered Lord God of that nature Lord God that would dwell in this old pous Lord God you made a way Lord God that we could be free delivered Lord and filled with your presence you made a way Lord that fear might be dismissed from our life you did it for the joy that was set before you no doubt Lord God I believe right there you look down the songwriter said when he was on the cross I was on his mind the last words Lord God that you said before going to Calvary the one request you made you asked for our fellowship granted father that where I am they may be aome Lord God granted Lord this morning Lord maybe right here Lord in this moment a soul a life would see the value of Calvary Lord God has heard it preach Lord God has felt your presence Lord has felt the spirit of God dealing with their life Lord speaking directly to their life as somebody that maybe would seem like is sitting around in a car watching them and taking down notes regarding their life but they real realize Lord God that there's one Lord God that it's not a man or a person who's watching their life it's almighty God that has watched over our life like Ruth that has come back into the field oh God grant it this morning Lord that Lord God Even In This Moment value could be recognized why that God has dealt with my life this way why has God called out maybe the way that I dress or the way that I've acted why has God called out against that not because he's against you but he wants to free you so that you can serve him fully you're not dependent upon what the world thinks do you fit in with the world are you in with the latest fashion friends I tell you in the name of the Lord you don't want to fit in with this world you don't want the Fashions of this world the Bible said the f passion thereof passeth away you want to Bear His Image you want to Bear the image of almighty God and that same one that moved and led the lamb to Calvary he's here this morning he's here to lead you to a full and complete deliverance he's here to lead you and to minister for whatever it is that you have need of that he's dealt with you personally you don't need me to call it out he could call that out but but listen God has dealt so personally with you since the day of Pentecost now God has come back to speak lip to ear to man the same God that led Abraham out of the earth of caldes where he can walk away from a family business the same God is speaking right to your heart this morning and will give you the strength if you'll yield to it the same word will lead you right out of Disobedience it'll lead you right into full victory that same word if you'll yield to it it'll take you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll take you to your healing if you'll yield to it if you yield to it it'll lead you beyond your offense it'll lead you beyond that wall you've built it'll tear it down for you say yes Lord hallelujah oh I say right here in this moment of this service he's here you sense his present it's he's been here but even as he's taken this service to speak to you and our own vow you some of the simple things that we've looked at within the scriptures but remember it's not great big things that we leave undone it's little foxes that spoil the vine in this day and age there is a despising of small things but I tell you God don't need great big things he never has used great big things God uses Little Things things he uses simple things God uses simple obedience obedience is better than [Music] sacrifice oh Hallelujah I wonder here this morning as we just go on in worship here just worship and just allow the spirit of God this is listen friends this is a very important part of the service here it's a time where the Prophet I trust and I say this respectfully I trust you let the tape play all the way out you'll find it over and over on many of the tapes sometimes they had to cut it off because of just it was cut off somebody was taking it but if you can listen to many of the tapes you'll find it it wasn't that brother Ram had a long had to have such a long after service but it was always sensitive to how the spirit of God was dealing with us and he would tell us it's very important for the rain to come and water the seed That's Falling in we want to water it in real real good that's what we want to do you've not you've not taken your time this morning to come here as a show you've not come in here to just well I've done my duty no you you've come here it took Faith to come here I I believe you've come here because you you've wanted something from God I believe God has spoke to our hearts this morning and I believe we can ask him Lord let the value of it let the value of it Lord let that become Lord so in view in My Heart Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh yes Lord may I be like you start from the top change change my heart oh God [Music] make it ever true change my heart oh God hallelujah may I be like you oh hallelujah oh this is a moment for you are the part [Music] I am the oh my Hallelujah mold me and make me this is a while I pray oh change my heart oh God oh my let let that be a request May make it ever true amen Change My Heart Lord change my heart as a man thanketh in his heart so is he change My Heart Lord may I like you for you are the father you are the father I am oh Hallelujah bless the Lord on my soul me and make me this is what I pray oh yes change my heart God hallelujah oh yes Lord make it heav ever [Music] true change my heart oh [Music] God may I be like [Music] you you know as sheep I wonder if we couldn't just stand so I've read and studied over the times just even as I've been going through this portion and going back through and studying and studying on Shepherds and sheep feeding Fellowship sheep it's one of the incredible things how God would liken us to sheep you know sheep is a very social animal it's very dependent animal but a shepherd it's sometimes the way he'll have to come through and not only by the feeding of the flock but as I've read and studied that the shepherd also has to watch out for struggles that can take place in the Sheep sometimes there's a as a as it's wrote and put out there by Shepherds there's a sometimes can be kind of like a hierarchial thing and how things are so kind of placed there and the shepherd is to watch because that can really bring ill effects in the herd now you might look at that and say well brother the Samuel that that shouldn't be but I can show you scripture after scripture of where Paul would admonish every one of the Epistles on how to live our lives not only out there but among one another even things things where Paul would use such words as endeavoring to keep the unity you know what that word endeavoring means being strategic with military Outpost you know what that means when they look at a big map military they say if I make this move right here this is what might happen if if I my we we need go we need to go right in on that and take but if I make this move right here this is what's going to happen so endeavoring are you hearing me now endeavoring is not about something outside endeavoring is about inwardly in us us endeavoring to keep the unity through the bond of peace now you see God won't do that for Ruth he won't do it for Ruth I'll I'll just do it for you no see there's things that God does for us you can't open the Red Sea he'll do that you can't heal your body he does that but then there's so many other things that God entrusts you and I with doing and says I want my faith to be displayed through the lives of my children yes just like he pulled back in the Hebrew children it was all that was all them they were standing on God's word but God allowed that Faith to be displayed so I think of this moment that we're in here the Sheep being even in that manner to where all those things would have to be watched out for I also want to take it in this I wonder if you wouldn't lay your hand upon husband and wife sitting next to one another maybe another brother sister to sister respectfully respectfully please and I want you to pray for that other sheep of God that other name that we believe is on the Lamb's Book of Life I don't know what what they might be going through but remember when we come together to assemble together sometimes there's discouragement and so when we come together it's not just me coming to see this brother or this sister but we should meet Jesus and one another that individual you've got your hand on right now might be going through the hardest time in their life there might be traps and ins snars and entanglement that you just can't say well you need to get out of this no they they need prayer right now they need encouragement there's a way that maybe they can't see their way out of it but God is a god rich in Mercy that in their mind maybe where it looks so I don't know how that's going to be but let's pray no matter what that need is if it's that if it's a trap whatever it is besetting sin whatever the need is you need need the Holy Ghost whatever it is let's believe God for all things Heavenly Father Lord as we have been joined together here this morning we have not been called together father by man but Lord our assembling together Lord has been by you you have led us Lord together Lord under the great canopy of your presence Lord the revealed word of this hour Lord oh God to come under Lord the blood where Lord Jesus we stand Lord where there's no big eyes and little 's Lord but we stand as Sons and Daughters of God Redeemed by the blood of the lamb in need of the mercy and the grace of God lord you see the needs Lord throughout this assembly this morning oh God among Lord the sheeps and Lambs Lord God that are gathered here Lord father you know the needs Lord you know father whether it's despair discouragement Lord Lord maybe ENT trapment Lord entanglement Lord and how the enemy Lord even in the midst of that Lord where Lord's been an entament Lord would like to wear them out in their mind Lord as though they don't belong to you but oh God when that desire on the inside they could not have the desire to be free Lord unless you put that desire in him Lord now I pray heavenly father as that thirst is there Lord and David said Lord that he longed to see the Living God in this dry place like he was in the sanctuary now I pray father that Lord as you have moved Lord in the sanctuary Lord of your presence of your word Lord may you breathe Lord God and move upon those dry places Lord as hearts Lord God are returning Lord and rekindling Lord and realizing the on the inside Lord you placed it there Lord may you breathe Lord God an encouragement Lord God to the discouraged Lord May Lord I pray God The Winds of the Holy Ghost Lord just dispense Lord to every heart Lord bringing every life Lord into a perfect union and harmony with the mind of almighty God that Lord whatever the need might be Lord that everything all sin is confessed and under the blood Lord God to where our hearts Lord do not condemn us Lord and may the Winds of the holy spirit that would bring that change of heart bring that change of mind that would raise that repentance Lord May that same Holy Ghost Lord fill and refill lives Lord I pray God granted Lord Jesus ministering Lord to the need of every one of my brothers and my sisters Lord granted Lord I pray father in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord May the healing virtue Lord move Lord God through the needs Lord oh Father above every disease we place the name of Jesus Christ above every sickness Lord above every mind battle Lord above every depression we place the name of Jesus Christ it's a strong and mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe we love you Lord this morning granted Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of almighty God thank you Father thank you Lord Jesus thank you for your mercies Lord thank you Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord David said he anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over when a Shepherd would anoint that sheep that anointing upon that head was a special ointment and it was placed there to remove parasites you know what parasites do they get on you and want to take from you they want to live on you as a host but the anointing of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the spirit of God the chief Shepherd I couldn't touch you you didn't touch me you touch him and he has placed a upon your heart I don't want these parasites let me tell you something you can't remove the parasites but the quickening power of God the spirit of almighty God you just yield to it and those parasites won't be able to stay there you know why they can't handle Rich thick blood it was like the Mamba when it came it bit brother brandom remember that brother BR said but when it bit he said it couldn't have any effect cuz the blood was too thick that wasn't Brandon blood but that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ in the body of Believers hallelujah oh we're not defeated we know exactly where we're standing greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world you love him amen amen why don't you turn and shake hands with someone amen we have had enough oh no no no no no I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm so glad that I'm a part of the
