tonight in new man it's so good to see you brave it out in this cold weather maybe a brother and sister Hoffman they brought this all the way up from Arkansas we're glad to have you all tonight you're with us good to have each and every one of you we just want to turn our hearts and our attention to the word of the Lord Amen so if we could let's just bow our hearts just ask the Lord to just further move in among us on his word Lord Jesus as we come before you lord as part of a service now Lord you you're such a perfect gentleman you always give us the opportunity to worship you First Lord to sing praises Lord beyond everything of this life and things that more that they went through or go through Lord as we come here and we gather together it's just something about it Lord to be able to get together with believers of life precious faith elixir fire Lord that are coming together Lord as we begin to see Lord we read about in the scriptures where Paul and Silas the Bible says about midnight they begin to sing praises or do we know we don't know if they Sun the Frug was the first song or if it was the second song we don't know even what stanza it was we don't know maybe whether it was ten minutes of singing a minute of saying we don't know but one thing that we do know is that their heart moved to a place Lord where their faith Lord was resting in that word and you came right there where they were gathered and you removed the hindrances Lord God for the purpose that you had called them for and we know that if they had not been there in that Philippians in that jail Lord one of your elected children Oh God they would they would not have heard your word but lord I think of how your prophet would say in this time when that of the Philippian jailer would ask the question concerning his house and your prophet would instruct us he said what Paul said believe that I am God's prophet and representing the Lord Jesus Christ and believe on him and die in my house shall be saved Lord we are aware oh god of this reality and we thank you Lord and we ask the Lord that you would just move in now among us Lord move in Lord by way of your spirit take your word and speak to our hearts Lord you know every situation you know every need and you're the answer Lord we give ourselves to you father the Lord for every request upon every heart Lord you are the satisfier you're the answer we ask it now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of let's turn to Exodus 15 I want to go a little bit further here tonight in this part we've been looking at just try to go a little bit here in the word of the Lord to see how the Lord will take us in verse 22 of Exodus 15 the Bible says so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to Marlin they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Martin and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree and when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proven and said if thou wilt diligently I want you to watch this here and he said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth we want to look here tonight starting to this on the healing power in the word of God amen may God bless you as you're being seated you know when we look here and we read in the scriptures we find here where Israel had come to a place that many of us we come to there's many different ways that trials and tests come to our life there is trials and tests that come sometimes from losing a loved one sometimes there's tests and trials that comes in our lives from things that we maybe are going through where we from things from work and things with family things within situations that would be like that then we also have situations where Peter would describe it as well where tests and trials will come our way where we're called different names or misunderstood or all those things and many of the times that if we're honest real honest about it there's many of the times that we pray within ourselves Lord let this pass let this move from me let this let this go away because there's nothing within the test or trial to our flesh man or even our spirit man that is comfortable or welcoming but yet we realize that these tests and trials they are not accidents but they are predetermined pre-planned moments of God that God has permitted to come our way in order to shape us and to mold us for the purpose that he's working in our life and that he's called us to one thing about it the brother branham would tell us over and over when it comes to tests and trials in the church age book is how that God is not the author of confusion that God is the author of purpose and no wonder Peter would write by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit when a trial would come and he would say think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strim some strange thing has happened and we can be honest here tonight many of us have experienced this like what they experienced coming out of a mighty victory crossing the Red Sea and as soon as they come out of this victory here they are led three days in the wind if from that place of the Red Sea and they're led right to bitter water it would seem like in a place that you know that my if you come out of a victory you've come out of a wonderful set of meetings or a wonderful service or maybe you've had wonderful group of months that are strung together and then all of a sudden you walk upon some bitter waters but remember that the bitter waters when trials and tests come they're not to make us bitter but they're actually come to make us better many times that you know and I know there's people that we know that we work with and whether they're Christians are not but when there's situations sometimes that's come their way sometimes you realize that there is something about them there's not any sweetness at all but there's actually a bitterness you find people that when they have a disagreement with this person or this person and they look at it as though it's that person instead of recognizing that that there is a molding and a shaping and that we all have needs in our lives really as believers when we look at that and there is is something maybe between of this person and that person and to realize that God will permit these things to actually temper our lives and mold us and shape us because this life it's not about our comfort in this life brother Brandon would say like this and the message I know he said we pray for comfort and he says God gives us the best comfort that we can have tests and trials he said that's the greatest comfort that we can have on this side of the river he said because when we get on the other side is when we will actually receive our comfort and our rest truly as a born-again child of God we do have rest and comfort in our soul even when we're looking at a situation and we don't know how that the situation is going to turn out we don't know even when we're praying about many things we don't have unless God would reveal it personally we don't know the outcome or the pathway and how things themselves will come to pass but when we do pray we know that we are praying according to the will of God and we are looking for the Lord to move on the behalf of our need and through it all God will show his love and his care and his power to our lives but the brown would say it like this many times God loves to get us into a place to where he can show his love and his power to us and I want to take this example here tonight on the the healing power in the Word of God and and to look at this and when we reading here in Exodus 15 they come upon a situation and it is a situation they don't know what to do and Moses begins to cry out to God and God shows him a tree a little tree that is present and when Moses had cast that tree into the waters the waters changed from being bitter to actually be coming to a place of refreshing and drinkable it was not something that God did or bypass that of his prophet but here God shows his prophet that in the midst of this situation I have not abandoned you I have not forsaken you as a matter of fact I am right here in the midst of this test or this trial right with you the thing that had to happen it was very much like that of I believe it was Elijah and Gaza remember gaze and was looking at the circumstances that he saw and he thought how in the world are we going to make it out of this situation but Elijah what did he do he asked God opened this young man's eyes that he might see you know Elijah himself there was a lot of things he could have said to Gaza but there was something about it that Elijah had had favor with God to where God Himself would move in a way to open this young man's eyes to where he would be able to see what was there present among them you know brother Graham said Elijah didn't even see those angels he said and Elijah was standing on the Word of God that said the angels of God are encamped around him that fear him and love him I believe that with all my heart but that's the kind of stop and the ruggedness that God brings out in the life of a believer that will grow I see it or whether I feel it God said it and what God said he meant what he said any sup what he said and he's pressing to perform that word and so like that situation brother Graham said God never brought the Angels down he said the angels were always there and and when in we recognize that the same way with the word in this hour it was always here he said God was always here but now he changes the scene of his servant and with Moses he opened Moses eyes to the tree that was there I would say for every one of us whether you're in a trial going through a trial or you're out of one every time we are thankful for the mercy of God to open our eyes that we might see that tree that is standing there in the midst and if we can just move to that place because as a believer when God opens our eyes there is an attraction in the heart of the believer the believer is attracted to Christ and Christ is the word and when that is unfolded in that moment that believer quickly takes a hold of that word and immediately when the word of God is taken brother there is a sweetener that comes into that lot that'll take care of the bitter waters it sweetens it to where that the trial itself that was filled with bitterness you are able to stand as a child of God and rejoice not in the trial but rejoice in the God who is present in the midst of the trial oh my it changes our eyesight from that of just in this natural to be able to live towards those things that are eternal and here within that you know brother Branham would take us here and I tell you within this hour you realize that the scriptures as we are reading the scriptures in this hour we are not reading the scriptures under the inspiration of a man's thought pattern but here is the inspiration of God's thought that is poured out upon the word in this hour brother many people have had the Bible but you know to read the Bible is but to read it and to actually read it under the inspiration of Almighty God brother it opens up a pathway for us to be able to walk in it actually brings the word from print to light to a person it makes it a living reality where you and I can look back into this and see it present for our life and see us in the word that is not the inspiration of them that's the inspiration of God that is coming this generation and it's come for you and I hallelujah for you and I to be able to look but even in the midst generation when the telling apart and we see this falling apart this crumbling and this crumbling but yet in the midst of the inspiration we have found the tree in the midst of this generation that Christ coming into our lives it has brought us sweetening where the world is filled with hatred and that body and trucebreakers it's perilous times but in the midst of this path he is hiding us in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle no one there David can say now will I sing praises of joy why we have found him hallelujah Oh mom don't you love the Lord where the brem said like this and the message Christ
