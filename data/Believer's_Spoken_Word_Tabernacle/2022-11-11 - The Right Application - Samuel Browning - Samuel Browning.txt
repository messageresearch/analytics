just a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord and Maya I'm just so thankful amen for all that the Lord has done and amen just the testimonies coming in and from those that were here and I know that there are no doubt other testimonies that from right here every time when we come together amen there is always something special God is going to do amen amen and you know even in the times that sometimes that we don't feel like things are going on but yet you know what God is a God who works little by little just as much as he comes to cap off of work he cannot cap anything off that's not built up right right so God works little by little every stone everything you know I I really heard something when we were at um the men's meeting that it just it just so spoke to my heart when brother Tim Dodd and he was ministering you've heard it about the infinite God he took a he took a statement uh in dealing with how sometimes he said you know he says we think every service has got to be a boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom he said but consider he said The Rock that smoked Goliath I wonder what size that rock started out as but he said every little rainstorm that came along and every little bit of water it had to get that rock down to the right size so even when things weren't heard or when seen God was getting everything ready to Smite the lion so I think you know when he was ministering that I I thought of the scripture immediately you know says who hath despised the day of small things amen we we are just so thankful amen for the mercy of God and I I'm so thankful for God's grace and what he's done and what he's doing for us and my what a wonderful time that we've had in the presence of the Lord we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord here tonight so appreciate them song service we just know we need we need to hear from him amen so if we could if you'd like to stand with me and I'd like to go into the scripture here and start into Job chapter 13 tonight and maybe as you turn there once you get that and I don't know if they'll if they have it or they do have it to be able to put up and just so appreciate thank you for being patient with us the brothers between services on Sunday the brothers are the brothers worked in order to because that other projector went out the bulb and it's really an issue with the projector we know now and they work to take that one down put that up there and then brother Brian holdren formatted it so it would at least be readable right here so I appreciate that brother so much I mean amen the different Brothers all that were getting up there and changing the not only that but the plate that it attaches to and all that you know we just come in and we enjoy it we just we're thankful the words are there in front of us but my goodness I tell you what I'm so glad for all of those just you know I didn't ask them to do that but they right away they met me at there and said hey we're going to do this between services so we just we say God bless you thank you brother amen all that were on the ladders and doing all that so let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer and then we'll read here in the scriptures Heavenly Father Lord we are just so thankful Lord for this privilege and opportunity that we have to come once again into your presence Lord we're mindful of Our littleness Lord mindful that God that we need you Lord and father just one word from you Lord is more than Lord a multitude of words Lord for it comes from you so we ask that you would help us to be able to step out of the way that Lord those things that you pressed upon our hearts that you Lord that has given the inspiration may come and deliver it Lord in the manner that it's to be delivered and help us Lord to receive it that it would go Lord and minister to the needs that you know that are present in our lives we love you and we thank you Father we give ourselves to you now in this congregation in Jesus name Amen in Job chapter 13 I want to just take care and read a few verses of scripture verse 1 beginning there it says lo mine I hath seen all this and mine ear hath heard and understood it so what job's talking about is everything his friends have been saying that's what he's responding to mine I hath seen all of this my ear hath heard it and understood it what ye know the same do I also I know also I am not inferior unto you surely I would speak to the almighty and I desire to reason with God but ye are forgers of Lies you're all Physicians of no value those are some pretty strong words right old that ye would all together hold your peace and it should be your wisdom hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips now he's speaking to them still will ye speak wickedly for God and talk deceitfully for him will you accept his person in other words will you stand in his place will you contend for God is it good that he should search you out or is one man mocketh another do you so mock him he will surely reprove you if you do secretly accept persons shall not his Excellency make you afraid and his dread fall upon you your remembrances are like unto ashes and your bodies to bodies of clay amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated remember as we're drawing from the thought of passing through the valley of baka we're dealing with that a couple of weeks ago and we know that the Valley's not our destination the valley being the type of tests and trials that we go through within life and every test in every trial is predestinated from the hand of God you've heard it said over and over probably not only by me but others as ministers will be exhorted and reminded that it's one thing for sure we're either in a trial coming out of a trial or heading into one and it comes in many different forms that you know brother Brown would talk about the ash heaps and sometimes the trials that come sometimes there's things that comes to us that maybe we wouldn't regard as a trial or think of it in that way but yet God permits it do you know there's nothing that can come our way unless God first permits it even when David remember when David was mocked and he's going out of the city and remember one rose up from David after the one had spit on David and David said let him alone God told him to do that and how that you'll find that brother Panama picked that up even when he's speaking to brotherly Vale and different ones at the table and how that you know brother Brown writes how brother Vale just quickly said how can you stand to let people do that to you and brother Brown says well brother Lee so you're a little quick on the trigger there and he went back and he took it right back into scripture and you know what I'm grateful for that we we have access more to more than just scripture we have access to the author because if all we had was just access to the scripture the Bible from my understanding is still the number one sold book if that's out there but oh how that we need the author of the book that was the plead that was made even in this hour where brother Brandon remember he was approached and said brother Brandon we're not going to ever understand until we understand the language that it was in and this inaudible says well he says that argument has been going on for years about what language it was in he said but what we really need is the teaching of the Holy Spirit to make it clear and that's what we need in every in every moment of our life and how God continues to bring himself and make himself more real to you and I and I thinking of the of out of the uh Church ages where brother Brandon would speak of how the Sumerian age and if I can just lay this for a background before I give you my title brother Brian was talking about the Sumerian age I remember samurna means bitter and so it was it was a age of bitter trials no trial no trial itself is without bitterness but the difference is we're not talking about bitterness of the person we're talking about bitterness of the situation and so when we see it he says this this condition to Smyrna has to be applied to every age there's no age free from it there's no True Believer free from it this is of god it's the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it and I say we not only need God to teach us as far as even in a service like this but we need God to teach us in the midst of the trial because that's where God even wants to instruct you and I in the midst of the valley is where he'll teach us and where there is things that is taking place in our life God wants to do for us in the Valley now our flesh wants to get out of the valley but there's things that God wants to achieve in the valley that the valley is necessary and if I can't go into all of those details tonight but those things that just and I know this is a subject that's very familiar to us what message and what time uh can you not listen to will you'll come in contact where uh the Holy Spirit would exhort us on tests and trials and things that are coming our way I've sat and I've heard it ministered on in conventions in meetings and other places sometimes how many times we've heard it here but you know God has a way of encouraging you and I and reminding us I'm glad that God just doesn't rest it upon our memory to remember things but God comes along because if that's all it was then God would just say read the Bible after you've already been saved filled with the spirit of God just read the Bible everything's taken care of but God through the foolishness of preaching not only chose to say but God chooses to teach us to remind us to strengthen you and I that and make us aware he cares and he's Mindful and I'm grateful for that I'm grateful for that so when we see this we need him to teach us that truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and is kind brother Brown reads Matthew 5 11 12 and I'm just referring to a quote the brothers don't have this blessed are ye Jesus said when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you I don't know about you but I that second part of verse 12 rejoice and be exceeding glad I need help recognizing that I just be honest I need help with that I I don't think when false accusations come that immediately I go into a praise break I don't almost we go instead of Praise Break we're going to meltdown right defense mode but that why is that that's because that's our outward man but remember the test and trial as Paul wrote is for our outward man to perish God knows how to reduce us that the real us can come forth and that's not up to me to determine that with you or you to me that it's on God's hands and I'm glad that God knows just as much as one can look in maybe in a certain area of the Earth in a in a topographic map and say there's a lot of gold here where there's a lot of coal here or there's a lot of minerals here I'm glad God knows what he already put within us and I'm glad that he's the one not man no one else that's bringing out what he already put within us and I'm grateful for that so I I'm thankful that even how the prophet would go on to say the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved and that never changes that never changes once we have been accepted in the Beloved and in reality that took place before the foundation of the world it's God working here right now and opening our heart moving Upon Us by his inspiration by his life that we will accept what he has already done and so no matter what even in all of failures mistakes thoughts misunderstandings the acceptance in the Beloved never changes even when we've done wrong that doesn't change God's not if I can say this and I hope that maybe it's not politically correct but you get the point God's not an Indian giver are you with me God's not somebody that you got to worry about I don't know if I should borrow this from them or ask about it because I don't know if they tell me they're giving this to me I don't know because they'll show up weeks later and say hey have you got this God's not like that God doesn't give the Holy Ghost and take it back as a matter of fact he lets us know when you're sealed you're sealed to the day of redemption you can grieve it but as far as your acceptance you've already been accepted and that acceptance of the holy spirit is what works in our life to continue to bring us into manifesting our acceptance even when he convicts us and we say I was wrong I need to go make that right Lord forgive me I thought what is that it's that acceptance working in our life by the Holy Spirit to do what declare we have been accepted in the Beloved so our status Before the Throne and in God never changes well I wish we could really preach on that tonight his love is elective brother Brown tells us that he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so I believe right now I'm speaking to people and the bride upon the Earth worldwide is coming to this place right now that there's never been a group of people that could stand upon the Earth and take every word of God and say he said so I believe it but we're in the age of the manifestation of the bride in her fullness we're in the time where where where where the building of God is being is finished is that right and just as the bridegroom could stand there on every word of God so is the bride because it's his life pulsating through us that even though I can't understand it or explain it or feel it I believe it why because he said so that's Abraham's seed it's not because I feel it but because he said so that settles it and he manifested that he did love us for how did he manifest he'd love us because he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass and I would just be very honest and say God help me help me let it just so drop help me to recognize these things that in the midst of it remember Joy This Joy is not like the joy of the world the joy of the world is depending on who won and who lost and this and that and everything it's all up and that's the joy of the world but the joy of the Lord is my strength what Joy are we talking about we're talking about this Joy that's in these temporary Dwelling Places in the Feast of Tabernacles these Earthly Tabernacles there is a joy Jesus said my joy I give to you and no man taketh that from you meaning no circumstance can take that in other words your acceptance your seal your token there's no circumstance no trial no test no matter no false accusation nothing can take that away from you so when everything else is breaking away around you there's a joy from within to say this Valley is not my home I'm just passing through I want to speak here just for a few moments and I know I gave a lot of that to just lay this in and I've just been really as we've been looking at you know appropriate responses and looking at all these things and I just I just been going through here going back through the Book of Job just little by little just chapter by chapter just moving through certain things and the Holy Spirit just began to impress this thought upon my heart the right application the right application how many knows it's important to have the right application now in Exodus 12 let me just give this example first in Exodus 12 21 Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and ye shall take a bunch of hyssa that's common Faith it's just it's taking faith brother Brian says not some super duper Supernatural faith is just common faith I believe it God sent it I'm just going to do it and you shall take a bunch of hyssop and and that is in the basin and none of you shall go out the door of his house unto the morning so when they were to take this this blood and they were to Sprite the disciples and that here of the lentil all those that goes around the door and you'll notice never were they to put the blood on the threshold because you're never to walk over the blood it's always to walk under the blood in everything we do we do it in the name of Jesus Christ we're to move under the blood of Jesus Christ and so he gives the the direction and no matter what what they thought they really didn't have any thought coming the only thing they had to do for deliverance was do what God had spoken in his message through his messenger and that was apply it to the side posts and the lentil and that's what you have to do because when I see the blood then I will pass over you in other words I'm not going to be looking at you I'm going to be looking at the blood and if it's applied correctly I'll never see you all I see is the blood and the blood represents death has already come to this household one on the inside deserves to die but there is one who has taken his place and the blood is applied and God said when I see the blood I will pass over you so the right application provided an escape provided a safety and God said none of you shall go out unto the morning you know why they were speaking of the effect that would come through the real Lamb of God where every desire to even want to go out again is gone the Devils could come and howl at the windows and peck on the door and try to bring all sorts of fear but a real Godly father would direct when the fear arose it would Point them back to the blood oh man I tell you when fear arises or a question arises we are pointing back to the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ because in that blood was the life that met every requirement it is the true atonement that blood speaks for you and I Hallelujah it's a right application that is placed there and there's no desire to go out anymore this is why Jesus could say even to the woman at the well that the father is seeking true worshipers and the true worshipers they will have the right application not only Spirit but they'll have truth also not just truth and no Spirit but they've got the right application of mechanics and Dynamics right and Jesus could go on to say I'm the door and by me if any man enter in so when entering into the Sheepfold you must enter in through and by him and if a man enters in by him he shall be saved Jesus said in John 14 16 I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me so it's showing that the right application is our Escape is our safety and we receive the benefits of that rightful application is that right now think of this caiaphasis down there when the Lord Jesus he was being crucified down there in the temple they were singing the Psalms you know they had the right scriptures yeah but they had the wrong application then who is it that makes the difference because it's more than just having word we've got to have the a player of the word that we might have the right application because catholicisms remember I instead of me reading it but as the Bible says that when they pass by the Lord Jesus on the cross in verse 40 it said that they spoke to him thou destroy us the temple and build us it in three days save thyself if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise the chief priest mocked him with the scribes and Elders they would have come to his rescue but if he would have saved himself he could never have saved others you realize that moment right there was a test for him are you hearing me tonight it wasn't just those bad people shouldn't have been saying those things sometimes we can look at things and think why are they saying this why is so and so saying this God permits it to do what test you and I am you saved others himself he cannot save I referred to that let me go on because I don't want to get caught think of this they missed what was happening and what was taking place the disciples the disciples we looked at this some months ago they didn't know what had taken place yet the word was right there before him Zechariah on and on and on Isaiah on and on and on all these scriptures but what it is they didn't have the application to it they didn't have the understanding but when the time was needed for understanding then God himself gave understanding and the Lord Jesus could come out of the uh of the hedges and so forth and he steps out and he begins to speak to them or not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory what's he doing he's showing them there's the right application to the word because the wrong application caused them to be sad and despondent and discouraged by the ram uses the term bewildered well I guess we'll just go fishing I guess we'll just do this and he wasn't the one and I I guess this and I guess that and I get that's a problem guessing but see Jesus not us Jesus would not leave his church in a guessing stage and you realize when he came on the road to them well let's just go with him a minute when they came on the road they turned and asked him are you a stranger don't you know what's been going on you must not be from around here he was the very one that was with him the whole time but he made as though he was a stranger Their Eyes Were withheld from him yeah because their thought of redemption Redeemer of Israel did not match God's thought but I'm so glad that they're thinking didn't keep him at Bay I'm glad desire our desire as though it's something that we've married and God said wow they really have a desire if there's any desire in you and I at all God put that desire in there Hallelujah so the right application because look Matthew 28 go you therefore into teaching the Nations baptizing them in the name of the father son and of the Holy Spirit right but the right application of it comes over to Acts 2 38. if you want the true results you got to go according to the right application right now we don't need to elaborate on that but it shows that if the right application brings forth the right spiritual results the true spiritual birth and relationship with the Lord Jesus then we need the right application of the word in every situation right we we want to be certain of God let me pick this up when we read for a text job mentions here to his to those that are around him he calls them forgers of Lies you're all physicians in verse 4 of no value job 13 5 owed that you would all together hold your peace now they did that at first for seven days right and it should be your wisdom I can't remember who it was now um I think it was the white moody or something like that or I can't remember who was that said it that you know it'd be better than some than for somebody to thank you to be a fool than you to open your mouth and leave no doubt right right it'd be better than that way but so to notice this job's three thin friends his buddies how many of you heard of times where somebody went in for a surgery and you know they'll Mark you my wife has went in for different procedures and they've um you know marked her where they were going to maybe if it's something for you know with the kidney and those things like that they Mark you right you want to make sure they're not marking the leg right right you want to make sure they're not marking the eye yeah I'm in here for this right but these guys if we can like in it like this these guys were like eye surgeons trying to perform open heart surgery it wasn't the right application stay with me here tonight we're just it's very simple we're just going to work with this the many of their ideas about God are true they're founded in scripture I mean I could we could elaborate all night many of the things they are saying as far as truth about God is true but their application in applying it to this is off are you with me so you know they took many true principles but they applied it wrongly now notice in job 4 1 I'm just going to try to go through some scriptures here here is a life as the Bible says then your life asked the temanite in job 4 1 answered and said if we are saved to commune with thee he will thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking in other words we have been silent long enough we have got some answers behold now here's what they're saying saying to job I think this is quite a testimony they're going to say behold thou Hast instructed many and has strengthened the weak hands thy words have upholden him that was fallen and thou has strengthened the feeble needs but now it has come upon thee and thou famous it toucheth thee and thy trouble I mean they were testifying job when people have been down around you you have went and ministered to them to strengthen them in the time of their adversity yeah but the way that they're applying this is though he should not be in the way that he is right you should not be in the bitterness of your soul meaning filling the bitterness of the situation it should not be you know filling to he's nothing but flesh are you hearing me in nothing but flesh right so here here what a what a testimony the job has been one that's comforted others by the comfort of the Lord number six look at this I want an accusation is not this thy Fear Thy confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways in other words how you are behaving speaks there's a lack in your life because you should be strong during this time [Music] oh my mama we could just spill the whole can of beans but with this let's go on scripture verse 7 remember I pray thee watch this instruction that Eli has remember I pray thee who is being innocent whoever parent whoever this things whoever perish being innocent what's he charging him you're guilty now remember these are his buddies sometimes it's easier to take things from people who are complete strangers but when it becomes our bodies come on now or where were the righteous cut off even as I have seen they that plow iniquity and show wickedness reap the same when you love to go to these guys Church how could you ever hold your head up right you'd be getting blasted with Buckshot every service yeah yeah I know I know but you labor on this just a little bit but notice by the blast of God they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed now there is a great need to apply the word by divine revelation to the given situation we are living in an hour the token think how brother Brandon would take that with the token it's a time of applying he speaks of how that when sickness comes our way apply the token he said if Satan tries to come your way and tempt you apply the token so the token is not just something that we have that's not used it is our weapon are you hearing me it is our weapon against the enemy so to take what God has given us and stand there against every opposition now notice what job is doing he remember they've said a lot of truth there's a lot of true principles now let's read a few scriptures here where you can find job is going right along with it and saying that's truth Joe 9 2. I know it is so of a truth but how shall man be just with God if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand job 12 verse 1 job answered him no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with you but I have understanding as well as you I'm not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these hmm job 13 1 we read for our text Lo might not have seen all this my near hath heard and understood it what you know the same do I all know also I'm not inferior unto you in other words in all this job is not saying job is not telling them what you're saying is not truth but your application is not right I want you to think about this God is not coming to his defense on this sometimes where's this at where's the Blessed God what if what if job was here in the what's in 21st century what if Joe was here Joe get on Facebook I know that's for old people but Instagram Snapchat this and that and Joe get on bless God I'm gonna blast them in the name of Jesus I'm gonna take quotes from the message in scripture I'm going to justify myself all that all that shows is you're the one fighting the battle and as long as you fake the battle God cannot and will not fight it for you is that right as long as we fighting it God said I ain't fighting you're fighting come on we're gonna go through your quotes on this and go through a Litany of scriptures God is not going to come behind you know why because we'll keep trying to do the same things and God will not share his glory with no flesh because if we got it this way one time bless God it'll work again there there might be some things coming along like that and God finally finally gets us get in the situation you realize you know what you ain't gonna work your way ain't gonna work and I ain't gonna bless it hello that's part of our maturing and we're looking for this and land is happening why ain't that happening God said come on we got to come up higher oh I'm glad he don't do that all at once aren't you oh I'm glad man we would we would melt sure as the world think about this because everything that they are are saying and I know we know these things but I just just feel impressed of the Lord and I can't get a couldn't get away from it that as we come back into this part here with job there is they are his friends continue to come at him as though that this is correction in other words these guys can say nothing about all that job has done strengthening people encouraging people this man is being a help to all that's been around him but what they're doing is is they're coming against his character oh that's tough when your character gets get it come on now when a character gets hit remember the Lord Jesus walked with it all the time you know nothing but the product of a drunken Soldier come on now those things did not go away oh brother Samuel he was the son of God and he just he wouldn't know he had to stand right there and minister to needs when there were Pharisees that reasoned in their heart and calling the algebra and everything else but you know what he did not let that take him from his mission he I'm glad he didn't aren't you I'm he didn't spend his time trying to fight and proven I'm glad when he got up on that Easter morning he didn't rise up and say bless God where are the mockers at now I'll go show Herod no he went to those who were believers the resurrection was not for unbelievers the resurrection was for believers [Music] God has sent this message to you of Resurrection it's not a chance it's not by chance God has come to you because you're a believer and he uses Believers to prove his word [Music] was a difference between correction and approving I want you to take those two words correction and approving because like job every one of us often often when things happen we think of the negative let's be honest we do you know why because we're still in the negative so the negative that we think of right away is what am I doing wrong what's going on here and sometimes there are things we are doing wrong right but let me let me just let me say this now correction here's one thing with correction that is very very true correction always comes to us with light it's not Darkness it doesn't close off the way like there's no way out of this that's not God remember even how the spirit of the Lord was bringing it here on um on Sunday evening how the spirit of the Lord is there to Lift Us the Bible says that a just man a just man I mean this this man is standing accepted in the beloved father seven times but he gets back up why because there's a strength on the inside to get back up there's something that goes beyond his own thoughts of his own failings that says get back up again what is it it's the same one that rose up on that Easter morning same one little captivity captive that same power is in The Believer so the difference with correction correction comes with a light it's a light to instruct us that we might turn our feet in the right pathway that's what correction is correction is not God coming and beating up on us and saying you're wrong wrong wrong what what value is that right how could you even repent but you see the reason you can repent is because real correction comes with the light to show us where we are and where we ought to be and that's why Peter that's why Paul could say make straight paths for thy feet Grace that's given to direct us in the right pathway that's correction but what we're talking about here with tests and trials is approving everybody say they're with me approving oh come on let's say stronger approving brother Brandon lets us know clearly right here in this job was not being chastened of the Lord come on now you mean God's going to brag on somebody to turn around and whip them that don't make sense he said God was approving his servant so the test and trout you ought to put this back in the devil's face the test and trial is God showing his approval probably you're like me and saying I'm glad to be accepted into beloved but I don't know about all that approval right we want to we want that approval but I don't want what comes with it but remember when somebody's gotten real cold they're not afraid to test it you and I would be afraid listen if if we were asked about standing up on a trial we would say I don't know about that but God has confidence in the gold that has been placed in our life and so God doesn't matter for you oh and I don't know I don't know Lord I Lord let this cup pass for me I don't know how I don't but God has confidence that's why God is Not biting his nails I hope they make it oh I hope the Lions don't get them oh my I hope that ain't God we're standing there saying Lord give me Grace to get through it Lord give me strength to get to it Lord I need Grace for another day I need Grace for another moment and that's what we should be saying that's what we say that ain't weakness that's drawing strength from El shadia I need your grace lord I can't make it without you and God is Not biting his nails but he's just releasing to us more grace for that moment what's he doing he's making a way of Escape that we might be able to Bear the trial Hallelujah job 6 14. job lets them know in job 6 14. this is what he says to him to him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty in other words standing in the place of God is not standing in judgment on one another but standing in the place of God is going to minister to one in need who is my neighbor oh yeah what's what's my street address no no your neighbor is one that comes to your heart in your pathway that is in need amen that's your neighbor love thy neighbor as thyself are you hearing me now that's why I remember when they tried the scribes tried to be smart with him but telling us who is Thy Neighbor Jesus let him know the one that is pressed upon your heart that you see is in need well I'm glad because you know what brother saying he saw I was in need I was his neighbor he saw I was in need and he ministered to me he brought me into the end glory be to God he's ministering to my wounds and the needs of my life I'm glad that he picked me up because I was left for dead Lord be to God to him that is Afflicted pity should be shown from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty much more that could be said within that of verse 6. notice what job goes on to say it's very much like the same thing in job 16. job said I've heard many such things verse two miserable comforters are ye all vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest I also look in verse four I also could speak as you do if your soul were in my soul Stead I could Heap up words against you what you're doing to me I can do it to you in other words that don't take anything anybody can do that look this was wrong and you must be wrong and this is wrong but he noticed he says and I could shake my head at you but this is what I would do Glory I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief you know what this is this is a man who's connected to the sacrifice by revelation he's operating by the strength of the sacrifice knowing that we are but mortal and if there's anybody how who we need encouragement are you hearing me now friends sometimes the things we say well you need to be in church you need to be in church you need to be in church bless God you need to be in church you need to be I believe in that but so that's people already know that they encouragement are you hearing me now I know it's strong but I'm just saying it as he gives it to me people already that's why when I pray and ask God Lord help me to be an encouragement to somebody because the devil's already beating them out already putting them down listen I believe in correction I believe in point pains well they need to be born again they need to be born again they need to be born again they know they need to be born again brother Samuel maybe they don't what is repeating it over and over doing Sham in the Lord encourage let them see the joy of serving God that's in you let it be when you come around they're running to you instead of ducking away from you oh amen that was free that wasn't in the notes we need to be an encouragement to one another God help us to be more observant than what anybody can see everybody can see things on the outside but God help us to be in tune with the spirit of God to minister encouragement to somebody whether you think they deserve it or not you and I didn't deserve encouragement there's times God has come my own way and he's done things we don't deserve it God forgive us if we've acted like Bill dad zofar or a Lifehouse justifying ourselves and standing in a position I don't believe these men meant to do that I don't believe we mean to do that when I say God help us help us because if there's anything that the message of the hour points to we can point to many end times signs oh this scripture is prophecy that but don't forget about the scripture where Abraham he knew lot was down there Laura would you spare it and he went on down the list for adventure Lord forgive me what if it's only 10. God said for 10 I'll spare you know what Abraham was doing he was one that was connected to the mercy seat so he was there to intercede oh yeah Esther did not recognize her position in that part and the authority and the power that was given to intercede for others but the message of the hour reminded her and Mordecai told her you are here for such a timelessness to do what intercede for one another are you hearing me listen love cannot be defeated and lovely ain't talking about powdered sugar either right there's something to say you know what we miss you we love you oh boy maybe I just need to keep plowing in this field but notice so far I'm trying to get somewhere in verse 11 look what his he comes up and these guys don't stop they're unrelenting and let me just say this to you you know it really wasn't these guys what it was Satan had come around and begin to anoint him but REM tells us I have heard but now I see he said Satan got upon job's wife Satan got up on his friends he said now he's really going to turn it on him and see if he can get him to denounce the message that's what he says he's really putting the pressure on because if it's all out I clocked out man they stay over there at that plant glory to God I'm going home but what about when accusation comes all around you what if God allows something to rise in the church surely God wouldn't do that oh yeah brother Bram says God will allow a depressing Spirit to even come in the church and start to take away some of the joy to see what you'll do and with that he says he does that with a purpose to just stretch out his wings and show himself more real repeat account that's a right application right the right application is Oh Glory oh my what's going on well I don't know what's going on maybe I need to well if anybody at any place has ever done anything like that which I'm sure there are because there's humans that have felt where there's been a depressing Spirit my goodness I need to find a new pastor I need to find a new home and I one thing about it I'll tell you this right now every son and daughter of God every one of us is going to come to maturity is that right that's why with people's actions or what are more they don't judge their actions because you know what everyone it appears before God and I'm grateful just as much as God works things out on my life I'm glad that God is patient and mindful and working things out on every one of our Lives aren't you notice what zofar says should not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justified should thine lies oh Joe's been called a liar straight to his face now they're not just saying it should thy lies make men hold their peace when thou mock us shall know shall no man make thee ashamed verse six let me just skip some oh that he would show Thee the secrets of wisdom this is still so far that they are double to that which is know therefore that God exacteth Of Thee less than an iniquity deserves in other words what all you've got is just a speck to what you deserve job wow I feel a befriending coming on right here don't you take this person off my Facebook feed I'm gonna but remember this right here was part of the test not just removing of the things that's around him not just removing of his family but now to have accusations coming right at him from those that was friends you know God never called him anything different but his friends and even at the end of it God said you want the last you want this trial you want it finally the victory to come I want you to pray for him I want you to enter in on their behalf we won't get to that tonight I want you to do that think about when the disciples came I'm coming down here remember when the man who they looked at in John 9 and they said who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind right I mean that's how their their application something somebody did something wrong if this is in their life oh they were wrong wrong wrong wrong and Jesus said neither but this is so that the glory of God might be made manifest so this situation that you're trying to apply as Sin in them or sin in their parents It Isn't So it's an opportunity for the glory of God to be made manifest and brother Brandon picks it up like this brother Neville's been in an accident brother Chris for the Christ hit a post brother Branham same time same time frame boom and the gun went off three things happened and here's the things going on brother Brown calls it right out in the Tabernacle where it's being said oh brother Neville is out of the will of God but in the Christ is out of the will of God oh brother branham's out of the will of God brother Graham said see how things it looks like when all thumbs are down on you and then how their accusations come and he takes us right to this scripture of John 9. he said but all of this God has permitted that the works of God might be made known I don't know about you but the Holy Spirit inspired that thought some months ago I'm he's not finished with me yet we could take that from the prophet right there not just looking back at scripture but seeing it right now his head shouldn't have been on his shoulders is that right but you know what God wasn't finished with him and think what messages came out of that right there letting off the pressure that though something says it's correctly bored it's got to be produced from the factory itself it's got to be God is the one who makes Christians is that right it ain't a church boring us out and Fitness on a gun stock no we've got to be pressurized by the Holy Spirit oh glory be to God so what was it right application right here in job 21 actually in job 20. I don't have this down but to think of it in job 20 they you know they are speaking of in that moment of how that in life as I believe is the one speaking in that chapter and you know talking about the you know that those who do wrong and the things that take place in their life and you know these things happen and they lose this and this and this but Joe picks it up in chapter 21 and let me just paraphrase it but job makes clear yeah there's truth there but the wrong reward isn't always present in this life in other words Cloudy Skies are not always a sign of disapproval neither are everything going right signs of approval see what's Joe doing he's directing it back the approval is under the blood because you don't think of Lazarus and the beggar Lazarus the beggar and the Rich Young Ruler in this lifetime the Rich Young Ruler hey after meeting Jesus he continued to build more barns man it got bigger and bigger and better and better and better glory to God I've got a fleet of Cadillacs man I've got this but in actuality his day of Grace was gone and who who was the one that had a better reward the beggar Lazarus because he was in Abraham's bosom the rich the young man lifted up his eyes in hell right but in this lifetime if we go according to their application we could say ah everything's good to go this guy's good man he believes in the Commandments he believed but it wasn't so job 22 let me leave it like this in job 22. job is accused that what's happening to you is because you have sent the widows away empty you've not given water to the weary thou has taken a pledge from thy brother for none and stripped the naked of their clothing now these are scriptures right out of Exodus there are quoting truth but the application of it is wrong and the wrong application will never bring the right results you've got to have the right application God I need the right application in my situation I need the right applicant we can say that I need the right application because it's only the right application we receive the blessings of the Lord remember in the valley what we read there in Psalms 84 where we're drawing from in that Valley he make us the pools to be filled with rain it's not coming out of the valley oh I'm out of the Valley now the blessings come no if we can get into that place in the right right position in the valley then the wells start filling up the pool will start filling up why because it's a place what God wants to do for us in the valley that when we come out of it we're stronger but the right application means everything oh how we need him don't we I say God help me help us Lord amen to really really before before things that we just start we start saying things and talking about things God helped me to really put a guard about my mouth help me Lord to know when there's times that are things to be said and when there's times when there's things to be lived help me Lord not to be moving around and this has happened because of this and because of that God help us God help us one of the hardest times and things that is I would think a lot of times as a pastor is where things have to be brought out or maybe something pointed out but it's very rare that things are done in a manner to where it's correction because testing trials I want you to understand this tests and trials are not correction there are proven it's God pruning and approving Our Lives if you can just think back to what took place in heaven God was bragging on job right it wasn't Job saying hey Lord I'm pretty good hey God no if Joe knew what was coming he'd have been telling Lord don't pick somebody else to brag on Lord I defer my brother brag on sister Lord brag on my brother go just brag on them lord they're such a wonderful example lord they're a perfect and upright person but God was going to approve job what was he bringing out of job what was already in job what job didn't even realize laid in him God knew how late anyway God knows what lays in you and you're in our lives and like job I wonder how many times that even in this with the wrong application has come I wonder how many times because there's some of these things that job says he's going to have to go around and he's answered a little sharply are you hearing it's been truth that he's answered four years of life he's going to have to go around and make that right are you hearing me so look not only do they have the wrong application but it's testing job too you know sometimes I used to look and in my mind I've had different students I've had in the past that actually have listened in I found out later when I've ministered in other places they made comments being in my class but they if they were streaming this they never this hadn't been them but I wondered sometimes I thought you know I get the class list man Glory so-and-so moved out of the district or they moved to another elementary school thank you Jesus thank you Lord for your blessings on me and then they show up at the door and I'm ready to argue with him you're supposed to be in here you were supposed to be you're this is your ad what's your address tell me what your address is you know what I know because I already had to deal with them the year before in my classroom seven timeouts in there are you with me but don't just leave the classroom that applies to a lot of things in our life right but you know what even those things like that and the things that comes our way well we can look at oh boy this student oh this person oh this one on the job oh bless God I gotta get out of this department I gotta get yeah God said if we're not going to get it molded out here we're going to get it molded out over there because sure in the goodness and mercy going to follow you all the days of your life there's going to be things brought out of your life that only and bring out of your life and I'll tell you what from my flesh all of it to your flesh not one of us enjoys our character to be questioned we're ready to defend I'm speaking truth you know that we're ready to defend I gotta go out there I gotta call it I'm not saying that there aren't times where things have to be maybe laid out but check your heart if you're acting in an anxiousness it's not God leaving you but God allows accusations to come that's part of the ash Heap that's part of the trial it's things coming our way to see what we're going to do about it well they should have said that if they have the love of God in their heart bless God I've got I've got 52 quotes on what brother Brown said about this if they have the love of God so John are you wanting to call down fire from heaven on Jesus he's just accused you're beloved sweet bride calm down from Heaven Lord wrong applications wrong application wrong applications instead of saying Lord I need Grace I mean grace right now my fish is weak Lord my spirit is weary Lord I want him to vindicate myself I want to prove my I want to do Lord I don't even have the answer right now but I know I need Grace I need Grace Lord how many degrees right now Lord I need Grace for this moment Lord I need Grace Lord to make it through this trial I need Grace Lord what you see in me I don't see I don't know what you're doing but I need Grace Lord at this moment I need Grace so that I can give others Grace In This Moment Grace Lord so that in my own life coming back is the right application I need more of you Lord I need more come on musicians that's the way it's got to be oh I need more [Music] up till there's no room left in me [Music] for all those wasted hours all the complaining I've done Lord they're yours now oh I need more grace I need more I need more [Music] foreign [Music] you fill me with nothing less [Music] oh God help me to look in the mirror of the word Lord [Music] I need more of you thank you Give Me Your Love and the world can have the rest more over I could never get enough oh yeah [Music] for you Lord Lord [Music] we look into the mirror of God's word I want to examine my life I want to be true about it I'm saying this for me I want to be real about it it's not that I come to service expecting oh this thing if I don't get beat on the head it's not been I've not been a good service no trust we've grown beyond that because correction is not to beat us down correction is a light that points us where we're wrong and the right way to go right I know sometimes that maybe our personality or makeup we could respond to that we really feel like man I've been in a good service if I've been hammered on that that that doesn't apply but sometimes our makeups are like that sometimes maybe we've been conditioned that way but you know the word of God I don't care if a man moves he might stand here he might sit on a stool Jesus did most of his preaching sitting in a chair are you hearing me so the anointing had nothing to do with moving the anointing is the person you know I I am the way I am I I don't act no different than what I but it doesn't have to be it's the anointing and you know what it comes down to reflection I don't want to sit here in a service and say oh I see oh I see sister Caroline back there I hope she's well she's getting it what's wrong with that right sitting up here bless God yeah I see Shane not an old praise the Lord he's getting glory to God this service I tell you this has been a productive service you hearing me Church when we're to look into the word of God ourselves because God ain't going to give take me into Rapture because I'm checking on everybody else and measuring them up because who gave me the measuring stick anyhow right the Bible said work out your own salvation with fear and trimming what does that mean in my own self looking in the word taking account because how do you know that me taking account of this in the word and really saying Lord I've never seen it like that and God uses that as a channel now to minister to somebody else's life and that was needed in order to minister to their life he has no hands but ours no feet but ours oh God help us help us to look in the mirror of the word help us the Lord help me to have the right application help me not Lord like the Bible said by the Gomez quotes this scripture I'll tell you I've heard him quoted so many times and it's absolutely the truth the Bible said be swift to hear and slow to speak right we've heard it said God gave us two mouths in one ear nope that ain't what he said God gave us two ears in one mouth God help us help us the Lord to have the right application help us to have the right application help us like Paul said that we would comfort you with the God of all comfort that same comfort that we are comforted by in our trials and tribulations that you might be comforted that you might be strengthened you realize sometimes that there's things I think God has made this so clear sometimes there's things that you can you can point out I can look at things sometimes as a pastor of certain things but you know it's got to come to an encouragement first it's encouraging things because you know what it's got to be God to deal with lives are you hearing you might disagree with me but that's okay I know where I'm standing I know where I'm standing [Music] if there's anything we need right now in this hour we need encouragement we need encouragement an encouragement to one another one thing that I'll call and I'll send out and text and I call different ones and we miss you we miss you we love you let's say you don't mean you don't go through a Litany of Quotes no no I don't do that you know me by now I don't do that but it points you to Jesus Christ I don't say that's uplifting me you understand I'm not perfect I'm not perfect as much as you hear this out of this Bell right here God's had to teach me God's had to teach me brother Drake he's had to teach me but Shane he said to teach me and he's still teaching me oh I'm glad about that huh say Lord help us help help us help me helped me to have the right application just as much as I could expect that out of others Lord help me to have the right application in my spirit love suffereth long and it's kind help me help me Lord help me well I need more of you living in me [Music] girl oh let's land Hallelujah [Music] oh God [Music] I could never ever again [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to love [Music] to love for I could never [Music] he wants foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] experience for ever more [Music] you know I look and I meditate I meditate on these scriptures a lot I've just looked at that and I thought you know there's times that I think all of us can relate to maybe when we're talking to someone or and we in our own lives we think I don't want to compromise sometimes we view compromise that if if I don't say a scripture if I don't give a quote if I don't go through and really preach it to him I'm talking about sitting down with somebody then I'm compromising see sometimes things that we say or would have said is because we've come under our own pressure and you see what's happened you say well that was the leading of the Holy Spirit no God don't pressure he leads he leads us sometimes we're pressured and we start getting under I wonder how Bill daddy life has and so far I wonder you know what they probably if I don't say this if I don't I'm going to be no but you know they didn't say nothing for seven days when they first looked at job they didn't recognize him but one thing job did say if you would have just held your peace that would have been your wisdom how many knows sometimes just just holding their peace says a whole lot more than anything will come out here sometimes it's just holding their piece sometimes it's just being a listener I don't know how many times as a pastor sometimes it's just listening it's just listening when there has been times of Correction it sure isn't anything that I value I don't do it lightly but under his leading and I'll wait on him I don't care if people feel like I'm dragging my feet don't matter I don't go I don't walk according to nobody else is beat I want to know by his leading because I want him to accompany whether it's in the room on the phone or whatever more I want him to accompany you say brother Simon what do you look for I look for his leading and I want him to come to where it's like brother Brandon standing in the pasture where the bull is at to where I know when that Supreme anointing has taken over to where it's there [Music] sometimes different Brothers have had to be back there with me for different things and they can tell you they know when the anointing comes different ones that have set right back there and when things have opened up not even about correction just about opening of questions and you know it's more than a man it's God you know when his presence sets down eight and we can expect in our everyday walk like Joe job was waiting on it Lord I don't know what's going on here but what are you going to do Joe I'm going to stand on what I do know I'm just going to stand on that because he's never failed to tell me what I need to know when I need to know it and if I don't know it right now I'm going to keep looking to him and I'm standing here this trial ain't going to move me off of him I'm just going to keep on standing so Lord when you're going to answer you have to come right to the word because that's where I'm going to stand don't you love me father Lord I know it could be very simple thought that I I just love how you come this way Lord I love how you come to speak to our hearts and remind us Lord you're gonna even these things tonight Lord that we speak we speak from experience I think Lord God of every one of us there's times Lord that we all can say I can say that I've never sometimes I've never looked at accusations or being misunderstood or certain things being said sometimes I've never I've hadn't looked at that in the past I've quoted certain scriptures but Lord how you've opened it to me here in the past weeks my it's been really something Lord and I'm thankful for it because I've needed it Lord I think of what you told me Lord God a couple weeks ago in prayer there I'm leading you I'm leading you Lord you're leading us Lord in the valley you don't leave us you're leading us Lord when situations arise that are not favorable to our flesh yet you're leading us Lord you haven't left us for you said Lo I'm with you always you're leading us Lord help us Lord I pray to realize even in these moments Lord it's a time of growth Lord It's a time of maturing help us Lord I pray God mold us Lord in these situations or no doubt every one of us can say there's been times in the past Lord that when accusations I've tried to justify myself I've called up to people wrong for saying what they said and I have failed to recognize it was you allowing those things to come my way to temper me to mold me and shoot me [Music] Lord God let me submit to you Lord let me submit to you Lord like the scripture said commit all things unto you who is faithful in judging all things we commit ourselves to you Lord help us forgive us Lord God when we've not had the right application when others have not had the right application toward us Forgive Me Lord forgive us the Lord help us Lord in this moment I know you're speaking to us right now help us to grow in this moment Lord help us Lord to submit ourselves granted Lord granted Lord Jesus granted Lord as the lamb was led to the slaughter as a land that is done before her shearers help us Lord help us Lord when there's more of us that needs to be shaved off Lord take different means to share it off help us Lord may we just look to you for more grace help us the Lord granted Lord I pray go with your children Lord go with us Lord as we go our separate ways strengthen us the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ you love him [Music] Hallelujah oh there's such peace God bless you tonight [Music] from the father above oh sweet over my spirit [Music] I pray in fact [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] no never make heaven my home [Music] less let me walk with you Jesus alone for without you I know I could never [Music] make heaven my home [Music] yes I've been on the mountain with Jesus and I've been through the valley so low but never one time has he failed me so to him with my troubles I go please let me walk with you with Jesus don't ever leave me alone go without you I know [Music] make heaven my home [Music] You Found Me Lord You Found Me when I was sovereign [Music] found me when no one [Music] when no one knew
