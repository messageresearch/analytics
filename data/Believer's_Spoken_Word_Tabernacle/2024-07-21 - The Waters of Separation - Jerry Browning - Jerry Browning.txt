actually really good to see all of you again I always enjoy seeing you and and U uh it's always uh I always enjoy preaching here and uh you're a good group of people to preach to and you you uh uh you really help the preacher out uh I've uh uh back years ago when I actually was doing some traveling I had actually been in some places where uh I had to preach an amen myself and uh I remember one particular church I went to a group that that particular morning we had two services but on Sunday morning uh I was about maybe 10 minutes into preaching and I started praying to myself Lord help me get through this and uh I I felt like I was like just plowing uphill the whole way and uh so uh we went with the the pastor that day and then I came back that night to preach and and I was saying Lord what what would you have me preach and so the Lord laid on my heart just a little very simple Evangelistic uh type message about when David was anointed king all the hosts of the Philistines came against him and so I just preached that little message and and dealt with just personal kind of testimony type things of how the devil fights you and that and that and that place came alive it was like a different group you know but uh but I always enjoy preaching here you know I and it's very easy and uh so uh it's always a treat and I just uh I'd start mentioning you all by name but it would take up so much time and I wouldn't want to leave anybody out but uh you know there's I was thinking this morning there's some of you here that uh that I feel like I I've knowing some of you I've known basically all my whole life you know I I thought about first thought about sister Linda holdren you know where she was Carper when I first met her so uh and that and then uh I saw Brother David Crest when I came in I think Bo I you know just so many years and things and then uh then there's so many of you here that uh that we met when the work was first started here and things and and that and it just uh it's just really good to see you all and so many that we've met over the years thereafter and things and and so God bless you this morning amen let's just bow our heads now in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we come to you this morning morning we thank you God for this opportunity to be here we ask God that you would father come Lord now anoint us God I pray help us Lord that we'll be a yielded to you you'll be able to come and be a help to the people Lord Lord you know each and everyone here you know where they are God you know what their needs are father and I pray that God that you'll just direct us and guide us Lord and Lord as your Prophet says if we need to go off the main Road and go down a lane to to actually help somebody Lord just help us to be yielded to you as you direct us pray your blessings now in Jesus Christ's name amen while you're standing if you could turn up me in your Bibles to no Numbers Chapter 19 and uh this is actually a subject I preached on recently at home uh and so I kind of pulled some things from what I had preached on and and just felt to to Minister on he the water of separation and uh so I I pray that uh the Lord will just lead us and we'll just be able to reach everybody with it amen Numbers Chapter 19 uh we'll read from verses one down to verse 10 and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red heer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke and ye sht give her unto Eleazar the priest and that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and elazar the priest shall take her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heer in his sight her skin and her fles flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn and the priest shall take cedar wood and hisp and Scarlet and cast it in the midst of the burning of the hepher then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until even and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in the water and bathe this flesh in the water and shall be unclean until the evening and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the heph and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is a purification for sin and he that gathereth the ashes of the heer shall wash his clothes and be clean and unclean until the evening and shall be unto the children of Israel uh and unto the stranger that sojourn with them for a statue forever amen you may be seated we know that sin entered in to God's creation in the garden uh when uh man disobeyed God's word and uh and he disobeyed God's word because of unbelief and so there was then a a a necessity because uh the Bible tells us man uh there had to they had to be drove from the garden and there was an angel that was placed there to keep the way to the Tree of Life uh to so that man could not come back and partake of the tree of life because he had sinned and because of the sin H uh you know death entered in and so uh then uh there so then God comes and he he gives a promise so that man can have a way to actually be free from the sin and be able to at one day be able to return back to the tree of life and This Promise he made was that he said I'll put enity but to the woman he said I'll put enity but uh to the serpent he said I'll put enity between thy seed and the seed of the woman and he said and he shall uh you shall bruise his heel but he shall bruise your head so it was a promise actually of Redemption that God made there in the garden and so then uh there had to be uh a death uh that and so God slayed a lamb and he took the the the skins from the lamb and clothed his children and so then there so then there was a there had to be something for man uh brother brandham says that God gave him temporarily until that promise could be ful fulfi and so he uh brought a temporary perpetuation for their sin and until that the woman's seed could bruise the head of the serpent and pay the full penalty of sin and and so here we find that uh that God then here in the time of Moses he brings them this uh it's a purific for sin it was a temporary uh thing that was a shadow of the coming of the promise which was a promise of a messiah a a redeemer to come and redeem man and and and so they they would take this hepher and and they would slay the heer and they would burn every bit of the heer and and that and then once it was burned and reduced to Ash they would take the ash from this and they would mix it with water and then that was called then the water of separation and you you see here in the scripture that it's talking about the the priests washing themselves and washing their clothes in this water of Separation you know and you wonder what uh how could this this symbology of this be with being Ash in water well if you look back you find out that's what man first made soap out of was was Ash and so here God says wash yourself in this and so but not only were the priests to wash themselves and wash their clothes but the people were to come and be washed in this water of separation and and and this heer was offered uh once a year for the sins of the people and the people would come then and if they had sinned then they would be washed in this water and it was called a water of Separation it's separated them from the guilt of their sins Hallelujah and and actually would bring them back into a uh to a being holy before Jehovah to where they could come into the Tabernacle and come into fellowship with God and so but this was actually just uh as brother R said a temporary thing that God established until the promise could be fulfilled and so then you you know it was it was called the things in the old test called shadows and types this so this was the the the slaying of this red heer and the making of this water of Separation was actually a shadow of what God was actually pointing to what what was going to be when that promise was fulfilled when Christ was born and and so then you think about your Shadow uh you know if you're standing in light is casting across you and it and it cast and and you see a shadow as you walk toward uh that the light then eventually the shadow disappears and the Shadow's gone and what's there is actually the reality and that's the way it was with the promise of God there was a shadow of what God was going to do that what they were keeping here with the slay of the red heer but when Christ was born this the the the the reality of the promise came into view and the shadow was no more and that's why that Jesus said I didn't come to do away with the law but I came to fulfill the law see the law was actually uh pointing to what was going to come when the ultimate sacrifice Christ came and actually then law uh at at Calvary law metant Grace Hallelujah and then the law was fulfilled and we had Grace that's why we don't keep the law now we don't slay a red heer because Christ fulfilled that that was just a shadow pointing to his coming when he came and died that brought a fulfillment of what the law was a shadow of so it did away with the shadow now the now they had reality see when they would slay the red he the thing about it was it didn't remove the desire of Sin from man so that's why there was uh uh they had to constantly every year bring and make this sacrifice the Bible tells us that that once Christ came as a sacrifice it was a sacrifice once and for all and there's no more need of another sacrifice Hallelujah but it but here in the Old Testament it separated man from his guilt right and and so turn with me in Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll read verses 25 through 27 there the when Christ came then his blood he shed his blood his blood dropped on the ground and it was for the blood was for a PF ification and it and it and it it was for a purification of the world we know that the world we're living in still is not in that purified state but the price for that has already been paid that's how we know that that when the scripture talks about there's going to be a Rapture when the scripture speaks of uh you know of course the scripture doesn't use the word rapture it uses you know we'll be caught up together and and things but uh when it when it speaks of the coming of a A New Earth the time of the Millennium and then the coming of a new Earth and a new Heaven and these things we know that all that is is going to happen because we see the price for it the penalty of sin has been met and paid so now look here in verse 25 of Ephesians 5 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sink ify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish now what we've covered so far uh you know it uh it has a a lot of significance for someone coming to be forgiven of their sin and accept Jesus Christ as their savior but it but this the the application of it doesn't stop with the believer there we constantly apply it to our lives and uh you know the thing that I find with with many Believers is you know we we realize every day we live with the accuser of the brethren Satan the accuser of the brother and he's there he's always coming against you yeah and as brother random said in the greatest battle ever fought said he chose his Battleground he chose the mind so Satan is constantly attacking you and he attacks the believer you know and and and and I know there at one time I had heard from different people thought well when I get the Holy Ghost or when this happens and I won't have that anymore I won't have that that's that's not what it is because brother brandom said look he said uh the the promise in in in the Bible is to the Overcomer and he say so God's not going to take you he says and pull you up through a pipe and bring you out the other end and say blessed is the Overcomer he you give you've not overcome anything he say so you're going to have to have things to overcome and one of the things we got to overcome is in this battle of the mind that Satan continuously wages against the believer and there Ison he brings this is to try to bring doubt to you and and friends look you you you say well I never have a doubt about about this message being the truth I don't have a doubt about God I don't have a but you know what he brings the doubt on the doubt is about you he tries to get you to doubt your righteousness doubt whether you're holy doubt whether you're going to make the Rapture you know how many could raise their hand and say at some time the devil said you're not going to make this Rapture oh yeah oh yeah right I remember several several years ago uh before we ever had this building brother Dan daisley had come up and he was giving a testimony and he said he was out one time traveling with his brother Henry green was his Pastor back then he said we were out going somewhere together he says and we we stopped at a gas station and he said uh I I I went to go use the restroom he said I come out and I couldn't find brother Henry anywhere he said and I was looking for him he said and and all of a sudden he said a thought ran through my head the raptures took place and you missed it that's why you can't find brother Henry and he said at first that thought just kind of like brought a fear he said then he said devil you're a liar because if the Rapture took place I wouldn't be here either you know now he didn't say that because of some fleshly works or his uh uh his confidence in his own self but because of his confidence in the power of Jesus Christ in his [Applause] life so we've all had that where the devil will say you know you're going to miss it you know you're not going to make it and he constantly points out anytime you make a mistake I'll tell you something the devil's going to be right there to point out your mistake to you and and the thing you realize is you know and and he'll try to make you think you're thinking of this or God's making you feel this way and that but I'm going to tell you something for friends God never makes his Believers feel condemned but Satan does that Satan brings condemnation Satan's the one that makes you feel like I'm not I'm not good enough I I'm not righteous look what I've done I've made this mistake I I've messed up I've sinned I've done this and now I'm not worthy it's Satan that does that amen when when God deals with us when we're s God actually deals with us to move to get right make it right Hallelujah so the washing of Water by the word so it's the word that washes us now because Jesus Christ we find the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and came Among Us and dwelt among us and so the word made flesh in Christ and then Christ died that sacrifice and then the the water of separation for us is actually the word of God hallelujah and so we brother Bram then he points talking uh when brother brandham was preaching about the Waters of Separation he brings it back to Ephesians 5 here and he says that washing of Water by the word that is the water of Separation to the believer today and he says what is that he says it's the preaching of the word that when the word is preached he says it actually identifies for us our condition it will the word will point out if if there's anywhere that we need to make a correction the word will Point friends look there are times that you can do something that make a mistake sin and and you don't even realize done it I'll show it right remember brother brandom when the IRS was just really hounding him and brother bam later gives a testimony how they he was under such pressure with it that when the IRS man the one day called to the house he was under such pressure he told his wife sister Min he said he went to step out the door and says tell them I'm not here and and so he went on out then brother brand went on about his life like everything was fine and then he gets a call some child is sick and needs prayer and brother brandom goes to go pray for the child and then the Lord speaks to him and says points him back to that lie he told brother Brandon wasn't even he didn't even think anything about it but God brought it to his attention and then brother Brenham then he goes then and he calls up the IRS man he confesses what he he did you know and he and he and he clears that up and makes it right then goes and prays for the child and the child is healed so there's times we can do it but then the there's times we're sitting in in in church and the Lord through the preaching will bring something out and point something out and say oh my goodness I didn't even realize I did that but he's not bringing it to your attention to bring condemnation to you but he's bringing it to your attention because he is the perpetuation for your sin is a sacrifice for your sin and he not only provided a perpetuation but he provided a way of access to you to that perpetuation by saying if any man say they haven't sinned he he's a liar and the truth's not in him so John said we've all sinned you know but it says but if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen amen hallelujah praise God and so there there is and it says he's a perpetuation for our sin he is our Advocate with the father right so brother bam says if if he he says in the message of water of Separation he says you know look that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word he says if you've got a sin apply by the word it's the water of separation and it'll separate you from your guilt Hallelujah and it brings you it was a way to bring you back into [Music] Fellowship I've uh at times I've had people you know you're counseling with and and and you know maybe some things happen in in their life and and some things that are uh actually uh uh you know making C requirements out of them in this life and and maybe they'll miss a couple of services or so and and at first they think it's fine but then after they're out of church for a couple of services you know then all of a sudden they start feeling like I'm so far from God of course Satan's there to attack and say well then you might as well just quit and give up see but what that actually means friends look it is important to stay in fellowship with God that's right it's important to to have a prayer life it's important to listen to the message it's important to read your Bible and it is important to forsake not this semon of yourselves together even so much more as you see the day approaching that's right you know we we draw from fellowship from one another when we come and we assemble here we draw strength from one another maybe it's not from somebody directly saying something uh to you and that but when the all the Believers come together begin to worship maybe you're really going through something maybe that in your human feelings and that you think I don't really feel like singing But you get in there and then you get surrounded by your other brothers and sisters that maybe at that time they're up and so then that encouragement comes and then you're together you draw strength from one another and then there's the preaching of the word that God has provided away Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word but how can we hear the Bible says andless there be a preacher so God works through the fful ministry to minister to his people to bring the word to free you from your [Music] guilt because Satan attacks us to try to discourage us but then the word comes and says brother B says look he says one of the things that's our problem is is you don't know who you are you don't know who you are he said I dealt with so many people he says I realize it's the truth he said they you don't realize who you are you are the Bride of Jesus Christ look we're not depending on our works we're not depending on have I been good for 30 days we're not dependent on have I you know when was the last time I met made a mistake or when was the last time I Sinn that that's not what our righteousness is depending on our righteousness is not depending on something that God needs to do for us our righteousness is depending on it's already been done the price has already been paid the ultimate sacrifice has been made Hallelujah you don't have to come and get saved again all you got to do is confess your sin and he forgives you amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the the word comes and the word's preached how many times have you sat in service you know and heard uh uh your pastor or a visiting minister or some someone preaching and and you and you think my goodness the things they're saying me and my wife or or something we just talked about this we just had this conversation how did they know about it they didn't but there is one that knows all and this is the very the most important thing you know a lot of people say you know there's allseeing eye you know God knows everything God knows what you do or whatever but look from friends I'm going to tell you something God's not Santa Claus you know that old saying about you know about Santa you know he knows whether you're sleeping he knows when you're awake he knows whether you've been bad or good for so Be Good For Heaven's Sake and if you're not good you don't get a gift you get a piece of coal that's not God no Christ paid the price and God God made the promise back in the in the garden in the days of Adam and Eve that he was going to provide a way back for mankind and it wasn't based on whatever man could do because God knew man couldn't keep the Covenant that's right so God made an unconditional Covenant it's not if you do this I'll do that but I have already done it all you need to do is just accept it Hallelujah so just as the water of Separation separates the sinner from his sin the water of Separation it separates the Born Again Believer from the guilt that Satan tries to bring on them and condemn them and make you doubt yourself that's realize Satan when he does that he's always pointing at you want you to look at yourself this is the thing we're not to look at ourselves we're to look at our sacrifice Hallelujah and then the the preaching of the word god comes and friends look I've had people you know come out of services and and brother brandham gives I think actually Billy Paul gives a testimony one time and hearing somebody come two people coming out of brother brandom service and and one said tell you what when I was there he called me a buzzard and and and and the other man said that's funny he called me an eagle so you know what are you you know what are you getting out of it and I've had people you know that come to church and maybe God will bring a message that that's actually a message of Correction but you realize if God's bringing a message of Correction to you it's because you're his child why isn't God correcting the world out there because they don't belong to him that's right if there's anyone out there in the world that belongs to him he will bring correction and he'll bring them in under the word to be washed by the word David said you know he he he looked and said consider the blessings of the wicked but the Lord said to him consider their end well let's just take and flip that consider your end what is your end I don't have an endall you know what we've got facing us as Believers we've got a new beginning we have we we we have a new life and one day that new life that's came on the inside of us by the separation from the things of the word uh World by the word of Christ one day what's happened on the inside this outside will eventually come and it'll match that [Music] hallelujah hallelujah why do we continuously need this washing of the Water by the word after we've come and give our lives to Christ accepting as a savior been born again filled with the Holy Ghost remember when Paul speaks in in Ephesians 4 and Paul talks about that after you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost he says put off from you all envy and all malice and and all these things so Paul says look you're still going to be contending with this flesh after you're sealed by the Holy Ghost because it's not this flesh that's sealed by the Holy Ghost it's your soul it's that real you that is that that new life you know look friends it was there all along some people try to say well the preacher put that there or the prophet put that there no they didn't you came here that way brother renom said in in in the the one message he says somewhere in the back part of God's mind you were a thought of God before the world was even formed so God had you in his thoughts you were you came into this world I don't care what you were born in I don't care whether you were religious or or a a non-religious person you were born with that seed of God in you and that seed of God friends what that was that was the real you hallah but until that was quickened by the word and came to life you were dealing with this old worldly nature that you were born into his brother and him said because of of the sin in the garden he said you bypassed your theophany when you came into this life oh but when you heard the word of God said and you you recognized it to be truth he said then you heard from that theop hallu hallelujah praise God realizing who you [Music] are hallelujah amen hallelujah I'm I'm you know the devil continuously he comes and tries to remind you remember remember this thing You' done in your past remember that thing You' done in your past and you think well I've got beyond all that but then maybe you're washing dishes or or washing the car or mowing the lawn or or on the job or whatever you're doing and all of a sudden a thought will go through your head and it'll be a remembrance of of some sin or something you did before you gave your life to the Lord and then before you know it your mind gets to dwelling on that and then you start feeling so bad about it even though you you know you've already been asked asked forgiveness from that and God's already came and cleanse you from it but you begin to feel so tore up about it have you ever woke up from a dream where you were dreaming about things that you had done before you gave your life to the Lord and you wake up and you feel terrified right that's because we still got this human memory and those things are are there and and some of the things are like scars in our memory and Satan comes to continuously remind you of those things but friends look one day that memory is going to be changed and we're not going to have a memory of those things anymore because we're going to be in a theophany in a glorified body that matches this this change that's happened down in our heart amen and then we're going to be there a Triune being in in in in in in in a being that never did those things so how could you have any memory of it you didn't do it brother said we're Justified we never did it in the first place but see sometimes we have trouble accepting that right now because we are in this flesh this flesh still feels Temptation This flesh still makes mistakes brother Ram said my worst enemy he said is William Bram talking about his flesh that's our worst enemy he said it's our flesh Hallelujah but look Friends when the word is applied to your life then everything that Christ died for every promise is yours brother Ram says as freely as the water flow am hallelujah praise God brother an preached a message a handwriting on the wall I'm sure you're familiar with that message brother R was talking about how there in in that Kingdom uh they were having a big party and all of a sudden a hand appears and and writes on on the wall uh I think it's something like meanie Meenie tickle The Parson or something like that and uh uh and so then they didn't what it said everybody was here they brought Daniel in Daniel interprets for him you know you're weighed in the balances and found wanting and brother ad is preaching this message and you realize that he's he's trying to reach out to the people and to the to the actual re religious people and churches and denominations that day and saying look it's your righteousness is in Christ but you because of your approach you're being weighed in the balances and you're being found wanting and brothers really bringing a message to actually bring a conviction and bring a correction to the people and then at the at the close of that message brother Ram said how many loves him with all your heart you're ready if he should come oh how thankful don't you feel just like you're scoured out now inside the gospel we are Washed by the Water of the word hallelujah don't you feel real good now am so see when when the words coming forth It's not the Brin condemnation for us people i' I've seen people come out of church and like man I really got whooped today and and there's been times as a pastor that I was like wow that wasn't that wasn't the way I took it when I got this thought on my mind at all you know and and and I thought it was going to be encouraging but you know look friends it's all in how you got got to look at it through God's eyes not Man's eyes we we look at it through Man's eyes and we're being uh persecuted our names being cast out as evil we lies told on us we're being abused and and all these things and we look at woe is me brother juel for would say wowy wowy wo but then you look at it Through The Eyes of Christ and he says rejoice in that day amen when they are doing that to you he said Rejoice he actually say leap for Joy he said because so did their fathers of the prophets amen so when you look at it through God's eyes you realize that it's actually showing identification right look you're not the one that's casting people's names out as evil you're not the one that's lying on somebody you're not the one that's abusing somebody you're the one that's being lied on abused so you see it shows your identification by the scripture right right right amen somebody's got to fulfill the scripture I'm thankful I'm fulfilling the part where I got to go through trials I'm thankful that I'm fulfilling the part where my name is cast out as evil I'm thankful that I'm fulfilling a part where people lie on me I don't want to fulfill that other side Hallelujah that's why looking through Jesus's eyes he can say when this happens to you rejoice leap for Joy when you look look friends Satan continuously tries to get you to look at yourself through your eyes so good we've got to look at oursel through God's eyes that's right that's friends when God looks at you he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't see your failures he doesn't see your fault because brother Adam said look he says here you stand as a red sinner he said but the red blood of the red sacrifice God looks through red and to red and sees white as snow the red of the blood washes the red sinner white as snow so God looks through the blood and he sees you through the blood sacrifice of his own son huj he sees you holy he sees you righteous Hall so then really all you've got to contend with and deal with is your own condemnation how do you do that look at what the word says about you amen that's that's what this particular message that's on my heart is all about the washing of Water by the word is actually how am I saying you to be washed by the word today instead of looking at what Satan tells you instead of looking at what you see out of your own eyes look through the word of Jesus Christ and see what God says about you I I I've talked to people over the years at times and they' say brother Jerry I'm just having a real hard time you know seemed like I was doing so good for a while there and and I felt so good and I really felt like a Christian and all of a sudden I you know this or are that happening now look at me well look friends go back to what I read to you out of Ephesians 5 it says uh let me just go back to it instead of just trying to quote it off top of my head he said that he might present it to himself a glorious church so he washes you by the water of the word that he might present you to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish it's not what you do you don't got to present yourself holy to God that's on Jesus Christ and he said he would do that he would present you look the Bible says this good work that he's starting in you he's faithful to finish it until the end Hallelujah you Lord look friends God it doesn't matter what you do God never gives up on his children he never reaches a place and say well now my child has went too far now not that I want to expand a lot on this but look his the the the the the the forgiveness of sin is actually the Bible says for the whole world but they've got to confess their sin and accept Christ that's good Hallelujah and God being just look friends he even had to offer Cain a way to be accepted everyone must be offered that's right the way and then you know it's on free moral agency it's their choice and then you realize friends that there are people that when they reject God's word then there is a place where brother R says they cross over the line between grace and he says then all that's left is Judgment but look friends it's impossible for the elect child of God to be lost I remember times even myself when I was a lot younger you know and I made a lot of mistakes and the devil would come and he'd say hey I want to quote to you out of Hebrews once you've been enlightened and come to the knowledge and that to to sin there remaineth no more sacrifice for your sin there's no way back for you you knew this message was right you knew about the prophet and look what you went did and and the devil like Hebrews 6 I think in Hebrews 10 he like used them as clubs to beat on you but go listen to the message brother R preached on that and then you find out wait a minute I'm a Child of God I don't fit that amen hallu hallelujah hallu praise the Lord hallelujah friends look here's the thing with repentance it there has to be a Godly sorrow and then there's another part of repentance more than just saying I'm sorry it's actually turning from the sin so you realize for the believer for the child of God they want to turn from it but then you find so many that really what it is they just don't want to be accountable for it they don't really want to turn from it they just don't want to be held accountable look that you can see that all over this world today that's right if you you know if you'd ever take some time one time and just go sit in in in a courtroom somewhere for a day and hear the different cases that comes up and things like that you'll find out nobody wants to take be accountable for what they do would you just overlook this oh but that's not what God comes to do he didn't come to overlook anything right friends but we're we are accountability for for whatever it was God met that through Christ am you know people say Well it when Christ was crucified it was uh him being on the cross and the nails through his hand or blood he lost or the spear in his side that killed him brother said no he said it was the weight of the sins of the world that God put on him that actually broke him and took his life if you ever study about a crucifixion friends they a crucifixion was a very slow uh painful way to die a man would uh be up there on the cross and slowly he would suffocate because he would uh he would lose strength to try to push himself up so his diaphrag begin to crush and so slowly they actually suffocated it was a long and painful capital punishment but look in the scripture Christ it would last friends if you study this you find crucifixions would last for days sometimes with Jesus Christ it did not hallu he died he died within a manner of ours why it wasn't the cross it wasn't the crucifixion it wasn't the spear it wasn't the nails it was none of those things it was my sin that was put on him that killed him what what what am I saying he paid the price Hallelujah that's what I was worthy of that's what you were Worthy ofall he was he was without blemish he was a sacrifice without blemish he was a sacrifice that never had a yoke on him [Music] Hallelujah even pilate you realized they had to in the Old Testament they had to inspect the sacrifice before they offered it and the sacrifice couldn't have any blemishes on it right it had to be a perfect uh uh animal sacrifice yes and here stands pilate of Roman and he says I find no fault hallelujah what was that that was a proclamation this sacrifice is worthy we've got a wor we had a worthy sacrifice Hallelujah he was sinless the Bible said yes he was tested and tried in every way such as knowing to man yet without sin but there's no way for us to face this life without sin the Bible said if we say we have no sin then the truth's not even in us hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah turn with me to Hebrews chapter 10 and I'm I'm going to kind of just skip through some vers verses here I'll start with verse two and uh I'll tell you each verse that I want to read to get this point across Hebrews chapter 10 verse2 for then would they not have ceased to be offered now this is Paul talking about the the the sacrifices that were offered in the Old Testament for the sin of the people and that sacrifice Paul said had to be offered every year but now he's talking about the coming of Christ as the sacrifice says and then Paul goes on to say he said that there's no more need for another sacrifice let's read here uh for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipper once purged should have no more conscience of sins now look down to verse 12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down at the right hand of God verse 14 for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified Hallelujah and verse 17 and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more Verse 18 now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin brother bam says this in the message of Jubilee 1954 he said he quotes that scripture once for by one sacrifice has he perfected forever those who are Sanctified in Christ Jesus once for all he says oh you'll backslide you'll do things that's wrong but one time Christ sanctifies a human soul by filling him with the holy spirit it's perfected forever there you are no more desire to do the wrong hallah for the worshipper once purged has no more conscience he said that means desire has no more desire of the sin nowhere for he has perfected by one sacrifice forever those that are in Christ Jesus that is so good am yes sir Hallelujah when the Fulfillment of the promise of the Messiah was was when God began to move and he moved on Mary to bring to pass this fulfillment through this vessel and brother Ram says God created a blood cell in Mary he says and that blood cell he said it didn't come from a man or a woman it was the creation of God righten it was he said a blood cell God created he says and that blood cell began to multiply and he says until it became a infant in the womb of Mary he says then it was the baby was born and he says and it was the creation of God it didn't come through fleshly desire and he says then he says then Christ comes then as he reaches that age and it comes the time for him to be that to to come and and and fulfill be in that sacrifice he says that blood cell he said what you know the blood cell has the that's where the life is is in the blood cell he says then that blood cell Christ shed his blood he said that blood cell was burst he says and from there then becomes the life of God to come back on the Believer by the blood of Jesus Christ yes sir and when that has happened to the believer friends look you are no longer your own Hallelujah you've got a new life that's what actually being born again means it doesn't mean turning over a new Leaf it doesn't mean becoming religious it doesn't mean keeping of of laws or or keeping good works or or doing good things friends look it doesn't mean saying oh yeah I believe God sent a prophet we we we need to believe that we need to realize that but that's not enough you've got to have a changed life there's people out here friends that they've come to the knowledge of the message and they and they go out there and they live in the world and they think I'm going to be okay because you know I I believe God sent a prophet wow you know I I believe that Prophet I I'm wait if I ever hear on the news that Los Angeles is going down I'm going to run back to the church and get right why are you waiting I going to tell you friends there here's the thing they need to have a change happen in their life amen that's what everyone needs to have I don't care who you are I don't care who your daddy is who your mother is who anything you've got to have a changed life you've got to have the life from the blood of Jesus Christ that life comes from that blood shell come in you Quicken you make you a new [Applause] person hallelujah hallelujah and when that happens then you have accepted your sacrifice yes Lord and Lord friends then you're perfected forever amen oh there's so many times we don't feel perfect it's like brother bam gives that little illustration about I think it was a a donkey or a mule or something and and the little uh little fella he said looked at his mother and says when the farmer comes out here and sees me I'm all uh knobby need and and cross-side and everything else that he's going to kill me oh my she says no he's not even going to be looking at you he's coming out here for the lamb my brother says he God's not looking at you he's looking at your sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah if you're feeling condemned today then apply the word right if you're not feeling perfect today then apply the word say how do I do that look it ain't how you feel the word says you've been perfected forever ever take that accept that and believe that and walk out of here free this morning Hallelujah brother bam says this in the message of Jubilee year he says he says people say well I don't walk worthy he said but Christ in you makes you walk worthy amen he says I'm not perfect never will be in this world you're not perfect never will be in this world but my love to him he lets me live for him he said and if I found out I do something then I'm chastened of the Lord why does God do this that we wouldn't be condemned with the world what is that word condemn there you know you it comes from what what uh in the scripture uh where where it talks about not being condemned with the world what it's talking about being dead damed right right hallelujah hallelujah brother R says this in in the deity of Jesus Christ he says he said this is where I got that from where he says people don't realize who you don't realize who you are he said he said every person in here can live above sin can live without sin Living God you'll make mistakes right but the blood of Jesus Christ will forgive you hallelujah thank you Lord I'm sure you're so familiar with it so many times it's been referred to I think I actually preached a message some years ago here and and used uh the the entire interview of sister Bruce where brother bam interviewed this sister prior to preaching the message of the Masterpiece and but I just want to point to a little section that's in this interview and you know she came to brother brandom because she said she wasn't feeling worthy she didn't she didn't feel like she had the Holy Ghost she didn't feel right and and that and so brother r says look he says uh uh when God looks at us he says I'm not a sinner and neither are you we got the blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Jesus Christ he said he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we're Christians he says and I believe you are a genuine Christian woman and and and she says uh but I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times and brother and said that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you he took your mistakes he says look the desire of your heart is to serve him now I go back to the worshipper once Purge has no more conscience or brother says desire of sin you'll make mistakes but it's not not because you have that desire and because that desire is not there when God brings a correction or or points out this area where you need to make a a repentance of friends the desire in your heart is to be right before God so you nobody's got to Prime you or pump you you're willingly as soon as it comes to the believer's conscience he oh Lord forgive me I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that cleanse me Lord cleanse me Lord hall hallelujah hallelujah and he says your desire in your heart to serve him she said that's right he said that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not looked at not lotted to you he's your perpetuation he's your sin offering your sins are not knowing you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him Hallelujah the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart brother Adam says in the message of Fellowship he says you know he said science come out and said God was wrong about that his word's wrong about that man doesn't think with his heart brother man said they say he thinks with his mind his head he said well yes that's your intellect right and he said that's actually says a lot of people's problems when they come up for prayer is they say they got faith he said but it's all intellect it's all intellectual Faith he said but let that let that Faith drop he here here from the intellect and come down here and hit in the heart then every sickness every disease everything that Satan com is defeated Hallelujah Hallelujah as a man think in his heart Brother s but they have found out in medical science that there actually is a chamber in a person's heart that there's not even a blood cell there and he said that is where the soul is that now they can't find that on an X-ray your soul they can't pick it up on an MRI they can't pick it up on some kind of a scan hallu amen but it's there and that's what God sees Hallelujah so let the washing of the water of the word let the word come and perform a scan over you this morning it'll show what's inside you it shows the real you what's in your heart the real [Music] you Hallelujah Satan can't see that Hallelujah Lord Brother R said look Satan can't read your mind he can give you a thought but he he can't read your mind he says he'll give you a thought and then he stands back and watches see what is your reaction going to be to that the that's right I was talking to brother Dan daisley was many years ago I went and I was my wife and I were there we visited him in his home and we were sitting there talking to him in that and he G he gave me some personal testimonies about himself and I was like amazed brother Dan was saying you know one of the things he struggled with he says I get to feel like nobody cares about me nobody loves me and I thought man brother Dan you are loved all over the place everybody loves you and loves your ministry and I thought about the church up here you know that had been helped so many different times over the years by his ministry back then and that and I thought everybody loves you they love to hear you preach and all that but he said look it was the devil it was in his mind it was a thought the devil's going nobody cares about nobody loves you it shows that was the human man there that was the Flesh and then he shared with me he says he was talking to brother Perry green one time and he said and brother Perry gave him a testimony that he was he brother Perry was with brother brandham and he was feeling so condemned and he was feeling so bad and finally he told Brother BR said I know you can just tell what's wrong with me because you're a prophet he says but he says I have the most awfulest I've been having the most a awless evil thoughts he said and brother brandom told Brother Perry he said look he said that's just the devil they're not your thoughts he said but these thoughts from the devil he says they're just like birds he says you can't stop them from flying over he said but you don't got to let them Nest there right that's what brother brandom told Brother Perry and he shared this testimony with me said don't let him Nest there that's our problem a lot of times the devil brings the thought and we get the dwelling on it that's what he meant by letting it Nest there yeah that's not me I don't know where that thought come from listen to this there was a a a preacher one time brother Brandon was having a prayer line and he asked the preachers that were up on the pull pit come and stand with me lay hands on these people and help me pray for these people and there was one particular preacher that he wouldn't step up there he he stayed back and brother brandham then after said brother why didn't you come up why why did you stay back he said brother brandom he said by the time he said I had the most filthiest thought he said went through my mind and I thought oh I'm not worth I'm not going to go up there and lay hands on brother Bram said I apologize to you brother I'm so sorry he said that thought was meant for me he said and you stepped in the way of it wow wow wow so even the prophet of God no wonder you know he makes this statement I'm not perfect he says and I never will be in this world that's right but the worshipper once purged is perfected forever hallelujah hallelujah as a man thinketh in his heart so what do you think in your heart what do you think here not what you think in here right this is where Satan attacks you at but friends he can't attack you in here hallelujah so what do you think about yourself in here I'll tell you what your thought is in here your thought in here comes from look you are as much apart as God as Christ himself and as Christ was the word is the word you are the word you're part of the word you and Christ are one amen hallelujah it's brother ROM say you can no more die than God can die Hall yes this body might die and go by the way of the grave but you can't die there'll be No Grave that can hold this body downall there is no condemnation of the devil that can prevent me from having a body change when that time comes [Applause] my change is not dependent on how good a person I am it's dependent on there's already been a change happening here brother said before you can have that change in and be resurrected or have that change in the time of the Resurrection he said there first must have been a change or Resurrection Happening Here Paul speaks of it as that being the the proof that we've got a deed to this it's the proof Hallelujah hallu that is our inheritance and our proof is it's already happened in here hallelujah and that's how that I know that on the day when the rapture takes place when the dead in Christ rise I know that the word by the promise of the word I'll be changed if I'm still alive I'll be changed from this vile body hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord praise God let me let me just drop this to you you know how the Bible tells us and brother brand emphasizes on it that during the time of the Millennium that he said Satan will be bound for a Thousand Years brother Ram says he's not it's not bound by like a physical chain brother ram calls a logging chain to try to give you a description of what he's saying it's not something of a physical chain he said but it's a chain of circumstance what is that circumstance the circumstance is look friends now he's he can attack you because of the mind he can attack you because of this flesh he can attack you because of your memory and your spirit and these things but in the in that time what he's Bound by is you're not going to be in this flesh you're going to be in a changed body you know a glorified body that's wrapped around a theophany not a human Spirit the Lord a memory that's been wiped remember brother random referring to he says you know when the Rapture takes place we go into the marriage supper of the Lamb he says you'll be sitting there at the table he says people begin to look around and say and they'll begin to miss certain ones that are not there they didn't make it right and he said and when that happens he says Jesus will come around and he'll wipe that from your memory Hallelujah he said he has to wipe that from your memory hallu so it can be heaven for you right so you won't you won't be remembering all these ones that didn't make it you won't be remembering uh you know I did this or i' done that matter whatever friends oh my goodness look you don't got to wait till the marriage supp of the Lamb to fill that Liberty and freedom you can feel that Liberty and freedom today by allowing the word to wash you look at what the word says about you who you are Hallelujah as a man thinketh in his heart hallelujah hallelujah B says it's not how good you can be it's accepting what Christ has done amen hallelujah all right let me bring this to a close you know people that uh have maybe done things in their past i' I've actually even dealt with relatives that they they really struggle sometimes in their mind because of of things they did in their past and and they feel so bad about it maybe they can go on for a while they feel okay but then these things come back to their mind and and they think oh I did this you know remember I did this oh I was a bad mother or I was a bad father or I was this or whatever you know the thing is they say the problem people have is is forgiving themselves they can't let go they keep living in the past no because they have trouble forgiving themselves right amen and and you know in Psychology today they say you know a person has to forgive themselves and quit punishing themselves for those things but then brother branam gives the illustration about the man during the time of the Civil War that was actually uh brought up on charges because he said he had abandoned his post and and and so it said uh you know uh here he was going to be uh executed for that face a firing squad and so the mother of this boy writes President Lincoln and so this came comes before President Lincoln so President Lincoln he writes and signs a pardon for the young man and they take the pardon down there and when they get down they tell him the president of the United States we've got a pardon right in our hand for you uh that he's pardoned you you can go free and he and the man said I don't believe it and so the the story go the young man end up being executed for it and what the decision they made was that a pardon is only a pardon if it's accepted as a pardon so look your pardon there you've got Christ paid the price he is your pardon he's issued God has issued a pardon for you but you got to accept it accept his forgiveness you say how do I forgive myself you didn't you weren't the one who did it that was that old man that was that old nature youve buried them amen it's been cleansed and Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ that new life that's come in you that life never did those things that's right yeah maybe this body but one day you're going to have a body that matches what's inside amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah brother Ram is speaking here in the message of Victory Day He says um he said heavenly father I'm so in debt to you there's no way I could ever pay the debt of my sin I was in a Cell one day cuz I was born in that cell and he said I knew I I I know what Freedom meant but the price was too great and I couldn't pay it but I'm so glad that the day you visited my C he's feeling his cell like it's being in jail in prison he said I recognized it that you were the only one uh that could pardon the only way I could ever be free was to have a victory a complete victory was to accept the pardon that you signed for me and today I'm free I'm so happy Lord I've I I visit uh from prison house to prison house for those who are are have got mixed up in marriage Scruples and and sick and fevered and and and sick and imprisoned and sinful and in prison and those who are have frustrations and doubt in prison and I'm going from cell to cell telling them the governor is coming right along pardoning everyone that everyone can come out and he said father you know the heart of the people here today may this be of V Day a complete V day may this be the day that when everyone Lord today will receive the Victory May every sick person be healed in this building may this the the backsliding uh of the desert time when the voice of the Lord will speak through the burning fire of Faith oh God that little fire burning there of faith that little hope that's burning May the voice
