[41:51] amen amen amen
[41:55] amen
[41:58] thank you
[42:00] musicians you know I think what what
[42:02] speaks to me that song you know I was I
[42:05] was telling
[42:07] um I think it was brother Ben I was
[42:10] telling you know I might be 44 years
[42:15] old
[42:16] but thank
[42:21] you yeah I was um someone asked if I was
[42:23] Zion's brother thank you um
[42:29] but I I said you know and and I I
[42:31] believe that there's I believe I'm not
[42:33] weird I think that a lot of people are
[42:35] are kind of like me and that though we
[42:39] get
[42:41] older there's that little person you
[42:43] know that that little boy inside that
[42:44] little girl inside right maybe I'm just
[42:47] being too vulnerable right now and no
[42:48] one else wants to admit anything like
[42:50] that but I feel like I'm still that
[42:52] 20-year-old like a bit uncertain at
[42:55] times you know and we're just kind of
[42:57] going we're just going with this it's
[42:59] like are you sure no well you look sure
[43:02] well it's just honed art you
[43:05] know and uh you know cuz I was I was I
[43:08] was telling him about brother Samuel and
[43:09] I was like you know brother Samuel to me
[43:12] is like I'm like impressed you know like
[43:15] I'm like this is my Elder not like super
[43:18] right but I mean like like he's been a
[43:21] pastor for so long you know I'm standing
[43:24] behind his pull pit you know like
[43:26] there's some differences here you know
[43:28] he can quote the message and con
[43:30] conversation like nobody's business you
[43:32] know and I'm like I mean I know the
[43:35] message but I just can't quite you know
[43:37] it's uh wow you know you know and yet
[43:41] when I when I call him up on the phone
[43:43] you know he's like hey buddy and I'm
[43:45] like like really like I'm I'm at buddy
[43:50] status like this is awesome you know cuz
[43:53] like cuz I you know cuz that little
[43:56] little boy inside you know is is still
[43:58] like wow how could How could a brother
[44:00] like this consider me like a peer like
[44:03] just like one of his buddies and his
[44:05] friend and but I think that that is just
[44:08] indicative and that's just me being
[44:09] super vulnerable and it's indicative of
[44:12] you know what this song I think was
[44:13] saying is that is that there's that
[44:16] small person on the inside of all of us
[44:17] that we just have to run to our father
[44:20] sometimes because the uncertainty that
[44:23] we Face the we don't know what it is and
[44:26] we don't always have it all under
[44:27] control and we don't always and it's I
[44:29] don't know sometimes but Lord I'm just
[44:31] going to run to you because I know that
[44:33] you can take care of the problems amen
[44:35] so anyway so that's just kind of how
[44:39] that song just uh speaks to me is that I
[44:43] I I don't I'd like to project that I'm
[44:46] somebody big and important and have it
[44:48] all together but and that's that's just
[44:50] not the case right amen so I'm I'm just
[44:54] thankful that that I have a father I can
[44:56] run to
[44:58] amen all right
[45:03] so all right so go ahead and stand with
[45:06] me if you would I've been told some of
[45:08] you didn't remember your Bibles so I do
[45:11] have it on this
[45:12] lines so um if you would like to turn to
[45:15] Genesis chapter 2 and verse 18 those of
[45:17] you that were here this morning should
[45:19] be very familiar with this passage and
[45:22] the other thing I was going to mention
[45:23] is is um is the ritual that Pastor do
[45:26] and you all think that perhaps it has
[45:29] something to do with like oh we just oh
[45:31] it's so wonderful we acknowledge all the
[45:32] ministers in our midst and that's that's
[45:34] lovely and and it's really really has
[45:37] nothing to do with them it's a hazing
[45:39] ritual that we do um to the minister
[45:41] who's about to come up it's like oh
[45:43] let's point out all the ministers in the
[45:45] congregation that are going to be
[45:47] judging the next guy who's about to come
[45:49] up here it's not intimidating at all I
[45:52] preach for
[45:53] brother I preach for brother um
[45:56] Scott Smith in in uh in
[45:59] Lenor North
[46:01] Carolina um and
[46:04] um and I didn't know anybody there I had
[46:06] never even met Brother Scott before he
[46:08] called me and said yeah I've heard good
[46:09] things so why don't you come on down and
[46:11] I was like okay that's that's amazing
[46:13] and wonderful but praise the Lord I'm
[46:16] I'm in um and uh and then he proceeded
[46:19] to get up and it kind of special meeting
[46:21] so he I mean I was like look who's not a
[46:25] minister in the congregation would have
[46:26] been a shorter list you know and I knew
[46:28] no one and I was just like oh this is
[46:31] help us Lord why is my timer there okay
[46:36] all right so Genesis Chapter 2 Verse 18
[46:39] we've got the slides praise the Lord so
[46:42] and the Lord God said it is not good
[46:45] that man should be alone I will make him
[46:48] and help meet for
[46:51] him um I'd like to just talk on the
[46:54] topic of loneliness
[46:56] this morning we talked about
[46:58] alone and and don't worry this sermon
[47:02] will stand on its own if you need
[47:04] anything from this morning service I
[47:06] will bring it back in so don't worry
[47:08] about that but we talked about alone
[47:09] this morning so we want to look at
[47:11] loneliness this evening can we just go
[47:14] to the Lord in prayer father um your
[47:16] scripture is still speaking to us Lord
[47:18] there's so many truths that we can
[47:20] extract out of each and every line Lord
[47:23] and I pray that tonight you would do
[47:24] that again Lord as we look looked at it
[47:26] from one angle um this morning I pray
[47:29] that you would uh bring out the context
[47:31] of this from a different angle Lord
[47:34] Jesus and that Lord that this would be a
[47:36] help to people that they would see you
[47:37] in a greater way Lord God and that we
[47:40] would look and find in you Lord that sum
[47:43] total of all satisfaction is in you Lord
[47:46] God and so father we're looking for that
[47:48] we pray that you would Minister to the
[47:50] hearts of the people and just use me
[47:52] Lord to speak in the name of the Lord
[47:54] Jesus Christ I pray amen amen and you
[47:56] may be
[48:00] seated so I'm happy to be here again
[48:05] and we had a really good time a year ago
[48:09] and preached on um finding the will of
[48:11] the Lord and um I I thought I did a
[48:15] terrible job but everybody said seemed
[48:17] to be blessed by it so um well praise
[48:19] the
[48:20] Lord you guys don't need much I guess
[48:23] and just say say the things the Lord
[48:26] wants you to say and it doesn't have to
[48:27] be smooth okay well thank you I
[48:31] appreciate that so so this morning we
[48:34] talked about this and and I just want to
[48:37] kind of bring this back in really
[48:38] quickly to set the stage but we talked
[48:41] about how this scripture was is is
[48:44] really that the rest of scripture is
[48:47] predicated upon this right here because
[48:50] we have creation and creation had a
[48:52] purpose and what was what was Genesis
[48:55] 1:1 one in the beginning God created the
[48:57] heavens and the Earth and we can say
[48:58] well why why did he do that and so if
[49:01] you can look and you begin to see that
[49:03] you know as I said this morning God
[49:04] didn't stop at kangaroos you know if God
[49:07] would have stopped at kangaroos you
[49:08] would have meant like apparently the
[49:09] point of creation was kangaroos God
[49:12] wanted something but God didn't stop at
[49:14] kangaroos he created all of this and
[49:15] when he got to man that is when he
[49:18] stopped creating which indicates to us
[49:21] that he had finally finished what he had
[49:24] started to do that the that the reason
[49:26] for and then he gives man dominion over
[49:28] the Kangaroos and everything else right
[49:31] so so so the point of all of that was
[49:34] that man would be there and then he says
[49:37] wow you know what it's good that man
[49:41] shouldn't be alone and I asked the
[49:43] question it's like how does God know
[49:45] this and it's more than just God well he
[49:48] he ran the scenarios and he realized
[49:50] that it'd be better that you know man
[49:52] had somebody to be with because you know
[49:54] 100 Years of him being alone we
[49:56] understood this through for knowledge
[49:57] and I realized you know he was lonely
[49:59] and so it'd be better if he had someone
[50:01] he he knew it more than just that he
[50:03] knew it more than just because he's God
[50:05] and he knows stuff like that but he knew
[50:07] it because he could because he created
[50:10] man in his own image and he knew that he
[50:13] he if he created to express attributes
[50:16] that he could be made known and to know
[50:20] then then Man created on the same
[50:22] grounds also wanted those to know and to
[50:26] be made known and this morning we talked
[50:29] about the expression and how to make
[50:31] yourself known is to express yourself in
[50:34] the same way that God himself expressed
[50:37] himself and so so we see this scripture
[50:40] that it's it's not good that man should
[50:42] be alone and and so but I want to look
[50:45] at this from a slightly from this topic
[50:48] of now
[50:49] loneliness and we're going to look at
[50:50] the differences because just merely
[50:52] being alone doesn't mean you're lonely
[50:57] is that okay all right so so I want to
[51:01] ask for a moment you know before God
[51:03] created everything was he
[51:08] lonely it's a fun
[51:11] question you know the answer brother
[51:13] Trevor not
[51:16] really I I don't was he lonely like I
[51:20] well he wanted to have
[51:22] Fellowship so then there must have been
[51:24] a desire in there now we look at now now
[51:28] this is something that we we're we're
[51:29] going to get into and I don't want to
[51:31] you know sell the point too early but
[51:33] but what you know loneliness as we look
[51:35] at that like what is that what how is
[51:38] that see but but we want to recognize
[51:40] it's not always a negative we look at
[51:43] loneliness always in the negative it's
[51:45] the the one of the worst things in the
[51:47] world is loneliness and hey I'm not
[51:50] disagreeing with that at all but what
[51:52] causes loneliness from what desires
[51:55] within you is is is loneliness uh being
[51:59] expressed out of okay so God had the
[52:02] desire in him to to make himself known
[52:07] and to be known so there was a desire
[52:10] there that you could say maybe wouldn't
[52:13] got all the way to the to what we would
[52:15] call loneliness but God no longer wanted
[52:18] to be alone so I'm not saying that he
[52:21] was sitting in the corner and rocking
[52:23] back and forth I'm so lonely no one
[52:25] likes me it's like well well Lord there
[52:28] is no one else
[52:30] right so if you created someone maybe
[52:35] you'd have some people to like you right
[52:38] so so so God I'm not saying that God was
[52:40] doing that but what I'm saying is
[52:42] there's a desire in God to not be alone
[52:47] and he wanted the fellowship so he
[52:49] creates man you know and and and it's
[52:52] it's not like it's not like what is
[52:54] loneliness a bit more like it's not just
[52:57] that you know there's people around
[52:59] right because God could have just you
[53:01] know God had created
[53:05] angels you know God could have just
[53:07] created a bunch of adoring
[53:09] fans oh God you're so
[53:12] amazing you know it's like would you
[53:14] guys like this we don't know but you're
[53:16] so amazing God you know and they and
[53:18] they were and and and if God would have
[53:19] created you know people to just to just
[53:22] automatically be there and worship him
[53:24] and tell him how awesome he was and
[53:25] every he wouldn't have been alone would
[53:27] he
[53:29] have but even though he wouldn't have
[53:31] been alone do you think that that well
[53:35] it couldn't have because he didn't just
[53:37] create you know adoring fans he created
[53:40] people on the basis of free moral agency
[53:43] who could choose him and so if he did
[53:46] that then it was more than just having
[53:48] more people there to you know be around
[53:51] but it was that there was something that
[53:53] that was doing that was satisfying a
[53:56] desire on the inside so God doesn't
[53:59] merely create to have humans there to
[54:02] have adoring fans but he creates man in
[54:05] his own image like him right so that so
[54:10] that the response of the way God would
[54:13] respond to his own self would be there
[54:17] woo that's a now we just suddenly got
[54:19] real deep now but you know you
[54:21] understand where we're going now is that
[54:23] in order to satisfy that desire for that
[54:26] kind of Fellowship it was more than just
[54:28] beings being there but it was someone
[54:31] that could satisfy the relationship that
[54:34] God was looking for that there was a
[54:37] there was a and and we understand it as
[54:39] a deep to and a deep to respond to a
[54:42] deep right and we we think of that
[54:44] always from our perspective you know is
[54:46] that Lord there's something in me
[54:48] Desiring and I'm calling out after you
[54:51] and brother Bram says if there's a deep
[54:53] there there's a deep to respond well
[54:55] okay flip that
[54:59] now right it was it was a deep
[55:02] responding to a deep it was a desire
[55:04] that is like a well that it that wants
[55:06] to draw in and what responds to that the
[55:09] same desire that's like a well that
[55:12] wants to draw in so both want to draw in
[55:15] but both give out to themselves and I I
[55:18] think that you know God didn't say you
[55:19] know it was a deep and then there was
[55:21] there was there was a a a water trough
[55:24] to respond to the to the well that you
[55:27] had that was empty that's not what
[55:29] that's not what he said it was a deep it
[55:31] was a drawing sensation a desire of
[55:34] pulling that that responded to a desire
[55:37] of pulling so it's the same on both
[55:39] sides it's not there's there's a thing
[55:41] that needs something and here's the
[55:42] thing that has
[55:44] something both need and both have
[55:50] woo so so this is turning out very
[55:53] different than I was thinking okay so we
[55:55] need more than it's more than just
[55:57] people it's more than just people around
[56:00] it's more than just beings there but
[56:03] it's be it's it's those who have inside
[56:05] of them the qualities that can satisfy
[56:09] that need for fellowship and that need
[56:11] for
[56:12] connectedness and this is what God has
[56:15] created you and I for is to have that
[56:19] connectedness from him and with
[56:22] him all right so he he decides I'm going
[56:26] to give Adam a help meat someone who can
[56:30] someone because God God is Supernatural
[56:34] and God is in spirit and you know we
[56:36] know God will Express all of his
[56:38] characters into Jesus Christ and that
[56:40] that is going to come but at this point
[56:42] in time God there is is spirit and he's
[56:45] he he's a logos so he's knowable but yet
[56:48] he's not there in flesh and so so in
[56:52] order to teach man about himself self he
[56:55] creates he puts the world here and he
[56:58] creates the situations and he gives us
[57:00] the words that we might learn to know
[57:06] him that's what is this if it's not
[57:09] about getting to know him you know what
[57:12] is this if it is not getting to getting
[57:16] to know his
[57:17] Doctrine no I mean yes but the but what
[57:23] like take the next step
[57:25] the doctrine is to know
[57:27] him right I mean we talked about we
[57:31] talked about no eternal hell this is
[57:32] message Doctrine this morning the whole
[57:35] idea of no eternal hell is to show is
[57:38] merely to show it's not punishment it's
[57:40] relationship it's have you chose the
[57:42] relationship or haven't you so the
[57:45] doctrine is to show him so so what he's
[57:47] doing is he's placing man here on Earth
[57:50] and he's now he's he's setting up he's
[57:53] setting up the architecture and as we
[57:55] said he's even allowing for evil so that
[57:57] his great love can be expressed to its
[58:00] full fullest extent because without sin
[58:03] and everybody's perfect everybody's just
[58:05] easy to love and now love isn't known
[58:07] the way it could be known and so he
[58:10] allows for evil so that you can you you
[58:12] now can experience the great love of God
[58:15] to love someone who's unlovable because
[58:17] we recognize you know in the Garden of
[58:20] Eden they what they understood before
[58:22] the fall was that God loves those that
[58:25] are
[58:27] perfect I mean they didn't really know
[58:29] what perfect
[58:30] meant CU they didn't have the
[58:33] contrast but then the contrast comes and
[58:36] now they learn that God loves more than
[58:38] just the
[58:39] perfect that that God's love is so great
[58:41] it can love those who are imperfect am I
[58:44] talking to someone tonight now God loves
[58:47] those that are imperfect how many are
[58:49] imperfect how many know that God loves
[58:52] them despite of their imperfection
[58:55] it's actually what what what you are
[58:57] doing is literally manifesting the way
[59:00] that God might be able to make his great
[59:03] love
[59:03] [Applause]
[59:05] known and you're you're part of that and
[59:08] so God God wants to express that and so
[59:11] God wanting us to learn who he is
[59:14] wanting us to learn the relationship
[59:16] with him puts man and he says you know
[59:18] what if I don't give Adam a helpmate if
[59:22] I don't I've made him like me but like
[59:25] me means I made someone I wanted
[59:28] Fellowship I need Adam to understand how
[59:32] I feel about him so I'm going to create
[59:35] a bride for him taken from his very his
[59:39] very elements from his everything about
[59:42] him he he's taking the like the little
[59:44] spoonful of the ocean out of Adam all
[59:47] the qualities that are there and from
[59:49] his side he takes those qualities and he
[59:52] puts them in a bride so that he can show
[59:55] Adam this is the desire I have with you
[59:58] I want you to experience this because
[1:00:01] this is a type of what I want with you
[1:00:04] and the desires that you're feeling I
[1:00:06] want you to understand those I want you
[1:00:08] to grow in love for this woman because
[1:00:12] and I want her to grow in love with you
[1:00:14] and I want I want you guys to understand
[1:00:16] and to meet the friendship and the
[1:00:18] fellowship and the love desires that you
[1:00:21] have with one another because I want you
[1:00:23] to understand in the Physical Realm the
[1:00:26] spiritual type the spiritual and
[1:00:29] Supernatural relationship that I want
[1:00:32] with
[1:00:33] you prise the Lord so there's a natural
[1:00:38] manifestation of a
[1:00:41] spiritual
[1:00:44] truth so so so
[1:00:47] then in one
[1:00:50] sense to have a person that is your
[1:00:54] spouse
[1:00:56] is to cure
[1:00:57] loneliness is to show what loneliness is
[1:01:01] and isn't and in another sense it is not
[1:01:05] because it is not merely that because
[1:01:08] look look here's the thing if Eve would
[1:01:10] have solved Adam's
[1:01:13] loneliness and she would have perfectly
[1:01:15] solved that would Adam ever have said
[1:01:18] well but there's still something in me
[1:01:22] that's calling out Hallelujah there
[1:01:24] still a deep here all we both had deeps
[1:01:28] but there's a deep that both of us now
[1:01:30] have that's still calling out for more
[1:01:33] and if that relationship would have
[1:01:35] solved that then then then then Adam not
[1:01:38] would not have Adam just wouldn't have
[1:01:40] met like well you know I've got Eve I'm
[1:01:43] good thank you God that was nice of you
[1:01:45] to provide her we're happy now
[1:01:48] appreciate that don't need you
[1:01:52] anymore I am so satiated in my desire
[1:01:56] that I've had that because you've given
[1:01:59] me Eve that God I I just there's there's
[1:02:01] there's no room left for you God I I I I
[1:02:04] just hardly desire you
[1:02:08] anymore is that possible
[1:02:12] no
[1:02:18] no there's lots of jokes that could go
[1:02:20] there but we're going to leave those
[1:02:21] alone we're going to go on loneliness
[1:02:25] Hebrews chapter 6 number three brother
[1:02:26] brandom says' oh the grace of God that
[1:02:29] changed this nature give me the
[1:02:30] opportunity to desire the
[1:02:34] opportunity to desire and to Crave and
[1:02:38] to thirst thy love kindness is better to
[1:02:42] me than life oh God my heart will long
[1:02:46] after thee David said as the heart
[1:02:49] panteth for the water book so my soul
[1:02:51] thirsts after thee Oh God God gave man
[1:02:55] that
[1:02:57] thirst to worship him to love and seek
[1:03:03] after him but man perverts it by the
[1:03:06] call of the devil and he goes in lusts
[1:03:08] after women and pleasures and things of
[1:03:10] the world trying to
[1:03:12] satisfy that Holy
[1:03:15] creation that God has put in to love him
[1:03:21] you see the desire within you that is
[1:03:24] the deep that is calling out for more
[1:03:27] than what is in you is a holy creation
[1:03:32] that God has put there can I say it this
[1:03:36] way to make it very plain that the the
[1:03:39] desire that you have that turns into
[1:03:42] loneliness if not dealt with
[1:03:45] appropriately is and and and again we
[1:03:48] think loneliness we think oh that's
[1:03:50] terrible it's bad it's one of the worst
[1:03:51] things ever and and and of course but
[1:03:54] but the desire that caused that
[1:03:56] loneliness is a holy creation that God
[1:04:00] put in there to love him he places it
[1:04:03] upon the things of the world but brother
[1:04:04] once he's
[1:04:06] changed that fountain with Wiggle tailes
[1:04:08] all kinds of disorders of the sistern
[1:04:10] has been cleansed out and sterilized and
[1:04:13] the pure water of God is put in there
[1:04:16] sin can never touch
[1:04:20] it all right so what is the fountain the
[1:04:24] the the the fountain here that's calling
[1:04:26] out for the Waters of God it is this
[1:04:29] well inside of you that God placed there
[1:04:32] a desire within you that is that is
[1:04:35] there and it is wanting to receive
[1:04:37] something it is Desiring and calling out
[1:04:40] to receive something and God has the
[1:04:43] water to put in to put in there and you
[1:04:46] have the water to put into God and so so
[1:04:50] so so what we're looking for is we're
[1:04:53] looking for God to be the ultimate
[1:04:56] satisfaction of all of these desires
[1:04:59] that we have in our lives amen now now
[1:05:04] now that's a powerful statement but it's
[1:05:06] kind of like we it's like we brother
[1:05:08] Trevor um Christians like I think
[1:05:11] everybody in here is a Christian and we
[1:05:13] should basically get that concept that
[1:05:15] God satisfies
[1:05:18] everything amen we're together on that
[1:05:21] okay that's good so then I I guess I
[1:05:22] don't have to preach this I don't know
[1:05:24] what I'm doing but but what is what is
[1:05:26] sin then sin in our lives is is a
[1:05:29] manifestation of unbelief we know that
[1:05:31] but what what is the unbelief that that
[1:05:34] is there the unbelief ultimately is is
[1:05:37] that you do not believe that God or you
[1:05:39] do not act in a way that says you
[1:05:43] believe that God is the ultimate
[1:05:46] satisfaction of the desires on the
[1:05:49] inside of your heart because if you
[1:05:51] don't believe that not only in know know
[1:05:54] form but truly on the inside of you to
[1:05:57] say like look I recognize I I'm feeling
[1:06:00] this way I have a desire that I want to
[1:06:03] fill and but I'm just not it's yeah but
[1:06:06] there's things over here that I'm pretty
[1:06:08] sure are going to satisfy that you
[1:06:13] know I mean have you ridden roller
[1:06:18] coasters
[1:06:22] thrilling you know but brother brandom
[1:06:24] said I think that ought to be the thrill
[1:06:26] of the church is for man to pray until
[1:06:29] he gets into the presence of God so so I
[1:06:32] mean when's the last time you prayed and
[1:06:34] got yourself into the presence of God
[1:06:36] that your heart rate came up as much as
[1:06:38] going 80 M an hour straight
[1:06:41] down
[1:06:44] yeah I can see it may be a little bit
[1:06:47] different in
[1:06:48] application but it has it been thrilling
[1:06:51] to
[1:06:53] you
[1:06:55] has it been something that you sought
[1:06:56] after I'm I'm I man I just I just have a
[1:06:59] penchant for a little bit of thrill and
[1:07:01] a little bit of action today so you know
[1:07:03] what I'm going to do I'm going to
[1:07:10] pray and I hate to throw this after this
[1:07:13] but said no one ever right I mean like
[1:07:17] should have said yes did probably
[1:07:21] not If we're
[1:07:22] honest are we are we doing that and so
[1:07:25] so so what is sin see see that's what
[1:07:28] that's what the the God has put desires
[1:07:31] on the inside of us it's a holy desire
[1:07:34] that must be there because if we didn't
[1:07:36] have it we wouldn't desire after God but
[1:07:39] what sin is is sin is coming and trying
[1:07:41] to replace the Fulfillment of that
[1:07:44] desire with anything but the one who
[1:07:46] created himself to be the Fulfillment of
[1:07:49] that desire and so when we go after
[1:07:51] things of the world or even good things
[1:07:54] in our lives and put them and want them
[1:07:57] to be the source of our fulfillment
[1:08:00] we've got problems mothers have have
[1:08:03] dealt with this many many times because
[1:08:05] mothers have felt like if I have
[1:08:07] children and I can raise children in the
[1:08:10] in the admonition of God then I will
[1:08:12] feel fulfilled and they've left and
[1:08:14] they've grow their children have been
[1:08:15] raised and they're like but I don't feel
[1:08:17] the Fulfillment that I thought I'd feel
[1:08:20] and it's because they replaced maybe a
[1:08:22] Godly thing to raise your children in
[1:08:24] the admonition of God but they've but
[1:08:26] they've wanted the the act of doing that
[1:08:30] to be the Fulfillment in their life and
[1:08:32] they've they've been found empty because
[1:08:35] they ow they put that as an idol above
[1:08:38] their relationship with God being the
[1:08:40] thing that satisfies the hunger of their
[1:08:43] hearts all right so so but God is the
[1:08:47] pure water and when it gets in there sin
[1:08:50] can't touch it and when I'm talking
[1:08:52] about Sin here I'm not talking about the
[1:08:54] filthy things of the world but I'm
[1:08:57] talking about anything that is the
[1:08:59] replacement of of of the the
[1:09:02] satisfaction that we can receive from
[1:09:05] being in the presence of God from
[1:09:07] knowing the word of God from believing
[1:09:10] that he is who he says he is and is
[1:09:12] longing for us and wants to be there to
[1:09:16] satisfy that every
[1:09:19] desire
[1:09:21] amen so I was a little worried we were
[1:09:25] at dinner the other day and I you know
[1:09:27] mentioned my title to brother Samuel and
[1:09:29] he's like oh and brother Barry was here
[1:09:30] in March he talked about you know being
[1:09:33] alone you know never being alone and I
[1:09:35] was like
[1:09:39] really really so I'm just going to
[1:09:42] repeat everything brother Barry said
[1:09:43] that's nice that's really good
[1:09:44] everybody's just going to know like oh
[1:09:46] he's a brother Barry clone he's
[1:09:50] just so I listened to his sermon and it
[1:09:54] was nothing like
[1:09:57] this but he did say something that I'll
[1:10:00] I'll I'll call your attention back to
[1:10:02] and I believe he may have said it again
[1:10:04] at winter youth retreat and maybe many
[1:10:05] of you young people were there but but
[1:10:07] he said we shouldn't feel bad for
[1:10:08] feeling
[1:10:10] bad and the reason and the reason that's
[1:10:13] true is because inside of you God put
[1:10:16] that desire and it is a holy thing that
[1:10:19] he did so you are going to have times
[1:10:24] and praise God you'll have times where
[1:10:27] you are feeling
[1:10:32] unsatisfied now I get I get it that it's
[1:10:35] not your standard fair for preaching
[1:10:37] these days but you're going to have
[1:10:39] these
[1:10:40] times but that can be a good thing if if
[1:10:44] it's motivating you in the right
[1:10:47] direction what those things are saying
[1:10:49] is is that maybe God is there feeling
[1:10:53] that that the Deep that's over there the
[1:10:55] deep that you have is just feeling a
[1:10:57] little empty right now and maybe the
[1:11:00] Deep that's up there is saying you know
[1:11:02] what I'm feeling just a little empty and
[1:11:04] if we can get the two together my we're
[1:11:07] going to have
[1:11:09] something so so it's so that see what we
[1:11:12] have to understand is is that desire we
[1:11:15] shouldn't you you don't have to feel bad
[1:11:17] for having the desire God put the desire
[1:11:20] there what that desire should and those
[1:11:22] feelings should begin to do is to begin
[1:11:25] to push you in the direction of the
[1:11:28] answer and the satisfaction of
[1:11:32] it
[1:11:36] amen so in Psalm 25:16 David says turn
[1:11:39] unto turn thee unto me and have mercy
[1:11:42] upon me for I am desolate or sometimes
[1:11:45] rendered lonely and
[1:11:48] Afflicted so David
[1:11:51] himself is crying out to God now we
[1:11:54] recognize he's going to the right Source
[1:11:57] but I want us to understand look at his
[1:12:00] language I am desolate I God right now I
[1:12:04] am in a dry place I'm desolate God I
[1:12:08] feel lonely and Afflicted right now
[1:12:18] God didn't know David was such a
[1:12:21] sinner such a lame believer
[1:12:25] no he was
[1:12:27] human like you and I like these Heroes
[1:12:30] of the
[1:12:31] faith were they that different were they
[1:12:35] that
[1:12:37] different you know maybe you're having a
[1:12:40] time like Joseph where you're in you're
[1:12:42] in prisoned you can look and and
[1:12:44] recognize what God has said it's like
[1:12:46] yeah but I mean you if I was in prison
[1:12:48] right now I mean I'm not Joseph so
[1:12:51] there's no way I could respond respond
[1:12:53] in the same
[1:12:55] way why because Joseph was just written
[1:12:57] about in the Bible and that somehow
[1:12:58] makes him
[1:13:00] elevated these were real people lived on
[1:13:04] the same Earth that you and I do they
[1:13:06] were no
[1:13:10] different so if David can say I am
[1:13:12] desolate lonely and Afflicted hey you
[1:13:15] think you'll never be that way you think
[1:13:18] you'll never feel that way it's all
[1:13:20] right but at least David is going and he
[1:13:23] he's recognizing if I'm feeling this way
[1:13:25] I have to turn I have to go this way now
[1:13:28] there are times that David did not turn
[1:13:29] that
[1:13:33] direction Psalm 63:1 a Psalm of David
[1:13:36] when he was in the wilderness of Judah
[1:13:37] oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek
[1:13:41] thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[1:13:44] longth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[1:13:47] land where no water is and I just love
[1:13:51] to think about this from the poetic
[1:13:52] element you know is that here David is
[1:13:55] he's expressing this in song He's
[1:13:57] expressing this in Poetic language you
[1:13:59] know it's it's not it's he's not just
[1:14:02] saying Lord I'm sitting here in the
[1:14:04] middle of a Sandy dry desert and I'm
[1:14:05] longing for
[1:14:08] you it's too bad I don't have a bottle
[1:14:10] of water if I had a bottle of water this
[1:14:12] Psalm would be different because then I
[1:14:14] wouldn't be so
[1:14:16] dry
[1:14:18] it's look half the songs we sing have
[1:14:21] poetic language like this that we that
[1:14:22] we that we interpret far differently
[1:14:24] than that right so David is saying look
[1:14:27] look Lord I am right now I am in a place
[1:14:30] God not not in a physical place but God
[1:14:33] you know I'm just we we have the
[1:14:34] expression you know he was in a really
[1:14:36] dark place it's like that doesn't mean
[1:14:38] he was in a basement with the lights off
[1:14:40] does it right so David David is in a
[1:14:43] place he's like God right now I am in a
[1:14:45] dry and thirsty land I'm in a season
[1:14:48] right now God where I feel dry I feel
[1:14:50] like I there's something that isn't good
[1:14:53] that I I I need water God I can tell
[1:14:56] Lord I I when people come I react a
[1:14:58] little oh I've got some edges God that
[1:15:00] need some sanding down to make them a
[1:15:02] little soft but you know and our our
[1:15:04] pastor preached the other day about you
[1:15:06] know a cactus is just you know it was a
[1:15:08] it was a nice plant that was a soft
[1:15:10] plant that just didn't have water for
[1:15:12] very very long and then the leaves
[1:15:14] twisted up and dried up and shriveled up
[1:15:16] to a
[1:15:19] point and sometimes we get Lord I am in
[1:15:22] a dry place and when people come around
[1:15:24] me they are getting
[1:15:27] pricked and I don't want to be that way
[1:15:29] Lord I need some water God and so David
[1:15:34] though but look at the response of David
[1:15:36] David though he recognizes exactly where
[1:15:39] he is and but he's saying but God so I
[1:15:42] know I've recognized Lord I need to get
[1:15:44] up a little
[1:15:47] earlier and seek
[1:15:50] you my soul has got to thirst first
[1:15:53] after you oh God my flesh oh God has to
[1:15:59] long after you instead of all of the
[1:16:02] other things that my flesh could long
[1:16:04] for oh God I I need my flesh to long
[1:16:08] after you I need all of me to long after
[1:16:11] you oh God because right now my soul is
[1:16:14] just thirsty I've got to have more oh
[1:16:17] God so so though there's a Triumph in
[1:16:20] here he's like oh God Thou Art my God
[1:16:23] early will I seek thee and we look at
[1:16:25] that and we think my look at this man
[1:16:27] David this is a man who knows the source
[1:16:30] of everything that he needs and he's
[1:16:33] going to that man but we don't often
[1:16:35] look at the fact that David but he was a
[1:16:38] man who needed
[1:16:42] stuff and and we've got to we've got to
[1:16:44] recognize sometimes when we're sitting
[1:16:46] there and we need something we can have
[1:16:49] the same reaction as David and and and
[1:16:52] instead of you know get in a little
[1:16:53] corner and feel sorry for oursel but yet
[1:16:56] we can recognize God you are my
[1:17:00] God it's it's okay I don't have I don't
[1:17:03] have to I know the
[1:17:05] source I'm a little prickly but I know
[1:17:08] the source there's a deep that's calling
[1:17:11] but I know the
[1:17:18] source
[1:17:20] amen so what is the answer then to
[1:17:23] loneliness
[1:17:27] well
[1:17:31] God
[1:17:33] yes amen so John 16:32 and3 I'll just
[1:17:37] leave that there for a bit behold the
[1:17:38] hour cometh yay and is now come that ye
[1:17:41] shall be scattered every man to his own
[1:17:45] and shall leave me alone this is Jesus
[1:17:47] talking to the disciples before before
[1:17:49] he he's there and uh before the
[1:17:52] crucifixion and and he says and yet I am
[1:17:55] not
[1:17:57] alone Lord because the father is with
[1:18:01] me I am not alone though physically he
[1:18:05] he became
[1:18:06] alone but the father be uh because the
[1:18:09] father is with
[1:18:11] me these things have I spoken unto you
[1:18:16] that ye might have peace Amen in the
[1:18:20] world ye shall have tribulation but be
[1:18:23] of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:18:27] world so he spoke to them and said look
[1:18:31] there's going to come a time when you're
[1:18:32] going to leave me there's coming a time
[1:18:34] when I am myself am going to be alone
[1:18:38] though I am God in flesh I am going to
[1:18:41] be alone but yet I will not be alone
[1:18:44] because the father is always with me
[1:18:47] these things these things have I spoken
[1:18:50] to you that you might have peace because
[1:18:53] there's going to be times when all men
[1:18:56] will leave you and you will be alone you
[1:18:59] will be in a dark place you will be in a
[1:19:02] dry and thirsty land and you will you'll
[1:19:05] look around and say but no one is with
[1:19:07] me all around I see Roman soldiers and
[1:19:10] Sanhedrin members accusing me but yet I
[1:19:14] have told you so that you could have
[1:19:16] peace you will not be alone because the
[1:19:20] father will be with you
[1:19:25] amen so just like Jesus here we are as
[1:19:29] being expressions of who he was we we we
[1:19:33] exist by by a new birth on the same
[1:19:35] playing field on the same same plane in
[1:19:38] in existence as Jesus Christ himself
[1:19:41] because we have the life of
[1:19:43] God the literal life of God is living
[1:19:47] inside of our being when you have a new
[1:19:51] birth all right the the difference is
[1:19:54] you don't have perfect flesh like he did
[1:19:56] but otherwise you have the same
[1:19:59] life so you can have the same things the
[1:20:03] same desires the same connection with
[1:20:05] the father yourself that you can have
[1:20:08] and he spoke these things and showed you
[1:20:10] these things that you could have peace
[1:20:13] in those times it won't be fun it won't
[1:20:16] be it won't be a you know just a walk in
[1:20:19] the park no it was a it was a walk down
[1:20:21] to the judgment
[1:20:24] all but you wouldn't be
[1:20:28] alone
[1:20:31] thank so how do we cure
[1:20:37] loneliness have
[1:20:41] God
[1:20:45] Amen we don't worry we're going to break
[1:20:47] it down more okay so but before we can
[1:20:51] like before we can answer what what's
[1:20:54] the cure look maybe we need to dive in
[1:20:57] and really understand what loneliness
[1:21:00] actually is is that all right and to to
[1:21:03] just take a pivot here and and and just
[1:21:05] ask a few questions and begin to look
[1:21:08] into this just a little bit and and so I
[1:21:10] I want to ask you this does loneliness
[1:21:13] rob you of
[1:21:18] Joy can
[1:21:20] loneliness and joy
[1:21:24] exist in the same
[1:21:29] person or is loneliness like let's just
[1:21:33] be real tonight I mean you had Brothers
[1:21:35] whever come preach like it's going to be
[1:21:36] that way
[1:21:38] so open thine heart because we're going
[1:21:40] to Dive Right In and you know start
[1:21:42] chopping
[1:21:45] so does does loneliness is loneliness a
[1:21:48] black hole of
[1:21:51] joy does it Rob if if if one is feeling
[1:21:55] lonely does it Rob you of all joy that
[1:21:59] you might have in your
[1:22:01] life because there are times when we
[1:22:04] feel that way don't we we feel like it
[1:22:07] is a black hole we feel like it is
[1:22:09] robbing all joy from me and I I'm I'm
[1:22:13] I'm powerless to to do anything I need
[1:22:16] someone I need something's got to come
[1:22:19] and change this for me and I would say
[1:22:22] well what is that
[1:22:24] thing right so so think through it think
[1:22:26] through one of the last times you've
[1:22:28] been lonely think one through one of the
[1:22:29] last times you were sitting there you
[1:22:30] were alone and you you were feeling
[1:22:32] feelings of loneliness and you certainly
[1:22:34] were like Joy is a very long way away
[1:22:36] from me and and and and what am I going
[1:22:38] to
[1:22:40] do and back in the back of your mind you
[1:22:42] were like well God has to do this but is
[1:22:45] that what you
[1:22:48] wanted come on you you you wanted god
[1:22:51] with skin on it as we say so often
[1:22:53] typically that's what we want is is we
[1:22:56] want god with skin on it to come and to
[1:22:58] take away the loneliness I need to be
[1:23:00] around people I need to I need someone
[1:23:03] to come and and but but but what we're
[1:23:05] actually saying is is I need someone to
[1:23:07] come and be God to me to to to to to
[1:23:11] take to take the place of God to satisfy
[1:23:15] the
[1:23:16] desires that I am feeling in my heart
[1:23:19] right now and there's no way I'll feel
[1:23:21] any Joy unless someone comes and does
[1:23:24] that or I have a nice pizza and go to
[1:23:27] bed sometimes that
[1:23:30] helps helps me sometimes okay you know
[1:23:33] hey I was 15 once too okay
[1:23:37] so but I think that's not a good way to
[1:23:40] look at it and I think we that's that's
[1:23:42] a product of the negativity that we've
[1:23:44] fallen into in those moments and we've
[1:23:47] allowed you know our we' have allowed
[1:23:49] that the devil to lie to us in those
[1:23:51] moments to say you can't you you this oh
[1:23:55] you're feeling
[1:23:56] lonely it can be no joy for you until
[1:24:00] the loneliness question is
[1:24:02] satisfied you are
[1:24:07] alone and there's nothing you can do
[1:24:10] about
[1:24:14] it I'm I'm look I'm human too I mean
[1:24:19] like how does he
[1:24:21] know
[1:24:24] it's happened to me
[1:24:28] right so so is loneliness merely the
[1:24:32] state of being alone of not having
[1:24:35] another individual in your life or
[1:24:36] individuals in your life is it more than
[1:24:39] just that because often that is so so so
[1:24:42] what we're what what I'm trying to
[1:24:44] present here is is our thoughts about
[1:24:47] loneliness and trying to get real um you
[1:24:49] know real deep and honest with our own
[1:24:51] lives to recognize that in those Seasons
[1:24:53] where we feel lonely what well we
[1:24:56] understand that God is the source and
[1:24:59] the the just the wonderful deep that can
[1:25:01] respond to that deep in our lives but
[1:25:04] yet when we're in those times of
[1:25:05] loneliness that is the farthest thing
[1:25:08] from our mind we we we we conceptually
[1:25:11] know that but we actually don't believe
[1:25:13] that and so I I want to take some time
[1:25:16] to just really look at that and and to
[1:25:18] understand our own our own selves a
[1:25:20] little bit more to see how you know and
[1:25:23] maybe debunk some of the you know the
[1:25:25] patterns that we get into where we try
[1:25:27] to solve the questions of loneliness and
[1:25:30] so so I would just like to ask um of the
[1:25:33] married people
[1:25:36] here well we won't ask you to raise your
[1:25:39] hands we don't want to cause
[1:25:41] problems but of the married people here
[1:25:44] and I'm going to just tell you you young
[1:25:46] people so that we don't cause marriage
[1:25:47] problems you're just going to have to
[1:25:48] believe the answer when I tell you that
[1:25:50] this is how everyone feels like has
[1:25:52] anyone you know been married and ever
[1:25:54] felt
[1:25:58] lonely hey people whose wives are not
[1:26:01] here um are answering in the
[1:26:08] affirmative
[1:26:10] marriage young people doesn't solve
[1:26:13] loneliness now it
[1:26:18] helps and this is why God created Eve
[1:26:22] from Adam and that's
[1:26:24] wonderful and that was
[1:26:27] helpful but it did not again it didn't
[1:26:30] if it solved that question if it solved
[1:26:32] that desire completely then man wouldn't
[1:26:35] continue to desire for God so so we have
[1:26:38] to understand this is an Avenue that God
[1:26:40] gave us to help with that to to be that
[1:26:44] this would be wonderful and and and
[1:26:46] amazing however the source but do not
[1:26:50] forget the source the source is him so
[1:26:55] if you can be married and and yet you
[1:26:57] know you look marriage doesn't cure
[1:26:59] loneliness you know if you have your
[1:27:01] spouse or your
[1:27:04] person
[1:27:05] your
[1:27:07] soulmate whatever modern phrase We want
[1:27:11] to use doesn't keep you from
[1:27:14] loneliness then what does keep you from
[1:27:16] loneliness well it's got to be more than
[1:27:18] just having someone else around and and
[1:27:21] so and we're going to talk about that a
[1:27:23] little bit but let's talk about some
[1:27:25] like like we we want things to be
[1:27:27] tangible right I mean we that's one of
[1:27:29] the things we that's as we talk about
[1:27:32] you know that's why when we say it's
[1:27:34] like well what solves loneliness and
[1:27:35] it's like God it's like we know the
[1:27:38] answer but then we want to talk about
[1:27:39] like how how does that work and the
[1:27:41] first thing that comes into our mind is
[1:27:43] like well if God would just have some
[1:27:45] skin on it and come into my life then
[1:27:47] that would then God would solve the
[1:27:48] loneliness in my life and well maybe
[1:27:51] that would help some and
[1:27:53] oh that was something outside I was like
[1:27:54] what in the world is a speaker
[1:27:57] doing and and so and so but that's some
[1:28:00] one of the things that we look for and
[1:28:01] and again like I recognize like we know
[1:28:03] that it's one of this like Sunday school
[1:28:04] all over again it's like it's like you
[1:28:06] all know the right answer and you can
[1:28:07] answer the right answer in church but
[1:28:08] then you go out and you live your life
[1:28:10] and your life isn't expressing the right
[1:28:12] answer right and so here's another one
[1:28:15] and we talked this morning we talked
[1:28:16] about video games and we talked about
[1:28:18] you know all of the so all of the you
[1:28:20] know psychological tricks in a video
[1:28:22] game and social medias and things like
[1:28:23] that you know you've got the thumbs up
[1:28:24] you've got the hearts you've got the i l
[1:28:27] Ys sm's you know people respond to one
[1:28:30] another I love you so much with three
[1:28:32] heart emojis and you know unless it's
[1:28:35] you know maybe I don't love them that
[1:28:36] much and then it's blue instead of red
[1:28:38] and you know all the tricks and things
[1:28:39] like that that we do you know and and
[1:28:41] then in video games you know you have
[1:28:43] achievement unlocked and what that is
[1:28:45] telling you is that you've actually done
[1:28:46] something worth doing and the video game
[1:28:48] is rewarding you and it has to do that
[1:28:50] to you because if it doesn't tell you
[1:28:51] that that you've unlocked an achievement
[1:28:53] and it hasn't if it hasn't told you
[1:28:54] you've done a good job you would have
[1:28:56] absolutely no idea that you had done a
[1:28:58] good job because you hadn't actually
[1:28:59] done anything yet except for moved you
[1:29:02] know white boxes into green boxes or
[1:29:04] something like that it's like coou
[1:29:05] you're amazing like achievement unlocked
[1:29:08] you can do the white boxes to the green
[1:29:09] boxes good that's so
[1:29:12] wonderful so they so so because they
[1:29:15] know that they have to they have to tell
[1:29:17] you you're amazing keep going and I'll
[1:29:20] tell you you're amazing again
[1:29:22] because there's absolutely no way that
[1:29:24] you could tell otherwise and so so so
[1:29:27] but yet but don't like but it
[1:29:35] works and it works on
[1:29:40] us who know that God is the answer to
[1:29:46] our loneliness that God is the answer to
[1:29:49] our desires but yet people can spend all
[1:29:53] kinds of money on psychological tricks
[1:29:56] through screens and try to emulate the
[1:29:59] feeling of hey you don't have to be you
[1:30:02] don't have to be
[1:30:04] lonely because your video game Clan is
[1:30:07] here for
[1:30:09] you you
[1:30:12] matter what would they do if you weren't
[1:30:14] there at
[1:30:17] 7:30 how could they achieve
[1:30:20] anything
[1:30:24] we don't know what they've achieved by
[1:30:25] 900 p.m. but you
[1:30:28] know but it's all feelings it's it's
[1:30:32] trying to satisfy that desire right and
[1:30:35] then in some ways it's even doing a good
[1:30:37] job of it because there's many people in
[1:30:39] in some ways because they continue to go
[1:30:41] back to that thing and if it didn't work
[1:30:43] at all they wouldn't go back to that
[1:30:45] thing except for all that it's doing is
[1:30:47] making them addicted to the thing that
[1:30:49] actually almost but never does solve the
[1:30:52] issue that's in their
[1:30:56] heart but yet it says it it it feels
[1:30:59] like I've done something it feels good
[1:31:01] it feels like I'm not lonely it feels
[1:31:04] like I'm matter to other people it it
[1:31:06] feels like I'm doing and that's what
[1:31:08] we're doing is we're gravitating towards
[1:31:10] the feelings of success and in in in a
[1:31:13] community
[1:31:16] sometimes but but what really is
[1:31:20] there so I I I what I'm really trying to
[1:31:23] bring out with this point here is that
[1:31:25] there are times that we go to places
[1:31:27] where people actually
[1:31:29] aren't like there's actually no physical
[1:31:32] people on your social media there's
[1:31:35] actually no physical people on your
[1:31:37] video games okay yes they're in another
[1:31:40] place but let's Also let's all let's all
[1:31:43] get real honest and understand that
[1:31:45] there's such thing as AI right now and
[1:31:47] then and it can approximate a human
[1:31:50] sometimes and and then there's also
[1:31:52] times when we say well that's a person
[1:31:53] on the other end yeah but you know it's
[1:31:55] a guy and it's not really a girl it's
[1:31:57] just pictures of a girl but there's a
[1:31:58] guy talking to you instead but yet you
[1:32:01] think you
[1:32:02] have it's solving loneliness and it's
[1:32:05] not even what it says it
[1:32:07] is and this works on plenty of
[1:32:15] people so we say well like look look
[1:32:18] brother Trevor what I'm trying to say is
[1:32:20] that I I I I I you know to solve my
[1:32:22] loneliness I need a real person near me
[1:32:25] to solve the problems that I have I I
[1:32:27] just I've just got to have this thing
[1:32:30] and and if I don't have that I I'll just
[1:32:31] always be lonely but what I'm telling
[1:32:33] you is actually in practice you don't
[1:32:35] even believe that and that's not even
[1:32:36] the answer but in practice you don't
[1:32:38] even believe that because there's plenty
[1:32:39] of other things that you do that are
[1:32:41] only human simulation but not actually
[1:32:44] humans there's nothing actually tangible
[1:32:46] there but yet you're you want to say to
[1:32:48] me like God isn't enough because he's
[1:32:50] not tangible need god with skin on it
[1:32:53] but then there are even things that you
[1:32:54] gravitate towards and want to have in
[1:32:56] your life to solve these problems that
[1:32:58] have no tangibility to them at all so
[1:33:01] where are you now I hope everyone
[1:33:04] followed that it was a little okay right
[1:33:06] okay good
[1:33:08] good so we preach and we agree and we
[1:33:11] knot our heads in church and we amen
[1:33:13] that Jesus is the only thing that can
[1:33:15] satisfy a Lonely Heart except for well
[1:33:17] we have the caveat that we want him to
[1:33:19] be with skin on it but yet
[1:33:23] we look after things we go for things
[1:33:25] that are not tangible and so even that
[1:33:29] we so actually what we're recognizing is
[1:33:32] that I actually do go for things to
[1:33:36] satisfy my loneliness that are
[1:33:39] intangible and I'm actually okay with
[1:33:42] that and so I just wanted to flip the
[1:33:44] script on the devil there for just a
[1:33:45] moment to recognize like hey just
[1:33:47] because we we we know God in the
[1:33:50] spiritual realm in some ways
[1:33:52] like and he's intangible in some
[1:33:56] ways that should be okay with every
[1:33:58] single one of us and we shouldn't make a
[1:34:01] dependency is the point that I'm trying
[1:34:03] to get to on god with skin on it and
[1:34:07] that we're being dishonest with
[1:34:08] ourselves if we well the devil's lying
[1:34:11] to us and we're believing that lie if
[1:34:13] we're saying the only way that I can
[1:34:14] cure you loneliness is through another
[1:34:16] person I've got to have this other
[1:34:17] person or or no these things I write
[1:34:20] into you that you would have peace all
[1:34:23] would leave me but I will not be alone
[1:34:25] because the father is with
[1:34:27] me though it was intangible for Jesus
[1:34:32] the
[1:34:33] man but yet even there were times where
[1:34:35] he
[1:34:36] left the fellowship of others and we'll
[1:34:39] talk about why that is here in the timer
[1:34:43] and on the time that we have left and
[1:34:44] and he left people and he left the
[1:34:46] humans he left the other people around
[1:34:48] that he could that that that had skin on
[1:34:50] them but yet he went me to not just to
[1:34:52] be alone but to find Solitude with with
[1:34:56] the
[1:34:57] father because that was the thing that
[1:35:00] had to satisfy him and we'll talk about
[1:35:02] what that is in just a moment now many
[1:35:04] of you may be familiar with the five
[1:35:06] love languages anyone five love language
[1:35:09] acts of service U physical touch um uh
[1:35:13] gifts um words of
[1:35:17] affirmation and quality time yeah and
[1:35:20] these are the five love Lang anges I
[1:35:21] think Gary Chapman is the author of the
[1:35:23] book and there's you know and then he
[1:35:24] decided he was making a lot of money so
[1:35:26] there's the five languages for men and
[1:35:27] the five languages love languages for
[1:35:28] women the five love languages for
[1:35:30] parents with kids um there was one
[1:35:32] helpful nugget in there but you know
[1:35:34] um and you know and then five love
[1:35:37] languages part two I don't know if that
[1:35:39] actually existed but he might as well
[1:35:40] have but anyway um five more love
[1:35:42] languages to confuse us all I don't
[1:35:47] know but I want to give you just kind of
[1:35:49] the general point if you're not if
[1:35:51] you're you're familiar with this this is
[1:35:52] a refresher but if you're not familiar
[1:35:53] with the five love languages is is is
[1:35:55] basically they they they they give you
[1:35:57] the they they tell they tell you that
[1:35:59] each of us has the has has the concept
[1:36:01] of a love tank and that love tank needs
[1:36:03] to be filled now a love tank that sounds
[1:36:05] like deep calling to the deep but anyway
[1:36:07] I don't know that they understood that
[1:36:08] but we do so hey praise God we do have a
[1:36:10] love tank and that's a deep that needs a
[1:36:12] deep to respond to it okay and so you
[1:36:14] have a love tank and your spouse has a
[1:36:16] love tank and you know and and you like
[1:36:18] receiving gifts and your spouse never
[1:36:21] gives you gifts how do you
[1:36:24] feel like if when people give you gifts
[1:36:27] you're like they love me I know they
[1:36:29] love me because they gave me a gift like
[1:36:31] to give a gift is expensive and it's
[1:36:33] like they love me and it just satisfies
[1:36:35] you and it fills up that love tank
[1:36:37] because you you have the the language
[1:36:39] you speak the language of gifts and and
[1:36:43] so and but what if your spouse never
[1:36:45] gives you gifts then you're
[1:36:49] like she doesn't love me he doesn't love
[1:36:52] me I never get I never get a I give them
[1:36:54] gifts all the time and I never get one
[1:36:57] back they don't love me and the spouse
[1:37:00] is sitting there going are you yeah how
[1:37:03] can I love you anymore than I Poss than
[1:37:05] I do right now it's just like I don't
[1:37:07] understand why you don't get it it's
[1:37:09] because you're not speaking the right
[1:37:11] language just buy the gift and then your
[1:37:14] spouse is like oh you do love me and
[1:37:15] it's like you have got to be kidding me
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:19] now that's what it took and so you begin
[1:37:23] to understand that people have you know
[1:37:25] kind of these different languages and we
[1:37:26] all kind of have some little bit of this
[1:37:28] and a little bit of that you know I'm
[1:37:29] not a very gifty person you know it's
[1:37:31] nice to get something but you know I do
[1:37:33] live in Lea and you know I buy what I
[1:37:36] want usually and you know that's just
[1:37:38] how a lot of us are you know so getting
[1:37:39] a gift isn't as cool as you know if I
[1:37:41] never if I didn't have stuff maybe I
[1:37:43] would speak the love language of gifts a
[1:37:45] little bit more but you know um but but
[1:37:48] but there's these different things and
[1:37:50] some of us you know just we need to you
[1:37:52] know we need people to spend time with
[1:37:54] us and if you didn't spend time you know
[1:37:57] or you need acts of service it's like
[1:37:59] you know if your wife is acts of service
[1:38:01] Brothers do the
[1:38:02] dishes hey recipe for Success right
[1:38:05] there do the dishes for her she's going
[1:38:06] to she's going to be like he loves me
[1:38:08] and you're like I did the
[1:38:12] plates but if that and so learning your
[1:38:14] spouse learning the love language of
[1:38:16] your spouse then then you can begin to
[1:38:18] re recognize oh if I communicate this
[1:38:20] way to my spouse then they will
[1:38:23] recognize the love that I'm trying to
[1:38:26] express and in a sense I'm expressing my
[1:38:28] love to that person in a way that
[1:38:31] maximizes that they hear what it is I'm
[1:38:33] trying to
[1:38:34] say that I love you I want you to feel
[1:38:37] that and you seem to need it this way to
[1:38:40] really feel like you're loved so guess
[1:38:42] what because I love you I'm going to
[1:38:43] edit how I do this so that that you can
[1:38:45] feel loved and that's wonderful so so um
[1:38:49] you know um and and words of affirmation
[1:38:52] some of us just man we just need to be
[1:38:54] told that we're doing a good job a lot
[1:38:57] of guys feel that way actually just
[1:38:59] don't know if you knew that a lot of us
[1:39:01] are still that young person inside not
[1:39:03] really sure how this is all working and
[1:39:05] just putting on a good face hoping that
[1:39:06] it's going well so sisters probably be
[1:39:09] good if you just said he might feel that
[1:39:11] way it doesn't look like it doesn't seem
[1:39:13] like it lots of bravado lots of Pride
[1:39:16] lots of you know of course I've got this
[1:39:18] of course I got this I have no idea what
[1:39:20] I'm doing I got this
[1:39:22] babe I got this and so maybe if you told
[1:39:25] him he was doing a good job that you
[1:39:28] you'd recognize he just did the dishes
[1:39:30] for you because you filled up his love
[1:39:31] tank and you you know you were speaking
[1:39:33] words of affirmation and then he felt
[1:39:35] great and then he's like I love her so
[1:39:37] much like she just really gets me and so
[1:39:40] I'm going to go and do the dishes for
[1:39:42] her and then she's going to be like ah
[1:39:43] so amazing he loves me so much because
[1:39:45] he did something for me and he showed me
[1:39:47] that he loved me and then suddenly
[1:39:49] everybody's speaking the right language
[1:39:50] and and like man it's honeymoon phase
[1:39:52] all over
[1:39:56] again and this sermon isn't about the
[1:39:58] five love languages but what it is about
[1:40:01] is to is that we recognize there's a
[1:40:03] love tank and God has a love tank and
[1:40:04] there's a deep calling to a deep and
[1:40:06] that if we're but but but but to in a in
[1:40:09] a personal level and what I want to say
[1:40:11] is that marriage isn't solving
[1:40:12] loneliness because and even because even
[1:40:15] when we have that person around we're
[1:40:18] still requiring that person to continue
[1:40:20] ually day after day day after day speak
[1:40:23] the language of love that we need spoken
[1:40:25] to us for us to feel loved for us to not
[1:40:29] feel lonely and when that language isn't
[1:40:31] spoken for a while because things get
[1:40:33] busy and things happen and you know all
[1:40:36] of these things that we begin to get
[1:40:38] into that dry and thirsty place and we
[1:40:40] begin to get into that place we like I
[1:40:43] am I even
[1:40:44] loved does he even get
[1:40:49] me does she even understand like who I
[1:40:52] am and all that I'm trying to do and you
[1:40:55] know all of these things that we
[1:40:57] complain about in our heads you know
[1:40:59] when we're in those places and we're
[1:41:01] married so what is that what is that I'm
[1:41:03] saying there's times even in marriage
[1:41:05] that you can feel lonely and that that
[1:41:08] it is that that desire is actually never
[1:41:10] filled in one moment in the moment that
[1:41:13] you say I do and we're at the height of
[1:41:15] how wonderful it is if it was actually
[1:41:18] solved in that moment you'd not need
[1:41:20] your SP house to continue to speak the
[1:41:22] love language that you need them to
[1:41:23] speak for you to feel loved that God did
[1:41:26] not design you to actually feel
[1:41:30] satisfied and and have you know check
[1:41:33] that box off I don't need that anymore
[1:41:35] because it's
[1:41:36] done God designs you to continually seek
[1:41:40] after him it's a continuous process it
[1:41:44] will not be satisfied even in heaven
[1:41:47] even in eternity there will be a desire
[1:41:50] in inside of you and praise God for it I
[1:41:54] never never want the desire in me for
[1:41:59] more of him to ever leave me because I
[1:42:02] know that act I want that desire to be
[1:42:06] absolutely insatiable because I
[1:42:09] recognize that he has unsearchable
[1:42:12] riches and glory and so I want to always
[1:42:15] be drawing from a fountain that never
[1:42:19] can run dry and that's wonderful because
[1:42:22] I can be refreshed daily when I get into
[1:42:25] his presence and so to begin to flip the
[1:42:28] script and to begin to recognize that
[1:42:31] that that anything that I'm trying to
[1:42:34] find to cure the loneliness on the
[1:42:36] inside of me if it isn't coming from him
[1:42:40] and and we're going to get into who he
[1:42:42] is in just a moment and tie this all
[1:42:44] together but if it's not coming from him
[1:42:47] then then look this thing can't be
[1:42:49] satisfied by just mere people and just
[1:42:52] by mere experiences this thing can only
[1:42:56] be satisfied by him it's not that just
[1:42:59] the right answer to the question of what
[1:43:01] do you do when you feel lonely and well
[1:43:04] what's what's the cure to loneliness
[1:43:05] well God it's not just that he's the
[1:43:07] right answer it is that he is not only
[1:43:11] the the the thing that satisfies but
[1:43:13] he's the one that put the desire and put
[1:43:16] that desire in such a way that only he
[1:43:19] possibly could satisfy
[1:43:21] everything else that you're looking for
[1:43:23] if it's not if it isn't something that
[1:43:26] was given by him to express the the
[1:43:30] relationship that he wants to show you
[1:43:33] is never going to come anywhere close to
[1:43:36] satisfaction the only reason that
[1:43:38] marriage is is because God knew it
[1:43:41] wasn't good that man lived alone and I
[1:43:43] wanted them to see what it was like on a
[1:43:47] physical basis so that they could
[1:43:49] understand the spirit spiritual
[1:43:57] aspect so there's something intangible
[1:44:00] it's God in even in his intangible that
[1:44:03] is the only thing that can satisfy that
[1:44:06] loneliness and satisfy that Holy desire
[1:44:10] that he put inside of us so so I want to
[1:44:13] talk about Vision just for a moment
[1:44:16] because we talked a little bit about
[1:44:17] this morning you know hey no one gets me
[1:44:20] I'm just going to go sit in my room and
[1:44:22] be bored and I'm going to close people
[1:44:24] off cuz they don't get me anyway and I'm
[1:44:26] going to be alone and and and and how
[1:44:28] bad of a thing that was and but but yet
[1:44:31] isn't there there's a truth to that
[1:44:33] right like we get to a place where we
[1:44:35] feel lonely because no one gets
[1:44:39] me we say that when we feel lonely there
[1:44:43] just isn't anyone that understands what
[1:44:45] I'm going through there isn't anyone
[1:44:47] that can can what we're really saying is
[1:44:49] there's no one that kind of
[1:44:52] aligns in their Vision with
[1:44:55] me and so there there's kind of two
[1:44:57] possibilities for this and that's you
[1:45:00] know well you have the right vision and
[1:45:02] everyone else is a
[1:45:06] loser or perhaps you need to modify your
[1:45:09] own
[1:45:14] Vision brother brandham says at Thy word
[1:45:17] Lord I'll let down the net he says and
[1:45:19] down along the bank come this lovely
[1:45:21] lonely galileon despised and hated by
[1:45:25] the churches yet the Prince of
[1:45:29] Peace So Jesus himself is this lovely
[1:45:32] lonely galileon he's he's there you see
[1:45:36] and he's hated by the churches so the
[1:45:37] very people that should love him
[1:45:40] don't he's a lonely galileon he has
[1:45:43] disciples around him he has crowds
[1:45:46] following him but he's lonely and in the
[1:45:49] times of loneliness he gets away and he
[1:45:51] goes and he gets he he he he goes and's
[1:45:54] like brother Trevor but you said we
[1:45:55] shouldn't seek after alone to be alone
[1:45:58] this morning but now you're saying Jesus
[1:45:59] went to be alone and it but he wasn't
[1:46:02] alone know those times that he got to
[1:46:05] Solitude he got there for the specific
[1:46:07] reason and can imagine Jesus like look I
[1:46:10] have come here to save this world I have
[1:46:12] come here to manifest myself to die on a
[1:46:15] cross because these people they have my
[1:46:17] word but they don't get it the religious
[1:46:19] leaders have no idea who I am actually
[1:46:20] am even though they say they're been
[1:46:22] they've been looking for me for
[1:46:24] thousands of years but they have no idea
[1:46:26] who I am I'm the one who's got to go and
[1:46:28] die for all of these people like does
[1:46:30] anyone share the vision of Jesus I mean
[1:46:32] that's an interesting question because
[1:46:34] that's one yes I do but no that's like
[1:46:36] back then right like while he's there
[1:46:39] even Peter does he share the vision of
[1:46:41] Jesus like at this time are you going to
[1:46:44] restore the kingdom is now the time we
[1:46:46] get to kick out the Romans when do we
[1:46:48] get to the good part Lord when do we get
[1:46:50] to the good part I've got the
[1:46:52] sword you want me to take off malus's
[1:46:55] other ear oh Lord I'll do
[1:46:56] it just the courage that I have right
[1:46:59] now in this moment Lord is just I am
[1:47:01] Unstoppable I will take the Romans on
[1:47:03] myself like does anyone share the vision
[1:47:06] of
[1:47:07] Jesus no Peter I'm gonna look Peter
[1:47:10] Peter I literally just told
[1:47:13] you I'm going to go die for
[1:47:17] you and I'm good with that and I have to
[1:47:20] do that and you're still trying to cut
[1:47:22] off people's ears would you
[1:47:26] stop Peter doesn't share the vision of
[1:47:28] Jesus no one does he's a lonely Galilean
[1:47:31] no one gets
[1:47:33] him no one got
[1:47:36] Jesus you know they're in a boat do you
[1:47:39] now
[1:47:42] believe it's been years do you do
[1:47:47] you cuz you said we got it a little
[1:47:49] while ago and and you did and but now we
[1:47:52] know Lord that thou art the Christ it's
[1:47:54] like do you now believe do you do you
[1:48:00] really so Jesus is a lonely Galilean
[1:48:03] because no one shares his vision the
[1:48:05] people who should share his vision don't
[1:48:06] share his vision they hate him and so
[1:48:09] there he goes he's walking along and in
[1:48:10] order to find someone who shares his
[1:48:12] vision he has to get away from the
[1:48:14] people around him to go and talk to the
[1:48:17] father because only the father shares
[1:48:19] his vision now I'm so thankful that we
[1:48:21] have a Church of the Living God in our
[1:48:23] day that there's all kinds of people
[1:48:25] that should and can and will share the
[1:48:28] vision that we ourselves have and so and
[1:48:31] and there should be a big large vibrant
[1:48:34] wonderful Holy Ghost filled body of
[1:48:36] Believers that you are around that that
[1:48:39] share your vision that get you and at
[1:48:42] least on some things and so but but if
[1:48:45] we're so if we're sitting there saying
[1:48:47] well no one gets me it's like well
[1:48:48] what's your vision like what's the
[1:48:50] vision that you have that PE people
[1:48:52] don't get because maybe that's the
[1:48:54] problem is is that you aren't sharing
[1:48:56] your vision needs to be edited your
[1:48:58] vision needs to be altered to to be more
[1:49:01] focused on Jesus Christ and to be more
[1:49:04] recognizing that Jesus Christ is the
[1:49:07] answer and that if we all got together
[1:49:09] around that and shared that same desire
[1:49:13] then then maybe there'd be a a
[1:49:15] camaraderie that we would feel that
[1:49:17] would take away some of the loneliness
[1:49:19] that we are feeling because we do have
[1:49:22] that in one another and that's you know
[1:49:24] can you imagine a husband and wife and
[1:49:26] my it's happen so often right that that
[1:49:29] they've gotten together but they don't
[1:49:30] share the right Vision you
[1:49:34] know you take a girl from a you know
[1:49:38] very legalist
[1:49:39] family you know things are done by the
[1:49:42] book believer and then you take a a guy
[1:49:46] from maybe one of those you know looser
[1:49:49] families
[1:49:51] believer but he's got the desire that he
[1:49:54] wants the right kind like he recognizes
[1:49:56] there's been problems and he wants he
[1:49:59] wants he wants the right kind of wife he
[1:50:01] wants a a girl that like she knows
[1:50:04] devotions and she's re you know so so he
[1:50:06] finds a girl that's in this home where
[1:50:09] things are much stricter but this girl
[1:50:12] is getting a little bit tired of the
[1:50:16] strictness and she's looking for a guy
[1:50:18] who can be a little bit more fun and a
[1:50:20] little bit more
[1:50:22] loose and so the guy is everything this
[1:50:25] girl wants he comes from a family where
[1:50:26] things are kind of loose and that looks
[1:50:28] appealing to
[1:50:29] me and he's like I've come from this
[1:50:31] family where everything's loose I'm not
[1:50:33] really I it's like I would like some
[1:50:34] structure I would like things to be done
[1:50:36] a little bit more by the book and she
[1:50:38] comes from that and just what she
[1:50:39] represents is everything that I would
[1:50:41] like a wife to be and they get
[1:50:47] married are are they sharing a VI
[1:50:51] Vision think this is going to be
[1:50:56] problematic so they're together they're
[1:51:00] married but there's still
[1:51:03] loneliness because they're not sharing
[1:51:04] the vision right they're not aligned in
[1:51:07] the vision so that's that's a that's a
[1:51:09] problem and so anyway you can maybe find
[1:51:12] some of some of that so how much of
[1:51:15] loneliness is actually selfishness
[1:51:18] sometimes so I and I just want to say
[1:51:21] here I'm I'm not trying to beat anyone
[1:51:22] up at all I I what I what I am trying to
[1:51:25] do is that we just that we look at this
[1:51:27] issue from all sides so that we can
[1:51:29] understand our own hearts and you know
[1:51:31] look I I understand there's loneliness
[1:51:32] is a hard thing and and many of us find
[1:51:34] our places in seasons and periods of
[1:51:36] loneliness and it is dry and it's really
[1:51:39] difficult and I I have I have every you
[1:51:41] know respect for that and every you know
[1:51:44] I'm I'm not trying to to push anybody
[1:51:45] off at all right but I'm trying to deal
[1:51:48] with this issue in love and and and that
[1:51:50] we honestly look at this and and so that
[1:51:53] we can understand how we do solve that
[1:51:56] problem and how when we get into those
[1:51:58] periods of dryness that the things that
[1:52:00] maybe sometimes we're looking for aren't
[1:52:02] really the things that are going to
[1:52:03] satisfy and solve the
[1:52:06] problem so and I need to hurry so um
[1:52:10] thou Isaiah 419 and10 God speaking to
[1:52:13] the proph or the prophet speaking here
[1:52:15] thou whom I have taken from the ends of
[1:52:17] the Earth and called This is God
[1:52:18] speaking to the prophet but he's writing
[1:52:20] down thou whom I have taken from the
[1:52:21] ends of the Earth called from the chief
[1:52:23] men thereof and said unto thee Thou Art
[1:52:25] my servant I have chosen thee and not
[1:52:27] cast thee away fear thou not I am with
[1:52:29] thee be not dis dismayed for I am thy
[1:52:32] God I will strengthen thee yay I will
[1:52:35] help thee y I will uphold thee with the
[1:52:37] right hand of my righteousness now God
[1:52:39] is saying this to a prophet that he has
[1:52:42] called out this Prophet is aligned with
[1:52:44] the vision of God the prophet finds
[1:52:46] himself in the vision and God is saying
[1:52:49] I don't worry about the things that are
[1:52:51] going to come I'm with
[1:52:54] you that's who I am I'm going to be with
[1:52:57] you I'm not going to send you into these
[1:52:59] Hard Times except I'm going to be with
[1:53:02] you so you you you you you're aligned
[1:53:05] with my vision right I I could say that
[1:53:08] I'm going to be with you anyway but
[1:53:10] would you care if you weren't aligned
[1:53:13] with my
[1:53:15] vision right right so so so sometimes we
[1:53:19] we have to begin to understand what is
[1:53:20] loneliness some loneliness is when we we
[1:53:23] aren't sharing Vision with someone
[1:53:26] else right so Psalm 23:4 yay though I
[1:53:29] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:53:30] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:53:33] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:53:35] comfort me so I want to like I want to
[1:53:38] like we we need to think about this for
[1:53:39] a moment because I want what I want us
[1:53:42] to understand in this section is who God
[1:53:44] is and it is who God is that makes the
[1:53:48] difference because when we say well well
[1:53:51] God but but if we don't recognize who
[1:53:53] God is if we don't have a real sense of
[1:53:56] who he is and that his promises to us
[1:53:59] are yay and amen then we then then we
[1:54:01] won't look for him to solve the
[1:54:02] loneliness right because if someone
[1:54:05] comes along and says you know I will be
[1:54:07] with you in the Valley of the shadow of
[1:54:10] death and it's like oh man that's great
[1:54:15] that's great but what if that person was
[1:54:17] kind of Shifty and wearing a
[1:54:21] hood and
[1:54:23] said I will be with you in the Valley of
[1:54:27] the shadow of
[1:54:29] death and was rather Shifty looking and
[1:54:33] untrustworthy like I will go down that
[1:54:36] dark alley with
[1:54:39] you this is singularly not
[1:54:46] comforting you won't be alone you know
[1:54:51] but but maybe I'd be okay with
[1:54:56] that my wife and I were talking about
[1:54:58] the sermon we were at the Kalahari I was
[1:55:00] there this week for a um I guess last
[1:55:03] week for a for a a work Tech conference
[1:55:06] and so we were there lot lots of people
[1:55:08] there and a Friday the last day of this
[1:55:10] seminar is was Friday and so you have to
[1:55:12] check you know we were coming over here
[1:55:14] so we had to check out of the hotel at
[1:55:15] 11:00 and so my wife doesn't have a room
[1:55:17] you know now and she has to just come
[1:55:19] and kind of sit in the the hallway and
[1:55:20] there's nice couches and different
[1:55:21] things but you know she has to come and
[1:55:22] sit in the hallway and we began to talk
[1:55:23] about it's like hey you know when when
[1:55:25] you were in the room and I'm in the
[1:55:26] classes are were you feeling lonely
[1:55:28] she's like well no not really I was
[1:55:30] vlogging I was doing my pictures and
[1:55:32] creating a scrap scrapbook and all of
[1:55:34] these things that she had brought to do
[1:55:35] while I was you know listening to Tech
[1:55:38] technical conference talks and it's just
[1:55:40] riveting by the way and um and and you
[1:55:43] know and so she brought things for her
[1:55:44] to do and then we spent the evenings
[1:55:46] together and and and that was nice but
[1:55:48] you know I was like well when you were
[1:55:49] in the room by yourself were you lonely
[1:55:52] she's like well no not really I had
[1:55:53] things to do and I had you know all
[1:55:54] these you know and and it's like yeah
[1:55:56] but so and then when you were in the
[1:55:57] hallway after we had to check out of the
[1:55:59] room um sitting there in the hallway
[1:56:02] with all of these people walking around
[1:56:04] and were you lonely she was like yes I
[1:56:05] was a little bit more lonely in the
[1:56:07] afternoon while I was sitting there
[1:56:09] amongst thousands well not thousands but
[1:56:12] hundreds and hundreds of you know people
[1:56:15] and and she was loner though well why
[1:56:18] because the cont of I'm here and no none
[1:56:21] of these people but my husband really
[1:56:23] share the same vision that I
[1:56:25] have and so the contrast was heightened
[1:56:28] so she could recognize there's lots of
[1:56:30] people here but none of them share the
[1:56:32] vision and that's not helping me any at
[1:56:34] all now if it would have been a just a
[1:56:36] lovely you know Conference of Believers
[1:56:38] and she'd have been sitting in the
[1:56:39] hallway she'd have been like this is
[1:56:40] amazing please come sit with me and
[1:56:42] things like that so she was sitting she
[1:56:44] had chosen a chair and it was kind of
[1:56:45] close to the the dining hall and it was
[1:56:48] just kind of outside the door she's
[1:56:49] sitting there in the chair and there's
[1:56:51] another chair you know next to her and
[1:56:52] for a while I was sitting there but then
[1:56:54] I had to go and to another conference
[1:56:56] and and things and so you know well this
[1:56:58] so this other guy I mean they're just
[1:57:00] they're just chairs right there for
[1:57:01] everybody you know it's not like the
[1:57:03] chair next to her is
[1:57:05] taken so this guy comes and he's got his
[1:57:08] laptop he's got his earbuds you know he
[1:57:10] sits down and he opens up his laptop and
[1:57:11] he starts doing his thing you know and
[1:57:14] it's like I mean and I came out and I
[1:57:16] was kind like part of me was just like
[1:57:18] hey but you know
[1:57:24] she's not
[1:57:26] alone even though when you sat there no
[1:57:30] one else was sitting with her and
[1:57:33] physically she was alone but I want you
[1:57:35] to know that you shouldn't sit there
[1:57:37] because she's she's not alone she is but
[1:57:40] she's not
[1:57:44] alone she's she's with
[1:57:48] somebody
[1:57:49] and we were just we were just talking
[1:57:51] about like what if that guy would have
[1:57:52] leaned over just kind of just looked at
[1:57:54] you and been like don't worry I will
[1:57:57] never leave you or forsake
[1:58:01] you that would have been super creepy
[1:58:04] right
[1:58:06] like no thank
[1:58:10] you I don't know who you
[1:58:15] are no thank you I don't know who you
[1:58:20] are I don't have a clue whether I would
[1:58:24] want you near me or not I you could be
[1:58:27] anybody you could be a serial killer you
[1:58:28] could be anything I don't know you I
[1:58:31] don't know if you're a good person I
[1:58:33] don't know if you're the sum total of
[1:58:35] all righteousness I don't know if you're
[1:58:37] everything that is awesome I don't know
[1:58:39] if you're everything that is wonderful I
[1:58:41] don't know if you're everything that is
[1:58:43] Holy that if you're if you're everything
[1:58:45] that is true if you're everything that
[1:58:46] is good if you're everything that one
[1:58:48] could ever want I don't know if you're
[1:58:51] that and I if you want to tell me you'll
[1:58:54] never leave me or forsake me I don't
[1:58:56] know that I care but if one were to come
[1:58:59] along and you knew that person and the
[1:59:04] characters and the qualities of that
[1:59:07] person and they came down and sat right
[1:59:10] down next to you and said I will never
[1:59:12] leave you or forsake you that's not
[1:59:15] creepy at all that's the most wonderful
[1:59:17] moment that could everen happen in your
[1:59:21] life so we begin to understand what is
[1:59:25] the cure for loneliness I want to tell
[1:59:27] you he is the cure for loneliness and if
[1:59:31] you're feeling lonely and he is not then
[1:59:35] then and he's not solving that for you
[1:59:37] then I would say perhaps your vision
[1:59:40] isn't aligned with his I would say
[1:59:43] perhaps you don't know who it is that is
[1:59:47] saying to you I will never leave leave
[1:59:49] you I will never forsake you perhaps you
[1:59:52] need to have times when you get to
[1:59:55] prayer and in your prayer time he begins
[1:59:58] to reveal himself to you you begin to
[2:00:01] feel his presence coming around you and
[2:00:04] he begins to show you who he is and that
[2:00:07] he cares about you and that he's going
[2:00:10] to take care of your problems that he's
[2:00:13] going to take care of your hearts that
[2:00:15] he's there for you and that he's
[2:00:18] wonderful and maybe just maybe in prayer
[2:00:22] your heart actually begins to beat a
[2:00:24] little faster because you begin to
[2:00:26] recognize who it is that's there with
[2:00:29] you and when you see him and know him my
[2:00:33] it's the thrill of the church to know
[2:00:37] him he is it's not no no no no no no
[2:00:40] look that brother
[2:00:42] Trevor what's the cure for
[2:00:46] loneliness
[2:00:48] God
[2:00:50] you see the difference you see the
[2:00:52] difference it's not God it's
[2:00:54] him he the one who is the sum total of
[2:01:02] all Perfection is found in him and it is
[2:01:06] that one that loves you it is that one
[2:01:08] that cares for you it is that one that
[2:01:10] desires to satisfy every longing and put
[2:01:14] and even put that longing in your heart
[2:01:17] to cry out for him and he it is he is
[2:01:21] the
[2:01:22] one who comes to you and says I am with
[2:01:27] you that's the answer to loneliness is
[2:01:31] to know him to align with his vision
[2:01:34] because when you recognize who he is and
[2:01:36] it's just like oh you you're the one
[2:01:39] you're the amazing one you're the
[2:01:41] wonderful one you're the righteous one
[2:01:44] what is it you would like because I'm
[2:01:46] telling you what I haven't experienced
[2:01:48] anything near as amazing as that and
[2:01:51] guess what sign me up what would you
[2:01:54] like I want to share the vision what do
[2:01:56] you need from
[2:01:59] me what can I set me in action because a
[2:02:03] lot of times when we're lonely it's cuz
[2:02:05] we're
[2:02:07] bored and when we're bored it's because
[2:02:09] the vision there's problems with the
[2:02:11] vision we're not we're not in action
[2:02:13] with the
[2:02:15] vision now I'm not saying that we'll
[2:02:17] never be bored that there never be a
[2:02:19] time when you don't have anything to do
[2:02:20] and all of that you you understand but
[2:02:23] but there are sometimes we have long
[2:02:25] seasons of of
[2:02:29] malaise of
[2:02:31] uncertainty of not knowing and and but
[2:02:34] God is
[2:02:36] there and maybe sometimes we're in those
[2:02:39] Seasons because we're actually not
[2:02:42] listening to what he's
[2:02:44] saying because he wants to come and say
[2:02:47] look this is he this is who I
[2:02:52] am and and I'm I'm I'm wonderful I'm I
[2:02:56] want you to be a part of this this offer
[2:02:59] is is is better than anything you'll
[2:03:01] ever
[2:03:04] get but sometimes we're like yeah
[2:03:08] but Mom and Dad want me to do
[2:03:12] that and I'm a little you know miffed at
[2:03:15] them right now and so I just can't I
[2:03:18] just can't accept the offer of of doing
[2:03:21] awesome things with how amazing the
[2:03:23] amazing one that you are I get it it's
[2:03:25] an amazing thing Lord that you're asking
[2:03:27] me but but but but my parents want me to
[2:03:30] give my life to you and I right now I am
[2:03:33] just in a season of
[2:03:35] rebellion let's just be honest I'm just
[2:03:37] lord I can't because I I I I am
[2:03:42] diametrically opposed to satisfying
[2:03:44] anything that my parents want of me
[2:03:46] right
[2:03:47] now
[2:03:49] and you stick your foot out and you load
[2:03:52] the gun and you shoot yourself in the
[2:03:57] foot because let me tell you something
[2:04:00] the off offer of him being with you and
[2:04:03] never leaving you and never forsaking
[2:04:05] you how awesome he is let just I'm just
[2:04:08] I'm just going to tell you right now it
[2:04:10] is so awesome that it is going to even
[2:04:12] overcome you know how how reluctant you
[2:04:15] are to satisfy your parents' desires
[2:04:17] that you find Jesus
[2:04:19] like I'm ju I'm just telling you I get
[2:04:22] it I've been there too I've done
[2:04:27] that but
[2:04:29] nothing has ever satisfied me has ever
[2:04:33] thrilled me as much is when I know I'm
[2:04:35] in the will of God and I'm making a
[2:04:38] difference in people's lives and he's
[2:04:41] making a difference in my life and the
[2:04:44] satisfaction and the
[2:04:46] overwhelming peace and wonder of all of
[2:04:50] that and it's not and and that this
[2:04:52] isn't just for
[2:04:54] preachers this isn't just for
[2:04:58] brothers but it's for every single
[2:05:00] person whosoever will let him take of
[2:05:04] the Water of Life freely do you have the
[2:05:09] desire yes you do cuz he put it there
[2:05:12] but he is the deep that can respond to
[2:05:15] that and it's not that he just wants to
[2:05:17] come and satisfy you and say oh did oh
[2:05:20] did you want something oh did you need
[2:05:22] something here let me satisfy that good
[2:05:24] boy excellent good job I've satisfied
[2:05:26] that for you good good enough go go on
[2:05:28] your Merry way you're satisfied now no
[2:05:30] no no no like that would be nice
[2:05:35] entertaining
[2:05:38] narcissistic but there's a deep in
[2:05:42] him oh there's a deep in him that has a
[2:05:45] deep in you that wants to respond he
[2:05:47] wants it to be two-way he wants you to
[2:05:49] be active he wants you to be a part of
[2:05:51] it he wants you to desire him as much as
[2:05:54] he desires you and there's such a reward
[2:05:56] and such a fulfillingness to that to
[2:05:58] know it's like I'm not just some you
[2:06:00] know dummy that's just sitting here just
[2:06:02] completely dependent upon God I am yes
[2:06:06] in some ways that's true but I'm not
[2:06:09] merely that that is only in my flesh but
[2:06:11] the seed of God that's on the inside of
[2:06:13] me that has the characters and qualities
[2:06:16] that everything that he is is also on
[2:06:18] the inside of me is also the one that
[2:06:20] wants to satisfy that one who created
[2:06:23] that attribute in the first
[2:06:25] place and that's fulfilling and that's
[2:06:28] rewarding and marriage is is a type of
[2:06:31] that and it's wonderful yes but it is
[2:06:34] not a replacement for the satisfaction
[2:06:37] that we can have in knowing Jesus Christ
[2:06:40] in understanding his promises young
[2:06:42] people old people dive into the word of
[2:06:45] God not for the not for the instruction
[2:06:47] this is this is not basic instructions
[2:06:50] before leaving Earth I think that's one
[2:06:52] of the dumbest things forgive me if
[2:06:53] anybody else has ever preached on that
[2:06:55] that's fine I'm not against it but but
[2:06:57] this is not merely basic instructions
[2:06:59] before leaving Earth this is a this is a
[2:07:02] a letter of to you something to to show
[2:07:05] you the characters and the promises of
[2:07:08] God so that you might know him and then
[2:07:11] and then he came and then he lived that
[2:07:12] way on this Earth and and then he died
[2:07:15] and rose again and then he poured
[2:07:16] himself out into other Believers that we
[2:07:19] might know
[2:07:22] him who he is I don't want to just know
[2:07:25] about him I don't want to just know what
[2:07:27] he can do for me but God how can I
[2:07:30] reciprocate that
[2:07:32] love oh and and have a meaningful
[2:07:35] relationship with you oh
[2:07:38] God amen amen musicians you come I'm
[2:07:42] over time you forgive me I I just I
[2:07:45] wanted to express this all thank you
[2:07:47] Lord Christ in you is the hope of glory
[2:07:52] amen we'll leave that up for a
[2:07:55] bit it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:07:58] Christ in you Christ coming into you and
[2:08:01] being that deep to respond to that
[2:08:03] deep what a hope that
[2:08:05] is what an amazing journey that is what
[2:08:08] a what a thrilling thing that is that he
[2:08:11] has invited you to be a part
[2:08:15] of and to satisfy your every longing
[2:08:18] with his own
[2:08:20] self and it can be done because we know
[2:08:22] who he
[2:08:23] is and the
[2:08:28] more the more you can you can begin to
[2:08:31] play You're figuring out what you're
[2:08:32] going to play that's fine the more that
[2:08:35] we recognize and and just so just hear
[2:08:37] this for a moment I just I know it's
[2:08:38] been long but just a a final thought
[2:08:41] here the more that you can
[2:08:46] recognize the further
[2:08:49] you can
[2:08:50] expand your understanding of who he is
[2:08:55] his qualities his nature his
[2:08:58] characteristic to take him from just
[2:09:01] some guy with headphones sitting in a
[2:09:02] chair next to you to
[2:09:05] recognizing who he is that he is that
[2:09:09] wonderful one the more like you we I
[2:09:12] know we know it I I you know we've been
[2:09:14] preached it's preached to us but the
[2:09:16] more you personally can can have a
[2:09:19] relationship with the word of God to
[2:09:21] where it can come and reveal to you who
[2:09:25] you are and who he is and and that you
[2:09:28] can your your understanding and the
[2:09:30] depth you know I I I I just like I just
[2:09:33] want to know him more and more and more
[2:09:35] I want to know him as the source to
[2:09:38] satisfy my loneliness I want him to be
[2:09:41] the one that that he is the one who
[2:09:44] never
[2:09:46] leaves he is the God who sees I want to

[2:22:43] [Music]

[2:23:10] meone oh

[2:23:35] [Music]
[2:23:40] Lord
[2:23:42] amen you know
[2:23:44] I you think about how that
[2:23:48] but in this hour how brother Trevor was
[2:23:51] diving into that on that of
[2:23:55] loneliness and you know God knew he knew
[2:23:58] that each one of us would be
[2:24:00] here he knew even the state the
[2:24:03] condition he knew all the mud that would
[2:24:06] be packed in our lives he knew all of
[2:24:08] our weaknesses he knew all of those
[2:24:11] things but his
[2:24:13] choosing had nothing to do with our
[2:24:16] weaknesses
[2:24:18] nothing because your weaknesses your
[2:24:21] failures your mistakes that's not who
[2:24:24] you
[2:24:25] are that's not what defines
[2:24:28] you the world wants to try to Define you
[2:24:31] it'll try to satisfy offer take
[2:24:34] god-given
[2:24:36] thirst and pervert
[2:24:39] it example how the prophet brought that
[2:24:41] with that thirst he said it's a natural
[2:24:44] god-given
[2:24:45] desire
[2:24:48] for a lady to want to look beautiful but
[2:24:52] he said Satan will get if he can get a
[2:24:54] hold of that he'll try to pervert it you
[2:24:58] notice how when Satan perverts
[2:25:01] anything he doesn't in a way of shaming
[2:25:05] you to try to make you feel like you're
[2:25:10] nothing and to strip every form of value
[2:25:14] away from you but you know when God
[2:25:17] deals with your life God doesn't work
[2:25:20] that way God doesn't have to shame you
[2:25:23] into serving
[2:25:26] him God works by his love by his word to
[2:25:30] draw us out of us what he's put in us
[2:25:35] you know even that longing that you have
[2:25:37] that that that stirs up in your
[2:25:40] heart you know why that is God put that
[2:25:44] there in you and when his word word for
[2:25:48] this age is passing over your life
[2:25:51] that's what's making that creation
[2:25:54] inside of you I've just referred to you
[2:25:56] a direct quote that's what makes the
[2:25:59] creation inside of you because now what
[2:26:03] brother Trevor talked about that
[2:26:05] Vision now you can begin to see a vision
[2:26:09] of Victory you can begin to see a vision
[2:26:12] of yourself standing over that besetting
[2:26:16] sin you can begin to see yourself
[2:26:18] standing in
[2:26:21] Victory instead of the victim you see
[2:26:24] yourself as a mighty
[2:26:25] conqueror and there's only one that can
[2:26:28] do that for you and that's him if you'll
[2:26:31] let go of your vision and take his
[2:26:34] vision and then just start walking in
[2:26:38] step by step into that
[2:26:41] Vision God will do the work and I I
[2:26:45] think when we're gathered here t tonight
[2:26:47] the Lord would preach things would
[2:26:49] Minister things so
[2:26:52] personal Satan's objective in every
[2:26:56] aspect is to try to isolate
[2:26:59] people you remember what he said about
[2:27:02] brother Trevor said about his wife she
[2:27:04] was
[2:27:04] setting in that foyer there of Kalahari
[2:27:08] I've been there big place had to go
[2:27:10] there for conferences and things and all
[2:27:12] those people walking by I've been in the
[2:27:15] mall and felt all of
[2:27:18] alone why is that because there's nobody
[2:27:23] else that I can really connect to nobody
[2:27:26] else that shares the same vision at
[2:27:28] least that I know of you know think
[2:27:30] about it how refreshing is it when
[2:27:32] you're out to eat you're walking in a
[2:27:33] store and we see one another say oh God
[2:27:36] bless you sis God bless you brother what
[2:27:38] is it it's it's it's like a breath of
[2:27:40] fresh air somebody that you know is
[2:27:43] sharing that same
[2:27:45] vision
[2:27:48] think about how that is with
[2:27:50] God God moving by our way and stirring
[2:27:54] that up in our life and that begin we
[2:27:56] begin to say yes
[2:27:58] Lord yes
[2:28:01] Lord I say this as we just sing another
[2:28:05] song here if you would like prayer
[2:28:07] tonight maybe the enemy has isolated you
[2:28:11] I I don't I don't believe this is
[2:28:14] coincidence but I know how the things
[2:28:16] that way Satan
[2:28:18] works even among young people
[2:28:21] middle-aged old on and on and he works
[2:28:25] remember brother Bram says if he can get
[2:28:27] you thinking everybody else is wrong and
[2:28:29] get you isolated off to
[2:28:32] yourself then he said the hounds of Hell
[2:28:34] start working on you I I just say it
[2:28:37] like this no matter who it is if
[2:28:41] anything at all if there's anything at
[2:28:44] all in your life maybe it's something in
[2:28:46] your life right here tonight you say
[2:28:47] Lord I want to make just a
[2:28:50] reconsecration to you I want Lord my
[2:28:54] heart's desire is is for me to turn
[2:28:58] [Music]
[2:28:59] loose and let you have the complete
[2:29:03] control and the right away that's what I
[2:29:06] want you to have Lord I want you to have
[2:29:08] all of me so as we sing again if there's
[2:29:12] anyone like prayer I know brother Trevor
[2:29:14] be available we got other brothers
[2:29:17] but don't don't leave out of here
[2:29:19] tonight these look look when God put
[2:29:21] these burdens of the heaven these
[2:29:23] Services I'll tell you I'll just speak
[2:29:25] my heart my heart was not to get a bunch
[2:29:27] of people together that's not the
[2:29:31] purpose my heart the burden that God put
[2:29:33] on my heart was for lives for young
[2:29:36] people around this
[2:29:40] area and it's that they might know the
[2:29:43] Living God Amen they might be able to
[2:29:46] have fellowship with one anothers that
[2:29:48] an atmosphere be created that lives
[2:29:50] could be touched and hearts could be
[2:29:52] helped that's the purpose appreciate we
[2:29:56] so thankful for lives and hearts as we
[2:29:58] come together but we've come together
[2:30:00] for one purpose and I say don't let this
[2:30:03] moment pass you by if you're in a
[2:30:09] place say Lord I need a I need a real
[2:30:12] touch don't leave out of here without
[2:30:16] getting
[2:30:17] that real touch from
[2:30:21] him but Sam is it only for young people
[2:30:24] I open it no matter if God's dealing
[2:30:26] with your heart I'll tell you this if
[2:30:27] God's dealing with your heart obey the
[2:30:29] Lord obey the Lord and God will move
[2:30:34] because that drawing that pull upon your
[2:30:36] heart is because God is here making it
[2:30:39] known to you that he is what you have
[2:30:43] need
[2:30:44] of he's everything
[2:30:47] amen so as we sing this if you'd like to
[2:30:50] if you'd like to come we'd like to pray
[2:30:51] with you the others if you'd like to
