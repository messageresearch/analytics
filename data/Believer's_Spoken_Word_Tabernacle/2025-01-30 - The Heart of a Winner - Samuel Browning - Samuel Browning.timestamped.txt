[38:06] just right on that with doing things
[38:09] throughout the times in the week and
[38:11] making sure everything is there and it's
[38:14] for us and we so appreciate that thank
[38:16] you so much such a such a blessing amen
[38:20] it just really always does my heart good
[38:22] amen and I just so love those
[38:26] times uh we want to read here this text
[38:29] and I don't want to keep you standing uh
[38:31] but verse
[38:33] seven and Paul said but what things were
[38:36] gained to me those I counted loss for
[38:40] Christ yeay doubtless and I count all
[38:43] things but loss for the Excellency of
[38:47] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[38:50] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[38:53] things and do count them but d
[38:57] that I may win Christ now I want you to
[39:00] notice that word that last phrase that I
[39:04] may win Christ so part of the things
[39:06] that he suffered the loss of notice how
[39:11] that for him his approach to it is his
[39:14] thought is he's not even considering oh
[39:18] what could have been and what I missed
[39:19] here and what I had to give up but the
[39:23] Lord Jesus has done so much for Paul
[39:27] Paul's life the Redeeming Grace to where
[39:29] that Paul could look at in his own life
[39:32] and then see those other things and say
[39:34] no
[39:35] comparison there's no
[39:37] comparison I do count or think of them
[39:40] as but dumb for what purpose that I may
[39:44] win amen
[39:46] Christ isn't he already a Believer isn't
[39:49] Christ already dwelling in him he is but
[39:53] Paul also was one who would speak as the
[39:56] first church age messenger you're
[39:57] realizing that there is a necessity for
[40:01] us to continue to grow in Christ that I
[40:05] may win Christ and be found in him not
[40:10] having my own righteousness I want
[40:13] nothing to lean upon but him which is of
[40:16] the law but that which is through the
[40:19] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[40:22] is of god by faith that I may know him
[40:27] and the power of his resurrection and
[40:29] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[40:32] made conformable unto his death if by
[40:36] any means I might attain unto the
[40:39] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[40:42] had already attained either were already
[40:47] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[40:52] apprehend that for which also I am
[40:56] apprehended of
[40:58] Christ Brethren I count not myself to
[41:02] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[41:06] forgetting those things which are behind
[41:10] me praise God how many can say Amen to
[41:12] that God that's that's a key God the
[41:15] enemy will always try to remind you of
[41:17] your failures your mistakes but I want
[41:20] to remind you that as soon as they have
[41:23] been repented of from your heart then
[41:27] don't even entertain the devil can try
[41:29] to bring this up try to remind you of
[41:31] this but you have met the requirements
[41:34] of God's word and Satan will be there
[41:37] until the very change of these bodies to
[41:40] try to remind you of why you're not
[41:44] worthy but the strength to turn him down
[41:47] is because you have met the requirements
[41:51] of God's word I say thank you Lord by
[41:55] forgetting in other words that that's
[41:57] not going to be that's not going to be
[41:59] my focus and my I forget those things
[42:01] that are behind because of the blood of
[42:04] Jesus Christ and what he has done for me
[42:06] and continues to work in my life
[42:08] reaching forth so now that gives us the
[42:10] strength to reach forth unto those
[42:13] things which are before I press toward
[42:17] the mark for the prize of the High
[42:21] Calling of God in Christ
[42:24] Jesus I just realized there something
[42:26] here right now now I read from this text
[42:29] in our youth
[42:31] meeting I had no idea it just drops in
[42:35] my heart right now and we spoke to the
[42:36] young people and we had Fellowship on
[42:39] the Press but I'm not going to speak on
[42:41] the Press tonight but just I press
[42:45] notice toward the mark for the prize of
[42:50] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[42:53] you love him tonight amen amen may God
[42:56] bless you and bless the word as you're
[42:57] being
[42:59] seated so good once again to see each
[43:01] and every one of you out and sacrifices
[43:03] that are made and I know it's a little
[43:05] warmer almost feels like we got a nice
[43:07] little Heat Wave going
[43:09] and I can't remember what day of the
[43:11] week it was before finally I could drive
[43:13] down the middle part of this out here
[43:15] and not slide around but I kept on
[43:18] praying I said Lord let all that melt so
[43:21] I don't have to send out another text
[43:22] and say be careful walking across the
[43:24] middle of the parking lot but we're
[43:26] trying to do our our best to uh attend
[43:29] to that and but um I would like to speak
[43:32] to you tonight on this thought and um
[43:36] it's going to be no doubt in multiple
[43:38] parts and I'm taking it where we've been
[43:40] working with within job but it's just
[43:43] something the Lord has so burdened um
[43:45] upon my heart within this and I want to
[43:48] speak on this thought on the heart of a
[43:51] winner I'll go ahead and warn you it's
[43:52] probably not going to go the way that
[43:54] you think it's going to go tonight so
[43:56] I'll just go ahead and warn you that so
[43:58] you can you can try to predict which way
[44:00] it's going to go it probably is not
[44:02] going to go the way you're thinking it's
[44:03] going to go and then some of you like oh
[44:05] no what should I have done tonight maybe
[44:07] I should have just streamed tonight but
[44:09] no it's I believe the Lord will help us
[44:11] tonight we certainly now want his
[44:13] strength and his help I want to look at
[44:15] another scripture where Paul would take
[44:17] this tonight in 1 Corinthians 9 and
[44:20] verse 24 and Paul would write know ye
[44:24] not that they which run in a race run
[44:27] all but one receiveth the pricee so run
[44:33] that ye may obtain and every man that
[44:37] striveth for the Mastery is temperent in
[44:41] all things not just not just some things
[44:44] but the temperent in all things and Paul
[44:48] would take this obviously from that of
[44:50] an athlete when Paul would be able to
[44:52] see this those games were going on at
[44:55] times in Paul's time and Paul God would
[44:58] allow Paul and Inspire him just like
[45:00] when he would write about the armor of
[45:02] God here he was you remember he was
[45:03] chained to a soldier so Paul was able to
[45:06] see and understand all that even from
[45:08] being a Roman citizen and knowing all
[45:10] those things and then God would also
[45:12] allow him to write and Inspire him on
[45:15] these things of how that a person would
[45:17] train and they would train to actually
[45:18] to win uh a medal or a Garland or
[45:22] whatever the it was in that time and
[45:24] remember how Paul would write even to
[45:26] Timothy that you know whosoever striveth
[45:28] let him striveth let him strive lawfully
[45:31] and then you would find within this of
[45:33] how that whoever strive for the Mastery
[45:36] is temperate in all things and there's
[45:38] certain things that you know I'm sure
[45:40] that when we look at it among athletes
[45:43] and things like that when I've you know
[45:45] had the privilege sometimes you just you
[45:46] know you sometimes you might watch a
[45:48] little documentary about a runner you
[45:50] know because sometimes have You' seen
[45:51] Runners that's been so fast and you you
[45:53] kind of look at it here they are winning
[45:55] gold medals and yeah they're athletic
[45:57] and I mean they wouldn't be where
[45:58] they're at if they didn't have some
[46:01] ability and they've been able to have
[46:02] ability where they've been able to be
[46:04] coached and so forth along the way but
[46:07] then you see so much of the regimen of
[46:09] their life and you can look at how the
[46:11] things that they sacrific things they
[46:13] let go things that they don't even
[46:15] partake of things that they don't even
[46:17] entertain and and so forth for what
[46:20] purpose they do it in order to obtain as
[46:22] Paul writes here a corruptible Crown now
[46:26] the think of of that if they would do
[46:28] that to obtain a corruptible a crown
[46:30] because in in truth be known you wait so
[46:33] many years unless someone's a fanatic
[46:35] you wait so many years and nobody will
[46:37] even know what in the world and who won
[46:39] this and when they won this and whatever
[46:41] more I mean unless you get people that
[46:43] sit around a coffee shop and never have
[46:45] left their 18-year-old days in high
[46:48] school and they're still living their
[46:50] 18y old days and you know then they live
[46:52] it through their children and then they
[46:53] you know then everything and but nobody
[46:55] else knows what they're talking about
[46:57] right you you know what I'm talking
[46:59] about but we realize that those things
[47:00] fade away and in the moment they they
[47:02] mean a lot in the moment because there's
[47:04] been a lot of work that's went into it
[47:06] but Paul is bringing it to another level
[47:09] of that which will never fade away that
[47:11] Incorruptible Crown is that of a new
[47:14] body it's that of that theophany that is
[47:17] waiting there on the other side it's
[47:20] that which of the draw that's upon our
[47:22] life and to recognize that something
[47:24] that is within it that moves within our
[47:26] our heart that realizing that a lot of
[47:29] the things that come around within this
[47:31] life we still we come to a place to
[47:33] realize what does this really in value
[47:37] have to do or what does it have in value
[47:40] compared with what waits for me and you
[47:44] know I believe with all my heart in this
[47:46] hour in this day we're living in I
[47:48] believe we can experience the peace of
[47:50] God to what God has called us to to the
[47:51] fullness don't you I believe that we can
[47:54] experience heaven right here on this
[47:56] side di in our souls I believe that we
[47:59] can experience that the prophet would
[48:01] talk about even to have heaven in our
[48:03] home I believe that we can experience
[48:06] that atmosphere because we are believers
[48:10] and that we are made as channels for
[48:12] that atmosphere to move through our
[48:14] lives and so Paul would go on to write
[48:16] in verse 26 I therefore so run not as
[48:21] uncertainty now I want you to understand
[48:23] Paul when he's writing this he's not
[48:25] saying I'm running out of fear or I'm
[48:28] not running in terms of maybe I won't
[48:31] make it but because of what God has done
[48:34] in his life Paul is running with that
[48:37] strength and that fortitude as a matter
[48:39] of fact brother bam tells us I believe
[48:41] in taking sides with Jesus he said when
[48:44] those he said when God raises those up
[48:47] he said that were there through the
[48:48] First Ages they believed they were part
[48:51] of the Rapture that's how they lived
[48:54] their lives for the second coming of the
[48:56] Lord see they had no idea it was going
[48:58] to be so many years later and brother
[49:00] Braham says they went into the grave
[49:02] running and he said so when the
[49:05] Resurrection comes they're going to come
[49:07] up running because they went in with
[49:10] that kind of an anticipation that he's
[49:12] coming in our generation and see that's
[49:15] the same thing that you know they've
[49:17] looked for but I think we can say and
[49:19] we're not it's not something that's far
[49:21] out it's a reality God has declared to
[49:24] you and I that we might be know the the
[49:26] hour that we're living in and and that
[49:29] our faith might be built within this
[49:32] hour that we are truly living in the
[49:35] coming of the Lord there is nobody else
[49:38] to pass the Baton to the Baton has been
[49:41] passed to us and to know that it's not
[49:44] about whether we are sufficient enough
[49:47] in ourselves it's it's our sufficiency
[49:49] is of him and to think that even in the
[49:52] the last part of it even if you think
[49:55] about when they came back from Babylon
[49:57] and they had you know rebuilt the the
[50:00] temple there after their return from
[50:01] Babylon and so much of that parallels
[50:04] where you and I have been called out of
[50:07] denominationalism and when all of the
[50:09] adversary all the accusations and we've
[50:12] ministering on that through time of man
[50:15] everything that they were being attacked
[50:17] with false accusations and things were
[50:19] being said after even the temple was
[50:21] erected and all the walls this is
[50:24] nothing but rubbish and a fox can jump
[50:26] through through this and after it was
[50:28] all said and done when they looked at
[50:30] the temple remember the elders those who
[50:33] had seen the the first temple they wept
[50:36] and they actually declared they their
[50:39] hearts were filled with joy because they
[50:41] could see God had restored his word but
[50:45] that Temple was in no comparison to
[50:48] Solomon's Temple but you see it was it
[50:51] was a greater glory to think of how that
[50:54] God had brought a people back back into
[50:57] that place I want you to think of this
[50:59] when here stood Emmanuel God With Us and
[51:02] here he was clothed in the Tabernacle of
[51:05] his Humanity it was nothing in
[51:08] comparison to Solomon's Temple herod's
[51:11] Temple it was in no comparison but yet
[51:13] that was the exact antitype of all of
[51:17] what the type spoke of yes sir and this
[51:19] is where the Lord Jesus could stand
[51:21] there in their midst and say there is
[51:24] one in the temple that is greater
[51:29] amen so there's a lot of times there's
[51:31] things that when we're looking at the
[51:33] time that we're in and I that those
[51:36] things I say that because sometimes we
[51:38] look at ourselves but I want you to
[51:40] remember God did not Choose You and I
[51:43] based on our abilities he'll use things
[51:46] about our life but the whole thing is
[51:49] the Paradox that out of an age that has
[51:52] come back and reached to Scientific
[51:55] achievements like it was in the days of
[51:58] Noah that God will have a people that
[52:01] will be completely dependent on the
[52:04] Divine intelligence of almighty God
[52:06] he'll have a people that are not led by
[52:09] AI but they are led by the mind of
[52:12] Christ hallelujah what an achievement in
[52:15] this hour in an hour where there's such
[52:18] intolerance and hatred and such strife
[52:22] and such division but in this hour
[52:24] Hallelujah Christ himself self moving in
[52:27] the hearts of his children and through
[52:30] his word will achieve a church that is
[52:33] full of the Divine love of almighty God
[52:38] that is the achievement of almighty God
[52:41] and God is here to bring all of that to
[52:44] pass so we look to him who has beckoned
[52:47] us and called us for what he has
[52:49] summoned us to do and Paul said this is
[52:52] very certain I I'm not I'm not fighting
[52:55] as one beating the air just you know
[52:57] swinging my arms I'm landing the punches
[52:59] but I keep under my body and bring it
[53:03] into subjection lest by any means when I
[53:07] have preached to others I myself should
[53:10] be a Castaway so Paul did not rely upon
[53:15] his abilities remember Paul could speak
[53:17] many languages Paul did not rely upon
[53:20] the gift in his life right remember 1
[53:23] Corinthians 13 Paul did not rely upon
[53:26] that there's only one thing that he was
[53:28] relying on and that was the Lord Jesus
[53:33] Christ that's where he was fully resting
[53:37] and with that it was a burning within
[53:39] his heart because you see when when the
[53:42] reality of predestination strikes our
[53:45] heart you I want you understand this is
[53:47] this is where that if it's just Doctrine
[53:50] it's ceases there but this is not
[53:53] Doctrine it is the person of Jesus
[53:56] Christ
[53:57] it's about a love
[53:59] affair it's a love affair with him and
[54:02] this is why when when you know him then
[54:05] he will lead and guide you into all
[54:08] truth amen and it's something that you
[54:11] desire to know him more it's a desire to
[54:15] have more of him I just heard the
[54:17] prophet say it again I started back
[54:20] through statue of a perfect man and
[54:21] brother bam says he said you know he
[54:23] said it's come to a place like with my
[54:25] wife he said oh he says I told her honey
[54:27] he says I just would love to take you
[54:29] and just pull you inside of me he said
[54:31] so where we would really be even more
[54:33] than one and brother Bram says to think
[54:36] if we feel that way in the Mortal he
[54:38] said it's a million times higher to a
[54:41] believer that a Believer says I just
[54:44] want more of him I want more of him I
[54:47] want to be more one with him I want him
[54:50] to be more of the chief and the
[54:52] influence over my
[54:55] life sir
[54:57] yes so with that I want you just to just
[55:00] to think with me here just a moment and
[55:03] I'm not going to leave this here for
[55:04] very long but I want to just do this
[55:07] before I read a quote and I want you
[55:09] just to think that how that God calls
[55:12] each of us into this place that he
[55:16] builds us into a perfect man right
[55:19] everything starts with having obtained
[55:23] like Precious Faith coming into Christ
[55:26] Christ but then it's God who begins to
[55:30] build and work in our life that's so
[55:32] good I know we've I displayed this even
[55:35] back in May I think it was we're working
[55:36] but I want you to understand that these
[55:38] are not things that just it just it just
[55:41] happens but it's things that we give
[55:43] ourselves to and you know what how do we
[55:46] know what to even give ourselves to or
[55:47] how to even give ourselves to God unless
[55:49] we see our
[55:51] lack is that right the prophet tells us
[55:53] in in how can I overcome he said we
[55:55] don't come to to church to have our good
[55:58] places known we know those he said but
[56:00] we come that our weaknesses might be
[56:02] made known and that where we are that
[56:04] God's grace will catch us from where we
[56:07] are to where we need to be amen it's a
[56:10] growing in our life that then when we
[56:12] see our weaknesses when we see our lack
[56:15] Lord I want more of you amen Lord I need
[56:19] not just one I need I need I and I see
[56:22] my inability it's not I can't produce
[56:25] the virtue that's needed I can't produce
[56:28] the knowledge that's needed I need you
[56:31] Lord I need you Lord and you know what
[56:34] God so designs it this is where perfect
[56:37] strength and perfect weakness comes in
[56:39] God so designs the the complexities of
[56:43] life in his permiss in his in the way
[56:45] that he permits things to come to bring
[56:48] us to a place that we can see our
[56:51] weakness that's so good yes and it's
[56:54] always a crucial thing that we can do
[56:57] one of two things with that we can
[56:58] either make our weaknesses
[57:01] excuses or we can yield to the Lord and
[57:04] say
[57:05] God I
[57:07] Surrender where else can I go what else
[57:10] can I do and the prophet tells us that
[57:14] when we come to that place he said God
[57:16] made us that way for a purpose as he
[57:19] says in the message absolute he made me
[57:22] with these no accounts in me so he by
[57:26] his grace could dig it out of
[57:29] me think about that God knew he knew of
[57:32] all the Spectrum this much metal and
[57:34] this much metal it would be a certain
[57:36] Ting of the baell god knew of all the
[57:38] strains God knew of everything that
[57:40] would come down through time but his
[57:42] grace is
[57:44] sufficient the prophet said what he does
[57:47] is he'll pour himself in to that
[57:50] weakness and he uses
[57:53] himself to accomplish the job yes that
[57:57] is so
[57:58] good Hallelujah don't you love him yes
[58:02] sir think about
[58:05] this now this is we're all growing and I
[58:08] tell you what when we look at this and
[58:10] more and more and I tell you I told you
[58:12] over the past months I just just been
[58:14] taking little by little by little and
[58:16] and just throughout this this message
[58:18] and just chewing on it and meditating on
[58:20] it and and looking at it and and I want
[58:22] you just read this this statement
[58:24] because one thing that is I poured
[58:26] through this over the months and over
[58:27] the times you know you hear brother
[58:30] bradam will say it over and over I've
[58:32] got just separate uh quotes that I've
[58:34] just come through as as brother brandham
[58:36] over the time brother Bram is constantly
[58:38] referring to this growth and he says uh
[58:40] and for us and and that we might and and
[58:43] that I desire so he's putting himself
[58:46] into that place as well that his desire
[58:49] and knows there's a deeper walk for him
[58:52] amen let me read you one of the quotes
[58:54] to me is just absolute blessing at the
[58:56] end of statue of a perfect man brother
[58:59] BR says I pledge I pledge this morning
[59:02] to him with all my heart that by his
[59:06] help and by his grace I pray that I'll
[59:09] seek daily without ceasing until I feel
[59:13] every one of these requirements flowing
[59:16] in this little old stature of mine till
[59:19] I can be a
[59:21] manifestation of the living
[59:23] Christ he became watch this he became
[59:26] sin like me that I might become the
[59:29] righteousness of God like him he took my
[59:32] place Lord let me take his his now
[59:36] because that's the purpose he died for
[59:39] and he said how many will pledge that
[59:41] same thing by the grace of God good
[59:46] Hallelujah glory be to God so we look at
[59:49] this pressing towards the mark you know
[59:53] there's things that that happen and
[59:57] transpire in our lives and things that
[1:00:01] we see that happen around
[1:00:03] us sometimes in what I'm I'm referring
[1:00:06] to is sometimes there's situations that
[1:00:08] just seems like man it just seems like
[1:00:10] something just fell in place sometimes
[1:00:14] it just see you know you can have a a
[1:00:16] person or an individual and here it is
[1:00:18] it just maybe their first time they walk
[1:00:20] in in in in the church doors and we had
[1:00:23] that just there just a few mon few
[1:00:25] months ago and I want you to keep her in
[1:00:27] prayer sister Bernice she's really U you
[1:00:30] know she had an accident I had a time to
[1:00:32] be able to just speak with her on the
[1:00:34] phone here just just last week and she
[1:00:36] had an accident and has just been
[1:00:38] dealing with a real sickness in her body
[1:00:41] so let's just keep her in prayer would
[1:00:43] you she' just really been listening you
[1:00:44] know into the word and the message and
[1:00:46] just just such a such a hunger and some
[1:00:48] of you may not uh know her but she's
[1:00:50] been here throughout the services at
[1:00:52] different times uh but you know she said
[1:00:56] usually it will sit kind of right back
[1:00:57] there and but I want you just to keep
[1:00:59] her in prayer but I you know sometimes
[1:01:01] you look at a situation and here here
[1:01:03] She come in you know a service in in
[1:01:05] August and my just from that service in
[1:01:08] August I mean it was at that moment you
[1:01:10] know we were standing around and then in
[1:01:12] her heart she just she after many people
[1:01:14] started to leave she said would you mind
[1:01:16] if could I talk with you just a little
[1:01:18] bit and so my wife and I we took her and
[1:01:20] we begin to just speak to her and you
[1:01:22] know and just coming to a place to
[1:01:24] realize that you know she already been
[1:01:26] exposed and been around you know to to
[1:01:28] know of the message and and different
[1:01:30] things but in her heart she desired she
[1:01:32] said I I I need I need a deeper walk I I
[1:01:36] want I want that that anchor in my life
[1:01:39] and so you know coming to that place
[1:01:41] sometimes what I'm saying is there's
[1:01:43] sometimes where there's things that you
[1:01:44] know where lives and hearts and things
[1:01:47] can just happen and just take place and
[1:01:50] it just things things T things just
[1:01:52] happens and we we look at and and think
[1:01:54] my goodness my how did that happen and
[1:01:57] and we're we're we're so thankful to God
[1:01:59] because we know it all has to be the
[1:02:03] Lord God can work through many many many
[1:02:07] different channels uh we've seen it
[1:02:09] right here and we stand here in this
[1:02:11] congregation God has many diverse gifts
[1:02:15] in his body God has diverse even when it
[1:02:19] comes to singing playing and on just and
[1:02:22] diverse amongst his people and God had
[1:02:25] it that that way for a
[1:02:27] purpose you realize there's even certain
[1:02:30] things that you would even know about
[1:02:33] that sometimes you might think why did I
[1:02:36] even have that or read that at some
[1:02:41] time but you know Paul when he came to
[1:02:43] Mars
[1:02:44] Hill at that time maybe some things that
[1:02:47] he had read that he thought was why did
[1:02:50] I even read that before but when he came
[1:02:53] there he was able to quote their poet
[1:02:56] that's
[1:02:57] right now God didn't call everybody God
[1:03:00] didn't call Peter to know the poets but
[1:03:03] God used what was already there in
[1:03:05] Paul's
[1:03:06] [Applause]
[1:03:08] life and God had him in that place for a
[1:03:11] certain reason because those individuals
[1:03:13] they would probably not have even
[1:03:14] listened to Peter true but God used and
[1:03:18] God used that to him to pick up and be
[1:03:21] able to speak for what purpose to win
[1:03:24] them yeah Hallelujah that was the
[1:03:27] purpose it wasn't that Paul would be
[1:03:29] able to say I read this and I read that
[1:03:31] and I read it wasn't for that even for
[1:03:34] all the languages that he knew right
[1:03:36] amen Paul might have wondered sometimes
[1:03:39] why why am I learning this language why
[1:03:41] am I knowing this and he might have
[1:03:43] found like look he had come to a place
[1:03:45] he counted all things but dung and when
[1:03:48] it come to such a place God said I can
[1:03:51] use it
[1:03:55] God will use things and experiences in
[1:03:59] your life that you might look at and say
[1:04:02] why did I even pass through that why did
[1:04:04] I even have an understanding of that and
[1:04:07] God as we yield to him God can sweep
[1:04:10] right down and use that testimony use
[1:04:12] that experience for what purpose to win
[1:04:16] someone else that's right that's right
[1:04:19] that is so
[1:04:21] [Music]
[1:04:23] goodu so pressing towards the mark some
[1:04:25] sometimes as we're looking at it it
[1:04:29] sometimes as I said it falls right in
[1:04:30] place without any effort and those are
[1:04:32] things that I believe that we we can
[1:04:35] always see it's it's it's the Lord at
[1:04:37] work but it wants us just to understand
[1:04:39] and just to be mindful God works in many
[1:04:43] different
[1:04:44] ways I want to just read here a few
[1:04:47] quotes and there's will be a little bit
[1:04:48] more I'll refer to but I want to just
[1:04:51] think of this brother BR says we pray in
[1:04:54] prayer we pray that you'll come in your
[1:04:55] magnificent power and will lay thy
[1:04:58] Healing Wings across the building and
[1:05:01] may every sick person in here be filled
[1:05:03] with healing power Grant it Lord may as
[1:05:06] the prophet said the distilled du drops
[1:05:08] of Mercy bathe our souls until we see
[1:05:12] the purpose of Jesus our King to redeem
[1:05:15] us from sickness and sin and to set us
[1:05:18] free and to give us a happy life of
[1:05:21] service winning others for him amen now
[1:05:26] brother brah will go on in another
[1:05:27] message I'm just going to read it and
[1:05:29] you can listen he said another thing
[1:05:31] Lord knowing that the coming of the Lord
[1:05:33] is close at hand what type of people
[1:05:35] should we be how should we conduct
[1:05:37] ourselves that's what it says in second
[1:05:39] Peter how should we be waiting with
[1:05:41] great enthusiasm and in anticipations
[1:05:45] waiting for the coming of the Lord
[1:05:48] winning Every Soul to Christ that we can
[1:05:52] for the hour is getting darker and
[1:05:54] darker and as the storm CL clows of
[1:05:56] unbelief and skepticism moves over our
[1:05:58] beloved Nation so it's time to thrust in
[1:06:02] the sickle now and get what we can
[1:06:05] Amen brother Bram stands in the end of a
[1:06:09] blessing Prophet that message and he
[1:06:11] stands after speaking just a little bit
[1:06:13] of time and he's dealing with how the
[1:06:16] conditions that are among and what they
[1:06:19] see you know just even in the little
[1:06:20] city where they're at and and all around
[1:06:23] and and brother brandham is just you
[1:06:24] know he's he's talking to the Lord and
[1:06:26] he said you know he says I I I've missed
[1:06:29] he said so many opportunities I've
[1:06:31] missed because of petty things little
[1:06:33] old insufficient things that don't mean
[1:06:35] nothing I'm ashamed of myself as a
[1:06:37] gospel preacher before you I Repent
[1:06:40] before God and ask God to forgive me and
[1:06:42] the church to forgive me for being so
[1:06:44] dilatory about the work of God by the
[1:06:47] grace of God and by the help of God he
[1:06:49] said I I'm I'm trying to tell tell
[1:06:52] trying to tell you something to do he
[1:06:54] said they've got a program
[1:06:56] they've got something for you to do
[1:06:58] nonsense God's program is written in the
[1:07:00] Bible and he said I'm ashamed of myself
[1:07:03] as a minister of the Gospel 1 million
[1:07:05] Souls one but I ought to have 10 million
[1:07:07] Souls one I'm way behind and he said
[1:07:11] what about you how many Souls have you
[1:07:14] won since you've been to Christ right he
[1:07:17] said Christianity just just goes uh he
[1:07:21] says how many Souls have you once that
[1:07:22] you've been to Christ he says uh
[1:07:25] Christianity just goes from one to
[1:07:26] another how many Souls you won since
[1:07:28] you've been a Christian if you're not
[1:07:30] winning Souls you're guilty you're baren
[1:07:33] you've brought shame on the church and
[1:07:36] the gospel how many people he says do
[1:07:38] you get out for Wednesday night prayer
[1:07:40] meeting I want you to notice this isn't
[1:07:42] it isn't condemnation but it's calling
[1:07:45] us back to understanding the principle
[1:07:48] of
[1:07:49] winning I'm talking about the heart of a
[1:07:54] winner the heart heart's desire of a
[1:07:58] winner now to think because when we look
[1:08:01] at this let me just finish reading in
[1:08:03] here he says if you're not doing it you
[1:08:05] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[1:08:07] you're guilty and your places at the
[1:08:09] altar and invite you to come with me for
[1:08:11] repentance brother Bram just when he
[1:08:13] invites the people the prayer that
[1:08:15] brother Bram prays after this I I I was
[1:08:18] going to play it for you but the audio
[1:08:19] is not that great but it's just powerful
[1:08:22] and he says will you bow your heads and
[1:08:23] just just while I feel my guilt because
[1:08:26] I'd like to
[1:08:27] repent amen cuz he's seeing that there's
[1:08:31] so much more and here's what it is as he
[1:08:34] said in the very the the the the the one
[1:08:37] before that uh he he talks about how
[1:08:40] that I've let too many other little
[1:08:42] things get in the way I've let I've let
[1:08:45] missed opportunities I've let things
[1:08:48] come my way I wonder if some of those
[1:08:50] things that the prophet let come his way
[1:08:53] that we also could Fellowship in and
[1:08:56] sometimes we've listened to our own
[1:08:58] thinking oh my and sometimes we've went
[1:09:01] by our own
[1:09:03] feelings instead of saying Lord you lead
[1:09:07] me then every opportunity no matter
[1:09:11] where we're standing you might be
[1:09:12] standing in a store might be standing in
[1:09:14] a deli I'm just trying to say that look
[1:09:17] the reason that we're here is because
[1:09:19] the last one hasn't come in
[1:09:23] yet Hallelujah and that's our brother
[1:09:25] that's our sister I don't know where
[1:09:27] they're at they might be on Skid Row
[1:09:30] somewhere you might say well they might
[1:09:32] be someone way down you know in
[1:09:34] Guatemala or El salador every place has
[1:09:38] a last one that's right every place has
[1:09:41] the last
[1:09:43] one and in the meantime it's God moving
[1:09:47] and molding I friends I I don't
[1:09:50] understand I I'm not even here to try to
[1:09:52] put all this together but to understand
[1:09:54] that God will bring every son and
[1:09:56] daughter of God into a full adoption
[1:09:59] before we leave this
[1:10:01] place do you see what I'm saying and I
[1:10:04] I'm just looking at look how the prophet
[1:10:06] talked about in invisible union he refer
[1:10:09] referred to the opening of the seals and
[1:10:11] he says my goodness the things are
[1:10:13] happening so fast rolling across that
[1:10:16] desert things are opening so
[1:10:19] quick the word that came and was brought
[1:10:22] to you and I and I'm looking at this
[1:10:24] right here and this time
[1:10:25] listen you think that there's not going
[1:10:27] to be lives and hearts that even right
[1:10:30] Among Us that the spirit of God taking a
[1:10:32] hold of their life and here they are
[1:10:34] filled with the spirit of God and there
[1:10:36] will be such growth moving in their life
[1:10:39] in such a rapid
[1:10:41] Pace why that is so good why because
[1:10:44] he's
[1:10:45] faithful amen he'll make sure every son
[1:10:48] and daughter of God comes to their
[1:10:52] position thank you Lord
[1:10:58] may God help
[1:11:00] us I look at how that brother Brandon
[1:11:03] would say oh he says I want to see when
[1:11:06] I stand there that day God he said has
[1:11:08] given the gift that he's placed here
[1:11:10] upon this Earth and he said that people
[1:11:14] might be without excuse on that
[1:11:16] day now God didn't send this ministry to
[1:11:19] condemn people John 3 John 3 right and
[1:11:24] then the he did not come into this world
[1:11:26] for God so loved the world that's it if
[1:11:29] you read John 3:16 you see the heart of
[1:11:31] a
[1:11:33] winner it was the heart of the winner
[1:11:36] because remember God and Christ are not
[1:11:38] two separate people it was God in Christ
[1:11:41] God's heart on
[1:11:44] display in a tabernacle of human
[1:11:47] flesh he was called he was ridiculed
[1:11:51] they said he had a black mark on his
[1:11:53] name he was ridiculed he went through
[1:11:55] Whispers he went through everything
[1:11:58] where he walked through his
[1:12:00] life blessed but he didn't let that stop
[1:12:05] him from winning
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:10] you I'm talking about the heart of a
[1:12:12] winner not the mind not you know yeah we
[1:12:14] say we got to have the right mind and
[1:12:16] that's exactly right oh you know it
[1:12:17] takes the right mental attitude that's
[1:12:19] exactly right but you know when
[1:12:21] something's in your
[1:12:23] heart even when you don't feel like it
[1:12:27] yes it's in your
[1:12:29] heart that's why when God gives a burden
[1:12:32] a burden it's not a burden like oh I
[1:12:34] have to do this no it's a burden that
[1:12:36] even when you don't feel like
[1:12:38] itall you do it because it's the love of
[1:12:42] God that constrains you in your
[1:12:45] heart your whole life it's not about you
[1:12:48] any longer and God leads us to those
[1:12:50] places of
[1:12:52] self-sacrifice are you with me leads us
[1:12:55] the dove is still
[1:12:57] leading the dove is leading the
[1:13:00] Lambs he led the lamb and the dove that
[1:13:04] has been loosed in the evening time is
[1:13:07] leading the Lambs of
[1:13:13] God
[1:13:15] God said that that gift I think God
[1:13:19] would come down in such a way in this
[1:13:21] generation why God God would display
[1:13:25] himself remember for the
[1:13:28] purpose not just that people would
[1:13:30] follow after a gift right that's right
[1:13:32] not just that they would go after
[1:13:35] healing brother Brandon had just been
[1:13:37] pouring over one in a million over and
[1:13:39] over again brother Brown dealing with in
[1:13:42] there very familiar statement he said
[1:13:45] healing is the bait on the fishes
[1:13:49] Hood he said and what that Divine
[1:13:51] Healing does listen he said what that
[1:13:53] does among the people is when they can
[1:13:56] see something is done that no natural
[1:14:02] mortal can do he said then they
[1:14:06] recognize there is one that is
[1:14:10] greater and it's at that moment that at
[1:14:13] that time that that's what the hook is
[1:14:15] set for is to bring them into
[1:14:19] himself how many of you watching maybe
[1:14:22] deep call to deep or read your first
[1:14:24] book or came into your first service
[1:14:27] right first time God dealt with you you
[1:14:29] came with a paper bag with your clothes
[1:14:31] to be
[1:14:32] baptized is that right different ones of
[1:14:35] you when God met you and begin to deal
[1:14:37] with your life it was something you
[1:14:39] didn't even know exactly what it was you
[1:14:41] didn't even know what the message was
[1:14:44] but what it was it was Eagle wings God
[1:14:47] sent Eagle wings to get
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:51] you Hallelujah the conditions that we we
[1:14:55] were in the situations the things that
[1:14:57] we were
[1:14:59] believing but Eagle
[1:15:01] wings Hallelujah he sent to bring us
[1:15:04] unto himself on Eagle
[1:15:07] wings Hallelujah it was the heart of a
[1:15:12] winner oh I'm so glad aren't
[1:15:15] you brother Ram said like this he said
[1:15:18] oh he said may I be as faithful to his
[1:15:21] word and to the calling I believe
[1:15:22] someday I'll see him in peace and I want
[1:15:24] to to see standing with me literally
[1:15:28] millions of people that I had to be
[1:15:31] instrumental in winning them to
[1:15:37] Christ I want you to remember to be a
[1:15:40] winner you've got to be temperate in all
[1:15:47] things
[1:15:49] temperent and you know what God shows us
[1:15:53] where we need to be tempered
[1:15:55] in our lives we don't start out altto
[1:15:58] together that oh I've it's like many
[1:16:01] times in your heart of your life and my
[1:16:03] life sometimes you learn things as you
[1:16:05] get older not to eat certain things
[1:16:07] because it makes you
[1:16:09] stiffer some of you may not experience
[1:16:11] that or whatever more but I'm telling
[1:16:12] you I've experienced
[1:16:14] that seem like I can't hardly get out of
[1:16:16] a chair and then I realize oh stop
[1:16:18] eating this right here then I can get
[1:16:20] right up stiffness I know I'm only 49 I
[1:16:24] know look only 17 but I get it I get it
[1:16:28] but you know there's certain things that
[1:16:29] you can eat and you realize after you
[1:16:31] eat it you're like boy I wish I hadn't
[1:16:32] ate that or I wish I had to waited till
[1:16:35] after church and ate
[1:16:36] that right I mean you sat here and you
[1:16:39] almost put a mask on because you didn't
[1:16:41] well anyhow there's things that we learn
[1:16:44] to be temperate is that right that's the
[1:16:47] way that God deals with our life on
[1:16:50] certain things he's drawing from our
[1:16:51] lives Now watch how brother Ben goes on
[1:16:53] to say this in the message divine love
[1:16:55] he said we're not trying to make
[1:16:56] disciples out of anyone we're only
[1:16:58] trying to get you to fall deeply in love
[1:17:01] with the Lord Jesus and start winning
[1:17:04] souls for him brother B goes on to say
[1:17:07] this is the only time we're going to be
[1:17:10] mortal this is the only time that we're
[1:17:12] going to have the privilege of winning a
[1:17:14] soul let's do it this week if every
[1:17:17] person in here will try with all of your
[1:17:19] heart to win some soul to Christ this
[1:17:22] week there will be Joy bells of Heaven
[1:17:24] ringing let us remember that and do all
[1:17:26] we
[1:17:28] can and of
[1:17:30] course cares of Life busyness of
[1:17:34] life and sometimes what will try to come
[1:17:38] around and try to make us ashamed of
[1:17:40] what we believe and most of the time
[1:17:43] when a person starts out with serving
[1:17:45] the lord and they get they get the
[1:17:46] feeling like well I can't explain this
[1:17:48] and it's can't explain that you don't
[1:17:49] have to explain everything just tell him
[1:17:51] how your candle got lit tell him what
[1:17:54] he's did for you that he saved my soul
[1:17:57] well brother Samuel you know I'm I'm not
[1:17:59] certain exactly where I'm at right now
[1:18:01] testify according to what you know that
[1:18:04] God has done in your life the prophet
[1:18:07] said when you will confess what he has
[1:18:10] done watch it work
[1:18:13] righteousness in your life
[1:18:16] Hallelujah just hand the devil back his
[1:18:18] muzzle and say take this back I don't
[1:18:21] need
[1:18:22] this I'm going to testify for what I
[1:18:25] know he is I can't testify for what he's
[1:18:28] done for you I can't it's your
[1:18:30] experience it ain't mine but I can tell
[1:18:33] according to what he's done for me and
[1:18:35] you know what how what he's done for me
[1:18:37] there'll be somebody somewhere along the
[1:18:39] lines different ones that God has so
[1:18:41] aligned that to
[1:18:47] catch notice this in Romans 9:1 14- 16
[1:18:51] I'm I'm just reading these scriptures
[1:18:53] with a purpose Paul said what shall we
[1:18:55] say then is there unrighteousness with
[1:18:58] God God forbid for he saith to Moses I
[1:19:00] will have mercy on whom I will have
[1:19:02] mercy and I will have compassion on whom
[1:19:05] I will have compassion so then it is not
[1:19:07] of him that willth nor of him that
[1:19:09] runneth but of God that showeth Mercy
[1:19:13] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[1:19:17] and not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:19:19] God not of Works lest any man should
[1:19:22] boast for we are his workmanship created
[1:19:25] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[1:19:28] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:19:31] walk in them that is so good so truly
[1:19:37] these scriptures among so many others of
[1:19:39] the Canon of the Bible we can draw that
[1:19:42] same conclusion salvation is of the Lord
[1:19:46] and as we've been looking and the Lord
[1:19:48] would have us looking through those
[1:19:49] Services we looked at on a savior and
[1:19:51] how that God would work even through
[1:19:53] those attributes
[1:19:55] remember within it it's not our business
[1:19:58] our business itself is not to is not to
[1:20:01] save somebody our business is to just be
[1:20:05] an instrument that the word itself that
[1:20:08] has done a work in us that's in our
[1:20:10] hearts that that same word could be
[1:20:13] issued out to someone else it's casting
[1:20:16] bread upon human Troubled
[1:20:19] Waters so it's a privilege we're not
[1:20:22] called because we're not a divine Savior
[1:20:24] no I'm not a divine Savior I can't save
[1:20:26] anybody but I know that God and what he
[1:20:29] did for me and I know what he did for me
[1:20:31] it was miraculous he changed my life
[1:20:34] completely as a matter of fact when not
[1:20:37] only others wrote me off I didn't even
[1:20:39] realize this I had no idea but he
[1:20:42] changed my
[1:20:45] life glory be to God now notice this is
[1:20:50] then that purpose that we are called to
[1:20:52] listen brother BR would say it like this
[1:20:54] in what was the Holy Ghost given for the
[1:20:56] purpose of the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:20:58] father again God the Father dwelling in
[1:21:00] you working out his plans to finish his
[1:21:04] Plan of Redemption working through you
[1:21:09] making you a coworker with him giving
[1:21:13] you a place giving you a part for your
[1:21:16] Fallen lost brother or sister do you
[1:21:19] realize when God puts somebody like that
[1:21:21] on your heart maybe it's somebody you
[1:21:23] work with somebody you've met at the
[1:21:25] meat counter maybe it's somebody that's
[1:21:27] checked you out of the line at some
[1:21:29] place maybe it's a loved one but you
[1:21:31] realize when that is put on your heart
[1:21:35] do you realize that's how it was we were
[1:21:39] always on his
[1:21:42] heart Revelations 13:18 said that when
[1:21:45] the names our names were written on the
[1:21:48] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:21:50] foundation of the world our names were
[1:21:53] always there we were always identified
[1:21:57] with
[1:21:58] him and his desire was to have
[1:22:02] fellowship with his attribute Sons then
[1:22:06] the fall came in and when the fall came
[1:22:09] the prophet I love how he says it he
[1:22:10] said after the fall came he said he
[1:22:12] wasn't going to just let his creation
[1:22:17] lay there in
[1:22:19] Ruins but he begin to work begin to
[1:22:23] brood begin to to move we were as
[1:22:26] helpless as helpless could be but he be
[1:22:29] to brood he be to move upon our life for
[1:22:32] what purpose notice it was the heart of
[1:22:35] a
[1:22:36] winner even when here there was a Noah
[1:22:40] Noah at the end here of the part of it
[1:22:43] here he dies a drunk Ste a prophet of
[1:22:46] God but think about it when that came up
[1:22:48] it did not stop the heart of our
[1:22:52] winnerl he kept going he kept moving and
[1:22:56] here came an Abraham here came an
[1:22:58] Abraham then here came an Isaac then
[1:23:01] here came a Jacob then there came a
[1:23:03] Joseph that's the
[1:23:05] pedestal that the image is going to sit
[1:23:07] on Hallelujah my body that will be built
[1:23:11] by the prophets will be set on
[1:23:15] faith love Grace and Perfection that is
[1:23:20] so good I will build it back my
[1:23:26] self
[1:23:32] Hallelujah he didn't throw in the
[1:23:35] towel he didn't give up he kept working
[1:23:38] he kept working what was it it's the
[1:23:41] heart of a winner it was the very Heart
[1:23:43] Of God which is
[1:23:46] Christ it was Christ that inspired the
[1:23:49] prophets when they were ready to give up
[1:23:52] when like Elijah I'm the only one that's
[1:23:54] left they won't even hear me I'm no
[1:23:56] better than my prophets of my father's
[1:23:58] Lord take me
[1:24:00] away but it was God who came and
[1:24:03] ministered to him you've got more to do
[1:24:07] your time is not up I've sent you to
[1:24:09] anoint Elisha you're to anoint this
[1:24:12] anoint that and that had to come into
[1:24:16] Elisha men God allowed the humanity of
[1:24:20] men to be on display to where they were
[1:24:23] ready
[1:24:24] to say just take me on home why that the
[1:24:28] heart of a winner could be
[1:24:35] displayed oh
[1:24:40] God lord wonder how many times his heart
[1:24:43] has been on display for me for you for
[1:24:46] usall would it been in our our breaking
[1:24:49] point at the heart of a winner oh
[1:24:55] thank you Lord notice giving you a part
[1:24:58] for your fall and lost brother and
[1:25:00] sister giving you his spirit and his
[1:25:03] love oh it's not your spirit it's not
[1:25:07] your love it's his he given to you to go
[1:25:13] hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of
[1:25:17] Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's
[1:25:20] what the Holy Spirit does to a man or
[1:25:22] woman when it strikes into their heart
[1:25:24] and takes its abod there's a thirst and
[1:25:27] a hungering for lost
[1:25:30] souls brother Bram says that's what's
[1:25:32] the matter with the meetings today
[1:25:33] there's not enough Spirit touch in it to
[1:25:35] go for the souls of the lost and dying
[1:25:37] it's more to make a name a church a
[1:25:39] building a denomination instead of a
[1:25:41] soul-winning program oh how pitiful we
[1:25:44] could stay on it much he said so we want
[1:25:46] to do something for him now you know
[1:25:49] God's not calling us the work of
[1:25:52] redemption in our life remember brother
[1:25:54] Rand would picked this up when he would
[1:25:56] preach invisible Union the bride of
[1:25:58] Christ and he would he would pick this
[1:26:00] up and deal with this Union that is to
[1:26:03] be between Christ and the bride he would
[1:26:06] admonish the people of God there he said
[1:26:09] we're trying to lead you to deeper
[1:26:12] thoughts and higher objectives than just
[1:26:16] coming to church and and just being here
[1:26:18] but he he's pointing it that there's a
[1:26:20] there's a deepness that God is calling
[1:26:23] for and and an invisible Union with God
[1:26:25] to think about it that God himself has
[1:26:28] so supplied the way to take care of our
[1:26:30] first nature so that we might be free
[1:26:32] and clear to be able to be United to him
[1:26:35] that is so good and you know you might
[1:26:37] look at your life and say well I you
[1:26:39] know in your memory in your memory well
[1:26:40] I did this and I did this and and this
[1:26:42] when I was in the world and I I was in
[1:26:44] the world remember the Lord Jesus
[1:26:47] himself being the great high priest must
[1:26:50] follow the principles of his own word
[1:26:53] that a priest must marry a
[1:26:58] virgin is that right so then this is
[1:27:01] where the mystery of the new birth comes
[1:27:04] in that mystery of where rever Romans 7
[1:27:07] where that Christ himself comes to place
[1:27:10] to be able to deal a death blow not just
[1:27:14] divorcement to that old nature but
[1:27:17] absolutely where it is
[1:27:20] dead and that seed that part on the
[1:27:23] inside that was laid that he raises that
[1:27:25] soul that Soul into a newness of life to
[1:27:30] where it's like Rahab remember remember
[1:27:34] Rahab you cannot be married to salmone
[1:27:39] right come on but God showing the power
[1:27:44] of the blood that would come through the
[1:27:47] word of God to where he would be asked
[1:27:51] are there any that can withstand this
[1:27:54] Union between this man and woman are
[1:27:56] there any witnesses that say this shall
[1:27:59] not proceed any further you know what
[1:28:03] had happened there was no witnesses that
[1:28:07] could raise their tongue against RAB
[1:28:10] Hallelujah you know what happened the
[1:28:12] word of God the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:28:15] didn't just silence the witnesses it did
[1:28:17] a way with
[1:28:20] them it did away with them and yet Satan
[1:28:25] would like to torment you in your mind
[1:28:27] and remember but I want you to remind
[1:28:29] him that was not
[1:28:32] me I have repented for allowing that old
[1:28:36] nature to rule over my life but that's
[1:28:39] not me my desire has been
[1:28:42] changed my life has been changed the
[1:28:45] only thing I desire is to please
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:49] him and like a husband and a wife that
[1:28:52] are united together we grow more and
[1:28:57] more and more in a
[1:29:00] union
[1:29:02] hallah
[1:29:04] Hallelujah Lord don't you love the
[1:29:07] Lord that is so
[1:29:11] good now this is let me get back to my
[1:29:15] point this is where brother Bram will
[1:29:17] take that invisible union he said the
[1:29:19] church in its present condition is in no
[1:29:23] position to finish up the Great
[1:29:28] Commission they were in no position it
[1:29:30] would take God coming down and leading
[1:29:34] his children back to a place of Jubilee
[1:29:39] amen back to to their inheritance back
[1:29:42] to a place to where you know God in a
[1:29:46] personal way amen and you've met the
[1:29:48] requirement it ain't a long list the
[1:29:50] Bible says

[1:31:29] why doing something for him watch out
[1:31:31] brother Brown just puts this so simple
[1:31:33] do something for him brother Brown says
[1:31:35] see he's talking about that little woman
[1:31:37] who well let me go back here so you
[1:31:40] don't read it brother Bram talking about
[1:31:42] that remember I was remember I was
[1:31:43] preaching on that on Dwight Moody and I
[1:31:44] said I don't know how many people were
[1:31:45] in attendance I thought I had read a
[1:31:47] quote somewhere sometime well it's in
[1:31:49] the Lamb's Book of Life brother Bram
[1:31:50] tells us that little woman who cleaned
[1:31:52] out that horse doll picked up all that
[1:31:54] manure and everything else guess how
[1:31:55] many people were in attendance her and
[1:31:58] The
[1:31:59] Preacher Brother BR said her and the
[1:32:02] preacher and she had had rented that
[1:32:04] barn and she had the preacher come in
[1:32:08] and about has they got into that brother
[1:32:09] B you know he's pulling out there from
[1:32:10] history as you get into it he said here
[1:32:13] came a little shaggy-haired boy walking
[1:32:15] in that night Hallelujah God knew where
[1:32:17] the white Moody was
[1:32:19] at and then think about he took the
[1:32:21] white Moody now you remember the writing
[1:32:24] where you had different ones coming to
[1:32:25] watch DWI and Moody preach and they said
[1:32:27] I don't know who in the world would go
[1:32:29] hear him
[1:32:30] preach that guy his grammar and
[1:32:33] everything else is so
[1:32:34] terrible my Lord he's just terrible and
[1:32:38] and D white Moody said it like this he
[1:32:39] said
[1:32:40] look I'm winning Souls with my poor
[1:32:45] grammar what are you doing with your
[1:32:48] degree it was winning Souls it wasn't
[1:32:52] about I mean Dwight Moody was not a
[1:32:54] great it wasn't like he was a great
[1:32:56] order let me just tell you something
[1:32:57] Dwight Moody didn't even preach Divine
[1:32:59] Healing but he
[1:33:01] preached salvation and what he knew and
[1:33:04] the prophet said healings took place
[1:33:07] right in the meetings because he
[1:33:09] preached the word that he knew had had
[1:33:11] been commissioned
[1:33:13] to glory be to God in the highest
[1:33:16] Hallelujah you know what that says to
[1:33:18] you and I just do what God has entrusted
[1:33:21] you to do he'll take care of all the
[1:33:23] rest
[1:33:25] Hallelujah do something for him brother
[1:33:28] BR says he said sometime like that
[1:33:30] little woman you don't even know what
[1:33:31] you're doing but speak a little word for
[1:33:34] Jesus testify sing or pray and like
[1:33:39] bread upon the Water it'll return
[1:33:40] someday right just remember don't fail
[1:33:42] don't fail to win some Souls whatever
[1:33:44] you do win
[1:33:47] souls from that time the little things
[1:33:50] that we do look at this
[1:33:52] invite someone to the meeting right
[1:33:56] isn't that scriptural right isn't isn't
[1:33:59] that what what Philip went to Nathaniel
[1:34:02] hey hey come and see come and see well
[1:34:05] brother Samuel I'm afraid if they get
[1:34:07] here they won't like it but at least
[1:34:10] you've done your part right and they can
[1:34:12] make their own decision is so good and
[1:34:16] how do you know they might make a
[1:34:18] decision based on what they've been
[1:34:20] taught when they might come the first
[1:34:22] service or the second service and you
[1:34:24] think oh something goes through your
[1:34:25] mind they'll never be back I'm going to
[1:34:27] tell you if they belong to God that's
[1:34:29] right what they may they may not
[1:34:30] remember the words but they'll remember
[1:34:32] his presence yeah that's right that's
[1:34:35] why we want to make sure with every part
[1:34:37] in our life the heart of a winner we
[1:34:39] want to be temper and everything God I
[1:34:41] want to keep things CL leaned out of my
[1:34:42] life grudges and everything else the
[1:34:44] heart of a winner why that Souls might
[1:34:47] be saved that the Miracles might take
[1:34:49] place that lives would be changed that's
[1:34:52] the heart of a winner
[1:34:54] yes it is notice invite someone into the
[1:34:58] meeting speak a little word for Jesus
[1:35:01] testify sing or pray so it it don't
[1:35:05] matter wherever you fall at within there
[1:35:08] right that's that's the part of it the
[1:35:10] heart of a winner sometimes because
[1:35:11] brother BR deals with this he said
[1:35:13] sometimes we feel like that if we're not
[1:35:15] some big person that we can you know
[1:35:17] we're just insufficient he said I
[1:35:18] believe it's written in the scriptures
[1:35:19] it's not the big things we do it's the
[1:35:21] little things we leave undone but Jes
[1:35:23] Jesus knows every little thing yes he
[1:35:26] does that you
[1:35:29] do I told you before I'm looking forward
[1:35:31] to we get the other side we'll know who
[1:35:32] that little sister
[1:35:34] was we don't even know her name I I
[1:35:36] don't know her name but but but but she
[1:35:39] did what God called her to do bless God
[1:35:42] I want you let me just try to bring this
[1:35:43] to a certain place here tonight notice
[1:35:46] in the scriptures Proverbs 11:30 the
[1:35:50] fruit of the righteous is a tree of life
[1:35:54] just keeps moving wow and he that winth
[1:36:00] Souls is
[1:36:02] wise this is how it says it in the
[1:36:04] amplifi the fruit of the
[1:36:05] uncompromisingly righteous is a tree of
[1:36:08] life and he who is wives wise captures
[1:36:13] human lives for God as a fisher of men
[1:36:17] he gathers and receives them for
[1:36:20] eternity I want in something that the
[1:36:22] Lord Jesus came along and one of the
[1:36:25] things he told the disciples when he saw
[1:36:27] him out there fishing he said come
[1:36:29] follow me and I will make you Fishers of
[1:36:33] Men notice I will make
[1:36:38] you you might have been taught this
[1:36:40] trade how to fish and all those things
[1:36:42] out there but I will make you Fishers of
[1:36:46] Men amen and that would come when the
[1:36:50] life of God would come on the inside of
[1:36:52] them it moved down in their lives Now
[1:36:55] watch how this worked now they begin to
[1:36:58] cast their Nets remember they were
[1:37:01] working right there within Jerusalem and
[1:37:03] finally God had to allow a persecution
[1:37:06] to come about that would cause them
[1:37:11] to to disperse not Divide from one
[1:37:14] another not go away and say I tell you I
[1:37:17] don't I don't believe the way he was
[1:37:17] doing I no no no they they would they
[1:37:20] would have stayed together in a communal
[1:37:23] way
[1:37:24] if I can say it like this they might
[1:37:26] have been living in the same apartment
[1:37:28] building that's right they might have
[1:37:30] been living in the same Hotel
[1:37:32] complex they weren't but you understand
[1:37:34] what I'm saying but God God they were
[1:37:37] comfortable where they
[1:37:39] were but God knew this gospel has got to
[1:37:44] get
[1:37:45] dispersed how do you think when you read
[1:37:47] First Peter chapter 1 when Peter could
[1:37:49] write to the elect that are in capadia
[1:37:53] to the elect that are here and here and
[1:37:54] here how did it happen because it was
[1:37:57] spread and God took a trial a deep
[1:38:01] persecution and what Satan thought he
[1:38:04] was going to Stamp Out the only thing it
[1:38:06] did was caused it to
[1:38:08] spread that's the same thing that took
[1:38:10] place on Calvary when he thought he had
[1:38:12] him he thought I've got him now but then
[1:38:15] when he got down there he said I thought
[1:38:17] I had you when I got Abel I thought I
[1:38:19] had you when I got Isaiah I thought I
[1:38:21] had you when I got Ezekiel but I want to
[1:38:23] tell you after the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:25] went to the lowest part of hell and
[1:38:29] deposited our sins as the scapegoat he
[1:38:32] came moving right back up through hell
[1:38:35] as a Victorious Champion he went
[1:38:38] wrenched over and he took the keys off
[1:38:41] of Satan's
[1:38:42] side Satan don't even have a key to his
[1:38:45] own
[1:38:46] house if you can see that tonight he
[1:38:49] doesn't have any authority over your
[1:38:52] life
[1:38:55] Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth
[1:38:58] is given into my hands and he sent back
[1:39:02] the Holy Ghost he placed that that
[1:39:05] victory in the hands of the
[1:39:08] believer
[1:39:11] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:18] hallelujah here that
[1:39:22] dispersing he that coming on up and the
[1:39:25] depositing of that life oh Satan thought
[1:39:29] he had it but here it spread oh Lord
[1:39:31] have mercy it got
[1:39:33] loose then on the day of Pentecost when
[1:39:36] that life came
[1:39:39] down brother Bram tells us when they
[1:39:42] were filled with the Holy
[1:39:45] Ghost beginning a beginning and ending
[1:39:47] of Gentile dispensation brother Bram
[1:39:49] says Satan didn't even get out of his
[1:39:51] bed that morning
[1:39:53] when they were filled with the Holy
[1:39:55] Ghost see we would think oh Lord have
[1:39:58] mercy Satan he no no brother B said he
[1:40:00] didn't get out his bed but when they
[1:40:02] came to the gate called
[1:40:04] Beautiful brother BR said that's where
[1:40:07] Satan got upset that's why the prophet
[1:40:10] said you watch any any any move of
[1:40:14] Divine Healing he said it'll bring out
[1:40:16] the Rogue hounds of hell oh yeah they
[1:40:19] got after him why you were they
[1:40:21] recognized here was a man that has sat
[1:40:23] here all these years and begged year
[1:40:26] after year after year after year after
[1:40:28] year but
[1:40:29] now by the faith of Jesus Christ this
[1:40:34] man that has been in this condition all
[1:40:37] of his life he was born this way but the
[1:40:40] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ moving
[1:40:43] through ignorant
[1:40:46] unlearned men that was sensitive enough
[1:40:50] to yield to God and to look at a
[1:40:52] situation and say Silver and Gold Have i
[1:40:56] n but such as I
[1:40:59] have glory be to God such as you have
[1:41:03] such as what God has deposited in your
[1:41:06] life I'm telling you it's more than
[1:41:11] enough little widow woman it's more than
[1:41:15] enough Lord when the little wiow woman
[1:41:17] in the time of Elisha they were come to
[1:41:20] credit her come to take her sons she
[1:41:22] didn't real realiz what she had in her
[1:41:25] house was going to be her
[1:41:28] Deliverance are you with me it took a
[1:41:31] prophet a need arose and a prophet came
[1:41:34] and pointed out you've already got the
[1:41:36] answer you just need to empty
[1:41:39] up Hallelujah go borrow empty vessels
[1:41:43] how many you say Lord I'm ready to empty
[1:41:45] every every channel of my life the
[1:41:48] answer that I need the answer for life's
[1:41:50] problems the answer for every situation
[1:41:53] that's why the prophet said healing is
[1:41:56] within
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:42:05] you they would cast The Net as Fishers
[1:42:07] of Men remember Jer Jesus said the
[1:42:10] kingdom of heaven was like a great net
[1:42:14] right when you're casting a net when
[1:42:16] Peter and them they understood that they
[1:42:18] had they they wanted fish but sometimes
[1:42:20] when they casted a net they may got a
[1:42:23] serpent in there they may got a spider
[1:42:24] in there they may got all kinds of
[1:42:26] things but you know what you don't you
[1:42:27] don't stop fishing because there's
[1:42:31] serpents are you hearing me the prophet
[1:42:34] said the net never changed one thing the
[1:42:38] net only brought in the fish that were
[1:42:40] already fish if it was a serpent it came
[1:42:44] in under the influence of the meeting
[1:42:46] but you give it time it'll crawl back
[1:42:48] out you don't got to run it out it'll
[1:42:50] crawl out right right
[1:42:53] now just go ahead and put the devil off
[1:42:55] your shoulder you say Brother Sam you
[1:42:56] know how many times I felt like giving
[1:42:58] up but you
[1:42:59] couldn't but you
[1:43:01] couldn't there's many times you got
[1:43:03] disappointed in yourself but you
[1:43:05] couldn't give up cuz you want to know
[1:43:07] why you can't stop something you didn't
[1:43:10] start put that right back in the devil's
[1:43:13] Noggin I didn't start this work this
[1:43:16] desire in my heart for almighty
[1:43:19] God hallelujah oh there's times we may
[1:43:22] entertain all kinds of doubt and
[1:43:24] different things but there is a heart of
[1:43:26] a winner let me just say this to you
[1:43:29] what was once in God's mind he has
[1:43:32] placed this in the heart of the believer
[1:43:37] Hallelujah and look how our heavenly
[1:43:41] father conducted himself amen through
[1:43:44] all sorts of obstacles being
[1:43:47] misunderstood ridiculed spit on mocked
[1:43:51] but what was it it was the heart of a
[1:43:56] winner you love
[1:43:59] him oh my oh glory be to God it's our
[1:44:04] it's his life moving in us it's his
[1:44:08] heart
[1:44:09] yeah it's the heart of winning let me
[1:44:12] leave you with this with this
[1:44:14] quote the heart of
[1:44:17] winning let this mind be in
[1:44:20] you which was also in Christ Jesus yeah
[1:44:25] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:44:28] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:44:32] made
[1:44:33] himself of no
[1:44:35] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:44:40] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:44:44] of men and being found in fashion as a
[1:44:48] man as if that wasn't enough he humbled
[1:44:52] himself
[1:44:53] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:44:57] even the death of the
[1:44:59] Cross imagine whatever would be shirt
[1:45:02] whatever dress whatever it is that you
[1:45:03] would have that would be the most maybe
[1:45:05] humiliating in terms of maybe it's
[1:45:06] something you you wouldn't even feel
[1:45:08] like that would be worthy to wear at a
[1:45:09] church or whatever more it might be
[1:45:10] something you'd work in around the house
[1:45:12] or whatever more but here you would
[1:45:15] would so Adorn yourself in that way and
[1:45:19] You' say I'm not going to wear that to
[1:45:21] church I won't tell you there's actually
[1:45:23] a quote where brother bam actually would
[1:45:25] have a certain night where they would
[1:45:27] call Humble night and he would tell them
[1:45:29] wear your work Clos to church tonight
[1:45:31] cuz I'm going to preach in my
[1:45:33] overhauls he said we're calling it
[1:45:35] humble
[1:45:39] night that's an actual quote you know so
[1:45:42] I I've got a quote for it but I don't
[1:45:43] mean I'm going to wear overhauls but you
[1:45:45] know I mean you you got to get what I'm
[1:45:46] saying my point was is this as if it
[1:45:50] wasn't enough that he took upon
[1:45:53] our
[1:45:54] Humanity that he became one of us but
[1:45:57] then even he went
[1:46:00] lower he became a footwash flunky but he
[1:46:04] went even lower he humbled himself to
[1:46:08] the death of the
[1:46:10] Cross right what was once a
[1:46:13] type where we hear this man this cry
[1:46:18] coming up the
[1:46:20] hill and it's Abel leading his sacrifice
[1:46:24] that's been revealed to
[1:46:27] him what was once a type now here's the
[1:46:31] anot type the perfect Lamb of God going
[1:46:35] up the hill right and there as he's on
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:39] cross Cries
[1:46:41] Out speaking in
[1:46:44] tongues think about this character let
[1:46:47] me leave this here with you when you
[1:46:49] think of that that scripture
[1:46:54] I want you to think brother BR says
[1:46:55] there was no beauty that we should
[1:46:57] desire him he was
[1:47:00] marred above every man that's Isaiah 52
[1:47:04] he was probably a little skinny spiny
[1:47:06] looking fellow he didn't look like the
[1:47:09] king many times people will judge people
[1:47:11] by the way they dress or by their
[1:47:13] stature but man's not judged by how big
[1:47:15] he is and how strong his muscles but
[1:47:17] man's judged by character and character
[1:47:18] alone I've seen men that weighed 200 lb
[1:47:21] and didn't have an ounce of man in them
[1:47:22] man is judged by character what he is in
[1:47:28] his heart and Christ was not judged by
[1:47:32] physical strength but he was judged by
[1:47:34] character and never a man ever Liv like
[1:47:37] him or never a man could ever die like
[1:47:40] him never a man could Ascend up on high
[1:47:43] like him because he was God I am no man
[1:47:47] he made of himself no reputation he said
[1:47:50] did you ever think the man that made an
[1:47:52] artificial eye made a reputation the man
[1:47:54] that made false teeth made a reputation
[1:47:57] the man that made a wooden arm made a
[1:47:59] reputation for himself but the man who
[1:48:02] made the original eye the man who made
[1:48:04] the original arm made of himself no
[1:48:07] reputation but become a servant a
[1:48:11] bondsman unto men who were Sinners that
[1:48:15] he might win them
[1:48:21] back what wasn't it just a given that
[1:48:25] our names were on the Lamb's Book of
[1:48:28] Life our names were on the Lamb's Book
[1:48:30] of Life but the scripture tells
[1:48:33] us I have come the son of man has come
[1:48:37] to seek and save that which was
[1:48:46] lost the heart of a winner right aren't
[1:48:50] you thankful sure
[1:48:53] aren't you thankful for that life
[1:48:56] amen to think about how that God would
[1:48:59] have us to move and apply this in our
[1:49:02] own lives through so many different
[1:49:04] things there's so many things and so
[1:49:07] many points and places within life this
[1:49:09] is just one of them on winning others to
[1:49:13] the Lord we're not trying to like the
[1:49:16] prophet said in Christ The Mystery of
[1:49:17] God revealed when he said he said some
[1:49:20] people think that we convert people to
[1:49:23] Christianity by its laws we don't do
[1:49:26] that the way a full conversion is is by
[1:49:29] the new birth that's right and you know
[1:49:31] what I can't give that to nobody the
[1:49:33] life is here in the body right the life
[1:49:36] is in the body the life will travel
[1:49:37] through the body right but do you
[1:49:39] realize that's between God and the
[1:49:42] individual that's between and so it it
[1:49:44] really it brings it down to where we
[1:49:46] ended last week it's not our
[1:49:48] responsibility to open anybody's eyes
[1:49:51] you know what that should do it ought to
[1:49:53] just take the pressure off and just say
[1:49:54] Lord whatever you want me to
[1:49:57] drop you don't have to drop a whole
[1:49:59] cargo load at one time just drop a
[1:50:01] little
[1:50:02] bit so you don't have to go and drop a
[1:50:04] whole thing and hey I'm going to drop
[1:50:06] maybe God ain't having you drop
[1:50:08] something like that right now maybe God
[1:50:09] is just having you drop a
[1:50:12] song True a
[1:50:15] testimony maybe God's maybe God's having
[1:50:18] you to drop a prayer and say Hey you
[1:50:22] mind if I pray with you maybe they've
[1:50:24] got a need they're expressing right well
[1:50:26] brother Samuel they're sitting there in
[1:50:27] short hair I don't care if they're
[1:50:28] sitting there in short hair and got on
[1:50:30] short britches they are a human being
[1:50:34] that Christ died
[1:50:36] for you and I were in worse shape than
[1:50:40] many of
[1:50:41] them God help us not to get so up here
[1:50:45] and to realize we're missing the Mark if
[1:50:48] he would have stayed up there that would
[1:50:50] not have been the heart of a winner but
[1:50:52] the heart of a winner came right down to
[1:50:54] where I was and I am so glad I am so
[1:50:58] glad brother Aaron he comes right where
[1:51:00] I'm at right now tonight I'm glad the
[1:51:02] heart of a winner don't look over and

[1:51:08] have I dealt with you on this I've sent
[1:51:11] Minister after Minister I've ran quote
[1:51:13] aren't you glad that a heart of a winner

[1:51:22] passing of things oh that was just
[1:51:24] brother so and so oh that was just so
[1:51:26] and so who sent me that text or that

[1:51:30] winner amen is temperent hallelujah in
[1:51:33] all things cuz remember the prophet
[1:51:36] tells us God would not ask you and I to
[1:51:38] do something that he himself would not
[1:51:41] be willing to do and I'll tell you this
[1:51:43] right here for me I'll just speak for me
[1:51:46] he's temperate in a lot of
[1:51:48] things I couldn't even list him I

[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:10] tonight Lord sometimes we don't mean
[1:53:15] to sometimes Lord with certain things we
[1:53:18] can get
[1:53:20] complacent sometimes we can get weary
[1:53:24] sometimes Lord we can feel
[1:53:26] insufficient sometimes Lord we can get
[1:53:28] caught up and looking at failures and
[1:53:31] mistakes and we get to entertaining
[1:53:33] doubt and other
[1:53:35] things but I'm Lord I just want to say
[1:53:37] this I'm so glad I'm part of the body of
[1:53:40] Jesus
[1:53:41] Christ oh
[1:53:43] God I'm so thankful Lord that as we come
[1:53:47] here there's been times Lord
[1:53:49] where I've been down but but Lord God as
[1:53:53] your presence has moved there's been
[1:53:54] others that
[1:53:55] came as
[1:53:57] priests and they begin to
[1:54:00] worship Lord God is even in my heart I
[1:54:03] would be pressing pressing
[1:54:06] Beyond but Lord they would begin to
[1:54:09] worship worshiping the beauty of your
[1:54:12] Holiness songs of Zion would begin to Be
[1:54:15] Sung and then Lord things would begin to
[1:54:18] just start breaking there would be a
[1:54:20] strength that would just move in Lord
[1:54:23] father I've witnessed it Lord just while
[1:54:26] I've been ministering the
[1:54:28] word it's not a one-way
[1:54:31] current no it's true that the pillar of
[1:54:34] fire it flows right here Lord from the
[1:54:36] front but Lord God it moves through the
[1:54:38] body your Prophet told us like this when
[1:54:41] he spoke to that congregation he said I
[1:54:44] I can see it as the words going forth I
[1:54:46] begin to see the glow come across your
[1:54:49] life and he said as that glow comes
[1:54:51] across your life as you're receiving
[1:54:53] that word he said then it comes back to
[1:54:55] me he said and I begin to feed and I
[1:54:57] begin to take from that oh God you come
[1:55:01] Lord to minister to all of our
[1:55:05] needs yeah
[1:55:08] Lord my heart has been
[1:55:12] challenged our hearts have been
[1:55:14] challenged Lord yes
[1:55:16] sir when we can look and see the heart
[1:55:21] of a winner Hallelujah to know like your
[1:55:24] Prophet told us in Christ the mystery
[1:55:26] what was once in God's mind that great
[1:55:30] secret he has now placed it in the heart
[1:55:35] of the
[1:55:36] believer oh
[1:55:38] lord it's the
[1:55:41] secret the secret that moves in our
[1:55:45] life that reality that it keeps
[1:55:49] moving Lord even as you're unfolding in
[1:55:53] to us in our lives through
[1:55:57] us we recognize ourselves Sons and
[1:56:00] Daughters of
[1:56:02] God Lord I Thank here the other day as I
[1:56:05] was
[1:56:07] talking just fellowshipping with brother
[1:56:09] Homer Lord he called me on the phone and
[1:56:11] we're fellowshipping there L Lord the
[1:56:13] other night here and begin to talk about
[1:56:16] that quote of how
[1:56:18] that a son of God's like an eagle that
[1:56:20] can go a long time before it wreck
[1:56:22] recognizes it's a Son of God we begin to
[1:56:25] Fellowship upon that and I said you
[1:56:26] realize those are things like that that
[1:56:29] even after the New Birth has come that
[1:56:32] that
[1:56:33] realization is what really begins to
[1:56:35] move in our life and it only becomes
[1:56:39] deeper Lord we don't start out as
[1:56:42] perfect people like we're looking at
[1:56:43] this stature of a perfect
[1:56:45] man we grow we grow up as the Bible
[1:56:50] says into you in all
[1:56:54] things now
[1:56:57] Lord like your Prophet I read at the
[1:57:00] beginning where he said he had his hands
[1:57:02] up and said Lord I
[1:57:04] pledge with this congregation not to
[1:57:07] cease until I
[1:57:09] see these virtues flowing in my life as
[1:57:13] they should that I can be a living
[1:57:16] manifestation of
[1:57:19] Christ Lord when I look at that here is
[1:57:21] standing and
[1:57:23] 1962 think of the display but it just
[1:57:26] goes to show us
[1:57:28] Lord father the bait that was on the
[1:57:31] hook with Divine Healing your Prophet
[1:57:33] would tell us there in one in a million
[1:57:35] in many places there was a message that
[1:57:38] was to
[1:57:40] follow Lord here we stand as the Bride
[1:57:42] of Jesus Christ and when the seals are
[1:57:44] open your Prophet told us it's a
[1:57:47] loosening of a
[1:57:50] Ministry I read realize Lord many times
[1:57:54] it's only read down Revelations 10 and
[1:57:56] it stops at Revelations 10:7 but that's
[1:57:59] not where you
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:03] stopped right after verse 7 it's verse
[1:58:08] 8 that
[1:58:10] thou go unto the angel whose foot is on
[1:58:15] the land and the
[1:58:17] Sea go and take the little book that is
[1:58:20] open in his hand
[1:58:23] and eat
[1:58:25] it it will be sweet in your mouth oh how
[1:58:30] wonderful how
[1:58:32] precious but in your belly when it comes
[1:58:35] time to digest it to live it it'll be
[1:58:40] bitter there'll be all kinds of turning
[1:58:42] because it will not
[1:58:46] agree with what our character has
[1:58:50] been but Lord the
[1:58:54] word is
[1:58:56] Victorious and I pray father
[1:58:59] God as we lord just continue to take in
[1:59:02] of that word and Lord work in my life
[1:59:05] Lord dear God as that word gets down in
[1:59:08] my life and oh that that bitter that oh
[1:59:11] that churning that's in there it's the
[1:59:14] word that is
[1:59:16] working to cast out all
[1:59:20] unbelief it's the word that is working
[1:59:23] to
[1:59:25] dismantle every
[1:59:28] hold every
[1:59:30] hindrance every
[1:59:33] complex every bruise glory be to God the
[1:59:37] word is working Lord Jesus it's a power
[1:59:41] of
[1:59:42] transformation for thou must prophesy
[1:59:49] again before many kings peoples Nations
[1:59:54] and
[1:59:55] tongues God help
[1:59:57] [Music]
[1:59:59] us I realize Lord
[2:00:02] that you didn't call us all to be
[2:00:06] preachers but we are what you have
[2:00:08] ordained for us to be there's no big
[2:00:11] eyes and little use sometimes Lord we
[2:00:13] can think of who's on the platform or

[2:01:50] cost it cost
[2:01:53] you your only begotten
[2:01:56] son but I think of it as your Prophet
[2:02:00] would say it over and over again he
[2:02:01] would say to think if I had a little
[2:02:03] vial
[2:02:04] filled with just a few drops of the
[2:02:07] literal blood of the Lord
[2:02:10] Jesus he said to think how precious that
[2:02:13] would be I would hold it up to my
[2:02:15] bosom but he said to realize I have
[2:02:19] something greater in front of me tonight
[2:02:22] night than his
[2:02:24] blood because he was willing to shed his
[2:02:29] blood for you for me oh Lord
