[43:51] Shane so I really appreciate that how he

[44:02] Fellowship yes amen don't you love to to
[44:06] hear from others yes sir amen and to
[44:08] just hear what God is doing in different
[44:11] lives and it's just it's something so
[44:12] special about getting together amen well
[44:17] let's read here in in Luke chapter 18
[44:19] and verse
[44:21] 9 the Lord Jesus is speaking here on
[44:24] prayer and he says in verse nine
[44:27] and he spake this Parable unto certain
[44:31] which trusted in
[44:34] themselves that they were
[44:37] righteous and
[44:39] despised
[44:42] others two men went up into the temple
[44:45] to pray the one a Pharisee and the other
[44:48] a
[44:49] Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed
[44:52] thus with
[44:54] himself notice he went praying to God
[44:58] he was praying with
[45:00] himself that's good God I thank thee
[45:05] that I am not as other men are wow what
[45:09] a way to
[45:12] pray
[45:14] extortioners
[45:15] unjust adulterers or even as this
[45:21] Publican you know we may not use those
[45:24] words in that way
[45:27] but if we pray for other needs in a way
[45:30] to where we look down on others that's
[45:35] the same thing there you go yes sir it's
[45:38] it's how we're praying that remember
[45:40] brother B would tell us there with the
[45:41] message the token it's very something
[45:44] that is very very simple but remember he
[45:46] says that we apply that token with love
[45:49] and consideration believing it is going
[45:53] to take in effect that's what's going to
[45:56] take in effect on
[45:58] lives verse 12 I fast twice in the week
[46:03] I give tithes of all that I possess and
[46:06] the Publican standing AAR off would not
[46:09] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[46:13] but smokee upon his breast saying God be
[46:16] merciful to me a
[46:19] sinner and you know that's that that's
[46:21] all he had to do it's when God when God
[46:24] touches a heart when a heart just is
[46:26] completely
[46:27] surrendering to God Lord I'm nothing
[46:31] without you lord lord be merciful unto
[46:34] me I tell you this man went down to his
[46:37] house Justified rather than the other
[46:41] for everyone that exalteth himself shall
[46:45] be a based and he that humbleth himself
[46:49] shall be
[46:51] exalted amen may God bless you and bless
[46:54] the reading of the word as you're being
[46:55] seated
[46:57] I'd like to uh go ahead I'd like to
[47:01] speak once again and moving into that on
[47:05] overcoming hindrances and just within
[47:09] the the subtleness and if the Lord will
[47:11] help
[47:12] us I thought I might be able to get out
[47:15] of this of Pride today and get into
[47:17] another point but uh just how the Lord
[47:20] has has taken it and we'll just we'll
[47:22] look at it and see but I I want to just
[47:25] just hone in upon these thoughts of it
[47:27] because when we're looking at hindrances
[47:30] we're looking and I want you to think of
[47:32] it as the Lord's been taking us through
[47:33] this with traps and things that traps
[47:36] are not things that are are noticeable
[47:39] they're not things that allog together
[47:41] that that stand out or else they
[47:43] wouldn't be a trap but a trap is meant
[47:45] to to capture sometimes you can capture
[47:48] a person for a period of time and what
[47:50] it is is to hold us back from the
[47:54] promises that God has committed to our
[47:57] lives sometimes the way that those traps
[48:00] would work you know it can work to where
[48:02] that it'll hinder a person from where
[48:04] that as they're on their walk and their
[48:06] Journey with God and they can just get
[48:09] just get hindered in a way to where
[48:10] they're they're not going all the way as
[48:13] they as they should and what God is
[48:15] drawing in their life begin to wonder
[48:16] what's taking place and you know let me
[48:19] just say this that Satan's duty is
[48:22] always to try to throw us off track in
[48:24] any way that he can he'll use so so many
[48:27] different things to try to to try to
[48:29] come at us you know uh sometimes he can
[48:31] use things of of family he can use a lot
[48:33] of other things and just I want you to
[48:35] understand this it's the simplest of
[48:38] things that if he can do just enough to
[48:40] sort of take and change our attitude
[48:43] about things and it can just begin to
[48:45] affect and how that we're looking even
[48:47] at other things it actually hinders the
[48:49] working of the Holy Spirit from moving
[48:52] further in our lives cuz he the holy
[48:54] spirit is gentle he's a dove is that
[48:58] right when God represented himself in
[49:01] that he represented not only in that of
[49:04] the Lamb of the meekest of all the
[49:05] Earthly creatures but the Heavenly
[49:07] Creatures the dove is the meekest of all
[49:09] and he represented within that and so
[49:13] then there is also the part that even as
[49:15] we in our walk with God and after God
[49:18] has done such a full work within our
[49:20] lives our Nature has been changed but
[49:22] there is continually ongoing uh in our
[49:25] walk with God we realize that we have
[49:27] been uh ordained to to walk as as a
[49:31] channel to walk as an available uh uh
[49:34] Source unto God when he said I am the
[49:37] vine ye are the branches and without me
[49:40] you can do nothing and so God's in
[49:42] desire is that we would be as as as the
[49:45] branches that he through his life moving
[49:48] through us would bring forth the fruit
[49:51] that he desires to bring forth and Satan
[49:54] remember if there's anything he can do
[49:56] to to hinder that in any way uh he'll
[49:59] he'll do that and we we you know we can
[50:02] we can be content with a place of
[50:04] looking at and saying well I know that
[50:06] you know I I no longer I don't desire
[50:08] the things of the world and I know that
[50:10] you know my in in in my life I I know
[50:13] that where I'm standing walking with the
[50:15] word of God but yet when when we're when
[50:18] we're looking that within our lives
[50:21] sometimes we can become complacent in in
[50:23] our walk and not recognizing that you
[50:26] know God's wanting to do so much more
[50:28] there's so much more that God wants to
[50:31] bring forth and wants to move within our
[50:33] lives and and we can start to you know
[50:36] just kind of become acceptive of just
[50:39] I'm just going to be average but let me
[50:40] just tell you there's really no such
[50:42] thing is average because the scripture
[50:45] tells us in the Book of Revelations
[50:47] concerning this age that we're living in
[50:50] it's G the Lord Jesus speaks in that age
[50:53] the amen and he says I would that thou
[50:56] word hot or cold that's right I don't
[51:00] want you to be lukewarm I want you to be
[51:02] on fire or be cold you got to be one or
[51:06] the other why why would he say it that
[51:08] way because we would look and say well
[51:09] lukewarm is at least you know it's it's
[51:11] closer to hot but Luke wars in the
[51:13] middle and and that's and that that can
[51:15] be the greatest trouble for a life that
[51:18] and brother Bri would actually say it
[51:19] like this he says we find the greatest
[51:21] trouble Among Us is trying to live
[51:23] between two different desires and it can
[51:26] become such a you know such a pull and
[51:28] such a trying to walk a balance but you
[51:31] know what a blessing it is that not only
[51:33] when we can give ourselves fully to the
[51:36] Lord but then also just allowing the
[51:38] word every day and it just look it's
[51:41] just real simple in a way of just saying
[51:43] God examine my life if there's anything
[51:47] that's out of line in me Lord Lord I
[51:51] want it to be straightened out guide me
[51:53] Lord to that to that place if whatever
[51:56] if there's anything that's hindering you
[51:58] from working in my life Lord forgive me
[52:01] show me Lord I I don't want to be I
[52:03] don't want things to be a hindrance I
[52:05] want you to have the right away and I
[52:08] think that's the greatest desire and
[52:10] when I I look here at this uh this
[52:13] setting that we've read from here today
[52:16] and we look at how that God can take
[52:18] just an example of one person that can
[52:21] come before the Throne of God and God
[52:24] can take this I mean it can be a life
[52:27] that God will touch right in a service
[52:29] and they surrender their lives and their
[52:31] hearts to God and and when they do that
[52:33] their life has been changed but then you
[52:37] can take you know where others a person
[52:40] can look and they look and think well
[52:42] you know I'm pretty good and and the
[52:43] Holy Spirit dealing with their life and
[52:45] you know telling them you know calling
[52:47] them to a to a deeper walk and you know
[52:50] God does that he could call things out
[52:52] sometimes in his Mercy he'll call things
[52:54] out specifically then there other times
[52:57] he doesn't call it out specifically in
[52:59] in as far as across the congregation but
[53:02] it's just a way that you and I know he's
[53:04] dealing with us personally and we know
[53:07] exactly where he's going in our life
[53:10] it's almost as though it's wrote on the
[53:11] screen and there's a map to it but yet
[53:14] it's so personal yes it is and and God
[53:17] he works in a in such a manner like that
[53:20] but what it matters is is then what we
[53:22] do with that at that point of do we at
[53:25] that moment say Lord Lord I Surrender
[53:27] Lord I give myself to you lord lord be
[53:31] merciful to me because truly it's his
[53:33] mercies that would even make known to us
[53:37] our
[53:38] weaknesses friends I I I want to be
[53:41] ready that to me the Rapture is what
[53:43] means everything we are living in the
[53:46] end time we are living in the hour to
[53:49] where we're not looking for promises to
[53:52] be made this is the hour for every
[53:55] promise to be for fulfilled we're living
[53:58] in the end time we we we've received our
[54:00] last sign we're we're standing with the
[54:03] last message and here the Holy Spirit
[54:05] right among us there is nothing greater
[54:08] to
[54:10] come there is certainly more of him and
[54:15] more of his life to come into us he's
[54:18] but he's right here Among Us in other
[54:20] words we have access to all that we have
[54:24] need of in order to be ready for the
[54:29] Rapture and so I want to just start out
[54:32] with it looking at like this there's
[54:34] always a right criteria to judge and
[54:36] examine our lives and I'm just telling
[54:38] you this takes to be able to stand and
[54:41] to look at the word of God and to allow
[54:44] the word to examine Our Lives we as
[54:46] Priests of God we want to stand before
[54:49] the urum we want to stand as they did in
[54:52] the Old Testament and recognize this is
[54:54] God's urum that God has Vindicated this
[54:58] word he's made it alive and not the
[55:01] thoughts of man but I want to know Lord
[55:03] even with situations and things that
[55:05] would be uh coming to my life I want to
[55:08] know what you think about it Lord amen I
[55:10] want to see what you think about I want
[55:12] to see do the lights light up on the
[55:15] word of God is it something that I have
[55:17] to make an excuse for or Reason out I
[55:20] tell you we're living in an hour where
[55:22] reasonings are to be cast down we're
[55:25] living in an hour that where there's a
[55:27] there's a people upon Earth to be able
[55:29] to rise into a place to say God I want
[55:32] the word at all
[55:35] cost I want to live and walk in the
[55:38] victory that God has provided for me at
[55:41] all cost how many know it's going to
[55:44] cost something it'll cost more it's re
[55:47] more is required of us now than it was
[55:50] even a month ago even a year
[55:52] ago more I'm not talking about
[55:56] necessarily more works I'm talking about
[55:58] more yielding more diligence more
[56:02] sincerity you see even when we we look
[56:05] at this here uh uh in the message of
[56:08] prisoner I want you to watch how brother
[56:09] Bram takes this he says don't judge your
[56:11] life by how much power you have to
[56:14] perform
[56:15] Miracles right we don't judge ourselves
[56:18] by how much knowledge you have of the
[56:20] word but always judge yourself look back
[56:26] and taking inventory of what kind of a
[56:29] fruit that the life you presently live
[56:32] now is bearing that's 1 Corinthians
[56:36] 13 is that right then you can speak with
[56:39] tongues of men and angels and not have
[56:41] the love of God the love of God is the
[56:43] Holy Ghost it's the word of God is that
[56:47] right then the same thing we're having
[56:49] such a knowledge of the word of God yet
[56:52] without the love of God it's nothing
[56:56] the love of God is everything and the
[56:58] love of God it's not our human love it's
[57:02] God's love it's the Holy Spirit coming
[57:05] down and changing our love our human
[57:08] love can only go to a certain level
[57:10] right right it it can only go there but
[57:13] one came down from glory in order by
[57:16] Divine love in order to express his love
[57:20] the Bible said he commended his love
[57:22] towards you and I he projected his love
[57:25] to you and I he demonstrated his love he
[57:28] he who was not
[57:31] guilty the worthy one took upon my sin
[57:35] my
[57:36] shame thank you jesuses I mean friends
[57:40] look you couldn't put a finger on his
[57:43] life true you couldn't put one finger on
[57:46] his life so him he was indeed the
[57:49] promised lamb the Messiah and he took
[57:51] upon
[57:53] willingly think about it he took upon
[57:55] the whole sins of the world present past
[57:59] and
[58:00] future he knew every mistake you would
[58:03] ever make thank you he knew every
[58:05] failure you'd ever have thank you he
[58:08] knew he listen because this the lamb was
[58:11] slay Revelations 138 in the mind of God
[58:15] before the foundation of the
[58:17] world that's where the sons of God were
[58:20] shouting for Joy when God took job back
[58:24] from his trial and said let let me show
[58:26] you what is above and beyond the
[58:28] situation you're in he took him back to
[58:31] his mind and showed him when the sons of
[58:35] God were shouting for Joy you know what
[58:37] he showed job he showed job that your
[58:39] destiny is certain because of your
[58:44] origin so the in between is not going to
[58:48] change where you come from or where
[58:49] you're
[58:50] going it's going to be there's going to
[58:52] be some hard Pathways along the way but
[58:55] what were you shouting about we were
[58:57] shouting because we saw th salvation in
[59:01] the Lamb of
[59:03] God you say how can I say that that see
[59:06] that the same way that you can see
[59:09] yourself in Christ now you come into His
[59:12] Spirit into his being that was there
[59:15] before the foundation of the world and
[59:17] it's come all the way down that's right
[59:21] and the part of that salvation was to
[59:23] see as the prophet goes on to say the
[59:26] embodiment of deity once again in
[59:29] humanity praise the Lord so always
[59:32] judging always judging ourselves Looking
[59:35] Back Now I don't know I don't think any
[59:37] one of us that's really comfortable to
[59:40] look over and examine our lives for
[59:44] errors I mean I every time I ever read a
[59:46] wrote a paper for school when I wrote it
[59:49] you know you're correct I mean at least
[59:50] when you're now typing in on computer I
[59:52] felt really good about it then you had
[59:55] to take it in for peer
[59:56] review you take it into peer peer review
[59:59] and then you had somebody else reading
[1:00:01] it and and what's incredible is that
[1:00:04] sometimes the way that we could read
[1:00:06] things we will read in words that we
[1:00:08] didn't put there yeah that's right
[1:00:10] that's good and somebody else begins to
[1:00:12] look at and say hey you're missing a
[1:00:14] thought here and and you jump from here
[1:00:16] to there and it all makes sense to us
[1:00:18] but then when it comes under a peer
[1:00:19] review but let me just say this to you
[1:00:21] and I we're not under the review of one
[1:00:25] another yeah yeah right that's why Paul
[1:00:27] said it's a light thing if I be judged
[1:00:29] of
[1:00:30] you I I I'm being judged and I've got to
[1:00:33] stand before him on that day it's the
[1:00:36] word right now that's judging our lives
[1:00:39] but to look back over our lives and and
[1:00:41] really look and say God and looking back
[1:00:43] through our lives and you know what
[1:00:44] friends if not for God's grace we
[1:00:47] wouldn't even really be able to look
[1:00:49] back over our lives in the right way
[1:00:52] yeah yeah that's right you know what
[1:00:54] this is about honesty yeah come on now
[1:00:57] we're living we're living in an hour
[1:00:58] where the anointing has it's galing upon
[1:01:01] this age and there is there is a lack of
[1:01:04] honesty oh sometimes even in not telling
[1:01:08] people the truth that they need to
[1:01:11] hear that's so good yes patting them on
[1:01:14] the back the Bible said they have
[1:01:16] itching
[1:01:17] ears but but honesty I'm talking about
[1:01:19] honesty honesty that that when I'm
[1:01:22] talking about this is honesty it comes
[1:01:24] from God's Own Heart I I've got to get
[1:01:26] moving here on this but you know there's
[1:01:28] a there's a tension I'm trying to get to
[1:01:30] a point here there is a criteria and
[1:01:33] there's a tension that rises in our
[1:01:35] hearts as Believers when God has gotten
[1:01:38] a hold of your life before God got a
[1:01:40] hold of your life you and I were SLO
[1:01:42] alongs yeah that's that's so true we
[1:01:45] just slap alongs but when God got a hold
[1:01:47] of your life got a hold of my life then
[1:01:50] there comes a tension in our lives
[1:01:53] that's good and that tension that comes
[1:01:55] is like like the belt that's that's upon
[1:01:58] the the pulley in your car that drive
[1:02:00] belt if a pulley goes bad or a belt goes
[1:02:03] bad I don't care how how nice the
[1:02:05] vehicle looks it ain't going nowhere it
[1:02:08] ain't going nowhere I don't care I don't
[1:02:09] care you can have all the heated seats
[1:02:10] you want you can have where it would you
[1:02:12] know all you can have all the specs you
[1:02:14] want but it's got to have that
[1:02:16] tension and that tension itself is is
[1:02:20] where that every moment the prophet says
[1:02:23] am I pleasing my Lord oh if I could just
[1:02:27] hear from him yeah I don't know about
[1:02:30] you but that's how I feel yeah Lord if I
[1:02:32] can just hear from you if I haven't
[1:02:34] heard from him I I I want to know is
[1:02:36] there something going on Lord is there
[1:02:39] something going on is there something
[1:02:41] that in me I I want to know that he can
[1:02:44] speak and he'll speak to us in a variety
[1:02:46] of ways but I want to hear from
[1:02:48] him if I didn't hear from my wife I
[1:02:51] think something's
[1:02:52] wrong if she didn't hear from me she
[1:02:54] would think something's wrong
[1:02:57] he wants to hear from
[1:02:59] us we're not just
[1:03:03] Affiliates come on friends it's we're
[1:03:06] living in a time where the marriage of
[1:03:08] the Lamb has
[1:03:10] come amen is that right every moment so
[1:03:14] it puts attention on you it puts you on
[1:03:17] guard now watch this that so that's what
[1:03:20] really makes us what we are it's
[1:03:21] attention am I pleasing to my Lord
[1:03:23] that's so good that's so good how Paul
[1:03:26] writes
[1:03:27] this Paul
[1:03:30] said my desire this is Paul's purpose be
[1:03:33] found in him yeah not having my own
[1:03:36] righteousness now this is a man right
[1:03:41] here meeting God face to face he's had a
[1:03:45] true experience with God
[1:03:47] already but look at look at his whole
[1:03:52] demeanor my desire is to be found in him
[1:03:57] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:04:00] of the law but that which is through the
[1:04:03] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[1:04:07] is of god by faith that is so good and
[1:04:10] the faith we're talking about that's
[1:04:12] revelation God revealing himself to you
[1:04:15] and I Lord I want to walk pleasing to
[1:04:19] you Lord my desire Lord show me even
[1:04:21] listen friends just daily it's a simple
[1:04:23] thing even daily as we start our day
[1:04:25] Lord guide my feet today Lord make
[1:04:28] yourself Lord real to me you know what
[1:04:31] lays before me I've got plans but you
[1:04:33] know what is ahead of me Lord my plans
[1:04:36] can always be interrupted by you but you
[1:04:39] also know the decisions that are Before
[1:04:41] Me Guide Me Lord and make Lord make
[1:04:45] yourself more real to me today Lord Lord
[1:04:49] give me more Lord of your spirit today
[1:04:52] Lord God let more of Samuel be in it out
[1:04:56] today Lord
[1:04:59] God that I may know him and the power of
[1:05:02] his resurrection and the fellowship of
[1:05:05] his sufferings being made
[1:05:09] conformable unto his death if by any
[1:05:13] means I might attain unto the
[1:05:15] resurrection of the dead now what Paul
[1:05:18] is speaking of here remember the Bible
[1:05:20] tells us blessed is he and that has part
[1:05:24] in the first resurrection
[1:05:27] I I don't listen let me I I don't want
[1:05:29] to be a part of the second
[1:05:31] Resurrection because the second
[1:05:33] Resurrection is now where it's come
[1:05:35] after the tribulation after the
[1:05:39] Millennium right after their of of the
[1:05:42] of the wedding supper because the
[1:05:44] wedding supper is going on while the
[1:05:45] tribulation taking place three and a
[1:05:47] half years yeah right here we are at the
[1:05:50] wedding supper of the Lamb cuz that's
[1:05:51] for the bride and groom right is that
[1:05:54] right think about it it that while while
[1:05:57] enjoying at the wedding supper of what's
[1:05:59] going to be taking place on Earth listen
[1:06:02] there's little glimpses of it that has
[1:06:05] already been coming down through time
[1:06:08] floods that have taken place you see the
[1:06:10] horrors of of situations where it just
[1:06:13] it's just one thread one threat from
[1:06:16] Anarchy one thread from things just
[1:06:18] turning loose right you say why hasn't
[1:06:21] it because the Bible tells us in the
[1:06:23] book of Thessalonians he that leth will
[1:06:26] let until he be taken out of the way
[1:06:29] it's God that is in
[1:06:32] control amen the Bible tells us that
[1:06:35] that Mighty angel in Revelations 10 he
[1:06:38] descended with an open book he put one
[1:06:40] foot upon the land and one put up on the
[1:06:43] sea is that right raised his hand and he
[1:06:46] swore to him that liveth forever and
[1:06:48] ever that time should be no more so
[1:06:51] there is no beast power that can rise up
[1:06:55] and to take away the Bride of Jesus
[1:06:58] Christ until every name that has been
[1:07:01] written in the lamb section has been
[1:07:03] called brought forth splashed beneath
[1:07:06] the Clorox bleach sealed by the spirit
[1:07:09] of God then the Rapture
[1:07:12] comes and while all of while we're there
[1:07:15] in the wedding supper well friends you
[1:07:17] don't want to miss
[1:07:19] that you say what's the need the wedding
[1:07:22] garment you got to have the token you
[1:07:25] got to have God's own life God's own
[1:07:28] life see that's why we're judging in our
[1:07:30] criteria it's not about things we think
[1:07:33] God the gifts have their place in the
[1:07:35] church but the gifts are not the
[1:07:37] emphasis it's a life that is beating in
[1:07:40] harmony with God's word where there is a
[1:07:43] soul that says Amen to the word of God
[1:07:47] is that right our life Paul Sates Amen
[1:07:50] to the word now think about what a
[1:07:52] contrast what a contrast so this is
[1:07:55] where Paul is talking about in verse 11
[1:07:58] he said I want to be part that's what
[1:07:59] he's saying in verse 11 out of I I don't
[1:08:01] want to remain among the Dead I want to
[1:08:03] be raised out in that first resurrection
[1:08:06] that's my aim that's right what are you
[1:08:09] what are you saying brother Samuel I I
[1:08:11] what I'm saying is you don't find a man
[1:08:14] though he's entered into God's rest but
[1:08:16] he's not living aax life that is so good
[1:08:22] yeah that's such a that's such a balance
[1:08:23] we rest in our soul yes and then we have
[1:08:26] to press because this thing gets lazy
[1:08:29] easy uhhuh yes it gets lazy easy this
[1:08:32] thing gets lazy easy it does that's why
[1:08:35] brother Bram I could give you many
[1:08:36] quotes I give you one quote brother Bram
[1:08:38] said so easy for Christians to get lazy
[1:08:42] and not read and pray as they should now
[1:08:45] when I read quotes like that I don't
[1:08:47] read quotes like that as though that it
[1:08:49] would allow me or to encourage me in a
[1:08:51] certain way it God God drops little
[1:08:54] things along the way way to remind you
[1:08:56] and I you are but flesh I know you are
[1:08:59] but flesh but let me just tell you it's
[1:09:01] my grace that's brought you safe this
[1:09:03] far and it's my grace that's going to
[1:09:05] take you the rest of the way it's my
[1:09:07] grace that's going to deal with your
[1:09:09] life that's going to bring correction to
[1:09:10] your life that's going to even allow you
[1:09:13] to look back over your life and not look
[1:09:15] at it and say I can never I'll never
[1:09:18] make it but be able to look at and say
[1:09:20] Lord I failed here I failed there but
[1:09:23] your Grace has shown me that Lord make
[1:09:26] my footsteps straight Lord before me
[1:09:30] hallelujah hallelujah amen I believe
[1:09:33] that's bride material friends to be able
[1:09:35] to stand and look at the mirror of the
[1:09:37] word and to stand with courage there cuz
[1:09:39] we're promised like Caleb I want to take
[1:09:42] my
[1:09:44] Mountain I'm here to take my mountain
[1:09:46] and I want need to look at the word God
[1:09:48] I want to see every one of those virtues
[1:09:51] operating in my life by the spirit of
[1:09:54] the the Holy Ghost going down in my life
[1:09:56] I want to take my Mountain amen
[1:10:00] hallelujah my I'm trying to get
[1:10:03] somewhere now verse 12 not as though I
[1:10:07] had already
[1:10:09] attained either were already perfect but
[1:10:13] I follow after that means pursue if that
[1:10:16] I may apprehend that for which I am
[1:10:18] apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I
[1:10:22] count means I think not myself to have
[1:10:26] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:10:29] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:10:33] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:10:36] which are
[1:10:38] before how many know there's things you
[1:10:40] got to
[1:10:41] forget and and what I mean forget it's
[1:10:43] not just bury him and ignore him I mean
[1:10:45] take it to the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:48] whatever it is Take It Before the Throne
[1:10:50] of God and say Lord God if anything whe
[1:10:53] if it' be a hindrance it' be a Feeling
[1:10:55] if it be an attitude if it be sin Lord
[1:10:58] God cleanse me Lord that I can run this
[1:11:01] race I press toward the mark for the
[1:11:04] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:11:07] Christ Jesus brother BR says it like
[1:11:10] this he says you know in the one place
[1:11:12] on images of Christ you know he says I'm
[1:11:15] interested in one thing that's more of
[1:11:17] the Holy Spirit to take over William
[1:11:20] brandham I'm not interested in joining a
[1:11:23] greater Church than what I belong to I
[1:11:25] belong to the real Church of the Living
[1:11:27] God the firstborn I was born into it now
[1:11:30] now if you catch this real carefully now
[1:11:32] the prophet is laying out a pattern that
[1:11:35] within our lives we desire to be closer
[1:11:38] to God and he's letting us know that
[1:11:41] there that as he said he said I don't
[1:11:43] need to go join some other church I
[1:11:46] already belong to that church it ain't
[1:11:48] talking about a building we're talking
[1:11:50] about the Church of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:53] Christ which 1 Corinthians 12 is the
[1:11:56] body of Christ by the spirit of God
[1:11:59] which is the word he says I already
[1:12:01] belong to
[1:12:03] it I didn't I didn't sign a book you
[1:12:05] didn't sign a book but it was by
[1:12:07] spiritual baptism inducted into the body
[1:12:12] of Jesus Christ so is making it
[1:12:15] available to us so it isn't like
[1:12:17] something that is just you know I've got
[1:12:18] to I've got to go over here to some
[1:12:20] certain place and I got to go no he's
[1:12:22] letting us know it's right here Among Us
[1:12:24] and he says and here it is I want more
[1:12:27] of the holy ghost in my life to reflect
[1:12:30] Christ who I love I don't care what
[1:12:34] plane or level I have to come on to get
[1:12:38] it I I don't care if I have to go here
[1:12:40] or there or be called a fanatic H roller
[1:12:43] whatever it may be I want more of his
[1:12:45] life to be
[1:12:48] reflected oh my there's things that God
[1:12:50] can deal with your life and all of a
[1:12:52] sudden Satan will whip right up next to
[1:12:54] you and say now now you've been brought
[1:12:56] to a Crossroads what's so and so going
[1:12:58] to say when you get rid of them
[1:13:00] Instagram posts and so and so say when
[1:13:02] you're no longer shacking up in that
[1:13:04] kind of a way and laying those certain
[1:13:06] things aside I'll tell you what you need
[1:13:08] to do say you know what I've got God on
[1:13:10] my side and God has stood with his word
[1:13:13] I'm taking my side with the word of God
[1:13:16] because that's what means more than
[1:13:18] anything else I want to be closer to God
[1:13:22] I want the promise that God has made for
[1:13:24] me I want when I look at it I want the
[1:13:27] promise of rapture I want that I want to
[1:13:30] walk in fellowship with him don't we
[1:13:34] all oh my notice I want
[1:13:38] more Hallelujah I want more of his life
[1:13:42] to be
[1:13:43] reflected in me true now notice as he
[1:13:47] goes he says I'm not
[1:13:51] interested I'm not interested in the
[1:13:53] plane I have to come on I'm not I'm
[1:13:55] interested in the Holy Ghost so I can be
[1:13:57] more of a servant like he was so this
[1:14:02] isn't about Lord I want more of the Holy
[1:14:04] Ghost that I might have a greater
[1:14:06] Ministry I want more of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:08] that Lord that that I might you know be
[1:14:10] be used more for this or being used more
[1:14:12] for this no I want more of the Holy
[1:14:15] Ghost to be more of a servant like he
[1:14:19] was that's what separated him from all
[1:14:22] the Pharisees from all the rest of them
[1:14:24] they were too
[1:14:27] big to deal with the menial
[1:14:31] matters in people's lives they forgot
[1:14:34] their purpose and their calling to be a
[1:14:37] part of the priesthood they are set
[1:14:39] aside not for their own selves they've
[1:14:42] been set aside to offer gifts unto God
[1:14:45] on behalf of the people now think about
[1:14:48] it you and I have been brought in to the
[1:14:50] priesthood now now being brought in a
[1:14:52] royal priesthood we brought in by the
[1:14:56] spirit of God so now to be a real priest
[1:14:59] is no longer to live a life for
[1:15:02] self it's offering on behalf of
[1:15:06] others even as we come together
[1:15:09] sometimes we don't feel like clapping
[1:15:11] our hands but we're
[1:15:13] priests sometimes we don't feel like
[1:15:15] worshiping well brother Samuel I want to
[1:15:17] get in the flesh I got news for you
[1:15:18] you've been in the flesh for however old
[1:15:20] you are and sometimes what you have to
[1:15:22] understand is you've got to make your
[1:15:24] flesh obey that son or daughter of God
[1:15:27] on the
[1:15:28] inside that's taking some jurisdiction
[1:15:31] you say what can happen from that I'll
[1:15:32] tell you what can happen from that that
[1:15:34] might actually be a showdown in that
[1:15:37] service where more of God is able to
[1:15:39] move into your life and there's an
[1:15:41] overcoming strength that comes into your
[1:15:44] life to further recognize that thing
[1:15:46] when it wants to creep up again and
[1:15:48] Grace for you to be able to stand there
[1:15:51] and move beyond your own
[1:15:53] feelings that's true I'll tell you if we
[1:15:55] can do that right there man we'll be
[1:15:56] doing real good that's the truth we'll
[1:15:59] be doing real good I said will
[1:16:03] will notice this I'm not interested in
[1:16:05] the plane I have to come on I'm
[1:16:07] interested in the Holy Ghost so I can be
[1:16:08] more of a servant like he was he was the
[1:16:11] Lord's servant never come to be served
[1:16:14] or to minister never come never come for
[1:16:16] he to be ministered to but to minister
[1:16:19] he took the place of a servant and if
[1:16:22] the king of Heaven could do that where
[1:16:25] the members of his body let's all be
[1:16:27] likewise not be different but humble
[1:16:31] ourselves in his
[1:16:33] presence no matter what the world has
[1:16:36] got to say intellectual people thinking
[1:16:38] nothing about it just receive more of
[1:16:42] the Holy Ghost and be like Jesus humble
[1:16:45] meekly lonely take his place tell people
[1:16:50] off no that wasn't in there and he'll
[1:16:52] take yours at the
[1:16:56] judgement
[1:16:58] wow say Lord I want
[1:17:01] more I want more yeah I I want more of
[1:17:05] the Holy Ghost I want more of
[1:17:08] him amen I I believe that's what we've
[1:17:10] been brought to within this hour more of
[1:17:14] him the more more I can yield myself and
[1:17:18] surrender more of his presence I feel in
[1:17:21] my life no wonder Paul when he would
[1:17:23] write even in First Corinthians chapter
[1:17:25] 9 about how that we're to run this race
[1:17:28] that even those who would run the race
[1:17:31] Paul would talk about it one receiveth
[1:17:33] the prize so run that you may obtain it
[1:17:37] you ever had guys that run with you you
[1:17:38] know you got to do your conditioning and
[1:17:39] things like that you got guys that just
[1:17:41] they're just pacing yeah they're just
[1:17:43] pacing you find somebody you can Pace
[1:17:45] with but then you find others that they
[1:17:47] don't care what everybody else is doing
[1:17:49] on the team or whatever more they're
[1:17:50] running because they may not be running
[1:17:52] for a gold medal or something but what
[1:17:55] they realize is the more that I push
[1:17:56] myself the better that I'll be in the
[1:17:59] conditioning right so the reality of
[1:18:01] this sometimes that there's things even
[1:18:03] in Running of this race it requires a
[1:18:06] little bit of pushing of ourselves a
[1:18:08] little bit of surrendering ourselves
[1:18:10] come on friends we're living in such a
[1:18:12] time where we are feelings and listen
[1:18:15] pressures are greater and they're only
[1:18:17] going to get greater our feelings and
[1:18:20] things are not going to become easier we
[1:18:22] are living in a complex Nur erotic age
[1:18:26] we are living in a time when the very
[1:18:28] lid of hell has been taken off in
[1:18:31] Revelations chapter 9 it speaks of that
[1:18:34] of how you see all of these demon
[1:18:36] Spirits that's been released here upon
[1:18:38] the Earth is that right we feel you s
[1:18:41] sometimes you don't even know what's
[1:18:42] taking place and it's just pressures
[1:18:44] that are congealing Darkness that's all
[1:18:46] around us we so it's not going to get
[1:18:48] any easier but in the midst of it say
[1:18:51] God help me in the midst of this time I
[1:18:54] want to be like those in thara when the
[1:18:56] Bible says of how that they came into
[1:18:59] such a time of darkness and the way that
[1:19:01] they responded to it was with increased
[1:19:05] service unto
[1:19:07] God in a time of great Darkness God let
[1:19:11] him know I see your faith now ain't
[1:19:15] incredible places before that when he
[1:19:17] speaks to pergamus when he speaks to uh
[1:19:20] you know to that of Ephesus and other
[1:19:22] times he'll talk about his faith but but
[1:19:24] then he turns around and commends them
[1:19:26] on their faith you say well don't I have
[1:19:28] whose faith is it well it's his faith
[1:19:30] that comes in to move upon our faith but
[1:19:33] you see how his faith moving in our
[1:19:35] faith it isn't that he's going to come
[1:19:36] down and do everything for us but his
[1:19:39] faith moving in our lives it's just like
[1:19:41] between a husband and a wife that love
[1:19:43] affair that can can can exist it causes
[1:19:46] that wife man just to move and to
[1:19:48] operate there within that home in such a
[1:19:50] way she's able then to reach back out to
[1:19:52] the husband and the husband you know
[1:19:54] reach beond different things you know
[1:19:56] and helping out in other areas so many
[1:19:58] things that'll work together why because
[1:20:00] of A Love Affair so that increase of
[1:20:03] service was all under the administration
[1:20:07] of divine love so good anybody say help
[1:20:11] me Lord help me Lord amen so notice
[1:20:15] whoever runs is temperent in all things
[1:20:19] there's certain things that you won't
[1:20:21] eat or drink or go certain places
[1:20:23] certain athletes or whatever more they
[1:20:25] won't do that because they do not want
[1:20:27] to hinder
[1:20:29] performance but you see if we're not
[1:20:31] careful we can become so inflated in our
[1:20:34] minds of well I'm the elect nothing can
[1:20:37] face me nothing can hurt me you know if
[1:20:41] I'm predestinated I'm going in the
[1:20:43] Rapture I will also remind you if you're
[1:20:45] predestinated you'll live like
[1:20:48] it you'll walk like it yeah your life
[1:20:52] will show the outworking of of
[1:20:55] predestination is that right where it
[1:20:57] moves to to push us Beyond things listen
[1:21:00] friends all those different thoughts can
[1:21:02] come right around our lives but there is
[1:21:04] a love affair on the inside you know
[1:21:06] it's like how the prophet said tell me
[1:21:08] he said one person that has never come
[1:21:10] in contact with the love of God but
[1:21:12] doesn't want more he said you want more
[1:21:16] you want more of him you you Delight in
[1:21:18] more of him Hey listen friends if a drug
[1:21:21] addict can all of a sudden take that
[1:21:23] aent or met you know uh meth or those
[1:21:26] other things that's out there and they
[1:21:28] just from that one little thing and
[1:21:30] they're doing that to try to
[1:21:32] escape their
[1:21:34] realities and how that Satan would offer
[1:21:37] them in that way and it can move them in
[1:21:39] such a place to where it will cause them
[1:21:41] to sacrifice their families it'll cause
[1:21:44] them to sacrifice relationship positions
[1:21:47] and everything else oh and that's the
[1:21:50] perversion how much greater is it when
[1:21:53] the Holy Spirit would move upon a
[1:21:56] person's life it will cause all you
[1:21:58] become a real true addict of the Holy
[1:22:01] Spirit Lord I need more of you I just
[1:22:04] can't get enough of you that's what the
[1:22:06] Bible said in the book of Acts that the
[1:22:09] bans addicted themselves to the word of
[1:22:13] God
[1:22:17] true and that's kind of addicts we want
[1:22:19] to be yeah oh lord lord I need more I
[1:22:23] need an I needed more Lord I need more
[1:22:25] Lord of your spirit Lord I need more of
[1:22:28] your life Lord I need more of you Lord
[1:22:31] God that's totally contrary to the
[1:22:33] Pharisee who was only looking at where
[1:22:37] he was and looking down on others and
[1:22:40] yet here you had this other one standing
[1:22:41] right there couldn't even lift up his
[1:22:44] eyes Lord be merciful to me a
[1:22:49] sinner we want more of him don't
[1:22:52] we so notice God God would would speak
[1:22:55] to us in regarding this service and how
[1:22:59] that we in ourselves would put on that
[1:23:02] Garment of humility notice the scripture
[1:23:05] says that that you younger submit
[1:23:07] yourselves unto the Elder y all of you
[1:23:10] be subject one to another now notice how
[1:23:12] God writes this he just doesn't write
[1:23:15] something in his word without giving us
[1:23:18] the
[1:23:19] opportunities for this to be
[1:23:21] practiced now you realize when we're
[1:23:23] talking about practice we're not talking
[1:23:24] about like like how it is when you
[1:23:26] practicing before a game you know it
[1:23:27] don't matter if you miss a shot but in a
[1:23:29] game it's a different story that's not
[1:23:31] practice that's a real deal
[1:23:34] right but I always thought how our coach
[1:23:37] always taught us he said boy he said the
[1:23:39] way that you practice is the way that
[1:23:40] you'll play if you practice
[1:23:42] half-heartedly you approach it
[1:23:44] half-heartedly that's how you'll pray he
[1:23:45] said CU there ain't no magic button on
[1:23:47] Friday nights that turn it on and all of
[1:23:48] a sudden you get out there that's true
[1:23:51] but see when we're talking about
[1:23:52] practice God gives us maybe the better
[1:23:54] word with a practice part of it is
[1:23:56] opportunities God will do it with the
[1:23:58] young ones submitting to the elders in
[1:24:01] so many different ways so many ways to
[1:24:04] be able to just you know just just be
[1:24:06] able to Humble ourselves in such a way
[1:24:08] cuz sometimes how it is when we're young
[1:24:10] I mean we know it we you know we we feel
[1:24:13] like boy don't get quiet on me now I
[1:24:17] mean we we feel that way we feel like
[1:24:18] you know we don't man you you don't
[1:24:20] understand you don't understand and and
[1:24:21] you know and and here God gives us
[1:24:23] opportunities for this to be developed
[1:24:25] in our lives to submit to the Elder then
[1:24:31] he goes on for all of us as well to
[1:24:34] submit ourselves and be subject one to
[1:24:37] another and be clothed with humility for
[1:24:40] God resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[1:24:43] to the humble humble yourselves
[1:24:45] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:24:47] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:24:50] casting all your care upon him for he
[1:24:54] carth for you thank you Father so this
[1:24:57] this whole phrase that Peter wrote under
[1:25:00] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:02] the early church would have understood
[1:25:04] what he was speaking about according to
[1:25:05] the words that God would have him to
[1:25:08] choose it spoke of that of a servile
[1:25:11] garment yeah that's right of one who is
[1:25:13] there to serve now you know a servant
[1:25:16] doesn't get a choice of what he's a
[1:25:19] servant
[1:25:20] to he doesn't get a choice to say
[1:25:23] whether or not you know I bring my
[1:25:24] slippers uh can you bring me my meal uh
[1:25:26] can you bring me a cold glass of tea can
[1:25:28] you do this can a servant is a servant
[1:25:31] is that right so in other words it's not
[1:25:33] just one servant looking around say no I
[1:25:36] don't bring tea I bring the
[1:25:38] slippers and then this one over here
[1:25:40] says no I don't bring slippers I just
[1:25:42] bring tea now there is a lot of times
[1:25:44] could be different servants but what I'm
[1:25:46] getting to is that you or I do not get
[1:25:49] to choose I mean we have a choice but
[1:25:52] the things that God will allow to come
[1:25:54] AC crossed our path to determine whether
[1:25:56] or not we are going to have that
[1:25:59] garment to be a servant in our
[1:26:03] lives or whether we're just going to lay
[1:26:05] that aside no I'm not uhuh I'm not uhuh
[1:26:08] uhuh I'm I'm not giving place to that
[1:26:10] but we don't get a choice we don't get a
[1:26:12] choice of how of how that we serve when
[1:26:15] someone's done us wrong we don't get a
[1:26:17] choice on that of how that we conduct
[1:26:19] ourselves we don't say hey I'm taking
[1:26:20] that off right now I mean I don't know
[1:26:22] we we can't I mean I can't take off the
[1:26:24] Holy
[1:26:26] Ghost you can't take it off when you've
[1:26:28] really been born of the spirit of God
[1:26:30] you can't take it off but but you and I
[1:26:33] when he's clothed our soul we can
[1:26:35] override things Oh yeah and when we
[1:26:38] override it it never works right in our
[1:26:42] own lives because in our lives we're not
[1:26:45] made to operate with self we're not made
[1:26:49] to hold and harbor grudges and feelings
[1:26:52] and all of those things and you know the
[1:26:53] reason those can exist there is because
[1:26:56] that we feel like we're right they're
[1:26:59] wrong yeah there you go what a
[1:27:03] trap what a trap wonder why the prophet
[1:27:05] would spend so much in the message
[1:27:09] dealing with this very thing on many
[1:27:12] times what we think is what hinders us
[1:27:17] when we think we've got a right to get
[1:27:19] back at somebody the spirit of God takes
[1:27:22] its flight when we think we're
[1:27:25] better the holy spirit is just grieved
[1:27:27] he just pulls away from our
[1:27:29] lives the dove cuz he's timid I say God
[1:27:33] help us friends without the love of God
[1:27:36] in our soul how how are you how could we
[1:27:38] have a Fighting
[1:27:39] Chance you understand how could we have
[1:27:41] a chance without him in the midst of our
[1:27:44] lives so this is why that Paul would
[1:27:46] write put on therefore as the elect of
[1:27:48] God sink into like a garment as as the
[1:27:52] elect of God holy and beloved bow of
[1:27:54] mercies kindness humbleness of Mind
[1:27:58] meekness
[1:28:00] longsuffering I'll just say Lord take me
[1:28:04] deeper when Elijah threw that garment
[1:28:07] back remember God did not tailor the
[1:28:10] Garment to fit
[1:28:12] Elisha it's not like you or I receiving
[1:28:15] a suit from somebody else and we put it
[1:28:18] on and say man it's it's all right right
[1:28:19] here you know it it fits pretty good
[1:28:21] around here but the sleeves are a little
[1:28:22] too long that's not how the Holy Ghost
[1:28:25] works we do not alter the spirit of God
[1:28:29] which is the word of God they're one and
[1:28:30] the same we do not alter that but God
[1:28:33] works to alter Our Lives to fit his
[1:28:37] word and then putting on we find that
[1:28:40] phrase over and over in the New
[1:28:42] Testament Ephesians 4 where we started a
[1:28:44] lot of this service it this series it
[1:28:47] deals with sinking into look this is the
[1:28:49] greatest thing friends if we can take
[1:28:51] this and run with it and apply it oh my
[1:28:54] if you see something in your life if you
[1:28:56] see something along the way say oh God
[1:28:58] take me deeper Lord take me deeper Lord
[1:29:01] in you don't be ashamed to tell him that
[1:29:04] but say Lord take me deeper Smite you
[1:29:07] across the chest Lord take me deeper
[1:29:10] Lord I'm willing I want to stand right
[1:29:12] now this is the Judgment that we and I
[1:29:15] will stand before I'll never have to
[1:29:18] stand before the right Throne judgment
[1:29:20] by his grace because there's already
[1:29:22] been a sacrifice that stood on my
[1:29:25] behalf because because remember the
[1:29:28] Bible tells us in the Book of
[1:29:29] Revelations it does not mention one
[1:29:31] thing about blood at the white Throne
[1:29:33] judgment it said there were books and
[1:29:36] books and books and books that were
[1:29:38] opened
[1:29:40] Deeds Deeds that were done but no blood
[1:29:44] wow
[1:29:46] wow this is why when the Rapture comes
[1:29:49] the picture's been taken let him that's
[1:29:53] holy be holy still that's bride going in
[1:29:55] Rapture let him that's righteous be
[1:29:58] righteous still that a foolish virgin
[1:30:01] that here of church that's left right
[1:30:03] let him that's a wicked and things like
[1:30:05] that the picture is taken there there is
[1:30:07] no movement in the tribulation for the
[1:30:11] Gentiles it is during that three and a
[1:30:14] half years that Israel receives their
[1:30:17] visitation of the finish of Daniel's 70
[1:30:21] weeks there you go right
[1:30:24] three and A2 weeks which are years is
[1:30:27] that right and they get their visitation
[1:30:30] of the two witnesses that step out what
[1:30:33] two witnesses the same that was there on
[1:30:35] Mount Transfiguration that appeared when
[1:30:38] Peter James and John stood there Elijah
[1:30:40] and Moses Moses representing the law and
[1:30:43] Elijah representing God's justice but oh
[1:30:46] aren't you glad that there was one who
[1:30:49] spoke up in the midst of that time and
[1:30:51] said hear ye him this is my beloved Son
[1:30:56] this is the one who met what the law
[1:30:59] required this is the one that has met
[1:31:01] God's justice and has walked through
[1:31:04] that tribulation of fire that brassy
[1:31:07] judgment and his life coming to you and
[1:31:10] I oh my that's what they'll Minister
[1:31:13] Moses and Elijah under that anointing to
[1:31:16] the Jews they'll call them to the true
[1:31:19] atonement the Lord Jesus himself will
[1:31:22] slip away from the white Throne judgment
[1:31:23] and and slip right back down and make
[1:31:25] himself known as Joseph made himself
[1:31:28] known to his
[1:31:30] Brethren is that
[1:31:32] right now can I have just a little bit
[1:31:36] more it don't sound real
[1:31:41] strong let's look at this here on Pride
[1:31:45] versus humility I thought this is I
[1:31:48] thought this is really really
[1:31:51] incredible I don't know somebody sent me
[1:31:53] this or something I don't I don't know
[1:31:54] when but I got to I was I forgot all
[1:31:57] about it I was looking back through my
[1:31:58] pictures the other day I was actually
[1:31:59] looking for a different picture and I
[1:32:00] come across this thing and I was like my
[1:32:02] goodness I don't know who sent it but
[1:32:05] anyhow it's good but I want you to watch
[1:32:07] this with pride this is one of the
[1:32:10] things with pride pride focuses on
[1:32:14] others
[1:32:17] failures it's
[1:32:19] self-righteous overly critical and fault
[1:32:22] finding
[1:32:24] why in order to make yourself righteous
[1:32:28] you've got to find somebody that's
[1:32:29] beneath you wow
[1:32:32] yeah looks at their life through a
[1:32:35] telescope but others with a
[1:32:39] microscope it's
[1:32:41] true looks down on those who aren't as
[1:32:45] spiritual or committed as they
[1:32:48] are M we only had badges
[1:32:55] thanks they know who is truly proud and
[1:32:57] truly humble that's incredible cuz
[1:33:00] remember David's brother eliab when
[1:33:04] David came to the battle and asking who
[1:33:06] is this guy that's calling out remember
[1:33:09] what eliab said I
[1:33:10] know the naughtiness of your heart pride
[1:33:15] is here you see what it is he's
[1:33:16] Discerning and it's not really
[1:33:18] discernment no true I mean he's
[1:33:21] Discerning you got Pride that's why
[1:33:22] you're showing up the truth of the
[1:33:24] matter is elab had the
[1:33:28] pride that's right he had the pride he
[1:33:31] wasn't going to walk out there but
[1:33:33] neither was he going to surrender to
[1:33:35] somebody else who had a little bit more
[1:33:37] faith than he
[1:33:38] did right notice how the prophet said it
[1:33:41] over and over he said if I didn't have
[1:33:42] the faith to walk where Enoch walked and
[1:33:44] somebody else did I let them walk on I'm
[1:33:48] not going to hinder them we want to walk
[1:33:50] on we want to be an encouragement to
[1:33:52] somebody else listen God is so set that
[1:33:54] in the body in such a way that and there
[1:33:57] is a diversity of gifts and if we're not
[1:33:59] careful this is what happened in the
[1:34:02] Corinthian Church the Corinthian Church
[1:34:04] and you look at that and you say oh they
[1:34:06] were so carnal if they had not been
[1:34:08] carnal in that way how would we have had
[1:34:11] some of the teaching that we
[1:34:14] need but they had so locked up to such a
[1:34:17] place they had those saying I'm of
[1:34:18] sephus I'm of Paul I I'm of Apollos and
[1:34:23] the other said I just push play with
[1:34:25] Christ I'm of Christ that they just
[1:34:28] they're just separated in that way they
[1:34:30] were so separated and Paul had to let
[1:34:32] them know hey wait a minute why is there
[1:34:35] division why is there Schism why is this
[1:34:38] among
[1:34:39] you amen we are one body amen it's God
[1:34:44] that plants it's God that Waters it's
[1:34:47] God God that gives the increase he leads
[1:34:49] one to sew leads one to water and it's
[1:34:52] God who gives the increase
[1:34:57] but see how Satan can so work in there
[1:34:59] so
[1:35:00] subtly in such a subtle
[1:35:03] way thinks everyone is privileged to
[1:35:07] have them
[1:35:10] involved look at this with
[1:35:12] humility realizes here's what humility
[1:35:15] is realizes how far they fall short and
[1:35:19] have overwhelming sense of their need to
[1:35:21] grow anybody else feel that that way
[1:35:24] yeah every time Lord I I feel the need
[1:35:28] to grow compassionate and forgiving amen
[1:35:32] looks for the best in others yeah seeks
[1:35:37] to win people not
[1:35:39] arguments that's so good realize is only
[1:35:42] God knows a person's true motives there
[1:35:46] you go yes sir I can look at actions but
[1:35:48] I'm not going to try to be a prophet
[1:35:50] when I'm not that's right God knows
[1:35:53] their true Moes but but I know this but
[1:35:55] listen I want to believe the best for
[1:35:58] every person brother Samuel you might be
[1:36:00] wrong I would rather air with Grace than
[1:36:03] be guilty of condemning under law
[1:36:06] without an opportunity to rise and get
[1:36:10] right is that not what the prophet said
[1:36:12] even in a marriage he said if both of
[1:36:15] you can't see eye to eye give in he said
[1:36:18] it will be shown which one is Right In
[1:36:21] Due Time Glory but sometimes our our
[1:36:25] flesh is we have got to win this
[1:36:27] argument we've got to win this
[1:36:31] point and we're humble when we're doing
[1:36:33] it nobody as humble as
[1:36:37] us leaves the Judgment of the heart in
[1:36:40] God's hands Glory thanks they don't
[1:36:43] deserve the opportunities that God gives
[1:36:46] them
[1:36:51] amen it don't diminish it grows greater
[1:36:54] and
[1:36:55] greater how true these things are how
[1:36:58] true and you know what it takes it takes
[1:37:01] the spirit of God to help us to see
[1:37:03] these things cuz cuz ever so easily
[1:37:06] there can come that of even just very
[1:37:08] quickly here let me just try to bring
[1:37:09] some of these points in it can come ever
[1:37:11] so quickly remember how God talked about
[1:37:13] a proud look he said in the book of in
[1:37:16] the Book of Proverbs he don't like a
[1:37:17] proud look that he would talk about in
[1:37:20] the scripture there in Proverbs 21:4 and
[1:37:23] how look and a proud heart now I want
[1:37:25] you to understand this when God has
[1:37:27] sealed that Soul by his Spirit you've
[1:37:31] got to take your
[1:37:33] heart and that heart has got to follow
[1:37:37] what's in the soul that's so good this
[1:37:39] is why that when we come Hebrews 4:12
[1:37:42] the Bible tells us the word of God is
[1:37:44] quick alive and a
[1:37:47] discern of the very intense of the heart
[1:37:52] why we are heart we want our heart going
[1:37:55] the right way because listen our soul
[1:37:57] can be so so settled with God but in our
[1:38:00] heart there can be so many other things
[1:38:02] that we can start taking in Pride can
[1:38:05] come in negativity criticalness all
[1:38:09] those other things just as much as
[1:38:10] unconfessed Sin can come right there in
[1:38:12] the heart and yet that life is sealed
[1:38:15] with the spirit of God but once that
[1:38:17] heart has been brought right back in
[1:38:19] line with the soul then it's a Channel
[1:38:24] glory for God to use
[1:38:26] Glory Glory so we want all of that we
[1:38:29] want it all lined up that's what God is
[1:38:31] dealing with our lives that it would all
[1:38:33] be lined up we want our hearts to be
[1:38:36] discerned notice brother B says it like
[1:38:38] this and humble thyself he says you know
[1:38:41] he says I though I understand all the
[1:38:42] mysteries of God and still though I
[1:38:44] could do and have not charity I'm
[1:38:46] nothing I've got nowhere yet the main
[1:38:49] thing is love God and humble yourself
[1:38:53] with it amen so there's no way to Humble
[1:38:56] ourselves to that place without under
[1:38:59] the operation of the love of God God
[1:39:02] working God moving God melting our
[1:39:05] hearts Now watch how he says this he
[1:39:07] said surely after all these years on the
[1:39:09] field and around the world and seeing
[1:39:11] different people I ought to know a
[1:39:13] little bit about the gate to enter in at
[1:39:15] and if you want to get somewhere with
[1:39:17] God never let an arrogant Spirit ever
[1:39:21] come around you
[1:39:23] now I wonder why he would say it if it
[1:39:26] wasn't
[1:39:27] possible remember when when they built
[1:39:29] the tabernac how coming back from
[1:39:30] Babylon they built the temple right Ezra
[1:39:33] and N here they come back Ezra comes
[1:39:35] back when the Temple's built and then
[1:39:37] the temple begins to be operative and
[1:39:38] then God brings back Nehemiah nehemiah's
[1:39:41] building up the walls of Jerusalem so
[1:39:43] everything's coming right back in order
[1:39:44] and Nehemiah stood there he was not a
[1:39:47] priest but he was a governor there's
[1:39:49] times where you and I have to stand as a
[1:39:52] priest and there's times we got to stand
[1:39:54] as a governor he has made us Kings and
[1:39:57] Priests unto our God right and Nehemiah
[1:40:00] stood there because there were some who
[1:40:03] were coming up next to the walls in the
[1:40:05] time of the Sabbath or the time of rest
[1:40:08] we know that rest to be the Holy Spirit
[1:40:10] to you and I they were coming up there
[1:40:12] and they were wanting to sell fish they
[1:40:14] were wanting to sell things that would
[1:40:16] be pleasant trees to that of those
[1:40:19] inside of the wall and Nehemiah said
[1:40:21] you're not even going to come up to the
[1:40:23] wall walls if I catch you around these
[1:40:25] walls again there will be retribution
[1:40:28] that's a temperate life I don't want to
[1:40:31] see how close that I can get to the
[1:40:33] world I don't want to know how much of
[1:40:36] it but I want my life to be free and
[1:40:39] clear for God to operate I don't want
[1:40:42] hindrances in my life I want God to be
[1:40:46] able to move because I'm expecting a
[1:40:48] move that's going to move me from this
[1:40:49] Dimension into that
[1:40:51] Dimension don't let an arrogance Spirit
[1:40:53] come around you it can get right around
[1:40:57] us it can come right around now brother
[1:41:00] brand it's amazing when he uses this
[1:41:02] terminology arrogant arrogantly and just
[1:41:04] this message humble thyself you get a
[1:41:06] chance go back and listen to that
[1:41:07] message and he deals with what can be
[1:41:10] such a key trap of how things can come
[1:41:13] about if one of the things can come
[1:41:15] about is how that we would look at
[1:41:17] others that don't see what God has shown
[1:41:20] to us that's so good and remember you
[1:41:24] and I did not did not open our eyes to
[1:41:26] see what God has done and is doing in
[1:41:29] this day God didn't we didn't do that
[1:41:31] that was that was the elective Grace of
[1:41:33] almighty God as a matter of fact no
[1:41:35] doubt some of us sat right here and it's
[1:41:37] gone over our heads gone over our heads
[1:41:38] all of a sudden Our Lives it just man we
[1:41:41] realize my goodness what what's taking
[1:41:43] place what it's all about I'm a part of
[1:41:47] it God's grace to you and I but he would
[1:41:51] talk about that arrogance
[1:41:53] over and over where it has a arrogance
[1:41:57] itself is one who has an
[1:41:59] exaggerated sense of One's Own
[1:42:02] importance or
[1:42:05] abilities and brother BR would deal with
[1:42:07] that of how that within that that
[1:42:09] arrogance of how that it would come in
[1:42:11] in such a way and one of the traps is is
[1:42:15] when somebody's done something
[1:42:17] wrong and brother Bram say it like this
[1:42:20] when we think they're wrong
[1:42:24] sometimes people have done things wrong
[1:42:25] anybody in here ever done anything
[1:42:27] wrong maybe only five of us six of
[1:42:31] us but so sometimes it
[1:42:34] comes to bring this over we're tested
[1:42:37] see we don't get to choose when we have
[1:42:39] that Garment of humility on but if
[1:42:42] something this is how we should be this
[1:42:44] is how honest we should be if there's
[1:42:47] something that when someone either
[1:42:48] brother BR say it over and over right
[1:42:50] down through this message right here and
[1:42:51] he's dealing with that arrogant spirit
[1:42:53] if it's something that somebody's done
[1:42:54] something wrong or even if it's
[1:42:56] something that we think is wrong they
[1:42:59] may not even done anything to us we just
[1:43:01] think it's we just think it's wrong
[1:43:03] that's right I think that's wrong and
[1:43:06] Satan can come right around in that area
[1:43:09] and we
[1:43:10] wonder well I wonder why I tell you they
[1:43:13] they need to change this they need to
[1:43:14] correct this they need to do that boy
[1:43:16] bless God that person's so wrong and if
[1:43:19] we're not
[1:43:20] careful instead of realizing no matter
[1:43:22] how how wrong a person could be or even
[1:43:26] of something that we think is
[1:43:29] wrong if we don't take it to God and say
[1:43:32] Lord let my attitude be in the right
[1:43:36] place if it's not then we have not in
[1:43:40] the favor that God would have us to be
[1:43:43] and it could become prideful I don't
[1:43:46] know why I don't know why I don't know
[1:43:47] why that brother I don't know why
[1:43:48] brother Brian made the decision like
[1:43:49] that I don't know why I mean you should
[1:43:51] have just I mean I I have no idea and it
[1:43:53] can just come so easy I don't know why
[1:43:55] so and so I don't I don't know why so
[1:43:56] and so I don't know why I don't know why
[1:43:57] this is you know sung like this I don't
[1:43:59] know and and and all of a sudden it
[1:44:00] becomes to such a place to
[1:44:04] where we're looking
[1:44:06] down on others that's around
[1:44:10] us now friends I don't mean to be the
[1:44:12] bearer of bad news but I'm just going to
[1:44:13] tell
[1:44:15] you the
[1:44:17] Rapture is going to be the
[1:44:19] culmination of God's crowning
[1:44:22] achievement in our
[1:44:24] lives and I'm going to tell you that
[1:44:26] that that is going to change every bit
[1:44:28] of Our Lives it not only going to make
[1:44:30] us young people
[1:44:31] again but it's going to change it'll
[1:44:33] take all the buttons out of our life
[1:44:35] than it'll take the buttons that we have
[1:44:37] that others push right and we're and
[1:44:40] it'll take away our fingers from pushing
[1:44:42] others buttons that's you say why would
[1:44:45] God allow that for humility to be
[1:44:48] displayed because you and I were
[1:44:51] Unbecoming
[1:44:53] so Unbecoming was it for our lord Jesus
[1:44:56] to come down and Adorn a body of Flesh I
[1:45:01] want you to think about it in this hour
[1:45:04] of the culminating work of the promise
[1:45:06] of God how unfitting was it that God
[1:45:10] himself would
[1:45:11] take and use a little simple
[1:45:16] vessel it didn't even have a seventh
[1:45:19] grade
[1:45:21] education and God would use that to
[1:45:24] speak to you and I friends that went
[1:45:26] beyond anything of arrogance it went
[1:45:28] beyond all of that how that God would
[1:45:31] stoop down in such a way to so deal with
[1:45:34] our lives so brother samon what are you
[1:45:36] saying well until we get out of here and
[1:45:39] as we're gathered together right now oh
[1:45:41] brother Samuel if I don't I tell you
[1:45:43] what somebody rubs me here I'll go
[1:45:44] somewhere else well listen it don't
[1:45:46] matter where you go it don't matter
[1:45:48] where you go now it don't matter where
[1:45:50] you go you're still going to have to
[1:45:51] deal with
[1:45:53] you it don't matter there'll be somebody
[1:45:56] else that'll rub you a certain way and
[1:45:58] all if you can we can understand what
[1:46:00] that is it's not about if everybody
[1:46:02] could just be like
[1:46:06] me I mean it would just be such a it
[1:46:09] would be so wonderful that's not God's
[1:46:12] design God's design is not that we would
[1:46:16] all be the same but his but his program
[1:46:20] is that we would be one
[1:46:23] yes and one with his spirit with his
[1:46:27] word and him working through a many
[1:46:30] membered diverse body wow that's amazing
[1:46:34] yes sir and all of our temperaments all
[1:46:36] of our makeups all of our this all of
[1:46:39] our that you know what that's why I'm
[1:46:40] not trying to change anybody I'm not
[1:46:43] trying to change one person of how that
[1:46:45] you sometimes how you think or how you
[1:46:47] approach listen as as a Shepherd God's
[1:46:50] given me Grace I know the sheep that I P
[1:46:53] Jesus said I know my sheep by name we
[1:46:56] know the characteristics God's not a
[1:46:58] cookie cutter God he knows how to work
[1:47:01] with every one of us and I'm glad he
[1:47:03] does it in a certain way aren't you I'm
[1:47:05] glad he knows how to work with us he
[1:47:07] don't try to work with little Aaron like
[1:47:08] he does with Paul he don't try to work
[1:47:10] you know with one of these sisters like
[1:47:12] he does another sister but yet it is the
[1:47:14] same almighty God let me tell you what
[1:47:17] that is that's humility yes that's
[1:47:20] humility
[1:47:23] sometimes the Trap that we can get into
[1:47:25] is such an easy
[1:47:26] trap is when something has gone wrong or
[1:47:29] something is how we'd think oh that I
[1:47:32] don't know if that should have been done
[1:47:34] I don't know if that should have been ah
[1:47:35] that I don't think that should have been
[1:47:36] said it wasn't saying that we should
[1:47:38] just sit all around but you know what
[1:47:40] there's things even some things that
[1:47:41] I've had to you know it's from far away
[1:47:44] kind of dealing with and things like
[1:47:45] that and and I look at it and the things
[1:47:47] I've just approached with different ones
[1:47:49] I've said look here's what you have to
[1:47:50] understand you don't know exactly what
[1:47:53] the heart of that brother is you have no
[1:47:55] idea what he's going through you have no
[1:47:58] idea the pressures that he's under that
[1:48:01] is so
[1:48:02] good and this is what I said I said I
[1:48:04] would rather ER on the side of
[1:48:09] Grace then be one who's going to stand
[1:48:12] there and say this and this and that and
[1:48:14] there might be things that I don't I
[1:48:15] don't see I don't agree with but Grace
[1:48:19] itself is so great that it can override
[1:48:23] and bring healing I said sometimes it
[1:48:25] can be healing that's needed deeper
[1:48:27] maybe in a person's life that is so I
[1:48:29] would rather ER that way I say God help
[1:48:31] us if there's one thing friends listen
[1:48:33] when we can be guilty of as a church oh
[1:48:36] God let us be guilty of that I want I
[1:48:38] want to look and see the best in one
[1:48:40] another how can you say Brother Sam you
[1:48:42] ought to be preaching with fire if I
[1:48:43] can't see that there's diamonds down
[1:48:46] there I believe with all in my heart
[1:48:48] that the people I'm preaching to we're
[1:48:50] going to spend eternity together
[1:48:54] you might get mad at me sometimes when I
[1:48:56] step on your toes but there's a reason
[1:48:58] because in my heart God has dropped in
[1:49:01] my heart I know inside of there is Sons
[1:49:04] and Daughters of God and we can make it
[1:49:06] we're more than able to overcome
[1:49:10] hallelujah
[1:49:11] hallu hallelujah hallelujah GL be to God
[1:49:16] in the highest hallelujah
[1:49:20] hallelujah let me just let me just stop
[1:49:22] here
[1:49:24] praise God I think we've I just feel in
[1:49:26] my heart the spirit of God we've it's
[1:49:28] it's clenched where it it needs to be
[1:49:30] thank you
[1:49:32] Lord hallelujah that last part with
[1:49:36] pride can be
[1:49:41] so it can be
[1:49:43] so subtle is where Pride
[1:49:47] itself can draw
[1:49:51] circles Pride can just draw
[1:49:58] circles and pride will cause that Circle
[1:50:01] that starts out you know when God first
[1:50:02] got a hold of your life it's so
[1:50:05] big man it's so big it's like you got to
[1:50:07] take a telescope to see the person on
[1:50:08] the other side that's
[1:50:10] right you need a you need a rocket
[1:50:12] launcher to send to pass a ball to them
[1:50:15] but all of a sudden if we're not careful
[1:50:17] that that Circle can start getting
[1:50:22] smaller and
[1:50:24] smaller and you know what's incredible
[1:50:27] is we understand in our lives that we're
[1:50:30] to separate from all unbelief is that
[1:50:33] right we're to separate God leads us
[1:50:35] that see that's God leading Us in
[1:50:37] separation in our own lives in our own
[1:50:39] walk with him but what we have to be
[1:50:42] careful with one other trap is like I
[1:50:46] said when we see something
[1:50:48] wrong sometimes it might be of how a
[1:50:50] person maybe something they're seeing
[1:50:53] something they're looking at in God's
[1:50:55] word something of that you're looking at
[1:50:58] you're you're seeing certain things
[1:50:59] listen God test us there's certain
[1:51:02] things that I've seen here in the past
[1:51:03] few years that I thought Lord I thought
[1:51:05] we wouldn't see again and I just in my
[1:51:08] heart just keep it in my heart of things
[1:51:10] just just thought wouldn't we would we
[1:51:11] you know we were we we' God has taken us
[1:51:13] of certain things of certain battles
[1:51:15] Beyond certain things but I begin to
[1:51:17] realize is that the same
[1:51:20] spirits and we're tested in so many
[1:51:23] different ways and one of the ways that
[1:51:25] we can be tested in so subtly is when
[1:51:29] someone doesn't see something eye to eye
[1:51:33] the way we see
[1:51:35] it and God can allow us to see something
[1:51:38] it isn't that we're anything but God can
[1:51:40] allow us to see something we can see
[1:51:42] this scripture see this quote can see
[1:51:44] all of this right here but what God will
[1:51:46] look at is what's our attitude towards
[1:51:48] it how do we look at it
[1:51:53] I I'm I'm telling you I'm preaching to
[1:51:54] myself and I look at that and I say God
[1:51:58] when I look at these
[1:51:59] things I don't want to draw that Circle
[1:52:03] smaller I want that Circle Lord to be
[1:52:07] bigger is that how you feel cuz if we're
[1:52:10] not careful it's like they have one one
[1:52:12] interview of of a certain Rabbi and the
[1:52:14] rabbi speaks out if there's 20 me and my
[1:52:17] son will be in it if there's if there's
[1:52:20] only 10 me and my son will be in it if
[1:52:23] there's only five me and my son will be
[1:52:25] in it and if there's only one I'll be in
[1:52:28] it yeah see he draw that Circle so small
[1:52:31] isn't it incredible how then we our
[1:52:34] faith is to be in a place that if
[1:52:38] there's one that's going to be taken out
[1:52:39] of here in a Rapture that's going to be
[1:52:41] me that's our
[1:52:43] faith but not to have a pride to where
[1:52:47] we look at it that I'm the only one
[1:52:50] right if everybody was like me in this
[1:52:53] church if everybody did this and friends
[1:52:57] you don't realize that there can be
[1:52:59] certain little things look we're going
[1:53:00] to see little shortcomings in one
[1:53:02] another right are you hearing me in one
[1:53:05] another but let's make sure that we look
[1:53:07] at the mirror as well too cuz if you
[1:53:09] don't look in the mirror you might leave
[1:53:11] out of the house and you got your shirt
[1:53:12] on
[1:53:14] backwards come on I know a number of
[1:53:16] people that's happened to I'm not going
[1:53:17] to call it their
[1:53:18] name you got to look at you got to look
[1:53:20] at yourself in the mirror I got to look
[1:53:21] at myself in the
[1:53:23] mirror we can't just look way right out
[1:53:26] there and look when we see other things
[1:53:28] it's like I told you with other things
[1:53:29] that I could see that I could see that
[1:53:31] it seems like this is going off a little
[1:53:33] bit right here and it's taking this and
[1:53:35] putting emphasis over here a little bit
[1:53:37] like that and I look at all that you
[1:53:38] know what it brings me to a place to do
[1:53:40] when I look at it first of all I said
[1:53:41] God let my attitude stay
[1:53:44] right let my heart stay right with what
[1:53:47] I'm
[1:53:49] saying brother Samuel do you discuss it
[1:53:51] no no because let me tell you something
[1:53:54] just because somebody listen to me very
[1:53:56] carefully just because somebody can be a
[1:53:58] little off in one area doesn't mean
[1:54:00] they're off all together right and if
[1:54:03] you go to start talking about all those
[1:54:05] things what if I brought my boys in and
[1:54:07] talk to them about certain things I
[1:54:08] don't do that I don't do that in my home
[1:54:10] you know why because that God can use
[1:54:12] men of God that maybe there's certain
[1:54:14] ways and certain emphasis and this and
[1:54:16] that God can use them to help them
[1:54:20] that's true I don't want to hinder that
[1:54:23] do you I don't want to hinder that I say
[1:54:26] God help us help me Lord help me to have
[1:54:28] the right attitude help me to have the
[1:54:30] right Spirit Lord help me not that there
[1:54:33] might be something that God can test us
[1:54:35] with that's something that we might see
[1:54:37] in the word of God and maybe there'll be
[1:54:39] a little brother that would stand right
[1:54:41] here and maybe there's something that he
[1:54:42] would say that's just not it just shows
[1:54:44] that maybe is not read further in the
[1:54:47] message right it's like I had a brother
[1:54:49] had a brother here some years back and
[1:54:52] he was he was speaking on the Holy Ghost
[1:54:54] and so after the service we got out and
[1:54:57] and we were talking and I took him for a
[1:54:58] bite to eat and we got there talking and
[1:55:00] then we begin to look and I said uh we
[1:55:03] got to just kind of fellowshipping on on
[1:55:04] some of the things I said have you ever
[1:55:06] have you ever heard this quote have you
[1:55:07] ever heard this one no Brother Sam I
[1:55:09] said I said brother BR says this over
[1:55:11] here and this says this here well anyhow
[1:55:13] it opened it up to where that what he
[1:55:16] was speaking at that point there was
[1:55:18] more light upon the holy ghost that's so
[1:55:22] good so that it's not two separate
[1:55:24] things you're not born again and then
[1:55:26] you get the Holy Ghost but it's one
[1:55:29] subsequent event see it's tracing it all
[1:55:32] the way down through but God gives us
[1:55:34] Grace it's how I approach now what if I
[1:55:35] would approach that brother and said you
[1:55:37] know what what in the world was you
[1:55:38] talking about
[1:55:39] tonight but you know what there's a lot
[1:55:41] of good things you
[1:55:43] said and I'm not going to tell you his
[1:55:45] name there's a lot of good things he
[1:55:47] said no he he walked away from the truth
[1:55:49] or nothing like that good very good
[1:55:51] brother faithful brother but there's
[1:55:52] just sometimes there's certain things
[1:55:54] and listen I would want somebody to do
[1:55:56] that to me I would want somebody to say
[1:55:59] brother samel have you seen this quote
[1:56:01] have you seen this scripture have you
[1:56:03] looked at this have you considered that
[1:56:05] I would want somebody to do that for me
[1:56:07] I want a brother to help
[1:56:09] me but God help us help us help us not
[1:56:14] to where it becomes now it just gets
[1:56:17] such a place and if we're not careful
[1:56:19] that circle gets so tight to where now
[1:56:21] it go goes down and it's now just us and
[1:56:24] these 10 then it's these four then it
[1:56:27] gets down from these four and it's just
[1:56:29] us and our family and then pretty soon
[1:56:32] why does our family need to fellowship
[1:56:33] with all you all wow and then this
[1:56:37] family it gets down so tight to where
[1:56:40] they can start looking at one another
[1:56:42] yeah that's good it gets so
[1:56:45] tight friends I'm not talking about
[1:56:48] looseness but I'm talking about when
[1:56:51] there's differences
[1:56:53] and how we look at things even in the
[1:56:56] midst of wrong we're tested on our
[1:57:00] attitude I say God help us that is so
[1:57:03] good I know this may not be a shouting
[1:57:05] message but I say God help us if God
[1:57:08] will give us Grace it'll give us the
[1:57:09] strength that we need to ply our hearts
[1:57:12] for
[1:57:13] hindrances to move out of our
[1:57:16] Lives let's just
[1:57:20] pray anybody want to be remembered
[1:57:22] prayer yes I do I sure
[1:57:26] do let's pray for one
[1:57:30] another Heavenly
[1:57:34] Father Lord
[1:57:38] Jesus sometimes Lord the ways that
[1:57:42] you as you come and you speak to us
[1:57:46] Lord you help us Lord so so deeply
[1:57:53] Lord what you've asked for us Lord even
[1:57:55] here today it can apply over and over in
[1:57:59] our
[1:58:01] lives Lord humbling ourselves to
[1:58:05] you is Lord when the
[1:58:07] word has come across Lord our
[1:58:11] pathway when the word of God has
[1:58:14] dealt with our lives in our
[1:58:17] hearts what do we do at that time
[1:58:22] Lord we want to Humble ourselves under
[1:58:25] the mighty hand of God lord as you deal
[1:58:28] with us and you speak to our
[1:58:31] hearts help us
[1:58:34] Lord father as I thank Lord as your
[1:58:38] Prophet tells us this bride being a word
[1:58:41] bride she must be
[1:58:43] Tried by every word of
[1:58:46] God and
[1:58:49] Lord I pray that Lord Jesus
[1:58:53] sometimes lord it's not so much about
[1:58:57] Doctrine but Lord we're
[1:59:00] tried in our
[1:59:02] character of how that we will
[1:59:06] approach certain
[1:59:08] things sometimes Lord when someone Lord
[1:59:12] is maybe they've they've done something
[1:59:14] wrong something that's very offensive to
[1:59:17] us
[1:59:18] Lord that can cause that AR against
[1:59:22] spirit cuz Satan is an
[1:59:24] opportunist he'll come right around his
[1:59:26] whole objective he doesn't care it's him
[1:59:29] that's doing it he can cause Lord
[1:59:32] somebody to say something that we think
[1:59:35] is wrong he can have something to be
[1:59:38] said it could offend us that's one thing
[1:59:43] now what what do we do from that
[1:59:47] point Lord it can become a trap in our
[1:59:50] lives a hind
[1:59:53] hindrance it may not even be something
[1:59:56] we'd ever say out
[1:59:59] outwardly Lord knowing there's many
[2:00:01] other quotes and scriptures right here
[2:00:02] laying before
[2:00:04] me but I believe you've already spoken
[2:00:07] the whole continuity of
[2:00:09] it your Prophet would say it over and
[2:00:11] over whenever you
[2:00:13] think you're better than somebody
[2:00:16] else whenever you think they're wrong
[2:00:20] now obviously Lord
[2:00:23] there's times when there's things that
[2:00:25] we can see what is wrong it isn't that
[2:00:27] everything we're going to look at and
[2:00:28] say oh I'm just going to ignore and it's
[2:00:30] everything is right no that's that's not
[2:00:32] what it is but sometimes Lord how that
[2:00:35] we approach it in our own
[2:00:39] lives will we look down at that
[2:00:43] person look down upon them
[2:00:47] Lord disassociate dis
[2:00:50] disfellowship hold him at arms length
[2:00:53] Lord sometimes it isn't even in body it
[2:00:54] happens in
[2:00:57] families help us Lord you
[2:01:01] permit
[2:01:04] these tests and trials you permit these
[2:01:07] things to come our
[2:01:09] way now Lord may you help us give us
[2:01:12] Grace that's what we're asking for to
[2:01:15] submit ourselves Lord more fully to you
[2:01:20] Lord help us these are These are times
[2:01:23] Lord
[2:01:24] where you can come in and move in a
[2:01:26] greater way in our
[2:01:29] lives help us Lord as
[2:01:31] we take inventory help us to look at our
[2:01:35] own lives examine our own lives Lord
[2:01:39] looking back over
[2:01:41] them help us Lord I
[2:01:45] pray Lord when we've seen wrong or we
[2:01:49] see certain things in a certain way
[2:01:52] help
[2:01:53] us God help us Lord not to have the
[2:01:57] wrong
[2:01:59] attitude Paul would even warn those Lord
[2:02:02] in the Corinthian Church of how that
[2:02:03] knowledge puffs up but charity would
[2:02:07] edify someone may not have a certain
[2:02:10] understanding
[2:02:11] yet when Paul would speak about a weak
[2:02:14] conscience he spoke it wasn't that that
[2:02:16] was a weak person it was simply that
[2:02:19] they lacked the understanding
[2:02:24] at that
[2:02:25] time Lord help
[2:02:28] us that our lives can be so
[2:02:31] conducted by the love of
[2:02:34] God lord our heart's desire like we open
[2:02:37] this
[2:02:39] service we want more of
[2:02:43] you we see the contrast with the
[2:02:45] Pharisee and the Publican the Pharisee
[2:02:48] was in himself
[2:02:52] so thankful he wasn't like other
[2:02:56] people but Lord
[2:02:59] God that Publican couldn't even lift up
[2:03:02] his
[2:03:04] head there wasn't Lord any any arguments
[2:03:08] that he had he just he smoted his heart
[2:03:10] and
[2:03:11] said God be merciful to me a
[2:03:15] sinner and his
[2:03:17] heart his heart had been opened to
[2:03:23] you the other one stood there I don't
[2:03:26] know maybe he might have even prayed
[2:03:28] such a long time I don't know but his
[2:03:31] heart was not
[2:03:34] open Lord that's why you come Lord
[2:03:38] service after
[2:03:40] service time and time again is that our
[2:03:44] hearts might be open to you
[2:03:48] Lord Lord help us Satan Lord God is
[2:03:54] continuously
[2:03:56] working Lord trying to Lord with all
[2:03:58] kinds of smoke strings and distractions
[2:04:00] and things Lord to get us away from that
[2:04:03] place of really
[2:04:06] reflecting in our own
[2:04:08] lives Lord
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:12] Jesus when those astronauts climb into
[2:04:14] that spaceship that on the
[2:04:18] Launchpad they begin to look at every
[2:04:20] one of those instrument struments that
[2:04:22] are there and they begin to check and
[2:04:24] double
[2:04:26] check they examine all of that they have
[2:04:29] been through it time and time again
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:35] Lord we want to
[2:04:38] look at that little dial of
[2:04:41] attitude we want to look at that little
[2:04:43] dial of
[2:04:46] Pride we want to look at that little
[2:04:48] dial
[2:04:49] Lord oh God
[2:04:55] remember us
[2:04:58] Lord Lord Jesus that you would come and
[2:05:01] speak something so
[2:05:06] personal so tender to our lives
[2:05:09] Lord and call us to a deeper Walk with
[2:05:13] You
[2:05:15] Lord examine my life
[2:05:18] Lord examine my life Lord
[2:05:24] Lord if there's there's anything in me
[2:05:27] Lord if there's Pride there's things
[2:05:30] Lord that oh God throughout the time and
[2:05:32] the years that you've brought to my
[2:05:36] attention and through situations oh
[2:05:39] [Music]
[2:05:41] God examine Lord examine Our Lives
[2:05:46] Lord help us
[2:05:48] Lord granted Lord help us Lord I pray
[2:05:53] pray Lord I ask this morning if there's
[2:05:56] one that doesn't know you in that real
[2:05:58] way maybe Lord in their heart they can
[2:06:00] say to you
[2:06:03] Lord I want that
[2:06:06] love that's so much deeper that spoke
[2:06:10] about it's it's
[2:06:11] deeper I want that love Lord in my life
[2:06:15] I want that love Lord that has been
[2:06:18] spoken
[2:06:19] about I want you to have the uppermost
[2:06:22] seat in my life
[2:06:24] Lord I don't want my way I want your way
[2:06:29] Lord I want that strength that's able to
[2:06:32] stand there Lord God the love of God in
[2:06:35] my heart a
[2:06:38] strength that's able to pull my heart in
[2:06:40] line
[2:06:43] Lord and when others Lord when I would
[2:06:47] see wrong or see something that I may
[2:06:51] not I may not agree
[2:06:54] with or maybe when I've been
[2:06:57] wronged Lord give me a
[2:07:00] love that love Lord Jesus that you've
[2:07:04] had for me I I don't have to look to
[2:07:07] nobody else there's a lot of examples
[2:07:10] but I can look in my own life like Paul
[2:07:13] could speak to the Thessalon nikan
[2:07:15] church and say you are taught by
[2:07:19] God on how to love
[2:07:22] I think about it Lord how many times
[2:07:26] that you've come to
[2:07:28] me when I didn't deserve it
[2:07:31] Lord how many times Lord that father in
[2:07:35] different one times Lord that maybe in
[2:07:38] my
[2:07:39] thoughts just not right where they need
[2:07:41] to
[2:07:42] be perplexed maybe
[2:07:46] frustrated things Lord that would move
[2:07:49] how can this be but Lord
[2:07:52] God you would sweep
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:07:58] down and you would convict
[2:08:02] me oh
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:06] God help us
[2:08:09] Lord help us Lord to be more
[2:08:15] tender we live Lord
[2:08:17] God like Isaiah said
[2:08:20] Lord I live among an unclean
[2:08:23] people situations all around but oh God
[2:08:27] tender us
[2:08:28] Lord tender us Lord I
[2:08:31] pray help us
[2:08:34] Lord I Thank Lord God you know as I was
[2:08:37] just talking with you the other
[2:08:39] day many miracles many things that Lord
[2:08:42] that I've been privileged to see you
[2:08:46] do healing and many things seeing lives
[2:08:50] change Lord filled with your
[2:08:53] spirit and I've watched Lord
[2:08:56] God even when it would come to Healing
[2:08:59] if we tar long enough we'll get sick
[2:09:02] again but
[2:09:05] Lord what could be the crowning
[2:09:11] achievement is the love of
[2:09:13] God
[2:09:15] having its perfect way in our lives
[2:09:21] help us Lord I
[2:09:24] pray help us
[2:09:28] Lord Lord

[2:09:33] myself and this congregation into your
[2:09:36] hands Lord we're nothing without
[2:09:40] you as a pastor as a minister I'm
