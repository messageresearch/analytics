actually retired after the last Sunday night so you all pray for me because it looks like they're gonna be living pretty close to me amen no I love my father-in-law and mother-in-law God has given me some real good in-laws and I just really appreciate him well let's go on into the word this morning so good to be here in it amen let's go to revelations chapter 1 and we're just gonna start reading right there and just ask the Lord that he would just help us and I heard some of the requests I know that we have been praying for different ones that have not been feeling well and we're battling those parts of sickness and things but just want to just say we want to just continue to hold each and every one of them up in prayer that are not that are not here that are not feeling well and we just so thankful to God for His mercy you know every time as we've been looking at a midweek service every time is God you know God will permit sickness to come but then through that right there he just makes known the earnest of the Resurrection as it moves over our life and he brings healing because there's no one that can reverse that you know medicine itself does not heal medicine only aids in the healing process revelations chapter 1 verse 4 and verse it through verse 6 John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us in that just wonderful and this is what he his love was so great that he came down and washed us from our sins in his own blood he didn't just forgive us but he actually loosened us from that identity of that first nature that we were under he meant by the by the change aren't you grateful the Holy Ghost has made a way it loosens us from that old past and it ties us in to the word amen where there was a chasm in our life now there is one who has come to do away with the chasm in our life no longer a separation between us and God and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen let's just bow our heads an order prayer if you have a need on your heart you want to be remembered just lift it up before the Lord right now and let's just go as a congregation of believers this morning let's go before the end the presence of God before the throne of God Heavenly Father Lord we come this morning Lord o God with the assurance of the blood that has went before his Lord and all God through the way that has been open to us Lord that was closed out from man and the only one that could make that way back into the holiest of Holies back to the Tree of Life oh God it had to be you to become one of us Lord and to lead and open up that way and father this morning there are needs upon hearts behind these hands this morning and father we realize oh god that Lord you're the answer you're the dissolver of every doubt and Lord for every question Lord and father for every need Lord we just commit that Lord into your hands this morning and we ask that God you'll take as a speaker and hear and God that you would move Lord soul upon every need Oh God and father in all things that you would receive glory to yourself Lord or father may you just continue to move among us now Lord in the service we pray God and just reconciling lo hearts Lord unto yourself o God we love you and thank you now father in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and may God bless you being seated you know there's things that when we look at in the scripture we begin last week and looking at the crowning of our lives and I want to continue that thought but I want to look at that just a little bit more this morning in a fault of it because we've been coming out of that in numbers 15 we're still in there but just looking in some of the parts to realize that where we are at and what God has called us to and we see within the scriptures here such a beautiful reality where it says he hath made us he hath made us not we have made ourselves the gospel is not a self-help program the gospel is not a Reformation but the gospel brings transformation and he the Bible as it says he hath made us it is salvation is completely the doing of the Lord the Bible says salvation is of the Lord it's all of grace he has redeemed us for his purpose and here is the aspect that I want to deal with here this morning is in that first part he hath made us kings because we are kings spiritual kings right now we're going to be Kings upon the earth in that of the Millennium after here the rapture and after the tribulation after Armageddon and after all that is set forth there we are going to rule and reign with him here upon this earth for a thousand years and then we know that leads in the future home but yet here is the promise right now that in itself is the is the very key right now we are kings and spiritual kings and we're going to be Kings upon the earth him when he sets on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we are reigning over a spiritual Kingdom right now we are reigning with Christ we have dominion over sin over the world over the devil over the flesh amen its Christ himself and through that reigning in our life it declares to him it shows forth his praise and glory it is actually Almighty God showing forth his own glory his own victory through our life to think of it in this respect that the sin that once ruled you you now rule it this is what the power that is within the blood of Jesus Christ where the holy spirit can move into alive and become seated in the in throne in the throne of our heart in power it's no longer it's no longer our strength our might but now it is his strenght working through us you know the Bible would say it over even in the revelations chapter 15 it would speak of even those who overcome there at the end of the tribulation and throughout they would say and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy way are thy ways thou king of saints he is the coming king of this earth remember the world itself think of it now as we've looked at this many times the earth is not the world the world is the system that's upon the earth the Bible would say the kingdoms of this world to think of it that is just like with in your life and in my life that once the Spirit of God as it moves into alive it overthrows that administration that swea that hold that was upon our life we were under that influence the Bible says in Ephesians 2 we walked according to the prints and power of the air we were dead in sin and trespasses you understand what I'm saying but now the Spirit of God has come to quicken it raises up that seed of that life on the inside we are no longer under the Dominion of the darkness of this world but by the Spirit of God we have been delivered and translated into the kingdom of his dear son so he is the king the coming king of this earth and he is our king he is the king of saints right now it's a spiritual Kingdom and how Dominion right now is the Dominion over sin and it is in force through the power that is in the Spirit of Christ that indwells us one thing that I want you just just to notice as we look at here very briefly I want you to notice how the scripture is wrote there he hath made us kings and priests it does not say he had made us priests and kings because you first of all must come under the blood and in the authority by the Holy Spirit to wear that in your life there comes the ruling authority of the Holy Ghost that empowers you and I as a son and daughter of God and then through that life within us we can truly operate as priests of God so to think of it we are we are already a son and daughter of God but what the Holy Ghost does it comes to release the authority of sonship in our life so it's no longer your word but it's God's Word it's God speaking the word through you it's God backing up that word behind what is being spoken amen so it is the authority of his life living in us now as Kings we are reigning with our King in his domain over the devil over sin over the world and over the flesh we are living in him above sin through the consecration of his life in us we are ministering unto him as his chosen bride like those faithful Gentile lawyers that reckon David as the king who was coming into power there's something about it that they began to recognize that David was anointed king and they recognized David is coming into power I want you to think of this here he had already been anointed by the word of the Lord has the anointing oil was poured out upon his head from the Horn of the RAM that was held in the hand of the prophet that brought the word of the Lord to him personally Amen you recall in the scriptures where it speaks of David and his member with that of Saul when saw himself he you know many times Saul would come under situations and they would be pressure that was around him and so would act out according to his own self will saw had never received the overcoming of his own self will reign with me now we've all made mistakes but the reality is is that when there is that overcoming power within you and I there is the reality that as we yield to that the greater is He that is in you and I then is greater than he that's in the world there isn't over coming to our life Oh glory be to God you recall that what God spoke to Saul he said he has ripped the kingdom from you and given it to a neighbor one that was very close but it was in that of the closeness I want you to think of this that Saul himself was still holding the title of King listen to me now he was still holding the title of King he was still you know holding that a position he could operate and say go here go there he could send that word and this would this was taking place and that was taking place but the reality is that the kingdom had already departed from Saul's life now the kingdom and it departed even though he can say I'm still over all Israel but the kingdom is not that of an earthly domain it's not of houses it's not of people but the kingdom is the person of Jesus Christ for has he stood up and said the strength of Israel will not lie the strength of Israel was not in a man who was head and shoulders above all the rest and who looked like other kings and maybe he could handle a sword that was not the strength but the strength of Israel was in the Living God that was there to back up his word as his children would stand there upon the ladder fortified that's the real kingdom of God so we see that it is the anointed where the person of Jesus Christ is the kingdom in John 18:36 jesus answered and he said My Kingdom is not of this world here he is standing in pilots Jasmine Hall My Kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight what do you think about this Jesus is letting it be known that if this was my kingdom then my servants my subjects would fight for this in order for it to be maintained but his kingdom was not of this world there had to be a price that was paid in order to purchase back and to bring what was lost through it at homei from the very beginning remember when the fall took place in Eden in the fall that took place remember here was man and now after the fall has taken place but title deed it goes back into the hand of the original one the only way that that title deed can come back where in that the earth itself is there is established or restored under its rightful position under that of sons and daughters of God there must come the Son of God that is able to pay the price and restore it back to its original position but before the earth can never come back to its original glory and its original position there's got to be sentence and daughters of God that are anointed to rule and reign on this of the earth they've got to come back to that position I say the earth is groaning and travailing for the matter station of the sons and daughters of God they met my kingdom it's not of this world we give the world their police they've got their position not in here but as you know they've got their place they've got their position they've only there's only a short amount of time you understand what I'm saying why lives are not occupied with walking around with picket signs and we're going to make this world a better place you are not going to make this world a better place this world already has a sentence of judgment upon it are you with me even when you read in the Book of Jeremiah and through the prophets God never spelled it's from it spared Israel even though Israel was his chosen people but God let him know I will pour out my wrath and my theory because they have rejected me and God Himself I'm telling you it's coming here very shortly we're already seeing the outpouring of the wrath of God look in this hour the Bible says in the times of Noah that the people themselves it was a spirit of destruction that was upon the land we see the spirit of destruction not out just out there but you see it even in people that walk away from this revealed truth the spirit of destruction is upon them it's a satanic anointing to try and destroy but let me tell you something you're fighting against God you'll never overthrow the kingdom of Almighty God glory be to God that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from his plan are therefore said unto Him art our kingdom jesus answered thou sayest that I'm a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice now Pilate could say he was a king but did it have any effect on his life no it's just like many can say that he's their king they can say well Jesus is Mike is it is it just saying it that makes him your king or is it that there must come the enthronement that will reflect the Kingdom that you are a part of it must be the king himself you and I cannot join this kingdom we cannot come into this kingdom of our own accord we must be pawn first Corinthians 12 we are baptized by one spirit into one Kingdom one body that of the word the Living God and mana to where the king itself is reflected through our life because the Bible says no man call his him lord but by the holy ghost amen the witness of the Holy Ghost in the person's life said indeed I have been loosed from sin I know I know I have been set free are you with me because from within you know that there is a loosening the desires of the things of the world have thread from your life and Christ is everything to you Oh mommy I think you're a little bit radnik radical it's just because you're not in this kingdom if you is in this kingdom and you've seen there what the reality of it but you see nobody can see the kingdom of God understand it unless they are born again you've got to have a new birth or else you'll place it out here that the kingdom of God is the socialization of people you'll put it out here that the kingdom of God is a group of people you'll put it out there that the team of God is programs Creed's dogmas and everything else but the kingdom of God is none of those things the kingdom of God is the person of Jesus Christ Almighty God the deity of Almighty God setting forth within our lives him and that's the kingdom notice in John 17:20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you now remember the kingdom of heaven is to be set up here upon the earth but that part of the kingdom of heaven is goes first by that of the kingdom of God which is the Holy Spirit the Word made flesh in you it cometh not with observation oh my to think about it through the preaching of the word and it can happen while the words being preached it doesn't have to be in some certain location it deals with the condition of the heart where the Holy Spirit Himself is able to draw a life to complete surrender to say I no longer want my own way I matter of fact if I could say it like this I'm tired of being Samuel I really want to be changed you come to a place like Jacob came to Jacob said I'm sick of me and Jacob and you know it was that was exactly what God's desire was for his life because God wanted to release that mystery of the Israel that was tucked down in there in seed form Oh glory now notice how Paul would go on to express this in first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power remember what Paul is dealing with here he's got opposition that's coming along and different ones are puffed up and they're saying all these words and Paul lets a know that your words mean nothing it's what is behind it the words themselves that in itself is not the kingdom of God but the kingdom of God is the power that makes the word alive Oh glory be to God for our authority our authority in this hour is under the message and the messenger that's where our authority comes from it comes from the word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Hebrews 12 27 and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things which are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved certainly not a kingdom of this world this is not a kingdom that has within it the strengths or efforts of a man this kingdom is not set up nor established by that of a man this is the kingdom of Almighty God this is the kingdom that God has set forth that he had within his mind before the foundation of the world and he would unfold this kingdom to you and I in our hearts notice wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God except ibly with reverence and godly fear is that not our desire when the kingdom of God this is really in another part of that of priesthood that moves into our lives but the first part is that a kingship of where it moves into our life in a ruling and reigning or over that of sin the world Dominion of flesh and so forth but now our desire is Lord I want to please you this is where the last part of that verse comes in once we have been birthed into that Kingdom the full desire of our hearts is to please him as a matter of fact through every day of our life every moment there is a tension that is about our life and that tension is a great blessing and the tension is is my life pleasing to you lord how could we ask that because by the birth of the Holy Spirit through the revealing of the word it brings us back into the place we no longer want our own choice we do not trust our senses we do not trust our mind we do not trust our flesh we only trust thus saith the Lord because we have the witness in our life what it has done in us and is doing through us this is our only trust glory be to God for our God is a consuming fire not to think of it that their various if there is the contest or contests that its own it will always this kingdom moving into alive this kingdom has been contested it will continue to be contested remember what Jesus said when he spoke there in Matthew 16:18 he said upon this rock I will build my church he did not build it upon a man he didn't build it there upon the church upon a creed upon a doctrine he builded upon the revelation of who he is no repeater God and he said the gates of Hell shall not prevail against you it shows hell would be and hell is still against this revelation of Jesus Christ it's that which is contested that's why we must have the Word of God may power in our lives because when the word has made power in our life it's like a tug-of-war are you with me it's like a tug of war when the word has made power in our life it is the strength of that word in our life to wear when the enemy comes to contest that revelation this guy feels it our spirit feels it but what's he contesting he's contesting to see where is that word position in your life that's why he came to the Lord Jesus he came to contest and see where is that word position in his life you don't have to be a great big strong muscular person and let me just put it this way you don't have to be a great big strong muscular person you can quote this and finish this and finish that remember that's not what it was when Jesus said it is written it was at that moment that the Spirit of God that had quickened a word to his life it was in those moments of temptation that the word come to address the situation that was present in his life it was not by his supernatural power that he defeated the enemy remember it was the power dwelling within that could take the word and Jesus in his weakest moment maybe you know it took him a minute to get out that statement he wasn't standing there saying glory to God in the name of you know and going through him know he won doing that maybe it was just it is it is written his weakness within his flesh from being hunger had nothing to do with casting out the devil it is the authority of the word in your life that backs the devil up lets you and I know that the weakest Christian when the weakest Christian goes to his knees when the weakest Christian will stand on that saith the Lord and everything surrounding is against it Satan must recognize the authority the badge of believer our day that is coming into power in Psalms 18 verse 29 notice this this particular Psalm it breaks over many of the Psalms you'll recognize how they will break over into that of even the Messianic Empire even a that of the Advent the first coming of the Lord Jesus and carry Claire on over into that of the millennium in future hope in Psalms 1829 here is David's testimony for baazi I have run through a troop and by my god have I lived over a wall did David have all positions sure he did was everybody for David no matter of fact saul was trying to kill him but it wasn't saul david recognized it was a spirit what character David was able to stand there this was not David's DNA this was the spiritual revealed truth there was some molded David's character - David though they would tried to pull him in realms of the flesh in order to try to fight this battle remember Joe have when they caught Saul in a cage he said hey buddy here's your chance man you can do him in right here but David remember David is one a character that will honor the word even in situations where things are all David would not allow there to be license for him glory to God license for him to act outside of the character of the word why it is a character that is coming into power who may god help us but our characters can be so molded and shaped by his spirit verse 30 asks for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord has tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him for who is God save the Lord or who is a rock save our God is it is God that girded me with strength and maketh my way perfect over there and it sounds like he's bragging on God a lot this guy you sure this is the king this sounds like a weakling no it'll sound like a weak knee you're just looking at it through the eyes of the world what David is recognized I am King by the authority of the kingdom of the strength of Israel that is backing up the word you will hold my when Samuel was there with the horn of the RAM you realize when Samuel was pouring out the anointing oil you realize what that anointing oil oil represented it was the world that God had spoke and released a Samuel that I have chosen me a king this is not a man-made choice the people chose Saul but my choice I want you to go and anoint them the anointing of the humble oil was that of the word breaking upon David's life it was bringing David into position of what God was anointing and what God had intended for his life that's why the real anointing of the Holy Ghost when it moves down upon the soul in the life it brings you and I in line with the word because it is the Spirit of Truth that positions us in Jesus Christ that's why the bride is not just under an anointing hallelujah we're not being taken back to feelings nothing against the feelings but it's what does the life do after that there might be feelings but remember God has already come in this hour the Holy Spirit Saru Bible has brought the plumb line of the word so that Jerusalem come on now we are to be inhabited as the temple of Almighty God the plumb line itself had to be laid out in order that God might inhabit our lives or glory be to God it is God that Gerdes me with strength and maketh my way perfect they just said his ways perfect but then he lets us know he makes my way perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds feet like a deer like a deer there's times you need to escape and there's times you also you need to move come on now you need to have Liberty to move glory and setteth me upon high places heavenly places in Christ this is what he does he says he teaches my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms now this very thing right here would seem like you know he's not out there - strongman competition and you know trying to you know do all these things know the bowl of Steel this was all representative of when there would be an opposing army getting ready to come against another one when this very thing was sent in it was bent it was sent in there to the city they were getting ready to come against what they sent in was a representation of the strength and force that's coming your way amen who is behind us God is behind us glory thou has also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand have holding me up and that gentleness hath made me great thou has enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip look at this in verse 37 I have pursued mine enemies this will not only pertain to David but it also breaks over in pertaining to our Lord Jesus Christ I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them neither did I turn again till they were consumed I have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are fallen under my feet has he not put everything under his feet for thou hast hurted me with strength unto the battle thou hath subdued under me those that rise up against me how David is coming into power the Bible tells us in Hebrews 2 he says for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings and this is one thing that I love we could just preach on this a while but you know when you read through the Book of Psalms you find something about David you never find about Saul so never proclaims that God is his king you never find Saul worshiping that way but you find David over and over in the Psalms well David's a God is my king he is the king of this king he is the ruler of this ruler David knew his position his authority terrain was under the world you never find that we saw but with David you find one who is in position he realized brother Doug that his authority his power it came from the king himself glory be to God I want you to think about it the Bible says when they were leading away our Lord Jesus to Calvary he says and they made they made man made a crown of thorns there's a lot of a group you type here when you go back into the tabernacle and you think of the mercy seat and things but let me just move ahead with this they man made gave him a crown of thorns and as that right they put that crown of thorns upon his head blood was coming down and as he walked to Calvary but for every son and daughter of God where he's already opened up the way and he brings you an eye unto glory brother Joey the prophet said it like this he said we we as sons and daughters of God when we've been reconciled through him by the blood of Jesus Christ born of the Spirit of God he said we are taking off the crown of thorns from off of his head and he said he is crowned as king in our lives and our lives give him his rightful position of praise of glory of honor of adoration Oh hallelujah revelations 3 verse 11 behold here's to the Philadelphian age behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown now we realize that for this admonition remembered the admonition given by the Spirit of God it would admonish the aged both groups would hear it true and false and God remember he would speak but it would be that of the true that they themselves will never ever come to see how close they can get to the world but their desire is to please the Lord if there happens to be something they would get a little cold the Spirit of God in that of holding true to his word is there to bring back that person back in line now I don't believe let me just say it very quickly I do not believe as a child of God as an elect seed of God that our lives are to be up and down up and down up and down I don't believe that at all I believe that our lives it isn't that everything is all the way up here and we never have any down times but what I am trying to say is I believe that there is victory that we have access to in our lives that we can actually live out in victory every day of our life even when there's discouragement even when there's disappointment even when there's sickness even when there's trouble I believe with all of my heart that this is the victory that the Lord Jesus has provided for us because he said my peace I leave with you sometimes we just need our eyes renewed in order to be able to look at things in the right way and the Lord helps us is that right now notice this brethren would pick this up here and he would say we don't need to comment on the thought that he is coming quickly we know that he is because we are in the end of the last days he says but he goes on to say hold fast what you have that no man take your crown it is in the midst of the time of great trouble we we see that's prophesied all the way through it's in the midst of the time of great trouble that Jesus comes and with his coming there is a resurrection many are to come forth out of the dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return and the we'll be given crowns why because they are sons of God they are kings with him they are reigning with him that is what the crown signifies reigning and ruling with the great king himself so right now we are ruling and reigning with the crown of the Holy Ghost upon our life and that crown of the Holy Ghost upon a live moving within our life it's moving us for the awaiting of that crown what is that crown we're talking about that of a new body that's a crowning of it it's God's crowning achievement now notice this he says this is the promise for all those who suffer with him here on earth all those who endured patiently knowing that God the just judge would reward them they look at the qualities they who gave up all for him and committed all to him will sit down in his throne and share in his glorious Kingdom what you and I have had to give up you know what I don't miss it wonder what he did for me I don't miss it at all I'm not looking that hole he had to take this not you know why why are you not because the love of it's going I don't love it no more I'm not fighting oh my oh I don't want it listening no longer the fight the fight you see this is why you've got to get the battle on the inside you've got to get the soldier down they're not just here but down there that's the kingdom behind glory be to God it's a no comparison well you and I have had to give up no comparison to what awaits you and I and not just what awaits you and I it's joy right now it's wonderful right now they serve the Lord I only wish I only wish he'd got a hold of my life sooner find the reason he didn't because my old stubborn rock head and my old stubborn will while I could do it and I would try to do with this and I'll try to do with that but eventually God let it run to the end of its course and say are you fear are you tired of trying are you trying to tired of trying to do it finally you know God let you do that you say what's that lock it's like you right now if I tried to sign you up to swim from Lake Erie and swim out there to the lighthouse there might be something said man I'm feeling pretty good in mana I've got pretty good lungs and I got pretty good at this and you get out there in the middle of Lake your look comes with me you know what eventually and what happens there's somebody that can help you already but you've got to get out there too you finally get tired and when you finally get tired and say Lord I'm tired of trying I need help and God says that's just why waiting long that's a little bit on that one hallelujah now watch this and we have a word for us all at this time see we realize that these writings when it says to the churches in Asia we realize that these churches were have held characteristic of a actual ages they were churches but they held characteristics that would be distinct to a time of where Christ would be calling out a Gentile bride is that right now notice there is a word so all of this would pertain even to our lives right now not just to the Philadelphian age we have a word for us in this time look at this admonition here this morning then he says it is hold fast persevere woo we've got a persevere that means there's going to be opposition means you're going to have to fight but it's just how you're looking at the fight are you with notice don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he has given you use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is the king of kings and the Lord of lords now you realize that here we are in this time the Bible it's rare out of it in in Daniel chapter 12 the Prophet would take it as a text and when he preaches the greatest valour fought because we realize that we are at the ending of time the blending in of eternity we know that very soon very very quickly that the gospel itself will turn to that of the Jews the Gentile bride will be called away in rapture we realize that within our lives right now there is a heading up there is a battle that is taking place the battle that God already knew that would come down in this hour the battle that you and I are facing in this hour is a battle that's very similar to what will take place with Israel where all nations and everything is going to come against Israel and Israel themselves will stand in that time and God will be their strength to stand with 144,000 now within the midst of this time an hour right here remember when the word itself has been opened up the Prophet picks it up in uniting time and sign he said by this revelation going forth it has now calls the churches to unite together against this revealed truth of this hour you see what it is it has it has brought that of a congealing of yeld even denominations that don't even agree they can't even agree on the tenets and creeds and dogmas but you know what it is it is a spiritual power at work in this earth that is bringing them in unity against the revealed word but let's look at it on the other side the Spirit of God is here it is loosed among the people of God it is loosening sin holds it's loosening Dominion it is uniting people of God with the promise in this hour this is the dispensation of the fullness of time where the Spirit of God is calling sons and daughters come home is time for rats huh it's time to go it's time to take our flights so this is where we are so thankful for a certain sound something that holds clarity and this is where the Prophet would pick it up he said prepare for the battle he said you say what battle the coming of prepare yourself not for the battle to battle against evil when evil is besetting the people on every hand everything's going on wrong home life you said D UN's failing nations are breaking up a you have to look very far this nation itself democracy's gone are you with me lord have mercy it's the truth yep well you know there's there's individuals and people that are all within there there's so much things has been shown with hypocrisy and whatever more not just this nation but every other nation because you want to know why the kingdoms of this world are under Satan's control he took the Lord Jesus up on the mountain in temptation and he showed him the kingdoms of this world he said if you only fall down and worship me I'll give you this kingdom but he said thou shalt worship the Lord God and him alone he was not going to bow down why cuz the promise is that the kingdoms belong to him and he would be able to lay claim and bring the kingdoms of this world these nations win that of after the rapture after that the visitation with Israel and Armageddon remember the nations of this world will come under the rule and domain of the king of kings is that right the Scriptures tell us that in Michael Zephaniah Zechariah there will be left over rim nets that will be brought forth oh that's a whole separate message in itself oh my what a battle he says now thinking of this atomic bombs are all around homes are splitting up motherhood's going low in morals among the people and distrust among one another all the denominations fussing and soon what should we do be certain and prepare yourself for the battle so prayer persevere hold fast put on the harm of God use every weapon that's giving you use every gift that's at your disposal and look up with joy let's move just a little bit more ephesians 16 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood and we need to be reminded of that every once in a while we're not fighting against flesh and blood the battle is there to try to pull us out into those realms is that right try to pull us out but it's not the flesh and blood affair but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand our armor is Jesus Christ amen when they when those when Devils see that full armour of God which is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and they can see that it's coming straight from the throne of God from he who has risen and been raised up they are a witness they see not you it's the life that's backing you up [Applause] that's the armor of God amen because now God has sent the armor and here you and I are we're like the policeman the policeman can go out here and put his hand up why is that policeman standing at the intersection every once in a while the lights go out and you've got a policeman standing there they've got on you know the reflective vests and everything else and they're they're too cold hold off and they're to say hold their you can come this way of you you can go around this way and this this individual he's no match for the horse-powered you got our Neath your car I don't care if you've got one of them little smart cars that you can pick up and put in your back pocket he is no match for that car but you know what it is he's got a 40 because he has paid the price he's owned the fleet the police force he has been given a uniform he'd been given a badge he got a gun with more than one bullet not in his pocket it's loaded some of y'all get that one come on now and he has authority when he puts his hand up the cars got to stop you see when you put your hands up I want you to understand this this morning when you put your hands up when you say in your house devil this is enough I ain't going no further you know what it is the Prophet said with the whole armour of God you're on the police force and you are anointed to control with law and order these Devils it's not you and I it is Christ in us he recognizes the badge of believer where you can stand there and say it's enough sometimes we're to mess with the devil there's been some there have been times I'll tell you what seemed like again more frequently I just get right out mad at him this is it you ain't going no further it ain't my madness but you understand what I'm saying hide past so fine with it I've gotta make no peace back with you you ain't going no further you've got that authority that just ain't for a pastor I said you've got that authority then authority has been given to you on the day of Pentecost God sent down himself he sent back the baptism of the Holy Ghost his word and he wrapped himself in his army as the mighty Conqueror Oh blessed be the name of the Lord glory be to God I want you to think of it here in Isaiah 28 verse 5 it says in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of people what is our crown of glory the Holy Ghost this was speaking of the outpouring of the true witness the testimony of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost amen it is the crown upon our life and notice and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in the gate that's what takes place at the altar it is the spirit the Holy Spirit when you yourself said I let go Lord then the Holy Spirit goes and says judgment has already been rendered on that sand on that old nature and you moved out of the way and the Spirit of God releases the authority and you walk out free why judgment he's already the prince of this world has already been judged [Applause] that's why judgment must begin at the house of God hallelujah there's an authority to lift that I love this next part and for strength to them that turned the battle to the gate he is our strength we're standing in the gate what gate are you standing in the same gate where the transaction was made by my kinsman redeemer you got to bring them to the gate the gate is where transactions are made the gates of Hell cannot prevail over this gate right here David said open unto me the gate of righteousness you with me go has went and stood in the gate we are in the gate the entranceway he said I am the way the truth and the life I am the door into the sheepfold he is our strip that turns the battle to the gate you know that says is where we're not trying to take it in our own hands but we recognize not by power not by my not by theology not by memorization of Scripture but by my spirit saith the Lord it's the crown of glory that's upon your head that diadem of beauty Oh hallelujah so when the enemy comes and wants to knock at your door you take the battle to the gate you turn it right to the gate he wants to come with you a sickness you take it right to the gate he took my sickness he took mine Furman ease by his stripes I'm healed he was to come and battle at you and say the Holy Ghost is not for you you can say but he is my Redeemer he has called and dealt with my life I have access to that of the Holy Ghost you need strength for overcoming in your life here he is you can stand there and turn the battle to the gate to him who triumphed over it all hmm kind of sounds like the big brother on the playground noise kind of go just a little bit further thank you I had to get that in quick Ephesians 6 verse 14 stand there for now here once the armor you've got the armor on we're not just walking around and you know everything's polished in matter of fact in this army right now we'll eventually get our dress blues dress greens or whatever more we get that new body but in the meantime wearing our fatigues for those you don't know what that is that's the stuff you can get on the ground and you can you got to fight in and you may have blood on it and you may have dirt on it and you're walking around don't look real pretty but there are things for you to equip you to fight with on the other side the road there's only the signification your dress blues your dress greens and whatever more because you are going to a ceremony stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth how many would agree there's a lot of truth that's not even fit there's a lot of things that's truth that's not even fit to be talked about that's not what you want to gird yourself with because it actually doesn't allow you to move easily it actually impedes your movement this thought of girding up your loins as we're as they would wear those long robes they would actually be able to take the road there from the back and they would tuck it up here in the belt and that they themselves could actually be able to move freely but it were not hindered they were unimpeded in their movement remember here when we look at it in the scripture he was down in Exodus I believe Exodus 12 28 or something when they were eating the lamb the Bible says their loins were girded their staff was in their hand you know they were ready to go at a moment's notice this is what blowings being girded about with truth it's being ready to go at a moment's notice Oh Lord I'm ready to go Lord we want to be ready to go the Bible says in the Book of Luke chapter 12 let your loins be girded about and your lights burning that you are watching as one who is watching for the bridegroom to return that when he returns you might being able to open unto him immediately you are ready to go now being ready to Oh means you're ready to go and being ready to go means you're ready to go and being ready to go means you're ready to go what do you mean it means if there is something that comes up and brother Brian maybe you get sick something comes around and hold the sudden home ah you know the pain I can hardly get out the chair but sister Bob she's right there with a staff in her hand Lauren skirted she's ready to go she reaches over and she lays hands and begins to pray and said Lord Jesus this is my husband he's a provider of this whole and Lord Jesus you've said in your word that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so I'm yielding my hands to you under the authority of your word that you'll release virtue that will move into his back and release him that he will be able to move out of this chair Lauren's are girded you understand what I'm saying we're we're not walking around oh brother Brian I'd love to pray for you but I got to go pray through man I've been through so much stuff I've been doing this and man I had him prayed I had Neiman read I hadn't even done that you realize staying ready is staying in tune with God praying it's not just about being on these knees prayer is always from your heart are you with me this is not an excuse for anything but there were going to be some weeks where maybe that you have and you are more pleased with your walk as far as your time of Prayer your time in the word there's going to be certain things that you will be more pleased in one week than the other but remember your authority is not based on your routine here with me it's just it puts us in that place to say I want to be ready if I'm called upon somebody calls me and said hey there's just an emergency so-and-so was hitting an accident and they're at the point of death will you help me pray see that's being ready to go I said it's being ready to go Oh glory be to God oh my so having on the breastplate of righteousness that's our heart God is so drilling in a heart Lord and let everything let every motive and objective be right the bran would put it this simple he said it's having the word in you and doing what's right not out of fear it's our desire to please him that's the breastplate of righteousness isn't it incredible this whole thing brother Aaron this whole armament it's not like somebody just standing around you know like you walk in a museum but this whole armament it deals with the word inaction in our lives to where even the breastplate of righteousness is allowing the word to come and discern the very secrets and intents of the heart because there sometimes we can have the wrong motive and objective I say a man for all of them Lord I'm their pastor I I'll say man for all of them because we all fall under that that's why we need the word to come and discern our motives and our objectives sometimes when we think men this is the right thing to do and then we realize that words are done there right and then what happens if it if we really allow the Spirit of God after you know we come through all of our time before allow the Spirit of God to really help us say lord help me to be more sensitive help me to be more sensitive and more yielded to you what are you doing you're opening that of your heart yet you would say how can that be a guarding because you are opening it to him and it being open to him you are shutting out the other Oh glory now can I have just a little bit here in verse 15 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace now think about this our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace he himself our bridegroom our Redeemer our Lord our Savior he has already as it says in Revelations 1 he has already when John looked upon him he saw feet like unto a brass as if they burned in the furnace he already tread the fierceness of the wrath of God he bore our judgment he opened to us away he came down here and the Word was made flesh he left us bloody footprints that we could walk in he opened to us the way so much to where it would be recorded even in the book of Hebrews and it would speak in verse 7 he was made a little lower than the Angels now crowns him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of the hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for him that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing look at somebody and say nothing he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him we still see within these bodies we get sick death setting in but we've already had the mean immunization we've already had the curve the cure for the SIF or the snakebite we've already in our soul we've already received healing or one from a z-pack this came from God himself hey man hey mentor do away with that old sin nature amen and bring about a change within our life a transformation and we have that reality that has he raised we have raised with him and notice this in Hebrews 1:14 are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ministering spirits to minister to you to me who are heirs of salvation these ministering spirits as a prophet will put it these ministering spirits are coming straight from the throne of God they come to minister not just the word but they come to minister the spirit of the word they come to minister that spirit now think of it like this when you look at how Micah remember Michael might I however you want to say it when you look at how Michael was standing down there and there was over 400 some prophets and man they and they were anointed but it wasn't ministering spirits from the throne of God how did he discern it he discerned it by the word I don't have no doubts man they might have felt a great in Norton I mean him might have felt all-powerful in there when you know you know SantaCon them were moving around with the horns and everything else but Michael stood there and he knew one thing that the vision of the word that was spoken through Elijah of that judgment God's Word cannot fail and all the rest of a midden paid heed to the Word of God this had gone up gone up but Michael was standing there and remember Michael was brought there because there was a believer by the name of Jehoshaphat that said don't you got one more and here God brought Micah and Michael was anointed with the ministering spirit from the throne of God hallelujah in the face of all that opposition he was standing true to the word and let me tell you something that any spirit that wants to minister and refer back to days gone by and the old traditions and old ideas remember this hour is not an hour of old ideas these are not the thoughts of man this is the inspir duration of the holy ghost that has been poured out in this hour to get a bride ready and in order for rapture amen the opening of this seventh seal the coming of the Lord is the pouring out of the anointing oil upon the head of the bride we have been anointed for a higher we've not been anointed with a vial a vial in ninety is like that of the frogs that look backwards come on somebody but the RAM anointing only looks to the throne hallelujah glory be to God in the highest think about these ministering spirits that are sent forth these are gifts for as you and I to use every gift that God has said in the body the ministering spirits coming through to edify you and I what you've had for the ministering spirit that reaches out and we're conviction struck your heart it wasn't a man it was ministering spirit from the throne of God that dealt with your heart the Holy Spirit dealing with the word and said come home come home and the men the Spirit of God begins to move upon your heart and something rises up and said I'm no longer gonna stay here in this condition I'm going back home this is what David could say the Lord take us my part with them that helped me that's God taking your part the ministering spirits coming along and encouraging you and I the ministering spirit that comes and says you can be born again the ministering spirit says there is healing for you there is deliverance for you that is the ministering spirit set from the throne of God and the Lord is on my side he is with them that helped me that's why brother Ron said we stay right with the word that's why we stay with the word because then there's nothing anointing of Samuel browning upon you come on now but it's now staying under the anointing of the word staying with the word then it is the inspiration I'm the Holy Ghost upon the people where Paul could say that your faith is not established in the enticing words of man's wisdom but your faith is founded in the power of God so that Paul would go on to say in 2nd Corinthians 4:5 we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your sir your servants for Jesus sake see a lot of these verses I'm reading right now it also has to do with the feet being shot with the preparation of the gospel you realize that being shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and as we'll get in here in just a moment here that the word itself the Living Word of God being carried how that the Hallett's are being carried it's being carried by Christ himself the Holy Ghost he's carrying it in the vessels of his chosen believers by the Holy Ghost notice we're not preaching ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake no doubt Paul like any other Minister Paul was the messenger of the age but there might have been things he wanted to minister certain little things that was just so inspiring to him but he had to stay within the line according to what God was dealing for that particular service this is where Paul would go on to say 1st Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 for this calls also thank we God without ceasing because when ye received the Word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the Word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe so our faith it's resting in the power of God now there's no doubt about it I speak to all of us here maybe there's decisions before your decisions you have had to make decisions you will situations that are coming in better in your life or will come in your life and we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit because we have the promise that the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and what we want to do it is to say Lord I don't want it that it has to come a certain way maybe it has to be a light in you nor this no I just Lord I know that you'll let me know that this is you leading me there will be always in the leadership piece accompanies the leadership of the Lord so here let's just look at an example here right here in the scripture that would be very fitting to our lives here you have a group of people in second chronicles chapter 20 here they are as a group of people Israel those in Judah they are assembled together and you have the different armies that are going they're actually coming against Jerusalem now you remember when you look at Israel Israel himself as far as with it being Judah there was that split in the kingdom remember Judah itself was always the more spiritual one one that was inclined with God they were their dwelling within Jerusalem wow that that which is of the Israel or the rest of it would be dwelling in Samaria now notice they had assembled themselves together I don't have time to read it all but Israel had assembled themselves together they did the absolutely right thing that they should have done the Bible says if you look at this when you get home they got their families together husbands wives children all the rest of them they got together and they begin to pray they begin to remind the Lord of the promise that he had made concerning of that through through him by the house of God the temple that if we be in trouble in any way things armies are come against us if we look unto the house Lord if we look Lord unto that then you will save us you will hear us now they were not in a condition where they were in sin but here the enemy had just tried to advance and encroach upon their lives they needed an answer from God and they've approached God by his word his promises so their prayers was according to the word and so now look what takes place in verse 14 the Bible says then upon jahaziel the son of Zechariah the son have been and I the son of jail the son of meth and I and Levite of the sons of Asaph came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all Judah he inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by the reason of the great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods this was not a new word but it was the same holy ghost that gave it through Moses the same Holy Ghost that called Joshua's attention to it what did he do the Spirit of God raises a standard against the enemy he brings it down and says this is for you be not afraid nor dismayed for the battle is not yours the lords they were praying they were ready for an answer and the Spirit of God came in the channel to minister to him a ministering spirit notice tomorrow go you down against them so you're going to go out against him you know they're coming now once the Spirit of God has moved down and here's what it says you go out against them tomorrow behold they're going to come up by the Clift of Zins god knows their battle plans this is the cliff they're gonna try to come around on hallelujah you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of juruá you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oma with you who is the salvation of the Lord with with you Oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites are the children of the co fights and of the children of a chloride stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high wait a minute tomorrow hadn't even come the victory hadn't even count Oh No but the word that they were under the word had anointed their eyes they already saw the victory so lately now they knew they were coming by this way they're coming by this way they bowed and worship Almighty God and then they stood up and they said thank you Lord and the devil tried to put something could try to fire but you don't know about this you don't know about that they were worshiping they already seen it conquer they already seen it defeated they saw the victory already what did that a ministering spirit what were they doing using gifts at their disposal Oh glory notice how Joshua fat makes this statement at verse 20 and verse 21 and they rose up early in the morning I don't know but I just got a feeling there was no snooze buttons pressed that day but Brian I got a feeling they was ready maybe they might have woke up a couple times then I said good Lord it's God it's got to be ready to go 1 o'clock in the morning lord help me get back to sleep and here they go man arrested Lord it's gotta be ready time for Sunday 3 o'clock in the morning what help me go back to sleep Lord don't come enough to preach it all in my dream you wake up here it's gotta be late at 4:30 in the morning but this is how it is with a promise of victory you're able to get up and face the day you put your foot on the ground here comes a conqueror here comes an overcomer here comes one that's ready to claim the victory it's already been given it gives you strength to give it to get up even when you're facing the trials and adversity is coming your way and it seems like things are spinning around you go ahead and you put your foot on the ground you see the kingdoms of this world they'd fallen heir to the kingdoms of our Christ and His anointed come on now we know it's coming into power we know we have a word of promise and not just for something that is in the future but we know we have a word of promise I would say Lord let the Spirit of God the ministering spirit let my eyes be so anointed to wear I'm able to look past my frailties my failures I'm able to go beyond the sound barrier where I see nothing but Jesus Christ standing as the mighty Conqueror they rose up early in the morning and they went forth into the wilderness of t-cog and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem I love this belief in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper and when he had consulted with the people remember this vision unfolds by their hand but it's got to have water to it I said it's got to have order to it when this vision unfolds notice we don't read this up above but when the vision unfolds and it is made personal now the people have taken received of the ministering Spirit the Spirit of God ministering the word they've taken it and rather William now begins to unfold of the plan for the battle when he had consulted with the people they already know you're not gonna have to fight it but now dude here comes that here comes a battle plan when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord Wow they're gonna fight a battle with singers and that should praise the beauty of his holiness and they went out before the army and to say pains the Lord for His mercy endureth forever they were anointed to see and this anointed singing it brought confusion among the camps one army slew the other arm in this one slew the other army the Israel didn't have to lift the battle Israel was able to sit right there on that of the high point and be able to look and see the enemy in that of a disarray the Bible goes on to tell us that when they finally had seized that Jehoshaphat they led the army of Israel and it took him three days to gather the spoils that was left of that battle glory be to God to sing praises to the beauty of his holiness aren't you glad that it is him in us that has given us a new song hey man he is singing the song of victory and he's using your voice he's using my voice he is standing in the midst of his brethren in the midst of the seven candlesticks it is him himself standing here singing a new song well if he is the limb the battles not mind the battle belongs to the Lord he is a mighty Conqueror I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me wind pangs of death seized on my soul unto the Lord I complain to no I cried and Jesus came and he made me whole I'm not have been feeling sick in my body worrying my spirit but he made me whole I get a reminder that's just sitting right down reminder I love you everyone so I just send me a little Instagram post I see myself in the word that picture is worth a thousand words me praise God Lord that God and one so I just get a little text from throne hey man it's encouragement ministering spirits that are sent forth from the presence of Almighty God I'm grateful to go for that whatever your need might be this morning the same ministering spirit that would come to minister and everything that the Lord would speak and express to us this morning is to let you and you and I know this is the position of our king he has over throne every principality and hold of the enemy and in your life by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost he identifies his reign in our lives we are now spiritual kings ruling and reigning with Christ and we shall reign with him in that millennium remember this morning we'll just stop here it's under your feet if you're in Christ every devil is under your feet I don't care if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet it's still under you you with this morning he conquered everyone and we have been placed in him by the Holy Ghost every devil is under our feet you don't mean we ain't gonna be face the face and be contested it'll be contested every inch of ground that you go to take it's going to be contested but just look at it this way this is an opportunity for victory this is an opportunity for Jesus Christ to be glorified don't look at how thick the walls are look at the captain of the host who's with you nothing is too hard for the Lord if you don't know the Lord this morning in that way as your Lord and Savior and as the king of your life I would invite you this morning to make your way through the bloody in the bloody footprints that you yourself can say Lord I'm tired of being me I want

of a gifted man that would be yielded in that way Lord he would be a ministering spirit that Lord God would come from the throne of God to minister to those who are heirs of salvation Lord right here this morning maybe there's the Lord God setting here in a hair of salvation it's our first time even hearing any of these things or what maybe the lord god it's someone lord that has said here for

have in their lives they realize that now I've been robbed but I'm gonna be robbed no more I'm gonna take my rights as a son of God as a daughter of God nor to walk in the bloody bloody footprints
