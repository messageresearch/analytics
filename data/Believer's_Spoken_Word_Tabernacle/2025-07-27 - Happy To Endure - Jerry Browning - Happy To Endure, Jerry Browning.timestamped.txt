[33:11] my savior,
[33:13] the one
[33:15] who will never
[33:18] fail.

[38:14] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[38:19] Let's just sing this little chorus as
[38:21] the jury comes. I will bless thee, oh
[38:23] Lord.
[38:27] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[38:34] You see,
[38:39] [Music]
[38:43] my hands lifted up
[38:48] and my mouth filled with praise
[38:53] with heart of thanksgiving.
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[39:03] [Music]
[39:04] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's
[39:08] good to be here with you this morning.
[39:11] Thankful to have my uh wife with me,
[39:14] Mina. And uh we've got four of the
[39:16] grandkids. There's Theodore and Jethro
[39:19] and Roselina. And Michael's over here.
[39:24] And then I brought my piano player with
[39:27] me today. And this is my daughter Lydia
[39:29] Rose. And so uh I want to I want to sing
[39:34] a song. I've I've uh we sing it at our
[39:36] church down there in Dixon. And and I've
[39:40] never actually sung it as a solo before.
[39:42] So you just bear with me. But the song
[39:48] has a lot of meaning to me.
[39:58] It was like yesterday.
[40:02] I was praying for a miracle.
[40:06] Scared to have a little hope.
[40:10] And now looking back,
[40:13] seeing all the things you've done,
[40:17] I can't even add them up. 1 2 3 up to
[40:25] infinity.
[40:28] I run out of numbers before I can thank
[40:32] you for everything.
[40:37] God, I'm still counting my blessings.
[40:41] All that you done in my life.
[40:46] The more that I look in the details,
[40:50] the more of your goodness I'll find.
[40:54] Father, on this side of heaven,
[40:59] I know that I'll run out of time,
[41:03] but I will keep counting my blessings,
[41:08] knowing I can't count that high.
[41:13] And I know that seasons
[41:17] never last forever.
[41:21] So God, I'll remember
[41:24] all of the reasons
[41:27] my heart has to be grateful.
[41:32] All of the times you've been faithful to
[41:36] me.
[41:38] God, I'm still counting my blessings.
[41:43] all that you done in my life.
[41:48] The more that I looked in the details,
[41:52] the more of your goodness I'll find.
[41:57] Father, on this side of heaven,
[42:01] I know that I'll run out of time,
[42:06] but I will keep counting my blessings.
[42:11] Oh, when I can't count that high.
[42:16] I can't count that high.
[42:22] [Laughter]
[42:25] No, I can't count that high.
[42:30] One, two, three, up to infinity.
[42:38] I run out of numbers
[42:41] before I could thank you for everything.
[42:47] But God, I'm still counting my
[42:49] blessings.
[42:51] All that you done in my life.
[42:55] The more that I look in the details,
[42:59] the more of your goodness I'll find.
[43:04] Father on this side of heaven.
[43:08] I know that I'll run out of time,
[43:13] but I will keep counting my blessings.
[43:18] Know when I can't count that high.
[43:23] Oh no, I can't count that high.
[43:27] [Music]
[43:34] Thank you.
[43:58] and uh I think I think you'll see that
[44:02] after the message today
[44:05] if you stand with me I I want to read my
[44:08] text from James chapter 5 7-11 I know
[44:12] that
[44:15] I know I gave
[44:19] I know that I gave my testimony. Excuse
[44:22] me. I'm still crying from the song. It's
[44:24] just it's just bubbling over, brothers.
[44:30] I know I already gave my testimony up
[44:32] here back in April of 2024 of how God
[44:35] had healed me from the mental illness,
[44:37] but uh you know, he healed me then, but
[44:39] you know, like many things, even you
[44:41] know, when you have surgery in the
[44:43] natural, there's a time of recovery.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; There's a time of being restored.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so now I I want to maybe go
[44:52] into it a little more than I did before,
[44:54] preach to you and go into that testimony
[44:57] because now I'm not just healed, I'm
[44:59] restored.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And uh I just I want to share this with
[45:07] you if I can just in some way be a help.
[45:10] Now I know that my testimony is about
[45:12] the mental illness that I suffered with,
[45:14] but this is the thing, friends, about
[45:16] faith. It doesn't matter here this
[45:18] morning. No matter what you got going on
[45:20] in your life, I don't care. It don't
[45:22] have to be mental illness. God is the
[45:25] Lord our God that healthth all of our
[45:27] diseases. But he not only health all of
[45:29] our diseases, he he is the Lord our God
[45:32] that provideth all of our needs. So
[45:35] whatever you got need of this morning,
[45:37] you reach out to him and God will meet
[45:40] that need. Amen. Now, if you read with
[45:43] me James 5, verse 7, I want to title
[45:48] this this morning because it's a
[45:50] personal testimony. Happy to endure.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Happy to endure.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto
[45:58] the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
[46:00] husbandman waiteth for the precious
[46:02] fruit of the earth, and hath long
[46:04] patience for it, until he received the
[46:07] early and latter rain. Be ye also
[46:10] patient. Establish your hearts, for the
[46:12] coming of the Lord drawth nigh. Grudge
[46:15] not one against another, brethren, lest
[46:17] ye be condemned. Behold, the judge
[46:19] standeth before the door. Take, my
[46:22] brethren, the prophets, who have spoken
[46:23] in the name of the Lord, for an example
[46:25] of suffering, affliction, and of
[46:28] patience. Behold, we count them happy
[46:31] which endure.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye have heard of the patience of
[46:35] Job and have seen the end of the Lord,
[46:39] that the Lord is very pitiful and of
[46:41] tender mercy. Amen. You may be seated.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[46:53] You know there we don't all
[46:57] it isn't all the same reason for each
[47:00] person one of us of why God has each one
[47:04] of us maybe the things that we go
[47:06] through
[47:07] &gt;&gt; uh meaning you know there there are
[47:11] intimate intricate details that God is
[47:15] dealing with with you personally. It's a
[47:18] personal walk between you and God.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; So, so God, friends, look, this isn't
[47:23] just a, you know, a thing we can just
[47:26] throw a whole blanket over it all and it
[47:28] fits everybody.
[47:30] But what does fit is that where God is
[47:33] bringing us from and where he's taking
[47:36] us to.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; We all know that what God is preparing
[47:40] us for. He's preparing each and every
[47:42] one of us. This is the preparation time.
[47:45] This is where God prepares us at here in
[47:48] this life in this walk on this earth
[47:51] during time and this season. And God
[47:54] chose for you and I to be in this
[47:58] season, this time. And not only that,
[48:01] but God God gets even more specific. God
[48:05] has you in a certain location, a certain
[48:08] region, a certain area, a certain
[48:10] country. You know, God, he he actually
[48:13] brought you here. Maybe you can, you
[48:15] know, you maybe you can you're bilingual
[48:18] or or something or can speak different
[48:20] languages. God had a purpose in all
[48:22] that. He wanted you to be who you are.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; But God is working out in our lives
[48:29] preparing us here for what is to come.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; This is not our life. And many times we
[48:36] get so absorbed
[48:38] into what's going on in this life and
[48:41] what and so what it does we we begin
[48:44] then Satan can really battle us there.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; But the things that God has us go
[48:52] through, it's all for for molding our
[48:55] character.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; We we know that there's a rapture
[48:59] coming. We know we're going in a
[49:01] rapture. We know there's a marriage
[49:02] supper of the lamb. We're looking
[49:04] forward to that. We're looking forward
[49:06] to a a span of about three and a half
[49:09] years of enjoying ourselves at the
[49:12] marriage supper of the lamb. We're
[49:14] actually looking forward to a period of
[49:15] about 40 days prior to that of the dead
[49:18] in Christ rising and us reuniting with
[49:21] our loved ones and and believers and
[49:24] friends that we've carried and walked
[49:27] here with in on this earth. And we're
[49:30] looking forward to that, you know. and
[49:32] and then oh but that's not the end of it
[49:35] yet. Then we know we got to come back
[49:38] down here in the after the the end of
[49:41] the marriage supper and we've got to
[49:43] rule and reign on this earth for a
[49:46] thousand years of time of a millennium.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; In order to rule in the millennium you
[49:56] got to know how to rule now. So God has
[49:59] us go through things. We have to endure
[50:02] them in order that God is molding us and
[50:05] preparing us for that time.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; But there are things that God has us go
[50:12] through and endure to help our fellow
[50:16] brothers and sisters as well. Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; There are things when you look in look
[50:21] at when Paul I mentioned Thursday night
[50:24] when God called Paul, he he's he spoke
[50:27] and he told said, "I'm going to show him
[50:30] what things he must suffer for my name's
[50:33] sake." You know, sometimes you read that
[50:36] and you think that that means that
[50:39] because you're being persecuted for
[50:41] believing in Jesus. It's not just that.
[50:43] For his name's sake, who is his name's
[50:46] sake? You are his people, his bride. You
[50:50] are his name's sake. So there are times
[50:53] that we have to suffer as believers, as
[50:57] individuals, endure and go through
[51:00] things for his name's sake,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; for one another. Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; If Paul had not suffered for his name's
[51:13] sake, then how could have Paul known how
[51:17] that Christ suffered? How could Paul
[51:19] have known how to so intricately write
[51:23] to the churches about faith?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And how could he write about Abraham?
[51:32] You know what Paul says about Abraham?
[51:34] Let's just read it. Hebrews chapter 6
[51:37] verse 10.
[51:41] For God is not unrighteous
[51:46] to forget your work and labor of love
[51:48] which you have showed toward his name in
[51:50] which he have ministered to the saints
[51:52] and to minister.
[51:54] And we desired that every one of you
[51:56] show the same diligence to the full
[51:58] assurance of hope and to the end.
[52:01] that you be not slothful,
[52:04] but followers of them who through faith
[52:07] and patience inherited the promise. For
[52:10] when God had made promise to Abraham,
[52:14] because he could swear by no greater, he
[52:16] swore by himself, saying, Surely
[52:18] blessing I will bless thee, multiplying
[52:20] I will multiply thee. And so after he
[52:24] had patiently endured, he obtained the
[52:27] promise.
[52:28] He did not obtain it before he endured.
[52:32] He had to endure. Do you know what?
[52:34] Listen, friends. Do you know what endure
[52:36] means? It means to hold fast.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; It means to not waver. It means to be
[52:43] able to persevere and you're going to
[52:46] make it through. Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Look,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; if if you weren't faced with adversity,
[52:56] if you weren't faced with with things
[52:58] that was telling you, actually screaming
[53:01] to your flesh to give up,
[53:05] &gt;&gt; then you wouldn't be enduring. You got
[53:07] to have that in order to endure. There's
[53:10] got to be something to endure.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; If there's nothing to endure, then
[53:15] you're not enduring.
[53:19] Hallelujah. You You There's got to be
[53:22] things you're going to face.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; We look, do we enjoy it? No. We're If we
[53:31] look at it through our flesh and how it
[53:33] makes our flesh feel, we're not enjoying
[53:35] it. But I'll tell you, friends, if God
[53:37] can open your eyes and you can see a
[53:39] bigger picture of what God's doing,
[53:41] you're going to be happy to endure it.
[53:44] When you get on the other side and you
[53:46] see the benefit not only to yourself but
[53:49] the benefit to others, you're going to
[53:50] be able to stand there and say, "I am
[53:53] happy to endure."
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I am happy I have endured. I am happy to
[53:59] continue to endure.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:08] Paul speaks about in Timothy, he said
[54:13] that he has suffered many persecutions
[54:15] and afflictions and and things and he
[54:18] said uh uh he said I endured
[54:22] and he says but out of them all the Lord
[54:25] delivered me.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord heals deliver us.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] David says in Psalms 103, "Bless the
[54:36] Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within
[54:38] me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord,
[54:41] oh my soul, forget not all his benefits.
[54:44] Who forgive who forgiveth all of thine
[54:46] iniquities." Can you say, "Praise the
[54:48] Lord."
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Who healthth all thy diseases, that's a
[54:56] lis.
[54:58] Friends, look, I I've listened to the
[55:00] messages and prayer lines and things. I
[55:03] have heard brother Brennham call people
[55:05] out of the audience and say, "You've got
[55:07] allergies you're suffering from. God
[55:09] heals you." We think about that and we
[55:12] think that's just a a little
[55:13] insignificant thing in comparison to
[55:15] cancer or something else. But God heals
[55:19] all of your diseases. He can heal the
[55:21] smallest one. He can heal the greatest
[55:24] one. There is no disease, no demon or
[55:27] devil can stand before God Almighty.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Praise your God.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; But not only stand before God, if you'll
[55:35] grab a hold by faith and claim that it's
[55:39] you, friends, listen, he's the God of
[55:42] your profession. What you profess, God
[55:46] backs it up. If you will profess his
[55:48] word, by his stripes, I am healed.
[55:55] And
[55:55] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something, friends. You
[55:56] don't got to wait to testify once you've
[55:59] got your healing. You don't got to wait
[56:01] to testify once you've got your
[56:03] deliverance. You don't have to wait to
[56:05] testify once the the issue, problem, or
[56:09] trial that's going on in your life has
[56:11] been resolved.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; You can testify right in the middle of
[56:17] it. Right.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this as he talks
[56:20] about David said, "Did you ever get
[56:22] anointed in the presence of of your
[56:25] enemy?" He's referring to David. And you
[56:28] know, we're all familiar with that that
[56:30] 23rd Psalm. You know, and David says,
[56:33] "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[56:36] want." Hallelujah. Why? Why shall David
[56:40] not want? Because he is Jehovah Rah,
[56:45] &gt;&gt; the Lord is shepherd. Hallelujah. He's
[56:48] David knows he I'm in God's hands.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Friends, David endured many things
[56:55] before he got down to write this in the
[56:59] book of Psalms.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; God built things up. Maybe that David
[57:07] maybe it started out with just the bear
[57:10] of the lion, but the next thing you know
[57:11] it was Goliath.
[57:13] [Music]
[57:14] And David just went back to his
[57:16] experience,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; the faith that he could draw from his
[57:21] experience with his walk with God.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And he could stand there and face
[57:27] something greater than a bear or a lion.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:33] Do you know that Goliath came down there
[57:35] and Goliath tormented them? He Goliath
[57:39] came down there and he he actually tried
[57:41] to antagonize them for 40 days. I
[57:44] believe it was
[57:46] &gt;&gt; every morning coming down there and just
[57:49] trying to taunt them.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; David comes down and he's wondering what
[57:57] are y'all afraid of?
[58:02] &gt;&gt; He wasn't He didn't have any armor. He
[58:04] wasn't trained like them.
[58:08] They were trained. They had armor. Even
[58:10] his brothers was there trained. Had
[58:12] shields and swords and helmets and all
[58:14] these things.
[58:17] And listen friends, for 40 days, brother
[58:20] David, they were standing out there be
[58:23] letting Goliath stand there and taunt
[58:26] them.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Why?
[58:29] because they didn't have faith
[58:33] &gt;&gt; in the God who had showed them time and
[58:36] time again that he always delivered
[58:40] them, that he always healed them, that
[58:42] he always provided for them.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, how dare I stand there like they
[58:49] were
[58:51] &gt;&gt; before before the demons and devils of
[58:54] the day. Let's don't be like them. Let's
[58:57] be like David. It ain't about me. It's
[59:00] not about how big I am. It ain't about
[59:02] how strong I am. It's not my about my
[59:05] abilities. It's about the God I serve.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; David wasn't talking about just when he
[59:16] mentioned the bear and the lion, David
[59:18] wasn't referring to his abilities.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; David said, "God delivered me out of the
[59:26] hand of the bear. He delivered me out of
[59:29] the balls of a lion.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "And that same God will deliver
[59:33] this uncircumcised Philistine into my
[59:36] hand."
[59:39] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what we got standing
[59:41] before us. That's that's how the devil
[59:42] is today,
[59:44] &gt;&gt; friends. He's a big bluff.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; But now you can't bluff him back.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You have got to have real true faith.
[59:55] Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Remember them people that in the in the
[59:58] old New Testament went down there and
[1:00:01] they were saying they were coming in the
[1:00:02] name of Jesus. They were calling coming
[1:00:04] in the name of Paul trying to cast out
[1:00:06] them demons.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; The devil said Jesus we know.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Paul we know but who are you?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But David come out there
[1:00:20] before Goliath. He said, "Who are you to
[1:00:23] stand here and defy the armies of the
[1:00:26] living God?"
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; David knew God and he knew faith in God
[1:00:33] and he knew what God was capable of.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; David didn't know how. He didn't have to
[1:00:39] know how. David didn't try to figure it
[1:00:40] out. He didn't say, "Hold on a minute. I
[1:00:42] got to sit down and do some trigonometry
[1:00:44] to figure out how in the world this rock
[1:00:47] is going to kill that guy.
[1:00:50] Hallelujah.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Let me scientifically study this
[1:00:55] through.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to get a doctor out here
[1:01:00] and consult him and know just where to
[1:01:01] hit him at.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; His faith was in
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; the great physician.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; You know, we look at the great physician
[1:01:09] and we think, well, because he's a Lord
[1:01:11] our God that heals all of our diseases.
[1:01:13] But here was a disease standing before
[1:01:15] Israel that day.
[1:01:19] A disease that took the form, it was a
[1:01:22] spiritual disease.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; That took the form of a giant
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; David said, "Look, he's the great
[1:01:34] physician. He knows exactly where that
[1:01:36] rock's got to hit him."
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; How How is David going to get that much
[1:01:44] force behind? I'll tell you what, let me
[1:01:46] just drop a little thing to you. give
[1:01:48] you a lure of money if you don't
[1:01:49] remember it. My daddy was preaching on
[1:01:51] this years and years ago and he said, "I
[1:01:52] don't," he says, "I believe that that
[1:01:54] rock was ordained so much so to kill
[1:01:57] that giant that if David would have
[1:01:59] slung it the other way, it had just
[1:02:01] circled the globe and came back around
[1:02:03] and killed him."
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; It wasn't about David's ability or
[1:02:10] David's aim. It was about what he
[1:02:12] believed in God. It was about God's
[1:02:15] ability.
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:21] Hallelujah.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; David said, "Yeah, he resto my soul.
[1:02:27] Yay, though I walk through the valley of
[1:02:29] the shadow, death, thou fill no evil,
[1:02:31] for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[1:02:33] staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a
[1:02:35] table before me. In the presence of my
[1:02:37] enemies, thou anointest my head with
[1:02:41] oil, and my cup runth over."
[1:02:44] Brother said, "You ever get anointed in
[1:02:46] the presence of your enemy?" You know
[1:02:47] who our enemy is today? The devil.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Spirit come and you. I
[1:02:55] don't care what your sickness is. I
[1:02:57] don't care what your problem is. I don't
[1:02:59] care if it's family drama. I don't care
[1:03:01] what it is. I don't care if it's a devil
[1:03:03] trying to bring you doubt that your
[1:03:05] family won't be safe. I'm telling you
[1:03:07] today, you stand there and say, "God,
[1:03:11] it's in your hands.
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:16] Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Get anointed in the presence of Look,
[1:03:19] you don't get, like I was saying, you
[1:03:21] don't got to wait
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; to testify
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; after the fact.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Abraham testified
[1:03:30] before he ever had the son.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham and Sarah were testifying
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; as they were still growing older and
[1:03:39] older and older in their bodies.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; God will bring Listen friends, you
[1:03:50] testify of God's fa word. You testify of
[1:03:53] your faith and God will bring it all
[1:03:55] around to be subject to that.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Look, look at that. We're familiar with
[1:04:00] the story. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:04:02] John Ryan
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; being blind.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Friends, he didn't wait till he could
[1:04:07] see to say, "I can see."
[1:04:10] He by faith believed that the prophet of
[1:04:13] God had prayed for him. You know, now
[1:04:15] here's the whole story of John Ryan.
[1:04:16] John Ryan, you know, he was kind of
[1:04:18] raised Catholic, brother Bram said. He
[1:04:20] said, so he said, I prayed for him. Said
[1:04:22] he went around, went off platform, and
[1:04:23] he just got back in and came on back up.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come back around." He said, "I
[1:04:27] already prayed for you." He said, "I
[1:04:29] realized that that he was Catholic. He
[1:04:31] needed something to hold on to."
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; And so he told him, he says, "Look,
[1:04:37] you'll go off of here." He says, "And
[1:04:39] you just keep claiming, by his stripes,
[1:04:41] I'm healed."
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; So John Ryan left off of there, friends,
[1:04:46] and and every day he kept proclaiming,
[1:04:48] "By his stripes, I'm healed."
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He he passed out newspapers on the
[1:04:53] corner. Y'all know the story. He passed
[1:04:55] out newspapers on the corner. You know,
[1:04:57] this back in the day, a whole lot
[1:04:58] different than internet stuff. And he's
[1:05:00] on the corner with these newspapers,
[1:05:02] "Extra, x-ray. Read all about it. By his
[1:05:06] stripes, I'm healed. I'll tell you what,
[1:05:09] friends, his testimony and profession,
[1:05:11] it went around that town so much that
[1:05:13] there was people that was making fun of
[1:05:15] him over it because they knew he
[1:05:17] couldn't see.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Remember the story? He goes into the
[1:05:22] barber shop. He's in there and and the
[1:05:24] barber, you know, is going to try to
[1:05:26] torment him.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Just send your best out against me. Like
[1:05:32] Goliath said,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; he's going to torment me. says, "Hey,
[1:05:38] John, can you see?" He knew good and
[1:05:41] well. John couldn't see. But but John
[1:05:44] knew he could see.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; He knew by faith.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And John said, "Yes, I can see. By his
[1:05:51] stripes, I'm healed." He had that that
[1:05:53] barber's apron on and everything. You
[1:05:55] know, at that time, hallelujah, his God
[1:06:00] come down and make good on his
[1:06:02] profession
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; of faith.
[1:06:05] And when he did, his eyes opened. Up out
[1:06:09] of that barber chair, he ran down the
[1:06:11] street he went. Barber apron, just the
[1:06:14] flapping, the barber running after him.
[1:06:16] Hallelujah. He was praising God,
[1:06:19] shouting the victory. I'll tell you
[1:06:21] this, John Ryan at that time, if you'd
[1:06:24] asked him, he would have told you, "I'm
[1:06:26] happy to have endured
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; because his faith, his testimony still
[1:06:33] touches you today."
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; After you endure.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] Paul says in Hebrews, hold fast to your
[1:06:52] profession.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Hold fast. That's what endure means. To
[1:07:00] hold fast. Take a hold of it. Hold on to
[1:07:03] it.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Don't let it go. Hold fast to your
[1:07:08] profession.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hold fast to your profession.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] Let let me read this quote. I don't know
[1:07:20] did if y'all got all those from the
[1:07:22] resurrection of Lazarus. And brother
[1:07:23] Random starts this out. He's talking
[1:07:25] about Mary. All right. It's talking
[1:07:27] about Mary. Notice she took him at his
[1:07:30] word. God said she's going to have a
[1:07:32] baby. Told it by an angel. That was good
[1:07:34] enough for her. Anyway, way she went
[1:07:37] testifying, telling people she was going
[1:07:39] to have a baby before there was any sign
[1:07:42] of anything. She had the word of God.
[1:07:44] That's good enough. That's good enough
[1:07:47] for me this afternoon. If he's Jehovah
[1:07:50] Raphael, the the healer, if he promised
[1:07:52] to heal me, I'll take him at his word.
[1:07:54] If he promised me the Holy Ghost was to
[1:07:58] me, I'll stay there till it comes.
[1:08:00] That's all. That's right. He promised
[1:08:02] it. Stay with it. I'll just take him at
[1:08:04] his word. I'll stay right there. That's
[1:08:06] the only way to do it.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just start
[1:08:15] testifying, friends.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bring it all around
[1:08:19] to meet your testimony.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's faith. Look, it's faith
[1:08:24] in his word. If he said it, this is what
[1:08:27] brother said. If he said it, I believe
[1:08:28] it. And that settles it.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That settles
[1:08:32] it. You've got to to in order for it to
[1:08:35] be settled with you, you've got to be
[1:08:39] willing to endure because Satan is going
[1:08:42] to be there to try to talk you out of it
[1:08:44] every day.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; You're going to have some of Job's
[1:08:50] comforters.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; There'll be points say, "Hey, maybe
[1:08:57] there's something wrong in your life.
[1:08:58] You got some secret sin somewhere. Job
[1:09:01] knew he didn't. You have heard of the
[1:09:03] patience of Job. James said,
[1:09:07] "Count them happy which endure."
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] After Abraham had patiently, Hallelujah.
[1:09:17] Endured.
[1:09:18] Amen. All right. I think I got this down
[1:09:21] here. He swore by himself as the message
[1:09:22] says. So after he had patiently endured,
[1:09:24] he obtained the promise. Can you do the
[1:09:26] same thing this morning? Can you set
[1:09:28] your faith and say, "It's thus sayeth
[1:09:31] the Lord." And no matter what comes or
[1:09:33] what goes, whether today is easy or
[1:09:36] tomorrow's hard, can we do that? Can we
[1:09:39] set our faith and say, "Look, I'm not
[1:09:42] going to look at the circumstances. I'm
[1:09:44] not going to look how long this is going
[1:09:46] on."
[1:09:49] Hallelujah. Friends, do you realize that
[1:09:53] it takes more faith for divine healing
[1:09:55] than it does for a miracle? You know
[1:09:57] why? Because faith for divine healing is
[1:10:00] enduring faith.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; There's many people who had come through
[1:10:06] to prayer lines actually had miracles
[1:10:10] performed on their lives
[1:10:13] that walked away and never followed the
[1:10:15] truth.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Remember what Jesus said? He said he he
[1:10:23] he says this verses. He says what he was
[1:10:26] concerned with was when he would return
[1:10:28] to earth would he find faith.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And then he said this, he who endures
[1:10:36] not just for a little while, not just
[1:10:38] one trial, not just one year, not just a
[1:10:42] few years, but he that endures to the
[1:10:45] end,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; the same shall be saved. Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, you can't quit a race
[1:10:51] in the middle and think you're going to
[1:10:53] win.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Now, look, we're we're not in we're
[1:11:00] we're we're all in this race, but we're
[1:11:02] not actually in this race competing
[1:11:03] against one another
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; to see who gets there first.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Because we've got some that's already
[1:11:10] made it.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You know, let me give you this little
[1:11:13] testimony just popped in here. When I
[1:11:15] was going through basic training, at the
[1:11:16] end of the basic training, we had this
[1:11:19] uh uh it was a some kind of a test we
[1:11:22] had to go through and they called it
[1:11:24] Paragon Trail is what they called it. It
[1:11:26] was over in Fort Dicks, New Jersey. And
[1:11:28] what they did was they took us out by
[1:11:30] squads and just dumped us out there in
[1:11:32] the middle of nowhere over there in New
[1:11:35] Jersey. And so we're out in the woods,
[1:11:37] you know, and you're by squads, right?
[1:11:39] So you know what a squad is? just a a
[1:11:41] small group of soldiers with one guy
[1:11:44] that's leading those group of soldiers,
[1:11:46] right? And so, you know, four squads
[1:11:49] make a a platoon and four platoon make a
[1:11:51] company and so many companies make a,
[1:11:54] you know, a battalion and so many
[1:11:58] battalions make a brigade and so on and
[1:12:00] so forth. But here, break it all the way
[1:12:02] down. This is just one step above the
[1:12:04] individual,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; a squad,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; right? It's actually what they used more
[1:12:09] to fight with in in in Vietnam was by
[1:12:12] squads. Anyway, so they dropped us out
[1:12:15] there with squads. And so we're out
[1:12:16] there and so all these different squads
[1:12:18] are out, brother Roco. And they dropped
[1:12:21] us off in different areas and we and we
[1:12:23] got a map
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; and it's dark
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; and we got a map. And I'm not talking
[1:12:29] about a road map because there ain't no
[1:12:30] roads.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a top a topographical
[1:12:34] map. So you got to look at terrain. You
[1:12:36] got to know how to read a compass. You
[1:12:38] gota You got to know how to shoot a
[1:12:40] asthmas. You got to know what you're
[1:12:41] doing or you you will never get out of
[1:12:43] there. And we all had to make it to the
[1:12:45] same place.
[1:12:48] All the squads had to make it to the
[1:12:50] same place. They might have started out
[1:12:52] at a different point, a different
[1:12:53] region,
[1:12:55] but they all had one place, one goal,
[1:12:58] one end of the line.
[1:13:03] Now, there was some of us, our squads
[1:13:06] made it through. And you know, when we
[1:13:07] got there, at the very end of it, that's
[1:13:09] when it got worse because then we had
[1:13:11] this like it was set up like a
[1:13:13] battlefield and we had to load crawl
[1:13:15] across this thing with live rounds being
[1:13:17] fired over the top of us and they were
[1:13:19] throwing gas out at us and things. So,
[1:13:22] you had to get your gas me back on and
[1:13:23] and you're crawling and dragged. You
[1:13:25] can't leave none of your gear behind.
[1:13:26] You leave your gear behind, you're going
[1:13:27] back after it.
[1:13:31] And you can't leave you can't leave your
[1:13:33] buddy behind either.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, we go through all this
[1:13:39] and and but let me get to my point. So,
[1:13:42] you know, there was those of us that we
[1:13:44] made it through and there was still yet
[1:13:46] more to come. And so, they put us up.
[1:13:48] They had these bleachers, brother Roco.
[1:13:50] And so, we're up in these bleachers. And
[1:13:52] at this bleachers, we could look back
[1:13:54] over the banister of time down on the
[1:13:57] battlefield.
[1:13:58] And we could see the other squads of
[1:14:01] soldiers making their way across that
[1:14:04] battlefield toward us and we could
[1:14:06] witness it. We couldn't do anything for
[1:14:08] them. But you know what we started
[1:14:10] singing? We started singing
[1:14:12] encouragement to those on the
[1:14:14] battlefield that they could make it too.
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; That is so good. us up in them bleachers
[1:14:25] in the natural was a testimony to them.
[1:14:28] They made it through. Friends, we know
[1:14:30] we got loved ones. We got believers even
[1:14:32] out of this assembly we know made it
[1:14:35] through and they're on the other side.
[1:14:37] But you know what? They left behind
[1:14:39] their testimony that says you can do it.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] No matter how bad it gets to looking,
[1:14:54] don't quit.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; No matter how bad you feel, don't quit.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; In the army, we had people that would go
[1:15:03] on a 10mi run every Friday in Germany.
[1:15:07] And it wasn't flat land either. And we
[1:15:09] go on a 10-mi run. Our our our platoon
[1:15:12] sergeant, he called it touring the town.
[1:15:15] Went on a 10 mile run every Friday
[1:15:17] morning,
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; you know. And there was people the first
[1:15:20] little twinge in their legs or
[1:15:23] something, y'all. I think some of them
[1:15:24] never felt nothing. They just didn't
[1:15:25] have the desire to do it.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And they would begin to fall out. Soon
[1:15:31] as they found a place they thought they
[1:15:32] could be inconspicuous about falling out
[1:15:35] and walking back, they did. But others,
[1:15:38] you know, they go on maybe a little bit
[1:15:39] longer. They feel the pain and then
[1:15:40] they'd be over the side limping and and
[1:15:42] they'd be over there, you know, and then
[1:15:44] they'd say, "I just quit." And they go
[1:15:45] back. I'll tell you something, friends.
[1:15:48] If you know anything about running,
[1:15:49] you're gonna feel some burn.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; You're gonna feel a little bit of pain.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You know, the army, of course, they
[1:15:56] mentally condition us. No pain, no gain.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I can feel it in my legs. I can feel it
[1:16:02] in my arms. I can feel it in my my
[1:16:05] hands. But I'm keep going on.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I'll tell you what.
[1:16:09] It's great to get anointed in the
[1:16:10] presence of the enemy and feel that in
[1:16:12] your legs. Feel that in your arms. Feel
[1:16:15] that in your soul. Hallelujah.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Don't drop out. I don't care how painful
[1:16:22] it gets. I don't care how impossible it
[1:16:24] seems. I don't care. You say people tell
[1:16:26] me, "Well, I've been hearing ever since
[1:16:28] I was a kid that we're at the end time
[1:16:30] and the Lord is coming.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; It ain't never happened."
[1:16:36] Well, the Bible talks about that, too.
[1:16:38] Said people would get to where they'd
[1:16:40] say, "The Lord delayeth his coming,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; so let's just fall out. Let's just go
[1:16:45] live however we want.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible talks about.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, this ain't time to
[1:16:52] quit. That's right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Our trials of health and our trials of
[1:16:59] of of you you know uh finances or our
[1:17:02] trials in life.
[1:17:05] Friends, when you look at them in
[1:17:08] retrospect of the whole picture, you
[1:17:11] will find out they're really not that
[1:17:14] big.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Here some time ago, brother Tommy, where
[1:17:20] you at? There some time ago, you know, I
[1:17:23] preached and I bringing out about the
[1:17:24] the Holocaust and about what they did to
[1:17:27] the Jews and and all that. I preached at
[1:17:29] my church, you know, right? And I said,
[1:17:30] "Listen, next time you feel like
[1:17:32] complaining over something's going on in
[1:17:34] your life, think about them."
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I went through the whole thing in
[1:17:39] history. I laid it out. I had pictures
[1:17:41] of everything.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Somebody always has it
[1:17:48] worse than you.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Look, friends. Yeah, I'm not against us
[1:17:52] get down and crying out to God for
[1:17:53] oursel, but sometimes we get so
[1:17:55] self-centered,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; so self-involved,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; don't get so focused on yourself.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You got other brothers and sisters.
[1:18:06] We're all in the same race. Pray for one
[1:18:09] another. That's right.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Be there for one another. Be
[1:18:11] encouraging.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; You know how you can be encouraging?
[1:18:15] Don't wait till you get healed. Don't
[1:18:17] wait till you get delivered. They see
[1:18:20] you going through the things.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; I know many times we go through things
[1:18:24] and we keep it hidden. Maybe a lot of
[1:18:26] people around they don't know everything
[1:18:28] they're going through. Get up and
[1:18:29] testify about it.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You can get up and say, "I'm going
[1:18:35] through hell right now.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; But I know I know my redeemer liveth. I
[1:18:45] know he's going to deliver me. I know
[1:18:48] that in the last day I shall see God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I know I'm going to make it through.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Don't let God torment you about your
[1:19:01] children and your loved ones. Look, I'm
[1:19:03] not going to give you a bunch of false
[1:19:04] hope and I'm not going to get into this
[1:19:06] because, you know, gets into doctrine
[1:19:07] and teaching everything. But here's what
[1:19:08] I want to tell you. Just put it in God's
[1:19:11] hands.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:19:14] put it in God's hands cuz Satan just
[1:19:16] wants to torment you about it.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing you can do about it.
[1:19:23] You did. You can't die for them. You
[1:19:25] can't save them. Only one can do that.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And you can't accept it for them. They
[1:19:31] got to do that for themselves. It's on a
[1:19:34] free moral agency. It's free will.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; So all you can do pray for them and
[1:19:41] commit it to God.
[1:19:44] I know God's able.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan torment you with how bad
[1:19:48] it looks like, how far it looks like
[1:19:50] they're going. Don't let Satan torment
[1:19:52] you about that. You just stand there and
[1:19:54] hold the standard.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Standard of faith is in God's hands.
[1:20:03] Listen friends, the scripture says it'll
[1:20:06] be so close in at at the end that it
[1:20:08] would deceive the very elect if
[1:20:10] possible.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; All right. So here, you know, many times
[1:20:14] we focus on it's going to be so close
[1:20:16] and we start focusing, you know, brother
[1:20:18] rock on what's exactly does that mean?
[1:20:20] How close is it? Let's focus on this.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; It can't deceive the elect.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot stop God from saving one of
[1:20:29] his kids.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; It cannot deceive the elect. Jesus said,
[1:20:34] "All that the father has given me, I
[1:20:36] have them, and I'm not losing one."
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Satan ain't got no power.
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:44] Listen friends, as long as the devil can
[1:20:46] remain hidden. Remember what I told you
[1:20:48] about? Maybe you like, "Well, nobody
[1:20:49] knows what I'm going through." Don't let
[1:20:51] that devil remain hidden.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; As long as he he don't want you to
[1:20:55] testify about it. He don't want you to
[1:20:56] tell I'm not talking about going and
[1:20:58] belly aching,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; singing your woes. As brother Juel for
[1:21:03] says, "Wowsy, wowy woo. Woe is me." I'm
[1:21:07] not talking about that.
[1:21:12] But you can tell people, hey, look, I am
[1:21:14] really going through it. And it is very
[1:21:15] discouraging right now. If you want to
[1:21:17] get into a little bit of the details, if
[1:21:19] they got time, you know, just take this
[1:21:21] in a nut. Sometimes people ask you how
[1:21:23] you doing, they don't really want to
[1:21:24] know.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to know how somebody's
[1:21:28] doing, don't ask them.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; If you ain't going to hang around to
[1:21:33] hear the rest of the story, then don't
[1:21:36] ask them to start it out.
[1:21:43] Because look, the devil's already got
[1:21:45] them feeling like nobody cares about
[1:21:46] them. He's already got them feeling like
[1:21:48] they're all alone.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; I never do this.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to have to
[1:21:57] Excuse me. I don't believe that
[1:21:58] doctrine. Sorry.
[1:22:04] I don't think my dad ever wore long
[1:22:06] sleeve shirts.
[1:22:09] Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] Testify.
[1:22:14] Hallelujah. Testify.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Believe it. Stand there in faith and
[1:22:19] testify.
[1:22:22] Hallelujah.
[1:22:26] Somebody ask you, do you want to share
[1:22:28] whatever? Testify. You know why? Because
[1:22:31] the devil you you're just throwing in
[1:22:33] his face. He wants you to feel like
[1:22:35] you're all alone. He wants to get you
[1:22:36] out there and feel all alone.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul says this in
[1:22:44] Philippians 4 and 6. Be careful for
[1:22:48] nothing.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Be careful for nothing. You know what
[1:22:51] that means? It means don't worry.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Here, let me just let's read this.
[1:22:59] Philippians 4:es 6 and 7. You might like
[1:23:02] this, you might not. I hope you don't
[1:23:04] get offended. Be careful for nothing.
[1:23:07] But in everything be pray be in prayer
[1:23:10] and supplication with thanksgiving,
[1:23:11] letting your requests be known before
[1:23:13] unto God. Now, first of all, difference
[1:23:15] between prayer and supplication. Prayer
[1:23:17] that's that's your ongoing Christian
[1:23:19] walk with God. You're you're
[1:23:21] communicating with him. Your
[1:23:22] supplications are your requests, the
[1:23:24] things you need. Hallelujah. And the
[1:23:27] peace of God which passes all
[1:23:29] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:23:31] minds through Christ Jesus. What is Paul
[1:23:35] saying here?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Be careful for nothing. Don't worry.
[1:23:41] What's he saying here? And the peace of
[1:23:43] God which passes all understanding will
[1:23:44] keep your hearts and mind through Jesus
[1:23:46] Christ. Be happy.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Be happy.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; I think you can remember that.
[1:23:56] Hallelujah.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Quit worrying. That's what the devil
[1:24:01] wants you to because friends, if you're
[1:24:02] worried, it brings fear and fear tears
[1:24:05] down anything that faith could be rested
[1:24:08] upon.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; You cannot be afraid and have faith at
[1:24:13] the same time.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:24:17] let's just give you example. I'm sure
[1:24:19] you can relate to. So, uh, you know,
[1:24:21] let's say that, uh, some kind of
[1:24:23] unknowing bump. All of a sudden, you
[1:24:25] don't know it, but you feel all of a
[1:24:26] sudden you feel this unknowing bump. I
[1:24:28] didn't have that there before. The
[1:24:29] world's go rolling around and what in
[1:24:32] the world is that?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Devil goes, it's cancer. It's a tumor.
[1:24:36] You're going to die.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; And if we ain't careful, we'll start
[1:24:43] running down that. We We'll actually
[1:24:45] look it up. We'll Google it. or a great
[1:24:48] or if you're an apple, jump on Safari or
[1:24:51] whatever and we'll we'll search that
[1:24:52] thing out and we'll diagnose ourselves.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil wants you to do.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:05] There's times when it needs to be
[1:25:08] diagnosed
[1:25:10] so it can be took care of and treated
[1:25:12] right. There's other things that come
[1:25:13] that God says, I I'm not even going to
[1:25:16] take time for a diagnosis here. I'm just
[1:25:17] going to heal you,
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; but that's in his hands.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; A peace that surpasses all
[1:25:25] understanding. That doesn't mean that
[1:25:28] that it's something that is that is uh
[1:25:31] uh
[1:25:33] that that is beyond uh all uh let me see
[1:25:36] how am I saying this? It's it's not this
[1:25:40] peace that passes understanding. It It's
[1:25:42] not something that I'm saying that well
[1:25:45] you can't talk about this where I'm
[1:25:47] saying look friends you try to share
[1:25:49] this piece you can't really share it
[1:25:51] through words.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You can't get somebody there through
[1:25:54] taking them through a story. You can
[1:25:57] giving them a testimony you can lead
[1:25:59] them to the one that can give them the
[1:26:01] peace.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; It's a piece that doesn't make
[1:26:05] reasonable human sense.
[1:26:08] It defies human logic.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Satan don't want you to have peace. He
[1:26:15] wants to keep you tore up about
[1:26:17] everything, anything that he can get to
[1:26:20] get you tore up in your mind.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; And and and if he can get us
[1:26:25] self-centered and self-focused, he can
[1:26:28] keep us tore up in our mind over
[1:26:30] something that's going on.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; But if we can take and say, "Look, my
[1:26:35] life is in God's hand. He's in control.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Wherever he sends me, I'll go. Whatever
[1:26:43] he tells me to do, I'll do. Whatever I
[1:26:45] got to go through, I'm willing to
[1:26:47] endure.
[1:26:59] Spurgeon, Charles Spurgeon, he says
[1:27:01] this.
[1:27:03] He says, "What is God's peace? The
[1:27:06] unruffled sincerity of the infinite ha
[1:27:10] in infinitely happy God. Let me read it
[1:27:14] again. I stumbled on it. What is God's
[1:27:17] peace? The unruffled serenity
[1:27:22] of the infinitely happy God.
[1:27:26] The eternal composure of absolutely
[1:27:30] wellcontented God.
[1:27:36] surpasses all understanding. It isn't
[1:27:38] that it's senseless necessarily, you
[1:27:41] know. It's that it must be experienced.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's what I was trying to say. But you
[1:27:48] can't just tell them through words
[1:27:51] to to know what I'm talking about about
[1:27:53] this peace that surpasses all
[1:27:54] understanding. You got to experience it.
[1:27:57] Now, let me tell you something. Here's
[1:27:58] the key, brother David. There's only one
[1:28:00] way to to that you're going to
[1:28:02] experience this peace. You got to first
[1:28:04] have no peace.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; You got to first have something going on
[1:28:10] in your life adversity that's got it
[1:28:12] turned up on its head and upside down
[1:28:14] and has wrecked your peace.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Or at least the peace you thought you
[1:28:18] had. Cuz see, our definition of peace is
[1:28:21] everything being hunky dory,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; slowly smoothing, nothing going wrong,
[1:28:26] no adversity. That that's our definition
[1:28:28] of peace. That is not the definition of
[1:28:31] this peace. This peace that passes all
[1:28:35] understanding. You can have peace in the
[1:28:38] midst of of of the hardest trial in your
[1:28:41] life.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; You can have peace in the midst of the
[1:28:45] worst disease to strike you.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let me just take a few
[1:28:59] moments on this.
[1:29:01] Let me say this first. The things I'm
[1:29:04] going to describe to you from my
[1:29:05] testimony. All right. Look, I'm not just
[1:29:07] trying to point it. Look, I know that
[1:29:09] people are affected mentally by many
[1:29:11] different ways.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; So, we're really all familiar with like
[1:29:15] uh things that that are outside
[1:29:17] stressors, we'll call them, that affect
[1:29:20] people's minds and torment them. some of
[1:29:22] the things I mentioned about, you know,
[1:29:24] being worried about your your children,
[1:29:26] your lost loved ones and things. Uh, you
[1:29:28] know, a financial issue in your life or
[1:29:31] or or or somebody that's just putting
[1:29:33] pressure on you from something at the
[1:29:35] job or or, you know, loss of your home,
[1:29:37] your job or anything like that. You
[1:29:39] know, those are outside stressors and
[1:29:41] they can cause you mental anguish. They
[1:29:44] can actually cause you anxiety. They
[1:29:46] they can cause you to feel depressed.
[1:29:49] They can cause you to to just I mean
[1:29:51] just
[1:29:52] begin to plummet.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; But think about this. Think about if you
[1:29:58] had anxiety and you were depressed and
[1:30:00] everything around you was wonderful.
[1:30:04] Think about if you were standing there
[1:30:05] and you say, you know, everybody's
[1:30:07] telling you, don't think that way. Well,
[1:30:09] what's going on? Well, just be happy
[1:30:11] about that. If you actually have a
[1:30:14] mental illness, it's actually a disease.
[1:30:18] It is that you're Let me explain it this
[1:30:20] way. How many knows anything about sugar
[1:30:22] diabetes?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody know anything about sugar
[1:30:24] diabetes? All right, listen. And if you
[1:30:27] don't, get with Sister Naomi, she'll
[1:30:28] tell you. Sister Linda, she's over here.
[1:30:30] Get with any of these nurses. They'll
[1:30:33] break it down for you. All right. Now, I
[1:30:35] I'll do my best, sisters. All right.
[1:30:38] Now, your pancreas has to create insulin
[1:30:41] for your body because you got to have
[1:30:43] sugar in your blood. And and there's and
[1:30:45] you know, people think sugars are
[1:30:47] thinking they think white granulated
[1:30:49] sugar and all this stuff. Now your body
[1:30:51] everything actually you eat. This was
[1:30:54] discouraging for me when I was first
[1:30:56] diagnosed.
[1:30:57] Everything you eat your body converts it
[1:31:00] into sugar.
[1:31:02] Not just the Danish brother David.
[1:31:07] If you eat a steak your body is going to
[1:31:09] convert that into sugar. Now not the
[1:31:11] same way and not as much.
[1:31:15] So, I'm not giving you a license to eat
[1:31:16] a Danish
[1:31:18] if you got this.
[1:31:21] All right? But what happens is your body
[1:31:24] stops functioning right. Your pancreas
[1:31:27] either doesn't want it's not producing
[1:31:30] the insulin you need in order to keep
[1:31:32] the you see, you got to have sugar. If
[1:31:34] you don't have sugar in your blood, then
[1:31:36] what happens? Anybody ever suffered from
[1:31:38] uh from their sugar bottoming out? Low
[1:31:40] low blood sugar. You know, you your
[1:31:41] sugar bottoms out and drops. What
[1:31:43] happens? you start to feel lightaded,
[1:31:45] you you'll feel you start to feel
[1:31:46] nervous and shaky and and you'll get
[1:31:49] these feel like jitters in your stomach,
[1:31:51] you know, and and you kind of feel a
[1:31:52] little bit sick and and if it gets too
[1:31:54] much low or whatever, you going to lose
[1:31:56] consciousness. You know why? The brain
[1:31:58] is being starved of sugar.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; So, you got to have it. But you can't
[1:32:05] have too much because if you got too
[1:32:08] much, then it starts to bring break down
[1:32:11] the blood vessels. It starts to break
[1:32:13] down the organs in your body. They can't
[1:32:15] handle it.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It's in your blood flows throughout your
[1:32:19] whole body.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So the insulin that's produced by your
[1:32:23] pancreas, it it it interacts with that
[1:32:26] in your blood and it keeps that sugar
[1:32:28] level at where it's supposed to be to
[1:32:31] actually for your body to function. What
[1:32:33] a wonderful God we serve.
[1:32:37] But if your pancreas isn't producing the
[1:32:39] right amount of insulin or you have
[1:32:42] things that make you insulin resistant.
[1:32:47] Now, I know a lot of people think you're
[1:32:50] diabetic must mean you're fat. Skinny
[1:32:52] people can have it, too.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; It ain't about that. Only thing being
[1:32:56] fat does is make you more insulin
[1:32:58] resistant.
[1:33:02] And in fact, a lot of other things, too.
[1:33:06] But anyway, look, and there's two types
[1:33:10] of diabetes, right, sisters? Two types.
[1:33:13] Is it type one and type two? Is that
[1:33:14] what they call it? Yeah. Two types. Type
[1:33:16] one, type two. So, type one, see if I
[1:33:18] get this right. Type one is you're
[1:33:21] having low blood sugars. You know, is
[1:33:24] that what it is? You know, people,
[1:33:25] they're they're I what I mean is it's
[1:33:28] the way it's processed. That individual
[1:33:30] has to have things because it reacts
[1:33:33] different with them. They're not going
[1:33:34] around ready ready for their their head
[1:33:36] to blow off over having their sugars too
[1:33:38] high. It just works different. Let me go
[1:33:40] on.
[1:33:42] It doesn't really matter. What I really
[1:33:44] want to get across the point is it's
[1:33:46] something not working right in your
[1:33:48] body. Same thing with somebody that has
[1:33:50] heart disease.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Now, these things, there can be things
[1:33:54] in your family that will make you
[1:33:56] predisposed to some of these things. You
[1:33:59] know, it ain't like you can really
[1:34:00] inherit like heart disease, but you can
[1:34:04] be you can inherit certain genetics and
[1:34:06] genes that will predispose you to it.
[1:34:10] Diabetes that if you got it on both
[1:34:13] sides of the family, you're in trouble.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; You better stop eating the donuts today.
[1:34:20] I don't care how young you are. I don't
[1:34:22] care if they check your blood sugar and
[1:34:23] say you're good. Start taking care of
[1:34:25] yourself cuz you're predisposed. Maybe
[1:34:28] you'll never get it, but you know, but
[1:34:31] let me go on. So, it's the same thing
[1:34:34] with this mental illness. Now, let me
[1:34:36] explain that. So, what happens is your
[1:34:38] your body and and the things in your
[1:34:40] brain, and I'm not going to get too
[1:34:42] technical here, but there's certain
[1:34:43] chemicals that have to be produced and
[1:34:46] released into your brain to your brain
[1:34:48] cells to get your brain to function
[1:34:50] right.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; All right? Uh
[1:34:54] I if if you're feeling happy, it's
[1:34:56] because certain chemicals are are
[1:34:58] hitting just right within your brain
[1:35:00] cells to make you feel happy. You know,
[1:35:02] the serotonin and endorphins and you
[1:35:05] know, all these other things. I'm not
[1:35:07] going to get into all the scientific
[1:35:09] technical names because it wouldn't
[1:35:10] really help you. But there's just
[1:35:12] suffice there are chemicals your body
[1:35:14] has to produce that feeds the cells in
[1:35:17] your brain and makes your brain work.
[1:35:19] Right? If that is not working right,
[1:35:22] just like your pancreas not working
[1:35:24] right, what happens is a person could
[1:35:27] have a bliss in their life. They could
[1:35:31] be nothing wrong and be as depressed as
[1:35:35] if the world had caved in on them.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; There's nothing tangible to it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Because it's not connected to an outside
[1:35:44] stressor.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; That's good. It's what I explained to
[1:35:50] you that ain't working right.
[1:35:53] Same thing with anxiety.
[1:35:56] Now, there's different things that
[1:35:57] people can be experienced anxiety over.
[1:36:00] All right? And and some people, you
[1:36:02] know, they get nervous around crowds and
[1:36:04] some people they, you know, different
[1:36:06] things that just kind of they have a
[1:36:08] little trouble and they get anxiety over
[1:36:09] it and things.
[1:36:11] But it but if your anxiety comes from
[1:36:14] what I've described you about a mental
[1:36:15] disease, there is nothing tangible about
[1:36:18] it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; You you could be standing in a room with
[1:36:24] people that loved you and you feel like
[1:36:26] you're about to die. That's right.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; You could be you could be standing there
[1:36:33] with nothing around you but air
[1:36:36] and feel a weight perhaps crushing you
[1:36:38] on your chest and you having a hard time
[1:36:41] breathing your heart racing and
[1:36:43] everything else pounding and hurting and
[1:36:46] there isn't really due to anything
[1:36:47] physical
[1:36:49] or or outside.
[1:36:51] Something ain't working right. The brain
[1:36:54] tells your body everything what to do.
[1:36:57] when they put a person when a person is
[1:37:00] there on the deathbed and if they're if
[1:37:02] they go brain dead, if their brain stops
[1:37:03] and they go brain dead, it don't matter
[1:37:05] how much that machine's making their
[1:37:07] heartbeat or making their lungs breathe
[1:37:10] or whatever, that person's gone.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Because it's a brain that makes this
[1:37:18] thing function.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; It's
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; tells it what to do. The brain is the
[1:37:23] control tower for your body.
[1:37:26] Thank God it's not the control tower
[1:37:28] from me.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; But that's what Satan tries to convince
[1:37:32] you it is. Remember brother Adam said
[1:37:34] this the greatest battle ever fought. He
[1:37:36] says Satan chose the mind. Now we we we
[1:37:40] believe that when we think about how
[1:37:42] Satan brings evil thoughts to us or
[1:37:44] brings outside stressors and battles and
[1:37:46] worries in our mind.
[1:37:49] But a demon can actually come. It's a
[1:37:51] demon of a mental illness and strike
[1:37:55] somebody just like a demon of cancer.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And and and friends, look, it's also
[1:38:05] something that you could be predisposed
[1:38:07] to. You know, when you go when you go to
[1:38:09] a doctor, they ask you, "Anybody in your
[1:38:12] family ever had heart disease?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody in your family a diabetic?
[1:38:16] Anybody in your family ever had high
[1:38:17] blood pressure?" That's like the three
[1:38:19] main ones they ask you on top of all the
[1:38:22] other ones
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; and they want to know and then they'll
[1:38:25] say who had it
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; and then and then they want to know this
[1:38:31] they want you know many I was used to
[1:38:33] them always asking me is your daddy your
[1:38:34] grandpa mama and all that whatever I I
[1:38:36] went to a doctor here a few years ago
[1:38:38] and they asked me say how about your
[1:38:39] brother
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; how about your brother they wanted to
[1:38:43] see not that I could get it from my
[1:38:45] brother but we were both off the same
[1:38:47] free.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Nope. You ain't got any of that.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; So they ask you, well, when you go for
[1:38:56] mental illness, they asked you, is there
[1:39:00] anybody in your family on either side
[1:39:02] ever suffer from mental illness?
[1:39:06] You tell them yes. Then they're going to
[1:39:08] ask you this. Has anybody on your on
[1:39:10] either side of your family then ever
[1:39:13] committed suicide or attempted suicide?
[1:39:18] Why? They know that it's it's the
[1:39:21] genetics that predisposes you to being
[1:39:23] able to have this disease.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the all diseases are of the
[1:39:27] devil.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; But think about this. Brother Ram said,
[1:39:32] "How do you get cancer?" He says, "Sell
[1:39:34] backslides in the body."
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; That just makes it real simple for us
[1:39:40] believers to understand.
[1:39:43] So I had some things backsliding up
[1:39:45] here. Didn't want to work right.
[1:39:50] So I I suffered depression so bad. And
[1:39:53] it wasn't because I had grandkids being
[1:39:55] born. We we weren't struggling
[1:39:57] financially. We everything it was I mean
[1:40:00] wonderful beautiful things.
[1:40:03] But I was suffering from depression.
[1:40:07] They call it, I believe they call it
[1:40:09] clinical depression. Clinical
[1:40:12] depression. Thank you, brother Roco.
[1:40:14] Listen, friends. Brother Roco has
[1:40:16] suffered through these very things that
[1:40:17] I'm telling you about as well. I don't
[1:40:19] mean to embarrass you, brother, but he's
[1:40:20] got quite a testimony, too.
[1:40:25] Clinical depression means it's not an
[1:40:28] outside stressor or something out here
[1:40:29] that's make you ain't got nothing to be
[1:40:31] depressed about.
[1:40:33] Just plain English.
[1:40:36] But you can't shake it. It's there
[1:40:39] because it's you ain't getting the right
[1:40:41] chemicals up there on them brain cells
[1:40:43] and so it's taking you through it.
[1:40:46] Anxiety,
[1:40:49] you know, I'll tell you what, Satan
[1:40:51] Satan, if you're suffering for anything
[1:40:53] you're Satan tries to work through
[1:40:55] embarrassment and shame.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I can tell you this from a a person who
[1:41:01] has suffered from what I've suffered
[1:41:02] from. He tries to make you ashamed.
[1:41:04] tries to make you embarrassed about it.
[1:41:06] He don't want you to share this. He
[1:41:07] don't want you to talk. He wants you to
[1:41:09] hide from people.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He wants you to hide it from people.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; When you get out around people, you
[1:41:16] know, when you feel like you can kind of
[1:41:17] hold yourself together a little bit, get
[1:41:19] around to people, you just put on a
[1:41:20] mask.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:41:23] Yeah,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; you put on a mask, you present that
[1:41:26] people around, they may not had no clue
[1:41:31] and you don't want them to be around you
[1:41:33] when you start having one of these
[1:41:36] attacks of depression or attacks of
[1:41:38] anxiety.
[1:41:39] I was I was 53 years old. I was getting
[1:41:41] ready to turn 54. Was out in the
[1:41:44] driveway and I got attack of anxiety.
[1:41:47] And I I'm going to tell you because I
[1:41:49] want you to see just how much how the
[1:41:51] devil will work through this. It don't
[1:41:53] make sense.
[1:41:55] But I was getting ready to turn 54 and a
[1:41:57] thought hit me. Your grandfather, the
[1:41:59] one you were so close to, he died at the
[1:42:01] age of 54. You are going to die. And I'm
[1:42:06] standing out there blubbering out there
[1:42:07] in the driveway. Mina comes out. What's
[1:42:09] wrong? What's going on? I said, I'm
[1:42:11] going to die.
[1:42:12] My patball died at 54. I'm getting ready
[1:42:15] to turn 54. I'm going to die. You can't
[1:42:18] stand there and reason with that
[1:42:20] individual to get them explained out of
[1:42:22] that. You ain't going to fix them.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "What do I do?" Just put your arm
[1:42:30] around him and love them.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Put your arm around him, love them, and
[1:42:33] just pray
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; because God's the only one can come on
[1:42:36] the scene and do something.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, you can't reason. You can't reason
[1:42:42] with them because they they they are
[1:42:44] afflicted with something that takes them
[1:42:47] beyond being able to reason because
[1:42:51] it's not something tangible.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; I was already beginning to suffer from
[1:43:05] this in the early part of 2011.
[1:43:09] It was already times what what started
[1:43:11] the first shines was started happening.
[1:43:15] You know, everybody be gone from the
[1:43:17] house. I'd be there alone in the
[1:43:18] morning. I'd wake up. I I couldn't even
[1:43:22] get out of bed.
[1:43:24] I only got out of bed if I had to walk
[1:43:25] over to the bathroom and then right back
[1:43:26] into the bed I came. I didn't eat. I
[1:43:28] didn't clean up. I didn't get dressed. I
[1:43:30] didn't do nothing. I just laid there and
[1:43:31] tried to sleep
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; because sleep seemed to be the only
[1:43:37] escape.
[1:43:39] from the torment of what seemed to be
[1:43:42] reality.
[1:43:46] So that was the start of it,
[1:43:49] you know, and at that point, nobody
[1:43:51] really knew what was going on. I didn't
[1:43:53] really know what was going on. I just
[1:43:54] know I was suffering bad, but I didn't
[1:43:56] really want to talk about it.
[1:43:59] Mina would come home, I had a you been
[1:44:01] up? No. Did you eat? No.
[1:44:05] Did you uh
[1:44:08] you didn't get up at all? I didn't take
[1:44:09] a shower or nothing. I didn't get up. I
[1:44:11] didn't.
[1:44:14] Let's get you cleaned up. Get you
[1:44:15] something to eat. I want to go back to
[1:44:16] bed.
[1:44:18] During that time, we had an individual
[1:44:20] in our church. He was also suffering
[1:44:23] from mental illness. Now, I'm just going
[1:44:25] to go a little bit into this because
[1:44:26] there's a whole another testimony about
[1:44:27] him and I think some of it you've heard
[1:44:29] before. Brother Tim her. And so, you
[1:44:33] know, here he was suffering from from
[1:44:34] mental illness. Now, I didn't
[1:44:36] understand. Let me tell you something.
[1:44:37] You know what the biggest hindrance to
[1:44:39] individuals that are suffering is?
[1:44:43] Look, I'm sorry if you don't like this
[1:44:44] word, but it's ignorance.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going on and
[1:44:50] nobody around you know what's going on.
[1:44:52] And then you got people around you that
[1:44:55] and sometimes preachers that don't
[1:44:57] understand what's going on and they're
[1:44:58] just telling you you ain't got the Holy
[1:45:00] Ghost. You ain't got faith.
[1:45:05] While I'm on that, just let me jump down
[1:45:07] here and read you a quote I throw in. I
[1:45:09] didn't give it to y'all because it came
[1:45:10] to me right before I came out of the
[1:45:12] back. Many times you see a person may be
[1:45:14] of insanity. Now, they may yet may be
[1:45:18] yet a converted person filled with the
[1:45:20] Holy Spirit yet be totally insane.
[1:45:25] That's right. That has nothing to do
[1:45:26] with the soul.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; It's a tormentor. something that
[1:45:31] torments them in their mind.
[1:45:38] But you have people out there that don't
[1:45:40] want to know, don't want to understand
[1:45:42] because they think everything's about an
[1:45:43] outside stressor
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; and they won't take time to go look at
[1:45:50] this. If you preachers, if any of y'all
[1:45:52] out there listen to me, just look up
[1:45:54] Charles Spurgeon and read it. He
[1:45:56] preached a message on depression and how
[1:46:00] mental illness affects God's people.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; I got I didn't want to I didn't want to
[1:46:16] talk to him. I I I I withdrew to myself
[1:46:18] sometimes my family around. I just go
[1:46:20] off and go to my room and shut the door
[1:46:22] and just sitting there by myself.
[1:46:24] I didn't want him to see me.
[1:46:27] I didn't I wouldn't go visit other
[1:46:29] churches. Y'all would see me up here
[1:46:31] maybe once a year. I know there was one
[1:46:33] year I never even came during that time.
[1:46:38] I'd come, you know, my dad or Samuel,
[1:46:40] they'd be forcing me to preach. I'm
[1:46:41] going to tell you something, people. I
[1:46:43] was preaching out of old notes I'd
[1:46:44] studied years ago, bringing it didn't
[1:46:47] have this kind of stuff then. I had
[1:46:49] paper up here.
[1:46:51] All I was doing is reading off it. You
[1:46:53] know why? because I I was suffering so
[1:46:55] bad with this mental illness sometime I
[1:46:58] couldn't think I couldn't get inspired I
[1:47:00] couldn't feel because listen listen I I
[1:47:04] believe all right I'm not against us
[1:47:07] using doctors and and and and science
[1:47:10] and medication to help us
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; all right but I can tell you this don't
[1:47:17] ever think because you have to take that
[1:47:19] that that's the rest of your lot in
[1:47:22] life.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; God can heal you.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was on medication. They
[1:47:36] started put what happened was
[1:47:38] I'm sorry. Let me let me go back and get
[1:47:40] a hold of this. So Tim Tim Horn was
[1:47:43] going through this and and it got I was
[1:47:46] trying to help him but he got God got on
[1:47:47] see him so bad, you know, and on the day
[1:47:49] on his wedding day he was supposed to
[1:47:51] get married. I was trying to get over to
[1:47:53] the church and and I was a little late
[1:47:54] getting over there before the wedding
[1:47:56] and and and and I I finally I got over
[1:47:58] there and he wasn't there at the church
[1:48:00] and and that and his dad wasn't there
[1:48:02] and I came in and I think it was his
[1:48:03] brother-in-law told me said uh uh Jim
[1:48:07] went to go find him and so uh so brother
[1:48:10] Jim calls me he says hey look get a key
[1:48:13] off somebody at his house he's got
[1:48:14] himself locked in his house come over
[1:48:16] here you know come out here where I'm at
[1:48:18] I'll be right there so I got a key drove
[1:48:20] out there by the time I got out there.
[1:48:21] Brother Jim had done left his house,
[1:48:23] drove out to the end of the road and was
[1:48:24] sitting out there at the end of the road
[1:48:25] in his vehicle because he heard
[1:48:27] something, but he didn't want to process
[1:48:30] that. So, we get back over to the house
[1:48:32] and we go in, I discover him. He he he
[1:48:35] he shot himself. He killed himself,
[1:48:37] committed suicide.
[1:48:40] Now, you know, there's a whole another
[1:48:41] testimony behind that, friends. And I
[1:48:43] could get into this whole thing and
[1:48:45] attack people's beliefs on thinking
[1:48:47] people that commit suicide are lost. But
[1:48:50] you know, that's a whole another thing.
[1:48:54] Suffice it to say, I don't believe that.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam didn't teach that. Neither
[1:48:58] does the Bible.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; That that that's actually a doctrine
[1:49:05] that even the Protestants who have it
[1:49:07] got it out of the Catholic Church.
[1:49:15] Let's go on. Anyway, so this is a
[1:49:18] horrific scene. All right. Now, any of
[1:49:22] you I Well, I was hoping Brother Cruz
[1:49:24] would be here this morning. Maybe he'll
[1:49:25] hear this. Look, Brother Cruz can tell
[1:49:28] you about soldiers suffering PTSD.
[1:49:31] You you suffer from things that you
[1:49:33] experienced, a trauma, a great trauma
[1:49:36] that happened to you like in war for
[1:49:38] soldiers. But any of you experience a
[1:49:41] great trauma that is greater than what
[1:49:44] your mind can handle and process, it
[1:49:47] causes post traumatic stress syndrome.
[1:49:53] They've actually now I think they call
[1:49:55] it PT
[1:49:58] S or PTDD or something post dramatic
[1:50:04] whatever it's disease. They want to put
[1:50:06] disease on there. But anyway, it's a
[1:50:09] it's a disorder that you have because of
[1:50:11] a trauma you has experienced. Now, what
[1:50:14] happens is that because just think about
[1:50:17] this, I I ended up with that on top of
[1:50:21] having this mental illness of depression
[1:50:23] and anxiety.
[1:50:26] And so, when that that will strike you
[1:50:28] and you go back through it, it could be
[1:50:29] just something that triggers it and and
[1:50:31] all of a sudden you're back there again.
[1:50:33] You're going through it. So whatever
[1:50:34] your body experienced and felt at that
[1:50:36] time, your blood pressure raised, your
[1:50:38] heart begin to race, pound or whatever,
[1:50:40] whatever you were feeling at that time,
[1:50:42] it's all over again. If they put a blood
[1:50:45] pressure cuff on you, your blood
[1:50:47] pressure would be up right then.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; You're experiencing it all over again.
[1:50:51] But it's all from here.
[1:50:57] They would tell me, they told me when I
[1:50:58] went in for for help with this, they
[1:51:00] said, "Look,
[1:51:03] our body is a sensory, you know, uh, our
[1:51:06] body reacts with sensory things."
[1:51:10] And said, "What your when your mind is
[1:51:12] going through this with a PTSD, it's
[1:51:14] it's not, you know, to to try to help
[1:51:17] you come out of that, you need to have
[1:51:18] something sensory going on." So, they
[1:51:21] would tell you like splash water on your
[1:51:23] face. They they told me he said get
[1:51:25] something that means something to you,
[1:51:26] hold it in your hand, you know. So I
[1:51:28] read what brother Brandham said about
[1:51:30] you know having a cross and how he look
[1:51:32] to it you know like he brother Brandham
[1:51:34] actually talked about having hanging off
[1:51:36] his mirror said if a Satan walked some
[1:51:39] un ungodly undressed woman down the
[1:51:41] street he would just turn and look at
[1:51:42] the cross.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; So I I'd read that. So I went and bought
[1:51:45] me a soldier's cross. And I and I had
[1:51:49] that cross and anytime that I would
[1:51:51] start to have that, I'd get it out and
[1:51:53] I'd just start to rub it. If I heard a
[1:51:56] gun go off, sent me into it.
[1:52:02] I had to do the graveside at Sister
[1:52:04] Linda's daddy's funeral,
[1:52:06] uh, Brother Carper. And I was up there
[1:52:08] and, you know, he was a soldier and and
[1:52:10] they done that 21 gun salute.
[1:52:16] I was off on the side. My aunt that knew
[1:52:18] what was going on that was over standing
[1:52:20] by me. I was off on the side. I dug down
[1:52:22] in here, pulled out that cross and I was
[1:52:24] just kind of rubbing it like that and
[1:52:25] trying to get my my my sensory off of
[1:52:28] that stuff and get my mind back
[1:52:33] and then I'd plead the blood.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; So, here I I had all this going on. Now,
[1:52:42] this thing with the PDSC, that was an
[1:52:44] outside stressor, but that's not what
[1:52:46] brought on my disease. My point in
[1:52:48] bringing this up is you can have that
[1:52:50] disease and then outside stressors will
[1:52:53] can just add to it.
[1:52:57] Some of the trial that you begin to go
[1:52:59] through or somebody attacking your
[1:53:00] family or taking you to court or
[1:53:02] something like that, it's just going to
[1:53:04] add to it.
[1:53:06] You already having trouble.
[1:53:11] Look, this is the reason I'm telling
[1:53:13] you. Look, it doesn't matter whe if
[1:53:15] you're suffering. It doesn't have to be
[1:53:17] a mental illness like I had a disease.
[1:53:19] We We all suffer mentally because that's
[1:53:21] how he battles us in our minds. What I'm
[1:53:23] trying to tell you is it's not like
[1:53:25] there's hope for some of it, but no hope
[1:53:27] for the other part.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord our God that health all of
[1:53:31] our diseases. I don't care what you
[1:53:33] might be suffering from, individual
[1:53:35] suffering from mentally. God is here to
[1:53:38] heal you. God is here to deliver you.
[1:53:41] Amen.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And and his deliverance, if it's outside
[1:53:45] stressors, things going on in your life,
[1:53:47] it isn't removing them.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; It's giving you the peace that surpasses
[1:53:51] all understanding to sit there and go
[1:53:53] through it.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; The peace that lets you endure.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Satan friends, look, he tries to work
[1:54:01] through fear. He worked through fear on
[1:54:03] me. I tell you what, there be time
[1:54:05] anxiety. What is anxiety? The person has
[1:54:08] this feeling of impending doom.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; They're going to die. Something bad's
[1:54:17] going to happen. So, hey, look, man.
[1:54:20] It's it's all, you know, rainbows and
[1:54:23] roses around here right now. They don't
[1:54:25] have anything to do with it.
[1:54:29] They they just they can't help it. It is
[1:54:31] not a a like a thought and you can't get
[1:54:35] out of it through positive thinking.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Friends, this is the one thing that
[1:54:43] there was times that that my wife had to
[1:54:46] rush home as I called her up and said,
[1:54:47] "That's it. I'm done. I'm ending this.
[1:54:50] You just want to escape."
[1:54:53] And and Satan tries to get you singled
[1:54:55] off and try to get you to where you
[1:54:56] you'll hide it and nobody knows what's
[1:54:58] going on in that. Why? Because he that's
[1:55:02] look brother gives a whole analogy about
[1:55:05] Satan trying to get the little deer off
[1:55:06] from the rest of the herd.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam uses that to talk about when
[1:55:10] Satan gets you so discouraged you don't
[1:55:12] want to come to church. He's got you all
[1:55:14] cut off from the rest of the believers.
[1:55:16] He's got you cut off from the preaching
[1:55:17] of the word.
[1:55:24] Hallelujah.
[1:55:32] 12 years I suffered from it.
[1:55:36] My wife and I, we began to look into it.
[1:55:39] I began to I I read what Charles
[1:55:41] Spurgeon preached about it,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; you know. We we looked up other things.
[1:55:45] Doctors, you know, helped us. I I'd went
[1:55:48] the whole reason I got went to the
[1:55:49] doctors about it is I talked to my wife
[1:55:51] and my my daughter oldest daughter
[1:55:53] finally told him you know Nate was
[1:55:55] getting married on the day he was
[1:55:56] getting married it was about a year
[1:55:58] after this other incident happened and
[1:56:00] man anxiety got on me and I I just you
[1:56:02] know that a thought my son's going to
[1:56:05] kill himself that wasn't reasonable
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; and and Satan was telling me do this to
[1:56:14] be to to to to get relief from that. So
[1:56:17] they said, "Why don't you just go out
[1:56:18] and get drunk?
[1:56:22] Why don't Why don't you just go do this
[1:56:24] or why don't you go do that?" And you
[1:56:25] you're like, "I don't want to do that."
[1:56:26] Oh, man. Yeah. Well, if I just want
[1:56:28] deliver, you know, and Satan says, "Why
[1:56:30] don't you just shoot yourself?
[1:56:35] Why don't you just commit suicide?
[1:56:38] Just end it.
[1:56:40] You'll get relief."
[1:56:44] I'll tell you something, friends. A
[1:56:45] person tormented so bad they they
[1:56:47] actually losing any type reasoning sense
[1:56:52] of whatever and that's what happens to
[1:56:54] them. They lose hope.
[1:56:59] And that's what Satan wants us to do.
[1:57:01] And everything that's going on in your
[1:57:03] life, anything you're suffering from,
[1:57:05] Satan wants you to lose hope.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm here to tell you this morning,
[1:57:12] 12 years later, I've made it through on
[1:57:13] the other side. The devil made me
[1:57:15] afraid. The devil brought fear on me. He
[1:57:18] tormented me. But I'm going to tell you
[1:57:20] this morning, friends, I'm not afraid of
[1:57:22] him anymore. But I can tell you who is.
[1:57:24] The devil is afraid of me because I am
[1:57:28] not going to be shut up. I'm going to
[1:57:30] talk about the faith of God. I'm going
[1:57:32] to testify of it. I'm going to tell you
[1:57:34] how God can deliver you, how God can set
[1:57:37] you free. I'm going to show you how it
[1:57:40] can look utterly hopeless and
[1:57:42] impossible, but you can make it through.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; God, I'm still counting my blessings.
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:58:01] I can look now and see why God the
[1:58:05] purpose he had me go through it. I I
[1:58:08] during the time I was going through it.
[1:58:10] Friends, I I prayed for somebody here
[1:58:12] several years back that was suffering
[1:58:14] from was on medication. She came up for
[1:58:16] prayer off the medication. and God
[1:58:18] healed her.
[1:58:20] Oh, over in the Philippines
[1:58:23] just counseling with somebody. I I'm not
[1:58:26] I'm not talking about personal counsel.
[1:58:27] We was like questions and answers to
[1:58:29] young people, me and my brother. And and
[1:58:32] somebody asked a question for a friend.
[1:58:35] This wasn't due to friends. She wasn't
[1:58:37] asking for herself. She asked a question
[1:58:39] for a friend about this feeling
[1:58:41] depressing and suicide and and thoughts
[1:58:44] and all these different things. And so
[1:58:46] Samuel was actually up there and Samuel
[1:58:47] looked at me and he goes, "Jerry, won't
[1:58:48] you come up and take this one?" And so I
[1:58:51] came up there and I just spoke and
[1:58:53] talked to the young people a bit. I was
[1:58:54] suffering bad, friends. It was 2019. I
[1:58:58] didn't get healed until 2023
[1:59:02] and I just came up and I just talked to
[1:59:04] him a little bit.
[1:59:07] The the camp ended. Sunday morning came.
[1:59:10] Brother Oel put me with his associate
[1:59:13] pastor and he took me up to some little
[1:59:14] village somewhere. Got in this little
[1:59:17] village in this little church, you know,
[1:59:20] and maybe maybe about I don't know less
[1:59:23] than a quarter the size of this
[1:59:25] building, the sanctuary. I mean, it was
[1:59:28] real small. People was around me just
[1:59:30] like about like this big right here.
[1:59:32] We're sisters sitting right there just
[1:59:34] around like that. That was it. Full of
[1:59:36] people.
[1:59:39] little old tiny place and I preached. I
[1:59:42] got done preaching. There was somebody
[1:59:44] who wanted to be baptized. We baptized
[1:59:46] them. And then then they they that kind
[1:59:49] of opened it up for testimonies. Here
[1:59:51] comes this young lady that had been at
[1:59:53] the camp comes up there and gives a
[1:59:55] testimony how God healed and delivered
[1:59:58] her from mental illness. She said
[2:00:00] because brother Jerry him what he said.
[2:00:05] And here I I was like, "God,
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; I'm suffering for this." And then I
[2:00:09] found where Brother Brandham was talking
[2:00:11] about how he had been afflicted and he
[2:00:12] was suffering. And brother Brandham when
[2:00:14] he was telling people about it, he he
[2:00:15] was telling them, "I'm still suffering
[2:00:17] from it."
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; And and and he told him, he said, and
[2:00:20] his thought was, you know, I've prayed
[2:00:22] for people that's got diseases far worse
[2:00:24] than what I'm afflicted with.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; And he says, and they are healed, and
[2:00:29] here I am still suffering. Brother Ram
[2:00:32] even told the people tell I'll get back
[2:00:34] to you on this. He wasn't healed yet,
[2:00:38] but God did heal him.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; But but I looked at that thought because
[2:00:43] I was thinking how could I pray for
[2:00:44] people and God heal them. Look, brother
[2:00:46] Ram says this. If you want your prayers
[2:00:48] to be successful, he says, put yourself
[2:00:50] in their shoes. I was able to do that.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; I was suffering. So when they come up to
[2:00:57] me suffering, I knew how they felt
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; and I was able to cry out to God for
[2:01:02] them. You said, "Then why weren't you
[2:01:03] getting healed?" Because I had to
[2:01:06] endure.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; God wanted me to endure. Why? Because I
[2:01:12] believe I'm going to reach souls clear
[2:01:13] around this world. We got young people
[2:01:16] out in the campsing from mental illness.
[2:01:18] We got churches suffering from mental
[2:01:20] ill. We got believers. Some of you
[2:01:23] friends, they suffer from mental
[2:01:24] illness. They give up hope and they
[2:01:26] actually end their lives.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody, God sends somebody.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, I'm willing
[2:01:36] for him to send me. I am happy that I
[2:01:39] endured.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; I don't look back at it and feel bad
[2:01:45] about that. I had to go through that. I
[2:01:47] feel happy that I did. But I tell you
[2:01:50] what,
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; I I the devil that's afflicted of
[2:01:56] people, he don't want me around because
[2:01:58] he's afraid of me now.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; I'll stand there with you just like
[2:02:08] David.
[2:02:09] Who is this Philistine that defies the
[2:02:12] armies of the living God?
[2:02:15] Who's this devil that's defying God's
[2:02:19] children?
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, brother Adam says
[2:02:25] this. He says this is in the message of
[2:02:28] uh faith cometh by hearing. He said,
[2:02:30] "Now it is true that some great person
[2:02:33] of faith or great warrior of faith has
[2:02:35] more faith to stand there that burly
[2:02:37] faith and take the thing away. But
[2:02:40] unless you stand right there with the
[2:02:42] same faith, it'll come right back again.
[2:02:45] I'm going to tell you something,
[2:02:46] friends.
[2:02:48] Going through it for 12 years, God
[2:02:51] taking me through it and endured to me
[2:02:53] coming out and being able friends to
[2:02:55] look back at the details. I got some
[2:02:57] blessings to count.
[2:03:00] I see God in it as I look back in the
[2:03:03] details of it.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, I can stand here
[2:03:06] today with you. I don't care what you're
[2:03:08] suffering from. I don't care what's
[2:03:09] going on in your life. Let's stand. I
[2:03:11] don't care what's going on in your life.
[2:03:12] I don't care what the devil has
[2:03:14] afflicted you with. I don't care whether
[2:03:16] it's finances. I don't care whether it's
[2:03:17] your job, your life, your family. I
[2:03:20] don't care if it's mental illness,
[2:03:21] physical illness. I'm going to tell you
[2:03:23] this. The devil will not stand before
[2:03:25] this faith this morning.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; I preached to you about faith to raise
[2:03:30] your faith.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; I've got faith to pray for you. I've got
[2:03:36] faith to stand here and believe on the
[2:03:38] word of God. I believe he'll lay hands
[2:03:40] on the sick and they shall recover. I
[2:03:43] believe he's the Lord our God that
[2:03:45] supply all we need. I believe he is the
[2:03:47] Lord our God. Hallelujah. That health
[2:03:50] all of our diseases. I believe he's the
[2:03:53] Lord our God. He that he is our banner.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Will you believe?
[2:04:03] I've preached to you to raise your faith
[2:04:04] to a level. Let's believe together.
[2:04:07] Nothing will stand before you.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; The devil has got to go. He's got to
[2:04:12] back down. He has no right. You belong
[2:04:15] to God.
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; I got one last quote.
[2:04:23] Let me find it.
[2:04:29] Brother says this. He swore by himself,
[2:04:31] not by faith. move right into this blood
[2:04:33] cell with the Lord Jesus where all those
[2:04:36] redemptive blessings are yours. You're
[2:04:39] everyone a Christian. Then if you're
[2:04:41] Christians, you have a right,
[2:04:45] a legal right for everything that Christ
[2:04:48] died for. It's your possession. You own
[2:04:51] it.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Random talks to the
[2:04:59] interview with Sister Bruce. We know
[2:05:01] what that's about. This is This is
[2:05:03] Sister Bruce. She doesn't think she has
[2:05:04] the Holy Ghost. The devil is pointing at
[2:05:06] her hall, her mistakes, right? And so
[2:05:08] she's pointing at the devil's pointing
[2:05:10] at the mistakes is an evidence. She
[2:05:12] don't got it. Brother Brandon points to
[2:05:14] the evidence down in her soul. That's
[2:05:16] where your real evidence is. He said,
[2:05:18] "You were going this way, you were
[2:05:20] living this way, and then something
[2:05:22] changed you, and now you're not that
[2:05:25] way. Look at your desire and think,
[2:05:27] remember, read the interview." But she
[2:05:29] says this, "I've made so many mistakes."
[2:05:33] That was that was the the last thing. I
[2:05:35] make so many mistakes. Brother Bam said
[2:05:38] that's what he died for.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; No matter friends, look, I don't care
[2:05:45] what what it is that that you have need
[2:05:48] of this morning. That's what he died
[2:05:51] for.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank
[2:05:56] you this morning. Dear God, I ask Lord
[2:05:58] for you to come. Lord, I ask Lord God
[2:06:01] that you would touch these people. Lord,
[2:06:03] I don't know what's going on in their
[2:06:05] lives, dear God. And Lord, I just felt
[2:06:07] by impressed by you, Lord, to give more
[2:06:09] of my testimony here again. They them to
[2:06:12] hear a little more about it. And Lord,
[2:06:14] but more or less, God, to testify, dear
[2:06:16] God, of being recovered. I'm sure, dear
[2:06:19] God, if they go back through the the the
[2:06:21] the the the video files that they got on
[2:06:24] file around here when I preached years
[2:06:26] ago, they could go and look and they
[2:06:27] could see a difference today.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; What is it? You've restored me, God.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; It was my preaching was never my
[2:06:37] ability. It was always you inspire me
[2:06:40] and anointing me. But God, you have us
[2:06:43] go through experiences, dear God, that
[2:06:45] we can draw from that point us back to
[2:06:47] the word that we can testify of.
[2:06:53] But Lord, I'm not I'm not here, God,
[2:06:56] just with my words to tell them I'm
[2:06:58] recovered. Lord, God, this message was
[2:07:00] about showing them that I'm recovered,
[2:07:03] putting it right in the devil's face,
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; a testimony. their God. It It should be
[2:07:11] just radiating from me right now.
[2:07:14] I am free.
[2:07:16] [Music]

[2:22:40] she'd say, "What can I And I'd say

[2:22:51] two individuals on the name out to you.
[2:22:52] Brother Boat is one of them. He's over

[2:22:56] He's been a friend of me ever since I
[2:22:57] moved down there 26 and a half years
[2:22:59] ago. And and and so he would reach out
[2:23:02] to me by phone. I I actually pulled away
[2:23:04] from everybody. I I I wouldn't visit
[2:23:06] nobody. I wouldn't go nowhere. I just
[2:23:08] kind of pulled away and and stayed away.
[2:23:10] become brother Dave Moore said I become
[2:23:12] a hermit and uh but I just I pulled away
[2:23:15] from everybody calls embarrassment and
[2:23:17] shame and and guilt and all these
[2:23:19] different things you know and actually
[2:23:21] you know feeling like that nobody
[2:23:24] understood feeling like you know that I
[2:23:26] was being condemned by others that would
[2:23:28] say you know well there's something
[2:23:29] wrong with you spiritually
[2:23:32] but brother Bo never did that brother Bo
[2:23:34] wouldn't leave me alone brother Bo would
[2:23:37] call me sometimes I tried to dodge his
[2:23:39] call but he just keep calling and I'd
[2:23:41] have to answer. And brother Bo would get
[2:23:42] me on the phone and he would talk to me.
[2:23:44] If I called him up, he'd friends, he'd
[2:23:46] leave West Tennessee and come over
[2:23:48] Middle Tennessee, he just come pray for
[2:23:49] me.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Wow.

[2:23:54] there for me as a friend.

[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't try to fix me, brother Roco.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; He just was there to pray with me. He
[2:24:02] was just there to believe with me. He
[2:24:04] was just there. He would come preach for
[2:24:06] me. He prayed for me. God touched me
[2:24:08] during a time right in the middle of it
[2:24:10] in 2016. Satan had me convinced I did
[2:24:13] not have the Holy Ghost that God didn't
[2:24:16] he was done with me through with me and
[2:24:19] God came and slayed me out in the spirit
[2:24:20] under his prayer and and and I wasn't
[2:24:23] healed. But I'll tell you one thing, I
[2:24:26] begin to climb up out of that valley I
[2:24:28] was in that I didn't have the Holy Ghost
[2:24:30] and God didn't care about me. I want
[2:24:32] tell you another one.
[2:24:34] Brother David Crest Jr. over here.
[2:24:40] He would send me cards.
[2:24:45] He knew that there was something about
[2:24:47] going through the mountains of West
[2:24:48] Virginia would help me.
[2:24:51] He helped me get there.
[2:25:01] He anonymously sent some toys for me to
[2:25:04] go.
[2:25:06] He would send me cards. He would text
[2:25:07] me.
[2:25:09] He say, "Brother Jerry, y'all laid you
[2:25:11] on my heart to pray. I don't know what's
[2:25:13] going on, but I just want to let you
[2:25:15] know I'm praying for you." I And I tell
[2:25:18] him, I say, "Brother David, I'll give
[2:25:21] you a testimony about it later."

[2:26:08] Chris, back me up on this. He says,
[2:26:11] "When God lays a burden on your heart
[2:26:14] for somebody, he said it's that person's
[2:26:16] angel that's come to you."
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; That person's angel has come to you
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; to ask you to pray for him.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; We each one have a particular angel
[2:26:30] that's been assigned to us.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what the prophet of God said.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get a burden on your
[2:26:36] heart and go to prayer.

[2:26:50] How you think you can I don't know if I
[2:26:51] can sing this song, but I want to sing
[2:26:53] that chorus at least again that I sung
[2:26:55] earlier. The Lord will help me
[2:26:59] cut my mic just a minute.
[2:27:03] Too slow.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at this. Let me say
[2:27:10] tell you what this says. It says,
[2:27:14] "It's like it was yesterday that I was
[2:27:17] praying for a miracle, scared to have a
[2:27:21] little hope."
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; And now looking back, seeing all the
[2:27:28] things that you've done,
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; I can't even add them up.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; One, two, three, up to infinity. I'd run
[2:27:38] out of numbers before I can thank you
[2:27:40] for everything.
[2:27:43] I know you. Let's try another key.
[2:27:46] Something a little bit lower where I can
[2:27:47] get higher.
[2:27:50] I think that was in G. Let's go a little
[2:27:51] bit lower than that.
[2:27:55] Hallelujah.
[2:28:01] God, I'm still counting my blessings.
[2:28:06] all that you done in my life.
[2:28:10] The more that I look in the details,
[2:28:13] the more of your goodness I'll find.
[2:28:18] Father, on this side of heaven,
[2:28:22] I know I'll run out of time,
[2:28:26] but I will keep counting my blessings,
[2:28:30] knowing I can't count that high.
[2:28:36] God, I'm still counting my blessings.
[2:28:38] Sing it with me if you can. All that you
[2:28:41] done in my life.
[2:28:44] The more that I look in the details, the
[2:28:46] more that I look in the details,
[2:28:51] the more of your goodness I'll find.
[2:28:56] Father on this side of heaven.
[2:29:01] I know I'll run out of time,
[2:29:05] but I will keep counting my blessings,
[2:29:09] knowing I can't count that high.
[2:29:15] And I know that seasons
[2:29:19] never last forever.
[2:29:22] So God, I will remember
[2:29:25] all of the reasons
[2:29:28] my heart has to be grateful.
[2:29:32] All of the times you've been faithful to
[2:29:36] me.
[2:29:38] And God, I'll keep counting my
[2:29:40] blessings.
[2:29:42] All that you done in my life.
[2:29:46] The more that I look in the details,
[2:29:50] the more of your goodness I'll find.
[2:29:54] Oh, Father, on this side of heaven,
[2:29:59] I know I'll run out of time,
[2:30:02] but I will keep counting my blessings,
[2:30:07] knowing I can't count that.
[2:30:12] You know what? He's blessed me in so
[2:30:15] many ways, friends, and he ain't
[2:30:17] stopped. He ain't never stopped.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; He has blessed me in so many ways in my
[2:30:23] life
[2:30:25] that if I started counting them today,
[2:30:28] I wouldn't have enough time between here
[2:30:30] and the resurrection and rapture to tell
[2:30:32] you all about all of them.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; That's what that means. I'm going to run
[2:30:38] out of time here in this life. I got
[2:30:41] He's just blessed me in so many ways. I
[2:30:44] don't got enough time to to actually
[2:30:46] number them all
[2:30:49] because it it's it's eternal. It just
[2:30:52] keeps going. It's infinite.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; He just keeps blessing us.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't don't wallow. Don't
[2:31:02] wallow in in what's going on.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Count your blessings.
[2:31:09] You might be going through the worst
[2:31:11] thing in your life right now, but that's
[2:31:13] only because it's an opportunity for God
[2:31:16] to bless you.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Your sickness is an opportunity for
[2:31:21] healing.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; If you're bound, it's an opportunity for
[2:31:29] deliverance.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; If you're lost, it's an opportunity to
[2:31:33] be saved.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; What is it? Hallelujah.
[2:31:40] He has attributes that he wants to
[2:31:42] display to us.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants to bless us.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Friends, he wants to bless you more than
[2:31:49] you want to be blessed. If you could
[2:31:51] believe that,
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; God wants good things for you, his
[2:31:55] children.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; He just don't want us to become
[2:32:00] complacent and comfortable in this life.
[2:32:03] Amen.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; I believe what's going on right now.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Read the message. Brother Adam talks
[2:32:10] about as the eagle stirth her nest. I
[2:32:12] believe that's what's going on right
[2:32:13] now.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; That eagle begins to take all the fluff
[2:32:16] out of the nest.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's time for that eagle is to leave
[2:32:20] that nest.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; We're in the nest of this world. I
[2:32:23] believe the fluff is being it's being
[2:32:25] took out.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; God's letting it take out the fluff.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "I ain't comfortable here no more.
[2:32:31] You ain't supposed to be.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; God wants us to get ready to get out of
[2:32:37] here, my friends.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm looking forward, brother David,
[2:32:42] to the time of the millennium when Satan
[2:32:43] will be bound for a thousand years. And
[2:32:46] that chain that he's bound by is a chain
[2:32:48] of circumstance. Meaning that I am in I
[2:32:51] I it's not just my soul that's in the
[2:32:54] redeemed state, but my I'll be in a
[2:32:56] theophony,
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; right? I'll be in a theophony, which
[2:33:00] right now I'm in a human spirit. It's
[2:33:02] got all these gates that the devil
[2:33:04] torments me in. My memory, my conscious,
[2:33:07] my reasoning, my imagination, my
[2:33:09] affections.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; The devil torments me in them. Oh, but
[2:33:14] we know one day we're going to that
[2:33:15] marriage supper of the lamb and and and
[2:33:17] we're going to be sitting there and
[2:33:18] brother random said, "You're going to
[2:33:19] look around and you're going to notice
[2:33:21] so and so didn't make it. They ain't
[2:33:22] here at that table. This one didn't make
[2:33:25] it. My son didn't make it. My daughter
[2:33:26] didn't make it. This one didn't make it.
[2:33:28] this level, this brother, this is
[2:33:29] somebody, you know, they didn't make it
[2:33:31] and you're going to be sad.
[2:33:34] He says, "Then God is going to come
[2:33:36] around and he's just going to wipe that
[2:33:39] from your memory."
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; You'll see them again, but it won't be
[2:33:44] with the same memory. If they don't make
[2:33:47] it, you'll see them there at the day of
[2:33:49] judgment. But they won't be standing
[2:33:51] there as the person you had remembered
[2:33:53] them back about like before God gives
[2:33:56] you that deliverance.
[2:34:00] I try to tell I try to tell, you know, I
[2:34:02] try I've told my kids that and everybody
[2:34:04] else. Hey, look. If you don't if you
[2:34:06] don't come to God and accept God's way,
[2:34:09] if you end up standing out there on the
[2:34:11] day of judgment, I will not be looking
[2:34:13] down at you as my son or my daughter or
[2:34:15] whoever you are. I won't be looking at
[2:34:17] you that way no more. No, it's you're
[2:34:20] being judged on your works because
[2:34:22] that's what you chose.
[2:34:25] You get on that. Anyway, look, I'm
[2:34:27] looking forward to that time. But here's
[2:34:29] the thing. Right now, I'm living in in a
[2:34:32] in I got the my my spirit can be
[2:34:35] tormented. Satan can get in those gates,
[2:34:37] you know, in my spirit and just and just
[2:34:39] wreck havoc and make me worry,
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; He can he can afflict my body.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; But I ain't waiting till the time of
[2:34:48] millennium to shout in the face of the
[2:34:50] devil.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do it right now.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; I ain't waiting till the time millennium
[2:34:55] to take possession.
[2:34:57] This is my possession.
[2:35:04] I'm taking possession now. I'm going to
[2:35:07] let the God that that that that has
[2:35:09] changed my soul on the inside. I'm going
[2:35:12] to let that be the control tower
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; and bring this outside spirit and flesh
[2:35:17] into subjection to the word.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to testify
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; right now with only one part of my being
[2:35:29] living in a redeemed state. I'm going to
[2:35:32] testify of redemption. I'm going to
[2:35:35] testify of complete redemption. I'm
[2:35:37] going to testify of deliverance. I'm
[2:35:39] going to testify that I am more than a
[2:35:43] conqueror
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:49] I'm going to rule now.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. over this old boy.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This flesh.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give in to it. That's
[2:36:01] what Satan wants us to do.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; Let's shout the victory now. Let's sing
[2:36:09] some kind of song of victory, brother
[2:36:10] Brian. Hallelujah.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:19] One night while on life's raging sea
[2:36:24] looked as if I would suffer defeat as
[2:36:29] the blackness of night closed off the
[2:36:32] light. My heart sank with fear.
[2:36:38] My desperate cry rang out with fright.
[2:36:43] All I could see was no hope inside.
[2:36:48] Faith all but gone. I met the one who
[2:36:52] was looking for me.
[2:36:56] He came looking for me.
[2:37:01] He came looking for me.
[2:37:06] But he made a way where there was no way
[2:37:11] that I could see.
[2:37:16] I drifted far. Jesus was near. Rescue my
[2:37:22] soul. Come all my fear.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; And
[2:37:28] I met the one came looking for me.
[2:37:35] Satan had already.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory
[2:37:40] be to God. Thank you Lord for for
[2:37:44] delivering me dear God. Thank you dear
[2:37:46] God for healing me Lord.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lost.
[2:37:54] I knew my destruction was a matter of
[2:37:58] time. Jesus appeared. said, "This old
[2:38:02] boy's mine. Now I'm safe with no home."
[2:38:05] Because he walked through the storm. He
[2:38:08] came looking for me.
[2:38:12] He came looking for me.
[2:38:15] [Music]
[2:38:17] He came looking for me.
[2:38:22] He made a way. There was no way.
[2:38:26] Hallelujah.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; That I could see.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; I drifted far.
[2:38:34] Hallelujah. Was near. Hallelujah.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; Rescued my soul. Come on.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; I feel so good.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Now I'm safe from all harm.
[2:38:44] I met the one. Hallelujah. Came looking
[2:38:47] for me. Second verse.
[2:38:51] Satan had already picked out my grave.
[2:38:55] His plan was to fall and to put me away.
[2:39:00] I drifted so far when he
[2:39:05] I'd soon be lost.
[2:39:10] I knew my destruction was a matter of
[2:39:14] time. Oh, but Jesus appeared. Said,
[2:39:17] "This one is mine. Now I'm safe with no
[2:39:21] home." Hallelujah. cuz he walked through
[2:39:23] a storm and came looking for me.
[2:39:28] Oh, he came looking.
[2:39:31] Oh, hallelujah Jesus. He came.
[2:39:35] Hallelujah.
[2:39:37] Well, yes, he made a way.
[2:39:41] There was no way that I could see.
[2:39:48] I drifted far. Jesus was near. Rescued
[2:39:54] my soul. Called all my fears. Now I'm
[2:39:58] safe from all. Those who walked through
[2:40:01] the storm came looking for me.
[2:40:07] Oh, I drifted so far, but Jesus came
[2:40:11] near. He rescued my soul.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. Yes, he did. Hallelujah.
[2:40:18] came from home since I met the one who
[2:40:22] came looking for me. Hallelujah.

[2:41:20] to God. He set me free. Lord, now I am

[2:41:34] drifted away. Oh my feet are planted
[2:41:40] on your ground and glory to God at home

[2:43:18] [Music]
[2:43:38] God bless you all. I just I trying to
[2:43:41] get away from this, but I can't get away
[2:43:42] from it. So, it may be for someone here
[2:43:45] may be suffering depressing, but my wife
[2:43:48] can uh If this is true, for six years I
[2:43:53] went through depression. I thought any
[2:43:55] minute my mind was going to snap. She
[2:43:58] had to pray with me and sing with me and
[2:44:02] for six long years this went on. So I
[2:44:05] was going to work one day and I stopped
[2:44:08] at this light and it was 250 in Bulgar
[2:44:10] Road and I didn't know years later I'd
[2:44:12] be living on Bogurt Road. But while I
[2:44:14] was waiting on the light to change, he
[2:44:17] spoke to me in here. I won't lie to you
[2:44:20] if I I know I'd be standing before him.
[2:44:22] I tell you the same thing. He spoke to
[2:44:25] my heart and he said in I can't explain
[2:44:28] it. It's inside a tender voice in my
[2:44:30] heart. And he said, "This won't bother
[2:44:33] you anymore." And it lifted. And that's
[2:44:36] been many, many years ago, and it's
[2:44:39] never bothered me since. And it won't
[2:44:42] because it's him
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; and what he did for any of us, he can do
[2:44:46] for you.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:44:54] Amen. Let's just let's just all bow our
[2:44:56] heads and go before the Lord in prayer.
[2:44:59] Amen. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much,
[2:45:01] Lord, for what the brothers spoke today.
[2:45:04] You're the Lord our God that health all
[2:45:06] our diseases, Lord. And there's no shame
[2:45:08] to come to you whether the enemy would
[2:45:09] attack us in our body or it attack us in
[2:45:12] our mind, Lord. There's no shame. We're
[2:45:14] so thankful, Lord, for his testimony.
[2:45:16] What you did in his life, how you how
[2:45:18] you set him free, Lord, after all those
[2:45:20] years, Lord. And I pray that, Lord
[2:45:22] Jesus, we'd be able to take that as a
[2:45:23] testimony. Help us, Lord, if we see one
[2:45:25] another, a brother, sister, they look
[2:45:27] down something like the brother said,
[2:45:29] let's not try to fix them, Lord. Let's
[2:45:31] just let them know how much we love
[2:45:32] them. Lord, call them up, Lord Jesus.
[2:45:35] Send them a text, Lord. Head over to
[2:45:36] their house, fellowship with them, pray
[2:45:38] with them, Lord Jesus. I pray that we'd
[2:45:40] be able to stand there. You want us to
[2:45:43] be a body you can use, Lord God. You
[2:45:45] need someone to work through, Lord, to
[2:45:46] minister to your children, Lord. Use us
[2:45:49] for your glory, Lord. Help us to
[2:45:51] minister to one another, Lord. We may
[2:45:53] not be called to preach preach the
[2:45:55] gospel, Lord, with it with with our
[2:45:57] mouths in the pullpit, Lord, but we can
[2:45:58] we can speak the word of God to one
[2:46:00] another, Lord Jesus, as you give us
[2:46:02] utterance, Lord. I pray that you do
[2:46:04] that, Lord. Appreciate Brother Jerry.
[2:46:06] God bless him, Lord. Please bless his
[2:46:08] his body. Give him rest, Lord.
[2:46:09] Appreciate that message today. watch
[2:46:10] over our pastor as he travels home, Lord
[2:46:13] Jesus, from Texas, Lord. And uh we just
[2:46:16] give you the thanks, Lord Jesus. We're
[2:46:18] so thankful, Lord, as the brother said,
[2:46:19] there's I'm glad when you dispel the
[2:46:21] ignorance from our life, Lord Jesus, and
[2:46:23] we can receive your word, Lord, and be
[2:46:25] have no more knowledge and wisdom in the
[2:46:27] ways that you work, Lord. We're so
[2:46:29] thankful for it today. Thank you for
[2:46:31] your word. Thank you for your blessings.
[2:46:32] Thank you for the spirit that was here
[2:46:34] today, Lord God. May it just become a
[2:46:36] part of our life. May we walk in it from
[2:46:38] here on out. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:46:40] pray.
[2:46:41] Amen. God bless you all. You're
[2:46:43] dismissed in the name of the Lord. The
[2:46:45] Lord go with you. Be with you.
[2:46:49] God bless you, brother.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you, too.
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hey, thank you for helping me. Thank you
[2:46:53] for helping me.

[2:47:16] way down in my soul.
[2:47:23] He's got it all
[2:47:25] in control.
[2:47:28] [Music]
[2:47:30] I put my life in his hands.
[2:47:38] I put my life
[2:47:40] in his hand.
[2:47:45] Every road I walk down,
[2:47:49] it's in his plans.
[2:47:54] I put my life in his hands.
[2:48:00] He's got it all.
[2:48:02] He's got it all in control.
[2:48:09] He's got it all in control.
[2:48:16] Put that reassurance
[2:48:20] way down in my soul.
[2:48:26] He's got it all in control. My father
[2:48:30] knows what I need.
[2:48:34] My father knows what I need.
[2:48:41] My father knows what I need.
[2:48:48] Every trial I go through,
[2:48:51] he knows what's best for me.
[2:48:58] My father knows what I need.
[2:49:05] He's got it all.
[2:49:12] [Music]
[2:49:17] Heat. Heat.
