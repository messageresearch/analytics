[36:57] [Music]
[36:59] you love the lord this morning
[37:01] it's so good to be in the house of the
[37:03] lord
[37:04] so good to see each and every one of you
[37:05] glad to have brother bill
[37:07] back here with us amen and
[37:10] joey
[37:11] amen different ones good to see you
[37:13] brother josh and says john mariah
[37:15] yeah
[37:17] my it's just good to be it's good to be
[37:19] together
[37:21] you know i think of many of those these
[37:23] times that we you look at and
[37:25] [Music]
[37:27] you know you you
[37:29] we we look at it in terms of that we
[37:31] know that even this gathering here this
[37:33] morning
[37:35] we can't even expect that this gathering
[37:36] would be the same next week
[37:39] next month
[37:40] or next year
[37:42] there's others that's gone on home to be
[37:44] with the lord
[37:46] and these are things that even with that
[37:48] right here we certainly want to take the
[37:50] the most of every opportunity
[37:53] it's pretty incredible how brother
[37:55] branham would bring it in the message
[37:56] feast of the trumpets and he's just
[37:59] he's dealing with all those spirits that
[38:00] have been released
[38:03] and you know
[38:05] satan can't he cannot um
[38:08] stop the program of god
[38:10] he'll do all he can to try to hinder it
[38:13] but everything god has it there's a
[38:16] junction and that junction will be met
[38:20] it's just like everything in our life
[38:22] there's a there's everything and what's
[38:24] to be fulfilled the purpose the
[38:27] everything within that right there
[38:29] and there's nothing
[38:31] can take us before that purpose is done
[38:34] nothing
[38:35] as a matter of fact brother brandon
[38:36] would say just like this he said when
[38:38] god's through with me here i'm ready to
[38:40] go
[38:42] how could he say that because
[38:44] christ was his everything
[38:47] while he was here
[38:49] every part of his life it was revolved
[38:51] around jesus christ i'll tell you what a
[38:53] [Music]
[38:55] what a testimony when you go back and
[38:57] you know we have little bits and pieces
[38:59] on
[39:01] and i say bits and pieces on tape when
[39:03] you go through and you listen to the
[39:05] supernatural series
[39:07] and how brother owen jurgensen wrote
[39:09] that out and you listen to the very
[39:11] beginnings
[39:12] there you realize that here
[39:15] the vessel that god used in this hour
[39:18] was just like you and i
[39:20] and what i mean is is that you find one
[39:22] he was running from god
[39:25] as a matter of fact when they even
[39:27] referred to him one of his buddies
[39:28] referred to him as you look like a
[39:30] preacher billy in that suit he was ready
[39:32] to fight him
[39:34] [Music]
[39:39] but you see what what's awesome about
[39:41] that is because down beneath all of that
[39:44] darkness
[39:45] see that was confusion that's where our
[39:46] lives were at
[39:48] let me just say it's very clearly you
[39:49] might have said and said in a message
[39:51] church and it's not the message that's
[39:53] brought confusion
[39:55] but the light itself comes to bring
[39:57] break us out of that chaos
[40:00] we were born into
[40:02] because our first birth is chaos
[40:06] but when you can receive that overcoming
[40:08] power on the inside then it brings order
[40:10] to your life
[40:12] then it brings clarity then it brings
[40:14] fruit then it brings all this is
[40:16] this is what i have longed for
[40:20] he is my everything
[40:23] amen
[40:24] you know
[40:26] i want to
[40:28] just mention here
[40:29] i want to have uh brother dave
[40:32] senior and i'm going to ask brother
[40:34] brian to give their
[40:35] just testimonies here briefly are what
[40:37] they wanted to say concerning the men's
[40:39] meeting
[40:42] and
[40:43] then i have just another announcement be
[40:45] sure

[40:48] some of you do and some of you do and
[40:50] you don't check it
[40:54] and and some people they some some
[40:56] people check it and then you know after
[40:58] announcements and things like this and
[41:00] people say hey what about this and what
[41:02] about that you better be careful you're
[41:03] giving yourself away
[41:06] because if you're not paying attention
[41:07] then i know whether you're not streaming
[41:09] or not
[41:11] hello somebody
[41:13] because if you're asking things that's
[41:14] already been covered then
[41:16] we we know so
[41:18] i want to just uh
[41:21] invite to maybe we can have brother dave
[41:23] senior have him come first and then
[41:25] we'll have brother brian
[41:28] where's this microphone here we go
[41:34] get this one i don't like those corded
[41:36] things
[41:43] are we there
[41:45] we are
[41:46] i don't get any i'm not getting no
[41:47] signal
[41:51] there we go thank you
[41:53] come on over this way
[41:59] i bless you i'm just a little nervous
[42:01] but
[42:02] i'll try i
[42:04] i thought
[42:05] a
[42:06] psalm that come to me the meetings
[42:08] i can't quote it psalms 133 he said how
[42:11] good he is
[42:12] for brethren to be well together in
[42:14] unity it's like the precious snoring all
[42:18] on eric's head that run down his beard
[42:20] to the helm of his garment
[42:22] and i thought that was a good scripture
[42:25] right there to
[42:26] describe those meetings and i'll have to
[42:29] say
[42:30] to begin with i was
[42:32] i was battling infection
[42:35] and it really was a battle and i i know
[42:38] david was over the house one day and i
[42:40] just tell him i said dave pray for me is
[42:42] this
[42:43] really a battle here and he said dad he
[42:45] said i'm praying for you but he said
[42:47] i wonder sometimes if
[42:49] it isn't the devil trying to take a
[42:50] blessing away from you
[42:52] and so i got to thinking of that and you
[42:54] know brother adam said
[42:56] god's put something on your heart you
[42:58] know satan bought value but go ahead and
[43:00] do it anyway
[43:01] and sometimes we have to make a
[43:02] sacrifice
[43:04] and i certainly can tell you i got up
[43:07] that morning
[43:08] and boy it was battling me so bad and i
[43:11] told shelly i said honey
[43:13] i just don't think i can go this is
[43:14] hurting so bad it's so hard
[43:17] and i got to thinking about what he said
[43:19] and i know the lord
[43:21] you know thinking of on his word and i
[43:23] said you know what i'll just try to
[43:25] start getting ready here and see how it
[43:27] goes
[43:28] and the time i got ready i text dave and
[43:30] said i'm ready to go
[43:32] so the grace of god and we had wonderful
[43:34] fellowship down there and
[43:36] i got to say too
[43:39] we got into service and
[43:41] the brothers started singing and
[43:43] everyone that
[43:45] that just kind of faded away
[43:47] you know i was my body was still giving
[43:49] me a battle but
[43:50] that didn't make any difference there
[43:52] and the word was precious
[43:55] and it challenged me we just take that
[43:57] in our hearts
[43:59] you know i'm an old man i've been this
[44:01] this way
[44:02] 53 years but
[44:04] you know what that word's still precious
[44:06] he's still working on us he's not done
[44:08] with us yet we're not there but we're on
[44:11] our way and i
[44:12] and that i left there i was blessed i
[44:16] was challenged to be a better husband a
[44:18] better daddy
[44:20] a better brother to my brothers and
[44:22] sisters
[44:22] and certainly closer to my lord and more
[44:25] sincere and all that i do

[44:45] and i love him with all my being and the
[44:47] more i know of him
[44:49] the more i love him
[44:51] and you know i think of
[44:53] what apostle paul said too
[44:56] let us run this race with patience
[44:59] looking to the author and finish of our
[45:01] faith
[45:03] and our lord jesus christ he that we're
[45:05] going to good work in us he will finish
[45:08] it we know that
[45:10] and i was telling sister browning out
[45:11] there in the vestview one day and as an
[45:13] army we had to
[45:15] we had to run a mile it was just part of
[45:17] your training and
[45:18] i was a young soldier and strong and
[45:22] we
[45:22] we started out
[45:24] and well i had a head of steam i was so
[45:26] strong and i'm running
[45:28] and i'm running
[45:29] and i'm getting them down the track and
[45:32] i'm getting tired and i'm paying for
[45:34] breath
[45:36] and i'm keeping going
[45:37] i mean but you know what it got to the
[45:40] place i just couldn't hardly get my
[45:42] breath my legs was numb but you know
[45:44] what
[45:45] i could see the finish line
[45:48] oh my god
[45:50] you know what we're in this battle i
[45:52] know the world's going darker yeah you
[45:55] know what we need all the help we get
[45:56] but hate it the gun is working us you
[45:58] see it's
[45:59] and i can see the finish line brothers
[46:01] and sisters we're newer than we've ever
[46:03] been we're close to that shore
[46:05] so i just encourage you brothers if god
[46:08] carries another year if you can you know
[46:11] try to make those meetings i'll tell you
[46:13] what i come a really glad and was
[46:15] blessed and was so glad that i did god
[46:18] bless you
[46:24] i want to say one other thing
[46:27] in that
[46:29] that
[46:29] the brothers were so kind to me talking
[46:32] about brotherly love i can and little
[46:34] things like experience that there where
[46:35] they they would help me out of the
[46:37] vehicle
[46:39] and just give me a hand and brother
[46:40] sammy we go out of his way to
[46:43] to take us up that hill to the meeting
[46:46] and normally i could have climbed up
[46:48] with no problem but you know what i was
[46:50] really thankful
[46:51] that just just the love of god and that
[46:53] just such a blessing to me
[47:03] well i'll tell you he sat in the front
[47:05] by me on the way down
[47:07] and so what i did was i just
[47:10] and i listened
[47:12] i thought i'm i'm i'm in the presence of
[47:14] a of an old oak tree
[47:16] so i just i just sat here i wanted to
[47:18] listen and we had a good fellowship and
[47:20] and
[47:22] of course these guys in the back brother
[47:24] dave junior and brother brian and
[47:26] brother drake my goodness they had i
[47:28] know they had a good fellowship it was
[47:30] fellowshipping all the way all the way
[47:31] down and all the way back and you know i
[47:33] just trying to focus on the road but i
[47:36] just i really appreciate brother dave
[47:38] you know because what it is is you can
[47:39] see over the time
[47:41] as brother dave there's just been a life
[47:43] that has just been lived
[47:45] and i just so appreciate that and you we
[47:48] just really really appreciate brother
[47:49] dave and i thought of him when i was in
[47:51] the middle of ministering the the second
[47:54] part there in their services and i
[47:55] thought of brother dave i actually was
[47:57] going to have brother dave and i think
[47:58] his brother jim crook from brother
[48:00] paul's and because there was a few other
[48:02] brothers there that i i know that
[48:03] they've had their lives it's just been
[48:06] all the way through the years and i
[48:07] thought what a testimony and what an
[48:08] encouragement that is to us
[48:10] because i consider myself a young man i
[48:12] know i only look about a few days beyond
[48:15] 17 but i'm still i'm a young man
[48:19] so i'd like to have brother brian come
[48:21] but in reality
[48:22] some of you probably don't know this
[48:26] this is my dad
[48:32] now some of you are looking in there
[48:34] well
[48:36] come over here stand next to me
[48:42] now if you want to know how that
[48:44] happened after i finished speaking the
[48:46] second time there you had a brother that
[48:49] that thought
[48:51] that this was
[48:52] my dad he says that's your son
[48:55] so after that just like the other day i
[48:57] texted him said happy birthday dad
[49:02] i know this is no place for jokes but
[49:05] it's okay
[49:07] i said it's okay our hearts are in
[49:09] in in the right place but
[49:11] so i just i really appreciated that you
[49:13] know so
[49:15] i guess i look younger
[49:18] it's just how it is
[49:20] all right
[49:24] thanks for the sam appreciate that
[49:25] brother chris uh
[49:27] and then speaking that yeah you can tell
[49:29] the family resemblance obviously you
[49:30] know we're
[49:31] so similar you know
[49:33] but yeah we uh i've i wanted to say
[49:35] brother cress was right about that hill
[49:37] we we me and brother dave and uh
[49:40] brother drake walked up that hill man
[49:41] that hill is no joke from the uh from
[49:44] the the mess hall up to the um
[49:47] up to the church it's a it's a bit of a
[49:49] hike but uh i just want to say i i'm i'm
[49:52] a bit of a i'm a bit of you probably
[49:53] can't tell by me being up here um i am a
[49:56] bit of an introvert which means usually
[49:58] you know i'm around people for a little
[50:00] bit and then i need a little bit of me
[50:01] time you know a little bit of private
[50:03] time you don't have to worry about any
[50:05] of that because when you're there there
[50:06] is no there is no down time so you don't
[50:09] have to worry about but what i'm trying
[50:10] to say is it didn't it didn't bother me
[50:12] you know sometimes i like to get off by
[50:13] myself but it was really wonderful that
[50:16] the presence of the lord there was so
[50:17] great from like everything we were doing
[50:19] you know it was like everything just
[50:20] kind of flowed from from from one event
[50:23] to the other and then they weren't
[50:24] kidding we did have seven seven full
[50:26] sessions we had that was that was six
[50:29] services
[50:30] and and and one uh sort of seminar from
[50:33] brother brother coffee's son
[50:35] and uh and that's not full
[50:38] blown church services with full song
[50:40] services and everything or that we
[50:42] wouldn't had nearly enough time
[50:44] um but the good the thing was they feed
[50:46] you constantly the whole time you're
[50:48] there it's it's we arrived and we ate
[50:51] and then we went to church and then we
[50:53] ate and then we went to bed and we woke
[50:54] up and we ate and then we went to church
[50:56] and we ate and then we had another then
[50:57] we ate and then we were kind of joking
[50:59] how many knows what a pavlovian response
[51:01] is the uh
[51:03] the dog you know they'd ring the bell
[51:05] and then the dog would start
[51:07] salivating because he associated i was
[51:09] like now every time every time we go to
[51:11] church and hear a sermon we're going to
[51:12] be like where's the food where's the
[51:13] food somebody bring out the
[51:15] somebody bring out the snacks yeah
[51:17] yeah it was it was good it was good food
[51:19] some people were saying oh cafeteria
[51:21] food hey for me it's just food it's just
[51:23] fine i mean you can tell from me i'm not
[51:24] too picky
[51:25] um
[51:27] but uh the one the one one thing i
[51:29] really liked was when we went into
[51:31] church like it was there was lots of
[51:34] brothers there but like everybody was
[51:36] singing it was it was almost like a man
[51:38] it was like i was in a men's choir
[51:39] almost i mean it was just voices were
[51:41] just blasting out every brother were
[51:43] singing for two brothers i mean it was
[51:45] it was wonderful oh my fortress is you
[51:48] know just so
[51:50] powerful it was so wonderful to be there
[51:52] and then the presence of the lord was
[51:53] just there from the very beginning all
[51:55] the way through
[51:56] um but everybody didn't get too super
[51:58] spiritual it was it was really kind of
[52:00] funny because we were having a great
[52:01] song service and brother brother
[52:03] fontaine and brother uh brother jack
[52:05] duff were up there singing those
[52:06] brothers can sing man there was it was
[52:08] wonderful and now some brother
[52:09] fontaine's like and we sang and singing
[52:11] and singing and singing let's sing one
[52:13] more song but the jack duff said let's
[52:15] eat
[52:17] let's eat it's
[52:19] it was it was a little past lunch time
[52:20] but everyone was so involved in it it
[52:22] was wonderful and i always say whenever
[52:24] i hear a good sermon whenever i hear a
[52:26] good service you know a good word from
[52:28] the lord i always wish i had like at
[52:30] least six months to go live that out
[52:32] because it's just so you know jam-packed
[52:35] i just lord just i think about six
[52:37] months to get that right and then we'll
[52:38] have another
[52:39] having their service but you we had like
[52:41] six six full-blown sermons and i was
[52:43] like that's like three years of
[52:44] materials and we'll be back here before
[52:47] that so i just say lord we're gonna have
[52:48] to compress that down a little bit help
[52:50] me
[52:51] live that out um
[52:53] but it was wonderful fellowship in the
[52:55] van and on the retreat and as
[52:57] with the samuel saying we met these
[52:58] brothers from africa uh brother aaron
[53:01] and brother caleb
[53:03] and uh yeah the brother was like hey
[53:04] brother i just wanted you to know i was
[53:06] really impressed with your son's sermon
[53:08] today you know because it was so good i
[53:10] was like
[53:12] my uh
[53:13] my son said yes yes mother samuel
[53:15] wonderful wonderful brother we really
[53:17] appreciate him
[53:18] and i said oh it's the beard and i
[53:20] explained it to him said oh brother i
[53:22] can never tell how old white people are
[53:24] i'm sorry i can't i can't
[53:26] so
[53:30] i was like the beard probably didn't
[53:31] help you know that probably confused me
[53:33] anymore
[53:34] but uh the the great thing was like
[53:37] there was a there was a there was a
[53:38] there was a theme all the way through it
[53:39] and i know the brothers didn't get
[53:40] together beforehand
[53:42] and and coordinate it but the theme to
[53:45] me was you know recognizing your
[53:46] authority
[53:47] as a son of god and what god's called
[53:49] you to be in this day and then how to
[53:50] use it properly i mean it was it was so
[53:54] and brother david drake you guys can you
[53:55] know it was it was it was just so it
[53:58] helped me like refocus like you know
[54:00] obviously the word of the lord is always
[54:02] coming and we're always hearing these
[54:03] things but it was like it was so focused
[54:05] on that and it helped me get really
[54:06] focused on that you know to because i
[54:08] want to be a better husband i want to be
[54:10] a better father you know for my family
[54:11] and it was it was so inspiring to me and
[54:14] i i really feel like it's made a
[54:15] difference in my life since i came back
[54:17] and it was it really
[54:19] i just been inspired i've been seeking
[54:21] lord in prayer more and things and it's
[54:22] just
[54:23] you know it's not just that camp meeting
[54:24] feeling i don't think i think it's a
[54:26] difference it's made a difference in my
[54:27] life
[54:28] and you know i know brother samuels
[54:30] mentioned he'd love to get a big bus and
[54:32] take everybody down you know all the
[54:34] brothers down i would recommend if we
[54:35] you know if if you can next year
[54:37] definitely i like i said i was a little
[54:39] hesitant because you know but it it was
[54:42] it was just such a wonderful experience
[54:44] the whole time the trip down every
[54:46] service and all the way by the time it
[54:47] was over i was like i can't believe it's
[54:48] over already i can't believe we're going
[54:50] back to real life now you know but it
[54:52] was it was a really wonderful time and
[54:54] if anybody can uh get a chance to go
[54:56] next year i recommend you do it i really
[54:57] do amen god bless
[55:07] i want to
[55:09] also make a quick announcement here as
[55:12] well
[55:15] we know that
[55:18] with the untimely passing their brother
[55:21] roel soriano
[55:23] his family they've been they've been
[55:25] suffering greatly with grief and
[55:28] someone had asked about mailing
[55:30] cards to sister chichi his wife and
[55:33] condolence and sister kim my wife she
[55:36] spoke with
[55:37] his daughter about it and she thinks
[55:38] that would be a great tremendous help
[55:41] we've just tried we've just stayed in
[55:43] contact personally
[55:46] with them and just trying to
[55:48] encourage them through this this time
[55:50] and i know that you've continued to keep
[55:52] it in prayer as they come to your heart
[55:55] you know even if you're maybe you're on
[55:57] your way to job or you're on the job and
[55:59] it just drops you remember that just
[56:01] just take them before the lord in prayer
[56:04] that god will just be with them continue
[56:06] to comfort them and
[56:09] give them the strength
[56:11] that's needed as well as the direction
[56:13] for
[56:15] the the church and the assembly that's
[56:16] there
[56:17] and so what with that in mind i'd like
[56:19] to ask if all possible if any of you
[56:21] could be
[56:23] so kind as to write any testimonies or
[56:25] interactions that you had
[56:27] with our brother along with any pictures
[56:29] to share with him
[56:31] because he's been coming here brother
[56:32] oil has been coming here for over 20
[56:34] years
[56:35] it's been this if he if you know they
[56:37] would have been able to come here this
[56:39] year
[56:40] uh it would have been 21 years
[56:43] so it'd be
[56:44] you don't know what that means
[56:47] and maybe perhaps you do i don't want to
[56:48] take anything away from anyone but it it
[56:50] means a lot just because number one you
[56:53] took that little bit of time
[56:55] you know brother brahm talks about when
[56:56] he's overseas he said he would buy his
[56:58] wife a little trinket
[57:00] okay
[57:01] and it was and he would bring that back
[57:03] and he would give it to his wife
[57:06] now it wasn't the trinket
[57:08] that sister meaty was blown away by
[57:11] it was the thought that he thought of
[57:13] her
[57:14] while he was away
[57:16] and that's when brother brown is dealing
[57:19] even with that part of it i think that's
[57:20] the thing that really it speaks
[57:23] to our hearts and our lives and
[57:24] sometimes we just get so we get caught
[57:27] up in life there's a lot of things in
[57:28] life itself but if you just could just
[57:30] take
[57:31] a little bit and we we would be happy uh
[57:33] to collect all the cards any digital
[57:36] pictures or testimonies and we'd like to
[57:39] send them all together
[57:40] because it's probably going to be about
[57:42] a month before they would even get
[57:44] uh that box we'd like to make it a
[57:47] memorial keepsake for this for sister
[57:50] chichi and and the girls
[57:53] we'd like to have any of the testimonies
[57:54] and digital pictures by next sunday
[57:57] so this went out on an email about was
[57:59] it two weeks ago or a week ago
[58:03] okay so
[58:04] just to remind you if you could just
[58:06] take that look through your pictures or
[58:08] if you have a testimony because brother
[58:10] rowell i tell you he
[58:12] brother noel just preached some
[58:13] masterpieces
[58:15] and
[58:16] i tell you what i i remember many of the
[58:19] services and one of them that i also
[58:21] remember i think was back in 2018
[58:24] the last service he preached here was
[58:25] stewards of god's grace
[58:27] but he preached the service back in 2018
[58:30] that
[58:31] to me it was phenomenal
[58:33] it's praying for the perfection of
[58:35] others
[58:36] and that was just
[58:38] it it just was tremendous there was a
[58:40] lot a lot of tremendous services and we
[58:42] appreciate the every gift that god sends
[58:44] us and so we just want to just continue
[58:47] to keep them
[58:49] in prayer
[58:50] as well and
[58:52] we just want to just look to the lord
[58:54] now
[58:55] amen maybe we could sing a song here as
[58:57] we'll stand and maybe change our
[58:59] position

[1:03:03] if you'll turn in your bibles with me
[1:03:07] i know brother brian mentioned he's the
[1:03:08] process he's working on right now and
[1:03:12] some things what he was dealing what
[1:03:14] he's mentioning it didn't allow us to
[1:03:16] get
[1:03:18] wouldn't allow us because everything all
[1:03:19] the way that transfer the notes that's
[1:03:21] all tied in
[1:03:22] uh with things so
[1:03:24] you just have to turn in your bibles at
[1:03:27] so let's go to psalm 65 verse 4.
[1:03:31] if you don't mind maybe if you
[1:03:33] someone's next to you and you can look
[1:03:35] off of their bible
[1:03:38] and i want to read just this one verse
[1:03:40] of scripture where we were
[1:03:44] drawing from
[1:03:46] last week it's good to have brother
[1:03:47] bobby sister michelle here with us as
[1:03:49] well
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:53] psalm 65 verse 4 i want to just read
[1:03:55] this verse
[1:03:57] blessed is the man whom thou chooses
[1:04:00] and calls us
[1:04:02] to approach
[1:04:03] unto thee
[1:04:06] that he may dwell
[1:04:08] in thy courts
[1:04:10] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[1:04:13] of thy house
[1:04:14] even
[1:04:16] of thy holy
[1:04:18] temple
[1:04:19] amen may god bless the word bless the
[1:04:21] reading of the word as you're being
[1:04:22] seated
[1:04:26] just to move right into this when we
[1:04:29] look at this scripture we begin to
[1:04:32] looking at this last week and i want to
[1:04:34] just really continue that point
[1:04:38] on the testimony of our lives
[1:04:40] and that also
[1:04:42] of a consecration
[1:04:44] you look here in
[1:04:46] in the scripture
[1:04:47] and how that we see that the very the
[1:04:50] choosing of god when we look at the very
[1:04:52] first part of that blessed
[1:04:54] is the man whom thou
[1:04:57] chooseth and we see that the choosing of
[1:04:59] god itself it's it's tied directly into
[1:05:03] the blessing of god that god himself
[1:05:05] would draw upon our life because
[1:05:08] remember jesus said if i
[1:05:10] be lifted up
[1:05:12] i will draw all men unto me
[1:05:15] and he is the word he's the living word
[1:05:19] and his life is what's expressed and he
[1:05:22] reveals himself
[1:05:25] by performing his word in our midst
[1:05:29] and so that's how he's known that's how
[1:05:32] he reveals his name his name is his
[1:05:34] character his character is his life and
[1:05:37] what god as he would say if i be lifted
[1:05:40] up i will draw all men unto me and that
[1:05:42] word draw is an inward impelling that
[1:05:45] takes place
[1:05:47] it's god that deals with the life let me
[1:05:49] just say this
[1:05:51] a person doesn't even have to be sitting
[1:05:54] here in the house of god for god to
[1:05:56] start dealing with her life
[1:05:58] the prodigal son was in a shape and in a
[1:06:01] place
[1:06:02] but that place or the shape he was in
[1:06:05] could not stop the angel the lord from
[1:06:07] growing right there and dealing with his
[1:06:10] life
[1:06:11] because there were some who knew where
[1:06:13] he was at they knew what he had need of
[1:06:15] and they were praying every night for
[1:06:17] him and the angel of the lord was there
[1:06:20] not only to inspire that prayer and
[1:06:23] faith in the word but the angel of the
[1:06:25] lord is the one who went there to deal
[1:06:28] with the heart of that prodigal son and
[1:06:30] begin to change his heart concerning
[1:06:33] home before he ever left the pigpen
[1:06:37] and it's the same way when you see the
[1:06:39] parallel how god bringing israel god
[1:06:41] spoke it all the way through isaiah
[1:06:43] jeremiah on and on how god would gather
[1:06:46] them back together and look where israel
[1:06:49] is back in their homeland that is a
[1:06:52] supernatural sounding of the holy spirit
[1:06:55] to draw israel into a place where god
[1:06:59] can deal with them
[1:07:01] so the choosing of god upon our life is
[1:07:05] is tied directly to the blessing of god
[1:07:09] how that god would would call us beyond
[1:07:11] the things of the world because if we
[1:07:14] can we can fellowship on this point the
[1:07:17] things of the world holds no lasting joy
[1:07:21] or pleasure
[1:07:24] it doesn't matter what a person
[1:07:26] solomon
[1:07:28] sums it up in the book of ecclesiastes
[1:07:30] over and over and over again of
[1:07:33] everything that a man could get a man
[1:07:35] could have a man could spend his whole
[1:07:37] entire life and going for this and going
[1:07:40] for that and solomon writes it in
[1:07:42] ecclesiastes 6. he said and then he said
[1:07:44] the man's not even there to enjoy it
[1:07:46] it's vanity
[1:07:49] it becomes vanity and because the things
[1:07:52] themselves i mean we we know this we see
[1:07:55] things to where uh things that are
[1:07:58] temporal or material value and it's not
[1:08:01] saying that there's not things that we
[1:08:04] may maybe that we don't want but there
[1:08:07] is as a believer we evaluate that though
[1:08:10] this thing i could have it's not sin but
[1:08:14] what's it going to require of me to have
[1:08:16] it
[1:08:17] are you with me
[1:08:19] i mean there's look let me just bring it
[1:08:20] as it comes to my mind there's no sin in
[1:08:22] having a boat all right right there's no
[1:08:24] sin and having a boat oh you know
[1:08:26] they're just no there's no sin in having
[1:08:28] a boat but if having that boat means
[1:08:31] you're gonna have to compromise on
[1:08:34] coming to the house of god
[1:08:36] i'll just work i'll just stream they've
[1:08:38] got streaming available then right there
[1:08:41] there is something that was not sin that
[1:08:43] now becomes sin
[1:08:46] are you hearing me this is why the bible
[1:08:48] says that no man who is called to be a
[1:08:51] soldier entangleth himself with the
[1:08:55] affairs of this life that he might
[1:08:58] please him who have called him that's
[1:09:00] not god's responsibility that's ours
[1:09:04] galatians 5 1 stand fast in the liberty
[1:09:08] wherewith christ hath made you free and
[1:09:10] be not entangled again in the yoke of
[1:09:14] bondage
[1:09:17] there's a lot that could be said with
[1:09:18] that part of it but i think that when we
[1:09:20] can draw from the scripture that we have
[1:09:22] to we have we are mindful we not have to
[1:09:25] be we are mindful that there's things
[1:09:27] that we have we need the discernment of
[1:09:30] the holy spirit in our life that's why
[1:09:32] we need to come to the house of god you
[1:09:34] might say brother samuel i've got
[1:09:36] discernment but wait a minute here we
[1:09:38] need the word of the living god to come
[1:09:40] down hebrews 4 12 says he comes down as
[1:09:43] a discerner that's a judge of the
[1:09:45] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:09:47] because sometimes our thoughts are dead
[1:09:49] on but god has to come down like he did
[1:09:52] to the prophet and reveal if you
[1:09:54] continue to go this way this is what's
[1:09:56] going to happen
[1:09:57] but it's your choice
[1:10:00] but you see this is why
[1:10:02] in our lives that we can never ever ever
[1:10:06] take anything for granted we want our
[1:10:08] lives to be evaluated by not only
[1:10:10] evaluated by the word of god but to live
[1:10:13] by the
[1:10:14] inspiration of god through every part of
[1:10:17] our life let me just say it like this if
[1:10:19] there's something that i can do and
[1:10:21] jesus can't do it then i can't do it
[1:10:24] right i don't want to do it if there's
[1:10:26] something that if i can say well i can
[1:10:28] do this if jesus can't be my buddy and
[1:10:30] be there with me i don't want it
[1:10:32] if it's something that's going to get
[1:10:34] between me and jesus i don't want it
[1:10:36] because he means more than life to me
[1:10:44] this life holds no lasting joy
[1:10:47] or pleasure
[1:10:48] but the choosing of god has its tied to
[1:10:51] the blessing of god it calls us into the
[1:10:54] place that we were ordained to dwell in
[1:10:58] let me say it like this to where we
[1:11:00] become a fully manifested son or
[1:11:02] daughter of god not a son or daughter of
[1:11:04] god by knowledge
[1:11:07] but one that's expressed
[1:11:09] not one that oh sons of god do this
[1:11:11] daughters of god do this oh sons but it
[1:11:14] comes to a place to where there are
[1:11:16] times that yes as the word comes to
[1:11:18] bring correction and direction in our
[1:11:20] life there's a maturing and a groin but
[1:11:23] we're not doing it by an intellectual
[1:11:25] thought
[1:11:26] it must come from an intellectual
[1:11:28] thought to a subconscious moving and
[1:11:31] that takes the birth of the holy ghost
[1:11:34] in our life to where it's no longer us
[1:11:37] walking by our intellects or our mind
[1:11:40] our reasoning but now it is the mind of
[1:11:43] christ that is pulsating within our life
[1:11:46] we have a advocate we have an absolute
[1:11:50] we have a source that we're able to go
[1:11:53] to and say lord what do you see in this
[1:11:59] praise
[1:12:01] you see and there's nothing that'll
[1:12:02] satisfy
[1:12:04] that calling in our
[1:12:06] lives for
[1:12:09] a just there's nothing that will satisfy
[1:12:11] it because david said
[1:12:12] a deep call to deep at the noise of thy
[1:12:14] water spout nothing will satisfy it but
[1:12:17] a full manifestation in our lives
[1:12:21] and to see that even a life that hungers
[1:12:24] after god let me just say this to you
[1:12:27] a person can look at another person's
[1:12:29] life or as you might said here today and
[1:12:31] you might say
[1:12:33] man i want what they got
[1:12:35] i want hey there's life setting here
[1:12:36] right now today where that life has been
[1:12:38] expressed and that's why they're here
[1:12:41] i want what this person gots but let me
[1:12:43] just tell you something who put that
[1:12:45] desire in you to want that
[1:12:50] you can say well i've got a lot of other
[1:12:52] things in my life but my point is who
[1:12:54] put the desire in you to want that kind
[1:12:57] of a lie amen
[1:12:59] i'm telling you you didn't put that into
[1:13:01] you
[1:13:02] your family didn't put that into you all
[1:13:05] the teaching you sat under didn't put
[1:13:07] that in you that came from the mind of
[1:13:11] god
[1:13:12] it was in you the whole time that's why
[1:13:15] there is no joy no satisfaction no
[1:13:19] pleasure in the things of this world
[1:13:25] because you weren't meant to fit into
[1:13:26] this world
[1:13:28] you're not of this world you always
[1:13:31] belong to god
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:34] you always were a son and daughter of
[1:13:36] god but you had to get to a place to
[1:13:39] recognize this is who i am i'm not the
[1:13:42] son of james and pat brown i am the son
[1:13:46] of almighty god
[1:13:50] and this is where the scripture said
[1:13:52] blessed are they
[1:13:53] that do hunger and thirst after
[1:13:56] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:13:59] you can't get to hungering after god and
[1:14:02] god not be moved
[1:14:04] you can't get thirsty and god not be
[1:14:06] moved it's god who put that hunger there
[1:14:09] god who put that thirst there the word
[1:14:11] comes to stir it up we're living in the
[1:14:14] season and the hour this is your moment
[1:14:16] this is your time this is my time
[1:14:19] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:14:22] thirst after righteousness
[1:14:25] they shall be filled the holy ghost is
[1:14:27] not a maybe
[1:14:28] it's a certainty amen
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:34] praise the lord so remember as we look
[1:14:37] here in the word of god in hebrews 10
[1:14:41] the spirit of god
[1:14:43] he comes to draw upon our heart
[1:14:45] that we'd come through the right
[1:14:47] approach remember blessed is the man
[1:14:50] whom thou chooses
[1:14:53] and calls it to approach unto thee
[1:14:57] now
[1:14:59] approach
[1:15:00] means everything right
[1:15:03] you heard how brother brother brown will
[1:15:04] go through this he said there's a way
[1:15:06] that you approach he said like a king
[1:15:09] you know i might call
[1:15:11] i might call you buddy and everything
[1:15:12] else you know and that's just kind of
[1:15:13] just a term you know i can't help that
[1:15:15] that came along you know
[1:15:17] but i don't i don't walk up to a king
[1:15:18] and say hey bud
[1:15:20] what's going on
[1:15:22] hey
[1:15:22] buddy
[1:15:24] i mean you know how you call people
[1:15:25] buddy it ain't even hey buddy
[1:15:28] you don't walk up to a king that way
[1:15:30] matter of fact brother bam said there
[1:15:31] were times where they had to take out
[1:15:32] the cuffs out of his trousers
[1:15:35] there was an approach
[1:15:37] even to a judge brother brown says it
[1:15:39] like this he said you don't go up to a
[1:15:40] judge and say hey judgey
[1:15:46] hey pal
[1:15:48] he said you referred to him as your
[1:15:50] honor
[1:15:51] there's a right approach you see let me
[1:15:53] say this to you god is so interested in
[1:15:56] the fulfillment of his word that he
[1:15:58] won't leave it in the hands of a man but
[1:16:02] god will send his word it's god
[1:16:05] fulfilling his word and it's god
[1:16:07] revealing himself to be the only
[1:16:10] provided approach
[1:16:14] it takes it out of church denomination
[1:16:17] it takes it out of the hands of man
[1:16:18] that's what's messed it up down through
[1:16:21] the church ages is when it got into the
[1:16:23] hands of man but when it's in god's
[1:16:27] hands
[1:16:28] let me just tell you like this look at
[1:16:30] your hands look at your hands when you
[1:16:33] see your hands you look at and say
[1:16:35] that's my hands if you're born of the
[1:16:37] spirit of god those are god's hands
[1:16:41] he's the vine we're the branches
[1:16:44] and god uses you as subjects to witness
[1:16:48] to deliver this word and to express this
[1:16:51] word amen amen
[1:16:53] it's a right approach
[1:16:55] and so you know this is why and i'm just
[1:16:59] to lay this in very clearly that the way
[1:17:02] of approach as paul would write here in
[1:17:05] hebrews 10 19 he says having therefore
[1:17:08] brethren boldness to enter into the
[1:17:10] holiest by the blood of jesus
[1:17:15] now
[1:17:16] we realize that the blood of jesus as it
[1:17:19] ran from that body it went back into the
[1:17:22] ground it broke down into the elements
[1:17:25] and became part of the earth
[1:17:27] i'm talking about the literal blood
[1:17:30] but the blood was shed to pay the price
[1:17:34] but what what was on the inside of it
[1:17:37] was the life
[1:17:39] and because the blood has made the
[1:17:41] purchase
[1:17:42] that the life can now come back to you
[1:17:45] and i and draw us bringing us out of the
[1:17:48] pawnshop
[1:17:49] back into christ
[1:17:53] but the right approach because you know
[1:17:55] a lot of times the the term the blood of
[1:17:57] jesus is just thrown around
[1:18:00] but you see this is why that god would
[1:18:03] have it wrote in his word
[1:18:05] uh where down through the ages like
[1:18:07] brother brahms said the the theme of
[1:18:09] every apostle the theme of every
[1:18:11] ministry was the baptism of the holy
[1:18:14] ghost
[1:18:15] was getting under the blood and this is
[1:18:17] why in this hour when there's a lot of
[1:18:19] other things that got into the sight of
[1:18:21] the church it has got the church in such
[1:18:24] a sight to where she believes she's all
[1:18:27] right and the bible says she's naked and
[1:18:30] doesn't know it that nakedness she might
[1:18:33] be fully clothed on the outside but
[1:18:35] she's naked because her soul the
[1:18:38] unconverted nature stands out in the
[1:18:41] presence of god
[1:18:43] is that right
[1:18:45] so the blood of jesus there had to be a
[1:18:47] call in this hour that would tell us
[1:18:49] look away unto jesus look away from all
[1:18:53] of the isms and doctrines and this and
[1:18:56] that and you know a person you know even
[1:18:58] as it rolls up around our ranks well you
[1:19:00] got to see it the way i see it you got
[1:19:02] to see it the way i see it i think like
[1:19:04] one sister told you know a person you
[1:19:06] know off on their own little belief and
[1:19:08] he got on that person you know and said
[1:19:10] hey you didn't bring your glasses to
[1:19:12] service and she said i forgot them
[1:19:14] tonight and she said here you can use
[1:19:16] mine she said no thank you because i'm
[1:19:18] afraid i'll see things the way you do
[1:19:22] god bless that sister
[1:19:25] because you see they get into an eye and
[1:19:27] he gets into a channel gets into a camp
[1:19:29] gets into a seclusion but nowhere
[1:19:32] nowhere should there be anything that is
[1:19:34] exalted or lifted up above the name of
[1:19:37] jesus christ
[1:19:40] satan hates that he's tried to tear it
[1:19:42] down through the ages of the deity of
[1:19:45] jesus christ of christ becoming
[1:19:47] preeminent in the life of the believer
[1:19:50] he's tried to diminish the blood as a
[1:19:52] past happening instead of the holy ghost
[1:19:55] coming and making it real that we were
[1:19:57] in the mind of god and god came down for
[1:20:00] you and i he paid the price and now the
[1:20:03] holy spirit has come to seek you out and
[1:20:06] bring you back to himself
[1:20:08] you can't separate the blood from the
[1:20:10] word
[1:20:13] because it was the word that was made
[1:20:16] flesh
[1:20:17] and bled for us
[1:20:19] is that right that's scripture
[1:20:21] so in order that he did that in order to
[1:20:24] open up the way now hebrews 10 19 having
[1:20:27] therefore brethren boldness somebody say
[1:20:29] boldness
[1:20:30] that's a confidence
[1:20:32] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[1:20:34] of jesus it was one time death
[1:20:37] to go behind that veil it was death
[1:20:40] only one could go behind there
[1:20:43] is that right representing there was a
[1:20:45] time coming there would be one who would
[1:20:47] go back in there once and for all he
[1:20:50] wouldn't oh my he would make a way but
[1:20:52] brother you make one trip there you'll
[1:20:55] never be the same
[1:20:56] [Applause]
[1:21:00] oh my boldness to enter into the holiest
[1:21:03] by the blood of jesus by a new and
[1:21:06] living way which he hath consecrated for
[1:21:09] us through the veil that is to say his
[1:21:12] flesh and having a high priest over the
[1:21:15] house of god remember we collectively
[1:21:17] collectively are members of his body a
[1:21:21] part of the house of god we are stones
[1:21:24] that have been assembled by the grace of
[1:21:27] god brought to a place that now god
[1:21:30] might inhabit the his people as paul
[1:21:33] would write we have been made a
[1:21:35] habitation of god through the spirit
[1:21:41] individually
[1:21:43] we are a dwelling place as well
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:48] and to see
[1:21:49] when god let me just say this and move
[1:21:51] on
[1:21:52] when god has come
[1:21:54] individually
[1:21:56] then let me tell you something your
[1:21:58] little stone alone
[1:22:00] is not the tabernacle of god
[1:22:07] god didn't say let them make me
[1:22:08] tabernacles
[1:22:10] we're going to preach now boy
[1:22:12] all right what are you saying well i get
[1:22:14] my own little private thing and i pull
[1:22:16] off this way
[1:22:17] i get my own little prank the revelation
[1:22:19] of jesus christ will stay together
[1:22:24] it wields us together it unites us
[1:22:26] together how can the revelation of jesus
[1:22:29] christ be in his heart be in our heart
[1:22:31] and us away from one another it can't
[1:22:34] happen that way it drives us together
[1:22:37] because it's the love of god pulsating
[1:22:40] in our heart for one another
[1:22:42] [Applause]
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:46] praise the lord
[1:22:49] man that was free that's like an extra
[1:22:52] prize in the crackerjack box
[1:22:56] but here's what i look let me just deal
[1:22:57] with this here just a moment and drop
[1:22:59] this and let's move on in hebrews 10 22
[1:23:02] the next verse says
[1:23:04] let us draw near
[1:23:07] with a true heart in full assurance of
[1:23:09] faith having our hearts sprinkled from
[1:23:12] an evil conscience
[1:23:14] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:23:17] this this is the result paul is letting
[1:23:19] the believers know this way that's been
[1:23:21] made for you
[1:23:23] and not only been made for you but now
[1:23:26] through this way
[1:23:28] it is opened up that then the life
[1:23:30] itself can be changed in other words
[1:23:33] where there is condemnation there cannot
[1:23:35] be faith
[1:23:37] but see now the spirit of god comes to
[1:23:39] deal the word of god comes to deal with
[1:23:43] condemnation comes to deal with sin
[1:23:45] comes to deal with guilt comes to deal
[1:23:47] with doubt it comes to deal and begin to
[1:23:50] expose that old nature that's there that
[1:23:53] this is not my perfect will but i am
[1:23:57] your perfect will god reveals himself as
[1:24:00] the will for our lives
[1:24:04] is that right so now when the word is
[1:24:06] being expressed now god is is beckoning
[1:24:09] to you and i let's draw near
[1:24:11] with the full assurance let's let's move
[1:24:14] in to this place let's operate here as
[1:24:17] sons and daughters of god
[1:24:19] you see we grow and i don't want to
[1:24:21] labor on this point this morning but
[1:24:23] when we come into this place with god we
[1:24:26] come into the place of adoption as sons
[1:24:29] but we still have to grow and mature
[1:24:32] brother brahms just said it very simply
[1:24:33] and works as faith express he talked
[1:24:35] about how he grew in his own ministry he
[1:24:38] said if you're not growing something's
[1:24:40] wrong
[1:24:43] hate to say it but sometimes the way we
[1:24:45] grow is learning from our past mistakes
[1:24:48] i mean for those of us who have them you
[1:24:50] know
[1:24:53] i mean for you know for the rest of you
[1:24:54] know they got angel dust instead of
[1:24:56] carpet you know but for the rest we
[1:24:58] learn from that
[1:25:00] we grow from that
[1:25:03] so you know brother batman is dealing
[1:25:04] with this consecrated life
[1:25:07] and he's talking about how a person he
[1:25:09] said when they would ever
[1:25:11] take their life
[1:25:13] a man ever takes his life out of these
[1:25:15] other places and into that consecrated
[1:25:18] place
[1:25:19] with christ
[1:25:21] now brother branham i read you the quote
[1:25:23] last week where brother baby says too
[1:25:25] many are are playing in the courts yet
[1:25:28] now i don't want you to i know you
[1:25:31] wouldn't but let's just put it very
[1:25:33] simple
[1:25:33] he's not talking about us playing
[1:25:35] kickball
[1:25:37] he's not you can even talk about where
[1:25:39] people are not well they're not being
[1:25:40] silly
[1:25:42] the word playing is the opposite or a
[1:25:46] contrast sincerity
[1:25:49] let me just let me say here now
[1:25:51] brother brown deals with it you can be
[1:25:52] sincere deadly and sincerely wrong
[1:25:56] see i'm we're interested about being
[1:25:59] sincere to the word and the presence of
[1:26:02] god i want you to be very clear here i'm
[1:26:04] not talking about sincerity of where we
[1:26:07] do this and we do that and we measure up
[1:26:09] to your standard and then we measure up
[1:26:10] to your standard then buddy we're
[1:26:12] sincere that's not what i'm talking
[1:26:14] about
[1:26:15] we're talking about sincerity to god
[1:26:18] amen when god deals with our life we can
[1:26:21] say forgive me lord i see my
[1:26:23] shortcomings i see my weakness i see
[1:26:26] that lord lord jesus let your word be
[1:26:29] formed in my life that area that's a
[1:26:32] weakness what are you doing you're
[1:26:33] inviting the blood to cover it and
[1:26:36] inviting god to deal with it amen
[1:26:40] you can't get in without repentance
[1:26:45] and you'll never live a very victorious
[1:26:47] life without repentance
[1:26:50] and you can't repent if you don't allow
[1:26:52] the word to speak to you and evaluate
[1:26:54] your life but when the word comes it
[1:26:57] evaluates our life then we can say like
[1:26:59] paul i die daily we don't even have to
[1:27:02] be in the house of god but our lives now
[1:27:05] daily monday tuesday wednesday it's the
[1:27:08] word we're hearing there's a reflection
[1:27:10] going on and saying lord build me up
[1:27:12] here lord build me out here lord cause
[1:27:15] me to increase here lord give me
[1:27:17] strength here why because you are in
[1:27:19] contact with god you have been brought
[1:27:21] back into the place that adam fell from
[1:27:25] where god is speaking lip to ear to you
[1:27:30] you're his child
[1:27:32] his son or his daughter
[1:27:36] i tell you repentance is an awful big
[1:27:38] thing
[1:27:40] repentance ain't blaming something on
[1:27:42] mommy or daddy or anybody else
[1:27:46] i'll tell you you don't take a hound dog
[1:27:47] to sniff through that kind of stuff
[1:27:50] right
[1:27:51] well you know i wouldn't be like this if
[1:27:53] anyone saw it that ain't repentance
[1:27:56] that's called worldly sorrow paul
[1:27:58] identified it what it is sometimes where
[1:28:00] people get in a sorrowful condition and
[1:28:03] the only thing they're sorry about is
[1:28:04] because they're sorry
[1:28:07] some of you catch that
[1:28:10] but it's not godly sorrow because godly
[1:28:12] child worketh
[1:28:14] worketh worketh worketh why because it
[1:28:17] worketh it's god who deals with your
[1:28:19] heart and through that godly sorrow it
[1:28:21] works out a life that then it's a fruit
[1:28:24] that expresses the work that started in
[1:28:26] the heart that's what we want don't we
[1:28:30] oh ungodly sorrow
[1:28:32] see it's repentance you see this is why
[1:28:35] brother brown makes a very a very simple
[1:28:36] statement in god hiding and simplicity
[1:28:38] out of new new
[1:28:40] albuquerque new mexico he said when you
[1:28:42] fully surrender you'll fully come in
[1:28:44] right
[1:28:45] right but the same i repented i don't
[1:28:47] have the holy ghost you haven't fully
[1:28:48] repented
[1:28:50] when you fully repent the holy ghost
[1:28:52] will come
[1:28:54] when you come to come into a place to
[1:28:56] where it's a full surrender i don't want
[1:28:59] these things no more i don't want this
[1:29:01] life anymore lord i want you see it
[1:29:03] moves from these things to i want you
[1:29:06] it's a full surrender there's got to be
[1:29:08] a repentance let me tell you something
[1:29:10] you can hear all this preaching of the
[1:29:12] word but let me tell you something if it
[1:29:14] don't bring conviction in your life and
[1:29:16] bring you to a place of repentance
[1:29:18] you're missing it
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] i'm not saying that
[1:29:24] we're all without the holy ghost you
[1:29:25] understand what i'm saying you're mature
[1:29:27] enough to catch that
[1:29:28] what i'm dealing with is how the word it
[1:29:30] ought to be dealing and bringing
[1:29:31] conviction to our hearts and our lives
[1:29:33] there's a responsibility that we have
[1:29:35] when the word is dealing with us and
[1:29:37] this is why
[1:29:38] that when paul would deal with it you
[1:29:40] know and brother brown was talking about
[1:29:42] this playing it deals with from playing
[1:29:44] to living
[1:29:46] you know
[1:29:48] i'm just not i'm not interested in
[1:29:50] playing i know you're not either i'm not
[1:29:52] interested in in playing around with the
[1:29:54] man with the message i'm interested in
[1:29:56] living it amen i'm interested in this
[1:29:59] word becoming flesh in my life
[1:30:02] amen this is why it's a time to be
[1:30:05] serious
[1:30:06] it's a time to be focused in it's a time
[1:30:08] to be consecrated more than ever before
[1:30:11] let me tell you something god in this
[1:30:12] age knew what it was going to take for
[1:30:13] you and i yeah brother brown said we
[1:30:15] said people don't even have hardly
[1:30:17] enough faith to heal a toothache and
[1:30:18] we've got to have faith to get out of
[1:30:20] here
[1:30:21] now there's only one thing that will
[1:30:22] bring that faith the key of g the key of
[1:30:24] c your favorite song won't bring faith
[1:30:28] oh brother samuel i'm i'll tell you what
[1:30:30] i can't wait to get in a good service
[1:30:31] man the power of god is moving around
[1:30:33] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:30:36] the word of god the power of god comes
[1:30:38] on the scene to demonstrate the word
[1:30:43] is that right to deal with our life then
[1:30:46] our lives might be further changed from
[1:30:48] glory unto glory unto glory so how god
[1:30:51] himself would provide for us in this
[1:30:54] hour knowing what we have need of
[1:30:56] and god has he sent the message
[1:30:59] according to what he promised he would
[1:31:01] do in this hour then i think it behooves
[1:31:04] us with everything brother brand would
[1:31:05] say it like this i think it was in
[1:31:07] spiritual food and due season he says if
[1:31:10] he is that north star if he is he says
[1:31:13] our absolute he says if he is our
[1:31:16] ultimate if he is her all and all he
[1:31:18] said then we
[1:31:19] we it deserves for us to give everything
[1:31:23] to him our whole lives and let our whole
[1:31:26] lives revolve around you say what do you
[1:31:28] mean by that let me tell you something
[1:31:30] when the slaves were down there and they
[1:31:32] were in bondage down there in the south
[1:31:34] and they had different ones that would
[1:31:36] go down there and the underground
[1:31:38] railroad passed through this area and
[1:31:39] many of the places and remember when
[1:31:41] they went through there what was that
[1:31:43] they were following they were following
[1:31:45] the north star the north star is what
[1:31:48] directed their movements then if it was
[1:31:51] a cloudy day there was still the moss
[1:31:54] and things that they could detect on the
[1:31:56] trees but they knew head north they knew
[1:31:58] kept going keep going this way and
[1:32:01] follow the path of the star let me tell
[1:32:03] you something in this hour we are not in
[1:32:06] darkness this is a gloomy day it's a day
[1:32:09] of grace our greatness where a man
[1:32:11] doesn't know right from wrong but the
[1:32:14] promise said in the evening time there
[1:32:17] will be light
[1:32:19] that's no longer prophecy we are living
[1:32:22] in that and we are the manifestation
[1:32:26] that our light has come
[1:32:28] this evening life has come to our lives
[1:32:35] what do you mean to where we're not
[1:32:37] we're not tossed about looking right
[1:32:41] we have found him
[1:32:44] found him yeah he found us
[1:32:48] i have found him whom my soul loveth
[1:32:51] you see
[1:32:52] to be zeroed in in this hour this is why
[1:32:55] when brother branham would speak of and
[1:32:57] i'm just going to have to kind of move
[1:32:59] through it he deals with the dwelling
[1:33:00] place as we
[1:33:02] looked at it there
[1:33:03] in our drawing of how that
[1:33:05] god dwelling in the holiest of holies
[1:33:09] and how that within that
[1:33:12] you know has he dwelt in the tabernacle
[1:33:15] god dwells in you as his tabernacle
[1:33:17] brother baby says we must make this
[1:33:19] place
[1:33:20] a dwelling
[1:33:21] not an outer court place or a first holy
[1:33:23] place
[1:33:24] but we must live with god
[1:33:26] in the holiest of holies a consecrated
[1:33:30] hidden life alone
[1:33:32] quiet with god
[1:33:34] now i want you to think of it make this
[1:33:35] place a dwelling place amen so brother
[1:33:38] brahma said don't make it an outer court
[1:33:41] don't make it a holy place
[1:33:45] what's by the brand what's brother i'm
[1:33:46] talking about
[1:33:48] it's got to be a new birth on the inside
[1:33:51] right
[1:33:52] it can't just be in the outer court let
[1:33:54] me just say about the outer court do we
[1:33:56] need the drawing again
[1:33:57] anybody need the drawing or we got it
[1:34:00] i'm not asking that because i like
[1:34:01] playing with it i don't it's not a plan
[1:34:02] i did that with the young people for
[1:34:04] years but
[1:34:06] the outer court
[1:34:08] you know a person can come in here and
[1:34:09] they don't repent
[1:34:11] and they could see that they can see the
[1:34:13] healing
[1:34:15] they could see miracles they can even
[1:34:17] enjoy the word man that's some good
[1:34:18] preaching
[1:34:19] and not even repented
[1:34:21] in the outer court that's right but
[1:34:23] they've come in
[1:34:24] and because what it is they feel like
[1:34:26] i've done my duty they feel pretty good
[1:34:28] i mean who don't feel good when you get
[1:34:29] out of the house of god i mean even if
[1:34:31] you've got a high tannin i mean you feel
[1:34:32] good you know
[1:34:34] he kept in contact with me i mean you
[1:34:35] know
[1:34:37] it's good to be in the presence of god
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:40] but you see the outer court itself these
[1:34:42] are the types of things when brother
[1:34:43] brown tells us being in that outer court
[1:34:45] a person can come into an outer court
[1:34:47] and then the very next day or a moment
[1:34:50] later or whatever more they're making a
[1:34:52] bad business deal
[1:34:54] you would look at their life and in the
[1:34:55] midst of their peers or maybe on your
[1:34:57] facebook page let me tell you something
[1:34:59] who you are in private is who you really
[1:35:01] are
[1:35:02] you might you can't put on a show you
[1:35:04] can't come in here and put on a show who
[1:35:06] you are you are when nobody's watching
[1:35:10] my goodness boy this is a it's a
[1:35:12] pipeline you know we're not interested
[1:35:14] god's not interested in patching stuff
[1:35:16] up i hate veneer
[1:35:19] i hate veneer
[1:35:21] there's things where you know my wife
[1:35:22] and i and there's things i had veneer
[1:35:24] stuff everybody know i'm talking about
[1:35:25] yeah you know the stuff i want to tell
[1:35:27] you what country it comes from you
[1:35:28] probably know but it's this stuff just
[1:35:30] like they take of you know it's like
[1:35:32] cardboard yeah and they just glue the
[1:35:34] stuff on there
[1:35:37] you forget a cup of water on it one time
[1:35:39] you'll know it's been there
[1:35:42] peel right back on you right why it
[1:35:44] can't take the change in temperature
[1:35:47] preach with me now
[1:35:48] it can't take it
[1:35:51] it just bends up and it comes unglued
[1:35:53] and everything else you see god doesn't
[1:35:55] make veneer christians
[1:35:58] where we're just with man everything
[1:36:00] right on the outside but samuel you've
[1:36:02] seen veneer i've seen veneer christians
[1:36:05] we've seen veneer we all have seen
[1:36:06] veneer christians because when things
[1:36:08] start coming down look what comes out
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:13] you begin to realize there's that solid
[1:36:15] oak core that's veneer
[1:36:18] the experience of god is not a veneer
[1:36:20] experience it's a real experience to
[1:36:22] wear when the word deals with our life
[1:36:25] buddy it might set us on fire but
[1:36:27] there's real grains on the inside
[1:36:30] well there's real grains just like the
[1:36:32] grains in this word that can say yeah
[1:36:35] lord be it unto me lord you're exactly
[1:36:38] right lord i'm in the wrong word i'm
[1:36:41] failing here but lord i'm looking to
[1:36:43] your grace to give me strength to rise
[1:36:45] up
[1:36:47] hallelujah
[1:36:51] you see because
[1:36:52] brother brown would even deal with it in
[1:36:54] this part of it where he would talk
[1:36:55] about
[1:36:56] of that and that inner that holy place
[1:36:59] and talk about that holy place that
[1:37:00] brother bram calls
[1:37:02] these areas the adolescent age and then
[1:37:05] the message hidden life
[1:37:06] he said well we're fussing you know he
[1:37:08] said some people they come into that of
[1:37:10] where the seven candlesticks are
[1:37:12] he said now they've got enough light to
[1:37:14] debate and argue
[1:37:16] or criticize
[1:37:19] this church don't got it this church got
[1:37:20] it this church
[1:37:23] forgive me but who made you the absolute
[1:37:25] all right
[1:37:27] you're right amen
[1:37:30] you see it becomes enough light but you
[1:37:32] see look that ain't the way that ain't
[1:37:34] the reason that light is coming that
[1:37:36] ain't the reason that ain't the purpose
[1:37:38] of that light coming off that seven
[1:37:39] golden candle stick the purpose of that
[1:37:41] light was to show reflect out into the
[1:37:45] outer cord in the labor where the labor
[1:37:48] is reflecting that cross and it's to
[1:37:51] point you that start here come through
[1:37:54] consecration and go all the way
[1:37:58] you see the light the star the star is
[1:38:00] not drawing you to itself come on now
[1:38:03] the messengers will never draw you to
[1:38:05] themselves but the messengers are to
[1:38:08] give light to open up and expose the way
[1:38:12] that god himself is revealing into the
[1:38:15] holiest of holies
[1:38:21] praise the lord
[1:38:24] i tell you friends you you think it
[1:38:26] ain't you think things ain't confusing
[1:38:27] you sit around and you talk you talk to
[1:38:29] i you know he talked to different ones
[1:38:31] it's been relatives and stuff like that
[1:38:33] and here they've got individuals
[1:38:35] that no longer
[1:38:37] are sitting in their church
[1:38:39] and they and they look at it well they
[1:38:41] spoke in tongues yeah i know they had it
[1:38:44] that's what they say they're confused
[1:38:46] though
[1:38:47] i'm not saying i'm calling them confused
[1:38:49] i'm saying what they are they said
[1:38:51] they're puzzled they don't understand i
[1:38:53] know they got it because they spoke in
[1:38:55] tongues and yet they divorced this
[1:38:57] person and went off with this person and
[1:38:59] we're doing this or whatever more but
[1:39:01] you see what it is that pathway it was
[1:39:04] not the true pathway into the new birth
[1:39:08] gifts are fine but remember how brother
[1:39:10] man tells us gifts are not an infallible
[1:39:13] sign of the new birth
[1:39:15] but he said gifts can identify that
[1:39:18] god's presence is there working a gift
[1:39:21] but it's not an infallible sign that a
[1:39:23] person has been born again are you
[1:39:26] hearing me thank god for the message of
[1:39:28] the hour this is evening time light that
[1:39:31] evening time light was not to cast
[1:39:34] people out it was to open up the way and
[1:39:36] to break back the clouds of darkness
[1:39:39] where satan was wanting to keep people
[1:39:41] back from a real genuine life in jesus
[1:39:45] christ no wonder brother ram could say
[1:39:47] if god gave me the opportunity and the
[1:39:50] choice and said william branham i'll
[1:39:51] give you all these great gifts or i'll
[1:39:54] fill you with the holy ghost with that
[1:39:56] of the love of god burning in your soul
[1:39:58] he said i would tell god i'll take the
[1:40:01] love of god over any gift
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:06] gifts will fail
[1:40:10] and a person relying on a gift as their
[1:40:12] holy ghost will fail
[1:40:16] come on prince
[1:40:17] within that is not the evidence of the
[1:40:19] holy ghost that's why brother randall
[1:40:21] said in satan's eating don't watch the
[1:40:23] holy ghost so much in demonstrations you
[1:40:26] watch it in action he's talking about
[1:40:29] the life amen
[1:40:34] amen said it like this talking about
[1:40:36] coming into those courts
[1:40:38] he says it's better that we come easy
[1:40:41] and we take our time and see where we're
[1:40:43] going
[1:40:44] praise the lord
[1:40:45] did you hear me amen
[1:40:48] i'll say that to anybody no matter where
[1:40:50] you're at here this morning
[1:40:52] no matter whether young person middle
[1:40:54] old or whatever more
[1:40:56] i tell you look very carefully clearly
[1:40:58] how god has been bringing this out
[1:41:00] if the desire is lord i want the holy
[1:41:03] ghost
[1:41:04] there is a provided way
[1:41:07] you repent
[1:41:10] baptized in the name of jesus christ we
[1:41:12] shouldn't get tired of hearing this
[1:41:14] that's right amen right
[1:41:16] hey man this is i'll tell you what this
[1:41:18] is like right here it's just like when
[1:41:19] we were getting home from tennessee and
[1:41:21] anytime else that i've come home from a
[1:41:23] trip maybe i flew into cleveland i tell
[1:41:25] you what brother joey as soon as we
[1:41:27] start getting close to 58 or jager i'm
[1:41:29] about ready to tell him let me out i'll
[1:41:31] run the rest of the way home i can't
[1:41:33] wait to get to my house
[1:41:36] it's home
[1:41:38] when you go down through that look at
[1:41:39] the whole mile look at this person oh my
[1:41:41] they've put a tree over there i'm
[1:41:42] looking why that's where i live that's
[1:41:44] my home this pathway to a child of god
[1:41:47] we don't ever get tired of that because
[1:41:49] we know there's lives that haven't
[1:41:51] experienced yet but we know what it's
[1:41:53] like to experience a real repentance
[1:41:56] being baptized in the name of jesus
[1:41:58] christ and receiving the gift of the
[1:42:01] holy ghost
[1:42:03] we know what that's about we are
[1:42:04] ambassadors brother branham called us
[1:42:06] like this he said we are messengers
[1:42:09] angels of the covenant with christ
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:15] so it becomes our responsibility so you
[1:42:17] say brother samuel what do you say i'm
[1:42:18] saying that don't get into such a place
[1:42:22] where
[1:42:22] we're looking way off here you got to
[1:42:24] take care of first things first there's
[1:42:25] an approach
[1:42:29] oh glory to god i i felt it but have you
[1:42:31] repented if you still got bitterness and
[1:42:33] malice and everything else in your heart
[1:42:35] and in your life and their sin and you
[1:42:36] haven't repented the holy ghost won't
[1:42:37] come on that you might have an
[1:42:39] experience that he comes upon you you
[1:42:42] might feel goosebumps you might feel i
[1:42:44] don't care whatever you might say but
[1:42:46] brother here's what brother bam tells us
[1:42:47] when it all comes down to it he said a
[1:42:49] person can say i seen a light i felt a
[1:42:51] wind i did this he said that's all i'm
[1:42:53] good i'm not going to say you didn't he
[1:42:55] said but what kind of life do you live
[1:42:57] after you get up from there
[1:43:00] that's what matters
[1:43:02] we're not after sensations and feelings
[1:43:06] i like them but we're not living by a
[1:43:08] sensation or a feeling as nothing more i
[1:43:11] like than the presence of god i believe
[1:43:13] the children of god ought to be the
[1:43:15] happiest children and people there are
[1:43:18] on the face of the earth because we've
[1:43:20] got everything we've got the greatest
[1:43:22] treasure and the greatest riches as paul
[1:43:25] would call the holy ghost paul would say
[1:43:27] it's the unspeakable gift of almighty
[1:43:30] god we ought to be the happiest people
[1:43:33] in the world
[1:43:42] you see it's a responsibility that we
[1:43:44] have
[1:43:45] in our lives daily
[1:43:48] we're living in an age we're living
[1:43:50] listen friends don't get caught up in
[1:43:52] and don't say well
[1:43:53] so and so they're not no no you forget
[1:43:55] about so-and-so
[1:43:56] well i'll tell you what if if so forget
[1:43:59] about them
[1:44:00] we have to take responsibility
[1:44:03] for our own lives
[1:44:14] brother samuel i thought my pastor was
[1:44:16] ordained to see me through
[1:44:18] ordained to see you through
[1:44:20] not carry you that's right
[1:44:23] oh lord i'll tell you what man the
[1:44:24] pipeline was coming down
[1:44:26] listen friends you know my heart i'm not
[1:44:28] here to step on people's toes but that's
[1:44:31] not what a pastor is
[1:44:32] a pastor's not come to carry you but a
[1:44:35] pastor to see you through what is it
[1:44:38] because without a vision the people
[1:44:41] perish you know what that word vision
[1:44:43] means in proverbs it means without a
[1:44:45] vision and that word means nakedness
[1:44:48] without leadership in the hebrew
[1:44:51] god provided real vision is leadership
[1:44:56] and real leadership will see to it that
[1:44:59] you're not naked
[1:45:02] we have a responsibility i've got a
[1:45:03] responsibility before god amen
[1:45:06] we have to take inventory of our lives
[1:45:09] just like you know many of you work on
[1:45:10] jobs in different places somebody's got
[1:45:12] to take care of the inventory
[1:45:14] i mean you know brother aaron if they
[1:45:16] walk out there and say hey we're going
[1:45:17] to go cut this bridge today
[1:45:20] the guys go out there and cut it because
[1:45:22] i'd imagine it's your job there's
[1:45:23] somebody has to take care of inventory i
[1:45:25] might be looking at the guy this morning
[1:45:27] but somebody's got to take care of
[1:45:28] inventory you can't just be saying you
[1:45:30] know what i forgot to get more of them
[1:45:31] diamond tip blades
[1:45:35] if
[1:45:36] i don't know if you are the guy or not
[1:45:37] but we're going to say you are today
[1:45:40] if he forgets to do that let me tell you
[1:45:42] something right now that boss or that
[1:45:45] ceo is going to be wanting to take it
[1:45:47] out of his paycheck because them
[1:45:48] contractor is going to hold them to it
[1:45:50] and say you made a commitment right here
[1:45:52] you know they're always looking for free
[1:45:53] money anyhow
[1:45:55] not just contractors but a lot of people
[1:45:56] are yeah
[1:45:59] and it don't stimulate nobody
[1:46:01] free money don't stimulate nobody it
[1:46:03] just makes people more lazy well
[1:46:05] but you see you got to take inventory
[1:46:08] is that right
[1:46:09] we have to take inventory we have to
[1:46:11] take inventory of our lives right now
[1:46:13] god is the watchman the holy spirit he
[1:46:15] knows what's coming down the pipeline
[1:46:17] and that's why we must take inventory by
[1:46:20] the word don't look at it let me tell me
[1:46:22] preach to you now don't look at it like
[1:46:24] well i should know this and i know this
[1:46:26] and i know don't get that adolescent
[1:46:28] stage don't get that know-it-all
[1:46:30] attitude but let god cleanse you if you
[1:46:32] come to a spot brother samuel we've
[1:46:34] received the message of the hour but the
[1:46:36] message of the hour comes under the
[1:46:38] leadership of the holy spirit it don't
[1:46:41] make you on an island buy off to
[1:46:42] yourself and neither is god saying that
[1:46:45] you're something that you're not even
[1:46:46] intelligent that's not what god is
[1:46:48] saying but god is recognizing we are in
[1:46:51] a spiritual warfare a spiritual battle
[1:46:55] and satan is doing his best to try to
[1:46:57] get to your life and cool you off and
[1:47:00] hinder the working of god but god's
[1:47:02] desire is his life would be pushed and
[1:47:06] lived through our lives
[1:47:09] this is why we need the discernment of
[1:47:11] the holy spirit
[1:47:22] consecration let me just
[1:47:24] dropping this in this term
[1:47:27] consecration
[1:47:29] isn't doing
[1:47:30] works
[1:47:34] or
[1:47:35] more works
[1:47:39] in order to make yourself righteous
[1:47:41] that ain't consecration
[1:47:43] but what consecration is is yielding
[1:47:46] your life in obedience to the word of
[1:47:49] god by first of all
[1:47:52] agreeing with him
[1:47:53] amen
[1:47:55] amen means so be it
[1:48:01] and then
[1:48:03] seeking
[1:48:04] until that word is made real to us
[1:48:08] see when it's when it's revealed
[1:48:09] remember there's three stages in christ
[1:48:11] is the mystery
[1:48:13] god's desire
[1:48:15] to reveal his word first yes
[1:48:18] then after it's been revealed
[1:48:20] then it becomes preeminence
[1:48:23] then the third fold
[1:48:25] is where the kingdom is restored as it
[1:48:28] was in eden
[1:48:29] that not only is taking place as far as
[1:48:32] over the expanse and here we are in a
[1:48:34] part of that timeline but that's how the
[1:48:36] word comes into power in our lives
[1:48:40] it don't just drop from revelation to
[1:48:43] become power
[1:48:45] but revelation that's why brother baby
[1:48:47] says we need to pray for revelation more
[1:48:50] than anything
[1:48:53] because with revelation comes prevailing
[1:48:56] power prevailing power what first of all
[1:48:59] we need prevailing power to work here
[1:49:02] to get rid of our thoughts i'm not just
[1:49:04] talking about the new birth i'm talking
[1:49:06] about in our everyday individual life
[1:49:09] because we still carry seed taste feel
[1:49:12] smell here conscious memory affection
[1:49:14] you get it we carry all that and this is
[1:49:17] why we need the prevailing power because
[1:49:19] revelation will uncover it'll reveal and
[1:49:23] when that revelation is revealing what
[1:49:25] does it do it's power that's being
[1:49:27] released as we can allow it to work in
[1:49:29] our lives that word will come preeminent
[1:49:32] and once it becomes preeminent then it
[1:49:34] begins spoken through our lives and now
[1:49:37] that kingdom is restored and you're
[1:49:39] seeing a son of god being manifest like
[1:49:42] it was back in the garden of eden and
[1:49:43] like it was through the lord jesus
[1:49:45] christ and like it has been down through
[1:49:47] every age and here in the end time amen
[1:49:52] you see that's why after the service is
[1:49:54] over it's not just man that was good
[1:49:56] that's amen glory to god i'm not listen
[1:49:58] friends i'm not talking down to you but
[1:50:00] i think we need to look at these things
[1:50:02] a little bit more that it's more when
[1:50:04] we're coming together here my lord how
[1:50:07] brother andrew brought that out how god
[1:50:08] used him to bring it out he told me in
[1:50:10] the back office before he came out he
[1:50:11] said i'm gonna preach something simple
[1:50:13] if that's okay lord if that's simple
[1:50:15] help me
[1:50:18] you see everything that god speaks to
[1:50:20] our life when we say it's simple when
[1:50:22] god gets a hold of it because we begin
[1:50:24] to realize what's in our hands this is
[1:50:26] how i felt when we looked at that there
[1:50:28] on thursday night i felt like the guy
[1:50:30] who handed me the key ring to my impala
[1:50:33] when i bought it back in 2012. i didn't
[1:50:35] know what i didn't know what an auto
[1:50:36] start was i'd heard of auto start heard
[1:50:38] of all those things before but i didn't
[1:50:40] know what it looked like so i'm looking
[1:50:42] at the key fob and they're drawing up
[1:50:43] the final paperwork and i'm sitting down
[1:50:45] there and i thought one was that button
[1:50:47] for
[1:50:49] right
[1:50:50] i know what i was for
[1:50:52] right i mean i knew what luck can unlock
[1:50:53] and i knew with the trunk but man i
[1:50:55] wonder what the i don't know what that's
[1:50:56] all about
[1:50:57] finally i asked the guy but joe i had to
[1:50:59] ask a guy this guy he come over i said
[1:51:01] hey
[1:51:02] what is this button right here for right
[1:51:04] it's here let me show you so he took it
[1:51:07] and demonstrated the power amen
[1:51:10] that was already in my hands
[1:51:12] are you hearing me
[1:51:13] [Applause]
[1:51:15] are you hearing me
[1:51:17] that's why brother branham would tell
[1:51:18] the church he would say he said you say
[1:51:20] i ain't got enough faith he said you've
[1:51:22] got enough faith he said you just need
[1:51:23] to know how to operate it
[1:51:26] that's right are you with me now brother
[1:51:28] brown could take a clear back and deity
[1:51:30] of jesus christ and bring it down to let
[1:51:32] us know he said the deity of jesus
[1:51:34] christ it's right there present in your
[1:51:36] life to live an overcoming life what
[1:51:39] that man did he revealed to me what that
[1:51:42] button was all about you know because
[1:51:43] there was a pattern you couldn't just
[1:51:44] push that button at least on my key fob
[1:51:46] and it start up you had to press lock
[1:51:49] twice
[1:51:50] and then hit that button yeah don't mind
[1:51:52] telling your brother josh i appreciated
[1:51:54] that when i was standing there at the
[1:51:55] school when it was cold days i could
[1:52:01] but you see i didn't know what i had
[1:52:03] but once i found out what i had somebody
[1:52:06] had to make known to me what was already
[1:52:09] in my possession
[1:52:12] i'm just going to have to go ahead and
[1:52:13] preach an hour
[1:52:15] there was already as god would declare
[1:52:17] it right here that god was already here
[1:52:21] god was already here but god had to have
[1:52:24] an instrument a yielded vessel according
[1:52:28] to his word to begin to reveal what
[1:52:30] satan had taken from the church and
[1:52:33] wanted to rob from the people of god
[1:52:35] that had to be one who would stand there
[1:52:38] as a vessel and reveal to the church of
[1:52:41] the living god of what belongs to us
[1:52:44] what we have the potentials that it
[1:52:46] might become reality
[1:52:50] i'm not talking about me or you having
[1:52:53] lines of discernment i'm talking about
[1:52:55] of having an access to a living god
[1:52:59] where there is a real holy ghost who
[1:53:01] comes to the innermost place in our life
[1:53:04] and he dwells in that area of our life
[1:53:06] and he influences every court
[1:53:11] is that your desire
[1:53:12] lord influence every court
[1:53:15] amen
[1:53:16] of my life
[1:53:17] you see this is why
[1:53:20] in corinth in second corinthians 3 when
[1:53:22] paul would write of this
[1:53:25] and he would deal with how that
[1:53:27] and in verse one i just got to read this
[1:53:29] do we begin again to commend ourselves
[1:53:31] or need we as some others epistles of
[1:53:33] commendation to you
[1:53:35] or letters of commendation from you
[1:53:38] ye are our epistle written
[1:53:41] in our hearts
[1:53:43] known
[1:53:45] and read
[1:53:47] of all men
[1:53:49] now what paul is saying
[1:53:52] that light paul goes on the next chapter
[1:53:54] that light that shined in the beginning
[1:53:59] and brought forth
[1:54:00] order where there was chaos that same
[1:54:03] light
[1:54:04] has shined into our hearts
[1:54:08] but not for ourselves only it came to
[1:54:11] illuminate
[1:54:12] the purpose the plan the word that now
[1:54:16] that same word it would be reflected to
[1:54:20] a generation to a people of god who
[1:54:23] would come into the same illumination
[1:54:28] of jesus christ
[1:54:32] you're an epistle written
[1:54:34] in our hearts
[1:54:35] known and read of all men
[1:54:37] so
[1:54:39] simply put in layman's term
[1:54:41] our life
[1:54:44] is to be
[1:54:46] the expression
[1:54:48] of what brother branham preached
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:54] just as much as abraham spoke under
[1:54:56] inspiration and the lamb
[1:54:58] came into manifestation are you hearing
[1:55:01] me
[1:55:02] the same lamb that was slain in genesis
[1:55:04] 15 when there was needed a confirmation
[1:55:08] that same lamb shows up in genesis 22.
[1:55:11] in this hour how does that lamb come
[1:55:14] into existence he don't have to go to
[1:55:16] calvary once again but the lamb comes
[1:55:18] into view in revelations 5 because
[1:55:22] there's a strong angel on the earth
[1:55:24] that is proclaiming who is worthy and
[1:55:28] now that lamb comes into view in where
[1:55:31] where does he come into view not just in
[1:55:33] the life of the prophet but he comes
[1:55:35] into view in the life of his redeemed
[1:55:38] body his pride and there is a uniting
[1:55:41] that takes place as bride and groom and
[1:55:44] never said we were the lion's wife we're
[1:55:47] the lamb's wife
[1:55:51] but don't push me satan
[1:55:56] because there's a boldness on the inside
[1:55:58] but there's a lamb that comes under the
[1:56:00] word
[1:56:01] when my husband asks for me it's a lamb
[1:56:04] nature amen
[1:56:09] don't better say no how small that might
[1:56:11] be a wolf
[1:56:12] you don't wanna
[1:56:14] you know what a wolf
[1:56:17] don't show your teeth when the words
[1:56:18] come and just show your heart
[1:56:21] when stephen was preaching they
[1:56:25] they gnashed on him with their teeth
[1:56:27] but there were those who had a heart
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:32] for as much as you are manifestly
[1:56:34] declared to be the epistle of christ
[1:56:37] ministered by us
[1:56:39] written not with ink but with spirit of
[1:56:40] the living god not in tables of stone
[1:56:42] but in fleshly tables
[1:56:44] of the heart
[1:56:46] so it's coming to be veiled
[1:56:49] by the word of god now to be veiled by
[1:56:52] the word is
[1:56:53] you know you could
[1:56:54] you could cut this bible up and this is
[1:56:56] all the word of god in printed form
[1:56:58] right
[1:56:59] and you could actually take this and
[1:57:01] make some make a garment out of it and
[1:57:02] say man i'm veiled by the word but that
[1:57:04] ain't the veil he's talking about
[1:57:06] because you see the reason israel could
[1:57:09] not see because they had a veil on their
[1:57:12] heart
[1:57:14] now that veil is a traditional veil
[1:57:17] it's a sin veil
[1:57:19] and see a sin veil
[1:57:21] that's why the bible tells us that we
[1:57:23] must be born again without being born
[1:57:24] again we can never see
[1:57:26] the kingdom of god
[1:57:28] is that right so god comes to deal with
[1:57:31] the veil that's over our life
[1:57:33] he makes himself known why he's one of
[1:57:36] our kind
[1:57:37] are you with me he's a kinsmen redeemer
[1:57:40] he's one of our kind
[1:57:41] so there's an attraction that takes
[1:57:43] place because when he comes remember he
[1:57:45] delivers his word paul said that epistle
[1:57:48] that's written in our hearts and that
[1:57:49] now that word that god has revealed
[1:57:52] now is spoken out and it's to now come
[1:57:55] into manifestation in the lives of the
[1:57:57] people you know what god is declaring
[1:57:59] when god sends this word this message to
[1:58:02] a generation god is declaring there is a
[1:58:04] people on earth
[1:58:06] right now that are this word and will be
[1:58:09] and is the very manifestation of this
[1:58:12] word it ain't about what you see or you
[1:58:15] don't see it simply be it unto me
[1:58:18] according to thy word
[1:58:21] and god comes to deal with a sin veil
[1:58:24] how does he deal with it by the word
[1:58:27] veil
[1:58:28] he comes the word itself it comes and it
[1:58:31] makes itself known and it deals with
[1:58:33] that calling us because that sin bill is
[1:58:35] a barrier
[1:58:37] are you hearing me it's a barrier
[1:58:38] it's a tradition
[1:58:40] that sin veil remember it's a
[1:58:42] traditional veil
[1:58:48] that's i've got us i'm going to say some
[1:58:49] things as it's coming to me when brother
[1:58:51] branham preaches the message the men the
[1:58:53] services on demonology demonology
[1:58:55] religious realm demonology on the
[1:58:57] physical realm or physical realm and
[1:58:59] religious realm and enticing spirits
[1:59:02] when brother brown deals with that of
[1:59:03] how that demons themselves demons don't
[1:59:05] have no problem hiding behind spiritual
[1:59:08] gifts
[1:59:10] brother brahman talking to people in
[1:59:11] entirely spirit they were they get real
[1:59:13] spiritual oh i'm going to start fasting
[1:59:15] and everything else but god isn't
[1:59:17] calling you to that god's calling you to
[1:59:19] a new birth
[1:59:21] come on now whether it's
[1:59:23] any gift that can be lined up this is
[1:59:25] why our life is not based upon any gift
[1:59:29] my life as an overcomer is not based on
[1:59:32] the gift to preach
[1:59:35] come on now
[1:59:36] it's not based on that at all this is
[1:59:39] the gift of god working through the gift
[1:59:42] of god i'm talking about the gift of god
[1:59:44] is that soul on the inside that came
[1:59:48] from god that is the predestinated
[1:59:51] channel of god and god sends a word like
[1:59:55] he did through john the baptist to
[1:59:57] prepare the way get all the junk out of
[1:59:59] the way so that the word can come to its
[2:00:01] rightful position
[2:00:04] and when the word comes to its rightful
[2:00:06] position it don't write in weak and
[2:00:08] mingly and mangy the word rides in with
[2:00:11] power in our lives
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:14] and he exhibits himself as the mighty
[2:00:16] conqueror
[2:00:20] so we become veiled by the word
[2:00:24] tonight brother brown says it like this
[2:00:26] i've got to read this he said tonight
[2:00:28] we're getting he says there's raising up
[2:00:29] among us groups
[2:00:31] carnal comparisons
[2:00:33] somebody try to act like it
[2:00:35] and live a different life
[2:00:37] can drink and smoke
[2:00:38] women can live most any way they want to
[2:00:40] like the world and stay home and watch
[2:00:41] television and things of the world and
[2:00:43] call themselves pentecostals
[2:00:45] let me just update that
[2:00:47] they can do all those things and still
[2:00:48] call themselves message believers
[2:00:53] brother samuel that's awful straight
[2:00:55] you might he might hate me now but
[2:00:56] you'll love me on the other side
[2:01:01] you see this is why when brother brown
[2:01:02] when he preaches the message knoweth
[2:01:04] that not
[2:01:05] brother brahma he know is it not god of
[2:01:06] this evil age these are the messages
[2:01:08] where brother bram deals with how you
[2:01:10] can have the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:01:11] every hour of your life and still be
[2:01:12] lost and go to hell
[2:01:14] because the holy ghost has come to
[2:01:15] quicken the word and make it live
[2:01:18] not to bring sensation
[2:01:20] amen come on now all right brother brown
[2:01:22] said the blessings we receive outside of
[2:01:24] christ he said they're only temporal
[2:01:26] they fade away but any blessing inside
[2:01:28] of christ that brings you in it's
[2:01:30] lasting
[2:01:31] hey ask moses if the blessing wasn't
[2:01:32] lasting when he stood face to face with
[2:01:34] pharaoh the blessing he got from the
[2:01:36] burning bush it held out
[2:01:39] pharaoh stood right there and said
[2:01:41] no
[2:01:43] not gonna let him go
[2:01:45] moses didn't say uh-oh
[2:01:49] speed oh no network signals down what am
[2:01:52] i going to do now what is this i thought
[2:01:55] i no
[2:01:56] you know where the word was at the word
[2:01:57] wasn't here
[2:02:01] the word wasn't here in the outer court
[2:02:02] it wasn't here in the holy place
[2:02:05] the word was down here
[2:02:08] and moses he came to that spot and moses
[2:02:10] he came to god and he said lord
[2:02:13] in egypt thou sentest now that my people
[2:02:16] your people lord you let's set me down
[2:02:18] here and now this is what pharaoh said
[2:02:23] you see the difference
[2:02:25] it was an anchor on the inner court
[2:02:29] those things arose that he couldn't
[2:02:30] understand those things happened and it
[2:02:33] didn't go according to how he had it all
[2:02:35] planned out
[2:02:37] come on now
[2:02:39] it didn't happen that way but he had an
[2:02:41] anchor and absolute to go back to and
[2:02:44] said god he knew he met god
[2:02:47] he knew he met god so he could go right
[2:02:49] back to the sacred sound let me tell you
[2:02:51] something sacred sands it ain't your
[2:02:53] prayer closet somewhere there might be a
[2:02:55] place in mind where you could say i
[2:02:57] believe it was right here but the sacred
[2:02:59] sands is the presence of god where you
[2:03:02] made your life a place that god could
[2:03:05] come down and have a meeting with you
[2:03:08] brother you pack that everywhere you go
[2:03:11] you might be in the hardest of trial the
[2:03:14] hottest of the desert but the sacred
[2:03:16] sands
[2:03:18] of the new birth are right there with
[2:03:19] you in your life
[2:03:21] [Applause]
[2:03:23] and you can stand there with boldness
[2:03:25] and say god i can't make sense of none
[2:03:27] of this
[2:03:30] lord i had a lot of plans but i realized
[2:03:32] those were my plans and they weren't
[2:03:34] your plans
[2:03:36] it takes a real son and daughter of god
[2:03:38] to be able to stand there and humble
[2:03:40] themselves in the midst of their plan
[2:03:41] come on we've all been there
[2:03:43] god teres guess what we'll be back there
[2:03:45] again
[2:03:46] why because we're still walking in this
[2:03:48] flesh we don't want to be back there but
[2:03:50] there's times in our life that we have
[2:03:52] to be able to say that you know what i'm
[2:03:54] here lord these were plans that i had
[2:03:57] but this was not your plans
[2:03:59] lord amen
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:03] this is where you begin to pray
[2:04:05] yes lord
[2:04:06] your ways are higher than my ways
[2:04:09] but i think my ways are good right now
[2:04:10] lord
[2:04:13] i said okay
[2:04:15] go ahead
[2:04:17] you see you're a son and daughter of god
[2:04:20] listen to me
[2:04:21] god is the son and daughter of god
[2:04:24] he doesn't put us in the head like
[2:04:25] brother joey that's right you don't come
[2:04:27] down oh i'm going to get you joy
[2:04:29] if you go that way i'm going to get no i
[2:04:30] didn't
[2:04:34] we're living in a month of booze
[2:04:36] boo and haunted houses and haunted this
[2:04:38] and god don't come down the house of god
[2:04:40] need to be a spooky place
[2:04:42] it's a place of liberty
[2:04:45] where the word comes down and deals with
[2:04:47] our life
[2:04:48] now there's things that god can deal
[2:04:50] with our life and once in a while he
[2:04:52] might have to let us dangle over hell a
[2:04:54] little bit to show us the weak links in
[2:04:57] our life
[2:04:58] but you know what he does that with
[2:05:00] loving kindness he does that because he
[2:05:02] loves us and he really cares about us
[2:05:09] see it takes these things out of us here
[2:05:10] this is why when brother brown talks
[2:05:12] about that remember he talks about he
[2:05:13] says brother baum says it like this he
[2:05:15] said you take a woman he said here she
[2:05:17] is he said she she's she's uh uh she
[2:05:20] spoke in tongues
[2:05:22] man felt the holy ghost come on he said
[2:05:24] and still get out there and wearing
[2:05:25] shorts and stripping down and pants and
[2:05:27] everything else
[2:05:28] and brother brown says like this
[2:05:30] you try to tell her she don't got the
[2:05:32] holy ghost
[2:05:35] why they're basing it on experience
[2:05:38] instead of the word that's why brother
[2:05:40] branham tells us in the church age book
[2:05:41] he said away he said the reason the
[2:05:43] problem that's in the church is because
[2:05:46] too much has been based on experience he
[2:05:48] said we've got to get away from
[2:05:50] experience and back to the word
[2:05:53] he wasn't telling us that we don't need
[2:05:54] to have an experience
[2:05:57] are you hearing me let's balance this
[2:05:58] out he wasn't saying we don't need to
[2:06:00] have an experience but he's saying
[2:06:02] you've got to have an experience that's
[2:06:04] deeper than the outer court deeper than
[2:06:06] the inner court it's got to be a word
[2:06:09] birth a word experience and that's what
[2:06:13] the baptism of the holy ghost brings
[2:06:15] it brings a life not a life that's
[2:06:17] perfect in itself but a life that'll
[2:06:19] submit itself to the word a life that
[2:06:22] the spirit of truth will lead in god
[2:06:24] into all truth
[2:06:27] amen
[2:06:28] you might not never speak in tongues you
[2:06:30] may never be one that prayed for
[2:06:32] somebody and god uses that you pray for
[2:06:34] them and they are healed but you know
[2:06:36] what
[2:06:37] they don't got nothing to do with your
[2:06:38] soul
[2:06:40] i'm not making a lot of all that i thank
[2:06:41] god for every gift but i'm going to tell
[2:06:43] you there is no gift that we're to rest
[2:06:46] our experience on
[2:06:52] i feel like just preaching a little bit
[2:06:54] more
[2:06:55] just as this inspiration of the picture
[2:06:57] coming together this is why brother
[2:06:58] branham preaches a message led by the
[2:07:01] spirit of god he tells us in the message
[2:07:02] of prisoner he says come next sunday i'm
[2:07:05] going to preach a message he said
[2:07:06] because there's some reason he said that
[2:07:08] people he said you see him just kind of
[2:07:09] sluggish he said we ought to be on fire
[2:07:11] with the message that god sent us he
[2:07:13] said they're kind of wandering around
[2:07:14] and sluggish he said god has given me a
[2:07:16] message to deal with that next weekend
[2:07:18] now brother brown he turns right around
[2:07:20] and i believe he preaches the message i
[2:07:22] think it is he that is in you or he
[2:07:24] careth for you and brother brahms turns
[2:07:25] into that message and he starts
[2:07:27] preaching about hybrid food he takes it
[2:07:29] from a reader's digest thing and he
[2:07:31] talks about how the hybrid fruit is
[2:07:33] breaking down even the natural abilities
[2:07:35] in the body of women to reproduce in
[2:07:37] minds and whatever more lord have mercy
[2:07:39] just look around us today
[2:07:41] is that right
[2:07:42] but then he goes into dealing with
[2:07:44] situations of what he's seen where he
[2:07:46] said you had preachers that coming off
[2:07:47] the airplane hey i remember my daddy
[2:07:49] told me about a well-known evangelist
[2:07:50] and different one that was called out
[2:07:52] even on tape and things getting off the
[2:07:53] plant getting off the plane over here in
[2:07:55] cleveland couldn't even walk down the
[2:07:56] steps they were so drunk
[2:07:58] well-known man
[2:08:00] prayed for people people getting off the
[2:08:02] cots
[2:08:04] he was a man i'll tell you i i won't
[2:08:06] quote that because i really don't want
[2:08:07] to call the man's name out but you know
[2:08:09] you of how brother branham even revered
[2:08:11] this man's ability to preach
[2:08:14] that's right but brother around him
[2:08:15] deals with he didn't call the man out on
[2:08:16] tape but brother ram's dealing with
[2:08:18] things he said the reason he said you
[2:08:20] find things in people's life he said
[2:08:21] here's what it all comes down to they're
[2:08:23] really not repenting
[2:08:27] you can't bypass repentance
[2:08:31] you can't just say well i agree with the
[2:08:32] message the devil agrees with this
[2:08:34] message
[2:08:35] the devil if i can say it like this
[2:08:37] agree with it the devil knows it's the
[2:08:39] truth
[2:08:41] you can send down and ask the devil he's
[2:08:42] just messing the truth he'll tell you
[2:08:44] it's burnt my heart many times it's
[2:08:47] kicked me out of homes it's kicked me
[2:08:49] out of lines i know the power in this
[2:08:51] message you don't got to convince the
[2:08:53] devil brother he's a believer
[2:08:55] [Applause]
[2:09:00] come on you know i'm referring to in the
[2:09:02] book of james
[2:09:05] the devil believes and he trembles
[2:09:09] the truth
[2:09:14] brother said they're trying to
[2:09:15] impersonate a genuine
[2:09:16] right it's not been revealed to him i
[2:09:18] want you to listen this this quote
[2:09:20] listen to this it's not been revealed to
[2:09:22] him when it is revealed
[2:09:24] it's glorious
[2:09:29] when it's revealed
[2:09:34] so what changes not the word
[2:09:37] us
[2:09:40] us not the word
[2:09:42] us
[2:09:42] how does that change
[2:09:45] sin veil is broken
[2:09:48] and now it's a word veil
[2:09:51] and the only thing we can see and desire
[2:09:52] to see
[2:09:54] is jesus
[2:09:57] one thing we can look back across your
[2:09:59] life and say
[2:10:00] wow
[2:10:01] lord you had your hand on my life
[2:10:03] all the way amen even when i wasn't even
[2:10:06] seeking you and i thought i was just
[2:10:07] kind of doing my own thing and this and
[2:10:09] that but
[2:10:10] god you've watched over me
[2:10:18] amen devil would like to take in your
[2:10:20] life many times
[2:10:23] i look back and when i was a little boy
[2:10:24] i can't even explain this you know
[2:10:26] that's why the devil gets after you
[2:10:28] that's why he was after you because
[2:10:29] there's something somewhere along the
[2:10:31] line
[2:10:32] there was something about your life
[2:10:33] where god shows interest
[2:10:35] that's right
[2:10:36] as a little boy
[2:10:38] here i was in a barn
[2:10:40] and i was up there i crawled up in that
[2:10:42] barn and i
[2:10:45] bought up the ladder went up that barn
[2:10:47] you know and there was a hole
[2:10:49] it went perfectly cut it was jagged
[2:10:51] that's one thing i remember the jagged
[2:10:53] hole what we do them those cattle those
[2:10:56] steers would come in there
[2:10:58] and they would come in there and what
[2:10:59] we'd do is we'd kick that straw i wasn't
[2:11:01] allowed up there
[2:11:04] but one day
[2:11:05] i crawled up there
[2:11:08] next thing i know i wake up
[2:11:11] taking straw out of my hair
[2:11:14] i was on the ground
[2:11:16] it was way up in the air
[2:11:18] you say what was it
[2:11:20] my life couldn't be taken right then
[2:11:22] that's right i was a little guy my life
[2:11:24] couldn't be taken your life couldn't be
[2:11:26] taken
[2:11:28] because why there's a greater life that
[2:11:30] had to come to expression
[2:11:32] inside
[2:11:33] of your life
[2:11:35] god never lost track of you never lost
[2:11:37] sight
[2:11:38] amen praise god
[2:11:41] when it's revealed it's glorious and
[2:11:42] something takes that out of you
[2:11:45] when you walk in there
[2:11:47] and you become a veil
[2:11:49] he said now you see moses veil he was
[2:11:51] the living word to the people and today
[2:11:54] the people that are veiled
[2:11:56] are the same thing
[2:11:58] he says they are written epistles read
[2:12:00] of all men
[2:12:01] not a new
[2:12:03] epistle
[2:12:08] over and over oh man with different ones
[2:12:10] oh brother brandon when god opens those
[2:12:12] seven thunders it's going to give you
[2:12:14] something that's not even written in the
[2:12:16] book but brent said that sound 99
[2:12:20] he said but
[2:12:22] god won't go outside of his word
[2:12:26] amen
[2:12:29] then of course we had you know some oh
[2:12:30] these those seven thunders they were
[2:12:32] this they were what the scripture says
[2:12:37] write it not all right
[2:12:39] it's a message
[2:12:41] but it's not the seven thunders are not
[2:12:43] wrote out it's the voice of god
[2:12:46] that sounds
[2:12:52] is that right
[2:12:53] and so we're not a new epistle in other
[2:12:55] words
[2:12:57] god didn't come to add books to the
[2:12:59] bible
[2:13:02] well my book who are you well i'm the
[2:13:04] i'm the second i'm i'm the second book
[2:13:06] of acts
[2:13:08] if it's a book of acts part two then
[2:13:10] it's a continuation of acts part one
[2:13:14] amen
[2:13:16] he won't dress different act different
[2:13:18] talk differently
[2:13:19] hello now if that vine not if the church
[2:13:23] if the vine ever puts forth another
[2:13:25] branch
[2:13:27] it'll write a book of acts behind it
[2:13:31] amen
[2:13:32] glory be to god so we're not our own
[2:13:34] little epistle well i'm my own little
[2:13:36] pistol
[2:13:37] i got my own doctrine
[2:13:41] i got my own doctrine i got my own
[2:13:43] favorite quotes how important to you
[2:13:47] oh you're your own epistle
[2:13:50] but you see
[2:13:52] not a new epistle
[2:13:54] an epistle
[2:13:56] that's already been written
[2:13:59] where was that epistle written
[2:14:04] in the mind of god
[2:14:06] before the foundation of the world
[2:14:09] it's
[2:14:10] called lamb's book of life
[2:14:14] and that epistle is that
[2:14:16] that part that you and i play
[2:14:19] in this book
[2:14:21] the lamb's book of life listen there's
[2:14:24] many people in the world listen and this
[2:14:27] is not a knock there's many people had
[2:14:28] there not been a fall people wouldn't
[2:14:30] there many people wouldn't even been
[2:14:31] here
[2:14:32] but there is a book of life
[2:14:34] and then there's the lamb's book of life
[2:14:37] the lamb's book of life remember when
[2:14:39] the mighty angel descended he had a
[2:14:42] little
[2:14:43] book
[2:14:44] open
[2:14:46] this message is calling
[2:14:48] to the lamb's
[2:14:50] book of life
[2:14:52] that's why i don't get offended if
[2:14:54] somebody else says well i don't know i
[2:14:55] really can't see that i'm not offended
[2:14:57] that they can't see it because listen
[2:14:58] there are names that are on the book of
[2:15:01] life that are not ordained to see
[2:15:04] the lamb's book of life
[2:15:07] and i thank god for that
[2:15:10] oh yeah
[2:15:11] oh yeah i'll shout with him on that
[2:15:14] i'm having a problem with that a bit
[2:15:16] but a new epistle
[2:15:19] not a new
[2:15:20] epistle
[2:15:22] because you see if you got your own
[2:15:24] epistle well then you can have your own
[2:15:25] church
[2:15:27] right because every church got there
[2:15:30] doctrine
[2:15:31] boy
[2:15:33] this is why the holy ghost is needed
[2:15:37] by the new birth
[2:15:40] it keeps a life christ centered
[2:15:42] amen
[2:15:44] so things aren't gotten off in pet
[2:15:46] doctrines hearing pet doctrines there
[2:15:48] and pet doctrines there and it becomes
[2:15:50] the first church of
[2:15:53] whatever the last name is
[2:15:56] see we're not a new epistle
[2:15:58] you know we're not running down the
[2:16:00] bookstore hey you got a new tab
[2:16:02] you got a new tab what tab do you need i
[2:16:04] need the tab brian jr that's what i need
[2:16:09] the tab
[2:16:11] not a new epistle we're the one who's
[2:16:13] been
[2:16:14] written
[2:16:15] already
[2:16:17] but you see just like anything that's
[2:16:18] been written
[2:16:20] there comes time
[2:16:23] to loosen
[2:16:25] the voice
[2:16:26] that's contained
[2:16:27] in the writing
[2:16:30] and god provides
[2:16:33] a diamond chip
[2:16:35] to come and begins to come upon the
[2:16:37] record of our life oh not the record of
[2:16:40] our past
[2:16:41] that's done away with amen
[2:16:43] but now it begins to bring out the real
[2:16:46] record of our life that goes clear back
[2:16:48] to the mind of god
[2:16:50] amen
[2:16:51] hallelujah
[2:16:53] let me finish reading this
[2:16:55] not a new epistle but the epistle that's
[2:16:57] been written made manifest it's those
[2:17:00] who believe the word
[2:17:02] and the promise of this day
[2:17:04] that god is pouring out his spirit upon
[2:17:05] all flesh
[2:17:07] and that
[2:17:09] is written epistles
[2:17:10] when a person tries to carnally
[2:17:12] impersonate that it backfires your life
[2:17:15] shows
[2:17:17] what you are
[2:17:22] you read this in closing here
[2:17:24] i want you just to just listen this
[2:17:26] is how other message influenced how many
[2:17:28] know that our life is influencing
[2:17:29] somebody
[2:17:31] you you may not even have say brother
[2:17:32] samuel i am witness to so and so
[2:17:34] your life is the best witness
[2:17:36] it's the best
[2:17:39] the brahman said i've many times preach
[2:17:41] funerals
[2:17:42] he said i never try to say too much
[2:17:44] about the person that's passed on me
[2:17:46] because there's no need of saying it
[2:17:49] i mean probably everyone has been to
[2:17:50] funerals for
[2:17:54] people sitting there in the honestly
[2:17:58] but you see what's happened it becomes
[2:17:59] so common
[2:18:00] this is why people don't take things
[2:18:02] serious right yeah that's right
[2:18:05] because they had a preacher get up there
[2:18:06] and paint up that that old boy like man
[2:18:08] he was he was an angel
[2:18:11] and knowing that guy was a rascal and he
[2:18:13] at least as far as known he never got
[2:18:16] right with god
[2:18:18] this is why a funeral you preach it
[2:18:21] before you ever pass that's right
[2:18:25] is that right
[2:18:26] i mean somebody don't get up at a
[2:18:28] funeral room i'll tell you what they
[2:18:29] were so faithful your life says whether
[2:18:31] that or not that's right
[2:18:33] are you hearing me
[2:18:35] the people he says the life the man has
[2:18:38] or woman whatever it might be has lived
[2:18:41] the life they live will speak louder to
[2:18:43] the congregation than anything i could
[2:18:45] say about them that's right are you
[2:18:47] hearing me now anything i could say
[2:18:49] about him what's brother i'm saying
[2:18:50] brother brand i'm saying is that
[2:18:53] one of my quotes ain't enough
[2:18:55] you've got to have it inside yes
[2:18:59] you've got to have the voice of god
[2:19:01] inside
[2:19:02] that speaks
[2:19:04] concerning your life
[2:19:08] to the congregation more than anything i
[2:19:09] could say about them i would never
[2:19:10] change their opinion their life told
[2:19:13] what they were
[2:19:14] and then we never know just what we're
[2:19:17] doing what influence what we're doing is
[2:19:18] having upon others the bible said we're
[2:19:20] written epistles right of all men that
[2:19:22] is your life reads your life reads so
[2:19:25] loud to the public
[2:19:26] until your testimony if it's contrary to
[2:19:29] your life
[2:19:30] is without any
[2:19:32] effect it's what you are inside of you
[2:19:36] that people read right it's what you are
[2:19:39] inside of you that people read
[2:19:41] so whatever is wrote inside remember the
[2:19:43] testimony that i give you
[2:19:45] god provided the place for the testimony
[2:19:48] and that testimony coming the shekinah
[2:19:50] glory accompanies it
[2:19:52] to make it live all right
[2:19:55] and notice here
[2:19:57] he says
[2:19:59] we are written epistles read of all men
[2:20:00] that is your life reads so loud to the
[2:20:02] public until your testimony if it's
[2:20:05] contrary life is without any effect it's
[2:20:07] what you are inside of you that people
[2:20:08] read not so much what you say
[2:20:11] but what you are seeing
[2:20:13] you can pin something on somebody and
[2:20:15] say this is that and so forth but your
[2:20:17] life being different from what they say
[2:20:22] your testimony of your life is louder
[2:20:24] than the testimony that someone
[2:20:27] could say something about you
[2:20:29] so just keep that in mind that we're
[2:20:30] bringing influences every day and the
[2:20:33] life that you live
[2:20:35] proves
[2:20:36] what's on the inside of you
[2:20:38] you can't change that it reflects
[2:20:40] every person reflects outside
[2:20:44] what he is inside
[2:20:47] but the time goes on
[2:20:49] if we take the testimony of being
[2:20:50] christians how many would say lord
[2:20:52] that's my testimony i'm a christian
[2:20:54] praise god amen
[2:20:56] i think that's one of the most solemn
[2:20:58] things that a man or woman or boy or
[2:20:59] girl could do or would when he takes on
[2:21:02] the name of christ that he is going to
[2:21:03] be a representative of christ
[2:21:05] you should watch every move you make
[2:21:07] because somebody is watching you
[2:21:09] and in this it reflects
[2:21:13] what god has done for you
[2:21:15] inside of you
[2:21:19] there's some challenging words
[2:21:26] i don't know about you but i want to be
[2:21:28] the best sign that god's gone
[2:21:31] i want to be the best son
[2:21:34] when that little boy called that
[2:21:35] bartender out and he said hey your
[2:21:36] sign's down
[2:21:38] the bartender went out and said
[2:21:41] he looked up
[2:21:42] my sign's still all right he said my
[2:21:44] sign is up there no no no no he said i'm
[2:21:46] talking about your best sign
[2:21:47] my best sign
[2:21:49] he said yeah he said this guy right here
[2:21:52] laying up along the curb drunk
[2:21:55] my best he said that's your best sign
[2:21:57] the little boy said he said because he's
[2:21:59] got the evidence of what you're selling
[2:22:01] on the inside is good stuff
[2:22:05] it's the best sign the best sign
[2:22:09] in our lives
[2:22:11] this is why brother branham when he
[2:22:12] makes this statement and he says in your
[2:22:15] life
[2:22:17] every one of us we should want to see
[2:22:19] our loved ones saved is that what we
[2:22:20] want
[2:22:24] they asked brother brown a question how
[2:22:26] do we win our what's the best way to win
[2:22:27] our loved ones
[2:22:30] brother brahma never said sit down and
[2:22:31] just have a big old bible study with
[2:22:32] them i'm not against bible studies i've
[2:22:34] done okay
[2:22:36] but what brother braham tells us
[2:22:38] he said this is the best way you win
[2:22:40] your loved ones
[2:22:41] is be loyal
[2:22:43] to what you that's right believe amen
[2:22:49] be loyal to it
[2:22:51] in word
[2:22:52] indeed
[2:22:54] and an action and everything
[2:22:56] it don't mean listen to a real life
[2:22:58] that's really been converted the spirit
[2:23:00] of god will deal with our life and
[2:23:01] correct us when we're wrong and we make
[2:23:04] those corrections
[2:23:06] by yielding to the holy spirit
[2:23:09] but brother and sister
[2:23:11] if your life isn't there this morning
[2:23:13] i'd say lord take me into the holiest of
[2:23:15] holies let him take you there
[2:23:18] don't don't rely on anything i don't
[2:23:20] rely on any gift don't rely on any
[2:23:21] sensation don't rely on
[2:23:23] don't
[2:23:24] rest
[2:23:26] until
[2:23:28] you have that
[2:23:29] satisfaction
[2:23:31] on the inside
[2:23:34] lord willing and sometime from there
[2:23:36] we'll pick up the last part of that
[2:23:37] verse
[2:23:39] where david said
[2:23:40] we are satisfied the verse we read for
[2:23:42] our text
[2:23:43] with the goodness
[2:23:45] of thy house
[2:23:47] and of thy holy temple
[2:23:49] i'm satisfied lord
[2:23:51] i've found him who my heart hallelujah
[2:23:53] desires
[2:23:54] he's everything to me amen
[2:23:57] and it shows in our life see even the
[2:23:59] very simple things that we do
[2:24:01] the daily things that we do
[2:24:03] praying reading
[2:24:06] coming to the house of god brother
[2:24:07] samuel there's some times that i i seem
[2:24:09] like that i have to battle to get down
[2:24:11] to pray
[2:24:12] sure
[2:24:15] but there's a desire
[2:24:17] to get before the throne of god
[2:24:20] what do i have to do well brother andrew
[2:24:22] referred to it here on thursday night
[2:24:23] sometimes it's a sacrifice
[2:24:26] we've got to take it and say lord
[2:24:28] and you don't maybe feel it's easy to
[2:24:30] pray a lot of times when you feel
[2:24:31] anointing
[2:24:33] man something i mean you just start
[2:24:34] praying and then there's other times
[2:24:35] where you have to
[2:24:37] press a little bit
[2:24:40] there's sometimes it's very easy to sit
[2:24:41] down
[2:24:42] or drive and listen to a message or
[2:24:44] whatever sometimes it's very very easy
[2:24:46] to do that then there's other times
[2:24:48] where you have to press
[2:24:51] you have to press but i can tell you
[2:24:53] right now
[2:24:54] we get a great blessing out of it when
[2:24:55] we press
[2:24:56] there's times when it comes to the even
[2:24:58] coming to the house of god there's times
[2:25:00] where there's things that comes up and
[2:25:02] look i'm not saying somebody's sick you
[2:25:04] you understand that
[2:25:06] but if there's times listen friends let
[2:25:07] let the holy spirit evaluate our lives
[2:25:10] really evaluate closely because look
[2:25:12] just coming to church if it's just
[2:25:14] coming to church that ain't enough
[2:25:16] either but what i'm trying to say is
[2:25:19] don't let nothing get in your
[2:25:22] way take inventory in your life and be
[2:25:26] honest before god
[2:25:28] because this is why brother bran tells
[2:25:30] us he said
[2:25:31] coming to the house of god keeps us
[2:25:34] in fellowship
[2:25:36] amen man
[2:25:38] we want to give every i know i've gone
[2:25:39] i've gone i've gone along today
[2:25:42] but we want to give everything
[2:25:44] everything that we've got
[2:25:46] this is a time to be very consecrated
[2:25:49] it's a time god deals with our life
[2:25:51] let's get it corrected let's get things
[2:25:53] that say lord let me lay it aside
[2:25:54] because we are here to be instruments
[2:25:58] of his
[2:25:59] amen
[2:26:00] our life is not our own
[2:26:02] we belong to him amen
[2:26:06] a blessed people that he's chosen and
[2:26:08] calls to approach
[2:26:09] that we might dwell
[2:26:11] in him
[2:26:13] and be satisfied
[2:26:15] with the goodness of his house
[2:26:18] you ever ate a good meal
[2:26:21] you had a good meal and man
[2:26:24] you don't matter and somebody can walk
[2:26:26] something else in front of you
[2:26:29] you're satisfied right
[2:26:30] that's something so small compared
[2:26:34] to the person of jesus christ
[2:26:37] in the life of a believer
[2:26:39] he's more than everything
[2:26:42] he's our life he's the one who gives us
[2:26:44] the strength that even when our body
[2:26:46] like brother brahman says when his body
[2:26:48] would tell him ah you don't need to go
[2:26:50] down there to church tonight just tell
[2:26:52] brother neville to go ahead and take the
[2:26:53] service but he says
[2:26:55] my space that his flesh told him that
[2:26:57] remember
[2:26:58] but he said the inner man said you made
[2:27:01] a commitment
[2:27:07] say god
[2:27:09] let me live under that influence
[2:27:12] let me let my life so live under that
[2:27:14] influence
[2:27:16] i want to be more consecrated
[2:27:19] because as we come into him we live in
[2:27:21] his presence
[2:27:25] the bible says where the spirit of the
[2:27:27] lord is
[2:27:29] there's liberty
[2:27:31] there's all kinds of there's liberty
[2:27:33] here in the house of god
[2:27:35] but remember
[2:27:36] is there liberty in your house
[2:27:40] there's got to be liberty in your house
[2:27:42] and if there's liberty then you're free
[2:27:44] to become what the word says you are
[2:27:49] and if it's and if it's not you're free
[2:27:51] to receive and come into that liberty
[2:27:53] yes amen and you know what happens with
[2:27:56] that liberty we're being changed
[2:27:59] from glory
[2:28:01] unto glory
[2:28:02] unto glory unto glory
[2:28:06] until eventually the atoms of this body
[2:28:08] will be changed
[2:28:11] he's working on us amen
[2:28:14] he's working on us
[2:28:16] amen let's pray
[2:28:19] father
[2:28:25] lord i
[2:28:26] i'm just so thankful lord
[2:28:30] for the leadership of your

[2:32:26] to move in to that place with god
[2:32:29] house of hell give way in the name of

[2:33:10] under your inspiration
[2:33:12] [Music]
[2:33:14] lord
[2:33:14] [Music]
[2:33:16] i know throughout this
[2:33:18] building there's lives and hearts
[2:33:22] that like myself lord
[2:33:25] that god have experienced this grace
[2:33:28] and we know it to be grace
[2:33:30] the mercy of god
[2:33:32] to lord in our lives that
[2:33:34] it's beyond an outer court
[2:33:38] it's beyond a holy place
[2:33:39] [Music]
[2:33:42] but it's into the whole list of holies
[2:33:45] lord will your life abiding inside of us
[2:33:51] we may not have all kinds of
[2:33:54] gifts we may not even be
[2:33:58] i think our brother branham lord as he
[2:33:59] dealt with one person in the church
[2:34:03] that church that person wasn't maybe
[2:34:04] even the most notable person or whatever
[2:34:06] in the church
[2:34:07] but your prophet called them a value
[2:34:10] to the church
[2:34:13] they thought they were going to pass
[2:34:15] away they thought they were going to die
[2:34:16] they were a nervous type person
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:21] lord as they came to brother branham for
[2:34:22] that personal interview actually it was
[2:34:24] brother branham who called upon that
[2:34:25] personal interview for their life
[2:34:28] [Music]
[2:34:30] and lord
[2:34:32] when he began to talk to sister bruce
[2:34:33] there
[2:34:35] she asked brother branham a question
[2:34:38] she said most of all i want
[2:34:41] i want an experience to know that i've
[2:34:44] got the holy ghost
[2:34:48] she said again i want an experience i
[2:34:50] can put my foot on
[2:34:52] that i've got the holy ghost
[2:34:56] now lord his brother branham he's the
[2:34:58] one that conducted and called for that
[2:35:00] interview
[2:35:01] and as he spoke lord to sister bruce in
[2:35:04] that moment
[2:35:04] [Music]
[2:35:07] he began to speak to her in a time in
[2:35:09] knowing that he says he said to her
[2:35:12] a normal human being
[2:35:14] a human being they come here with these
[2:35:15] desires in their life
[2:35:17] this would be normal human nature to
[2:35:21] desire
[2:35:22] to desire the things of the world
[2:35:26] he said but not you
[2:35:28] he said something happened to you one
[2:35:30] time
[2:35:31] didn't it she said yes
[2:35:34] he said what and it changed you don't
[2:35:36] have that desires no more
[2:35:39] but your desire is for him
[2:35:42] what did that for you
[2:35:44] she said christ he said that's your
[2:35:46] answer sister right there
[2:35:48] that's the grounds of her experience
[2:35:51] to put her foot on
[2:35:54] the desire
[2:35:57] down
[2:35:58] on the inside
[2:36:00] that expresses itself
[2:36:03] all the way outside lord
[2:36:07] yet lord i think of how sister bruce
[2:36:09] said it there she said but brother
[2:36:10] branham
[2:36:11] how can i possibly be the bride of jesus
[2:36:14] christ
[2:36:15] i make so many mistakes
[2:36:20] the lord how brother branham took her
[2:36:21] into that place he said sister bruce
[2:36:25] calvary
[2:36:27] was for your mistakes
[2:36:31] god made a way that the desire within
[2:36:33] you could come
[2:36:35] to a full reality
[2:36:37] [Music]
[2:36:38] he said god hears our voice
[2:36:41] but he sees the blood
[2:36:46] because lord god when our life has been
[2:36:48] hidden beneath the blood
[2:36:50] [Music]
[2:36:52] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:36:55] the desire that paul seats within our
[2:36:57] life
[2:36:57] is to please you
[2:37:00] is to serve you
[2:37:02] it drives us lord
[2:37:05] to do those things lord that are
[2:37:06] pleasing to you

[2:41:43] i need a refilling
[2:41:45] i need
[2:41:56] [Music]
[2:42:07] think how brother branham places it in
[2:42:09] christ the mystery
[2:42:11] he says
[2:42:13] god's desire to get this revelation to
[2:42:15] you
[2:42:17] he said but you let so many things take
[2:42:19] it out of you
[2:42:22] he said you let your job
[2:42:23] [Music]
[2:42:24] you've been through a whole litany a
[2:42:26] whole list of things you let your
[2:42:27] husband you let your wife you let and he
[2:42:28] keeps on and notice he says you left
[2:42:34] i believe that's with every revelation
[2:42:37] [Music]
[2:42:38] i believe that's with every revelation
[2:42:40] because we're being changed from glory
[2:42:41] into glory
[2:42:43] i want to say lord
[2:42:45] let me evaluate
[2:42:47] i don't want lady osea
[2:42:50] taking things out
[2:42:53] i don't want it taking things out i
[2:42:55] don't want to let things get it out of
[2:42:57] me
[2:42:59] let me just stay there lord let me just
[2:43:01] meditate on let me just talk to you
[2:43:03] about it let it be a part of our life
[2:43:06] even you know don't make don't let
[2:43:07] prayer even be a traditional thing even
[2:43:09] when you're going down the road maybe
[2:43:11] you're walking through the supermarket
[2:43:12] maybe you're driving in your car and say
[2:43:14] lord and it strikes your heart god be it
[2:43:16] unto me
[2:43:17] lord let this word let it just so live
[2:43:19] in my life lord let it paul say it in my
[2:43:21] life lord strengthen me and bring
[2:43:23] something to your heart god let it be
[2:43:25] that's a communion we've been restored
[2:43:27] back to that place of fellowship with
[2:43:29] him
[2:43:30] and that's god wanting to have just
[2:43:31] communion with you
[2:43:33] and just to say lord i
[2:43:35] i want to dedicate my life i don't want
[2:43:37] to i don't want to let the things of
[2:43:38] this world there's so many things that
[2:43:39] want to try to get it out of us
[2:43:42] is that right
[2:43:43] it's not it's not bad people it's just
[2:43:45] things around us that we can say god i
[2:43:47] need more grace to recognize things that
[2:43:50] could be coming about to try to take
[2:43:52] things out of me
[2:43:53] [Music]
[2:43:58] sometimes we all realize listen to me
[2:44:00] now i have to just say these things are
[2:44:01] coming to me to balance this out
[2:44:03] sometimes we realize we go through
[2:44:04] seasons in our lives too
[2:44:06] is that right
[2:44:08] it's like at times when i've talked to
[2:44:10] the young people and i remember you know
[2:44:11] sometimes on your job sometimes there's
[2:44:13] more hours you have to work you don't
[2:44:14] have a choice they say we want more of
[2:44:16] that drywall we want more doors in or
[2:44:17] whatever more you don't have a choice
[2:44:20] but in the midst of that time listen it
[2:44:21] ain't nothing like you're signing up for
[2:44:23] it but sometimes when you come into that
[2:44:24] where there's a season and you're going
[2:44:26] through that right there you know what
[2:44:27] you're able to pull on you're able to
[2:44:28] pull on the resources where you've
[2:44:30] already been storing up you're able to
[2:44:32] look in that time and not walk around
[2:44:34] with your head hanging down but you're
[2:44:35] able to have fellowship with god even
[2:44:37] that word you've been listening to that
[2:44:39] word you've been taken in you start
[2:44:40] praying you just say lord jesus you know
[2:44:42] i don't want to be right here you know i
[2:44:44] don't want to be in these long hours but
[2:44:46] lord jesus
[2:44:47] this is a place i'm inviting you here
[2:44:49] the company may not invited you here but
[2:44:52] when they hired me to work i'm inviting
[2:44:54] you here lord god i'm inviting you to be
[2:44:57] right here my co-worker i'm inviting you
[2:44:59] lord to sit in this desk right next to
[2:45:01] me you invite him let him be a part of
[2:45:03] your life in everything you do when
[2:45:05] you've got to work overtime invite him
[2:45:07] right there and say lord i've got to
[2:45:09] work this overtime but i don't want
[2:45:10] nothing taking you out of my life i
[2:45:12] invite you right here lord jesus
[2:45:15] make him a part of everything you do
[2:45:16] make him feel welcome at all times in
[2:45:18] everything you do and i can tell you
[2:45:20] right now it doesn't matter how the
[2:45:22] enemy can try to stack those things up
[2:45:24] here's one thing about it the presence
[2:45:26] of god he'll come right there in your
[2:45:28] life it won't go down it won't be
[2:45:30] walking around under guilt of well i've
[2:45:32] had to work overtime and i've had to do
[2:45:33] this the desire of your heart
[2:45:36] is to please god
[2:45:38] so what are you saying by the samuel i'm
[2:45:40] saying it like this if you burnt the
[2:45:42] biscuits and you now say oh i can't do
[2:45:44] the laundry i got to make another pan of
[2:45:46] biscuits invite him in the kitchen where
[2:45:48] he's been right there
[2:45:51] god help us not to get all tore up with
