[22:58] all our sample
[23:00] [Music]
[23:07] every moment
[23:11] [Music]
[23:38] Suns a little different it's actually to
[23:42] the devil and sometimes Saint likes to
[23:48] tempt you of your old life and try to
[23:49] make you think that you had something
[23:52] back then compared to the life you have
[23:53] now but sometimes you just gotta tell
[23:56] him it's over and just want to give you
[24:00] not my testimony but some I heard a
[24:02] minister say that there was a lady back
[24:06] there in brother branham's time she had
[24:09] something in her life I believe it she
[24:10] was smoking and she was in the prayer
[24:12] line and she was up there for something
[24:15] I think she wanted to receive the Holy
[24:16] Ghost or be healed or something like
[24:17] that but um um she had to make it right
[24:23] first before she had to go up there and
[24:25] she stepped out of line and made it
[24:27] right and repented of all of her sins
[24:28] and asked the blood to cover her and by
[24:32] the time she got up there obviously you
[24:34] know the angel the Lord shows brother
[24:36] branham everything every but everything
[24:38] in everyone's life and by the time she
[24:40] got up there and brother Branham
[24:42] couldn't even see that she ever smoked
[24:43] so sometimes you just gotta if this song
[24:47] you know I just hope you know touches
[24:49] somebody's life that if there's
[24:50] something in your life just tell the
[24:51] devil it's over and just repent and just
[24:54] you know start serving the Lord hope
[24:56] this is a blessing
[25:15] you can call me crazy
[25:23] you can say I'm not saying it's easy
[25:38] sometimes it seems so cool

[1:10:55] power for the spiritual astronauts my
[1:10:59] brothers and sisters I would like to
[1:11:01] read some quotes here
[1:11:02] what brother Branham said in the
[1:11:03] countdown 1962 in verse in the paragraph
[1:11:08] 27 he said Hebrew says here was made of
[1:11:12] things which do not appear other words
[1:11:15] they are supernatural amen and the
[1:11:19] supernatural is reflecting the natural
[1:11:21] see now the then the natural was eternal
[1:11:26] now then the natural was eternal or is
[1:11:30] to be everlasting with the supernatural
[1:11:32] but but sin sin perverted the natural so
[1:11:40] if the soul which I believe it is then
[1:11:44] everything that's happening on earth is
[1:11:47] a type of spiritual things that's
[1:11:49] happening see it's got to reflect
[1:11:52] something that achievement of man the
[1:11:55] achievement of man praise the Lord and
[1:11:58] whatever it's happening now in this
[1:12:00] world whatever is happening here in this
[1:12:03] world whatever we are seeing here in the
[1:12:05] natural
[1:12:06] world it's already somewhere in the
[1:12:08] spiritual world
[1:12:10] so you know some man-made man may think
[1:12:14] that I invented this I made this
[1:12:16] achievement

[1:39:19] to go down
[1:39:20] but already something pulling you down
[1:39:23] it is not easy to go up because the
[1:39:27] gravitation of this world is pulling you

[1:48:13] had will know who she is then she will
[1:48:16] go in the rapture Christ is the mystery
[1:48:19] of God revealed and three things happens
[1:48:21] brother Branham said before this rapture
[1:48:23] takes place the three things happens
[1:48:25] which is first a shout a voice of the
[1:48:30] Archangel and the Trump of God what is
[1:48:33] the shout brother Branham said the
[1:48:35] message first is the message go first
[1:48:38] and she believes and accepts the message
[1:48:41] and she will become the message under
[1:48:43] the messenger and she will be the voice
[1:48:46] of God in this age and she will be the
[1:48:50] voice of the under-under the messenger
[1:48:53] and she will be the final voice final
[1:48:55] voice to the final age and she is a
[1:48:59] spiritual astronaut and an after-work
[1:49:01] voice of Archangel relevance and what it
[1:49:04] is it's a resurrection when the trumpet
[1:49:08] sounds when the voice of Archangel
[1:49:11] sounds then the the dead Saints will you
[1:49:14] know raised up we all know that and
[1:49:17] Trump of God priest brother branham said
[1:49:19] if the feast is a marriage supper amen

[1:53:13] that's like a horse and buggy in before
[1:53:16] they're the people they used to walk
[1:53:18] miles and kilometers and hundreds of
[1:53:21] kilometres hundreds of miles or they
[1:53:23] travel on the boat or they travel on the
[1:53:26] animals you know like a donkey or horse
[1:53:28] or something like that and most of the
[1:53:31] people walked in those days but they
[1:53:34] they use a wheel as their transportation
[1:53:38] that real helped them to travel that is
[1:53:42] a horse and buggy and we don't use horse
[1:53:44] buggy now see we came through that we
[1:53:49] came through that amen
[1:53:51] so this whatever the man invented now

[1:54:18] find this when they made this automobile
[1:54:20] they you know it was more easy the same
[1:54:25] way the spiritual you know the ministry
[1:54:27] in the in the ages in the church ages
[1:54:30] I'm trying to explain I'm just catching
[1:54:32] my world transforming and just
[1:54:34] translating the words in mind you know
[1:54:37] and the Lord is so gracious and helping
[1:54:39] me amen
[1:54:40] thank you praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:54:41] thank you Jesus
[1:54:43] so when God you know bringing his church
[1:54:48] to a process step by step one after one
[1:54:52] from from justification to
[1:54:55] sanctification and they thought it's
[1:54:57] good now but God said it isn't it and
[1:55:04] the believers waiting there was more and
[1:55:06] their age is over over and another age
[1:55:09] has come and these Wright brothers are
[1:55:13] trying to put the mission they want to
[1:55:15] make a mission flying mission a mission
[1:55:17] a motor automobile is you know it's a
[1:55:22] it's a it's a driving we are driving
[1:55:25] over on the on the earth on the roads
[1:55:28] but they want to put that motor
[1:55:30] order that that mission in the air and
[1:55:34] they they invented it and they tried and
[1:55:37] that is the spiritual side of
[1:55:40] Pentecostal people they felt the same
[1:55:43] Holy Ghost you know in the day of
[1:55:45] Pentecost the restoration of gifts the
[1:55:49] same healing the same miracles the same
[1:55:51] science and wonders taking place you
[1:55:52] know and the same you know Holy Spirit I
[1:55:54] mean there they felt like
[1:55:56] this is it oh my we are the bribe he
[1:55:59] just jumped in the air oh my we are
[1:56:01] going in the rapture no sir
[1:56:03] relevance said that is not it a healings
[1:56:07] ok praise the Lord
[1:56:09] miracles praise the Lord speaking in
[1:56:12] tongues and prophesying and and then and
[1:56:15] seeing the visions and dreams and all
[1:56:18] these all praise the Lord
[1:56:19] jumping up and down good everything is
[1:56:21] good but it's came too close to that age
[1:56:24] and there is something beyond that
[1:56:28] beyond the Pentecost we are the
[1:56:31] Pentecost and looks like very similar to
