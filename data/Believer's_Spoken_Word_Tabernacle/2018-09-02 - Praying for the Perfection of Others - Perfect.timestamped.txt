[31:53] I think God sister Rita Costello she
[31:57] gave that testimony this morning and
[32:00] just the other day amen
[32:03] I you know you know just the other day
[32:08] when she she called and gave me the
[32:11] report and you know I tell you I've just
[32:15] been in my heart just rejoicing and you
[32:20] see the very things that God God has
[32:23] been doing yeah and he's been doing and
[32:26] I I just want to it's something that I I
[32:31] believe that we hope that we really take
[32:34] account of these things to recognize
[32:36] that what God is building our faith in
[32:40] his word that's that's the whole thing
[32:44] now now you know a person says well I
[32:47] don't need signs and miracles we don't
[32:49] need if you're a believer this moving
[32:52] and God has revealed the truth to you
[32:54] it's true you need no sign or miracle to
[32:57] convince you because it's been revealed
[33:00] to you but we do need signs miracles
[33:05] corners at the end of the 3rd Exodus
[33:10] message the Prophet in prayer he said
[33:12] Lord would you every once in a while
[33:16] do something among us to let us know
[33:20] that you're with us now I'm just going
[33:24] to tell you there ain't nobody bigger
[33:27] than the Prophet in this age I just tell
[33:30] you that right I'll just tell you that
[33:31] right out I think we agree with that
[33:33] that that's that's the star to the age
[33:35] we're not lifting him up to a god status
[33:37] but I I'm telling you right now
[33:39] he recognized those things to set it in
[33:41] line for us that you know what listen
[33:44] this is even to where he would say and
[33:45] turn the message perfect faith he said
[33:47] all our hearts long for those real
[33:50] apostolic times
[33:52] I believe that there I'll tell you what
[33:56] I you know hey my heart is thrilled
[33:59] within the revealing of the word I you
[34:02] know it's just things that that God will
[34:04] do and as he's opening this word I tell
[34:07] you that thrills my heart but you know I
[34:08] love I love hearing testimonies and
[34:12] seeing God move just something about it
[34:14] I just I just love seeing God move it
[34:18] just to me it's not just God moving but
[34:21] you see God moving for the needs of his
[34:23] children that's precious that's precious
[34:28] that's wonderful because he's still the
[34:31] same yesterday today and forever and
[34:34] he's declaring that over and over you
[34:37] know testimonies that we could go on and
[34:39] on throughout the year but I believe

[39:28] relationship with butter Samwell and
[39:31] sister Kim of course it goes all the way
[39:35] back to my relationship with Mary Jim
[39:38] browning and she's a path and because
[39:43] this church has become a big part of the
[39:47] ministry in the Philippines and I hear
[39:52] of people that just believe the message
[39:58] and they're living the message but in
[40:02] the Philippines we cannot cope with the
[40:06] open door that the Lord has the Lord has
[40:13] been opening for the message we just
[40:16] cannot cope there's just so many things
[40:19] that transpire in our country many
[40:22] people accepting the message that
[40:27] churches even as a whole group of
[40:31] Pentecostal churches if some come from
[40:34] the Baptist's they come to the message
[40:36] as a whole so we we are just thankful
[40:40] and we wish to share some of the things
[40:45] that the Lord has been doing in our
[40:48] country
[41:17] sorry but I have to start from the
[41:19] beginning
[41:24] yeah okay
[41:29] I hope this doesn't take long I have
[41:32] three presentations to show you this
[41:35] morning and this is about the resettled
[41:39] iya community in Mount Pinatubo zambales
[41:43] the Philippines in 1981 the volcano
[41:52] Mount Pinatubo
[41:53] which had been dormant for 600 years
[41:57] erupted and you can see in the picture
[42:04] the extent of the eruption it did not
[42:12] blow out the lava and did not that a
[42:19] switch into Indonesia and Malaysia it
[42:23] was that expensive eruption list of this
[42:31] of this volcano they say it's the
[42:36] biggest eruption at the second of this
[42:40] of the century I think second only to
[42:44] mount health at st. Helens I think so
[42:49] hundreds of thousands of people were
[42:51] displaced as a result and the eight
[42:58] tribes who live around volcano area was
[43:01] affected the most the ATIS are what you
[43:05] would call the pygmies you know they
[43:08] look like small african-american
[43:14] brothers people from Africa dark-skinned
[43:18] only they're a lot smaller about four
[43:21] feet tall but they look exactly exactly
[43:28] alike they look exactly like the
[43:31] Africans kinky hair dark skin
[43:37] and we see we see them in this picture
[43:40] you know evacuating with their stuff
[43:42] carrying their stuff with them and they
[43:45] live for many years in the evacuation
[43:49] areas and resettlement areas that our
[43:53] government provided for them this is how
[43:58] the crater looks today it has become a
[44:03] tourist attraction it's a beautiful
[44:06] place now people go up there just to see
[44:09] the lake to the area but we were able to
[44:17] get in contact with the tribal leaders
[44:21] because and we find out that after the
[44:26] eruption 15 years after the eruption
[44:32] some of the either people went back to
[44:37] the place where they used to live and
[44:41] they started planting stuff and they
[44:45] found out that the soil in the area was
[44:51] very fair tile and so a lot of them
[44:55] started going back and the government
[45:00] actually started a program of resettling
[45:05] these eight tribal people to go back to
[45:10] where they used to live these are tribal
[45:16] leaders the main leader was pallab and
[45:25] what was the other one is a minister and
[45:30] the woman was pastoral arena he she
[45:36] she's and she works under the
[45:38] Presbyterian Church that does missionary
[45:41] work in the same place and the one to
[45:45] the
[45:46] seated at the right Moses but as soos is
[45:50] one of the leaders that is being raised
[45:54] of the Lord in the IT community to
[45:59] present a message to the to their people
[46:04] here's one we discussed about having an
[46:09] evangelistic service and reaching out to
[46:11] the people that have been able to return
[46:14] and resettle in the area and this is the
[46:19] big vehicle that we rented because this
[46:23] is the only one that's the only type of
[46:26] vehicle that is able to cover area
[46:28] because of the road conditions
[46:37] our beer we now have a handful of native
[46:41] church workers and we carried a lot of
[46:44] supplies on a 4x4 weapon carrier yes I
[46:48] know all the world war ii vehicle called
[46:52] the weapon carrier we set off to peanut
[46:55] Oh Pinatubo mountain ranges
[46:59] these are missionaries from from our
[47:03] church and it's started raining before
[47:09] we left the nearby town of botolan
[47:13] zambales everyone was soaking wet as we
[47:18] reach our destination
[47:26] says here burying the heat of the Sun
[47:28] after the rain you know it rained and
[47:30] then the Sun shone it was very hot
[47:35] after after the rain hot and humid now
[47:41] this is one of the houses of the people
[47:45] that resettled in in the area of
[47:48] Pinatubo is actually gia is actually the
[47:53] chieftains house
[47:55] a typical Negrito house
[47:58] you see I look like a giant before the
[48:02] house because it's just a small heart we
[48:06] call this a bahai football grass hot and
[48:14] we're gathered around the plot were they
[48:19] said we can build a church and praise
[48:24] the Lord we are the first one of all the
[48:26] organizations that work in the area the
[48:29] religious organizations that work the
[48:32] missions in the area where the first
[48:34] ones to build a church in this area
[48:38] thank you Lord and this is the picture
[48:44] of the men that came to the our
[48:46] evangelistic meeting that we held in
[48:48] this place this is a multi-purpose area
[48:51] which they erected in the well the
[48:53] government has erected in the community
[48:56] so they can hold such events this is the
[49:02] woman preacher that's trying to help us
[49:04] and this is another house
[49:10] it was given
[49:13] his family was given two acres okay so
[49:21] this is the tribal chiefs house as you
[49:27] can see the road runs into the river
[49:31] that's the reason we need to have a high
[49:34] vehicle and one that will not stall in
[49:40] the mud and in the sand and if you miss
[49:46] the I wrote here you get to write a
[49:48] carve-out card if you miss the once a
[49:51] day trip to of the weapons carrier
[49:54] it runs once a day and if you fail to
[49:57] catch it then you have to write the card
[50:02] ball card can you see the carbo card the
[50:07] drive it took us about three hours to
[50:10] get to where we're going but when you
[50:14] get when you when you write the carb out
[50:16] card it will take you about at least at
[50:19] least seven hours to get there or you
[50:27] don't want to write a carb out card you
[50:32] can take out other means of
[50:34] transportation
[50:37] now this either children have to walk
[50:40] two hours to go to school the nearest
[50:43] school this is what I'm talking about if
[50:50] you miss the weapon carrier you get to
[50:54] write a carbo card or this we call it
[50:58] the Skylab
[51:02] it's a little scooter one two five
[51:06] school scooter Yamaha and the Filipinos
[51:12] are very inventive they put some wooden
[51:16] planks on the other side of it so it can
[51:19] accommodate more people I counted and
[51:22] there are twelve people on this one
[51:25] motorcycle and the Japanese people the
[51:29] tourists when they see this because this
[51:32] is the mode of transportation down in
[51:34] Mindanao
[51:35] besides in Mindanao and they're
[51:38] scratching their head how in the world
[51:40] this Philippines the Filipinos can do
[51:43] this it's only designed for one person
[51:46] and now they're carrying it's carrying
[51:49] 12
[51:57] now this vehicle they added a third
[51:59] wheel like a sidecar they call it a
[52:03] tricycle there's 15 people in this
[52:07] speaker now
[52:13] you can see the mountain raids not far
[52:17] from both from the volcano that erupted
[52:19] in 1991 see it's a beautiful place this
[52:25] is the house where women of the
[52:28] community cooked food for the 200
[52:30] families that attended the evangelistic
[52:33] serving service evangelistic meeting in
[52:37] in the place called bagong Silang and
[52:41] you see that the men are carrying steel
[52:44] ramps there they're carrying scaring
[52:47] steel ramps to keep our truck from
[52:50] stalling in the sandy lahar field so we
[52:54] had to cross the river a dozen times to
[52:56] reach our destination the beautiful
[53:01] Mount Pinatubo range this is how it
[53:06] looks today
[53:11] and this is a picture of the newly
[53:13] resettle eight of villages most of them
[53:16] they will be coming to our church once
[53:18] we finish the church and we are looking
[53:21] to dedicate the church in the month of
[53:24] March next year here's the church that
[53:29] we built as you can see it's still not
[53:32] complete so I hope you can pray for the
[53:38] work in Pinatubo amongst Titus and then
[53:43] I want to show you the next one I know
[53:50] how to work this
[53:56] okay
[54:01] next one is the tribal churches of the
[54:05] allowing goof-up islands we read in
[54:12] Isaiah chapter 24 verse 15 where it says
[54:14] were for glorifying the Lord in the
[54:18] fires even the name of the Lord God of
[54:20] Israel in the Isles of the sea which
[54:25] means that the name of the Lord should
[54:28] be ministered to the people that live in
[54:31] the islands of the sea
[54:33] do you know that the Philippines is an
[54:37] archipelago which is composed of 7,000
[54:40] Islands 7,000 Islands and our neighbours
[54:44] Indonesia in Malaysia there's at least
[54:48] 30,000 islands between these two nations
[54:52] so we live in a place where there are
[54:56] thousands of islands and God willing we
[55:02] are doing the best that we can by the
[55:05] help of God to reach these islands for
[55:07] the glory of God this is the map of the
[55:13] Philippines Philippines mainly made up
[55:18] of three island groups the first is
[55:23] Luzon Island which is the northernmost
[55:25] island the biggest island and then you
[55:30] see that smaller island cluster of
[55:33] islands in the middle it's called the
[55:36] Visayas besides Islands and then the
[55:41] orange island is the second-biggest
[55:43] Island which is the island of Mindanao
[55:49] there is a Marshall rule being imposed
[55:53] in Mindanao Island Mindanao right now
[55:55] because certain elements of the ISIS
[56:00] they went over there and started
[56:03] recruiting Muslim extremists to their
[56:08] group and they actually took over a city
[56:12] city of morale we in Mindanao and that's
[56:17] the reason our government fought these
[56:21] forces and martial law is still being
[56:24] imposed down there now our country's
[56:28] made up of 12 regions and by the grace
[56:32] of God in all the 12 regions of our
[56:35] country we are able to establish
[56:38] churches that believe this message amen
[56:47] now the long island to the southwest the
[56:52] long island plowin do have a pointer
[56:57] here
[57:05] okay this is the island of Palawan so
[57:12] Long Island probably 600 kilometers long
[57:17] and in recent years we were able to win
[57:26] a lot of Ministers on this island which
[57:29] resulted in two Brits resulted in many
[57:36] many churches coming into the message
[57:48] I'm not able to move
[57:54] okay you see this man the clicker is not
[58:01] working so this is northern palawan some
[58:06] of the islands that we go to she can see
[58:10] in this picture are the waters are very
[58:14] shallow and the boat are not the boats
[58:18] are not able to come in right into the
[58:20] heads of the coast of the island as you
[58:24] can see the boat is over there that's
[58:30] the boat we have to walk from the island
[58:35] to the boat coming into the islands we
[58:38] have to get off the boat and walk to the
[58:40] shore because the waters too too shallow
[58:46] there are a lot of islands like this in
[58:49] allowance allowance made up of three
[58:53] hundred islands there's three hundred
[58:55] and it's right in Palawan and these are
[59:00] the brothers trekking the mountain
[59:04] called Montelena Han in southern palawan
[59:08] you see there's no other way to get to
[59:11] the place where we're going but to walk
[59:15] you can't use your motorcycle here you
[59:19] can't use your your 4x4 vehicle you just
[59:23] have to walk walk for eight hours and
[59:27] there's a church there in McDonald and
[59:29] walk another five hours and you reach
[59:34] the village of valuing this one lost
[59:41] this brother lost her soul to win a soul
[59:49] because the the path is so muddy and you
[59:54] have to we're tracking shoes but this
[59:59] brother or ordinary rubber shoes to go
[1:00:04] there and he lost his soul this is when
[1:00:10] they stopped at a shelter about halfway
[1:00:14] to where they're going in MA in mutton
[1:00:17] or now this church you have to walk 13
[1:00:22] hours to get to this church church in
[1:00:26] between in mouth knock telling a hand
[1:00:31] they call it the cathedral 100 meters or
[1:00:36] 3,000 feet above the sea level
[1:00:46] that's the pastor's house we're helping
[1:00:51] him with we help him with the roofing
[1:00:54] and also the church roofing on the side
[1:00:57] of the parsonage and now we're helping
[1:01:00] him put was in his church
[1:01:07] it's a typical village in up in the
[1:01:10] mountain this tribe is called the path
[1:01:13] but oh it's known to be unreached they
[1:01:20] are still and reached as far as
[1:01:21] civilization is concerned and they they
[1:01:26] they meet very simple very poor lives
[1:01:31] this is the view from up there and the
[1:01:40] whole region is actually owned by the
[1:01:41] tribes and they told us that 200 acres
[1:01:46] are available for our use they told us
[1:01:51] you can plant whatever you want you can
[1:01:55] graze animals or do whatever you want
[1:01:59] you can use it for many years no limit
[1:02:03] said because they're the ones that
[1:02:06] tribal people are the ones that owned it
[1:02:08] by law and so they're letting us use the
[1:02:13] area to start a plantation or grace some
[1:02:18] animals ok this is the chieftain his
[1:02:27] name is Burt wing and I said here
[1:02:32] coffee maker / rice cooker that's this
[1:02:37] the metal pot pot is where they cook the
[1:02:41] rice and also make coffee out of it
[1:02:46] this is the congregation up in Bell wing
[1:02:52] you see how the mothers carry their
[1:02:55] children there carry them with clothes
[1:03:01] or piece of cloth tied around their
[1:03:05] bodies see they're very primitive and
[1:03:16] you can see the the dirt floor and and
[1:03:25] the benches this is typical of the
[1:03:28] tribal churches in Palawan the benches
[1:03:32] are fixed to the ground and to the wall
[1:03:35] and there's no way to keep the dog out
[1:03:42] they have no doors and here's the
[1:03:49] mother's singing a song to the Lord
[1:03:54] listening intently to the preaching of
[1:03:58] the word
[1:04:03] that's another picture now this is
[1:04:07] another church we've been working with
[1:04:10] for many years in some percent and
[1:04:14] northern palawan they see a place called
[1:04:16] a livable world and the main source of
[1:04:23] living there is fishing see that's a
[1:04:29] fishing boat and they gave me two two
[1:04:37] fishes they're like family of tuna tuna
[1:04:42] fish okay I want to show the third one
[1:04:50] this will be the last one by the way in
[1:04:55] the island of Palawan we have been
[1:04:58] working with sixty churches 60 churches
[1:05:03] I can say half of them are now solid in
[1:05:07] believing the message but we are still
[1:05:09] working with the other half because you
[1:05:13] know the pastors of this churches they
[1:05:19] they heard the message in our mr. Expo
[1:05:22] seminars and accepted the message but
[1:05:25] it's kinda hard for them to teach the
[1:05:30] message right away to their people you
[1:05:32] know they taught their people Trinity
[1:05:35] for say ten years and it's hard for the
[1:05:40] minister to stand before the people and
[1:05:42] say oh by the way what we told what we
[1:05:46] taught you for 10 years is wrong and now
[1:05:50] this is the right teaching so it's kind
[1:05:51] of hard to do that so what we do we go
[1:05:57] to these churches because they invite us
[1:05:59] and they ask us to come on a regular
[1:06:02] basis so we can minister the message to
[1:06:05] the people little by little until they
[1:06:07] come to a complete understanding of the
[1:06:10] mess
[1:06:11] so we're working on we're working with
[1:06:14] 60 churches now he meant so pray for us
[1:06:20] now this last presentation I call it the
[1:06:25] outreach continues covering the farthest
[1:06:29] islands in our country book of Saint
[1:06:34] Luke chapter 14 verse 22 and 23 says and
[1:06:38] the serpent said Lord it is done as thou
[1:06:43] hast commanded yet there is room after
[1:06:47] they invited all the people still there
[1:06:50] is room
[1:06:51] the Lord said called the heart called
[1:06:53] those that are that have infirmities
[1:06:57] called the poor and after they called
[1:07:00] them invite them to the wedding still
[1:07:02] there is room and so the Lord said unto
[1:07:05] the servant go out into the highways and
[1:07:07] hedges and compel them to come in that
[1:07:11] my house may be filled so the Lord wants
[1:07:15] to see his house full amen the Lord
[1:07:20] still continues to invite people to the
[1:07:24] wedding and he wants to see his house
[1:07:27] full belly bottom said when that last
[1:07:33] name is redeemed in the rapture we'll go
[1:07:37] and now if you were in the quickening at
[1:07:40] his beginning that's what he comes to
[1:07:44] redeem and your name was put on the
[1:07:47] Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking at
[1:07:50] the beginning and he come to redeem all
[1:07:53] the names that's in the book or in that
[1:07:56] book no more not one more just what is
[1:08:02] in there when the last name is redeemed
[1:08:07] then he takes his book and claims what
[1:08:11] he has redeemed so that last name has to
[1:08:16] come to realization that he's a seed of
[1:08:19] God and the only way for him to know
[1:08:22] that
[1:08:23] is for him to hear the word the word of
[1:08:27] the hour ministered to him and brother
[1:08:33] Branham said this in Jesus Christ the
[1:08:35] same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:37] I said now don't wait for the missionary
[1:08:44] to come you take the same message and go
[1:08:49] to the tribes where the white man can't
[1:08:51] even go this is what barban said and one
[1:08:58] one of the men that he went out was a
[1:09:00] hidden one day and the next day he went
[1:09:04] out and he baptized up to as many as a
[1:09:09] thousand a week in Jesus Christ he then
[1:09:14] one day and the next day he got he got
[1:09:17] converted and then he started telling
[1:09:19] the message this fellow hidden still
[1:09:21] felt tribes people and he was baptizing
[1:09:26] a thousand a week
[1:09:29] hallelujah periban was saying Bible skin
[1:09:35] surveys of Bible School and seminaries
[1:09:38] is just a waste of time because the
[1:09:43] heathens the tribal people can take this
[1:09:46] message to their own people word the
[1:09:51] white man can it go I mean I don't
[1:09:54] expect better but it Sam to go up 13
[1:09:59] hours to Mount McDonough hunt I know
[1:10:04] it's gonna kill him
[1:10:12] and he's afraid of snakes
[1:10:19] and so what about this but everyone said
[1:10:22] this said oh my that's that's what it is
[1:10:25] don't wait to educate a missionary to go
[1:10:28] to go in let the man take the message to
[1:10:32] his own people for God is doing a quick
[1:10:36] work the end is at hand I believe that
[1:10:41] you know my heart and then better
[1:10:47] Burnham's says this and once the message
[1:10:50] once more but that you have done it it
[1:10:55] will go I will take it and put it into
[1:10:59] foreign missions he has taken an
[1:11:02] offering a missionary offering and said
[1:11:05] I'll put it to foreign missions and go
[1:11:08] over myself to bring the people that
[1:11:11] hasn't the privilege that you have here
[1:11:14] to bring this same gospel to those who
[1:11:17] cannot afford to send for me or pay my
[1:11:20] way that day to who are underprivileged
[1:11:25] might have the same privilege that we
[1:11:28] have here and not one penny of it will
[1:11:32] be spent for you know drinking smoking
[1:11:34] it will be for the kingdom of God and I
[1:11:39] trust that God will in that give you a
[1:11:43] great mention in so much as you have
[1:11:46] done unto the list of this my little
[1:11:49] ones you have done it unto me and may
[1:11:52] the Lord bless you the list of God's
[1:11:57] children
[1:11:58] you know we sometimes want to be the
[1:12:02] greatest the most most popular the
[1:12:06] biggest but you know Christ is
[1:12:09] interested in the least of this my
[1:12:12] little ones and if you help these people
[1:12:17] the least of these little ones God has a
[1:12:20] blessing for you God will will mention
[1:12:25] your name at the day of judgment
[1:12:28] and then he said this divine healing
[1:12:32] said and I appreciate many of you people
[1:12:36] are poor people and tonight you probably
[1:12:42] may be put in the last nickel that you
[1:12:44] had and on that great day when we stomp
[1:12:48] stand up here at the judgment seat of
[1:12:51] Christ and you hear those heathens
[1:12:54] screaming when I after you hear my name
[1:12:59] called and I got to come and stand on
[1:13:02] the tape recording well the tape
[1:13:06] recording will be played and the screen
[1:13:09] will show it all and some of those
[1:13:12] natives and heathens from other
[1:13:13] countries saying oh brother branham if
[1:13:16] you hadn't had come I'd have been lost
[1:13:20] this native people people from the
[1:13:24] tribes the enriched people will be
[1:13:30] giving credit to better Branham if you
[1:13:32] hadn't come we wouldn't have we would
[1:13:35] have been lost and then God we looked
[1:13:40] down to you and say you were the ones
[1:13:43] that sent him the people were giving the
[1:13:49] credit to brother Branham but God gives
[1:13:52] the credit to the people that sent
[1:13:53] better random you may never see any of
[1:13:59] these tribes people in the Philippines
[1:14:01] that I'm talking about but you were the
[1:14:06] ones that sent the missionaries the Rev
[1:14:09] em said if you can't go send somebody
[1:14:16] Palawan Island
[1:14:20] this capo helps the tribes in Palawan
[1:14:23] Island the man used to be a Dean in
[1:14:31] their Bible school Pentecostal Bible
[1:14:33] school but he attended came at attended
[1:14:39] our mr. x4 seminar and saw the
[1:14:43] revelation of the message and accepted
[1:14:45] it right away so he's now working with
[1:14:52] his wife the Sega Malian couple reaches
[1:14:56] out to the remote tribes of southern
[1:14:59] Palawan and they are shown here with a
[1:15:02] stack of tribal Bibles that we bought
[1:15:05] from the cool new tribe submission the
[1:15:08] new tribes mission is an American
[1:15:10] organization and I just admire their
[1:15:14] zeal for the missions because they go to
[1:15:19] remote places mountain areas the
[1:15:22] farthest island and the missionaries
[1:15:27] stay with the people sometimes they stay
[1:15:29] there for five years I've talked to one
[1:15:32] the state in an island for 10 years and
[1:15:35] what they do they study the dialect of
[1:15:38] the people and you know Philippines made
[1:15:44] up of so many islands it's like an
[1:15:47] island has a different dialect so we got
[1:15:52] about a hundred dialects over a hundred
[1:15:54] dialects and this missionaries they
[1:15:57] learn the dialect and they begin to
[1:16:00] translate the Bible in that dialect and
[1:16:04] so this particular Bible is translated
[1:16:10] in the Ala when your dialect and we
[1:16:15] bought them for something like a dollar
[1:16:18] a dollar a copy or a dollar or $50 50
[1:16:22] per copy and so we bought we bought a
[1:16:24] bunch of them and distributed them
[1:16:27] amongst the leaders some of the leaders
[1:16:29] they can read and write they're not
[1:16:32] educated at least they can read and
[1:16:34] write and so we this couple now is
[1:16:40] helping train the leaders of the tribes
[1:16:42] to become ministers and these are some
[1:16:48] of the young leaders of the town Durant
[1:16:51] tribal tribe the youth leaders but the
[1:16:58] Edward trains and equips tribal youth
[1:17:01] try but the tribal youth people with
[1:17:05] ministerial tools you see him in this
[1:17:09] picture holding youth meetings and
[1:17:12] baptizing people baptizing new people to
[1:17:16] the message we gave him a dis motorcycle
[1:17:20] in 2015 and he used it over rough roads
[1:17:28] or the mountain roads just trails
[1:17:32] sometimes until he can't use it anymore
[1:17:36] he took it to the mechanic three months
[1:17:41] ago and then we can't accept there's
[1:17:43] nothing we can do to make this work
[1:17:45] again so we're helping him in another
[1:17:49] motorcycle motorbike to continue doing
[1:17:53] what it's doing brother Edward Saku
[1:17:56] Marion is responsible for starting
[1:17:59] dozens of churches like this amongst the
[1:18:02] tribes and these people don't ask for
[1:18:07] much all they ask is money to buy five
[1:18:13] kilos of nails because the number is
[1:18:17] readily available in the mountains where
[1:18:20] they live so they're up there only
[1:18:24] asking for nails to build a structure
[1:18:27] villagers for themselves here here's a
[1:18:31] picture of new believers being baptized
[1:18:34] in water no one's standing to the left
[1:18:42] that's an evangelist from my church but
[1:18:45] a little solo and that's me baptizing
[1:18:51] other people in the town of Kazan
[1:18:55] southern palawan again this is a typical
[1:18:59] tribal Church in Palawan again you'll
[1:19:05] see the dirt floor and you see the pews
[1:19:16] they're not like your pews that you're
[1:19:18] using here in your church they're fixed
[1:19:22] on the ground and fixed on the wall it's
[1:19:24] difficult but they're happy amen these
[1:19:32] are not dry walls these are bamboo was
[1:19:36] woven bamboos praise God these the
[1:19:47] mountain church I think I show you this
[1:19:48] picture
[1:19:49] Inbal wing up mount mantle Egan mantling
[1:19:57] on now these are the brothers that work
[1:20:04] together to reach the farthest island of
[1:20:07] Palawan never read this mr. Minnis
[1:20:11] ministers that saturate the islands of
[1:20:13] Palawan with a message of the hour the
[1:20:17] group is being led by brother Salva
[1:20:20] Susan is the one standing in the middle
[1:20:24] this man here his name is brother Salva
[1:20:28] Susan who was number two men in their
[1:20:33] apostolic organization he was number two
[1:20:37] he came out received the message and
[1:20:41] because he was very influential in their
[1:20:44] organization many of the churches came
[1:20:47] out to receive the message
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:53] hallelujah and now there's about I can
[1:20:58] think of about 15 churches in the
[1:21:00] Visayas and Mindanao that belong to
[1:21:03] their use that belong to their
[1:21:04] organization that are inviting this
[1:21:07] brother by the zelda susan so he can
[1:21:11] come and share the message to them so
[1:21:14] and this this brothers are all ministers
[1:21:18] brothers in the picture all ministers
[1:21:21] and balasana susan is we're helping him
[1:21:26] train these brothers so they can gain
[1:21:29] knowledge of the message and have the
[1:21:34] ability to share them with others pray
[1:21:37] for this ministers again this is a
[1:21:43] regular service in in allowing it's in a
[1:21:46] place called that Barone's near puerto
[1:21:51] princesa it's an agricultural area just
[1:21:55] outside the city again you see the dirt
[1:21:59] dirt floor and the benches that are
[1:22:02] fixed to the ground into the wall
[1:22:04] typical because there are 300 islands in
[1:22:13] Palawan we have been praying for a boat
[1:22:16] that we can use to evangelize the region
[1:22:20] of Palawan and i think i sent a picture
[1:22:28] to better sam about an old boat that we
[1:22:32] were using and we were gonna repair it
[1:22:38] so we can upgrade it and and use it for
[1:22:43] a missionary work but before we're able
[1:22:46] to do anything the typhoon came and
[1:22:48] destroyed the boat I think I showed that
[1:22:51] to you and better Sam said he shared it
[1:22:55] to the congregation
[1:22:56] and so we decided to just build a new
[1:23:00] boat and your church has helped us so we
[1:23:05] can build this new boat this is a big
[1:23:08] boat 50 foot long 50 feet so it can
[1:23:14] carry between 30 to 40 passengers and
[1:23:23] this is the last picture that they sent
[1:23:25] me they had it painted up installed the
[1:23:28] engine and had it ready to go
[1:23:30] in August race alone I think we have to
[1:23:35] give the Lord a clap offering thank you
[1:23:45] thank you for helping us and this boat
[1:23:51] can also be used as a livelihood project
[1:23:58] to help the people of Pawnee Island
[1:24:01] they're the ones that maintain these
[1:24:03] boats but they're gonna use it to number
[1:24:07] one to ferry people from the mainland of
[1:24:11] Palawan to Quran Island and back and
[1:24:14] also to catch fish they're going to be
[1:24:18] using for fishing and so that they can
[1:24:23] earn income and the income will help the
[1:24:26] ministry
[1:24:33] in the province of zambales I think I
[1:24:37] showed you a picture about Pinatubo you

[1:25:11] one too but their suits one of the item
[1:25:14] brothers who works as an evangelist now
[1:25:17] to reach his fellow itis this is the
[1:25:22] road to Pinatubo where we were building
[1:25:25] a church and this is a small group of
[1:25:28] believers they be used to belong to the
[1:25:31] Presbyterian Church but now they came as
[1:25:34] a group as a whole church to the message
[1:25:37] and that's my assistant pastor there but
[1:25:44] a boy DeLeon but Sam met him and so as

[1:26:43] to follow up on their outages in
[1:26:46] zambales this is brother his sous one of
[1:26:49] the pygmies that got converted there and
[1:26:52] this is the church that we're rebuilding
[1:26:53] in Pinatubo Lord willing in March we
[1:26:59] will be dedicating it to the Lord hope
[1:27:02] hopefully the Lord will provide for the
[1:27:04] roof and we'll be dedicating it in March
[1:27:09] now in in Mindanao southern Philippines
[1:27:14] this is a picture of a church that I
[1:27:18] standard started back in the 90s 90s and
[1:27:23] it's a growing church again you can see
[1:27:27] the dirt the dirt floor but they don't
[1:27:35] have the fixed benches here in this part
[1:27:38] of the Philippines now this is brother
[1:27:43] Aaron Allen or sabbia he pastors a
[1:27:46] church that I started in surah god I
[1:27:49] sent our IP because this brother is dead
[1:27:54] now he passed the way he passed he was
[1:27:59] preaching a convention for churches came
[1:28:03] together in a convention and somebody
[1:28:07] came with a gun and gunned him down
[1:28:11] while as he was preaching the Word of
[1:28:14] God he was actually killed in action
[1:28:21] what a way to die killed in the post of
[1:28:26] duty
[1:28:29] that's the same the coffee now in mystic
[1:28:37] city the island of Mindanao we conducted
[1:28:42] this mr. Expo seminar about 40 ministers
[1:28:45] from different denominations came and
[1:28:48] out of this 40 16 for ministers and 16
[1:28:57] members accepted the message and were
[1:29:02] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:03] Christ
[1:29:04] they were mostly Pentecostal Trinitarian
[1:29:08] people and they accepted the Lord and
[1:29:12] and then after the four were baptized
[1:29:18] then this other ones came also and
[1:29:23] received a message I think there was 12
[1:29:28] of them that came to receive the message
[1:29:30] so a total of 17 pastors came to receive
[1:29:37] the message now they're holding the
[1:29:40] tablets that we give out to them because
[1:29:44] these are cheap tablets made in China
[1:29:47] that they can use to study the message
[1:29:50] so they can minister the message to
[1:29:52] their people and we want you to pray
[1:29:58] because I think there's about a hundred
[1:30:02] new ministers now that we're working
[1:30:05] within the message and we are praying
[1:30:08] that we'll be able to give each one of
[1:30:12] them a tablet like this a cheap one the
[1:30:15] only about 50 to 60 dollars a piece in
[1:30:18] our country now it's a picture of me
[1:30:23] with butter and Tony Molina oh and our
[1:30:27] evangelist but the little solo you know
[1:30:30] sometimes we we are prejudiced over
[1:30:35] ministers that work under denomination
[1:30:39] or organizations I was thinking they are
[1:30:44] well supported by the organization but I
[1:30:47] was wrong this man worked for the
[1:30:50] Assemblies of God for twenty years and
[1:30:53] he was able to start sixty churches
[1:30:58] under the Assemblies of God not educated
[1:31:03] on the grade three education elementary
[1:31:07] education that's why it's not a full
[1:31:10] planche a it's nothing ordained minister
[1:31:13] with the Assemblies of God organization
[1:31:17] but because of his gift supernatural
[1:31:22] gift miraculous gift of healing and
[1:31:26] truly anointed minister we asked him to
[1:31:29] I invited him to minister to my church
[1:31:33] and he could not speak our dialect with
[1:31:37] Tagalog he was speaking Cebuano the
[1:31:40] dialect that they speak down south but
[1:31:43] the process of the Lord came that day
[1:31:48] because of his sincerity and the Lord
[1:31:52] just vindicated him and God just blessed
[1:31:56] our heart after he ministered now what
[1:32:00] I'm trying to tell you is that for
[1:32:02] twenty years he was given 30 dollars a
[1:32:06] month a stipend by the organization for
[1:32:10] 20 years and his wife was taking care of
[1:32:17] 40 children in an orphanage and was
[1:32:20] given the same amount of money 30
[1:32:23] dollars a month and this brother told me
[1:32:27] before I even heard the message I've
[1:32:30] made up my mind to live this
[1:32:32] organization because you know I'm doing
[1:32:35] the best that I can to help the people
[1:32:38] and serve God but the leaders of the
[1:32:41] organization they're just exploiting me
[1:32:44] and so when he heard a message he
[1:32:49] accepted it he gladly accepted it and he
[1:32:52] started going to this sixty churches
[1:32:55] that he started and ministering the
[1:32:57] message to them but then the leadership
[1:33:00] of the Assemblies of God got wind of it
[1:33:03] and he was called to a convention or to
[1:33:06] the minister's conference to be
[1:33:08] officially excommunicated and they the
[1:33:15] leaders actually insulted him before the
[1:33:17] pastors of this sixty churches that he
[1:33:21] started you know and they belittled him
[1:33:24] and they say now his believing is
[1:33:27] believing a call he's following a man
[1:33:30] now is believing a cult and teaching
[1:33:33] strange doctrine so oh we are
[1:33:36] excommunicating this man and you don't
[1:33:40] have to invite him to your churches and
[1:33:43] the brother did not say anything just
[1:33:46] thank them for the 20 years that they've
[1:33:50] helped him and walked away from the
[1:33:53] meeting but what they did to this man
[1:33:56] backfired on them because all the
[1:33:59] pastors of the 60 churches that he
[1:34:01] started sympathized with him and now
[1:34:05] have opened the doors of their churches
[1:34:08] and wanted it to come and minister the
[1:34:12] message to them praise the Lord
[1:34:15] hallelujah
[1:34:17] so now one by one he goes to the
[1:34:20] churches and they decide to be baptized
[1:34:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:34:29] this church this is better Tony moly no
[1:34:33] that's him that's by the liter solo and
[1:34:37] their first cousins and this is another

[1:36:41] can look it out on the internet that
[1:36:44] palawan is now has just been recently
[1:36:48] voted as the most beautiful island in
[1:36:52] the
[1:36:52] world allow an island look it up and
[1:36:56] this is the island of Quran we have a
[1:37:00] church in this island and this is the
[1:37:05] pastor its name is brother see there's
[1:37:09] manda and he has a gift of his craft is
[1:37:15] to build guitars for people he just
[1:37:20] gives them away and when I saw this girl
[1:37:23] we started our church started finance
[1:37:26] I'm financing this enterprise so we give
[1:37:32] him the money to buy the materials and
[1:37:34] he makes the guitars and yes so far made
[1:37:37] 40 guitars and we gave them away to the
[1:37:41] new new churches that came out of their
[1:37:43] denominations and to a lot of them
[1:37:47] there's that's just the only music that
[1:37:49] they have so thank God for this brother
[1:37:58] see that's him working in this job now
[1:38:02] we bring the guitars and finish to our
[1:38:05] church these are these are placed now in
[1:38:08] Thai time and there's a brother there
[1:38:12] that knows how to finish them so we can
[1:38:15] give the guitars a nicer finish so these
[1:38:20] are happy with this appearance of the
[1:38:22] guitars so this year we're hoping Lord
[1:38:28] willing we'll be able to give a hundred
[1:38:30] more guitars to the churches the new
[1:38:33] churches that have come this is Manila
[1:38:37] the island of busan that's where I am
[1:38:40] this is the camp-meeting that we hold
[1:38:42] there November 1 is also a big holiday
[1:38:46] and we hold a convention every year in
[1:38:50] our in Manila in our church in Thai Thai
[1:38:54] resolve and that's where brother Sam
[1:38:57] preached last November 1 I think this is
[1:38:59] the November 1 meetings there
[1:39:02] where you preach during our camp meeting
[1:39:08] this is a picture of the campers
[1:39:11] preparing to leave the grounds and this
[1:39:14] is our church balcony we're about a
[1:39:17] hundred people can sit but during the
[1:39:22] night the balcony is transformed into
[1:39:26] sleeping areas the brothers and sisters
[1:39:30] actually sleep on the floor they just
[1:39:32] lay them their mats down and they sleep
[1:39:34] on the floor so we utilize every space
[1:39:39] available so that campers are able to
[1:39:42] sleep during the night and that's why I
[1:39:48] don't I don't know if you seen this
[1:39:51] sleeping quarters last time it wasn't
[1:39:57] there okay we just built this kind of a
[1:40:02] balcony
[1:40:05] as additional sleeping quarters for the
[1:40:07] campers for the campers to sleep on this
[1:40:17] is our church and this is these are all
[1:40:20] young people we host a quarterly youth
[1:40:24] convention in our church were probably
[1:40:28] six hundred young people come together
[1:40:30] to for fellowship and to hear the word
[1:40:36] of God and this church help us build
[1:40:41] this this facility your church help us
[1:40:46] build this facility when Belle Browning
[1:40:48] was still alive
[1:40:50] glory to God
[1:40:54] and now it's being used for the glory of
[1:40:58] God it's a picture of the 800 young
[1:41:03] people that come to our annual youth
[1:41:05] camp
[1:41:07] eight hundred young people overseas of
[1:41:18] course we started churches overseas I
[1:41:20] started one in Milan and another one in
[1:41:24] Dubai because there are a lot of
[1:41:29] Filipino migrant workers that migrate to
[1:41:33] these places to work so were they work
[1:41:36] we start Bible study groups which
[1:41:39] developed into churches the one in Dubai
[1:41:43] we asked seven of our brothers that
[1:41:46] migrated to Dubai to start a Bible study
[1:41:50] group and then I advised them to
[1:41:55] announce that they're having a service
[1:41:58] because the the the group has grown into
[1:42:01] about 30 people and so I advised them to
[1:42:06] announce it over the internet that we
[1:42:08] have a service taking place at a certain
[1:42:10] certain place and little did we know
[1:42:13] that there are believers from Africa and
[1:42:17] India Pakistan and other nations of the
[1:42:20] world that have been working in Dubai
[1:42:22] for 10-15 years now having no place to
[1:42:25] go to for church so once they found out
[1:42:30] that there's a church in Dubai then they
[1:42:32] started coming there's there's about 120
[1:42:36] believers now in this church in Dubai
[1:42:39] and then I started one in Hong Kong this
[1:42:44] is the church in Hong Kong mainly
[1:42:48] composed of sisters because there are no
[1:42:55] work or jobs available for brothers so I
[1:43:01] a brother took up the burden of
[1:43:04] pastoring this church for six years
[1:43:06] but then he had to come home because he
[1:43:10] was his contract working contract
[1:43:14] expired and so now we're still praying
[1:43:17] for a brother that will take up the
[1:43:19] burden to Pastor this church right now
[1:43:23] I'm still in charge I'm still the pastor
[1:43:26] of this church they call me their
[1:43:29] long-distance pastor and they just
[1:43:33] stream our services every Sunday that's
[1:43:39] better browning in the church in how
[1:43:41] come what year was this is the Chi Chi
[1:43:46] 90 ha mm maybe here mm yeah mm and
[1:43:59] better browning you know he shows this
[1:44:02] to the brothers and the brothers here
[1:44:05] said Vera browning you look like a king
[1:44:10] there with your harem
[1:44:16] these old sisters hallelujah
[1:44:22] and so uh praise God that's the last
[1:44:26] thing so you want to thank the Lord for
[1:44:30] what God is doing I hope you're ready to
[1:44:49] hear the word now let us all stand for
[1:44:57] the reading of the word
[1:45:14] I entitle the sermon praying for the
[1:45:17] perfection of others
[1:45:22] this is selfless service to the Bride of
[1:45:26] Christ in the book of Colossians chapter
[1:45:33] 1 verse 7 to 13 before I let you be
[1:45:38] seated
[1:45:39] let's read it together as she also
[1:45:45] learned of a prepare us our dear fellow
[1:45:52] servant who is for you a faithful
[1:45:56] minister of Christ who also declared
[1:46:02] unto us your love in the spirit now this
[1:46:08] is st. Paul writing about this fellow
[1:46:11] fellow worker named Epirus who is also
[1:46:16] who also declared unto us your love in
[1:46:20] the spirit this was what Epirus did he
[1:46:24] declared and to Paul he just made simply
[1:46:28] me the report of the kind of love that
[1:46:31] the people had in colossus in the spirit
[1:46:37] verse 9 for this course we also since
[1:46:41] the day we heard it look at the effect
[1:46:45] of this report do not cease to pray for
[1:46:49] you and to decide that she might be
[1:46:52] filled with the knowledge of his will in
[1:46:55] all wisdom and spiritual understanding
[1:47:00] this is the effect of what Epirus did
[1:47:06] that she might walk worthy now paul and
[1:47:12] the others they tried their best now to
[1:47:16] help these people in the collage in
[1:47:21] church that you that he might walk
[1:47:23] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing
[1:47:27] being football in every good work and
[1:47:30] increasing in the knowledge of God
[1:47:34] strengthened beador mind according to
[1:47:38] his glorious power and to all patience
[1:47:42] and long-suffering with joyfulness
[1:47:46] giving thanks unto the Father which has
[1:47:49] made us meet to be partakers of the
[1:47:53] inheritance of the Saints in life are we
[1:47:56] all partakers I trusted your heart verse
[1:48:01] 13 who has delivered us from the power
[1:48:04] of darkness and hath translated us into
[1:48:08] the kingdom of his dear son delivered us
[1:48:14] from the power of Laodicea and now we
[1:48:19] belong to a kingdom the bride of Jesus
[1:48:24] Christ
[1:48:26] another scripture before I let you be
[1:48:29] seated verse 12 and 13 of Colossians
[1:48:31] chapter 4 says up opera's who is one of
[1:48:37] you a servant of Christ saluted you
[1:48:42] always labouring fervently for you in
[1:48:46] prayers now this is a Papa's ministry a
[1:48:52] pauperis was not the dynamic preacher he
[1:48:57] did not speak in conventions and big
[1:49:00] meetings but the Bible says he always
[1:49:04] labored fervently for you in prayers
[1:49:10] that ye may stand perfect and complete
[1:49:14] in all the will of God this was what a
[1:49:19] populace did praying for the people that
[1:49:22] they can stand perfect in the will of
[1:49:27] God for our bare him record that he has
[1:49:30] a great zeal for you and them that are
[1:49:34] in Laodicea and then
[1:49:36] in here here uh police these are the
[1:49:40] words of god let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:49:43] we want to thank you Lord for this
[1:49:48] service today thank you for the words
[1:49:50] that we have just read from the pages of
[1:49:54] this holy book and we just ask that you
[1:49:57] would come now and make these words come
[1:50:00] alive into our hearts in mind make it a
[1:50:03] part of our lives Lord we thank you we
[1:50:06] ask that you reach down to the needs of
[1:50:09] the people and bless your people your
[1:50:12] bride this morning in Jesus name we pray
[1:50:14] amen amen
[1:50:17] may be seated hallelujah so I think it's
[1:50:29] important to pray for the perfection of
[1:50:34] others
[1:51:08] amen especially in this day and age that
[1:51:12] we're living in the Bible spoke the Lord
[1:51:16] Jesus spoke about this age in Matthew 24
[1:51:20] where he said because iniquity shall
[1:51:22] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:51:26] this is the age that we're living in and
[1:51:31] this also the aides were we were we
[1:51:38] aspire to attain perfection because the
[1:51:42] message that we believe it's a message
[1:51:46] to perfection
[1:51:49] the Lord Jesus said be perfect as the
[1:51:52] Lord you're referrin in heaven is
[1:51:54] perfect and I believe he will not
[1:51:59] require it of us perfection Jesus would
[1:52:03] not require it of us if we are not able
[1:52:05] to attain it hallelujah and so I think a
[1:52:12] paparazzo's
[1:52:14] is so little said about him in the Bible
[1:52:17] it's a fellow servant of st. Paul I
[1:52:20] think he was with the st. Paul one time
[1:52:24] when he got imprisoned in Rome and I
[1:52:33] believe a popper us was mentioned in the
[1:52:39] Bible because he's he's giving us a good
[1:52:43] type of a believer a believer who prayed
[1:52:48] for other believers and specifically
[1:52:55] specifically mentioned in closure in
[1:52:57] Chapter four believers in Laodicea
[1:53:01] of course legacy this is the age that we
[1:53:04] live in were iniquity abounds and
[1:53:09] therefore the love of many rocks Kol and
[1:53:14] I believe app operas ministry is so
[1:53:18] important in our
[1:53:20] H and his ministry is to pray for the
[1:53:23] perfection of other believers you know
[1:53:38] a lot of time we think of our own
[1:53:40] perfection when we pray we usually pray
[1:53:49] for all needs and if we're honest about
[1:53:56] it you know how much time do you pray
[1:54:00] for the needs of others compared to the
[1:54:06] amount of time that you pray for your
[1:54:08] own needs sometimes we become very
[1:54:16] individualistic especially here in the
[1:54:20] States
[1:54:22] you know I do what I want to do you do
[1:54:28] what but you want to do I don't care to
[1:54:31] each his own but we understand that no
[1:54:36] man is an island we need other people to
[1:54:42] help us attain perfection and the
[1:54:49] challenge is how we can be on a par us
[1:54:53] to other people our brothers and sisters
[1:54:56] to see that other other people attain
[1:55:05] attain this state of perfection and to
[1:55:09] be able to labor in prayer like a Papa's
[1:55:11] did so that others may attain it it's
[1:55:15] not an easy task because Satan will
[1:55:20] definitely try to derail your effort
[1:55:23] it's a lot easier to be selfish and
[1:55:26] think of your spiritual growth and
[1:55:28] perfection in the Lord but the reality
[1:55:33] is you cannot make it without me you
[1:55:40] know what a mom says that last name in
[1:55:42] the book should be redeemed
[1:55:48] I think he meant not only experienced a
[1:55:52] rebirth but to be justified sanctified
[1:55:56] baptized with the Holy Ghost and adopted
[1:55:59] amen
[1:56:01] into the kingdom of God that's the
[1:56:03] purpose of this message when this last
[1:56:07] name has been finished and then the
[1:56:11] rapture the rapture can come meaning
[1:56:13] when that last name in the book comes to
[1:56:17] perfection Alleluia
[1:56:21] even if you come to perfection and I
[1:56:24] don't make it to perfection you think
[1:56:26] you can go
[1:56:30] you won't go in the rapture you're gonna
[1:56:35] need me to come to perfection like you
[1:56:42] came to perfection you you have to help
[1:56:44] me come to perfection hallelujah and I
[1:56:49] believe this is a great task for each
[1:56:52] one of us the ministry of Epirus
[1:56:56] laboring and praying so that others can
[1:57:00] come to perfection the word if operas or
[1:57:04] the name of operas is actually a
[1:57:08] biblical name which means covered with
[1:57:13] foam somebody has been covered with foam
[1:57:19] you know here in America we want to
[1:57:25] baby-proof our homes and when we may be
[1:57:33] proof our homes we try to cover
[1:57:35] everything you know the corners the
[1:57:37] sharp edges so that so that the babies
[1:57:42] can roam free and not be hurt that tells
[1:57:48] me that a popera is a person who has
[1:57:55] loving kindness
[1:57:58] Oh Papa Roz is concerned for loved ones
[1:58:02] and his approach is not offensive his
[1:58:09] approach is non-toxic he is harmless as
[1:58:13] a dove but he's wise as a serpent but
[1:58:19] harmless as a dog you know I used to
[1:58:23] think when we first started holding the
[1:58:27] mr. Expo seminars and they they actually
[1:58:32] they actually started something like
[1:58:35] that here in Ohio invited to 200
[1:58:41] ministers to come to a seminar they had
[1:58:44] the auditorium ready and the leaflets
[1:58:46] ready and the tape recording and the
[1:58:48] equipment ready and but al-ameen Jenkins
[1:58:50] was supposed to present the message to
[1:58:52] the people the ministers that were
[1:58:54] invited and out of the 200 that they
[1:58:57] invited by phone only two showed up and
[1:59:05] in the beginning when I first started
[1:59:08] this in the Philippines it was so hard
[1:59:10] to get the ministers to come and the
[1:59:14] ones that come the very few ministers
[1:59:17] that come they only come to debate you
[1:59:25] but then I look back and the Lord was
[1:59:29] showing me that I was I was not doing it
[1:59:31] right
[1:59:32] there was something wrong in the way I
[1:59:34] was going about it I was approaching it
[1:59:38] the wrong way I was full of knowledge
[1:59:42] but have no discernment no wisdom no
[1:59:49] love for the people
[1:59:55] and so I started changing my approach
[1:59:58] and I began to identify identify myself
[2:00:04] with the ministers in denomination and
[2:00:08] I'm trying to reach because all of the
[2:00:14] message ministers they shunned the
[2:00:16] denomination of people they already
[2:00:18] marked they already labeled them as
[2:00:21] foolish virgins they have the mark of
[2:00:25] the best you know and and once we have
[2:00:29] that kind of a mindset of most
[2:00:33] denomination of people they can the
[2:00:35] people can look through it through you
[2:00:37] they can see what's in your heart that's
[2:00:44] the reason that we we we have we get
[2:00:48] that kind of reproach we get that kinda
[2:00:51] kind of can't think of good response
[2:00:56] from the people because they are
[2:01:01] thinking this man thinks he knows all
[2:01:04] things he can't learn from us but he has
[2:01:09] everything to tell us to teach us well
[2:01:14] then change that and just become one
[2:01:17] with the brothers with the ministers you
[2:01:21] know they we are tender we attend their
[2:01:24] denomination of meetings their
[2:01:26] fellowship and they promote all kinds of
[2:01:30] doctrines and all kinds of even products
[2:01:34] they sell business and what you call the
[2:01:41] energy chi not working not working
[2:01:48] multi-level marketing and but we have to
[2:01:54] be patient and be just be one with the
[2:01:57] Brethren you know and feel what they
[2:02:01] feel and you know help them when we see
[2:02:05] that that they need help
[2:02:10] and we did this for for about two or
[2:02:13] three years without even inviting them
[2:02:16] to a seminar but then when they felt
[2:02:19] that we that we have become I have
[2:02:22] become one with them they felt the love
[2:02:26] and concern the genuine concern the
[2:02:28] sincerity next time I invited for mr.
[2:02:33] Expo seminar then a lot of Ministers
[2:02:36] came and that's how the the Expo
[2:02:43] seminars have began bearing fruits and
[2:02:47] now I meet Minister First Minister from
[2:02:52] different nations ministers in the
[2:02:54] message down in North Carolina where we
[2:02:58] attend a camp meeting every year and
[2:03:01] they they wonder what is it about the
[2:03:05] Philippines what is about this mr. Expo
[2:03:08] seminar this is the only nation on earth
[2:03:11] where this is working how come it
[2:03:15] doesn't work in other countries it has
[2:03:22] something to do with your concern with
[2:03:26] your sincerity with your intention your
[2:03:31] motive as first my motive was just to
[2:03:36] gather the people so I can teach them I
[2:03:40] didn't want I didn't really want to be
[2:03:44] identified with them and be a part of
[2:03:49] their ministry and help them but they
[2:03:53] could they could see that they could
[2:03:55] feel that in me and when I changed that
[2:03:57] and I became an
[2:04:03] and I pray for them they know that I'm
[2:04:06] genuine concern for them when they come
[2:04:10] praise God and now the Expo seminars
[2:04:13] have become very very successful I think
[2:04:19] of at least 200 churches that came to
[2:04:21] the message because of the Expo seminars
[2:04:23] namath hallelujah app operas also means
[2:04:35] she knows oh my yep operas means she
[2:04:42] knows they're familiar with the
[2:04:45] quotation spoken what is the original
[2:04:49] scene here is the secret but Bream says
[2:04:51] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[2:04:55] Christ to know what he wants done with
[2:04:58] the word the word is in the bride and
[2:05:03] she knows what God wants done with the
[2:05:09] word hallelujah and she does it in his
[2:05:12] name and she has thus saith the Lord
[2:05:14] then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit
[2:05:17] Watership until it is grown and serves
[2:05:20] its purpose
[2:05:21] so appopolous she knows she doesn't just
[2:05:28] know here
[2:05:30] but she knows here
[2:05:34] I think it's important the revelation
[2:05:36] drops from the mind to the heart
[2:05:40] hallelujah when it drops to your heart
[2:05:43] that's when it begins to be a part of
[2:05:46] your life and it begins manifesting in
[2:05:50] your life it becomes second second
[2:05:53] nature to you the message becomes you
[2:06:10] the bride will be a complete body
[2:06:13] there's nobody can add anything to it or
[2:06:15] anything
[2:06:16] taking anything from it if you would it
[2:06:20] would be a fake body of God but the body
[2:06:24] of Christ is not a fake body it's not
[2:06:27] going to be missing a finger it won't
[2:06:31] have three legs no more no less
[2:06:35] it would have maybe like six fingers on
[2:06:39] one hand and three arms and something to
[2:06:41] add to add something to take something
[2:06:44] away from it it would be one arm short
[2:06:48] or one finger short it's the complete
[2:06:51] body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being
[2:06:55] the male the groom the bride is
[2:06:58] represented in him also in this two are
[2:07:01] one it's gonna be a complete body of
[2:07:06] Christ the body of Christ is complete
[2:07:11] and therefore the Bride of Christ is
[2:07:13] complete
[2:07:15] wherever I'm said God is that even
[2:07:18] complete without you that's why every
[2:07:24] single one of those names in the book
[2:07:27] has to become completed or perfected
[2:07:32] hallelujah until it happens we're going
[2:07:37] nowhere
[2:07:44] in the book of Philippians chapter 2
[2:07:46] verse 4 it says look not every man on
[2:07:49] his own things but every man also on the
[2:07:52] things of others as a Christian becomes
[2:07:59] mature in the word and in the spirit he
[2:08:03] becomes more and more selfless he thinks
[2:08:12] less and less of himself and more and
[2:08:16] more about others it's more concerned
[2:08:21] about the needs of others than himself
[2:08:27] the Christian symbol is the cross not
[2:08:32] the crown but across and across is the
[2:08:40] symbol of sacrifice self-sacrifice this
[2:08:46] reason the Lord said if you really want
[2:08:49] to follow me take your cross and follow
[2:08:53] me daily sacrifice be able to you should
[2:09:02] be able to lay your lives down
[2:09:04] hallelujah
[2:09:06] to sacrifice it to give something away
[2:09:10] in order to get something give something
[2:09:14] away to get something oh my
[2:09:19] unfortunately sacrifice has been erased
[2:09:21] from the vocabulary of a lot of
[2:09:23] Christians
[2:09:34] second Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9
[2:09:37] for we are glad when we are weak are you
[2:09:44] strong and this also release even your
[2:09:51] perfection my what a statement from st.
[2:09:54] Paul it's ok a spear consider weak as
[2:10:00] long as you're strong it's all right
[2:10:04] that we are in need of nothing we are
[2:10:08] wanting of things in this life as long
[2:10:11] as you're provided for I believe this is
[2:10:19] the true attitude of a true Christian
[2:10:23] selfless concern for others hallelujah
[2:10:31] Bertram says eternal life is living for
[2:10:36] others that there was something about
[2:10:40] the Jackie Benton and about this
[2:10:45] particular code let me just read it
[2:10:46] first
[2:10:47] now the first thing that I want to say
[2:10:49] is Jesus never lived for himself his
[2:10:53] life was spent for others that is
[2:10:57] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[2:11:00] go to church and you do good things
[2:11:02] that's fine but when you live your life
[2:11:06] to yourself you haven't got it turn the
[2:11:08] line how many can say Amen to this
[2:11:16] eternal life is living for others it
[2:11:21] proved it when it comes in the lamp of
[2:11:23] God he lived and had eternal life
[2:11:27] because he did not live for himself he
[2:11:29] lived for others and you receive eternal
[2:11:33] life by receiving that day and you don't
[2:11:37] live for yourself no more you live for
[2:11:40] others
[2:11:42] and so I was rehearsing this to brother
[2:11:45] Jackie Jackie Benton you know him
[2:11:50] lady Jackie Benton told me over there oh
[2:11:53] well that has become a code that people
[2:11:58] like to code just another code it's good
[2:12:05] to hear because we talked about what
[2:12:08] happened to brother Allen's church I
[2:12:10] think I thought the church about what
[2:12:13] happened to our church in Miraz mr.
[2:12:16] Church said I led into the message where
[2:12:21] they demolished the church along with 60
[2:12:23] homes and we held church out on the
[2:12:29] street in the middle of the street we
[2:12:31] had services there and we call about
[2:12:34] upon the other churches in the area to
[2:12:37] come join us because they lost their
[2:12:40] charts and we just came together helped
[2:12:48] the Brethren in baraz and we made an
[2:12:54] appeal to the churches to come help this
[2:12:57] brothers they lost their homes they lost
[2:12:59] their church my brothers and sisters
[2:13:06] they are still suffering up to this very
[2:13:11] day they are still suffering some people
[2:13:16] came some people prayed with us but they
[2:13:22] didn't help I think of what the Bible
[2:13:27] says when your brother comes to you
[2:13:29] hungry and in need don't just say okay
[2:13:35] god bless you I'll be praying for you
[2:13:38] you have to do something hallelujah
[2:13:46] it turned the life is when you live your
[2:13:48] life so that other people can benefit
[2:13:50] from it not not your wife or your
[2:13:58] children or kinfolks
[2:14:03] your family but other people can benefit
[2:14:07] from it you're not living it for
[2:14:11] yourself but you're living it for others
[2:14:14] hallelujah
[2:14:15] this is the true sign of maturity I
[2:14:21] don't care how much you know about the
[2:14:26] message if you're not concerned for the
[2:14:31] well-being of fellow believers in Christ
[2:14:35] it amounts to nothing
[2:14:39] see our example is this Matthew 20 verse
[2:14:44] 20 even as the Son of man came to be
[2:14:47] ministered came not to be ministered
[2:14:51] unto but to minister and to give his
[2:14:54] life as a ransom for Mary this is what
[2:14:58] Christ did he did not come to be served
[2:15:02] he came to serve other people first John
[2:15:07] chapter 3 verse 16 hereby we perceived
[2:15:11] the love of God because he laid down his
[2:15:14] life for us we need to be able to
[2:15:17] perceive the love of God he laid down
[2:15:20] his life for us look at this next part
[2:15:26] of this verse and we ought to lay down
[2:15:31] our lives for our brethren I say amen to
[2:15:36] this verse hallelujah if you really
[2:15:40] perceive the kind of love God has for
[2:15:43] you you'll be able to lay down your
[2:15:47] lives for the sake of the Brethren even
[2:15:54] brother Branham needed prayer even
[2:15:57] Butwell needed the help of the believers
[2:16:01] let me read it to you believing God
[2:16:05] brother Brown said when I first started
[2:16:07] with these claims here started
[2:16:09] proclaiming the message I told my church
[2:16:11] stay on your face and pray you know you
[2:16:16] had the new year the gift divine healing
[2:16:20] - he had the Commission it been
[2:16:23] commissioned to go around the world and
[2:16:26] show that Jesus is still alive manifest
[2:16:30] to give heal people but he need the
[2:16:34] backing of other people he said I told
[2:16:39] my church staying on your face and pray
[2:16:42] oh my he didn't ask the people to go out
[2:16:49] there and try to accumulate money but he
[2:16:53] asked the people to stay on your face
[2:16:55] and pay he said then God begins to move
[2:17:00] the first thing you know I heard calls
[2:17:02] coming from Africa
[2:17:04] from all over the world how did it get
[2:17:07] there
[2:17:08] I don't know but prayer went up but Ram
[2:17:13] says pray believe when you pray this is
[2:17:17] it he said believe oh I believe it with
[2:17:22] all my heart I believe in the power of
[2:17:25] prayer as gifted as better Brenham wars
[2:17:31] I don't I don't know a person that's
[2:17:35] more gifted and better built in the New
[2:17:40] Testament
[2:17:45] he said this thirst thing for life we
[2:17:48] are a unit he said that's the success of
[2:17:53] my meeting he has to abuse it to what
[2:17:55] it's because real godly people pray for
[2:17:59] me that's it that's the recent success
[2:18:05] says that that's that's the reason for
[2:18:08] the success in my meetings when I come
[2:18:10] in and introduce these things about the
[2:18:13] visions and things
[2:18:14] there's many and old mother and dad
[2:18:16] sister and brother setting out there
[2:18:19] that believe that with all their heart
[2:18:21] and the Holy Spirit drops right down on
[2:18:24] them if they if they didn't do that I
[2:18:28] have no way of doing it
[2:18:31] think about it if people did not support
[2:18:36] me and pray for me I had no way of doing
[2:18:40] it
[2:18:40] no matter how great it would be for
[2:18:43] myself it has to be for you the same and
[2:18:48] then it says we have to do a unit two of
[2:18:54] us together to make contact with God you
[2:19:01] as a believer and myself as a believer
[2:19:05] on my mine
[2:19:07] what powerful statement we have to do it
[2:19:12] together hallelujah
[2:19:23] first thing spotlight first thing for
[2:19:25] life won't be long we need one another
[2:19:29] more now we need one another more now
[2:19:35] than we ever did need each other it's
[2:19:38] now leave the seer when you get yourself
[2:19:46] singled out from the rest of them making
[2:19:48] yourself just a little different you
[2:19:51] don't want to associate with them
[2:19:53] because they believe this and they don't
[2:19:55] want to associate with that you're
[2:19:57] getting on dangerous ground is this is
[2:20:01] the kind of attitude that you have
[2:20:03] you're getting on dangerous ground you
[2:20:07] isolate yourself but if I'm said right
[2:20:12] then keeping away from the church you
[2:20:15] try to keep away from the church you
[2:20:20] simply think you can do it all by
[2:20:22] yourself no you cannot make it by
[2:20:26] yourself
[2:20:28] you need other people
[2:20:31] Paul need other people even Jesus needed
[2:20:35] other people but apparently needed other
[2:20:38] people in order to be successful in what
[2:20:41] you did hallelujah
[2:20:48] so don't keep away from Church butter
[2:20:50] brown said find one of your choice and
[2:20:54] remain there and be a Christian brother
[2:20:57] to all of them that's the way to be a
[2:21:02] real Christian oh my
[2:21:05] then we've got fellowships he said
[2:21:09] protection people love you and pray for
[2:21:13] you do you realize your church is your
[2:21:17] protection when you're in fellowship
[2:21:21] with people of like faith you're
[2:21:25] actually protecting each other you're
[2:21:27] under the protection of the church as
[2:21:29] long as you are a part of that church
[2:21:33] Alleluia
[2:21:34] like I said we tend to be too
[2:21:37] individualistic and too exclusive
[2:21:39] sometimes just us for and no more you do
[2:21:46] your thing I do my thing hallelujah but
[2:21:52] you see this is a corporal thing honey
[2:21:56] no the church is a corporal thing it's a
[2:21:58] corporal unfair Alleluia
[2:22:03] when the Holy Spirit came it did not
[2:22:06] just come to one or two brothers and
[2:22:11] then the next day five or six brothers
[2:22:15] when the Holy Spirit came they were all
[2:22:20] filled with the Holy Ghost at one time
[2:22:22] they had to be sitting in one place
[2:22:25] and in one Accord hallelujah what am I
[2:22:28] telling you this is a corporal affair
[2:22:32] we're in this together
[2:22:35] Alleluia no man is an island that's the
[2:22:41] reason the Reverend talks about this
[2:22:43] fellowshipping you know when when a
[2:22:46] brother or a sister is this fellowship
[2:22:48] he does he doesn't want to take
[2:22:49] correction and Bertram says then the
[2:22:54] church takes its protection out from
[2:22:58] that brother or sister that won't be
[2:23:00] corrected we don't pray for him anymore
[2:23:06] when people in the church stop praying
[2:23:09] for you you lost your protection because
[2:23:15] the prayer of the Saints is your
[2:23:16] protection you come under the protection
[2:23:19] of the Holy Ghost when you become a part
[2:23:23] of the church
[2:23:30] Philemon chapter 123 there are solutely
[2:23:34] Epirus my fellow prisoner in Jesus
[2:23:37] Christ oh my
[2:23:38] Paul was a fellow prisoner and that
[2:23:41] paparazzi look to him as a fellow
[2:23:43] prisoner
[2:23:45] what is a prisoner he's limited in what
[2:23:49] he can do he said the mercy of the
[2:23:53] warden or the one that's keeping the
[2:23:56] prison amen
[2:23:59] if the pv if the warden tells him you
[2:24:01] can't go to the bathroom then he can't
[2:24:03] go to the bathroom and crisis our warden
[2:24:12] and we're all prisoners of Christ and a
[2:24:20] pop press is a prisoner a fellow
[2:24:21] prisoner of Christ
[2:24:23] I look at you as fellow prisoners where
[2:24:28] inmates together for convicts together
[2:24:37] or what I've said ex convicts together
[2:24:40] Malone we're still in it as I know we're
[2:24:44] convicts together with inmates together
[2:24:47] we cannot do anything outside of the
[2:24:51] will of God outside of this world we're
[2:24:55] imprisoned in this world I'll do you
[2:24:58] this is a limit the word is our limit
[2:25:01] hallelujah murder Bram said it becomes
[2:25:05] second nature to you and selfish life
[2:25:08] are you reading with me can you read the
[2:25:10] words and self is life not the second
[2:25:16] thought not to think about it but you
[2:25:19] are so dead to the things of this world
[2:25:22] and so alive in Christ and so walking on
[2:25:26] the highway that this things are just an
[2:25:29] automatic thing praying for others
[2:25:34] become automatic to you
[2:25:37] you don't have to be prodded you don't
[2:25:42] have to be scolded by the Deacons pray
[2:25:44] you don't eat the pastor telling you to
[2:25:47] pray it becomes second nature to you it
[2:25:50] becomes automatic to you hallelujah it
[2:25:54] becomes it's just a lot of automatic
[2:25:56] thing you just do it not saying well you
[2:25:59] know the Lord would the Lord would Lord
[2:26:02] want me to do that and you're being
[2:26:05] restrained the Lord wants me to do that
[2:26:08] to do that but one said it's not that
[2:26:11] you're just part of him his Spirit is in
[2:26:15] you and you act the way that he acted
[2:26:19] hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah so
[2:26:27] she knows a popera she knows and it's
[2:26:31] the promise ask and it shall be given to
[2:26:34] you seek and ye shall find knock and it
[2:26:36] shall be open to you for everyone that
[2:26:38] seeketh receiveth and he that seeketh
[2:26:40] fight find it and to him that knocketh
[2:26:43] it shall be opened and or or what man is
[2:26:46] there of you whom of his if his son ask
[2:26:49] bread will he give him a stone or vfe as
[2:26:52] fish will he give him a serpent if ye
[2:26:54] then being evil know how to give good
[2:26:57] gifts unto your children how much more
[2:26:59] shall your father which is in heaven
[2:27:01] give you things to them that ask him but
[2:27:07] you have to ask in faith faith is a
[2:27:10] revelation ask in Revelation and this is
[2:27:16] the confidence that we have in him if we
[2:27:19] ask anything according to his will he
[2:27:22] heareth us you have to know the will of
[2:27:28] God and this was what a purpose prayed
[2:27:33] about so that you can stand perfect in
[2:27:37] the will of God knowing the will of God
[2:27:40] hallelujah
[2:27:44] James 4:3 said you ask and receive not
[2:27:47] why the reason is you ask amiss you have
[2:27:52] a wrong reason for asking something in
[2:27:55] prayer you have a wrong motive you want
[2:28:00] to get healed so you can party again you
[2:28:05] want to get healed so you can go out
[2:28:07] there in the world
[2:28:08] I wonder God is not listening to your
[2:28:11] prayers you have the wrong motive you
[2:28:16] ask a mess that she may consume it upon
[2:28:19] your loss hallelujah brother Branham
[2:28:27] says don't think of yourself more highly
[2:28:31] than the others we're on the same level
[2:28:36] here there's no big eyes and small use
[2:28:40] we're all children of God better Bream
[2:28:45] says if the brother you think is a
[2:28:48] little wrong or the sister saying Lord
[2:28:51] don't let me never have a root of
[2:28:54] bitterness spring up because it will
[2:28:56] affect him and it will take Christ out
[2:29:01] of my life
[2:29:03] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[2:29:06] and hatred that will just take the Holy
[2:29:09] Spirit right away from you and it will
[2:29:12] it will run him from the tabernacle here
[2:29:15] it will kill the Spirit of God or drive
[2:29:19] it away from here and it will hurt your
[2:29:22] pastor it will do everything see don't
[2:29:25] do that
[2:29:31] don't hold any bitterness against
[2:29:34] anybody
[2:29:38] people hurt you but don't hold it
[2:29:43] against them people killed the Lord
[2:29:49] Jesus but before he died he utter
[2:29:53] despair Father forgive them for they
[2:29:56] know not what they do
[2:29:58] he actually forgave the ones that killed
[2:30:03] him are you listening he actually loved
[2:30:08] the ones that hurt him
[2:30:10] and nailed him to the cross he loved
[2:30:13] them that's why when James and John
[2:30:22] reported to the Lord that the samaritan
[2:30:25] village they didn't want to receive him
[2:30:27] they were they wanting their wanting to
[2:30:30] know well what do you want us to do
[2:30:32] would should we call fire - for fire to
[2:30:34] come down from heaven and consume these
[2:30:37] people listen to the words of the Lord
[2:30:41] the Lord said you don't know what spirit
[2:30:45] you are all disciples walking with Jesus
[2:30:54] ministering with Jesus for three and a
[2:30:56] half years chosen by Jesus himself but
[2:31:03] they are of a wrong spirit think about
[2:31:06] it you can be a believer this message
[2:31:09] and have a wrong spirit about you
[2:31:14] Alleluia and then it said the Son of man
[2:31:20] came to save these people
[2:31:25] I did not come to kill this people I
[2:31:29] came to save that should be a lesson to
[2:31:35] all of us he came to save and we don't
[2:31:44] know who he will say we really don't
[2:31:47] know if you think about it God's the
[2:31:50] only one that knows you know what I
[2:31:53] learned in ministry benebalm said preach
[2:31:57] as if everybody will believe even though
[2:32:02] we all know not everyone don't believe
[2:32:04] only those that have been progestin ated
[2:32:07] before the foundation of the world will
[2:32:09] believe but you cannot be selective when
[2:32:14] you preach I'm only going to preach
[2:32:16] about these people because I know they
[2:32:18] will believe it they're easy to preach
[2:32:19] to not them people these are gangster
[2:32:22] these are drug lords who are you to say
[2:32:32] that's the only one that knows
[2:32:35] hallelujah and it's the wrong spirit to
[2:32:37] try to discriminate people and Balram
[2:32:43] says pray as if everyone is going to get
[2:32:46] me get here but we understand that not
[2:32:50] all that everybody is going to get here
[2:32:53] only those that have enough faith to be
[2:32:56] healed will be healed what a lesson that
[2:33:03] is that should be our approach that
[2:33:08] should be our attitude every time we we
[2:33:11] try to share the Word of God to people
[2:33:14] don't try to label them anything think
[2:33:18] of them as a soul that has a chance to
[2:33:21] be saved
[2:33:23] hallelujah low to God even those that do
[2:33:29] wrong those that that are living in sin
[2:33:34] we don't have a right to discriminate
[2:33:37] them listen to this quotation the church
[2:33:44] in this condition god you sweated it out
[2:33:49] for us
[2:33:50] the Holy Spirit come down and convince
[2:33:54] people that they were wrong they were
[2:33:58] sinning their spirits were arrogant they
[2:34:03] become hostile snoopy okay
[2:34:11] stupid what does it mean snooping on
[2:34:16] other people's lives the best way to do
[2:34:22] it is Facebook
[2:34:31] you become they become hostile Snoopy
[2:34:36] know-it-all I don't need anybody I know
[2:34:40] the meeting the deacons who tell me what
[2:34:42] to do I don't think no pastor no she
[2:34:47] don't know it I'm not willing to repent
[2:34:49] not willing to forgive people that's
[2:34:53] done things wrong against them they
[2:34:56] wasn't willing to but today the Holy
[2:34:58] Spirit took the Word of God
[2:35:00] place it right in their gentle hearts I
[2:35:06] hope this is what this God is doing
[2:35:08] today right in our midst
[2:35:11] he's pulling the Holy Spirit and placing
[2:35:15] it in gentle hearts and said no do you
[2:35:19] want to come back to where you watch the
[2:35:23] first time you come to the altar come
[2:35:26] back to where everybody you love
[2:35:28] everybody and you love me with undying
[2:35:32] love and doesn't then just rise up and

[2:36:02] it as not were for if I come I will
[2:36:06] remember his deeds which he doeth
[2:36:08] prating against us with malicious words
[2:36:12] and not content therewith neither that
[2:36:17] he himself received a Brethren and
[2:36:20] forbiddeth them that would and casting
[2:36:22] about casted them out of the church now

[2:37:02] hallelujah Colossians chapter 1 verse 28
[2:37:07] whom we preach warning every man and
[2:37:10] teaching every man in all wisdom what's
[2:37:13] the purpose that they may present that
[2:37:17] we may present every man perfect in
[2:37:20] Christ Jesus so by the sample I believe
[2:37:24] this is the main purpose of ministry is
[2:37:30] to be able to teach everyone so that we
[2:37:36] can present every man perfect in Christ
[2:37:40] Jesus is that your purpose last verse
[2:37:49] then we'll close in Luke chapter 22
[2:37:53] verse 32 Jesus Christ told Peter but I
[2:37:59] have prayed for you Peter that by faith
[2:38:02] fail not and look at business next part
[2:38:07] of the verse and when thou art converted
[2:38:09] strengthen your brethren Jesus did not
[2:38:22] say Peter you're too hot-headed too
[2:38:27] hot-headed too big mountain to arrogant
[2:38:35] you will never make it but the Lord said
[2:38:40] but Peter I have prayed for you that
[2:38:43] your faith fail not
[2:38:47] knowing that Peter would deny him three
[2:38:50] times after Jesus said that Peter denied
[2:38:56] him three times you know if you put
[2:39:01] yourself in the position of Jesus you
[2:39:06] see Peter denying you three times you'd
[2:39:10] think Peters Peters faith failed he
[2:39:15] denied the Lord three times but it
[2:39:19] wasn't too late for Peter he was able to
[2:39:24] bounce back from there and receive the
[2:39:28] Holy Ghost on the day of panicle and
[2:39:30] became the spokesman of the church on
[2:39:33] the day of Pentecost and received the
[2:39:36] keys to the kingdom of heaven amen
[2:39:40] hallelujah and he heard the word upon
[2:39:45] this rock I will build my church and the
[2:39:48] gates of Hell will never prevail against
[2:39:50] this I give you the keys of the kingdom
[2:39:53] of heaven
[2:39:54] hallelujah Jesus prayed for Peter but
[2:40:00] the story did not end there
[2:40:02] but jesus said after you're converted
[2:40:06] after you're perfected there's something
[2:40:09] you should do strengthen your brethren
[2:40:17] so you think you're perfect you think
[2:40:21] you're already sanctified you already
[2:40:22] have the Holy Ghost you've been adapted
[2:40:24] to this to the body of Christ the
[2:40:26] kingdom of God you have something to do
[2:40:30] pray for the perfection of others
[2:40:36] because if they don't make it you won't
[2:40:39] make it there won't be a rapture amen
[2:40:44] the rapture is not going to take place
[2:40:47] for three months one day some of you
[2:40:51] will be Lim missing and then the next
[2:40:54] day the rest others will be missing
[2:40:59] little by little huh the nothing's gonna
[2:41:02] take it's not gonna take place that way
[2:41:04] the rapture is gonna take place in one
[2:41:08] at all at one time because this is a
[2:41:12] corporal thing and we are enjoying
[2:41:15] corporal grace from God hallelujah you

[2:41:25] hands of the one sitting beside you and

[2:41:51] denied the message sometimes I denied
[2:41:54] the Lord Peter did two three times but
[2:41:59] that doesn't mean he has already failed
[2:42:02] amen after your converted help your
[2:42:07] brothers strengthen edify the people of

[2:42:25] children be the best mother you can be
[2:42:28] hallelujah
[2:42:34] well god bless you
[2:42:39] [Applause]
[2:42:59] [Applause]
[2:43:14] believe you can recall things that even
[2:43:18] even quotes that I've stated here you
[2:43:21] before preaching on Sunday services and
[2:43:25] even of things that have been spoken
[2:43:28] on Thursday services filling up that
[2:43:37] which is left of the sufferings of
[2:43:39] Christ and that was for the body and
[2:43:43] it's true that this is an echo but the
[2:43:46] Brian I've got an echo here it's it's so
[2:43:51] true I don't want to add to that but I
[2:43:53] tell you if everything that we do and
[2:43:56] when we do it all of our actions and
[2:43:59] everything I believe we ought to
[2:44:02] consider is for the whole body brother
[2:44:06] branham he actually makes the statement
[2:44:08] in the message in the adoption series he
[2:44:10] says that it's not only lining up with
[2:44:14] God but it's lining up with one another
[2:44:17] and that's part of the body of Jesus
[2:44:20] Christ and I believe that you believe
[2:44:23] that I really believe that with all of
[2:44:27] my heart I want I want more of that in
[2:44:31] my life and I'll tell you that's really
[2:44:34] the things that I've been seeing and
[2:44:36] been witnessing within even my own life
[2:44:39] I want more of it it's a great great
[2:44:43] great victory it's a great victory you
[2:44:46] know to think of it that the Lord Jesus
[2:44:49] himself when that woman was brought and
[2:44:53] she was guilty of adultery but What did
[2:44:58] he say
[2:44:59] neither do i condemn you go and sin no
[2:45:02] more
[2:45:04] is that right then he went to Calvary he
[2:45:07] took it he took it for all of us and you
[2:45:12] know sometimes in reality for a church
[2:45:14] you've got to take it sometimes you got
[2:45:20] to take it as a pastor sometimes I have
[2:45:23] to take it you have to do it I don't say
[2:45:26] that to Pat myself on the back I say
[2:45:28] that because you know what it's it it's
[2:45:30] in you and it's within me to want to
[2:45:33] defend it's there is one to defend we've
[2:45:38] seen that very beginning of the fall she
[2:45:40] did this he did that she did this she
[2:45:43] that's that's part of that first nature
[2:45:46] but that inward part see the part is
[2:45:49] what God's dealing with maturity
[2:45:51] maturity is in our knowledge of the
[2:45:52] mystery maturity is is recognizing that
[2:45:56] opposing spirit and not allowing it to
[2:45:59] work within our lives that's part of
[2:46:01] maturity maturity isn't that you don't
[2:46:04] make mistakes
[2:46:04] you know that that's not maturity
[2:46:06] maturity is you recognize it and quickly
[2:46:10] turn from it that's maturity maturity is
[2:46:14] recognizing the importance of those
[2:46:16] things and we're a body I think of the
[2:46:20] things even as I stood here on Thursday
[2:46:21] night in other parts member we talked
[2:46:23] about the puzzle I don't know when that
[2:46:25] was before I ministered last Sunday or
[2:46:26] what-have-you but the puzzle
[2:46:28] you can't put a whole puzzle together
[2:46:30] with just one piece missing and when
[2:46:34] Paul alludes to even this of the body
[2:46:36] you can't just have one system of the
[2:46:39] body and call it a body you can't have
[2:46:42] just a circulatory system and say we got
[2:46:44] a body no it's part of the body so it's
[2:46:48] all part of the body of Jesus Christ in
[2:46:52] the wonderful you say Lord helped me
[2:46:56] just to be faithful to the part let me
[2:46:59] take my
[2:47:01] from you Lord that the rest of this
[2:47:03] great program of God might go forward
[2:47:07] without any interruption
[2:47:09] I believe he's faithful don't you well I
[2:47:13] tell you what I just appreciate the Lord
[2:47:15] so much he's so good to us amen some of
[2:47:18] these very things that just wasn't
[2:47:20] counsel this week
[2:47:21] something's very very things that was
[2:47:23] spoken right here the individual could
[2:47:24] identify a set word by word I tell you
[2:47:27] God is so good at me he's so good he is
[2:47:32] so faithful and so mindful of our needs
[2:47:35] oh I love it
[2:47:36] the Lord is so good to us I want to be
[2:47:39] more I want to be more and more like him
[2:47:43] amen
[2:47:44] and we love this don't we because this
[2:47:47] is the part and I'm not I don't mean to
[2:47:50] keep you but this is a part us a message
[2:47:52] that is so short called humble thyself
[2:47:55] it's so short it's a shorter that I
[2:47:58] think it's one of the shortest messages
[2:48:00] besides one in a million brother branham
[2:48:02] he deals with that and he says we want
[2:48:04] to see the working of that third pool in
[2:48:06] our midst the working of Christ he said
[2:48:08] then it will take every one of us
[2:48:10] working in humility
[2:48:16] brother BAM you know he gets up and he
[2:48:18] he comes back to it again after brother
[2:48:20] Vail speaks in the middle of it he comes
[2:48:22] back to it again and I believe that that
[2:48:24] is exactly our long as a believer we
[2:48:27] want to see more of God we want to see
[2:48:30] more of him in our life and the reality
[2:48:33] of it is is that it's it's us that keeps
[2:48:36] him from us not seeing more of me but
[2:48:40] all how glorious it is we can say Lord a
[2:48:44] sacrifice is a sacrifice let me
[2:48:48] sacrifice in order that you might be
[2:48:50] glorified you're loving the word just
[2:48:56] reaches down and just challenges that's
[2:48:58] doing it amen
[2:49:01] oh my I just love him I just so
[2:49:03] appreciate that brother royal that was
[2:49:04] so rich so rich I you know there's
[2:49:10] messages and there's things I always
[2:49:12] enjoy I always feed and there are things
[2:49:15] it's like this that was said that I
[2:49:17] believe that how the Lord brought it
[2:49:19] here this morning I just these are
[2:49:23] things that I just so so appreciate so
[2:49:26] much Amen from the word of the Lord amen
[2:49:30] so we want to continue to remember them
[2:49:32] in prayer
[2:49:33] Roel when sister Cindy and the the work
[2:49:37] that is going on there within the
[2:49:39] Philippines and you know I I told you
[2:49:44] what I'm gonna preach after this but I
[2:49:46] the points that brother Rowell made and
[2:49:48] I think they were so so clearly
[2:49:50] identified I think with every one of us
[2:49:53] myself was God first got ahold of my
[2:49:56] life I looked at it when I would witness
[2:49:59] to someone and I had to approach I
[2:50:02] rushed right in to introduce the message
[2:50:05] I was so
[2:50:08] and I looked at it in a manner of saying
[2:50:11] if they didn't see it and they resisted
[2:50:14] it you know something's wrong I was
[2:50:18] wrong and God brought me around to that
[2:50:22] reality and every one of us have been
[2:50:23] there every one of us you can see this
[2:50:27] is what this is the understanding that
[2:50:29] we have it's like this remote
[2:50:48] presentation or looking and the word the
[2:50:52] objective is first of all look at the
[2:50:54] condition of where maybe the person is
[2:50:57] and I don't care if they've got a nice
[2:50:59] suit and whatever more but you look at
[2:51:01] the condition of that soul and you think
[2:51:05] of that how can I help them sometimes
[2:51:13] I've never said anything to them to go
[2:51:15] into the gospel but I'll see them and I
[2:51:22] can start talking to I don't know
[2:51:29] oh god what could be the day could this
[2:51:32] be of soul right here I don't know but I
[2:51:36] know one thing wherever I go I want to
[2:51:38] leave that place better than when I got
[2:51:40] there because after all the gospel is
[2:51:45] not a letter
[2:51:45] it's an action it's a life that's that's
[2:51:49] to be lived to reach out to that life
[2:51:52] amen
[2:51:53] don't you loving it all the results are
[2:51:56] in God's hands it's not up for me me or
[2:51:59] you can't make no one elect me there can
[2:52:01] we make someone who is not that and the
[2:52:03] beauty of it is just shine your light
[2:52:05] that's the beauty of it you know you
[2:52:09] remember the quote I read here some time
[2:52:11] ago we were talking about billboards on
[2:52:12] the Thursday nights you know let your
[2:52:14] light shine brother Graham said
[2:52:15] concerning when you go he said to a man
[2:52:18] is putting a roof on and that man may be
[2:52:20] using a hammer he said and you've got an
[2:52:23] automatic nail and he said don't walk up
[2:52:26] to him and say what you got is no count
[2:52:28] he said you'll never hear you but what
[2:52:31] you present is say my you're a good
[2:52:34] roofer why you doing this job and really
[2:52:36] mean it really mean it they doing a
[2:52:39] tremendous job but he says then they say
[2:52:43] hey have you ever considered this you
[2:52:45] know this this right here have you ever
[2:52:47] seen one of these he says and then the
[2:52:49] man saying no I never seen one else he
[2:52:52] said then you can freeze that what you
[2:52:55] brother brems says it's nothing wrong
[2:52:57] with what we have he says it's our
[2:52:59] presentation
[2:53:02] it's our presentation oh my I say Lord
[2:53:06] Jesus it's like this screen right here
[2:53:08] that have all these little chips on it
[2:53:10] to try to bring reflections or colors
[2:53:11] that's what we want our lives to be
[2:53:13] doing is live Lord and let all the
[2:53:15] little chips the diamond chips let it
[2:53:17] reflect you just right oh hey man I I
[2:53:22] didn't say those things to take your
[2:53:24] time I just my heart just just so
[2:53:27] bubbling up you know you know my heart
[2:53:30] when I look across these things when
[2:53:31] this is being preached today I don't
[2:53:33] just see this as a church I don't see
[2:53:35] this just as a message of a church I see
[2:53:37] if at first as a father I see Peppers as
[2:53:41] a grandfather grandparent seeing needs
[2:53:43] he's very sensitive and I see it all
[2:53:45] across yeah you brought you probably
[2:53:48] think oh we're gonna hear this again
[2:53:51] thank you brother oh thank you for
[2:53:54] yielding sister Cindy thank you for
[2:54:02] standing behind him everything
[2:54:11] okay amen so appreciate that could we
[2:54:15] just bow our heads and we're just gonna
[2:54:16] let you be dismissed amen
[2:54:19] Lord Jesus
[2:54:24] I don't even feel like the words think
[2:54:26] you would cover it
[2:54:30] the Lord we're grateful this morning
[2:54:33] that you spoke to the depths of our
[2:54:36] hearts these are things Lord that are
[2:54:41] not just simple this is depth Floyd
[2:54:48] it's our life it's the molding it's
[2:54:51] character it's laying down of our lives
[2:54:53] Lord
[2:54:54] honing in well God in the great purpose
[2:54:59] that is so grabbed ahold of our lives
[2:55:02] [Music]
[2:55:04] lord I pray I want to take these things
[2:55:09] and we want to take him Lord as an
[2:55:11] assembly and I want to pray over Boyd
[2:55:15] you want to pray over these things Oh
[2:55:18] God not only for my own life but for the
[2:55:23] lives of others Lord each and every one
[2:55:25] in this assembly for it is the truth
[2:55:28] Lord those things Lord you know that you
[2:55:32] come and just broke it right out here
[2:55:33] this morning but has bubbled up Lord
[2:55:35] through my heart Oh God
[2:55:39] we are a body we are a unit Lord Jesus
[2:55:45] Oh God we need one another that part of
[2:55:50] Christ and my brother my sister I need
[2:55:53] that Lord as much as they need that part
[2:55:56] of Christ in me we need one another Lord
[2:55:59] like a a great puzzle Lord each having
[2:56:01] its piece and part and Lord within it
[2:56:05] and father may we continue to shine that
[2:56:11] light Lord father when circumstances
[2:56:15] sometimes can be discouraging when we
[2:56:19] don't see results but Lord God may we
[2:56:24] stand upon your word and faith to know
[2:56:27] that your word will not return back to
[2:56:29] you void sometimes Lord it's how do we
[2:56:33] even respond and react after that word
[2:56:36] has been shared and it's seemingly no
[2:56:39] result that we can see but o God we
[2:56:43] recognize more and more as mature
[2:56:45] believers that results itself that we
[2:56:47] can see on the outside must first become
[2:56:52] a reality on the inside Lord as your
[2:56:56] prophet told us and we see it so clearly
[2:56:58] you hid in the death of Christ but you
[2:57:02] were manifested in the resurrection so
[2:57:05] lord help us to die to ourselves that it
[2:57:08] might be made manifest through our lives
[2:57:10] Lord O God for forgiveness and all of
[2:57:15] these great attributes Lord are not
[2:57:17] things that we do with our lips but they
[2:57:19] are conditions of our heart Lord
