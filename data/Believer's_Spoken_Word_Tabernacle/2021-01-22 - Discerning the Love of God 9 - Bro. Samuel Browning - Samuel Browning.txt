hallelujah and he has amen amen we have been built up and come into the fullness of the statue perfection of jesus christ and it's his word the lord amen we have been created as the bible says for praise praise the lord for praise amen amen and this is the time as that scripture says the time of our faith amen aren't you glad to receive the favor of the lord amen like ruth when she looked at boaz what have i done to deserve his favor and the answer is nothing nothing the favor that we've received now is a favor was given clear from the foundation of the world i'm grateful tonight aren't you amen just so thankful to be amen a part of the body of jesus christ and so thankful to know that where we are standing in this hour while the world is reeling and rocking and uh but i'm so thankful that we have a sure foundation and that a kingdom of the lord which cannot be shaken removed or overtaken amen amen sooner very soon we're going to see the king amen soon and very soon we certainly are closer amen amen we just want to turn our attention to the word and thank the musicians and as we just prepared to do that we just want to invite the lord that you'll just come just just speak to our hearts tonight in a very very personal way we i'm certain that among us i know that we have many needs those that are here and then others that would be streaming as well and different needs and we just want to just go before the throne of god i know we've taken a prayer request already but we want to just go and just ask god that he'll just come and speak to our hearts minister to our knee he knows what we have need of and he knows just how to speak to us so let's just turn our attention to him heavenly father lord we we just counted just such an honor and a privilege to be able to come lord together and into your presence dear god we are just just so thankful lord in this time in the hour that we're living in lord so thankful dear god for the vision of the word that lord that has come with such clarity and dear god for the spirit of god who delivered it lord that you would direct us you would draw us to yourself and lord you it's just such a work of redemption in our life to bring us in position in the vision oh god and lord we we see things lord all around us lord we see things lord taking place we see as it as lord it has been so fitly declared this world is again falling apart but lord we recognize we're at a junction lord this is a time dear god where the world lord is in a place lord to where it's to pass away it's what all the prophets it's what all have looked forward to lord down through time all of the acts lord in the scripture lord we just find ourselves lord living in a very awesome time and so lord we just ask god that for your grace and mercy because we certainly don't take anything for granted we know that lord it's you that has opened our eyes lord it's you that has touched our hearts it's you that's lord just move to the lord do such a work lord a complete work lord of redemption in our life it's we just lord desire everything that's within us lord that god there be nothing between you and i lord but father that in everything lord may we be even the more earnest o god as the scripture said lord that we would come together even more so as we see the evil days approaching lord jesus we are mindful o god lord of your presence lord mindful of your word god mindful of who the lord you have declared and revealed to us of who we are god what an awesome responsibility lord lays lord in our hands but father we just want to completely deliver ourselves into your hands may you help us lord may you guide us may you speak to our hearts tonight lord minister to every need we pray both in the visible and the invisible audience as well we ask all these things lord for the glory of god in jesus name amen amen one verse of scripture here tonight in first corinthians 13 verse 4. the scripture says charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up and i want to just draw from that i've read from this portion in the amplified bible just to say the time of definition sometimes but just that second part is where we've been looking there is love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i certainly believe that as we would look at this in the scripture and we've been as the lord has taken us in this for some time we're living in an age that where god has has called us into that place of of the perfect love of god and to where that in an age of such deception an age where we see of such hatred but yet in the midst of that age god would call you and i to a place in perfect love and to manifest that perfect love we realize that in in the time that in the season that we're living in there will always any time that when it's time for the word to be made manifest there's always opposition there's always conditions there's always things that would arise to try to hinder or try to thwart or to come against that but this is where that when we look here in this portion of the scripture there's a lot of things that paul went through that a person could actually do and have quite a i could say quite a resume they could understand all mysteries they could you know just be able to lay everything out perfectly they could even have faith to move mountains so to even be able to tap into a place of faith to move mountains but yet it would not be the qualifying faith of the faith of god which is the love of god in the heart of the of the person or the individual so all of the mighty acts and things that could be done but yet what is the ultimate is that of charity to have that of the love of god that's that's that's the ultimate within any life in any heart and we know that's a that's a great treasure amen for that to be placed within our lives and i want to just just come back into this place in the scripture where we were at last week and ah we we ended here around this around this scripture in proverbs 14 30. and we were just how the lord took us and i certainly just how he took that and went with it but we seen where envy itself is a very very cruel thing uh we whitney you see it there as we begin to take each of those examples and you see through the scripture of how the envy can so get among as it was among uh joseph uh between joseph's brethren and him and then we see even when they came against the lord jesus we see it between cain and abel we've seen it there of lucifer coming against michael and we see it all the way as it it continues to move on down down through the scriptures even where jesus would say that it would come to a place to where he said men he said they will kill you and think they are doing god a service it's john chapter 16. so we find that there is a envy is a very is a very horrible thing it's something that there is no envy within love not within that of perfect love when a person has been born again by the spirit of almighty god that old nature is completely gone and god sets down right in the midst of that life and there is a governance that takes place there's a new ownership there's a new administration there is a new king that is residing there one who is directing that not that temptations are not that things will not come but there is one on the inside who is greater than any temptation and when we look at this in the scripture of proverbs 14 30 it says a sound heart this deals with not just talking of a healthy heart but it's talking in terms of a spiritual condition a sound heart is the life of the flesh and when we look at it you know brother brandon would make many statements and he would deal with how that many and he's pulling from research in that time but he says 60 of all the sicknesses are derived from temper it's derived from a lot of these things worry and these are things that brother branham said brother rams said back then you find it right now among science and among doctors that there's many times where they are trying to uh set forth medicine but the medicine itself will not override underlying uh situations such as envy or grudge or resentfulness it won't override that and this is why brother brown said worry it causes cancer these are things that lay within it and you know these are things that you know brother brahman says you come to a place and he says you find yourself you know rising up and my i'm going to give him a piece of my mind and brother brad simply says that he says you'll be the one that'll suffer for it because of allowing things to reside in a person's life sometimes they don't even realize why is this person so why are they so sick or why is this you know many times there's things that is it's greater than just a sickness or a disease it comes down to there's actually a root cause that's inviting that there in that life a sound heart now understand we i want you to take that all in a balance because a sound heart is the life of the flesh it will actually give strength and life like brother brown talked about that sister who who was there in the wheelchair but brother brandon said he looked at her and what joy that she had she wasn't upset that she'd been prayed for and countless times but there was a joy what gave her life of the flesh what was it that gave her strength she had the joy of the lord in her life you know when you look at somebody who's walked a little bit with the lord sometimes you can look around you know the assembly and see veterans you see others it isn't that they haven't come through some of the same pathways and obstacles and tests and trials it isn't that well you know what's going on with me nobody's ever had that before that's nonsense everybody has come in across certain pathways you know we need to get rid of and say god don't let me begin to operate by a complex and to recognize like it's on me oh my well we're just going to go with it now we just don't want to operate in that manner because we're never going to get help we need help from god and to recognize that when you can look sometimes at older ones and veterans and different ones anybody that's been in the way in any length of time you recognize you know by your own life you can look at that life and say they have come through many things that i'm experiencing and they're still standing you know what that is that's the grace of god in their life it's a testimony that no matter how old or how long it goes on there is the grace of god a joy of the lord that the world didn't give and the world can't take it away it's a real reality in that life that keeps them going steady through opposition through tests through trials through things that are sent against them through things that are done wrong but yet the joy of the lord is present there that their life is conducted that's where i can look at older ones and know if there's things that i've been through and here i have just you know just been walking with the lord for this time and there's others all along i say oh god thank you for my brother thank you for my sister because they have went through many battles how did they do it how did they do it how are you doing it here tonight and not sitting here full of bitterness and not sitting here full of resentment i'll tell you hi the grace of almighty god it's god's mercy that even when we had a right to set with resentment or bitterness but god rich in mercy would minister to our hearts and we say oh god i don't want that in my life [Music] this is where it comes the next part of the scripture but envy the rottenness of the bones this ain't something you can see right away you know what the scripture tells me about envy is that it's a conniving slick subtle devil it needs the spiritual mra mri of the skin of the holy ghost which is why we need the living word to discern our lives punish through a scan what to say what about this right here [Music] the reality when our life has been changed we don't want envy in our life we don't want things to be out of sorts in our life but you see how subtle there's such a subtlety the way the enemy can work that things sometimes can come in but thanks be to god that there is a living word that discerns the heart because god knows what our desire is is to please him above everything else so when we look at this the bible would say it like this in proverbs 3 31 envy thou not the oppressor and i'm just going to take here just for just just a moment here on that that that where of the things that we come in contact the things that we see on the outside and so forth but so i want you just to look at this here in the scripture because um the bible will expressly tell us in the book of thessalonians and we realize without that and we don't even need that written there it's just it's just the love of god and that is that we're to show that love toward all men it's not so well we love those you know uh who love me or i love those you know of our assembly aren't no we're to love all men that this is the scripture not meaning that we love look brother brown would say we don't love the sin but we love the sinner we don't love the sin but we love the sinner so here look what look look what here the the the writer by the spirit of god envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways so the oppressor is one who is oppressing and how that solomon would write this listen this wisdom of solomon is not solomon himself it's the wisdom of god that god has given to solomon and remember that was a time in israel where it was a time of peace in david there were wars that were fought is that right you see now in the time of solomon it was a time of peace as brother branham would put it it was that likened to that of a golden age like a time of a millennium there was wisdom here envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways simply put we are not of the world neither are we to act like the world acts or to respond like the world responds like dog eat dog we're not to respond in that way we're of a different kingdom the lord is our creator we're under it we're under a banner it's not a bender of hatred or malice or fear this is a banner of divine love and divine love realizes where was i when he came and found me and look where i am now i didn't make myself aware of that condition he came to me he picked me up he brought me where i am he gave me the strength he stimulated my faith to believe that i could be saved he moved upon my faith operated on it that i could receive him into my life tim it's him so here in thee thou not the oppressor this word means do not be jealous envious or zealous toward the oppressor choose none of his ways see the bible over and over we could come the bible says if they what does it say at the scripture if they sue you for your coat give them the other go ahead it's all right you say help me jesus you see all of these things how the scripture would say in the book of romans be not overcome with evil but overcome evil with good sometimes when it don't seem to be working ah that ain't working you had the wrong motive to begin with the motive was all about you making your life easier this is why if your motive's not right the word will not operate even in what you're doing is correct but your motive must be right in doing it is that right so the bible says but do good thereby you might heap coals of fire upon their head is that right it's not something we're doing out of vengeance but we recognize let me just tell you this let me just say this very clearly when jesus i'm just just you know just looking over these things and hear the lord jesus knowing that judas is the one to betray him and he says he that dippeth his hand in the sock with me jesus didn't cut him off true amen when polycarp was to be taken and they were after him they found where he was at polycarp was in the upstairs they came where he was at he made his captors sit down and he had a meal prepared for them are you with me the bible says then he asked me says would you mind if i go pray not the bible but history records this when you he went and prayed for not just one hour two hours and he prayed for his captors hallelujah they felt so ashamed should we take him apolly karp says i must go with you and talking about the stock we come from polycarp they did not have the revelation that god has given us in this hour and if what they had it wasn't less it wasn't weak it operated according to the anointing of the word that was upon their life and they responded according to the spirit of god they were under polycarp in them here they were under that that ox anointing they responded to the spirit of god operating in the word in that time amen my he served his enemies he prayed for them it's all right whether you're saying out loud or in your heart but we ought to be saying help me jesus help me lord because let me tell you something he didn't come from a different tree it's on that same tree of life that you and i are born of this is why we need the grace of god so greatly in our lives oh my god glory oh i love that mom you know polycarp i could just keep going but we need to move on here this is where the scripture would say choose none of his ways and romans 12 14 said bless them which persecutes you bless and curse not think of saul and david saul was the people's choice david was god's choice is that right god showed here a life that would be fit for the throne to rule david david never received it with a silver spoon in his mouth as a matter of fact when david david's desire was for israel it was for we say the body david went out there under the leadership of the lord and it fell on his ears who is this uncircumcised philistine making his bluff then we understand as what transpires but then you have then the women come out singing oh saul has killed his thousands david his ten thousands and right there you see this is why listen not just in the things i think how god was taking us last week but it's also very very much so that we you can never it's never to let down your guard but in always at all times say god help me to be sensitive to you you can hear things said or things you could say it's important to say god order my lips lord order the words that said at least i don't want to provoke anybody to hear i don't want to set up a condition where envy could set in and i don't want lord envy to set in on my life god uses god uses us and he uses every one of us according to his purpose god might prepare us brother iran tells us a man for just a moment's worth of work but that that part is just as vital as a person or man whomever that god would use countless time and time again god doesn't put one above another it's for us to be in our place oh my yes this is why we need the spirit of god as david you think with david it's a paradox i mean i don't know i don't know if i would go back to somebody's house if they were throwing things at me i mean you wouldn't say man i they love me that's why they're whipping them javelins at me no sir right i mean we're doing good enough if somebody disagrees with us let alone javelins but the bible says david escaped out of it and then the bible would say david would come back and submit it himself one thing that david listen this is where brother adam takes us in the message respects could look at saul but you never find david in the scriptures running saul down i saw him fit to be king what the world's he doing you see you know what he did to me you know you never find that you even find different ones to try to instigate and say hey here he is take his life you've already been anointed king look what he's doing to you he's running you down chasing you down like a dog treat you like this man come on this is your time but david's desire was to please god more than himself hallelujah this was a man after god's own heart this was a test before he come to the throne if he himself would be able to continue to look at saul in the right measure it's no doubt saul had lost his credibility as a king but david still recognized this is the office this man holds and that's why brother brown says no matter what office it is even if it's an office in a public place you're going to respect the office hello because if you don't do that where does it end we're not talking about when you agree with it where does it end amen we're tested whether you say a man or not we're tested i think the prophet showed exemplary character when everything happened in 1960 he showed exemplary character are you with me where he would take time and pray for the president even in what was disputed and was clearly laid out that was false but he still prayed all right these were not listen those things were not by chance he was laid out for you and i it's not putting brother branham here it's to show you and i this is the character of the message that you and i have received challenging yes it's challenging but god has prepared a people in this hour that their eyes are fixed on the rapture and they're under an anointing that i'm not going to let anything get in my way even a wrong feeling i'm not going to let that keep me out of the rapture [Music] what a paradox you know with david and saul but this was one who who god was preparing to put on the throne let me just let me look at this you see this is why brother branham would say let me just refer to this out of the message shalom the the first one that brother brown preaches there to the group of believers there in ceravista and brother branham makes a statement within there i i just just some time ago just taken with this now brother branham you know how it is when you hear something and it just it just resonates with you it just resonates with you it's just something that just you know when you look at oh god and you just say lord help me anybody been there i mean i'm not just listening to the message to be a a spectator i find myself no matter where it's at sometimes that maybe have to turn down another eye or or here i am and brother adam said oh god help me lord help me lord jesus brother brahms talks about the people he says it's a time that's upon the people that he said it's the most pathetic time he talked about he says how he says this is something he says that i've tried my best to that even in times of disagreeing he said sometimes where it's been very strong he said but if i couldn't at the end of it be able to shake hands with that individual and feel the same way he said then i know something's wrong with me brother brown would say it like this he says even after he says what's been said could be disagreeable or dishearten and you know this is one of the this is one of the things i mean i don't know where it's like sometimes we get in a thought well everybody's got to agree everybody don't have to agree everybody don't have to think the way you think hello well the agreement that we have to have is the agreement with the word of god that's an absolute there might be little things here or there that we disagree but just because i did disagree with you doesn't make me some sort of a wow this guy is really off his rocker no that's my that's where i stand is that right yes did you see this or brother brown would make a statement and he would say it in this manner he says he says you know and after something he said is said real sharp if i had one thought look at this if i had one thought that i didn't like that person let's separate it not that a thought came to him thoughts will come to you come on now this flesh is a place brother and described it even after you're born again there's a carnal sticky nature i don't know you know i'm taught my brother joey you walk through the woods sometimes even back here in other places sometimes i'm walking and there's certain things that get stuck there's certain little prickers and things and would anybody want to walk through a rose bush not at all would you want to walk through stickers no not at all you and i are a pile of stickers come on now that carnal sticky nature of the first birth that's why there's got to be a new birth on the inside where god takes that that that pucker boil he opens it up and he places that germ of wheat life on the inside you might look like a cocker barrel on the outside but inside it is weak life [Applause] hallelujah and that weak life on the inside is greater than that nature of the tucker barrel that was there hallelujah certain things sometimes get stick where are you get unstuck right don't let them accumulate on your life don't let things build up go through an unsticking process go through that of the word the washing of water by the word that'll help you and removing those things sometimes it gets stuck oh brother samuel i just can't wait till the time here where i'm unsticky oh you're wanting the body change i do too i do too but i'll tell you there's a way that you can help things so it's not so sticky that's the more we stay in the presence of god in fellowship with him the points aren't as sharp and catchy i said if i got one thought i don't like that person then i know one thing the spirit of christ has departed from me if i can feel that i don't like that person there's something wrong with me not the person something wrong with me so if he's departed what do i have to do become a lamb again is that brother brandon right think of here he says here he was he said i believe he said we're living in this time once again he said his own people jesus own people were driving the nails in his hand and he cried out and brother brahman emphasized with a heart full of love father forgive them they know not what they do and i'm telling you friends brother branham preached this message here in 64. darkness upon the people and brother brown makes it so clear in there said people they've lost their reasoning have people he says forgot they have they have the opportunity to make a choice between right and wrong we're living we're living in a time we've been seeing compiling we are living in a time it's a very pathetic thing but i'm telling you people do not realize the choices they're making let me just say this even while sitting in the house of god let alone the decisions that they're making out there it's choices that we have that's before us it's a pathetic time to where that it's to to recognize people don't know what they're doing they they wouldn't make the decisions they're making it's spirits it's spirits that's at work and i'll say it to you like this don't try to reason with them are you with me you're off of your god-given ground don't try to reason with them don't try to explain it let me tell you something there's a lot of things things that are present in this world right now let me tell you what brought it sure satan came and brought hurts and everything else and all these things then he comes right around and exploits those things and everything is division divisiveness division divisiveness they ought to be the spirit of god within our heart united with jesus christ that says my heart is for that man or for that woman my heart is for my brother or for my sister amen are you with me brent said i don't believe that people know what they're doing said they become such a subject to evil until it's a pathetic thing we're living in a time where good is called evil and evil is called good yes we're here i said we've we've arrived what you want to make sure is that you're standing on the side of the word i'm not interested in trying to prop up the world i'm interested in leaving it you're saying brother samuel let your ambition be set completely on god on his word on his working lord i'm ready and i want to continue to make ready to go see this is where even when the lord jesus as they came remember his his face i want you to catch this i'm not i'm not going to put this up there but remember when he was going by samaria he had set his face to go to jerusalem there was a purpose he was going to jerusalem not just for the feast of the passover but he was going there this was a journey where this was going to take him there wasn't going to be entering into jerusalem and a leaving now here was coming to the climax of the purpose of his life and here he comes into a situation the conditions that are around and they in samaria wouldn't receive him those around him listen to me those around him what did they say lord what do you want us to do should we call fire down out of heaven and consume them as elias did big difference elijah was not operating out of a selfish motive amen though they were walking with the word made flesh they still had selfish motives hello and that's not elijah elias did not call fire down to consume people that didn't agree with him as a matter of fact the mercy of god even in that time where god threw elijah by the word he prayed for israel did not even call him jacob he prayed a prayer that could say condemnation can be released from israel in this hour he called for the fire to fall you see he was in complete harmony with god and the fire came down to do what vindicate the living god what they were wanting had nothing to do with god it had everything to do with we haven't been accepted so because we haven't been accepted let me see what promise we can use against them see how you see how how look you see how that first nature and how that first part you can always try to use things to try to conveniently jesus said the son of man has not come to destroy lives but save amen proverbs 23 17 look at the scripture says let not thine heart in these sinners you catch it let not your heart right out here it could seem er but remember your heart right this is why the bible says the heart is deceitful above all things but i the lord try it this is why david said search me o god yes lord let not let not thine heart envy sinners not this ain't all about saints right it said sinners but be thou in the fear of the lord all the day long this is the remedy boy i'm gonna get a lot of amens on it but i'm gonna preach it amen envy do not be zealous boiled up can you believe all right be not envy not the center why they're just simply acting like a sinner hello somebody hey that's why you know you don't condemn the drunkard for drinking he's a drunkard hello somebody they're only doing what they are but be thou in the fear and in the reverence of the lord all the day long for surely there is an end and dying expectations shall not be cut off i tell you i love this statement brother branham makes in the church age book just looking at this here the whole of the christian life is to be in the spirit john son i was in the spirit on the lord's day paul said if we're going if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit amen amen let's read this here in psalms 37 i i just couldn't get away from this it's just been so i had it down just to refer but i want to just couldn't get away from from reading that's so pressed on my heart i want you to look at this here in the scripture in psalms 37 a psalm of david fret not thy south because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity this is david's admonition but not david is the spirit of god notice this was a psalm of david or a psalm of samuel psalm of brian psalm of joey you know what that meant this is me this is for me god gave this for me it's a psalm of drake psalm for me this is what david had to live when he ran from cave to cave when he couldn't even live in israel had to flee to the philistine country was not accepted there but david didn't get his sights he didn't become overtaken you think of times that david didn't cry he didn't weep he looked at things he looked at conditions i'll tell you he cried and he wept no doubt many times he wept himself to sleep but he had a promise there was an anointing upon his life he didn't know how he was going to get to the throne but he knew i'd been anointed for rapture and that's what kept him that's what drove him that's what kept david and gave authority to force everything else out of his life and if david a man without the holy ghost because it hadn't been given yet could live that kind of a life devoted to god how much more when we who have been purchased by his blood and filled with his holy spirit neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green earth look at this in verse 3 trust in the lord i'm not going to be much longer but the engine's a little worn right now trust in the lord feels good though trust in the lord and do good amen wait a minute dave wait a minute david you mean when everything's going my way there's no evil doers there's no wicked you're wanting the millennium right now that you can have something greater you can have the life of the future home inside of you and as a delicate give witness i'm a pilgrim and a stranger in this land when the holy ghost has come you can even school you can even say to that old nature that old tree i'm a pilgrim and stranger i'm not of you amen i'm not of you that used to be the way that i act but no more there's been a change on the inside glory look at this trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the lord i'm telling you god's talking tonight these this portion of scripture i just had a reference to it but i couldn't get away from this even though it deals within me but and the more as i look at this delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of the heart you've got to be careful what your desires are god will give you the desires of your heart he gave bala what his desires were god asked him and finally god said go ahead that's what's in your heart go ahead and do it and they'll say praise god i got a yes after 35 no's but god was finally saying you know what i've told you no once that should be enough but that's what's in your heart go to it right david balaam didn't have discernment right but that ass had discernment you know why it was redeemable hallelujah he could recognize the presence of god he could recognize god speaking it might have been regarded as a foolish dumb animal but remember it could recognize the god standing there hallelujah i believe there's a god part in my life that can recognize there's a path then maybe you could be going a certain way but the god part steps up and says stop amen delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass what what you've committed and he shall bring forth thy righteousness who will bring it forth he will as the light and thy judgment as the noon day rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass this word rest in the lord sometimes you know when you you just okay rest this word rest here means to become as one who is dumb it's the same word that is used when joshua said son stand still stand still it's where it just rests stays what in position staying in step onward christian soldiers not yet oh what's going on over there oh my can you where you turn your head your feet will follow if you get your eyes off the prize this is why paul said his eyes was on the prize yes looking unto jesus who's the author and finisher of our faith sing say look it isn't all together we're sinful things it's sometimes our attention can get off of what we need to have it on and what you look at will either bring you peace or trouble it ain't god's fault when it brings you trouble it's your fault and my fault because we're looking at the wrong thing hello somebody oh god i want peace stop feeding on the wrong things here feed on those things that bring peace brother samuel i can't help it yes you can that's a lie of the devil you are given to be able to control what your eyes look at what your ears hear and what you express and entertain and if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you've got a dynamite on the inside that's able to explode out hurtful resentful hateful feelings you see satan's desire is to make you an ineffectual christian he'll use whatever means he can to be has though done just standing resting in the lord cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit not the world i don't want the world but we inherit the earth i don't want the world i'm not of the world i've been delivered from that i don't want its corruption i don't want its system i don't want that of the world but we shall inherit the earth amen this is a place where the bride of jesus christ is going to inhabit not only during the millennium when that system will change you know god will even allow it to be in the millennium just even in a change of administration and when other parts will even be raised in that time remnants that have been left that have come up against that of israel and god will even is show and display in that time that even an administration an administration over the earth can have such an effect to bring peace where the plow shears where swords will be built in the plowshares where things are changed where people don't get sick this is in the millennium where there's even a harmony among nations and among people i'm glad to be serving a god and to know him in a personal way that he does that work right now inside of our life and that same god that's done that work that's resolved these things in our life is the same god that's taking us into a place of the millennium and into the future home wherein dwelleth righteousness don't let anything don't sell it short for nothing they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea they shall diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth amen me means give place to dwight moody walking down the street and the man stood right in his way and just mocking him he wasn't going to move the white moody you've heard the story he tipped his hat walked off the sidewalk walked all around because the guy said i don't get out of the way for fools dwight moody said i always do you know walked on around you're not going to be entertained with that that's right the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace i do not believe that we just have to wait to the millennium to delight ourselves in the abundance of peace jesus said my peace i leave you yes not a peace that the world giveth right but this is the real peace that peace that's from him he is the prince of peace but notice the admonition that's in here delight thyself in the lord commit thy ways unto him trust in the lord you see just in those three verses just in that three alone right there it brings into a place of our focus and where we need to be sure have jobs and other places i'm talking about sinners and these things out here have has there been times where things have come our way sure and no doubt if times carries there's things that will come our way but we're not the first we're not the first we're not even right now even when we consider our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world they are they experience oppression that you and i do not experience as of yet are you with me and whatever degree that we will and whatever all of those things that's in god's hands but you recognize our desire what god would speak don't fret yourself with the evil doers why charity envious not let me leave you with this point i can't get no further than this but let me leave you with this one still dealing with that on the outside i can't get to the inside psalm 73 this psalm has been one of those psalms that was years ago one of the first winter youth retreats i ever did i came in and got in there at the time brother burley williams was preaching that night and he preached out of this chapter never forgot it you know it's one of those servants that just so how the spirit of god took brother burley and began to work with the young people that night and deal with it's one of those things that's never it never never left me not the memory so much of it but as it spoke as god spoke in that hour and as it deals with in psalm 73 it's a psalm of asa asaph is a is the chief musician in that of of that of of among the musicians that was there within jerusalem he's a chief musician so in other words he's one that would have i don't want to just say stature but he but he has a responsibility it's not just you know he has a responsibility even in and you know worship and music and things like that and every one of us have a responsibility too and here's what asaph says truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well and i slipped asap's still showing up still leading singing or you know still going he's going on but what is he telling us his feet his ground that was under him he had almost slipped once you appreciate somebody to be honest why why was this verse three for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked first thing he's got wrong he's looking at the wrong thing and he's looking at it in the wrong way he's looking at it in envy how can this be how can they prosper and what he doesn't realize is his footing it's starting to slip it might just started to slip just a little inch his prayer life started to kind of go aside his time of really maybe focusing of his family him and his wife maybe children on the right things he got to looking at this and he started to focus on the wrong things let me just say this very clearly let me say very clearly the message of the hour that god has sent did not just restore us to the faith of this hour unto the faith that was once delivered to the saints but it also addressed issues that were present it addressed how we are to respond brother samuel are you getting ready are you storing up food i've been storing up food spiritually i'm not planning on being here hello god that has provided for me up to this day he'll provide for me all the way through that has never been a direction in the message of the hour but if you listen to the wrong source you'll find yourself preparing for something that the message has never pointed us to what are you telling me watch your feet watch your feet yes yes that your feet do not slip the same i thought this on love it is on love charity envious not it's to steam the rapture above everything else when we esteem the rapture above everything else to esteem the lord to esteem his presence to esteem that of one another the love of god and brother a lot of other things it loses sight if there's one thing that we ought to be storing up on we ought to be storing up more of jesus and the other thing we ought to be emptying up a lot of our own selves god help me let me be as light as i can be is that right for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked now you can read this psalm when you go home but asaph he begins to see everything he sees them even of how the wicked they he says you know there's no bonds in their death they just the way that they just kind of go through life they they pride themselves they're puffed up and everything else they act as though there's no god he's seen all this but the problem is is that he's not realizing it it's overtaking him and god's letting him know they're going the way they're going but don't you oh i love this verse 16 and 17 we'll close when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then i understood their end where in the sanctuary of god in the presence of god in a spiritual mri that god was moving upon asaph asaph you know he's my singing oh love of god how rich and pure how can they be doing that they shouldn't be how measureless and strong oh my goodness i cannot believe it's shall for a7 what you're singing about and what you're doing isn't matching up what's happening asap's not even realizing his feet is slipping the ground that he should be standing on where he should be positioned from within is slipping but here's where the love of god comes on display he can't understand it how is this going on but god comes as a scan oh lord i thought it's going to be an x-ray no x-rays sometimes we'll pick this up what'd you have to do well i had to shoot some spiritual dye i had to have have him minister certain things so that he would see and when it gets in there it pops it up and there it shows right there on the scan but as a believer of the lord you say lord purge cleanse me lord jesus help me lord god let me how do i get from that lord by focusing on me delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart say lord let every desire of my heart be for you trust in the lord with all thine heart commit thy way oh my don't you love him let's pray heavenly father truly oh love of god how rich and pure lord as i looked at this lord even in psalms 37 as i expressed to him i couldn't get that off my heart but lord you know that where you placed this on my heart it's it's set here though studied on and on but it's been there lord god for weeks if not for months and where this has been dear god is you would see to it that here in this service tonight that lord you would you would have me to bring it lord we stand in need of you and father as we see lord god is these examples these are things that are not lord dealing with so much within the church among the body of believers these scriptures lord here tonight that we were able to get to it deals with oppressors it deals with things lord that come on the outside that we experience the lord jesus as you've so mentioned to us so clearly we realize lord there is no weakness inside of you lord when the new birth has come there's no weakness in the new birth but what it does is it shows up the weakness in our humanity it shows that lord we need you we need the living word to come and lord to discern our hearts to discern our lives sometimes lord wrong thoughts wrong feelings lord things like this we look at asaph now lord perhaps a person could say and make the the argument and say well that's just the old testament but no we recognize lord god it still speaks to us even in that part of humanity are things lord god that i couldn't even get to that brother brown himself would go into and deal with things that he was recognizing [Music] lord jesus i always think of how your prophet when he says it there and there's a series of meetings in 1962 in grass valley california jehovah jireh he talks about what a success those meetings were and he narrowed it down to one statement he said it's because there were honest hearts that when god was dealing with their hearts they were honest and it invited you lord this is i believe here tonight lord i trust lord this is what you find honest hearts hearts that are lord god open or able to say yes lord help me lord i need help lord i need strength lord god i realize lord god that though it may not have showed on the outside but it's true envy is the rottenness of the bones it can show up what's on the inside that if it's not really addressed it can affect relationships first of all to affect our walk with you lord it'll affect everything else around us help us lord lord we're living in a world that's filled with bitterness filled with hatred lord god a world that preaches tolerance but it actually is intolerance it's hatred lord jesus you knew we would be here in this hour we don't need another message we just need more of you lord more of you lord than god in more of ourselves more of our lives that we might surrender more and more to you lord we're not perfect in ourselves but in christ our redeemer we are complete in you lord lord jesus as that oil is within the dove a dove doesn't have to take a bath but there's oil that comes from the inside out that oil comes from deep within and it's able to remove all that dirt and things that can come up on those feathers so it can fly lord jesus here this evening this is our desire lord is that that oil of god lord god the holy spirit in our lives [Music] lord he would come move to the forefront lord as we step behind and allow lord that to move cleanse lord and clean out any anything that's tried to take a hold lord or jesus things that we experience things that we go through but father you're faithful lord help us lord to take that admonition that example of the scripture that is asaph would give that personal testimony perhaps it would be like asaph standing up in an assembly and he would admonish us as believers as we read from that tonight would be so open to let us know he got his eyes if we could say eyes or emotions so tied to the wrong thing his feet almost slipped out from under him help us lord i pray dear god may you just move lord god upon every heart move in every life minister to our needs lord we're a needy people [Music] oh god how we thank you lord thank you for your love thank you for the love of god lord jesus we appreciate you lord in the name of jesus christ let's sing the song i want to live oh i want to live the way that he wants me to [Music] i want to there's just no more love for i could never ever [Music] he wants [Music] just no more to give [Music] no more love for i could never [Music] and i keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again [Music] over and over and over and over [Music] over and over and over again over and over and over every day with jesus [Music] every day with jesus [Applause] jesus saves and keeps me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] jesus saves and keeps me and he's the one i'm waiting for every day with jesus think when situations arose in the early church right after they had received the holy ghost different ones were taken prison prisoner the spirit of god they were so in tune with the holy ghost till when different ones were rising up herod and things like that they were so inspired the spirit of god would direct them to psalms 2. why did the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing for truly the rulers are rose up against the lord and his christ they recognize present conditions things that are taking place this was prophesied but what what was their response what did they pray for lord grant that with all boldness that thy name might be glorified that was stretching forth the hands the sick might be healed they their attention it turned things opposition came that was identified the scripture but they said god granted that your name would be glorified souls would be saved the sick would be healed those that are oppressed to be delivered oh my this is how the spirit of god how he responds in times of crisis say lord how about you i'm available lord i'm available lord this is this is my desire the conditions they were prophesied we would be in these conditions but in the midst of this time right here god said i will make myself known as a mighty god oh my don't you love him hallelujah amen glory every day with jesus [Music] jesus [Music] i wanna be ready to [Music] be go [Music] i wanna be ready to stay like this i'm gonna be [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] i wanna be ready to go [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] joy [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] god bless you you're dismissed [Applause] keep me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] keep me shouting oh give me joy my soul i pray [Applause] keep me shouting till the break [Music] okay [Applause] [Applause] he gives me peace in the midst of my storms [Music] yes he's my anchor [Music] [Applause] he gives me peace
