or email him and uh just a song that's on your heart uh you'd like to sing a testimony so we just uh just thankful for that opportunity and then we have uh brother Trevor and sister Anna May here with us and it's so good to have them here and so we're certainly looking forward to that here on Sunday yes sir and uh we certainly have been we certainly have been blessed when brother Trevor has been here with us and uh man I tell you last January was wonderful you don't uh remember it was just a just some wonderful wonderful time in the presence of the Lord wonderful things that were said and um so we just want to be in prayer for that as well for the Sunday morning and then the um the youth service that evening and I just want to encourage you I I want to say this I so appreciate I see different ones you make the effort to be here to support the young people I want to say thank you I've tried to reach out in different ones and just to commend that and because that to me is very important uh it's things that uh we want to we want to see and we want to encourage and I want to say God bless you thank you for that amen I know the young people really appreciate that too and it just we want to create an atmosphere uh the young people that are coming they they want to be here and uh you know different ones of parents that they ask uh we've had them you know where they're driving across the state to be here and uh they they want to be here but we want to be part of that to create an atmosphere you know brother brand tells us he said that uh you may not be the prophet but you might be the minstrel that we're just to bring the spirit of God down that the Lord can begin to move and that's what we're interested in because that's what this message came to bring us is a reality of a living God yes sir that is not just something that is what we know by letter but we know a living God who lives and operates in us and through our lives a real relationship and so we we thank God for that and I want to say God bless you let's uh prepare let's turn into the word of the Lord tonight I want to say musicians thank you and and it's good to have different ones back and uh different ones of the recruits out of sick Bay and back with us and um I tell you it's been it hasn't just been here I'll I'll say this to you um I didn't mention this I don't think on Sunday but it was quite quite uh astounding that when I went my wife sent me out for the supplies because by God's grace at least as far as I know I didn't get sick but I get so I'm the supply Runner and I go to the the story I show up at Myers and you know she's got the list of all the stuff you get for when you're not feeling well you know popsicles Box chicken noodle soup and all that stuff you know so I go to the chicken noodle soup aisle you know and I look in there and uh the the Shelf now we're not talking Walmart we're talking Myers Myers stocks it was it was empty and so my wife I said honey every shelf with the chicken noodle is empty I said so this isn't just us I said this is all around and it it truly has been all around the area I know that uh brother um Trevor and them and brother Nathan they've they had it uh right before I think right before Christmas or right coming through Christmas and then right after yeah yeah so it's just a presence but not the kind of presence you're looking for you know so but we thank the Lord for his mercies you know it's just reminders we're here in these bodies and we're just passing through and uh you know so we just thank the Lord for his mercy and strengthening us and bringing us back together his touch and uh so let's look here in in the scriptures in verse 13 I want to go a little bit further we we just finished out the part there on looking at in his hands and the right hand and the left hand of God uh I want to look here in verse 13 job sorry Job chapter 23 did I not say that I didn't say it ah we should have had eye contact because if you would have just said yeah you said it then we could have you know either given Brother Ray demerits or tardy or put him in the corner Job chapter 23:3 I have it right here in front of me sorry about that you all are gracious to me so Job chapter 23 and verse 13 job said but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me thank and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence now I want you to notice these words therefore am I troubled at his presence when I consider means to ponder or think I am afraid of him for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face and i' just like to just speak to you here just a few moments we'll start into it here tonight but on the thought of having the right perception having the right perception so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer tonight if you have a need on your heart just make it known to the Lord and let's just invite him to come and just just speak to us let's pray for one another Heavenly Father Lord we are just so thankful for this privilege that you've granted us Lord thank you for Lord just touching Lord my brothers and sisters Lord different ones Lord as you're still moving Lord God upon the bodies Lord of different ones and in their Spirit Lord I pray that God for every one of these requests Lord father from cancer Lord to sickness Lord from the flu or other Lord infirmities we're thankful Lord that you are the Lord that Health all our diseases and we rest in that Lord as your children it is our bread Lord and we want to say thank you Lord and we ask that God tonight that you would just help us together Lord that we could just be one unit Lord that the spirit of God would just take control Lord say what needs to be said Lord and just let me to know Lord when it's been enough and ween just want to be obedient to you Lord whatever the path and channel that you would have us to go in that's what we want to do father we ask that you'll just minister to our hearts now in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated tonight I just looking at this some time ago and that thought struck me on on perception and when you consider uh the word perception it's a way of regarding understanding or interpreting something it's a mental impression of something and I'm certain that we have all um no doubt been at a point in time where we've had um a perception about something and maybe sometimes we've had a perception that we thought for sure that our perception was as it were thus sayith the Lord and then we find out come to the place to realize my perception was not right and we can understand that there are things that as a Believer this is something as a Believer is that we as Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God there's some there's things about our life to where that we even no matter where how far you've come in your journey you know never to put a period on God and even in situations that sometimes where we don't have a definitive we might think and a lot of times we can think maybe we understand or know what's going on but like we looked at here for multiple parts that job himself did not know and still even in the portion of scripture we're reading here he job does not come to really understand till it gets clear to the end and God lets him know that he's been bringing job through a process the whole time and so job when we're looking at this of having the right perception it truly when we want to we always want to have the right perception that's the desire of our life but uh you know when you have sometimes the the perception and if it's not just exactly right it can have an effect Upon Our Lives you can have a perception you know sometimes of maybe how you think you know a person thinks about you or feels about you and they haven't even said anything like that at all but yet you'll look at things and and if you'll study things well I'm looking at body language and I'm looking at this and you know if you're not careful and you start entertaining that very long you'll start acting differently towards that person just based on your perception that's right and so we understand this is important and it's God's desire there's no way that you and I could actually have the right perception even concerning the things that are around us we could not even have the right perception of God had God himself not come and made himself known to you and I in a personal way and I want you to notice that every time that when job when here back and forth with elifas bildad and each of them the difference is even when job here in the midst of what he's expressing job is expressing that he knows God as a person I know him he when he had the way that God would would speak to him God maketh my heart he maketh my heart soft he is of one mind and who can turn him and he performthe job it's such a it's such a difference when you know God as a real living person and you know for a Believer let me just drop back on this for a moment as a Believer we are not required to understand everything but what we what we need what we have to understand God gives it to us as we have need of it and these are the times and moments in our life just like when brother Brandon would tell us in the message Shalom and he would refer back to the things that took place in his life with little Sharon Rose and hope and and brother Bram says I learned he said at that moment he said down through this journey that things that I could not understand to put my hand in his hand and trust him I think that's the greatest compliment that we can do is when we don't know what to do what's most important is to trust him because he knows what he's doing and so when I read this here with job you see you see things you know coming out of job that would be expressions and I I I think I've mentioned this before that when you read through the Book of Job to me it's almost like there's eruptions of Faith Like a volcano from down deep within that you'll look and say Here's this man saying this but then there's something that said in the midst of it that you know it's coming from somewhere deep within him and that's a part that within us that even when brother Bram himself standing there and his little girl was was being taken and his wife was being taken and brother brandham tells us he says it like this he says when God wouldn't talk to me he said then Satan moved right up next to me and Satan began to talk to me and want to tell me and went through a whole Litany of things to where that even brother ra said his thoughts he said he said I began to think about that and he said every bit of reasoning was going right along with him and saying that's the truth that's the truth he says I was about ready to say if that's the way he's going to be that's he said but there was something that come from somewhere deep down inside of me and I tell you that's the anchor and the hope of a believer is a real relationship with God to where that even in the times that our reasoning has given way when our reasoning itself and we look back and say how did I even entertain that thought how did I even maybe to express something in this in this way uh but then there's something that's down there that's an anchor that's more real than any situation it's more real than anything else around us there's no other way to explain it but God and so when I think of this of how the effect that job even when he would say in job 13 and verse 15 listen these very familiar words to us but job would say though he slay me yet will I trust him I will maintain my own ways shall be my salvation that's where did that come from deep down [Applause] within Glory he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before him amen think about this that here is job standing with such a a true Revelation which the prophet would let us a GL give us a glimpse into it in an age remember brother Brandon was being told by so many people of we got to get the translation right we got to understand the words right we got to do this right brother R said they've been arguing about this for ages he said what is needed is a fresh Revelation from the spirit of God because we don't need thoughts of man we needed God's thoughts and God knew what you and I would need in this hour and God would bring such a Clarity to you and I that we could have by the grace of God the right perception of the day of the hour of the events that we see taking place around us do you realize how blessed you are to have that understanding there's people I just walked by brush shoulders with here this week and they were standing around and saying I don't understand where all this transgender stuff I don't understand with these things I don't understand why why this is why can't things go back to how it was in World you know before World War II and you know there's a lot of people seeing it and I just say it like this those things like that is not necessarily the majority but you have people wondering and looking what's taking place but we understand it's seeds that's been sown that is coming to fruition right there are seeds that was swn clear back uh even before the 1900s when you study the feminist movement it goes clear back there I studied that some time before and in depth and bringing it up and there are things seeds but it was it scripture that is has already been prophesied over this generation prophecy can't fail and I thank God that God would give us Grace because with having the right perception then it affects us in our lives in our walk before God and so the most important thing this is why brother Bram could say the most important thing is he says job andam didn't even have a written bible but he said the most important thing we know the stars and so forth but he said they knew God by Revelation and that's the most important thing amen that's what's more important than being able to explain and listen friends I believe we ought to be in the word of God I believe we should Avail listen there are men that gave their lives so this could be put in our hands I believe that I I believe there's anything maybe this a side note but we'll drop it in free I believe if there's something that even this year let it become a habit in your life if it's something to aware that you know even of the reading of the word of God praying over the word of God getting into the message of the hour and and don't set unrealistic goals like I'm going to I'm going to read the whole Book of Leviticus on this coming Thursday no just look there's even plans out there that'll break it down for you and just so you don't think I'm overshooting I've been using a plan for years you know why so I don't get sidetracked and start studying it's a truth all it takes is one little moment but I I want that time I want that time if there's something I'll make a little note I'll come back to that when I'm done right here because I want to Avail myself in the word of God and I think that's that's something that we all have even an access to and may God help us to do that brother BR says when he starts out for the new year he says in this is revelation series for the new year he says you know he says let's make it a habit of getting into our Bibles amen he said let's make it a habit of praying he said you know and he talks about how you establish habits I mean we've all come up with habits sometimes we can get into bad habits you know you can get into everybody says oh I I got to change my eating habits we got to change and it's so easy to get in certain habits right so God may God help us so don't let the devil condemn you when you're trying to set up a new habit and a good habit don't make the enemy make you feel like that oh this is just FL FL L well sure I have to use my flesh to open the Bible and I'm going to read the word of God yeah I need to borrow my hands yes I have to use my mind I'm going to open the word of God but then we know the enemy's tactics yes I have to do these things I may have to say you know what I'm going to move right through it and maybe you have maybe you have somebody read it to you while you're while you're looking at it Whatever It Is Just Avail yourself in the word of God the prophet tell us he said no believer is more strong longer than his knowledge of and his adherence to the pure word of God so good so it's something to where job could have such a revelation of where he was standing with God that he could discern when his friends were coming around and accusing him you see this just wasn't people who were off the street passing by but these are people who knew Job they had actually watched job in action where job said remember in one place he said I'm now a byword among the people at one time I was a Tabet in other words job was one they sought for to come and wisdom and job would give them words of encouragement now when I look at this in in spite of all of that where job was standing and able to discern that and withstand all of that yet and with having such a grip on God but yet his perception about what was taking place let me just read a few scriptures I've read from some of these places here before but let's just let me just take a few words of job here in job 9:1 he said Lo he goeth by me and I see him not he passeth on also but I perceive him not remember he's a prophet and God's not re not God has not given job inspiration to understand what's going on that's right and the prophet said that's causing him to worry behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou if God will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under him you see his perception for he breakthe with the Tempest and multipli my wounds without cause he will not suffer me to take my breath but filth me with bitterness let him take his Rod away from me and let not his ter his fear terrify by me then would I speak and not fear him but it is not so with me job 108 thine hands speaking to the Lord thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dust destroy me here's a man that has a grip on God but his perception of what is taking place is wrong you see friends that's why that's why that anchor on the inside is so much greater because when our thinking is wrong that seal that cannot be broken let me just put it this way it's temper prooof Hallelujah that that makes me want to have a little spell right here and rejoice job 16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly and turn me over into the hands of the wicked you know there's a measure of truth to this oh yes there's a measure of Truth to that scripture I just read God hath delivered but not the way job's thinking I was at ease but he hath broken me aunder he all he hath also taken me up by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark his archers Compass me round about he cleaveth my rains suer and do not spare he porth out my gall upon the ground he breakthe with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant job 196 know now that God hath overthrown me and hath compassed me with his net a net meaning I can't get out behold I cry out wrong but I'm not heard I cry aloud but there's no judgment he hath fenced up my way way that I cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head he hath destroyed me on every side and I am gone and my hope hath he removed like a tree wow he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counted me unto him as one of his enemies he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaint ANS wife children Maids on and on are verily estranged from me this is Job's perception now I don't know about you but I I will just say it this way God had this recorded for me God had this recorded for me because this this whole this whole part as we've been looking at this in the Book of Job it really comes into a whole expanse that even speaks of the whole coming of redeeming work of the Lord Jesus it speaks of an end time work as well and how God will unfold things but yet here is job no why look God knows what's true why didn't God just break in on any one of these other chapters even right at the beginning and say job job ho ho ho you've got it all wrong right why didn't even God send somebody job's way to encourage him and say job you're thinking wrong right but his perception God was permitting it job doesn't know this and I know we've rehearsed this over and over but it's very fitting job does not know that this situation taking place it was not Satan calling God's attention it was God saying have you considered job let let let me tell you about my boy right probably when we look at that right now we're thinking Lord I want to be I I want to be in your um you know on the front of your refrigerator I want to be in the bragging but if it's like this then I prefer brother Bill I prefer Brother Ray I prefer I prefer my brother right you see we would our thinking that's why job job doesn't have any thought oh God was bragging on me no he doesn't know and think of it God didn't even step in of all these times and say hey hey you're thinking wrong you know why God was wanting to show the confidence that he had in a Believer and what I'm talking about a Believer was not the Flesh of job it was that part that came out out of God that word is what God had confidence in that's why the prophet in this age could go in with such Clarity in the message Victory Day and say when God allows a test to come your way he is showing he has confidence in you God letting us know this listen to this listen in the impact of this this perception familiar place out of three kinds of Believers brother B says as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped now I don't matter what side of the Mason diction you're on whipped whooped it's the same thing beat up beat down you you we we get it right he was whipped yes because Satan had been talking to him now think of this is to me the parallel Satan could stand there and cause job to look at situations and say God's doing this to you God's against you and yet job could stand there when all the other accusations were coming and job knew I have not there's not one thing unconfessed I have made my confession there I stand on the burnt offering there's not one thing that God has asked me to do but I haven't done it that even means when he has brought conviction and I've repented of my wrongs there's nothing hallu nothing pise God and he could stand Resolute like that but here Satan's coming and wanting to make him think I tell you our thoughts and our mind this is why when brother Brandon would preach that greatest battle ever fought and he would Minister on that sure he's speaking to us to get that battle down on the inside that war like we're looking at on Sunday get that war ceased but then out from there it comes through every other channel it's working through every phase and every part of our life this is why brother BR says even for those that sick and he refers to a situation in a tabernacle he says there is Satan he said and he'll sit right there in front of you in your mind and say you can't be well it's not for you you're not going to get well God's not going to meet your need that's you say well here I am we're the Bride of Jesus Christ Satan does not look at our church doors and say oh guess I can't go in there no the enemy comes and he likes to try to distract your mind that's right it's why he'll try to take your mind out there then he'll try to take certain things of the word and say that's not you why he knows if I can just get to change that that perception a little bit because the power is in receiving the word of God remember it's not our thoughts that has life in it it's God's word by taking that into our mind that is what has life that's right yes sir and that has life and that's what we want to receive that's why we come to the house of God lord I want to receive your thoughts that's what I want I want his thoughts if I've got thoughts right now that Lord that I'm not thinking about something the right way or maybe I'm a little low in my thoughts Lord I got an expectation your thoughts are higher than my thoughts and as a Believer as a son and daughter of God we are led by the spirit of God if I'm in a valley he'll lead me out he's faithful he's a Shepherd amen that's true ra goes on in that same paragraph and said it was it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it the very next paragraph watch this I love this he says and the same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things is your God trying to put punishment upon you same devil we've got the same adversary brother Brian called him a sleo foot like the one sister said he's a good adversary It Isn't So brother said no sir he said it's Satan doing it and God permitting it to temper you to make you see look not to make God see to make you see if you are tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven for wherever your treasure is there you are also your heart is where your Treasures are so you see it it ain't about are you hearing me now it ain't about what the devil says you judge it from your heart where is your heart my heart is he is my God I am his son I am his daughter I am am is she I want to please him more than anything else then bring that thought and make it bow subject to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's written across your heart Hallelujah to think of it in this way oh yeah we understand that correction can come as Believers and as what what believer really what of which one of us when things come do we not evaluate our life if you don't you should it should not just be assumed that everything that comes our way well this is a trial and and God's making something God God will not waste time that's true but sometimes there's things that can be called trials that aren't trials they're simply moments of Correction where we've gotten off the path and God's trying to help us to see hey wait a minute start out with this ver what brother BR very simple and be certain of God every time over and over what did Brother bam tell us one principle go back and and remember as that little lady came out she came out and there was two sticks and here when she came and got them two sticks she and herself the way that even she had been feeling and looking at things brother Ram tells us like this goes into it she had been praying God had been silent it seem seemed like God had not been hearing her prayer and she walks out there in the yard picks up those sticks and as she picks up them sticks to make that cake here she hears a voice say make me a cake first oh first she had no idea that God had sent his Prophet down there and she was a vessel that was going to feed the prophet God said I've commanded a widow woman to sustain thee she had no idea of that but what principle are we talking about brother Bram would tell us and be certain of God you go and you evaluate your life evaluate your life well how do I evaluate my life where do I even begin begin and look at seeing who and what is really first place in your life if you can look and esteem not just by we say but by our actions and all that we're doing if God is truly first in our life amen then we can judge it by that but if there's things like let's say it don't matter about coming to the house of God it don't matter about praying don't matter about reading it don't matter anything things like that then I would start right there and say Lord if there's things coming my way instead of me calling into a trial I need to First examine have I been putting all of God's word first you see it isn't leaving it out here to where we can just shape it up and shape God to make him any way that we want to make him that is not the perception that God has given you and I Jesus Christ has been evidently set before us so it's important that in our lives that we evaluate everything and if he's not first and I think we need need to make him first if somehow you've got things out of line you better get it right back in order the prophet will say it two times in the message that the law of overcoming is God first your family second yes somehow sometimes I know that family gets in front of God we get under this that we're going to be you know the philanthropist and the Samaritan and you know I'm just going to I I'm just going to love my family I don't need to go to the house of God I'm just going to no how you going to show them God and not come into the house of God you've got the order of overcoming wrong the prophet said God first family second and you last my Lord that's free but job this is this is you see it's things God doesn't complicate it it's us it's us God wants Fellowship God wants to walk with us live live in us he wants to talk with us God desires that because that's what we were brought here for now think of it job was actually as the prophet tells us he was whipped in his thoughts I don't know how the way the prophet just said it in such a way that I think it's it's simple for us to understand it he was whipped in his thoughts in other words he was defeated this is why you hear job expressing the things that he's already expressed in these verses of scripture this is no doubt why Peter in 1 Peter chapter 4:12 even after Calvary Peter would write beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you now I'm sure that we've got this memorized if we we we've got it memorized so much that we could probably put stars around borders on our house and we know this by heart but yet how many times when things come our way and I'm not talking about at first things can come our way and we think where in the world just coming from maybe I'll just preach to me okay I I'll try to say it and I'll turn around and try to receive it or or something but maybe it's just me but sometimes when you first look at certain things after you you've evaluated you look at it and we can and let's just be honest sometimes we get the feeling sorry for ourselves yes maybe maybe you don't but I do get the feeling sorry I don't want to go through this or what who wants to go through a test or a trial I mean I'm not looking for a signup sheet like testimonies and singing on Saturday night hey Lord I'll be the next one this week for a trial no sir buddy I know that God knows what trials I have need of I need his grace to bring me through what I'm dealing with right now I need that because God knows what he wants to mold and bring out of my life and God helped me in the meantime to have the right perception amen that's my desire not to think it's strange meaning to be surprised astonished at the novelty or the strangest of a thing to be shocked you know brother R would spend many time much time on this in the church Church ages of how he says the untutored believer struggles at some of these things and how that even he says that Israel would they thought about God's love and the ways that they thought about it what was it that that was hindering Israel was their thoughts about God's love brother Bram goes into it their perception of God's love was of a parental love but he says that's not that's not it his love is elective he says his proof of his love toward you is that he has chosen you and ordained you through the gospel through sanctification unto eternal life and he this I love this very next phrase he says so no matter what happens to you Hallelujah his love has already been shown to you so when the devil wants to question and put it to you that God doesn't love you God doesn't care about you I'm telling you God has already before the world God himself has exhibited and displayed his love God's sending a message it's not a chance that this message come across your pathway it was ordained for this moment it's not a coincidence that you've sat in services and God has so dealt so personally with your life it's not a coincidence it's a pre-planned moment I believe from the mind of God sometimes our thoughts about things cuz sometimes when we look at it brother B said we can get to thinking when we're going through the trials he said God's actually purging us and sometimes we get to thinking God's angry at us and I think there's a part of it I let me just say it like this it might seem kind of like an oxymoron but I think it's good that when as Believers we go back over and examine our life I think that's good I think it's good but I don't believe that that that as a Believer if you want to know where you're standing with God God doesn't play hide and seek you know why cuz he wants that fellowship with you more than anything so God don't play games if there's something that's got between you and him he is not looking at you as though you are the problem he is calling out the problem and letting you know as a son and daughter of God you don't have to let this remain here you've got authority over this now let's get this out of the way so we can set back together again Hallelujah right the prophet said that Dove coming back off the roost upon the lamb is that rightl oh my sure we we feel you know when you fail God or you failed or short coming I tell you you'd be in you'd be in a big trouble and a big mess if it didn't bother you you'd be in big trouble like what what was it brother Steven I thought it was beautiful how brother Steven brought that out here he says if you're interested how did he say something about if you're interested in a uh I don't want to bring disgrace to God's grace something like that and he says he said then I think you're in a good place amen yeah it was maybe we'll get him back here and have him preach it again it was so [Laughter] good but think about it all down through the scriptures look at how Abraham here here is Abraham he's just had a visit from Elohim praise God and here Abraham comes down once again in the midst of a pressure situation he goes down into another kingdom and here he is in a situation and he tells Sarah Sarah we're just going to you just let them know you're my sister seems like she's getting the short end of the deal she was was we could preach a family service on that one couldn't we but anyhow Abraham here's what Abraham says in verse 11 of Genesis 20 because when abamec asked him why did you do this why did you do this because I thought see his perception affected his actions that's so sometimes listen friends when people's actions and what what you see don't judge people altogether by their actions because you might be making a wrong perception just even based on their actions you may not know what that person is going through you may not know what path they try I'm not making excuses I'm just trying to say sometimes there's things we make perceptions about things and we don't know the background of the story that would help us to have a little bit more compassion hello I say God help us amen and amen because I thought surely the fear of God's not in this place he will slay me for my wife's sake hey there was some there was some spies that went over very familiar with this they went over to spy out the land and they got back over two of them had a good report but there was 10 of them that's right these boys had the wrong perception they came back over and they said in verse 33 we saw the Giants the sons of anic come of the Giants and we were in our own sight so then so when you would stop them did you ask them no you mean you made it sound like you went up on one of those pant legs of the giant what do you think of me I think you're a grasshopper thank you they didn't even talk to the Giants they didn't it was in their own sight sight meaning in their own mind they were already defeated in their own mind their perception of it instead of taking that and saying this is true these are some mighty big giants but what God has said is true God knew these Giants was going to be here can I preach for a moment God knew what he was getting into when he got a hold of your life he knew you before the foundation of the world brother B said he knew all your mistakes and yet he looked down and chose you God knew everything that he would work out brother B said all this was packed into me so God coming into me could bring it all out he not talking about all the righteousness packed in him he's talking about all the muck was packed in him that's right and God manifest his overcoming grace through your life Hallelujah that's amazing because yes though you're a part of a natural family tree but you're a part of the tree of life and that life putting forth another Branch it is shooting forth and manifesting His glory and victory through your life through every complex through every strain through every hold that's been down through your family 2 Kings 5:11 here was non non come to get some help I know we're familiar with this but he was wroth non you know he was expecting Elisha is going to come out and say oh great oh great warrior oh my and because Elisha did not read the text that he thought should have been read that night was not approaching things or and non said pH I don't know what in the world I'm going to do but you know what it was it was his thoughts you see how our thoughts sometimes we could think that our thoughts thoughts are so humble and yet non had a servant I don't know what that servant did maybe he dusted his shoes I don't know but God showed us its Simplicity to the word the servant looks at him what what what courage Rose in that servant to say hey hey hey hey hey hey hey wait a wait a minute wait a minute if he had asked you to do a great thing you'd have done it you'd had no problem with it think about it a servant but it shows just a simple simple Obedience of saying you know what my thoughts I'll get I forsake them Lord this is where my thoughts are on this but your thoughts are higher Lord and non himself submitted his own thoughts to God prise God you know your perception of God you know brother Brown would say it over and over it's to me I love this interesting study I've looked at it over and over at times but if you just type in the words I used to think I love love it brother Bram will go into the things that he used to think and you're familiar with one of the very one of the things that's very much mentioned brother Bram will say it over and over and that was brother Bram said I used to think I think I've got that quote Brianna hear you him let me just read it he says our God and Our Father who brought the love of our own being of your own being God I used to think you were angry with me but Jesus loved me see the conflict right but I've lived long enough to find out that Jesus was the very Heart Of God that his great heart so loved me that he gave his life for me to be a pritu for my sins and me guilty dirty Sinner and he loved me and he redeemed Me by his blessed love and give to me love for everyone Samuel why is that important to understand that you're not trying to please an Angry God who is saying ah you messed up no it's understand God himself Jesus was not the second person of the godhead it was God come down and become so much you and I that he took on Terms of Endearment Hallelujah to be called The Son of God he could be with a term of endearment to you and I brother friend a term of endearment God condescended so when you think of what God thinks about you right there God loves you God cares about you I don't care how many I don't care how many mistakes I don't care how many failures God's love is so much deeper it goes so much greater and God's love is there to override every fault every mistake and bring overcoming victory in that place in your life to where that you will narrowly look upon the Devil and say this is the man right Hallelujah a lot of areas where brother bam talked about and he used to think let me just kind of bring this down here on this sometimes even in our own minds we think somehow that we can Merit I guess going along with that Merit or earn God's favor somehow with things that we do remember brother Brandon would say it very clearly in this way he said some he said preach it as though it's salvation is Jesus plus Works he said but Salvation is of the lord it's Jesus alone works will follow your belief and the works that follow is the faith that is released to you to begin to rise it's Jesus alone now I'm me tell you how powerful that is brother Ram talks about these things being placed in himels some of these words and phrases even he talks about it in the message of how that there were certain songs that were taken away from the church of singing about the blood because they don't want a slaughterhouse religion let me tell you something singing is very important worship is very important that's why I'm just going to say that's why that all Christian singing and all all what's called Christian I don't believe that it is sometimes there's things that you begin to look at it and you'll hear things of a person who is defeated all the time we have not been ordained to be defeated all the time so what are you doing I'm listening for a message oh it don't have to be a song that's wrote by a message believer but as the message and receiving of thinking man's filter there are things that I can receive of songs that have been wrote that minister to me of who I am do you realize the benefit of them even writing those songs is about you and me because it is the anointing of the hour Charles Wesley was not the only one who wrote songs regarding the Methodist time there were others what is it it's God pouring out inspiration upon the age and it flows over onto the book of life now watch this let me just let me try try to bring this down here so we can may God help us to grasp a hold of this notice Matthew 6:7 Jesus said when you pray use not vain right repetitions as the Heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking see this is why that anything that you're doing is trying I listen to try to gain favor with God if you're just doing it out of that measure instead of doing it because you love him this is what he asked me to do I may not understand it I may not even see the full value of it everybody with me there's things that even in my own Christian walk no doubt you're Christian walk we see the value of it it's more of a value to us now than it was when God first got a hold of our life certain things that we couldn't even understand why this or why that I didn't see the value in it but see God helps us to see eventually through our maturing the value in it amen right just like we see the value with getting to church early we begin to see the value of what it is to get into the song service we see the value of what it is to enter in and and say Yes Lord even when I don't feel like it I'm going to say yes Lord you're worthy of my praise I'm going to bring a sacrifice of praise sometimes it's not so much a sacrifice where I mean we're ready to go it's just like soon as they stand up here and if there's just a little hint of gasoline that comes by and it's like like that you know and then there's other times that my it might seem a little tight and so forth and even in your life there's my in my feelings I I don't feel maybe real good I don't feel like maybe praising but that's a time that we s sacrifice Lord you're worthy you're worthy my voice may not be there tonight or what but I want you to know Lord that I am here because you're worthy they think think about this you know and we look at this right here that sometimes it's the thought within itself as I said we sometimes have our own thoughts and our faults about things but let me say it you can't Merit anything from God it's not something you do to to Merit it from God no no he has freely given to us all things it's Faith to accept it Faith to to walk in it and to take it oh my so when the enemy comes you know it's like this let me just say it let's say here this week maybe you've had a week that you feel like man you've been bombarded and you feel like I hadn't had much take time this week maybe it been you've battled through your prayer life this week you've battled through read you've battled through a lot of things and then the enemy would like to get on your shoulder with come in here and saying well what good are you going to be in service that's good what good is it going to do you that's good and you know what you turn around and say it ain't about me it's about him He's Worthy he's worthy thank you Lord Oh Glory let me let me close on this one here out of perseverance we'll just close here tonight brother Bram says if you can find out what your place is in the plan of God even though you be sick and nearly dead you say I'm a Christian how could that be in the plan of God to be sick and nearly dead it might be in God's plan to heal you and give you a test testimony that will shake souls to the kingdom of God he lets those things happen maybe you had your ups and downs and the enemy scorching you from side to side it might have been that way but that's all in the plan of God look at job when he was afflicted sores all over him it was all in the plan of God but job to was perseverant because he knowed that he was keeping God's word nothing was going to bother him don't you love him yes oh yes God is faithful yes he is in all things yes he is I say Lord help us help me let's just stop there tonight help me to have the right perception that's what I'm trusting daily I'm trusting in in and you know as we're if we're standing on God's word that's what's most important is look back to that that God is first if God is first then we can stand right there and to Know You and I by God's grace have an Insight that job didn't have at this time job didn't understand that job God is making something out of your life he's he's molding he's shaping he's he's not he's not correcting you he's purging you job didn't have that understanding but it was to show you and I the strength of the Revelation just like it would be in our life so that you and I when we could read this in regarding job that I would say no doubt I read out of Job chapter n Job chapter 10 Job chapter 16 Job chapter 19 you could probably read out of Samuel not the book of Samuel out of here but the book of Samuel right here you might be able to read book of Samuel chapter 3 and hear Samuel saying things like this or maybe read the book of Dave or the book of Brian and finding this coming out in this chapter and this but you'll also find on those other parts coming out though he slay me yet I'll trust him sir that's that's a part of the book yes it is and he's the one who gives us the strength and the right perception I think God's helped us to see that we're we're not immune from having the wrong perception but I'm grateful that God is mind ful to help us to have the right perception aren't you oh my I love him don't you just appreciate him brother Brian come and amen musicians if you come and amen just lead us in some worship here tonight so oh God thank you for your word hallu thank you for your mercy I think of this age and the time that we're living and and if it not as I said earlier if not for the grace of God Hey listen when the when the Rapture takes place brother Bram tells us there'll be those he said they'll go on having meetings he said and people will continue to come to the altar thinking they're getting saved and the Rapture is already gone said brother Samuel how can that be because the wrong perception now you and I would be there if not for God's grace it was God who came and he found you and I it's the grace of God that could sweep over a heart over a life to where God would help hearts and lives to see maybe a life could look and think man I really feel like this is you know I really love the Lord I really but then God can come right down by his word and show us that there's a deeper walk amen that it's more than just us loving God but it's to have his love in us and God by his grace you see he'll come and he'll work with us to cause our perception to come in line I I'm sure every one of us have probably been at a time and you're learning and I'm not just talking about from scripture but I'm talking about sometimes when you sit around with natural things and you're asking questions and all of a sudden it's like in school right all of a sudden you're looking at something a framework and you're looking at it and you realize I got to find the key to this so I can unlock the rest of these problems now brother bam tells us in key to the door he said there's a key to math key to science key to all these things and god holds those keys but see that same all the God who hold holds all those keys is the same God who holds the key of faith and when that key of Faith what it does it unlocks every promise thank you and so it's just like when you go into your house you don't go into every room at once you go into room by room and that key of faith when it opens up it's opening up promise after promise after promise and it's a key there's things that I I tell you just in this past year I think now we've been in it what maybe a year and a half in the Book of Job there's things some you remember when I first started pastoring I preached on that with the Book of Job but this time around I maybe I'm the only one but I've just I've looked at things I thought my never seen that I remember setting up last last last not this past November but a year ago setting up in Canada and I was just listening to I have heard but now I see and just meditating thinking about our midweek Services right back home and I remember I started listening that and the spirit of God began to deal with me I thought man I never seen it like that man never seen it like this and you just begin to go what I'm saying is is God knows when to give us the perception we need when we need it just just be standing in the right place remember the brown bear Vision never failed but Brother Brad would come around and tell us in countdown before he preaches in his presence he tells us it didn't fail but he remind us to be at the right place at the right time that's good is that right oh yes he tells us the pressure that he got under in the message that night in his presence of how he said I I went with the older brothers because I was I should have been with the younger brothers according to Vision but I was I didn't know what they might say I'm glad I'm glad that the prophet of God would allow those things to be recorded in there because I can relate to a man like that I can relate to what it is to feel pressure and to have made mistakes under pressure and be able to look and say God your grace was sufficient for the prophit of God in this hour then your grace is sufficient for me let's just be standing upon him let's make sure every part in our life whether you're here or whether you're streaming let's make sure Lord I want my perception to be right I want my life to be locked in I want to know I want Lord that that assurance that that's where I want to be Lord let's just ask his Blessing heavenly father thank you for your mercy tonight thank you Lord for coming by our way Lord father we want to say thank you I I Lord I don't feel like that those words are maybe Grand enough but I I just know that's how I feel and we feel from our hearts tonight thank you Lord Lord I Thank you for how you've come and ministered to our hearts Lord in the seen and unseen audience Lord dear God I pray tonight Lord if there's any perception that's off Lord father may you just move tonight Lord tenderize Lord our hearts tenderize every heart and every life Lord and may that heart just look into you and say Lord let me just be locked in with you Lord that's all I care about I just don't care about nothing else just to be locked in with you Grant it Lord we love you tonight Lord may you just move Lord for every need give give strength Lord to every heart here tonight we pray we love you and we thank you now Lord in Jesus name amen Amen brother Brian if you'd like to stand amen I am so glad that Father in Heaven tells of his love in the book book he has given wonderful things in the Bible I see this is the dearest that Jesus loves me I am so glad that Jesus Loves Me amen Jesus Loves Me Jesus loves me I am so glad that Jesus loves me Jesus loves even me though I forget him and W away till he do love me wherever I st oh thank you Lord back to his dear loving arms would I flee when I remember that Jes loves me I am so glad that Jesus Loves Me Oh yes Jesus Loves Me Oh Jesus loves me I am so glad that Jesus Loves Me Jesus loves even [Music] me oh if there's only one song I can sing when in his Beauty I see the
