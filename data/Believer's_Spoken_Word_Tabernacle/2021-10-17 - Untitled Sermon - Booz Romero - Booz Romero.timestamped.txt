[34:21] [Music]
[34:24] heavenly father as we lift up our hands
[34:26] to you lord this morning
[34:28] just want to give you thanks for this
[34:30] time
[34:31] this opportunity lord that we have to be
[34:33] in your house lord thank you for your
[34:35] children that have made the effort to be
[34:37] here lord
[34:39] and as we always say father it is not to
[34:42] hear the man that is ascending before
[34:44] them but is to hear the god that is
[34:47] going to be speaking through that man
[34:48] that is
[34:49] before them father
[34:51] father help me to stay step out of the
[34:53] way and may you bless your children by
[34:55] the preaching of the word lord and if
[34:57] there is any need if somebody feels
[35:01] rejected somebody feels depressed
[35:03] somebody feels
[35:05] anxious about things father made through
[35:07] the preaching of of the word lord as
[35:10] that centurion said lord just speak the
[35:13] word and my servant is gonna be made
[35:16] whole father so that's our desire that
[35:19] if it is just one word coming from you
[35:22] lord we are gonna be okay this morning
[35:25] we love you and give you thanks for this
[35:27] time of fellowship lord bless our
[35:30] brother samuel laura as he's preaching
[35:33] bless him lord use him for your glory
[35:35] lord and as we're here lord as
[35:37] uh
[35:38] mortals like doing an effort lord but
[35:41] you you are the one that gives the
[35:42] strength father we love and give you
[35:44] thanks we commend our lives in your
[35:46] hands in the reading of your word lord
[35:48] we know that your word is already
[35:50] blessed
[35:51] so now just help us to say the right
[35:53] thing help us to be used by you father
[35:57] that's my desire that's my purpose
[36:00] that's my goal to be here this morning
[36:03] we love and give you thanks in the name
[36:04] of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[36:08] amen god bless you this morning is
[36:09] certainly a privilege to be in the house
[36:11] of the lord
[36:12] if you have your bibles thank you
[36:14] musicians
[36:16] if you have your bibles
[36:18] we can go to the book of ephesians uh
[36:21] chap the first chapter verse 7 and verse
[36:25] 8
[36:26] and also the book of book of 2nd
[36:28] corinthians chapter 4 verse 7
[36:31] and
[36:32] through 9.
[36:34] so if you have it you can say amen
[36:40] so the word of god says in whom we have
[36:43] redemption
[36:44] through his blood
[36:46] and the forgiveness of sins according to
[36:49] the riches of his grace wherein he had
[36:52] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[36:55] prudence
[36:57] now in the book of second corinthians
[36:58] chapter four
[37:02] and it read reads like this
[37:04] but we have this treasure in earthen
[37:08] vessels that the excellent excellency of
[37:11] the power of the power may be of god and
[37:14] not of pops
[37:16] and then it says we are trouble on every
[37:18] side
[37:19] yet
[37:20] not distressed we are perplexed
[37:23] but not in despair we are persecuted but
[37:26] not forsaken
[37:28] we are cast down but not destroyed
[37:32] always bearing about in the body the
[37:34] dying of the lord jesus that the life as
[37:37] of jesus might be
[37:38] made manifest in our body amen you may
[37:41] have your seeds
[37:44] uh i greet you all in the lovely name of
[37:46] the lord jesus christ this is it's a
[37:48] privilege to be once again here i think
[37:50] last time i was here was in 2019
[37:54] so it's a little bit kind of quite the
[37:56] time you know but we are so um
[37:59] it is i always consider this a privilege
[38:02] to speak to you and
[38:04] consider your pastor as a good friend of
[38:06] mine and i remember since i met him back
[38:09] in 2000 i was it was 2012.
[38:13] wow it's crazy
[38:16] back in 2012 when i was i first met him
[38:19] and i first just moved to the states and
[38:21] i didn't know where to go what church to
[38:23] go and everything and your pastor was i
[38:26] i remember i came to visit and with
[38:28] brother i don't know where brother bill
[38:29] is uh
[38:30] brother bill sister mary they were
[38:32] always very welcoming so and i'm so
[38:35] grateful that that friendship like
[38:37] throughout the years there's still that
[38:40] confidence that we can come and speak to
[38:42] you even though he's not here but he's
[38:45] he knows that we're going to say the
[38:46] right thing
[38:47] or he and as i was saying in my prayer
[38:50] is not even the guy that is or the or
[38:54] the minister that is in front of the
[38:56] congregation but we have to just step
[38:59] out of the way and let the lord have his
[39:02] way
[39:03] amen so i'm grateful to be here and also
[39:06] grateful that my wife is here with me
[39:07] this morning and uh we're just uh
[39:11] blessed you know we are a blessed people
[39:13] as we're reading here you know we are
[39:15] distressing in all ways we are we are
[39:20] perplexed but we are we're not on
[39:22] despair you know you you may you maybe
[39:25] as the song says you may be you you can
[39:27] always be brought
[39:30] down but net or like low but will never
[39:32] be brought down
[39:34] amen because that's his promise you know
[39:36] you can go through the greatest
[39:37] temptation through the greatest
[39:39] tribulation in your life but everything
[39:41] is for a purpose in your life and at the
[39:44] end of the day is gonna be for his glory
[39:48] amen so this morning by god's grace you
[39:51] know
[39:54] i kind of like this week in a couple of
[39:57] weeks ago when your pastor texts me i
[39:59] was like well you know i know what i'm
[40:00] gonna i'm gonna be speaking but then my
[40:03] pastor also texts me hey can you take a
[40:05] service so i took one serve like this
[40:07] wednesday past wednesday at our church
[40:10] and then
[40:11] on friday night we had the youth meeting
[40:13] and now we're here
[40:14] but like you know when when you study
[40:17] then you're like okay i'm gonna be
[40:18] speaking about this yes lord i'm
[40:20] following your leadership
[40:22] but uh even yesterday night i was like
[40:24] yeah this is this is gonna be what we're
[40:26] gonna be talking but then all of a
[40:28] sudden like uh yesterday night and this
[40:30] morning the lord like you know that's
[40:32] kind of gonna be the topic but maybe
[40:34] you're gonna bring it in a different way
[40:38] so
[40:38] i just pray that if uh not native but
[40:42] this is the lord and i just trust that
[40:45] we are going to be blessed by the
[40:46] preaching of his word
[40:48] amen so we're just so
[40:51] as i said is it's good to be here amen
[40:53] and when you know as always i always
[40:56] said it as david said it i was glad when
[40:59] they said unto me let us go into the
[41:02] house of the lord so i'm
[41:05] hoping that you are glad to be in the
[41:07] house of the lord you know after so many
[41:09] things restrictions and the spirit of
[41:12] the hour and everything that we still
[41:14] have this privilege to be in his house
[41:17] amen and you know there are other places
[41:19] where they don't have this this
[41:21] opportunity as we have this morning but
[41:24] we can still rejoice that we have this
[41:26] for sure you know the time will come
[41:28] when the doors will have to be closed
[41:30] down and everything but in the meantime
[41:34] in this time we can say you know what
[41:36] i'm i'm glad to be here so with that
[41:39] mindset with that desire in our heart
[41:42] this morning let's have church this
[41:44] morning amen
[41:46] amen
[41:47] so also in the book of leviticus chapter
[41:49] 25 uh verse 54
[41:53] sorry and and and he here is talking and
[41:56] if and if he is not redeemed during
[41:58] these years and by these means then he
[42:01] shall go free in the year of jubilee and
[42:04] he and his children with him
[42:07] amen so uh before we we kind of enter
[42:10] into business here uh the prophet of god
[42:13] says
[42:14] if if you can believe
[42:16] now to achieve anything you have to set
[42:19] a goal and say this i believe and tie
[42:23] yourself to that and keep drawing from
[42:25] that keep moving
[42:28] moving up to or closer to it knowing
[42:31] that there is a goal knowing that there
[42:33] is something where you want to go
[42:35] amen and that there there is out there
[42:38] is something that that that you are
[42:39] coming to amen and then i like this he
[42:43] he's talking about this little guy
[42:45] that there was uh these men that came
[42:48] and asked him so what are you holding
[42:50] son and he's like i'm holding my kite
[42:54] and then he says well i don't see
[42:57] nothing but a string
[42:58] and he said well there is a kite on the
[43:01] end of it and his the men look at him
[43:03] and say i don't see the kite i don't see
[43:05] no kite
[43:07] and the little was saying neither do i
[43:10] but he says well how do you know you got
[43:12] a kite
[43:13] and he says because i can feel it
[43:15] talking at the end at the end
[43:18] amen so well that's the way faith
[43:20] that's the way faith is faith is the
[43:23] substance of things hoped for the
[43:25] evidence of things that you cannot see
[43:28] and as long as you set your faith on
[43:31] those things and then anchor
[43:33] anchor yourself to those things then
[43:35] you're gonna come to it so if i can tell
[43:38] you this morning sometimes you cannot
[43:41] see some
[43:42] things clearly but if there is something
[43:45] that is pulling in your heart then then
[43:47] if somebody asks you well i don't see a
[43:49] change in your life but then you can say
[43:51] but there is something in my life that
[43:53] is changing there is something at the
[43:55] end on the other side that is pulling
[43:57] i'm hearing from my theophany this
[44:00] morning i'm hearing from my theophany
[44:02] every day
[44:04] amen no matter if you can't see it or
[44:07] not you know they it is there anyhow
[44:11] it is pulling you every day that's why
[44:13] you're in church this morning that's
[44:16] when you come to church every day that
[44:18] that there is an opportunity to be in
[44:20] church why because there is a pulling
[44:22] inside of you because there is if there
[44:25] is a negative which we are the negative
[44:28] there is the positive that is hey is
[44:30] saying hey go to church hey fellowship
[44:32] you are gonna be around the right
[44:34] fellowship that's right
[44:37] that's right amen
[44:40] amen and any man that's ever done
[44:42] anything worldwide he has set a goal and
[44:45] and then he's persistent about and he
[44:47] about it he's persev perseverant about
[44:50] it and then that becomes a great man
[44:53] and if we think about a great man this
[44:55] morning that was our lord and savior
[44:57] jesus christ when he came he had a goal
[45:00] he had a purpose and the purpose was
[45:02] that he wanted to be and that or the
[45:05] purpose that he was sent to was because
[45:07] he was gonna give his life for us that
[45:10] this morning we can be partakers of that
[45:13] divine nature that this morning we can
[45:15] we can be by partakers or beneficiaries
[45:18] of that redemption we can be
[45:21] beneficiaries of that restoration in our
[45:23] lives how many this morning could
[45:25] testify and say i am a fruit of that
[45:28] that i was deep in sin and in in
[45:31] transpasses and everything in
[45:33] shortcomings and everything but he
[45:36] reached down his hand for me and set me
[45:39] free and brought me to his house and he
[45:41] set his table before me and his banner
[45:45] over me is still love
[45:47] amen
[45:49] amen
[45:50] hey that's good
[45:54] sorry you know you need to start and i
[45:56] don't like to do this but i will have to
[45:58] take off my coat
[46:01] i always say it it's like the uniform
[46:03] you know you go there and just like go
[46:04] like this like a soldier
[46:06] you don't want to move you don't want to
[46:08] lose your posture post posture or
[46:10] whatever how you say it
[46:13] but anyway
[46:15] may everything be for his glory
[46:19] and you know many times we have heard
[46:21] and and this is what i would like to i
[46:23] would like to title this morning the
[46:25] greatest work
[46:27] god's greatest greatest work in this
[46:30] last day
[46:32] and as we have read already there about
[46:34] redemption so we let's talk about the
[46:37] work of redemption this morning and uh
[46:40] if you go to the book of leviticus
[46:42] chapter 25 verse from verse 23 through
[46:46] 2055 through verse 55 there you're going
[46:49] to see all the different types of or
[46:51] like all the the the laws of redemption
[46:53] for the children of israel
[46:55] amen in in in verse 49 it says or his
[46:59] uncle or his uncle's son they may redeem
[47:02] him or anyone who is near or of kin to
[47:05] him in his falling in his family may
[47:08] redeem him or if he's stable he may
[47:10] redeem himself
[47:13] but those he shall reckon with him who
[47:15] bought him the price of his release
[47:17] shall be according to the number of
[47:19] years from the year that he was sold to
[47:21] him until the year of you believe
[47:24] it shall be according to the time of a
[47:26] higher servant for him and then verse 54
[47:28] it says and i really when i was reading
[47:30] this scripture i was like well this is
[47:32] just great because if he is not reading
[47:35] during these years and by these means
[47:38] then he shall go free in the year of
[47:40] juventu
[47:42] so even though that person could be
[47:44] still still a slave
[47:46] to until the year of uvali it wouldn't
[47:49] really matter at the end of the day he
[47:50] was going to be set free anyways
[47:53] but then he was he had to come to the
[47:55] year of you believe but also he and his
[47:58] children with him
[48:01] so the work of god is not just like you
[48:04] know god jehovah is a god
[48:07] that loves his family
[48:10] so when we're seeing this is like when
[48:11] he does a pr when he has a purpose or
[48:14] redemption for his children he's not
[48:16] just redeeming the father
[48:19] he's not just redeeming the mom but he's
[48:22] like that's what he here he is telling
[48:24] us when they are with him this is
[48:26] redeemed the father and his children
[48:28] with him
[48:30] so if tonight if this morning you have
[48:33] someone in your heart that is not
[48:35] following the lord guess what there is a
[48:38] promise here that says that you and your
[48:40] children can be redeemed that you and
[48:43] your children can go to the year of your
[48:45] belief and let me tell you one thing we
[48:47] are not waiting for that year of you
[48:49] believe we are in that year of you
[48:51] believe what is that year of you believe
[48:53] is a year of freedom when the word was
[48:56] sent to us when you receive our lord and
[48:58] savior jesus christ what did that do to
[49:01] your life it set you free
[49:04] amen i'm not i'm not i'm no longer as
[49:06] we're seeing as a slave of uh to sin i
[49:09] am a child of god and when i became a
[49:12] child of god that was my year of you
[49:14] believe
[49:16] amen
[49:17] and if you have not experienced that
[49:19] year we believe this morning i invite
[49:21] you this morning to say lord where is my
[49:24] 50 years of jubilee
[49:26] you cannot be living under bondage
[49:28] anymore you cannot live you cannot be
[49:31] living on under your past sins you
[49:33] cannot be living on their depression you
[49:36] cannot be living again still under
[49:38] anxiety or under lost or under
[49:41] pornography or under whatever desires
[49:44] where in the past
[49:47] you can't if you have come into the year
[49:49] of you believe
[49:51] amen
[49:54] because that's his promise
[49:56] you go free
[49:58] in the year of you believe
[50:00] you go free in the year you believe
[50:06] if you're not free this morning i invite
[50:07] you to to say lord where's my jubilee
[50:11] the kinsman redeemer the word uh it
[50:15] comes from from a word it's called goel
[50:17] and it's used to indicate both
[50:19] the redemption
[50:21] and needs to do free by paying something
[50:23] and the redeemer the one who pays
[50:27] who was doing this work
[50:29] our lord amen and what is redemption is
[50:32] it is the act of buying something or
[50:35] paying a price to return something to
[50:38] its original possession
[50:40] or its original position
[50:43] that's what the word of god is doing
[50:45] with the children of god this day when
[50:48] you have received his word it is
[50:50] bringing you back to your inheritance
[50:52] it is bringing you back and and
[50:55] placing you as children and daughters as
[50:58] sons and daughters of god
[51:00] that's what this is that's what the
[51:02] greatest work in these days is happening
[51:06] and the bible says that it will be so
[51:08] simple that if i will tell you about it
[51:11] you wouldn't believe it
[51:13] that's why people can see your life and
[51:15] say you
[51:17] you
[51:18] i say yes me
[51:21] because it is a simple word
[51:24] i was listening brother and i was
[51:26] talking about god hiding himself in
[51:28] simplicity he's talking he's like and
[51:30] people will kind of they they cannot see
[51:32] it because it is so simple
[51:36] that's what when they see your life and
[51:37] they were like well you used to do the
[51:38] hat
[51:40] you used to be a drunkard
[51:41] you used to
[51:43] hit your wife
[51:47] you used to kiss your husband too
[51:53] and then when the change comes
[51:59] that's what people is like
[52:01] i don't believe well
[52:03] as nathaniel said
[52:05] philip nathaniel come and see
[52:08] come and see
[52:10] and now you can tell people come and see
[52:12] the greatest work
[52:14] in these last days
[52:16] the greatest work in this lifestyle see
[52:18] is not a it's not a building it is a
[52:21] group of people that is coming and that
[52:24] is walking according to the word of god
[52:27] and that is being set free every day how
[52:29] many can experience that or have
[52:31] experienced that that sometimes in the
[52:33] morning you may wake up with such burden
[52:35] in your heart and you don't know why and
[52:37] all of a sudden you just pray and say
[52:39] lord i don't know what is this but
[52:41] please help me and set me free and what
[52:44] is the lord doing he comes and set you
[52:46] free
[52:47] that is the greatest work
[52:49] he is the greatest the greatest
[52:51] emancipator
[52:53] that has come and has set us free
[52:56] amen and we remember about
[52:59] you know a when when when it was a time
[53:02] for of the emancipation and and and the
[53:05] younger guys the younger kids they went
[53:08] up to the mountain
[53:10] right
[53:11] the younger ones went up to the mountain
[53:14] and then the older ones to stay here
[53:16] below
[53:17] and then the
[53:18] the women and the children stay in the
[53:20] middle and then when they say that when
[53:22] they saw the sun
[53:23] they say we are free
[53:26] and then they told them the mothers and
[53:28] the children we are free and then they
[53:30] were telling the ones the the older ones
[53:32] we are free
[53:35] what can you say this morning when the
[53:37] son of righteousness have come to your
[53:39] life that you can say this morning i am
[53:42] free
[53:43] i am free from all sin from all
[53:45] transparencies from all my past from all
[53:48] my future because now it belongs to him
[53:52] amen
[53:53] amen sorry i may be excited
[54:01] what is redemption
[54:03] it is the act of buying something or
[54:06] paying a price
[54:07] to return something to its original
[54:09] possession and position
[54:13] i don't know if somebody here have
[54:15] experienced that you know like you
[54:17] bought a house and all of a sudden there
[54:18] is a foreclosure
[54:20] and then you're you're kind of kicked
[54:22] out of your house
[54:24] but then all of a sudden someone said
[54:26] you know what
[54:28] your family maybe a family member say
[54:29] hey you know what i can pay that for you
[54:31] and then you pay me later
[54:34] and then guess what you are restored to
[54:36] your original possession
[54:38] but with christ we don't have to pay
[54:40] later
[54:41] he paid the price and as we as we know
[54:44] is he was paid he paid the price and he
[54:46] was up he paid him full
[54:48] he paid that price like the entire the
[54:51] the total price amen
[54:55] amen
[54:56] so now
[54:59] redemption is also a releasing
[55:03] is a releasing effect by payment of a
[55:05] ransom
[55:07] is a redemption is deliverance is
[55:10] liberation procured by the payment of
[55:12] ransom amen
[55:14] so and also
[55:15] when we're talking about redemption we
[55:17] can refer to three uh greek words that
[55:21] they refer always to redemption because
[55:23] redemption at the end of the day is is
[55:25] you know
[55:27] it could be uh the payment of of like
[55:30] for for the purchase of a land but also
[55:33] it could be the payment for for the
[55:35] releasing of a slave amen and also it
[55:38] could be a a a change in in in in
[55:42] locations amen
[55:44] so we're going to talk about it this
[55:45] morning the first one is the meaning to
[55:48] purchase is
[55:50] it is to purchase in the marketplace in
[55:53] ancient times it often referred to the
[55:55] act of buying a slave
[55:57] amen and in the word the greek word that
[56:00] we're referring to is is the work the
[56:02] word agoras
[56:05] is to purchase in the marketplace
[56:08] so
[56:08] if we just think a little bit about it
[56:11] it's like what what is the purchase in
[56:12] the marketplace you know
[56:14] and if you go back to the book of hosea
[56:17] in the book of hosea jose was given the
[56:20] the instruction and
[56:22] we will hear things like that these days
[56:24] we will be like uh that guy is kind of
[56:27] i think he's missing uh something there
[56:29] you know because hosea when he comes to
[56:33] them
[56:34] he and the lord told him go in in in in
[56:37] mary
[56:39] uh uh a person
[56:42] and and they were like really it was
[56:44] like the lord is telling me to do that
[56:46] and then he married her and then he had
[56:49] children with her and and it was just
[56:52] from the lord to show them that that is
[56:55] the house of israel how they were
[56:58] worshiping the the idols how they were
[57:01] worshipping bail and all of that but
[57:04] then out of that then he says but now
[57:06] you know they're she's gonna go back
[57:10] because you can marry her you like if
[57:12] somebody is not making a clear-cut
[57:15] decision before the lord that person can
[57:17] be when they good in church and then the
[57:19] next day they can be out in the world
[57:23] amen so what happened what happened with
[57:26] his wife and it says uh here in the book
[57:28] of hosea chapter uh second chapter verse
[57:31] 23 in it and it says and i will sow her
[57:33] unto me in the earth and and this is he
[57:37] the lord is talking through uh to hosea
[57:39] and it says and i will have i will have
[57:42] mercy upon her and that
[57:44] that had not obtained mercy and i will
[57:48] say to them which where not my people
[57:51] thou art my people and they shall say
[57:54] thou art my god
[57:56] amen
[57:57] that's us amen so he here who said hosea
[58:00] is representing that
[58:02] but then in hosea chapter 3 then it says
[58:05] then said the lord to me go yet love a
[58:08] woman beloved her friend yet an
[58:10] adulteress according to the love of the
[58:13] of the lord toward the children of
[58:14] israel we look to other gods and love
[58:17] flagons of wine
[58:19] but listen
[58:21] so i bought her to me four fifteen
[58:23] pieces of silver
[58:25] and for an armor a homer of barley and a
[58:28] half homer of barley and i said unto her
[58:31] thou shall have hide for me many days
[58:33] and thou shall not play the harlot and
[58:35] thou shall not be for another man so
[58:38] will i also be for thee what was
[58:40] happening here so now he goes back again
[58:43] and buys her but now he's paying a full
[58:47] price because at first it was just a
[58:49] marriage but now the second part here
[58:51] now he's paying silver for her so if you
[58:55] know the medals in the bible silver it
[58:59] it represents redemption
[59:01] so he's paying redemption for for her
[59:04] that's why when our lord was was was
[59:06] sold by judas he was sold by silver
[59:09] because he was a representation that he
[59:11] was paying for our redemption
[59:14] joseph was happened the same thing with
[59:17] joseph he was sold by by 15 or or 20
[59:21] pieces of silver and it was also a
[59:23] representation of of the of of the
[59:25] greatest work of god on earth
[59:28] redemption
[59:30] amen so the beauty or or how i love this
[59:34] is despite all what she had done despite
[59:38] all the way she was living the lord
[59:41] still said i will have mercy upon you
[59:44] and i will go back and and and by you at
[59:47] the market
[59:49] amen
[59:51] and if we go to the book of romans
[59:53] chapter 7
[59:56] the last verse
[1:00:10] it says but i see another law
[1:00:13] verse 23
[1:00:14] it says i see another law in my members
[1:00:17] worrying against the law of my mind and
[1:00:19] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:00:21] sin which is in my members
[1:00:23] oh
[1:00:25] paul is
[1:00:26] expressing here wretched man that i am
[1:00:29] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:00:31] this death
[1:00:32] in other words now who can buy me who
[1:00:36] can pay the price for me
[1:00:39] because there is no one
[1:00:40] my thoughts every day every morning
[1:00:43] every night they are persec they are
[1:00:45] persecuting me wherever i go i cannot
[1:00:48] have a clear thought
[1:00:50] because i haven't been purchased
[1:00:54] but then he says and i love you know
[1:00:56] when you go and read your bible it's
[1:00:58] always placing the people in judgment
[1:01:00] but then if you read at the end it
[1:01:03] always brings deliverance to the people
[1:01:06] that's why you have to read the entire
[1:01:07] book
[1:01:10] because that's why a lot of people live
[1:01:11] under defeat because they like you know
[1:01:13] what this is what it says and then
[1:01:15] that's it you know i'm a wretched man
[1:01:18] but read the next verse it says oh but i
[1:01:20] thank god through jesus christ our lord
[1:01:22] so then with the mind i myself serve the
[1:01:26] law of god but with the flesh the law of
[1:01:29] sin
[1:01:30] but then it goes to romans eight chapter
[1:01:33] one and it in and it is it is gonna say
[1:01:37] here there is therefore now no
[1:01:40] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:01:43] jesus
[1:01:44] in other words the ones that have been
[1:01:46] accepted the ransom for them the ones
[1:01:49] that have been received
[1:01:51] or have been
[1:01:54] a price has been paid for them
[1:01:56] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:02:00] the spirit why because your body and
[1:02:02] your spirit still need redemption but
[1:02:05] your soul had already been redeemed
[1:02:08] in other words you are already reading
[1:02:12] amen but now we have to make our minds
[1:02:15] now we have to make our body to obey
[1:02:18] that redemption
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:22] because that's how the lord works it's
[1:02:23] like it is not because a lot of people
[1:02:25] will say you know what they can receive
[1:02:27] the holy spirit the holy ghost in their
[1:02:29] spirit but then they go back and leave
[1:02:31] th
[1:02:31] the same unclean way but once they
[1:02:34] receive the holy spirit in their soul
[1:02:37] then even though their spirit will start
[1:02:40] will still try to go back and do the
[1:02:42] wrong things there is a greater law in
[1:02:45] their heart there is a superior
[1:02:47] something in their lives that they they
[1:02:49] will say no that is not right i'm gonna
[1:02:52] take the other direction
[1:02:54] amen what is that it's because they have
[1:02:57] been still in their lives until the day
[1:03:00] of their redemption
[1:03:02] what is the day of redemption we are
[1:03:04] living under that day this morning
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:10] how many love him this morning
[1:03:12] now
[1:03:14] i love another one here
[1:03:16] and i was preaching canada a few a few
[1:03:19] weeks ago and i was preaching this and i
[1:03:22] just love this
[1:03:23] how the lord works you know genesis 38
[1:03:26] and here speaks about talmud it speaks
[1:03:28] about judah you know
[1:03:32] what happened here
[1:03:33] if you read verse 38 37 of genesis and
[1:03:37] verse 39 of genesis it is speaking about
[1:03:40] joseph
[1:03:41] but there is a parenthesis
[1:03:43] there there is an interruption in time
[1:03:46] for someone to come here and and play
[1:03:49] some play a role here and that is that
[1:03:52] is tamar you know there was judah that
[1:03:55] he had three children he got two
[1:03:56] children and those children they didn't
[1:03:59] want to have seed of this woman and then
[1:04:01] she was sent back to her parents because
[1:04:03] it was like well we don't have any other
[1:04:05] children here any other the kind of that
[1:04:07] that could be your age
[1:04:11] meant but then what what what happened
[1:04:13] there then she was like well she just
[1:04:14] went up went back to her household
[1:04:17] but then all of a sudden she was told
[1:04:19] hey your your father-in-law's coming and
[1:04:21] she was like well if he's coming then
[1:04:23] he's going to bring
[1:04:24] my next husband
[1:04:26] the third one
[1:04:28] but what happened he didn't he didn't
[1:04:29] bring him because he was like he was not
[1:04:31] of age yet
[1:04:33] but then she what did she do here
[1:04:36] the same thing as happened with jose's
[1:04:38] wife she just kind of took all uh took
[1:04:42] off the the the her harlot i mean uh her
[1:04:46] her uh widow garments and then she put
[1:04:49] on on on on
[1:04:51] on the garments of a harlot
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:55] and and then it says here and she and
[1:04:57] she cover her with a veil and grab
[1:05:00] herself and start in an open place which
[1:05:02] is by the way of tifna for she saw that
[1:05:06] shella was grown and she was not given
[1:05:08] unto him for wife
[1:05:10] she wanted to to to bring a seed
[1:05:13] uh
[1:05:14] through the through the uh for for judah
[1:05:16] amen but
[1:05:18] she
[1:05:18] like she couldn't do it by herself
[1:05:21] and that is what happened with our lives
[1:05:23] many times you know we want to bring the
[1:05:24] life of christ but it is not by
[1:05:26] ourselves there has to be there has to
[1:05:28] be the seed of god that has to come into
[1:05:30] our hearts so in order for us to be able
[1:05:31] to produce something
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:35] and then when judah saw her he thought
[1:05:37] her to be a harlot because she had
[1:05:40] covered her face
[1:05:42] amen so then
[1:05:44] she was like you know what
[1:05:46] maybe we can be together no you know
[1:05:48] just talking in in between the lines we
[1:05:51] can be together and and and and
[1:05:53] and and then we should be okay because
[1:05:55] judah
[1:05:56] had her as a harlot
[1:05:59] right but she says that you know what
[1:06:01] before you do that uh judah
[1:06:04] i want something
[1:06:06] and she was like well i can send you a
[1:06:08] you know a goat or i can say you a kid
[1:06:11] from from the flock
[1:06:13] and she was like no
[1:06:15] give me a pledge
[1:06:17] and he says what flesh shall i give thee
[1:06:19] and she said thy sagnet by signet
[1:06:23] by bracelets and thy stuff that is in
[1:06:26] thy hand
[1:06:27] and he gave it to her and came in
[1:06:30] onto her and she conceived by him
[1:06:34] what was happening here
[1:06:36] she wanted to bring forth life
[1:06:38] there was the one that was the carrier
[1:06:40] of life of the same seed that she was
[1:06:43] supposed to conceive from
[1:06:46] and
[1:06:47] and that that is the way it happened
[1:06:49] but then there was a shout that came
[1:06:53] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:06:56] angel a shout that came with judgment
[1:06:59] against who i can stammer because they
[1:07:02] say she is pregnant she she has she she
[1:07:05] because she has not been faithful to her
[1:07:08] covenant
[1:07:09] but then when they come against her she
[1:07:11] says wait a second
[1:07:14] wait a second she says whoever is the
[1:07:17] owner of this staff whoever is the owner
[1:07:20] whoever has the authority
[1:07:23] whoever has the sickness who has have
[1:07:25] also the authority as well i am with
[1:07:28] child
[1:07:29] and what happened here judah was like
[1:07:31] well
[1:07:33] who's the owner of that that's me
[1:07:36] so what happened there there was a a
[1:07:38] redemption happening there because
[1:07:41] she could have gone to a to death or she
[1:07:44] could have died but she had a seed
[1:07:47] inside of her that jew that couldn't
[1:07:49] destroy why because it was the the seed
[1:07:53] of judah
[1:07:54] and it is the same thing we use we can
[1:07:56] make a play the role of a harlot many
[1:07:59] times but guess what inside of you there
[1:08:02] is a seat of the lion of the drive of
[1:08:05] judah
[1:08:06] and who is that is our mighty the mighty
[1:08:09] warrior our lord jesus christ
[1:08:12] when you were in in line to be killed
[1:08:16] what happened somebody else took your
[1:08:18] place amen they say that in russia
[1:08:22] they were killing those christians and
[1:08:24] and when they were all of them there is
[1:08:26] like they they were they were because
[1:08:28] they were confessing that they were
[1:08:29] christians and what happened there was
[1:08:31] all of a sudden one soldier that said
[1:08:33] you know what there was one that said
[1:08:35] i'm not gonna die i reject christ but
[1:08:38] there was one that took the the the the
[1:08:40] place of that one and say i'm gonna die
[1:08:42] with them
[1:08:44] that was our savior jesus christ as well
[1:08:47] when we were on death row he came and he
[1:08:50] took our place why because he loved us
[1:08:55] because he wanted to show us how more
[1:08:57] how much he love us
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] and how beautiful is this that she
[1:09:04] didn't die and if you go through the
[1:09:06] bible this is the greatest work of
[1:09:08] redemption in the bible every single
[1:09:11] woman every single man how the lord was
[1:09:14] able or the lord forgave them from all
[1:09:16] of their trespasses all of their deceit
[1:09:19] he's saying he healed them from all of
[1:09:20] their diseases
[1:09:22] yes
[1:09:24] why
[1:09:26] because
[1:09:27] if we wouldn't be here
[1:09:29] then he couldn't be god
[1:09:32] why because god is so it's a word
[1:09:34] it's an object of worship
[1:09:36] and and if you wanted to be jehovah
[1:09:37] which is yahweh but with his the guy
[1:09:39] that the god that dwells with his family
[1:09:42] he needed to have a family
[1:09:44] but not just any any type of family
[1:09:47] a man she needed to have a family that
[1:09:49] has been ransomed a family that he has
[1:09:52] paid the price for them he has paid the
[1:09:54] price of redemption for them
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:58] so that's why you know this parenthesis
[1:10:01] is beautiful how the lord works how many
[1:10:03] lives we have how many times we have had
[1:10:05] parentheses in our lives and all of a
[1:10:08] sudden you we you are going one way but
[1:10:11] the lord turns you another way and then
[1:10:13] you are like wow
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:24] now
[1:10:27] the other word other word when we're
[1:10:30] talking about redemption
[1:10:32] it is always going
[1:10:34] it always say involves going from
[1:10:36] something to something else or going
[1:10:38] from one place to another place
[1:10:40] in this case it is christ freeing us
[1:10:42] from the bondage of the law
[1:10:44] to freedom in the spirit and to enjoy
[1:10:46] new life in him
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:50] because you were deaf in death in sins
[1:10:53] and trespasses and then now you are
[1:10:55] living you are being seated as the book
[1:10:57] of ephesians says in heavenly places
[1:11:00] with christ jesus
[1:11:03] you can either be on one side or can be
[1:11:05] on the other side you cannot be in
[1:11:07] between
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:10] that's the word is is called
[1:11:13] in greek exagoras
[1:11:16] and then the prophet of god says it is
[1:11:18] redemption that has two parts
[1:11:20] and redemption anywhere is out of
[1:11:23] something and into something and that's
[1:11:26] what makes redemption and then moses
[1:11:29] represented the law which brought them
[1:11:31] out of what out of egypt
[1:11:34] and
[1:11:35] joshua represented grace that took them
[1:11:38] into the promised land
[1:11:40] amen that's what we we have heard so
[1:11:42] many times preachers that say that
[1:11:45] joshua is the holy spirit that is
[1:11:47] positioning the believer in their
[1:11:50] position in christ
[1:11:52] amen we are you're being brought out of
[1:11:54] something into something
[1:11:57] another way is that the law and grace
[1:11:59] were two different
[1:12:01] aspects of gasp of god's command
[1:12:04] you know because
[1:12:06] people may say or may take you know the
[1:12:08] old testament was for for you know for
[1:12:10] the people of the old testament and now
[1:12:12] we just have to believe the new
[1:12:13] testament but that's not that's not true
[1:12:15] because it's law and grace they are
[1:12:17] always together
[1:12:19] amen you know
[1:12:21] the lord brought them out moses but
[1:12:23] joshua took them in
[1:12:26] you know now this is you know uh
[1:12:29] so we have we have
[1:12:31] in in our day we have come out of the
[1:12:33] world or out of the out of egypt out of
[1:12:37] the chaos and we are on our road to the
[1:12:40] promised land
[1:12:41] that's our time this morning amen out of
[1:12:44] something into something amen
[1:12:48] and when we talk about the law
[1:12:51] the law is is the one that brings us to
[1:12:53] recognize that we are wrong
[1:12:56] amen but it is that it is grace that
[1:12:59] forgives us
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:01] the law has no hope of redemption amen
[1:13:04] when you are going to be just judged by
[1:13:06] the law there is no redemption just with
[1:13:09] the law there has to come grace because
[1:13:12] you know grace is greater than the law
[1:13:15] but they have to be together because one
[1:13:18] is going to say you are committing a
[1:13:20] fall you're making a mistake here but
[1:13:22] grace is going to bring you to the right
[1:13:24] path
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:29] the law it doesn't have grace in it
[1:13:31] because law only points that you are a
[1:13:33] sinner
[1:13:35] but grace
[1:13:37] tells you how you can get out of it
[1:13:41] in other words
[1:13:42] the law is a policeman that put you in
[1:13:44] prison but redemption is the one who
[1:13:48] come
[1:13:49] or who can't
[1:13:50] that have come and had paid your price
[1:13:53] of have paid your fine
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:58] now the only way back there you know is
[1:14:00] the law was added in in this i was
[1:14:03] studying about law and grace and one of
[1:14:06] the things that the prophet of god says
[1:14:07] that law was added to bring
[1:14:09] reconciliation to the people in other
[1:14:12] words to bring them uh at peace with god
[1:14:15] because now they could come every year
[1:14:17] and ask for the forgiveness of their
[1:14:19] sins and
[1:14:20] and then go in worship and then they
[1:14:21] come back can go back uh come justified
[1:14:24] but that was it
[1:14:26] it was justification there was no
[1:14:28] sanctification there was not a holy
[1:14:29] spirit
[1:14:31] but now we are living in the greatest
[1:14:33] work that is not just justification it
[1:14:36] is not just sanctification but now
[1:14:38] you're getting even more than that
[1:14:41] you're getting
[1:14:42] the law and you're also receiving grace
[1:14:46] because every day you know the enemy is
[1:14:48] going to come and bring a bad thought
[1:14:50] but what what is grace going to do in
[1:14:52] the name of jesus christ i rebuke you
[1:14:56] that is the grace of god amen
[1:15:04] you know if there wouldn't be the
[1:15:06] prophet of god says that there wouldn't
[1:15:08] be law if you will have you know the the
[1:15:10] where you have the the traffic lights
[1:15:12] and then if you didn't have a traffic
[1:15:14] light that would be a mess that would be
[1:15:16] a you know like traffic all the time why
[1:15:18] because everybody will try to do
[1:15:20] whatever they want
[1:15:21] but the the law was sent so that they
[1:15:24] that you could obey the red and the
[1:15:26] green and so on and so forth amen
[1:15:28] and
[1:15:30] so the brawl the the law
[1:15:33] it brought sin into your view
[1:15:36] you know because before that nobody knew
[1:15:38] what was wrong or was right
[1:15:42] because there was not sin because there
[1:15:44] was no law to say that there was sin
[1:15:46] because when looking came on love was
[1:15:49] added until the perfection came
[1:15:53] because they were under the law for so
[1:15:54] many years but then perfection came and
[1:15:56] then what was that it was freedom
[1:16:00] that's what when jesus came it was
[1:16:01] freedom and he he was like
[1:16:03] they were con you know you read the
[1:16:05] scriptures like they were condemning him
[1:16:07] for everything every single thing he was
[1:16:09] doing whether he he was eating eating
[1:16:11] with his disciples on on the sabbath day
[1:16:14] or whether he was they were they weren't
[1:16:16] they were not washing their hands uh or
[1:16:18] or he was healing in the sabbath day
[1:16:21] they everything was about the law
[1:16:23] everything was about the law but they
[1:16:25] were not seeing the fruits that he was
[1:16:26] bringing
[1:16:30] they were not saying that that men with
[1:16:32] with with the with the dry hand he was
[1:16:35] healed
[1:16:36] they were not seeing that that guy at
[1:16:38] the bethesda pool he he was healed he
[1:16:41] was walking they could they care more
[1:16:43] about about the law
[1:16:46] but what about the children of god how
[1:16:48] you see people when they come to christ
[1:16:50] are you still gonna see them through the
[1:16:52] law and they're still gonna see their
[1:16:54] their mistakes or are you gonna rejoice
[1:16:56] with them because now they have been
[1:16:58] received in the kingdom of god
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:05] lord was sent
[1:17:07] to magnified
[1:17:09] sin
[1:17:13] and all his ordinance is just might
[1:17:15] magnify sin
[1:17:17] but yet that law didn't take away sin
[1:17:22] lord didn't take away sin
[1:17:25] it only brought a man to know that it
[1:17:27] what what that that he was living in sin
[1:17:30] can you imagine somebody telling you hey
[1:17:32] you're wrong but not telling you how to
[1:17:34] get out of your mistake
[1:17:36] that would be frustrating
[1:17:41] but by god's
[1:17:42] grace romans chapter 5 verse 20 it says
[1:17:46] but then law came in i'm reading from
[1:17:49] the amplified version
[1:17:51] to expand and increase the trespass
[1:17:55] imagine you say a lie
[1:17:57] law was coming to expand it and say it
[1:17:59] is a big lie
[1:18:04] making it more a
[1:18:06] apparent and exciting
[1:18:09] opposition
[1:18:11] but how blessed blessed be the name of
[1:18:14] the lord this is because where sin
[1:18:17] increased
[1:18:18] sin increased and abounded
[1:18:21] god's grace
[1:18:23] has surpassed it and increased the more
[1:18:27] and super abound
[1:18:29] when sin abounded
[1:18:31] grace was abounded more
[1:18:36] isn't that beautiful that when you had
[1:18:39] made a mistake and then grace came and
[1:18:42] it covered
[1:18:44] because that the super abundance of the
[1:18:47] lord it was grace were abounded more
[1:18:51] amen now we find that love keeps
[1:18:54] sleeping into the into the picture to
[1:18:56] point the vast extent of our sins
[1:19:01] but what what is happening here sin is
[1:19:03] shown to be white and deep but thank god
[1:19:05] his grace is wider and deeper still
[1:19:10] amen if you can take something out of
[1:19:12] this service this morning take that
[1:19:15] romans 5 20 when sin abounded gries up
[1:19:19] grace abounded more
[1:19:22] lord you paid the price for me lord you
[1:19:25] forgave my sins lord now i can walk in
[1:19:28] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:34] the whole outlook changes sin used to be
[1:19:36] the master of man and in the end handed
[1:19:39] them over to death
[1:19:41] but now grace is a ruling factor with
[1:19:44] righteousness and as its purpose and its
[1:19:46] end is to bring in men to the eternal
[1:19:48] life because law was death grace is life
[1:19:54] how do we come through through to the
[1:19:56] father jesus says you cannot come to me
[1:19:59] if it is not true the father amen and
[1:20:02] that is only bringing us to what to
[1:20:04] eternal life
[1:20:05] to live
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:15] and the scripture says that the law was
[1:20:18] having a shadow of the things to come
[1:20:21] you know it was it was bringing
[1:20:23] something but then
[1:20:25] you know you read
[1:20:27] hebrews chapter 11 and it speaks about
[1:20:30] daniel
[1:20:31] and if you think about it what daniel
[1:20:33] was able to do under the law
[1:20:37] what enoch was able to do under the law
[1:20:40] what moses was
[1:20:42] was able to do under the law how much
[1:20:45] more the prophet of god says if he was
[1:20:48] only living in the shadow of the
[1:20:50] atonement
[1:20:51] what would the christian church do today
[1:20:55] with the reality of the resurrection of
[1:20:57] the lord jesus christ where are we
[1:21:00] standing tonight friends you know if
[1:21:03] moses if abraham if all of them drew the
[1:21:07] law they were able to be witnesses of
[1:21:10] god how much more you that you are
[1:21:13] living under a magnified grace
[1:21:17] how we ought to live this morning
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:25] it will make you to put on the full
[1:21:26] armor of god
[1:21:29] and the prophet of god says and be sure
[1:21:30] to bring the breastplate and the helmet
[1:21:33] and the shield and all those things why
[1:21:35] because paul was likening us to a
[1:21:38] soldier going to battle because you will
[1:21:40] still have to fight for every inch of
[1:21:42] your possession but guess what now is
[1:21:45] not under the law now it is something
[1:21:48] greater than the law
[1:21:52] the prophet of god says if law could
[1:21:54] produce that if law could could produce
[1:21:56] a daniel that would pray he regardless
[1:22:00] the the conditions of the day if loku
[1:22:02] produced an enoch that was changed his
[1:22:05] athens were changed how much more the
[1:22:08] grace of god in the christian today how
[1:22:10] to produce this morning
[1:22:13] what what is the reality of the blood of
[1:22:16] jesus christ should be producing in us
[1:22:18] this morning
[1:22:20] and if we can say this when we're not
[1:22:22] that letter we'll do that or at that
[1:22:25] letter we'll do that and then letter
[1:22:27] will produce that how much more the
[1:22:30] living christ that we have in our hearts
[1:22:33] how much more the resurrection strength
[1:22:35] and power and spirit of the lord jesus
[1:22:37] christ can produce in our lives
[1:22:48] when i was studying that
[1:22:51] was just rejoicing
[1:22:53] just to think about all the the the
[1:22:56] you know the gallery of those the heroes
[1:22:58] of the faith
[1:23:00] all what they were able to do
[1:23:03] but then in the book of heroes now paul
[1:23:05] is saying but like we have encompassed
[1:23:07] all that a cloud of witnesses but now
[1:23:10] he's talking about us what are we doing
[1:23:13] what are you doing with the grace that
[1:23:15] you have received this morning
[1:23:17] are you taking it as a disgrace or are
[1:23:20] you really taking advantage of it and
[1:23:22] are you really appreciating the greatest
[1:23:25] work that the lord is doing in our days
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:31] amen
[1:23:34] in the other the other part of
[1:23:35] redemption
[1:23:38] it was also the the to obtain release by
[1:23:41] the payment of a price
[1:23:44] so if you if you read the book of
[1:23:46] jeremiah
[1:23:48] chapter 32.
[1:23:52] jeremiah he he is there chapter 32 verse
[1:23:55] 8.
[1:23:57] so
[1:23:58] he has he had a vision before this
[1:24:00] happened and he and he's waiting for
[1:24:03] that vision to come to pass
[1:24:06] and in that vision
[1:24:08] if he was told jeremiah your uncle
[1:24:11] uh son or your cousin is gonna come and
[1:24:14] he's gonna ask you to buy a field
[1:24:17] and you're gonna buy it because this
[1:24:20] this this this is for a purpose amen so
[1:24:22] in jeremiah chapter 32 verse eight
[1:24:25] it says so hannah mail my uncle's son
[1:24:28] came to me in the court of the prison
[1:24:31] according to the word of the lord and he
[1:24:33] said unto me by my field i pray thee
[1:24:36] that is in anatoth which is in the
[1:24:38] country of benjamin for the right of
[1:24:40] inheritance is thine that's when we were
[1:24:43] reading in leviticus chapter 25 it says
[1:24:46] that the uncle's son you can buy that um
[1:24:50] that that that that inheritance because
[1:24:53] that's why he says here and that because
[1:24:55] the redemption
[1:24:57] design buy it for thyself
[1:24:59] then i knew that it was the word of the
[1:25:01] lord
[1:25:03] and then what happened here and then i
[1:25:05] bought the field of hannah mail my
[1:25:07] uncle's son that was in anathat and
[1:25:09] weighed him the money even listen what
[1:25:12] he paid he paid 17 shackles of silver
[1:25:16] again redemption taking place here right
[1:25:19] but then
[1:25:20] a knight subscribed the evidence and
[1:25:23] sealed it and took witnesses and weighed
[1:25:26] him
[1:25:27] the money in the balances
[1:25:29] so then he says so i took the evidence
[1:25:31] of the purchase
[1:25:32] both that which was sealed according to
[1:25:35] the law and custom and that with was
[1:25:38] which was open
[1:25:40] so i want you to notice something here
[1:25:43] there was a pull a public copy in a silk
[1:25:46] copy of the contract
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:50] and what we can say is like that that
[1:25:52] was an exact copy of his thoughts that
[1:25:56] were sealed so one was open and one was
[1:25:59] sealed amen
[1:26:00] but now if we bring this as our
[1:26:03] inheritance it tells us that the seals
[1:26:06] needed to be open so that we could see
[1:26:09] what was in the purchase contract
[1:26:14] it had to be sealed for an appointed
[1:26:17] time until an appointed time because
[1:26:20] what's in those seals when the prophet
[1:26:23] was sent to open those seals what was in
[1:26:25] those seals that was a redemption for us
[1:26:29] that's why when the after the seals were
[1:26:32] open it became a new book the bible
[1:26:36] became a new book because now when the
[1:26:39] seals open they reveal what was inside
[1:26:42] of there they revealed that what was
[1:26:44] inside of the contract they revealed
[1:26:46] what was in god's mind
[1:26:50] this is the appointed time this is the
[1:26:53] day that the lord has made let us be
[1:26:55] glad and rejoice in it
[1:27:00] amen this is the appointed time the lord
[1:27:02] opened the seals for us he and this this
[1:27:05] is what is happening with with jeremiah
[1:27:08] because this this was the time before he
[1:27:10] was going to go into captivity
[1:27:13] and the lord was preparing him to say by
[1:27:16] the time you come back you're gonna have
[1:27:18] a purchase you're gonna have a property
[1:27:20] here and you won't be without an
[1:27:22] inheritance
[1:27:24] and that's what the lord did with us you
[1:27:26] know when the seals were open now they
[1:27:29] were just revealing that we have an
[1:27:31] inheritance that we have at the
[1:27:33] authentic body that we can that we're
[1:27:35] gonna go back to a place where we were
[1:27:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:42] isn't that beautiful how the lord is
[1:27:44] hiding all these things here
[1:27:47] he's paying the price and if you see
[1:27:49] that's why when people say you know
[1:27:51] we're not living under the law anymore
[1:27:53] no we are fulfilling the law
[1:27:57] jesus said i have come to fulfill not
[1:28:00] just to fulfill the law but to magnify
[1:28:03] the law
[1:28:05] but even more than that when there was
[1:28:08] when seen abounded grace abounded more
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] prophet of god says hanamel
[1:28:22] he wasn't his neck skin
[1:28:25] so that he know that the the enemy will
[1:28:28] hold the papers and support of this
[1:28:30] place
[1:28:31] but he knew that god will never forsake
[1:28:34] his people
[1:28:35] he knew that god will never leave you
[1:28:37] without an inheritance so when they come
[1:28:39] back and he might have a he had a right
[1:28:42] the right the rightful ownership for the
[1:28:45] inheritance
[1:28:46] amen that's how the lord prepared
[1:28:48] everything for us because we found
[1:28:50] ourselves without an inheritance but
[1:28:52] once you realize who you are now you
[1:28:55] realize that you are a child of the king
[1:28:59] you know as that is slave the prophet of
[1:29:00] god speaks when they brought him from
[1:29:02] africa he was in that plantation and i
[1:29:05] may have said this before but i love it
[1:29:08] what happened with this guy he came in
[1:29:11] and then and then he was eating the same
[1:29:13] he he was being treated the same the
[1:29:15] exact same way and then
[1:29:17] the the the the purchaser came in and he
[1:29:20] was like oh hey can you sell this guy he
[1:29:23] was like no
[1:29:25] do you feed him the same he's like yes
[1:29:27] do you give him beans in water yes and
[1:29:31] and that's it no more no fruit no no no
[1:29:34] no
[1:29:35] not nothing
[1:29:38] now we're very specific right
[1:29:43] gluten-free
[1:29:47] just i'll give you just a cup with water
[1:29:49] with ice that's free of everything
[1:29:53] and what happened with this guy he's
[1:29:55] like well is he gluten-free no he's not
[1:29:56] gluten-free he's not like the eggs have
[1:29:59] to be cage-free and
[1:30:02] pasture-raised and
[1:30:03] all of that he's like no no he it's
[1:30:05] exact same as the others
[1:30:08] so what makes him so so different than
[1:30:11] the others he's like well let me tell
[1:30:12] you something i had the same question
[1:30:15] but there was one time that i asked him
[1:30:17] so what makes you so different
[1:30:20] he said well let me tell you something i
[1:30:23] know that you brought him you brought me
[1:30:24] here as a slave but let me tell you
[1:30:27] something the place where i come from i
[1:30:30] am a child of a king
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:33] what can you say this morning when the
[1:30:35] enemy is coming against you every day
[1:30:39] with every every device that he can what
[1:30:42] can you say but i'm still gonna be
[1:30:44] rejoicing and celebrating the victory
[1:30:47] that he's already given me and i'm still
[1:30:50] gonna say the place where i come from i
[1:30:53] am a child of a king and i am not a
[1:30:55] child of just a king i am a child of the
[1:30:58] king
[1:30:59] amen
[1:31:03] amen that's why when when when jeremiah
[1:31:06] is giving this this promise he's he's
[1:31:09] resting in that now he's like you know
[1:31:10] what now i can rest in this because when
[1:31:13] my people when they come back they will
[1:31:16] be able to go back and have an
[1:31:17] inheritance
[1:31:20] and what happened they he gave the
[1:31:22] evidence of the purchase onto baruch the
[1:31:24] son of neriah the son of messiah and the
[1:31:27] side of uh
[1:31:29] in the sight of hannah mel my uncle's
[1:31:31] son and in the presence of the witnesses
[1:31:33] that subscribed the book of the purchase
[1:31:35] before all all the hebrews in in that
[1:31:38] sat in the court of the prison
[1:31:40] and what does hannah mail mean
[1:31:42] the name of hamel it means the grace
[1:31:46] that comes from god
[1:31:48] it means the gift of god
[1:31:51] he's buying the gift of god and now he's
[1:31:54] telling the lord is now telling us come
[1:31:57] and buy
[1:31:59] freely without money
[1:32:02] we we
[1:32:03] without without nothing just come and
[1:32:05] buy
[1:32:06] freely
[1:32:08] amen prophet of god says glory to god
[1:32:12] sorry verse 14 of jeremiah 32 and this
[1:32:16] evidence which is open and put them in
[1:32:18] an earthen vessel that they may continue
[1:32:21] many days
[1:32:23] why in an earthen vessel
[1:32:26] prophet of god says glory to god
[1:32:29] i hope you will you could catch it
[1:32:31] do you see what god did he never
[1:32:34] revealed it to the highest and prudent
[1:32:37] so they could fuss about it all the time
[1:32:40] but he put it in an earthly vessel and
[1:32:43] he created himself his own son christ
[1:32:46] jesus
[1:32:48] so what was happening in the book of
[1:32:51] jeremiah it was just a type that there
[1:32:54] was one that had the seven seals that
[1:32:57] needed to be opened and that was an
[1:32:59] earth earthen vessel a simple one that
[1:33:03] people were like
[1:33:04] you are the son of joseph and mary how
[1:33:06] can you be called yourself the son of
[1:33:08] god
[1:33:09] but inside of him it was the lord it was
[1:33:12] god
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:14] the prophet of god says in this last day
[1:33:16] now he's opening the seals and showing
[1:33:19] it to his church and he keep it in an
[1:33:22] earthly vessel so it would not kind of
[1:33:24] just rust hallelujah i mean he's like i
[1:33:27] know you think that i'm a holy roller
[1:33:29] but i just can't imagine how he will
[1:33:31] feel when the lord was opening the seals
[1:33:33] when the lord was showing them that it
[1:33:35] was christ the hope of glory now being
[1:33:38] among the people
[1:33:42] he this is this has been kept and
[1:33:44] wrapped in the vessel of the earth that
[1:33:47] was redeemed out of the earth amen
[1:33:52] so what happened in jeremiah's time when
[1:33:54] they go back they can claim their
[1:33:56] inheritance in your time in your day
[1:33:59] right now you can claim your inheritance
[1:34:03] because he hid all of this from the wise
[1:34:06] and prudent and he revealed it to the
[1:34:08] little ones and he's like yes because it
[1:34:10] was my pleasure to reveal it to them
[1:34:16] amen second corinthians chapter four
[1:34:19] verse seven through nine is what we read
[1:34:21] but we have this treasure in earth and
[1:34:23] earth and vessels that the excellency of
[1:34:25] the power may be of god and although not
[1:34:28] of us that's what we were when you see
[1:34:30] the the third when you see clay it's
[1:34:33] very simple
[1:34:35] that's how the lord wants to keep things
[1:34:37] keep them simple the opening of the
[1:34:39] seven seals when we talk about the first
[1:34:41] pull second pull third pull all of those
[1:34:43] things are simple things that only his
[1:34:46] children are going to be able to get
[1:34:47] them because this is a simple a simple
[1:34:49] gospel
[1:34:52] amen
[1:34:54] now
[1:34:58] another example that you can look in the
[1:35:00] bible is is uh ruth
[1:35:03] amen so ruth she also went through a
[1:35:05] process of redemption she she also went
[1:35:07] through the greatest uh work on on her
[1:35:10] day amen and she was able to you know
[1:35:13] she renounced to her family she left
[1:35:15] everything that she had and and she came
[1:35:17] to a point where she was willing to be
[1:35:20] changed because she was like i want to
[1:35:22] receive that that you're talking naomi
[1:35:24] like
[1:35:25] it is it is not just like i just don't
[1:35:27] want to listen to sermons naomi i want
[1:35:29] to see who that boas is
[1:35:33] and she was converted she made a
[1:35:34] decision and and when you come to christ
[1:35:37] you have to make a decision you have to
[1:35:40] take your choice you want to go back to
[1:35:41] the things of the world or you want to
[1:35:43] go on with god
[1:35:46] but if you want to take the way with the
[1:35:47] lord's despise few hold on to god's
[1:35:50] unchanging hand amen
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:56] what do we need this morning the prophet
[1:35:58] of god says we need real
[1:36:00] clean
[1:36:02] cut decisions
[1:36:04] god wants clean cut decisions out of his
[1:36:07] church
[1:36:08] he doesn't want you to be a wishy-washy
[1:36:10] well today i am redeemed yesterday i am
[1:36:12] not tomorrow i don't know no no no no he
[1:36:15] wants you to make up your mind and say i
[1:36:17] am redeemed this morning by the blood of
[1:36:19] the lamb he's already paid the price for
[1:36:21] me and i'm going forward with christ
[1:36:26] and as we said if drew is if under the
[1:36:29] law they were able to produce all those
[1:36:31] things how much more under this new
[1:36:35] new new gospel that we have received
[1:36:38] this bible this new book that we have
[1:36:40] received what we ought to produce this
[1:36:43] morning
[1:36:46] and you don't say lord if you bless me
[1:36:49] and do this for me or so or no no that's
[1:36:51] not a decision you don't come to christ
[1:36:54] with a condition
[1:36:56] you say god i don't care what you do
[1:36:58] with me i'll go anyhow
[1:37:00] if i die i will die
[1:37:02] that's what that's what ruth said
[1:37:05] wherever you go i will go your god will
[1:37:07] be my god your people will be my people
[1:37:09] where you worship i will worship where
[1:37:11] you submit yourself i will submit
[1:37:13] yourself where where you go to church i
[1:37:15] will go to church
[1:37:18] where you like to to your do you do
[1:37:20] yourself i want to die my to myself as
[1:37:22] well
[1:37:23] that was a clean cut decision
[1:37:29] and let me tell you i want to finish
[1:37:30] with this he's interested in you
[1:37:33] is interested in me
[1:37:35] and he is interested to see his word
[1:37:38] made manifest
[1:37:40] but in order for his word to be made
[1:37:42] manifest he is depending on us to do it
[1:37:48] because we are his agents
[1:37:50] nothing in ourselves it is him yielding
[1:37:53] ourselves and walking
[1:37:56] with him
[1:37:58] that's what he wants
[1:37:59] yield
[1:38:00] yield let yourself
[1:38:04] let your word be born in dementia of my
[1:38:06] life lord
[1:38:08] not not more of me lord as
[1:38:10] john the baptist says
[1:38:12] it is needed that i
[1:38:14] may decrease and he increase
[1:38:18] so he has to be
[1:38:19] it has to be the same position that we
[1:38:21] have to have this morning we have to die
[1:38:24] to ourselves every day
[1:38:32] you have to surrender to your own will
[1:38:34] to your own idea
[1:38:37] and you have to surrender it to the will
[1:38:39] and idea of the almighty god and that's
[1:38:41] finished
[1:38:43] let me just finish this one sorry you
[1:38:45] know you say i'm finishing and finishing
[1:38:48] but
[1:38:49] that somebody says that's when preachers
[1:38:51] are lying
[1:38:58] but let me just find this one
[1:39:08] this is what i wanted
[1:39:10] when a man has done something wrong
[1:39:12] his master sold him to slavery
[1:39:15] actually unto death and he is in the
[1:39:17] market he is a slave but a man comes
[1:39:21] along and a worthy man that is able to
[1:39:23] do it and find this man and find finds
[1:39:26] grace in his side he redeems this slave
[1:39:31] and that takes him from the slave
[1:39:32] marking market and takes him out of the
[1:39:35] out to himself but notice and that is
[1:39:39] slave
[1:39:40] slave
[1:39:41] once redeemed
[1:39:43] he can never be sold in the market again
[1:39:48] [Applause]
[1:39:50] amen he can never be sold again because
[1:39:53] now he has been marked
[1:39:55] and if he was thought enough of one time
[1:39:58] to be redeemed no one no one can ever
[1:40:02] sell him again for a slave so what does
[1:40:06] it say about this to us that once you
[1:40:09] were purchased by the blood of christ
