[43:42] we'll try to get that out to you as well
[43:44] as on the bulletin board so in Psalms
[43:47] chap 31 and verse
[43:51] 19 oh how great is thy goodness which
[43:55] thou Hast laid up for them that fear
[43:58] thee which thou Hast wrought for them
[44:02] that trust in thee before the sons of
[44:05] men Thou shalt hide them in the secret
[44:08] of thy presence from the pride of man
[44:12] Thou shalt keep them secretly in a
[44:14] pavilion from The Strife of tongues
[44:18] blessed be the Lord for he hath showed
[44:20] me his marvelous kindness in a strong
[44:24] City praise God for I said said in my
[44:26] haste I'm sure probably each of us could
[44:29] find ourselves here for I've said in my
[44:31] haste I am cut off before Thine Eyes
[44:34] nevertheless thou heardest the voice of
[44:37] my supplications when I Cried unto thee
[44:42] oh love the Lord all ye his Saints for
[44:45] the Lord preserveth the faithful and
[44:48] plentifully rewardeth the proud doer be
[44:52] of good courage and he shall strengthen
[44:55] your heart Heart All Ye that hope in the
[44:59] Lord i' just like to take just a little
[45:02] thought a little word tonight and that
[45:06] is the word preserved preserved may God
[45:09] bless you bless the reading of the word
[45:10] as you're being
[45:12] seated just drawing as we've been
[45:15] looking at Job 23 and and how the
[45:19] steadfastness of the Lord through it all
[45:21] and God's
[45:22] faithfulness and I want to just draw
[45:24] from that verse and verse 23 oh love the
[45:27] Lord all ye his Saints for the Lord
[45:31] preserveth the faithful and plentifully
[45:34] rewarded the proud doer that word
[45:37] preserveth that's right here in the
[45:39] Scripture it means to guard to watch or
[45:43] to watch over to keep to guard from
[45:46] dangers to observe to guard with
[45:50] Fidelity that means with all
[45:51] faithfulness and loyalty to keep secret
[45:55] and and to be kept close and to be
[45:58] blockaded and when we look at this in
[46:00] the scripture we've been uh looking at
[46:03] this for some time on that thought of of
[46:06] faithful and
[46:07] faithfulness and when we look at it in
[46:09] the scripture because it says he
[46:12] preserveth the faithful and so we we
[46:15] recognize that it's it's something when
[46:17] we look at the faithfulness Paul would
[46:19] write of this in addressing in the
[46:22] beginning of every letter he would
[46:24] address to to the Believers and he would
[46:26] say it like this in the Ephesians 1:1
[46:29] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[46:32] will of God to the Saints which are at
[46:35] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[46:39] Jesus he would say in Colossians 1 Paul
[46:43] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[46:45] of God and timotheus our brother to the
[46:48] Saints and faithful brethren in Christ
[46:52] which are at colossia Grace be unto you
[46:55] and and peace from God our Father and
[46:58] the Lord Jesus Christ so Paul is not
[47:02] looking at this address when we speak of
[47:05] faithfulness here we realize that we can
[47:07] be faithful in many different things and
[47:10] I think as we've looked at this for some
[47:12] time that there is always that part that
[47:16] sometimes of of of faithfulness and uh
[47:19] uh where you know a person could you
[47:21] know be so loyal to so many different
[47:23] things and rest upon things and let me
[47:25] just give an example there's people that
[47:28] could just you know be ever so faithful
[47:30] in the regimen of So Many religious
[47:33] practices and yet that is not the
[47:35] faithfulness that Paul is speaking of
[47:38] here I I believe friends I believe that
[47:41] as God is faithful that God himself
[47:44] produces and brings forth faithful
[47:47] people right I believe that because it
[47:50] it cannot it's just like we've heard
[47:52] over and over if a dog begets dog and a
[47:55] a cat begets C cats then how could God
[47:58] beget anything else by the power of the
[48:01] Holy Ghost other than anything that
[48:03] would be like his own kind and it would
[48:06] not then be of Our Own Strength I mean
[48:08] this is what's a paradox that God can
[48:11] take lives and even people that we can
[48:14] see it right through the New Testament
[48:16] like you take the book of Galatians the
[48:18] people of galatia in their natural
[48:21] entity were fickle people they were up
[48:24] and down and persuaded this way and
[48:26] that's just not from the gospel that
[48:28] came to them but it was that's the kind
[48:31] of natured and tempered people that they
[48:34] were but to think of how that the
[48:36] greatness of God would come back along
[48:38] and through that battle where there were
[48:41] those who tried to drag him this way and
[48:43] pull him this way but there's an anchor
[48:45] there's something that could hear God's
[48:48] voice that spoke to them and it would
[48:50] stabilize them through it all that's
[48:53] where all the glory goes to almighty God
[48:55] God that's part of God preserving you
[48:58] and I preserving the faithful and so
[49:02] when we see this with the faithfulness
[49:04] here it is to the faithful that is in
[49:07] Christ Jesus that's so important that's
[49:09] in Christ Jesus he was preaching it to
[49:12] the sav to the called out the separated
[49:15] the set aside and the faithful in the
[49:18] call and so when we look at this in the
[49:22] Book of Genesis 32 and verse 30 because
[49:25] we want to just look at that thought for
[49:27] a few moments the Lord preserveth the
[49:29] faithful and so here is Jacob in this
[49:33] moment after he has wrestled it out with
[49:36] the angel of the Lord and this is a
[49:38] declaration he's made that Jacob called
[49:41] the name of the place pineal for I have
[49:43] seen God face to face and my life is
[49:49] preserved so it is preserved because of
[49:52] God's own life in Matthew chapter 9:1 16
[49:56] it said no man putteth a piece of new
[49:59] cloth unto an old garment for that which
[50:02] is put in to fill up taketh up from the
[50:04] Garment and the rent is made worse I I
[50:07] remember when I was growing up man I
[50:09] feel I graduated when I my mom stopped
[50:11] buying me the double knee pants you know
[50:13] them things stuck out all the time I
[50:16] probably serve some others can
[50:17] fellowship with me around that you know
[50:19] you could wash the rest of the jeans the
[50:20] rest of them would fade except for them
[50:22] Parts on your knees and then if you got
[50:24] a hole on your knee mom was going to you
[50:27] know you know Iron it and put the patch
[50:28] on there and and everything else and you
[50:30] know you had to go around with that
[50:32] patch it didn't look right cuz it wasn't
[50:34] part of the whole garment and this is
[50:36] what God is speaking here that no man
[50:39] putteth a piece of a new cloth in an old
[50:42] garment it because it it it will it will
[50:46] the rent is made worse verse 17 neither
[50:49] do men put new wine into Old bottles
[50:53] else the bottles break and the the wine
[50:56] runneth out and the bottles perish but
[50:59] they put new wine into new bottles and
[51:02] both are preserved now I want you to
[51:06] think of this in this hour even how how
[51:09] the coming of the Holy Spirit and the
[51:11] word coming in our midst in this hour if
[51:14] there was not a group of people that was
[51:17] ordained by God to be able to hear that
[51:20] voice and to receive that word then the
[51:23] word itself would return turn void but
[51:26] God said my word will not return back
[51:30] unto me void and he also said my words
[51:34] are spirit and life so God when he sends
[51:37] a word he's already in mind there's a
[51:40] people on Earth that are ordained to be
[51:44] a place for that word to come into and
[51:48] that word to express and live out now I
[51:51] just say it in this way brother Ram
[51:53] could talk about in the time that he was
[51:55] living and speak of how that was the
[51:57] Golden Age of the Gospel this this time
[52:00] that we're living in and he would talk
[52:02] about the advancement and as you know
[52:04] begin to ponder those things and to
[52:06] recognize we hear the testimonies and
[52:09] the mighty acts of God that was done
[52:11] through the ministry of brother brandham
[52:13] and all of that was for a purpose to
[52:15] declare that he is here that the
[52:18] presence of the Lord is here not
[52:20] something that's far off what's been
[52:22] hidden what's been obscured by the
[52:24] tradition veil of man God has now rent
[52:28] that Veil and is standing in the
[52:30] Forefront of his people and to realize
[52:33] that the message as we are standing in
[52:35] this moment is greater than what it was
[52:39] when it was delivered through God's
[52:41] Prophet because the message is no longer
[52:45] prophecy but the prophecy has become
[52:48] flesh so we're living in a moment and a
[52:51] time that the purpose is that the word
[52:54] would find its Mark in a life in a group
[52:58] of people and that the message itself
[53:00] this word is producing Jesus Christ not
[53:04] just on the church grounds but in our
[53:06] homes in our lives it's affecting
[53:08] everything about our lives it's Jesus
[53:11] Christ that's being
[53:13] revealed both are preserved the word is
[53:17] not just passed through us you know
[53:19] there's a lot of waves going through
[53:21] this building right now that can just
[53:23] pass right through you and have no
[53:24] effect if you're not built I'm not built
[53:26] to pick up cellular waves they're flying
[53:29] all through here I'm not built to pick
[53:31] up Wi-Fi Rays I'm not built for that but
[53:34] there are things that are built to pick
[53:37] those things up pictures and things that
[53:39] are being transmitted through an
[53:41] invisible means there are instruments
[53:45] that are designed to bring forth those
[53:48] waves into a place that we can look at
[53:51] it and see it and let me just say this
[53:53] that seed of God that part that God
[53:56] placed on himself on this on in the
[53:58] earth in your life it is that part that
[54:01] part of God himself that picks up God in
[54:05] this hour and reflects him both are
[54:09] preserved Hallelujah Jude 1 Jude the
[54:13] servant of Jesus Christ and brother of
[54:15] James to them that are Sanctified by God
[54:19] the father and preserved in Jesus Christ
[54:23] and called Mercy unto you you and peace
[54:26] and love be multiplied now in Psalms
[54:30] 9710 David said ye that love the Lord
[54:34] hate evil he preserveth The Souls of his
[54:38] Saints he
[54:56] remember how Jesus could stand in
[54:57] Pilot's Hall he said you have no power
[55:00] over me except it was given to you by my
[55:04] Father which is in heaven is that right
[55:07] Peter would Express by prophecy that it
[55:10] was the predetermined counsel of God
[55:13] that he would appear there and take our
[55:15] judgment but in that the promise also
[55:19] held that he should raise again that's
[55:21] where Peter said it wasn't possible that
[55:24] the grave should hold
[55:26] him amen think of this in Proverbs 2:8
[55:31] he keepeth the paths of judgment and
[55:34] preserveth the way of his Saints oh I
[55:38] love that Psalms
[55:40] 37:23 the steps of a good man are
[55:44] ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in
[55:47] his way though he fall he shall not be
[55:51] utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth
[55:55] him with his hand so a good man notice
[55:59] from verse 23 he delighteth in his way
[56:03] and though he fall he shall not be
[56:06] utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth
[56:09] him with his
[56:11] hand I don't have to go through this
[56:13] building but every one of us have been
[56:15] here at times that maybe in our minds in
[56:19] our spirit in our body with the where
[56:21] there has been though he fall not not a
[56:24] bad man not lukewarm man a good
[56:27] man who is it that gives you and I the
[56:30] strength to get back up the Lord
[56:33] upholdeth him with his
[56:36] hand we would not even have strength to
[56:39] get back up if it were not for the Lord
[56:42] upholding our
[56:44] hand David said I have been young and
[56:47] now I'm old yet I have not seen the
[56:50] righteous forsaken nor his seed begging
[56:53] bread he is ever Mindful and lendeth and
[56:56] his seed is blessed depart from Evil and
[56:59] do good and dwell forever more for the
[57:02] Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not
[57:06] his Saints they are preserved forever
[57:10] but the seed of the wicked shall be cut
[57:14] off I'm glad that he doesn't forsake us
[57:17] the righteous shall inherit the land and
[57:20] dwell therein forever the mouth of the
[57:22] righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue
[57:25] talketh of judgment the law of his God
[57:28] is in his heart and none of his steps
[57:31] shall
[57:33] slide notice where the law is at it's in
[57:36] his heart so none of his steps shall
[57:39] slide we just read in this same chapter
[57:42] of a good man that though he fall the
[57:44] Lord will uphold him with his hand and
[57:48] to think that how when that the word is
[57:51] placed in the right position that none
[57:53] of his steps shall
[57:55] slide in other words to give completely
[57:58] away because there is a strength on the
[58:01] inside I want you to see this the Lord
[58:04] preserveth the faithful it isn't that
[58:07] the faithful are always hitting the mark
[58:09] but it's a God who is faithful to where
[58:12] if we've got off the Mark he's faithful
[58:15] to bring us and line us back up he
[58:18] preserveth the
[58:20] faithful so that none of us will ever be
[58:23] able to stand there on that day and feel
[58:26] self-sufficient in any way and you know
[58:28] this once we begin to feel
[58:31] self-sufficient that we've got it all
[58:33] together we've got all the tees crossed
[58:35] all the eyes dotted that's the very
[58:37] moment that God will begin to pull back
[58:39] his presence and remind you and I that
[58:42] without me you are nothing
[58:47] hallah he preserves the faithful so oh
[58:50] love him all you
[58:52] Saints Psalms 12:6 the words of the Lord
[58:56] are pure words as silver tried in a
[58:59] furnace of fire purified seven times
[59:04] Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt
[59:07] preserve them from this generation
[59:10] forever so God remember God just doesn't
[59:13] reveal his word to be revealing his word
[59:17] right you realize that God can come
[59:19] right down and reveal like it was when
[59:22] John the Baptist stood there baptizing
[59:24] not everybody saw that light that's
[59:26] right John saw it he was ordained yet it
[59:30] was very real it was very present is
[59:32] that right amen there were those as it
[59:35] said when Paul met him on the road uh to
[59:37] Damascus some saw the light did not hear
[59:39] the voice some heard some heard there of
[59:41] a thundering but did not hear or see the
[59:43] light but you see it's it's for in for
[59:46] those that it is intended for and let me
[59:48] just say it if not for God's grace how
[59:51] many times you hear brother brandom say
[59:52] in a prayer line he said oh God help me
[59:55] they're going to miss it Lord their
[59:57] healing their answer was present and now
[1:00:00] it was like it was going to go right
[1:00:02] over their head but God in his grace
[1:00:05] preserves the
[1:00:07] faithful aren't you glad that God sees
[1:00:09] to it that the word that is intended for
[1:00:12] you and I we're not going to miss it
[1:00:15] that that to me does not produce a
[1:00:17] carelessness in my life I'm sorry that
[1:00:19] does not produce of well where a
[1:00:22] carelessness remember a rest and
[1:00:24] carelessness are two different things to
[1:00:27] rest is to where we are delighting
[1:00:30] ourselves in the things of God
[1:00:32] carelessness is where there's no
[1:00:35] preparation there's no inclination
[1:00:37] towards the things of God it's just
[1:00:40] caseras it shall be even as it shall be
[1:00:43] that is not the attitude of the
[1:00:47] believer if Noah would have taken that
[1:00:50] that attitude in the time when it was
[1:00:52] made known to him about the ark there
[1:00:54] would never have been an ark prepared
[1:00:57] there would have been no saving of his
[1:00:59] household but listen it just goes to
[1:01:01] show like it was with Abraham Noah and
[1:01:03] on down God does not reveal his love
[1:01:07] secrets to any life or any heart that is
[1:01:11] just going to look upon them and not
[1:01:13] value them the way that God himself has
[1:01:16] valued them and watched over
[1:01:19] themen I tell you God has watched over
[1:01:22] even the promise of that of the Messi
[1:01:25] God watched over it when you had those
[1:01:26] that rose up and led people astray out
[1:01:29] in the wilderness and saying that this
[1:01:30] all happened before the Lord Jesus came
[1:01:33] along all of these different ones that
[1:01:35] were coming men had their own ideas but
[1:01:38] God watched over his word didn't matter
[1:01:41] how dark it got didn't matter how
[1:01:43] religious it got God watches over his
[1:01:46] word and God will never cave on anything
[1:01:49] outside of it being his word aren't you
[1:01:53] glad that he sends a preparation ation
[1:01:54] for us God will preserve them from this
[1:01:57] generation I want you to think about it
[1:01:59] friends as I stood down there and I
[1:02:00] thought you know uh even when I was uh
[1:02:03] standing down there and uh you know
[1:02:06] there in Jeffersonville and I think you
[1:02:07] know I drive down and many times when
[1:02:10] I'm down there I get out real early in
[1:02:11] the morning I go find somewhere to pray
[1:02:13] and I was just thinking as I going
[1:02:14] around and looking around I'll get out
[1:02:16] real early in the morning I'll go listen
[1:02:17] to a message somewhere and then go and
[1:02:20] pray and I thought about it Lord how
[1:02:22] many people have stood and WR around
[1:02:24] this area right around here that even
[1:02:27] live right here even people that rub
[1:02:30] shoulders with brother brandham even
[1:02:32] that has been right here but yet don't
[1:02:34] know what's taking place it's something
[1:02:38] that's so out in the open yet it is
[1:02:41] being done in such
[1:02:43] secrecy because you know why it's not a
[1:02:46] public show out here it's an inward work
[1:02:50] of the holy spirit that is working in
[1:02:53] the hearts of the people people it's
[1:02:55] even how God brings his word right in
[1:02:57] assembly it the word so touches your
[1:03:00] heart so touches my heart God help me
[1:03:02] Lord help me to live closer to you Lord
[1:03:05] help me to serve you better Lord give me
[1:03:07] Grace to overcome in that area of my
[1:03:09] life why because we are preparing for
[1:03:13] departure amen this is not a civic duty
[1:03:16] here
[1:03:17] tonight that grows old this is not a
[1:03:20] civic duty this is preparing for rapture
[1:03:25] Hallelujah and find out that God always
[1:03:28] you know as it was in the camp when God
[1:03:32] would call his people beyond the camp
[1:03:34] how that God would when he would come
[1:03:36] among them each time God would deliver
[1:03:40] his word to a prophet Amos 3:7 the Lord
[1:03:43] will do nothing but what he
[1:03:45] Reveals His secrets to his servants the
[1:03:48] prophets God Reveals His word first
[1:03:52] because men though having the The
[1:03:55] Written Letter they get off they get
[1:03:58] away from the word of the Lord a
[1:04:02] powerful thought how a person can have
[1:04:04] the Written Letter but yet be in their
[1:04:07] own way of thinking and in their own way
[1:04:10] of thinking build themselves a camp and
[1:04:13] it becomes a selfmade camp and God the
[1:04:17] moment anything becomes self-made God
[1:04:20] makes his departure amen because God
[1:04:23] will never vindicate the word of a
[1:04:26] man God will never come around and
[1:04:29] vindicate and move with that of a man
[1:04:32] but God comes to vindicate his
[1:04:35] word is that right now notice he came
[1:04:38] brother Ram says like this we find out
[1:04:40] he dwelt among the prophets he then
[1:04:43] became a stranger to them talking about
[1:04:45] those of Israel for he dwells only in
[1:04:48] his word to confirm it and the Bible
[1:04:51] said he watches over his word to confirm
[1:04:54] it he's trying to find someone the Bible
[1:04:57] says in Proverbs 22:12 the eyes of the
[1:05:00] Lord preserve knowledge and he
[1:05:03] overthroweth the words of the
[1:05:05] transgressor I wonder standing in that
[1:05:08] day when God sent a word of preservation
[1:05:12] and Noah Noah finding favor with God
[1:05:15] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord he
[1:05:18] began to move and build a boat do you
[1:05:20] realize there were many other
[1:05:23] boats
[1:05:24] there were many other boats that were
[1:05:26] being built but this one there was a
[1:05:28] couple things that was different first
[1:05:30] of all it was God constructed according
[1:05:32] to God's pattern and it was a boat that
[1:05:35] did not need to be brought to water but
[1:05:38] water would come to
[1:05:40] it are you with me God here he was no
[1:05:43] doubt how crazy they thought he was
[1:05:45] because he wasn't a ship Builder he was
[1:05:48] a farmer and he's building the ship or
[1:05:52] this boat out there where there's no
[1:05:54] water around it you know in our modern
[1:05:57] day when they build the ships and even
[1:05:59] they're releasing them they release them
[1:06:01] and build them right there on the
[1:06:04] waterfront right they're not going to
[1:06:06] try to transport them across the land
[1:06:08] but notice when the time would come how
[1:06:11] that God preserved his word how the
[1:06:14] knowledge that had come in that hour and
[1:06:16] when those around there said well there
[1:06:18] there ain't never been any rain and
[1:06:20] there ain't never been anything like
[1:06:22] that and all of this was taken place but
[1:06:25] oh my how that it moved in that moment
[1:06:28] to where that that rain itself be to
[1:06:30] fall and The Fountains of the deep begin
[1:06:33] to break up cuz you realize the Earth at
[1:06:35] one time was standing upright but there
[1:06:37] became one an atomic that got out of
[1:06:39] somebody's hands and it all worked in
[1:06:41] the plan of God and it King Kinks this
[1:06:43] Earth over to a 23 and a half degree
[1:06:46] tilt is that right the prophet taught us
[1:06:48] it was an atomic explosion that got out
[1:06:51] of somebody's hands and it kicked it
[1:06:53] over just like this oh I'm glad that one
[1:06:56] of these days oh my that you and I we
[1:06:58] will not be here for the atomic bomb
[1:07:01] that's to be dropped on This Nation
[1:07:04] there is an escape that is prepared for
[1:07:06] you and I and there will come forth this
[1:07:09] Earth after that time there will come a
[1:07:12] setting upright once again oh my how was
[1:07:16] the words of those who this lived around
[1:07:18] the ark you know there were those who
[1:07:20] lived around the Ark in that hour there
[1:07:22] were those who even had come around the
[1:07:25] ark and said let's just say per chance
[1:07:27] that Noah was right let's just stay
[1:07:30] around here because you know it might be
[1:07:32] right and and so we don't know but
[1:07:35] remember they came at a time and they
[1:07:38] begin to knock on the door Noah opened
[1:07:41] the door they thought well Noah's family
[1:07:43] Noah will surely open the door because
[1:07:46] he is family and yet Noah could holler
[1:07:49] out through there through that door and
[1:07:51] tell him say hey I'm not the one who
[1:07:54] closed the door it was God who called me
[1:07:57] from in the ark to come in here to
[1:07:59] safety I'm not the one who closed it God
[1:08:02] closed it what was it friends what was
[1:08:05] it that allowed every one of those
[1:08:07] animals that had to be there and for all
[1:08:10] of Noah's family to be in that place
[1:08:12] what was it it was God's word of
[1:08:15] preservation that took a hold of their
[1:08:17] heart in life it was God
[1:08:21] preserving want you to think of this God
[1:08:24] is only brother Ram will say it over and
[1:08:26] over God only wants to find a heart that
[1:08:29] he can get into how that God watches
[1:08:31] over his word to vindicate it think how
[1:08:35] Satan wants to set everything out
[1:08:36] remember even through before the
[1:08:39] ministry of Elijah here in the end time
[1:08:42] there was the Alexander dowy up in up in
[1:08:45] Illinois and my they've got their own
[1:08:46] little community and they've got
[1:08:48] Elijah's robe and all of these things
[1:08:50] what was it to try to do take away from
[1:08:53] the original
[1:08:54] but it didn't stop God God is going to
[1:08:57] watch over his word and fulfill his word
[1:09:01] in his time I'm working on that thought
[1:09:03] he preserveth the
[1:09:06] faithful yes God watches over his word
[1:09:11] Isaiah 27:3 I the Lord do keep it so
[1:09:14] there's not one promise that's went by
[1:09:17] in God's mind I will water it every
[1:09:20] moment lest any hurt I will keep it day
[1:09:23] and night my goodness if God can do that
[1:09:27] and remember how the prophet would give
[1:09:28] you and I instructions in our walk with
[1:09:31] God take a promise of God receive a
[1:09:34] promise of God in the right mental
[1:09:36] attitude and it will come to pass why
[1:09:38] because the word itself has within it
[1:09:42] the creative transforming power and if
[1:09:46] we'll take that Word of Promise and
[1:09:48] begin to water it with praise but you
[1:09:50] see many times what we do is we'll get a
[1:09:52] word and we're expecting I want
[1:09:54] something that's instantaneous I don't
[1:09:56] know about you but I hate instant mashed
[1:09:58] potatoes when they go to make them at
[1:10:00] the house keep them I'm not interested
[1:10:02] in them it kind of helps me out so I can
[1:10:04] watch my carbs in the right way I'd
[1:10:06] rather have the potatoes that you know a
[1:10:08] potato was present where there's chunks
[1:10:10] every once in a while that somebody
[1:10:12] missed and mashing brother Samuel you're
[1:10:14] picky well just just a simple example
[1:10:17] that if we can look at it in our own
[1:10:19] lives sometimes we throw in the towel
[1:10:22] instead of doing what God does we want
[1:10:25] God to be the god of his word and God
[1:10:28] said I am a god of my word but act like
[1:10:30] I act take the promise in your heart and
[1:10:33] begin to water it water it with what
[1:10:36] praise not complaints not discouragement
[1:10:40] not negativity come on but water it with
[1:10:44] praise thank you
[1:10:46] Lord well when I see it come to pass
[1:10:49] I'll begin to thank him that's not what
[1:10:51] a Seed of Abraham does Mary Mary the
[1:10:54] prophet said like this Mary was positive
[1:10:57] before she was
[1:10:59] positive why because she had met a
[1:11:02] positive god with a positive promise
[1:11:05] Hallelujah so before I feel anything or
[1:11:07] see anything at all it's finished amen
[1:11:10] the prophet said as soon as you say to
[1:11:12] this mountain be thou removed he said
[1:11:15] there's one little grain of sand that
[1:11:17] begins to turn loose in Yonder world and
[1:11:20] you say there's nothing that took place
[1:11:23] he said oh yes there
[1:11:25] is one grain of sand is a testimony the
[1:11:29] rest of the Mountain's got to
[1:11:31] go now watch this watch this
[1:11:33] preservation the Lord cannot sit down
[1:11:36] indoors and door a book of rules and say
[1:11:38] a word and then come around and deny and
[1:11:41] if you say you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:43] the Bible says a certain thing to do and
[1:11:45] you say oh I don't believe that you just
[1:11:48] remember that spirit in you is not the
[1:11:51] holy spirit cuz he can't deny himself he
[1:11:55] can't deny himself he wrote the word and
[1:11:58] he watches over it to perform it he
[1:12:03] preserveth the
[1:12:05] faithful God's watching over his
[1:12:10] word notice is Psalms 119 verse1 blessed
[1:12:14] are the undefiled in the way who walk in
[1:12:17] the law of the Lord blessed are they
[1:12:19] that keep right his testimonies that
[1:12:23] seek him with the whole heart they also
[1:12:27] do no iniquity they walk in his ways now
[1:12:33] I want to I want to just be clear here
[1:12:34] real quick that watching over his word
[1:12:38] it isn't for you and I with God a
[1:12:40] partnership that is on conditional
[1:12:43] means if you will I
[1:12:46] will cuz that's never worked right and
[1:12:50] it never will right because what what
[1:12:53] God 's desire is is where our heart says
[1:12:56] I
[1:12:58] will right a person can be very very
[1:13:01] astute and have such great uh fortitude
[1:13:05] to be able to stop this and quit that
[1:13:07] and quit this but the prophet says that
[1:13:09] in the message Perfection he said that
[1:13:10] don't prove anything it's where where is
[1:13:13] our heart in the things of God God never
[1:13:16] wanted our head nor our fortitude there
[1:13:18] were men and there have been people that
[1:13:20] are very strong in their mind and in
[1:13:23] their genetics that's not what God's
[1:13:26] after but what God's desire is is the
[1:13:29] heart because when he has the heart that
[1:13:32] in itself will regulate and God can
[1:13:35] control right from that
[1:13:37] seat so it's not if you will I will but
[1:13:41] it is his desire and fervency of his
[1:13:44] word becoming preeminent first place in
[1:13:48] our hearts and that is this the word is
[1:13:51] always right and my idea is always
[1:13:56] wrong that's where the word is coming to
[1:14:00] preeminence that's where he preserveth
[1:14:03] the faithful that's where that you and I
[1:14:05] have to look at all things we might have
[1:14:07] ideas we might have feelings but yet
[1:14:09] when it all comes down to it we forsake
[1:14:11] our ideas and our feelings when the word
[1:14:14] of God is presented before us that's
[1:14:18] giving the word preeminence in our lives
[1:14:21] this is why Jesus could say in John 15:4
[1:14:24] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[1:14:27] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:14:29] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[1:14:32] you abide in me I am the vine ye are the
[1:14:35] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:14:38] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:14:41] for without me you can do nothing if a
[1:14:45] man abide not in me he is cast forth as
[1:14:48] a branch and is withered and Men gather
[1:14:51] them and cast them into the fire and
[1:14:52] they are burned if you abide in me and
[1:14:55] my words abide in you you shall ask what
[1:14:59] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:15:03] that's right see com again God sending
[1:15:07] his word God does not send his word with
[1:15:11] just a a wondering but it's the promise
[1:15:14] behold I send unto you there is a you I
[1:15:18] send unto you Elijah the prophet and
[1:15:23] that you go that is just as known and
[1:15:26] declared and settled from the mind of
[1:15:29] God as it was when the Isaiah broke into
[1:15:32] that channel a virgin shall conceive God
[1:15:36] already knew who it
[1:15:39] was it wasn't that Mary became she
[1:15:42] become such a good girl that God said
[1:15:45] I'll pick her on my team that's not what
[1:15:47] it was she went through battles she went
[1:15:51] through tests it was a persever don't
[1:15:53] you realize even among our young people
[1:15:56] even among others that come around even
[1:15:58] when God begins to start in a life
[1:16:01] friends this is why we need to pray for
[1:16:03] one another because hell every demon out
[1:16:07] of hell it's after our young people it's
[1:16:10] after hearts that make a start for God
[1:16:12] what do we need to pray for we need to
[1:16:14] pray not talk pray God let it be Lord
[1:16:18] they come to a place that they meet you
[1:16:21] let their heart come to that place
[1:16:25] true is that right amen that's the
[1:16:27] greatest thing we can do and I'll tell
[1:16:29] you what the more time we spend in
[1:16:30] prayer the less frustrated we
[1:16:33] become the only reason we get frustrated
[1:16:35] is because we are trying to somehow put
[1:16:38] it together ourselves trying to make
[1:16:41] things happen ourselves we cannot make
[1:16:44] things happen on our own we cannot make
[1:16:46] things happen very clear scripture that
[1:16:48] we quote not by might not by power but
[1:16:51] by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:16:54] Lord is that
[1:17:00] right my God help us amen if his words
[1:17:05] God wants his words to abide in our
[1:17:07] hearts if ye abide in me and my words
[1:17:11] abide in you this is a
[1:17:14] preservation righteousness you realize
[1:17:17] when that takes place in that way that
[1:17:19] God is equipping you with just exactly
[1:17:22] what you have for the moment when
[1:17:24] situations adversaries and things arise
[1:17:27] it might be a thought it might be a
[1:17:29] situation on the job it might be
[1:17:31] something that comes up in the family do
[1:17:33] you realize you have the authority to
[1:17:35] speak to this mountain don't go by your
[1:17:38] feelings because your feelings it'll
[1:17:40] only hinder it but go by what God has
[1:17:42] said you have authority to speak to this
[1:17:45] mountain that's why Paul could pick up
[1:17:48] what David said we having the same
[1:17:50] Spirit of faith we speak under that that
[1:17:53] same
[1:17:54] Authority is that
[1:17:59] right righteousness
[1:18:01] 13:6 or Proverbs 13:6 righteousness
[1:18:06] keepeth him that is upright in the way
[1:18:10] but wickedness overthroweth The Sinner
[1:18:13] the highway of the upright is to depart
[1:18:15] from Evil and he that keepeth his way
[1:18:19] preserveth his soul right you see this
[1:18:23] is where now comes that responsibility
[1:18:26] see God is showing us the way before us
[1:18:29] God is showing us our footsteps this is
[1:18:32] where to step and and as a Believer what
[1:18:36] are we faithful to it's faithful to his
[1:18:38] voice that this is the next step that's
[1:18:41] the next step that's the next step to
[1:18:42] make just like brother Brandon remember
[1:18:44] what happened when brother Brandon got
[1:18:46] all confident in himself I've been out
[1:18:48] here as a guide I've hunted on this
[1:18:49] mountain I've done this and I've done
[1:18:51] that and you know what can you know what
[1:18:53] happened
[1:18:56] right brother BR said you know what the
[1:18:58] Indians call that the death walk cuz
[1:19:00] you're going in circles there's no
[1:19:03] progression whatsoever but finally even
[1:19:06] of all his experiences he finally had to
[1:19:10] come to listen hallu to the voice that
[1:19:15] was trying to speak to him
[1:19:17] hallu you're lost you need help and
[1:19:21] listen friends I wouldn't be too big
[1:19:23] here tonight to say I'm lost I need help
[1:19:25] I wouldn't be too big that if I was lost
[1:19:27] in my mind if I was lost in battles
[1:19:30] going on in my mind if I was lost
[1:19:33] underneath anxiety if I was lost
[1:19:36] underneath a complex I would not be too
[1:19:38] big to say Lord help
[1:19:41] me oh brother Samuel what's that going
[1:19:43] to say about me it's going to say that
[1:19:45] you're a Believer that's got courage to
[1:19:47] say Lord help
[1:19:49] me I think we need got to put aside on
[1:19:51] the acting cuz the ACT ain't getting us
[1:19:53] nowhere it's time for you and I I'm not
[1:19:56] come to church here tonight just for
[1:19:58] somebody else I've come here tonight to
[1:20:00] have a meeting with God I've come here
[1:20:03] yes I come to be one my brothers and
[1:20:05] sisters to be a channel but I've come to
[1:20:07] receive from God I've not come to church
[1:20:10] tonight to see who did and who didn't
[1:20:12] I've not come to see who's up and who's
[1:20:14] down I have come here to receive from
[1:20:16] God and put my lick of fire in that if
[1:20:20] somebody else is down is discouraged
[1:20:23] let's get some licks of fire together
[1:20:25] where the spirit of God can move down
[1:20:28] and bring a charge and encouragement in
[1:20:30] hearts and
[1:20:38] lives oh Lord Jesus help us that's why
[1:20:42] brother Ram says it like this in the
[1:20:44] message thirst he said Jesus said we can
[1:20:47] add one we if we add one word to this
[1:20:50] and take one word from it our part is
[1:20:52] taken out of the The Book of Life not
[1:20:54] one scripture we must take it just the
[1:20:56] way it's written and God watches over
[1:20:59] his word to perform it and we know that
[1:21:02] it's got to be just right now watch this
[1:21:05] no matter what a church would say what
[1:21:07] anyone else would say if you're born of
[1:21:10] the spirit of God you become part of the
[1:21:13] Bible God told Ezekiel he the prophet he
[1:21:16] said take the scroll and eat it then the
[1:21:19] prophet and the scroll became part of
[1:21:22] each other
[1:21:23] and that's the believer when he receives
[1:21:26] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote
[1:21:28] the Bible and the spirit of God is the
[1:21:32] word of God my words are Spirit In the
[1:21:34] Beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:21:36] with us and the Word was God and the
[1:21:38] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:21:40] Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday
[1:21:43] today and forever and when you are a
[1:21:45] part of the word then let something come
[1:21:48] contrary to that word there's a little
[1:21:50] buzzer sets off real quick
[1:21:53] that's right the Lord preserveth than
[1:21:57] the faithful am the faithful who are in
[1:22:01] Christ Jesus the faithful who have
[1:22:03] become part of the word and as God
[1:22:07] watches over the word though men have
[1:22:10] wanted to misconstrue it they've wanted
[1:22:12] to misinterpret it they've wanted to
[1:22:14] misplace it but God watches over his
[1:22:17] word to vindicate it so the Lord
[1:22:21] preserveth the faithful who are the
[1:22:23] faithful they are the word made
[1:22:28] flesh so God is watching over his
[1:22:34] word and God Ain never had a word go
[1:22:37] down and
[1:22:41] defeat never lost a
[1:22:44] battle Hallelujah it might have looked
[1:22:47] like some went down and defeat they
[1:22:49] didn't go down and defeat they were
[1:22:50] victorious yes
[1:22:53] amen well I know so and so they lost the
[1:22:56] battle of cancer that's a lie they
[1:22:58] didn't lose the Battle of
[1:22:59] cancer healing will either come in this
[1:23:02] Dimension or that Dimension over
[1:23:06] there as soon as the transition from
[1:23:09] this Dimension to that realm over there
[1:23:12] cancer itself has not taken
[1:23:15] anybody are you hearing me I know that
[1:23:18] seems like an awful big statement but
[1:23:20] it's true when somebody says we lost to
[1:23:22] this we didn't lose nobody to
[1:23:25] that God Is A
[1:23:27] Healer and there's those standing on the
[1:23:30] other side I don't care what they dealt
[1:23:32] with in this body in time as soon as
[1:23:35] that Soul made its migration in that
[1:23:38] moment the faithful Shepherd was right
[1:23:41] there and they stepped right into that
[1:23:43] other body they never experienced the
[1:23:46] pain no shuffling of Step there waser no
[1:23:48] cancer that's there why it don't have
[1:23:51] any Authority to enter there it's right
[1:23:54] here in this body of sin is where it
[1:23:57] stops but thanks be to God who giveth us
[1:24:01] the
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:08] victory praise the Lord and when we're
[1:24:10] weak the Lord is preserving the
[1:24:14] faithful he's emanating his strength are
[1:24:18] you hearing me he's emanating his
[1:24:20] strength Sarah Abraham the Bible says
[1:24:24] who against hope Abraham daily his body
[1:24:27] getting weaker Sarah weaker their body
[1:24:32] weaker but inwardly he was getting
[1:24:37] stronger he was getting stronger cuz he
[1:24:40] was feeding on the word of God think of
[1:24:44] how that Abraham each moment looking
[1:24:46] over to Sarah Sarah you feeling any
[1:24:48] different today now he could look look
[1:24:49] look he could see her you feeling any
[1:24:51] different today right she said no I
[1:24:53] don't feel any different why would he
[1:24:55] ask her that if he could see it because
[1:24:57] this is where it shows the victory he
[1:24:59] had become into a place to be able to
[1:25:01] live beyond what his senses was
[1:25:04] declaring are you hearing me we're
[1:25:06] talking about Abraham's seed our senses
[1:25:08] want to declare a lot of things that's
[1:25:10] right is that right there's a lot of
[1:25:13] things within our senses and sometimes
[1:25:14] listen friends we can get caught in
[1:25:17] those senses
[1:25:20] right but the Lord preserves the
[1:25:23] faithful am God is the saving strength
[1:25:27] of his
[1:25:29] anointed and the faithful what is that
[1:25:32] of the faithful those who are in Christ
[1:25:34] Jesus those who are in that of the word
[1:25:36] and when he's and when he speaks the
[1:25:39] Sheep know the voice of their Shepherd
[1:25:42] amen aren't you glad about that what a
[1:25:45] rest that brings you in I he's
[1:25:47] preserving the faithful oh my let me
[1:25:50] just let me move on here just a moment
[1:25:52] if we look here in the scripture in
[1:25:55] Psalms 32:7 if you can just skip to that
[1:25:57] that scripture with me thou art my
[1:25:59] Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from
[1:26:04] trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with
[1:26:07] songs of Deliverance prise the Lord now
[1:26:11] let's look at the scripture a minute
[1:26:13] Thou shalt preserve me from trouble it
[1:26:15] really sounds like that there would
[1:26:18] never be trouble come around us that's
[1:26:20] right but he says preserve me
[1:26:22] from it in other words trouble is not
[1:26:27] going to stand Victorious over
[1:26:31] me trouble's not going to stand
[1:26:33] Victorious over you you see God knows
[1:26:36] exactly what you and I need the David
[1:26:38] said he'll Compass me roundabout with
[1:26:41] songs of Deliverance yes amen something
[1:26:45] about
[1:26:46] that you know what when it says that
[1:26:49] there's times where there's got to come
[1:26:51] Str Str God can bring it through songs
[1:26:54] he brings his word but what is it it
[1:26:56] Encompass us about with Deliverance
[1:26:58] aren't you glad that God moves around
[1:27:01] upon our life and God doesn't look
[1:27:02] around and come around us and say look
[1:27:04] at the sorry mess you're in look at the
[1:27:06] shape you're in why you shouldn't be in
[1:27:08] that shape boy you should be good Lord
[1:27:10] we're already down in that shape but God
[1:27:13] comes around us with songs of
[1:27:15] Deliverance and there's nobody that can
[1:27:18] regulate him or stop him why hee
[1:27:22] deserveth he is
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:25] faithful God's Got Confidence in his
[1:27:28] word all that word begins to feel the
[1:27:31] energizing power like the prophet said
[1:27:33] when Samson stood there and he said
[1:27:36] those mechanics when the Dynamics begin
[1:27:38] to hit those mechanics he said it begin
[1:27:41] to move that day
[1:27:47] hallu let me just bring it back here to
[1:27:49] the text psalm 31:23
[1:27:53] oh love the Lord all ye his
[1:27:55] Saints for the Lord preserveth the
[1:27:58] faithful amen and plentifully rewardeth
[1:28:01] the the proud
[1:28:03] doer now when you look at that in the
[1:28:05] Scripture it shows you the two context
[1:28:08] the Faithful Is that when they're
[1:28:10] presented with the word there's a heart
[1:28:13] that says Amen to
[1:28:17] it the proud in that next part the proud
[1:28:20] is he who won't humble himself
[1:28:24] but remember the promise is that God
[1:28:27] giveth Grace to those that humble
[1:28:30] themselves God giveth more
[1:28:32] grace I don't know about you but I need
[1:28:35] more and I want more
[1:28:37] grace humility to his word to his voice
[1:28:41] that's something within that's faithful
[1:28:44] to his
[1:28:46] word watch's this next verse
[1:28:49] here now notice be of good courage right
[1:28:54] and he
[1:28:57] shall strengthen your heart right so
[1:29:01] first of all be of good courage how can
[1:29:04] I be of good courage because you know
[1:29:07] where you're standing
[1:29:09] am Job knew where he was
[1:29:13] standing his way have I taken his words
[1:29:17] have I esteemed more than my necessary
[1:29:20] food job knew where he was standing so
[1:29:23] you can be of a good courage when Israel
[1:29:27] remember Israel Joshua 1 they were
[1:29:29] reminded to be of a good courage but
[1:29:31] what is a good courage a good courage is
[1:29:35] a life that walks in humility to the
[1:29:38] word of God God says turn from this we
[1:29:41] turn from this we go this way we go this
[1:29:44] way even when it don't make sense to us
[1:29:47] but this is what your word says Lord
[1:29:50] this is you're leading me Lord in your
[1:29:51] word we cast down we're tested oh our
[1:29:54] reasonings we're tested with our
[1:29:55] reasoning for come on every one of us
[1:29:58] and I and we're not going to sit here
[1:29:59] and say well I've been undefeated I've
[1:30:01] always overcome my
[1:30:03] reasoning that's a lying
[1:30:05] Spirit we've not there's times we've
[1:30:08] even got caught in our imagination
[1:30:10] thinking somebody don't like
[1:30:13] us I think someone and we've got all the
[1:30:15] big case built up against it oh my right
[1:30:19] things that I'm not just talking about
[1:30:20] fly by night I'm talking about stuff
[1:30:21] that we feel like man I got the goods on
[1:30:24] this and we've
[1:30:28] been
[1:30:29] defeated true see God through those
[1:30:32] times God's not defeated because his
[1:30:34] word comes to speak to our heart and he
[1:30:40] will lead us out of those entrapments he
[1:30:45] will lead us out of those times of
[1:30:48] trouble he doesn't forsake
[1:30:50] us amen because if he forsakes you and I
[1:30:55] that means he's abandoned his
[1:30:57] word are you with me it means God looks
[1:31:00] at it and says can't do it it's too
[1:31:03] great The Situation the hour is too
[1:31:05] great
[1:31:06] remember when God was ready to wipe out
[1:31:09] all of Israel for their
[1:31:10] Disobedience how that Moses move with
[1:31:13] the spirit of Christ and he says Lord
[1:31:16] you better not do it cuz if you do this
[1:31:19] the people of the land are going to say
[1:31:21] you weren't able to keep your word
[1:31:24] that's right what was that the spirit of
[1:31:27] Christ in Moses aren't you thankful for
[1:31:30] the Holy
[1:31:31] Ghost amen be of good courage and he
[1:31:34] shall strengthen your heart all ye that
[1:31:38] hope in the
[1:31:40] Lord I want you to think of this as I
[1:31:42] close on
[1:31:44] this Satan couldn't
[1:31:47] take any of those until God's purpose
[1:31:52] that's right had been
[1:31:54] fulfilled the
[1:31:55] floods could not drown
[1:31:58] Noah there was a purpose to be fulfilled
[1:32:01] amen the Lions could not eat Daniel
[1:32:06] because God's purpose amen was to be
[1:32:09] fulfilled the fire itself could not be
[1:32:12] hard hot enough nor great
[1:32:14] enough to burn up the Hebrew children
[1:32:17] because
[1:32:18] God's purpose had to be fulfilled amen I
[1:32:24] want you to see this God preserves his
[1:32:26] faithful it doesn't mean that God will
[1:32:29] not allow
[1:32:31] troubles not to come it doesn't mean
[1:32:34] that God steps around and you know is
[1:32:36] just all all Ever So garden and he so
[1:32:39] nervous no God
[1:32:42] allows trouble to come brother Bram puts
[1:32:45] it as simply as this right
[1:32:47] here why does God let troubles
[1:32:50] come God harnesses trouble right puts
[1:32:55] bits in its mouth and makes it obey him
[1:33:00] and those troubles bring us into a
[1:33:03] closer
[1:33:05] fellowship with God Amen he
[1:33:09] preserveth the
[1:33:12] faithful God is watching over his word
[1:33:15] amen and the question is are you a part
[1:33:17] of his word are you a part of him have
[1:33:21] you become part of him by one Spirit we
[1:33:23] are all baptized into one body you
[1:33:26] become part of him God is watching over
[1:33:27] his word let me just say this right now
[1:33:30] even before you or I ever come into that
[1:33:33] place that realization that positioning
[1:33:36] God has watched over us all
[1:33:40] along he's been watching over us he's
[1:33:45] been keeping track of us there's nothing
[1:33:48] could take us from the earth until his
[1:33:51] purpose purp has been fulfilled there
[1:33:54] will not be one extra chair at the
[1:33:56] marriage supper of the Lamb there won't
[1:33:58] be one extra or one less theophany
[1:34:01] that's needed every wedding garment has
[1:34:04] already been completed and your name is
[1:34:07] already on a card in front of your seat
[1:34:10] nobody can take your

[1:34:27] strengthen thine
[1:34:29] heart he will strengthen
[1:34:32] you aren't you glad for
[1:34:36] that Hallelujah let's pray
[1:34:43] father Lord

[1:34:49] that indeed
[1:34:52] we are preserved in you
[1:34:56] Lord this is our rest Lord this is what
[1:35:01] the Holy Ghost is it's the
[1:35:04] rest it's resting in you
[1:35:07] Lord de God where as we have become a
[1:35:10] part of you Lord there's we are part of
[1:35:13] one
[1:35:14] another Our Lives Lord the expression of
[1:35:17] it is not something different from the
[1:35:20] word but it's that lord of the word
[1:35:23] that's being made flesh through our
[1:35:25] lives Lord God you
[1:35:28] made the preservation for us Lord in
[1:35:32] this
[1:35:34] hour Lord to see that when troubles come
[1:35:38] may it was a long way of getting to it
[1:35:40] but you never promis Lord in this
[1:35:42] scripture that we read for a text
[1:35:45] tonight that you would keep trouble from
[1:35:49] us you never promised that you never
[1:35:52] promised us a
[1:35:54] picnic Lord I'd be honest and I'm sure
[1:35:57] everybody else would my
[1:35:58] flesh likes
[1:36:01] picnics My My My Flesh my spirit my
[1:36:05] human Spirit it does not like trials and
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] test but Lord Jesus we're
[1:36:17] reminded and we know that the trial
[1:36:20] itself
[1:36:22] the trial is more
[1:36:25] precious than
[1:36:27] gold the trial
[1:36:30] is the trial itself Lord is
[1:36:33] given when you give a word to a
[1:36:36] generation and there's a people that
[1:36:38] will take that word and stand upon that
[1:36:42] word Lord you allow that testing and
[1:36:45] that
[1:36:46] trying to
[1:36:48] begin it doesn't lessen it
[1:36:53] continues reminded Lord that even as one
[1:36:56] word was surrendered in Disobedience we
[1:37:01] know through deception in the
[1:37:02] beginning but walked in Disobedience and
[1:37:05] then every bit Lord how the floodgates
[1:37:08] of sin unbelief entered
[1:37:14] in and Lord God we realize
[1:37:18] that there won't be going one going back
[1:37:22] without every word of God being
[1:37:27] believed Lord
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:31] Jesus lord it's you that comes Among Us
[1:37:35] It's You Lord that makes us Believers
[1:37:39] Lord that brings that reality Lord to
[1:37:43] pass in our
[1:37:44] life I I pray right here Lord this
[1:37:47] morning or this evening

[1:38:01] that's gathered here tonight some that
