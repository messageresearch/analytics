Lord help the man part to step to the side that you might come Lord and speak Lord through our hearts what we have need of we love you and we thank you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen you love him tonight Amen if you would turn with me to John chapter three and so good to be in the house of the Lord Lord willing of Gerald administering Forrest so good to have he and sister mean on your with us Lydia [Applause] certainly would much rather hear him than me and but the reason that I just felt to go ahead and just take even at the service of other jury thing I think the Lord for him being here we'll be ministering here force next week and then the following week when we leave out to go to believers youth camp there in to to minister in that camp I just got to look at my phone I've been this if I don't speak in this week there'll be multiple weeks three weeks or so before I would get a chance to stand back in the pulpit and it certainly isn't like I have to stand here but I also know that sheep get a little antsy so we we want to just you just just be in prayer for us I just want to say tonight some of you were not at the prayer meeting but certainly appreciate your prayers when we were there with indeed the services that we had in New Mexico and the Lord just richly moved among us in a very special way amen many hearts and lives were just so touched amen by it by the Holy Spirit it was things that you know you stand in amazement of how that God starts something and even in times were you know it was just something to wear one minister he would finish and then God had it where the next one would just come right along and you know you don't talk to one another about those things it's just God orchestrated that's wonderful in it we're not under the the Dominion of a man were under the leadership of the Holy Ghost and so I just so appreciate that with all my heart I even in myself I was getting ready to go in some certain directions and I thought nah when I got done speaking I thought man I just couldn't get to that point you know and I was wanting to work with that point knowing the prayer line was coming that night and I and you know when i brother joel came up in the office and he said my goodness he said you had to stop at this point and i began to talk to him and he said this is exactly what had in my notes so needless to say I felt really you know relieved you know of the Lord because and and you know what God really moved there everything I tell you what there were many hearts that lives that were set free many that were delivered with right there in those service many that were filled with the Holy Ghost and souls that were were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so we just thank God that God is still moving amen so here in in John chapter three I'm just gonna read a few verses and we'll let you be seated tonight I don't want to take too long but in John chapter 3 verse 3 jesus answered and said unto them unto Him verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old he can't can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and you and I both know even if you could go back to your youth you still would end up where you are that's why the body changes not just taking us back to young people there's got to be a complete change amen all the buttons about our life have got to be removed the buttons that everybody can push those buttons have got to be gone and their fingers that push our buttons will be gone also over there so we don't want to just go back to being young people that ain't the answer we must be born again and when we're born again then that leads us there to where this body will be born again Oh glory be to God amen verse 5 jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God verse 6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit and Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again that's the truth and not you you should consider it but you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth and soul is every one that is born of the Spirit amen may God bless you bless his word as you're being seated I want to just continue the thought where we were looking at a couple weeks ago well we've been looking on this on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you and I just continue to look at that thought a little bit more tonight if the Lord will help us on that of the kingdom within us and to recognize that a kingdom itself it is truly that of of a domain and it's that of a Dominion and where that we stand as sons and daughters of God to be brought into this kingdom by the king himself and that he indeed is is the the ruler and the director of our lives and brother Branham you know because we we look in this hour and the scripture that we that we can look at Jesus when he said except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and we recognized that it must be that it must be by the word and by the Spirit coming together by the very person of the Lord Jesus Christ making himself known and there there is no way that we're here when the Lord Jesus is is his ministering dystiny además there was nothing within the power of man for a man to be able to birth himself or to bring this about there's not one thing and I once you just kind of hang on to that tonight and let it be like an underlying theme that there was nothing that man could do to bring this about yet there was a longing that was within man even after that Adam fell from where he was and to recognize that where God restores us is not just to back where Adam was but it goes beyond that because wherever Adam was Adam could fall from it but where God takes us back to there is no falling from that and you see what God's desire is to do is to let the nail be driven in such a place within our life to where it dismantles any fear of ever falling away any fear because we're is fear faith cannot operate and God desires that we would operate by the faith and the authority of his work and he is working that is now within our life and so when we look at this Jesus let it be such a clear prescription that is here that when we look at it within this this day and they think of it not just within this day but it has been the very ploy and plot of Satan down through time ever since even the coming of the Holy Ghost it has been Satan's desire to somehow dismantle and take the power of the Living God away from the church Satan did was not worried or did he care how much theology or how right that the church would be in their doctrine but he did not want them to receive the very person of Jesus Christ because when you receive that of the person of Jesus Christ or should I say he receives us then it is his power working in us that makes that word alive and makes it a reality within our lives so Satan has always sought to take away from the very working of what Calvary of what the resurrection of what the whole working of the Lord Jesus would bring us to and that would be that of the new birth and bring us to a life to where Christ would live on the inside of us you think about how in the beginning when Adam went his way and and how that the fall had taken place it Adam himself was under the leadership of the Holy Spirit if you think about it God never spoke to the flesh man Adam and said let him have dominion over the flesh of the sea and fowls of the air but he spoke to the spirit man Adam that man who was created in his own image because it was not the spirit man that would have dominion but it was the Dominion of the spirit man that would be manifest in the flesh body that he was wrapped in soul was God's desire to bring you and I back to that place of Dominion and authority to where there would not be any fear that would dominate the church or the people of the Living God but they would be operating in a true faith and a that God himself would impart into the lives and hearts of the believer so it would be solidly a work of God himself and that's why then when we look at it in this time that we're living in Paul would say that you know not another Jesus that it cannot be another Jesus and we see another Jesus has been constantly presented it's been something because if Satan can get people to believe in another Jesus then they do not receive the Lord Jesus and receiving all that he is because what he was he still is today and so if he can somehow separate them and sever them from that word then remember the Spirit of God it travels with the word and so this is where Paul would would let it be clear to you and I that it's not another Jesus but Paul himself would be burdened by the Spirit of God that to see that the Lord Jesus Christ who is our atonement who is our Passover who is our all-in-all you see Paul takes it to a place to where there's nothing then showing you and I clearly man could do nothing on his own but God has provided a way that you and I might come to what God has desired for our lives in it is not even us that can justify ourselves you and I cannot say to fire ourselves you and I cannot seal ourselves it is God and his sovereign working alone and that's why our faith rest on the power of God and what God has done in our lives glory be to God this is where that when we look at it so often you know you find so many times the where that of the new birth being born again filled with the Holy Ghost these it has M so much of what the reality has been substituted for handshakes substituted for so many things now we don't have to just look out there that's come right in around our message ranks there have been so much that's been substituted for the real reality of the Living God you see when brother Brandon would speak about the true evidence is receiving the word it's not just about agreeing with it it's not just about that you can look at it and say it's the truth but it's where the very person of truth he comes into your life and he declares through your life what you say has been revealed is now vindicated in your life by the power of the Living God are you in so many times then eNOS it has come to a place where it's been diminished to look at and say well I just believe the message or I just believe God send a prophet that devil believes all those things the devil can talk all those things but the one thing the devil never could do he could never get the Holy Ghost Judas could not get the Holy Ghost that one one of them disciples could hold a candle to Judas in the ministering of the word but remember Judas never went off to get the Holy Ghost Oh glory so it comes down to where the Prophet would speak to us improving his word and I've been reading this quote to you but he speaks to us and sells out of these scripture Siri says the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you so you have to understand what this is in you and the only way you'll understand it is compare what it makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do you see this where if you can look at this clearly without me taking a lot of time the devil could try to say a lot of things to you he could try to say you're all worked up it could try to get you to a place to where you get to looking at yourself instead of your sacrifice he can get you to a place to where here you are you're looking at all of your mistakes and your failures and if he gets you to looking at that you're looking at the wrong thing but brother when you can recognize that there has come about a change and a desire in your life and you did not produce that change but for living God produced that change whether however it was that it came to you brother when he comes he is a person and when he sets up there's a change that takes place in your life are you with me and let me just let's just put all traditions to sign you don't have to be in a church come on somebody you don't have to be in a church God will meet you right there when you meet him in the conditions of his world they met God can meet you right at your house for some of you no doubt that's where it did take place you see what it is you stand on is recognizing what has come into you that makes you live the way you do hallelujah the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you huh he's the person then you say amen to that he's the person within you he says now the only way you understand it is compare what it makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you man that's a loaded statement interval journey it's loaded compared what it makes you do you used to do one thing but now you don't do that you do this and nobody makes you do this you do it from a surrendered heart [Applause] something's changed then your problems solved and then he is that holy spirit now remember Jesus in John 18:36 Jesus said when it's standing before Pilate My Kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from thence I know it's not from fence but it's coming you had now we understand when we as we look at this that the kingdom is the Holy Spirit within you and to recognize that the Holy Spirit we we see that that it's not a third person it's not the mascot boy it's a living God the same God who was above us with us now in us remember you and I look at our maybe would touch us on Sunday you and I look at what our inheritance and our rights but let us remember that God has an inheritance and God's inheritance and rights is that he would live and manifest his life in through the life of a believer we are God's inheritance so to look at this that my kingdom is not of this world the kingdom is the person of Jesus Christ remember when Saul remember when the kingdom was departed from Saul Saul still had the title he had a title but the kingdom was no longer with him because the kingdom is that of the anointing of that of the very person of Jesus Christ that had been anointing Saul's life but saw himself he rejected the Word of God and so God removed the kingdom from him and gain the throne of the heart I can't get into that tonight with David but to recognize it was in David that that he became king over Israel again David brought the Lord back in power in Israel through a surrender life he came back to that of the throne oh my that's the same way in our lives oh my now notice you know the kingdom here it's not of this earth so it's not of a man's thinking not of a man's doing it's in our hearts it's a spiritual Kingdom that were born into and the Holy Spirit God's kingdom moving in the man and governing and controlling him that's the kingdom now I want you to look at this in cloth one of the Lord let's look at this here in Colossians 1 chapter 12 I don't know how much of this thought I can get read but we'll just read just a little bit of it here Colossians 1 and verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light he had made us meet that word meet means to be qualified we could not be qualified to receive life without him there is no way you know this is why when it comes down to it when we look at the very prescription of the word repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you can't earn the Holy Ghost you can't merit the Holy Ghost it's not a reward the Holy Ghost is the gift of God where God Himself gives it not because you earned it because if you feel like you earned it and that's the reason you have it you'll live defeat and when you don't feel right but if you recognize that you were not received and the gift was not given because that you are perfect but the gift is given because God can look down into the depth of your heart and he knows you believe every word and he comes down and he seals that heart you see when it's one we we have been received of him brother I'm telling you you recognized there was nothing you did to merit this you walk with the humility of heart not with your nose up in the air where you were drowned out there today come on you rap walk with the humility of heart because you know that there has been one that has ministered to you and acceptance and you have been accepted in the beloved you wonder how am I going to get looser this you know when God deals with the person even for you and I to be qualified God calls a heart and that heart may have all sorts of habits about its life that's still hanging on there and it's holding it but notice he moves down there and he is our sanctification he's the sanctified he's the one who cleanses he's the one who burns out every desire of the world they met and once he gets everything burned out then he steps down on the inside and rather that's why the scripture said we are his workmanship hallelujah he meant he had made us qualified you knew makes us qualified for the rapture he does when it comes down to that day or to that moment he's the one he's our qualifier for the rapture they meant that token in our life is the qualifier glory be to God whoo look at this in verse 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness not a lot not a person delivers come on somebody not a belief a person delivers us Amen a spiritual power of the Living God who hath delivered us this is why Jesus would pick it up there within the scriptures and Luke and in Matthew and to think of how the scriptures would even put it speaking of a strength a greater power coming he would speak even concerning that of Jacob and speaking of the angel the strong one redeemed to Jacob and brother that's the same way within our life there was a lot of things that was strong that was holding off a bondage that we were in but there came a stronger one and the stronger one what did he do he spoiled battle house he spoiled the goods he stripped that one that had rule and authority and power over our life he dismantled that and he moves to the inside and then you know what he tells you you're my witness you go tell what I've done for you you be my witness you're my witness there of the power of God hallelujah Moses can't take your place Jonah can't take your place Elijah can't take your place you've got your place to announce that God is still the same yesterday today and forever his power is still the same we're not serving a historical God but the god of history is the ever-present I am it will have never helped Israel or built their faith if Moses would have went down there in talking to them about a historical God but they had to let him know the god of history then made a promise is the same God now that's fulfilling what was a promise look to the future he is the I am the present God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son the domain the Dominion remember Jesus could say he was in this world but I'm not of it he was walking in two worlds at the same time all right here he was that he recognized the because Satan presented to him all the kingdoms of this world but here it was the kingdom of God and here God was coming back into power remember here how that the Lord Jesus being a type of David here it is moving back into power and and to see how that we're the Bible says that he has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son under that domain under that of the leadership of the Holy Spirit now we're going to look at this here remember the Bible when we look at it in this verse of scripture I don't have time to read all these scriptures here but you know what Paul takes and he Lee he goes through right here in the book of Colossians he brings it up over in the book of Corinthians chapter 5 and he lets it be known even in Romans 5 you and I have been reconciled back to God God didn't need reconciled we did got one lost we were are you with me so God he is alone is the one who made the payment for you and I I wish I could preach this how I feel you know I was witnessing here not too long ago through a man you know he had been a Navy veteran and first of all you know when I always find that out I always think I'm thank you for your service sir I appreciate what you did for us and I begin to talk to him and you know he said at one time I served the Lord I said well well what happened he said well he said you know I got you know some certain things begin to be tangled up and so forth and I said well wouldn't you like to return wouldn't you like to come back to him he said well you know he said I just got he said there's some things right now I got to take care of and you know about that time just the spirit of grace moving in I looked across the tables we sit there in that cafeteria I said sir there's nothing you could do to make yourself acceptable unto God I said you're looking at things in your life but it seems like is bound with this and I gotta get this right and I gotta get that right I said if you could get it right you wouldn't me the Lord Jesus Christ you wouldn't need his power but I'm telling you right now I said the one that I represent I said he's here right now he can release you from every Dominion that's about your life I tell you the Holy Ghost come we begin to speak that of redemption brother the Spirit of God moved right down in that cafeteria and that man began to weep and he said I said you're ready right now he said I'm ready I'm ready you know the word delivered by the spirit got his eyes off himself and put it on the atonement I've just said as plain as I know how if my eyes are on me boy I'm in trouble if your eyes are on you you're in trouble that's why if the eyes can ever and they're placed on the Lord Jesus Christ brother let me tell you keep your eyes on Jesus I hope I can get to where I want to get to you know Jesus here he would express this through through Paul where Paul you know what speak in Hebrews 12 and Paul would speak wherefore we receiving in verse 28 receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved you remember Paul has went through in this chapter and he's laid out there's a difference you and I have not been called to mount Sonia that was law bondage come on now condemnation the law pointed out the transgression all the law did was make us aware we need somebody greater to come and deliver us from the law not somebody who strips the long way and said bellowing no-account we need the law giver himself that he himself the very nature the very life that he would come and write that law by his nature upon our hearts and Paul is establishing this in Hebrews 12 that you and I are not called to that we are called to Mount Zion we are called to that of in company of an innumerable amount of angels we are called to that of the Church of the firstborn that Mount Zion which is a heavenly Jerusalem do you realize what Zion is Zion is the stronghold that David took first before taking Jerusalem Zion is also called Jerusalem and you realize that even right now the manifestation of that life within you and I its announcement to hell in this hour that he's coming into power he had taken Zion brother he's going to take Jerusalem this gospel is fixed and deterred from the Gentiles to the Jews Oh glory we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear so this grace being received it also is grace how we receive a kingdom and that kingdom it's accompanied with grace not disgrace it brings about the desire to serve Him reverently it's within our life that we want to please him he's like a person said well you know I got the Holy Ghost and nothing bothers me and just as the Prophet said you better go back to the altar because you didn't get it hey man when you have it you've got a life that's living on the inside brother and the very that brother Manny that says and it's true you know even the very thought of sin will haunt you is that right you see we're not talking about an idea we're talking about the person of Jesus Christ this is why Paul would pick it up here and for in Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost Paul there's a lot with you dinner with that but I just want to make this lay that down its righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power y'all his power Paul said our gospel come not in word only but with power and demonstration now remember here's the Lord Jesus has asked the question in Matthew 22 29 you know here well here was one you know one who had you know it's had seven husbands and whose wife was she be in the resurrection and jesus answered him and said you do err not knowing the Scriptures they didn't know the scriptures yet they knew but they didn't know him nor the power of God so you see it even shows you and I that even even before the coming of the Holy Ghost listen we see it in the Old Testament the power of God was already there moving upon the children of God are you with me we can look at Zechariah John Elizabeth on and on but even all the way down in through the Old Testament it was the Spirit of God hey let's look at this look at Simeon who was it that called Simeon then you're not gonna die until you have seen the Lord's Christ you see here was a scripture that Simeon had been looking for that it would be fulfilled and the Holy Ghost came to him the Bible says and revealed this unto him and when it revealed it unto him brother what he had been looking for now became a present-day expectation in his life or what was a promise now Simeon could say I am going to see that promise fulfilled in my life I wonder how many down days Simeon had no doubt he had some down days but brother he had a promise he could come back to and rehearse that promise even to himself come on now you talk to yourself and you say a lot of stuff you shouldn't say to yourself come on now a lot of things go I can't believe you did this or I can't believe you said this I can't how about how about taking the promise that is given to you and then recite that promise let that promise be proclaimed the Bible said let the redeemed say so just had a little father my dad but I'm going mark chapter nine verse one here jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God come with power now remember you realize not just speaking of where the coming would be at the setting up in that of the millennium and then carrying on in to the future home but he is speaking here that before that millennium can ever come remember the Millennium is the honeymoon right so then there has to be the kingdom of God must come in power first of all within the hearts of his redeemed children so here we understand you know the fact like the Bible says that from this right here there were many who went aside and started to say things about John well John's not gonna you know John's gonna live too you know to see his coming and there begin to be a saying but Jesus was talking about his coming but he's talking about the coming of the Holy Ghost remember the disciples and we looked at this here the disciples were even looking when they asked the Lord Jesus in acts 1 will you at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel they were asking as we said a millennial question will you do it at this time but you see Jesus let her know it's not for you to know not not not for you to know the times and the seasons there but but he let him know that that it is that he had the father have put this in his own power but he let them know you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you is that right so remember they were looking at the Lord Jesus as one who would have an earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom it was a spiritual Kingdom it would lead to that of a natural let's look at this in Revelations 1 verse 3 oh my in revelations 1 verse 3 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia great unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood hmm he loosed us completely with his own blood the life that was within that blood noticed that blood it had to be a perfect blood it could not be a blood of a sinful man this is why God came down and he created a virgin born body that he might come and redeem you and by shed the blood the price for you and I that we might come back to him it had to be a perfect blood and the life that was within that blood now coming upon the worshiper and bringing the worshiper into that blood cell brother it makes you and I free let me just say it like this a person could have the desire in their heart and never commit it but they're still guilty but when the desire has been removed that is loosening that is washing that is a separation you understand I don't want to go so much you know it can have a pool there can be pools here but brother when there is something on the inside that says I don't want to go that way that's not my desire rather there's been a change come on the inside and let me tell you something to change on the inside will lead this body to a change hallelujah it'll lead it there to such a change to where when we walk in the Millennium Satan is bound with the chain of circumstance Alleluia and that has already entered in our lives through him by the new birth in that of the soul his power is broken amen the sin that once ruled us we now rule it and one time we were beneath it but now through him by the grace of God we have been lifted above it Oh glory be to God in the highest and washed us from our sins in his own blood boy I want to preach so many other things right now but he'll have to wait and he has made us kings and priests unto God his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen I want you to notice a part in the scripture he hath made us Lutheran picks that up and he says there are certain truths that need to be emphasized and he said this is one of them he hath made us we could not make ourselves but he hath made us he is our justification 1st Corinthians 1:30 he is our sanctification amen and there first and there in Colossians 3 he is our life right so now to see here we are king spiritual Kings well when we are going to be Kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now are we spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual Kingdom we are are at war there's a war that's going on a man as Paul said we wrestle not with flesh and blood but with principalities against spiritual wickedness rulers in high places I want you to understand this right here that those powers and rulers that we are wrestling against brother they can outmaneuver us as far as our flesh but when we have been born of the Spirit of God we have within us the very God who even created the devil they men the very God who created all of the angels where in some of those who are now demons they failed that God inside of you and I is the very one who created all of them they're known as fallen angels known as demon spirits and brother to think that the Lord Jesus Christ when he rose the Bible said he triumphed over every principality over every power brother he made a way back there into the throne of glory back to the me tutorial see and he sent back the Holy Ghost into the church and he said the works that I do shall you do also our King is seated in power and they just say it like this when the Bible says in he Ephesians 6 let me drop this because it'd be a few weeks for our speak on a Thursday night I've got a few but let me just drop this you realize the Bible says we wrestle not is that right I got the Holy Ghost nothing bothers me well then you didn't get it the Bible says we wrestle not stand up for a minute I would you exactly up here but it would get carried away now it's just standing right here there ain't no wrestling going on right but if I take him like this and I'll get my arms around him and start grappling with him brother there's some wrestling going on sorry about getting you wet there's some wrestling going on you see we wrestle not against flesh and blood against principalities against spiritual wickedness but this is where the Prophet would speak to us like this he said there's got to be a hidden power on the inside that when the devil tries to get a toehold you know what a toehold is it's where the enemy wants to get you in a submission technique to where you tap out and say you got me there's got to be a hidden power on the inside and that hidden power is not our strength that hidden power is the strength of the Holy Ghost in the believer and God as we walk within this world we are constantly there is a wrestling that is going on it's not our desire there's a wrestling that's going on but greater is he that is in you a hidden power some y'all look at me strange tonight but you know what I'm talking about you can almost get everything in your mind the devil can present so many things to you in your mind and in your mind you don't even look fit but all the sudden there's a hidden power a hidden power that's right there brother he ain't in pretty shorts he ain't all decorated out but brother this one is in power in your life and I'm telling you that kingdom cannot be overthrown I don't care how low you feel sometimes the King of glory is reigning in your life the devil can say all he wants to say he can try everything but there's a hidden power and you know what God will allow the tests the trials the wrestling matches want just to show his glory [Applause] it's like a guy you know going to a boxing match who you plan on fight fighting I'm planning to find nobody you gotta fight this guy in the ring oh no no I just come out here to look at the part I look real good oh you got him out here to fight and you became a Christian God made a pool upon your life and we've not entered a picnic we're in a battleground a battlefield some days you got a battle every inch of the way sometimes there's weeks you got a battle every inch of the way but I'm asking you who is it in you that keeps you born and who is it in you that keeps you expecting and looking its Christ in you I'm afraid of a man or a person that says well I did this and I did that and I did this let me tell you something any strategy that we have it's because of the grace of God that has made known to us something in our lives you say brother Simon you're putting that awful high on Christ I can't put that high like that he already ascended on high he's the one like David said he teaches my hands to war well glory hallelujah for by one man's look how Paul would bring this enrollments for by one man's offense Romans 5:17 death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ let me just say to you like this even for a person that could even come to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior they've got access to power are you with me they've got access to power it's not like well I just received the Lord Jesus Christ brother you've got to realize you've been justified if you don't recognize you've been justified you can never ascend to where you need to be this is why Paul through the book of Romans Paul establishes it in the book of Romans that it is all in Jesus Christ [Applause] amen you can never get anywhere by us pointing ourselves to ourselves well we're trying to get somewhere amen the Bible tells us here let me just kind of move through some of this in second Corinthians 13:4 let me just skip through some of these here for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think I'll just say Lord help me not to limit you in my asking and my thinking help me Lord whether there's nothing that's off-limits with God hey man he wants us to ask him bro drama tell us over and over he said God wants us to ask him for big things I don't know how many of you were still in here when brother Joe sprint was hearing him robber one went through when we went to go to that eat that meal after uh Saturday morning service her brother humors well Joe's friend told the story and here it was here was a man who was a golfer you know here he was he was at a golf club and he golfed with this king those kings of one of those countries over there you know that the king of that country he so enjoyed golfing with that guy so he asked him he said hey he said um you know he said I so enjoyed our game together he said what you know what can I do for you and so the guy said well you know he said I I like golf clubs and things like that and he said okay he said you know he said let that be fine you know so here what happens is is that there was some time that passed by there came a knock on the door and when the knock came on the door here what showed up here was a letter now the man himself was expecting like a golf club that would you know gold and it would have you know some name engraved on it but instead he didn't have a golf club like that but he had the deed to a golf club brother he had a whole resort and the whole thing about it is is that though he only asked for a golf club and that was his thinking it shows that a king doesn't think like that but a king gives you according to how he thinks let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God ask God for big things amen expect big things I say I believe that with all my heart I ask God lot let us be filled with the Holy Ghost let there be a refilling of the Spirit of God you said this is Thursday he's gone of Sunday got a Monday got a Tuesday got a Wednesday he's God asking for big things hallelujah amen we're not talking to somebody else this is our father jesus said if we being evil know how to give good gifts how much more Heavenly Father glory be to God in the house he's able to look at that he's able to do abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church black Christ Jesus through all ages world without end amen the Bible tells the cedar humming just move ahead here real quick it says in Revelations 5 speaking of the hour even that we're living in they're worthy is the lamb that was slain has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth now if you look over in revelations 15 3 this is talking about these are talking about the tribulation Saints that will stand there in Revelations 15 3 but the Bible says it like this and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints who shall not fear thee O Lord and glorify thy name you see they come to that revelation that we are partakers of now the name of the Lord Jesus Christ partakers of that life a point I want to draw out of there thou king of saints think about it he hath made us Saints amen sanctified ones one that have been set apart by him ones that he has redeemed ones that he has brought to himself man he is our King right now can you say amen to that amen he will come forth in power and glory he will take his authority to reign as a king he is coming king of the earth of course that does not say he has not now King for he is our King king of the Saints right now in a spiritual Kingdom you ever wonder why sometimes you get people at work and other places and you wonder why they look at you or act towards you in a certain way now if you're the one that's causing it don't you be calling that the Holy Ghost doing it in you are you with me I mean you can't be a stick in the mud and I'll tell you what the devil's all matter no that's you being a stick in the mud don't you big green don't you be calling the Holy Ghost being a stick in the mud the Bible said he that hath friends must show himself friendly with brother Samuel I can't be friendly the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews I believe it is it says that doing well heaping coals of fire upon their head come on now hey man you've got a strength within you that raises you above the get even oh yeah the devil can come at your flesh and say get even with him but you know that thought can go through it'll sound just like your voice it'll go through but there's a king on the inside that raises the plate Aaron says no vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will repent aren't you glad there's one more pound on the inside and aren't you glad that even when you have slipped up there's one who convicts you and there's one who manifests to you and say I'm gonna overcome through you I'll manifest my overcoming power through your life and you know what it's something beyond our intellect that just simply says so be it more I believe it you with me you watch him working in you what you never dreamed possible Oh my wish I could keep you here all night but I'm not going to just part of it let me just skip down here let me just skip down let me just skip to this right here Jesus let us know remember even in Matthew 6 of how more to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven it's praying that Kingdom Come and Jesus would say in that prayer for us as we recognize I don't let's just turn there I got to read this part right here cuz I my memories not real good on that one right it's alright but I just I just want to read it sometimes you know it is when you you preaching I wish my memory was as it was when I was praying in meditation well now let me find words that here Matthew six okay here it is verse ten or no verse nine after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name that kingdom come that will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen it's to ascribe to him who he is thine is the kingdom the power and the glory no matter what I'm facing fine is the kingdom then is the power dying is the glory this is why Jesus could say seek ye the kingdom of God now I know many times we look at things like this and would say well praise God I've already made it but in Jesus didn't put it that way he didn't say once you're into the kingdom of God where you can just sit out but he says keep seeking keep asking for the kingdom of God brother Branham picks it up in the message desperation he says you keep applying that token and you keep seeking and pressing into the kingdom you know there's not a promise that comes easy every promise itself that God makes known to you the devil is going to be there to try to contest it he's there too trying to contest it but brother this is where that you have to come back to and you remember there that he is your propitiation he wants to try to pour bring up your past I don't care if it's your past from just an hour and a half ago if you have repented and put that under the blood then there is no pass for him to put in your face [Applause] hallelujah that's the strength of the blood of Jesus Christ you don't got to crawl on your hands and knees amen you just submit your heart to God and all these things will be added to you fear not little flock for it your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom no wonder Paul could say I'm ending here don't nobody keep track of how many times I said that now no Aaron you better not be doing that either buddy notice what Paul says he says not as though I had already attained Philippians 3:12 either we're already perfect I follow after if that I'm a upper hand that for which also I'm apprehended of Christ Jesus rather and I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before don't let the devil keep you in the past you let your past be in the past come on now let the black put it in the past Amen forgetting those things which are behind me I gotta say this as it comes to me there was a little woman a little little woman here she was in the south and you know here she was she brought general robert e lee she said said general said here she's this true story generously said here she said i want you to come by this tree he's sitting there looking at this tree and she goes through how i heard you know her husband and different ones were killed and all this stuff happened and everything like that and this one did this to her and this one did that and this tree was a reminder she brought generally to see this she said what should I do cut it down and burn it don't keep going back to that tree and rehashing everything cut it down and Burnett forgetting those things which are behind me gloria i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let me give you another one before we parachute out of here lap four in Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us [Applause] Paul is talking to some sons and daughters of God who have access to be able to lay aside weights things that are slowing you down things that are hindering you let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us surround us entrap us let us lay it aside you know how oh how can you say that how can you point to us and say you lay it aside here's the key verse 2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith that's how looking unto Jesus he is our strength he is the kingdom hey man the kingdom within us looking unto Jesus let us look to him let us stand a man upon his promises of the standards tonight as the musicians would come and I want to sing that song it's already done it's already done the battle is over it's already done the battle has already been won you know God is faithful in our lives he comes in his sets he sets us free he loosens us by his own blood places himself on the inside there's a desire on the inside to live pleasing to him there's things about your life about my life no matter how much you wanted to stop you couldn't stop but then he came now I want you to think about this and just meditate on this when Saul was anointed king of Israel everybody knew it when David was anointed it was a secret anointing nobody knew when David got anointed except his own family you with me but it became manifest in his life that even others could say he's the king he's the king something changed daven never went around and said hey I'm the king now he didn't have to say I'm the king now the kingdom have moved into his life there was a change that when you look at your life in my life you can't explain a reality that takes place that where Christ is seated on the throne of our heart it's no longer you know all I have to do this I've got to do this right it's I no longer want to do that at all I want to live for him my desire is to please him change has taken place a paradigm of birth has taken place and then to think now think of this here that same God living on the inside of you and I he have made us kings and priests and to think that from within our lives now that the Holy Spirit here we are we're tied in there to the medet Oriole seat he already interceded for you and I that that life that we could be received that you and I can even receive eternal life are you with me he already made a way but now that same Holy Spirit within you and I here we are we're tied into that representation we're tied in to his life under that blood cell and he's there to intercede on our behalf to think about it the Bible says in first John 2:1 we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous we have one that when we can go before the throne brother David we can say Lord Jesus forgive me and there's one who's standing there on our behalf and said Father forgive them they didn't mean to do that why because the inside has changed amen the nature's not the same anymore there's one who's standing there on the inside there's a blood that's representing you and I know we wrestle you might have come out of a wrestling match today let me just tell you something I know I said I was quitting sometimes you you take times and you feel like why in the world am I going through this wrestling right now why am I going through this mind battle right now why is just coming at me right now I'll tell you why because Satan knows there's an oncoming blessing that's why Satan wants to get you discouraged he wants to try to give that battle and try to bring fear my brother you have not been made to be subject to fear you weren't delivered by fear are you hearing me tonight you weren't brought to the Lord by fear you were brought by the love of God amen deliver God through you it's a love of God keeping you and I hallelujah we're standing there we're standing there though that wrestling wrestling there's a hidden power there's something that you know greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world drawing me to God hallelu Oh blessed be his name Amen let's let this song be a prayer tonight Alleluia was singing by faith tonight with a real faith looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith it's already done it's already done [Music]

testimony here I had you read this prayer request last week from brother Tom scrolls this was for his his daughter-in-law she was in the Cleveland Clinic it's a little about it brother Tom was there and in service on Sunday down there and bluffed in it he came up for prayer and brother Wayne was ministering it you know he they were putting off the surgery they said it's gonna be two to three weeks or two to three months and then we're gonna send her home woman and jackets on you know because what it is they needed to scrape the heart muscle they said she was it's one of those conditions where they said people just don't live beyond 15 years old she's 30 so whether Tom and them said there ain't no way in the world they said you're not sending her home you can't send her home so brother Tommy came forward brother Wayne you know by the way and asked for the dummy said what do you want to say what do you want what do you want he said I want them to perform this surgery this week so they agreed and prayed now they wanted to call him there on Monday and Monday they were persistent about sending him home but there came a call through and they reversed that decision and said we're going to do the surgery on Wednesday amen God is in control Oh God I'll tell you you know brother Tom was standing there for the time you know there's a Donner role but the Tom said you know he said the whole thing he said I told him you got to start speaking what belongs to you know so much I wonder if we've become socialized Christians we just want handouts come on children remember the sons and daughters of God it's time to claim what belongs to us hey man so here you know brother Tom we went up there and we get up there early on on Wednesday morning just went up there just to pray you know with the sister and the report had come back out of how that God moved down on the scene and how that everything itself I don't let me have maybe I have it on a different part here on my phone of how that God moved right down there on the scene and they took off of that heart muscle they took off after two hours of surgery they took off about 34 grams off of her heart they scraped off that heartless and this morning she was setting up in the chair already now just for the critics enough that there'd be anybody here but I remind you of what the Prophet told us to God performs miracles through surgeries if still a miracle working God amen just two hours right after the surgery they pulled the tubes out for the breathing and here this morning she was setting up in the chair so let's just continue remember sister Melissa strolls remember her in prayer amen that God would just just continue to finish the work with a speedy recovery amen aren't you glad once you're glad he's a living God aren't you glad you know him aren't you glad he knows you amen I'm so glad about that tonight amen he's so good tonight hey man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father lord I I'm just so thankful we're so grateful Lord as a people for what you've done and what you're doing in our midst Lord forgive us Lord for when we have lived beneath our privileges lord I

hearts of your children tonight your God may we not understand and may we not look at ourselves as beggars but God has sons and daughters of God then we would ask you our Heavenly Father there's no

request for that life Lord whatever the request is Lord you have already already it's already satisfied in you Lord you have been made unto our slaughter all things freely giving us all things now the lord I pray tonight may for my heart says we're leaving God to be dismissed from the presence of one another but never from your presence make on our faith be resting in that of the power of God but in orders you deliver the word to our heart to direct our focus the Lord let it be upon you upon you Lord father even from this moment may that testimony in the life in the heart Lord Granite Lord
