[24:43] will would be done in our lives that's

[26:20] we're looking at working for a part to
[26:24] resume and coming back and meeting so
[26:26] I've got more and more things to look at
[26:28] people that I have to contact myself and
[26:31] the Deacons to contact different ones
[26:33] and then from there when a decision is
[26:36] reached I want you to be in step with it
[26:39] to here and now means even when we come
[26:43] to that place that's something that I
[26:45] always want you to feel I don't want
[26:48] anyone to feel pressured at all we're
[26:50] just trying to work to come to a date to
[26:53] where it's available to come to the
[26:55] house of God again so please stay with
[26:57] us on that
[27:00] so we just want to take our attention
[27:03] here our hearts and go right into the
[27:05] word of the Lord tonight and we want to
[27:09] look here in the scriptures and if
[27:11] before we look here in the scriptures
[27:15] once again let's just go to the Lord in
[27:18] a word of Prayer and we just want to ask
[27:20] his leadership here tonight and if you
[27:23] have a need on your heart just make it
[27:24] known to the Lord our Heavenly Father
[27:27] Lord as we just come before you right
[27:30] now we just Oh God just desire to Lord
[27:36] just to submit ourselves and that you
[27:39] would have your way the Lord in our
[27:41] midst we pray that you'll just take
[27:43] control and your God may you just come
[27:46] and just speak to our hearts in a very
[27:49] personal way help me Lord to get out of
[27:52] the way help lower the people Lord for
[27:56] the needs that we would have present in
[27:58] our lives we know that God that you're
[28:01] always on time and that Lord every piece
[28:06] it works together and so we just ask
[28:09] that God that you'll just be here
[28:11] tonight Lord just come and speak to our
[28:15] hearts in a personal way Lord you know
[28:19] our needs and though requested upon the
[28:22] hearts of your children and even as Lord
[28:25] even now as we are looking and we're
[28:28] praying as an assembly that you would
[28:30] just give us the wisdom and the unction
[28:33] and leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord
[28:36] as you have Lord from the beginning and
[28:39] throughout this time we ask that God
[28:42] that you'll just guide and direct us
[28:44] Lord we just want you to receive all
[28:47] glory and honor in the name of Jesus
[28:50] Christ amen amen
[28:53] so as we look here in the book of
[28:56] Philemon and then I want to go right
[28:58] into Philippians once again I just want
[29:01] to encourage you please read the email
[29:04] and if you do have a question of
[29:06] anything throughout there are always you
[29:11] can always contact
[29:13] myself my wife the Deacons the office
[29:17] and we can try to answer the different
[29:20] if there's a question that comes up
[29:21] because we want things to be clear so if
[29:25] anything that we can do to make it clear
[29:27] so let's look here and just I want to
[29:30] read just one verse from Philemon and
[29:32] then I'm gonna move right into the book
[29:33] of Philippians perhaps I'll just let you
[29:35] have your seats after we read this first
[29:37] verse it says Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[29:40] Christ may God bless His Word as you're
[29:43] being seated and I want to continue to
[29:48] draw upon this thought of Paul a
[29:51] prisoner of Jesus Christ but drawing on
[29:54] that thought and looking at it in in the
[29:58] terms of our own life and our walk as a
[30:03] believer because truly there is a great
[30:09] meaning to what is being expressed here
[30:13] in Paul's life and Paul's not the first
[30:16] prisoner of Jesus Christ but remember it
[30:20] was God coming in Christ we see through
[30:24] the prophets it was shadows and types of
[30:27] how that the Spirit of Christ would
[30:31] speak through them and move through them
[30:34] and he would in their lives they were
[30:36] given they were rugged men that were
[30:40] given to the Lord and in rugged meaning
[30:43] not so much abrasiveness of person but
[30:47] that they stood for the Word of God when
[30:51] the nation or whether even those a
[30:55] friend and foe or whatever they stood
[30:58] for the Word of God it was that
[30:59] something that was in their hearts and
[31:02] lives that was so much more greater than
[31:07] anything around them and it was it was
[31:11] that of which they were yoked to and to
[31:14] see that in in Christ God was in Christ
[31:17] reconciling the world to himself now is
[31:21] to restore back what was lost in Eden
[31:24] and all of those parts coming together
[31:27] we see that of a life that was
[31:30] completely harnessed to the Word of God
[31:34] it was the word that was expressed and
[31:37] so Paul is expressing here not the
[31:41] imprisonment of Rome or those bonds his
[31:45] situation
[31:46] Paul is identifying himself as a
[31:49] prisoner of Jesus Christ it's not the
[31:52] only time he speaks of this but Paul
[31:54] would even in one of the other prison
[31:57] epistles in there in Ephesians Paul
[31:59] would speak of this of being a prisoner
[32:02] and you know the difference within this
[32:04] is that Paul himself he was is this was
[32:09] not one who was being held against his
[32:13] own will but to be a prisoner of Jesus
[32:16] Christ is where we no longer want our
[32:19] own will we desire his will it's where
[32:23] our will has been our objectives and
[32:27] things it's it's Christ and him alone
[32:29] that matters and that's what we this is
[32:33] where as we look into the scripture
[32:36] tonight we want to take as Paul would
[32:38] write write an admonition here in the
[32:42] book of Philippians there are many
[32:43] things that would really would would it
[32:46] be expressed and we I know we could go
[32:48] throughout all the scriptures but there
[32:51] are many things and things that are very
[32:54] pertinent and important to that of a
[32:57] prisoner of Jesus Christ and Paul is
[33:00] writing here if we can break in on this
[33:03] in verse 12 and he's writing to the
[33:05] church at Philippi and he said I would
[33:08] you understand brethren that the things
[33:10] which have happened unto me have fallen
[33:13] out rather unto the furtherance of the
[33:16] gospel so that my bonds in Christ are
[33:20] manifest in all the palace and in all
[33:22] other places and many of the Brethren in
[33:25] the Lord
[33:26] waxing confident by my bonds are much
[33:31] more bold to speak the word without fear
[33:36] some indeed now this is where I want us
[33:38] to go some indeed preach Christ even of
[33:42] envy and strife and some also of good
[33:47] will the one preached Christ of
[33:50] contention not sincerely supposing to
[33:54] add affliction to my bonds but the other
[33:58] of love knowing that I am set for the
[34:02] defense of the gospel what then
[34:06] notwithstanding every way whether in
[34:09] pretence or in truth Christ is preached
[34:13] and I therein do rejoice yay and will
[34:17] rejoice now what Paul is dealing with
[34:22] here the Spirit of God here is dealing
[34:26] with this of the motives and objectives
[34:32] that is behind what is actually being
[34:37] preached Paul is not saying in these
[34:40] verses of scripture that what the
[34:42] individuals are preaching is false
[34:45] he's taking it down to what it is that
[34:49] they lie what it is that is actually
[34:51] motivating them to preach Christ so it's
[34:55] going deeper than just what is being
[34:58] heard or what is being what a person can
[35:01] see it's going down into the level of
[35:05] the heart and that's a that's an area
[35:08] that it's not a comfortable area to go
[35:11] into but it's an area that we've got to
[35:14] be deadly sincere and honest and open
[35:17] before God because the journey to the
[35:21] heart is where it requires us of being
[35:25] truthful with ourselves and this is
[35:29] where when we look at this this is
[35:31] something that is a real a real reality
[35:37] of a prisoner of Jesus Christ and I
[35:40] certainly believe with all in my heart
[35:43] that as we grow in the Lord and we
[35:46] should be growing it ought to be
[35:48] something that we can
[35:49] look back from from in our lives and see
[35:53] that by God's grace we have grown from
[35:56] where we were to where we are now or to
[35:59] see there's been growth and what I mean
[36:02] even in that of growth is where we can
[36:04] even see behind us those things that we
[36:08] can look and see God's grace and
[36:10] long-suffering to our lives and now the
[36:14] things that we once were not so
[36:17] sensitive to now we become very
[36:20] sensitive to those things and what I'm
[36:23] talking about is those things that are
[36:25] sensitive to where we are allowing the
[36:28] word to actually examine our heart if
[36:34] the Bible says it's a fearful thing to
[36:37] fall into the hands of the Living God
[36:39] it's one of the things that when we sit
[36:42] here and we hear the word of the Lord
[36:44] ministered I believe that our objective
[36:47] when we come here whether we're
[36:49] streaming whether when we're listening
[36:51] to a message when we're reading when
[36:53] we're praying I believe it ought to be
[36:55] reversed where we are really allowing
[36:57] God to examine our hearts not just
[37:00] coming and and just serving a purpose or
[37:03] serving a duty or just while I'm gonna
[37:06] pray or I'm gonna listen to a message or
[37:08] I'm just coming to the house of God but
[37:10] really where we are coming with the
[37:13] right objective we're coming with the
[37:16] right motive and that is Lord search my
[37:19] heart and if there's anything in me
[37:22] David was open he said search me Oh God
[37:26] try me you see that even takes to where
[37:30] in our in our putting our heart our
[37:32] lives in his hands try me and see if
[37:36] there be any wicked way in me that's
[37:42] part of even maturity
[37:46] because we begin to recognize more and
[37:49] more as we walk along that even the
[37:52] decisions that we make can have
[37:55] influences and impacts upon other people
[37:58] and so it causes us to be more sensitive
[38:02] not fearful that's not what we're
[38:05] talking it's not to bring anxiousness
[38:07] but it should cause us to further trust
[38:10] in the Lord if we find something in our
[38:12] life and we're looking to God in what to
[38:15] do
[38:16] you ought to be something that we stay
[38:18] in prayer don't try to search it out on
[38:20] the Internet
[38:21] don't try to get everybody's opinion on
[38:24] it take it to the Lord in prayer
[38:26] approach it through the right channels
[38:32] suppose he's dealing with this here this
[38:35] is something that he is focusing on that
[38:40] while he is imprisoned and in bonds you
[38:43] have those that have been emboldened to
[38:47] proclaim the Word of God some are doing
[38:50] that out of Indian strife others are
[38:53] doing it out of love so if we were just
[38:56] looking on the surface level we would
[38:58] say oh my every one of them are just
[39:01] everything's just right on but Paul is
[39:04] putting it this is calls goes to if I
[39:07] can say a deeper level it's very simple
[39:10] but it comes down to the discernment of
[39:13] our motives and objectives
[39:21] this is where in the scripture where it
[39:25] talks of how and Paul would say it in
[39:28] verse 18 notwithstanding every way
[39:32] whether in pretence or in truth so they
[39:37] were preaching truth but not in truth
[39:41] there was truth being preached in truth
[39:45] and truth that was being preached from
[39:47] pretence
[39:49] now pretence is that it's a word it
[39:53] deals with a cloak or to cover something
[39:57] or to try or an actual you know pretense
[40:00] it would come from to pretend it's a
[40:03] pretended cause it has all the outward
[40:06] appearances of something but it's
[40:09] superficial it's not genuine it's not
[40:13] something that's really true and so
[40:16] these are things that when we look at it
[40:20] of how God just to think of it like this
[40:23] when God deals with a heart
[40:26] remember God does not want anyone let me
[40:31] just say it clearly a Christian life is
[40:33] not Sulur serving God out of a slavish
[40:37] fear God doesn't want that what God's
[40:44] desire is is the heart a person remember
[40:48] they went away in the beginning remember
[40:51] how the fall came is where Satan began
[40:55] to talk to Eve and it began to pull and
[40:58] it began to move through the word what's
[41:01] he doing he begins to move her away from
[41:04] the objective and motive that she should
[41:08] have been seated in and that was the
[41:10] will of God and to know that God's will
[41:13] is his word revealed and it brings faith
[41:17] and one of her God has made known we
[41:21] stand upon that word and we wait for
[41:24] further light to be shown we allow that
[41:27] word that has come let it be fully
[41:30] operative and work out the purpose in
[41:32] our life it's not then I know this but
[41:35] let me give myself to this Lord let this
[41:38] word search me out that's why we're for
[41:42] revelation revelation comes that our
[41:45] lives might be searched out remember we
[41:48] must walk in the light as he's in the
[41:50] light there's things that where he can't
[41:53] where God desires to reveal his word and
[41:57] to unfold his word to our lives but it's
[42:00] also what our
[42:02] we doing with what God has revealed in
[42:05] our lives are the word that's coming
[42:07] forth and let's just be clear with this
[42:09] when the word is coming forth there are
[42:12] things that may be in our minds it's not
[42:15] our finite mind that's understanding
[42:17] that's not what revelation is revelation
[42:19] is where when our heart and our life
[42:22] becomes quickened and there it becomes
[42:25] like an openness it becomes like then of
[42:27] a vision it's something that just
[42:29] strikes our heart you have ever had
[42:31] things that sometimes you can hear and
[42:33] say I don't quite see that all the way
[42:35] but I know there's something to that
[42:38] there's things that God is trying to
[42:40] deal with our heart in our life that we
[42:43] would give ourselves to him and allow
[42:45] that word to so work in our life so that
[42:48] there God will continue to reveal more
[42:52] and more and more because in that that
[42:55] revelation it's God moving and
[42:58] revelation itself it's more of the will
[43:00] of God being revealed it's what is the
[43:03] word now being revealed his divine will
[43:06] and so when God begins to draw up on a
[43:09] heart a heart has an objective it has an
[43:13] ambition it'll have a motive but you see
[43:16] God will begin to deal with that heart
[43:18] and maybe you know with the love of the
[43:20] world and everything in their heart but
[43:22] God will begin to deal with that heart
[43:24] and it begins to deal with that where
[43:27] their objective in their ambition it
[43:29] really it man that starts out it really
[43:32] has nothing to do with where anyone else
[43:35] is that has already crossed over into
[43:37] Christ but yet there's got to be a
[43:40] starting point are you with me now it's
[43:43] got to be a starting point and this is
[43:46] why even for a life when God is dealing
[43:50] with the heart on how we ought to dress
[43:52] how we ought to conduct ourselves these
[43:55] are simple things even to the giving of
[43:58] our heart when God says repent when he
[44:00] says be baptized in the name of the Lord
[44:02] Jesus Christ what's he doing he is not
[44:05] removing the objective or ambition that
[44:08] that person has that person might have
[44:10] an objective and an ambition
[44:12] hey ma'am they're going to be you know
[44:14] this type of thing was the career
[44:16] they're gonna be this type of person
[44:18] they're gonna be that type of person and
[44:20] it may not be that it may be it may not
[44:23] be that God doesn't want them going that
[44:25] direction but what it is is that they've
[44:28] got their own ambition they've got their
[44:30] own objective do you realize that's why
[44:32] brother Branham says it like this when
[44:33] he speaks to a group of young people in
[44:35] the message leadership of 63 in June he
[44:39] says that when you're young you is a
[44:41] little something that gets projected in
[44:43] your mind and it makes you he said it
[44:46] becomes your ambition he said that's why
[44:49] most conversions take place while you're
[44:52] young because usually when people get
[44:54] older they are set in their ways but you
[44:58] see God
[44:59] notice how God works Paul had his
[45:01] ambitions Paul had his objectives but
[45:04] what did God do
[45:05] God drew Paul to a place to where God
[45:08] didn't strip the objectives out of him
[45:10] but him Paul come face-to-face with
[45:13] something that caused him to release
[45:16] every objective that he had Paul had an
[45:20] objective perhaps to be the the high the
[45:22] high priest he had an objective to do
[45:25] this but he met something greater then
[45:28] every ambition that he had and you see
[45:32] God did not pry it out of his hands he
[45:35] simply met the god of the word and that
[45:39] God was drawing on his life that's
[45:44] that's how God works that's how God
[45:48] continues to work through his word upon
[45:51] our lives
[45:54] he doesn't force himself but he draws
[45:58] that life to complete surrender I think
[46:02] these are very fitting points because if
[46:04] God put the first couple the first
[46:07] family on free moral agency and he gave
[46:10] him a choice he cannot come around now
[46:13] and say I'm saving you it's not even
[46:15] your choice he can't do that
[46:18] you know I'm administering these
[46:20] thoughts from the message a prisoner of
[46:22] Jesus Christ this is exactly God can't
[46:25] take away your free moral agency but
[46:28] remember his spirit his life moving
[46:30] through upon that life that is there it
[46:34] draws it to a place to say Lord I choose
[46:37] you so to become a prisoner is to be
[46:43] fully yoked to his word harnessed by his
[46:49] spirit like a local horse that would be
[46:51] harnessed to a wagon you the word is
[46:55] your anchor point the Spirit of God
[46:57] anchors you in the word the decisions
[47:01] you make the reason you made the
[47:03] decisions you made is because of Christ
[47:06] we have all been tested and we all will
[47:09] be tested and tempted within things to
[47:13] be drawn into certain areas the Lord
[47:15] Jesus was and the Bible says that the
[47:18] devil departed from him for a season
[47:21] it's always where is the enemy when a
[47:24] heart has been harnessed yoked by the
[47:27] Spirit of God where is Satan coming to
[47:30] tempt he's coming to tempt on that outer
[47:33] man on those outer realms that we live
[47:37] in
[47:40] very clearly it'd have been no problem
[47:43] at all if when we got the new birth we
[47:46] received our theophany and our glorified
[47:49] body but you see this life coming into
[47:54] your eye these are the proving grounds
[47:58] this is where that his life inside of
[48:02] his sons and daughters of God and make
[48:05] no mistake about it as he was the word
[48:08] we are the word hallelujah it makes
[48:13] proof in this hour that's why Peter said
[48:16] the tests and trials that come our way
[48:18] they're more precious than gold what
[48:20] does it do it's not proving to God you
[48:22] recognize in your life there's a greater
[48:24] whole there's a greater anchor and what
[48:27] is that anchor that it is the love of
[48:29] God in your soul amen
[48:34] it brings us to a place this is where to
[48:38] be harness is to bring us into a real
[48:42] sensitivity
[48:43] for the will of God
[48:47] that's something that as brother branham
[48:50] and I just want to refer to a few places
[48:52] it's all the way through scripts are all
[48:57] the way through the message but brother
[48:59] branham was asked a question many times
[49:02] about - will of God or how do I know to
[49:05] do this or do that and brother Branham
[49:07] would always and all the way through he
[49:09] said this is there's a standard he said
[49:11] that's in my life and the standard that
[49:14] I have he says is to first find out if
[49:18] it's the will of God that's the first
[49:20] thing God will never lead us to do
[49:22] something that's contrary to his word so
[49:27] it's to come back to the word then when
[49:30] we know it is the will of God now it's
[49:34] to test what is our motive and objective
[49:37] in it and that's the very words that the
[49:40] Prophet used to test our motive and
[49:43] objective in it you know what it means
[49:46] to test something sometimes you have to
[49:47] test the strength of it sometimes you
[49:50] have to test what is in it if you're
[49:52] going and you're gonna run an electrical
[49:54] you know how it is I think when some of
[49:57] the brothers were doing some work back
[49:59] in 99 here or 2000 if that's when you
[50:02] did some of the first remodeling they
[50:04] had this somebody had some kind of a
[50:05] figuring out electricity if electricity
[50:08] was alive they had these two wires
[50:10] running around a light bulb it wasn't
[50:13] anything you could buy in Lowe's or Home
[50:15] Depot or the groomers you know I'm
[50:16] talking about I mean I don't know who
[50:18] made that invention but you know what
[50:20] they knew if I put these two wires on
[50:23] either in that box is live you better
[50:27] not touch that box with your hands they
[50:29] knew somebody go back there and kill
[50:31] that breaker so sometimes the testing of
[50:35] the motive and objective it's not just
[50:39] something that's done real quick but
[50:42] sometimes that testing sometimes it is
[50:44] quick and then there's other times where
[50:46] look with look what where it has to be
[50:48] it comes as we're setting under the word
[50:50] and even as we're praying as we're
[50:53] looking to the Lord there's a testing
[50:55] that's going on it's open to the Lord
[50:58] and even this right here even that our
[51:01] lives this is why that in our lives and
[51:04] I and I trusted we're all very much in
[51:06] tune with this we you need milk when you
[51:09] start out as a young as a young
[51:11] Christian
[51:12] there's no baby that is born that starts
[51:16] eating meat no you don't start eating
[51:19] solid foods huh you start out with milk
[51:23] is that right then as you start growing
[51:26] your appetite grows they start doing all
[51:28] these other things you know the cereal
[51:29] and then the mush and then all this
[51:31] other stuff then eventually you start
[51:33] eating what's on the table but it's all
[51:36] comes in transition in stages is that
[51:40] right but so what we find this is why
[51:44] there must be a progression in our lives
[51:48] by the Holy Ghost this is why this is
[51:52] the the unction of the Spirit of God
[51:54] that we would continue to give our
[51:57] hearts and our lives to him this is why
[52:00] we want to move on with God this is why
[52:03] and I'd say this from the love of God in
[52:05] my heart you should not be setting in
[52:07] the same condition that you were even a
[52:10] year ago much less 15 or 10 years ago it
[52:16] would look like a funny thing if you see
[52:19] me and my age walking around with a
[52:21] Gerber milk bottle you would say one
[52:23] thing for sure the guy hadn't grown up
[52:26] he looks grown up here but there's still
[52:28] something wrong you see it is there for
[52:32] growth and growth is not something that
[52:34] we do on our own
[52:35] but listen we've got to give ourselves
[52:38] to the word we've got to be honest with
[52:42] the word as the word is dealing with our
[52:44] lives this is why we're to be sufficient
[52:48] we should be sufficiently impressed with
[52:51] the word that is in our midst
[52:53] it ought to be something we're giving
[52:56] our lives to God don't set in the same
[52:58] condition you've always been in say God
[53:01] changed me take me higher Lord God let
[53:05] me die more to myself God's not gonna
[53:08] force-feed it
[53:10] he wants you and I to cry out and as the
[53:14] diet changes as the diet increases so
[53:19] does the discernment because remember
[53:24] the spirit moves and it takes the word
[53:28] so as the word itself as we feed on the
[53:31] word this is what Paul was dealing with
[53:33] in in Hebrews five as we feed on the
[53:36] word we're taking in on the word then we
[53:39] have our senses exercised to discern
[53:42] good and evil there ought to be things
[53:47] and I'm just speaking very clearly there
[53:49] up to be things right now that ought to
[53:52] be so clearly discernible it ought to be
[53:56] discernible of things you post or you
[53:59] don't post it ought to be discernible
[54:02] of the things you say or you don't say
[54:05] your attitudes your thoughts your
[54:07] actions I'm just speaking very clearly
[54:10] here you might have an excuse if you've
[54:13] only been coming here for a month or two
[54:15] or a year you might have an excuse but
[54:18] if you've been here and you've been
[54:20] around it ignorance is not an excuse
[54:27] because God is here to speak to our
[54:31] lives and to change our lives the person
[54:36] says but suddenly I don't know if I've
[54:38] got the Holy Ghost or not the message
[54:40] will tell you that you you there is a
[54:43] discernment that can come into your life
[54:46] and I can tell you if you have the love
[54:49] for the things of the world if Christ
[54:51] has not been made alive in your life
[54:54] then you need to ask God Lord fill me
[54:58] with the Holy Ghost and in that feeling
[55:01] God prepares you because remember he's
[55:05] the one doing the work he has to prepare
[55:08] your heart so what should I do give your
[55:11] heart to him say Lord remedy everything
[55:17] that's in me that's not right
[55:22] I'm just gonna just speak just just
[55:25] following his spirit here you see when
[55:29] we look at this this is why brother
[55:32] Randall will make a statement in
[55:33] remembering the Lord in 1963 he said we
[55:37] don't receive the baptism of the Holy
[55:40] Ghost for entertainment there's a
[55:43] purpose would you catch what he said he
[55:45] said we don't receive it for
[55:46] entertainment now what's he talking
[55:48] about is that the genuine Holy Spirit
[55:51] can be poured out upon an individual's
[55:54] life
[55:55] maybe there's something that's wrong in
[55:56] their life and they really need the
[55:59] forgiveness of God so what they'll do
[56:01] they look to God and we believe in and
[56:05] asking God for forgiveness but just
[56:07] don't go away feeling a little lighter
[56:10] load but the same God who lifted that
[56:13] load Savior take me on to a full reality
[56:17] that's the right objective that's the
[56:20] right emotive not just to have it to
[56:24] where it comes down and here we are in
[56:27] the service manner then we have a good
[56:28] time man we had a good time and you
[56:30] leave back out leaving Missy living the
[56:33] same kind of life you're not coming to
[56:35] church with the right motive and
[56:36] objective you've got to come to the
[56:39] house of God with the right motive and
[56:42] the right objective the Lord I need more
[56:46] of you I want something from you oh my
[56:54] this is why I just I'm just offered this
[56:57] here this is why that that that the
[57:00] Bible says in the book of Acts when it
[57:03] talks about Simon when they had went
[57:06] down there and they were laying hands on
[57:08] different ones and they were receiving
[57:10] the Holy Ghost Simon saw what was going
[57:13] on and Simon said he'd reached out and
[57:16] gotten money he said hey here now I want
[57:19] you to give me that that same power
[57:21] whoever hands whoever I lay my hands on
[57:23] they'll get the Holy Ghost to remember
[57:26] the discernment of the Holy Spirit in
[57:28] Peters life let me just say this to you
[57:30] was it a good desire to do
[57:33] desire the Holy Ghost absolutely but his
[57:36] motive and objective in wanting it was
[57:39] wrong he wanted it for self gain I don't
[57:46] have to tell you where that originates
[57:48] from that originates from the very one
[57:51] who instigated instigated the fall in
[57:54] heaven and this is what this is where
[57:58] when Peter by the Spirit of God can
[58:01] discern and say you are filled with the
[58:04] goal of bitterness he said I can see
[58:09] what is in your heart you see here he
[58:11] was wanting it for self gain that's why
[58:15] the seeking of the Holy Ghost is not to
[58:18] add to self but that self might be
[58:21] consumed that that's what it is the
[58:25] evidence the seal when the seal has come
[58:27] when the blood has been applied it shows
[58:30] death has come to that house but the
[58:33] death that has come now there is the
[58:35] life of the atonement upon that life and
[58:38] the seal says death has come here and
[58:41] now it is identified with the blood of
[58:44] the Lamb this is why brother Branham
[58:48] told us in the message token he said
[58:50] it's because of these things why that
[58:53] the Holy Ghost isn't given out so much
[58:55] because people have ambitions I want to
[58:59] be this and I want to be that and I want
[59:01] to do that you see this is what you find
[59:04] and this is what Paul is speaking and
[59:07] dealing with is that what is happening
[59:09] there were men out brethren who were
[59:12] preaching it in truth they were
[59:15] preaching it out of love and then there
[59:18] were others what Paul was in bonds
[59:20] supposing to add affliction to his bonds
[59:24] they were preaching it out of envy and
[59:27] strife
[59:30] remember he's not dealing with the
[59:32] content sometimes our content is dead on
[59:37] it's the motives and objectives behind
[59:39] it this is the same thing between
[59:42] husband and wife sometimes your content
[59:44] can be right on but the emotive zand
[59:47] objectives are off may God help us you
[59:57] see this is why that the will of God the
[59:59] motives and objectives it must be tested
[1:00:03] this is where patience comes in this is
[1:00:05] where being a prisoner comes in I want
[1:00:08] to please him you're pulled to go this
[1:00:12] way
[1:00:12] Paul was pulled to go many ways he even
[1:00:16] nearly had the authority to do certain
[1:00:18] things but he wouldn't do it based on
[1:00:21] his authority he didn't go based on his
[1:00:24] authority he waited for the leading of
[1:00:28] the Lord
[1:00:32] I think that's very good Paul did not
[1:00:36] just go and say well I'm a preacher they
[1:00:38] need somebody to preach I'm just going
[1:00:40] to preach that's going to how Paul wind
[1:00:43] he knew brother Ram would say it over
[1:00:45] and over comes round in Christ the
[1:00:47] mystery and in Christ the mystery is the
[1:00:50] harissa
[1:00:50] it's an unfolding of that seven seal of
[1:00:53] the coming of the Lord Christ coming in
[1:00:55] bright form the capping of a bride and
[1:00:59] what does he keep referring back to a
[1:01:02] prisoner he said the message appreciated
[1:01:04] a a prisoner and he's speaking and
[1:01:08] calling back to that of one who is yoked
[1:01:11] to that of Christ where Christ is the
[1:01:15] one who is reflected through that life
[1:01:18] this is why it's in such simplicity this
[1:01:23] is why when they came to brother Branham
[1:01:25] and many of them wanted him and they
[1:01:27] said my with the gift that you've got
[1:01:29] with the ministry half why in the world
[1:01:31] aren't you taking it in to Los Angeles
[1:01:33] and all these other places these nerve
[1:01:36] centers brother man clearly brings it
[1:01:40] forth it's spiritual food and due season
[1:01:43] he said it's not their food notice the
[1:01:48] change that took place within the
[1:01:51] ministry the change within the ministry
[1:01:54] sure the message was going out but
[1:01:56] remember when the message begin to open
[1:01:59] doors started closing is that right
[1:02:03] doors started closing and now here's
[1:02:07] here's being tested what's being tested
[1:02:10] is back here where remember where the
[1:02:13] Prophet listened to his mother-in-law
[1:02:14] now he's in another situation the tests
[1:02:17] didn't go away the test is still present
[1:02:20] but it's tested will he's planned with
[1:02:23] this word that's been given when
[1:02:25] everybody else who's more learned and
[1:02:27] everything else they're standing against
[1:02:29] it will he stand on this word that's why
[1:02:34] the word must be more than a letter it's
[1:02:37] gotta be that saith the Lord revealed by
[1:02:40] the Spirit of God
[1:02:43] then no matter who else is around who
[1:02:45] else goes this way
[1:02:46] or who else goes this way you know this
[1:02:49] is Jesus Christ revealed from word to
[1:02:51] flesh and in my life I am evident I am
[1:02:55] proof I am fruit of the ministry that is
[1:02:59] coming this hour and to see listen to me
[1:03:05] now as I trying to move this down here
[1:03:08] and you see even in your life you see
[1:03:11] you can tell what is the objective in
[1:03:14] our life the objective is what to see
[1:03:17] Jesus Christ glorified not to see a
[1:03:22] certain group of people not to see a
[1:03:24] certain church not to know is to see
[1:03:26] Jesus Christ and him glorified in his
[1:03:30] people
[1:03:30] it's receives souls that are bound that
[1:03:35] are miserable that where the devil has
[1:03:38] overtaken their life and where lives are
[1:03:41] in shambles
[1:03:41] doing the real objective is in our heart
[1:03:44] it's that people would get to Christ
[1:03:46] because we know if they just come to a
[1:03:49] church that's not enough you've got to
[1:03:52] go deeper than just a church you've got
[1:03:55] to respond and give all heartedly to the
[1:03:59] God who is pulling and pulling upon your
[1:04:02] life cuz you can set in a church and
[1:04:05] rock what where the Spirit of God is
[1:04:08] being poured out why you must move when
[1:04:11] the pillar of fire is moving you've got
[1:04:14] to move by the center what do you say
[1:04:17] let Christ be your objective
[1:04:25] hallelujah my objective was never to
[1:04:31] preach my objective was never to be a
[1:04:34] song leader who now needs to lead songs
[1:04:36] I was just as happy just just serving
[1:04:41] the Lord to get to know I get to come to
[1:04:43] church on a midweek service when we get
[1:04:46] together with some brothers and sisters
[1:04:48] like we would do and listen to a tape in
[1:04:51] their home
[1:04:51] it did me good to know but I made me
[1:04:54] have different ones buddies and we would
[1:04:56] listen to tapes all night long and hear
[1:04:58] Sunday morning hear the dawn the light
[1:05:00] would come in we would get ready and
[1:05:02] come to the house of God he joy it
[1:05:04] drawing my heart if this was not this is
[1:05:07] not why I serve God this is only
[1:05:11] something that God has said son this is
[1:05:14] what I want you to do I want you to
[1:05:15] serve my body
[1:05:16] Lord anything that you desire but the
[1:05:19] ultimate in all things is my heart beats
[1:05:23] for him the objective is for him I'm
[1:05:28] just speaking very clearly from my heart
[1:05:29] my heart has never been in one time to
[1:05:32] make anybody dependent upon me because
[1:05:36] you cannot be dependent upon the flesh
[1:05:39] of Samuel Browning you've got to know
[1:05:42] Jesus Christ in the power of his
[1:05:44] resurrection your revelation has got to
[1:05:48] be personal in your heart in your life
[1:05:51] it's got to be anchored with you
[1:05:54] personally this is why this is why were
[1:06:00] the motives and objectives as they come
[1:06:04] so why the profit would he would
[1:06:06] admonish he would tell us always stay
[1:06:10] with that word empower transformation he
[1:06:13] said always stay with the word always
[1:06:15] check your motives
[1:06:20] they're right if it's according to the
[1:06:23] Word of God if it is God's will and then
[1:06:26] your motives lines up then hold to it
[1:06:33] because you realize that something
[1:06:36] listen to me this is how close it comes
[1:06:39] down something can be the will of God
[1:06:43] but if there's a selfish motive in doing
[1:06:45] it it's the same as not being the will
[1:06:49] of God
[1:06:52] this is where brother Branham talks
[1:06:54] about and how can I overcome and he's
[1:06:57] talking about in lives he's dealing with
[1:07:00] Lot's wife he's dealing with these as
[1:07:02] they start out in the journey and then
[1:07:04] he talks about how Satan can come around
[1:07:06] and you take he said a sister with long
[1:07:09] hair and he said then he said the enemy
[1:07:12] begins to whisper to her and say my look
[1:07:15] at your long hair Wow isn't that
[1:07:18] beautiful and you see what happens is
[1:07:21] she begins to glory in it because of the
[1:07:25] wrong thing so then the doing of it up
[1:07:30] the showing of it all for all those are
[1:07:31] the things and now instead of really
[1:07:34] being correctly in the Word of God it
[1:07:37] now becomes to operate under a wrong
[1:07:40] motive or wrong objective yet you look
[1:07:43] at it and you say my what beautiful long
[1:07:46] hair but you see if the motive our
[1:07:48] objective behind it is not correct God
[1:07:56] looks on the heart man judge it notice
[1:08:03] man judge it after the outward
[1:08:05] appearance paul here having the Ministry
[1:08:10] of God the revelation what does it do it
[1:08:13] brings it down to the heart oh we ought
[1:08:15] to rejoice in that because every trap
[1:08:18] that you and I have fallen into and
[1:08:20] every mistake that we are made guess
[1:08:23] where it comes down to God looks upon
[1:08:25] the heart he deals with the heart and we
[1:08:28] said Lord forgive me I didn't mean to
[1:08:30] make that direction and the Holy Spirit
[1:08:32] it brings conviction why because the
[1:08:35] word has caused us to look upon the
[1:08:37] heart Oh glory thank God for the
[1:08:42] discernment of the word you see the
[1:08:45] Spirit of God it is to come through the
[1:08:49] word
[1:08:52] this is why when David would write in
[1:08:57] Psalm 51 he would write thou desirest
[1:09:01] truth after the inward parts
[1:09:08] Jesus when he cut here here's the Spirit
[1:09:11] of God moving in the word and that out
[1:09:14] coming through the word and he looks
[1:09:16] upon him
[1:09:17] and let me just without having to read
[1:09:20] him let me just preach from he did the
[1:09:24] Spirit of God discerns what nobody else
[1:09:27] can see they have long robes they like
[1:09:32] to be greeted in the marketplace they
[1:09:36] they wanted to chief seats and when it
[1:09:39] came to widows house they would make a
[1:09:42] long prayer and Jesus said you do it in
[1:09:46] pretense and because you know what
[1:09:49] you're doing and he said because of it
[1:09:51] you'll receive the greater damnation
[1:09:55] they were doing something without being
[1:09:58] genuine in their heart this is what a
[1:10:03] real prisoner comes to is what is to be
[1:10:06] done is from a soul jigna whiteness from
[1:10:10] our soul God let every one of our
[1:10:15] motives and our objectives be discerned
[1:10:18] by his spirit anything that's not like
[1:10:22] him
[1:10:22] let it be removed powered you know Jesus
[1:10:27] would also move and speak to that where
[1:10:32] he would say beware of false prophets
[1:10:35] that here they come in sheep's clothing
[1:10:41] in sheep's clothing but inwardly they
[1:10:45] are raving wolves see what the word does
[1:10:49] now when he makes that statement here
[1:10:52] look look when he makes the statement
[1:10:53] their question is now the notice the
[1:10:56] question how will I know how will I know
[1:10:59] because outwardly all of our senses
[1:11:02] Howard Lee would say they're spot-on but
[1:11:05] you see the Spirit of God it reveals
[1:11:08] what's there listen to me now if this is
[1:11:11] not in any way projecting to you and I
[1:11:14] that all of a sudden we walk into a
[1:11:16] service and we say oh this one or oh
[1:11:19] that one that's not what we're talking
[1:11:21] about neither and let me just spend let
[1:11:23] me just stop this call out right now me
[1:11:26] there is it for us to glory and say hmm
[1:11:29] I always knew there was something about
[1:11:31] that person I always that's and brings
[1:11:33] that's not the discernment we're talking
[1:11:35] about come on now
[1:11:37] only thing that does is give you glory
[1:11:38] that don't give God glory let's just be
[1:11:42] honest there are things that we have
[1:11:44] seen and it has shocked us where people
[1:11:48] have went certain directions and we just
[1:11:51] going to be honest about it it shocks us
[1:11:53] but here's where it comes to show you
[1:11:55] and I it's not about our natural
[1:11:59] abilities but it comes down to the fruit
[1:12:02] of the word and the fruit notice by
[1:12:04] their fruits they are known what is the
[1:12:07] fruit are they teaching the word for
[1:12:10] this season in power and demonstration
[1:12:14] amen is it the fruit here the fruit by
[1:12:18] their fruit Jesus let it be known they
[1:12:21] can go right in where the vine is at
[1:12:25] right
[1:12:26] you gather grapes of thorns or figs of
[1:12:29] thistles he lets it be known these
[1:12:31] things can grow riding around what makes
[1:12:33] the difference what's in the roots
[1:12:36] what's in the roots Oh aren't you glad
[1:12:40] that your roots are founded in Jesus
[1:12:42] Christ this is why Paul would Paul would
[1:12:46] pick this same found up and I'm just I'm
[1:12:47] moving over these scriptures that I have
[1:12:49] here because just following the his
[1:12:51] direction on it Paul would come to that
[1:12:54] place and Paul would let him know before
[1:12:56] his departure previous wolves are going
[1:12:59] to enter in previous wolves but they
[1:13:03] look like sheep's clothing but notice
[1:13:07] where Paul what's Paul's approach Paul's
[1:13:10] approach is not something where he's
[1:13:13] nervous
[1:13:15] what does he say I commend you to the
[1:13:19] word of grace that is able to build you
[1:13:21] up he spoke to the overseers take heed
[1:13:25] lay in the Word of God as anybody told
[1:13:28] Timothy lay in that word stand upon that
[1:13:32] word why because of of wolves previous
[1:13:38] wolves that would enter in Paul is
[1:13:41] addressing men who would have other
[1:13:44] objectives than the objective of Christ
[1:13:48] brother Branham put it just this simple
[1:13:50] he called it the Pentecostal objective
[1:13:54] and the Pentecostal objective is when
[1:13:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come
[1:13:59] into our heart then it's no longer
[1:14:01] either liveth it's Christ that liveth
[1:14:05] that's the real objective this is what
[1:14:09] Paul and let me just pick it up Paul
[1:14:12] would say because of this revelation in
[1:14:15] 2nd Corinthians 4 what we have received
[1:14:18] because what we have received we have
[1:14:21] renounced all hidden things of
[1:14:23] dishonesty let me just bring this down
[1:14:26] real clear that's everything that God
[1:14:29] deals with our heart on
[1:14:33] not handling the Word of God in
[1:14:35] craftiness or deceitfully but by
[1:14:38] manifestation of the truth commending
[1:14:42] ourselves under every man's conscience
[1:14:44] look look look
[1:14:46] how the Holy Spirit would deal with the
[1:14:48] prophets life back in 56 then again in
[1:14:52] NMM in 60 there in the adoption series
[1:14:55] you find it in you know throughout no
[1:15:00] one he said I'd become critical and
[1:15:03] hearing liked likened criticalness to a
[1:15:06] selfish spirit that I've gotta tell
[1:15:09] everybody that they're they're there
[1:15:11] they're wrong and I'm right and this and
[1:15:12] that see when this is what I'm saying to
[1:15:15] say you see with the word that has come
[1:15:18] that word though here the prophet we're
[1:15:20] here it was in the humanity was moving
[1:15:23] in that direction but the Spirit of God
[1:15:25] would bring that that discretion to his
[1:15:29] life and II recognize wait a minute here
[1:15:32] Who am I see this is renouncing all
[1:15:37] things of dishonesty because why if he
[1:15:41] doesn't get that cleared out the word
[1:15:44] will come forth and that travels with it
[1:15:47] you gotta get that cleared out
[1:15:50] is that right so you see this is where
[1:15:55] when we when we we understand this that
[1:15:59] these things the motive and objective of
[1:16:02] how it would come to try to draw away
[1:16:05] from the real purpose and the real
[1:16:08] objective and let me just try to to to
[1:16:13] to wrap some of these points up here
[1:16:15] Paul would tell us in another place here
[1:16:20] in Philippians let me just just to skip
[1:16:23] over a few things in Philippians chapter
[1:16:26] 2 verse 20 and he's talking about
[1:16:30] Timothy for I have no man like-minded
[1:16:34] that means equal in Soul
[1:16:38] who will naturally care for your state
[1:16:44] that was made known and revealed where
[1:16:48] Paul could express that Timothy has the
[1:16:51] same objective hello let me just tell
[1:16:57] you just as the profit in this age the
[1:17:01] one of the last paragraphs in resume of
[1:17:04] the church ages in the church age book
[1:17:06] inside of the tape case as well he says
[1:17:09] not for one moment do I bring I have
[1:17:14] have an objective that people would
[1:17:16] follow me or to make an organization he
[1:17:19] said but there's one objective that I
[1:17:22] have longed to see and that is a true
[1:17:25] relationship between God and man that's
[1:17:28] really following the message is when you
[1:17:32] follow it into the token life anything
[1:17:35] outside of the token life you're not
[1:17:37] really following it
[1:17:38] you've only followed it to a certain
[1:17:41] spot but you've got to go all the way
[1:17:44] redemption is two parts coming out and
[1:17:47] going into
[1:17:57] there's many of you that are much older
[1:17:59] than me
[1:18:01] I say that with joy but I stand like
[1:18:05] this you've seen a lot more things just
[1:18:08] as I've seen things people come and go
[1:18:09] I've even seen people younger than
[1:18:11] myself come and go and you would see
[1:18:14] people sometimes then they'd come in and
[1:18:16] their view of the message as though that
[1:18:19] the message is a challenge to the
[1:18:21] government they view the message as
[1:18:25] though it gives them a right to live
[1:18:27] stubbornly and obstinately and all those
[1:18:30] things and they miss the heart the
[1:18:32] kernel of what it's all about
[1:18:34] they they take it and they become
[1:18:37] debaters hussars strife and envy and
[1:18:40] they're always posting things they're
[1:18:42] not posting to edify somebody else
[1:18:44] they're posting to tear somebody else
[1:18:47] down come on now it might seem like man
[1:18:51] they feed on the message but they're not
[1:18:53] feeding on it when you feed on it you
[1:18:56] become one with the life that's in it
[1:18:59] that's heaven the right objective you
[1:19:02] can listen to it every day of your life
[1:19:04] but you've got to have the right
[1:19:06] objective and when you really feed on it
[1:19:09] brother
[1:19:10] it is the Spirit of Jesus Christ coming
[1:19:13] in you and molding and shaping your
[1:19:16] character to one objective one ambition
[1:19:19] one goal and that's Jesus Christ and him
[1:19:23] crucified and glorified in his people
[1:19:38] a person could have been the 1960s
[1:19:41] hippie and they get ahold of the message
[1:19:44] and they never get delivered they bring
[1:19:48] that same motive and objective right
[1:19:50] here under the message and they handle
[1:19:54] the mess with um uh preachers as well
[1:19:56] they handle it
[1:19:58] but they're not handling it in truth it
[1:20:06] doesn't edify Jesus Christ in the people
[1:20:09] whether this word is to edify Jesus
[1:20:12] Christ this word brings sons and
[1:20:17] daughters of God to abduction I'm not
[1:20:21] preaching something I read about how
[1:20:23] preaching something that I am and I have
[1:20:26] become I know what I'm talking about
[1:20:32] and Paul was designing this the content
[1:20:37] was not all again was not wrong it was
[1:20:40] the motive and objective behind it this
[1:20:48] is what Paul is dealing with this is why
[1:20:52] we must have the discernment of the Holy
[1:20:56] Spirit this is why the scripture says
[1:20:59] the many sick and weakly among you not
[1:21:03] discerning the Lord's body how do we
[1:21:06] discern the Lord's body
[1:21:07] what is the Lord's body it's not people
[1:21:10] it's the Spirit of Christ in tabernacled
[1:21:13] in the hearts of his people that's the
[1:21:18] Lord's body is that right I'm Jesus why
[1:21:21] persecute us down me it was his body
[1:21:25] that's his church his church is not
[1:21:27] brick and mortar his church is his body
[1:21:29] be baptized into the body of Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ and in his church he's got arms
[1:21:36] singers ears eyes he's got back in his
[1:21:40] intelligence he's got feet he's got legs
[1:21:42] he's got toes he's got fingernails come
[1:21:45] on now he's got a little hairs on the
[1:21:47] big toe
[1:21:48] he's got little hairs on the little toe
[1:21:49] he got all
[1:21:50] that's it it's all part of the body no
[1:21:54] matter where you are even if you are the
[1:21:56] skin on the bottom of the feet every
[1:21:59] devil is under your feet
[1:22:01] you've been lifted in the heavenly
[1:22:04] places is that right
[1:22:09] so when we look at this and as we
[1:22:15] evaluate that part Paul said I have
[1:22:19] known a man whose leg mended that'll
[1:22:21] naturally care for your estate this is
[1:22:25] why we must this is why him brother
[1:22:28] Branham he brings that message
[1:22:30] discernment of spirit powerful message
[1:22:34] powerful message I don't know how many
[1:22:37] times you know I use with any other
[1:22:38] message and listen to that message
[1:22:39] sometimes I take a message of the can
[1:22:41] just keep on listening to her listening
[1:22:42] to it listen to it listen to a listener
[1:22:44] and list who mister
[1:22:46] but the thing he comes down to his is
[1:22:48] discerning he said don't judge the man's
[1:22:51] ideas he said he might have our ideas
[1:22:53] compared to you but what you discern is
[1:22:56] what are they trying to achieve for the
[1:23:00] kingdom of God are they trying to
[1:23:03] achieve something for the kingdom of God
[1:23:05] or are they trying to build something
[1:23:07] for themselves this is where it takes
[1:23:11] the discernment of the Spirit of God
[1:23:14] because in case you haven't noticed it
[1:23:16] we look different we act different we
[1:23:18] think different but there has to be
[1:23:21] something that is common to where we
[1:23:24] give our lives to and that is the Holy
[1:23:26] Ghost huh let me just do we just close
[1:23:33] here this is where Paul said let me just
[1:23:36] these two verses scripture and then
[1:23:37] we'll just close for all seek not for
[1:23:40] all seek Pharaoh verse 21 not the things
[1:23:44] which are Jesus Christ
[1:23:46] what's he dealing with the motive and
[1:23:48] objective
[1:23:50] see we're not serving God because of
[1:23:52] what he can do for us well if I serve
[1:23:55] God this is the same spirit that brought
[1:23:58] in the organization and caused the fall
[1:24:00] in Nicaea the same spirit what can be
[1:24:04] popular they started taking people into
[1:24:07] the church because they're a governor
[1:24:09] because there's this and Constantine
[1:24:11] says well you know if I tell you what
[1:24:13] will protect you we'll do this if we of
[1:24:16] you only you know just merge with us
[1:24:18] they compromised not to true I said not
[1:24:22] to true the true remained true and the
[1:24:27] true went in the ground roll away just
[1:24:33] like the Lord Jesus himself remember
[1:24:36] here the groom had to go in the ground
[1:24:39] but remember the life the life that was
[1:24:42] projected in that body it came in and
[1:24:45] went down into hell notice here he comes
[1:24:48] going down into hell in the thinest
[1:24:50] theophany and he walks down there and he
[1:24:52] preached he preaches down there and he
[1:24:55] ascends back up brother
[1:24:57] and what does he do he raises up that
[1:24:59] body amen in a glorified manner what was
[1:25:04] it now the Saint Jesus that had walked
[1:25:07] among them the same Jesus now here he
[1:25:10] was once again the same one before his
[1:25:13] death burial now raised again and the
[1:25:16] same way with the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:18] when they put her in the ground she went
[1:25:22] in the ground in the darkness of that
[1:25:24] fact our age in the darkness of
[1:25:27] denominationalism but she began to come
[1:25:30] back up why cuz you can't kill the life
[1:25:33] the life is in the roots of the tree
[1:25:39] that motive and objective is pulsating
[1:25:45] and that same motive and objective is
[1:25:49] pulsating in the heart of the believer
[1:25:53] tonight
[1:25:58] for all seek their own and not the
[1:26:03] things which are Jesus Christ but you
[1:26:08] know proof of him he says that as a son
[1:26:11] with the father he has served me served
[1:26:17] with me in the gospel what a compliment
[1:26:28] my heart is so drawn just just it's
[1:26:33] skipping over these things just this
[1:26:37] preached what God is just so inspired to
[1:26:39] my heart what I was drawing to some time
[1:26:45] ago as I'm reading this and this I am
[1:26:48] closing because all this is going on all
[1:26:54] this is taking place people are
[1:26:56] preaching some in truth some in pretense
[1:27:00] some out of envious strength others out
[1:27:03] of love
[1:27:04] now once you'd apply this this gets
[1:27:07] applied down in our lives because
[1:27:09] remember you may not have the gift to
[1:27:12] preach in your life but your life
[1:27:15] preaches every day so what kind of a
[1:27:20] message are you preaching that's what
[1:27:25] you have to look at what kind of trail
[1:27:28] are you leaving behind you what kind of
[1:27:31] message are the messages that your life
[1:27:33] is preaching is it leading people to the
[1:27:36] real truth
[1:27:38] of Jesus Christ or is it leading them to
[1:27:42] your idea or is it leading them to a
[1:27:46] church or is it leading them just to a
[1:27:50] place to where they come into agreeance
[1:27:55] with doctrine you understand what I'm
[1:27:58] saying is something it ought to be the
[1:28:01] objective in our heart
[1:28:04] listen the objective I don't care if you
[1:28:08] don't understand the difference between
[1:28:10] P and corn but you meet Jesus Christ he
[1:28:16] is the seals he is the feast he is he is
[1:28:20] it all and all of that that's what's
[1:28:28] important because you catch it that it's
[1:28:30] all together it's not fragmented pieces
[1:28:34] like a puzzle laying out pieces come
[1:28:38] together amen this message comes to
[1:28:43] bring a clearer picture and they just
[1:28:47] stop here notwithstanding he said in
[1:28:53] every way Christ is preached and I i
[1:28:57] rejoice and yea I will rejoice
[1:29:03] look how Paul handled that Paul handled
[1:29:07] it yet in other places in in the book of
[1:29:10] Tim of Philippians we did not read
[1:29:12] tonight in other places where Paul will
[1:29:14] call him out you'd they're deceitful
[1:29:16] workers they serve their own belly but
[1:29:20] notice not how it balanced his
[1:29:23] confidence
[1:29:25] this is taking place but it's confidence
[1:29:27] and he's working with the prisoners of
[1:29:31] Jesus Christ that they stay focused on
[1:29:35] the right objective and that's what I
[1:29:39] say from my heart tonight let us have
[1:29:41] the right objective the right motive in
[1:29:46] all that we do all that are listening
[1:29:49] all that is streaming those that will
[1:29:51] stream the service let it be to where we
[1:29:54] are founded in the place they are
[1:29:57] preaching out of love they are living
[1:30:00] out of love they are walking in truth
[1:30:04] they are preaching in truth I say god
[1:30:10] help me
[1:30:10] god help us amen all glory we have this
[1:30:16] confidence in the Lord as Paul said if
[1:30:19] there be any otherwise minded it shall
[1:30:21] be revealed don't you want the Lord to
[1:30:24] search your heart God I want you to
[1:30:26] search search my heart every day that's
[1:30:29] what I asked him to do Lord search my
[1:30:30] heart search my heart
[1:30:35] Lord Jesus how father Lord you are so so
[1:30:45] mindful Lord your eyes what you see
[1:30:52] what's really the true value goes beyond
[1:30:57] Lord God sometimes what our eyes can see
[1:31:02] sometimes our eyes can see something on
[1:31:04] the outside the form itself looks to be
[1:31:09] absolutely perfect
[1:31:11] and lined up that yet really on the
[1:31:16] inside it's not really lined up that's
[1:31:21] where it's got to be lined up life
[1:31:22] that's in it or Jesus help us Lord God
[1:31:34] to be open to you
[1:31:37] that you would so search our hearts Lord
[1:31:40] I don't want to be found I would want to
[1:31:44] be found in that place none of us as
[1:31:46] your children want to be found their
[1:31:47] Lord in pretense
[1:31:50] not even for a moment
[1:31:55] Lord yet all of us that are listening
[1:32:01] and gathered around the word tonight we
[1:32:05] cannot say that every time we've always
[1:32:06] had the right motive and objective we
[1:32:10] can't say that the Lord God what we can
[1:32:14] say is our heart's desire is to please
[1:32:18] you the Lord when you've come and you've
[1:32:23] corrected us thank you for that Boyd
[1:32:29] Lord our desire even though we're so
[1:32:33] thankful for your grace we are confident
[1:32:36] and to know that you correct us but our
[1:32:39] desire is lord help us to be sensitive
[1:32:42] help us not to be impatient or hasty
[1:32:47] Lord those things that we find to be the
[1:32:50] will of God may we then allow the Spirit
[1:32:53] of God to test our motives is it
[1:32:59] something selfish or Lord is it is it
[1:33:04] something that's really for the kingdom
[1:33:07] of God's sake Lord we know sometimes
[1:33:12] there's things that we can we can do or
[1:33:16] we can have and yet it comes down to
[1:33:19] Lord in our lives as believers we we
[1:33:23] don't want anything we get to it we get
[1:33:25] to that place we realize and we start
[1:33:27] evaluating things not in terms of is it
[1:33:30] sin or not but we evaluated in terms of
[1:33:33] how will this affect my walk
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:39] I pray that God you would help each and
[1:33:41] every one of us or those that would call
[1:33:45] this their home even for those Lord that
[1:33:47] be streaming or archived and maybe from
[1:33:48] another assembly or other churches I
[1:33:51] pray that God may each and every one so
[1:33:53] take account in their life if they can
[1:33:56] see in their life Lord that there's not
[1:34:00] been any growth may they not allow Lord
[1:34:03] the enemy to discourage you but may they
[1:34:05] heed to the call the beckoning call of
[1:34:07] the Spirit of God and to let them know
[1:34:08] that that's your love it's calling
[1:34:12] desiring that they would move closer
[1:34:14] because you said drawn on to me and I'll
[1:34:17] draw mine to you Lord if right there in
[1:34:19] their hearts they can say lord I need to
[1:34:23] go deeper and I want to I want to Lord I
[1:34:27] want to line up with your word lord I
[1:34:30] pray I know that your spirit you're
[1:34:33] drawn to a heart like that but I still
[1:34:37] ask Lord that you would move right in
[1:34:40] where that heart is that Lord God
[1:34:43] strengthen them Lord to keep walking on
[1:34:46] Lord I pray
[1:34:48] may that be the objective Lord even as
[1:34:51] we are walking in this life Lord God
[1:34:54] whenever the time would be we don't even
[1:34:57] have to wait til the time to when these
[1:34:59] doors would be back open where we can
[1:35:00] meet back in there together Lord like we
[1:35:03] have in times past should that Lord be
[1:35:05] able to happen but we want to live every
[1:35:09] day our objective is to please you
[1:35:13] when we walk into these doors and we sit
[1:35:16] down
[1:35:18] maybe Lord got an appreciation or done
[1:35:23] like we've never had before
[1:35:26] what a score God may there be revival
[1:35:31] that would break out in hearts Lord God
[1:35:34] hearts Lord God that may be Lord were
[1:35:37] their objective and their motive has
[1:35:40] been so wrong what God may maybe they
[1:35:43] didn't mean to be wrong but Norden just
[1:35:45] got something sidetracked but I pray God
[1:35:48] in your mercy Lord I ask Lord God that
[1:35:52] you would let them to know tonight Lord
[1:35:55] that the real objective is you want to
[1:35:59] be so real to them you want to be their
[1:36:01] buddy I just read Lord the other day
[1:36:04] where your prophet said you slip down
[1:36:06] out of eternity you took upon a body of
[1:36:09] flesh that you might come down here and
[1:36:12] you might pay the price and then send
[1:36:14] back the holy droves because you wanted
[1:36:17] to live buddies with us all love God a
[1:36:20] friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:36:22] brother you tell us the truth

[1:36:45] of Jesus Christ he said Lord may you
