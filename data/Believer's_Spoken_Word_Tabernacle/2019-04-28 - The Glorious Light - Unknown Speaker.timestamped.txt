[45:23] amen
[45:25] we want to hear we want to go right into
[45:27] the word and as you're standing I just
[45:29] want to remind you there was an email
[45:31] sent out at the beginning of the week
[45:33] just with some details and points of the
[45:36] upcoming meetings in Memorial Day and if
[45:40] you didn't get a chance to read that or
[45:42] for some reason you don't have that
[45:44] please see you can even see my sister
[45:47] Michelle she can get that printed off
[45:48] for you so that you would have that or
[45:51] someone else can can maybe print it off
[45:53] for you it just has just details on
[45:55] there that would be good as well as the
[45:58] menu for the the dinner is is out there
[46:02] and if you'd like to sign up
[46:05] that would be good to do that those
[46:09] things have already are placed out there
[46:11] so let's get into the word
[46:16] you're hungry this morning
[46:19] mark 16 verse 1 we're just going to read
[46:23] a few verses of Scripture
[46:30] and verse 1 of mark 16 I'm just gonna
[46:32] read just just two verses of Scripture
[46:40] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[46:44] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[46:47] and Salman had brought sweet spices that
[46:53] they might come and anoint him and very
[46:57] early in the morning the first day of
[47:00] the week they came unto the sepulchre at
[47:04] the rising of the Sun may God bless His
[47:09] Word and bless you as you're being
[47:10] seated I want to just if the Lord will
[47:16] help us here and we'll just see where we
[47:18] are able to get to but I want to speak
[47:22] on a thought here we were dealing with
[47:24] some things last week and some things
[47:29] when you leave away sometimes you know
[47:31] it's never sometimes as a minister you
[47:34] feel well you feel you've made a
[47:37] complete mess of everything and you
[47:39] think the Lord the inspiration that you
[47:40] gave I you know it's almost I'm sorry
[47:44] you know and yet some of those times
[47:46] when it's been in that manner you know
[47:47] those are the times when you get the
[47:49] text and the emails and yeah God does
[47:51] that you know to let us know it's not us
[47:53] not that we ever think that it's us but
[47:56] sometimes there's things that when we're
[47:58] looking at we want the desire that that
[48:01] we have within it is there would be such
[48:03] a clarity of the word that is given and
[48:06] not just not just a letter but then you
[48:09] see when you understand your position
[48:12] and you understand what belongs to you
[48:14] and what you have then you know the
[48:17] rights that you have to request from God
[48:19] so we we don't want it just to be of
[48:22] where it is something that's just spoken
[48:25] but we want to be active upon the word
[48:28] when God has spoken we want to recognize
[48:31] that's God letting us know what belongs
[48:34] to us and sometimes it's things that is
[48:36] very good for things to be rehearsed and
[48:39] refreshed and I'll say it like this
[48:41] there are things as we go through the
[48:43] word you come into it and I just said
[48:46] you know just like in this hour there's
[48:48] things that I am seeing that I never saw
[48:50] before and yet I go back and look at
[48:52] some of my books
[48:53] looking notes and whatever more and in
[48:55] my Bible where I wrote notes and I said
[48:57] well sure I seen it but you know you've
[48:58] never seen it in the light that it's in
[49:00] and right now God does everything in a
[49:03] season and you know that's the thing
[49:04] that to me it just gives you such joy
[49:07] because the word itself the word when
[49:09] the life giver of the word Himself is
[49:12] present the word never becomes stagnant
[49:14] it's not a broken sister and it becomes
[49:17] a living fountain of water and then we
[49:20] recognize it is that fountain for us
[49:22] right now that's open in the house of
[49:24] David it's that which is bringing
[49:26] cleansing and healing and and and and
[49:29] and moving in our lives so we want to
[49:31] look at this here a little bit more this
[49:34] morning and I want to just kind of take
[49:36] take a little bit of time and going
[49:37] through some of these things on when
[49:39] when we look at these scriptures here in
[49:42] regards to this of the resurrection you
[49:44] know many people around this time of the
[49:46] year it is something that is no more
[49:49] than just a historical event but we as
[49:52] the people of God and I want you just to
[49:54] you know you might set here this morning
[49:56] and let me go ahead and and put this out
[49:57] here you might set here this morning and
[50:00] all of these parts and these different
[50:02] things you might walk out and say I just
[50:04] don't seem like I understand all the
[50:06] parts what is important that you would
[50:09] gather and recognize is who is in our
[50:11] midst
[50:12] who's speaking to your hearts and to
[50:14] recognize that he's not a historical God
[50:18] many can read this book fall in love
[50:22] with this book and yet still not
[50:24] recognize it to be a prophetic book the
[50:28] Pharisees and the Sadducees all of them
[50:31] remember they knew they knew they knew
[50:36] the law they knew the writings of the
[50:38] prophets they could finish quotes you
[50:43] understand now they knew this but all
[50:47] they knew is that of the latter they did
[50:51] not even when they were reading the word
[50:54] listen to me now they when they were
[50:55] reading the word and poring over it it
[50:58] was not something that where it was in a
[51:00] manner of saying Lord what I've read I
[51:02] seem to understand but Lord will you
[51:05] give
[51:05] the understanding that is trap that is
[51:07] hidden within here
[51:08] sealed within it you see if it would
[51:10] have just proach tit with humility its
[51:13] in faith because see faith remember the
[51:15] Bible says that the righteousness of God
[51:17] is revealed from faith unto faith and
[51:21] the Scriptures tell us that when he came
[51:25] they themselves did not obtain the
[51:28] righteousness of God this righteousness
[51:31] of God had nothing to do with all the
[51:35] ceremonialism that they could put on on
[51:38] the outside where brother Bram says you
[51:40] could not put a finger on their life I
[51:45] wonder if we were looking at them and
[51:48] this is what we think makes a fine
[51:50] church and we say well this is the I
[51:52] mean you can't put a finger here you
[51:54] can't put a finger here that's not what
[51:56] God's after he's after humble hearts the
[52:04] world and everything else might be able
[52:06] to put fingers but God's after humble
[52:09] hearts that are able to submit
[52:12] themselves think of the scripture that
[52:14] he said in that day he said father I
[52:18] think that thou has hid these things
[52:21] from the wise and prudent did you catch
[52:24] what he said there he didn't say from
[52:27] those who are ignorant from those who
[52:29] were dumb from those no it's from those
[52:32] who are wise and prudent even of lives
[52:36] that you could esteemed but yet he hid
[52:38] himself from all of that and here is the
[52:41] part brother branham will continue by
[52:43] the unction of the Spirit of God to put
[52:45] that forth but revealed it unto babes
[52:49] such as would learn we want to grow in
[52:53] the grace of God but we never want to
[52:56] grow beyond simplicity
[53:01] never the word itself the revelation
[53:05] when revelation breaks forth on our
[53:08] lives it is something that makes you and
[53:10] I aware of it is not me it's not my
[53:16] efforts it's not my doings not it isn't
[53:20] that we don't give ourselves to prayer
[53:21] it isn't that we don't give ourselves to
[53:23] the Lord but we recognize it's simply
[53:26] God himself as he would move and we give
[53:30] ourselves to him it's it's just like you
[53:34] know when a song is being played you
[53:36] have got to be able to give yourself to
[53:38] enter it you may not understand the
[53:40] words you may when a new song is
[53:42] introduced you may not even understand
[53:44] the flow of the melody but you give
[53:46] yourself to try to learn it and as
[53:49] you're learning it some of the things
[53:50] are off some of the things are on your
[53:52] Paul's to the next bar the next phrase
[53:54] the next you know and but yet within it
[53:56] what it is you're giving yourself that's
[53:58] what the Holy Spirit comes to do is that
[54:02] he would draw us that we would give
[54:05] ourselves not withhold ourselves because
[54:09] down through the ages he has put
[54:11] churches away in divorce
[54:15] good people put him away in divorce
[54:17] because they failed to receive further
[54:21] multiplication of the word of life
[54:25] that's why it's very important in this
[54:28] hour that we there is that life that is
[54:31] pulsating and moving within us so when
[54:34] we look at this as we come back into
[54:37] this the scripture that's laying here we
[54:39] has believers and I would say not just
[54:42] now in this hour but every hour when
[54:45] that Easter time would approach there
[54:47] was something about the believers that
[54:49] was special in the hour that they were
[54:52] living because you see Easter to a
[54:55] believer is not just a memorial it is a
[55:01] living reality every day of our life
[55:07] it's not just a new outfit we wear on
[55:11] Easter but we
[55:13] have been changed and a new garment we
[55:17] have adorned by the baptism of the Holy
[55:20] Ghost that's what Easter is really about
[55:23] and Satan's mockery is a new hat and a
[55:26] new this but you see who has as that of
[55:29] the wife of Almighty God we are adorned
[55:33] by being in subjection to the word
[55:36] hallelujah he is our bonnet of power
[55:40] hallelujah amen as the Bible said that
[55:43] the women it says in the scripture ought
[55:46] to have long hair is that right the
[55:49] nature itself teaches us these things
[55:51] Paul laid this out in the word but what
[55:54] does it say she ought to have power on
[55:56] her head because of the angels what
[56:00] angels are we talking about the
[56:01] messengers to the Church of the Living
[56:04] God
[56:04] you see God provides the clothing and
[56:08] attire that's needed for us as the ester
[56:12] in this hour to walk in before him he
[56:15] provides it by his own life by his own
[56:18] substance so it's not something we put
[56:21] on on Easter morning and come to church
[56:24] but it is a life you see this is why I
[56:27] think brother random said they talked
[56:29] about putting a new coat on the man
[56:30] Levin said you don't need a new coat on
[56:32] the man you need to put a new man in the
[56:35] coat and that's what God does he takes
[56:38] and he puts a new man on the inside of
[56:42] the same old temple glory be to God
[56:46] somebody can say I remember this and I
[56:49] remember that you got the wrong address
[56:51] there used to be somebody lived here
[56:54] that sounds like what you're talking
[56:56] about but I want to let you know he
[56:58] don't live here no more
[57:03] and not only that new owner has arrived
[57:08] [Music]
[57:10] glory be to God whoo hallelujah it's a
[57:22] living reality of what the resurrection
[57:27] means to us especially on the sin
[57:34] especially in the hour that you and I
[57:38] are living in of what was there
[57:42] fulfilled in the life of the Lord Jesus
[57:46] here's a came in the Ministry of the son
[57:49] of man and then as he gave his life he
[57:54] gave his life because there had to be a
[57:56] price that was paid right if something's
[58:00] in the pawnshop and you let your phone
[58:02] go back you can't just walk into the
[58:04] pawnshop and say give me my phone back
[58:06] they are going to ask you and say what
[58:08] do you have the money for this you can't
[58:11] just walk in and take it there's got to
[58:14] be the price rendered to purchase what
[58:18] is in that pawnshop and when that price
[58:21] is rendered then you have authority to
[58:25] say release it let it go it belongs to
[58:30] me
[58:30] release it what because the price has
[58:33] been paid and that's what you and I have
[58:39] the right this morning as sons and
[58:42] daughters of God we're not waiting on a
[58:44] price to be paid we're not waiting on
[58:48] another promise we're not waiting on
[58:50] something else we recognize here that
[58:53] the living Lord Jesus makes you and I
[58:56] wear that every redemptive blessing
[58:59] belongs to you as the sons and daughters
[59:03] of God
[59:05] hallelujah that's what this resurrection
[59:08] means for you and I it is something that
[59:15] is wrote there that I think of where
[59:18] that people down through here covering
[59:22] the time of even last week and
[59:24] everything that has taken place and it
[59:26] was little more than just an Easter
[59:28] Sunday
[59:30] y'all got rich with me it was no more
[59:33] than just an Easter Sunday but you see
[59:36] it's something that is beyond that that
[59:39] we recognize not only did he get up but
[59:42] you see this is where the question has
[59:45] to be asked and answered
[59:47] what does that have to do with me why
[59:54] did he get up why did he die and then
[59:58] why did he get up what does that have to
[1:00:01] do with me
[1:00:04] you see that same life that brought the
[1:00:09] Lord Jesus out of the grave that raised
[1:00:11] him up triumphantly he stood there
[1:00:15] triumphant over grass over the grave
[1:00:18] death and hail
[1:00:21] he stood triumphant you realize men had
[1:00:25] went to the grave and the grave had held
[1:00:28] him there had been men that were waiting
[1:00:32] in paradise there had been those who
[1:00:35] were there in Hell come on cuz hell is
[1:00:37] just a holding place come on there's no
[1:00:39] such thing as an eternal hell right God
[1:00:43] he must give you a fair trial before
[1:00:45] sending them to the lake of fire hell is
[1:00:47] no more than just like the local jail
[1:00:49] and when I say no more it's a lot worse
[1:00:52] but you understand it's worse even than
[1:00:56] the one that they talk about in the
[1:00:57] other County some of y'all get that
[1:01:01] don't you
[1:01:02] it's all over our local or local
[1:01:05] headlines and stuff but I'm Johnny it's
[1:01:08] a holding place it's a place that you
[1:01:10] don't want to go to it was a place that
[1:01:12] the Prophet when he was there in Hale he
[1:01:14] saw women
[1:01:15] with paint on their face you know what
[1:01:18] pain is assemble up there hiding
[1:01:19] something
[1:01:21] come on somebody you ever seen them when
[1:01:24] their face is washed
[1:01:26] come on now I work for somebody one time
[1:01:29] I've been even recognize them when they
[1:01:30] came in they had all that eyeliner and
[1:01:32] everything else washed off their face
[1:01:34] and I stood there and looked at you no I
[1:01:35] don't wanna be standing nobody so I turn
[1:01:37] around that cat is that her but aren't
[1:01:45] you glad listen now I'm not gonna dwell
[1:01:47] on this this morning but aren't you glad
[1:01:49] you see God don't want you to put
[1:01:51] nothing on I hope you understand what
[1:01:54] I'm talking about it's even much deeper
[1:01:56] than paint God don't want you to put on
[1:01:58] religion religion is a covering he
[1:02:03] rejected in Eden when they made
[1:02:07] themselves skins and got rejected
[1:02:12] that's called religion God does not
[1:02:16] desire that he said I will be your
[1:02:20] covering when Ruth was laying in
[1:02:25] humility at his feet he said take my
[1:02:28] covering and put it on you hallelujah
[1:02:33] you're cold cover up with my covering he
[1:02:37] takes away coldness lukewarmness
[1:02:40] indifference you see the power of the
[1:02:43] covering of the life of this bad it
[1:02:46] removes all of those things we are
[1:02:50] warmed in the presence of the Living God
[1:02:56] hallelujah he rolls on that Easter
[1:02:59] morning and you see he arose and I
[1:03:04] wanted to say like this he arose in
[1:03:06] resurrection power it was power they
[1:03:11] didn't go down there and dig up the
[1:03:13] graves are you with me nobody had to go
[1:03:16] down there
[1:03:17] he didn't need help rolling away the
[1:03:18] stone
[1:03:21] you know what it shows no matter how bad
[1:03:24] that and how much the Satan would think
[1:03:27] he has a life him then hedged in and
[1:03:30] sealed up
[1:03:31] but when Jesus comes by when
[1:03:35] resurrection power comes by brother
[1:03:38] bearing enough seals bearing enough town
[1:03:41] bearing enough unbelief bearing enough
[1:03:44] anything to keep him back from his word
[1:03:48] and you are his word he comes to fulfill
[1:03:56] his word and you are his word hallelujah
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:13] when he rose it brought forth the word
[1:04:17] that had been sown in their hearts the
[1:04:21] Bible says in 2nd Corinthians 13:4 for
[1:04:24] though he was crucified through weakness
[1:04:28] yet he liveth by the power of God you
[1:04:31] see this is the secret of the new birth
[1:04:33] you got to become weak you got to be
[1:04:36] willing to die to yourself well I try to
[1:04:41] be up no don't try to be nothing die for
[1:04:48] we also are weak oh my
[1:04:50] we are also weaken him but we shall live
[1:04:54] with him by the power of God towards you
[1:04:57] how are you living this morning by the
[1:04:59] power of God how am i living this
[1:05:01] morning by the power of God let's just
[1:05:04] be honest right now there are certain
[1:05:06] days you don't feel like putting one
[1:05:07] foot in front of the other but it's the
[1:05:09] power of God moving in your life I'm not
[1:05:13] talking about your feelings many days
[1:05:15] there's days that we can go by and we do
[1:05:18] not feel like Christians we don't feel
[1:05:20] like we got power but remember it's not
[1:05:23] a power that resides in this or in our
[1:05:26] spirit it is the power of God that
[1:05:29] resides in our whole
[1:05:31] so we don't have to try to do right we
[1:05:34] don't have to try to live right that is
[1:05:36] part of who we are that the power of God
[1:05:39] has released
[1:05:41] oh what a resurrection this is we are
[1:05:48] weak in him you see this is why it's
[1:05:52] good you get around one another and you
[1:05:54] fellowship the young people sometimes
[1:06:00] you know they get to see us there huh
[1:06:02] well they don't they you know they don't
[1:06:03] eat donuts with the Angels I'm in day
[1:06:09] you know bill Sam you don't get up and
[1:06:10] drink and you know coffee with the angel
[1:06:12] but the joy only comes they recognize
[1:06:14] the understand them say they recognize
[1:06:16] it's not us that's living hallelujah
[1:06:22] oh my verse 5 examine yourselves whether
[1:06:32] you be in the faith prove your own
[1:06:34] selves know you not your own selves how
[1:06:38] that Jesus Christ is in you except you
[1:06:43] be reprobates see it's not enough to
[1:06:45] believe on him you must be in him and
[1:06:49] the question would be how do I get in
[1:06:52] here there's one way there's one way and
[1:06:56] there ain't nobody no preacher can take
[1:06:59] you there but he himself is the only one
[1:07:04] that can bring you there because he is
[1:07:07] the shepherd he is the door of the
[1:07:10] sheepfold come on somebody
[1:07:13] he is the gate and he himself is the
[1:07:19] quicken ER that lifts you by His
[1:07:22] resurrection power
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:28] I appreciate good morality but I'm
[1:07:31] talking things deeper than just good
[1:07:33] clean living I'm talking about a power
[1:07:38] that raises you up that which puts in
[1:07:42] our hearts the simplicity and the
[1:07:44] humility and the faith to simply believe
[1:07:47] because he said so
[1:07:52] hallelujah glory be to God I'll tell you
[1:07:57] what I feel like another language here
[1:07:59] verse 10 of Romans 8 and if Christ be in
[1:08:04] you in you the body is dead because of
[1:08:10] sin you see the body becomes as dead
[1:08:13] it's like this code is I can take this
[1:08:15] coat I can throw it around this coat I
[1:08:19] can do with it what I will to do with it
[1:08:21] I can put it on and I can take it off
[1:08:28] right that's that's what the body
[1:08:31] becomes because this body was brought
[1:08:34] forth under that first nature it has all
[1:08:39] that stickiness and carnality and
[1:08:41] everything about it that's why there's
[1:08:43] got to come a greater power on the
[1:08:46] inside then you have power over this and
[1:08:51] the body becomes dead the body says hold
[1:08:57] this and the inner man says shut up come
[1:09:02] on somebody you know this is why the
[1:09:05] Bible says in Romans 6 let not sin
[1:09:09] therefore reign in your mortal bodies
[1:09:13] thoughts of doubt and unbelief
[1:09:16] and criticism and everything else cast
[1:09:18] that out that is not the Holy Ghost
[1:09:23] [Applause]
[1:09:25] if you dwell on and it'll wilt power
[1:09:28] over your life it'll take you from the
[1:09:32] presence of God even while you're
[1:09:34] setting under the presence of God it
[1:09:37] will become a blockade in an isolation
[1:09:39] between you and the power of God but let
[1:09:42] me tell you something you've got to
[1:09:44] write this morning and there is one
[1:09:47] present to equip you as the son and
[1:09:50] daughter of God
[1:09:51] to discern that devil and cast him down
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:09:57] sometimes people dwell on things think
[1:10:00] on things talk on things that the hell
[1:10:02] got no business doing the Bible's clear
[1:10:06] you don't think on anything that ain't
[1:10:08] got virtue in it it don't have praise in
[1:10:10] it come on somebody you don't you cast
[1:10:14] it out but say no I believe in casting
[1:10:21] out Devils there you go cast him out
[1:10:23] come on somebody cast him out
[1:10:28] he comes to you and present something
[1:10:31] cast him out the bible says casting down
[1:10:34] imaginations and every high thing that
[1:10:39] exalteth itself against the Lord Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ every high thing sometimes
[1:10:46] there's high things that shows you
[1:10:48] certain points
[1:10:50] he took Jesus up to a high mountain come
[1:10:55] on he took him up to the pinnacle he
[1:10:57] took him up to height and he showed him
[1:10:58] the heights of this nation the heights
[1:11:00] of Germany the heights of this he showed
[1:11:02] him all the high points but he didn't
[1:11:03] show him Skid Row he didn't show him
[1:11:05] everything else of the debauchery that
[1:11:08] is brought from that he only showed him
[1:11:10] the heights Satan took all that and
[1:11:17] spliced it all together and presented
[1:11:19] this this will I give you let me tell
[1:11:22] you something anything that Satan gives
[1:11:24] you and it's a lure with your eyes it is
[1:11:27] full of death behind it he's a liar and
[1:11:33] everything he presents is a lie glory be
[1:11:41] to God
[1:11:44] wouldn't recognize that spirit and
[1:11:47] withstand it no it would be to God the
[1:11:55] body is dead because of sin but the
[1:11:58] Spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:12:00] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:12:05] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:12:11] here's the here's the hokey if the
[1:12:13] spirit that raised up Jesus guerrillas
[1:12:17] here was that body laying in the ground
[1:12:21] but it took the Spirit of God to come
[1:12:24] down and raise that body up don't let
[1:12:29] this stuff you the Spirit of God that
[1:12:31] was the Lord Jesus he had to come and
[1:12:35] raise up his own body you see this is
[1:12:41] where the mystery of God the baptism of
[1:12:43] the Holy Ghost it comes and makes real
[1:12:46] to you and I that it is an equipping of
[1:12:49] that life that he already sold in you
[1:12:52] and I in the beginning and when the
[1:12:54] quickening power is come upon that word
[1:12:57] that has been so there it raises in
[1:13:00] power and then you have authority by
[1:13:03] resurrection power over your body your
[1:13:08] body can say I don't feel like it I
[1:13:10] don't this and I don't that and
[1:13:12] sometimes we succumb to it
[1:13:13] it's amen sometimes things we talk about
[1:13:17] and say about and shadow Grizzles doing
[1:13:19] it
[1:13:19] hello this forgive me Lord but you see
[1:13:24] quickening power resurrection power will
[1:13:27] not allow you to stay or remain in that
[1:13:30] state why because you have true light
[1:13:34] shining in you
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:38] and you can't stay in that condition
[1:13:43] even when gloom and darkness tries to
[1:13:46] swirl around but there's light in Goshen
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:52] hallelujah
[1:13:53] there's right on the inside there's
[1:13:56] light that says I will make it I will
[1:14:01] get through this glory be to God but at
[1:14:10] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:14:13] from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:14:15] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:14:18] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:14:22] Spirit that dwelleth in you glory be to
[1:14:27] God it brings in subjection now I want
[1:14:31] to look here in the scripture here just
[1:14:33] a moment in Leviticus 23 verse 19 your
[1:14:42] God is letting the people know when you
[1:14:46] come into the land this is what I want
[1:14:48] you to do
[1:14:50] in verse nine the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:14:53] saying speak unto the Lord spoke unto
[1:14:58] Moses saying speak unto the children of
[1:15:00] Israel and sand to them when ye be come
[1:15:05] into the land
[1:15:08] which I give unto you we could preach on
[1:15:13] that this land belongs to you you have
[1:15:21] to have faith that it belongs to you
[1:15:26] he said I've already given it to you for
[1:15:31] there's Devils we gotta fight on this
[1:15:33] land but you by faith can say get off my
[1:15:37] land
[1:15:39] get off my land and you're not gonna go
[1:15:43] I've got brothers and sisters with me
[1:15:47] you might be thousands but we're coming
[1:15:50] for your head come on somebody
[1:15:54] we're coming we're coming after what
[1:15:57] belongs to us glory be to God this is
[1:16:03] where brother Brent says once you get
[1:16:05] into the land your prayer life changes
[1:16:10] you see how does it change you're no
[1:16:12] longer praying as though you're the tail
[1:16:15] you pray and recognize and the head not
[1:16:20] pray for me I'll be able to hang on pray
[1:16:22] for me no you pray in a man and say this
[1:16:24] is my promise this belongs to me as a
[1:16:27] believer you say in that being a little
[1:16:30] boat he wants you to call him on the
[1:16:33] scene that he will come and then the
[1:16:36] capias word to you in you and through
[1:16:39] you when you be coming to the land that
[1:16:43] I give you they hadn't even set a foot
[1:16:48] on it but God said it's yours
[1:16:52] hallelujah and let me tell you something
[1:16:57] there is a report and it's a good report
[1:17:04] Amen a report that has been brought by
[1:17:07] the Lord Himself hey man he was the life
[1:17:13] giver of that land hallelujah
[1:17:19] when you become into the land you see
[1:17:23] when the resurrection took place Jesus
[1:17:26] lived in a land when he was here he
[1:17:31] lived in the land of the Holy Ghost he
[1:17:35] walked in the world a perfect faith he
[1:17:37] was living in that land right I'm in the
[1:17:41] world but I'm not of the world
[1:17:44] he said the son of man here he is on
[1:17:46] earth yet he's in heaven
[1:17:48] he was walking in two worlds at one time
[1:17:52] he was walking in this land while living
[1:17:56] from that land when he came into that
[1:17:59] land how did he come into that land when
[1:18:02] he walked to the River Jordan as the
[1:18:04] sacrifice here came the Holy Ghost the
[1:18:08] pillar fire descending in the form of a
[1:18:10] dove and what did it do it took the word
[1:18:13] that was already there and made it fresh
[1:18:18] in quickened the promise to him and
[1:18:22] revealed who God was in that hour and
[1:18:27] when that revelation came in him it was
[1:18:30] reflected through him and God was
[1:18:34] letting it be known I will pour on my
[1:18:37] spirits my spirit and it will abide not
[1:18:43] just pouring out the spirit and it just
[1:18:46] fluttering away but the Holy Ghost the
[1:18:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost the true new
[1:18:51] birth is where the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:18:53] abide not just somebody who shows up to
[1:18:58] the house every once in a while but
[1:19:01] somebody who says this is my house this
[1:19:07] is my house and Jesus was living in that
[1:19:11] land it was a good report who hath
[1:19:15] believed our report Isaiah 53 who hath
[1:19:19] believed our report and to whom is the
[1:19:22] arm of the Lord revealed God extending
[1:19:25] his life his promise he was living in
[1:19:30] that land and walking in this land who
[1:19:36] no repeat of God whooo I just mean many
[1:19:43] need to have a praise break here myself
[1:19:44] [Laughter]
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:51] glory glory when you come into the land
[1:19:57] you see coming into that land now you
[1:20:01] see he was announcing to them by the
[1:20:05] coming of the Messiah his life listen to
[1:20:08] me now his life was an announcement that
[1:20:11] life is here and life is going to come
[1:20:14] to you right my life remember as he
[1:20:20] continued to pour out and he spoke
[1:20:22] himself over and over because I live you
[1:20:25] live also right the works that I do
[1:20:29] shall you do also greater than this
[1:20:32] because I go to my father right he
[1:20:35] continually pointed and he said I'm come
[1:20:37] that you might have life
[1:20:39] it wasn't Matthew that they weren't
[1:20:41] already breathing they were walking
[1:20:43] around eating but that ain't life that's
[1:20:47] just one form of life walking around and
[1:20:50] eating and sleeping and working but he
[1:20:51] said I come that you might have life and
[1:20:54] might have been more abundantly you see
[1:20:58] he just did not want to himself come and
[1:21:01] be a blessing he did not just want to
[1:21:07] come and be a blessing but he came to
[1:21:10] share the blessing that blessing of
[1:21:13] Abraham the pouring out of the Holy
[1:21:17] Ghost on the royal seed of Abraham
[1:21:22] hallelujah he came to pour that blessing
[1:21:27] out when you come into the land you see
[1:21:31] he had to bring him into the land when
[1:21:34] the resurrection took place hoggle
[1:21:36] fishing things ain't happen the way I
[1:21:38] thought it was gonna happen and things
[1:21:40] aren't going the way it should go and I
[1:21:41] don't think and you know what they begin
[1:21:43] to go about their own way why they were
[1:21:47] sheep just like you and I we fail the
[1:21:52] moment we try to depend on ourselves
[1:21:56] we're brother saying I know the Word of
[1:21:58] God I know the message you can still
[1:22:00] fail a sheep is to be led and we're led
[1:22:04] by the unction of the Holy Ghost come on
[1:22:09] church
[1:22:10] we're not led by letters I don't see
[1:22:14] this what the Spirit of God is leading
[1:22:16] you to do it ought to be demonstrated it
[1:22:19] ought to be this word being vindicated
[1:22:21] in your life and if you're telling me
[1:22:23] you're led to do something that's not
[1:22:25] vindicated here I'm telling you it's a
[1:22:27] devil it's a lying spirit but we want to
[1:22:31] raise its head against the word God
[1:22:34] ain't interested in our feelings our
[1:22:36] opinions our thought he's only come to
[1:22:39] vindicate his words when you come into
[1:22:47] this land he had to bring them to this
[1:22:51] land did he do it sure he did he began
[1:22:56] to appear and make himself known to him
[1:22:59] there right like some of that we've been
[1:23:02] through last week but then as he began
[1:23:04] to he gathered him together and when he
[1:23:06] got him together the Bible says he
[1:23:09] believed on him and he said receive ye
[1:23:15] the Holy Ghost you know what he was
[1:23:19] letting them know that you were going to
[1:23:21] be born of the breath of God and what is
[1:23:25] the breath of God that's the divine
[1:23:27] inspiration that would move their that
[1:23:29] same Holy Ghost that moved upon the
[1:23:31] prophets and now the Bible says that
[1:23:33] they were moved by by the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:35] that right they did not speak what they
[1:23:37] wanted to speak they were so caught up
[1:23:39] and lived in that word till they spoke
[1:23:42] in line with that word Oh glory be to
[1:23:45] God when all persecution of Salem yet
[1:23:48] they had food and do Caesar
[1:23:49] they were strengthened they were
[1:23:51] nourished they had joy they had what
[1:23:53] they had need of to endure and reflect
[1:23:56] Christ in that time
[1:23:59] and he came and he made known the land
[1:24:02] to him how is he going to come amen he
[1:24:11] had to get him standing on their feet
[1:24:14] they had that flesh put on and dry bones
[1:24:19] had to be come to come together come on
[1:24:22] somebody and flesh begin to come on
[1:24:24] sinew all of those things coming in
[1:24:27] order let me tell you something your
[1:24:28] life in my life was out of order but I
[1:24:31] don't care how hard you try or how hard

[1:24:51] put you together mom and daddy can't put
[1:24:53] you together but the Holy Ghost is able
[1:24:56] to put you together and put you back in
[1:24:59] the place in Christ in its taking where

[1:25:21] name of Jesus Christ if you don't have

[1:26:24] though this is one birthday
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:31] this is one birthday it brings us back
[1:26:35] to the original very no blowing out this
[1:26:38] light it's not a man-made light but it
[1:26:42] is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself that
[1:26:45] same pillar fire that comes down and he
[1:26:48] lives the children of God with his
[1:26:51] presence with this person
[1:26:55] when you become into this land you see
[1:26:59] you've got to be brought in contact with
[1:27:01] this land can you imagine if you never
[1:27:05] came in contact with this land you
[1:27:08] wouldn't know anything about it but it's
[1:27:11] more than just hearing about it
[1:27:12] you got us know that this land is real
[1:27:16] it's not enough to know about this land
[1:27:20] it's like I told a person I said you
[1:27:23] know when brother Ella and then would
[1:27:25] come over here they told me brother Joey
[1:27:28] I've seen pictures on my dad with the
[1:27:30] Philippines i watch pictures and when
[1:27:31] brother Roel and sister Cindy over in
[1:27:34] the Philippines he showed me and you
[1:27:35] both he showed us their own pictures of
[1:27:37] being in the Philippines that's all I
[1:27:39] had was a picture but when I got off the
[1:27:43] plane that morning in October it wasn't
[1:27:46] a picture no more I had all of the
[1:27:49] smells all the sounds everything around
[1:27:53] me that was buzzing you know what I had
[1:27:56] experienced it in reality it was no
[1:28:00] longer a picture let me tell you
[1:28:04] something too pillar 5 and just to be a
[1:28:06] picture come on somebody the pillar fire
[1:28:11] is the living person of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:13] Christ it's representative of this
[1:28:16] person and of his presence and he comes
[1:28:19] to set lives on fire
[1:28:22] [Applause]
[1:28:26] he don't need to pour gasoline on you
[1:28:33] there's already gasoline that's trapped
[1:28:36] there in that seat and when the pillar
[1:28:40] fire comes upon it it manifests it's not
[1:28:44] water it's gas high-octane combustible
[1:28:48] gas and in this hour it's not horse and
[1:28:57] buggy power it's not automobile power
[1:29:00] it's not airplane power this is
[1:29:03] astronaut power that's why the life that
[1:29:09] we live now it reflects the power of the
[1:29:12] world that has been released to you and
[1:29:14] I thank God for what Luther has thank
[1:29:17] God for what Wesley had thank God for
[1:29:20] what pinnacle said but remember we have
[1:29:22] received power that is an overcoming
[1:29:26] power that it lives above all of the
[1:29:29] sand flesh world in the devil and brings
[1:29:33] us into alignment with God's desire for
[1:29:37] this hour when you become into the land
[1:29:42] Lord I don't know if I'm gonna get off
[1:29:44] this verse or not when you become into
[1:29:53] the land this is why we want our
[1:29:57] children brought where the lands apt we
[1:30:00] want our children we want our
[1:30:01] grandchildren we want our homes our
[1:30:03] families to be brought where that land
[1:30:06] is preached come on friends we don't
[1:30:11] want to stand there and say well I'll
[1:30:12] tell you what it out there ain't no way
[1:30:13] they can live it a very no way you can
[1:30:15] live it I don't care how long you been
[1:30:18] around I don't care how much you know if
[1:30:21] that's what you're resting on you better
[1:30:22] check up you better make sure that
[1:30:24] Christ is in you because it's not you
[1:30:26] that's living that's got to be a living
[1:30:32] reality but it's Christ in you
[1:30:34] not Christ in your pastor not Christ in
[1:30:37] the prophet not Christ in mom and dad er
[1:30:39] her brother and sister so and so but
[1:30:41] Christ in you when you become into this
[1:30:48] land now remember there were some folks
[1:30:51] that got brought up to this land they
[1:30:54] came up to it and they rejected it is
[1:30:58] that right the Bible says in the book of
[1:31:00] Corinthians he appeared to 500 120 went
[1:31:04] in hello somebody 120 went in is that
[1:31:08] right
[1:31:09] here he came over into this place right
[1:31:11] here they come up to the land and when
[1:31:14] they come up to the land there was those
[1:31:16] of 10 spies that said this is too much
[1:31:18] for us it's too big for us there ain't
[1:31:21] no way in the world we can take these
[1:31:22] giants but Joshua and Caleb were not
[1:31:24] looking at the Giants what they were
[1:31:28] looking at if the Lord be with us let me
[1:31:31] tell you something that's what's the
[1:31:33] most important thing is if God be for us
[1:31:36] who can be against us if the Lord be
[1:31:39] with us then they will be bread for us
[1:31:49] that's the most comforting words that he
[1:31:52] can give us I am with me I am with thee
[1:31:56] let me tell you something even when you
[1:31:59] didn't know he was with you he was with
[1:32:00] you the first time he talked to Gideon
[1:32:04] he said that mighty man of Valor the
[1:32:06] Lord is with thee if we can put it like
[1:32:10] this he wasn't even born again yet but
[1:32:13] you see it was the Lord that had been
[1:32:16] with him the Lord had watched over his
[1:32:19] life and the Lord is the one who had
[1:32:21] even stirred up that desire if God be
[1:32:24] for us where be all his miracles and a
[1:32:31] person can say in this hour well we
[1:32:33] don't need miracles we've got the word
[1:32:35] how in the world do you separate the two
[1:32:38] if you can separate the two then you've
[1:32:41] got a taint that we don't know if it's
[1:32:43] gas or what it is
[1:32:46] but I'll give you this statement here
[1:32:48] out of junction of time brother man said
[1:32:50] one Noah he said was himself preparing a
[1:32:54] miracle he was preparing for a miracle
[1:32:57] and he said you give me a church that is
[1:33:01] exercised to believe in miracles and the
[1:33:04] supernatural
[1:33:05] he said I'll show you a church that the
[1:33:07] rapture will not be a hard thing for
[1:33:09] because not only are we miracles we are
[1:33:13] preparing for a miracle
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:22] we don't need miracles you speak for
[1:33:25] yourself but when I see a miracle being
[1:33:28] done I see him it's something I need
[1:33:33] this to be vindicated it's just that I
[1:33:35] love him I'm gonna say me we don't need
[1:33:39] all those things anymore
[1:33:41] I'm afraid that's that same
[1:33:42] organizational spirit that put him out
[1:33:45] the revelation of this message it never
[1:33:48] went it's truly revealed it does not put
[1:33:50] out any of his gifts this message by the
[1:33:54] angel of the Lord it puts all those
[1:33:57] gifts in order and in its place and
[1:34:00] every gift when it's positionally place
[1:34:03] it declares him to be the same what were
[1:34:09] the ministerial gifts given for they
[1:34:12] were given in that procession as though
[1:34:14] an one who was a mighty Conqueror would
[1:34:17] scatter those gifts out what were the
[1:34:19] scattering of those gifts those gifts
[1:34:21] were the scattering because he had rose
[1:34:24] triumphant over death hell and the grave
[1:34:26] and I don't care what gift it is that it
[1:34:29] would be using that gift itself it must
[1:34:31] stand there and declare that Jesus
[1:34:34] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:34:37] forever it's not a gift that makes a
[1:34:40] pact with the devil
[1:34:43] come on somebody you need to stop
[1:34:46] sending ambassadors to try to make a
[1:34:48] peace plan you need to recognize that
[1:34:51] whole land belongs to you I'm givin the
[1:34:54] West Bank I ain't givin the east bank
[1:34:56] I want my boundaries hello you when you
[1:35:09] become into the land and shall reap the
[1:35:13] harvest thereof so I want you to catch
[1:35:15] this when you come into the land you
[1:35:19] shall reap the harvest thereof when they
[1:35:21] came over into the land there the Bible
[1:35:25] says when they got in the land in the
[1:35:27] Book of Joshua the manna ceased on the
[1:35:30] morrow and they ate of the old corn of
[1:35:35] the land what were they eating up if it
[1:35:39] was old corn that they were eating it
[1:35:41] showed that there had been corn that
[1:35:43] went in the ground it had come through
[1:35:47] the full maturity and now it was ready
[1:35:50] to be eaten it was ready for them when
[1:35:55] they got there when you become into the
[1:36:01] land and reap the harvest there up so as
[1:36:04] you're coming into the land here was the
[1:36:06] Lord Jesus receive ye the Holy Ghost he
[1:36:10] was announcing there it's time for you
[1:36:13] to come into the land that I have given
[1:36:15] to you no wonder they could return and
[1:36:17] go up there to the Upper Room of joy the
[1:36:21] Bible said they had joy before they got
[1:36:23] the Holy Ghost that's why when you see
[1:36:27] people without joy huh
[1:36:33] they went up there with joy before they
[1:36:36] ever got the holy ghost but you see when
[1:36:38] they come in the land you see what was
[1:36:40] it there had been a harvest his life the
[1:36:44] Son of Man his life that ministry had
[1:36:48] come to full fruition and now it was
[1:36:53] time to take that wave sheaf up I'm
[1:36:57] gonna borrow this this is a poor thing
[1:37:02] for a wave see but it'll do
[1:37:05] sorry sister Michelle you can fix this
[1:37:07] later but when they came into the land
[1:37:12] I'm talking my wheat now you're alright
[1:37:14] y'all with me come on now y'all can
[1:37:15] imagine this right you as me Braden you
[1:37:18] got to use your imagination man as a
[1:37:20] young young boy you got you with me we
[1:37:22] come into the land and when they came
[1:37:24] into the land when they got there this
[1:37:27] harvest was waiting on them when they
[1:37:32] got in the land you won the shoot it
[1:37:36] wasn't a tassel you with me it wasn't
[1:37:39] green it had come up and it wasn't it
[1:37:41] didn't just have seeds with him the
[1:37:43] shuck there and it was still green but
[1:37:45] when they came in the land it was golden
[1:37:50] golden what pillar deity power it was
[1:37:55] golden and when you become in the land
[1:37:58] and you reap the harvest they're up you
[1:38:00] see they knew what belonged to them and
[1:38:02] said this harvest belongs to me
[1:38:04] and when you take that harvest and it's
[1:38:07] waived as accepted unto the Lord
[1:38:11] you know what that meant it meant that
[1:38:14] the field that this came out of there's
[1:38:17] more in the field that are gonna look
[1:38:19] just like this and come to this same
[1:38:23] power this same image this same glory go
[1:38:30] Robina God in the highest
[1:38:31] and as this wave she you know what it
[1:38:35] was it was life think about this brother
[1:38:38] Drake think about it for a moment before
[1:38:39] this ever came up like this remember a
[1:38:42] wheat plant starts from a seat is that
[1:38:44] right it starts from a seed
[1:38:47] but then that seed grows to maturity and
[1:38:49] when it comes up it's a testimony of
[1:38:51] life that the same life the same
[1:38:53] maturity the rest of this field will
[1:38:56] actually be the same kind same power
[1:39:00] same image same glory but here it is the
[1:39:08] Ministry of the Son of Man Christ in his
[1:39:11] fullness right
[1:39:13] he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:39:15] bodily
[1:39:17] not just horse-and-buggy power not just
[1:39:21] car power not just airplane power
[1:39:24] astronaut power not just justification
[1:39:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:31] but the person of Christ himself be Son
[1:39:37] of Man V word Luther was a part of the
[1:39:43] word Wesley was a part of the word
[1:39:46] Pentecost was a part of the word when
[1:39:48] you get all the parts together when you
[1:39:51] get all the loose parts together when
[1:39:55] all the loose ends come together it is
[1:39:58] the word now standing in our midst
[1:40:03] who is the son of man and the son of man
[1:40:11] he was not waved over Caiaphas's he was
[1:40:17] not waived there upon the rest of him
[1:40:20] but brother branham makes it clear in
[1:40:22] the rising of the Sun he said he was
[1:40:25] waved to them so he comes and he waves
[1:40:33] himself over his children he waves his
[1:40:42] life over his children that's what this
[1:40:47] resurrection means for you and I as the
[1:40:52] son of man was waved over them on the
[1:40:55] day of Pentecost and it came out a pure
[1:40:59] undefiled bride in a bride age that was
[1:41:03] reflecting the ministry of the son of
[1:41:06] man and the devil tried to sniff that
[1:41:10] life for health but remember that life
[1:41:12] cannot be defeated hell already tried to
[1:41:19] conquer it Rome lost one time and Rome
[1:41:22] lost again positrons and power
[1:41:29] it rose in a little green suit where the
[1:41:32] just shall live by faith
[1:41:33] when that first angel went to preach the
[1:41:35] everlasting gospel it rose up you say
[1:41:38] there's only a little green thing let me
[1:41:39] tell you something don't you ever
[1:41:41] despise the day of small things in your
[1:41:43] life it might be a little shoot coming
[1:41:45] out in your life right now
[1:41:46] but don't despise the day of small
[1:41:49] things know that the same God that
[1:41:52] brings the shoot will bring it to full
[1:41:54] maturity and there's not enough Devils
[1:41:58] can stop it there's not enough demons
[1:42:01] that can stop it hallelujah because I
[1:42:05] live ye shall live also hallelujah he
[1:42:14] was waved over the people that same
[1:42:20] ministry in this hour has come and is
[1:42:24] waved back over the people remember God
[1:42:31] remembers we looked at it last week I
[1:42:32] just had this Moodle removed ahead
[1:42:34] remember as we looked at it last week
[1:42:36] that little ego who was in that barnyard
[1:42:38] he could not he could not respond to
[1:42:41] just let her preaching about an eagle
[1:42:43] you know why because even though it was
[1:42:47] just you know you're an eagle you're a
[1:42:48] neighbor just let her there wasn't no
[1:42:51] behind it Jesus everyone know behind it
[1:42:56] I know some people don't want that
[1:42:59] that's emotion you just misplace in
[1:43:02] quotes
[1:43:04] now we don't need intellectual Giants we
[1:43:07] need the power of God I said we need a
[1:43:11] resurrection power right here not only
[1:43:14] standing before you but sending these
[1:43:16] pews our lives that intellectualism
[1:43:18] could have never brought forth this
[1:43:20] reality it took the power of a
[1:43:23] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ to raise
[1:43:25] you out of darkness that you were in to
[1:43:28] raise you out of the trap of sin and
[1:43:30] unbelief and doubt and break the holds
[1:43:33] on your life
[1:43:33] it took Jesus Christ himself to be waved
[1:43:37] over your life and when he when he is
[1:43:46] waved over your life then you see a
[1:43:49] living image God had an eagle in this
[1:43:54] hour
[1:43:56] come on so body
[1:43:58] he had a promise in his word in the
[1:44:01] evening time there shall be light amen
[1:44:05] there was an eagle there were eyes upon
[1:44:08] the air that can catch the light that
[1:44:11] was shining
[1:44:13] they can catch that line that it was
[1:44:15] shining and what did it do it has LED
[1:44:17] light into the party what is it that has
[1:44:20] brought light into you your eyes have
[1:44:24] been anointed by the Holy Spirit and
[1:44:27] then life has come in you
[1:44:30] no longer I who live but Christ liveth
[1:44:34] in me reign over the people and like
[1:44:45] little Eagles we look up and say we're
[1:44:51] not seeing the mechanics we're seeing
[1:44:54] the dynamic power or you see brother
[1:44:58] Graham no no I'm seeing I'm seeing the
[1:45:00] eagle that that's right inside there now
[1:45:05] I'm not just saying run round I'm not an
[1:45:07] idolaters I'm not an image worshipper
[1:45:09] I'm an eagle
[1:45:11] you're not going to trap me in that cage
[1:45:15] I'm not going in that cage Artie came
[1:45:18] out of that hateful an unclean foul cage
[1:45:21] I am NOT going back into that cage
[1:45:24] we are not worshipers a man
[1:45:27] we are worshipers of the Living God
[1:45:32] hallelujah it is him that is called our
[1:45:38] attention when we see this message we're
[1:45:41] not seeing a man we recognize it's the
[1:45:44] son of man that is rose in power and the
[1:45:49] dynamics have come upon the mechanics
[1:45:55] and to remember the eyes your eyes are
[1:45:59] outside your body if they were you'd
[1:46:01] look funny but your eyes are in your
[1:46:04] body is that right and your eyes that
[1:46:06] are on your body they're part of your
[1:46:08] body right the eyes that God has had in
[1:46:10] this hour is in the body that's why it's
[1:46:16] the son of man manifested in the body of
[1:46:20] the bride that same life is manifested
[1:46:26] in bride form not just a shoot not just
[1:46:32] a tassel not just a shot but the
[1:46:35] fullness of the wave she the fullness of
[1:46:39] the life and the power and the glory has
[1:46:42] returned
[1:46:43] no wonder the glory of the ladder house
[1:46:48] is greater
[1:46:56] hallelujah let's stand our feet
[1:46:59] hell alone
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:06] hallelujah give him glory all your
[1:47:09] people by his plan has washed away every
[1:47:15] stream hallelujah
[1:47:21] girl repeated God glory be to God we
[1:47:41] know who we are we know what we've been
[1:47:43] raised before the same life of the son
[1:47:49] of man living his life again that's the
[1:47:55] real kernel of the message is the life
[1:48:01] I'm not interested in debating kernels I
[1:48:04] just take the life that's in it you can
[1:48:07] argue about the kernel but it's about
[1:48:09] the life when that quickening power has
[1:48:17] passed upon your life the world is dead
[1:48:23] brother Graham said when that quickening
[1:48:25] power he said you're walking along you
[1:48:27] said in something just it strikes and
[1:48:30] you recognize it's a word it strikes he
[1:48:33] said immediately no more shorts no more
[1:48:35] this no more that no more why there is a
[1:48:38] ceasing because the Sun has aroused
[1:48:42] it's a new
[1:48:44] a new day
[1:48:47] no wonder Moses said in Exodus 12 today
[1:48:51] shall be unto you as the beginning of
[1:48:54] months that's what the new birth is it's
[1:49:02] a new beginning without ending brother
[1:49:07] Chris but the joy without ending because
[1:49:12] you were always saved
[1:49:15] you are always eternal but you just now
[1:49:19] recognized it and the power that had you
[1:49:22] caged in held in but there was a greater
[1:49:25] one that come that said that my people
[1:49:29] go that's more than coming to church in
[1:49:45] that's more than a church life that's
[1:49:49] Resurrection Life Church life will leave
[1:49:52] you in the same dead condition but when
[1:49:54] that resurrection comes it ain't a good
[1:49:57] feeling
[1:49:57] it raises you a newness of life you want
[1:50:01] witness and observe that life working in
[1:50:03] you and you can you stand in all
[1:50:05] yourself at the transformation because
[1:50:09] you know what is you yield to it the
[1:50:10] power just keeps spreading remember it
[1:50:12] says when you become in the land and
[1:50:15] when you get in the land occupied take
[1:50:20] over that land go take all that belongs
[1:50:23] to you if it seems too high for you pray
[1:50:26] pray until you ascend to that place

[2:09:12] Betsy
[2:09:14] I don't know sister Betsy real well but
[2:09:16] I know a little bit about her I know
[2:09:18] that she came here as a small child and
[2:09:22] her mother was away for 20-some years
[2:09:25] and the Lord that a miracle brought her
[2:09:27] back and then all of a sudden the North
[2:09:32] Star Deena with sister Betsy and we're
[2:09:36] just so happy that she has taken a step
[2:09:39] to get baptized everything today that
[2:09:44] was spoken was not about repentance not
[2:09:47] about water Baptists about receiving the
[2:09:49] Holy Ghost and today what she gave her
[2:09:53] testimony it was really touching because
[2:09:55] she said she had never had an experience
[2:09:57] like she did when her and brother Samuel
[2:10:00] prayed so today we're gonna take her and
[2:10:03] bury her in the water in the name of the
[2:10:07] Lord Jesus Christ and that promise is
[2:10:10] hers most gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[2:10:22] we bring sister Betsy here and we always
[2:10:25] know that you already are with her and
[2:10:28] and we believe father that your promises
[2:10:31] are for us Lord
[2:10:33] and today as she comes walking in faith
[2:10:37] in an obedience to your word and as
[2:10:41] Peter said repent be baptized in the
[2:10:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye
[2:10:46] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:49] sister Beth Betsy upon your confession
[2:10:52] but now baptize you in the name of the
[2:10:55] Lord Jesus
