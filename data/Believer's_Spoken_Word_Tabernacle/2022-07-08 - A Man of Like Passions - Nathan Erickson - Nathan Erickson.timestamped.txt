[34:28] just covet your prayers tonight
[34:30] god will just help us
[34:32] uh james chapter five if i didn't say
[34:34] already
[34:35] and we're going to read verses 16 to 18
[34:37] there
[34:38] little thought tonight on like passions
[34:42] like passions you love the lord tonight
[34:44] yes amen you got to help me preach
[34:46] tonight
[34:47] praise the lord
[34:50] brother if you uh could turn my monitors
[34:52] up just a little bit it'll help my
[34:54] throat tonight as well
[34:55] james chapter 5
[34:58] verses 16. of course a very familiar
[35:00] reading of scripture here's where we get
[35:02] the scripture for you know the anointing
[35:04] of oil
[35:05] and uh uh one of the one of the the
[35:08] rights sort of that we observe in the
[35:10] church for praying for the sick but i i
[35:13] think there's just a there's a wonderful
[35:14] little phrase here james uses this
[35:16] phrase like passions that really has a
[35:18] special meaning to me and it's something
[35:20] that's just opened up to me recently
[35:22] so we asked the lord to help us to bring
[35:24] it out
[35:26] james says confess your faults one to
[35:28] another and pray for one another that
[35:30] you may be healed
[35:32] for the effectual
[35:34] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[35:36] availeth much
[35:38] elijah was a man subject to like
[35:40] passions as we are
[35:42] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[35:44] not rain and it rained not on the earth
[35:46] by the space of three years in six
[35:48] months and he prayed again
[35:49] the heaven gave rain
[35:51] and the earth brought forth her fruit so
[35:54] the great miraculous work
[35:56] that elijah performed james using it to
[36:00] show the power of the prayer of a
[36:01] believer
[36:02] but he wants to insert this phrase in
[36:04] here
[36:05] he wants to have this little reminder
[36:07] for all of us
[36:08] that this great thing that was done was
[36:10] done through a man of like passions
[36:12] amen so this this scripture this
[36:15] this picture of the power and the
[36:17] authority of a believer
[36:19] would not be complete without those like
[36:21] passions
[36:22] god help us to bring it out tonight
[36:24] heavenly father i just thank you lord
[36:26] for these lovely people
[36:28] father and certainly we have a
[36:29] friendship here lord
[36:31] and a love lord and a burden that we
[36:33] want to be a help lord to this assembly
[36:35] lord as as we do your people everywhere
[36:38] lord but especially dear friends and
[36:41] father there's just there's there's
[36:43] nothing quite
[36:44] like standing at the beginning of a of a
[36:47] service lord for a minister
[36:49] lord where we're so faced with our
[36:51] insufficiency
[36:53] lord but we we freely confess lord our
[36:56] our frailty as as human beings lord
[37:00] we're not capable lord although we'd
[37:01] have the we'd have the heart to do it
[37:03] lord but we're not capable
[37:05] father of of of addressing the the very
[37:08] real needs that people of god are facing
[37:11] father in our own humanity we don't have
[37:13] the power
[37:15] lord to to help one another or certainly
[37:17] we would we wouldn't withhold it but but
[37:19] father we don't look to
[37:21] a man or a man's ability tonight
[37:24] father
[37:25] not the intelligence of a man to put a
[37:27] sermon together nor the intelligence
[37:29] lord of a human being to receive that
[37:32] sermon and
[37:33] and dissect it lord and interpret it but
[37:35] father tonight we know that you must be
[37:37] the speaker
[37:39] and father you must also be the
[37:40] interpreter lord and and father we're
[37:43] totally trusting we know upon the the
[37:45] the the holy ghost to come amongst us
[37:48] lord take complete control of these
[37:50] earthen vessels father for we're men and
[37:52] women of like passions lord but father
[37:55] if your holy ghost could have the
[37:56] preeminence we know lord that you could
[37:59] do great things lord that you could
[38:00] speak to hearts that you could just meet
[38:02] the need father tonight
[38:04] and that's what we're desiring father
[38:05] that we could just get out of the way
[38:07] and you could come in father and use use
[38:11] lord the foolishness of preaching
[38:13] father to bring us a little bit higher
[38:15] into you father into a closer fellowship
[38:18] into a greater revelation may it be so
[38:20] father for we dedicate ourselves to you
[38:23] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[38:25] amen amen god bless you as you're seated
[38:27] tonight
[38:28] amen
[38:30] i love this little quote
[38:32] uh brother brandon says
[38:34] uh that it just sort of sets the
[38:36] direction of my thought for tonight he
[38:38] says unworthy is right lord it's brother
[38:41] branham in prayer in one of his his
[38:43] messages he says unworthy is right
[38:46] but if you were looking for holy hands
[38:48] tonight
[38:49] where would you find him
[38:51] for we've all sinned and come short of
[38:53] the glory
[38:54] but oh how we're encouraged to read in
[38:56] the scripture that elijah was a man
[38:58] subject to like passions
[39:00] as we are it wasn't his morals
[39:03] but it was what you had called him to be
[39:05] and what he did with the gift that you
[39:07] give him
[39:08] amen what a what a beautiful thought
[39:10] elijah
[39:11] being a man of like passions elijah
[39:14] it wasn't who elijah was it wasn't the
[39:16] substance of his humanity his merit you
[39:19] know his abilities
[39:21] that god was able to use but it was just
[39:23] the gift that god put in him
[39:25] and a man of god being able to get out
[39:27] of the way and great things could be
[39:28] done amen
[39:30] it's a powerful scripture when you just
[39:31] begin to
[39:33] when you when you when when that element
[39:35] of it opens up to you it's talking
[39:36] speaking here of course like we said of
[39:39] of one of the great works of elijah's
[39:40] ministry just one of the great just
[39:42] outwardly supernatural things that a
[39:44] prophet performed in his life when you
[39:47] know when when when when by prayer he he
[39:50] literally he literally held back the
[39:52] powers of nature and and and withheld
[39:54] the rain from entire land and amen and
[39:57] then with praying again he could restore
[39:59] it just on command you know uh showing
[40:02] absolute power over the natural realm
[40:05] and over over the patterns of weather
[40:07] and just these big you know uh these
[40:10] these cosmic forces of the earth you
[40:12] know were subject to the man elijah and
[40:16] and and and so james is is drawing on
[40:19] this example to show us the power of a
[40:21] believer but but but but but he's doing
[40:24] it in a way
[40:25] not to just explain how great elijah was
[40:28] that's not james's intention here it's
[40:30] not to say look at look at how powerful
[40:33] you know the prayer of elijah was
[40:34] because elijah was a prophet and elijah
[40:36] was this great man but but he wants to
[40:38] make sure that it's very clear that this
[40:41] man that could do this is a man who was
[40:43] subject to the same passions the same
[40:46] humanity the same feelings and
[40:48] and and
[40:50] and just human element that you and i
[40:52] are subject to he was he was a he was a
[40:54] man of like passion so and and it's
[40:57] showing that uh that not how great
[40:59] elijah was but how great a thing god
[41:01] could do through a man that was just
[41:02] like you or me amen that's very powerful
[41:05] to me you know it's you know uh it's
[41:07] showing that in spite of all the great
[41:09] miracles that elijah performed and and
[41:11] we've had an elijah ministry in our day
[41:13] and we can we can talk about
[41:15] supernatural we could talk about great
[41:16] things that were done and healings and
[41:18] miracles and and and and great power and
[41:21] the ex even the exercising of that third
[41:24] pull that adoption authority all these
[41:26] things that we've witnessed were were
[41:28] things that were done through human
[41:30] beings just like you or me amen because
[41:33] uh uh because you know
[41:35] uh elijah was not uh an angel from
[41:38] heaven he wasn't some angelic being he
[41:40] wasn't like a a super spiritual class a
[41:43] person you know that he just never he
[41:45] never you know he just lived up in a
[41:47] realm that was way above you and i no
[41:49] it's not the way it was he was he was a
[41:51] regular guy he was a he was a man he was
[41:53] a human being and and that's that's
[41:55] that's something that's so important for
[41:57] us to remember you know because we have
[42:00] this this tendency in our human nature
[42:02] uh where where we look at we look at
[42:05] what god has done in the past we look at
[42:07] saints of old or we look at people that
[42:08] we look up to or ministries that have
[42:10] come before us or messengers or or or or
[42:13] miracle workers and and all the great
[42:15] things that god has done when in with
[42:17] the benefit of hindsight we look back at
[42:19] those great miraculous works and and we
[42:22] just sort of put them on a pedestal in
[42:23] our mind we we just have that tendency
[42:25] of human nature of of of make these
[42:28] saints of the bible and saints of the
[42:30] history of the church we we make them
[42:31] into just larger than life figures we we
[42:34] turn them into legends we turn them into
[42:36] we put them way up here somewhere as as
[42:38] something that was so powerful you know
[42:40] that that nothing like that had maybe
[42:42] been done before and nothing nothing
[42:44] like it that will ever be done again you
[42:45] know that's just sort of our attitude
[42:47] toward it but but you know the bible
[42:49] wasn't written for legends that's not
[42:51] what this bible was written for to take
[42:52] things that god did in the past and say
[42:54] well you know god used to heal and he
[42:57] used to deliver
[42:58] and he used to do the supernatural and
[43:00] he used to do marvelous works and and
[43:02] men of god used to have authority and
[43:04] sons and daughters of god used to have
[43:05] an effective prayer that that's not what
[43:07] it's about and amen in fact commandment
[43:09] number one in the bible is you're not
[43:11] going to have any idols before me so
[43:14] anytime you take another human being or
[43:16] the the life of another person or the
[43:18] things that that are performed in some
[43:20] other ministry as soon as you take those
[43:22] things and then put them up in a realm
[43:24] somewhere where you cannot attain to
[43:26] that place and to where to where it's
[43:28] something that we can't attain to you've
[43:30] just made an idol out of a work of the
[43:33] lord amen because you put that between
[43:35] you and god
[43:36] somewhere out of reach amen you're not
[43:38] supposed to do that amen just like paul
[43:41] and barnabas you know
[43:42] but it's in our human nature we see that
[43:44] with paul and barnabas they go to a
[43:45] certain city and they raise up a
[43:47] crippled man and they heal him and all
[43:49] immediately all the people rush in and
[43:50] say oh we got to worship these guys
[43:52] because one of them is you know i think
[43:53] mercury and another one's jupiter or
[43:55] something we gotta we gotta worship
[43:57] these guys these are these are super
[43:59] human people you know these are these
[44:01] are some kind of demigods or something
[44:03] and and that was that's just the natural
[44:06] human response to to do that but paul
[44:08] and barnabas they begin to you know wail
[44:10] and rip their clothes they say don't
[44:12] don't worship us we're men of like
[44:14] passions
[44:15] don't don't don't worship us we're we're
[44:18] just here to prove that there's a god
[44:20] who can do these things amen amen so we
[44:22] find that the bible is not the story of
[44:25] who god used to be and what he used to
[44:27] be and the things that god used to do
[44:29] you know and he used to he used to be a
[44:30] certain thing and neither is the message
[44:32] the story of what god used to be if you
[44:35] think this message is about what god did
[44:37] in prayer lines 60 70 years ago and you
[44:39] know the the miraculous things that were
[44:42] that happened in the life of a of a
[44:43] prophet and it's just all about you know
[44:45] hunting stories and things like that and
[44:47] and well if you weren't born back then
[44:49] i'm sorry i guess you missed it no
[44:50] that's not what the message is about
[44:52] amen but the by the message is not for
[44:55] legends the bible is not for legends but
[44:57] these things are showing us amen to
[45:00] prove to you that anything is possible
[45:02] to any human being that is surrendered
[45:04] to god amen when brother branham brought
[45:07] this message it brought an excitement to
[45:08] people those of you maybe that that
[45:10] remember though those early days of the
[45:12] message what was the cry what was the
[45:14] the watch word what was what were people
[45:17] what was the passion on people's hearts
[45:19] was to say to to say look bible days are
[45:22] here again anyone ever heard that one
[45:24] bible days are here again
[45:26] this is not a god of history amen but
[45:28] but but brother bran's ministry was
[45:30] showing to us this is a real and living
[45:32] god who can do the same things he used
[45:34] to do
[45:35] so the god of peter is here that's what
[45:37] the message says paul's god is here
[45:39] elijah's god is here
[45:41] amen to will and do amen amen so so the
[45:45] they're put in there not to make you
[45:47] know some uh not to make an idol out of
[45:49] a human being but to show you what's
[45:51] possible in a life that's surrendered to
[45:53] god so elijah is not just who we should
[45:55] admire
[45:57] elijah's who we could be
[45:59] amen well you well you know of course
[46:01] you may not have the gift of prophecy
[46:03] like elijah had it might not be your
[46:04] ministry you know to to to perform the
[46:07] miracles like like elijah
[46:09] mir
[46:10] perform but but yet you can know
[46:13] elijah's god that's the that's the real
[46:15] point of it that there's a real living
[46:17] god that can be that can do the
[46:19] supernatural in your life and can be
[46:21] sufficient for you the way that he was
[46:23] for elijah
[46:24] amen
[46:26] amen brother brahm said god uses man and
[46:29] man only amen
[46:31] and god doesn't use machinery
[46:33] god doesn't use groups of men no sir god
[46:36] doesn't use organizations he said god
[46:38] always uses individuals amen that means
[46:42] god didn't come to build a church on
[46:44] what william branham did for the lord or
[46:46] what elijah did for the lord he didn't
[46:48] come to build a group around that or an
[46:50] organization amen but elijah's god came
[46:54] to draw individual humanity to himself
[46:57] and say look uh elijah's ministry proves
[47:00] i am a real god then if i'm god then
[47:02] serve me
[47:03] amen if i do the supernatural then serve
[47:05] me believe me
[47:07] if i've proven that i'm a healer then
[47:09] i'm here to heal you if i've proven i'm
[47:11] a deliverer i'm here to deliver you
[47:13] i'm here to be your comforter i'm here
[47:15] to be a god that speaks
[47:17] not an idol not not uh you know not a
[47:20] god of history
[47:21] god uses individuals amen but but it's a
[47:25] beautiful thing to have
[47:26] to have like passions
[47:29] everyone knows what that means it means
[47:31] you know we have like passions so we we
[47:33] feel the same things
[47:37] we feel the same things uh we go through
[47:39] the same we we experience life in a
[47:41] similar way so maybe the circumstances
[47:44] of my life are not the same as yours and
[47:46] yet we can understand one another we can
[47:47] relate to one another because we have
[47:49] like passions
[47:51] we feel the same and and we find that
[47:53] human beings are very emotional
[47:54] creatures
[47:55] we're very emotional but we're very
[47:57] similar in our emotions we can
[47:59] understand one another in our emotions
[48:01] thank the lord you know uh you you ever
[48:04] you where you want to see the just the
[48:05] emotional side of humanity i think the
[48:08] best book of the bible for that is the
[48:09] book of psalms because psalms is a book
[48:11] of expression
[48:13] it's a book where the psalmists you know
[48:15] are are writing some poetry or the or a
[48:17] song or lyrics which are expressing
[48:20] something that's down in their heart and
[48:22] it just it really shows the like
[48:24] passions of humanity to me you know
[48:26] because the psalms are so powerful
[48:29] in expressing the things that they
[48:30] express they express sorrow they express
[48:33] you know guilt they express joy they
[48:36] express peace they express these things
[48:38] in a way that you or i can identify with
[48:40] that and yet when you think about the
[48:42] writer of the psalms i think many times
[48:44] about about king david and how how alien
[48:47] his life is to the human experience that
[48:50] you and i are living to the experience
[48:52] of somebody in in the year 2022 living
[48:55] in america and lay out a cn dispensation
[48:58] it's a it's very different
[49:00] you know to think about you know i don't
[49:01] have any servants at my house it would
[49:03] be nice sometimes but i don't you know i
[49:06] don't but i don't have a you know i
[49:07] don't have people that work for me and
[49:09] they labor for me but here's david
[49:11] he's a monarch he's he's got absolute
[49:14] authority over a kingdom he's got
[49:15] hundreds of servants at his beck and
[49:17] call he's he's he's moving armies around
[49:20] the map and and
[49:22] and he's got this military power he's
[49:24] got all these different things i only
[49:26] have one wife at home but david had at
[49:28] least eight so clearly he was living a
[49:30] very different experience than what i'm
[49:33] accustomed to you know and here david
[49:35] you know he's living in a he so he's
[49:37] living this life of just absolute
[49:38] authority you know
[49:41] the head of a kingdom and he's living in
[49:43] the bronze age david never had an iphone
[49:46] dev david never got on facebook david
[49:48] never paid you know played a a a candy
[49:51] crush on his on his iphone and you know
[49:53] checked his tweets and he never he never
[49:55] experienced the world the way that you
[49:57] and i are experiencing it's a different
[49:59] society it's a different time it's a
[50:01] it's a totally different human
[50:03] experience and yet you can read those
[50:05] psalms
[50:06] amen and and and they can be so real and
[50:09] so relevant to what you're feeling amen
[50:12] until tears just begin to run down your
[50:14] eyes and amen it's showing that it's
[50:17] showing the universal experience of a
[50:19] human heart that's crying out for god
[50:21] it's a beautiful thing to have like
[50:23] passions of humanity to have to know
[50:26] that there's things below the
[50:27] superficial level you know of the
[50:29] conditions that we're living in and the
[50:31] lifestyle that we're used to and the
[50:33] technology around us and all those
[50:35] things way down below that is something
[50:37] so real and so fundamental to being a
[50:39] human being
[50:41] that it just flows from your heart amen
[50:43] when when david says all have mercy upon
[50:46] me oh lord for i am in trouble you can
[50:48] relate to that because you know what it
[50:50] is to be in trouble you know what it is
[50:52] to cry out to god say god i'm in a mess
[50:54] right now but but god my heart is crying
[50:57] out for a living god somebody who can
[50:59] get me out of where i'm in
[51:01] amen when he says show me thy ways o
[51:03] lord teach me thy past and that that
[51:06] scripture means so much to me there in
[51:08] psalms 119 i remember reading that as a
[51:10] young man and just that desire that dave
[51:12] is expressing saying god i want to know
[51:14] you i want to understand you i want to
[51:16] have fellowship with you teach me your
[51:18] ways
[51:19] teach me let me understand you show me
[51:22] lord oh that means so much to me as a
[51:24] young man it still does but i remember
[51:26] tears just running down my face
[51:29] reading that scripture because david's
[51:30] speaking the very expression of my heart
[51:34] when he says my soul longeth even
[51:37] fainteth for the courts of the lord my
[51:39] heart and my flesh are crying out for
[51:42] the living god
[51:45] amen then you and i can feel that
[51:47] passion
[51:48] because to be human is to yearn for god
[51:52] to be human is to yearn for god everyone
[51:55] yearns for god and some people press it
[51:57] way down and
[51:58] try to drown it out with worldly
[52:00] pursuits and pleasures and things like
[52:02] that but to be human
[52:04] is to feel these feelings is to yearn
[52:06] for this god the living god amen it's a
[52:09] beautiful thing it's showing the like
[52:11] passions of humanity and i i'm building
[52:14] to something with this i know that it's
[52:16] simple but it's very powerful actually
[52:18] because it's very fundamental to just
[52:20] who we are and what we are but to be
[52:23] human is to yearn for god that's why
[52:24] brother branson said no wonder people
[52:26] today will crawl on their knees you know
[52:28] they'll touch stones and rub crosses and
[52:30] because something in the human soul is
[52:32] crying out for something that they can't
[52:34] find
[52:35] amen it's the deep calling to the deep
[52:37] and if there's a deep calling there has
[52:39] to be a deep to respond amen there has
[52:42] to be as sure as the warm sun bathes
[52:44] across the fields amen but and down
[52:47] somewhere beneath invisible to the human
[52:49] eye brother brown said there's
[52:50] vegetation there's life that will spring
[52:53] forth
[52:54] when that sun comes over that field as
[52:56] sure as the sunlight of god he said baze
[52:58] into the human heart there's a little
[53:00] hidden something there that men can't
[53:02] explain
[53:03] and it's calling out amen isn't that so
[53:05] true and so beautiful
[53:07] amen to just to be a human is to have
[53:10] that little voice that little tug that
[53:11] little vibration on the inside saying i
[53:14] i'm crying out for god amen you know you
[53:17] might be you somebody might be here
[53:19] under the sound of my voice you know and
[53:21] uh under my ministry tonight and and and
[53:23] your life maybe is not really focused on
[53:25] god you're just in a condition of your
[53:27] life that where you know
[53:29] it's just not your top priority not that
[53:31] you're not a trying to be a good person
[53:33] and sincere and go to church but you
[53:35] know you've got a lot of other things
[53:36] going on in your life and maybe
[53:38] spiritually you're not where you're
[53:39] supposed to be
[53:40] amen and yet and yet when the word is
[53:43] being preached and when you when you
[53:45] come to church and and the people begin
[53:47] to worship and you come into that
[53:48] atmosphere
[53:50] and you're hearing the word and and the
[53:52] and ministers are casting the net and
[53:54] even though your life isn't where it's
[53:55] supposed to be maybe you're maybe you're
[53:57] not actively searching for god but you
[53:59] feel that little tug that familiar
[54:01] little that that little impulse on the
[54:04] inside what a beautiful thing that is
[54:06] amen what what a work of grace that god
[54:08] would put that down in your heart that
[54:10] little seed amen that little that little
[54:13] bit of potential that's crying out for a
[54:15] living god saying god i'm really not
[54:17] satisfied with just some religious death
[54:20] i'm really not satisfied to just lie
[54:23] here in this earth and and be like the
[54:25] rest of the earth but i know there's a
[54:26] life on the inside i don't fully
[54:28] understand it but it's but i feel it
[54:31] i feel it
[54:32] because i'm a human being and to be
[54:34] human is to yearn for god there's a
[54:36] light passion on the inside i can
[54:38] identify with the preaching of the wire
[54:40] because something on the very inside of
[54:43] me belongs to that that's me
[54:45] it's calling me it's pulling me it's
[54:47] drawing me
[54:49] that's beautiful friends amen amen
[54:51] that's that seed of god and we've found
[54:54] that there's a light in the message of
[54:56] the hour there's a light in this open
[54:58] word that can bring that little seed
[55:00] dancing and
[55:01] and bursting and shouting to life there
[55:04] there's a quickening power that that
[55:06] goes with this word this is not just a
[55:08] letter word but it's a spirit word it's
[55:10] a spirit message it brings an atmosphere
[55:13] it brings a light that we can bask under
[55:15] until that that little hunger for god
[55:17] that little something can grow and grow
[55:20] and grow
[55:21] into something great
[55:23] amen because it's a seed and a seed
[55:25] represents potential
[55:28] it represents potential you know
[55:30] like the lily brother brandon preached
[55:32] about some of his easter services and
[55:34] things
[55:35] that little lily you know that starts
[55:37] out it starts out as a seed
[55:40] and it's way down
[55:41] you know in the like our water lilies
[55:43] it'd be way down in the dirt somewhere
[55:45] in the mud and mire on the bottom of a
[55:47] of a pond you know
[55:49] some stagnant pond and and and you know
[55:52] that seed will lay down there in that
[55:53] earth and when you look at that seed and
[55:55] this would describe some of you
[55:57] where you've been in your life and where
[55:59] you started with the lord because when
[56:01] you look over that seed you could pass
[56:02] through you could dig through that dirt
[56:04] you wouldn't even you would probably
[56:05] miss it with all the petal pebbles and
[56:08] little twigs and things and mulch
[56:10] you wouldn't even be able to distinguish
[56:12] that seed from the rest of the earth
[56:13] around it
[56:14] but it's got a potential that the earth
[56:16] doesn't have
[56:17] it's got a potential the rest of the
[56:19] world doesn't have
[56:20] amen but and so you know that seed will
[56:22] lay there and lay there and lay there
[56:24] and it'll be nothing more than dirt
[56:26] maybe for years
[56:28] until
[56:29] until it comes into that right
[56:31] atmosphere
[56:32] it might be that one little sunbeam will
[56:34] just bounce down the granules of that
[56:36] dirt all the way down and somehow it
[56:38] finds its way down to you know deepest
[56:40] darkest lorraine ohio somewhere
[56:43] and just and it'll hit that little seed
[56:45] and you know and and that seed will just
[56:48] come into that atmosphere and it may not
[56:50] even understand what's happened to it
[56:51] all it knows is it just felt a real warm
[56:54] you know just something a real warm
[56:56] presence come over it you know
[56:58] it's not always you know it's not always
[57:00] when a seed gets quick and it's not
[57:02] always some explosive event it doesn't
[57:03] blow a crater you know it's not some
[57:05] great explosion many times but it's just
[57:07] a little it's just a little awakening a
[57:10] little something a little tug on the
[57:11] inside just a little
[57:13] like that but it begins to quicken and
[57:15] once it's quickened you'll never hold it
[57:17] back then amen all of a sudden
[57:19] everything changes all of a sudden it's
[57:21] not conden content to stay down there in
[57:23] the earth so it it starts to dig and
[57:25] push and it begins to fight against the
[57:27] dirt that's all around it and it doesn't
[57:29] even know which way's up or down you
[57:31] know it just but something in it makes
[57:33] it push
[57:34] and it pushes and shoves and fights and
[57:36] it's getting it's just dirty and you
[57:38] know it's it's it's filthy with with all
[57:41] that dirt down there on the bottom of
[57:42] that but it'll push and push and push
[57:44] and suddenly there's a breakthrough
[57:47] amen and it comes it breaks through into
[57:49] another realm amen
[57:52] why because there's a law on the inside
[57:54] that what that little human what start
[57:56] just that little desire amen grows into
[58:00] a fight it grows into a war pushing out
[58:03] and and fighting until it comes to a
[58:05] breakthrough but you know it'll have a
[58:06] breakthrough but suddenly it's under
[58:08] water
[58:10] it'll have a breakthrough but it finds
[58:12] itself underwater you know and as that
[58:14] begins to it begins to push and stretch
[58:16] and grow and we find that the currents
[58:18] will come through that water and it'll
[58:20] push that little seed this way and it'll
[58:22] push the little lily that way you know
[58:24] and back and forth and just tossed
[58:26] around by those waves and things and
[58:28] currents you know and all that pressure
[58:30] the water is pushing down on it and you
[58:32] know it but it can't hold that seed back
[58:35] you know because it just it's got to
[58:36] push there's a law in it it's gotta it's
[58:39] gotta it's gotta strive and and grow and
[58:42] stretch and push and and so something on
[58:44] the inside of it that same desire that
[58:46] quicken it amen causes it to fight
[58:48] through the mud causes it to break
[58:50] through causes it to swim against the
[58:51] current and suddenly it comes out and
[58:54] takes that first brush that first breath
[58:56] of fresh air you know comes out into the
[58:58] open sunshine and amen then it can come
[59:01] into blossom and it can just it could
[59:03] just give of its savior like brother
[59:05] branham said and you know it it becomes
[59:07] a beautiful thing but you know because
[59:10] it all started with that just that
[59:12] desire that that little common human
[59:15] potential down on the inside that crying
[59:18] out for a living god it's that same law
[59:20] of the seed
[59:21] in a christian life and it'll push out
[59:24] and it'll it'll come out there and just
[59:26] just just
[59:27] just stretch out on top of that water
[59:30] and come to its rest come to its
[59:32] maturity brother brown said that's the
[59:33] overcomer he overcame the mud
[59:36] he overcame the things of the world
[59:39] and now he freely gives himself out
[59:41] everyone can look at him his life you
[59:43] can't put a finger on it why he's a real
[59:45] overcomer
[59:46] you can't say anything about him now
[59:48] amen you say well he came out of the mud
[59:51] but he's not in the mud now
[59:53] glory he's on top of it
[59:56] you can't point at what he was what is
[59:58] he now
[59:59] he's on top
[1:00:00] he's on top what a beautiful picture
[1:00:03] of the overcomer of the potential of a
[1:00:05] seed amen but you know we find that the
[1:00:07] the the struggle for a lot of christians
[1:00:10] and the the real challenge for a lot of
[1:00:12] christians especially young people but i
[1:00:14] think we all go through a cycle of
[1:00:16] feeling this way amen uh that that that
[1:00:19] we're all at different stages of the
[1:00:20] lily you know in our life and and
[1:00:22] sometimes you got somebody who's really
[1:00:24] just they're in a battle in their life
[1:00:26] and they're really pushing through some
[1:00:27] things looking for a breakthrough
[1:00:29] something like that then you look over
[1:00:31] the pastor or or the elder in the church
[1:00:33] or somebody that you look up to or look
[1:00:35] at brother branham or the ministry or
[1:00:37] something you know and we're looking at
[1:00:38] other christian people and and it seems
[1:00:41] like their lives are so far beyond ours
[1:00:44] that it's just way out of reach you know
[1:00:48] because oh that's a real lily me i'm not
[1:00:50] so sure
[1:00:52] me i'm not so sure you know and that's
[1:00:54] the way that it is with christians we're
[1:00:55] all at those different stages you know
[1:00:57] you could preach this sermon in
[1:00:58] different places and you might preach to
[1:01:00] one that's still a seed and it's never
[1:01:01] been quickened and you look at their
[1:01:03] life and it's no different from the the
[1:01:05] the rest of the worldly people around
[1:01:07] them it's just indistinguishable from
[1:01:08] the dirt of this world
[1:01:10] and then you find that others they have
[1:01:11] a quickening they've had a quickening in
[1:01:13] their life some some kind of a just a a
[1:01:16] a a spiritual awakening and so but
[1:01:18] they're fighting you know they got a lot
[1:01:20] of filth and a lot of a lot of dirty
[1:01:22] things in their life that they're just
[1:01:23] fighting through and pushing through and
[1:01:25] you know they don't they don't maybe see
[1:01:28] god's plan because it's just a real
[1:01:29] early days of just pushing through that
[1:01:31] darkness
[1:01:32] not maybe not always knowing where
[1:01:34] you're going you know
[1:01:35] some people come to a breakthrough but
[1:01:37] then you know you might have had a
[1:01:38] breakthrough in your life but you came
[1:01:40] to church tonight and if you're honest
[1:01:42] with your with with uh with me tonight
[1:01:44] you'd say well brother nathan i just
[1:01:45] feel like i'm drowning
[1:01:47] i know that i've had experiences with
[1:01:49] god i know that i know there's been a
[1:01:50] growth of my life but right now i'm
[1:01:52] really under a lot of weight and i just
[1:01:54] feel like i'm drowning
[1:01:56] and i just feel like i'm just tossed to
[1:01:58] and fro and all the currents of
[1:02:00] laodicean life and all you know i'm just
[1:02:03] i'm just i'm just going with the flow
[1:02:05] sometimes i think maybe brother nathan
[1:02:07] i'll give up not just be a weed
[1:02:10] but you'll never be a weed
[1:02:12] because if the life on the inside is a
[1:02:14] lily the potential that's in you is to
[1:02:15] be a lily so you might give up and try
[1:02:18] to say well i'm just going to go with
[1:02:19] the flow i give up i'm just going to let
[1:02:21] it toss amen after a while you'll find
[1:02:24] that you won't be happy there
[1:02:26] amen like brother biscuit said one time
[1:02:28] you ever tried to throw in the towel and
[1:02:29] you couldn't find the towel
[1:02:31] but because there's just something in
[1:02:33] you that's different from everything
[1:02:34] around you but that's the stage of life
[1:02:36] you're in then you're looking at say oh
[1:02:38] you know but look at brother so and so
[1:02:40] he's he's on top
[1:02:42] you know and he he's just in full bloom
[1:02:44] and i can smell the fragrance of his
[1:02:46] life and so maybe he's a lillian but but
[1:02:49] i'm not
[1:02:51] hey man
[1:02:53] but here's what you got to realize when
[1:02:55] that little seed was laying there dead
[1:02:56] in the ground that was a lily
[1:02:59] when it was pushing its way through all
[1:03:01] that muck and mud it was still a lily
[1:03:04] when it broke through into that water
[1:03:06] and had to swim against the current
[1:03:08] and and and lay under the pressure of
[1:03:10] all the weight of that water that's
[1:03:11] still a lily amen and that one that's up
[1:03:14] there on top that you and i look to and
[1:03:16] we say wow they're just their life is so
[1:03:18] far beyond that one day they were where
[1:03:20] you were at
[1:03:21] amen they were down nailing laying in
[1:03:23] the earth unconverted but they were a
[1:03:25] lily and when they were pushing through
[1:03:27] the the the filthy things of this world
[1:03:30] in their life when they were battling
[1:03:32] some of these things that was they were
[1:03:33] a lily
[1:03:34] they were lily to swim against the
[1:03:36] current they were
[1:03:37] lily that pushed out they were lily hey
[1:03:40] man it's still a lily every stage of the
[1:03:42] journey but the great lie that satan
[1:03:44] puts on christian people is we get to
[1:03:47] comparing ourselves to one another which
[1:03:48] we should never do
[1:03:50] and we compare ourselves to one another
[1:03:52] and say well that brother he's on top of
[1:03:54] this and he's so far beyond me there but
[1:03:56] you're of the same substance you're
[1:03:59] still a lily
[1:04:00] you're not a different something you are
[1:04:03] a human being and they're a human being
[1:04:05] and the same god that brought them to
[1:04:07] the top can bring you amen amen because
[1:04:10] you know we just got to get real about
[1:04:12] it
[1:04:13] amen there are things in my life i'm not
[1:04:15] on top of
[1:04:16] sometimes and there's things in your
[1:04:18] life
[1:04:19] you're not on top of it either
[1:04:21] amen it's because we're all lilies we're
[1:04:23] all growing and pushing and striving
[1:04:26] and trying to come to a fuller blossom
[1:04:28] in our life
[1:04:29] amen but the great lie that satan tries
[1:04:31] to tell us is because you don't look
[1:04:33] like somebody that you're idolizing
[1:04:34] you're not that you're not a lily like
[1:04:36] that are but there's a lie there's no
[1:04:38] difference in what you are the
[1:04:40] difference is the stage
[1:04:41] of life that you're at
[1:04:43] but it's that same law of that seed
[1:04:46] same law of who you are
[1:04:48] same law of potential working
[1:04:51] amen so we so we find that we find our
[1:04:54] security not in comparing our life to
[1:04:56] one another
[1:04:57] not in comparing our religious works or
[1:04:59] our religious excellence or where we're
[1:05:02] at in the stages of christianity and
[1:05:04] where you're at in the cycle that's not
[1:05:06] what really we're looking at but we find
[1:05:08] rest in knowing amen that if you're that
[1:05:12] you're a human being and i'm a human
[1:05:14] being
[1:05:15] and there's places maybe you look to me
[1:05:17] and i look to you but we recognize that
[1:05:20] the same god that interceded for this
[1:05:21] humanity can intercede for your humanity
[1:05:24] same god that that was that was was real
[1:05:27] for elijah the same god that that
[1:05:29] brought him out will bring you out amen
[1:05:32] the same one that that will bring one to
[1:05:34] blossom will bring another amen by the
[1:05:36] same law
[1:05:37] because it doesn't have anything to do
[1:05:38] with the humanity
[1:05:40] it has to do with the seed
[1:05:42] glory be to god amen
[1:05:45] you think oh my
[1:05:47] you know uh
[1:05:48] like the scripture says we all walked
[1:05:50] according to the course of this world
[1:05:53] we all had our conversation with the
[1:05:55] lusts of our flesh we were all by nature
[1:05:57] the children of wrath
[1:05:59] well except for you brother bill
[1:06:01] you were never by nature the child of
[1:06:03] wrath
[1:06:04] brother richard you never had your
[1:06:05] conversation according to the nature of
[1:06:07] this world right
[1:06:08] you were just born a deacon
[1:06:12] no we find that a human being
[1:06:14] is a human being
[1:06:16] and as much as we're all different and
[1:06:17] your tastes and your personality and
[1:06:19] your characteristics are different from
[1:06:21] mine and there's great diversity in the
[1:06:22] kingdom of god
[1:06:24] but as much as there is all that when
[1:06:25] you get right down to the core of it a
[1:06:27] human being
[1:06:28] is a human being
[1:06:30] is a human being you say well brother
[1:06:33] nathan that that's pretty simple i i get
[1:06:35] that
[1:06:36] have you learned to draw comfort from
[1:06:38] that
[1:06:39] that's why i really want to that's what
[1:06:41] i really want to bring out tonight if
[1:06:43] the lord just helped me
[1:06:45] brother braham said the greatest enemy
[1:06:47] i've got
[1:06:49] is william branham
[1:06:51] this is really a an amazing statement
[1:06:54] actually
[1:06:55] he said the greatest enemy of god is
[1:06:56] william branham he's the one that gets
[1:06:58] in god's way he's the one that gets lazy
[1:07:01] wow
[1:07:03] he's the one who gets to a place
[1:07:04] sometimes where he thinks he can do it
[1:07:08] he can do something about it and when he
[1:07:09] does it shoves god right out of the
[1:07:11] picture that's pretty relatable actually
[1:07:13] amen but he says but when i can get rid
[1:07:15] of that guy
[1:07:18] when i can get to a place that he's out
[1:07:20] of the way then god can come over and do
[1:07:22] things that william branham knows
[1:07:24] nothing about
[1:07:25] that's when god can use you that's when
[1:07:28] he can use any of you he can use anybody
[1:07:32] when we get out of the way
[1:07:34] he can use anybody
[1:07:36] when we get out of the way this is a
[1:07:38] powerful thing for you and i realize
[1:07:40] friends because look at the guy that
[1:07:42] he's talking about has to get out of the
[1:07:43] way he's talking about william branham a
[1:07:46] man who was born a prophet
[1:07:48] he came into this world a prophet from
[1:07:50] birth he was called you know for a great
[1:07:52] calling he had a gift in his life he was
[1:07:54] born a prophet his life was foretold in
[1:07:57] malachi 4. amen he was a forerunner he
[1:08:00] was known of god he was his ministry was
[1:08:02] prophesied in the scripture
[1:08:04] this
[1:08:05] you know what he is to you and i
[1:08:07] but he had to be put aside so if william
[1:08:11] branham had to be put aside for god to
[1:08:13] be able to use him how much more are you
[1:08:15] and i gonna have to get out of the way
[1:08:18] and you know sometimes what getting out
[1:08:20] of the way means it means getting over
[1:08:21] yourself
[1:08:23] amen stop harboring so much on your
[1:08:25] insufficiencies and your frailties and
[1:08:28] oh i can't do it and god choose someone
[1:08:30] else
[1:08:31] he chose you because of those things
[1:08:34] amen that's the whole point of it really
[1:08:36] is that you and i do not possess within
[1:08:38] ourselves the power to be what god has
[1:08:41] called us to be
[1:08:43] but he can use anybody
[1:08:45] he can use anybody that will get out of
[1:08:48] the way
[1:08:50] and a majority of the problems in our
[1:08:52] christian life is because we won't get
[1:08:54] out of the way and we think that we know
[1:08:56] something about it
[1:08:57] and that we can just fix it all just
[1:08:58] right
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] but he can use anybody
[1:09:03] when we get out of the way
[1:09:05] amen oh my you've got to get out of the
[1:09:08] way brother braham said you know people
[1:09:10] get in their head today you know like if
[1:09:12] god was would do anything he'd have to
[1:09:14] do it by an angel and send an angel down
[1:09:16] from heaven and let him do it
[1:09:18] he said god doesn't send angels
[1:09:20] man is god's servant
[1:09:22] he said and elijah was a man subject to
[1:09:24] like passions as we are he was not an
[1:09:26] angel he was a man he was so human and
[1:09:29] he had the same ups and downs as you and
[1:09:31] i had
[1:09:32] that's what god uses amen we get to the
[1:09:35] place sometimes where you say god you
[1:09:37] know if you're going to do something in
[1:09:38] my life you're just going to have to
[1:09:39] send an angel from heaven and you know
[1:09:41] and give me a word of prophecy and you
[1:09:44] know and you're just going to have to do
[1:09:45] something supernatural lord because i
[1:09:47] can't do it
[1:09:48] i can't be what you want me to be you're
[1:09:49] gonna have to do more lord
[1:09:53] and just you know stay right in god's
[1:09:55] way with that attitude
[1:09:57] amen but when you can get out of the way
[1:10:00] say god i know that i'm nothing
[1:10:02] but i know you you're
[1:10:04] you're something you you can you can use
[1:10:07] nothing you can make you can make
[1:10:09] something out of nothing
[1:10:10] hey man i know that i'm weak but your
[1:10:13] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:10:16] i know that i'm insufficient but your
[1:10:18] grace is sufficient for me
[1:10:20] amen it takes a change of attitude
[1:10:22] amen to realize that
[1:10:24] because
[1:10:25] we look at our humanity as a some great
[1:10:29] obstacle for god
[1:10:31] it's really a twisted form of pride when
[1:10:33] you think about it
[1:10:34] you say god you can't use me
[1:10:37] because my humanity is so powerful
[1:10:41] you know my weakness is such a big deal
[1:10:43] you don't even know god
[1:10:45] how big my problems are
[1:10:47] how weak i really am
[1:10:49] you're just gonna have to send an angel
[1:10:52] amen and see the way that we we get
[1:10:54] about it till we just we begin to lift
[1:10:56] up our humanity to the point where god
[1:10:58] can't use you
[1:11:00] but it comes to a place of acknowledging
[1:11:02] our your humanity and say god now you
[1:11:04] come in and use me anyway
[1:11:06] god you come in and and be my strength
[1:11:08] anyway god i'm i want to get out of the
[1:11:10] way i want to get over myself hey man i
[1:11:14] don't want to have this this twisted
[1:11:15] pride that would just magnify my
[1:11:18] failures to the point where i don't
[1:11:19] believe that you can you can be in me
[1:11:21] what you were in every other human being
[1:11:24] knowing that god well god just say that
[1:11:26] oh god you know you can't use me you
[1:11:29] can't you can't be real to me like you
[1:11:30] were to elijah you can't be real to me
[1:11:32] like you were to brother branham you
[1:11:34] can't be real to me like you are to
[1:11:35] pastor samuel god i know that that
[1:11:38] because of who i am and because uh but
[1:11:41] but
[1:11:42] was an elijah human being
[1:11:44] subject to like passions wasn't brother
[1:11:47] brandon a human being subject to like
[1:11:49] passions isn't the pastor a human being
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:53] he is
[1:11:54] subject to like passions but see if god
[1:11:57] can do something in one human being he
[1:11:59] can do it through any human being
[1:12:02] through any human being but you've got
[1:12:04] to get out of the way
[1:12:06] amen to think that elijah here riverband
[1:12:09] said he was a man subject to pat like
[1:12:11] passions with the same ups and downs
[1:12:14] that's what really gets us you know it's
[1:12:17] great you know we're up one day and
[1:12:18] that's wonderful you know you're just
[1:12:19] ready to go out of church on sunday
[1:12:21] morning you're ready to fight every
[1:12:22] devil in hell
[1:12:24] and then monday you swing back down this
[1:12:26] way a little bit
[1:12:27] and all of a sudden it's all over
[1:12:29] you know but elijah had the ups and
[1:12:32] downs
[1:12:32] moses had the ups and downs brother
[1:12:34] branham had the ups and downs
[1:12:37] that's just being a human being
[1:12:39] but their lives are proving to us that
[1:12:41] in spite of ups and downs in spite of
[1:12:43] being human flesh in spite of like
[1:12:46] passions
[1:12:47] god can use a human being
[1:12:49] it's a really beautiful thing you know i
[1:12:51] know that it's simple but i think it's
[1:12:53] something we're all struggling with
[1:12:55] if we're really if we're really honest
[1:12:57] about it
[1:12:59] you know because here elijah you think
[1:13:01] of the story elijah and we know that
[1:13:03] elijah got frustrated
[1:13:05] we know that elijah got discouraged in
[1:13:06] his ministry and things he gets to the
[1:13:08] place he's dealing with so much
[1:13:09] rejection
[1:13:10] so much loneliness and things and gets
[1:13:13] to the place where that jezebel
[1:13:14] religions run them down into hiding
[1:13:17] somewhere and you know you know the
[1:13:19] picture
[1:13:20] oh god
[1:13:22] just take me
[1:13:25] and i'm not making fun of elijah i just
[1:13:26] relate to him a lot
[1:13:28] you know so dramatic oh god just take me
[1:13:33] that's it god i can't take anymore just
[1:13:35] take me
[1:13:36] you know
[1:13:38] you somebody else
[1:13:39] and i thought when i when i went and
[1:13:41] just uh
[1:13:42] refreshed myself on the scripture and
[1:13:44] studying this thought it actually really
[1:13:45] struck me his reasoning
[1:13:48] saying god just take me now my
[1:13:49] ministry's over everything you know
[1:13:51] everything's falling apart just take me
[1:13:53] because he says i'm no better than my
[1:13:56] father's
[1:13:58] that's that hit me that hit me so hard
[1:14:00] brother sister and because i i just
[1:14:02] pondered that from home and i thought
[1:14:04] well why would he be brother bill
[1:14:06] why would elijah be more than abraham
[1:14:09] was
[1:14:10] what did it what was it that made him
[1:14:12] think he would be more than isaac more
[1:14:14] than jacob more than the human beings
[1:14:16] that they were maybe elijah's looking at
[1:14:19] his own ministry and the message that
[1:14:21] he's carrying and he was under he was
[1:14:23] under a misconception because of the
[1:14:25] message that he was carrying he thought
[1:14:26] that he should be more than he was
[1:14:29] and then when he could be confronted
[1:14:30] with his humanity he just you know he
[1:14:32] gets real dramatic with god like we do
[1:14:34] sometimes
[1:14:35] he throws up his hand say god take me
[1:14:37] i'm no better than my father's
[1:14:39] and then and he wasn't
[1:14:41] he was the same humanity
[1:14:44] amen it's quite beautiful and then god
[1:14:46] comes down
[1:14:47] you know and brings a word of
[1:14:49] encouragement like i'm trying to bring
[1:14:50] you tonight and i thought it's quite
[1:14:52] powerful you know here he he takes his
[1:14:54] servant aside and you and i might have
[1:14:56] come now and said don't worry elijah
[1:14:58] listen you know i know things are tough
[1:15:00] right now next sunday you're going to go
[1:15:02] back and there's going to be 10 000
[1:15:03] people in your church
[1:15:05] you know and all those kings everybody
[1:15:07] that rejected you you're going to get
[1:15:09] the last laugh and all those kings and
[1:15:10] emperors are going to start inviting you
[1:15:12] to their courts again to prophesy and
[1:15:14] things and and i'm going to take your
[1:15:16] ministry back to where it was and all
[1:15:17] this discouragement that you're dealing
[1:15:18] this is just a temporary setback
[1:15:21] i'm going to come down i'm just going to
[1:15:22] move it out of the way for you
[1:15:24] that's not the encouragement that elijah
[1:15:27] gets
[1:15:28] no the lord comes down
[1:15:30] and he says elijah here's what i got for
[1:15:32] you buddy
[1:15:35] you're not alone
[1:15:38] i've got 7 000 people
[1:15:41] that are in the same shape that you're
[1:15:43] in
[1:15:44] they're battling the same thing that
[1:15:46] you're battling they're going through
[1:15:47] the same thing that you're going through
[1:15:49] you're not the only one elijah
[1:15:52] i got 7 000 more just like you
[1:15:55] amen what a beautiful thing you know
[1:15:58] that's very real friends you know we
[1:16:00] find it around this message this message
[1:16:03] a lot of people around this message are
[1:16:04] dealing with great loneliness
[1:16:06] you know because uh it doesn't it's not
[1:16:08] something that draws the whole world
[1:16:11] uh many of us are sitting here have have
[1:16:13] parted ways with family
[1:16:14] you parted way with dear friends to stay
[1:16:17] with the word of god
[1:16:18] you know the pain of rejection you can
[1:16:20] identify with those things it's very
[1:16:22] real to us
[1:16:23] but look at our example look at brother
[1:16:25] branham who was a man of like passions
[1:16:27] you know he came to a place in his
[1:16:28] ministry where he got he got to you talk
[1:16:31] about rejection he knew what it felt
[1:16:33] like because here's a man you know i was
[1:16:35] listening to one of his sermons in
[1:16:36] sierra vista arizona and it just i i was
[1:16:39] like wow it's just struck me like never
[1:16:41] before now here's a man who who had a
[1:16:44] healing ministry that was famous around
[1:16:46] the globe
[1:16:48] i mean he prayed for kings and
[1:16:49] congressmen
[1:16:51] amen and dignitaries he was renowned he
[1:16:53] was world famous brother branham
[1:16:56] preached meetings talk about big crowds
[1:16:57] brother brown preached meetings where
[1:16:59] tens of thousands of people came to the
[1:17:00] lord in one service
[1:17:03] that's where he had been that's a that
[1:17:05] had been the heights of his ministry
[1:17:07] and now where do you find him you find
[1:17:09] him in the backside of the desert in
[1:17:11] sierra vista arizona in a house
[1:17:13] with a little handful of people maybe
[1:17:15] less than we have here tonight
[1:17:18] amen
[1:17:19] and it really looks pretty grim
[1:17:21] looks like his ministry is declining to
[1:17:23] the point where it's like why not just
[1:17:24] quit
[1:17:26] but that's not
[1:17:28] that's not the example our elijah sets
[1:17:30] us amen and i just i i when i think
[1:17:33] about i i just can't get over it how
[1:17:35] he's sitting there and he's got every
[1:17:36] right to feel discouraged and he is
[1:17:38] feeling discouraged he is feeling you
[1:17:41] don't think so go listen to the evening
[1:17:42] messenger go listen to these sermons
[1:17:45] around that time that where that pain of
[1:17:46] rejection here he's in a little house in
[1:17:48] sierra vista you could count the number
[1:17:50] of churches in the whole state of
[1:17:52] arizona that would have him preaching
[1:17:53] their church on one hand
[1:17:56] amen and here's a man who's feeling the
[1:17:58] pain of that rejection an evening
[1:18:00] messenger he's talking about you know
[1:18:01] when it looks like the message and the
[1:18:02] messenger is just about defeated he said
[1:18:04] don't worry that's when god steps in
[1:18:06] but here's a man who under the opening
[1:18:09] of the word amen he's not discouraged
[1:18:12] he's a real hero of the faith he's he's
[1:18:14] set in an example of a human being that
[1:18:16] can feel discouraged but not let it
[1:18:18] change his confession
[1:18:20] because he's sitting there in sierra
[1:18:21] vista arizona he's not preaching defeat
[1:18:23] he's preaching victory day
[1:18:25] he's preaching the victory of the
[1:18:27] believer in christ he goes to sierra vs
[1:18:29] again he preaches the message shalom
[1:18:31] says don't worry about the darkness the
[1:18:33] light has come
[1:18:35] hallelujah he's resting on that how many
[1:18:38] times you know brother bram shared that
[1:18:40] story and over and over about you know
[1:18:41] oh you know i preach what paul preached
[1:18:43] and that there was that whole group of
[1:18:44] people said brother we're resting on
[1:18:46] that i was one of those people
[1:18:48] i was in that vision i'm resting on this
[1:18:50] message i'm resting on this word but to
[1:18:53] think that elijah's resting on me
[1:18:55] resting on his message
[1:18:58] because it was a comfort to brother
[1:18:59] branham to thank you know he's preaching
[1:19:01] i think it was in the seals he stops in
[1:19:03] the middle he says look you aren't even
[1:19:04] understanding what i'm preaching he's
[1:19:06] looking at a whole congregation of
[1:19:07] people just like
[1:19:09] but he said there's coming of people
[1:19:11] who he said you're not getting it but
[1:19:13] there's someone coming who will get it
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:16] amen and and here we are and brother
[1:19:18] ram's not even here to see it that we're
[1:19:20] here and we get it the holy spirit is
[1:19:22] revealing it the ministry has turned the
[1:19:24] corner into the opening of the word and
[1:19:26] these great revelations are being
[1:19:28] unlocked to the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:31] that was his rest
[1:19:33] to know that no brother brown you're not
[1:19:34] alone i've got seven thousand
[1:19:39] i've got a seventh age
[1:19:41] bride i've got oh i i i've got a people
[1:19:45] amen who are just like you they won't
[1:19:47] bow the knee to jezebel religion they
[1:19:49] won't bow the need to denominational
[1:19:51] spirits they'll never denominate they
[1:19:53] won't cut off god's revival
[1:19:55] they won't compromise on the word no
[1:19:57] they will believe
[1:19:59] they will rest their lives on what you
[1:20:01] preached
[1:20:04] sister of if brother branham and i know
[1:20:06] i'm a little jumbled up with this
[1:20:07] tonight just speaking from my heart if
[1:20:09] brother branham could take comfort in
[1:20:11] knowing
[1:20:12] that he wasn't alone in what he believed
[1:20:15] then surely there's some comfort in
[1:20:16] there for you and me to know that you're
[1:20:18] not the only one feeling the pain of
[1:20:20] rejection you're not the only one
[1:20:22] feeling lonely you're not the only one
[1:20:24] going through the struggles that you're
[1:20:26] going through to believe this message
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:31] to battling against this laodicean world
[1:20:33] you're not alone i'm not alone thanks be
[1:20:35] to god but there are men and women of
[1:20:38] like passions
[1:20:39] amen that can identify with where we're
[1:20:41] at
[1:20:43] that's how brother branham was a man of
[1:20:45] like passions
[1:20:46] he's very clear about it you know a lot
[1:20:48] of people just are not comfortable with
[1:20:50] the humanity of the prophet
[1:20:52] they don't like you to bring it up they
[1:20:53] don't like you to dwell on it don't like
[1:20:55] you to point it out but to me it's the
[1:20:56] most beautiful thing about this message
[1:20:59] is to look at the humanity of elijah and
[1:21:01] what god could do through our elijah in
[1:21:03] spite of that humanity
[1:21:05] when he says you know and standing in
[1:21:07] the gap he says could you imagine a
[1:21:08] person getting so indifferent he could
[1:21:10] almost walk up watch a blind man walk
[1:21:12] off a cliff and laugh
[1:21:14] he said that'd be a bad thing but he
[1:21:16] says to my brethren world over
[1:21:17] i want to make this confession
[1:21:20] i humbly say that's just about what i
[1:21:22] was doing
[1:21:23] wow
[1:21:25] don't just take this as fa don't just
[1:21:26] you know don't just let this go in one
[1:21:28] ear and out the other this is a man of
[1:21:30] like passions
[1:21:32] revealing his humanity to you it's part
[1:21:34] of the message it's not a side note
[1:21:37] it's not a it's not an auxiliary thing
[1:21:39] it's it's it's fundamental to this
[1:21:41] message
[1:21:42] a man who said i had a lot of hard
[1:21:44] battles he said maybe i'm scarred and
[1:21:46] all cut up on the inside from fights
[1:21:49] you and i know what it's like to be
[1:21:51] scarred because my lot that the lord
[1:21:53] gave me wasn't to kiss babies and marry
[1:21:55] the young and bury the old but it was to
[1:21:56] hold that two-handed sword on the battle
[1:21:57] of the front brother bam said i've been
[1:22:00] cut deep
[1:22:01] many times
[1:22:03] that's not a that's not a superficial
[1:22:05] statement
[1:22:06] there's a reality behind that
[1:22:09] you've been cut
[1:22:10] and it's not an imaginary thing
[1:22:13] you're going through battles you've got
[1:22:15] struggles
[1:22:16] you've been in trials and they're not
[1:22:18] they're not imaginary they're real
[1:22:21] the things that you're going through
[1:22:22] tonight are real the struggles in your
[1:22:25] life are real
[1:22:27] they're real
[1:22:30] and yet you know he battles on he sets
[1:22:33] the example what a hero to feel those
[1:22:35] same things and yet
[1:22:37] persist
[1:22:38] and yet carry this message forward
[1:22:41] oh friends
[1:22:42] it gives us hope to think that man a man
[1:22:45] could go through what brother branham
[1:22:46] went through
[1:22:47] to have very dear friends turn their
[1:22:49] back on him to just feel that pain and
[1:22:51] rejection and discouragement and watch
[1:22:53] his ministry diminish down to just
[1:22:55] handfuls
[1:22:57] and keep going
[1:22:59] then it means i could keep going you
[1:23:01] could keep going we could keep believing
[1:23:03] this thing he continues on and just just
[1:23:07] showing his very heart here and this is
[1:23:08] where i really relate to these things
[1:23:11] he says you know and i being a nervous
[1:23:13] neurotic type of person that i am and
[1:23:15] knowing that i was insufficient at the
[1:23:17] beginning
[1:23:20] you mean brother branham felt
[1:23:21] insufficient
[1:23:23] the guy that spoke storms out of
[1:23:24] existence and things
[1:23:26] yeah he felt insufficient
[1:23:28] for the job he says as many have
[1:23:30] complained
[1:23:32] that had to do it he said it was hard
[1:23:35] but i thought god why didn't you call
[1:23:38] somebody that could have done it
[1:23:41] that's our elijah
[1:23:43] that's our prophet saying god why didn't
[1:23:45] you call somebody that could have done
[1:23:46] it amen so when you find yourself in
[1:23:50] that very condition with the lord say
[1:23:52] god you should have called somebody else
[1:23:54] this message is not for me i love it but
[1:23:56] i can't live it
[1:23:58] amen this is too much for me lord this
[1:24:00] time it's really too much
[1:24:02] i just can't bear this
[1:24:04] i can't handle this trial that i'm oh my
[1:24:08] brother branham himself feels this way
[1:24:12] amen and yet carries on to the end a man
[1:24:15] of like passions
[1:24:16] amen you know that's how we feel
[1:24:19] sometimes like we just we're not enough
[1:24:21] like we don't belong we get that
[1:24:23] impostor syndrome you know where you
[1:24:25] just feel like well you know i i could
[1:24:27] put on a good front i'll do my best to
[1:24:29] just make sure everybody thinks i got it
[1:24:31] all you know got everything figured out
[1:24:33] and then you know but eventually
[1:24:36] they're gonna discover eventually
[1:24:37] they're gonna figure me out that i'm a
[1:24:39] fraud
[1:24:40] that i'm an imposter that i'm not i'm
[1:24:42] not whatever you know i think i think
[1:24:44] everybody else in the church brother
[1:24:45] nathan you know i think they're real
[1:24:47] christian people and they really you
[1:24:48] know this message really for them and
[1:24:50] but i'm just doing my best and i'm
[1:24:52] really going through some things and i'm
[1:24:54] trying not to let anybody see it
[1:24:56] you know but eventually the cover's
[1:24:57] gonna i'm gonna blow my cover i'm just
[1:24:59] gonna mess up for the last time and
[1:25:00] everybody's gonna figure me out and then
[1:25:02] they'll finally kick me out of church
[1:25:04] but that's how we feel
[1:25:06] that's how we act sometimes
[1:25:09] that's how you know on the natural side
[1:25:11] of it i battled that really hard in
[1:25:13] school it's kind of where the lord
[1:25:14] showed me this lesson you know because
[1:25:16] you know you get to a certain place
[1:25:18] where things get a little hard all of a
[1:25:20] sudden and
[1:25:21] you're up against some challenges and
[1:25:22] things and you're looking around at
[1:25:23] everybody else and saying it doesn't
[1:25:24] seem like everyone else is struggling
[1:25:27] so maybe i'm not supposed to be here
[1:25:28] maybe this isn't for me maybe i'm not
[1:25:30] who i thought i was
[1:25:32] well you go along long enough you find
[1:25:34] out everyone else is feeling the exact
[1:25:36] same way
[1:25:37] and in fact millions of people like when
[1:25:39] it comes to school you know you might
[1:25:41] struggle a little bit struggle with some
[1:25:42] classes and think oh boy there's just no
[1:25:44] way
[1:25:46] it's not me
[1:25:47] then you get to thinking i got to think
[1:25:48] of one day
[1:25:49] you know
[1:25:50] they've been sending people to school
[1:25:52] for a long time that means probably
[1:25:55] millions
[1:25:56] and millions of people in this world
[1:25:58] have stood have been in the exact
[1:26:00] position that i'm in felt exactly like
[1:26:02] i'm feeling
[1:26:04] and graduated anyway
[1:26:07] so if they could do it then probably i
[1:26:08] could do it too
[1:26:10] because i'm
[1:26:12] because i'm just a normal human person
[1:26:15] amen and on the spiritual side that's
[1:26:17] exactly what it is is to realize
[1:26:19] that what you're going through amen is
[1:26:22] like what i've gone through and like
[1:26:24] what another one has gone through and
[1:26:25] the people that we idolize
[1:26:27] went through that same thing
[1:26:29] it's not something it's not some new
[1:26:31] alien experience it's not you know
[1:26:33] you're not some special test tube case
[1:26:36] you know like i'm the first one that's
[1:26:37] ever had this trial so now we'll really
[1:26:39] find out if god is really enough for
[1:26:41] this
[1:26:42] you know because this is a this is a
[1:26:44] real this is a real original one brother
[1:26:46] nathan
[1:26:47] it's not that we're not that original
[1:26:50] we're not that unique amen you're not
[1:26:52] that special
[1:26:54] amen but but but that's how we are as
[1:26:56] human beings we just we just say oh you
[1:26:58] know
[1:26:59] nobody understands
[1:27:01] nobody's ever been and nobody can really
[1:27:03] relate to what i'm going through
[1:27:05] really
[1:27:07] hey man
[1:27:08] really
[1:27:10] but it's that that's just that human
[1:27:12] nature just like jacob wrestled with who
[1:27:14] he was
[1:27:15] jacob felt like a fraud here he's
[1:27:17] wrestling
[1:27:18] and struggling with himself and you
[1:27:20] think of all that jacob had to wrestle
[1:27:22] with or all that jacob had to be
[1:27:23] discouraged about jacob was a fraud it
[1:27:26] wasn't just feeling like a fraud he was
[1:27:27] a fraud he came
[1:27:29] he was born under the name of a fraud
[1:27:31] amen and his whole life his whole his
[1:27:34] whole status with the lord was built on
[1:27:36] a lie
[1:27:37] because he was a hypocrite he it was all
[1:27:39] it was a deception when isaac's hands
[1:27:41] got crossed it was always supposed to
[1:27:43] imagine living with the knowledge it was
[1:27:45] always supposed to be esau
[1:27:47] and that's how we live as christians we
[1:27:49] say ah it should have been this one it
[1:27:51] should have been that one god you should
[1:27:52] have chose someone else
[1:27:54] amen because here i'm a jacob and i'm
[1:27:56] i'm dealing with this first nature and
[1:27:58] this this humanity that i'm carrying
[1:28:00] around and i just think i'm a fraud
[1:28:02] and here jacob he's wrestling with that
[1:28:04] just just wrestling with that so much
[1:28:06] not knowing that it was going to be
[1:28:07] written in the scripture jacob have i
[1:28:09] loved and esau have i hated
[1:28:11] amen that's the way it is for you and i
[1:28:12] brother sister god's hands didn't get
[1:28:14] crossed up when he chose you he knew
[1:28:16] exactly what he was doing amen it wasn't
[1:28:18] a deception why because you've had a
[1:28:20] name change you're not jacob anymore
[1:28:22] you're israel
[1:28:24] what was a fraud what was a deceiver now
[1:28:26] it's called bless now it's called
[1:28:28] royalty
[1:28:29] amen that's it's a whole new thing amen
[1:28:33] but we still wrestle with that humanity
[1:28:35] but you know you go along in life long
[1:28:37] enough to gain a little bit of
[1:28:38] perspective and i was sharing this with
[1:28:40] some young people recently you know how
[1:28:42] that uh how that you know i i'm old
[1:28:44] enough now to to have the the benefit of
[1:28:47] perspective where you know there were a
[1:28:48] lot of esau's that i grew up with you
[1:28:51] know just front row christians young
[1:28:53] people you know that looked like they
[1:28:54] were on fire for god and had everything
[1:28:56] put together and were living you know
[1:28:58] lives of religious excellence people
[1:29:00] that you looked at and said they'll
[1:29:01] never be a problem
[1:29:03] that you'll never have to worry about
[1:29:04] that one
[1:29:05] amen then you you go along in life a
[1:29:07] little bit and some of those esau's not
[1:29:10] here anymore
[1:29:12] some are out in the world some of them
[1:29:13] are atheists some of them just living
[1:29:14] lives as filthy as they could be but you
[1:29:17] thought they were an esau
[1:29:18] but then you talk about some jacobs
[1:29:21] some people you never would have held
[1:29:22] out hope for
[1:29:23] some people that you would have just
[1:29:24] written off people that had no advantage
[1:29:26] in their life no no reason to serve the
[1:29:28] lord nothing really to stand on no home
[1:29:30] life no good church no not under good
[1:29:33] ministry or whatever the situation was
[1:29:35] and now you look at their lives today
[1:29:36] they're the strongest ones in the church
[1:29:38] amen what is it jacob i loved esau have
[1:29:41] i hated it's what god can do in humanity
[1:29:44] doesn't matter the quality of the
[1:29:45] humanity but it's his deity amen can
[1:29:48] overcome the humanity
[1:29:50] his choosing his election his grace the
[1:29:53] law of the seed
[1:29:54] is able to overcome these things friends
[1:29:58] so we wrestle and wrestle but eventually
[1:30:00] you've got to stop wrestling just let
[1:30:01] the lord touch your life and it changes
[1:30:04] your walk changes your confession
[1:30:06] changes your attitude
[1:30:08] the way that you talk about yourself
[1:30:10] amen
[1:30:11] god didn't get crossed up when he chose
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:14] he knew exactly
[1:30:16] what he was doing he's going to take you
[1:30:17] and multiply you
[1:30:19] like jacob like israel he'll multiply
[1:30:21] you he'll use you to fulfill his promise
[1:30:23] he'll do things in your life you didn't
[1:30:25] even know were possible
[1:30:27] some of you lived a full life you're in
[1:30:29] your late middle age
[1:30:30] or or an elderly person there could be
[1:30:33] things just around the corner in your
[1:30:34] life potentials that are in you that
[1:30:36] have not been unlocked and you just be
[1:30:38] amazed what god can do with you with
[1:30:40] just a more greater surrender
[1:30:42] more of our humanity laid down
[1:30:44] it's never over
[1:30:47] it's never it's it never stops it's a
[1:30:49] god that just multiplies and multiplies
[1:30:53] and uses his people uses human beings
[1:30:56] brother brahm said we know we make
[1:30:57] mistakes
[1:30:59] but you mustn't look at that this is one
[1:31:01] of my favorite this is my life quote
[1:31:03] really
[1:31:04] you mustn't look at that
[1:31:07] it's not your mistakes because you're
[1:31:10] always going to have them
[1:31:12] i don't know about you but when i read
[1:31:14] that quote a little something just goes
[1:31:18] it's not compromise it's grace
[1:31:22] knowing that you'll always have mistakes
[1:31:26] because your idea i know your idea is
[1:31:27] the same as my idea and our
[1:31:29] religiousness that you know we got to
[1:31:30] come to a place where we live such great
[1:31:33] super spiritual lives until it's been 20
[1:31:36] years since the last time you messed up
[1:31:39] you haven't made a mistake you can't
[1:31:40] remember the last time you made a
[1:31:41] mistake
[1:31:43] no brother brown said you're always
[1:31:45] going to have them
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:49] another thing i've shared with the young
[1:31:50] people you know
[1:31:51] is that you know there is a balance
[1:31:53] between law and grace because some
[1:31:55] people go so far out on grace they turn
[1:31:57] it into a disgrace
[1:31:58] we know that there has to be a life you
[1:32:00] know behind the name there there's got
[1:32:02] to be a you know
[1:32:03] if you're a seed it'll manifest itself
[1:32:05] with a christian life and christian
[1:32:06] character we know all those things so we
[1:32:08] know there's a balance between law and
[1:32:10] grace but i'll tell you this and i know
[1:32:12] that i've preached you here before amen
[1:32:13] if you want to find that balance you've
[1:32:15] got to start with grace because if you
[1:32:16] don't start with grace you'll never
[1:32:18] achieve the balance
[1:32:19] amen you've got to start with grace amen
[1:32:22] that's what this quote is telling you
[1:32:23] it's not your mistakes because you're
[1:32:25] always going to have them stumbling and
[1:32:27] falling doesn't have one thing to do
[1:32:28] with it
[1:32:30] a real servant if he stumbles he gets
[1:32:32] back up if he wobbles god pulls him
[1:32:34] right back in the path
[1:32:35] he said god's obligated to him and
[1:32:37] here's the beautiful words knowing that
[1:32:40] he's just a man or a woman
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:46] amen
[1:32:47] that's what we're preaching tonight he
[1:32:49] knows you're just a man
[1:32:52] or a woman
[1:32:53] he understands those like passions
[1:32:56] but he's obligated to that person as
[1:32:58] long as they're in the path of duty
[1:33:01] what a beautiful quote
[1:33:03] so that's why if you stumble
[1:33:06] don't get out in the ditch you know and
[1:33:07] throw yourself a pity party and say well
[1:33:09] god you should have chose somebody else
[1:33:10] it was never for me anyway
[1:33:12] no you get back up
[1:33:14] and you stay in the path of duty
[1:33:17] stay in the path of duty
[1:33:18] a lot of times you know the real devil
[1:33:20] that gets you down you know the devil
[1:33:21] trip you up on temper or on lust or on
[1:33:24] some something you know he'll come in
[1:33:26] your life and and that that devil will
[1:33:27] trip you up for a moment but then
[1:33:29] condemnation moves in
[1:33:30] and condemnation don't get in a hurry
[1:33:32] condemnation will stay there for a week
[1:33:33] or a month or until you kick it out
[1:33:36] condemnation nation will come on the
[1:33:38] heel that mistake and condemnation is
[1:33:40] the real one that will put his foot on
[1:33:42] your neck and grind you into the dirt
[1:33:43] and amen and just keep you there where
[1:33:46] that failure happened but you don't have
[1:33:48] to stay under condemnation
[1:33:50] you don't have to carry it
[1:33:52] not for one step past a genuine
[1:33:55] repentance but godly sorrow brings you
[1:33:57] to a repentance and repentance takes you
[1:33:59] to salvation not to be repented of
[1:34:01] not to be sorry anymore but to get back
[1:34:04] up in the path of duty and keep walking
[1:34:06] and god's obligated to you in that path
[1:34:08] because he knows you're just a man or a
[1:34:10] woman
[1:34:11] so a man or a woman that'll keep going
[1:34:13] with god
[1:34:14] in spite of their humanity in spite of
[1:34:16] their mistakes and knowing that
[1:34:18] stumbling falling don't have one thing
[1:34:19] to do with it god is obligated to that
[1:34:21] person
[1:34:22] god's not obligated to a person who can
[1:34:24] climb up to some spiritual super state
[1:34:27] of existence where they're living a life
[1:34:29] of sinless perfection what a lie that
[1:34:32] that image is
[1:34:34] but it's someone who will walk in grace
[1:34:36] who will take the blood that was shed
[1:34:38] for them who will walk out under the
[1:34:40] under under the forgiveness of sins
[1:34:42] under the under the justification of the
[1:34:45] bride
[1:34:46] will identify themselves with christ and
[1:34:48] stay in that path of duty
[1:34:50] duty will take you where your emotions
[1:34:52] fail
[1:34:53] amen there's places in your life you
[1:34:55] know the emotions not there the real
[1:34:57] zeal the real passion just that human
[1:34:59] passion fails you
[1:35:01] maybe tonight you know you had such a
[1:35:02] rough day at work you didn't even feel
[1:35:04] like going to church
[1:35:06] but you stayed in the path of duty and
[1:35:08] duty took you to church even when your
[1:35:10] attitude was rotten
[1:35:11] and god's obligated to you there
[1:35:14] that's why he's speaking to you tonight
[1:35:17] amen oh my
[1:35:19] amen stumbling and falling don't have
[1:35:21] one thing to do with it you say brother
[1:35:23] nathan i got failures i do too so let's
[1:35:25] fail forward
[1:35:27] fail forward just keep going
[1:35:30] because we've got a future
[1:35:33] we've got a future you know we think of
[1:35:35] that many times we just we just look in
[1:35:36] the past you take peter you know when we
[1:35:39] look at peter we read the book of first
[1:35:40] peter ii peter we see that beautiful
[1:35:42] picture of a pastor of the church
[1:35:44] an elder a leader a bishop you know and
[1:35:46] this great just this loving man this
[1:35:48] gentle soul talking about love and
[1:35:51] character and
[1:35:52] you know the stature of a perfect man
[1:35:53] all those things and and you know and
[1:35:55] here's peter you know he was he was had
[1:35:58] so much power in his life that he would
[1:36:00] walk down the street and his shadow
[1:36:02] would cast over people and people would
[1:36:04] be healed just by just by coming into
[1:36:06] contact with his shadow
[1:36:08] you say oh wow that's a real that's a
[1:36:11] real christian life but what about back
[1:36:13] when he was in a boat somewhere cussing
[1:36:15] and
[1:36:16] and and and being irreverent with a
[1:36:18] temper what about when he was cutting an
[1:36:19] ear off and what about all the times
[1:36:21] jesus had to shake his head and say oh
[1:36:23] peter you know what about what about all
[1:36:25] the what about in the back room where he
[1:36:27] just couldn't quite see peter uh paul he
[1:36:30] just didn't quite have paul figured out
[1:36:32] and they were having a real you know
[1:36:34] moment of intense fellowship in a back
[1:36:36] room somewhere in jerusalem what about
[1:36:38] all those times of his life
[1:36:40] you can't just look at peter at the very
[1:36:42] end when he's come to the capstone of
[1:36:44] his ministry and say oh that's a real
[1:36:46] christian
[1:36:47] but but but what about the god that took
[1:36:50] peter
[1:36:51] from the boat
[1:36:52] amen to the pulpit
[1:36:54] what about all that in between what
[1:36:56] about all that human life friends you
[1:36:58] can't throw peter out based on his
[1:37:00] mistakes
[1:37:01] because he had a future
[1:37:03] and i'm telling you you've got a future
[1:37:05] so don't throw this humanity out don't
[1:37:07] throw these because of these like
[1:37:09] passions don't just give up and say god
[1:37:11] it must not be for me
[1:37:14] no it's the same god that was with them
[1:37:18] is with you is with me keep waiting for
[1:37:20] that key amen keep waiting for the key
[1:37:24] you know wherever you're at in your life
[1:37:26] there's men and women men and
[1:37:28] women of god that are living overcoming
[1:37:30] lives today and they know exactly where
[1:37:31] you're at
[1:37:33] exactly where you're at they've been
[1:37:34] exactly where you're at friends amen you
[1:37:37] think preachers don't struggle with
[1:37:38] things
[1:37:40] oh you know preachers but preachers
[1:37:41] don't have fear
[1:37:43] preachers don't worry
[1:37:45] you know preachers don't have anxiety
[1:37:47] and complexes and things like that
[1:37:49] yeah i wish
[1:37:51] you know we named our we named our
[1:37:53] little girl her middle name is juniper
[1:37:55] there's a reason for that
[1:37:57] because we all get under that juniper
[1:37:59] tree
[1:38:00] and we all get a little dramatic with
[1:38:01] the lord
[1:38:02] and we all get to place we say god just
[1:38:04] just take me this is too much
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:08] you know
[1:38:10] there are people that can understand
[1:38:12] people that have been there
[1:38:14] you look at somebody whose life you're
[1:38:16] intimidated by you know as a young
[1:38:18] christian we get intimidated by
[1:38:19] christians because they're living a life
[1:38:20] that feels so far beyond where we're at
[1:38:24] but if you just you ever work up the
[1:38:25] courage say brother i'm dealing with
[1:38:26] this
[1:38:27] sister i'm dealing with this would you
[1:38:28] pray for me you'll find out they got
[1:38:30] something in their past they'll they've
[1:38:32] been right where you're at
[1:38:34] you talk about oh you say well you know
[1:38:36] but but but but i got this thing in my
[1:38:38] past you know and you know other people
[1:38:41] you know i've been through some really
[1:38:43] rough things that most people most
[1:38:44] people don't understand they can't
[1:38:46] relate to they've never been there you
[1:38:47] know and i just i'm carrying all this
[1:38:50] baggage from my past and you think
[1:38:51] brother branham didn't understand that
[1:38:54] you know brother brandon back in the 19
[1:38:56] it was the 1930s i think he made a very
[1:38:58] horrible mistake he instead of listening
[1:39:00] to what the lord was directly leading
[1:39:02] him to do he listened to his
[1:39:03] mother-in-law right
[1:39:04] and he paid a horrible price he had to
[1:39:06] he had to sit there in a hospital and
[1:39:08] watch his wife pass away
[1:39:10] watch his little baby with those little
[1:39:12] baby eyes crossing with the pain
[1:39:15] that she was suffering before the lord
[1:39:17] took her
[1:39:18] that was a horrible thing a horrible
[1:39:19] price that he paid that happened back in
[1:39:21] the 1930s
[1:39:23] brother branham was still bringing it up
[1:39:25] in the 60s
[1:39:26] brother ray was just preaching on this
[1:39:27] recently it just struck me so much here
[1:39:29] brother brown you think it didn't bother
[1:39:31] him you think he didn't keep him up late
[1:39:33] at night
[1:39:34] many times and you know he this is a man
[1:39:37] who understands what it is to to have
[1:39:40] something in your past and you feel like
[1:39:41] you just can't get over it you're not
[1:39:43] alone in that brother branham knew what
[1:39:45] that was
[1:39:47] he knew what it was to struggle with the
[1:39:49] he knew what it was you know close his
[1:39:51] eyes probably and see his little baby's
[1:39:53] face because of his mistake
[1:39:56] it's a man who could understand that but
[1:39:58] you know what
[1:39:59] from that day every little cross-eyed
[1:40:01] baby brother brandon prayed for was made
[1:40:03] whole
[1:40:04] you see the power of like passions we
[1:40:07] think that god can only magnify our
[1:40:08] successes and god can only multiply our
[1:40:11] victories but god can take your mistakes
[1:40:14] he can take your your failures he could
[1:40:16] take the moments where you were too low
[1:40:18] where you failed the lord god can take
[1:40:20] that and turn it around into a victory
[1:40:23] that's the kind of god i serve that's
[1:40:25] the grace of god that's where the
[1:40:27] fervent prayer of a righteous man comes
[1:40:30] from because when a righteous man kneels
[1:40:32] down to pray for a brother he can relate
[1:40:35] to what that brother's going through
[1:40:37] because it's a because it's a man that's
[1:40:38] been through some things and that that
[1:40:40] becomes the fervency behind the
[1:40:42] effectual prayer
[1:40:44] that's why we still believe in prayer
[1:40:46] lines that's why we call one and up we
[1:40:48] call one another up and and pray for one
[1:40:50] another and we don't just call every we
[1:40:52] don't just call up to heaven for
[1:40:53] everything we have need of we pray for
[1:40:55] one another why because you can get in
[1:40:57] that channel of compassion yeah amen and
[1:41:00] you say oh that brother's gotta he's got
[1:41:02] back problems and i've been through some
[1:41:04] real back problems that brother's going
[1:41:06] through a family situation i've been
[1:41:07] through a real familiar situation
[1:41:10] so i can feel for that brother
[1:41:13] and god can work through things the
[1:41:15] places where you messed up the places
[1:41:16] where you failed god those places that
[1:41:19] you thought you thought god how could
[1:41:20] you ever make something beautiful out of
[1:41:22] this god can
[1:41:23] he can make all things beautiful in his
[1:41:25] time
[1:41:26] he can turn it around and he can use
[1:41:28] that to give you a burden for someone
[1:41:30] else
[1:41:31] and he can do great works of deliverance
[1:41:34] through through your baggage
[1:41:37] to york
[1:41:38] because he knows how to use human beings
[1:41:41] he's no stranger to like passions
[1:41:44] no stranger to humanity he's an expert
[1:41:47] in taking flawed humanity
[1:41:50] and doing supernatural things
[1:41:52] taking our natural you know just our
[1:41:54] natural demeanor and doing the
[1:41:56] supernatural
[1:41:58] that's what god specializes in
[1:42:01] glory be to god that's how brother
[1:42:02] branham operated how many times do you
[1:42:04] know like when the blind man came to him
[1:42:06] in mexico
[1:42:07] you know and he stood there and he
[1:42:09] didn't just you know he didn't just act
[1:42:11] pentecostal and jump off the platform
[1:42:12] and slap him on the forehead and start
[1:42:14] screaming
[1:42:15] no he stands there
[1:42:17] he begins a fellowship
[1:42:19] with the humanity of this blind man
[1:42:22] he begins to say oh you know
[1:42:24] he must be going through some cold
[1:42:25] nights i wonder if my jacket would fit
[1:42:28] him
[1:42:29] because i know that he's poor
[1:42:31] and his and he's and he's he's he's
[1:42:33] spending nights in the cold
[1:42:35] oh you know his feet he must be walking
[1:42:37] everywhere that he goes he must be in he
[1:42:39] must have pain he must he must be
[1:42:41] suffering
[1:42:42] i wonder if my shoes would fit him
[1:42:44] see how brother brahms slows down and
[1:42:46] just takes the time to enter in
[1:42:49] by compassion enter into those like
[1:42:51] passions
[1:42:53] that fellow human experience
[1:42:56] that that that that similar humanity
[1:42:59] he begins to open up a channel there
[1:43:02] brother braham says where divine love
[1:43:05] where divine love is extended sovereign
[1:43:07] grace comes in
[1:43:09] you know that you you know the teaching
[1:43:11] that's how he would operate he'd take
[1:43:12] somebody in the prayer line you know he
[1:43:14] wouldn't just pray for them sometimes
[1:43:15] but the holy spirit would take him all
[1:43:16] the way back say you know when you were
[1:43:18] a little girl you were in a car accident
[1:43:20] now you've got this nervous condition
[1:43:21] but it goes all the way back to that
[1:43:22] trauma that you have in your past
[1:43:25] god understands your trauma
[1:43:28] and a brother or sister you know that
[1:43:29] you can open up to and they can
[1:43:31] understand you that that same compassion
[1:43:33] can begin to build god can do the
[1:43:35] supernatural through that
[1:43:37] the fervent effectual prayer of a
[1:43:39] righteous man the beauty of it is it's
[1:43:41] it's a man of like passions it's another
[1:43:43] human being they're proud they got
[1:43:45] problems just like you got problems
[1:43:47] they've got a history they've got a pass
[1:43:49] just like you've got to pass they've got
[1:43:50] baggage they've got trauma just like
[1:43:52] you've got trauma
[1:43:54] and yet this mighty god can take
[1:43:57] take this flawed humanity
[1:43:59] amen and open up that channel
[1:44:02] of compassion and do the supernatural in
[1:44:04] one another's life i think it's
[1:44:06] beautiful friends
[1:44:07] i i i apologize if it's just too simple
[1:44:10] tonight but to me it's such a beautiful
[1:44:12] thing to be a brother a sister to be a
[1:44:14] man or a woman of like passions to to be
[1:44:16] a human being living under heaven
[1:44:19] and live in this experience that we're
[1:44:20] living as sons and daughters of god
[1:44:22] having compassion one for another
[1:44:24] understanding one another relating to
[1:44:26] one another you know if we would operate
[1:44:28] in that channel of understanding more
[1:44:30] often we wouldn't see church splits we
[1:44:31] wouldn't see drama we wouldn't see all
[1:44:33] the problems that we've seen if people
[1:44:34] would stop
[1:44:36] and say well that brother you know
[1:44:38] what is it that makes him that way
[1:44:40] that sister you know that's given me a
[1:44:42] hard time what is it back in her past
[1:44:45] that caused it to be like this
[1:44:48] brother brandon i was just listening to
[1:44:50] quote
[1:44:51] earlier today
[1:44:52] in the great commission he says you know
[1:44:54] if you want to be a blessing and and get
[1:44:56] a blessing he said when a man's done you
[1:44:58] wrong
[1:44:58] he's a in other words like not a not a
[1:45:01] misunderstanding or something as
[1:45:02] somebody actually
[1:45:04] just did you wrong he did you evil he
[1:45:07] said don't you mention that
[1:45:08] he said you take that brother to the
[1:45:10] throne of god her sister he said you
[1:45:12] stand shoulder to shoulder with them in
[1:45:14] the presence of god and say god you know
[1:45:16] here my brother's done me wrong he's
[1:45:18] absolutely done me wrong
[1:45:21] and he said but you begin to you begin
[1:45:22] just pray for that person and he said
[1:45:25] god will let you see
[1:45:27] what he's been through
[1:45:30] and he said you know and before long
[1:45:32] you'll start feeling sorry for that man
[1:45:34] and he said when you get down to earth
[1:45:36] again
[1:45:37] oh my you'll just stand shoulder to
[1:45:39] shoulder
[1:45:40] he said there's no mortal can stand in
[1:45:41] the presence of god and condemn another
[1:45:43] mortal
[1:45:44] amen if you really know what it is to
[1:45:46] carry these human these the the weights
[1:45:48] of this humanity when you've been
[1:45:50] through the struggles of a human being
[1:45:51] trying to live for god friends how could
[1:45:53] we come into the presence of god and
[1:45:54] condemn someone else who's going through
[1:45:56] the same experience
[1:45:58] but but god is a god who can let us
[1:46:01] understand one another and could fix all
[1:46:03] the problems
[1:46:05] can just cover over all the love can
[1:46:07] cover a multitude of sins
[1:46:09] if oh my when we just wake up to the
[1:46:11] fact that we're all men and women of
[1:46:13] like passions
[1:46:15] just normal flesh and blood
[1:46:18] beautiful amen
[1:46:20] the fervent prayer
[1:46:22] comes from that
[1:46:24] he knows you're just a man or a woman
[1:46:26] he knows
[1:46:28] you're just a man or a woman could i
[1:46:30] have a few more minutes
[1:46:32] you know when he called philip you know
[1:46:34] brother brahms talking about he said
[1:46:35] behold an israelite whom there's no
[1:46:37] guile he said that's the way that god is
[1:46:39] he knows you
[1:46:41] he knows what you are
[1:46:43] he knows what you're made out of he
[1:46:45] understands you
[1:46:48] hallelujah
[1:46:50] hallelujah he understands you
[1:46:53] in the patmos vision he's talking about
[1:46:55] you know there in revelation 10 you know
[1:46:57] that that white wigged one with the
[1:46:58] flaming eyes of judgment you know he's
[1:47:00] talking about this great judge this
[1:47:02] great you know uh uh what the revival
[1:47:05] should call it you know the angry god
[1:47:06] like sinners in the hands of an angry
[1:47:08] god god the judge

[1:47:14] who who who brings the final verdict
[1:47:16] over humanity you know this the judge
[1:47:20] but he said i want you to notice
[1:47:21] something about those eyes those flaming
[1:47:23] eyes he says when he was on earth
[1:47:26] they were dim with tears like a man
[1:47:31] those eyes that we see flaming in
[1:47:32] judgment but
[1:47:34] those eyes were once on earth they were
[1:47:35] deemed with tears like a man before he
[1:47:37] cried at the grave of lazarus
[1:47:40] he's full of sympathy
[1:47:42] he was god clothed in humanity but
[1:47:44] behind that humanity brother brahm said
[1:47:46] he had something behind him that could
[1:47:47] look right down into the heart of a man
[1:47:49] and know all about him
[1:47:52] friends it's not eyes of judgment
[1:47:54] burning over you
[1:47:57] it's a god who not only loves but he
[1:48:00] understands
[1:48:01] he understands
[1:48:03] he's the sympathizing jesus
[1:48:05] he knows where you are why because he
[1:48:07] chose to pitch his tent with us
[1:48:10] and be a human being
[1:48:12] jesus is a man of like passions
[1:48:14] jesus felt the pain of hunger brother
[1:48:17] braham said he he couldn't suffer in
[1:48:19] spirit he had to become flesh to feel
[1:48:21] the pain of sickness to feel the
[1:48:22] temptation of lust he felt the
[1:48:24] temptation of want the temptation of
[1:48:26] hunger and he felt the power of death
[1:48:29] and he said and jesus took that to make
[1:48:31] intercession for us for he knows how it
[1:48:34] feels
[1:48:36] a kinsmen redeemer who knows how it
[1:48:39] feels he said when you get sick he knows
[1:48:41] how you feel when you're tempted he
[1:48:43] knows how you feel he knows how you feel
[1:48:48] to think you know this is something that
[1:48:50] you know growing up at church didn't
[1:48:51] teach me this was never revealed to me
[1:48:53] till later in life
[1:48:55] you know it just it just still just
[1:48:56] opened up to me one day that that man
[1:48:58] that walked up calvary's hill
[1:49:01] you know that jesus that took that cross
[1:49:04] you know and felt that pain felt the
[1:49:06] crack of that whip
[1:49:07] that was beaten was bloodied

[1:49:12] stumbling up that hill under that great
[1:49:14] weight
[1:49:15] finding out knowing understanding what
[1:49:17] it is to carry a burden
[1:49:19] be weighed down
[1:49:21] that one who would see people who were
[1:49:23] his precious friends dear friends would
[1:49:26] turn their eyes and pretend they didn't
[1:49:28] know him or even spit in his face
[1:49:31] understand he understands rejection he
[1:49:33] understands pain
[1:49:35] understands the burden he understands it
[1:49:38] and that god you know
[1:49:40] that carried that cross up that hill
[1:49:42] that wasn't god came and made a little
[1:49:44] puppet out of flesh and walked it up
[1:49:46] calvary's hill and hung it on a tree
[1:49:48] that was god
[1:49:50] who became flesh
[1:49:52] so god felt the crack of the whip
[1:49:55] god felt the blood running down his brow
[1:49:57] god felt the weight of the cross god
[1:49:59] felt the pain of rejection god cried out
[1:50:01] said why
[1:50:03] why

[1:50:27] when you're discouraged
[1:50:30] that's when the devil can really pour it
[1:50:32] on you
[1:50:34] but when you can cast that aside he said
[1:50:36] god doesn't want you to be frowning god
[1:50:38] wants you to be happy
[1:50:40] the human heart was made to be happy why
[1:50:43] because god made that human heart he
[1:50:44] knows what it is to be sad he doesn't
[1:50:46] want you to be sad
[1:50:47] he doesn't want you to be under your
[1:50:49] christian life to be a great burden
[1:50:51] he doesn't want you to be weighed down
[1:50:53] with all these things it's a god that
[1:50:55] understands he said you come unto me my
[1:50:57] burdens light my yoke is easy i'll give
