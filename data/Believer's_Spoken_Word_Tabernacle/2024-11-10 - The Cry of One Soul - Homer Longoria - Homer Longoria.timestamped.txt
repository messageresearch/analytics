[24:34] morning everyone God bless you um I've
[24:36] enjoyed many blessings from the company
[24:38] that I'm with and um I believe by divine
[24:41] intervention by God because I had f with
[24:44] working and everything else that I can't
[24:45] find no success nowhere and just as I
[24:48] gave up uh the job came to me almost
[24:51] like a whim so I went there and and I
[24:54] got there I said well I was just through
[24:55] an agency and after like a month or two
[24:57] working the bosses said we needed
[24:59] someone so they quickly bought my time
[25:01] out from the agency and took me in and
[25:03] they came to me the the my boss says I
[25:05] don't have a spot for you he said I'm
[25:07] going to make one wow and so then he
[25:09] went he he went to the plant manager he
[25:11] came he showed me around and says I we
[25:13] don't have a spot I'm going to create
[25:14] one for you so okay so then his boss is
[25:17] the owner so he went to them and uh
[25:19] through God's intervention I was able to
[25:20] land the job shortly last month eight
[25:23] years and so there's been many blessings
[25:25] that God has G me favor with the bosses
[25:27] and with the employees so it's gone
[25:29] really well for me and um I'm sure the
[25:31] maintenance has been uh I've always
[25:33] bothered him for many many things in
[25:35] this couple few days ago was not
[25:37] anything different the machine I've been
[25:39] praying for is a tape dispenser instead
[25:40] of doing manually I asked for electronic
[25:43] one so they they went on purchased two
[25:44] of them one for me from a person I work
[25:46] with it's a lot faster and so I had some
[25:48] issues with it so I asked him said well
[25:50] this is what's going on with it now can
[25:52] you take a look at it yeah I'll take
[25:53] care of it so he came back and fixed it
[25:55] and now works just like it was brand new
[25:57] and I gave God thanks I said thank you
[25:58] Lord for all your help and assistance in
[26:00] this little job that I have and so on
[26:03] the way to church
[26:05] Friday in my heart it dropped it says
[26:08] about the way things are the way they're
[26:10] going and as I I bound the little Hill
[26:12] came up but the spirit told me and says
[26:14] but how can Israel be in her place the
[26:16] way she is and the things you've heard
[26:18] how can they be so vividly explained as
[26:20] they are now and where we're standing in
[26:22] the way things are going and so we're
[26:24] heading on that path where God has Chen
[26:26] and taken us how Israel in the world

[41:45] Lord and so uh well I don't want to take
[41:49] any any time away from the word of God
[41:51] we were our hearts were so edified here
[41:54] on Friday
[41:55] night and um yes sir you know sometimes
[41:58] we you know you come away from a service
[42:01] and you know it's just it's so precious
[42:03] to just be able to meditate on the
[42:05] things of God and what God was saying
[42:07] because there's so many times that
[42:09] there's things that the Lord is is
[42:11] saying and and we it's never based on
[42:14] our um our our mind to be able to
[42:18] capture everything but just to meditate
[42:20] on the things that has been said things
[42:23] that struck our heart and I think of the
[42:25] scripture and how the the Holy Spirit
[42:27] took that on on Friday night and how
[42:32] they had toiled all night and there's a
[42:36] lot of things you know that we have
[42:38] that's tried to be done to
[42:40] toil brother brandham spoke of that over
[42:42] and over he said sometimes where he says
[42:44] a man can see somebody do something and
[42:47] say I can do that or I remember in when
[42:50] God begin to deal with my heart I
[42:54] thought I could do it I thought I could
[42:57] do it and and you know and you know God
[43:00] let me just say it like this God allows
[43:03] it shows that within it it's not based
[43:05] on our human strength our intellect
[43:08] right and when we can come to that spot
[43:09] to say you know what I'm tired yeah true
[43:13] I'm tired I mean a person who's drowning
[43:16] you know you come to a spot to say I'm
[43:19] tired I'm tired and I never forget as it
[43:22] comes to my heart right now I never
[43:24] forget there in brother Bill's basement
[43:26] that morning and that was what rang in
[43:28] my heart I said I'm tired Glory I
[43:31] couldn't get out of situations I was in
[43:33] I couldn't stop things that I was doing
[43:36] I I couldn't I couldn't do that and I
[43:38] realized that I had come to that but you
[43:40] know even in that I realized that even
[43:42] after God took a hold of my life and
[43:44] what he's done in my life and he did
[43:46] something that nobody no book no anyone
[43:48] could ever do but he came in that that's
[43:52] all that that's all that matters he
[43:53] comes in
[43:57] and I think that's the same
[43:59] way for every need that I've ever had in
[44:02] my life even since that
[44:04] time sometimes we've toiled to make
[44:07] things happen and toiled we felt like
[44:09] this this needs to be done but you
[44:11] know everything has to be in God's
[44:14] time and God is Sovereign yes he is God
[44:18] is Sovereign and the greatest thing that
[44:20] what I've learned is God so conditioned
[44:23] my heart to be sensitive to receive you
[44:27] to recognize you as you're
[44:30] moving that's what I want to be I want
[44:32] to be in that place to where when he's
[44:34] moving and and that's what I think about
[44:35] in this service right here today is God
[44:38] condition our hearts because when the
[44:40] water's troubled I I want to step
[44:42] in I want to step in you know the man
[44:46] who had the the condition brother Bram
[44:48] told us brother Bram actually told us in
[44:50] the message the man could walk right so
[44:53] it wasn't sometimes how things are
[44:54] projected and things on movies and
[44:56] things like that the man could actually
[44:58] walk brother bam said he could have
[45:00] walked but he said notice brother Ram
[45:01] said notice he could walk but he said
[45:03] what it was cuz he said every time I go
[45:05] to get there somebody steps in front of
[45:10] me we thought it was we thought just
[45:12] reading looking at he was helpless he he
[45:14] had to crawl he didn't have to crawl
[45:16] brother BR said he could
[45:17] walk amen but somebody stepped in front
[45:20] of me but you know what God has a has a
[45:23] Divine appointment with every one of us
[45:25] this morning
[45:27] I pray God would help us to just lay
[45:29] aside the cares of the life cuz we can't
[45:31] solve them anyhow God give us Grace to
[45:34] step aside from tiredness and weariness
[45:36] of mind or flesh and let's just enter in
[45:38] let's just enter in this morning and
[45:40] just pull on the gift of God it's such a
[45:43] such a privilege and an honor and I

[50:04] don't have to
[50:05] question that you got the word of God
[50:08] you know and you know and I I was raised
[50:10] in church all my life just about it you
[50:12] know and and uh you know and so we had
[50:16] this Doctrine and we had this and and I
[50:18] said you know and it's strange how that
[50:21] God Amen he he he opened our eyes amen
[50:26] and and and he enlightened
[50:28] us amen with what he wanted us to
[50:32] have you know this is not what I wanted
[50:36] it's not what you wanted because your
[50:38] whole nature is contrary to it amen amen
[50:42] your whole nature is an enemy to God
[50:44] Amen and can you say Amen sir amen but
[50:48] there was part of me and part of you
[50:51] amen that God was looking at amen you
[50:54] say amen that's the reason I said last
[50:56] night God had this thing
[50:59] rigged we call it
[51:01] predestination for knowledge but God
[51:03] rigged this
[51:05] thing he he amen you wouldn't come on
[51:07] your
[51:08] own he had to come looking for
[51:12] me sir amen and I didn't come just
[51:16] willingly all right amen Jas Jas didn't
[51:19] just come willingly it was a forced
[51:23] issue I'm going preach anyhow on
[51:27] amen so it's a forced issue God forced
[51:31] an issue over J us according to brother
[51:34] bam is that right now I'm going to say
[51:36] brother bam a
[51:38] [Applause]
[51:41] lot amen so I'm not going to worry if
[51:44] you don't like it or not I'm real
[51:47] humbled okay I'm a humble
[51:49] person but I want you to know amen you
[51:52] don't have nothing outside of this
[51:54] message
[51:57] amen Hey listen I read about Paul but I
[52:00] can tell you about brother
[52:04] bham I can amen I read the history of
[52:07] Paul and amen and never knew what Paul
[52:10] was talking about right that's why I was
[52:12] a
[52:13] trinitarian amen because we had no
[52:17] Revelation amen you say oh but my we
[52:21] Pentecostals had it no you didn't no you
[52:24] baptized under regeneration right all
[52:27] right true that's right amen amen so
[52:31] therefore it took this the light of this
[52:35] amen amen to show us what this
[52:39] was you say
[52:41] Amen if you want to look with me this
[52:44] this morning at Mark I don't know if
[52:46] it's evening or
[52:47] morning amen if you want to look at Mark
[52:49] chapter 5 amen and I want to share with
[52:53] you amen and if you ever heard me preach
[52:56] on this before play like you hadn't
[52:59] that's what John le Fontaine used to say
[53:01] amen he said play like you never heard
[53:03] this
[53:04] before amen amen so amen but it just
[53:09] seemed like I couldn't get away from it
[53:11] amen so I'm going to deal with it this
[53:13] morning
[53:14] amen and so we find out this morning in
[53:17] the scripture amen and the Bible said
[53:20] and they came over unto the other side
[53:22] of the Sea of gines and when he was come
[53:25] out of the ship he immediately
[53:27] there excuse me immediately there met
[53:30] him out of the tombs a man of unclean
[53:34] Spirit who had his dwelling among the
[53:37] tombs and no one could bind him no not
[53:41] with chains because he had been often
[53:45] bound with feathers chains and the
[53:47] chains had been plucked aunder by him
[53:52] the feathers broke in pieces and amen

[2:00:36] other how can
[2:00:41] do as they play that song Softly I want
[2:00:43] you just to think about that this
[2:00:46] morning the holy spirit is
[2:00:49] here he spoke to our hearts
[2:00:55] you heard as the as brother Homer said
[2:00:57] that he said I couldn't get away from
[2:01:01] this I I know how that feels where
[2:01:04] there's things that brother Alex you
[2:01:06] know as well sometimes you just you
[2:01:08] can't get away sometimes you you don't
[2:01:10] even have notes for the thoughts you're
[2:01:11] going to preach you just can't get away
[2:01:12] from it God just dropped
[2:01:14] something because ministering is not
[2:01:17] about the man it's about the needs of
[2:01:19] the
[2:01:19] people that's that's what it's all about
[2:01:22] it's not about preaching there going be
[2:01:24] many preachers but Ministry is serving
[2:01:27] it's ministering to the needs of God's
[2:01:30] people and so when you consider it like
[2:01:34] brother Homer as he was ministering that
[2:01:36] I tell you there's there's not one of us
[2:01:37] can take credit we did not seek God and
[2:01:42] and and I think tonight even as the word
[2:01:44] just keeps
[2:01:45] coming it's all speaking of arrest that
[2:01:48] it's it's not about you or me it's about
[2:01:52] God coming on the scene yes sir brother
[2:01:55] Bram said it I love how he said it in
[2:01:57] the message if God be with us where be
[2:01:59] all the Miracles he said at the end of
[2:02:00] the message in the prayer he said God
[2:02:02] anything that's been achieved in our in
[2:02:04] our life it's because you overrode our
[2:02:08] Rebellion you overrode our Rebellion
[2:02:12] over and achieved it our desire it's

[2:03:45] [Music]
[2:03:47] Lord God's that personal
[2:03:52] and I'll just say this I don't believe

[2:04:02] already got it
[2:04:05] covered if you'll just take him at his

[2:04:09] these services are connected right
[2:04:11] together oh the Lord allowed brother
[2:04:14] Homer to go into that part on
[2:04:16] nevertheless and that word nevertheless
[2:04:18] as he went in and defined that for us in
[2:04:21] spite of my
[2:04:23] feelings in spite of all the thoughts
[2:04:26] going through my mind in spite of Satan
[2:04:29] pointing out all my failures in spite of
[2:04:32] all that I'm going to take you at your
[2:04:37] word and I tell you if you can just just
[2:04:40] take out on that say look I'm not I'm
[2:04:42] not looking for anything but obedience
[2:04:44] to the word I'm going to let down the
[2:04:46] net you watch what God will do for
[2:04:50] you I'm telling you Church he's in the
[2:04:52] building this morning oh yeah he's right

[2:04:57] out of here with the needs left unmet in
[2:04:59] your life God is here this morning to
[2:05:01] take him at his word he will do beyond
[2:05:04] what you can ask or think he's that kind
[2:05:06] of a God he's the only living God there
[2:05:11] is tired of toiling tired of weighing
[2:05:14] just say Lord I'm I'm I'm nevertheless
[2:05:16] in spite of everything I am going to let
[2:05:18] down the net look Beyond whatever you
[2:05:21] need to look Beyond whatever whatever
[2:05:24] failures whatever thing that you see
[2:05:26] well I see this look beyond that because
[2:05:28] that's only a distraction that's right
[2:05:30] that's a scarecrow to try to steal you
[2:05:32] away from what God is calling you to
[2:05:34] look beyond
[2:05:37] that I know what he had to cross to get
[2:05:39] to
[2:05:41] me and what he had to cross everybody
[2:05:44] said you know what give him a month
[2:05:46] he'll be back out here right his daddy
[2:05:49] sent him away to a camp got him
[2:05:50] brainwashed well if it brainwash would
[2:05:52] have done it then it could have should
[2:05:54] have done it a long time ago but you
[2:05:56] know what what it is it isn't serving
[2:05:58] God is not about Mind Over Matter
[2:06:00] serving God is about a sovereign God
[2:06:02] coming by and overriding our own will
[2:06:05] and turning our heart to him I'll tell
[2:06:07] you this morning you're a blessed person
[2:06:09] if your heart has even turned you're a
