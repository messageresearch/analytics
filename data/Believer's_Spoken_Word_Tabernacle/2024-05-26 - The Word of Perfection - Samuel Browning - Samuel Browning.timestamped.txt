[36:14] that's what matters
[36:17] amen and so we want to just say God
[36:21] bless you this morning and um want to
[36:24] remember um continue to remember Sister
[36:27] Wilma in prayer I I didn't hear whether
[36:30] or not that there was a prayer request
[36:32] on that but um I didn't get a chance to
[36:35] mention to you last week um in regards
[36:39] to the surgery of the email that I had
[36:42] sent out and we had had prayer on last
[36:46] Thursday and uh in that request is that
[36:50] she had taken one
[36:51] test and it showed cancer so they did
[36:54] another test it showed cancer then they
[36:57] got into looking and said well it looks
[36:59] like there's an extra colon as well so
[37:03] they went in that's why the point of the
[37:06] surgery is to go in you know and
[37:07] obviously if there's cancer there uh
[37:10] which had showed up on previous two
[37:12] previous test to remove that as well as
[37:16] take care of that extra colon and
[37:19] surgery is supposed to be 4 hours and
[37:21] the things that sister Wilma was
[37:24] requesting and I couldn't write all that
[37:26] in the email was that that you know
[37:28] didn't want to have the lingering After
[37:30] Effects the possibilities of what could
[37:32] be from a surgery like that and um the
[37:35] Lord was so gracious the surgery was two
[37:38] hours long not four she didn't end up
[37:41] she didn't have to wear a bag and most
[37:43] importantly there's no
[37:52] cancer amen Our
[37:55] God still rains
[37:59] and I I when I received that call
[38:02] actually received the call from Sister
[38:03] pansy and I missed it but my wife had
[38:05] caught it and then I listened to it
[38:07] later on uh but when my wife told me I I
[38:10] tell you I had a praise break right
[38:12] there in the kitchen I was so so
[38:15] burdened uh for that need and uh just so
[38:19] thankful for the Lord's touch on sister
[38:21] Wilma's life so we want to continue to
[38:23] pray that the Lord will continue to give
[38:26] her strength as she recovers she hasn't
[38:28] been here in a few months because she
[38:29] had surgery on her
[38:31] feet and um the doctor told her when
[38:35] they had that surgery on her feet and
[38:36] said is actually the equivalency of two
[38:38] surgeries because the previous surgery
[38:40] the doctor didn't do it correctly and so
[38:43] that's why they had to go back in and
[38:45] take care of that work and redo it and
[38:47] just she's been she's getting around
[38:49] well but yet just after a little bit her
[38:51] feet will swell up and so she said just
[38:55] uh just just keep me in prayer that the
[38:57] Lord will just completely amen take care
[39:00] of that so let's just remember her in
[39:02] prayer hey the same God that took care
[39:04] of the cancer is the same God to take
[39:06] care of the feet amen so we want to do
[39:09] that as well uh also want to say um uh
[39:14] we want to just have prayer for also our
[39:17] son Ben I know he's he's at home he's a
[39:20] few days uh behind and he's kind of
[39:22] feeling a little bit under the weather
[39:24] you know how the allergies and things go
[39:26] and things get down you're coughing and
[39:28] things get down in your chest or so
[39:30] forth so he's he's he was wanting to
[39:33] come he said no you better
[39:36] stay so um we we want to ask you that
[39:40] you remember him in prayer and pray and
[39:43] if there's any other unspoken requests
[39:45] too we want to remember that I know they
[39:47] took that up earlier but I also want to
[39:49] say God bless sister kener it's good to
[39:51] have her and GRE back with us

[43:59] musicians amen let's go to
[44:02] Ruth amen chapter
[44:19] 2 and I want to go I want to go to verse
[44:21] eight we've it's been a few Sundays
[44:23] since we um that's spoke here on this
[44:27] and I jumped right in on it the last
[44:35] time in Ruth chapter 2 and verse
[44:39] 8 then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou
[44:44] not my daughter go not to glean in
[44:47] another field neither go from hence but
[44:50] abide here fast by my
[44:52] maidens let thine eyes be on the field
[44:56] that they do reap go Thou after them
[44:59] have not I charged the young men that
[45:02] they shall not touch thee and when thou
[45:05] art a thirst go into the vessels and
[45:09] drink of that which the young men have
[45:12] drawn then she fell on her face and
[45:14] bowed herself to the ground and said
[45:17] unto him why have I found Grace in thine
[45:21] eyes that thou should us take knowledge
[45:23] of me seeing I am a stranger so good and
[45:27] Boaz answered and said unto her it hath
[45:30] been fully showed me all that thou Hast
[45:33] done unto thy mother-in-law since the
[45:36] death of thine husband and how thou Hast
[45:39] left thy father and thy mother and the
[45:41] land of thy Nativity and are come unto a
[45:44] people which thou knewest not hi to
[45:47] before and the Lord recompensed I want
[45:50] you to watch this verse the Lord
[45:53] recompense thy Work and a full reward
[45:57] War be given thee of the Lord God of
[46:01] Israel under whose wings Thou Art come
[46:05] to trust amen then she said let me find
[46:09] favor in thy sight my lord for that thou
[46:13] Hast comforted me and for that thou H
[46:16] has spoken friendly unto thine handmaid
[46:19] though I be not like one of thine
[46:23] handmaids and Boaz said unto her at mil
[46:26] time
[46:27] Come Thou hither and eat of the bread
[46:30] and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and
[46:33] she sat beside the Reapers and he
[46:37] reached her now I want you to watch that
[46:39] he reached her parched corn and she did
[46:44] eat and was
[46:46] sufficed and left amen I'd like to just
[46:50] speak this this morning on a thought the
[46:52] word of perfection may God bless you and
[46:55] bless the word as you're being seated
[47:01] you
[47:03] know here in the Book of Ruth we
[47:06] recognize that as Boaz is speaking to
[47:09] her in this moment brother brandham when
[47:12] he would speak on Ruth and you catch it
[47:15] in the Revelation series you catch it in
[47:17] the breach you catch it in Redeemer
[47:19] Redemption kinsman redeemer it's very
[47:23] very rare that you'll find when the
[47:25] prophet would begin to speak on
[47:27] Redemption that the Ruth and that of
[47:30] Boaz does not come up because it's a
[47:33] very it's a very type of Christ in his
[47:37] bride and it's a very it's a book that
[47:39] speaks of the very hour that we're
[47:42] living in right now and the prophet
[47:44] would say it like this in one place in
[47:46] the message he said that baz when he saw
[47:50] Ruth and her character he said he
[47:53] already had in his mind what he was
[47:56] going going to
[47:57] do he already had that she didn't know
[48:02] that she wasn't aware of that but Boaz
[48:06] is aware of that and there are many
[48:08] things that though we look here in uh
[48:11] chapter 2 and you know that as you look
[48:14] in Chapter 2 very much you could almost
[48:16] conclude and say just as the prophet
[48:19] would go through that chapter 2 is very
[48:21] much a a chapter of sanctification she's
[48:24] responded to the to the call of the Holy
[48:27] Spirit God drawing her heart and there
[48:30] to come with Naomi but now as she's come
[48:33] into the into back into the land she's
[48:36] she begins to learn the customs of the
[48:38] land and how they dress and she's going
[48:41] along and doing this it's all under
[48:43] sanctification and remember it's even in
[48:45] this chapter brother B said she became a
[48:47] a legalist me you know not not a
[48:50] legalist in sense in a bad way but just
[48:52] there's things that if this is what he's
[48:54] saying and this is what's to be done and
[48:57] this is what I'm going to do and and you
[48:59] know it takes God coming in a deeper way
[49:02] within Ruth's life as it has in our life
[49:05] to take things from where it's just this
[49:07] is the right thing to do to where it's
[49:10] something that I desire to do it because
[49:13] of him so when when the love and the
[49:17] desires of the world is gone that it's
[49:19] all about him it's not a it's not a
[49:21] struggle anymore it's not it's not just
[49:23] a way of thinking anymore it is that
[49:26] that life that works within us that
[49:28] works to please him and this is exactly
[49:32] that notice that bohas himself sees all
[49:36] of this he has already all of this in
[49:39] mind and seeing her character but yet
[49:42] God just like Boaz with Ruth there has
[49:46] to allow that character to be displayed
[49:49] and allow the testing to come she's got
[49:52] to be tested throughout this journey
[49:55] even in Ruth chapter 2 she would receive
[49:58] a word of encouragement from her
[50:01] mother-in-law or rather admonition when
[50:03] she returns with this grain that she has
[50:06] gleaned and says don't don't you be
[50:09] found in another field now you stay
[50:11] right in his field and she's also going
[50:14] to be tested even though Boaz has said
[50:16] don't go after the young men she's going
[50:18] to be tested Boaz didn't put a bubble
[50:21] around her she's going to be tested in
[50:24] other words she's got decision to make
[50:28] just as she made an initial decision
[50:31] that's why you realize that when the
[50:32] Holy Ghost has come it doesn't remove
[50:35] decisions we we don't become robots but
[50:39] we become inspired and in tuned with the
[50:42] Living God and we're operating Under the
[50:45] Influence from another realm and because
[50:48] at one time we were operating by The
[50:51] Prince and power of the air that same
[50:54] spirit that now worketh Paul said then
[50:57] in the children of Disobedience no
[50:59] longer is it children it grew into a man
[51:02] of sin is that right this is the hour
[51:04] we're living in it grew so it matured it
[51:07] came to that place but notice that that
[51:10] that same the same holy spirit that at
[51:13] one time that where we walked under that
[51:15] influence but God in His Grace has
[51:18] brought an influence upon our life and
[51:21] let me say this if there wasn't anything
[51:23] in there to catch this influence it's
[51:27] just like this batter this this belt
[51:29] pack that I'm wearing going to that
[51:32] receiver that goes into the system if
[51:34] there was that receiver is not turned on
[51:37] if there is no receiver then there is
[51:39] not going to be any operation of this
[51:41] mic and that's why it's God bringing the
[51:44] influence that's why the Bible said it's
[51:47] not of him that willth or runneth it's
[51:49] God that showeth Mercy amen me just say
[51:53] it plain as day we couldn't find our way
[51:55] out of a paperback
[51:57] it takes the grace of God coming to our
[51:59] way to lead you and I out to
[52:02] Victory is that right and and really I
[52:06] feel that same way I need him every day
[52:08] I need him every moment he is the lead
[52:11] and guide of my life I need him at all
[52:15] times so through this though this be a
[52:18] chapter that we can look at that upon
[52:21] sanctification I want to remind you that
[52:24] when we think of the scripture where
[52:25] Boaz says has at Meal Time come hither
[52:29] um she's got to make that decision to
[52:31] come herself and notice all the way
[52:34] through this baz has not done one thing
[52:36] to discourage her as a matter of fact
[52:39] everything is set up to encourage her
[52:43] when you need refreshment there's water
[52:45] already drawn for you that's he's here
[52:48] to encourage you at Meal Time come and
[52:51] here she would come at meal time and he
[52:54] would reach her barley cakes he would
[52:58] reach her and we know what barley is a
[53:00] type of it's a type of resurrection
[53:02] power he would Minister to her the
[53:06] strength that was needed and this is why
[53:08] yeah turn this down a little bit please
[53:10] this is why that the prophet would say
[53:12] remember some would when it comes to
[53:14] going to the house of God and the church
[53:16] and remember one person said well you
[53:19] know brother brand I you know I don't
[53:20] believe in being a legalist I don't
[53:22] believe you got to go to church I I
[53:24] believe you can just do brother brand
[53:25] he's quickly said 64 question answer he
[53:27] said you better be legal on some things
[53:31] now you think well why must I be legal
[53:34] on some things because there are some
[53:36] things that we recognize that when it
[53:40] when it comes down to it there will be
[53:42] times that we may not feel and though
[53:45] there's a desire they if listen friends
[53:47] if there's not a desire within to be in
[53:49] the house of God then you really need to
[53:51] check up this is where the Prophet said
[53:53] in Christ the mystery you need to get to
[53:55] the Altar and say God God fill me with
[53:57] the love of God right so now because
[54:01] we're recognizing that within all of
[54:03] this there's a time that we have to say
[54:05] you know I I'm going because God is
[54:07] going to meet us there amen God knows
[54:10] what I have need of even when I'm at my
[54:12] lowest moment or a downtime or a test or
[54:15] a trial uh you know we we want to come
[54:18] because God has promise that he would
[54:21] meet us he said wherever two or three
[54:23] are gathered together in my name I'll be
[54:25] there and that's why the prophet when
[54:27] they were starting the church in Tucson
[54:30] and he spoke to the congregation and he
[54:32] says look he said he said we must
[54:34] assemble together to correctly worship
[54:37] God and he says if there's only two
[54:39] people there you be one of them right
[54:43] now to think when we see this in this
[54:46] manner let me just read to you here a
[54:48] few statements of that that the prophet
[54:50] would make and and just to take this
[54:52] into our hearts the prophet would say
[54:54] and I will restore in 1954
[54:57] a man that's born of the spirit of God
[54:59] loves to go to church better than he
[55:02] loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry
[55:05] the spiritual man on the inside has got
[55:09] to be fed and if that man isn't fed he
[55:12] will die the outward man isn't fed he
[55:15] will die and so will the inward man he
[55:18] goes on he said Jesus told Satan in the
[55:21] debate it's written man shall not live
[55:23] by bread alone but by every word that
[55:25] proceeds s out of the mouth of God
[55:28] that's how man lives not by his bread
[55:31] alone but by the word of God man lives
[55:35] his outward man lives by Bread his
[55:37] inward man lives by the bread of God and
[55:41] let me just say it like this the bread
[55:42] of God is the revealed word for this
[55:47] hour if you were living in the days of
[55:49] Wesley that was the revealed bread of
[55:52] sanctification for that hour so the
[55:55] bread remember the bread is actually the
[55:58] person of Christ himself because
[56:01] remember he was typed as the Mana
[56:03] falling in the wilderness they had what
[56:06] they needed for that day is that right
[56:09] God promised he would provide what we
[56:12] have need of for this day and let me
[56:14] just say it like this God knew what
[56:16] would take place in this day spiritually
[56:19] God knew what would be taking place in
[56:21] your life today May 26th God know knows
[56:26] all about this and God has prepared what
[56:30] you and I have need of for this moment
[56:34] he is the bread of life he is that bread
[56:37] that come down from heaven amen a bread
[56:41] of life he is the source of Life yes sir
[56:46] So within this we understand it's just
[56:49] like when job I love how job says this
[56:51] when he says I I have esteemed the words
[56:54] of his mouth more than my necessary food
[56:58] so I I need I need to hear from God more
[57:02] than I need anything else because listen
[57:05] there's a lot of things that you and I
[57:07] we could Fellowship on this I could try
[57:09] to fix I could try to solve we come here
[57:12] we bring burdens we bring our cares and
[57:14] we say Lord I need a
[57:16] word I need I need a word from you Lord
[57:20] I need strength Lord I I need help I
[57:23] need strength I I'm not too big to say
[57:25] Lord I need I need help my thoughts may
[57:28] be getting away from me I need a word
[57:30] from God I can have a good meal I could
[57:34] have a wonderful steak or whatever more
[57:36] but I need something that goes down on
[57:39] the inside to give me strength in my
[57:42] spiritual man because if if that's where
[57:45] I receive the strength there's where
[57:47] it's needed everything else will be
[57:50] ordered correctly my perspectives on
[57:53] everything else will be ordered
[57:55] correctly
[57:57] ly and we're in this life and oh how we
[58:00] need him we need this
[58:03] leadership amen that's how God leads us
[58:06] by feeding the word of God is that right
[58:09] that's how that's how his children are
[58:10] LED they're not led by a man saying go
[58:12] do this no we're led by the feeding of
[58:15] the
[58:16] word oh my now notice brother bam goes
[58:19] into this in the Attunement uh in in
[58:21] tement I want you to notice these words
[58:23] here he refers to that that scripture
[58:25] again where every man but we shall not
[58:28] live by bread alone but by every word
[58:30] that proceeds out of the mouth of God go
[58:32] ahead and go to the next paragraph
[58:33] sister Brianna he says then how can you
[58:36] stay at stay home and be just a good a
[58:39] Christian as you would be at church you
[58:41] can't do it now there could be a lot of
[58:44] reasons and things within there but you
[58:46] know when I when I'm looking at this of
[58:48] how that the prophet would bring it that
[58:51] how can you stay home and be just as
[58:53] good a Christian as you would at church
[58:54] you can't do it must read the word the
[58:58] Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible
[59:00] is God's spiritual diet for his church
[59:03] and the Holy Spirit watch this now and
[59:06] the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it
[59:09] to you and places it in the heart and
[59:12] with Thanksgiving you order it so who's
[59:16] bringing it he's bringing it he's the
[59:18] one that's giving it who was it that
[59:20] reached it to Ruth Boaz notice
[59:24] everything is set up to to encourage her
[59:27] in her
[59:29] journey he knows he knows what he has
[59:33] and what he is intending to do she
[59:36] doesn't know that secret that's in his
[59:40] heart that's it's a secret that's been
[59:43] in his
[59:45] heart nothing can pull that secret
[59:49] out no other men no one else that is a
[59:52] secret that only that can be disclosed
[59:56] to her at the proper time so good that's
[1:00:00] why God in this hour here's a Ruth on
[1:00:02] the scene where the secret of God is
[1:00:06] being disclosed to his children in this
[1:00:10] hour yes sir it's a secret it's that
[1:00:14] that part that God is unfolding all all
[1:00:17] that that with all that it's all been
[1:00:19] about down Through the Ages and how that
[1:00:22] every shadow and every type that's been
[1:00:24] through the scriptures it's been about
[1:00:27] you the Bride of Jesus Christ it's been
[1:00:30] of Christ himself taking a bride and
[1:00:33] that he himself would Tabernacle in a
[1:00:35] people that's the whole secret that is
[1:00:38] there is that he himself would take a
[1:00:41] people for his name
[1:00:47] sake this is why clear back in Genesis
[1:00:50] to you can all the way through the
[1:00:52] scriptures you can see the presence of
[1:00:55] the seven seal all the way through and
[1:00:57] and I I say this you've heard me heard
[1:00:59] me speak it enough the terminology
[1:01:01] itself should not stumble you the seven
[1:01:04] seal itself is simply Christ coming down
[1:01:07] to earth in the fullness and
[1:01:09] tabernacling in humanity thank you Lord
[1:01:14] It's God tabernacling deity in its
[1:01:17] fullness once again upon the
[1:01:20] Earth it's Christ it's the coming of the
[1:01:22] Lord Christ coming in our lives that
[1:01:25] makes us ready for his
[1:01:29] coming that's so good amen it's an event
[1:01:33] that's a secret to the rest of the
[1:01:37] world this that took place between U
[1:01:41] Boaz and Ruth it was a secret yes right
[1:01:45] that's right but it's here in In This
[1:01:48] Moment God is making it real to you and
[1:01:50] I let me just tell you it's not a bunch
[1:01:53] of
[1:01:53] information it's not a bunch of
[1:01:57] it's not a bunch of theology that's
[1:01:59] right but it's a spirit of God taking
[1:02:01] the word breathing upon it breathing
[1:02:03] into your life and letting you know that
[1:02:05] you were in his mind before the
[1:02:07] foundation of the world before there was
[1:02:10] atom Stardust or molecule you are
[1:02:12] already a son and daughter of
[1:02:15] God and there's nothing that can destroy
[1:02:19] that hall because you're a part of that
[1:02:23] word and God's word can not be destroyed
[1:02:27] if one word of God can be taken away or
[1:02:30] diminished then he's not
[1:02:33] God but God is the
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:39] word I want you to notice
[1:02:43] this and the Holy Spirit is the one who
[1:02:45] brings it to you and places it in the
[1:02:47] heart and with Thanksgiving you water
[1:02:50] this becomes our responsibility with
[1:02:52] Thanksgiving thank you Lord okay think I
[1:02:56] heard in the prayer very much of even
[1:02:57] like what brother uh Wendell had spoke
[1:03:00] there at the very end when God drops a
[1:03:02] promise in your heart don't look for
[1:03:05] some don't look for some sensation or
[1:03:07] some feeling begin to thank him because
[1:03:09] it's the word that must come to pass and
[1:03:12] when God's word has been spoken and it's
[1:03:15] spoken clearly to your life begin to
[1:03:18] thank God for
[1:03:23] it and every Divine promise will produce
[1:03:26] just exactly what God said it will do
[1:03:29] it's got to it's his word it's his life
[1:03:32] it's just like mzd when Abraham I'm
[1:03:35] trying to just lay this in here when
[1:03:37] when MDC met
[1:03:40] Abraham the same God that had called to
[1:03:43] Abraham knew Abraham all along now here
[1:03:47] Abraham sees him here in a form in a
[1:03:52] being and God reveals himself in this in
[1:03:56] this form of mezc as priest of the most
[1:04:00] high God one who is an intercessor one
[1:04:04] who goes in between to do what to make a
[1:04:07] way and what does he give what does he
[1:04:10] release to
[1:04:11] Abraham after the battle is over he
[1:04:14] gives him what's
[1:04:16] needed Bread and
[1:04:20] Wine this is why that even when we see
[1:04:23] that what took place on the day of
[1:04:25] Pentecost Jesus said except you eat the
[1:04:27] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:04:29] blood you have no life in you you must
[1:04:31] be a partaker of the word amen and to be
[1:04:36] a partaker of it is where we give our
[1:04:37] lives to it it it's not enough to hear
[1:04:40] it memorize it repeat it that's right
[1:04:44] it's got listen friends it's where we
[1:04:46] give our life to it that's right that's
[1:04:48] why the prophet said in spiritual food
[1:04:50] and due season he said if this is the
[1:04:52] truth and all that God has Vindicated
[1:04:55] and is the truth then we owe our entire
[1:04:58] life to it Hallelujah to him to this
[1:05:02] word that this word would have its way
[1:05:05] in our lives and this is why that even
[1:05:08] when we consider this that through this
[1:05:10] meeting with MDC Abraham he he received
[1:05:15] a call from God but it's in this meeting
[1:05:17] that Abraham has a blessing pronounced
[1:05:20] over his life that thou art Abraham of
[1:05:23] the most high God you're not just Abram
[1:05:26] of so and so and so and so you are of
[1:05:29] the most high God he's not talking to
[1:05:33] this man right here he's talking to that
[1:05:36] Son of God on the
[1:05:39] inside Blessed Be him who is possessor
[1:05:42] of heavens and earth Blessed Be him who
[1:05:44] has
[1:05:45] delivered the battle into your
[1:05:49] hands that's why when we're a partaker
[1:05:52] of the Bread and Wine then out of our
[1:05:55] hearts it Paul states that Revelation I
[1:05:58] am of the most high god he has delivered
[1:06:03] into my hands my enemies he has caused
[1:06:07] me to triumph over my enemies no matter
[1:06:10] habits whatever it is you can put it all
[1:06:12] down but it is God that causes you to be
[1:06:18] Victorious and because of that Abraham
[1:06:21] surrendered ties of all he gave the best
[1:06:24] he gave the choice part he gave that
[1:06:26] part unto God he recognized who was in
[1:06:30] his midst this is why the prophet said
[1:06:33] that this shows what every son of
[1:06:36] Abraham will do in the end time as they
[1:06:39] meet MDC that's so good it's a
[1:06:42] surrendering of Our Lives yes it is is
[1:06:45] that right right that soul is a type of
[1:06:48] the tithe it's that part because the
[1:06:50] bride itself is a tithe unto God is that
[1:06:55] right
[1:06:56] the Bride is a tithe unto
[1:06:59] God there's many that you know can come
[1:07:01] into the offering but it's like our soul
[1:07:04] our soul being a tithe unto God but your
[1:07:06] spirit and your flesh will be an
[1:07:08] offering it's what you want to offer if
[1:07:11] you just want to offer just a little bit
[1:07:13] you can offer just a little bit but
[1:07:15] listen it's about an offering and if God
[1:07:18] listen this is why oh I love it in the
[1:07:20] Psalms when David when David would write
[1:07:22] in the Psalms in the midst of battle he
[1:07:24] would say with with my whole heart oh
[1:07:27] God will I worship thee that's right
[1:07:29] when they would go to worship they
[1:07:31] didn't just give a little piece of an
[1:07:33] offering but they they opened up in
[1:07:35] times of worship Thanksgiving offerings
[1:07:37] it was with the whole entirety of that
[1:07:41] animal of that sacrifice I say if
[1:07:43] there's ever a time ever a people ever
[1:07:47] received a word from God that should be
[1:07:49] in the place to say God take every bit
[1:07:52] of my life Lord let my all be an off
[1:07:55] offing and if there's anything that's
[1:07:57] hindering me from offering my all Lord
[1:08:00] Purge it out of my life
[1:08:04] Lord he gives us just what we
[1:08:07] need I want to say that again he gives
[1:08:09] us just what we
[1:08:14] need he guides us he ministers to us
[1:08:18] just what we need the scripture here in
[1:08:20] John 14 and I want to just begin to take
[1:08:23] this this approach here he's giv us what
[1:08:25] he needs remember Boaz has all of this
[1:08:28] in his mind and God giving us what we
[1:08:31] have need of John 141 said let not your
[1:08:34] heart be troubled ye believe in God
[1:08:37] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:08:40] are many mansions if it were not so I
[1:08:44] would have told you I go to prepare a
[1:08:46] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[1:08:49] place for you I will come again and
[1:08:52] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:08:55] then there ye may be
[1:08:58] also as as the complete
[1:09:01] sacrifice as the one who had come here
[1:09:05] to represent and to manifest of what
[1:09:09] that Adam was in the garden prior to the
[1:09:12] fall here stands the second Adam and the
[1:09:15] second Adam being that of God himself
[1:09:19] because God God's a redeemer he could
[1:09:22] not send somebody else to redeem
[1:09:26] something that's his like you can't send
[1:09:28] somebody to the pawn shop to get
[1:09:30] something that's in there you got to go
[1:09:32] yourself if it belongs to you you got to
[1:09:35] go this is why Jesus is not the second
[1:09:38] person of the godhead the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:41] not the third person of the godhead it
[1:09:43] is God who was above us God who came
[1:09:46] down with us and the same God is now in
[1:09:49] US it that is redemption yes sir yes sir
[1:09:54] he came down to redeem his
[1:09:59] creation and this is why the Bible said
[1:10:01] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:10:05] unto himself it all began with that word
[1:10:09] that went forth and brought forth a body
[1:10:12] that the word itself could Tabernacle in
[1:10:16] yeah it was made in the likeness of
[1:10:17] sinful flesh but brother and sister it
[1:10:20] did not come by sexual birth that blood
[1:10:23] is the holy precious blood of the Lamb
[1:10:27] Peter called it the blood of Christ you
[1:10:30] know why because we couldn't be another
[1:10:32] man's blood I don't care how righteous a
[1:10:34] man would have been he still born in sin
[1:10:37] and we're still would be subject to the
[1:10:39] fall but there had to come one from
[1:10:43] above I hope you hear me he had to come
[1:10:46] from above he could not come from this
[1:10:49] polluted
[1:10:51] line there had to come one to stand on
[1:10:54] the stand on our
[1:10:58] behalf is that right and he had to go to
[1:11:02] Calvary he had to pay the price had to
[1:11:05] take our sins to hell and deposit them
[1:11:08] there and he raises on the third day and
[1:11:11] he's Seated on the right hand of the
[1:11:13] Majesty on high he's got Authority let
[1:11:15] me tell you something the same one that
[1:11:17] was here that could say to a person go
[1:11:20] and send no more the same one that were
[1:11:23] an epileptic child in fit would be
[1:11:26] dismissed the same one where demons
[1:11:28] would be cast out that had tormented and
[1:11:30] hounded a man throughout his life that
[1:11:33] same almighty God that demonstrated in
[1:11:36] that hour through the very veil of the
[1:11:39] Son of God was announcing that the
[1:11:41] Jubilee is on because there's already a
[1:11:44] free man right here and Christ himself
[1:11:48] manifested that he was the free man and
[1:11:51] not only the free man he became the high
[1:11:54] priest of his own word and he sent back
[1:11:57] the holy ghost that life that was in
[1:12:00] that blood cell that was in that free
[1:12:02] man that could call out and say you are
[1:12:05] free you are
[1:12:10] pardoned it was the Redeemer expressing
[1:12:16] Redemption that's he went to prepare a
[1:12:19] place make a way for you and I that we
[1:12:24] could come back to
[1:12:26] our inheritance Hallelujah you see this
[1:12:28] is why this this this word this message
[1:12:31] has meaning to you that's right that's
[1:12:35] why it's not just another movement
[1:12:37] that's why it's not just well there's
[1:12:39] are wonderful Miracles and my I tell you
[1:12:42] we this can be reproduced this is why
[1:12:44] that this message is more than that this
[1:12:48] message itself is a direct a direct
[1:12:52] message from the throne that Reve rals
[1:12:55] to you that you have an inheritance on
[1:12:59] the other side you were always a part of
[1:13:03] God hallelujah you know what that does
[1:13:07] it doesn't matter what kind of Darkness
[1:13:09] or Gloom or unbelief or whatever has
[1:13:12] hung over your life or might be hanging
[1:13:14] over your life there is a word before
[1:13:18] there was a Gloom before there was a
[1:13:20] doubt before there was an unbelief the
[1:13:23] word itself
[1:13:25] was already established and
[1:13:29] settled and that word cannot be
[1:13:33] defeated you might feel defeated this
[1:13:36] morning but your feelings are not the
[1:13:39] truth that's right let every man's words
[1:13:43] be a lie and let God's word be the
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:48] truth even your own thoughts that
[1:13:51] sometimes plague you about you God's
[1:13:53] word is the
[1:13:57] truth that's right you are a part of the
[1:14:03] truth the very God of Glory that stood
[1:14:06] there in Pilot's
[1:14:08] Hall he said I've come to Bear witness
[1:14:11] of the
[1:14:12] truth amen pilot said what is truth here
[1:14:16] was standing truth you know what truth
[1:14:18] was it was the manifested word it was
[1:14:21] the word that had been spoken all the
[1:14:24] way since there of the Fallen Eden it
[1:14:27] was that which was represented clear
[1:14:29] back before the foundation of the world
[1:14:31] now came the truth and let me tell you
[1:14:34] this truth that he came to bear witness
[1:14:36] of is that indeed God has and will have
[1:14:41] a bride he will have sons and daughters
[1:14:44] of God he was the
[1:14:46] first among
[1:14:49] many Brethren yes
[1:14:52] sir yes sir
[1:14:56] and he said in verse four whether I go
[1:14:59] in the way you know Thomas said Lord we
[1:15:02] don't know whether thou goes how can we
[1:15:04] know the
[1:15:05] way Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:15:09] and the life and no man cometh unto the
[1:15:12] father but by
[1:15:14] me that's good so now the way Thomas is
[1:15:18] looking for and say hey hey how are we
[1:15:20] going to know the way he said the way is
[1:15:22] right before
[1:15:23] you amen what what was the way the way
[1:15:27] was the word being
[1:15:30] manifested you see how simple it was
[1:15:33] they had been they they were overlooking
[1:15:34] it they were seeing what was taking
[1:15:38] place but you see to connect what it was
[1:15:40] all about it would take the grace of
[1:15:43] almighty God friends listen if it wasn't
[1:15:46] for God's grace you and I it would have
[1:15:48] went over our heads it wasn't because we
[1:15:51] were some great intellectual people H
[1:15:54] not at all it's the grace of God that
[1:15:56] has opened our
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:01] eyes that's what it is it's God's
[1:16:04] grace because you see the way itself
[1:16:07] it's kind of like when you think of in
[1:16:09] the days of the judges you know when all
[1:16:11] this was taking place and how the judges
[1:16:14] were here you know every man the Bible
[1:16:16] this says it a couple times in that
[1:16:18] every man did what was right in his own
[1:16:20] eyes whatever he thought and you know
[1:16:23] why they did it that way the prophet
[1:16:25] said it's because the word of the Lord
[1:16:28] was
[1:16:29] missing that's good they had the
[1:16:32] writings but they were missing the word
[1:16:34] of the Lord and the prophet said what
[1:16:36] that is is they didn't have a prophet
[1:16:39] among
[1:16:41] them a prophet is a mouthpiece of God a
[1:16:45] prophet is one who speaks the very
[1:16:48] Oracles of almighty God a prophet is a
[1:16:51] channel that God uses and anoints to see
[1:16:54] the on present conditions and be able to
[1:16:58] enter into that sphere in that realm to
[1:17:01] catch what God has already said and
[1:17:04] bring it down here to Earth that the
[1:17:07] people living on Earth can live in
[1:17:09] Heavenly
[1:17:11] places Hallelujah God has men to raise
[1:17:14] up into that channel and you know what
[1:17:16] that word becomes then we've got an
[1:17:19] absolute that's good so good then we've
[1:17:22] got a point of ending all Strife that's
[1:17:24] right amen Oh my he come to make a
[1:17:29] preparation this is why when the prophet
[1:17:32] would talk about this and he would go
[1:17:34] through that message things that are to
[1:17:36] be if you haven't listened to it in a
[1:17:38] while it' be good to go in through it
[1:17:40] that's a good way yes sir but the
[1:17:42] prophet's talking about all of this
[1:17:44] preparation God God is making a way for
[1:17:49] his people science he said in that time
[1:17:52] he said science is is making this he
[1:17:54] said it's it's sending up all these
[1:17:56] Sputnik and things I found it
[1:17:57] interesting how the prophet said it he
[1:17:58] said they're sending up all these
[1:18:00] satellites and stuff and he said all
[1:18:01] it's going to end up doing he said is
[1:18:03] just to spread disease found it
[1:18:05] interesting that would be said that way
[1:18:08] and he says you know he said but you
[1:18:09] need to look Beyond science you know
[1:18:12] science like to promise a lot of helps
[1:18:14] and cures and and there's a lot of
[1:18:16] things that even with science and and I
[1:18:18] they just put it this way let's just try
[1:18:19] to bring it down to To Nuts and Bolts
[1:18:22] that there's a lot of things that you
[1:18:23] can look at Within this world let me
[1:18:26] just let me just say it like
[1:18:27] this this world is beyond hope friends
[1:18:30] that's
[1:18:32] right I'm just going to tell you right
[1:18:34] now if you vote you vote but listen
[1:18:36] don't don't put all your eggs in the
[1:18:38] basket that's right don't put all your
[1:18:41] attention in the basket of well we got
[1:18:43] to get this and turn this around you
[1:18:45] can't Hallelujah that's right but the
[1:18:49] thing to do is turn Heavenly say God let
[1:18:52] me be so locked into what's going on in
[1:18:54] heaven Hallelujah because remember God
[1:18:57] knew you would be here that's right
[1:19:00] hallelujah oh brother Samuel we can't
[1:19:02] make it let me tell you something Trump
[1:19:04] didn't put nothing on my table that's
[1:19:06] right come on now that's right come on
[1:19:09] now you might get offended I like Trump
[1:19:11] but he didn't put nothing on my
[1:19:13] table I'm talking about not his
[1:19:15] character the things that was done you
[1:19:17] know but what I'm trying to say is and
[1:19:19] then you say well well he did this and
[1:19:21] he did that let me tell you something
[1:19:23] God promised he'd apply all my
[1:19:27] needs there is no little superscript
[1:19:31] writing that says unless Trump is in
[1:19:34] office or unless there's a republican
[1:19:37] you know both sides are as corrupt as
[1:19:39] corrupt can be that's
[1:19:42] right you see what I'm saying friends
[1:19:44] these things become traps of the enemy
[1:19:47] oh brother Samuel I love my country what
[1:19:49] do you love more do you love God more or
[1:19:53] do you love your country more
[1:19:56] preach brother
[1:19:59] Samuel it's a trap friends it's a trap
[1:20:02] to try to bring you down that's right
[1:20:06] come on now this is why God bringing his
[1:20:08] word in this hour what's he doing
[1:20:10] leading us to the things that we need to
[1:20:12] be feeding on let me tell you something
[1:20:15] right now if I get around you I can tell
[1:20:17] whether or not you've been listening to
[1:20:19] a lot of this junk brother Samuel do you
[1:20:22] I don't I'm just being honest with you I
[1:20:24] just don't I'm not trying to be naive
[1:20:27] once in a while there might be something
[1:20:29] that comes up on Israel I want to hear
[1:20:31] it you know if somebody's got to say
[1:20:32] something about this I want to hear it
[1:20:35] but the other things I you you say why
[1:20:37] because listen if you haven't caught it
[1:20:39] and seen it by now we are there are
[1:20:41] people that are completely insane and
[1:20:44] I'm not talking against the people
[1:20:46] friends this is an anointing of Darkness
[1:20:50] that's upon the
[1:20:53] earth I feel sorry for the people but
[1:20:55] it's the darkness that's overtaken the
[1:20:57] people but we're not to be overtaken
[1:21:00] with Darkness we're to be overtaken with
[1:21:02] the
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:05] light that's why the prophet picks it up
[1:21:08] in Shalom he says put your life in the
[1:21:11] hands of he who holds the future that's
[1:21:14] right that's right David said my times
[1:21:17] are in thy hand oh God so God has this
[1:21:20] preparation this thing that we're living
[1:21:22] in right now is an old pest house right
[1:21:26] I know that might be kind of new you
[1:21:27] know to the young ones and young ones
[1:21:29] they can go and look it up what's a pest
[1:21:32] house that's where they put all the
[1:21:33] diseased people yes it's like an ouse
[1:21:36] yep yes right sickness and everything
[1:21:40] will come around you know even while
[1:21:42] you're living here in in this pest house
[1:21:45] this is not what God intended no no God
[1:21:48] never intended for you and I to you know
[1:21:50] in this this body to be broke down and
[1:21:53] how things are God never intended that
[1:21:55] but what did that was sin
[1:21:59] amen are you hearing me this is why
[1:22:02] sometimes people we caught up and say
[1:22:04] this is a good person this person's good
[1:22:06] why did this have to happen to them
[1:22:08] listen it doesn't matter if they're good
[1:22:09] bad or one of more and let me tell you
[1:22:11] we're all in bodies of
[1:22:14] sin I hate seeing disease and things
[1:22:17] take a hold in people's body I've got a
[1:22:20] neighbor right now that oh my if if God
[1:22:23] don't intervene he won't be here much
[1:22:25] longer I told my wife the other day when
[1:22:28] I've looked at that I said I've heard
[1:22:29] that word cancer so much in this past
[1:22:31] year I hate that
[1:22:34] devil I hate that
[1:22:37] devil sometimes hearing it twice in one
[1:22:40] day and things coming oh I'm glad that
[1:22:42] we're going to a
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:45] place we're going to a body where
[1:22:48] they'll never be no more cancer no more
[1:22:51] sickness no more disease we're going to
[1:22:53] a land where there'll never be an
[1:22:55] ambulance there'll never be a funeral
[1:22:57] there'll never be a hospital
[1:23:00] there and as a matter of fact I'm not
[1:23:03] just talking about the future H I'm
[1:23:05] talking about the
[1:23:09] Millennium in the Millennium is where
[1:23:11] God will have Universal Health Care set
[1:23:13] up but the problem is you won't have to
[1:23:16] register for
[1:23:17] it if you're already pre-registered
[1:23:20] you've accepted the invitation been
[1:23:22] sealed with the spirit of God then here
[1:23:24] you will be gathered and there will be
[1:23:27] even others on the earth that will be
[1:23:29] raised during that time and will benefit
[1:23:31] from it and when it's all said and done
[1:23:33] we'll turn their backs and walk
[1:23:36] away that's amazing that's a that's a
[1:23:39] that's another message for another time
[1:23:41] let me try to get to where I'm getting
[1:23:43] to this is this this this what we're
[1:23:45] talking about this is not the father's
[1:23:47] house that we just read
[1:23:48] about but the father's house has many
[1:23:51] mansions there's a body that's reserved
[1:23:53] Peter said like this you you have a body
[1:23:57] through and by the resurrection of the
[1:23:58] Lord Jesus Christ we have been begotten
[1:24:00] unto a lovely hope amen we we have a
[1:24:04] body that is
[1:24:06] undefiled uncorruptible unfaded reserved
[1:24:10] in the
[1:24:13] heavens are you hearing me this is where
[1:24:16] Paul would write if this Earthly House
[1:24:18] of this Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:24:20] one
[1:24:22] waiting is that right
[1:24:24] see see the elect of God have one
[1:24:27] waiting over there now let me just let
[1:24:29] me just put Let me just drop this in
[1:24:30] here you see what this is it's calling
[1:24:33] us to a Perfection now let me just let
[1:24:35] me read this the other one the prophet
[1:24:38] said is called my father's house this is
[1:24:40] that of things that are to be I'll go
[1:24:42] and prepare a place for you take you out
[1:24:44] of the pest house and deliver you into
[1:24:45] my father's house there you are I'll
[1:24:48] take you out of the old Earthly pest
[1:24:50] house he's gone to prepare a place a
[1:24:52] perfect place where no evil exists no
[1:24:55] sickness exists no old age exists no
[1:24:57] death exist it's a perfect place calling
[1:25:01] you to that Perfection and you have to
[1:25:04] be perfect to get there the Bible said
[1:25:07] Jesus said be you therefore perfect even
[1:25:10] as your father in Heaven is perfect it's
[1:25:14] a perfect Kingdom it must be a perfect
[1:25:16] people because you have to stand and be
[1:25:19] married to a perfect Son of God you must
[1:25:21] be a perfect bride so how can you do it
[1:25:24] through anything else but the perfect
[1:25:27] word of God which is the Waters of
[1:25:29] Separation that washes us from our sins
[1:25:33] the blood of Jesus Christ the dripping
[1:25:35] bloody word the word of God bleeding to
[1:25:38] wash the bride in she stands perfect
[1:25:41] virgin unadulterated she never sinned in
[1:25:45] the first place amen she was trapped
[1:25:48] into it there's the father's house that
[1:25:51] he's going to prepare thank you Father
[1:25:53] Lord now I want you to think about this
[1:25:55] for a
[1:25:57] moment we have representation over
[1:26:01] there when we get over there on the
[1:26:03] other side remember when the prophet saw
[1:26:05] them over there I want you to remind you
[1:26:09] he said the sisters he said everybody
[1:26:12] was dressed there within
[1:26:16] gowns there was no makeup
[1:26:19] there was no toe gloss there fingernail
[1:26:22] polish no come on friends don't don't
[1:26:25] don't back up on me now you see going in
[1:26:28] the Rapture is not leaving all that
[1:26:31] behind it's the spirit of God calling to
[1:26:34] hearts that if there's things and listen
[1:26:36] friends there's things I know that if it
[1:26:38] continues to go deeper but if there's
[1:26:40] things that is there that's in the life
[1:26:43] that the spirit of God is calling out
[1:26:45] against listen malice ain't going to
[1:26:47] make it bitterness ain't going to make
[1:26:49] it Envy ain't going to make it those
[1:26:51] things have got to be settled on this
[1:26:53] time right are you hearing me Rapture
[1:26:56] morning ain't going to take care of
[1:26:58] it God has called you and I in this hour
[1:27:02] to live as sons of God just like that
[1:27:05] slave lived he knew he was the son of a
[1:27:08] king so he conducted himself in the same
[1:27:11] way this word is calling us to
[1:27:17] Perfection everybody's being influenced
[1:27:20] by Spirits remember here we are standing
[1:27:22] there's three Realms going up here's the
[1:27:25] Holy Spirit here you come then the the
[1:27:27] souls under the altar Heaven itself then
[1:27:30] you go beneath that you have the souls
[1:27:31] of the unjust then you have demons then
[1:27:33] you have hell itself so Mortals are
[1:27:36] living here in this in this in this uh
[1:27:40] in between space and there are spirits
[1:27:43] that are influencing them to do those
[1:27:46] things we've got a choice on what we are
[1:27:48] going to allow ourselves to be
[1:27:50] influenced by amen because let me tell
[1:27:54] you something the word of God will never
[1:27:56] lead you
[1:27:57] downward it won't Lead You downward in
[1:27:59] your thinking it won't Lead You downward
[1:28:01] in your actions it won't Lead You
[1:28:03] downward in your life the word does
[1:28:06] never go
[1:28:08] down because the word cannot be defeated
[1:28:11] how can you bury resurrection
[1:28:16] power you can't do it it'll come up even
[1:28:20] when you go through a test or a trial
[1:28:23] let me tell you something in a time when
[1:28:24] you're dying to yourself there's
[1:28:27] resurrection power there in your life
[1:28:30] that that resurrection power will guide
[1:28:33] you and see you through that test or
[1:28:35] trial and you'll come out stronger on
[1:28:37] the other side of it why cuz you can't
[1:28:41] keep that life
[1:28:44] down hallu that is good
[1:28:49] Hallelujah we have representation over
[1:28:51] there it's calling to us
[1:28:55] that's what I said that's why this
[1:28:56] message means something to you and I
[1:29:00] that's why the prophet said when you
[1:29:02] have heard this word and it's become
[1:29:06] Eagle food to you and you left the other
[1:29:09] thing you have heard from your
[1:29:14] theophany Hallelujah is that right
[1:29:17] that's right so now that representation
[1:29:19] and this is why that within a life that
[1:29:23] even has within a life that is calling
[1:29:26] out a seed of God on the inside is
[1:29:29] longing for life this is why that just
[1:29:32] accepting the Lord in the Forgiveness of
[1:29:34] your sins it's not enough there's
[1:29:36] something about it that you're thankful
[1:29:38] but there's more there's more there's
[1:29:40] more it's why that it comes to the
[1:29:42] sanctifying power of God that cleanses
[1:29:45] out the habits and the desires of the
[1:29:47] world but you know that's not enough
[1:29:49] there's something that says I want more
[1:29:51] I want more of God I want more what is
[1:29:54] that that's calling out for more of God
[1:29:56] it's not your
[1:29:58] intellect it's that seed on the inside
[1:30:02] that God knew would be here hallelu and
[1:30:06] here you are praying Lord I I want more
[1:30:08] Lord show me your way Lord I want to see
[1:30:11] I want to see a complete victory in my
[1:30:12] life Lord I want to see Lord a a real
[1:30:15] ceiling you promised the Holy Ghost to
[1:30:17] me Lord I I want to I want to grow Lord
[1:30:19] I I want to mature in my life Lord give
[1:30:22] me Grace to go through the test and the
[1:30:24] trials Lord Give Me Lord strength
[1:30:26] through adversity through these things
[1:30:28] that the virtues might move and abound
[1:30:31] in my life Lord give me Grace
[1:30:34] Lord that's why the prophet at the end
[1:30:36] of the message stat of a perfect man he
[1:30:38] could stand before the audience and he
[1:30:40] said oh he said I might not maintain my
[1:30:43] family I may not maintain my job I may
[1:30:47] not maintain a lot of things but let me
[1:30:49] maintain my relationship with Jesus
[1:30:52] Christ he said Almighty God he said
[1:30:55] before this congregation he said my
[1:30:57] hands raised in the air he said I will
[1:30:59] not stop nor cease till I see every one
[1:31:02] of these virtues flowing out of my life
[1:31:05] that is so
[1:31:08] good that's good like I told you the
[1:31:10] week before and I the the example but I
[1:31:13] don't think I finished it out it's like
[1:31:15] a suitcase you know you don't pack you
[1:31:17] don't pack an empty suitcase on a trip
[1:31:19] you take a suitcase you pack in at what
[1:31:21] you're going to need right but you don't
[1:31:23] get out everything when you get there
[1:31:24] and try to put on all your
[1:31:27] clothes now I know some people in here
[1:31:30] that could wear five outfits a day and I
[1:31:33] won't call their
[1:31:34] name but you see within that suitcase
[1:31:38] when I pack my suitcase to go
[1:31:40] somewhere I get out what I need when I
[1:31:43] need it right let me tell you something
[1:31:46] God's already packed in you all that you
[1:31:50] need the quickening power is what breaks
[1:31:54] the zipper it opens it up and all that
[1:31:58] is in there he begins to bring out
[1:32:00] there's times you say God I got to put
[1:32:02] on patience there's times I got to sink
[1:32:05] into this Garment of Brotherly kindness
[1:32:07] standing in somebody else's shoes and
[1:32:09] trying to think how they think and how
[1:32:11] they feel Lord there's times I need to
[1:32:13] stand there Lord and and have that that
[1:32:15] knowledge Lord that I need to have that
[1:32:17] God is faithful to his word you see all
[1:32:20] of that is packed in
[1:32:22] there but it's not just like you and I
[1:32:25] window shopping and saying I think I'll
[1:32:26] try on a little bit more patience it
[1:32:28] don't work that way it's when adversity
[1:32:31] and test and Trials
[1:32:33] Come is that right because remember for
[1:32:36] this age there is there is a bride
[1:32:38] that's going to sit on the throne
[1:32:39] remember when the sons of zebedee's
[1:32:41] mother asked the Lord Jesus granted that
[1:32:43] one of my sons will sit on the left and
[1:32:44] the right and the Lord Jesus basically
[1:32:47] how the prophet wraps it up and he says
[1:32:48] he said it's not for me to give that
[1:32:50] place has already been given in other
[1:32:52] words the test for for that was not
[1:32:54] going to come in that hour but the test
[1:32:57] would fall in this hour when the bride
[1:32:59] would come to complete
[1:33:02] maturity right it's a queen's position
[1:33:05] so this this call in this pull there
[1:33:08] from the other side it's something
[1:33:10] that's pulling upon our life this is why
[1:33:12] when there's things listen friends let
[1:33:14] me just say it like this the prophet
[1:33:15] made it so simple there within the
[1:33:17] message and he said just like he said
[1:33:20] when Mama is wanting something maybe she
[1:33:22] wanted pickles or ice cream and she's
[1:33:25] expecting you know she was expecting
[1:33:27] Junior daddy made sure he went out and
[1:33:29] got it it didn't matter what hour it was
[1:33:32] Daddy went and got it and Daddy got
[1:33:34] smart enough to say instead of running
[1:33:36] out at midnight let's just buy up a box
[1:33:38] of
[1:33:40] pickles why because there was something
[1:33:43] that was needed for that life that was
[1:33:45] being developed on the inside and this
[1:33:48] is why listen to me now this is why that
[1:33:51] when there are things in the spirit of
[1:33:53] God begins to strike upon a heart and
[1:33:56] God's dealing with a life that son and
[1:33:58] daughter of God on the inside they can't
[1:34:01] explain what's going on it's like Ruth
[1:34:03] in that field but begins to cry out Lord
[1:34:07] Lord give me Grace in this area of my
[1:34:09] life Lord take this out of my life Lord
[1:34:11] give me the strength Lord to rise show
[1:34:13] me the way and the prophet said you
[1:34:16] watch God will anoint a man of God and
[1:34:19] bring him to the pulpit and he'll preach
[1:34:21] exactly according to the very thing
[1:34:24] that's being craved in your life why
[1:34:26] that's God overseeing his children
[1:34:30] coming to
[1:34:33] pass that is so good God God's in charge
[1:34:36] of
[1:34:39] this does that make sense yes God's in
[1:34:42] charge of
[1:34:44] this I know brother Ram I read that
[1:34:46] quote to you last week or a couple weeks
[1:34:48] ago out of how can I overcome and
[1:34:49] brother BR said we we see the weak
[1:34:51] places we see where where where where
[1:34:53] the congregation is and where we should
[1:34:55] be and we ministers we study on that to
[1:34:57] catch where we are to where we should be
[1:34:59] that's true but how does a man of God
[1:35:02] see what needs to be seen unless God
[1:35:05] shows him that's right and even within
[1:35:09] that even with what he sees it has God
[1:35:12] releases what needs to be released in a
[1:35:16] season it can't get ahead of it it it
[1:35:18] could be it could be right on the dot it
[1:35:21] could be but if it's not in season it'll
[1:35:23] will fall right to the
[1:35:25] ground why God has an appointed season
[1:35:29] amen my my my my my so there's a focus
[1:35:32] here go to that scripture there Brianna
[1:35:35] Ruth 2 and verse
[1:35:37] 12 there's a focus I want you to notice
[1:35:40] this where the scripture said here the
[1:35:44] Lord recompense thy Work that's good now
[1:35:48] she's working she's laboring right now
[1:35:51] remember she's this is to gain favor
[1:35:55] right right on now once she comes into a
[1:35:59] place of rest she's no longer laboring
[1:36:03] to gain favor that's right are you with
[1:36:07] me yes sir this is why Works don't stop
[1:36:11] when rest has come that's why the
[1:36:13] prophet said Works itself is really to
[1:36:16] show your
[1:36:17] appreciation of the grace that's been
[1:36:19] given I don't need to do that because
[1:36:22] you won't feel like that well I don't
[1:36:23] need to do that this is not important no
[1:36:24] it's just that you begin you see the
[1:36:26] value and the value keeps on deepening
[1:36:28] that's right that's right yes coming to
[1:36:32] the house of God being in meetings has
[1:36:35] more of a value to me now than it ever
[1:36:36] did I've always believed in it I've
[1:36:38] always I've witnessed it in my own life
[1:36:40] I witnessed how I've walked in here and
[1:36:42] and my mind might be so clouded I'm
[1:36:44] talking about even when I'm sitting here
[1:36:45] and I W I witnessed let me just tell you
[1:36:47] what I've witnessed I witnessed where
[1:36:49] God will anoint the song leader to begin
[1:36:51] to sing songs and I can and the spirit
[1:36:54] of God will help me to catch it hey he's
[1:36:56] singing about while you're feeling right
[1:36:59] now but I'm here to remind you I am not
[1:37:02] going to leave
[1:37:05] you see God has the whole service set
[1:37:09] he's preparing everything set he knows
[1:37:12] what what he's going to do and bring
[1:37:13] forth in our life brother Samuel what
[1:37:15] are you saying I'm saying that the Bride
[1:37:17] of Jesus Christ is not an aimless people
[1:37:21] that just wandering around around and
[1:37:24] I'll feed this and I'll feed this our
[1:37:26] feeding is purposeful intentional under
[1:37:30] the direction of the Holy
[1:37:32] Spirit how can you say that because
[1:37:35] notice and a full reward be given thee
[1:37:38] of the Lord God of Israel under whose
[1:37:41] wings Thou Art come to
[1:37:43] trust that very word Wings is the same
[1:37:45] word of
[1:37:47] skirts she started out under the wings
[1:37:50] but when the wings became manifest come
[1:37:52] on now she slid under the skirt of
[1:37:55] Boaz a full reward be given thee what's
[1:37:59] a full reward friends what are we he for
[1:38:02] why is the word coming forth to make us
[1:38:04] better people in this world no that's
[1:38:07] not the goal that'll be an effect but
[1:38:10] that's not the goal the goal is the
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:16] rapture the goal is the
[1:38:19] rapture and if the goal is the rapture
[1:38:22] then God is giving you and I a word even
[1:38:25] in this season to give us strength to be
[1:38:28] caught away caught away from our own
[1:38:32] ideas catching away from how we've
[1:38:34] always acted I've always went about this
[1:38:36] way catching us away if we're people of
[1:38:38] the Rapture oh god there are quickening
[1:38:41] powers among us to catch us away we're
[1:38:44] not people that's going to continue a
[1:38:46] pattern a cycle of Revival and death but
[1:38:49] we are a people that are anointed for
[1:38:51] rapture
[1:38:54] are you hearing me we're called to grow
[1:38:57] and
[1:38:59] mature that's what this word has brought
[1:39:02] us to Pentecost live to their height
[1:39:04] Wesley Liv to their height Luther Liv to
[1:39:07] their measure but we are called to the
[1:39:10] full measure to the full stature and to
[1:39:12] grow up into him in all
[1:39:17] things and some of those things it's the
[1:39:20] it's uncomfortable but God gives you an
[1:39:23] the grace and he leads us through the
[1:39:26] feeding of the word to give us the
[1:39:28] strength to rise above our own
[1:39:33] Nativity to rise above our past to rise
[1:39:37] above previous molding to rise above
[1:39:40] things that could be buried so deep of
[1:39:43] hurts and complexes and things so deep
[1:39:46] there it's like fossils being dug up in
[1:39:49] the Earth today that could go down so
[1:39:51] deep but the grace of God will reach
[1:39:53] right down in there and bring that
[1:39:55] Deliverance sure does that's right this
[1:39:58] is why I want to say to you this morning
[1:40:00] we are now you hear this scripture said
[1:40:02] over and over we are now the sons of
[1:40:06] God not we're going to be we are right
[1:40:09] now amen the holy spirit is calling the
[1:40:13] sons and daughters that's why this
[1:40:14] message it had that's where it's to have
[1:40:16] an effect this message when it listen
[1:40:19] when we're feeding on the word of God we
[1:40:21] cannot remain the same way
[1:40:23] you can't feed on the divine nature and
[1:40:26] character of God and remain the same way
[1:40:29] there's things that's change that's
[1:40:30] going on in your life your heart's being
[1:40:32] changed your life's being changed you're
[1:40:35] watching change from the inside come to
[1:40:38] the outside why that's what real feeding
[1:40:42] is feeding is not going to church
[1:40:45] getting underneath the anointing and
[1:40:47] walking out that's not feeding cuz the
[1:40:50] Holy Ghost don't feed on anointing
[1:40:53] that's good he feeds on the
[1:40:57] word that's good when the anointing has
[1:41:00] come that is him letting you know he is
[1:41:03] here he's letting you know that he is
[1:41:05] the god of his word he's coming down
[1:41:08] personally for your life that's a time
[1:41:11] not just listen don't just get caught up
[1:41:13] in the moment but say God catch me up
[1:41:16] into you Lord let me be caught away Lord
[1:41:21] from all of my doubts let me be caught
[1:41:23] up into you
[1:41:25] Lord why we want to leave here has
[1:41:28] changed
[1:41:29] people is that right now we are the sons
[1:41:32] of
[1:41:33] God this is why the prophet remember he
[1:41:36] would talk about the New Birth being
[1:41:38] bornn again in his own life and he said
[1:41:40] oh he said when that struck me that day
[1:41:42] and he said and realized I'm not the son
[1:41:45] of Charles Anella brandham I'm a Son of
[1:41:47] God youtie how powerful that Revelation
[1:41:49] is yes it because listen there's a lot
[1:41:52] of claims that could come come down
[1:41:53] through your family and my family that's
[1:41:55] good yes sir Prophet said when I see a
[1:41:57] stubborn Spirit he said I can trace it
[1:41:59] all the way back and there's a grandpa
[1:42:01] or great great grandpa way on down there
[1:42:04] that's so good just gets handed on down
[1:42:07] but let me just tell you something right
[1:42:09] now I am not the I am not going to be
[1:42:12] the basket that's called the what do you
[1:42:14] call the lost and
[1:42:16] found is that all right you know like
[1:42:19] the laundry basket with a thousand pair
[1:42:21] of socks and take two to match them
[1:42:25] up I'm not the laundry basket I'm not
[1:42:27] the I'm not the dirty clothes basket I
[1:42:31] know the prophet called this the human
[1:42:32] grab bag of life but when the Holy Ghost
[1:42:36] is come Hallelujah that's a word of
[1:42:39] authority that no matter what disease
[1:42:42] that no matter what thing that has
[1:42:45] plagued your family down through your
[1:42:47] life no matter what hurts no matter when
[1:42:50] you are taken advantage of there is a
[1:42:53] Grace of all consuming power that comes
[1:42:56] down to bring healing and deliverance in
[1:42:59] your
[1:43:01] life brother there's healing In These
[1:43:04] Wings there's healing in these
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:09] wings that's right now we are the sons
[1:43:13] of God that's why the prophet said one
[1:43:15] of the things he said the reason we miss
[1:43:17] so many blessings is we fail to feed on
[1:43:21] it and what he talking about feeding on
[1:43:24] in that quote he said is this daily
[1:43:27] bread that God has given us now we are
[1:43:29] the sons of
[1:43:31] God wow that's why I think this God this
[1:43:34] is listen this is why the word is coming
[1:43:36] with such a word of authority so that
[1:43:39] when things arise and listen there can
[1:43:41] be things that want to arise listen you
[1:43:43] need to stand there and recognize I am
[1:43:46] not here to display the characters of
[1:43:48] Browning I am here to display the
[1:43:51] character of Jesus Christ
[1:43:53] amen don't back down when the word comes
[1:43:56] don't back down when the test comes but
[1:43:58] stand right there and say now I'm a Son
[1:44:00] of God not I'm going to be in the
[1:44:02] Millennium but right now over this pile
[1:44:05] of dirt and dust God has allowed me and
[1:44:08] given me Grace to rain when my spirit
[1:44:10] wants to go when things want to Harbor
[1:44:12] in my life maybe you're built and Keen
[1:44:15] to handle and harbor unforgiveness and
[1:44:17] bitterness but as a Son of God as a
[1:44:20] daughter of God you recognize I am not
[1:44:22] made to be a receptacle of the enemy I
[1:44:25] am not going to stand here and be a
[1:44:27] servant to the devil I am called as a
[1:44:30] Son of God and though this hurt me
[1:44:32] though it offend me but I'm standing
[1:44:34] here I'm a Son of God right
[1:44:38] now and I'm going to conduct myself as a
[1:44:42] Son of God as a daughter of God by the
[1:44:46] strength of the Holy
[1:44:49] Ghost you're saying what are you saying
[1:44:51] remember he gives us what we have need
[1:44:52] of God will lead us right down the
[1:44:54] pathway he'll lead us right down on
[1:44:56] things in our life Lord I oh my that
[1:44:59] that's stinging that's burning you don't
[1:45:01] understand you don't know when he's
[1:45:02] leading us let's feed because as we feed
[1:45:06] on that word you receive
[1:45:11] overcoming strength so good that is so
[1:45:15] good yes sir that's why the prophet said
[1:45:17] in anointed ones at the end time if you
[1:45:20] haven't fully given yourself
[1:45:23] to feed on this word to where you can
[1:45:26] Fly Above the things of the world will
[1:45:29] you do so at this
[1:45:32] time you see this is
[1:45:36] why the Holy Ghost I want you to listen
[1:45:39] to this quote Branda pull that up with
[1:45:40] you 1965 thir I want you to look at this
[1:45:44] quote very carefully brother brand says
[1:45:46] if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit
[1:45:48] the word of God Jesus said every word
[1:45:51] shall be by the Holy Spirit
[1:45:53] and listen now if you try to feed it the
[1:45:56] wrong thing if it's the genuine Holy
[1:45:58] Spirit in you it'll know the
[1:46:01] difference what's what he's saying if
[1:46:03] you try to feed it the wrong thing if
[1:46:05] it's a genuine holy ghost in you it'll
[1:46:08] know the difference watch what he says
[1:46:10] here's what he he said the word of God
[1:46:12] is what the Holy Ghost feeds on it don't
[1:46:14] feed on enthusiasm no it don't feed on
[1:46:17] education it don't feed on Church going
[1:46:19] it don't feed on theology it feeds on
[1:46:21] the word am because enthusiasm will
[1:46:25] leave
[1:46:26] you are you with me sir if there's
[1:46:29] enthusiasm and joy and it should be not
[1:46:32] because everybody else is in Joy it's
[1:46:34] got to be because there's something
[1:46:35] going on personally with
[1:46:37] you are you hearing me yes let's just
[1:46:40] put let's just put the enemy's voice of
[1:46:42] confusion away amen well I felt the
[1:46:46] anointing and I I I did what the rest of
[1:46:48] them did don't don't get caught in
[1:46:49] somebody else and and what's going on
[1:46:51] there but you listen God's to speak
[1:46:53] personally to you and when God speaks
[1:46:55] personally in your heart if it puts a
[1:46:56] little dance in your step then you're
[1:46:58] more than welcome to
[1:47:00] dance are you hearing me but enthusiasm
[1:47:03] alone will never feed the spirit of God
[1:47:05] and the prophet said if you try to do it
[1:47:08] he'll recognize
[1:47:10] it now let me ask you the question when
[1:47:12] I look at this quote I just meditating
[1:47:15] on these things for some time I look
[1:47:16] over this quote and I look at and said
[1:47:18] God how could it ever be where a person
[1:47:21] you know would try to feed may may be
[1:47:23] the wrong thing how could it be that
[1:47:24] Lord that we could maybe come into that
[1:47:26] place and feed at the wrong thing and
[1:47:28] you know just I begin to look at it and
[1:47:30] and just my heart just meditating
[1:47:32] because a real child of God notice that
[1:47:34] the Holy Ghost is in you you can't feed
[1:47:36] on nothing like you can't feed on on
[1:47:38] enthusiasm theology education and church
[1:47:41] going just going to church won't feed
[1:47:43] you it won't feed you that that's not
[1:47:45] what I've been preaching on about coming
[1:47:47] in meal time just about coming to church
[1:47:50] you can come to church and be a sinner
[1:47:52] you can walk walk out of here and be a
[1:47:54] sinner right you can be the same kind of
[1:47:57] person walking out of here that you walk
[1:47:59] in if you choose to
[1:48:01] be but if you can say God I need help
[1:48:04] there's a call going on in my life Lord
[1:48:07] I want help Lord I want strength Lord
[1:48:10] God that's why I've said friends special
[1:48:13] meetings is not just your meeting every
[1:48:15] service is where it ought to be in
[1:48:17] prayer when we're coming here not just
[1:48:19] showing up and saying well I wonder
[1:48:21] what's on the table this morning but God
[1:48:23] I've got needs in my life
[1:48:25] Lord I want I'm here to make a
[1:48:31] Rapture yes sir you see
[1:48:34] listen this is why we want to have
[1:48:36] everything under the
[1:48:38] blood everything confessed and under the
[1:48:43] blood nothing made an excuse
[1:48:46] for well my daddy was like this my mama
[1:48:49] remember you're sons of
[1:48:51] God hold that banner and don't you ever
[1:48:53] let it down you rally around that Blood
[1:48:56] Stained Banner cuz the moment you let it
[1:48:59] down you doubt your weapon you're
[1:49:01] defeated right he's disarmed you you
[1:49:04] hold that I don't care what you feel
[1:49:06] like and even the pain of the things
[1:49:08] that is going through hold that Banner
[1:49:10] High I am a Son of God let the redeemed
[1:49:14] of the Lord say
[1:49:16] so I'm weak let the weak say I am
[1:49:21] strong amen yes sir defeat is not a word
[1:49:26] in the vocabulary of a
[1:49:30] Christian but you see the only way that
[1:49:33] things can begin to be replaced is when
[1:49:35] there's things that's not right and
[1:49:38] we're trying to eat and feed listen the
[1:49:41] only way you can feed is when
[1:49:43] everything's clean and clear before
[1:49:45] between you and God this is why God when
[1:49:47] they would come into worship I believe
[1:49:49] it's Exodus 32 or 33 when they would
[1:49:52] come in they had to wash their
[1:49:54] hands and their feet before they could
[1:49:59] worship this is why there's our goings
[1:50:01] our
[1:50:03] doings sometimes it's not even the
[1:50:04] things that maybe we've done are falling
[1:50:07] a trap to sometimes it's just the things
[1:50:08] that we just feel so muddled up and
[1:50:10] dirty from Life of things that we've
[1:50:12] heard and seen we didn't ask to hear
[1:50:14] didn't ask to see right spirit's been
[1:50:17] vexed in some way you see sometimes
[1:50:20] that's why we got to say Lord
[1:50:23] I'm here to wash by the water of the
[1:50:25] word Lord I'm a son and daughter of God
[1:50:28] I know what you have made me Lord

[1:50:32] entertained that's went through wrongly
[1:50:34] Lord You Are My righteousness you're my
[1:50:36] Holiness Lord you're all that I have
[1:50:38] need of Lord if there's something that's
[1:50:40] been said or done wrong confess it what
[1:50:42] is it you see out of that labor they
[1:50:44] weren't dipping the water out there was
[1:50:46] it was made to be a running spot right
[1:50:48] there it was running water speaking that
[1:50:50] there's Living Water a Fountain that's
[1:50:53] open in the House of
[1:50:56] David how many glad that we've got a
[1:50:58] place to
[1:50:59] wash Hall and it's not even about you
[1:51:02] coming to 1530 Lake Breeze Road this
[1:51:04] just further puts you and makes you
[1:51:06] aware of it you have an access to that
[1:51:09] at all
[1:51:10] times don't you love
[1:51:12] him think about this here in closing
[1:51:16] what it means to live a separated life
[1:51:19] and feed on the word of God you know
[1:51:22] Daniel Daniel refused the king's
[1:51:24] meat he refused it that's good and he
[1:51:27] chose
[1:51:31] pulse what D what Daniel was refusing
[1:51:34] was is that which is of
[1:51:38] Babylon that's what Abraham did back in
[1:51:40] the beginning when the king of Sodom
[1:51:42] wanted to make him Rich he said I don't
[1:51:44] want nothing what you've got to offer me
[1:51:47] I don't want it I don't want it see he
[1:51:49] was tested in the presence of
[1:51:53] cassic yeah right and here Daniel said
[1:51:57] just just test US 10
[1:52:00] days I think about it it it doesn't make
[1:52:04] sense that this would be this way but
[1:52:06] you see it wasn't just it wasn't
[1:52:08] something natural it wasn't that they
[1:52:10] had some special organic peas back there
[1:52:14] that was off some special organic Vine
[1:52:17] that didn't have any pesticides or any
[1:52:20] no no this was Dan Daniel standing for
[1:52:23] the word of God in a type yes sir to
[1:52:27] where there's things that the world
[1:52:29] would want to hand you or hand me this
[1:52:32] can make your life easier it can make it
[1:52:34] better it could do this but you
[1:52:36] recognize wait a minute I'm not here for
[1:52:39] this I'm here to serve the
[1:52:41] Lord I'll take Paul at the end of 10
[1:52:44] days their flesh was fatter their
[1:52:48] countenances was a whole lot better you
[1:52:51] know why cuz they stood on God's word
[1:52:54] yes amen you take also a man by the name
[1:52:57] of David I want you I want you to hear
[1:52:59] me now you take a man by the name of
[1:53:01] David and David himself in this time of
[1:53:05] 1 Samuel 30 he was greatly distressed
[1:53:08] remember Philistines had come down
[1:53:10] remember they had come and into the camp
[1:53:12] and ransacked the camp and those things
[1:53:15] and taken wives and everything this is
[1:53:18] what I want you to notice here because
[1:53:19] at times whether it's a family a church
[1:53:21] or whatever job and so forth David was
[1:53:24] in a place he was greatly
[1:53:27] distressed the people spoke of stoning
[1:53:30] him right and it wasn't that they hated
[1:53:33] David it's that they were so grieved the
[1:53:37] Bible said because their sons and
[1:53:40] daughters and wives were taken now David
[1:53:45] had a choice as a
[1:53:46] leader David could have fed on what they
[1:53:50] were projecting and himself
[1:53:53] become bitter towards them right that's
[1:53:56] right you hear me now this is this is
[1:53:57] God leading Us in feeding on the word
[1:53:59] this is why sometimes as we come here
[1:54:01] how God will direct us in things he'll
[1:54:04] he'll move Upon Our Lives things to be
[1:54:06] preached within a certain way why he's
[1:54:08] directing us on what to feed on Amen
[1:54:11] right just like when Abigail came to
[1:54:13] David and David man he was he was going
[1:54:15] to take out he was going to take out
[1:54:17] that man naboth he was going to take him
[1:54:19] down and Abigail came and stood in the
[1:54:23] Gap and said I want you to know if you
[1:54:26] go and do this this is going to be on
[1:54:27] your hands when you come on the
[1:54:29] throne
[1:54:31] right she stood right there in the
[1:54:34] Gap like what happened that very thing
[1:54:38] by Abigail turned David from feeding on
[1:54:42] that which was projected to him from
[1:54:45] naboth listen friends you can feed on
[1:54:48] things that is projected at work you can
[1:54:51] even feed well someone so did this or so
[1:54:53] and so don't feed on don't feed on it
[1:54:55] don't feed on it what do what should you
[1:54:56] do turn to the word of God like David
[1:54:59] David said hey hey I don't understand
[1:55:01] this situation there the people are
[1:55:03] grieved at me but n David never took it
[1:55:06] out on the people David turned around
[1:55:08] and said bring me the ephod bring me the
[1:55:10] urum bring me the word of God bring me
[1:55:13] the absolute in this hour this is what I
[1:55:16] need and God told him said hey David go
[1:55:19] on up and recover all what was it God
[1:55:23] directed David on what to feed
[1:55:27] on you have Elijah that's so good how
[1:55:30] many of you ever felt
[1:55:32] lonely felt despair
[1:55:35] Brokenness but God repaired
[1:55:40] Elijah he called him away and Elijah
[1:55:43] went underneath a juniper tree and God
[1:55:46] sent
[1:55:47] down angels with soft hands to rub his
[1:55:51] brow and one that was a good cook to
[1:55:54] make the cakes that was
[1:55:58] needed and when he would get them made
[1:56:01] that's when he would go and wake him up
[1:56:03] hey it's ready come on it's
[1:56:07] ready Elijah was in under the pressure
[1:56:11] remember Jezebel said she would get him
[1:56:14] he was
[1:56:15] running
[1:56:17] yes but God let him
[1:56:20] eat and put him back to sleep
[1:56:23] then he woke him up
[1:56:25] again fed him again and when he fed him
[1:56:28] that second time the Bible said he ran
[1:56:32] for 40 days in the strength of that
[1:56:38] meat and the prophet would say it like
[1:56:40] this he said here we are he said we come
[1:56:42] to meeting after meeting he said if
[1:56:44] there ever was a time that the people of
[1:56:47] God need a juniper tree and need to
[1:56:49] Feast on the word of God it's right now
[1:56:52] amen amen because he said there's a
[1:56:54] battle that's coming to the church it's
[1:56:56] the coming of the Lord what we see
[1:56:58] that's upon us and he said God is going
[1:57:01] to turn his church into
[1:57:04] manhood he said we frolicked we've
[1:57:06] played long enough but God listen that's
[1:57:09] what's so powerful in that quote God is
[1:57:12] going to turn his church to manhood
[1:57:15] that's so good God himself working and
[1:57:19] directing us on the things to feed on
[1:57:23] Amen I could just just keep going and
[1:57:25] going Caleb said if we go after these
[1:57:29] enemies this will be bread for us right
[1:57:32] sometimes the feeding and the eating is
[1:57:35] where we go under the anointing to take
[1:57:39] what belongs to
[1:57:42] us take what God is leading us to take
[1:57:46] Jesus said I got meat to eat that you
[1:57:47] know not
[1:57:48] of is that right yeah so it's feeding
[1:57:52] beeding is is all acting also upon the
[1:57:54] word see when we're taking that word in
[1:57:56] there's an action that comes from our
[1:57:59] life I want you to think of this as I as
[1:58:02] I
[1:58:04] close this is where it comes to where
[1:58:07] even as we go through trials and Times
[1:58:10] of not understanding things taking place
[1:58:12] anybody ever been
[1:58:13] there you don't understand things that
[1:58:16] are taking place don't understand tests
[1:58:19] trials don't understand certain things
[1:58:21] that's right
[1:58:23] that can be one of the hardest times to
[1:58:25] muster the strength I'm talking about
[1:58:27] your human body to muster the
[1:58:30] strength but you know at that moment in
[1:58:32] that time God knows what we have need of
[1:58:35] and sometimes there are things that look
[1:58:37] Elijah couldn't rise and make the cake
[1:58:41] you know how it is when you've been sick
[1:58:42] sometimes you're just glad somebody's
[1:58:43] been there to heat up the chicken noodle
[1:58:45] soup God did for Elijah what was needed
[1:58:49] Elijah couldn't even must it maybe he
[1:58:51] couldn't get his m just set within a
[1:58:53] chapter bring it down to our day or just
[1:58:55] seemed like his mind seemed like he
[1:58:57] going to listen to a message it might
[1:58:58] have been muddled up and just with the
[1:59:00] things that was taking place but here
[1:59:02] God would come down God might send a
[1:59:05] servant sure God can speak to us while
[1:59:06] we're reading the word he can speak
[1:59:08] through us right through the message of
[1:59:09] the hour I believe that I've witnessed
[1:59:11] that many times but I've also witnessed
[1:59:13] times that where it feels like I just
[1:59:15] can't get my mind together and I've
[1:59:17] witnessed how God would take a man of
[1:59:19] God and the spirit of God would come
[1:59:21] down
[1:59:23] and just it's like it's like a breath of
[1:59:25] fresh air it's like a breath of life
[1:59:28] that just moveth back in that puts
[1:59:30] things back in perspective I'm glad God
[1:59:32] does
[1:59:33] that I'm glad God does that at Meal Time
[1:59:38] Ruth come
[1:59:40] hither come
[1:59:43] hither let's spow
[1:59:49] hands Lord Jesus
