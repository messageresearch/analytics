[23:27] despise the low
[23:30] [Music]
[23:35] you love the Lord this morning and it's
[23:39] certainly good to be in the house of the
[23:41] Lord
[23:41] it meant it's good to be gathered
[23:43] together brothers and sisters are like
[23:45] precious faith amen you love the Lord
[23:48] this morning amen amen I know we have
[23:51] God bless you have some visitors god
[23:53] bless you certainly welcome you this
[23:55] morning and we have different ones that
[24:03] are out sickness and then some are also
[24:06] on vacation some different things but
[24:09] we're so grateful to have brother Jia
[24:12] Vaughn Prakash here with us and the
[24:20] Javan Prakash is no he's no stranger
[24:23] among us you know when you get to
[24:27] looking at it you you realize how much
[24:29] time has passed by when brother Jia
[24:32] Vaughn can point out he said when I
[24:33] first met you your daddy your family it
[24:37] was that Greece age so you know it says
[24:45] a lot of times past you know and under
[24:50] the bridge that's 30-some years ago it's
[24:52] like 30 33 33 years ago or so you know
[24:56] but God has been so good to us and we
[24:59] just think the Lord you know for what
[25:01] the Lord is doing you know it sometimes
[25:04] we can only see what we are aware of
[25:06] right here and I believe that we need to
[25:08] expect God to move in our midst and in
[25:11] our lives and we must see that but yet
[25:13] to see that it's the same God
[25:15] sovereignly working throughout his bride
[25:19] his people that he has called for his
[25:23] namesake throughout the world it's a
[25:26] sovereign work of God that's not the
[25:28] ingenuity of man you know it's amazing
[25:33] when you you talk sometimes to those
[25:35] from other places and you know from
[25:37] other things of organizations and things
[25:39] like that and they wonder how in the
[25:42] world
[25:42] is this done well it's simple it's God
[25:47] it's it's not it's not our worry it's
[25:51] just a burden that he's placed on her
[25:53] heart to dedicate our lives to him and
[25:55] it's in his control whatever part that
[25:59] were to play do you realize in a puzzle
[26:01] how many of you have ever put together a
[26:03] puzzle I'm not gonna ask you if you
[26:06] completed it but I you know you you
[26:08] might have been there to kind of see it
[26:09] and you look at it that you know you
[26:11] started looking for pieces there's
[26:13] certain things that you start looking at
[26:15] and one of the first things that you
[26:17] start with on a puzzle is what the
[26:20] border and say God Himself set the
[26:23] border for our life he set the border
[26:26] the parameters in Christ and every piece
[26:29] and every part every piece has a
[26:32] significant partner you can take if
[26:34] there is a missing of one piece on a
[26:36] puzzle and you've labored to put that
[26:38] puzzle together you can look at that
[26:40] puzzle and say oh it's beautiful but
[26:43] just that one piece so you see every
[26:45] piece is important its Christ in you
[26:50] that I need its Christ in me you need we
[26:54] need one another as a body and the body
[26:56] itself is the very reflection of the
[27:00] Lord Jesus Christ because he is the
[27:03] perfect and complete thought of God and
[27:05] we are a part of that thought of him and
[27:10] so every little part is significant to
[27:12] think of it if not for Christ within you
[27:15] my life would be incomplete so as a body
[27:19] we need one another and the purpose is
[27:22] is that he might receive all the glory
[27:25] in the beautiful how God has put his
[27:28] economy together it's just it's so
[27:30] wonderful how God has arranged these
[27:32] things and this morning we want to take
[27:34] up the the mission offering as we're
[27:37] preparing to turn the service to to
[27:40] brother Javon this morning and he has
[27:43] some things to show you and we just
[27:45] can't wait to not only to look at that
[27:47] and to see the work that's going on over
[27:50] there but also that to hear the word of
[27:53] the Lord that's what we've come
[27:55] today how many believe God has something
[27:57] special for you I believe that with all
[28:00] my heart you know I heard somebody say
[28:02] it like this you know there's times that
[28:06] meals were being cooked you know there's
[28:09] times when my mom cooked meals before I
[28:11] went to college and there's some of them
[28:13] Mills you know I just didn't value I
[28:15] looked at all no not meatloaf again
[28:19] carrots you know but one but you know
[28:22] what it was
[28:23] regardless she was thinking of my needs
[28:26] so there was meals being prepared now
[28:29] sometimes now it's different I asked my
[28:31] wife honey what's for dinner tonight
[28:33] then I didn't ask so much now I'll ask
[28:36] but you see what it is is even when I
[28:38] didn't ask she was still mindful and
[28:41] she's still prepared aren't you glad
[28:43] that God is mindful aren't you glad he's
[28:45] mindful of our needs no matter in the
[28:48] midst of everything he's been preparing
[28:50] just what we have need of amen god bless

[1:03:48] pray for me and the pray for the mission
[1:03:50] in India the present government in India
[1:03:53] is a terrible government now in 1947 we
[1:03:58] got freedom from British ours you know
[1:04:01] and the left you know after that you
[1:04:03] know the country was divided and the
[1:04:05] Pakistan was in India Bangladesh was in
[1:04:07] India
[1:04:08] you know and after they left you know
[1:04:10] the country was divided as and today you
[1:04:13] know Pakistan is number one enemy to us
[1:04:15] you know the country of India but anyhow
[1:04:18] you know there are a lot of Christians
[1:04:19] even in Pakistan rhesus brothers and
[1:04:22] sisters you know and pray for them also
[1:04:24] you know and so India is one of the
[1:04:30] oldest country upon this earth if you
[1:04:35] read in the book of Esther it's mention
[1:04:37] about India King Ahasuerus was ruling
[1:04:41] 127 provinces that was from India to
[1:04:45] Ethiopia majority goes to hitlerism 85%
[1:04:50] believes in Hinduism second majority
[1:04:55] goes to Muslims Islamic people and the
[1:04:58] third majority goes to Christians only
[1:05:00] five percent Christians and majorly goes
[1:05:04] to Catholics and very few genuine
[1:05:07] Christians but still the Indian
[1:05:09] government is not happy with the
[1:05:10] Christians by 2021 22 they want to wipe
[1:05:14] out Christianity in India and change the

[1:14:29] Muslim man and he was he was I don't
[1:14:34] believe Jesus Christ died on the cross I
[1:14:36] said you don't believe that he said no
[1:14:40] way he married Mary Magdalene and he was
[1:14:45] in Kashmir in India you know and his you
[1:14:49] know his people are living there his
[1:14:52] children grandchildren they're living I
[1:14:54] said brother what to say you know
[1:14:58] Muslims are hard nuts you can't change
[1:15:03] them unless is used by the Almighty God
[1:15:08] you know and in India it is very hard to
[1:15:11] convert Muslims you know to Christ you

[1:15:17] Pakistan there are a lot of Christians
[1:15:20] you know converted from Muslims you know
[1:15:24] but anyhow I'm talking about India
[1:15:26] you know India over there afraid of
[1:15:29] their religion they're afraid of their

[1:18:47] there's the name of the Lord so this
[1:18:49] morning time I would like to share with
[1:18:52] you about the complete obedience to God
[1:18:58] complete obedience to God now God came
[1:19:04] you know this Abraham and Sarah they
[1:19:06] were old and God promised them they will
[1:19:10] have a son you know and you know
[1:19:15] and you know about Isaac they waited for
[1:19:18] 25 years
[1:19:21] they waited to have one son 25 years now
[1:19:27] he's a human being we want everything
[1:19:29] quick quick quick but they waited for 25
[1:19:36] years my precious brother
[1:19:38] prays the brothers and sisters you know
[1:19:40] and after 25 years God blessed her with
[1:19:44] one son Isaac
[1:19:47] he was hundred she was 19
[1:19:50] you know but God changed her I'm a
[1:19:54] goddess living is a living God is alive
[1:19:59] he's not like other gods after 25 years
[1:20:04] when he was hundred when she was ninety
[1:20:07] God prepared them to have a child which
[1:20:12] was impossible which was impossible he
[1:20:16] couldn't in human history but thank God
[1:20:20] that's why I said we are serving the
[1:20:23] Living God yesterday today and forever
[1:20:26] is the same girl never changes he's the
[1:20:29] creator of heaven and earth - the people
[1:20:32] are making him turn God second God
[1:20:35] Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:20:38] oh they are not three they are not two
[1:20:44] you know when you believe in Trinity
[1:20:47] like the prophet of God said Trinity
[1:20:50] came from the bottomless pit when you
[1:20:54] believe that Trinity when you believe in
[1:20:56] two guards or three guards I want to
[1:20:59] tell you as a man of God you're a worse
[1:21:01] than a heathen
[1:21:03] because the heathens they believe in
[1:21:06] many cars but the Bible said praise the
[1:21:10] name of the Lord since the prophet of
[1:21:11] God came into this world you know we
[1:21:14] opened the Bible the Bible is we can
[1:21:16] understand there are many great people
[1:21:19] they couldn't understand the Bible but
[1:21:21] today by the grace of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:23] Christ through Malachi 4 5 and 6 we can
[1:21:26] understand the Bible very well if you
[1:21:29] read the Bible every day if you pray go
[1:21:32] to your knees God is not going to hide
[1:21:34] anything from you
[1:21:36] because we are is bride we are his wife
[1:21:41] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:21:43] you know the Catholics they say Mary is
[1:21:46] the Queen of Heaven but today is a man
[1:21:48] of God I want to tell you I want to
[1:21:51] declare and I am The Queen of Heaven
[1:21:53] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:21:55] you are the Queen of Heaven
[1:21:57] you people are the Queen of Heaven
[1:21:59] praise the name of the Lord because you
[1:22:01] love the Lord because in the book of
[1:22:03] Isaiah it says your creator is your
[1:22:05] husband
[1:22:06] he's our husband he's going to prepare a
[1:22:09] place for us our days are numbered
[1:22:13] sometimes we say that you know the day
[1:22:15] will the saturn's days are numbered
[1:22:17] even our days are numbered this is not a
[1:22:21] public place for us this is not the
[1:22:24] permanent place for us or we are going
[1:22:28] to return back to our country very soon
[1:22:30] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:22:33] this world is not suitable for branch of
[1:22:37] Jesus Christ
[1:22:38] this world is not suitable for you and
[1:22:40] me this is the wrong place we are living
[1:22:44] there strangers they are just strangers
[1:22:47] they are traveling with Christ Jesus
[1:22:50] praise the name of the Lord but the time
[1:22:52] is coming my precious brother senses
[1:22:54] there is no much time left
[1:22:56] don't look for another years and years
[1:22:59] and here's a no sir because in the sight
[1:23:03] of God the two here two thousand years
[1:23:05] is just like two days so his coming is
[1:23:10] not going to turn race tournament
[1:23:12] we how to have faith in God like Abraham
[1:23:17] he had a faith you know when God said
[1:23:23] Abraham behold Here I am and he said
[1:23:29] take now thy son thine only son Isaac
[1:23:32] whom thou lovest and get thee into the
[1:23:35] land of whom Maurya and offer him there
[1:23:39] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[1:23:42] mountain which I will tell thee off you
[1:23:45] know when God told him take your only
[1:23:48] son he could have he could have brought
[1:23:50] a lot of excuses he could have brought a
[1:23:55] lot of excuses he could have said Lord
[1:23:58] Lord all these years people called me as
[1:24:01] a man of God men of God and if I take my
[1:24:05] son and kill him you know
[1:24:07] people will call me the murderer killer
[1:24:12] Lord I'm not going to do that I'm sorry
[1:24:14] I'm sorry
[1:24:16] then you could have told the Lord
[1:24:20] if I take Isaac and sacrifice him do you
[1:24:24] think his mother is going to keep quiet
[1:24:27] he could have told him Lord said I will
[1:24:30] kill me
[1:24:32] yeah because no mom is going to keep
[1:24:35] shut her mouth you know if somebody's
[1:24:37] taking her child you know her baby you
[1:24:40] know work effort for sacrificing no
[1:24:43] mommy's going to keep quiet if any mom
[1:24:46] is giving quite that means maybe she
[1:24:49] she's a stepmother or maybe she's a
[1:24:51] different person you know but the real
[1:24:53] mother of child she will never keep
[1:24:57] quiet no no no I believe you know
[1:25:04] brother Sam maybe I'm wrong you know I
[1:25:05] think you abraham maybe he didn't tell
[1:25:07] his wife if you were not told you know
[1:25:14] I'm taking Isaac to sacrifice him he
[1:25:18] said no way no way you can't do that
[1:25:22] he's my triangle precious brothers and
[1:25:26] sisters but what happened this man of
[1:25:29] God he was a complete obedient man to
[1:25:31] God he kept first God in his life praise
[1:25:37] the name of the Lord so on the third day
[1:25:40] here the Bible says you know
[1:25:42] on the third day oh my and Abraham rose
[1:25:46] up early in the morning and saddled his
[1:25:48] ass and took took two of his young men
[1:25:51] with him and Isaac his son and claimed
[1:25:55] the wood for the burnt offering and rose
[1:25:57] up and went unto the place of which God
[1:26:00] had told him then on the third day
[1:26:06] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:26:10] place of our afar off and Abraham said
[1:26:14] unto Him his young man a mighty here

[1:26:46] Christians without faith there is no way
[1:26:49] going into the rapture without faith you
[1:26:51] cannot go into the kingdom of God

[1:26:56] of course there are many Christians in
[1:26:58] the world you know whole world the
[1:27:00] majority of Christians are more than
[1:27:02] windows Eden's you know but those kind
[1:27:07] of Christians you know we are not those
[1:27:09] kind of Christians thank God for His
[1:27:11] grace and mercy today we need to pray
[1:27:14] for the Christians in this world you
[1:27:16] know they need Christ they need
[1:27:18] revelation thank God for the revelation
[1:27:22] of Jesus Christ thank God for the

[1:27:48] about Christ only for the namesake you
[1:27:51] know they have a cross here
[1:27:54] you know they claim the Christians and
[1:27:56] they have Christian names they claim

[1:49:15] not into our knowledge not into our mind
[1:49:18] brain but we need Christ here in our
[1:49:22] heart praise the name of the Lord
[1:49:23] lot of people say I'm in the I'm in the
[1:49:26] message I mean I'm in the message are
[1:49:28] you in the message that's a good thing
[1:49:30] to be the message but do you have
[1:49:32] message in your life praise the name of
[1:49:36] the Lord today we need message what is
[1:49:40] message Jesus Christ is the message lot
[1:49:45] of people the talk against the message a
[1:49:47] lot of people that try to find mistakes
[1:49:51] with the Prophet a lot of people they
[1:49:55] try to find mistakes with the message
[1:50:00] but precious brothers and sisters it's
[1:50:04] dangerous first thing you know of course
[1:50:09] there are so many preachers you know
[1:50:10] great preachers they preached on the
[1:50:13] pulpit for thirty years forty years you
[1:50:14] know twenty years but today they are no
[1:50:17] more because they speak against the
[1:50:21] Prophet they try to find mistakes with
[1:50:24] the Prophet of course prophet was a man
[1:50:28] he's a human being you know everybody
[1:50:30] makes a mistake
[1:50:31] nobody's perfect now people are taking
[1:50:35] the the place of God and try to judge
[1:50:38] others in a lighter way it is dangerous
[1:50:43] to touch the anointed of God as far as I
[1:50:49] know the prophet of God
[1:50:52] he has done great things while he was
[1:50:57] walking on this earth and he never
[1:50:59] harmed anybody nobody can stand and say
[1:51:04] oh brother branham didn't come to me no
[1:51:07] he never harmed anybody
[1:51:11] he was the humblest person upon this
[1:51:14] earth
[1:51:16] so if you talk against him God is not
[1:51:20] happy you're in Vegas place so many
[1:51:25] people try to find mistakes with the
[1:51:27] message and the talk against the message
[1:51:33] but today I want to tell you the men of
[1:51:36] God this message is a nothing to do with
[1:51:40] William Marion Branham this message
[1:51:46] belongs to the Holy Ghost when you try
[1:51:53] to find a mis-text with the message
[1:51:56] message is nothing but it's the Word of
[1:51:58] God and the Holy Ghost when you talk
[1:52:03] about against the Holy Ghost message you
[1:52:06] are talking against the Holy Ghost there
[1:52:08] is no forgiveness here or there that's
[1:52:12] what the Bible says don't speak against
[1:52:15] the Holy Ghost don't speak against the
[1:52:21] men of God whose anointed of God
[1:52:25] don't take God's place don't be judged
[1:52:31] we are not judges what we are by His
[1:52:36] grace we need to pray for others very
[1:52:41] easily they talk against the men of God
[1:52:43] and I did of God they don't understand
[1:52:46] they're in a dangerous place let God
[1:52:49] help us my precious brothers and sisters
[1:52:51] oh my let us have Christ in our life it
[1:53:00] was obedience to God
[1:53:07] sure
[1:53:12] you know they want they went together
[1:53:15] and they came to a place where God had
[1:53:21] told him and Abraham built an altar
[1:53:24] there and let the wood in order and
[1:53:26] bound Isaac his son and laid him on the
[1:53:30] altar upon the wood oh my god
[1:53:34] young man fifteen years old young man
[1:53:36] you know you could have attacked his dad
[1:53:47] but when Abraham was binding him you
[1:53:51] know he was like a lamb
[1:53:55] he never said a word to his dad that why
[1:54:00] you're doing this to me and why you want
[1:54:03] to kill me while you're doing this to
[1:54:06] that you know he never said anything he
[1:54:10] was like a damn good lamb he became a
[1:54:14] lamb you know pressure brothers and
[1:54:19] sisters I'm trying I'm traveling in this
[1:54:21] country's Western countries in the
[1:54:23] United States and America in in in

[1:54:29] gave me opportunity to visit them you
[1:54:31] know you know I'm sorry to say you know
[1:54:33] I have seen so many lions and God is not
[1:54:40] happy with the Lions
[1:54:42] he's happy with the Lambs we need to
[1:54:47] become lambs we need to become dowse God
[1:54:54] loves the Lambs that's the reason the
[1:54:58] Almighty God left his throne glorious
[1:55:02] throne he came to this world as the Lamb
[1:55:04] of God he took your place and my present
[1:55:09] and the people in the world he died on
[1:55:14] the cross of Calvary he sacrificed his
[1:55:17] body on the cross of Calvary

[1:55:24] heaven and earth nobody can kill him
[1:55:29] sometimes we say oh the wrong wrong
[1:55:31] killed him or you know but you know Jews
[1:55:37] are Israelite in heresies and services
[1:55:39] he is the Almighty God you know he gave
[1:55:43] his life for you and me
[1:55:46] nobody could have touched him but he
[1:55:51] dedicated his life he came to fulfill
[1:55:54] the scripture he died on the cross for
[1:55:56] you and for me he was buried and third

[1:56:49] heart we are the real temple of God you
[1:56:53] are the genuine temple of God anyhow
[1:56:57] here
[1:57:04] time is running almost one o'clock I'm
[1:57:07] closing it now I I believe in time I
[1:57:10] always take 45 minutes one over but
[1:57:13] because of that you know so it took a
[1:57:15] little more time I'm sorry about that
[1:57:18] you know anyhow so here in message
[1:57:22] called paradox
[1:57:25] prophet Christian 62 he says Abraham
[1:57:29] when he was on top of the mountain with
[1:57:31] his only child only child oh my god
[1:57:37] waited for 25 years only child
[1:57:42] Oh Abraham Sarah loved him like anything
[1:57:48] you know and brought him up you know and
[1:57:50] you know took care of him you know for
[1:57:53] everything only child
[1:57:56] one day God comes and says Abraham take
[1:58:01] your child take your son and and and you
[1:58:06] know sacrifice
[1:58:09] anyhow he waited for 25 years
[1:58:17] he had waited for 25 years to get the
[1:58:19] child and then when the child was about
[1:58:22] 14 years old
[1:58:25] sorry 14 years old I said 15 God told
[1:58:29] him what is what was he doing this for
[1:58:33] now to confirm that God keeps his word
[1:58:37] no matter how is unreasonable it seems
[1:58:40] he still can perform and make a paradox
[1:58:44] he said take this little 14 years old
[1:58:49] boy of yours take him up on the mountain
[1:58:54] and offer him up for a sacrifice and he
[1:58:59] took him up under the mountain he was a
[1:59:04] man of faith
[1:59:06] Abraham was a great hero faith he knows
[1:59:11] what God told him before he gave Isaac
[1:59:15] to him he said can you come can you
[1:59:18] count the sand on the ocean
[1:59:23] he said no Lord not possible I will make
[1:59:28] your like a sand your generation
[1:59:35] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:59:38] Abraham knows you know even though he
[1:59:43] sacrifice it God is going to raise him
[1:59:46] he knows that and that's the reason he
[1:59:51] never cushion God he was not Oh an
[1:59:54] obedient to God praise the name of the
[1:59:57] Lord here knowledge system and now if
[2:00:00] that him being then about a hundred and
[2:00:04] fifteen years old I Brown was 115 years
[2:00:08] old waited 25 years on the boy and here
[2:00:11] the boy and he was going to destroy the
[2:00:13] only evidence he has of seeing this
[2:00:17] promise of God to the father of the
[2:00:20] nation's ever taking place and then he
[2:00:25] asked to destroy that that the reason he
[2:00:29] called the place Jehovah Jarrah but when
[2:00:32] he was just about ready to fall on line
[2:00:36] with the complete obedience and the holy
[2:00:40] go holy spirit caught his hand
[2:00:44] maybe there was a knife in his hand you
[2:00:46] know to kill ice and the prophet of God
[2:00:53] said ready to fall in line with the
[2:00:55] complete obedience to God the Holy Ghost
[2:00:58] the Holy Spirit came caught his hand and
[2:01:05] Ram britta'd behind him hooked by its
[2:01:09] cones in the wilderness what was it a
[2:01:11] paradox
[2:01:14] he was he was trying to you know you
[2:01:17] know sacrifice him you know that maybe
[2:01:19] the Holy Ghost chemical and only desire
[2:01:22] maybe Ibraham is doing Princeton you
