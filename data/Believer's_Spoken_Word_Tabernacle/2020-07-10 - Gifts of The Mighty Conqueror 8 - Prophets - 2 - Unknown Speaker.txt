more family man boy my voice is really this it's not working with me tonight amen let's sing that song i pledge allegiance to the land amen you know this past weekend you know we you know we honored you know this nation the founding of this country and no doubt many people around the world pledge allegiance to the flag you know and you know i'm thankful for that i'm thankful for the country that we live in but even though it's it's a mess right now it's all falling apart but i'm thankful that we can say pledge allegiance to the one who who did it all i'm so thankful for that i mean just just think of that amen wonderful [Music] but i have heard how christians long ago they were brought before a tyrant song and they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of christ but one by one all they chose to die for the son of god they would not deny like a great angel quiet your sins i can almost hear their voices ring that we pledge allegiance to the mammal with all my strength with all i am i will seek seek to honor his command yes for i pledge allegiance [Music] to oh now the years have come over the years they have gone woah but the cause of jesus it still goes on and now our time has come oh just to count the causal to reject laodicea oh and to embrace the cross and one by one or let us live our lives for the one who died for just to give us love to the trump itself on that day yes let us proudly stand yes let us both say that i pledge allegiance to the level with all all my strength yes god with all that i am and i will seek i will seek to honor his command oh yes i pledge allegiance to [Music] the second verse to sing that one said oh now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of my jesus tonight it still goes on and now our time your time has come tonight to count the cause just to reject this whole world and we must embrace the cross and one by one lord let's live our lives for the one who died he died just to give you life until the trumpet sounds on that final day yes lord let us proudly stand yes and boldly say that we pledge pledge allegiance to the land o with all our strength with all i will seek seek to honor kiss come in oh [Music] one more time i pledge allegiance oh yes i pledge allegiance [Music] too [Music] oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen what a what a blessing and an honor it is that he would ask us to give everything over to him you know just just heard this morning just listening to brother branham in the first part of hebrews and he said you know whenever he said you're going to be a christian be one completely give everything you've got every talent everything let it all be given to the lord think of these when i sing this song i know brother branham he tells us when we get there on that other side and to think that those who lived in those earlier ages they'll look us up say what age did you come out of and they will say how did you do it yet they know because they overcame also by the same one but i want you to think of the spirit of christ and how that will move as they would look for us and say how did you do it we want to hear your testimony we look back at them and say oh i can't wait to meet jeremiah i can't wait to meet paul i can't wait to meet them because what it is that we see in them as we see that standard of christ and i believe we we see that in the body of jesus christ right here on the earth if there's one thing one desire that would stir up in my heart we can look at one another it's not to be like somebody but it's that that how christ is reflected in that life oh god let it be reflected in me that way that's what real fellowship does it really it challenges not be great it challenges it's something that just encourages our life amen that christ would be the center of all these things don't you love him tonight amen i'm so grateful for his grace tonight let's just let's go to him in a word of prayer heavenly father lord as we just come before your throne tonight once again lord what a privilege it is to be in your in the house of the lord a place that you have given to us lord that we can come and gather and to hear the word of the lord dear god we're thankful and lord we we don't want to just lightly take these moments lord your prophet told us he said one day there'll be fond memories we want to lord everything within our hearts we just oh god want to take this opportunity you've given us not just lord to be captured by it but us to capture it as well may we not be as lord just hearers of the word but god may we be found as doers of the word lord to look into the word of god into the perfect law of liberty lord taking account of our lives and looking to the very one o god who's present to change us from glory and to glory to transform us o god and lord we just ask that you'll just be with your children no matter where they're gathered some that are at home those of us that are here father and we ask oh god for your continued protection during these times lord we're trusting in you lord and we just ask god for your leadership we're just asking god that you would just be with us lord as we go lord not only to the house of god we go to our places of work we go lord to have to buy the groceries lord this is where we've been we've been just trusting in you so lord we just ask god for your continued leadership will you come lord and just take your word and speak to our hearts tonight we need to hear from you lord may you come lord and give understanding to our hearts lord we love you and we just appreciate your father in the name of jesus christ amen amen may god bless you let's turn in our bibles to ephesians 4. i hope you're not getting turned tired of turning there because we've got some we've still got some ground here but i want to just bring you back into those places and god has a purpose for the ministry that he's given god has a purpose for every one of his children in the body of jesus christ and so let's look here in ephesians 4 verse 7 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascendeth up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all thing and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers may god bless the reading of the word bless you as you're being seated paul would go on and we for sake of time will not read on there from verse 12 through verse 16 but the whole purpose it's the working of the ministry of jesus christ the word working and becoming preeminent in the body of believers and there's a there's god has within it a reason and a purpose of what he's doing paul would come into another place in first corinthians 12 27 and say now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god hath set in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers and he goes on from there and i want to continue tonight to look at that thought if god will just help us there's no way that we'll get we'll get finished with this tonight but on that thought of prophets and to see of how that god as we looked at last week not that we would need any convincing of this but to recognize that god has indeed had prophets in the new testament and we we see that within the scripture i know that to be uh many times many of you have come in contact with uh people who have taken those scriptures like we looked at it last week where it says the law and the prophets were until john but that in itself to take it and just to say that there's no more prophets is an error because god has showed that there were he first of all he gave these gifts unto the church and and it is shown throughout the scripture now when we looked at it last week we were looking at the term prophets and i'll read go into something here in just a moment when we know that that word in in just in the dictionary and in the english it means one who is to tell forth foretell or to preach and so we we recognize that every new testament prophet is a preacher every preacher is a new testament prophet but one of the things that's very clear god has set forth and i'm not going to get into this tonight but god set forth here the working where here we find john the baptist would be a prophet that would come that would be a keystone of between the old and the new and then we find the lord jesus himself being the god prophet the prophet of all prophets and then when the word is come uh in the outpouring of the holy spirit to remember that the gentiles themselves that paul was set aside by god as a prophet to the church of the living god not just a preacher but one who would receive the word of the lord and would separate and divide and bring together law and grace and to tie together the entire bible and that that how god would even begin that for the gentile age god held a promise in his word you may have said here for a long time you may have been acquainted with it for a long time but to recognize that god placed a promise in his word or from the old testament and in many places all the way in the new how that he would visit us in this hour with a prophetic ministry it was all with us to declare that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't just let that be a phrase it is the same god of what he was before he's not changed at all men has changed him and they and because of that that's why the sickness and disease are among their people but when he is preached and known to be the same he is still the bowman gilead that brings healing to wounds he's the same one that can take lives that that brother branham i think as he said it today when i was listening he said to where the devil even refuses the people he's used them in such a way but god will come right down and say thou take that life and i'll reflect my glory god takes a hold of that life and god would take a life that the world would say nowhere for him and everything but god comes down by his amazing grace and will sweep into that life and so transform that life he'll take what was such an outcast and god by his life will bring to light and reality the saint of god that's trapped on the inside oh there's no liberty outside of jesus christ so when we look at this with with prophets i want you just to i'm going to just let me just make this statement and then i'll move on brother branham what i'm getting ready to read from here in july of 63 brother branham himself even in earlier parts of the ministry even when he had the uh ministers together in the message taking sides with jesus and he would speak to them and he would say now brethren i'm not a prophet and he would go through this and lay it out and this is why he said because here i am operating like an evangelist and you can't mix the two offices now remember hearing his understanding is coming out that his understanding of a prophet he's looking back at the old testament and seeing an old testament prophet he's in the wilderness he says he doesn't hold meetings he doesn't pray for the sick he doesn't have healing campaigns he's looking at all that and god this is in may of 62. but the but the holy spirit notice the work is still going on but god in 1963 there uh in the standing in the gap this is where the holy spirit points out to the prophet because he's saying you said i'm a prophet lord i i don't see how i fit that bill from the scripture god has to open his understanding and say that was the old testament prophets you've been called to a higher office you are a new testament officer and you are new testament prophet you've been given more gifts than them this he said is the apostolic form so then this is where we begin to find the balance god will deal relative to one man it is a one-man message in the old testament there was not ministry going out under that of apostles and evangelists and teachers but over here in the new testament there is all of the ministerial gifts that go forth from under that ministry of the prophet that's an important revelation within them so to see that when brother randall now will hear these these parts you see as he's growing because remember a prophet only knows what god reveals to him a prophet can stand and look at something god shows him and he'll look at it he doesn't know what it is unless god interprets it for him is that right zachariah seen again the lamp stands what is this i don't know what is it right john on the isle of patmos sees those in white robes not just that's just one of many places and he says john what is this thou knowest what is it you see a prophet is an instrument a vessel used by god that god is the one who reveals to that prophet oh my i feel like shouting right now you see that prophet is not going to a school of theology or some man's thought he's lifted above the thoughts and ideas of man because the ideas and thoughts of man can pervade but god in his grace will lift that man up and he will begin to see the things that's necessary and come back and report them to the children of god oh my let me read here god he says he says a real genuine prophet is a special person not a special you know be any different from anybody else but he's got a special job he has a special commission he's got to be special a little out of the way from the others in order to do that just like god is liking this prophets to be an eagle now an eagle is a special bird he's just a bird but he's a special bird he can fly higher than other birds he can see farther than other birds and now in order to go higher he's got to be built so he can go higher and what good would it do to him to go up there unless he could see what he was doing after he got up there so he has to be special built bird he he's kind of in the hawk family he's a ripper of the bill and he said many of them are scavengers there's about 40 different kinds of eagles but the prophet is a special man a prophet is a man whom the word of the lord comes to because the prophet is so designed in his life that his subconscious and his first conscience is so close together that he doesn't go to sleep to dream his dream he sees it when he's wide awake now that's something god has to do see he sees what's going on it's very important he sees what god's doing god's got a vessel on earth that god can speak to in this way hallelujah a prophet foresees way off see the things that is coming he sees the cup of god's wrath full before it's filled you catch that he sees it full before it's filled i don't know how many of you have recorded you know as i'm going through and just you know you just listen to the message listen the message even with everything that's been taking place it's this has not just happened just now it's happened to me many times before it sounds as though the prophet is right here but you know why because it's not brother branham it is the same angel of the lord he which was which is and which is to come [Applause] he's identifying things there that are in seed form like brother brahma says in satan's eden think of it i mean here satan's eating and then uh evening messenger and he talks about boys walking through the playground with their britches hanging down i don't know i don't think that took place in the 60s right that inspiration came out of prison we need to be careful what we're inspired by amen there's a living image of a living god just like when that little eagle he was told to look up it was a pamphlet he saw he saw a living eagle he saw a being that he was are you with me oh glory so he can say thus saith the lord god will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way up in yonder and he looks way off there and he sees that cup of wrath poured out that's what the prophets look at he ain't looking at what's going on here he's looking yonder what a lesson for us why would we look here when we had greater eyes come why would we get caught up with what's going on around us let us focus on the true vision the things that we see are what temporal but those things that are the unseen are eternal oh it says you can see he says it's coming he can see uh so high till he can see that shade that darkness he said the world would be darkness and gross darkness he's up high enough the sun's shining now but he sees that shade coming he's saying what he's looking at it ain't here yet but it'll sure be here it's going to be here gross darkness upon the people we can truly say this day this scripture is fulfilled gross darkness when people don't know what they are not even able to make sound reason judgments darkness upon the people what is it it's the spirits that have been released darkness and it has been made available because of the false teachings that they've been under gross darkness upon the people he knows it's coming years away yet he sees it he goes into amos he said amos he was that anointed prophet of god he saw the darkness and the judgment he seen syria come down with their chariots and sweep through there slaughter them people out he saw it coming and the judgment of god upon them 50 years before it happened being a prophet he was lifted up i want you just to catch this here we'll work with this tonight being a prophet he was lifted up into the spirit and he saw it far off he saw the cup full before it was filled a prophet is born a prophet let me just say it not only as a prophet born a prophet evangelist pastor all of them it's not hands being laid on that puts the gift in the laying on of hands is simply to recognize what god has already testified is that right when david was anointed king it was because the testimony had already went before see that's what real true listen to me this is just a little that's what real true voting is in the assembly when it's voted on a pastor or this or that it's to identify what god has already identified the vote is not a political thing that's why the church of the living god is not a democracy it's a theocracy oh i know that stumbles some people but that's the reality it is it is people who are in tune with the spirit of god and to recognize what god has placed before them that's the same way when it comes to deacons trustees and on and on suddenly it's god it's identifying what god has placed here that's free a prophet is born a prophet uh brother branham would bring this so clearly because of the confusion take us right back into the scriptures to show the difference that that that that the spirit of prophecy is is the holy ghost the testimony of jesus christ in the church and how that the gift of prophecy is one of the nine spiritual gifts not belonging to anybody but meals throughout the body but the brain said it could fall on this one tonight and never again and fall over on this one the next night same with every every one of the nine spiritual gifts but but a prophet of god remember a gift of prophecy is to be judged before it's ever received that's scripture is that right but a prophet nobody stands before a prophet so there's there is god giving a declaration and a witness in his word to the children of god that indeed this is my prophet now brother branham he picks this up in the voice of the sign and he says now the english word a prophet just means a preacher anybody every every preacher is a prophet because he is foretelling something preaching the word under inspiration is called a prophet but in the old testament they were more than that they were seers he's bringing it now down into our day what god has promised in our day it says that now they were man who told things that was coming to pass they give him the rights that give him the rights to be the interpreter of the word for that day because god took the word of that day and interpreted it himself through that man it goes on the same things that we had mentioned before and in paragraph 83 says the entire bible was wrote by the prophets in first peter chapter 1 verse 10 i know i'm being very deliberate but i want to lay these in i don't want to so much preach it i want to lay it in and teach it in verse 10 of which salvation now he's talking about the coming of the messiah all the bank of prophecies i want you to think of it when brother brown talks about walking how that when cleophius and the other disciple were walking on on the road to emmaus remember here the lord jesus the resurrected lord jesus christ steps out and begins to walk with them they are sad they are downcast yet they've been a part of the very ministry of the messiah but there are pieces that has not been tied together for them and when those pieces are not tied together they were sad but he steps out think of it you know brother adam says in christ the mystery this six hour eight hour sermon he took all of the prophecies that was there from the law the prophets the psalms my you could spend hours on the book of isaiah alone let alone all the rest and to think he began to speak to them all the prophecies even concerning the sufferings and everything that was to be fulfilled he made clear to them events that were taking place he had tied it in its prophecy he tied in what is happening has already been spoken what was spoken is what was already seen before the foundation of the world he's tying events together is that right now this is where in first peter 10 this is what peter is speaking and notice how peter would write this of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come to you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow so what was in the prophets the spirit of christ the same one who created a body that he might come down and redeem us so it was not the prophet speaking by their own will but they were set aside moved upon by the spirit of god it was the spirit of christ in them identifying his own working and his own pathway so if it was the spirit of christ in the prophets to announce or to prophesy of what was coming it would take the same spirit of christ to come and fulfill it in the lives of those who that word was ordained to come to pass in all glory be to god unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us did they minister these things notice it was revealed but yet they saw not all things it was open it was revealed to them as much as god would show them but they were certain in what god had revealed to them they didn't have to see all of the folds opening up or all the parts they were certain in what god had revealed oh glory aren't you glad you could say the same thing i'm certain in what god has revealed i may not see everything i may not understand everything but i know what god has revealed is right now for this time i am anchored to that unseen realm oh glory be to god oh how precious is that anchor in this hour oh yeah you remember in the days of paul there were men on the ship on the ship when they were going and you know they come up on the island there were men on the ship who came under disguise to try to get rid of uh the anchor and try to get rid of all these other things but the spirit of god revealed it to paul and said ah tell these men don't you go that way don't you go this way get back in the ship why because if you don't abide in the ship it's death all who remain will be safe what is that speaking of there is no other place of safety than in jesus christ under the blood [Music] when we don't have we're not operating under disguise brother it's been revealed who we really are i'm not under a disguise we're not under a disguise let that in the book of revelations who's all decked up and painted up and has all these crosses and everything she is a faker she is under a disguise but the spirit of god comes down and reveals you and i it's not something we're putting on serving god it's a reality he is my own and all he is my life he has changed me [Music] glory be to god oh my unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into now let me just maybe refer to this instead of reading it you can read it when you get home but out of exodus 4 when god calls moses there's a promise god made to abraham that i will visit them after 400 years god gets moses separated unto himself imagine moses felt pretty lonely he'd been run out of egypt after his mama had told him he had went to sunday school he had memorized all the seven messengers he had memorized all the sevens come on now he had all of those things down pat he knew you know the different supernatural acts in the life of the prophet he had heard the ministering you're a special person a god has ordained you he had heard that but here he is trying to go about it in his own strength he's trying to live it by what he's learned and yet on the inside does not match up with what the words calling for in other words he doesn't have a heart that's been turned to this word he's got a mind that knows it but a heart that's not been turned so god has to bring him and cause him to be exiled from egypt the very place that he could say i'm supposed to be there but god says but first of all i've got to strip you i've got to clean you and then i've got to equip you and you've got to become my prisoner because you're still a prisoner of your own will so god called moses this was a conference out here moses didn't understand he didn't know what was going on he had forgot everything everything had been lost he just had forgotten he was going on about his life but one day he's out there with the sheep and he looks up and it catches his attention god knew he would pass that way and god hear the very fire it's in that bush and it doesn't consume the bush that phenomenal the supernatural it takes a hold and gets moses attention he comes up before it and he takes off his shoes he takes off and he lays down before it but you see just taking off his shoes was not going to be enough that was a good start come on somebody but it had to come to a place to where he would completely lay down his own life his own will his own thinking oh god us this is almost just low tongue lord i i i gotta can't can't talk lord god had to say are you willing to get weaker i didn't call you because you were a man of eloquent speech i called you because i foreigned you from the foundation of the world your weaknesses think about this in the presence of god his weaknesses shine forth you never hear mittens mention of the weaknesses while he's down in egypt but once he gets in the presence of god every weakness he has becomes exposed brother there's nothing like the presence of god it knocks all the dirt and the rubbish and the trash it makes us realize we're nothing but 84 cents worth of dirt but there's a greatness a grace that god has placed on the inside if it can get us in a place to yield ourselves all it takes is a yielded life he could not listen brother braham said he could not feed the five thousand if the little lad had not given him the lunch he took something that was there and transformed it but it had to be given to him aren't you glad that god moved upon your heart and you said lord all i've got is a little lunch all i've got is a is a little faith lord i have a little faith to believe that you're the same he said give it to me surrender it in my head i'll take that little faith i'll multiply it from faith unto faith from righteousness unto righteousness i'll transform your life hallelujah here he is before this bush god speaks to him he lets him know there's going to be two signs that's given and every sign there's going to be a voice i want you to listen to me every sign there's going to be a voice god don't send signs to be sending signs he's speaking god through a sign is getting the attention to say i'm wanting to speak personally in exodus 4 i just i just have to pass over that but i've just referred to that verse 8 can i read that one it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign see god's mercy he didn't have to give multiple signs but this is god's mercy and his compassion egypt's not going to receive it but his elect will and remember the hardest thing god has ever had to do is get one mortal to believe another mortal that's why we must have the supernatural glory be to god and it shall come to pass watch if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river notice things that they need you shall take from it and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou take us out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land what was it judgment if they reject judgment is poured out upon the land blood would be poured out you see all the way think of this characteristic i know some of these things may seem to be redundant but i think it's not only good review peter said as long as i'm with you i want to stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance but i think it's good that also we have new ones young ones that are among us that they hear this everywhere you look in the scriptures elijah the tishbite where did he come from yeah who's his father or mother moses moses comes from amram and yoshi we have that that's one of the few of the prophets never in the scripture do the prophets step from out of the church the organizational system they come outside of that because why god can't speak to him inside of there this is why god had to pull out the prophet in this hour and then remember god did not open and loosen the seals in a denomination it was on the outside why christ suffered without the gate we must go to him without the gate the prophet comes to call the people back to the word from which they drifted you never read the old testament prophets and them coming and patting people on the back oh everything's all right you're the blessed of the lord you're the the false prophets you do peace oh peace everything's gonna be all right it's gonna be all right false prophets now i know we got them whether prophets media prophets oh they're all false prophets but i'm talking about false prophets in the church too why they are not bringing the people to the world before you can ever come to the way first of all before you can ever get where you need to be you have to repent a lack of repentance will gain no entrance so the prophet has come to do what call the people back to the word brother tells us he said the reason god will send a prophet he said because people get away from reading their bibles i look at that statement and i ponder does he mean that they were not going through and reading them at all perhaps they're not reading their bibles but perhaps they're not reading them meaning they're not having relationship they're not letting the word really penetrate their lives and god what does he do he sends a prophet to do what get the people back to the word that they've already been given it makes known the supernatural god is among them moses failed with his natural thinking but when he became yoked and tied to the word by the supernatural god brother there was a lot of opposition that came his way but he had an anchor he had a hole in his life that held him when situations got bleak he could go to the lord even when things were not happening according to his thinking he had an anchor that was greater than his thinking oh i thank god for the holy ghost the prophets when they come and every time they come the systems the ecclesiastical systems condemn them they condemn they want to tear them down the same way you see this parallel the same way that god deals with taking an individual like as he took elijah and he reveals himself to elijah calling to call the people back to the word god here making himself known to an individual to to elijah that's the same way god does with us as individuals it's not a church revelation it's not a group revelation oh praise god i'm in the message no no is it in you are you in jesus christ have you been born again god does not call this is not a collective revelation it's not a group thing this is a personal identification is that right that's what the holy ghost comes to it comes to personally identify you oh glory be to god oh my my my mind let me read here the scripture out of deuteronomy 18. and then we'll move to some things in deuteronomy 18 verse 15. here here is moses speaking by the holy spirit the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brother and like unto me unto him ye shall hearken he's speaking of the messiah according to all that he that thou desirest of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire anymore then i die not and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken now remember god came down and moses said as they responded no don't let god speak no more let moses speak and moses said god has come to prove you that you might fear him why because when moses would speak they may not hear the rune and but it was the same god it was god now thundering through a human voice are you with me now it was thunders coming out through that of a voice oh glory so here now look at this here they could be looking they could say oh the lord thy god he's gonna raise up a prophet but remember the spirit of christ was in the prophets it was testifying jeremiah was a portion isaiah was a portion each of them they were not taking away but when the elect heard it it only put them in tune for their day and they were tied to that prophecy those that got up on that easter morning with him were those who were tied to this prophecy they had heard the voice of god in their day it was not ritual oh it's time to go up for this feast oh it's time to do this oh it's time to do that oh no no it was not a ritual life it was an effectual life yeah you you read those in the old testament they they heard god's voice there was a reference they were moved with oh brother and sister don't let this become common to you and i let's be referenced as the bible said let us have reverence grace that we might serve him with reverence notice he said i will raise them up a prophet i will raise them up a prophet from among the brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord had not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him you see the word when a prophet would speak the light of the urine the breastplate of aaron if this was of god and they brought him before it was to make all of this light up is that right if it didn't light up you could say you're lying i don't care how much you feel about your line is that right so here notice now to think that what they spoke had to flash and light up with those burst stones that are there right how much more is the testimony of the holy ghost in our life it should flash with the word it should be a flash with the word about what god has spoken he is manifesting oh glory this is why remember with jesus when he would stand there he says you called them gods whom the word of the lord come to prophets receive the word of the lord jesus said my sheep they know my voice i want you to listen to this here the brahmana says if the voice is that a voice of the sign if the voice come the same old voice he said you see a sign rather and that sign that the man is doing is the same old school of thought then you can say right then that didn't come from god if it's the same old school of thought if it keeps identifying the same old school of thought it never did it never has it would be against god's program i don't care how much a man can have signs and wonders in his ministry but if he denies the word of god and he holds the same old voice of ideas from the past that have been presumptive idols god didn't send it there can be devils cast out sick that are healed but remember that's their stock they stock their livelihood in that did we not cast how devils in thy name have we not preached in thy name prophesied in thy name you see they are relying on the gift in their life instead of the word testifying of them that's why god had to send a message in this hour it was not a new something different but it was to tie us back in to the faith of the apostolic fathers that our hearts would be anchored brother we would know where we're standing hallelujah oh i feel like preaching it's listen to this this and this let me just let me just speak on this a little bit it's got to be something new let me just keep reading here it's got to be something new it's got to be something that the people don't understand or it wouldn't be sent it don't need to be sent it's the same old school theology it's got to be something different yet it's got to be identified in the word that it is for that day the positives of god's word it has to be that there's no slip ups to it it's got to be the truth got to be vindicated by god the truth and the man who speaks it has to be vindicated of god to be a seer from god or it's wrong and they don't even see it at all don't even believe it god vindicated thoroughly this ministry of malachi 4. all these other false prophets and these liars are saying oh this and that and this and that where's your vindication in the word don't just show me signs and wonders show me vindication in the world show me live that are transformed by the power of god that are placed and identified and connected with jesus christ because a false prophet will take a gift and try to bind people to himself and bangs them under fear but the spirit of god will come through the word and guide people into the true atonement which brings peace oh glory be to god in the highest signs are from god the signs that follow the voice that follows the sign must be the voice of god speaking from the word for that age god gives signs what does he do it for always give signs he told them that that's what they'd look for in him the signs god gives signs listen now to attract the attention of his people he said let's study this thoroughly signs are given to attract the attention of the people because when a god-sent sign is given god is ready to speak god is ready to speak when the sign is given if it comes from heaven it's from god and god is ready to speak he's trying to attract the people's attention there's a purpose god's not showing off it's a purpose and the word comes to his prophet and the prophet is identified by the sign that he shows and then he comes to the word and the word is made manifest that settles it it don't need any interpretation god has already interpreted it's just as perfect as it can be now the bible says in hebrews 1 1 god who at sunder at times and it divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers in the prophets by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed the heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds now notice in second peter chapter 1 verse 20 see it was god's pattern speaking in his prophets noting knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost think of the humility amos said i'm not a prophet nor am i the son of a prophet it was humility they were not vouching for positions oh think when the fountain shall be opened in the house of david the bible says in the book of zechariah those that are wearing that mantle cloth of a prophet will take it off and say i'm no prophet why they recognize that there's only they're one in humility to lay down it says to cast aside their idols and their lies and all those things why they're in the presence of the living god amen in the wonderful what the fountain does open in the house of david here it allows us to cast off all of those things like i used to have this idea about heaven i used to think when we got to heaven we were like this it allows us to cast it off why it's a fountain that's open in the house of david oh blessed be the name of the lord holy men spake as they were move caught up from one place to another by the holy ghost let me just refer to this because i don't have the time to just yeah i want to read it but this is why brother branham he'll go in he said god likened his prophets to an eagle now god he says notice he says in the impersonation of christianity god likened the prophet to the eagle that would go in the makeup of a prophet he's a seer that in the spirit he climbs beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that god brings him up into a realm alone alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see things that is to come then he brings him back down among the members of the body to foretell them of what's in the making he said see how god took ezekiel high up he said a prophet is also a gift of knowledge look at this a knowledge is like an attorney who studies the books and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're paying for what he knows to present your case before the judge aren't you glad that we're not under a guess so this is not a guess so brother this right here here he who was a judge become our attorney and that same one is revealed in the prophetic ministry to do what establish us that we can know where we're standing glory be to god it's a spirit of truth now bill graham says then now watch this statement he says then the word that god has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that god speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is that the prophet catches what god has already said did you catch what he said he said it isn't that god is speaking to that prophet right then it's god is catching that prophet up into what he has already said for the word was before the foundation of the world god spoke the word and it's laying way out stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and sees the time coming see it's only a gift of knowledge that he brings down and puts it on paper she's going up jacob's ladder here now notice he talks about isaiah isaiah you know he he foreseen these things before the foundation of the world let me go here you know uh and sirs we would see jesus he said now the bible is just a prophet too by a gift of knowledge foresaw what god spoke before the foundation of the world think how beautiful before the foundation of the world god spoke these words he looked and as he seen the great on coming he seemed would have taken place look when isaiah isaiah is lifted up out of his senses and isaiah in isaiah 53 you notice through the book of isaiah isaiah will be prophesying he'll be declaring things present then he'll move over into the path taking us clear back into the mind of god and in isaiah 53 he never writes of the coming of the lord jesus as something that will be but he says he was bruised why it's all it's there he's not something new being spoken god catches the prophet out into the word the word is not kind the word is eternal and the prophet is seeing what god has already spoke hallelujah it's not wire but it becomes vision and then the prophet receives that and he comes back down and we are blessed so we come under the vision of the word no wonder isaiah said after he was separated from uzziah isaiah passed away he says i was i was there in the temple i saw the lord and his train high and lifted up see he got separated then he began to see things that he was ordained to see listen to me in order to see the things that you ordained to see you've got to separate god has to allow things to separate and you notice as we in our lives the separation continues to come what's god doing it's all the plan and program of god that he might reveal himself more to us think of ezekiel ezekiel could talk about the hand of the lord that's upon me he picked me up by a lock of my hair he carried me in the spirit he transported me here ezekiel didn't do that he did not have the power to lift himself up but god who called him to be a prophet was there to lift the prophet up and the same god who has ordained you to be the bright is here to lift you up he's here to lift you up into those realms of where you belong amen no wonder paul could say that we were we we are blessings spiritual blessings and heavenly places what he was caught up and what's he do he brings that vision of the word back to you and i what does it do it lifts us up oh glory oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him so the prophet he's able to see the unseen realm the others are looking just at the word remember brother brown says they're looking at the word he says they're packing the word along and they're saying we're a christian nation we believe the lord we believe the lord we've got his prophets and he said they claim we believe the bible he said and they don't recognize they don't they despise it because they despise the spirit of the lord is that right now notice when god sends that word to a prophet what does it do it becomes that to establish the hearts of the people and the blessed assurance of the living god by living revelation let me just say it like this how god would sinned in this hour there was a need we could probably talk to all of christendom talk to a lot and say right do you believe jesus is the son of god yes i sure do and they can say hey man i believe that i believe he's the son of god but you see in order when you're shooting a gun or a bow or whatever if you're off at a short distance further down the line you're really going to be off so you got to get zeroed in in order to hit it at the judgment are you with me you got to get zeroed in right now and this is why god had to send eyes in this generation because yes there was a portrait of jesus but it was leaving people in sin it was teaching another jesus but god had eyes in this hour and it catches up and what does it do it's calling the attention from the church look away to jesus look away to jesus look unto jesus the author to finish your faith and what do you see you see a living lord jesus the same one that he changed lives back there in his same power you see that same living god that there's no way we could ever do away with our leopard spots but there had to be one that could stand in the gap for you and i that could make up where we lack that can transform our lives there's only one thing that can do that and that is the blood of jesus christ and the holy spirit comes back to witness you were included hallelujah this is what catching up does can i have just a few more moments this is what catching up does this is what a prophetic ministry does it catches you from where you are over into what god has already seen you to be you're with me when the prophet is caught up and this message is being preached brother remember it's not of things that god is saying it's what god has already said and when god has spoken to your heart personally what's god letting you know that you are always in my mind you always were a part of me hallelujah i never lost sight of you and this word comes to do what lift you brother without this word we'd still be in a valley of dry bones but the word of the lord has come to bring us together in the prophecy uniting with the word and put life into us that's what a prophetic ministry does god promised it's like samuel and david the bible says for samuel 3 21 the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord samuel was the one they rejected he felt the rejection but it was actually god they rejected while the rest were rejecting god had a little boy down there and was out minding his own business tending the sheep little did he know he was gonna have a personal visitation one day samuel said how am i going to go down there saul's going to kill me how do i get this message down there he said go under the secret of the sacrifice bring the sacrifice say i'm going to sacrifice at the house of jesse you see it comes back to the true atonement he comes down to the house of jesse they offer sacrifice every one of those seven sons come before and samuel surely this is the one god said no no no he comes at 7-1 lord they're all here no no no no no your message is going to reach beyond what you see right now is these all your sons nope he said there's one out in the field don't call him we ain't we are not sitting down till he gets here oh brother this word is going on this word there's no setting down brother there's an anointing of the word that is poured out upon our life he raised david david was a shepherd he never lost that that of what god had brought him from think of it and god raised him to be king what did that a prophet under the word of the lord whom the word had been revealed to now the word that god spoke concerning david was poured out in anointing upon his life and that anointing upon his life remember his conduct his conduct his conduct his character is what saul said i know thou art the next king he had a character that was fit for millennium reign it's anointing of the word oh my second corinthians 20 20. my i asked for a few more moments i some of you probably like hey you do that all the time notice what jehoshaphat said i i love the scripture when they are in besiegement he says believe the last part of that verse believe in the lord your god so shall you be established believe his prophets soul shall you prosper hey we're like hazel what's going on oh oh my goodness look what's surrounding us elisha gets up knocks or maybe you don't know but he says there's more with us than there is against us why he's anchored to that unseen realm the unseen realm has made the written word alive to him to where he'll stand on the promise of what god spoke through david the angel of the lord is encamped around them fear him and love him you see once god's been made real brother aaron it don't matter what promise what need you have you can stand upon that word because the same god who has made himself real in your life is the word he's the all of it my i'm wearing y'all let's stand it stabilizes us in this hour it drives our fear this is why john 3 jesus said a man must be born again it raises us into a realm that we've only heard about it raises us into a realm where brother graham says we've only been bumping into but now what when god moves see the eyes of the heart become through the baptism of the holy ghost a new birth it raises into that realm into god's program and here we are we're in this world but we're not of this world we're walking in two different worlds we're affected by the world of our rebirth our new birth but here we are still walking in this world have to contend with the things around us have to take care cares of life things that are all around us now listen everything that god has entrusted to your care husband wife children job all those things like that not of things of this world remember paul would say using this world is not abusing it so it would show that there's things that we have to do things that we have to give care to things that we have to tend to paul when he would write that in the book of corinthians when he would talk about he that is she that is unmarried care for the things of the world or of the lord she that is married cared for the things that's of of the of the world he's not saying somebody becomes a sinner they become worldly he's dealing with that all of these things that there's more cares that we have if you yourself do not care for your spouse you don't care for your job if you go about with an attitude you know i don't care what happens remember listen to me very carefully that's not an attitude according to god's word why because he cares i said he cares jesus cares what kind of product he puts out at the factory jesus cares what kind of work he does at the nursing home jesus cares what kind of work he does at the sanitation jesus cares on the accounts jesus cares he cares on the notre he cares see this is something that for the the of of the believer it's not a i don't care that's not our attitude why spiritually spiritually god has dealt with our heart to let us know in this hour i care enough about you i send you a message i send you a place of escape you know what that does it moves on our heart he cares do you care and then the response to that care it moves throughout our lives oh sure it's there's not one of us we don't like to walk out into those other realms after you leave out of a service come out of a sunday service sometimes in your mind you're thinking here comes monday don't don't dread it remember what god does for you in these moments and these times just like in your personal times of devotion in your prayer closet no doubt there's times that you study in the word of god there's times you're listening to a message and there's things that you'll hear and you're thinking man and like i never heard this before and you just get such a blessing listen don't look don't let the devil take you and say oh but you've got to do this later in the day no know that god has spoke to you personally to strengthen you because he knows what's coming later in the day you look to the same god who would speak to you in that manner he'll give you direction even when it comes to cooking dinner even when it comes to getting the children around even when it comes to taking care of the insurance no matter what it is he's in control as believers we are aware that we're not walking by natural means sure there's natural things that we have to attend to we're not so heavenly minded that we're not any earthly good but by god's grace there's a spirit of god within us it alerts us i'm not of this world yes there's things that i have to attend to but this is not my home this is not what i'm tied to you realize this is not who i am this word that god has sent it's no longer just looking at writing on a page oh i remember that i remember that as a young boy i remember that i remember reading trying to read the message trying to read the scripture i remember that i remember hearing though but i also remember when he drew me to himself i remember the grace that he gave me to surrender my life and i remember his grace that filled me with my eyes become illuminated this was no longer the message of my mom and my daddy this was my message this is me that i saw in the mirror i saw me i seen me that's what it did that's what this message did it picks picks us up and it lets us see who we really are you see not just some other theology you know how it is when people say what are you where do you go to church what are are you methodists are you baptist say i'm a christian you're a what i'm a christian oh yeah i'm a believer i'm a believer i believe every i believe god i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever i believe he still gives the holy ghost i believe he still heals i believe he still sets free i'm a believer i believe he's still god of his word i believe he's god and his people and begin to look at you what what's going on what's different but you recognize god's grace not you ezekiel not you isaiah but god by his spirit as john could say the spirit carried me away one of these mornings brother brian as he's been carrying us away and showing us things we said god thank you for opening my eyes thank you for turning my heart one of these days the same holy ghost that's carried us away from death and to life that's carried us away from glory unto glory one of these days it'll be the last day and will be carried carried home will be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye or it won't be a hard thing it'll be a step just like you're making steps right now it'll be another step what should i do keep walking enoch keep having a testimony that's pleasing god [Music] oh rapturing grace to sweep us away don't you love him hallelujah lord jesus so personally tonight lord you would speak to us i pray the lord may it not fall from our our ears or our hearts and i would always ask lord if there's one listen here way of the internet but god they've not experienced that reality lord maybe they're looking and all they see is their failures all they see is their mistakes all they see is miserable attempts lord i'm asking right now that the same holy ghost [Music] wouldn't move upon their heart may they look away to jesus may they look to the one who will lift their life out of all of that which satan is trying to pour on them may they yield their hearts to you may they turn their heart and say lord lift me up jesus lift me into that place lord if they've not repented may they lay it all down may they lay it all down say god i lay everything down at your feet lord take me into that place because i care lord i care i care that you care strengthen your children lord dear god i know lord as much as myself and others i don't even i didn't want to hear
