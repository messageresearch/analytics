[47:13] rented it there's never been a breakdown
[47:14] before but you know when you step back
[47:17] and you look at everything you know what
[47:19] it seems like there was it seemed like
[47:21] maybe this was out of sync or this was
[47:23] out of sync but you know what it was it
[47:25] God had everything right in control God
[47:31] just letting us know he's got everything
[47:33] in control we're not trying to
[47:36] spiritualize everything but it just
[47:37] comes down to the place to realize God's
[47:40] got it in control he's got it in control
[47:43] and we're just we're thankful for that
[47:46] this morning I want to heard the request
[47:50] about brother Danny Lewis and and they
[47:53] had taken him he had sent me a picture
[47:55] of his of his ankle and things are
[47:58] really really swollen bad so they had
[48:00] taken him to the ER because he had
[48:02] fallen down the stairs yesterday so we
[48:06] have that I know we you read that today
[48:08] but I also received the text from
[48:10] brother Jerry
[48:12] just moments ago brother Paul and sister
[48:15] Susie from the church they're in Dixon
[48:18] they were in a car accident and they
[48:21] think sister Susie may have broke
[48:24] something but I told him we will go
[48:26] straight to prayer so you know the Lord
[48:29] has us all in control you know we were
[48:32] in some meetings there in in Virginia
[48:34] and there was a brother that come up on
[48:39] that Saturday morning and we begin to
[48:41] pray and when he showed the testimony
[48:43] some of you there you remember it and he
[48:45] showed the testimony this this brother
[48:47] was 91 years old he wasn't at the
[48:49] meeting that morning but he was walking
[48:52] upstairs and the stairs that he was
[48:54] walking up when he he fell and he went
[48:57] through there's just like an opening and
[48:59] he fell and three or four I can't
[49:02] remember exactly how many steps it was a
[49:04] three or four steps but at any rate
[49:06] someone not even 91 years old could have
[49:08] been seriously hurt let alone he landed
[49:11] on a piece of furniture like this and
[49:13] took a piece out of the furniture so the
[49:15] brother who went to get him he thought
[49:17] this front of this this thing must have
[49:19] been you know kind of you know real weak
[49:21] so he went over there and hit his hand
[49:23] on it nothing moved on that furniture it
[49:26] was solid nothing and moved but you know
[49:29] when they took the brother to the
[49:30] hospital there wasn't one single broken
[49:35] bone no God is good God knows exactly
[49:46] what what he what he's doing you know
[49:48] what what came out in prayer that that
[49:51] morning you know is God if there's any
[49:52] broken bones Lord you're the healer
[49:55] did you just Minda I believe that the
[49:58] Lord I believe that the Lord did that
[50:00] he's still the same God so we're we want
[50:03] to take them them together in prayer in
[50:05] is there any others unspoken requests

[52:42] Lord your God may your presence just
[52:45] continue to ride in upon us now in the
[52:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[52:53] judges chapter 7 I'm gonna take a little
[52:59] break from what we've been dealing with
[53:00] on Sundays and what is preached today so
[53:07] when judges chapter 7 verse 9
[53:16] you love the Lord this morning how maybe
[53:21] you come expecting expecting to hear
[53:25] from him right you won't be disappointed
[53:29] that if we're expecting to hear from him
[53:32] amen because you know your expectation
[53:35] it it puts you in a place to where by an
[53:39] expectation you can't have an
[53:40] expectation unless you already know
[53:43] where you've met gone before and you're
[53:46] looking for God to come and speak you
[53:48] say Lord I know you speak to me through
[53:50] your word and we want him to do that
[53:53] this morning wanted to be personal this
[53:55] morning so verse 9 the judge is 7 and it
[54:00] came to pass the same night that the
[54:03] Lord said unto Him arise get thee down
[54:08] unto the hosts for I have delivered it
[54:11] into thine hand but if thou fear to go
[54:15] down go thou for thy servant down to the
[54:20] host and thou shalt hear what they say
[54:25] and afterward shall dine hands be
[54:28] strengthened to go down unto the host
[54:31] then when he down with furrow his
[54:33] servant unto the outside of the armed
[54:35] men that were in the host and the
[54:38] Midianites and the Amalekites and all
[54:40] the children of the east lay along in
[54:44] the valley like grasshoppers for
[54:46] multitude and their camels were without
[54:50] number as the sand by the seaside for
[54:53] multitude I may have you seen a picture
[54:56] sometimes you can see a picture maybe of
[54:58] like when the other elk migration where
[55:01] you have animals that are migrating you
[55:03] look out or maybe across the plains or
[55:05] the rolling part and you're just looking
[55:06] out there and it's like you can't see
[55:09] you can't even make it out to count it
[55:12] just looks like a blanket of animals
[55:15] that you could walk right across you
[55:16] know I'm talking about this is this is
[55:19] the setting here of the Midianites and
[55:22] the malachite is just like a blanket how
[55:25] could we even count it's just that
[55:28] and when Gideon was come behold there
[55:32] was a man that told a dream unto his
[55:34] fellow and said behold I dreamed a dream
[55:38] and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled
[55:42] into the host of Midian and came unto a
[55:46] tent and smote it that it fell and
[55:51] overturned it that the tent lay long and
[55:56] his fellow answered and said this is
[56:00] nothing else save the sword of Gideon
[56:02] the son of joash a man of Israel for
[56:07] into his hand hath God delivered Midian
[56:11] and all the hosts verse 15 and it was so
[56:17] when Gideon heard the telling of the
[56:20] dream and the interpretation thereof
[56:25] that he worshipped ghost of Midian just
[56:32] like to speak just a few moments on the
[56:34] thought you need to hear this you need
[56:38] to hear this that's my subject you need
[56:41] to hear this may God bless you your
[56:44] being seated
[56:49] you think about for a moment with my mom
[56:54] she was just a little bit too loud don't
[56:55] don't cut them off on me now when you
[57:01] think just for a moment of what of what
[57:04] faith really is we hear so much talked
[57:08] about that and I'm gonna really kind of
[57:10] I pray the Lord help me to move in in a
[57:12] little bit of a direction here because I
[57:13] want to speak to all ages that's what I
[57:15] always want to do but I really want to
[57:17] what I want to hone in on even the young
[57:19] people here you'll hear the word in the
[57:23] term faith used a lot and we look at
[57:27] what faith and water what is faith and
[57:29] faith is something that it's a substance
[57:33] the Bible declares it's it's something
[57:35] that is revealed to you it's made known
[57:38] to you probably every one of you here
[57:41] and I'll just say probably I'll pick on
[57:44] these guys up here if there was a little
[57:48] bit of a smell that came in here and it
[57:50] was is that right you with me on that
[57:54] that sound all right but you see what it
[57:58] is I agree you see what it is there is a
[58:00] sense that you would have that declares
[58:04] there is pizza now the only way you can
[58:08] Nestor's our sense that's saying
[58:09] somebody could be sitting next to you
[58:11] and say there is no way in the world
[58:13] we're having pizza after church but you
[58:15] say I know what I'm smelling because
[58:19] you've already experienced pizza before
[58:23] so you know when pizza gets near there
[58:27] might be garlic crust or Parmesan crust
[58:30] or whatever you know there's somewhere
[58:32] pizza somewhere close but there's a
[58:35] greater sense than just our natural
[58:37] sense there's a sense that we're given
[58:41] by God and that's the sense of faith to
[58:44] be able to contact God for God to be
[58:46] able to speak to us and that's God heal
[58:50] heal come through because a lot of our
[58:51] other senses sometimes they'll lie to us
[58:54] reasoning and and everything else
[58:57] sometimes things we can see it'll lie to
[58:59] us things that we can feel it'll lied to
[59:02] us
[59:03] faith itself will never lie it's a sense
[59:09] to wear that you know it's something
[59:11] like you can just sense the presence of
[59:13] God it's just how God is spoke to you
[59:15] before and you just you just sense when
[59:17] he's drawing you you just know a is here
[59:19] and and you might be in the midst of
[59:21] something that you don't have an answer
[59:23] for you don't even know which step or
[59:25] rich direction do I take
[59:26] but what helps you in the midst of that
[59:28] time is when you sense his presence and
[59:31] you say it's it's under control he's
[59:33] he's here you don't know which step to
[59:37] take but what you know is he's here and
[59:39] and as long as he's here he's my guide
[59:42] he's the one that can lead me he's the
[59:45] one that'll that'll direct me and it'll
[59:47] be very clear for my life you read about
[59:50] through the scriptures you know when we
[59:52] look in the scriptures and we we read
[59:54] about many heroes of faith and you think
[59:57] about men like such as we're reading
[59:59] about Gideon and you all know we've
[1:00:00] really been covering Gideon in the youth
[1:00:02] meetings but you read about Gideon you
[1:00:04] read about men like you Elijah you read
[1:00:06] about men like Moses you read about men
[1:00:09] like Peter you read about women like
[1:00:11] Lydia you read about like Mary like
[1:00:14] Rebecca you read about them and
[1:00:16] sometimes we miss it and we'd get to
[1:00:18] looking at it like what great
[1:00:20] individuals they were but I want you
[1:00:22] understand they were just common people
[1:00:25] just as you and I they were they were
[1:00:29] made up of the same elements that you
[1:00:31] and I are made up of but one thing that
[1:00:34] made them stand apart from the rest of
[1:00:37] the world in that time there's one thing
[1:00:39] that made Mary as a young lady stand out
[1:00:42] different from the rest of the young
[1:00:44] ladies and that's because that Mary in
[1:00:47] her heart she was separated unto God
[1:00:50] that the Bible says it like this that
[1:00:52] these men that different ones in Hebrews
[1:00:54] 11 it speaks of how that they themselves
[1:00:57] subdued kingdoms how does these
[1:01:00] individuals subdue kingdoms the Bible
[1:01:03] says it that out of weakness they were
[1:01:06] made strong Scott doesn't need and God
[1:01:09] doesn't take the strong I hope you're
[1:01:11] with me now God does not need somebody
[1:01:14] who's strong
[1:01:15] he needs somebody who's willing to be
[1:01:18] weak that he might be strong gun this is
[1:01:22] the kind of mighty men when God spoke to
[1:01:24] Gideon he came to Gideon I want you just
[1:01:27] to kind of get a backdrop on this he
[1:01:29] came to get in and he speaks to get in
[1:01:32] now look at where we're at now the
[1:01:33] Prophet has come in the beginning of
[1:01:35] Judges 6 the Prophet goes off the scene
[1:01:38] but the angel of the Lord follows the
[1:01:41] prophets message so the age of the Lord
[1:01:43] that descended down to bring the message
[1:01:46] when the messenger went off the scene he
[1:01:49] who was the inspiration the age of the
[1:01:52] Lord Himself was still present and now
[1:01:55] bringing that message to a personal
[1:01:58] reality to who it was intended to you
[1:02:01] understand there were things that were
[1:02:03] spoken where Israel just kind of went
[1:02:06] back into their into their ways they
[1:02:08] continued on you know life as usual they
[1:02:11] got out of Sunday morning service and
[1:02:13] everything just kind of resumed and
[1:02:14] let's see what were the things that I
[1:02:16] had to fulfill today Olli I got three
[1:02:18] alerts but there was something you see
[1:02:20] that God he's not interested in trying
[1:02:23] to reform us God knows that when he by
[1:02:26] his presence comes and begins to make
[1:02:28] himself known to you and I it's
[1:02:31] something that his presence to the heart
[1:02:33] of the believer will take precedence and
[1:02:35] preeminence over everything else God
[1:02:39] does not want us just to live by
[1:02:41] run-of-the-mill life and just to be
[1:02:43] something to where were just routine but
[1:02:46] God wants us to be the individuals that
[1:02:48] are inspired by the Holy Ghost that are
[1:02:51] set and directed by his spirit you
[1:02:54] believe that he comes to Gideon and here
[1:02:56] he approaches Gideon Gideon thinks he's
[1:02:58] an old man you ask me he thinks he's an
[1:03:02] old man
[1:03:03] Gideon don't know who he is but you see
[1:03:06] God has many masks God has many forms
[1:03:10] Gideon don't know and recognize who's
[1:03:12] speaking to him but here's the voice
[1:03:14] tells him and says thou mighty man of
[1:03:17] Valor get in no doubt did just like you
[1:03:19] and I would do we look around and say
[1:03:21] who else entered the room who else is in
[1:03:24] here besides me because you said mighty
[1:03:25] man of Valor
[1:03:26] because remember
[1:03:27] gideon himself was a coward he was a
[1:03:31] coward and so or were each and every one
[1:03:36] of us gideon the coward part about
[1:03:40] gideon even argued and said there's no
[1:03:43] way I'm gonna be able to do this he said
[1:03:47] my family's the poorest in Manassas
[1:03:48] complexes his complexes I don't have the
[1:03:52] genes that everybody else has I don't
[1:03:54] wear the same shoes that everybody else
[1:03:56] has I don't have the same kind of shirts
[1:03:58] God said I'm not interested in that I've
[1:04:03] come to speak to that which is beneath
[1:04:06] the Cour because the coward can never
[1:04:09] fulfill my word but you let me get
[1:04:12] behind that coward bad your skin and I
[1:04:15] will make my word come to pass God
[1:04:20] doesn't need strongmen dog just takes
[1:04:23] cowards and his tents and he takes him
[1:04:26] inside out and he puts himself and
[1:04:28] that's a great paradox here you've got a
[1:04:32] coward on the outside but here you got a
[1:04:34] mighty God on the inside hello
[1:04:39] God was looking deeper than what Gideon
[1:04:42] could see the Bible said it like this
[1:04:43] the Lord looked on him not him him him
[1:04:51] God was looking deeper when God is
[1:04:54] talking to me and you he's not talking
[1:04:56] to this guy here this guy gets offended
[1:04:59] this God gets upset this guy says Lord
[1:05:02] I'll not be able to do this I cannot go
[1:05:04] pray for kings and potentates I've only
[1:05:06] got a seventh grade education this guy
[1:05:09] the coward says that but God looks
[1:05:11] what's beneath the coward table don't
[1:05:15] raise up cowards
[1:05:16] he kills cowards and raises up his
[1:05:19] children by his mighty power
[1:05:23] Alleluia is Almighty God and let me tell
[1:05:26] you something like this you know if you
[1:05:30] were gonna Scout somebody else you're
[1:05:33] Matthew let's put it like this if
[1:05:35] somebody came up to you such as myself
[1:05:37] and I said I think you got good
[1:05:38] basketball skills now you know I never
[1:05:41] play basketball right I just play around
[1:05:44] outside and shoot and everything else
[1:05:46] but I travel I do have to do all sorts
[1:05:48] of things but you would look at me and
[1:05:51] you say how in the world how can you
[1:05:53] tell me about our potential in my life
[1:05:55] you ain't never been a basketball player
[1:05:57] right now if I start talking to you
[1:06:01] about football certain things I can see
[1:06:02] how you're doing this cut and how you're
[1:06:04] doing this you might start listening a
[1:06:05] little bit you with me
[1:06:07] like I might be able to say hey someday
[1:06:09] man I think you got skills you'll be
[1:06:11] able to step in and the computer parts
[1:06:13] and accompany man I'll tell you what you
[1:06:15] keep going in this language huh I think
[1:06:17] it'll be really good but you can look at
[1:06:19] me and say what language do you prefer
[1:06:22] Oh English and you're expecting me to
[1:06:26] say pearl Java or whatever more I don't
[1:06:29] know those kind of languages when my
[1:06:31] brother-in-law talks I just say yes sir
[1:06:33] uh-huh does it work all right but you
[1:06:38] see what it is
[1:06:39] you couldn't have no confidence because
[1:06:42] what it is I don't know anything about
[1:06:44] that but so it takes one to be able to
[1:06:48] know the potential that lays within one
[1:06:51] the only one who knows about mighty men
[1:06:54] is Almighty God it takes a mighty God to
[1:06:57] come down and identify there are mighty
[1:07:00] sons and mighty daughters beneath and
[1:07:03] behind that first it takes a mighty God
[1:07:06] to point it out that mighty God comes on
[1:07:08] the scene and he can let you know there
[1:07:11] is something within you that you never
[1:07:13] knew and you wondered why was I this way
[1:07:16] why was that that way but God Himself
[1:07:18] comes right down and lets you know this
[1:07:21] is why you've always been the ugly
[1:07:23] duckling this is why you've always been
[1:07:25] the odd one or the strange one it's
[1:07:27] because you can never fit in to these
[1:07:30] things but you are always a part of
[1:07:33] my program you are always a part of my
[1:07:36] plan I had you in my mind before the
[1:07:40] foundation of the world hallelujah the
[1:07:44] mighty God comes on the scene to call
[1:07:47] mighty men listen to me now
[1:07:52] you don't take a bunch of people to be a
[1:07:54] mighty man all it takes is you in God
[1:07:59] hallelujah that's all it takes is you
[1:08:03] and God I want you to think of this
[1:08:06] faith as we're talking about remember
[1:08:09] how the Lord brought it on son
[1:08:12] on Thursday or Friday night about our
[1:08:14] landmarks he talked about how the enemy
[1:08:19] would like to move have little
[1:08:21] infringment sand move things just a
[1:08:23] little bit he talked about our prayer
[1:08:25] life our dedication our personal
[1:08:28] dedication in our life then the Holy
[1:08:30] Spirit follows it up yesterday morning
[1:08:32] and begins to deal with the tents our
[1:08:35] lives our homes begins to speak about
[1:08:37] the responsibility for the oil now you
[1:08:41] look at it if you want to be better as a
[1:08:44] hunter you don't wanna be 100 E well
[1:08:49] let's just pretend with me okay maybe
[1:08:52] you're talking to your brother saying I
[1:08:54] want to kill a hundred and fifty boone
[1:08:56] and crockett deer I don't want that
[1:08:57] thing to walk out there broadside I want
[1:08:59] to be able to put the pin on it well
[1:09:02] you're not gonna you're not gonna get
[1:09:04] any encouragement by reading Better
[1:09:06] Homes and garden you're not I'm saying
[1:09:08] now I know you like food we're buddies
[1:09:11] on that right I know that and those
[1:09:14] those are alright for a certain time
[1:09:16] right it can build confidence for what
[1:09:18] Mama's cooking right pasta lead you and
[1:09:25] then potato balls I like but then ain't
[1:09:28] gonna build your faith for the bill to
[1:09:29] kill a big buck is it there's only one
[1:09:31] thing it's going to build you up
[1:09:33] you got to see images about this you've
[1:09:35] got to talk with somebody who's a hunter
[1:09:37] and you're going to read books about
[1:09:38] hunting right it's going to build
[1:09:41] confidence faith comes by hearing the
[1:09:45] word
[1:09:46] god it comes by hearing not just
[1:09:49] listening to but by hearing you see
[1:09:52] there's a lot of things within a service
[1:09:54] you might say I can't remember every
[1:09:56] single point cutting interested in you
[1:09:58] regurgitating every single point that's
[1:10:01] not faith that's just called a good
[1:10:03] memory this is not Sunday school where
[1:10:06] you get stamps for how much you can
[1:10:08] remember it's when God comes down and he
[1:10:11] speaks personally to you where your
[1:10:13] faith is not in man's words but your
[1:10:16] faith is in the power of God amen
[1:10:19] engaged speech your life and you know
[1:10:22] God spoke to me because there's nobody
[1:10:24] knows that about me nobody knows those
[1:10:27] thoughts but God but God has spoken to
[1:10:29] me it builds faith to take and look upon
[1:10:33] the word and to hear that word you might
[1:10:36] read it and say I don't understand
[1:10:38] everything God's not interested that you
[1:10:40] understand everything but understand God
[1:10:44] gives understanding just like the Holy
[1:10:46] Spirit brought out yesterday seek and
[1:10:49] ask him for it when I'm hungry
[1:10:55] maybe we almost lot need more young
[1:10:56] people up here to preach to when I'm
[1:10:59] hungry I don't just you know kind of
[1:11:02] look around and lay around on the couch
[1:11:04] or getting a lazy boy when I'm hungry
[1:11:08] let me tell you I start going my wife
[1:11:11] starts to knowing when I start wearing
[1:11:12] treads through the kitchen
[1:11:14] bumping around here she hears this
[1:11:16] cabinet door closed this fridge Raider
[1:11:18] open and this right here she knows this
[1:11:21] guy's hungry now i'ma tell you there's a
[1:11:24] certain time of the day and I can kind
[1:11:26] of tell it's time to eat sometimes I
[1:11:29] feel I could get cheated in winter time
[1:11:30] but I know there's a certain time of the
[1:11:32] day it's time for me to eat buddy and so
[1:11:36] I'm going through a place where I can
[1:11:38] eat and there's there's there's this
[1:11:41] when we were looking at it I'm gonna ask
[1:11:43] her honey
[1:11:44] the most important question of the day
[1:11:48] what are we having for dinner
[1:11:53] I'm gonna wait for just a second say
[1:11:56] depending on what it is it might be a
[1:11:57] little praise break going on but I want
[1:12:02] to know you see I'm gonna ask I'm not
[1:12:04] gonna sit around it's like if I'm over
[1:12:06] at your house and you say hey we're
[1:12:07] having dinner I'm probably going to come
[1:12:09] to some of y'all's house and I'll be on
[1:12:10] a fast before I get there by the time I
[1:12:13] get there because I know what I might be
[1:12:14] getting so I'll show up there and after
[1:12:16] a period of time I'll say hey what time
[1:12:19] we go eat would you say what are you
[1:12:22] saying I'm saying the Bible says seek
[1:12:24] after God you've got to ask God God
[1:12:27] wants you to ask him questions
[1:12:29] God is not shy about answering questions
[1:12:34] the way you get to know somebody is ask
[1:12:37] questions that don't mind questions
[1:12:40] questions don't fluster god that's a way
[1:12:44] for God to make himself known to you his
[1:12:48] love his care though repite God here
[1:12:53] they came up to this place here's Gideon
[1:12:57] he comes in to this place here God lets
[1:13:01] him know you need to get down there
[1:13:03] tonight I don't care how you're gonna
[1:13:07] get there if you didn't take one of your
[1:13:09] buddies to camp with you go but you need
[1:13:11] to get there I don't care if you you I
[1:13:15] don't care what you got to do if you got
[1:13:16] a set on the road with your other
[1:13:18] girlfriends I want you to get there
[1:13:19] because you need to hear this you ask me
[1:13:22] God wasn't worried but Gideon might
[1:13:25] being fear about Fuhrer or any of the
[1:13:28] rest of them he wasn't worried about
[1:13:29] that but God said you need to get there
[1:13:31] and you need to hear this pardon me
[1:13:33] somebody I need these monitors up a
[1:13:35] little bit more if y'all need me to
[1:13:36] change mic so will but I feel like I'm
[1:13:39] gonna can I love them I can talk like
[1:13:42] that
[1:13:45] my brother-in-law he'll pay me back
[1:13:47] later but what you think of this here
[1:13:51] they are in the midst of this time and
[1:13:53] here they are in this and they go down
[1:13:55] there and when they get and when they
[1:13:57] get down there I've always I've always
[1:14:01] marveled at this God knew exactly the
[1:14:03] time for Gideon to get down there
[1:14:06] God wouldn't like you and I say you know
[1:14:11] sometimes you try to do things that make
[1:14:13] people hurry up like we want to get the
[1:14:17] church earlier so I'm gonna go start the
[1:14:19] car
[1:14:19] go ahead it'll run longer God was not
[1:14:24] God I've already had the time arranged
[1:14:26] brother Joey he knew God just said I
[1:14:29] want you to get down there I don't care
[1:14:33] who you take with you because what God
[1:14:35] has confidence in Gideon needs to hear
[1:14:38] because sometimes you and I you cannot
[1:14:40] see what God sees in you you can't see
[1:14:46] it but God wants you to me want you to
[1:14:49] know this is what I see in you and I
[1:14:51] also want you to know the enemy is
[1:14:53] seeing this and you know the enemy ain't
[1:14:56] afraid of how many scriptures we know
[1:14:57] the enemy is not afraid that we say we
[1:15:00] believe the message or how many quotes
[1:15:02] but where the enemy is afraid of he's
[1:15:05] afraid of the Living God he's taking
[1:15:07] precedence in our life that's what he's
[1:15:09] afraid of he can prevail any day over
[1:15:12] our flesh over our thinking but he
[1:15:14] cannot prevail against that revelation
[1:15:17] that is tied up in your soul
[1:15:19] he cannot prevail against that go
[1:15:24] repeater god oh my god said i already
[1:15:28] have delivered it into your hand now I
[1:15:33] want you to think of this young people
[1:15:38] y'all ready for this
[1:15:39] here's a tenth here's a tenth down here
[1:15:44] and here's this tenth that's laying
[1:15:47] there and the tenth the Bible says that
[1:15:51] one of them said I seen a cake of barley
[1:15:53] bread rolling down now would you think
[1:15:57] about a piece of bread knocking over a
[1:15:58] tent no you look at that you think oh
[1:16:02] what Noel but remember God deals in
[1:16:04] symbols God deals in symbols he deals in
[1:16:10] symbols and it wasn't a piece it was a
[1:16:13] cake and one of the cake is it's round
[1:16:17] it means it can move
[1:16:19] it's not just stationary it's on the
[1:16:22] move the holy spirit inside of you is on
[1:16:25] the move it's moving you and it's a cake
[1:16:29] of barley bread you know barley is it
[1:16:33] represents resurrection power and here
[1:16:38] is this cake of barley bread it comes
[1:16:40] rolling down into the host tumbling down
[1:16:42] there it knows exactly where it's coming
[1:16:45] to that pit that's there that is of the
[1:16:48] leaders and of the hosts of media
[1:16:49] they're a whole encampment that has been
[1:16:52] upon the Israel God he's going to turn
[1:16:54] that around overturn it he's going to
[1:16:56] smite it and he's going to overthrow it
[1:17:00] and then the man that is listening there
[1:17:04] to the dream of his other fellow he says
[1:17:07] this is nothing else but the sword of
[1:17:10] the Lord and of Gideon you see the enemy
[1:17:14] had already heard about this oh I hope
[1:17:19] you're with me tonight
[1:17:20] you see Gideon had not lifted his sword
[1:17:24] per se against the Midianites yet he had
[1:17:27] never ever lifted his sword against the
[1:17:29] Midianites but what got Satan nervous is
[1:17:33] because get in begin to take care of
[1:17:37] things in his house God after the Lord
[1:17:42] quickened his seed his life there and
[1:17:46] remember the fire rose up out of the
[1:17:48] rock the sacrifice that was there has
[1:17:51] the fire rose up and consumed that same
[1:17:54] fire lifted Gideon into heavenly places
[1:17:56] and Gideon is spoken to by God go back
[1:18:01] to your house your daddy's house see
[1:18:05] these things have been handed down year
[1:18:06] after year after year after year and I
[1:18:09] don't want the old Bullock I don't want
[1:18:12] that old brittle thing that's lame and
[1:18:13] hardly get around I want the young one I
[1:18:15] want a tender heart a tender life I want
[1:18:18] one that's what I want you'll get the
[1:18:21] second one but tender when you see God
[1:18:23] just comes to claim and tenderize our
[1:18:27] lives so that what our lives might be an
[1:18:29] offering of it's a fresh offering tender
[1:18:32] to
[1:18:32] be flexible can be moved by the holy
[1:18:34] ghost you asked me he had to tear down
[1:18:38] the Grove the Grove all those trees he
[1:18:41] had to tear down the altar he had to
[1:18:43] come and do all of them before he ever
[1:18:46] lifted one finger against the Midianites
[1:18:48] but you see this is where we learn in
[1:18:51] the scriptures a very valuable lesson
[1:18:53] being obedient in small things you want
[1:18:57] to see I want to see bigger things be
[1:18:59] obedient and small things but I want to
[1:19:02] see miracles where are you at when it's
[1:19:03] Church time it's small things well I
[1:19:09] really want to see God move and you
[1:19:11] won't even ask blessing over your food
[1:19:13] oh I really want to see God move and you
[1:19:17] don't take time in your personal up
[1:19:21] whoo-hoo a pastor show back up here but
[1:19:25] you see it matters it matters how
[1:19:30] victorious do you want to be you can be
[1:19:33] as victorious as God has allotted for
[1:19:37] your life and let me tell you there is
[1:19:39] no in to victory but the devil's always
[1:19:47] after us to try to get us in a place to
[1:19:49] where we're not living to the full
[1:19:52] potential but here getting now God
[1:19:58] speaks to him and he's going to come and
[1:20:00] he's going to deal with these with these
[1:20:02] Midianites
[1:20:03] the Bible says it like this it says that
[1:20:05] when Gideon when he had heard this truly
[1:20:09] Gideon begin to worship how much you
[1:20:12] think of this there hasn't been one
[1:20:14] sword lifted but when God spoke Gideon
[1:20:18] said it's over
[1:20:20] matter of fact Gideon might have broke
[1:20:22] out in a song it's already done mmm
[1:20:27] it's already done the battle is over the
[1:20:33] victory has been won it's already done
[1:20:39] so what's wrong with that guy oh he
[1:20:42] already we got a word from the Lord it's
[1:20:44] already done and yet he noticed this
[1:20:49] Gideon just as some Scriptures before
[1:20:52] had talked to the Lord about that fleece
[1:20:55] if if if thou will deliver Israel by my
[1:21:02] hand if but after this he worships it's
[1:21:08] done and he comes back saying arise get
[1:21:12] up
[1:21:13] the Lord has delivered the Midianites
[1:21:17] into your hand
[1:21:19] see not my hand your hands you see the
[1:21:23] word it's a body movement this is not a
[1:21:27] one-man ministry anymore this is a body
[1:21:31] who God used one man that that
[1:21:34] revelation could be given but that
[1:21:36] revelation was for you and I that it
[1:21:39] might find its way in the heart of the
[1:21:42] believer he did his part the Prophet did
[1:21:47] his part now he prophet the Holy Ghost
[1:21:50] is on the scene he's bringing the word
[1:21:53] through a living reality in you and I
[1:21:56] and letting you know this is your part
[1:22:00] know how to act this out yes just watch
[1:22:03] I'll show you well how do I do it just
[1:22:06] surrender I'll act it out through you
[1:22:10] more than what wasn't one as it wasn't
[1:22:12] if the Acts of the Apostles no no it was
[1:22:14] the Acts of me in the Apostles
[1:22:18] hallelujah bro repeater God so here this
[1:22:23] cake of barley bread has it come down
[1:22:26] you think about faith let's come back to
[1:22:29] faith for a moment I know it's no
[1:22:32] mystery I don't use hairspray
[1:22:36] right I'm not gonna spray this on
[1:22:39] anybody but this just happened to be
[1:22:40] here
[1:22:42] they must have this up here cuz somebody
[1:22:44] makes a mess but you see these contents
[1:22:49] in here there's a way made to get these
[1:22:52] contents out there's a way mate now you
[1:22:57] know you can say why don't you just open
[1:23:00] the bottle and just dump it out but you
[1:23:03] know that won't work
[1:23:04] I mean you'll get the contents out but
[1:23:07] what a mess it would be but you see
[1:23:09] understanding is where you know the
[1:23:12] contents in this Bible or this bottle
[1:23:15] the contents that are in the word there
[1:23:19] is a release valve of the power
[1:23:22] contained in it and that what is that
[1:23:25] release mouth faith will press the
[1:23:28] release valve to where the virtue that's
[1:23:32] laying in the word can come right out to
[1:23:35] you remember when that remember when
[1:23:37] that woman was with the issue of blood
[1:23:39] remember she said if I came but touch
[1:23:42] the hem of His garment you see her faith
[1:23:45] it lit touch the release valve of the
[1:23:49] virtue of God and God's virtue went
[1:23:53] right out to her and her condition was
[1:23:58] healed in her right then you believe
[1:24:05] he's the same God this morning your
[1:24:07] faith is the release valve on the power
[1:24:10] of God so with faith when we look at
[1:24:14] this you think of how that it's so
[1:24:16] important in this time for us to be
[1:24:18] built up in faith that's the only way
[1:24:21] that you can face the the time the
[1:24:24] condition the adversary in this hour is
[1:24:26] to be built up in the faith of this hour
[1:24:28] you understand what I'm saying build up
[1:24:31] in the faith of this hour you can't be
[1:24:33] built up by just nibbling
[1:24:39] I'm doing some meetings last week and I
[1:24:42] got I got about through you know I'd
[1:24:44] went from Thursday night here and then
[1:24:45] went into some other other meetings
[1:24:47] right straight and started speaking by
[1:24:48] the time I got to that after that second
[1:24:50] night in that in that youth meeting man
[1:24:52] I was weak I was real weak and you know
[1:24:56] some of the things when I started
[1:24:58] telling my wife I said man tell the
[1:24:59] church to pray I got one more service
[1:25:02] here and I don't know how I'm gonna do
[1:25:03] it
[1:25:03] I was feeling really weak I mean I was
[1:25:06] really tired already
[1:25:07] but my wife sentence he text me back
[1:25:09] something I've saved this text she said
[1:25:13] you need to eat some carbs I saved that
[1:25:18] text man let me tell you what kind of
[1:25:21] carbs are you I had lasagna that day
[1:25:25] after I got done with lasagna I had a
[1:25:28] piece of pecan pie with vanilla icing or
[1:25:31] vanilla ice cream on top
[1:25:32] I took her word to the fullest let me
[1:25:38] tell you I feel a lot better brother
[1:25:39] Doug I really did I felt better my body
[1:25:42] because I just was eating the proteins
[1:25:44] and fats but I needed a little bit of
[1:25:46] that because of what I was expending I
[1:25:48] haven't I haven't taken it and been
[1:25:50] eating the carbs and things I think I
[1:25:51] only ate two piece of that stuff that
[1:25:54] sister Michelle made and hope she makes
[1:25:55] again very soon I only ate a little bit
[1:25:59] of that yesterday but because I couldn't
[1:26:00] come up with a good reason why I needed
[1:26:01] carbs but I'm talking about being built
[1:26:05] up in faith the faith of this hour you
[1:26:08] got to be able to be built up in that
[1:26:10] and allowing as the Prophet said that it
[1:26:13] would be accumulated in our lives all
[1:26:15] the things that he has been doing and
[1:26:18] you know listen friends this is about
[1:26:20] your life your journey your walk god
[1:26:22] this is personal between you and God

[1:26:28] life but you can accumulate and realize
[1:26:31] my life is not my chance it's not by
[1:26:34] accident it was by the design of
[1:26:37] Almighty God that I am here that God has
[1:26:41] moved upon my heart God has drawn me to
[1:26:43] himself I didn't put this love inside of
[1:26:46] me

[1:26:51] tried to do it's what God has determined

[1:28:15] men of water
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:20] Gideon's looking all these guys coming
[1:28:22] twenty two thousand and it's all right
[1:28:26] twenty-two twenty-two thousand oh man
[1:28:30] this is good God said we need to narrow
[1:28:34] it down because when a trumpet sounds it
[1:28:37] calls three kinds of believers
[1:28:40] we got to narrow it down so here's what
[1:28:45] he tells gideon he said it so I want you
[1:28:47] to do I want you to go tell them that
[1:28:48] are that are afraid tell him to go on
[1:28:52] back home what a paradox he a chapter
[1:28:55] before was a coward a coward
[1:29:00] was telling other cowards no was a
[1:29:02] coward the mighty man had been raised up
[1:29:06] and the mighty man was putting the
[1:29:09] coward in subjection and he told those
[1:29:12] that are fearful faint-hearted go on
[1:29:15] back home sure glory be to God you think
[1:29:19] the devil one trying to booger him in
[1:29:21] his mind tell him and say I'll tell you
[1:29:23] what look at you one you the one hiding
[1:29:26] behind the winepress huh
[1:29:28] weren't you the one that this youth camp
[1:29:31] and this year's camp and this thing and
[1:29:33] then look at you get in knew that he
[1:29:38] hadn't met God face to face things were
[1:29:41] different and Gideon was resting in that
[1:29:45] difference that was me you see that's
[1:29:47] what you have to look for his look for
[1:29:49] the difference maker and the difference
[1:29:51] maker is the Lord God Himself Gideon was
[1:29:56] resting in this right here it didn't
[1:29:58] matter he had oh listen he went through
[1:30:00] some of the same man battles at you and
[1:30:01] I would go through you better believe it
[1:30:03] the devil was right there to point out
[1:30:06] all the reasons and try to point out
[1:30:08] everything but you know what Gideon was
[1:30:10] able to silence that because what God
[1:30:14] had said let me tell you something
[1:30:16] when God speaks to your heart that is a
[1:30:18] voice and that voice cannot be silenced
[1:30:22] when that voice finds its place in your
[1:30:25] heart it's hit its mark and that voice
[1:30:27] is greater than any other voice Amen
[1:30:32] that is the voice of the lion that's
[1:30:34] roaring and all other voices must cease
[1:30:38] because the King has spoken
[1:30:42] hello glory be to God amen brother
[1:30:47] Samuel
[1:30:50] I'll get him today
[1:30:55] here we go twenty-two thousand man
[1:31:03] twenty-two thousand here from twenty two
[1:31:07] thousand it goes down to ten thousand oh
[1:31:12] Lord I mean you could maybe five hundred
[1:31:15] just five hundred twenty one thousand
[1:31:18] five hundred that'd be alright
[1:31:20] well that wasn't her wiped out they go
[1:31:23] running but then here here get in here
[1:31:29] is he heard from the Lord and when get
[1:31:31] in here is from God God said still too
[1:31:33] many too many too many but wait a minute
[1:31:39] you don't find Gideon questioning Gideon
[1:31:42] doesn't know how God is going to
[1:31:45] separate everything out but remember
[1:31:48] there's a key point God is doing this
[1:31:51] because he said I don't want Israel to
[1:31:53] vaunt themselves against me as though
[1:31:57] it's my numbers I can spit quotes out
[1:32:00] like a Gatling gun I know how brother
[1:32:03] Ram says it here I know how to finish it
[1:32:05] there I could quote the last part I know
[1:32:07] the last song he's sudden the message
[1:32:09] good the devil does too
[1:32:13] this is not about memorization this is
[1:32:19] the word of the Living God that is come
[1:32:21] forth to put his people into action
[1:32:26] not where we become a bunch of
[1:32:29] intellectuals and can know this and I
[1:32:31] can quote this and quote that this word
[1:32:34] was made and meant to take on flesh
[1:32:37] because inside of you and inside of me
[1:32:41] was that corresponding part that when
[1:32:43] the water of life is released upon that
[1:32:45] seed it transforms and it released the
[1:32:48] mystery that had been sealed into your
[1:32:51] life and that's a mystery of Christ
[1:32:55] Matthew come up here a minute come up
[1:32:58] here yeah well you got to do is say a
[1:33:01] man brother Sammy I won't pick on you no
[1:33:03] more man
[1:33:04] this guy ain't getting tall in me every
[1:33:07] time he comes to my house I feel like
[1:33:09] I'm have to get a stepladder now here's
[1:33:12] the way it's gonna be
[1:33:13] we got all of these people in here and
[1:33:16] let's look at it like this you mean you
[1:33:19] and we're gonna play all of them in
[1:33:22] kickball what you think about that what
[1:33:29] you mean no you don't got much
[1:33:32] confidence huh why not huh
[1:33:38] too many it's a lot that's how that's
[1:33:43] what it was with Israel
[1:33:44] it went from 22,000 to 300 I'm not much
[1:33:52] into math myself but I did it and you
[1:33:55] know what the math is 300 divided by 20
[1:33:58] mm its 1% God took 1% and God said with
[1:34:07] 1% you give me 1% and I'll whoop the
[1:34:11] devil
[1:34:15] you give me 1% God doesn't need numbers
[1:34:21] Oh mother Santa we want to fill this
[1:34:25] church up with what how about let our
[1:34:29] lives be filled up with God when I went
[1:34:36] on numbers numbers numbers this is why
[1:34:40] different ones when they said the
[1:34:42] faint-hearted they they ran macula when
[1:34:44] God County interested in numbers God
[1:34:46] doesn't need numbers to be victorious
[1:34:49] all he needs is yielded vessels then we
[1:34:55] talked about faith right which on my
[1:34:57] faith and faith we look back in the
[1:35:02] scriptures there's some examples back in
[1:35:05] the scriptures mm-hmm you take Elijah

[1:37:16] hey many had liquid fire inside of him
[1:37:19] you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:21] even when generals and different ones
[1:37:23] tried to take you Elijah there was a
[1:37:24] fire that issued out but Elijah was able
[1:37:29] he said God opened the eyes of this this
[1:37:33] man that he might see and the Bible
[1:37:35] declared it was full not just sprinkled
[1:37:39] but it was full of the horses and the
[1:37:44] chariots and the angels of God
[1:37:50] you might walk into that classroom on
[1:37:52] Tuesday morning let me tell you
[1:37:54] something you're not walking in there
[1:37:56] alone
[1:37:58] amen the same God that spits to your
[1:38:01] heart and moves upon your life that same
[1:38:04] God is right there to make himself real
[1:38:07] make himself known to you personally you
[1:38:11] may not be able to see it but there's
[1:38:12] angels on the bookshelf hey where the
[1:38:19] Lord is his host is present also you say
[1:38:24] what must I do have an open willing
[1:38:27] heart glory be to God
[1:38:32] there's another guy I'm thinking about
[1:38:34] right now and this guy he was of the
[1:38:37] ripe old age of 80 now we got people in
[1:38:42] here that are kind of close to that so
[1:38:44] don't you saying what you think about 80
[1:38:48] all right but here's a man by the name
[1:38:52] of Moses here's a guy who had been a
[1:38:58] good general right been a good generous
[1:39:02] guy had a lot of awards and things like
[1:39:04] that but he had God didn't want any of
[1:39:06] his awards God didn't want God allowed
[1:39:10] him to get all those awards and God
[1:39:11] allowed him to fall flat on his face
[1:39:14] because they say it wasn't about Moses
[1:39:16] strength you see it ain't about your
[1:39:19] strength when you look at trying to live
[1:39:20] a real Christian life and you look at it
[1:39:24] and say I just don't think I can do it
[1:39:26] you're right but remember that's the
[1:39:28] coward talking the coward can never
[1:39:32] fulfill the will of God but you just
[1:39:36] turn loose and say Lord what you're
[1:39:39] tapping on the inside of me what you're
[1:39:42] touching on the inside of me Lord Jesus
[1:39:44] let it be released in
[1:39:47] let it be released in me and here was a
[1:39:52] man by the name of Moses that we read
[1:39:55] about how once you think of this he
[1:39:57] couldn't talk it's hard to believe but
[1:40:02] he talked worse than me he stuttered it
[1:40:06] would seem like God would call somebody
[1:40:08] that least could speak he started it
[1:40:13] would seem like that God's not
[1:40:15] interested in the abilities you see God
[1:40:16] does this this is by design all of this
[1:40:21] is to give you an I faith that God takes
[1:40:26] all of our weaknesses but he manifests
[1:40:30] his glory through it
[1:40:33] he took one man and there was a one man
[1:40:36] invasion with him after he met God he
[1:40:41] goes right back down there to face what
[1:40:43] he run from or let me preach a little
[1:40:46] bit there Mountain things that you've
[1:40:48] run from but you meet God one time and
[1:40:51] you'll find yourself God prepares you in
[1:40:54] that moment to meet what you've run from
[1:40:57] he takes the scare be afraid the
[1:41:01] cowardness and he brings within you the
[1:41:04] strength of the Lion of Judah hallelujah
[1:41:10] he did that for Jacob think about this
[1:41:15] here's David and Goliath sometimes that
[1:41:17] ain't numbers you know what I mean
[1:41:19] twenty twenty-two thousand down three
[1:41:21] huh sometimes that ain't numbers
[1:41:22] sometimes it's just sighs you know what
[1:41:25] I mean it's just like sighs because a
[1:41:27] trail here is a trail here ain't
[1:41:31] sleeping is he oh come on a trail that's
[1:41:36] all right I don't mean to wake you ma
[1:41:37] can you come here a minute
[1:41:43] Hado how to get his shoes on I'll take
[1:41:45] mine off too if that helps him hey man
[1:41:51] you look sharp today buddy
[1:41:53] you know don't get caught out here come
[1:41:55] on up here I want them to see you okay
[1:41:58] here you stand right up here now this
[1:42:03] time yeah brother will you come over
[1:42:05] here come over here by the way brother
[1:42:10] women you know I love you buddy I'm just
[1:42:13] using you for example yeah you know who
[1:42:19] you're gonna represent who are you gonna
[1:42:24] represent David I love you let me give
[1:42:32] you a hug before I do this who do you
[1:42:36] think he's gonna represent a lie now
[1:42:42] look at this don't this look like a
[1:42:44] mismatch I mean you look at this right
[1:42:47] here for the way I'm go ahead turn
[1:42:48] around something see let me let me put
[1:42:52] you down here right now next thing that
[1:42:55] is a mismatch
[1:42:59] the odds are innumerable there's no way
[1:43:03] in the world you would say this little
[1:43:05] guy is gonna whip this guy but if you
[1:43:09] can see what's behind this guy right
[1:43:11] here
[1:43:22] there's a great big God standing behind
[1:43:26] a great big promise and they're
[1:43:29] wonderful and you know how I took down
[1:43:31] the giant right how'd he do it how did
[1:43:36] he do it how did he do it like this like
[1:43:42] that thank you
[1:43:46] god bless thank you sighs sighs so this
[1:43:53] one about numbers it's about science I
[1:43:56] mean my size I wouldn't even pick on
[1:43:58] brother William wrote grams said it like
[1:44:01] this concerning David and Goliath he
[1:44:04] said a man in his right mind would not
[1:44:06] even go pick on Goliath with a 3006
[1:44:11] naturally speaking but this one about a
[1:44:13] natural battle you see Goliath will say
[1:44:18] in all sorts of things to try to rattle
[1:44:20] David's
[1:44:21] cage you ain't nothing but a ruddy youth
[1:44:28] why you don't tell me how many quotes
[1:44:31] you know I can't remember a lot of them
[1:44:35] but I do know thus saith the Lord I did
[1:44:42] know God speaks to me in services I know
[1:44:46] that and I know he speaks to me when I
[1:44:48] I'm reading in his word I I know he
[1:44:50] speaks to me through the message I can't
[1:44:53] remember everything but I know he's
[1:44:54] speaking to me then that's the power you
[1:44:59] go in that's the might you go in God is
[1:45:03] speaking to me I don't care how good of
[1:45:07] a stone slinger that David was it wasn't
[1:45:11] his steel David didn't say all right
[1:45:14] devil let me tell you something
[1:45:19] okay David you can come up out of your
[1:45:20] yoga pose okay all right devil chapter
[1:45:25] so-and-so scripture so-and-so chapter
[1:45:27] so-and-so scripture so-and-so the devil
[1:45:30] would have left right at him
[1:45:31] it wasn't about all that he remembered
[1:45:35] it's what God quickened to him and this
[1:45:43] is the same way God never looks in
[1:45:47] numbers you know God right now when you
[1:45:51] look at all that's gathered in this
[1:45:52] church this morning God can do more with
[1:45:56] just three people two people one people
[1:45:59] God can do more that is surrendered in
[1:46:02] his will then he can with 1500 this
[1:46:06] message was not sent for masses and
[1:46:09] multitudes I'm not excluding nobody it's
[1:46:13] sent for the elect and it is God that
[1:46:18] brings you and I into place of surrender
[1:46:21] and submission we cannot even do that on
[1:46:26] our own accord you with me you know that
[1:46:29] in the scripture it's God who brings us
[1:46:32] into into that place now think about how
[1:46:35] a new room of this is let me just let me
[1:46:37] move on here now think about it through
[1:46:39] the scripture of how that God he laid it
[1:46:41] out through the scripture that you're
[1:46:43] gonna chase your enemies he said when he
[1:46:44] told before they were in the land you're
[1:46:46] gonna chase your enemies he told him
[1:46:48] also he said five of you will chase a
[1:46:50] hundred and a hundred of you will chase
[1:46:53] ten thousand don't you see why it's so
[1:46:55] important to fellowship with people of
[1:46:57] like precious faith it increases your
[1:47:01] faith that's why brother Ram says
[1:47:05] associate with people that believe like
[1:47:08] you believe I don't want to so Satan
[1:47:13] nobody don't believe in divine healing I
[1:47:15] don't associate with nobody don't
[1:47:17] believe in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:47:19] you understand
[1:47:20] I'm have to talk to him in the workplace
[1:47:22] but I want to so say we're believers I
[1:47:24] want to so said that men with people who
[1:47:27] believe that God is still God
[1:47:30] that's what I want associate with I want
[1:47:32] somebody when I'm down I'm going through
[1:47:34] something that can catch me call me and
[1:47:37] say let me tell you something mother
[1:47:38] Samuel God is still God he's still a
[1:47:42] comforter he's still a deliverer he's
[1:47:44] still a hero
[1:47:45] I want people and I want to be one of
[1:47:49] them people to you Alleluia I know I'm
[1:47:55] talking to some of you right here we've
[1:47:57] been through some battles we've been
[1:47:58] through things to where when doctors
[1:48:00] have said you might as well cut it off
[1:48:01] it ain't gonna do no good but when God
[1:48:03] stepped on the scene there's times where
[1:48:06] God has stepped on the scene he made
[1:48:07] himself known it wasn't man that did it
[1:48:10] got made himself known if God be for us
[1:48:16] who can be against us God takes the
[1:48:23] minority and he will whip the majority
[1:48:29] all the way through the scriptures a
[1:48:33] move of God is not about numbers because
[1:48:36] brother brems said it like this he said
[1:48:38] when Gideon it came to that place of the
[1:48:41] water I'm not gonna preach on that this
[1:48:43] morning but when it came to that place
[1:48:45] right there he said sometimes people
[1:48:48] wonder what is God doing when all this
[1:48:54] has taken he said but in those times
[1:48:56] God's building army to fight with God's
[1:49:00] building an army to fight with because
[1:49:03] he doesn't need numbers he just needs
[1:49:05] her rendered vessels that's why when you
[1:49:08] look across the Assembly in your own
[1:49:10] assemblies where you go when you look
[1:49:13] for God to move don't look upon other
[1:49:15] houses first you look for God to move in
[1:49:18] your life you want God to move it to
[1:49:22] your address he knows your address he
[1:49:24] knows right where you're living he comes
[1:49:26] right there and that's where you want
[1:49:28] God to move he's inside of you and
[1:49:31] through you lord I've got to move on
[1:49:35] here let's get to this place here in the
[1:49:38] scriptures
[1:49:38] I've got your Bibles
[1:49:44] go with me to judges 7/16 please well I
[1:49:55] didn't set my watch like brother Jesse
[1:49:56] did I just forgot
[1:50:09] here's God's answer by these 300 you're
[1:50:14] gonna smite him the Bible says in verse
[1:50:16] 16 of judges 7 he divided the 300 men
[1:50:22] into three companies you see
[1:50:26] understanding right here we don't have
[1:50:29] anything to wear
[1:50:30] God told him do this or God told him to
[1:50:32] do this God told him to do this but you
[1:50:34] see the wisdom of God is on the scene he
[1:50:40] knows how to we divide and we conquer
[1:50:44] you understand what I'm saying if God
[1:50:48] wanted to he could have us all living in
[1:50:49] a community together but we drive one
[1:50:52] another nuts be pulling blinds and
[1:50:57] locking doors and everything else you'd
[1:51:01] be trying to get out of the community
[1:51:02] and go God didn't want our lives to be
[1:51:04] lived in a communal way he showed that
[1:51:08] in the book of Acts he wanted it to
[1:51:11] start in Jerusalem but it's a go to the
[1:51:13] uttermost parts right God's put you
[1:51:18] right where he wants you you're a lot
[1:51:21] right where you are in the job where God
[1:51:25] has placed you in your family in your
[1:51:27] home
[1:51:28] God has divided to you you were portion
[1:51:32] you with me you believe that divided
[1:51:36] them into three companies look at this
[1:51:38] he put a trumpet in every man's hand
[1:51:41] with empty pitchers and lamps within the
[1:51:47] pitchers
[1:51:49] we're gonna go fight a battle with
[1:51:52] trumpets empty vessels and a torch in
[1:51:57] the vessel we're not gonna go defeat him
[1:52:00] like this yeah that's how we're gonna
[1:52:03] defeat him this is how we're going to
[1:52:05] beat him but see God didn't want a full
[1:52:08] vessel he didn't want a vessel there was
[1:52:12] even 10% for he wants an empty vessel
[1:52:19] you see this was showing what had
[1:52:22] happened there had been an emptying up
[1:52:25] of self this was a display of vessels
[1:52:31] that had been emptied up to the Lord
[1:52:33] and these weren't just any vessels these
[1:52:35] were fragile if you were to drop one of
[1:52:41] these vessels on the floor it would
[1:52:43] break that kind of sounds like me and
[1:52:48] you earthen vessels but it's not of our
[1:52:55] power its of the excellency of God's
[1:53:00] power so God places his life in the
[1:53:05] midst of an earthen vessel in the midst
[1:53:10] of a vessel that's so fragile that's
[1:53:14] what makes him so great he can become so
[1:53:19] small he can get inside of there and
[1:53:23] victory is manifest
[1:53:26] I wonder if Gideon you know getting was
[1:53:31] getting all these supplies together
[1:53:33] I wonder if Gideon was just singing a
[1:53:34] song around the camp Jesus we're
[1:53:37] dependent on you Jesus
[1:53:41] we're dependent on you
[1:53:44] Jesus we're dependent on coal now you
[1:53:50] can walk around in Molly Grubbs the
[1:53:52] Bible said look what Paul wrote by the
[1:53:54] Spirit of God that pertained all the way

[1:53:59] heart come on now everyone of us can

[1:55:32] want you you take the trumpet in the
[1:55:35] right hand and I want I want the torch
[1:55:38] and I want the vessels I want them here

[1:55:43] mountaintop and they're gonna their
[1:55:45] divining up they're going to encircle
[1:55:46] the camp 300 guys now remind you later
[1:55:52] on in another portion of the scripture

[1:55:56] right here was about 150 thousand and
[1:55:59] there was still a host that fled but 300
[1:56:03] circled them about you know God knows

[1:57:37] pictures the fire that was always there
[1:57:40] burning that fire is now unveil let me
[1:57:43] tell you what this was right here this
[1:57:45] was them empty vessels coming out of the
[1:57:50] upper room where the flower of God had
[1:57:53] come down in vessels and now that fire
[1:57:56] was reflecting out through their lives
[1:58:02] let me read you a little statement here
[1:58:04] the brother branham made we're going to
[1:58:07] put the devil on notice here
[1:58:10] well Rams sending a message come see we
[1:58:13] know that all the enemies are gathering
[1:58:15] around they come just as close as they
[1:58:18] can and we put it to you like this and I
[1:58:22] don't say this to be funny
[1:58:23] the any meal come so close to you could
[1:58:24] smell his breath you know I was trying
[1:58:28] to do he's trying to rattle you remember
[1:58:34] he came right up to brother brems face
[1:58:36] spit right in his face and that was
[1:58:38] running right down brother brems face
[1:58:40] right the man made even another lunch
[1:58:45] but God was in control they come just as
[1:58:50] close as they can but we know see look
[1:58:53] at this we know seated in this building
[1:58:56] somewhere around in midair around the
[1:58:59] platform here are angels of the Lord
[1:59:02] decisions must be made we stand as a
[1:59:06] representative of Jesus Christ you
[1:59:08] willing to do that stand as a
[1:59:10] representative of Jesus Christ now Lord
[1:59:13] may the enemy be defeated now has
[1:59:16] promised to us that we should cast out
[1:59:18] evil spirits that's what you said and I
[1:59:21] believe that Lord with all my heart
[1:59:23] let thy word be truth and every man a
[1:59:25] lie and it may be proven here tonight
[1:59:28] that your power will be so predominant
[1:59:31] that every evil spirit that would try to
[1:59:35] enter into the person or into the
[1:59:38] building or that's got anyone bound may
[1:59:41] they have to turn loose and get away and
[1:59:44] may there be a shout of victory
[1:59:46] everywhere Lord may we break the picture
[1:59:50] tonight and let the fire fly break the
[1:59:56] picture and let the fire fly you know
[2:00:00] when that fire gets loose
[2:00:02] there was an earthen vessel we don't
[2:00:05] even know her name all we know of her
[2:00:07] woman at the will one of these days with
[2:00:10] random Dimitar we're gonna mean she no
[2:00:13] longer be the woman at the well we're
[2:00:15] gonna have we're gonna know a name but
[2:00:18] her life was you could look at and say
[2:00:22] boy what a mess her life was in but you
[2:00:25] see God knew what was down beneath there
[2:00:27] and here God had an appointment he knew
[2:00:30] her address he knew when she would show
[2:00:33] up to that well just like he knew when
[2:00:35] Gideon would get to that tent God had
[2:00:37] everything arranged it was all by design
[2:00:40] and when that moment as the word began
[2:00:44] to deal with her life she realized this
[2:00:46] man does not know me but there are
[2:00:49] things being uncovered in my life that
[2:00:51] only God knows you know it wasn't just
[2:00:54] him exposing her sins but but that same
[2:00:56] voice
[2:00:57] held within it was just something
[2:00:59] resonating deep this is what I've been
[2:01:02] longing for this is what I've been
[2:01:06] needed this is really speaking to the
[2:01:11] depths of my life I'll tell you that day
[2:01:16] her life got lit on fire she went back
[2:01:20] running into that city think about it
[2:01:23] her reputation was not good at all
[2:01:25] who would have listened to her but there
[2:01:27] was something different inside that
[2:01:28] earthen vessel there was a torch there
[2:01:31] was a lamp there was fire that had been
[2:01:33] lit and it was not her words that was
[2:01:35] streaming off but it was God right there
[2:01:37] behind those words and it made a witness
[2:01:40] and a testimony I tell you that city was
[2:01:43] turned upside down if I heard testimony
[2:01:46] let the devil try to put that fire out
[2:01:48] he can't put that fire out like the
[2:01:51] little ones son this morning he can't
[2:01:54] blow that out I'm gonna let it shine
[2:01:56] this little light of mine I'm gonna let
[2:02:00] it shine and the devil locked the border
[2:02:04] he can't blow it out
[2:02:05] you can't put out this fire this is not
[2:02:08] a man-made fire hallelujah this is not a
[2:02:11] church fire this is the fire the
[2:02:14] original fire of the Holy Ghost that
[2:02:17] same fire that came down there and
[2:02:20] consumed the sacrifice on Calvary that
[2:02:22] same fire that was sent back on the day
[2:02:25] of Pentecost that same fire that has
[2:02:28] moved down through the ages and returned
[2:02:30] in the end time as the pillar fire in
[2:02:33] fullness to inhabit and Tabernacle the
[2:02:36] bride body same fire of God think about
[2:02:43] this this is what God said in his word
[2:02:47] I want you listen to me now we come and
[2:02:51] we hear the word Satan and watch if we
[2:02:58] don't act upon that word he won't move a
[2:03:02] bit
[2:03:04] let me tell you like this brother
[2:03:07] brandman acts of the Holy Spirit he said
[2:03:10] when what took place on that upper room
[2:03:12] when those 120 were filled with the Holy
[2:03:15] Ghost they came out of that room then he
[2:03:19] said there was three thousand that was
[2:03:21] added you know where I'm at in the Bible
[2:03:22] three thousands was added that day he
[2:03:25] said that devil never even moved off of
[2:03:28] his bed parents you understand what I'm
[2:03:33] talking about
[2:03:35] sometimes you try to get them to move
[2:03:36] out of their bed now i'ma call them
[2:03:38] devils but you talk about your children
[2:03:40] you're trying to get him to move you
[2:03:41] know snooze snooze snooze snooze come on
[2:03:45] now I'm not the only one
[2:03:47] maybe some of you say hey you don't know
[2:03:49] me and then kids it's me some of you
[2:03:55] might have cooperated the copyright to
[2:03:57] the snooze button but the devil didn't
[2:04:00] even move out of his bed but that day at
[2:04:04] the gate called beautiful that day when
[2:04:09] the power of God here being releasing a
[2:04:12] man who was crippled from his mother's
[2:04:13] womb he that in that moment how a Peter
[2:04:17] and John they look said look upon us
[2:04:19] silver and gold have we none but such as
[2:04:22] we have give unto you rise up in the
[2:04:24] name of Jesus Christ that right there
[2:04:27] brother Graham said that type of devil
[2:04:29] fired up he said the devil got out of
[2:04:31] bed that morning you know what it is
[2:04:32] when the word when you're letting the
[2:04:34] word live and flow through your life
[2:04:36] that makes a devil move but the devil
[2:04:40] don't have brother been telling like
[2:04:41] this
[2:04:42] he said the devil didn't care how much
[2:04:43] preaching was done he didn't care he
[2:04:48] said I'll let him preach but he said I
[2:04:49] can't let that divine healing get loose
[2:04:52] I cannot allow that to happen because I
[2:04:56] won't be able to control it you know
[2:04:57] that's exactly the way it is service
[2:05:00] after service allowing the Spirit of God
[2:05:02] to really have the right-of-way in your
[2:05:04] life you want to say in your heart say
[2:05:06] Lord don't let me just set here Lord let
[2:05:08] me be put into action Lord let me act
[2:05:11] upon the word I don't want Hell to look
[2:05:14] up and the demons and say don't worry
[2:05:16] him he'll enter in and he'll leave out
[2:05:18] the same way but I want him to have a
[2:05:20] rapport
[2:05:21] inhale to say when this guy goes to
[2:05:23] house of God when this guy listens to
[2:05:25] the word he lets the word strip him down
[2:05:28] he lets the word clean him out he lets
[2:05:31] the word put him into action
[2:05:34] hey man not just he's able to go out and
[2:05:38] tell me everything that I preached on
[2:05:41] her she can tell me everything no we
[2:05:43] want the word to put us into action
[2:05:48] because when the word puts us into
[2:05:50] action let me tell you something there's
[2:05:52] a reputation that goes before you and
[2:05:54] it's not the reputation of you it's the
[2:05:57] reputation of a mighty God he said it
[2:06:00] like this he said I'll be an enemy to
[2:06:03] your enemies and he said I'll be an
[2:06:05] adversary to your adversaries you know
[2:06:07] what an adversary is it's one who brings
[2:06:09] distress God said I'll be an adversary
[2:06:13] to your head Viserys hallelujah think
[2:06:19] about it now when they came into the
[2:06:21] land those two spies went up there
[2:06:23] here's RAM they make a visit there and
[2:06:28] she lets him know we've heard we've
[2:06:34] heard what the Lord God he is God and
[2:06:38] you know what she said she didn't know
[2:06:40] the book of Deuteronomy she didn't know
[2:06:43] what God had said to them but she quoted
[2:06:46] word for word what God's desire was in
[2:06:50] the book of Deuteronomy
[2:06:51] he said that they may know that God in
[2:06:55] heaven is God in earth she declared that
[2:07:00] and she said as soon as the report came
[2:07:03] in to our city the hearts did melt now
[2:07:10] you might look and you might think me no
[2:07:12] no it ain't you it ain't you hitting me
[2:07:16] it's god but God takes vessels that are
[2:07:22] yielded to him he doesn't want numbers
[2:07:25] he just needs surrendered
[2:07:29] it don't matter how remember we looked
[2:07:31] at this it don't matter how big you are
[2:07:33] you don't matter how small you are you
[2:07:35] don't matter how long you been in the
[2:07:37] message or how short of a time you've
[2:07:39] been in the message what matters is is
[2:07:42] how the message is able to live through
[2:07:46] you does the Holy Spirit have
[2:07:51] preeminence in your life now coming down
[2:08:03] they start killing one another you know
[2:08:05] Devils boy they just didn't know what to
[2:08:07] do they just start turning on one

[2:10:59] the perfect people he came to bring a
[2:11:01] word and minister to you this is your
[2:11:03] hour of deliverance this is your time
