Lord that we rejoice or God and your glorious working father Lord we just committed into your hands tonight Lord and ask you to anoint the lips and ears in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's look in our Bibles if you would to Exodus 15 in Exodus the fifteenth chapter and I just want to read just a few verses and then we're gonna just let you have your seats Bible says then sing Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him and habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Amen god bless you as you're being seated this evening I want to take that little thought here this evening for a few moments I will sing unto the Lord I will sing unto the Lord you think of where that Israel is standing here in this time and where they've just you know move from there the previous chapter of where that Pharaoh and his army was pursuing them we recognize that you know when Moses came to this place here then you know there was prophecy that went forth these Egyptians that you see today you'll see them no more and Moses had spoke with great authority the Spirit of God moving upon his heart that he would speak and expressed and still and see the salvation of the Lord and yet within the very next verse we we don't know if how much time we don't know it was it that Moses himself evidently had had made a petition unto the Lord of what do i do you know the the the the spirit of prophecy it's truckin but then he looked at the situation and notice you know God takes Moses to this place that Moses would actually have confidence in the anointing that was upon his life because God had already commissioned him and the Commission could not change and brother Bram takes us to this in the message why Christ speak that he speaks in July of 63 and he said what God was bringing Moses back to is to have confidence in the anointing that is upon your life and brother brems says that's where we need to reside is to have confidence on the anointing that God has placed in our life and brother Graham places it like this and I don't want to dwell so much upon this but he says when Moses was down in Egypt God would tell Moses go do this and Moses went and did it he said then God would say do this Moses went and did it do this Moses went and did it so it was so much to where God was telling me do this he would do that do this he would do that but here it came to a time for Moses to stand upon the thority of the anointing that God had placed in his life and God was not telling him Oh Moses here's the Red Sea and here's everything that's taking place and and this is what I want you to do he's come to an obstacle and God said I'm not gonna pull you through a pipe but you're gonna make a decision based on this and you're going to make it based on the anointing that's in your life there is an obstacle in your way and I why are you crying unto me speak that the people go forward and I believe that that's exactly where the Spirit of God brings us to in this hour as the sons and daughters of God is to have confidence in the anointing of the Holy Spirit the word that is broke up on our lives and to see that this prophetic utterance that it went forth and how that the Red Sea itself was parted this was an experience for the children of Israel of how that they in Moses would would be led by the Spirit of God to speak and how that you know you find that after Moses had spoke the wind begin to come through and you know it's just like that you know brother brems said when you want the Holy Ghost in your meetings you preach the word and you watch how the holy spirit will come right behind the word it's just like that in Ezekiel 37 when they looked upon the dry bones and said son of man can these dry bones live again and then it says prophesize son of man and has the word itself begin to come forth there was a wind a living reality that come right behind the word to bring to past what was spoken so here the people of God are crossing right through where the word has made a way where there was no way at that time but God remember he's displaying his power to Israel in this time God is making this as a memorial this is an experience that God wants Israel to draw upon you you realize within your life in my life there are experiences that you and I go through that you know sometimes you go to tell somebody else and and it's a supernatural reality around it but to the other person they can rejoice in it but it doesn't have the depth of meaning to them me or you as it would to you personally but you see why that is that's because it is for you personally there will be things come again in your life and you will actually have to draw upon the experience that God has brought you through that's why everything within our lives is so unique it's God working so personally with us like he did with Israel so when situations arise that would be similar to this you are able to draw by the Spirit of God upon remembrances of things that God himself has already done and what does it do it brings faith when you're looking at the situation we saw that in David's life with the line with the bear and then he drew upon that when he actually was facing Goliath - the look at this of how that you know they're walking now in the midst of this time and I want to break in a little more into this song in Exodus 15 if we could continue reading here a little bit in verse 4 notice this song as it would be as it would be sung pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also drowned in the Red Sea the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone thy right hand O Lord is become glorious in power by right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy remember now Moses is singing unto the Lord he is actually singing back to the Lord that which he himself has witnessed the Lord do and I find it in striking of how that this song of how that it is struck within this moment and all of these details that would be laying within here that Moses would find you know maybe we could look over the wholeness of this of this particular event and say man it's just God's redemptive power and it indeed is God's redemptive power you know brother BAM tells us regarding this chapter he said God had already redeemed him by blood he said but God wanted to make known to Israel that redemption is not just my blood but redemption comes with power and that redemption is by a person so the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name remember God is causing his name to be made known in this time now remember what his name is his name is I am that I am this name as he revealed himself to Moses this will be a memorial through all generations and God's name is actually being made manifest in this time upon the very army of Pharaoh now think about it in your life in my life the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is actually it's not torn down by sinners but his reputation is actually made in the presence of sinners where he would change and transform our lives whereby the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not just you and I say well yeah I'm a Christian but remember it was not them in the book of Acts that called themselves Christians but it was the life that was so pre-eminently identified the name of Jesus Christ was so on display in their life actions not just things they said but their life to where they first called them Christians they're there in Antioch they didn't go around saying it of themselves but it was and I did of that life and after all we know that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's more than just having a name but it's to be actually be identified in that name by having the same life that was within the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ is that right the Bible says in the Book of Isaiah there would be seven women that would take hold upon one man and say give us your name but we'll eat our own bread you just give us your name so we can take away our reproach remember jesus also said in the book of matthew there would be many that will come to me on that day and they'll say haven't we cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful things in thy name but the reality is they were just merely using his name they were not identified in his name by his name you see it's like forgery on a cheque they really did not have the substance of the life within them but yet they were using the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the sick to be healed devils to be cast out but yet they were not actually identified in that name by a ceremony where they have become one with the Lord Jesus Christ but you see how that here in the midst of this exodus of this song that Moses would break out and he begins to go further and say in verse seven in the greatness of thine excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sent us forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together have you noticed within this reading it makes it as though God is a man but yet God is a spirit you'll notice it'll talk about God's right hand it'll speak about nostrils it'll speak about this right God Himself coming down and becoming so personal among his people what is it it's God's presence the Living God manifesting his power among his people now the think of this of how it would go on and say with the blast of my nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as a heat and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemies I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil now you see you look at this within the midst of it in a song that how that Moses would be permitted by inspiration to actually gather what was the heart behind Pharaoh and coming after them then I'll not be a marvel to us the Bible even when you think of this in different hymns and songs that's been written remember I would not be denied old Satan said My Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer but praise the Lord the work is done and Christ our Lord is here you see it reveals this working of Satan's whole undermining his whole scheme it's actually now been an uncovering and taking over of what it is that he's longed to do it was my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them how did it blow with I wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters oh my verse 11 notice how then Moses keeps singing here who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders thou stretches out by hand the earth swallowed them thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou has redeemed thou has guided them in by strength unto thy holy habitation now watch this here watch how it starts to break over from a present experience into the prophetic now the song itself actually begins to move into the prophecy of when Israel will actually come into position now watch this here the people shall hear and be afraid sorrows shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestine then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed the mighty men of Moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of dying they shall be as a stone till thy people pass over O Lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o Lord which thou has made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary O Lord which thy hands have established the Lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea this was indeed a song being sung it was a song that was being sung unto the Lord you think of how that God would you know have his name to be made known when you read these verses that we just read here this event that would take place here when God would display his power it would actually send tremors of fear through the dukes of e9 edom it would actually cause those in Canaan and those who were there holding places it would cause them to tremble remember when they came to Rahab she said at that time our hearts did melt within us that remain no courage anymore when the people here had heard how the Lord hath opened up the rods the Red Sea and caused you to go on dry ground you remember that it had already reached there now think about this when you look at God's name the reputation because after all God had told them in the book of Deuteronomy that you shall be the name of the Lord shall be seen upon you that you are called by the name of the Lord Oh what a blessed thing it is to be identified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what a blessing and reality it is to be identified in that name having the life that name flowing through you and you and I what a reality that it moves within our hearts now to think of this you know when Moses you know would start in here in this time you know he moves upon the bank and to think about it how brother branham would place it within this measure here he said you know when Moses and then when they came out they had walked across that of you know of the Red Sea and when they came out of it you know he said it's like the spirit itself and maybe pulled back but then Moses and them got to looking around and they begin to see what had taken place and what God had done and when they begin to look this wants you to catch they begin to look at what God had done for them and there when they begin to see that brother Brent said they just got excited he said they they just got so excited he said that Moses himself got in the spirit and begin to raise his hands and worship so when you look at it Moses his worship the song that is actually being sung unto the Lord by Moses and the rest of Israel is because of an experience that they themselves has just they they've just come through this experience and they're standing on the other side I mean the inspiration has struck them and packed them away you see the Bible goes on to tell us here in the next few verses of how that Miriam that Miriam herself she began to rejoice you see the Bible opens up with Moses there in the scripture and says how the children of Israel were rejoicing the minute breaks on down and tells us how that Miriam herself began to take up timbrels tambourines and she begin to move and as she moved all the rest of the daughters followed suit brother brems told us like this he said what it was he said it was like atoms that had just began to move from one to another and the Spirit of God was moving right there in that service and it had begin to just move from one to another as Moses and them were singing in the spirit Oh to think of this and what this really types that one day oh my when the resurrection will come that of them when you look at the elect of God there'll be Miriam's that are raised up and they will reach over and grab this one and reach over and grab this one and reach over and grab this one and you talking about a time of rejoicing you've never seen such a time of rejoicing no wonder the prophet could say you heard me sing amazing grace here wait till you hear me sing it over there all glory be to God here they are rejoicing there are witnessing what God has done and Moses got in the spirit you know brother Branham brings it to us over and over he says you know that same Holy Ghost that was upon Moses is the same holy spirit that's in this building tonight he said no wonder when that Moses could sing a new song and sing in the spirit you know this song had never been sung before there was inspiration that dropped in that moment now I know for you and I their songs sometimes that will come back to us and will inspire us and that's true but this was a new song that was dealing with the experience and the way that the presence of the Lord was moving within that time and Moses could look and the rest of them could see what the dead Egyptians tell me why they shouldn't be happy tell me why they shouldn't be rejoicing you know that's just how it is for you and I when we come into the house of God we can sit here and sing songs by memory or we can enter into the presence of God and actually have a connection and experience with that now you know when you look at him and you think about it they were not just singing a song they were singing unto the Lord they were singing about an event where they could see dead Egyptians laying on the seashore how about you and I tonight where we can sing about things that God has doing in our life has done in our life to think about it when we sing of that song on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross we can still go back and think if it hadn't been for the Lord Jesus where would I be I tell you you go to thinking like that you'll find yourself entering right into worship when you begin to sing those songs and you begin to think like they did when they saw those Egyptians and brother Brent said when they saw those Egyptians then they got in the and begin to worship you see sometimes it matters what we're looking at you can come into the house of God you can look at it you can look at things you can be sitting right here and look at your problems you can look at your difficulties you can look around and maybe this is not right or that's not right the wrong court here or whatever more not the right temperature and you can allow the enemy to take away and bring you away from the warship that will prepare you for the words that come forth or you can set there and call him at it and say huh you're not getting my praise in my worship you are not going to get my mind you are not going to get me trapped on that no sir I am NOT falling for that I have come here tonight to worship the Lord I've come to hear from God and I choose to focus upon dead Egyptians I choose to focus on God in his healing power that God has delivered me no sir I am not focusing on the negative of my situation I'm focusing on the word that says he's my provider because he's provided for me all along oh my sometimes people think once they get to the house of God you've got it mate you've just entered the battle oh ma Moses begin to get in the spirit when he saw the dead Egyptians no brother Brandon you know he'll talk to you he'll bring this in many different ways when you think of even Elijah the spirit memory last room when he looked at Jehoshaphat Elisha was not in the right demeanour he was not in the right way for the spirit of prophecy to come upon his life brother Graham said there had to be some good old spiritual songs sung that would actually change the mood of the Prophet so that the Spirit of God could come on him oh my think how many times brother Graham said I was sitting back there in the office he said of all the interviews and he said every people come in and go and he says I was all torn up he said that I sat right back there he's sitting through the song service he said oh my how you were singing said it ministered to me to wear that I could come and stand here and preach you see there's an order there's an order God knows how to minister to you and I now when I look at this you know how they came to the other side but I said when they got their feet on the other side there was inspiration that had had struck Moses in that hour you know it was that of God's sovereign power this this song was not a song about anything that they had done it was a song about what the Lord had just done and what he did he will also do know the words he brought us through the Red Sea by his fire by his power he will also by that same power bring us into the land Omaha no wonder you and I could sing oh lord send the power just now because we recognize it's that same power that we're living off of that we're watering right now that same Holy Ghost will pack us into the presence of our bridegroom it's the same power of God the same quickening power of God that's residing in our soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will literally pack us across that Great Divide of time into eternity where our bodies will be changed God's presence I want you to think of this here in this song inspiration had dropped spontaneously this was not something that they could have worked up this was not a work up this was not some this was a rejoicing this was a rejoicing there was no mistaking here there was this respondent Aeneas worship inspiration had dropped because of the present circumstances you're talking about a song that they had in the midst of that time now think about this this is a song that God it's not just a song that you know is just gonna be sung one time but this is a some that God is gonna want Israel to remember time and time again because they're going to come up against some very hard times they're going to come into some situations that the Red Sea it's just like you and I we come through a test or trial and then the next test or trial comes we'll think dear Lord this tester trout ain't nothing like the rest of them Lord I'll take the one that I had before and in reality we felt the same way before as we do now you know what it comes down to the weakness and frailty of our humanity is displayed in that we can do nothing in ourselves so here is Moses in the midst of this time inspiration drops down and you know he begins to worship and the rest of Israel begins to worship and it is God declaring his power now listen to me it's God declaring his power and God declaring that I am present among you you know when you look at this Wysong it didn't say that Moses began to preach I can't imagine he felt like preaching no doubt he felt like it but you see he did in one way because it was there's one way that gospel can also go forth and song we'll get to it here in a moment you see he began to sing under inspiration how the Holy Spirit was opening in that time and you know how it is that when words are set to a melody somebody can begin to hum that melody and all they have to do is start humming that and you can start finishing words it'll trigger something that you've forgot about I'll think about it here I was thinking about it the other day I was standing in an office a store or restaurant and I was standing there and you know as I was standing there then all of a sudden you know that the song itself that was playing it began to stand out to me and as it was standing out to me I remembered that song as far as in the words it was a worldly song I remembered the words of it but what it is is that as that song was being played I was a ten year old boy back on the school bus in the country again 33 years I had been transported back to that moment of being a little boy has ten years old nine years old on the school bus and you know how many times where where I rode the school bus we were on it for an hour an hour to school and an hour home from school so you know you heard the music you heard all sorts of things that you know probably my parents wouldn't have wanted me to hear but you hear those things and all the melodies but to think of that of how that God himself that's just Satan's way of using it but we realized that you know within music itself the devil is not the originator of anything remember he is just a pervert er of what is righteous you think about it in the days of Daniel when Daniel and the Hebrew children were in the time of Babylon how were they called to worship that image it was by music wasn't it it was by music when the soul trees and all those things would go forth then the rest of Babylon would actually know at that time it's time to go and worship it was a music that was taking place within that hour now think of it why is it that Daniel and the rest of the Hebrew children they did not go because they were believers it didn't matter if they were in Babylon they were still believers and what it is Daniel and the rest of them had discernment to know that song don't sound right that song don't have the right lyrics to it that song just don't seem to have the right beat to it so they were not drawn in worship you see what they had was not a code of what are acceptable hymns by that of Daniel and the Hebrew no it was not that they were not going to start some sort of a denomination organization they didn't need their own hymnal they had the same God who had inspired one of the prophets David and by that same inspiration there would be a discernment of a holy spirit to know what songs are appropriate and what songs are not appropriate well thank God for the Holy Ghost so when we look at this here the you know why would God set this to be a song because God would want this to be recalled and it to be a song that would be sung over and over now you know when they get to looking at a lot of this year what astounds me and some of the medical professionals here would would know this and understand it is that they find where there are people who actually have memory loss that when they have memory loss sometimes short term and what-have-you they they're not able to remember certain things but if they can find you know the time period maybe when that person was a teenager then they can find when they were in their 20s and so forth and then they look for songs of during that time now they would have to ask him where they serve in the Lord at the time or whatever more and they would actually begin to play certain songs they find that there would be a trigger of the memory and it would actually begin to stir up the memories within those people that had absolutely lost their short-term memory well that all not be no Marvel to you and I God does that time and time again for you and I he comes and he plays a song he plays the music he comes in and begins to move upon our life to do what calls us to remember who we are you see when you look at it even among dementia patients and Alzheimer's patients when I was reading many of their articles just looking at those things they find that even when that of dimension better then of Alzheimer's which we know is the progressed advanced of that that even when were among those patients and things when they themselves have come to a place no longer talking but they have found you play music you find the actual songs that they would like and when they themselves have come to a place they're no longer talking but yet you let certain music be played and they'll be able to sing that song word for word what is it it's something about music that actually will reach down and bring forth words when they can't even remember their name you with me so to look at this at how that even the therapists have said that there are those who were through therapy and when they found out this patient likes certain songs like the family members had told him and so forth they in order to get that patient to actually stay in therapy instead of just walking a few steps and saying I'm tired they actually found certain songs and they would sing those songs and the patient would sing the songs back and what they found is that patient would actually walk a lot further or aren't you glad that without the song you and I would only be taking a few steps but because of the song of the Holy Spirit and God knows how that may bring that song right down our way he keeps us walking right instead onward Christian soldiers marching as to war I know the devil's gotta stop but God is remembered the author and the origin safeand don't have nothing on God well repeater God look at this so think about it you and I what about you and I you and I were in a place of some bad amnesia come on somebody we were in a situation of bad amnesia and we needed a song to bring us back to reality it couldn't just be any old song it had to be a new song that was sung that would actually joked that of our memory to bring us back to I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God bring us back to that reality so God uses music now he don't use music maybe in the way that you know as we're looking at it tonight yet he does but God remember this entire book is one great music sheet the notes that are wrote upon the straight music sheet are actually in the lives of his believing children and so God Himself being the great composer he himself knows exactly where every note is at and he knows how to positionally place every note when an eighth note wants to run and follow after a quarter note note note you stay right here 16th I need you right here 32nd I need you right there now look at our lives our lives our arrangement of different notes but yet when it's brought under the great harmony orchestration of the great composer and director of the Holy Ghost it begins to bring out a symphonic sound that will reflect the melody that was actually contained and tracked here in this old violin this music sheet so I will sing unto the Lord once I've been released I'll sing unto the Lord to think of this song this song of the sea' as it's called in the Book of Revelations is called the song of Moses Israel themselves you know it would speak prophetically and hound that this melody itself would strike you know even God would tell Moses in Deuteronomy 32 that he would want Moses to write down that doubt of the curse things that of the blessings and he wanted it to be put to a song and Moses was told in Deuteronomy 31 and 32 teach this song to the people so when we think about this here you know music it has the ability to transport us different places home I think of how that David would say this in Psalms 37 verse 6 he said for this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou may us be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance this is David's rest he knows trouble is coming he knows the trials that will come his way great pearl but yet this is the promise thou shalt compass me round about with songs of deliverance how would he compass him about with songs of deliverance it would be with songs that David would know and be able to actually draw strength from those songs in the midst of the time when he's being tried he would actually draw strength from deliverance that's how you and I draw strength because we draw strength from there's deliverance he is my deliverer I don't want no singing of a sad song I wonder when I'm going through trouble I want that song and melody to be he's my deliverer he is my strength he is my song all glory so David had his own little special created playlist except he didn't create the playlist God did glory be to God it was a playlist that was specially this was a an album you know that was dedicated to times of deliverance oh boy oh ma think of this here you know when you look at it it matters where you and I are as to what we're singing it matters where we are just think of that for a moment it matters where we are when we're singing now think of this here in Psalms 37 David would say like this this is prophetic of the Exile to Babylon that would come by the rivers of Babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered Zion we hanged our harps upon the Willows in the midst thereof for there they carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of Zion how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land if I'll forget thee O Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy notice scoffers mockers that have carried him away they're not asking them as though but the song have a meaning to them they are just simply in a way of mocking them sing us one of the songs of Zion come on be mirth be happy but you see how they look in this time they regard all help you here min and I they regard these songs of Zion as the song of the Lord they took this collection this is the song of the Lord and we will not sing this to mockery this is a song that is to be sung to the Lord they were not going to obey that the songs of Zion to be sung but once they would get back home to the place of worship ah this is the place where the songs of Zion are to be sung you see it matters where you're singing them you take for example a person maybe this will help make it more plain you take for example a person that can sing amazing grace now maybe here their life they've just surrendered their life to the Lord and maybe here their life is still filled with all sorts of things in their life but they have received him as their Savior the same desires and things are still prevalent within their life if they were smoker they're still smoking drinking still drinking and whatever more but yet within their heart they have looked at it and said I repent of my sins I receive you Lord God I want you to be my Lord and Savior they experienced a redemptive work by the measure of the holy spirit releasing them and they feel the burden lift off of their shoulders now you ask them to sing Amazing Race Hey they'll sing amazing grace a lot different before that took place in their life but then you wait until after in their life that their life themselves the heart itself has been emptied out it's been scoured out they made they pass through the blood of Jesus Christ then they'll sing amazing grace a little different than they did before then they keep on walking with the Lord and now they'll sing that same song Amazing Grace but they'll sing it being filled with with the supreme grace of God the Holy Ghost and they'll sing it brother different than they ever sung it before what changed was a a song that changed know was that the lyrics had changed no was it the music no what is it it's where the person is dwelling at that matters are you with me there's many that could sing amazing grace lord have mercy Elvis Presley could sing amazing grace like nobody's business he would sing it tears would come to the eyes so when we look at that we could say well I'm not going to sing amazing grace why not it was not the devil that inspired that song it was the Holy Ghost that inspired that song it's something that has a meaning to our lives are you with me it matters where you're at you with me one of the songs we just sung here tonight he is here hallelujah he is here a man that was written out there by a writer Curt le it was written out there but when you look at it now think of it now when you look at those things of where that was buddy there was truth that is within that song that actually identifies the presence of the Lord among us I'll tell you right now Kurt Kali might have been the writer of it as far as the instrument that the Holy Spirit would have used to pin it but brother I'm telling you right now you cannot sing that song unless you're behind the veil I'm talking about in a real reality they could sing in on any home come and they want to sing it on but when it's somebody behind the veil brother it matters where you are where you are will have a difference on that song you take like the song of the lighthouse oh my the Goodman's would sing that song but brother I'm telling you you take it about a redeemed child of God that's passed beyond you know that the curtain there and into the veil where the glory of God never fails and the advancement of the gospel now I'm not taking anything away of where they were before you understand that but you recognize there's an understanding that's a greater understanding today when we sing that song of the lighthouse it's not the lyrics that have advanced but it's a holy goes that has advanced us and when we sing that soul we sing it with greater understand Oh glory glory glory you see is because of where we are located how many know that the song one of them may know how I got to about my heart here the past few weeks look they have studied these things and I got to looking at that song they know what song one of them now if I were to ask you one of them what would you identify that with I mean if there was an organization or a name of a people you would say Pentecostals right brother branham himself when he would sing it going down the street there in Memphis brother em said I was all tied up you know he said I was so nervous from everything that had taken place he said so I started singing the song one of them he said I was trying to get my mind fixed on that song he said you know that Pentecostals song uuugh Pentecostals he said that sing one of them do you realize that song was not even wrote by Pentecostal that song was wrote before Azusa Street ever came it was wrote by a man who was a Baptist Methodist and then he retired out as that of a pastor of a Church of Nazarene so my question is when I look at that song who gave him the inspiration the Holy Ghost do we not sing it because he's of the Church of the Nazarene or do we recognize oh this man might have his name on it but this has the copyright of the Holy Ghost all over it I'm one of them I've one of them you see what it is it's not that we need to create our own hymnals brother we're not about denominationalism well we need is the discernment of the Holy Ghost and to use the filter of the word to filter the sounds and the messages that are coming come on somebody Amen we need to have confidence in the Holy Ghost when I look at this and I think about it within Israel my about a year ago and I went looking it up again because I remember some one of the brothers they're some of the pastor's have sent me this song of a group of young men that had some of them had come from South Africa someone had come from different places throughout the world and here they were they were singing in Jerusalem there looking over the mountains and they sang these words we've come home we've come home Nevermore to Rome after 2,000 years we've come home but I'm telling you that morning when I opened that up and that had been sin I tell you could just sense the presence of God just move right off of that when I begin to elicit that I said praise God very joycie think of how the Spirit of God is preparing them getting them in position to receive the two witnesses brother what about you and I it was promised that the bride would come back he would come back to the original glory that seed that went in the ground that church that started on the day of Pentecost he would bring it back in his power and his glory I say tonight we've got a new song we have come back home we have come back home after 2,000 years never more to Rome we have come back home it's a song that has meaning to us think of calluses calluses is in the temple they are singing Psalms 22 they are singing the psalm that the Spirit of God would catch David up in and David would speak with prophetic utterance regarding the Messiah they had learned this song calluses and the rest of them they sung this song and they would sing it every certain day it's just like certain songs her son had to pass over certain songs are sung every morning certain song it's just a really a blessing when you study and look at it there are certain songs that are sung within that time that is a designated time of the Eastern and certain things that take place but you find Caiaphas is here he is singing this song I want you to think deep here he's singing this song out of tradition and he's missing what God is doing that's why we don't want to sing songs by tradition we don't want this message to be a song of tradition come on friends we don't need to put any filters on it though God has given us the filter he's given us the filter of the word the Holy Ghost we don't need man-made ideas and man-made Creed's and man-made double we don't need that we need the Lord just to lead us you see Caiaphas is here he was crucifying the very word that he was singing about now to think about this that didn't make Psalms 22 a bad song to sing hello somebody the word was being crucified and they were singing it and they were crucifying it but you see what it is they didn't have on the end understanding and that's why Paul could say in the book of 1st Corinthians chapter 14 when I pray I'll pray with understanding when I sing I'll sing with understanding you see God wants us to sing with understanding that's exactly what Israel was singing at that time when the Spirit of God struck their life they were singing with understanding Caiaphas's was not singing with that understanding but to think how that Paul himself remember Paul would say when they're reading this music sheet the veil is still upon their heart when they read Moses why because they're focused on Moses instead of the God who actually used Moses and so the veil is upon their heart they're still singing the same songs but it is not brought a liberty and a loosening to their life but to know how that Paul led by the Spirit of God he himself moved by the unction of the Holy Ghost he's moved into the same spirit of the composer and Paul standing there as a director begins to assemble the musicians that are deigned in that hour to beat out the song and Paul himself would bring the prophets see of Psalms 22 and he would bring it to a press intense happening where he would speak of the great condescension of Almighty God and he would say it like this in verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which calls he's not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee you see God Himself becoming our supreme sacrifice venez he ascended up onto the minitor you'll see as the true atonement now he sends back his own life the Spirit of God they're tying you and I in to the real true atonement and we having that same life within us it is that same Lord Jesus Christ declaring the name of the Lord to you and I and in the midst of his church walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's singing praises you know what that word means to sing praise it means to sing hymns aloud to a heroic event one who has conquered you realize your life it sings a song there is a song that song out of your life and that song is a song that says I will sing unto the Lord the Lord have conquered the horse rider in my life overthrown sin in my life the Lord a triumph lorry asleep in my life do you realize that's what the name of the Lord does in the life of a believer Oh glory he has taken notes that were laid out and arranges them for the great symphony you know brother Branham would say it like this he says you know God asked Moses what you got in your hand Moses said well I got a stick but you see God knew what he had in his hand but God wanted him to recognize God knew and God was attentive to it brother dramas talking about how he said look he said no matter how little or how you know significant what's in your hand you may not have a stick but you can testify you can sing or you can pass out tracts you can pale somebody whatever's in your hand get moving let's fill these seats up and get people saved and filled with the Holy Ghost whatever God has put in your hand use it think of this here let me come down here brother Evan says all I just love good singing he said we're grateful to these men who are with us he said for sister su carrion and the other singers the musicians and so forth to bring us the gospel in the way of singing and in music he realized that God God himself now with music now as we look at this year God with music took a time when Jehoshaphat and them did not know what to do when the army was approaching and the Bible says one of theirs of the priests I believe is one of those who would be of the song of the song leaders in that time rose up there under the spirit of prophecy and begin to prophesy and how that you find that the Bible says that they went out God said you'll not have to fight today but you'll just stand still and watch the Lord fight for you the Bible says they sent out singers special singers ahead and they sung Beauty to His Holiness and when they begin to sing that song the Bible says that the enemy begin to smite one another and they smote one another too where Israel then came on the scene and they just simply had to pick up the spoils now you tell me you would like to have have more services like that come on where we can just go and pick up spoil come on somebody you see you may not be the miriam that starts it but when miriam starts get your tambourine and get going get your hands and get going start moving within the spirit what little Sonya I don't want to get in the flesh you realize friends you're gonna stay in the flesh if you stay in that attitude you've got to make up your mind what kind of a flesh or attitude do you want I'll tell you right now there's a lot of things that can look negative all around but brother there ain't nothing negative in the Lord Jesus Christ when I've come to the house of God I don't come to look at all of the problems and all the weaknesses and everything else I come here to worship the Lord I come here to deliver my heart and preach what God has placed on my heart I come here with a delight to hear from Almighty God I want to see God move [Applause] [Music] hallelujah to think of this here of how that David would say it like this and they just try to come down David would make it known like this in Psalms 119 he would say that statuettes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage that statures notice that statuettes have been my songs so David by the help of the Holy Spirit the Sun his statuettes were not just things of mere words but there had actually been an assembling and arrangement together by the Spirit of God to wear the statues themselves were not just words they were songs to him in his pilgrimage what you're glad for songs remember songs themselves just a little tune just a little melody it can get you thinking the right way you're not see just a little melody just a little bit can actually take your thinking and open you up the right way God knows exactly what he's doing no wonder that the scripture Paul would admonish us in this hour in the book of Ephesians chapter 5 and say be and maybe you're not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord come on somebody this right here was already a playlist before that term ever came up this was not created by iTunes this is from the I am he don't have junk music on his site mother when he downloads these things in your life these are songs that are a part in your life they are chords that can be struck in that time as a matter of fact that word says making melody in your heart it means that corresponding part that when the Spirit of God moves down there's a vibration on the inside that corresponds let the spirit of Almighty God Paul would go on and say in Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord you see this journey what God is doing right here for Israel they're going to come into more opposition this is a practical practical song they're going to come into times when things aren't just right maybe it'll be financial maybe it'll be me when they have are going through physical things in their life and they're gonna need to sing this song now you know it may not be that they would remember that song but maybe one of the brothers would you know they would have a little arrangement and they would get up and say we got a special today oh yeah wonder what wonder what song it is it's it's one you all know really you know and they would get up and start singing it and maybe they're here this one in the congregation it would strike their heart it wasn't that they didn't know it they might actually be able to sing along with the words but telling what's going on it's actually the Spirit of God that's moving at that time to minister to them inside God knows what he's doing with music when I think of it and I've studied many of the great ones down through time some of the great things when we look at songs that have been wrote you think of songs like that of one of them you think of how brother branham look at this now watch how brother Branham stood here you many of you know how brother Ram talks about brother booth-clibborn right how brother Ram talks about him and brother Ram says I love that song that he wrote down from his glory he said what a song of divine inspiration in this hour he said when all of the organizations are working to take away the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ he said but right in the midst of that song he said oh I love that song and yet brother booth-clibborn is the very one that would tell brother Branham you don't know your Bible real well but brother Branham says but I know the author real well but the random would also go on to tell us he said now brother booth cleverly said of loving he's a bosom friend he said to what it is he said we don't even see eye to eye on doctrine they didn't see eye to eye but you see what it was how could be the random sing down from his glory because brother banner recognized he was inspiration from the Holy Ghost it passes through the filter of the word and declared Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever I hope you understand what I'm saying we might have a book that's called the only belief book but brother Branham never put that together that is not the message hymnal come on somebody you recognize what the Methodists did in their day they actually formed a convention that brother Brennan would talk about where the Methodists no longer wanted certain songs sung and put in their hymnals brother I'm glad that were free we don't got no man-made hymnal we don't got a checker can I sing this song can I sing that song can I sing this song oh my the Holy Ghost the mighty angel is among us to let us know and bring discernment in this hour rather we don't need the leadership a man when we've got the leadership of the Holy Ghost the leadership of the world and don't worry I'll tell you what there's some songs that have been written that you know what have no part to be sung not just in a church they have no part to be sung among believers but then there's other songs that the Holy Spirit now remember depends on where you're at oh my to think of it how when the Holy Spirit when it's fire brother brandman he would sing one of them oh ma he's sung one of them a whole lot more with a greater understanding and then what those who wrote it it was sung with more understanding than what it was at Azusa Street come on somebody where does it matter it matters where you're standing glory be to God so to think of this practical out working within the songs and music that God would allow to come about how that brother branham himself would actually make these statements here and he makes this statement here in the message look I'm closing I'm closing but I want you to see this in a practical manner I didn't want you just to look at this tonight has just prophetic off here in the prophetic but I want you to see this in a prophetic in an actual practical manner how many of you ever got down before and I've been down and if I'd been discouraged in the message look 1963 brother branham here is speaking regarding brother out walls church my brother branham has made some mighty fine remarks regarding brother out Church one of the remarks that brother a brother brother branham made is out of the message and inside after their handing out prayer cards and when they're handing out the prayer cards their brother branham is wanting the song to be sung and then he says you know what hold on a moment he said why don't we have that choir come back up here and sing that song or have the choir come back he said I'd like the choir to come and you know let them sing whatever God has put on their heart while the prayer cards are being passed out now they begin to sing a song and as they sing that song they sing it through prayer cards then are still being given out but the choir director stands in that time and says I'll tell you what he says when he said you know we need to sing the song that we sung the other night that the Holy Ghost came in on and they began to sing the song I was there when the Spirit came now you can listen to it it's 1962 January 19th and inside and Buddy they're having a time the Spirit of God begins to fall in there and let me tell you something they're clapping their hands they're shouting I believe that director got loosed as well and brother Branham says right after they get done he said wow how we think the Lord for a nice spiritual lift like that now that's in 1962 and he said there's one outstanding thing about this church - brother outlaw one of them is they sure are singers now in the message look almost a year and a half later brother Graham says you know he said the first time I was in Phoenix where brother outlaw he said I had a record that was made during that meeting the record y'all know we won't go there when I kind of get feeling a little down I go play this record but Graham you don't put on one of your tapes brother Graham you don't go read the Bible there's times for that do you realize what brother venom is telling us here he's not trying to put on arrogance and pride I don't ever get down he's telling us I get down and he's learned as a lawyer how to conquer that sometimes you could try to listen to a message to you're blue in the face but that ain't what you need right then you might need to listen to some music when I kind of get the feeling a little doubt I go play this record and it's about scratched out the Carl's brother Ray you all hear you brother tell me if it's scratched out that would have to mean that he's playing it an awful lot that would have to mean he's getting down at different times but he's got a playlist perhaps maybe the man made it is here this morning little red flexible record he said of course I have many of the late records of this young choir here which has little babies then singing so program one against choirs see it's how to balance that word Billy rhymes against formality formality hey men we don't need nothing worked up when we've got the Holy Ghost all brother BAM says which was little babies then now they're singing we get sweet yet much out of it when we heard these fine songs I said to brother outlaw I'm glad they're being taped because I like to study that steady those songs yeah sometimes the Holy Spirit will make us to study a song like he would take Israel to study this song again I'm glad they're being hate tape because I like to study it I like to hear those songs and play the tape hear the songs when you can sit down there's nothing like music you know God heals by music did you know that he said God heals by news you realize that if you're down and you find yourself getting down at times you know what you need to do brother Brandon would tell him right in the prayer line he said you need to get yourself some good gospel music you need to get something in it that's singing there then there is actual ministry going forth that'll take your heart and your mind and put it on the Lord Jesus Christ upon His redemptive work and let your heart study those songs let it think upon those songs oh he said God heals by love God heals by medicine God heals by prayer God has many ways of healing it depends on what type you need he talks about a little love stretched out will cure an old sword an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal it right over just a little love a little care he said sometimes when you feel all down and as we call it a street expression down in the dumps just put on one of those tapes that music or record and go to playing it the first thing you know you are patting your foot or your hand and it's all over then you're right up and ready to go again this song then Moses has come under inspiration it came from the cloud and it would be kept in the cloud it would be pulled down from the great I am NOT the iCloud it would be pulled down and streamed when it was needed to be streamed it was theirs they were locked in this was their song it was part of their playlist you see that's the same way the Holy Spirit that's the same way that he works in the redemptive work is to place these songs before you and I do you realize that one of the favorite songs that was sung in bazooka has come was written long before Azusa Street but they could identify it in that hour the comforter has gone they were identifying the baptism of the Holy Ghost is present another song they would sing that would be a favorite of theirs to sing under the blood very beautiful song very soft and melodious song under the blood they would sing that song and Yeti it was written long before Azusa Street what was it they were singing it with more understanding they didn't need to take away that song they were singing it with the greater understanding you see that's the same way when you and I sing amazing grace His grace has brought me safe thus far when we sing that verse I can't help but think about its things in hell even presently how His grace has brought me safe this far it's not just words that were singing it's a part of our lives you see even here tonight that's the same way that God wants to be in your life if you don't know him as your Lord and said you don't know him in the baptism of the Holy Ghost in that real reality of the new birth I'll to eat or not just keep walking keep walking and keep opening your heart and allow God to finish the work in your life because let me tell you something he puts a song there on the inside of your life that it's a song of redemption that there's nothing can take it out of your life it's a part of you and you are a part of it and when that has come in you are a part of a great playlist there's a playlist that you can reach all the way back down through and you're identified Jesus I'll never forget what you're done for me you can reach back hold to God's unchanging hand you see each one of these songs were written with experiences in their lives and your song in your life is by an experience the song in my life is by an experience you know how we need these songs when we come in two times in our life all of a sudden when you don't know what you're gonna do how am I gonna make this payment Jehovah Jireh my provider he's encompassing me he was songs of deliverance they men that statutes are sounds in my pilgrimage these are songs that he has given me sounds that he has given you Oh glory be to God don't you love him have no fear he knows exactly where you're at he knows what what you're going through but remember take this into your heart that there are some times you and I we need a song we needed a song spiritually in this hour and there's times that we need a song in our life and God knows how to give us a song you know how it is just stand with me if you would I'm almost stop preaching you know how it is sometimes there's a song there's been songs sometimes that old my you know I've sung my wife will tell you she says you know she said I heard you get a song she said you just keep going on that song you know let the church say Amen that's where I'm at you see what I'm saying unless he doesn't do that you know that put me down or whatever more but you see then sometimes it can go for a period of time and then all of a sudden it'll strike in my heart he thought I was worth saving oh my you see it depends on where I'm at in that time then I might be up against you know the Red Sea and then I say Oh Lord he's a winged maker he makes a way where there ain't no way even when I don't see or don't feel you're working you're working you're with me and then sometimes it'll drop back in our life Jesus I'll never forget what you've done for me Jesus I'll never forget how you send me free you see it drops in our lives hey I'm not beside myself I am in one way and I'm not in another this is exactly when I read and I look at the message I see brother Branham enjoying his salvation I see him rejoicing I see him singing songs I see even where God would teach him further worship don't you love the Lord let's pray or Jesus whole father how we thank you Lord like Israel you bring us Lord and have brought us through experiences that the songs of our life are born out of experience smart that has meaning to us the words it's something about it Lord God you can take a person who can sing a song like the song we sing when I came up here in Christ alone but you let Lord one sing this same song born of the Spirit of God Locke was being sung here tonight Lord brother bill leading the congregation my brothers and sisters singing that song oh my the place where they're singing it from oh its greater understanding greater understanding Lord we certainly don't belittle Lord the one who wrote it because we know it was the inspiration of the Holy Ghost we have a filter of the word to pass it through and we can tell that Lord God it was wrote we see it father it has such meaning to our lives but it just goes to show when the Holy Spirit upon the life will take ahold of that song and begin to sing it oh my they can sing it by experience it'll be a deeper understanding a deeper experience I think of how many times Lord songs that we sing like he looked beyond my fault many songs that was wrote by dotty Rambo Lord God hailed it she would give Lord testimony I've marveled many times just listening to the testimonies that what was the story behind the song it was a song that was born out of experience this is what it was when Moses and them crossed the Red Sea Moses was not saying hey hey let's let's write a song no no it was inspiration that was dropping he was not having to form words that they would rhyme this was a soul we're Lord as your prophet would call it a songwriter this one who's able to raise up out of this realm he said they go up in a higher realm he said and the troubles they have sometimes the reason they're regarded as neurotics is because they get caught in that in between they're coming down and they can't get all the way back down into earth and they get in that time he said and that's why some of them have wanted to take their life and have tried to do so he said they get so caught up and that inspiration and what your prophet could relate to him he could relate to that being caught up in that inspiration like that Lord I think of it of great men William Cowper who would write there is a fountain filled with blood his life Lord when I read the history of William Cowper and brother Randall would make the statement that he was regarded as a neurotic when I read the history of that man along history and I read it Lord just felt moved but the enemy to love that song no wonder he was regarded as a neurotic there was so much within his life as he would try to take his life countless times he would spend most of his life after disappointments in such despondency but what inspiration he received from the holy ghost there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins when sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains ever since by faith I saw a stream Lord Jesus right here tonight in our lives there are songs that are sung by experience or God throughout this congregation their special singers here some that actually sing special songs right here on the platform yielded receiving inspiration and leading from you but father they're not the only special singers each and every one of your believing children are special singers there's a song there's a melody Lord that you've put in our heart Lord odd of redeeming Grace day after day moment after moment that song is being sung out it's a song that we have learned like it would say in the Book of Revelations it's a song but only they could learn father you have divinely instructed in Tallis I pray father maybe we take these things and as you have brought him in such a practical way may we Lord I pray as brother branham would speak in the message paradox and he would tell us like this he said you know Billy keeps that gospel music going in our office all through the day he said it helps him I know it does he says it helps us and then he goes on to tell us in that same paragraph he said you know musics got power in it music is what went before the army of the Lord I believe Lord God I'm speaking to your people tonight that by the grace of God we know there's times we need to listen we need to put on that playlist [Music] sometimes the Lord I remember I've come out of work sometimes yet out of counseling sometimes the Lord away from situations even though I'm ready to resume and listen to a message but I realize I need to get myself right and so Lord God I how I find myself I put on a song maybe I'll start singing maybe its instrumental maybe it's a playlist I just begin to let my spirit get right again oh Jesus how we love you Lord God how we think your Lord that you have encompassed our life with songs of deliverance Thank You Lord God for bringing us songs in the night thank you Lord God for giving to us Psalms that with you they speak to us words that when our hearts just seem like we we can't express it but yet the melody the words within that song that's it that's it that's what's there in my heart that's how I'm feeling and Lord we can look to you father or Jesus I pray I don't know the needs that are here tonight but you do and I pray that God that you would grant to them the song that they have need of may it encourage them Lord in their walk with you father's we go our separate ways or I pray that you'll be with your people tonight go with us Lord as we depart from Lord one another's presence but never from your presence we ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how done let's just sing this through and then will that should be dismissed in the name of the Lord your loving tonight in the morning when I [Music] Oh in the morning give me cheese got ahead
