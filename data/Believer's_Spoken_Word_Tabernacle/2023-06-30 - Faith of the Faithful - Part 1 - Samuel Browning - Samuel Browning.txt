blessed be the name of the Lord amen he's so great amen he's so great and he he still does Miracles so great amen I'm looking across a group of Miracles amen and it's just as much a miracle Saving Grace for one who is out in the world and everything that can be upon their life it's just as much miracle-saving grace for one who said in the church view all of their life and finally meets God because the miracle is the new birth and that's a miracle within itself to know that we have passed from Death unto life amen we have become Miracles amen amen may God bless you I will let you have your seat just for a minute here before I read the scripture and I won't keep you that long but uh I just want to say thank you you the prayers uh for the meetings that were there not only the travel um because even with the travel going there and coming those are things that really I dreaded I don't like I don't like travel I especially don't like long travel even traveling in the states eight hours sometimes by car anymore causes me to hesitate I'm just now you might say you're weak that's fine you can think that but I just I don't like weariness and tiredness and so sometimes those are things that uh you know I'm not spiritualizing at any all I'm just saying it's my flesh that I don't want to do that and then there's times then I hear Brother branham's hay on his old model T4 and he said I only got he said maybe 30 miles and that's 15 miles one way and 15 miles the other way so I said God forgive me but it still doesn't take that away and uh you know and and you're just um I always tease my wife I said you know I'm back in the cattle car section I'm loaded on with the rest of the cattle in the plane and you know and said here we are getting in I said we're you know getting the cattle ready for the slaughter uh you really you know those seats certainly don't get any more comfortable and they don't get any cheaper they become more High more they become higher and so just like when I was talking and brother Ronnie and brother Nathan were communicating to me beforehand and I said I said I'm just praying that I'll get a bump to first class because there's no way I'm paying that kind of money to do that uh going overseas those you look at it you know that's that's quite a bit of money you can put a portion of a car you could pay for with that kind of money so you know I just I thank God for his grace but the prayers that Not only was there because it just I was able to sleep on the flights going there and coming because I had to go into when I entered it was a brand new day for them and so it was a 24-hour flight day for me and then even coming back home when we got home last night but the the meetings and the services I you know I would like to perhaps in one of these moments to just share a few of the pictures and things with you not now but because I just have to kind of preserve my energy here but I want to say that your your prayers they were effectual I know you were praying and others were praying as well in in other assemblies and brothers and pastors and other places too but you weren't there to see it but I want you to know it was effectual many the lives of young people were changed I'm just we're just getting reports coming in lives and I know just from right there where those that were had you know came under bondage spirits and there's no you know restriction there in Australia it's Satan owns all the kingdoms of the world he has him under his possession right now but but they are they're coming under the the complete rulership amen of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Sons and Daughters of God and the Millennium but uh in the meantime you know just so many wonderful deliverances that God brought salvation and the the Holy Ghost to lives and I stood there and we I ministered with uh brother uh Freddie from New Zealand he's actually a South African transplant in New Zealand but brother Freddy has a testimony 85 years old and I he certainly doesn't look like 85 he doesn't preach like 85 he my goodness I mean he but it's just such a such wisdom and how God used it and uh you know brother Daniel took a moment in a service after brother Danny uh brother Freddie had preached the second service and brother Daniel said it like this he said I just want to take this opportunity to put my foot on a devil that would like to raise up and say that the young people only need young Ministries to speak to them because young people understand young people and he says he and it was very true he said I don't know if I want a man trying to understand me and figure me out and we understand God uses young men is that right but what what is being said is is that it's just something that we're not looking at things coming from an approach of youthfulness of mind but we want the mind of Christ because he's the one who knows us he's the one who knows how to operate and so you know it it really doesn't matter the age it just how God spoke so so personally and so your prayers I wish I had I know their videos and things online I didn't um I wasn't aware that all of that was going to be posted or the streaming or else I could have provided the link for those of you that wanted to look at that the links are out there so if you want that to go back into some of the services we'd be certainly happy to give those to you it's not anything that's hidden so it's there but I just want to say your prayers thank you for your prayers while we were there and for the entirety of the meetings because though you didn't see it but I can tell you it was effectual and I know it was the strength of the Lord that guided us through every every service and even the direction of the thoughts and how things could be changed in a moment's time and and then just to see the outcome and then you see the reports coming in and different ones and the Investments that were made on their part to be there and one of the parents wrote and said it's the best investment I ever made in my child because it did it cost a little bit to go there and so we just we just want to say thank you and God bless you I I know I probably could have said that shorter but I want to also talk to you a little bit too and and just to say I love you it's good to be back home and just pray you'll just continue to pray for me if God will help me to continue to get my legs and my strength underneath me and not only for the service here but Sunday and then Services there at byc in the upcoming week so just just so thankful to God for his Mercy aren't we amen God still moves amen he moves in a wonderful way and so um but uh yeah with brother Freddy and then his wife sister Doreen just tremendous people I to me as I told the people there I said now I found there's another oak tree to set underneath of and uh you know I don't make no bones about that when I you find that it's it's you know it's somebody who feels like they have something to impart to you those are the people I don't want to set under are you hearing me I'm not interested in that because that's not that's not God I don't understand our makeups are all unique and different but that's that's not that's not anything that's going to help us but when you have us when you have something that where someone has been through something and here they're standing at 85 years old and they're not standing there with a instructioning thing but you're just their life just speaks of it you know and it's just it's just something you just want to zip and just watch and learn and take in and absorb and and uh so I just so appreciated that with with brother Freddie and uh so I was hearing the South African accent over there pasta and yeah so it was just uh it was just wonderful amen our our brother and so keep them in prayer and um let's just be praying here as we turn to the word of the Lord if you'd like to stand Amen on your feet God bless you musicians thank you amen I want to look here in the scriptures at Job 23 and verse 8 I want to read a few verses of scripture that we read from here um where we've been in this chapter of 23. and I want to say I think I've mentioned this to you I I certainly did not start into this journey back in the fall of last year uh of my own accord and I certainly did not start into this of thinking that we would go through the Book of Job like this but my this has just been wonderful things that what you see within the Book of Job that's laid out all the way through the chapters if you can you see that and I trust God continuing to give us glimpses of that you see the whole Bible here in the Book of Job you also you see from before the foundation of the world you see Calvary and then you see an end time Revelation you see a fool working and how God works through it all and so it's just it's one of those things that even as I just waited on the Lord and sometimes I feel like I'm gonna go here or maybe to move to this chapter and there's a lot of things as you continue to study that inspiration comes but there's times where everything comes together and a lot of things you've been uh studying sometimes over years and things just kind of converge on you and those are wonderful moments and that's what I want to just look at here beginning this this evening and we want to start with verse 8 and maybe before we read could we just have a quick word of prayer and just ask the Lord just to just speak to us tonight Heavenly Father Lord we just want to say thank you for your grace Lord thank you for your mercy Lord once again Lord as we would stand here in this moment together Lord speaker hearer we lord have a desire to hear from you Lord and to see you Lord may you come Lord and help us together to step aside Lord not only as I would yield Lord of of my body my spirit my mind all of my being to you but God that we would also yield ourselves to you apart from all of the cares of life and all the burdens Lord that would be upon us may we lord yield ourselves to you in this moment and oh God that you'll come and take control we pray for your glory we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen job 23 verse 8. job said behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him that's very key I cannot perceive him it doesn't mean that he's not there but he's there I can't perceive him but he's here on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take how does he know the way you take job because it is his way it's the harder way and I have made that choice God has revealed his way and I have yielded to God's way he knows the way I take amen when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to begin here tonight we were dealing with um faith and that of on the last time that we were together and looking at this in a channel staying at a place that that channel where Faith itself can drop in our lives because the whole work or whole walk of our life as a Believer is a walk of faith and faith is not is not hope remember brother Branham would bring that together for us to understand that hope is Faith's worst enemy and faith in order to really have hope in the right position Paul would lay that out by the scripture and say it's uh that the greatest and oh how all of these are is that of Faith love and charity that it's it's love that unites it's love that brings the order to all of those things in other words so that we would have an expectation that is based in faith in God and when I looking at this and and looking at it I just want to just step into it for a few moments tonight and really dealing with that thought when we look at Faith and we Faith itself can if I can say it in this way can be such a mystery it can seem like such a great a great a great big thing and it is a great big thing but yet it's a very simple thing and Faith itself is what God has has ordained that we would know him by remember he gave us the five senses in this Natural Body to contact our Earthly home but God gave us one sense that where we can contact our Heavenly home and that's faith and man when man failed man walked away from that man forfeited that contact and that channel that that openness to where that God was able to come down and speak to him at any time did God come down when he failed he did but you see When sin entered in it caused man to withdraw from God so then what happened is the channel became clogged the channel became blocked up because God only expects you and I and what he requires and has designed you and I to be a channel just like a garden hose that we hook up out here the garden hose doesn't is not the water but the guard the garden hose is only a chance channel that the water can flow through and that's the same way it comes down into our lives it's not us that's why brother Brahm says you know when they would say bring the Divine healer out here and brother Brahm said well he says to Dr best he said I'm no more a Divine healer than you would be a divine Savior he is recognizing that we are put here as channels of God many times we want to see things take place I want to see this one healed or I want to see God move in this area of my life but none of us can speed that along we can't speed that up but there's things that we can do to ensure that our lives are in position that faith can drop at that moment there's many times that we'll take a promise of God by his stripes we are healed and we should we should take that whether we feel anything or not whether it has even been revealed to us in that moment that at that moment that that by his stripes I'm Healed it's still a promise of God and God has been revealed to us and because God has been revealed to us then every promise in him is yea and amen and that's where faith will take its stand upon the word of God and wait for the Revelation for this need this situation to drop and Faith itself when in order for that that in it in itself and moving it works to clear all things that could be that of a hindrance I want to deal with the thoughts here and there's no way that we'll get to where uh we perhaps will will get to uh in in other times but I want to deal with faith and faithfulness and we hear many times we read and I've referred this to you at many times it's been kind of like something that just bubbles over and that is when you read in the scriptures where it'll say thy faith has saved thee thy faith your faith and yet we also recognize that we see God's faith and God's faith is God's own life but yet God has entrusted us with faith but that faith that we have even as God deals with our life must come under the anointing of God's faith in other words we must be born again then when we're born again then it is no longer our faith acting alone but it is God's faith moving us according to his word and so this is where then as we would go and we talk about faithfulness being faithful and faithful and tough times faithful in the good times faithful so there must be an origin for faithfulness to arise from and so I want to just begin here tonight to deal with that thought on faith a faith of the faithful because there's no greater consideration that we could have than for God to be able to look upon us and say that well done thou my good and faithful servant because remember that's who's coming with him who's going in a Rapture who will be at the wedding supper who will come back in the return of the Millennium it's designated that with him came the armies of Heaven The Chosen and faithful so faithful is a quality that is a quality of the redeemed of the elect of the chosen faithful in all things so when we consider that for a moment uh knowing that that job himself he had job had a revelation of God and job with that Revelation he waited on God even when he did not know what was taking place in this in these chapters here as I told you before I don't know right now the longevity of time that all of this unfolded but what I do know that throughout this longevity in this period of time job was anchored by the revelation of God in his life even when job's thoughts about what were happening were thoughts that weren't uh in the right place as though God was against him but he could not move him off of that Revelation that I know God I've met God and I'm walking in God's provided way because he wasn't something job had been talked into it was one that job had met you see it we're talked into something we can be talked out of it if you're persuaded into something you can be persuaded out of it that's why Revelation is not a mental exercise it's not knowing of the knowing everything all I know this scripture I know this scripture but it's about have you met God personally do you know him in the power of his resurrection and this is a faith that job had and brother Branham would say it in this way that job he waited if you display that first quote there he says job waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip on God a revelation I I just have to go with this for a moment job waited for his faith notice whose Faith was it job's Faith but house was job's Faith brought to a place to where it had a grip on God because it was a divine revelation job was not holding like Moses held for a period of time my mama taught me this and they taught me this and then when things didn't go the way it should Moses ran right that was Moses faith but when Moses got before the burning bush then God came down and as the prophet put it in his words God Anointed The Faith he already had in him so faith is not something that all I've received this Faith or didn't know the faith is there but God comes to anoint what he's already put in you why you're a tabernacle of God God arranges all things that he can anoint the most holy God comes to anoint that place that he has reserved for himself oh blessed be the name of the Lord so that grip that we have noticed that grip on God because if it's just I grip alone remember brother Graham said oh he said I turned loose long ago but he has a hold of me how does he have a hold of us by Revelation that I've met God I know God I'm walking in step with God and there's a revelation that it's not our human strength because our human strength let's go but there's something that's greater than our Humanity something keeps holding me so then when we find brother Brandon I want you to see this because there's a walking with A continuous brother Brian we'll talk about Revelation as a continuous life-giving Source this revelation of Jesus Christ it's a continuous life-giving revelation oh that's why it's not a stagnant cistern it's this is the Fountain of Living Waters this is the fountain that's been opened in the House of David it's a it's a fountain that not only cleanses us but there's an ongoing cleansing an ongoing washing of Water by the word in our life and there are needs that continue to come in our life and there are things that you and I see in our life that are brought to light by God that we need that life-giving source to give us strength not only to identify but then to overcome it is that right so that's why we continue to walk on with God how many say Lord I want my faith increased I want my faith increased because Paul spoke about all the way through the book of Thessalonians when he would say that your faith would abound is it possible for a believer's faith to grow sure it is the prophet would even stand there after this message and preach on the wings of a snow white dove and he would speak about the visitation there of the of the seven angels and the Revelation that has come in this hour and brother Brandon would say that has led me to a faith I never had before notice led me to a faith I never had before it wasn't that brother random one born again but you see now that opens a channel once we are born again now we're in contact with God there's a grip on God a channel is open that now for everything that we face in this life God himself is the answer for every situation and through not just situations but through our life it's leading us into a faith that we never had before that's why we should be able to say this day this day I have a faith like I've never had before it's not about our feelings there's times earlier in our life in her Christian walk you felt more in control of things but you see God's God's not wanting you to stay in in the part where you feel or I feel more in control of things he's wanting to get us out here into a place to where it's not us our security is in I've got control over this situation God wants to bring us into deeper waters deeper waters to where it's not I that liveth it's not I that's in control and I know we and I say we we pray that way we say that but to understand that that's really where God is taking us to that's why the word keeps coming that's why the spirit of God moving Upon Our Hearts and drawing us what could take us deeper in him so when you can get that kind of nice talking to the sick people and I think that's important he says the sick people that's in the building the crippled or you have a need of God when you can get that type of a revelation that you are Justified when you're actually justified in asking the thing that you're asking for and believe it that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him there's nothing can ever separate you from that Faith that's anchored to you but first it has to be revealed to you so a need has arose needs arise but we must be able to have such a Clarity between us and God now God it's never anything on God's part we can never say Lord you're doing this and Lord you went and done this and Lord you've done this and you've messed up the channel between us we can never say that but where Satan likes to come in he likes to try to break down that channel so that we're not able to stand justified in his presence now listen now I'm not talking about the justification that comes by faith and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and where the spirit of God puts us in that position I'm talking about remaining in that kind of a position where there's nothing between you and God it'd be like if you had an argument with your wife there is something that's going to bother you until you make that right you can operate as a Channel of husband and wife like you ought to is that right so that's why you come to be able to stand or sit at your dinner table and eat your steak in a Justified state I know that's very very simple but this is the Simplicity of it that see that's the whole thing that's why the prophet could tell us over and over it is within you to overcome you do have power to overcome you have been anointed for this but what it is there's nothing wrong with the seed in you the seed in you does not need genetically modified it is the word of God as a son and daughter of God the only thing is needed is for you and I to get out of the way and stay out of the way that's a great battle I said that's the great battle you had no battles before God changed your life but once God comes into your life every gun I'm quoting the prophet every gun out of hell is trained on you everything anywhere he can lay snares trapped why are traps for to try to trip you up so you're not able to stand in that channel foreign let's just take the cover off the enemy it just takes it off [Applause] watch so it's getting in that that place and that channel for Sovereign for Faith because we need we need faith I want you to understand this we need faith for many situations there's times in my family for my own body and for my family where faith is dropped and directed me right there at that moment and it was miraculous then faith has also dropped same quality from the same God to go through a surgery to take the medicine but see even though some of us never set in denominational churches it shows you the reason denominational thinking and it's not just denominational thinking it's thinking of elevating self we want to act or think is dual if I had to take medicine if I had to do this this is a weakness of faith it is not a weakness of faith it takes faith in order to take that that's why the prophet could stand right in Erie Pennsylvania believe us now this and tell us that God performs Miracles through surgeries God performs Miracles through medicine is that right over and over we hear the prophet say this but somehow it somehow we allow the enemy somehow our and we allow that of self to get us into a place that in order to this to happen it's going to be faith and I'm just going to stand down claim it well there's a part of that that when we take the promise of God by his stripes I'm Healed I agree with that but if God has not revealed to me that this is gonna that it's a miracle in that part and God's not dropped that sign me up for the surgery I'm not a weakling I'm not a compromiser it's just knowing Who We Are I can show you many examples in the message where brother random even spoke Blasphemous names in the opening part of that message he's referring back to stature of a perfect man and he calls out a sister in the church sister Steffy he says If thy hat and prayed for you you wouldn't have made it through that surgery now quickness same God that brought her through the surgery have also intervened to where she didn't have to go through it he knows the way I take and the way that we want to take is not our own way it's God's way because every way that he leads will never lead us away from him it's leading us closer to him amen sometimes the paths and and everything but God knows what he's doing oh blessed be his name so here in this channel so I'm saying it in a manner that her brother it continues to bring this to put us into a channel where Faith itself is able to move down and to operate and he would say it like this uh in the high of her but now I see this is just another place in that message and brother REM said we don't use the gift of God for commercial now what brother Brown's referring to there is he had some brethren that we're talking about uh they wanted to go and they knew there were oil in Kentucky and brother Brahm let him know yes there is oil then they asked brother Branham tell us where it's at brother Brahm said oh no not going to do that he knew God had showed him it was there but they asked him tell us where it's at and see what Brother Brad I'm allowed he goes into this in this message one starts to come out among those ministers as they as they were getting this plot and this plot and you know we're going to do this to evangelize we're going to do that finally you realize the contentiousness that contentiousness come from it was there the whole time because the request was based on that are you hearing me that's why when someone could say I've been praying and God didn't heal me and I'm no longer going to serve him the basis that did not come overnight the basis of where you were living is what led you to that we're talking about the basis get down to the basis what's the reason right we don't use the gift of God for commercial no no he could tell me where it was at but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him if I have if I had need of it I believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me well brother Sammy I believe I'm going to ask God for a motorcycle I don't know who I you'd want one anyhow some people just trying to be kids again just ride your bicycle be happy I don't know where that come from it's free but you see sometimes to do well I'm just going to speak it for what reason whose glory is that for that's For Your Glory for your enjoyment and for you to have something you can point at I spoke that and it came into existence God will share his glory with no flesh even if it's the flesh that's housing a son and daughter of God God will share his glory with no flesh Our Father does not spoil us he leads us Glory mama 's packed in here if I need of it I believe I'd ask him he'd tell me if I had what need of it what what what is the ministry of the word the third pool what is it based on need Abraham had need of the realm is that right brother Branham had need of the squirrels ask what you have need of that's why the ministry of the opening of the word is not an educating of our mind god Jehovah Jireh has provided what we have need of it's him revealing himself among his children through his children in his children we have need and God has taken our lives where people could say no son and daughter could come out of there no squirrel could come out of that kind of stuff but God spoke by his word because why inside of that mess inside of that condition was the son and daughter of God and someone could say no squirrel could come out of there you remember what I'm talking about right when brother Graham stood in the woods he said I'm going to make it ridiculous I'll speak out of this right here because there's no way squirrels don't come out of there that took somebody to know of characteristics of a squirrel and let me tell you something God knows the characteristic of his sons and daughters all he needed was a yielded vessel in this hour to say Let There Be Sons and Daughters of God come forth responded to his voice brother Brandon said at first see your motives and objective has to be right this is the this is the basis for all things your motives and objectives has to be right it's just like the asking God lord I really want you to bless me with this job be careful what you ask God for because if you're asking God I have prayed for people I've prayed for individuals that have asked me to pray that God would provide a way they could be in the house of God that will come back to condemn you if you don't honor what God and what you said I'm doing this I want this job I want this and God turns around and is provided listen to me you see what that is not the faith of the individual that is the faith of God in operation just like brother Branham talked about that people that can have things taken off of their lives healing into the presence of the Angel and then it comes back in their life a few days later and he said the reason of that is because a lack of sincerity but yet in the prince of God it lifts it but then it'll come back why because down at the bottom it's not right when it's not right it will return why there's no strength to withstand it my my Lord's good indie oh my this is this is this is real victory see first of our motives and objectives has to be right you have to have reasons for this but I think we need to take this in an encouraging way because if you've got the right motives and objectives and if it's not say God let my motives and objectives match yours Lord transformation he says and then he talks to the brother Willard Collins about the will of God he says once I find it's God's will for me to for something to be done then he said I want to test my motives my objectives in it home you know you know what you know what I believe that is that's Sons and Daughters of God sometimes we're looking at Sons and Daughters God speak to this mountain no Sons and Daughters of God is being able to look down and see our own humanity and say you're not going to rule over me huh you're not doing this for your own Glory this is for the glory of God that's what Sons and Daughters of God is that's what the adoption is is being able to crawl our own selves to the word you're talking about speaking to a mountain there's something greater than a mountain and that's that mountain of that first birth that would still be there that has to rise up and say thou great Mountain who do you think you are before cerebral who's ceruvable one who has been touched by fire Thou shalt become a plane oh glory be to God you gotta have reasons to do this God don't just give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God and if you want to be well what do you want to be well for all right well I want to be a better I want to be a better grandpa that I can run with my grandchildren that's good that's wonderful that's wonderful that's what I'm trusting I want to be able to run and play and wrestle and everything I think yes Lord I want to be well I want I want to be if God tarries and others I want to be able to stand be a or be a channel that God can use I you know there's risks there's reasons for healing but if my but if the purpose for Desiring healing is just so Lord you know I'm just not able to work like I used to Lord the kind of hours I used to work I just need healing in my body for what what purpose and glory is that for God that's not about God you see this is why the word comes to discern what's brother Sammy what's this all about being a Channel of faith that God can move down through our lives in needs God can influence through our lives God can direct through our lives it's not just needing God in the tough times God's not a welfare system what's falling on a hard time you need to fall on the rock and let the rock become your rock amen following that rock and say God I lay everything down lay my life down not just when it gets tough well I need somebody bigger you need somebody bigger when you feel good you need somebody bigger in all of your life you need God personally every day even when you feel like you're in control on top of the mountain that's when you're really near him that's when you really need him oh God mold that you say God so mold that in my heart in my life you can't ask it in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God so if you want to be well what do you want to be well for if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed he said see remember remember Simon the Sorcerer I put my glasses back on so I can see the targets you remember Simon the Sorcerer he asked for the Holy Ghost wonderful you say I wonder if somebody has overheard Simon the Sorcerer asking the disciples he said glory to God I tell you God's really dealing with brother Simon glory to God he's asking for the Holy Ghost and then become to realize what he's asking is he's asking to handle and use it in a selfish manner he didn't realize that the Holy Ghost is God's Life coming to you to lead you into the very depth of his life to transform you not to make you a better person and I hope you don't misunderstand me there's a lot of good books a lot of things self-help and things you can become a very good person God ain't interested in building on our first Foundation he's interested in building on his own Foundation God doesn't show up and say oh there's a basement here I think I'll build on it God said just try it I Lay My Own Foundation I build on my own foundation and what is that Foundation the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally what is God doing he's building upon his word building upon himself and he builds a son and daughter of God in his own image that's why when we come coming for the Holy Ghost have the set have the have the breeze in and the purpose then Lord I want you more than anything I want my life it's not just coming to church God I want to know you in the power of your Resurrection I need you Lord of Victory that's in me sustains me guides me that even when I feel down there's something in me to pick me up it's a pick-me-up it's something that'll strengthen me even in my times of of weakness and my times of struggle there is an anchor there is that reality on the inside that God that you have done it's the revelation of Jesus Christ Lord I want to serve you that's why the Holy Ghost comes is to bring us into that channel to where we can serve him not by our own means our own way but by his grace and this is why brother bran would say and then he says he said he's got to be the right motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God let me just say like this I would not be too big when I look at these see these these things when I'm speaking like this and preaching this it could if you allow the devil it could put you back in a cave to where you have to look at it as though I've got to act like everything's all right or I've got a scene and I'm not telling you to make up anything I'm trying to say it like this if you're not there if you haven't received the Holy Ghost if you have need of healing or anything else or whatever it might be job situation I would say God line my motives and objectives Lord to where it matches your will because your will is what I want and I know I can't get to her but Lord You're the same God who's bringing me into a place Lord of healing this and I need you Lord all the way because remember though a man can baptize you in water but it is God himself that baptizes you into the Holy Ghost it's God working on your life I wouldn't be too big I would never be too big I don't I mean just say it like this I don't ever want to get too big to where when there is a promise that is before me God reconcile everything in me to be in harmony with you Lord [Music] not walk around and act like we got it all put together no God don't want that God one God is the one one who desires to put all things together sometimes you know it's wonder that we don't get and we don't get Grammys and invited to the Grammys for the movies and stuff like that actors it's amazing you know because I think sometimes we're better actors than the actors come on you see a god coming and just what what is the spirit of God doing not condemning us but he's trying to see show us see that part right there is what hinders but just come and stand on the side of the word and listen to the word handle that part of you I've already taken care of the root in your life I've already dealt with that nature now just keep on coming over and standing on the side of the word I will dismantle all every weapon that has ever been formed against you all the way down through time where this has happened in your family tree this has happened and this has happened and that's happened for spirits to travel on down but here is the great chief Master Mechanic of Glory he knows how to make a Son of God run like a Son of God and a God or God run like a daughter of God so instead of touching this wire to this wire to this wire just lean on him he's the one who built he's the one who built your life he knows all the complexities and everything we're wrapped in and he knows how to lead us out to Victory that's when the faith that's when the faith is revealed to you so see the one going The Walking with God whether you're walking into the baptism of the Holy Ghost walking in and when I say that walking in sometimes and I just want to speak as he's giving it to me sometimes that's terminology but don't ever think that it's your efforts or it's my efforts the walking is actually not us going somewhere else it's actually the same lamb same word going deeper it comes in to our mind then what does it do go to the holy place then it goes into the holiest of holies is that right for that of the atonement they had to they had to slay that of the bullet right and they took the blood in so you see it's not you and I like oh I'm walking in no it's God coming in it's the blood coming deeper deeper deeper until the full experience so it's actually gone what's God doing God's approaching his own Mercy Seat it's God approaching his word it's God who makes that word to live and God is saying that's where I will meet with thee that's that little room that's that secret place that's where the third pool operates from that's the word that's the presence of God I will commune with thee from above the mercy seats thens when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over so let's say I'm walking into it for a promise let's use the promise of healing matter of fact let me back up let's say I'm using I'm taking the promise I realize as a son and daughter of God I've been robbed of my right Satan has robbed me I've got a right to the Holy Ghost it becomes so clear that it isn't anything I could Merit I can't make God like me I can't make God love me he's always loved me man and Calvary is only Russell as bringing a view that's what the mercies seek coming in view does it brings the reality of the love of God as Paul could write of it tried to in the Book of Romans under inspiration but how can you even conceal the love of God when he the righteous one when he died for the ungodly died for the unlovable you see there's nothing that you could do or I could do that justified us for him dying for us he didn't do it because we were where they [Applause] he did it because he loved us can't you see he didn't choose you because of the condition you were in but that's not his choosing his choosing is you were always one of his children and he came looking for you and he still comes down and looks for us and says hey has your job got between us hey has family got between us where are thou my son where I tell my daughter you aren't living in the proper Channel but God it's my husband's fault lord it's my wife's fault lord it's this body's fault he's telling you no no no it ain't nobody's fault I am come that you can walk and live in a Clear Channel because faith is to begin calling those things that are not as though they are you see when you're talking negative that's not faith you're prayed for and then you go back out and the same thing happened same thing comes up again and oh this come up again and so and so said this or they done this and and then you start down you see what's happening you know what's happening you're starting down a familiar pathway you've got to take a stand on God's word and stop letting the devil push you around when you prayed for it draw the line God's God has said this tell me when what time does God ever lied to you has he lied he's not a man that he should lie his words have been established from from here for the foundation of the world he sounds with the certainty so then it comes down to Lord what's the channel because sometimes it isn't even about this situation we're wanting to say well I get this situation I get this and God said this situation I'm permitting to show you and I'm trying to put both fingers both ways you know that you know what that you need to be more of a channel for me God knows why God knows how to lead us God knows how to bring us into these things what is this thought so I don't know who said this so I don't know who I'm quoting but when somebody said something they said if you the definition of insanity is to keep on doing the same thing the same old way and expecting different results that's insanity right doing it the same old way and it's almost like we're wanting God to equip us Lord make my will stronger no you don't want your will stronger that's the problem we need to not my will thine will not well Lord if you think if you think there's a few things in my will that are just not right that you couldn't use God said I don't want none of it I don't want none of it I don't need your help this situation is an opportunity for me to make myself known to you and to bring you in even in a latter point in your life to be more of a channel God's not the author of confusion it works with a purpose I didn't get anywhere where I was planning on tonight I thought I had just a little something here before me a little something that we get into some other God knows Tony but he's given us what he wanted and that's all I care about right you breach from that inspiration but notice when faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over so come back to that place the promise of the Holy Ghost David said this is why even at times even as we come out of as I've come out at times of Youth Camps you see things where lives have been touched and you know sometimes there's situations you don't know whether it's there here wherever and you don't know exactly you know sometimes there's things it's really it's really confirmed and witnessed in your heart and then there's other times when you you you know that there are other lies that no doubt have have not come to that place but God has touched them and so what do you do well I'm not fearful because if God has made himself so known to draw them into a place of repentance and then there are things that has gone out of their life then it's like David I have set the lord always before me so he has been sent before us he is at my right hand I shall not be diverted from the promise he's strengthening me he's the one who's encouraging me saying it's for you it's for you understand what I'm saying it's God placing that direction in our lives that's the same thing then as a life will take that promise and brother Sammy I could read your quotes I don't have them here but I know him but brother Bram talks about you begin to confess it the Holy Ghost belongs to me you confess it you begin to take a hold of the promise of God that right then it's the same thing with healing same thing with healing then as I'm waiting see just as much as a person is waiting for that Faith to drop in that place they're walking on with God God listen that faith is not going to drop what if somebody comes up here and is prayed for and you're prayed for and then after you're prayed for you're going back and you start talking well you might as well make plans for me to get my casket and you might as well call up if you you only got the sniffles you understand friends I'm not talking about not making preparations but if we come up here and then we walk on we've not set the Lord before us we're going based on our emotions and you sense his presence and there is a response in his presence but remember his presence is here making himself known that the word might move into its rightful place because without the atmosphere the word's not going to move because the atmosphere the words what brings the atmosphere and the atmosphere is what brings life right it's not the hymn that Hatches the a gets the atmosphere that's why the preaching of the word it brings the atmosphere it brings the tent of the Lord his presence down that he can come and deal in the little room Hallelujah it brings an atmosphere it brings the presence of the Lord that's why I believe we believe in an atmosphere a real Supernatural atmosphere and I believe in a real atmosphere the brown said the supernatural I don't know we can take these in ruin their own but brother Bram talks about a real atmosphere he said you get the people in the court one Accord in their mind in their heart get the organ in the right cord he said then you're gonna have the atmosphere right that's not to knock on anybody on the organ but I'm just saying you get all of that together so you see brother random is not bless God you don't need a music that's the emotion who told you that sounds like some sounds like unbelief wanting to creep in it sounds like vultures that wants to come on the sacrifice but we shoo the vultures away don't tell me we don't need anointing don't tell me the Holy Ghost don't bring in motion I'm not saying that the Holy Ghost is in motion but don't tell me it's not and people can get happy at a ball game and then want to restrict the presence of God you need a trip back into the holiest of holies you need the joy of the Lord restore this word brings Power Glory and joy and it ought to bring a liberty among the people of God not a restriction of rules and regulations my goodness I didn't know that was packed in there but the message the supernatural powerful friends you see what's happening is men in their minds are trying to get in an engineer happenings God don't want man's reasoning in it it's God's church God knows how to run this church and he doesn't want quotes in hands to where it binds people but the anointing of the spirit of God it comes down to bring Liberation on the inside [Applause] Hallelujah I think I feel a little good but I know I gotta we'll just dial it back here let's just stop so I'm going to walk when I pray for the Bible said if any be any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church anointing or oil and confessing their sins if there be anything this is the promise God will forgive it but it's got to come through the right channels are you hearing me he's got to come through the right channels that's why many things sometimes things stay because we're not coming in the right way we got to check out their objectives and our motives friends and we need to understand this we need to be looking I want you looking for God when you take a stand upon God's word you expect God expecting waiting for that Faith to drop see when you're in the channel as you're in the channel you're awaiting that faith that grip you've got on God you're waiting it to be confirmed what grip that I know I've met him this situation I don't know I don't know how the situation is going to be resolved but I've committed it into God's hands how do you know you're committed to God's hands because I committed myself into God's hands and it's committed into God's hand I don't know how I'm going to make this come I don't know how but you know what there's a faith faith you know what does something takes hold in your life and it all of a sudden it isn't something that's dropped and may be completely revealed but this is something that it's just like as you're siding with the word and something just raises up and you say I can't explain it I don't know but it's something it's just it's just what is it it's a peace of God it's bubbling up because what is it you're standing in that right Channel and it's like you're looking you know it's you're looking for somebody to come you know it's not like oh my goodness so-and-so's at our house quick raise up the carpet put everything underneath it no it's looking and I'm expecting him I'm expecting that Faith to drop for this right here and then until that time I'm going to be faithful and I'm going to walk step by step of the way I'm not going to turn around and say God didn't give me the Holy Ghost so I'm just you know I must not be one of his you didn't get that from God you got that from the Devil yeah you need to be listening to God you need to be listening to God's voice you need to fill your heart and mind with the things of God come on friends I just got to go as he's bringing it here quit going to the same old means if things don't turn out your way and don't go your way then you go back to the same old things in your life you know why because that's been your source of comfort but God said he would provide the comforter not a comforter but the comforter sometimes even in our lives with having the comforter sometimes we can go and go in measures and means of how we you know when something isn't going just right and we go in our own means our own ways of things and you know what listen I'm not here to take that out of you and you're not here to take those things out of me but within me within you greater is he that's within us and God's working and leading us into that place and that is not something that happens in a One-Shot deal after you've been born again now God is leading you out as a son and daughter of God and he's leading you from Glory into Glory from Victory unto Victory and sure there'll be there are a few failures sure there'll be a few mistakes sure there's things but it's important that you recognize them and say God not just this but take me to the root of why this is that's Sons and Daughters of God that's taking Dominion standing here Lord I want to I I I I want to speak to the Earth yeah me too right here this is the piece of the piece of Earth I want to speak to this is the Peace of Earth right now I know there's a lot more beautiful pieces of earth I'm talking about in this Earth but I have been given this is a possession and this old guy right here is the one that wants to get in the way don't you love him faith faith of the faithful the channel a channel that's opened that we can walk faithful before him even when we're waiting we're waiting on God to come down and for that Faith to drop but stand there like job I know what he's revealed to me there's nothing that's against me I know where I'm standing with God made wrongs right I know where I'm standing and that's how you're able to stand right and yet someone said well how's this going to come out I don't know but God's in control yes I'm certain God's gone I'm ready I know him I don't know how this is going to turn out I don't know because if I look by my if I let my mind go into it it looks bleak if it because you know why only thing that Humanity can produce because I told the young people over there I said I asked those that were math students I said how many are math students because I'm sure not a you know I said you know what for math I said you know what the square root of failure is human ability you take human ability plus human ability equals failure multiplying you know multiplying and sometimes we in our lives even as listen friends even in our journey as Christians and Believers God's still bringing us because there's certain outcomes in our lives that we still see failure but Lord I've been serving you this many years but sometimes human ability multiplied by human ability it results in failure and so God says wait let's get that down to the root let's let's let's deal with the root not that you need to be born again again because that has no such thing as that but what God comes in what's he doing he's dealing and molding and shaping our character and you now why is it what has happened maybe back in my life that causes this approach I'm telling you that's where the word and the opening of the word comes down to unveil and uncover Satan that's why the prophet said that which passes through Oral Roberts he said and Billy Graham all the rest of me said it makes it through their prayer lines and things he said then he said he comes to me he said why because it deals with what's hindering it thank God for a word to remove all hindrances aren't you grateful for that oh it uncovers us I say God uncover Me Lord if there's things Lord take every room every channel every room of my life I don't want any rooms that has a sign on it knocked before entering right we want to turn them all over to him and as he starts dealing with another room in our life I want to say Lord I don't have any Keys here but this this cough drops a key I want to be able to hand it to him and say Here's the key Lord going into that room of my life that part that's hidden going into it Lord what is it it takes the Son and Daughter of God to stand there with a real courage and turn the keys into his hands for what faith why am I I said I was closing it's close stand in that place God placing God before us no matter what the promise is no matter what the need let God be centered before you let everything else in between Let It Be remedy that our lives can be a channel as God every motive and every objective Lord let every one of my motives and my objectives be right it's just like somebody could have a motive and objective well I you know and I'm not saying anybody does here but let me just use an example that I know would burn in our hearts Lord I want to see every one of my my children saved and filled with the Holy Ghost why why what's the reason to what's the motive behind it it's Lord so that they might know you in a personal reality and a victory in their own lives not for my glory not for our family's Glory but For Your Glory you see what I'm saying sometimes there's things that we we do and what we do and what we're doing it's all about ourselves it's about putting ourselves up front and that's why brother bran talked to Dr Sam Adair and brother bran brings it out in the adoption I think you could just you could preach this a Month of Sundays and he told Brothers he told Dr Sam Madera remember Dr Sam Adair a good good man believer he told Dr Sam Adair he says look he said Sam he said you know one of the problems is you got too much up front now when I read that I read my name in there Sam you know one of the problems you got too much up front hey don't you let the word examine your life that way is too much up front see God knows how God knows how see if it's just man on man it causes to pull back but that's why we need his presence because even in the midst of what had taken place the presence of God will bring conviction but conviction is only there to bring to reality the wrong and the hindrance that has come and it will lead us back into a place of Fellowship that's what the word comes to do the word doesn't come to look to put you or me or anybody or you're a bad bad person and this and that's not what the word comes to do the word is not a word that isolates you are you hearing me because even while the words being preached if you allow the enemy to interpret it in your mind you it you can allow him to isolate you what should you do you should stay in the stream of water and stay with the water because eventually the hounds of Hell lose your time lose your tracks stay with the water all of my thoughts I give them to God cast down everything that he would be the preeminent one in all things it's a beautiful thing Faith that's a beautiful thing to say God all you desire is for my life just to be a channel and he provides a way aren't you glad he provides a way he doesn't let you know it isn't God that's handed this to you and I sometimes I've had instruction manuals it's come and sometimes with things and I you know I know as men men are prone to this I say men because men are aren't prone to they get the instructions out there that boat looks longer here and this one looks longer there and this sometimes the instruction I've had instructions where there were things that when I started looking on it because it was written by man that there's things missing and it starts popping up you start reading reviews on things and you're like what do you go from here where do you go you know and you start looking at it and then find out somebody over in another country somewhere I don't have to say where they forgot to put it on there and they're coming to come to know it ain't just me saying oh they forgot that no no I looked it up because I thought is it me you keep reading it over reading over reading it over reading over sometimes it's the instructions you know God has given us such Clarity of instructions and we can have that that channel of faith not to be complex but it's this right here let us live our lives in such a way that he's able to come down at any time and speak to us whatever the need might be let us live in such a place that faith can drop because one of these moments one of these moments it's going to drop and our bodies are going to be changed that's why we want to be living in that channel that channel of faith you love him Hallelujah God bless you as your Sparrow heads in order to prayer Heavenly Father Lord You're so mindful of our needs Lord I don't I don't know Lord of all the needs that would be present the that which is even request that's on the hearts of your children I know my own Lord request on my heart and I know they have requests to I know there's needs that Lord are before us God needs of healing Lord in that of the Soul needs of healing in the spirit Lord some lives and hearts Lords some Lord the healing that's needed is there in the spirit from things that Lord back that's carried forward but I'm glad oh I'm so thankful that Lord you have arose the son of righteousness with healing in your wings that God you're not only here to bring healing in our soul but you're a God who moves to bring healing in our spirit Realm where we've been wounded Lord father even when you stood there failed in that of humanity oh god of that body of Flesh known as the son of God you would announce and Proclaim I am come to heal them that are bruised Lord Jesus you are faithful Lord God your faithful also in healing of our bodies Lord one thing's for sure the greatest healing that anyone needs is that healing of our soul and God that we might continue to walk as channels may we lord is looking to you God not allowing hindrances God the things that just as you bring to our attention I don't want Lord just to be my eyes alone I want it to be your eyes what you say I want it to be the things that you see in me the things that you see and say again we need to deal with that I want to move through those eyes Lord not my own eyes Lord we've lived long enough in those in those areas and now when the intelligence of the mind of Christ is moved down Among Us Lord anointed Lord to be able to see in this hour and God may we lord we're not looking outwardly but Lord we want the word looking inwardly God is Sons and Daughters of God help us Lord I pray that we might walk as channels the god that that sovereignty of faith can drop at any moment no matter what that need is we ask it Lord that those that are seeking for the Holy Ghost granted Lord may they set their hearts Lord hear those streaming and so forth may they set their hearts Lord in that place with you oh God under the leadership of your work is we can't make ourselves Worthy oh Lord I'm so glad that you have made that so real to us it's not us that we we can never make ourselves good enough you showed that when Lord Adam and Eve stepped out they had fig leaves on that wasn't good enough you provided the skins of an innocent one God you provided that we could stand in your presence you've provided Lord that God the way that we can be one with you may they set that before you may they let that strength strengthen them and I pray God the same when it comes to Healing comes Lord to overcoming or maybe a besetting sin it'd be a weight that's laying in a life Lord you're the same God may we just Lord just even in that moment just Lord placing in a place a Channel of Faith where all hindrances Lord are removed Lord sin is confessed it's under the blood and our hearts Lord are a channel that's available for you granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen all my don't you love him oh my I just so appreciate God comes and he just takes a hold of the word and he speaks to our hearts faith of the faithful what is it that brings about the faithfulness in our life because of him because of him not not I it's him and that's

verses it speaks of the harmony between a husband and wife and it brings that place to that and the wife and I'm talking bringing this into the spiritual place adorned with a meekness what does meekness give place just just give place to the word give place to the Holy Spirit and what is it within the heart the hidden man of the heart he's not just my savior he's the Lord of my life there
