mentioned in regards to many of you that would still like to contribute to that need that's there in the philippines whether or of l throughout you know we felt certain effects from this uh whole thing with the with the virus and so forth that has come around and as some of you know had it you know on your job the different things that's mentioned that you know for them there's things where they're just i think brother o'ell just told me they're just getting ready to have their first in-person service brother gomez is going like this but that didn't when you said something so trustee meeting real quick after church with the trustees and then those of you that want to continue to if you have something to continue to contribute um here this sunday there's a little box back there that all the thai's offering anything in the mission just noted in there and and then the brothers they get it out of there also next week um next sunday brother andrew glover is going to be here with us and what i'm i'm planning on doing is just having two services on sunday so i we're going to try we're going to try that and see how that you know that that will go for us and i don't want to say how to go for us but you know anytime you do something special you can expect god to move sometimes you watch how uh brother branham will will tell us you you listen to a message uh when brother branham the message is titled god comes an unusual times in unexpected ways sometimes we get things so figured out and we have we can get to a place not even that we want to get into a form but sometimes we do and yet god will come and he'll just come in such a special way you know and he'll minister to our needs so i just asked that you would be in prayer for the service the reason i haven't even on the thursday nights i haven't when we've had somebody in even though i've known like brother andrew and brother wayne i you know knew that well in advance because i've not made it public even with these meetings i've not made it public so that just to open it up to everybody because i think and that's pretty much with every assembly right now you know it's we've only got so much space and to try to position people around and now some of you that's come and i know some of you have family that come and i want to understand don't you understand this some of you have a family or you have a friend or somebody that comes and visits you you're able to uh you know you you know uh well if they're coming with you or something you're able to see all of that i i just want us to be very cautionary and that's what i've tried to do i've tried to make sure we can still remain spaced apart with everything because i just tell you right now this virus is not a conspiracy i didn't get married many man but that ain't i'm not preaching right now it's not a conspiracy and i just tell you right now i don't like sinus infections sinus infections about knock me off my feet let alone the flu or let something else and you know and and i'm just you know so i think we need to take you know all every precaution and i want to just commend you once again as an assembly those of you when there's something come up you might say you know there's certain brothers right now that some some that you don't see here um that they're actually working in a coveted unit right now and so they don't come here during this time because they just would not want to risk anything of a transmission however you know i really appreciate that and appreciate each and every one and you know there'll come a time my man we won't even have to bring talk about this or commend this but i'd say this right here even after the virus i'll just say it as plain as i know if you got a snotty nose and a sore throat or whatever more don't come you're not proving anything just staying home and streaming right i don't we don't want sickness here you know within the church there's just things that i just say that and you forgive me if i'm not politically correct because but i ain't trying to be sometimes you have to say it's so simple but um we just want to try to do that and i and i so if if we could let's just just continue on with where we've been uh i mean love the lord amen so good to be in the house of god once again good to see different faces that are here and some that i haven't seen in a while and since angela i've seen you on thursday it's good to see you and braden and good to see each and every one let's just let's just look to the lord now in a word of prayer and let's just invite him to come we we need to hear from him we don't need to hear from samuel browning we need to hear from jesus he's the one that can help us heavenly father lord we've come here this morning with a desire that's to hear from you but lord you're such a gentleman i always think about lord how brother john lafontaine would put it over the years he said you're such a gentleman that you give us the first opportunity to come in here and to worship you and to make you feel welcome lord there's just no doubt about it when i was sitting back there and in these services lord oh god i just think lord many could just drive right by this building they could drive right by it to them it's just another building god this is a place you've given us to meet with you this is a place got a soul-saving station it's a lighthouse lord not because of the bricks or the mortar or the roof or the carpet or the pews it's because of you lord and father you said if i be lifted up i'll draw men unto me dear god that's the greatest desire that we have in our lives is that you would be exalted we don't want our will exalted we want you to be exalted so lord we just we want to say thank you i i believe god is a congregation we can have joined together and we see father hal that there's been other congregations and different things that sometimes lord has been affected and we're this virus and lord throughout and around the world but we thank you god for your protection lord i know different ones have had it here lord and we just thank you god that lord that you've kept us and you've watched over us it's you lord there's no other way around it it's you father and lord we just ask that you would just continue to help us may we may we be so aware of that lord even as we go through and wear the mask we do all those things we we don't even know lord the things there's all kinds of conflicting ideas and science and everything else but dear god our faith is not in the mask our faith is in you jesus lord you knew this would come about but god you said you'd be with us you said lord when we get sick that you would heal us lord you said you'd bless your bless our bread and you take sickness from among us so that gives us a real comfort lord in our hearts lord god it it doesn't cause us to be arrogant or careless because we recognize these bodies lord lord are our are so susceptible they're not immune from lord from sickness but dear god we're thankful that there's been an inoculation that's moved in on our soul [Music] and all the benefits that come with that lord god the lord has addressed the sin virus lord we thank you for that father the lord we just ask that you would just come now and just take control in the remaining part of this service lord for every heart lord if there be any spirit that's out of line your god may you stabilize it if there be any hold upon any heart father we ask in the name of jesus christ that god you would just come lord by your power in a very personal way and dear god just break every chain lord may it be real to every heart and every life and dear god may our faith just rise in you this morning lord to believe you for all things lord heal those that are sick among us lord god just continue to watch over us lord as an assembly those that are streaming those that are here god we're just looking to you father lord many different needs that have been read there's many needs lord that even outside of this assembly but we look to your father in everything will you just come now lord take lord god this lips of clay lord god get me out of the way i want to surrender lord god and just so step aside that you can come we need to hear from you we need to hear from you jesus so we ask the lord that you'll take control now speak to our hearts in a personal way in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you um i want you to if you turn with me i want to go back into the book of jeremiah and um thank you musicians i appreciate that i didn't tell you where jeremiah 38 verse 7. i'm going to go back and read this before i go forward here this morning just so that everyone with us and those that have been here were able to come back into this this time remember this this time that we're reading about in jeremiah is where uh god it's in the final moments before um israel is going to be carried away exile there's already been um daniel and others have already been taken to babylon jehoiakim one of the other kings right before zedekiah they've already been taken they're down in babylon right now and these are the last here in the closing out if we can see it in this way remember israel had a church ages as well they went through a dark time with that time of ahab so this is a closing out and if we can look at in this way this what we're reading about is actually would be like the lady will see an age to that of israel it's a closing out it's a time to really be sealed away with god it's a time to let god be your refuge because judgment and the wrath of god is certain but i'm so thankful that if as just as that is certain i'm grateful that we can find a certainty in christ under the blood a place that we can rest and we've got a certainty just just to know it's a certainty it's not something we can explain it's just it's a certainty from within our soul amen jeremiah 38 7 now when abed elect the ethiopian once you notice this man's not a jew he's a gentile when abed malek the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the cave in the gate of benjamin abedmelik went forth out of the king's house and spake to the king saying my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the judgment into into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city then the king commanded ibm elect the ethiopians saying take from fence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he died so i bet milleck took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took fence old cast clots and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah remember as we looked at that a few weeks ago you see the care not only did jeremiah need to be raised up he need to be brought out of the dungeon while the princes the princes were the ones that said this man speaks a treasonous message cast him into the dungeon so while some were trying to tear down the message there were others who said this is the message of god and they wanted to lift that message up amen they recognize this is the answer against judgment and abandoned a gentile caught that so he says put old clots old rags i i'm glad it did i'm just how the spirit of god just brought that to us a few weeks ago it wasn't new rags it wasn't beautiful rags sometimes we think that god's got to dwell in beauty but real beauty is character and so it takes lives that the rest nobody would want but god takes old rags old clot you and me lives that can be let down and as they're let down oh it comes up and how they were instructed jeremiah put this underneath you know so that the cord that you're pulled up by doesn't harm you i don't want anything of this word to be taken away i want everything of this word to be fully empowered in my life amen oh my what carefulness and so at bedme like the ethiopian verse 12 said unto jeremiah put now these old cast clots and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords and jeremiah did so so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison can you turn with me over to now jeremiah 39 verse 15. now what we're going to read about is the same abedmalek he took notice he had a there was something that what had pressed on him of the word that he knew jeremiah is god's prophet now zedekiah says jeremiah the prophet but it didn't have the same kind of impact zedekiah we've been looking at he didn't have the same he did not have a revelation that this is god's spokesman this is the mercy of god to us but abimelech had that and abhamalik made it personal now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying go and speak to abed molech the ethiopian so now the word's going to speak to him personally saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men whom thou art afraid for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for i pray unto thee because thou has put thy trust in me saith the lord amen isn't that wonderful amen let's let's just look at this thought here this morning at least to start into faith in the living word is rewarded faith in the living word is reward may god bless you bless the word as you're being seated so you know i look at this here and it's just um something as we've been looking at it we took for you know unbeknownst to me i was just you know this is where i was so caught up but the lord had other plans for the past two weeks and and then how god would all unfold it you never use you see a thought but you don't know how that it's all going to be unfolded you something inspiration is there but nonetheless throughout the past few weeks we even seen what a contrast was taking place uh during this time you had princes of judah who they themselves mile was a prophet zara zedekiah knew jeremiah was a prophet um the rest of the people they knew about jeremiah being a prophet and even when you really begin to look at and i can't really move into this even the babylonians knew jeremiah was a prophet and to see that within it we've seen how that zedekiah was so concerned with himself what if i do this what if i give in what if i he was so concerned about losing what his prestige was he he had a greater value on his prestige as king than he did on surrendering to the word of the lord you know there's things that that can be about your life that it seem pretty value it might be something that a person values but when you really get to consider it what what is it and how does it pack stack up compared to that of eternal life and i'm not just talking when we say eternal life i'm not just talking about well you know when i pass from this life you know i live on that's that that to me is only a smidget of it eternal life is where you receive the life that you should have had in the beginning the reality is you're not even living until you've received the holy ghost that's real reality it's not just well you know um uh well i just you know need to make preparations for you know for death it's it's so much deeper than that i i i think you know thank god for every life that even in sometimes in their dying beds i've been right there where they can't even respond and i come in and talk to them and ask them to squeeze my hand if they can hear me because you know one of the last senses that'll go and and i hear that and i look at that and i think you know how satan's objective is to keep a life from really surrendering and then it gets right down to that place and you might say well brother samuel at least they gave their life to the lord that's that that's true at least they surrendered their life to the lord i'm grateful that at least they're not going to be going to hell i don't have a security of rapture for them that they're in the bride i don't i don't don't have that i but but but as far as salvation yes but you see salvation itself when we're looking at some of this even in john 3 it says that you might be saved so we look at we want a great security and that's in christ i think what a value it is for us to be able by god's grace that we can really give our lives to him that he can live his life through us and so when i when i look at this with abimelech this man has risked his life remember he's he's the he's a king servant and and remember the to the the message has been looked at as treasonous that it's so against the princes of judah and these men should that should have been rallying around what god was doing and what god was declaring but instead they took us opposition against it like we see of the pharisees same way we see how cain rose up in opposition to abel it's a spirit that rose up in opposition to the word that god was vindicating and made known in that hour but this man he interceded for jeremiah there was i want you to think of this this is a man he's a gentile he could not even go in the temple to worship he didn't couldn't go in the temple to worship this man think how paul would put it like this we were on the outside of the covenants there was nothing paul would bring that out in ephesians 2. there was no that was to the commonwealth of israel we understand the hidden part within it you say what are you trying to say i'm trying to say that there was nothing written down that where abomilah could say my goodness i'm gonna have faith in that but how much greater for you and i there's word that god has given to you and i in the scriptures in his word that you and i might have faith in what he has said but it just goes to show it's got to be more than just faith within the written word although that is great but there's got to be faith in the person of jesus christ and he is the word amen he knows this man knows jeremiah is god's prophet not just the prophet he knows he's god's prophet he also knows this is the servant with the word of the lord this is not a man just quoting the bible let me say it like that he does not quote in the bible as we look down here on thursday night there's a great difference between the bible and the word of the lord many can have the bible but they don't have the word of the lord the word of the lord is the inspiration of the holy spirit that comes upon the word to make it alive and real and those names that are sealed in that promise for that generation when the inspiration comes upon that word it reveals the characteristic of jesus christ and as it does that it calls out the character of jesus christ from our life that's to be expressed what is that that's the calling of the names that are wrought in the book in the promised land hallelujah her glory be to god [Music] he's received the testimony of the word and his actions speak you see in verses 16 and 17 i want you to notice as i want you just to take this in god lets them know the words are going to come the judgment the wrath that's being poured out it's going to be in verse 16 it's going to be accomplished in that day before thee remember god said famine was going to come when you read in the book of lamentations lamentations is the spirit of god grieved in the heart of the prophet jeremiah the word has to be spoken but if the word does not come without feeling are you with me god does not look upon you and i as brother branham would put it as god inspired to his heart in standing in the gap he said people are not just made out of sawdust there's a feeling behind it when that word would come amen but jeremiah the spirit of god in jeremiah speaks of how they hear the babies crying out for famine and their tongues were cleaving to the roof of their mouth what i'm trying to say is they abamalik and the rest of them they were there they witnessed judgment already being poured out before the people were taken away there was judgments already coming about in the city famine where they were you know contending for one another's child we're going to eat yours today eat this one tomorrow this is right in the scripture this was already taking place all of that that was breaking around and caving in but there was a word of assurance a place of mercy that abimelech and others have found refuge in the word of the lord amen who am i praise god you see these are my things when you if you go on and read in these scriptures we looked at with zedekiah zedekiah was blind to the promise he was blind to jeremiah this is why when he tried to escape zedekiah now that they pursued after him they killed his sons in front of him and then they put his eyes out why he was already blind to what was going on brother sister one thing i'm thankful for god has not given to you and i that we would lead ourselves but if we'll look to him there's a presence of the living god that comes down into our life into our homes and it's not us trying to figure out how do i answer this question how do i lead my son how do i leave my daughter how do i lead my wife there's a presence of a living god that's real leadership that all we have to do is yield to his presence brother he will lead and guide us into all truth [Applause] i believe that with all my heart not just believe it i know it to be the truth amen praise the lord i know i'm talking to i'm talking to lives and hearts that know that same thing once you think of this so all that's going to be going on around you but in that same day i will deliver the verse 17 in that day yes amen in that day when the spirit of destruction is upon the people my spirit is upon you to deliver you this is god's promise it was not it's no abomination like well you're going to be completely exempt from this i don't know i don't know what abimelech had to go through i don't know if there might have been certain meals that he i don't know but one thing i do know god made a promise in his word he said i've never seen the righteous forsaken i've never seen a child of god have to bake bread i just know this one saying the word came and told him don't worry about the squeeze that's coming just trust in the word that's come to you it's god that'll make a way [Applause] [Music] amen so if babylic wasn't storing up food like i better go buy a campbell soup that was not what abamelec was doing amen he was not listen to me the word comes to let you and i know yes you have to go grocery shopping come on now sure you have to go grocery shopping in order to have food in your house but you see that comes to a place even within this abamalec is not trusting in his own prevention he did not provide this mercy god provided it he accepted it that's why god said don't take any care don't get worried with anxious care hello you damn give me the name of those waiters that fed elijah by the book did elijah go into hiding with we got this dry food that we'll pull water over it and it'll turn to mashed potatoes i'd rather starve he didn't go into there with natural food and they hauled it up there with crates come on somebody elijah went there because that's where god said you get there and i'll sustain you in christ in this revealed word underneath the blood we've got the promise i'll sustain you he said i'll provide for all of your needs sometimes we act as though god needs our help he needs our assistance he don't need our help he don't need our assistance i mean after all when when the sandwich came to elijah i mean elijah just wasn't sitting there and saying okay god bring it on over here and feed me no he recognized god provided he took it right right so you see the balance within it he wasn't just sitting around and you know they're fanning him and he's there on the on the chair and oh my yeah i'd like another one of those and would you come and feed it to me no no he still he had to go and take and receive what god was providing in the natural same way in the spiritual he was trusting in the word of the lord brother i believe that was on my heart that's what the holy spirit is even working in our lives right now what is the level and the depth of your trust in me god knew these hours were going to be here he knew these situations were going to be here this is not taking him by surprise he steal the almighty god [Applause] what a contrast was taking place while the rest of the city was experiencing judgment friends you see this is the gripping was going in even in jeremiah's heart if they only would have turned now they weren't going to keep back the wrath and the judgment but if they only would have turned mercy said go out and surrender yourselves to the king of babylon go out and give yourselves to them that's why that looks like a treasonous word but such a contrast while the rest of the city is involved in chaos and famine and things that are taking place the bible records it in the book of lamentations ravishings and everything going on all around what a contrast in the midst of it abamalik was resting in the word of the lord let me just say this very clearly this man had joy amen wish i could really preach on that this morning this man had joy praise the lord you see it depends on what you're looking at right right if he was looking at all the destruction going on around there it ain't no joy in looking at that but you see there's been a word that's attracted his attention hallelujah it's in a word that's been fulfilled and it had attracted his attention it brings real joy in our heart what brings real joy not that i know every event that's going to unfold and happen and how this is going to be and how that's going to be that's not the joy the joy is that he said i will deliver thee the sword will not touch thee i will bring you out amen amen hallelujah because thou have put your trust in me think of it abamalik here a gentile ethiopian he caught and he heard the mercy in the word of god god's no respect to persons you see even though the city jerusalem oh it was known as a city of praise it was known as a city it was not one paying tribute but it was one that other cities pay tribute to it you see it's the the character it was the character of the life they had gotten away from remember jerusalem was not the walls jerusalem was the character of christ in his people you with me they got away from that soon as they got away from that it didn't matter how many strongholds they had how many bull works it did not matter how their walls were their gates their locks that itself did not matter that was not their strength their strength was jehovah the lord was their strength and they got away from that character are you with me now so while israel when they the jews had gone away from the character of that no that jerusalem there was a prophet that was standing there and calling them back and letting them know you drifted from that character and that character of what jerusalem really is there was a man who was a gentile and he saw the representation of that jerusalem in that message brother are you with me now we see a representation in the message that god has sent to you and i it's a representation of a new jerusalem it's the holy ghost that's been sent back among his children not a portion but the entire fullness of the holy ghost it's the spirit of our homeland that's brought us back [Applause] he was an ethiopian but he identified with the character of jerusalem [Music] makes this statement in christ the mystery i'm going to read this he says since he he was made all things was made for him and by him and since that's true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us that's a big mouthful he has come down to identify think about this the god of glory came down and took upon a body made in the likeness of sinful flesh he came down and identified himself with us his subjects that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest but that ain't just 2 000 years ago amen that made a way so that the high priest could come to your door the high priest could come to your life he could come and take a word that'll identify the situation and the condition in your life and be able to address that situation and say there is a blood that takes care there is a life in that blood that will minister to the remnant what's he doing he's coming down he don't withhold himself he comes down and makes himself known to you and i yeah i think about it god could say a lot of things there's a lot of times with things even as i'm studying and just just giving just looking to the lord and praying over things and sometimes our inspiration and things will start but when i always look at things i don't try to figure it out but i look at it that the heart's desire is is that sometimes you can say things you can go through and identify this unfolding and this and that but there is even a greater where you can catch that and preach the character of christ in that unfolding because that's who has to be over the people and take effect on our lives sometimes i hope you understand me sometimes words can can can sometimes get things off track not the words but i hope you understand what i'm saying when the gospel is made to be in amen simplicity that ain't me trying to make it simple that's got to be him we should be identified with him how by living for him not just a confession so many people take a confession got to a place now are you a christian i'm methodist well that's a long way from being making yourself known as a christian look what the methodist does i'm baptist well look what the baptist does i'm catholic look what they do but the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you it goes on it says now you say i'm pentecostal he said that don't mean a thing it's christ identified in you but samuel i believe the message that's wonderful but has christ been identified in you amen amen i'm not talking about your failing i'm talking about is he identified in you [Music] that's when he has recognized you remember the word came back to abimelech it came back it came personally a bed millet had identified himself with the word in that hour before you can identify yourself with the word the word's got to be revealed amen how can you know how can you know what to identify with if the word's not revealed oh glory be to god i spoke with tongues devils do too i shouted the muhammadans buddhism everything else shouts the indians scream at the snake dance sure they all do cults clans and everything else scream and holler they holler and shout at a baseball game but when christ is identified in you what is the holy spirit trying to speak here he's letting it be known don't put your rest and stop in an emotion [Applause] emotion comes with it but don't put your stuck in an emotion this is talking about a deep inner work where jesus christ comes in and he takes care of that old sin nature he'll never come where he's not invited though when christ is identified in you identifying his self then you are christlike which the word christian means to be christ-like there is your identification now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him thank you lord you might say salmon i don't know everything god don't ask you to know everything amen but what god is dealing with your heart going on in his word he's drawing you to him you identify with that word you say amen to that word you don't look about well i don't know if i can do this and i don't know if i can do that you stand on that word and say i can do all things through christ who strengthens me it's not your power doing it [Music] it's his power there's power in this world hallelujah i tell you the greatest thing you do is you say well i just can't get rid of my pants i can't get rid of my earrings or i can't get rid of my pornography or i can't get around on this you can't get rid of it but i can tell you there's a living lord jesus christ if you give yourself to him he'll give you power to overcome that if you'll be honest with him and say lord i don't want this to know more about my life i want to be identified with you i'm tired of struggling to live right i want the liver the doer of the world to come on the inside of me you start identifying like that that invites him to come and identify himself in you [Applause] there's no excuse but samuel that's awful hard just swallow it down there ain't no excuse there's a place a lot harder than this place now if it had been you and i let's just be honest you and i would have just went oh one more that's the difference but peter picks this up this is one now who's been identified with him in acts 5 31 him talking about jesus him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things peter said i know he's been seated in power i know he's a high priest how do you know because i have the expression the transformation in my life because i in my life i am seated in power as a son of god that's what the holy ghost does it brings the dunamis the power of god that it actually seats you in the right place [Applause] it takes away that old nature and it places you in the lamb's book of life your name was already right there you didn't do that god came and did that for you it was god that stirred up your life it was not your faith it was god's faith that came and gave you faith and so also we're witnesses of these things and so also is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him let me just drop this down full obedience you've heard this statement probably most of you have full obedience to the word grants you the token this is the paradox we're talking about obedience god is not just looking at actions let me just be very simple here you could take a person that's got shorter hair than me it's hard to believe in it they might have all sorts of things that they've come in here with or or what have you and you might look at and say well they got to get rid of this and got to get rid of that and got to get rid of this and got to get rid of that got to get rid of this got to get rid of that got to get rid and you got to borrow other people's fingers too but all it takes is one moment in his presence [Applause] all takes us one moment in his presence and that heart is turned in obedience it's gone brother it's over it is finished [Music] it's hearkening to god's voice it's the dove coming to lead the lamb just as he led the lamb to calvary the dove led the lamb notice where was the dove remember the spirit left him in the garden are you with me it left him in the garden but it led him why showing that in order for this life to come to you and i the same holy spirit that came upon the lamb of god would be the same dog that would lead lambs of god better written in the lamb's book of life it would lead us to a place of surrender that the life of the lamb of god which is god's own life could come manifest in oh glory be to god this is where the scripture says in hebrews 11 6. i'm trying to get to the point here without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is he's a living god the living god and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i want to read here just a few scriptures in isaiah 40 verse 9 these scriptures it would speak of god coming and restoring israel but remember it speaks in type of the bride and once these these scriptures have been resonating within my heart here for some time he says oh zion verse 9 that bring us good great good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bring us good tidings lift up by voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young what care amen what kind isaiah 62 11 behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say you to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken you see god knew all this was going to come about but this is the promise in the regathering of israel not just in them coming back from babylon this is talking to the 144 000 that's going to receive their visitation a city that is called forsaken but you will no longer be called forsaken you will be called shout out who is it that it sought you out it's the holy spirit that has shot you and i out our lives listen to me a life that is out in sin it speaks of a forsakenness it speaks of a life that's without a comforter this is what god had a problem with the priests and the prophets in the time of jeremiah and the other times they kept on prophesying peace and peace and peace and peace but they never dealt with the iniquity that was in the heart there was a wound that needed to be dealt with there was some hurt there was iniquity that needed to be dealt with but instead all they were doing was patching it out patching it up instead of really ministering the remedy there's only one faith that can minister to a real remedy of a heart of a womb of a sin sick soul and that's a word that lets you know if you don't get it taken care of it cankers and when tankers spread it dies if you've got the least little bit of twins this morning i would let that twins become greater and don't allow the enemy to deaden it i think there ought to be some sons and daughters rise up and have some real righteous indignation toward the devil i ain't set in this condition no more amen you're not putting it over on me no more a lot of times we get mad at ourselves for doing stupid stuff but we really need to get mad at the devil sometimes we say oh why did i put the water there or why did i do a tear or what i'd do a tear oh dummy me why did i do this we really need to get mad at the devil glory amen hallelujah how do we stand face to face with him stand on the word yes right amen brother stands in the message of shame and he stands before all the people and he says you know what even as he prays he said god forgive me he said it's got to a place he said when i'm praying he said it's almost like we're just asking the devil devil could you leave he said shame on us we ought to stand there and observe the devil take your hands off i'm not ashamed of this word it has power in it to free and to loosen it behold we said notice in these scriptures he comes notice he cometh behold he cometh right now we are looking and expecting the second coming the physical return of the lord jesus christ but do you realize he's already here he's come by his word the day of pentecost sealed the first coming yes you're with me the light it sealed it and it opens up that of the second coming where they're expecting we're expecting his literal return but remember before we can ever be part of that to be part of that coming he's got to come to us and come in us this is where the scripture said that salvation cometh behold he cometh amen amen amen his reward is with him this this term reward means the fair or the passage that's needed to pay the fair glory his reward is with him the holy ghost is not something separate from god amen it is the token it is jesus christ it is almighty god coming in to that life it is that fair that's already been paid that is the reward [Music] rewards with a body change that ain't it there's also going to be rewards handed out those who stood faithful hallelujah amen oh we could go on on that that there are rewards but you know what we're not interested and i believe this on my heart we're not doing what we're doing for rewards [Music] it's going to be rewarding enough i think of like that old black brother brother branham calls back and they're talking about him oh what's going to do with your robin crown when he gets there he said don't you talk to me about no robin crowd he said when i get there i just want to see jesus i want to see the one who paid the price for me i want to see the one who came and drew me to himself i want to see the one who changed me i just want to worship him our goal is not rewards in there but let me tell you every reward from the change of the body to all that god god gives for each and every part of our life let me just tell you there's no glory that we can take in it it's because god has given you and i the grace to be able to yield our own lives to him paraphrase over these jesus is here and he gathers his church together you want to make a church small church i i ain't trying to say nothing you you understand what i'm saying i'm just trying to say at that time he walks up to his and he says who do men say that i the son of man am right some say you're elijah some say you know you're john the baptist come back some say you're jeremiah's are you you catching what it is they recognize what they see in him it's a vacation that's been in the others it's the same one that's identified in the rest of them this is what a bed malek saw in jeremiah it was not just jeremiah he was not just oh i loved jeremiah no his remember god when god spoke to him he never said anything oh because you love jeremiah and you really like this about jeremiah no god recognized that abimelech's faith but he found a hiding place in christ that was ministered through jeremiah the prophet jeremiah couldn't hide him but jeremiah had a message of christ and that message said get under the blood and you get under the blood and you will be found where they have escaped who do men say that i am now you know peter and this wasn't peter i remember i wonder you know how they were all sitting around and this comes out peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god that wasn't this noggin up here there was a seed on the inside though that seed had not been quickened yet but in that moment it spoke up it's just like as a young person or whoever else or whatever that reality that quickening may not have struck your heart yet but there's something about it with this word that you know this is jesus christ revealed people can try to tear down this message and what and more you tear down the message you're tearing down jesus christ flat and simple but there's something about it even though you could stand there and you know your life ain't lining up but what is it there's a seed on the inside that says i can't explain it but i know it's the truth i know it's the truth what is that that's a representation preach with me if you only let it have the right way that same one who's moving across that right now if you only let him come in he'll quicken that seat and it'll be raised in power [Applause] [Music] who do you say that i am this same revelation brought authority to loosen and to bind what brought the authority to loosen and bind the word listen the word ministered made them aware of their rights as sons they didn't have the power yet they had exclusive they didn't have due to muslims but when the word listen how can you know what belongs to you unless the word comes to let you know this belongs to you [Applause] as many as received him to them gave him the exclusion to become the sons of god he took the word ministering to you you didn't see it in yourself i didn't see it in myself but it took him he knew what was inside of you this word brother samuel why is this coming so strong like this because i believe the holy ghost is trying to tell us it's more than just coming to a message church it's more than just knowing brother brown is a prophet it's more than just you having a bible in your house it's more than you being a real good devotional person it's much deeper than that thank god that all those things that you know it's deeper than that it's where christ has to be identified in you you say how do i know when he's identified in me it isn't that well i haven't been walking on water i've been turning water into wine no you don't need to turn water into wine he turns your life from chaos into joy he took away what was down on the inside of your life he removed that old sin nature there's no desire for the things of the world what did that a living god that same phrase and christ the mystery and he says who do you say i am now it's always easy people can look back in history but who do you say he is now amen can i read it well he's a philosopher he had this social religion he's a good man we believe his teachings is right it's subject to be lived by i think it'd make us all better if we did we we ought to have our churches and so forth that's a santa claus story it's not expressions of some church that we should express something that's true well i'm in a methodist or i'm a baptist let's bring it on into our rings well i believe in this doctrine i believe in this doctrine i'd rather be identified with jesus christ i don't want no turn being identification from me i want to live lord jesus christ to be the identified one right here in our midst [Applause] you're not careful you exile him huh we can't you can't invite jesus and put him in a box you got to let him be jesus and you got to invite him because he's jesus and you want him to be jesus you want him to help himself to your refrigerator you want him to help him help himself to your coffee pot you want him to help himself to your chair and take his shoes off and kick his feet up you want him to feel at home in your life [Applause] you want people when they look at you they may not know where to go to church may not know who your pastor is may not know all this right here but they look at you and they come up and they know that there is something about your life you're a christian it ain't important that they know who your pastor is it's important that they know jesus christ is living on the inside of you it's not expressions of some church then we should express something it's a life that you don't live yourself oh i can only do this if i can you're missing it don't let the devil complicate it right that's right well i can't do it in our own nature our own will you can't do it i tried as a young man and fell flat on my face why would god let me do it because god knew this gospel is not about your human strength amen god don't want our human strength he wants us to yield to him amen can i preach yes man too many times the reason people don't get the holy ghost is because they want the holy ghost added to their life instead of recognizing you need to get rid of your life because the holy ghost ain't going to come in and live in the same house got an old filthy spirit is living here he won't share rooms he won't cohabitate he's got to have the uppermost seat what do you say when you repent and you say god i gotta have the holy ghost more than anything else i'm tired of this life then you're getting somewhere [Applause] [Music] hey that's how it is with other things within your life even in the molding of our character it don't just stop and it just you know it's something that god deals with our heart it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by himself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit lebron said somebody says how do i know i'm not losing my mind maybe a man loses mind does that if you have the mind of christ christ expresses himself through you and he shows that it's him you've not lost your mind some people under illusions of things goes out and becomes insane come on we've all seen nuts well that we know that's wrong but that you know the devil trying to impersonate the real thing before it gets there that's always a bogus right but a real man is to lose his own thoughts lose his own thinking and not come up blindly you come up with your right senses are you catching this very simple but you come up with your right senses and christ takes you over and expresses himself whether you come to the altar here or whether you let where god meet you in the altar of your heart you come with your right senses and you say god i want you to take me over goes on he says now when he uh paragraph 2 24 when christ takes you over he'll express that word right through you because it's him he is the word and then you can see the expression of christ not some illusion a real genuine christ expressing himself right through you amen i've read a scripture here but i'm not going to go through and read this one either for sake of time but it's there mark 8 where jesus has said he talks about if any man is going to follow after me he has to first deny himself and take up his cross his cross and follow me
