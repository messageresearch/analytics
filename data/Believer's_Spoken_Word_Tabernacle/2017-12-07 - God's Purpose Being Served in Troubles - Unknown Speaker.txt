have intended for it to accomplish in our lives we pray Lord we love you and we thank you we give ourselves to you Lord and just ask you and just speak to us Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's just look in the word of the Lord tonight in Genesis 31 I want to go back in here and just look a little bit more into these things in Genesis 31 verse 1 and he heard the words of Laban son saying Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers half he gotten all this glory and Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was not toward him as before I would dare say that even Laban sons would not have had what they had if not God had brought Jacob there it wouldn't have had that but to see the blessing that from God word committed to Jacob and here they are but we see how things have turned in this time look at this this is so precious of verse 3 Jacob sees the countenance of Laban changing but in verse 3 and the Lord said unto Jacob return unto the land of thy father's and to that kindred and I will be with me in that wonderful he sees the things changing toward him and as he sees that God speaks to my what a wonderful thing isn't it and they're wonderful when the Lord speaks to our heart even in the midst of things that sometimes it seems like what's going on here but this is a moment and the Lord speaks them is this return in verse four and Jacobson and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock and said unto them I see your father's countenance than it is not toward me as before but the God of my father that's been me and you know that with all my power I have served your father and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but God suffered him not to hurt me amen may God bless the reading of his word bless use your being seated I'd like to keep on reading their verse seven how that David Jacob mentions that he's aware you know God could have I've shown to Jacob in the midst of this time he could have shown to Jacob when it came down to where Laban deceived him by giving him Leah instead of Rachel first God could have uncovered that but God didn't uncover that and show that to him at that moment that's my brother Brown will tell us in in many parts of a message in Robert LeBron keeps going to John 5:19 and he's he's bringing that into his in that's the Ministry of Christ working not just only there in the ministry where I son of man is revealing thee son of men but it is the same principle within our lives even as believers and brother Brown remember the Spirit of God says this is the harmony that is to exist now and brother BAM we'll take it over and over even in God I think it's God identified by his own characteristics in 1964 well brother BAM says many people get the wrong idea and the wrong slant about prophets he said they look as though that they themselves just did what they wanted to do he and he takes us back to Elijah Elijah stood on Mount Carmel said I'd done all of this at thy word o God he goes on to say how they said that a they can only operate as God would reveal himself to them for no flesh the scripture says can glory in his presence and the Prophet says in that same quote even the flesh of Jesus Christ could not glory in the presence of God or it was God who revealed himself through the Sun it was bringing back that which was lost and restoring that relationship so even when we look at this this verse of scripture in verse seven of how that God permitted all of this to take place but yet Jacob is aware God gave permission for all of this but he suffered not him to hurt me so God God has limits you with me God has limits on things and Jacobs aware of this that God has not suffered him to hurt now notice in verse 13 of Genesis 31 here here is Jacob he's rehearsing now remember he's called Leah and he's called Rachel he's called them unto the field and in verse 13 he's here he's rehearsing as God has spoke to him I am the God of Bethel where thou anointest the pillar and where thou Valis the vow unto me now arise and get the out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred and Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house are we not counted of him strangers now what look how things are are shaping up Jacob has called them to to the field with with this very purpose in mind that they are going to leave but notice when he calls them and begins to make these things known that we have read here their response is what portion do we have here what inheritance do we have here God is preparing not just as he dealt with Jacob's life to leave already before in the previous chapter but God has made a way so that when he speaks to Jacob in this hour and he says I'm the God of Bethel he's already been dealing with Jacob's heart so that when God speaks directly to him he's already prepared to move upon that authority of the word that's how God will deal with our lives many times the Holy Spirit dealing with our lives not just in a saw servus but sometimes God has been dealing weeks and weeks and weeks and time to do what soften us to the point to where when he drops his word were ready and in a condition and ready to receive it to think of God in this hour it could not just come directly and drop the message just right away but remember everything started with the signs and wonders the residue the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ here in our midst what was it doing preparing the hearts of the people for what a message that was going to follow the sign that they were seeing of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ God has an order just like even when the word itself came to Nathan or David rather and David was in the wrong with mishima but Nathan never just charged right in there and said you are wrong but what did he do he took the word and he opened up David to a place to where now when the word could come to David David was ready to resume it to it and act upon it God knows what he's doing to think of it God knows and understands that and God will come by his presence just like in the beginning in Genesis 1 when there was a need for this change upon this earth the word spoke and when the word went forth the Spirit of God began to move upon the waters see how God moves in to do what and the when the spilling the word says mood it is to change conditions or create the atmosphere that's needed for the word to come forth sometimes the things of what of how that we are looking at things and when we see this here sometimes the conditions and what we're looking at we see the word that God has spoken we see the word then he's laid out here and it word that not only applies to the prophecy and the fulfillment of the age that we're living in but even when it comes down to simple things within our life and I don't mean to say simple just to make light of that but I mean where that here these things are being fulfilled prophetically within the earth we see these things taking place here we're watching prophecy itself being the same thing here just yesterday or Tuesday when when President Trump announced that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel listen friends those things are going on as well but to look at it let's see bring it down even into here and apply it to our own lives it's God Himself causing even you and I if we can say it like this to recognize that here what poem this earth God by His grace we are his chosen place of worship we are the place where God chooses to tabernacle in the hearts of his children you see all of these things even within that it's called moving even upon our lives to where there's things that deals with things that sometimes we want to just lay aside or we want to just put off as insignificant but remember this word came to prepare a people for rapture and translation it came to prepare us fully and give us in this lifetime a real victory and give to us discernment even in our own lives to where we're able to live victorious even over resentment even over jealousy even over all these things it's the power of this revealed word that lifts you and I and changes you and I and let me tell you something this word being revealed there's times when you face and you sense pressures in your life like Laban himself the sons were yes sowing all these things and here Jacob realizes things are changing toward me but God says to him return unto me and here Jacob he calls his wives unto himself I tell you sometimes God permits things to come about for one purpose and that's to call us unto himself think of this they this is not Jacob putting words in their mouths this is Rachel and Leah this is their testimony Jacob's already told them you've seen my testimony I've never I have I've served your father with everything within me they sing that but notice their attentiveness there's nothing here for us so if there's nothing here for us let's go you see how that the things that we God will permit the changing in the turning of to where it's it's moving us it's taking away all the feathers and everything out of the nest what's it doing it's turning us you said brother Sam is turning us to look into the coming of the Lord we're looking to the coming Lord but friends listen it's not just something where something that's way out there and I don't mean that the coming of the Lord is way out there but I'm saying that God also is moving within our lives individually and calling us beyond the our own selves absolutely the Prophet over and over in that message perfect strength by perfect weakness how that he would speak of this and he says oh how the tabernacle he said we need a good killing this morning he said and I need a good killing with it killing a deadening a laying down but to notice how that that Rachel and Leah how they answered here and they are already declaring in verse 15 where aren't we not strangers among them he has sold us and hath quite devoured also our money for all the riches which God had taken from our Father than is ours and our children's now then whatsoever God has said unto thee do it miss wonderful family harmony is that right this is unity they're united this isn't I don't want to go but it's here they are they want to go they don't see any reason to stay even in their land that they've known their whole life this place that they've grown up in their whole life but now they look upon this place and say we're a stranger here we have no continuing City here we had no inheritance here God had to allow this to get this way for them whatever it was so that Rachel Leah this was their testimony let's leave whatever God has said let's go my verse 17 then Jacob rose up and said his sons and his wives upon camels he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in an Haram and for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan in the message victory day where the RAM says Jacob had a V day one time he was scared to go back to his brother because he had done evil but yet the Holy Spirit began to warn him in his heart return back to the homeland where you come from you've come from the homeland you've done evil over there now I'm sending you back and he says that's what the devil is so after us about that's what the devil is so after the bride the church for now it's getting close to v-day she's getting real close that's when the enemy does his worst to reroute the Bible said whoa into the earth because the devil is like a roaring lion in the last days going around devouring what he will you see woe unto them the persecutions and things would take place hold right to it don't you move right or left stay right with the word God said so that doesn't Jacob he said longing in his heart everything seemed to be wrong he wanted to go back home the Holy Spirit was leading him he had and made a promise to God he had to go to Bethel to pay these tithing and so forth so here God has been dealing with Jacob's life the Holy Spirit four years from when Joseph was born then how God speaks to him so directly and now Joseph yields to what God is calling for or Jacob yields to what God is calling for you see what good would it do for God to send a message if there wasn't hearts to receive it what good would it do for God to give a give a word and even even when we look at 4:00 at 4:00 at 4:00 this evening Thursday night and Sunday and in the surf what good would it do for God to give a word if there wasn't hearts that could receive we know that in all of this that even when you look through this in the time of Jeremiah you see it even in Ezekiel even when Israel was out of their land before remember God God was the one who was going to calls and perform his good word and deal with the hearts of Israel because it wasn't just after 70 years that all of a sudden the switch was turned on and they walked out of Babylon but everything that would take place they didn't know every little detail of all that was going to go on but God let it know that I will perform my word in causing you to return it wasn't God dragging them out of Babylon but God dealing with the heart to where they longed to come out of Babylon and it wasn't a longing to I want to get out of Babylon I hate Babylon I can't stand babylon babylon so bad over synonym babylon no wonder that their desire to leave was about him not about condition so much you understand sometimes it's things looking at it's not just about being free of conditions it's about uniting with him because if it was just to me I want to be done with this I'm tired of this entitled little assist I'm tired of that I'm tired of this and I'm tired of that and if it's just that then once that is lifted then where do you go how many times the Prophet tells us in desperation people will ask for certain things and asking not just what he's told us there I've seen it in my life you've seen it here where people were asked for certain things I've got to only heal me if God will only do this and God all and do this and God does it faithfully to show his care and attentiveness to his word and they turn right back around and while serving you see what the purpose is what they wanted they didn't want to serve him they just wanted free this is hindering me come on somebody you know I want to see people delivered from judgment not just to be delivered and just to say well this was a problem is his hinders my work and I can't get a job that I can't it's got to be something greater than that it's got to be I want to know the Lord Jesus and me him he'll take care of the drug problem amen he'll become your gospel he'll become your drug he'll become your complete dependency and you will be addicted to him amen it's about him the management we think of things in our life sometimes and sometimes things God allows to show greenness about our life areas that we need to be matured Ian oh my brother sister let us not get caught up so much in the area I want to be free of this but let us say Lord let me be so United with you Lord help me Lord that then my life can be so dead too that by being so alive in you Lord sometimes sometimes things are already moving behind the scenes before we ever see anything physically God was dealing with Jacobs heart before you ever seen a move noticeably God was dealing with Rachel and Leah's heart as well to think of it Jacobs purpose what's the whole purpose why is he here why is he there in Iran why is he there what's the purpose about that it was a purpose for him to obtain a wife now I want you to think of this because I want you to look at this just in your life in my life did he even before the seed itself is quickened and expressed God himself show it shows he has his hand upon our life every step of the way and Hosea 12:12 Jacob fled into the country of Syria and Israel served for a life and for a wife he kept sheep Jacob fled but Israel served yet he's not it's not been quickened yet you ask me it's not been quickened but yet what is this it shows this purpose that he's there for is to obtain a wife that was not Jacob that was Israel that was that part yet not quickened but was there serving for a wife that's why the Prophet could say here stood a twelve-year-old boy in the temple and they looked at him and marveled and the Prophet could say as he stood there he says you you know you're not I must be about my father's business the Prophet said a little twelve-year-old boy he said no earthly wisdom of his own he said but to think of it he said the father didn't even dwell in him at the time but here he was speaking oh that was that seed that was laying there the whole time so here in Genesis 28 15 this remember I bring you back to this because here is Jacob he's received this promise and valve from the Lord and God has said this that I am with thee and will keep thee in all the places whether thou goest and we'll bring the again into this land I will not leave the until I have done that which I have spoken to the we can say perfectly and clearly when God makes this known to Jacob here before he ever here at vessel before he ever gets to her on Jacob doesn't know what all that's going to entail he doesn't know and that's Richard that the countenance is gonna be turned against him he doesn't know that the coming back into the land is going to involve pressure he doesn't know that adversity is gonna strike his way he doesn't know that that that's part of God bringing him back into the land God doesn't tell us everything God doesn't tell us everything in even in the timeline of everything neither does God want you an act to guess or presume but just walk faithfully in what is revealed all of the parts I want you to think of this in in in the time of the exodus here and to look at these things here here in Exodus 2 verse 23 a familiar part we're familiar with this the scripture said it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel side by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage if you read back over into Exodus 1 there's none there's no doubt about it in Exodus 1 when everything was coming upon them there's no doubt about look remember when the Pharaoh had said take any male child and throwing put him in there of the crocodiles and so forth but to think about it how that the Hebrew midwives would not do that they were not heed to that Kings commandment look here's pressure coming even at that time but yet it's not the timing of the exact moment of the exodus but all of it is set in motion even though they don't see everything yet and I dare say in that time here you find that this way that the slavery the scripture goes on to say that here was all as we read last week it was them looking and out of fear they're saying oh we got to do something with these people if we don't do something they're liable to rise up against us arrival to do this live with everything was speculation it was all propaganda everything to sway that of Egypt toward that of Israel and then to see how things are coming coming coming about God allows things to continue into a time but then notice because Moses had to be born Moses had to be born it would seem like listen to us immediately when pressure starts shoot God steps in but how many years was that how long was that from when the very first one rose and the scripture is clear to point out he knew not Joseph God permitted that to arise in that hour one who knew not not Joseph knew not the blessings of Joseph but there had to be all of these parts had to be ready not only did God have to have a man ready on the scene that God would step down and in such simplicity would feeling something by the way of promise and in that word and his promise and that pillar fire accompanying that prophet would take a word down there to the children of Israel and they would recognize that the god of our fathers has visited us he's with us he's here to come and fulfill the promise of his word amen god allowed the end of the sainted God is preparing the hearts of the people and as he's preparing the hearts of the people to receive it he's also allowing those in the land of Canaan to wax worse and what's worse and wax worse and worse worse all of these things are going on if the children of Israel would have been focused on the waxing worse they would have missed the deliverance just keep your eyes and step with what God is revealing to us and then when it's time for us to stand here God will prepare us for that point by the way my title on this tonight God's purpose being served in troubles God's purpose being served in troubles I know this may not maybe mean so much maybe to a lot of you maybe maybe may not mean to anything but to one person but the Lord laid these things upon my heart and months ago and just looking at this tonight I believe the Word of God as timely don't you I believe that I believe the Word of God is right in season in our hearts the Bible goes on to say how that God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them not to think of how that you know brother Adam puts it in this manner of how that there was a favor who raised up who didn't know Joseph and that was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of the Exodus so even though note nothing seems to be noticeably changing right there when that king arose who knew not Joseph that was the beginning of the beginning right there though while the rest of the world the rest of Egypt the rest of Israel they knew that not but yet that was the beginning God had to allow that well you say the Egyptians elected that man or this or that or he God orchestrated it and when the thing began to form under a political power began to form God begin to get ready the iniquity of the hammerites was fulfilled the time that he promised Abraham was fulfilled and the time of deliverance was at hand look at these words of powerful words and God permitted it didn't take God by surprise God permitted a pharaoh to rise up who knew not Joseph and ramasees was born right after said he come ramasees and ramasees was the one who knew not the blessings of Joseph he didn't know what the spiritual side was he was only a political genius that he could take a Ethiopia and the rest of the countries under military might that's all he knew was the military might think of how that God made himself known to Abraham that your seed sojourn that's these things when God begins to just deal quick and those things are so precious they're gonna sojourn in this land that's not their land they're just gonna soldier this is not our land we're just sojourning this is not my inheritance it's my possession I'm just so journeying here but one of these days one of these moments I should say it shall be changed which is so journey your seed shall sojourn in a strange land any land that's not God's promised land is a strange land strange fire strange God's it's strange but God said I will deliver them with a mighty hand now what you think of this deliver them if they're gonna need to be delivered it shows that there is going to be circumstances that would merit and call for deliverance God would allow the circumstances to come into a place that then he steps down through his word and this and manifests himself as the deliverer they walked into Egypt freely of their own accord they were not hog-tied and bound by chains that drug into Egypt they went down there of their own accord but how that God was letting him known it's gonna take a mighty hand glory be to God nothing short nothing short of the power of God think of this improving his word in here brother diamond says Abraham seed did sojourn in Egypt for hundred years he promised also to deliver them with a mighty hand a strong hand he would deliver the people out of the Egyptian bondage and he kept his word look what he had to do to get them children down in Egypt look what he had to do God permitted look what he had to do to get him down into Egypt the words already spoken they're gonna be in a strange land how do you get him in a strange land nothing's out of cater but look what has to take place in the brother Ram says it looked like disaster had befall was be falling and everything it was horrible for Joseph to be considered dead look how he's been bringing this it was horrible for him to be considered dead think about his father remember his father he wept they could hear him throughout the whole camp he wept look God could have showed Jacob right there they're lying to you he was a prophet not gonna showed him there you're lying but if God would have done that you want to messed up the whole program sometimes there's things that God could speak to you and I and show us certain things but listen if he did it would spoil the whole program of what he has for our life I don't need to know every step of the way I just need to know that he is with me that's all I got to know [Applause] you with me tonight we're not gonna know every step of the way but understand I know I this trial is coming on and I know one doesn't know we don't we don't know we don't know why those things are coming about that is scriptural friends do you understand that that scriptural it's not scriptural for God to come around and tell you this is why you're going for this this is why you're going through this that's not scriptural God never came down and told Daniel Daniel you're going through this because let me tell you why I want to show myself to you like I never showed myself to you before I want I want you to see me that I am there as that ever-present light that can shut the mouth of the lines he didn't tell him that but when Daniel got there after the test was over Daniel could say I saw him like I never saw him before Daniel you say Daniel he had God visited him in the angel here coming down there on the river he had many visitations let me tell you something you had many visitations I've had many visitations but when we're in the midst of the test or trial how precious is the visitation of Almighty God oh it's like no other time why he reveals himself I am your help I am your deliverer I am your salvation and Satan's Whitford and chattered and whatever more oh but let us hold faithful to the Lord say God help me look at this oh my he said Jacob his father think of it he said to believe that his own son had been killed by animals how hard now look now no look on brother BAM Drex this now here's a promise that's got to be fulfilled a promise that is needed to be fulfilled and here you have people within it better sorrowful hurting there's things that they're believing that's not true Joseph's not gone and God is permitting it why so that his plan is being worked out how hard it was on little Joseph to know that the poor little fellow away from his people betrayed by his brethren throw it into a ditch supposingly to be dead sheep blood put up on his coat where they had slayed a lamb to eat it put the blood upon it and took it to his father knowing all this but Joseph could remember one thing that the hand of the Lord was upon him he knew that he was a believer prophetic I going down in here into Joseph's life I believe that was on my heart the prophetic I how this prophet none wanted by the Spirit of God and the Prophet was able to look at this let me tell you if he I believe with all my heart even to that speck that he talked about in Paul a prisoner Jesus Christ how that God permitted Joseph to be down there in that prison he said because he had some pride that needed to be worked out God was interested in specks not just blobs so God said that speck will hinder you God was working it out that's what did it take a prophetic hey no matter how much think of this this was not imagination this was not somebody walking by you in the church and they walk by you and then your imagination goes I don't know you know they walk right by me you know and this and that and so forth and whatever more Britannian we ought to be beyond that listen to me now we could say we ought to be beyond that remember it's the enemy that comes in whispers it's what we do with the wood that comes if you're not living where you want to be living where that Christ is your all-in-all to where you're able to say you know what if that is true it's true so what they're my brother they're my sister can I get an amen on that one he'll horrid be to God no matter how much his brothers turned him out how much there was no cooperation anything I don't know if I have that one even down in there but the RAM goes on to this this Joseph knew God would keep this way when he saw that vision of all them bowing before him he know that he had that he know that had come to pass because it was it would come to pass because it was thus saith the Lord Joseph didn't understand every part but what he did know he was a believer that's all that we have to know I am a believer just like how brother brother John was ministering here on those Thursday nights secure in Christ it's our rest you don't allow the enemy to try to trouble you in other areas you rat the rest and where our ground is that we operate from we are secure in him as a believer as a believer what's this he says how would arrest ourselves in the word he says yes Joseph had to go through had much to go through go down into Egypt but God brought him out just exactly as he as he said think God permitted a family not only did this happen but then God permits a family shows it to pharaoh he couldn't have shown it to Joseph first he had to show the Pharaoh if he has shown it did she could have shown it to Joseph first but it will if he shown it to Joseph first Pharaoh would never have accepted it but God showed it to Pharaoh first and then God had won at that time all of a sudden oh I remember there's a guy who told me this and this and this in the prison his memory was sealed until an appointed time I wonder how many cases came before Pharaoh's court of dream and other things I wonder how many but yet God would not allow the action to come and his memory to be charged you would think friends you would think that that man would remember and talk about that the whole time his life was on the line but God sealed it and he didn't remember until the right time the situation arose it was not the wisdom of that man is the wisdom of God that said this is a time speak boy speak for his people this is a time God permitted a famine and then when Joseph's instrumental of the Lord he brought out of the prison how everything looks in the prison but God has him brought out of prison Sheen shaved a robe put on him and there he stands in front of Pharaoh and he begins to interpret the dream that's given to Pharaoh begins to speak it right out it's through through even his actions or the word that's coming forth that identifies his name here he has given a name of zaphenath-paneah the revealer of the hidden things right in my and when you look at the anointing of the holy spirit the angel the Lord remember what God said my name is Enya it will always bear the characteristic of Jesus Christ here Joseph he comes into this place oh my he could being in the pit being in there mud and everything else riding around with those the men that were dragging him along and water however they the whole encounter was could he ever have imagined of standing there and being the more one of the most powerful people there in that of Egypt and to know that that position was not given to him because he was somebody it was given to him because God's Word was to be fulfilled through his life Oh may we not glory in anything that's given to us but let us glory in the Lord and the Lord I long to know that God places where he will that his will might be fulfilled he permits the famine he permits all for them to have to come and then for the news to break how they must have felt they had to go back to Daddy and they were gonna tell daddy hey we lied to you see they're repentant see there in the middle there in a measure of return we've lied to you your son Joseph is alive that's what was needed to cause Jacob to rise up but it wasn't Jacob that was rising up it was Israel that was rising up you with me when the wagons came down to get him the wagons were coming down from Egypt and the Bible didn't say Jacob got on the wagons it said Israel got on the wagons amen at the change of the body it will be that real you on the I on the inside that gets in the chariot look at this now I hope you don't mind this me reading it if you do too bad I believe that I believe these these words it was hard look at this it was hard for those Hebrew children down there in Egyptian bondage which had been blessed and given the fruit of the land the best place Goshen to find out that they had become slaves Goshen was the best was the choice part it was a choice part of the land they were living good lives in Goshen but then there was a king who knew not Joseph and although that the land itself was still a fertile land God allowed pressure to come that was turning there and they become slaves slaves by a mere change of law they become slaves are you with me the Bible tells us concerning this spirit to understand that there's two spirits that are working throughout this this earth Holy Spirit and the unholy spirit everywhere that you look the Catholic Church the Roman Catholic Church they we're not behind it they're lying the spirit that motivates them is the same spirit motivating the nations of the world and God permits motivations let me tell you let me say it like this you know how they'll do a release on a dam every once in a while and they'll let so much pressure go pressure mounts up and then they'll let so much go God permits those spirits to turn loose and permits those things to come even in the strength of which they're coming it's not him doing it it's God permitting it so it's God permitting hmm well let it come a little bit but God's not worried it's all working everything for his purpose this is where the scripture could say in Daniel 7 in speaking of that little horn of that fourth kingdom of this kingdom here it says he shall speak Daniel 7:25 he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the Most High what's these words he speaks blasphemy he breaks his name down into titles teaching for doctrines the commandments of men that's the take away you know what that that's that's taken away from the deity of Jesus Christ when he breaks it down entitles it it wants to come and attack Redemption God becoming one of us amen deity God coming and becoming one of to redeem us congrats it that's blasphemy to speak them titles you with me so whether we're the worlds that all dinner is this Trinity and this is one listen isn't it God said that's blasphemy I'm gonna go with what God said and I'm gonna go a little of the prophet of the sage said he said yes saith the Lord that Trinitarian doctrine is of the devil why it's a three cord prong seeking to bind people unto itself it doesn't release people in Liberty it binds them to doing this works and this works in this works it's a spirit of fear but the name of Jesus Christ is a strong and mighty tower that the righteous run into the name of Jesus Christ is the liberty of the Church of the Living God amen amen now that call upon the name of the Lord they shall be saved but this one right here see his cover is taken off this trace all the way through some cover we're out the Saints of the Most High and think to change times and laws in order to change times and laws he must be given preeminence they must be given parliamentary seats you miss me he's got to be given he's got to be granted this think of it how the Pope stood what was it two years ago stood right and address what the whole joint houses together that was only something new ho what a thing that's been done what a historic thing it already started way back there way back there but you think now you hear hear all of this is given premanande think to change times and laws for what what influence what purpose what is it behind and they shall be given unto his hand look at this they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and dividing of time he's not taking us just of his own accord he's being permitted God is permitting it whoa that gives me comfort God has it all in control oh my but here's the end of the story and the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his Dominion to consume and destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and Dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey Him notice this brother Bram talks about how that God would have to harden Pharaoh's heart and look he says he has to do this to put the people back in the promised land before he could bless them to bring forth the Messiah to them God had to allow that hardening God hardening in order to get them back in the land think of it if he manifested the promise of the Messiah outside of the land they would have been content to stay there this is why the word when God sent His Word in that resurrection sign here that word it goes forth it's called us out of Babylon it called us out and noticed calling us out and we're what has God been able to do and what is he able to do now as the Prophet said the bride must get out from that group of rejecters over into the promised land where the Messiah can be made manifest unto them what among believers Amen the Word of God that's maturing is the same word that's weeding out hey man God is moving God is working look at hold it III have that in the notes but I didn't put I didn't I don't have it here in front of me but just let me refer to that in revelation 17 the scripture I believe it's verse 25 it speaks of how that God hath put in the hearts of these kings these men that are law as kings with Bramson notice it says as Kings he said because they're not Kings they are dictators but they are giving power as kings where does their power come from from her how does she release that power it's permitted for her to release that where did Hitler get his authority to go it was the releasing of those spirits in revelations 9 is that right you look at many of the videos and things like that you look and see certain things look at Hitler that guy was a preacher man yes sir he took text and man that guy would preach and let me just say this when the Prophet talks about him fulfilling what Martin Luther said let me say this to you the heckler already had in his heart Hitler just took I took a situation took something and said it'll be good for me that'll fit in good with me Luther's respected among them that will fit in good with me and he went on are you with me it was already in his heart God allowed that to be said but here that was within his heart and he went on I wonder how many times were the prophets said certain things have to be said a certain way to throw some off are you with me friends but to see how that this is being fulfilled and how that the spirits God has permitted those spirits to move upon this of Hitler's heart to harden his heart and this was where I found to be astounding how did he have to harden Hitler's heart to be against a Jew when he was a half Jew himself it's a truth it was half Jew it was hardened against his own how could he have to do that like Stalin and Mussolini look what he says now people that's not inspired like a nation God has to take the things that are living by the laws of the land many times to make his promises come true people that are not inspired but we are inspired is not national pressure that's moving the bride no we are inspired God poured out his inspiration in this hour for this hour meaning it will come like a flood the Spirit of God has raised the standard against it the inspiration has been poured out what's needed for this hour to preserve you alive to keep you now and to practice away into glory God has delivered his word to us but the people that's not inspired God has to take laws of the land listen to me now let me just try to let me just try to hone in on this part here people that's not inspired like a nation God has to take the laws of the lands many time to make his promises come true he says they ask to harden those dictators hard to run the drew back to the promised land it had to be that way you're aware of this and I'm aware of this there's walls that's been laying on the book for years where they could come right against churches years it's been years remember one of the promises that Trump was making that he was going to undo a certain law that had been on the books where they could take your tax-exempt status and other things like this remember that were his promises upon there and this is look that was rallying the evangelical vote you say brother Simon what good would that do because they aren't people that's not inspired so what do they want yeah we gotta fight for our rights we gotta fight for this we gotta fight for this we have to fight for this they're not inspired but as the bride of Jesus Christ listen friends I'm not puffing us up I'm declaring what the Word of God has said concerning you and I our hope my hope is not in legislation my hope my trust is in the Lord lord have mercy if I thought about all the legislation what ever more I'd be a nutcase understand friends why do I want to keep up with all the legislation will really save me you want to do that so you're not a dummy so you're not an idiot well if this is being a dummy and in any of them let me alone but I want to be so occupied with the promise of God I don't want to be occupied with oh my goodness they're coming to get to this section and go straight oh my goodness they're coming in there's this this section knows it oh my goodness in Goshen right now they're letting a little little boys shower with little girls oh my goodness I don't want to be occupied with that not that I'm condoning it but I don't want my energy taken to where I'm all about that and my life is depleted spiritually and I'm left here because I got my eyes on the wrong thing Jesus has said when you begin to see these things come to pass your Redemption draws nigh so brother Samuel you're okay with it I didn't say I was okay with that what I said is that God had not anointed us to come under that we are a people that are inspired by the Holy Ghost in this hour look at friends the law some things that are changing and how things are moving around and you find things look there is a congealing the Prophet could look back there and talk about the World Council of Churches he could say he could scream out with such an urgency I've often wondered when the brother Brown stood there and he screamed out that way in this world is falling apart again I wonder what they must have thought brother bream even calls that I don't hate down in Shreveport the Spirit of God discerns their thoughts anything brother branham's our old cranks I think he's this the thing is that but you know it is a profit of seeing seeds let me just lay this in I'm not making the Martin Luther King thing thus saith the Lord coz brother Branham didn't but I do say this right here I do look at those things very closely because I studied what was he seeing that he said I have an opinion on I want to see what he's saying I hope you're all hope you're all right with that I'm not making it dust saith the Lord but I know he's seen something it's just like when brother Graham says when people have a problem with on 1977 you know I predict you know under divine inspiration what's wrong what's wrong with that statement you get inspired to and I have to and predicted things and thought things and yet we were under real true inspiration I think it was I think it was brother Lonnie mentioned years ago he said the reason is he said brother Brennan has made that statement he said because it was pitch black and he couldn't see anything beyond that time I'm not arguing with those statements to me I stand with it brother I mean how can you say when he said that's your opinion his opinion and you can say okay I'll take therefore opinion but I want to look and see how can you say that because God vindicated the wire he's revealed who it is to me this is Jesus Christ revealed to me the brand is not Jesus Christ but it's Christ revealed in his word that's simple cuz I'm it just saying like this I'll take his opinion any day over your opinion and I'll take it any day over my opinion if I had a mirror right now I'd say take that Oh glory well I gotta come down here tonight sometime man I'm getting there quit pulling now ha ha jessabelle religion in this message brother venom I didn't put it up here but let me read this part brother Ram talks about how Jezebel was the head behind the throne this is 61 she was the one that done the leading in this instrument these are not Bible stories there's the profit can look and say that was prophecy for right now prophecy for right now here we are we're living in the days of ahab and jezebel and the same one could say we are living in the days of his revealing himself unto Abraham in an Abrahamic age well then what happened miss Bible is not a book a book of stories this Bible has become alive to you and I we see well act blood revealing himself personally it's you and I looking in the word like Abraham sitting in front of the tent looking and they come you and I live that kind of a way setting there and looking for him because we by God's grace had been brought in tune and in sync with the angel of the Lord and we are looking for him brem says look how she took the very laws of the land and twisted them around I don't have time to show you this but remember when she wanted that vineyard they have one of the vineyard but he couldn't get it but she says we'll work some things around here what's she doing she's moving him he's looking at like this his own idea she's being moved by his spirit they're trying to do what take me bossed vineyard that's his inheritance Oh glory be to God that same Jezebel spirit has worked from the very beginning of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost to try to do what take away the real true birth of the Holy Ghost that is my inheritance they meant that have Christ in my life for him to be walking present in my life that is my inheritance amen this message that God has sent to us in this generation is the revealing of our inheritance [Music] absolutely but she worked with the different feast of Israel and those laws and she mixes it all together to call a feast and a fasting she's she's intertwining those things you would look at you think wait a minute oh no brother Samuel Jezebel when she stood up there she said there's a separation of church and state I read this week again more fully President Kennedy's speech that he gave to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association and aspra the purpose of that speech was to convince those men that I am NOT gonna side with Catholicism when I am elected no Catholic is gonna persuade me these are his statements I can email you the article they've exact transcript his whole thing is to try to take it and say I believe in a separation of church and state I believe in this there'll be no influence you know what brother Branham said concerning President Kennedy's election in condemnation by representation for the brem says for them he speaks he says how that the end brother Graham says the colored vote how that they gave that vote for for for Kennedy he's he likens it to that Sletten that that the slave spitting on Abraham Lincoln's garment he said what they did would be equivalent to me spitting on the blood of Jesus Christ that's a powerful statement because he said they don't know what this what they've done brother Bram takes a whole three quarters of the message condemnation by representation he's raised of giving announcement he says remember I told you last week pray before you go into the voting booths he said but look what the nation has done and when you read that transcript it sounds very much like it sounds like oh this guy's not gonna be he's not gonna be influenced by religion he's not gonna be influenced at all he's not it's a spirit the guy was suave and debonair and everything else that's exactly right but it was a spirit he could not help it let someone just think of this Oh God can I have just a few more moments I want you to look at this I want you to think of this the Prophet by inspiration is able to see this what's motivating Kennedy is that right but he's able to see it's a spear behind him to even to the place there where he could say no doubt he's a good man and when he was shot brother bream didn't say he got what was coming to him he never said that he said all that poor Widow oh did you see those children oh let's pray for them tonight this is the kind of character that brought the word in this hour where it was able to see wrong and you have to have the right kind of attitude towards it I say God my hands up in my heart of God help me Lord Jesus I see this when I look at that and the Prophet said how God uses the messenger that's an example of what he how he wants to use every believer that's what I'm focused on I'm not focused on that I'll have to see visions I have to do that that's not it I can see that that word brought a smile to maturity I could have that same expectation in my life Oh glory to God you love him the Prophet said like Israel and recognizing your day in its message back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there now you might say well brother Samuel if we talk to Israel today Israel remember what I was talking about this in 1963 Israel could say this and say this and say this but it's a mystery you say well bro same well they know that this happened this time in this but it's a mystery what started things moving walls were being changed things were being taken place and it was moving them turning their hearts do you realize right now you realize how many Jews are going back to the whole land yearly thousands you can look this up you can see that the the the clips right there fear of going back to their homeland there are still streams of Jews going back to the homeland you said brother Sam you talked about a thousand tooth no no I'm not talking about one or two thousand I'm talking about 30,000 50,000 these strings there's an act there there is after what took place remember when they were going in Yemen and here they were to fly those Jews from Yemen and flew him back into the homeland do you realize that the airline that flew them was an airline that was ready for bankruptcy that airline was on the verge of collapse you say what good would that be think about it if it had been an airline that would have we got it made we don't need to worry about that but God moved upon their hearts and they went down there and flew the mission they took the seats out of the plane loaded him onto the plane but you know what the Jews that were standing there they had ladders to get on the plane I don't mind to tell you I don't like getting on a high ladder myself I really don't but here they are and they're looking and I'm reading about these things the Jews were not gonna get on they were afraid but their rabbis spoke up at that time and so you remember he said that we will return on the wings of an eagle he caught this right here and they could say airplane but notice they were not questioning they moved the word was spoken at the right time they were in position it caused him to move and that airline now is a well-known airline Alaskan Airlines and its partners with other line there's many underneath it because of their simple obedience see God had to have him in a position of what humility I'm not calling the other airlines out but it could've been an airline sir we ain't doing that we're not doing this but God had an airline that was they were they were in a place of really to be humble and because they were willing to be obedient here they are how many airlines you know and I know where those airlines themselves over collaborate with this airline we go with merge with this airline well we're no longer gonna be operating a Cleveland now we're gonna how many of you know that many of them you understand what I'm saying all of these things even the mission that's flowing back in there it's a mystery but these things begin to turning bringing them back into the land she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place he says I'm gonna say something national force put Israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches see all these long when you see the evangelicals rallying a whole board this is good remember remember it's just like how things are taking place and even right now in Russia you know in Russia we just just received a report here that over there and in one in the in the st. Petersburg newspaper press they are forbidding the message to be preached until the court date of January not allowed to be preached Britta Simon what's gonna come out of this that's not for me to try to figure out all I want to do is walk faithful step by step by step by step just because that's happened doesn't give me a right tomorrow to sit down and eat whole cakes and pop-tarts and put my feet up and drink iced tea you understand we're gonna do them all get up and pray and study the Word of God and live for Jesus Christ and it might be within a moment in a twinkling and I I'll be changed you might be getting ready to hear you know on the keyboard and all of a sudden enter but there's another enters its come enter and you changed you're getting ready to put another another part on a code but there's another code that fully comes into place changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Oh glory you love him these powers are putting this the Council of Churches into place all these laws these things that's what I'm getting to is that within Russia the same thing in other places you can only be if you're recognized by the state there's a brother send me you mean to tell me that you think that the government is gonna force everybody to preach that it's permissible to allow homosexuality no I don't necessarily think that but I do believe that there could be a covering to where you must be in here if not in here and you're out there you can't do nothing you understand what I'm saying you have to be inside of here if you're outside of here your speech is not free see there's forces it's precious that's why the Prophet could say that has the scripture says in the I will keep thee in the hour of temptation really Bram could say there will be many who at that time will say we can serve the lord better in this system no no we serve the Lord by staying with him though all hell a sell me I shall not be moved is that right but the power of God would put the people in the bride and to you it's a mystery but it's a mystery now that is revealed to you how did God has brought you opened our eyes what is it it's God Himself by the power of God putting us in the right not our intellect oh because yeah I true this I didn't know no no because all the doctors are true no no no if I've met him and when I meet him then all the other doctrines will they find their place in my life and I find my place in them they become protection on the life in the tree maybe just a little of a background that how God is spoke to us tonight but a musician's if you come sometimes as we see this sometimes we don't see the things that are are taking place and sometimes we wonder where things are going on and bringing it down from here in that level bringing it down into our own lives that's that that's really my focus of where I'm coming to with all this right here we're just getting scratched but some of these these pressures some of these changes some of these things are taking place how even God will allow things to take place around you and I for what reason for what purpose that he might declare himself and that his word might be fulfilled he friends when we're talking about word being fulfilled we're not just talking about the final climax of all of this we're talking about his character in his life being being formed in our lives being shaped in the midst of our lives us being made ready i I don't know the day nor the hour but I know I'm living in a time I know that and the end and the urgency upon my heart and the urgency upon your heart and should be on your heart my heart is to be ready I want the word to examine me I wanted to examine my feelings addict my objectives I wanted to examine me thoroughly I don't want I don't want to walk in a place to say so unsold this or this they're done this was Saturday I don't want to walk in them places you understand what I'm saying I want we want to see Gordon molding and shaping you're not realize listen what I'm saying Fran is this is not so much about listing things it's God let my heart be so in tune with you to where I'm able to discern what's trying to work behind it and still be able to look at the veil and say you know what I love you still be able to look at the veil and say now you might not tell your boss I love you you may not do that I mean it just wouldn't be appropriate and some things like this but in your heart you could say I appreciate you you understand there's things that you that can come our way brother or sister or whatever more you say you know what thank you lord appreciate you sir brother say no this this bothers me so much but do you realize it isn't the person it isn't the thing it's God allowing us to see there's a part of agitation about life that he wants to minister and manifest his glory the sender how how is this I have this trouble I have this situation friends listen I can't explain these things I can't explain it I can't explain my own life you understand I can't explain that I can't explain God I can't explain me I'm talking about just me as a person I can't explain that but I know who has who's in control and like Joseph like I say can you say tonight Lord I don't know what's all come along but I know I'm a believer I know I'm a believer Lord and if I can have we can have that confidence then I can look to the Lord and say Lord all of these other things when you bring things to my attention it's not up to me to try to change them it's from me to you to pray over I want you to think of this if there are things that God made known to you I about our life and he does what if what if when we prayed about it the first little thing we notice I'm bothered about this and we praise O God I don't want this about my life and all of a sudden it's lifted and it's gone there wouldn't be any travail in our life but see that travail you know what that travail does for God God says listen to him they want to be so lined with my character and though you and I can't hear the conversation but even in the midst of that travail God's bragging God's bragging because for anybody else or any other person they would be content but God's bragging on you and I then when we come through that and finally when the release is coming or mine you can say lord thank you thank you lord sometimes when things comes it's just like when a favor rises up who knows not Joseph it's the beginning of the beginning then you find something else spirals something else and you find if we're not careful we find ourselves enslaved feelings attitudes thoughts we find ourselves enslaved but I believe tonight God has called us to stand fast in this glorious Liberty but Jesus Christ I don't know what tomorrow holds neither do you but I know who holds the future [Music] he's in control less sing that song he's got it all in control let's just sing this as a word of Prayer tonight he's got it all in control he's got it [Music] he's got it
