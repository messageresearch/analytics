TRANSCRIPT
========================================
strip give him everything you've got put everything into it don't hold anything back because and we're talking about a life here tonight that we our life has been touched and been affected by the life of sister Mary Sanchez I could go on as I thought about down through you know just my heart just thinking of these things as you know throughout the days you know and I thought about you know here are the different ones that's gone on that you know from from around us I thought of sister Joe thought of her and it all today and it hasn't been at times where there's not times that they're out of my mind to think about it I think of brother Carper sister Cara I think of sister Betsy I think of so many different ones it's not something you just forget about but there's things there moong with with with people that you you recognize that in their life they fought the battle and they overcame and there was a great testimony within their life that that same testimony it resonates to this day there's a purpose that was served and once the purpose itself is finished then God brings us home it brings us home and this is why the scripture would speak in this time and purpose knowing that even where you and I would be it wouldn't it would remind us there's a time to weep and a time to laugh there's a time to mourn and a time to dance when I look at that part within the scripture I want you to see this clearly that in every season the Lord is faithful in every time of our life when we look at even when you you you look over the patriarchs in the scripture you think of even how the scripture would have such an astounding writing of Sarah if Sarah would be mentioned even concerning that of Israel our mother he would be wrote there in the in in in in in the scriptures there in the book of Nehemiah it would rewrote in that way here was not only a patriot matriarch one who was a yielded vessel unto God and notice when they passed when when Sarah passed Abraham mourned are you with me when when Jacob passed Joseph mourned he they mourned as a matter of fact the Scriptures tell us here that in that the time of Egypt that they mourned threescore and ten days many days they mourned then when they got leave to take the bones of Jacob Joseph and his brethren took the bones of Jacob they come into a valley before the crossing and they mourn there and all of Egypt is struck they hear this morning and they say what a great person what a great thing this is for this morning that has taken place let me just say this to you right now Joseph and the rest were not mourning whereas those who sorrow without a hope they were mourning because where it was was a great patriarch their mourning was also in thankfulness for a life that had been lived among them a life that had been yielded to the Spirit of God just speak things within that time and let me just tell you there is a life right here when we talk about sister Mary Sanchez we're talking about a life that's been yielded to God absolutely but the summer you preach in the funeral right now no but I got a lot to say and I'm not gonna say it all tonight but there is a time of mourning all of that is necessary as believers we've not been lifted out of mourning we're not numb we feel that morning we feel that loss amen we feel that it's just like with with with with brother bill you know sometimes I'm just gonna say this because I'm just you know I'm just speaking right now to not like a father sometimes people they don't even know what to say when it comes to comfort people it'll be alright you'll get over it you'd have been better for you just to say praying for you you hear sometimes we and then listen you know it's just like within this hour you know we were not as believers we're not trying to be spiritual we're trying to be God in flesh to be able to reach out to one another and say I'm praying for you that God would strengthen you amen as the little boy was in the time of storm he's when his mama came up there and said you know we're all Christians he said I know that but he said in the time of the storm I need a God with skin on it hallelujah our comfort it comes from the Lord we feel loss and void in this life but yet our comfort it comes from the Lord when I say that our comfort comes from the Lord remember Paul said in the opening of Corinthians the God of all comfort who comforted us and he said the way that he comforted us he said who comforted us by the coming of Titus you see if we can be just as yielded vessels to one another you see this goes even beyond the situation's that even that we are presently dealing with as a congregation if we can be sensitive and say lord help me help me to get my eyes off of my little world now I'm not rebuking you better house understand I'm saying help me not to get so caught up in my own little world help me to look at the this is the Bible Philippians 2 look not every man on his own things but look every men on the things of others this is a mind of Christ Jesus was not occupied with what was best for him he came occupied with what was best for you and me I say God I want to live that kind of life I want to live that kind of life I want to be that more I want to be that much more sensitive and I'm not just talking about with your family I'm talking about the family of God because let me get real personal sometimes people will only visit their family they don't visit nobody else come on help me say man they don't men know where everything is about their family but you know what we are the family of God a man when one rejoice we rejoice with them when they one suffer we suffer with them I think you know the Lord Jesus when he reminded his disciples of his going away he told him he acknowledged that because of words remember he was letting him know what type of death he would die and the departure they didn't understand that but yet he told him because of these words in John 16 your hearts are filled with sorrow now I could tell you like this there's times when things like this will come down to it I remember my mom can tell you very clearly where my dad in in the last I won't just say last year but yeah mainly the last year and especially as it narrowed down into the last ten months or so he had many had questions that he was asking her will you be okay if I go standing at the door and looking out you see it's something about a believer there's things that sometimes you become aware now those things I'll be honest with you you say better say no what would you do during that time well I certainly don't sit down and start asking my dad what kind of what tell me what songs you want something at your funeral I don't want to talk about it what did you do brother Samuel changed the subject come on now let's just let's just be real and if you were one that want to talk about funeral I'll make sure you show them to the door you understand you see because these are things were not to be occupied with sure there's things to plan on we understand that but yet within it all is to be an encouragement and strength I don't want we didn't want to think of that we don't want to think of those times even when we see health and sickness and things failing we don't want to entertain those thoughts because as Christians we are not we are not built to entertain those thoughts it's not that we're denying realities of things that we see in front of us but there is a greater hope that we are looking for we are looking for any moment at any moment to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye our expectation is not death our expectation is the rapture he acknowledged that sorrow he acknowledged it yeah I said look he said sorrows filled your heart but the disciples I want you to think of this they were not in position to be able to see that life after death they were still as Paul would write subject by the fear of death it was the unknown man did not know that job inspiration came upon job the revelation struck Abraham even in his preparation for Sarah but you see within this time that light as Paul would write the light of immortality had not come to light because it could only come to light at after the death the burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and sending back that same life that stood there in that frail body and straightened its shoulder so shoulders and said Lazarus come forth when they looked at a situation and said it's beyond any hope he said but I am the resurrection and the life hallelujah the disciples they weren't in their position yet this is what he promised them he promised them that he would send the comforter unto them and he let him know your sorrow is going to be turned to joy and let him know I will see you again and the joy that you have no man will take from you now we know what that joy is he's talking about that joy is where he would reveal himself personally through his word by the baptism of the Holy Ghost where they could no longer take him away from them and they can no longer take them away from him they had now become United through him by the new birth there was a joy in the midst of their heart that was not determined by the circumstances we through were there times they were down absolutely you see this is part of the paradox and part of the mystery just because you see me down there you see somebody else down doesn't mean they don't have joy the joy and happiness these are two different things happiness and faith then those things can sometimes fluctuate but the joy of the Lord is our strength and David said the Lord is the strength of my life Jesus went to Calvary Hebrews chapter 12 he went to Calvary and endured the cross for the joy that was set before him what did he have a clear expectation it wasn't that Calvary was welcoming it was what came after it isn't that these things are welcomed death is a knell unwelcome to guests he's given us a joy that in the midst of these overwhelming moments we're in that were overwhelmed covered over with grief yet there's a joy because truly weeping it only endured for the night joy comes in the morning this rock that David's talking about when the hearts overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I this rock that David is speaking of is not the Rock of Gibraltar this rock is not even that of Mount Zion this rock is the person of Jesus Christ David would describe this rock in the scriptures that we read he would describe for thou hast been a shelter for me not will be thou has been the past testimony you've been a shelter for me in the time of storm I've been through storms in my life you've been my shelter I will dwell David said I will dwell in that Tabernacle he knew it to be a place of a bold a place that he could go to that's what this rock was a place a tabernacle a place that he could go to and find covered shelter under the wings you see when we look at the scripture think of it when the heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that's higher than I let me tell you this rock that's higher than I became low for the Bible said for such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens he was as the scripture said a man of sorrows acquainted with grief calamities things that would take place he was acquainted with them I'm glad if we've got a high priest like that I'm glad that we've got one that we don't use a prayer book for no vain repetitions we don't have to go and say well if I can just say the right words we can just say Lord my heart is overwhelmed I don't even know how and what to say I don't even know but you know you know what's going on you know what's what's covered over me like a gloom but I know that beyond this gloom and darkness you're still god you're still present and notice David's requests lead me to the rock that's higher than I can't get there on my own strength I need you to lead me to that place that's higher than me you know David was one that he had a testimony he said I do not occupy or X ourselves in myself in thoughts that are too high for me you know dave was saying those things I can't figure out not building bridges I trust you Lord how you're gonna get across when I get there he'll open up the way David said I'm not gonna exercise myself in thoughts too high for me this is the promise to us even as believers as it would write in Isaiah he shall dwell on high speaking of the upright of the believer his place of defense shall be in the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his water shall be sure it's a secret place with her spiritual food in due season it's a hiding place thine eyes this is the promise dwelling here thine eyes shall see the king and his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off you know something about it when you get up a little bit you can see further let me just say something a little carnal but maybe it'll help you the past couple of years I've hunted out a deer blind it's been alright because I don't have to worry about if I fall asleep falling out of a stand I like it because I can't act much my thermos in there with coffee and drink it sometimes get away with movement but you know what the problem is I can't see very far I like being up in a tree the higher up even though I hate Heights but I'd rather be up higher because I can see them coming in your angle of being able to see them is greater if something about being lifted up where you have a greater sight of what is approaching you you when you get lifted up you see more of everything that's laid out you know with you just looking at this land and the layout of this land of how it is if you you know you know how it is if you you get up there and you pull down Google's Earth or whatever more and you look at the layout of like your oh that's how that lays in there oh that's how the Black River runs oh this is how all this comes through here you see when you get lifted up you see things you see things that you didn't see before there's a different perspective now we understand that the devil likes to use Heights but he'll try to use Heights to show you positive points he took the D took Jesus up into the mountains this is why Paul would have the testimony of the binding of his life that neither height nor depth shall separate us from the love of God I don't care if you take me up and show me all the good points nothing will separate me from the love of God but we realize that there are Heights that belong to a believer there are Heights that belong to a believer that we know as heavenly places it's that where we're able to not on our own strength get there but by his sovereign grace he will take us there that were able to look into that land that looked so far off but yet that land is right here with us tonight were able as he lifts us up this is where that you know that David would also ride in the chapter that followed Psalm 61 and he would write of this rock and and say concerning the Lord and how that he was waiting on the Lord he would say he only is my rock and my salvation not my job not my mama not my daddy not my pastor he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved David would write that again and then David would would go on and you those of you as you're listening to the message you know that this this bank of scriptures of Psalm 62 is the very text that the Prophet would be inspired to take when he spilt spoke the message Shalom in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength my refuge is in God somes 27 which is the background brother branham would call it like this and on the wings of us know what does he said I want to preach on the the message on the conditions of the rapture he would call Psalms 27 in the message the rapture during reading the text the background for the rapture you know background is an important thing you can hear a story but when you hear the background of it gives a little bit more it gives more of a significance to it when you know the background look for example if you did not know the background even of the early ages and when we stand on the other side and you shake you shake hands and they they say you know I'm per petunia or I'm you know I was Paul or a Silas you know you would say you know or some of the others let me just say some of them who had come out that are there in the Moore and martyr ology and different ones who gave their life who are just mentioned in Hebrews 11 and yet we don't have their name but yet when you would shake their hand and they say yeah I came out you know of the age of Ephesus or I came out of the age of Pergamus and we could say oh okay wow that was a that's tremendous thing but when you know the background of what was taking place during that time then you look at that life a whole lot differently because you realized there was a triumph there was an overcoming that where they were right in the midst of where the enemy was attacking but yet the life of God inside of them as they were yielded to God it prevailed and overcame and they had a testimony that they left not their lives unto death they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony the background on something it has such a significant impact David's declaration the Lord is my salvation he's the light of my life who shall I be afraid of what shall I fear David said though a host and camp around about me though I'm besieged all around here's what David said though a host they rose up to consume my flesh but they stumbled and fail and he comes into a place and he's making this declaration known one thing have I desired and that's what I'm gonna seek after his desire was so illuminated in his heart it put his life in motion this is what he sought for I want to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life I want to dwell under his abode I want to be in his leading and in his will I want to know what his choices are for my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock lead me to the rock that's higher than I when my heart is overwhelmed will lead me to the rock that's higher than I and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me you see it moves from where we're just looking at things sometimes we're looking at it in look we're looking at it here almost in eye level and all what we see all around us we see the problem we see the grief we feel all of them are you with me this is where we need the help of the Lord this is where as David said attend unto my prayer Lord when my heart is overwhelmed lead me Lord I can't get there alone I need you to leave me there leave me to the rock that is higher than I I can't scale it and get there on my own I need you to lead me there Lord take me to the rock that's higher than I and as he'll bring us to that rock remember it's like that where as David would write in my head now is lifted up above mine enemies it's that same rock you know that Moses was bidden of the Lord there's a place by me come stand right here and when you stand right here then God covered him over in the cleft of the rock it was a place where God could put his hand cover over and Moses when he walked past he seen behind ur parts of a man it was in that place to think of it in that place where he would see how God was going to come down in flesh an answer to a question it was a place this is the same place where Moses stood and God let Moses know Moses said remember remember there were things that God said Moses because you did this you're not coming in the land is that right but God allowed him God said come up I want to show you this land he didn't have to show him that land but he said I want to show you this left he took him up on the mountain and he's shown in the land the law could never take him into that land but the sovereign grace of God when we read there of Mount Transfiguration we find that witness of Elijah and Moses are there what brought Moses there not his own works grace he was able to look across into that land but it would be grace that would bring him there that's embraced by God's sovereignty that same grace has took a hold in the bosom of our heart grace grace that brought deliverance to a captive grace that came for one who was shackled and has been made free one who did not know well who they were what they were but grace has let us know you are my son you are my daughter I've always loved you I sought you out what did that grace and that same grace that has taught our heart to fear that same grace of God has put within our heart that hope that expectation that know we walk in this life but yet our eyes have been anointed we are not living for this life we are living for the other side hallelujah we have within our life the grace of God the love of God's Word has spoke to our hearts and Willie said Lord how can I get fair Joshua steps in grace comes on the scene and say I will place you your position in the land though you do not deserve it but my grace will lift you up into that place therefore because my head's been lifted up he's he has put me up above my enemies I can see you know what he's saying he didn't say that the enemies weren't there he said I'll see victory I see victory this is not this right here it's not a defining of who I am it's not the finality my head has been lifted up because he has set me up upon a rock in the secret of his Tabernacle therefore will I sing songs of joy I will sing praises unto God sacrifices of joy amid say you know what a sacrifice is right sacrifice you say well that's something you give but remember God don't want anything that's lame Alton halt and blind and God wants the best that's why when they would offer the sacrifices remember they had to take out there's certain sacrifices they would take out and they would lay the fat they would lay the heart God wants the innermost part of our life the choicest parts he wants it all brother Bryan said it and it's right I'm thinking about this throughout the day I'll tell you truly sister Mary gave sacrifices of joy I missed tonight not shaking her hand when I came down that hallway sometimes since brother Richard and brother Carlos and things they been able to take out that other booth over there sister Mary now had been able to come in and sit over there so sometimes I didn't shake her hand there but I would catch it here then you'd find other times she wasn't here now you know if sister Mary wasn't here something is wrong so you didn't let me just meet just kind of capitalize on that that's the kind of Christians we want to be if you're not here you're missed now you're missed but I want you understand if you're not here you don't want it to be what no pie when I went unnoticed you want yourself not that you're trying to stand out you want to be ineffectual life and that effectual life isn't us doing something it's just being surrendered to the Lord now you know I'm not giving anybody a rose after they're gone without God by His grace allowed us to give roses before but she was singing sacrifices of joy I know she was sitting there attack she was in pain I'd ask her sister Mary before coming out to3 how you feeling I'm doing good I'm doing good many times I wouldn't want to scare I just would come and I just touch her on the shoulder I'd stand there minute touch her because she was even if she was out there she was her eyes be closed her hands she'd be out there you know familiar thank you Jesus out here can I hear that down that hallway thank you Jesus I'd hear that familiar how she said hallelujah when the spirit would strike her there was no mistake in her joy and her delight in the Lord she took refuge in the Lord many times you think about it even in prayer meeting times brother bill would be here virus by himself time sister Mary would be able to be here every times on Thursday or Sunday maybe a brother Bill have to take her back home as you know sickness and and things were you know moving in her body that sister Mary one haven't and brother not brother bill won't gonna stay home anyhow but they they weren't having it's just these are things that I want you to understand these are things we were gonna say Lord let it be so determined in my heart we're not we're not putting people up on pedestals but I'm just I'm just saying it like this God is still God these things that even after we brought him up here and we said what we said they never asked for that I knew the potential me doing that I could get skinned alive but those are things that needed to be known now we're not trying to be like nobody else we're not trying to feel nobody's shoes cuz you can't the only thing you can do which is means that's such a glorious thing is let the love of God just flow through your life and you know as you let that flow through your life God unfolds to you what he wants you to do when there was one particular song that I remember when it would be sung but the bill would sing it and sometimes where the Brian would sing it a mansion over the hilltop sister Mary could have had the worst day that would set it would just set it off right there she was right there you soon as they would start playing and start singing a mansion over the hilltop right there she worshiped through every stanza of that song if I know what I'm talking about because it wasn't just a song to her she wasn't just singing lyrics she knew she knew where she was where she was going the body that that she was in she felt the aches and pains and everything but you know what she knew she had a promise knowing what in silver land it was better than that it was a body that God had prepared for her she knew that when it come down to that moment it's just a step from here over there because she had already been walking with God and had a testimony before him that she pleased the Lord so she had a mansion over the hilltop she had a mansion that Jesus had promised if I go away I will prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you but I will come again and I will receive you unto myself she had a promise in her heart she had a witness in her exceedingly that promise was a reality I'd say it she had a witness in her heart of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the message of the hour had revealed him to her he never revealed him to be a second person or a third person or to just one of them it revealed that redemptive work that she was included in Redemption clear back before the foundation of the world so the sacrifices of joy was because there was a peace there was an abstract there was a token there was a comfort that had come that no matter what I'm going through that God the same God that has brought me this far will see me through the rest of the way she had the atonement of his life that was within the blood had moved into her soul she know she knew the passage has been paid see this is with the things that it makes it so easy because you know for a believer you have to preach a funeral their life has already breached it their life has already breached their funeral that's why we understand clearly that no matter what a man says the pastor in whatever more you know I hadn't been to a lot of funerals where there had been somebody else doing the service maybe my wife can't help me maybe there'd been some but you know I hadn't been through a lot you know but sometimes of different ones you come into and you come into situations and you can hear people who when people start talking about this one or whatever more and people are like who's he talking about because no pastor can put you there nobody can put you there only God can bring you there amen we don't know where our desire as a believer we don't want deathbed confessions thank God for what happened there on Calvary with with that of the feet that was on his right but remember God's desire is that our life would be lived fully for him think of one of the admonitions where Paul would speak concerning to us as believers that one of these days he said to speak of how that he Paul would call death write out death where is thy sting o grave where is that victory he would let it be known that this mortality shall put on immortality he let us know of the coming expectation in the closing verse of 1st Corinthians 15 he would let us know how to conduct ourselves while you are waiting abound in the work of the Lord if I could say it like brother bill would say it go forward go truly we we are gonna miss sister Mary I say gone oh we already do but we we miss her and I certainly think God you know God has things arranged just in his time God knew even if things I've watched this over the years in the assembly while God has things arranged just in his time and how things can be prepared there's a transition that's coming God prepares someone to be able to step up all these things it's God because it's God's economy it's God at work and you know the things that we we see here is we sorrow but we're sorrowing not as others that have no hope and with these words these are the words that were to comfort one another with these words and they just say this to you the comfort of these words is not necessarily for us to go up to one another and quote these passages of scripture the comfort of these words is to have that life to have that presence to have the reality of 1st Thessalonians 4 the rapture burning in our bosom and so when we go to express a word and say I'm praying for you we're not quoting 1st Thessalonians 4 we are the manifestation of 1st Thessalonians 4 it's to comfort one another and I think of this you know with brother bill and sister Mary I I so thank God that brother bill was able when the Lord seen fit for him to retire they were always the in sister Mary just I'd say it's so complementary to one another and I said you know I said the other night I said I think God for these years I couldn't remember how many years or brother bill had been retired I said you you all just grow even thicker together I mean they were pardon my saying is thicker than molasses I mean it would just I mean you know it was just little things you know I tease sister Mary and once in a while so sister Mary do you need me come and get brother bill so you can get a rest you know and and you know do you need it because brother bill times would like to go with me when it came to get brothers from overseas or he traveled with brother Richard brother brother bill he he loved doing he still does both of brother Bill and sister Mary could say this about them they have they have servant hearts and they're that sister Mary's already got her reward of a crown of righteousness a new body but I was just telling the Lord here today I said lord I can't wait to stand there on that day and I hear the other crowns that are given out to them the other rewards because we will be rewarded we're not doing it for rewards but to think of that of crowns that'll be throughout the scriptures that are mention of those other crowns and I think of how that you know with with sister Mary you know she her and brother bill just such a a love and such an example you know sister Mary was she was such an example I believe right here among us when there were things that come up and those of you you sisters could you could say a man to this there were times where she didn't ask you oh do you think you could make no you make this you make this and you make this you with me that's needed she would say that you make this you make this you make that and there were things that would be be ordered in that burden that that that she would have for the people and the Assembly of God through her she's a very detailed person she's sister Mary was one that you know as I have had different reports that's come in she always asking about the family different ones you know those of you that had children and things like that should ask you about your children she keeps up with those children sister Mary was a grandma to every child here she acted like it she was proud of all the different accomplishments and things like that i just i'd say i'd take take it out of this right here take out of this right here what you seen within her life i believe is an expression it's like a flower it was an expression that helps you and i see god helped me to also be interested in your body help me to ask others instead of saying you know what I had the worst day today I'll tell you I had no help me say fella Matthew how you doing today let's do 2 by the time we hang up but the man's like man I know he that guy had a bad day today lord help me these are scriptural principles here and I say tonight that within this right here I so thank God for brother bill and sister Mary I could go on and on because there's so many different scriptures that I think of when I think of sister Mary's life her and brother bill together and they truly were value to this assembly I believe I can safely say this I know that the Lord started this work I know that God called my you called my daddy and used my daddy here instrumentally but I can say this very clearly if it hadn't been for brother bill and sister Mary and different ones like brother herb and sister Joe and different ones that stood as pillars in this assembly and some of us as a young ones and different ones like that if you don't know their testimony when we get the next fellowship or you get the next time pull yourself up under that oak tree over there known as brother herb pull yourself up under the oak tree called brother bill pull yourself up under some of these oak trees and ask him say how was it because there's a testimony we benefit of the labors in the journey thank God for lives that have gone before us they've lived their time they've lived their testimony and they they have fought the good fight of faith I think God would still have the different ones here with us brother her brother Bill and I think of all the different ones and if I forget somebody please it's not it's just my mind my memory you forgive me as they said it's not Alzheimer's it's called some timers when you're young but I mean with all of our heart that for every one of us let our hearts be like that of Paul what would you have me do and the first thing God did for Paul was fill him up then when God filled him up then God God was going to answer this call this is what I want you to do for me it's the greatest greatest privilege and I say tonight that yes our heart is overwhelmed brother bill that's his sweetheart his wife I can't I can't even enter in to try to imagine how that would be but I know because I said that love that was so so thick that was so real that was between them and brother bill will need our prayer and our support I'll tell you you know how he's been at the door he's called brother bill brother bill didn't need a title to do nothing he did it as unto the Lord brother bill never said well I'm not a pastor I'm not a deacon so I can't call nobody no he called you if he don't see you sitting around in here he wondered where yet he called you I miss you miss seeing you same thing with sister Mary and these are things that when we look at they're gonna need they're gonna need that now from us and I'm gonna just say it very purposely not all at once but as the week's unfold as the months unfold I know God gives strength and grace I witnessed it just from my when my dad's passing God gave us strength and I when I set up on the side of the bed that morning a couple days after I said I told my wife I said this is the prayers of the people because I have touched I don't know how to describe it I felt strengthened the salmon were you sorrowful I was but I felt strengthened it didn't mean that waves didn't come sometimes waves came at odd times sometimes they would come at times right before I was you know getting ready to entertain maybe a service and I'd have to just say lord help my eyes help my but you know God is faithful because we hadn't lost sister Mary brother bill knows he and lost sister Mary right there when we were gathered there in that room yesterday we watched a saint go home to glory they were called to rest from their labor and no wonder the scripture would say precious in the side of the Lord is the death of his Saints because God had brought that masterpiece to appoint the purpose and brother Brennan said like any artist or any composer they don't bring it to that and then just do away with it he said they take it and they put it out may God comfort our hearts as well as an assembly brother rich in sister Maria and not just them but as an assembly with this even the passing of Liliana this has been very close for us it reminds me of the year where my dad and sister Betts and sister Betsy it was it was a time that was that was less than a month and a half and two went on home to be with the Lord may God he'll give us the strength our heart is overwhelmed the Lord lead me to the rock that's higher than I you might have a situation in your life right now in your heart is overwhelmed but just ask
