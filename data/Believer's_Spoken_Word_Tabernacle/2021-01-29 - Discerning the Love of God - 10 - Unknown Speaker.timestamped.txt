[32:11] control
[32:13] in the service we pray for the glory of
[32:15] god
[32:16] in jesus name amen and amen
[32:20] amen if we'll turn in our bibles there
[32:22] to first corinthians
[32:24] chapter 13 and verse 4 and we want to
[32:28] just
[32:29] move back back into this of what we've
[32:31] been looking at and
[32:37] sometimes as you're looking at things
[32:39] you look at it
[32:40] you know don't know of a service
[32:43] maybe one point how it'll come out maybe
[32:46] it'll be a service
[32:47] maybe it'd be multiple services you
[32:49] don't know but
[32:51] we want to just continue to look at a
[32:53] portion here in this verse 4 here
[32:55] tonight
[32:58] just just moving a little bit further
[33:01] in that part here verse 4 it says
[33:06] charity suffereth long and is kind and
[33:09] we we've looked at that
[33:10] it's very it's patient charity
[33:13] envy it's not charity bonnet
[33:16] not itself is not
[33:20] up when we looked at this i've
[33:23] read this
[33:24] over and over and i want to just
[33:25] continue tonight we may get a little
[33:27] beyond this i don't know
[33:29] but i want to look at that second part
[33:31] there with charity envy if not
[33:33] and as it says here in the amplified
[33:36] bible
[33:37] love never is envious
[33:41] nor boils over with jealousy
[33:45] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[33:47] of the word as you're being seated
[33:52] truly when we look here and we look into
[33:56] the word of god there's not
[33:58] there's not one of us as our as a
[34:00] believer and as a child of god that when
[34:02] we come to hear the word of the lord
[34:05] that we don't desire and don't long to
[34:08] be more like him
[34:10] you know brother branham would put it in
[34:12] the message a statue of a perfect man
[34:14] and he would speak of
[34:16] many veterans that were even sitting
[34:17] there along with himself
[34:19] and he would reiterate those words that
[34:22] there's always a desire
[34:24] to go deeper there's always a desire to
[34:26] live closer
[34:27] and we we want the word as we've been
[34:30] looking at it we want the word to
[34:32] examine
[34:33] our lives as we see paul he dealt with
[34:36] we dealt with this where a corinthian
[34:39] church they had
[34:40] many supernatural things that were
[34:42] taking place
[34:43] they had they had the gifts in their
[34:46] midst
[34:47] and the gifts the nine spiritual gifts
[34:49] along with the five
[34:50] ministerial it should be in every local
[34:52] assembly
[34:53] but paul was very very cautious that
[34:56] that the people not only those who were
[34:59] there those who had come along
[35:01] but also even as there would have been
[35:04] uh undoubtedly
[35:05] uh others who had come into the fold and
[35:08] paul was very mindful to put them that
[35:11] the very
[35:12] key uh of a whole christian life
[35:16] is that of the love of god and we know
[35:19] that the love of god
[35:21] it's not a thing but it is the person
[35:25] and the love of god it is the holy ghost
[35:29] and we know that we cannot as we look in
[35:31] the scriptures
[35:32] we cannot have the love of the world
[35:35] and the love of the father at the same
[35:37] time
[35:39] so god as he deals with our life
[35:43] we we come into these places as we look
[35:46] and examine
[35:47] in our lives being examined by the word
[35:50] of god and looking at love
[35:53] and how that love is to operate and i
[35:55] just want to say it in this manner that
[35:58] love itself is not it's not an emotion
[36:02] love itself is is not just it's not just
[36:06] limited to a feeling but
[36:09] love itself is a is a person
[36:12] and love itself it is also a decision
[36:16] that a person makes it's not only a
[36:19] decision that you make but it's also
[36:21] that which is really part of the
[36:24] covenant
[36:24] like you have a covenant within your
[36:26] marriage there's decisions then
[36:29] that you make you could take certain
[36:31] angles you could take certain directions
[36:33] because
[36:34] as i'm speaking to those of you who are
[36:36] married
[36:37] ben and whatever more you you know and
[36:39] understand there are times that you
[36:41] don't
[36:41] have all of that happy tick ticky bubbly
[36:45] smooth fuzzy wuzzy feelings and
[36:47] everything else sometimes you
[36:49] have the things that you want to say but
[36:52] you recognize wait a minute there's a
[36:54] choice
[36:55] within this covenant and so there's
[36:57] always a choice that is always set
[37:00] before us and what we desire is
[37:03] that our choices and our lives would be
[37:06] so
[37:06] under the influence of the holy spirit
[37:09] we'd never want to take that for granted
[37:11] we don't take that the more and more
[37:14] even the longer that we walk with god
[37:16] the less that we
[37:17] we we should take for granted the less
[37:20] and we should be
[37:21] even that more more aware that god
[37:24] in every aspect of my life i want to be
[37:27] under the influence of the holy spirit
[37:30] that is simply even where we're
[37:32] listening to the word you're doing your
[37:33] devotion
[37:34] you're praying and i'm not and i'm not
[37:36] even saying to where that
[37:37] i believe that we have time alone in
[37:40] prayer with god but i'm talking about
[37:41] even as you
[37:42] sense things that can be coming up
[37:44] feelings or you're feeling a certain way
[37:46] but you're very mindful to know that
[37:48] lord
[37:49] i need your governance right now i want
[37:51] to bring this subject lord i don't want
[37:53] to let this
[37:54] reign and keep on going and moving
[37:57] around i want to bring it lord subject
[37:59] to the word i want to be under your
[38:00] influence and i
[38:02] i know i'm speaking to believers tonight
[38:04] that have this same witness that
[38:06] sometimes you don't even recognize that
[38:08] even when you're listening to the
[38:10] message you're reading in the scripture
[38:12] or even while we're sitting here and
[38:13] where the words being preached
[38:15] you have no sometimes even any real
[38:18] awareness but the holy spirit is coming
[38:21] with such a divine
[38:22] influence to bring such a separation
[38:26] and to really to empower our lives god
[38:28] knows even what's ahead of us
[38:31] even when we get out of service he knows
[38:33] what's ahead of us
[38:34] even tomorrow god knows all these things
[38:37] and this
[38:37] is why that even when we're feeding and
[38:40] to
[38:40] be a real feeder on the word we're not
[38:43] it's not so much that i'm trying to
[38:45] retain
[38:46] everything in my mind but it's to give
[38:49] myself and allow the holy spirit to sow
[38:52] just let him saturate your life so then
[38:55] there he's the one who's ever present to
[38:57] guide you
[38:58] when something comes up you you are
[39:01] prepared
[39:02] by him i think how brother branham said
[39:05] i've just been listening going over the
[39:06] adoption series this week
[39:08] and brother brown says sanctify yourself
[39:11] he said when you would go to speak to
[39:13] that person that maybe has done you
[39:15] wrong or this or they said
[39:16] sanctify yourself now he's pulling that
[39:18] from the scripture
[39:19] jesus said i sanctify myself for their
[39:22] sake he said
[39:23] sanctify yourself for you know not what
[39:25] you might say to that person
[39:28] you see it's the in in a part of
[39:31] adoption as a son and daughter of god
[39:33] you recognize as a son and daughter of
[39:36] god that's been born of the spirit of
[39:38] god
[39:38] you realize that this guy is not perfect
[39:41] but there is a perfection on the inside
[39:43] of a son and daughter of god
[39:45] that works to bring this guy in
[39:48] subjection
[39:49] and there's a growing there's a maturing
[39:51] within our life
[39:53] that takes place by experiences buy
[39:55] trials
[39:56] buy tests buy all of these things
[39:58] brother brandon simply put it you more
[40:00] he says the things that happen
[40:07] what happened but give him a monitor's
[40:08] back
[40:10] so the somebody says something about us
[40:13] and they might say something wrong
[40:15] brother braham said it just this simple
[40:16] and it is the rising of the sun he said
[40:19] that's where we get
[40:20] more love love itself when we look at
[40:24] these
[40:25] when we look even at these attributes
[40:27] that's in here
[40:28] these are these are attributes of that
[40:31] of the love of god
[40:32] that come on display in the midst
[40:36] of times of adversity or if i can say it
[40:40] when it doesn't rub us just exactly the
[40:43] right way
[40:44] and the us i'm talking about is not the
[40:46] son and daughter of god on the inside
[40:49] i'm still talking about that carnal part
[40:52] that we bring in subjection so this is
[40:56] where
[40:57] i want to just just take here and just
[40:59] try to
[41:00] if the lord will help us just bring this
[41:01] together tonight
[41:03] we we were looking at this part on the
[41:05] outside because
[41:06] not only are we dealing with those who
[41:09] are
[41:10] around us workplace and on and on and on
[41:13] that are not even
[41:14] at present time even within the economy
[41:17] of god as far as
[41:19] within maybe the local body or within uh
[41:22] the kingdom of god but yet we even in
[41:25] ourselves
[41:26] have have a way that we are to really to
[41:29] be an example
[41:30] and it's not something that we to have
[41:32] up here oh i'm to be an example
[41:34] sometimes you may have to be reminded
[41:36] hey you know you're supposed to be an
[41:37] example
[41:38] but to recognize that there is there is
[41:41] a light that shines within us paul would
[41:43] write it like this in the book of
[41:45] philippians
[41:46] that in the midst of a crooked and
[41:49] perverse
[41:50] generation among whom
[41:53] ye shine as lights
[41:56] so the only way you can shine it's with
[41:58] a real brightness
[41:59] it shows the darkness of the crookedness
[42:02] and the perverseness that is all around
[42:05] us but
[42:06] let our lives be a testimony that is
[42:08] that of a beacon of hope it's a light
[42:11] that's able to point someone in the
[42:13] right place because
[42:15] people don't want religion and i don't
[42:17] blame them i don't want it either
[42:19] people don't want to just come to you
[42:21] know church i hear brother branham
[42:22] even today is listening to the message
[42:24] and brother brahms is kind of going
[42:26] through the account of gabe you know the
[42:27] one who saw the
[42:29] sunrise and the or the sunset and he
[42:31] made his uh
[42:33] surrender to the lord and remember he
[42:35] said i'm not going to that church down
[42:36] there's a bunch of hypocrites brother
[42:38] brahman says you're even worse than the
[42:39] hypocrites that are going because you're
[42:40] not even making a stand
[42:42] you see people people seen all this
[42:44] they've seen they've seen
[42:46] hypocrisy they a religion in church and
[42:48] whatever more
[42:49] this is why brother brahms said even
[42:51] communism has rose up because of the
[42:53] hypocrisy of the church
[42:55] so we recognize that in these things
[42:59] uh proverbs 24 1 i just want to deal
[43:02] just a little bit here with the outside
[43:04] then we come in
[43:05] in into the body and he says in proverbs
[43:08] 24 1
[43:09] be not thou envious against evil men
[43:13] neither to neither desire to be with
[43:17] them
[43:17] for their heart studieth destruction
[43:21] and their lips talk of mischief
[43:25] see this is who they are this is what
[43:27] they're about
[43:28] don't be envious of them their constant
[43:31] meditation and musing is
[43:33] i it's tiny's destruction verse 19 in
[43:37] the same chapter
[43:38] very very very fitting here in the midst
[43:41] of this chapter
[43:42] it tells you not what it tells you do
[43:44] not be envious
[43:45] then it takes verses and it deals with a
[43:48] wise man
[43:49] a wise man you know and how wisdom
[43:51] buildeth her house and
[43:52] it goes through all this then it breaks
[43:54] back forward now it breaks again in
[43:56] upon that of envy and it says in verse
[43:58] 19
[43:59] fret not thyself because of evil men
[44:03] neither be thou envious at the wicked
[44:07] now god is never in his word these
[44:09] things that he speaks to us
[44:11] he's never it's never implied that this
[44:14] is just something that
[44:15] ah it's no problem for a believer ah
[44:18] it's no problem you know it's just
[44:20] no he's this is the word and remember
[44:23] the word
[44:23] always calls us in the midst of a
[44:26] situation
[44:27] of dying to ourselves because what it is
[44:30] is that there's a part that could you
[44:33] know go in this direction
[44:34] but now in love this is where the love
[44:37] of god comes in
[44:39] is our love is first and foremost to god
[44:43] and if we've got that in the right place
[44:45] then we'll have love
[44:46] in the right respects for others even
[44:49] that of
[44:50] evil men wicked men because the
[44:52] scriptures are true
[44:54] we're not just to be like the publicans
[44:56] or the pharisees
[44:57] they love the guys who love them is that
[45:00] right
[45:00] jesus said no be you therefore perfect
[45:03] as you're even as your father in heaven
[45:05] is perfect
[45:06] he's talking about the perfection of
[45:09] that life
[45:10] being inside of us so this admonition
[45:13] it says neither be thou envious at the
[45:16] wicked men
[45:17] for there shall be no reward to the evil
[45:20] man
[45:21] the candle of the wicked shall be put
[45:22] out every one of us
[45:24] and no matter what parts of life uh
[45:27] sometimes
[45:28] you ha you come in contact and you you
[45:31] you have to deal
[45:32] with people of the world and you you rub
[45:35] shoulders with people of the world it
[45:38] say
[45:39] in disregards it's like a smoke that's
[45:42] out there that's
[45:43] that's that's the devils that's the
[45:45] demons that's out there
[45:46] and just as you are influenced by the
[45:49] holy ghost
[45:50] remember there's an influence there as
[45:52] well satan is always he's always trying
[45:55] he's
[45:55] there to influence them and trying to
[45:58] lay a trap
[45:59] and so forth for you but let me just say
[46:01] in this time
[46:03] we want to make sure we're not caught in
[46:05] their web
[46:08] the bible says return evil with good
[46:13] pray for them who despitefully use you
[46:18] sometimes those are easier to quote when
[46:20] you're not going through that
[46:23] but when you're going through it then
[46:24] that's where the rubber meets the road
[46:27] see god knew those things that's a part
[46:29] of the dying that's a part
[46:31] where of bringing that flesh subject
[46:34] that
[46:35] that man's subject to the word you see
[46:37] these are things that even
[46:39] in the world i think as i look back and
[46:42] brother branham is dealing with things
[46:44] uh incurred exodus and who do you say
[46:46] this is in 1964
[46:49] and throughout the message he's dealing
[46:50] with things where
[46:52] you find that communistic spirit moving
[46:54] in of
[46:55] integration and all those things and
[46:57] brother adam he deals with it
[46:59] not only on a level between races but
[47:01] then he ties it into the ecclesiastical
[47:04] realm
[47:05] and who do you say this is and third
[47:07] exodus and he's dealing because remember
[47:08] the lambda came up had two horns
[47:11] civil and ecclesiastical you see these
[47:13] things don't work separately
[47:15] they work they work intertwined in a
[47:17] measure
[47:18] and so what everything that you know as
[47:21] it begin to deal you see even the things
[47:24] that
[47:24] you know brother brandon made this
[47:25] statement he said if they were slaves he
[47:27] said i'd be down there fighting as well
[47:29] but then he refers to the black minister
[47:31] who got up and he told the people he
[47:33] says i'm ashamed of you
[47:35] because he says you have better schools
[47:39] than what they have but you see what it
[47:41] is it's not the people
[47:43] it's a spirit that came in to stir up
[47:46] division
[47:47] for what purpose listen to me now to
[47:49] take
[47:50] the focus off what is really the most
[47:53] important
[47:54] and brother brand tells us in the third
[47:56] exodus that's the new birth
[47:59] that they would be that they would come
[48:02] to that place because you see you say
[48:04] well how could that hinder because god
[48:06] remember even as we started on sunday
[48:08] looking at
[48:09] the holy spirit will not come to a
[48:11] temple
[48:12] that's harboring those things in its
[48:14] life you see this is something that goes
[48:17] beyond
[48:17] it's out there in the spirit realm of
[48:19] how satan himself
[48:21] he's a strategist he works in a manner
[48:23] to try to place these things in
[48:26] to sow division to sow hatred and let me
[48:29] bring it down to you and i where we're
[48:30] at right now
[48:32] we're in a time these are things that's
[48:34] been going on now
[48:35] for years and some of the articles and
[48:38] things that i
[48:38] went back and just just thinking of some
[48:40] of these things
[48:41] and i went back to even certain things
[48:44] even back there in 2015 and it's
[48:46] even further back there and it deals
[48:49] with algorithms and things that are on
[48:51] the internet
[48:52] to where you look at one thing and there
[48:54] might be an
[48:55] article that you're reading and then
[48:57] you'll find what it does is
[48:59] then algorithm is to try to predict
[49:02] your thought pattern and gauge you to
[49:05] where now
[49:06] it starts offering you this it starts
[49:08] offering you this
[49:09] you know how it is open up your phone
[49:11] you'll find things sometimes you haven't
[49:12] even been looking at
[49:13] you just been talking come on now and it
[49:16] picks up on it
[49:18] and it suggests hey you might like these
[49:20] similar items
[49:21] well what happens it happens the same
[49:23] way with the things that you watch
[49:25] it could be things about government and
[49:27] everything else
[49:28] now if you find that on the conservative
[49:31] side
[49:31] you find it on the liberal side as well
[49:33] when you say what's going on
[49:35] it's trying to sow entrench and bring it
[49:38] to a place to say
[49:39] evil people evil people and then it's
[49:41] moving in such a place here oh my
[49:44] how can this and why do they think this
[49:46] and why and you see what it's doing it's
[49:47] pointing just
[49:48] an enmity and a hatred that's what it's
[49:52] doing
[49:52] it's building a hatred and a resentment
[49:55] and a divisiveness what's it doing
[49:57] it's vexation it's envy you see this is
[50:00] why the bible says
[50:02] we are not ignorant of satan's devices
[50:09] hallelujah this is why we must have the
[50:12] holy spirit and i say it like this
[50:15] even to the young people as you go into
[50:17] school those things are like
[50:19] petri dishes for liberals i'm just going
[50:22] to say it clearly
[50:24] they're full of the garbage of the
[50:26] bacteria
[50:27] and things of this of thinking you say
[50:29] what do i do
[50:30] you pray you said god give me the wisdom
[50:33] to go in there
[50:34] and to get what i need and to leave the
[50:37] rest of the stuff behind
[50:40] amen we need the protection and the
[50:43] leadership of the holy spirit
[50:45] let me tell you god ain't taken back by
[50:47] this age
[50:49] but he's here and he continues to
[50:51] increase
[50:52] his power his authority his influence
[50:55] when the
[50:55] enemy comes in like a flood i the lord
[50:58] will raise a standard
[51:00] against him amen we're not
[51:03] ignorant of how satan wants to work so
[51:06] not be envious you see because satan's
[51:09] objective even as we
[51:11] if i can tie this point up is where
[51:13] we've seen last week
[51:14] you've seen asaph getting off track he
[51:17] lost his footing he began to look
[51:19] and it began to be envious envious
[51:21] beings boiling up
[51:23] he began to have such a how can this be
[51:25] and how can that be
[51:27] he got off track it took him away from
[51:30] his god-given ground
[51:32] but god helped him to see if there's one
[51:35] thing that i could say
[51:37] this is why we must have the the wisdom
[51:40] of god
[51:40] and this is what if if science you see
[51:43] satan's a copycat he's not a creator
[51:47] if satan let me just tell you what the
[51:48] algorithms are i know algorithms that
[51:50] deals with math
[51:51] but in these things i just talked about
[51:53] that's on the web and how it studies you
[51:55] there's nothing more than satan that's
[51:58] laying right there
[51:59] to try to ensnare
[52:02] is that right this is why as we i
[52:05] did say we we need that discernment of
[52:08] the holy spirit
[52:09] in this hour and i say it in this manner
[52:12] he's a copycat
[52:13] then notice how those algorithms will
[52:15] predict the thoughts
[52:17] what about the living word of god the
[52:19] word of god is quick and powerful
[52:22] sharper than any two-edged sword it's a
[52:24] discerner of the
[52:26] thoughts and intents of the heart that's
[52:28] what we want we want the living word to
[52:31] come down
[52:32] and discern our thoughts that maybe
[52:34] there's things that were entertaining
[52:36] there's things that maybe is
[52:37] entertaining us things that's
[52:39] keeping and eating us we want the living
[52:42] word
[52:42] to make himself real and discern that in
[52:45] our life and say
[52:46] hey don't be entangled in that let it go
[52:49] focus on me
[52:50] we need the living word of god
[52:55] proverbs 27 4 wrath is curable
[52:58] and anger is outrageous but who is able
[53:02] to stand before envy
[53:06] i want you to remember this rose
[53:10] in heaven and it was put out
[53:14] well envy when we deal with this i want
[53:16] to just look at these contrasting
[53:19] parts because of this same
[53:22] word envious it deals with
[53:26] to be heeded or to boil with envy a
[53:29] hatred or an anger
[53:30] and you realize love and hatred cannot
[53:33] coexist
[53:36] is that right you see
[53:39] sometimes when we look at these things
[53:42] like with hatred and you study
[53:43] in the scriptures in uh in first john
[53:48] four it is and it deals it ties together
[53:52] hatred with blindness
[53:57] because a person that they're blind
[54:02] hatred is blind it blinds
[54:06] and this is why listen these are some
[54:08] things i never ministered on it here but
[54:10] when you look at it there's sometimes
[54:12] that a person can get into temporary
[54:15] blindness and they need the help from
[54:18] the lord
[54:20] because those feelings there should be
[54:23] something as a son and daughter of god
[54:25] you say
[54:26] not gonna stay here you can try to come
[54:28] back i'm not gonna stay here
[54:30] you're standing there on the word don't
[54:33] entertain it
[54:35] but resist the devil but how do you
[54:37] resist the devil
[54:39] submit yourself first to god
[54:42] then resist the devil and he'll flee
[54:44] from you
[54:46] envy so your envy is to be heated or
[54:49] boil with envy
[54:50] a hatred or an anger now here's the
[54:53] contrasting part i want to look at just
[54:55] bringing these two together here and
[54:57] moving it in into the body
[54:59] it's in a good sense it's to be zealous
[55:02] in the pursuit of good
[55:03] so the contrast to that of envy is that
[55:06] of a godly zeal
[55:08] when you study these words we're looking
[55:10] at it
[55:12] it deals the charity envy if not it
[55:14] deals the focus in that scripture is
[55:16] is that it that it is not uh when
[55:20] charity envy if not
[55:21] it's not to be that uh that of a wrong
[55:25] anger a jealous anger uh that
[55:28] which is boiling up you know just
[55:30] boiling up
[55:31] but rather we it needs such a balance
[55:34] because
[55:35] in the scripture we are admonished
[55:38] the same word where i just read that
[55:41] that particular uh greek word is
[55:45] also it is used where paul will now
[55:48] have the people covet earnestly the best
[55:51] gifts
[55:52] desire the best gifts so there's a part
[55:56] it's got to move
[55:57] in the right direction and i know that
[56:00] we can
[56:00] look at that and say well that's pretty
[56:02] simple but we
[56:03] want to make sure that our zeal
[56:07] is tempered and governed by charity
[56:11] because our zeal could be right on the
[56:14] mark but yet it's so far off
[56:19] then it actually falls what what looks
[56:22] like hey man this is righteous this
[56:24] is this is this is right on and god says
[56:26] that's envy
[56:29] so we want this is where we want the
[56:31] holy spirit to see what
[56:33] deals with our life to guide us and
[56:36] direct that zeal
[56:37] in the right measure because envy let me
[56:39] just say it like this
[56:40] if envy is a part of your life
[56:44] and that's what's still known about your
[56:46] address you need to get the holy ghost
[56:50] if you enjoy listen if you enjoy fussing
[56:54] if you enjoy stewing you can't take
[56:56] correction
[56:57] i'm gonna preach you blow up and you've
[57:00] got every little
[57:01] excuse and you need to be born again
[57:04] i'm not even talking about you dealing
[57:06] with the carnal nature
[57:07] you need the power of the holy ghost to
[57:10] change you on the
[57:12] inside and give you a power that's able
[57:15] to bring
[57:16] that man into subjection to the word
[57:20] [Music]
[57:21] are you with me this is why we're not
[57:25] the same creation patched up
[57:28] you can't put new wine in old bottles
[57:30] it'll blow it up
[57:33] so when we deal with this envy has no
[57:36] partner believer
[57:37] if this is something that is a part and
[57:40] said these things are a part of that
[57:42] life
[57:42] then we listen this is not condemnation
[57:45] but yet i want the word to sting very
[57:48] deeply to a place of real conviction and
[57:51] say god is this where i've been living
[57:54] where i can't take correction or i can't
[57:56] best or i can't that right
[57:57] if that's where we're living we want to
[57:59] be honest because this is an
[58:01] hour we need to be honest and i'll tell
[58:04] you
[58:05] as a parent or whatever more if you're
[58:07] not honest with that
[58:08] that spirit will work through your whole
[58:10] family
[58:12] if you can't stand correction you'll
[58:14] find it come all the way
[58:16] right down through the family right
[58:18] through the children it'll come out the
[58:20] same way
[58:21] we need to know that we know that we
[58:24] know
[58:25] that there is that part on the inside
[58:27] envy has
[58:28] no part in me
[58:31] and i don't plan on making no pact with
[58:34] it
[58:36] even when i've got a time to have a
[58:39] right
[58:44] has no pardon a believer but you see we
[58:47] want a real godly zeal
[58:49] directed from a heart of love you see
[58:52] it's a zeal
[58:53] that's directed with faithfulness
[58:55] faithfulness
[58:57] that we we recognize yes come into
[59:01] church
[59:02] yes you know as we we support the local
[59:04] work and
[59:05] all all of those things that go on but
[59:07] it's a faithfulness to
[59:09] every part of the word
[59:13] i don't know how many times over the
[59:14] years where you know i've talked to
[59:16] people who can
[59:17] they can swallow camels but they get
[59:19] choked on gnats
[59:22] i don't know how that works i know
[59:23] that's in the scripture and i know
[59:25] jesus referring to that you know when
[59:27] they how they would process you know
[59:28] their
[59:29] their their grapes and things like that
[59:31] but i i know that to be true
[59:33] now look at paul paul would say it like
[59:35] this i got to get moving
[59:37] he said it like this i am jealous over
[59:39] you with a
[59:40] godly jealousy that godly jealousy was
[59:45] not
[59:45] something that sought to take something
[59:48] from them
[59:49] neither was it something that sought to
[59:51] run them down
[59:53] but remember that godly jealousy was
[59:56] calling them
[59:57] to maintain what god has
[1:00:00] done in your life god's desire was
[1:00:04] you be zealous in your own walk you'll
[1:00:06] be zealous
[1:00:07] in your own life paul's godly the godly
[1:00:11] jealousy was a zeal for the body that
[1:00:13] the body would
[1:00:15] walk and maintain that liberty that god
[1:00:18] had brought to its life galatians 4 18
[1:00:22] you know paul dealing with those who
[1:00:24] came and zealously affected the galatian
[1:00:26] church and
[1:00:26] wanting to want to bring them back from
[1:00:28] grace into law law being that
[1:00:30] oh you got to do this and follow this at
[1:00:32] this time of the year and do this
[1:00:34] but paul brings along and says they were
[1:00:37] separating you that you might zealously
[1:00:39] affect them
[1:00:40] but he says in verse 18 to our
[1:00:42] admonition it is good to be
[1:00:44] zealously affected always in a good
[1:00:47] thing
[1:00:49] we want to be zealously affected the
[1:00:53] bible said iron sharpeneth iron
[1:00:55] the bible said that we are to them as
[1:00:58] the more so
[1:00:59] uh let us not forsake to assemble
[1:01:01] ourselves together
[1:01:02] even the more so as you see that day
[1:01:05] appropriate approaching right
[1:01:06] provoking one another unto love
[1:01:10] this is a kind of provoking is a life
[1:01:13] that
[1:01:13] a life that's left it's not a provoking
[1:01:16] that comes as an
[1:01:16] irritant
[1:01:20] it's that which stirs up in a godly
[1:01:23] manner not somebody saying
[1:01:24] brother bill don't you want to be like
[1:01:26] me
[1:01:28] nope no brother bill's a real believer
[1:01:32] he would catch that no he don't want to
[1:01:33] be that way
[1:01:35] verse 13 of titus 2 look for that
[1:01:38] blessed hope
[1:01:39] and the glorious appearing of the great
[1:01:40] god and our savior jesus christ
[1:01:43] who gave himself for us that he might
[1:01:46] redeem us from all iniquity
[1:01:50] and purify unto himself a peculiar
[1:01:53] people
[1:01:54] zealous of good works this is the kind
[1:01:57] of zeal
[1:01:58] that it permeates a believer's life it's
[1:02:01] a zeal
[1:02:01] we want to please him it's a zeal of
[1:02:04] good works
[1:02:05] it's not something we're trying to
[1:02:07] manufacture no the sheep does not
[1:02:09] manufacture wool
[1:02:11] it only bears the wool it's our life
[1:02:14] we're yielding god's working in our life
[1:02:16] so it's
[1:02:17] alias unto good works now to think of
[1:02:21] this
[1:02:21] of here of where we are and god that god
[1:02:25] would open to you and i
[1:02:28] even the understanding that god has
[1:02:31] opened to our lives
[1:02:32] is quite a responsibility
[1:02:35] and some of this kind of almost borders
[1:02:37] it because all this ties together
[1:02:39] it almost comes over into that of pride
[1:02:41] but you can see how this would work
[1:02:44] in james 3 13 james asked the question
[1:02:47] who is a wise man and endued with
[1:02:50] knowledge
[1:02:50] among you let him show out of good
[1:02:53] conversation
[1:02:54] his works with meekness of wisdom
[1:03:00] but if you have bitter envying and
[1:03:02] strife in your hearts
[1:03:04] glory not and lie not against the truth
[1:03:07] he's dealing with the body that's what
[1:03:10] we're in now working
[1:03:11] within that of the body so the wisdom
[1:03:14] notice is letting it be known that if
[1:03:17] you've got
[1:03:18] bitter and envy and strength in your
[1:03:20] hearts notice
[1:03:21] this isn't even anything that's said
[1:03:23] outwardly
[1:03:24] but if it remains in the heart it'll
[1:03:27] eventually show itself
[1:03:29] whatever's in the heart will come out
[1:03:33] and he's saying do not lie against the
[1:03:36] truth
[1:03:36] why truth itself is not a doctrine
[1:03:40] truth is a person this is why you can
[1:03:43] have people say well i've got the truth
[1:03:45] i've had the truth and they don't have
[1:03:46] the life of the truth or the
[1:03:48] spirit of truth why because there's it's
[1:03:51] a compound part
[1:03:53] it's not just truth as far as doctrine
[1:03:55] and teaching and word
[1:03:56] but truth is a person jesus said i am
[1:03:59] the
[1:04:00] truth the life and the way and the holy
[1:04:03] ghost is the
[1:04:04] spirit of truth who will lead and guide
[1:04:07] us
[1:04:07] into all truth is that right
[1:04:11] so what god that knowledge that
[1:04:14] uh unfolding that revelation here
[1:04:17] he's letting it be known that real true
[1:04:19] revelation it's coupled with humility
[1:04:22] it's a make it's a it's a wisdom that
[1:04:24] has meekness with it
[1:04:26] its meekness is that which is a
[1:04:28] gentleness that which gives place
[1:04:32] to that word this is where
[1:04:37] as he's describing if this is allowed to
[1:04:41] reside
[1:04:42] the holy spirit you take its flight
[1:04:46] it's greed and it moves out you see
[1:04:50] what comes with revelation
[1:04:54] revelation itself it come is coupled
[1:04:57] with humility let me just keep reading
[1:04:59] it'll it'll lay it all out here
[1:05:01] in this this verse 15 this wisdom
[1:05:04] descendeth not from above but it's
[1:05:06] earthly
[1:05:08] sensual and devilish
[1:05:11] you can always examine even things that
[1:05:14] you might see
[1:05:16] as truth you can even examine it in your
[1:05:18] homes
[1:05:19] and everywhere else examine the the
[1:05:22] influence
[1:05:23] and then you'll catch what spirit's
[1:05:25] trying to motivate you
[1:05:27] you'll catch you'll know where is the
[1:05:29] spirit coming from it might be wisdom
[1:05:31] what's wisdom
[1:05:32] wisdom is things that you could see oh
[1:05:33] this would be helpful or i need to lay
[1:05:35] this
[1:05:36] in i need to lay that in but to
[1:05:38] recognize where is it coming from
[1:05:40] what's it motivating because even if
[1:05:42] it's truth but if it's not done in love
[1:05:45] it's no good is that right
[1:05:49] hey there's been many there's been truth
[1:05:51] sometimes that's been preached in
[1:05:53] churches
[1:05:54] and and people have walked away and it
[1:05:56] was because of the delivery
[1:06:00] are you with me it was not the truth oh
[1:06:02] they were offended because of truth no
[1:06:03] it's not
[1:06:04] because they were offended because of
[1:06:04] the truth because sometimes you find
[1:06:06] those people later on
[1:06:08] and it's not they were not offended in
[1:06:10] the truth it's the delivery
[1:06:12] are you with me this is why paul said
[1:06:14] speaking the truth in love
[1:06:16] that doesn't mean spraying powdered
[1:06:18] sugar when you speak either
[1:06:20] because sometimes there's a time you
[1:06:21] need to know where you stand
[1:06:23] is that right there's things listen
[1:06:25] there's things that god has revealed to
[1:06:27] you
[1:06:27] that you might see that somebody else
[1:06:29] may not be further along but don't look
[1:06:31] down on them
[1:06:33] what do i do be an example
[1:06:36] and remember where god has brought you
[1:06:38] from and the same god you never gave it
[1:06:40] to yourself
[1:06:40] god revealed that to you so we can think
[1:06:44] about that right there then you have a
[1:06:45] heart of mercy then you come back to a
[1:06:47] place
[1:06:47] to pray for the god who revealed it to
[1:06:50] you and made it known to you
[1:06:52] and here you stand now that same god is
[1:06:54] able to stand there
[1:06:55] and make it known to that brother or
[1:06:57] sister
[1:06:59] and if god chooses to you you use you
[1:07:01] you want to make sure that you're a
[1:07:02] vessel that's
[1:07:03] free of envy that's not
[1:07:06] boiling up like oh i've been waiting to
[1:07:09] tell you this
[1:07:12] charity if not
[1:07:15] for where envying and strife is there is
[1:07:19] confusion
[1:07:20] and every evil work
[1:07:24] is that right you see the
[1:07:28] holy spirit it brings things in line and
[1:07:31] subject to the word it brings things in
[1:07:34] harmony
[1:07:35] now james goes on that says this wisdom
[1:07:37] that is that is from above is first
[1:07:39] pure it's peaceable
[1:07:42] gentle easy to be entreated full of
[1:07:45] mercy
[1:07:46] good fruits without partiality and
[1:07:48] without hypocrisy
[1:07:50] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[1:07:53] in peace
[1:07:53] of them that make peace
[1:07:58] my my my my mind
[1:08:01] it's just hard not to not to just
[1:08:03] elaborate on many of these parts
[1:08:06] but we want to be sowers of
[1:08:08] righteousness
[1:08:10] is that right now you know
[1:08:13] many times there's some not many times
[1:08:15] but sometimes when i'm in the middle
[1:08:17] of studying i don't read a lot of other
[1:08:20] uh
[1:08:20] i only read or i'll watch something uh
[1:08:23] if i feel that the holy spirit has
[1:08:25] directed me
[1:08:26] to pick this up or pick that up or look
[1:08:28] at this right here
[1:08:30] sometimes i'll go and i'll and i maybe
[1:08:32] will look at i have different programs
[1:08:34] and i look at
[1:08:35] a commentary it's just something
[1:08:37] sometimes it's pooled because remember
[1:08:39] we we are people of truth are you with
[1:08:42] me
[1:08:43] and god has given us a filter to bring
[1:08:46] truth through
[1:08:47] and and begin to ponder in one of these
[1:08:50] parts i'm going to read something here
[1:08:51] from
[1:08:51] from adam clark uh the commentator from
[1:08:54] years and
[1:08:55] my some time ago but i want to read this
[1:08:58] it so struck me some
[1:09:00] weeks or time ago when i read this
[1:09:03] because
[1:09:04] this is the discernment that you and i
[1:09:06] even in the time and the hour that we're
[1:09:08] living in
[1:09:09] we really need the discernment of the
[1:09:12] holy spirit
[1:09:14] in everything because let me just say
[1:09:17] the word that god has given
[1:09:19] what god has revealed to you and i of
[1:09:21] some of these things we're just reading
[1:09:23] in james
[1:09:24] it's it's a word that when we receive it
[1:09:27] in the right way
[1:09:28] we recognize uh how
[1:09:31] how precious and that we are so
[1:09:34] undeserving of the mercy and the grace
[1:09:37] of almighty god
[1:09:39] but we recognize that what god has
[1:09:42] opened to us it was it's not that our
[1:09:45] that our knowledge or our mind would be
[1:09:48] built up
[1:09:49] you see brother brahm tells us in the
[1:09:51] church age book when he talks of
[1:09:52] luther's day
[1:09:54] he said there were men in that time he
[1:09:56] said there was
[1:09:57] so much truth that was released in that
[1:10:00] age
[1:10:01] to revolutionize the world but but what
[1:10:03] happened is
[1:10:04] there were many men he said that were
[1:10:07] not
[1:10:07] hearing the truth that it might be a
[1:10:10] practical
[1:10:11] outworking in their life they were
[1:10:13] hearing it
[1:10:14] only to be able to take positions and
[1:10:17] debate
[1:10:17] and to argue and they weren't hearing it
[1:10:20] in the right way
[1:10:21] you see it's got to be within that of
[1:10:23] the right heart
[1:10:24] and direct unite this is why when
[1:10:26] brother brahm says you see them
[1:10:28] under that influence he said they are
[1:10:30] objects to be pitied
[1:10:33] now look down on are you with me
[1:10:39] and sometimes where the hang up comes
[1:10:41] with love i i know
[1:10:43] you can hear this people will throw this
[1:10:45] out i understand it's in the scripture
[1:10:48] it's in the message love is corrective
[1:10:51] we understand that
[1:10:52] but for some people that's all they know
[1:10:53] about love
[1:10:57] he's cutting people down hacking them
[1:10:59] down and oh no no
[1:11:00] nobody's telling me i won't cut nobody
[1:11:01] down sometimes that's the only part that
[1:11:03] they know
[1:11:05] that's only one part of it but there
[1:11:08] needs to be
[1:11:09] wisdom to know even in that correction
[1:11:12] sometimes that correction is not even
[1:11:14] you saying something to that person
[1:11:16] it's you having a correct spirit and a
[1:11:19] correct attitude
[1:11:20] and being a correct example
[1:11:27] amen you see these are things that even
[1:11:31] as we go
[1:11:32] in our journey with the lord we learn
[1:11:34] because sometimes we can be geared a
[1:11:36] certain way
[1:11:37] are you with me sometimes some people
[1:11:39] are more geared a certain way than
[1:11:41] others
[1:11:41] this one listen listen to this i found
[1:11:43] this very tremendous
[1:11:44] adam clark writes it like this he says
[1:11:46] many persons
[1:11:48] cover a spirit of envy and uncharitable
[1:11:52] unchair i don't have it up there but
[1:11:53] just listen a spirit of envy
[1:11:55] and uncharitableness with the name of
[1:11:58] godly zeal
[1:11:59] and tender concern for the salvation of
[1:12:02] others
[1:12:04] now remember he says they cover a spirit
[1:12:06] of envy
[1:12:08] they find fault with all their
[1:12:12] spirit is a spirit of universal
[1:12:15] seriousness that means severely critical
[1:12:17] of others
[1:12:18] none can please them and everyone
[1:12:21] suffers by them
[1:12:24] this is envy a critical spirit
[1:12:28] but notice notice it's cloaked under
[1:12:31] oh the salvation oh i want there's
[1:12:35] i want i want this to be with them i
[1:12:37] want this to be right but the reality is
[1:12:39] nobody can please them they run down
[1:12:43] everybody they cut down everybody
[1:12:46] if there's only one person in the
[1:12:48] building that's righteous
[1:12:49] god has to take a back seat to them
[1:12:54] because they have established their own
[1:12:57] righteousness
[1:13:00] you see the blessing of the message that
[1:13:02] god has given you and i
[1:13:04] is a tremendous blessing but it must be
[1:13:07] operated by heart of humility
[1:13:11] because if not it works to cut down and
[1:13:13] remember
[1:13:14] it's just like as you see sometimes
[1:13:16] people that are coming on
[1:13:17] you do not when your toddler is walking
[1:13:19] down and they
[1:13:20] fall and they're learning to walk you
[1:13:22] don't whip them they're learning to walk
[1:13:25] when you correct them is when you've
[1:13:26] told them don't touch that lamp and they
[1:13:28] go ahead and they touch that lap
[1:13:30] that's when correction comes that's how
[1:13:33] god deals with us
[1:13:35] god doesn't correct us when we're
[1:13:36] learning to walk he's there to guide us
[1:13:39] as we're learning to walk
[1:13:41] but correction comes as we learn to walk
[1:13:44] and then there's things he says
[1:13:45] don't go here don't do this don't do
[1:13:47] that then as a faithful father he comes
[1:13:50] and corrects us
[1:13:51] is that right you see it it comes to a
[1:13:55] place
[1:13:55] of such uh where we're it's so severely
[1:13:59] critical and these are things
[1:14:02] that uh you know adam clark goes on to
[1:14:05] write he says
[1:14:06] these destroy more souls by tithing mint
[1:14:09] and cumin than others do by neglecting
[1:14:12] the weightier matters of the law
[1:14:14] such persons have what is termed and
[1:14:16] very properly too
[1:14:18] sour godliness
[1:14:22] i like that when i read that i said
[1:14:26] i could i see where i see where this is
[1:14:28] remember when jesus stood there in the
[1:14:30] temple
[1:14:31] they had become so engrossed
[1:14:34] with the temple with their creeds
[1:14:37] that jesus could stand there and what
[1:14:39] was spoken in the book of psalms
[1:14:42] he could declare the zeal of thine house
[1:14:46] hath eaten me up
[1:14:49] it was for their own it had nothing to
[1:14:52] do with him it was about
[1:14:53] them are you listening this is why
[1:14:58] as as paul would write in romans 10 2
[1:15:01] speaking of the jews he says i bear them
[1:15:03] record that they have a zeal of god look
[1:15:05] how close this is
[1:15:07] they have a zeal of god but
[1:15:10] not according to knowledge
[1:15:16] we want that governance of the holy
[1:15:18] spirit
[1:15:20] i'm just going to just going to skip
[1:15:22] here just a little bit to
[1:15:24] just just trying to get to some places
[1:15:26] you know paul had to deal with some
[1:15:28] things let me just refer to it without
[1:15:29] reading it
[1:15:30] he had to deal with some things where
[1:15:31] you had individuals in the church that
[1:15:34] um and i say in that corinth some i'm a
[1:15:37] palm of cephas i'm of this
[1:15:40] and and it really didn't matter you're
[1:15:42] not of that man
[1:15:44] it's god that man is just like this
[1:15:48] microphone god's used him but you see
[1:15:51] the spirit god
[1:15:53] it's spirit of envying god among them
[1:15:55] well i'm of this and i'm of that and i'm
[1:15:57] of this
[1:15:58] but the thing that paul was bringing him
[1:16:00] back to and where it should come down
[1:16:02] you most importantly you're to be of god
[1:16:07] we're to be of god it's not about men
[1:16:11] if god is there's a man or somebody
[1:16:14] that's been used
[1:16:15] of god to bless you remember thank god
[1:16:18] for the man being yielded and getting
[1:16:20] out of the way
[1:16:21] but remember worship god
[1:16:24] amen god god is able to use you know
[1:16:27] sometimes you hear things
[1:16:28] where people say oh my never heard so
[1:16:31] and so preach like that
[1:16:32] they never changed how they preach but
[1:16:34] maybe you changed how you listen to them
[1:16:38] you see these are things sometimes it's
[1:16:40] carnal things that move around
[1:16:43] and paul's telling them the spiritual
[1:16:45] part of it don't allow those
[1:16:47] envyings and things to come among us now
[1:16:49] he deals with this here
[1:16:51] in the book of galatians and he and he
[1:16:53] goes through it here
[1:16:54] and he speaks of how in verse 16 of
[1:16:58] galatians 5 let me just pick up there
[1:17:00] he says walk in the spirit and ye
[1:17:03] shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:17:06] the flesh those are some of the things
[1:17:09] we're saying at the beginning
[1:17:10] for the flesh flesh lusteth against
[1:17:14] the spirit not lordy spirit capital s
[1:17:17] the holy spirit
[1:17:19] and the spirit against the flesh and
[1:17:22] these
[1:17:22] are contrary the one to the other
[1:17:26] so that you cannot do the things you
[1:17:28] would it's just like look there's
[1:17:30] certain things that you can be
[1:17:31] reading you can maybe feel yourself oh
[1:17:33] my goodness how can they say this
[1:17:35] okay you can feel yourself start boiling
[1:17:36] up
[1:17:38] i'm just saying it for you because i
[1:17:40] know there's certain little things
[1:17:42] there this is where you have to say wait
[1:17:45] a minute here
[1:17:47] you got to get away from this are you
[1:17:49] with me
[1:17:50] you got to get away from this because
[1:17:52] which because
[1:17:53] what it is you're it's obedience to the
[1:17:56] spirit of god
[1:17:57] the spirit of god is calling you hey
[1:18:00] don't immerse yourself in those things
[1:18:02] hey don't give yourself to those things
[1:18:04] is that right
[1:18:05] it's calling you away from that even
[1:18:07] when maybe maybe your wife has said
[1:18:09] something
[1:18:10] and you know what she could have did
[1:18:11] anything jumped up and down on your toes
[1:18:13] or whatever more
[1:18:14] but today was the day
[1:18:19] that hurt and it wasn't maybe she did
[1:18:22] anything different
[1:18:23] it's how you're taking things are you
[1:18:27] with me
[1:18:28] now what happens there's a point i'm
[1:18:30] gonna preach
[1:18:32] there's a part about you that
[1:18:35] i gotta set this i gotta lay this in
[1:18:36] line
[1:18:38] right sometimes we failed in that
[1:18:44] i say amen for you but it doesn't get
[1:18:47] away from the spirit of god calling us
[1:18:49] back and say
[1:18:49] you shouldn't have done it like that you
[1:18:52] were wrong
[1:18:54] you were wrong you go make that right
[1:18:57] vice versa
[1:18:58] wife husbands on and on and on is that
[1:19:00] right
[1:19:01] thank god we got a conviction on the
[1:19:03] inside of the holy ghost
[1:19:06] that's what you're to rejoice in thank
[1:19:08] god for the conviction on the inside
[1:19:11] and to know that that same one that
[1:19:12] convicts you say god
[1:19:14] continued to teach me lord let me be
[1:19:16] more sensitive it's not you watching
[1:19:18] like oh i ain't going to make this
[1:19:19] mistake again
[1:19:20] i'm really going to study so i don't
[1:19:21] make this mistake again no the thing is
[1:19:24] walk in the spirit because you're going
[1:19:26] to
[1:19:27] all of us you're going to come into
[1:19:28] times you're going to come into this
[1:19:30] time but walk in the spirit
[1:19:32] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:19:34] the flesh
[1:19:35] now as paul goes on he writes he speaks
[1:19:38] of the fruit of the spirit
[1:19:40] and he deals with in verse 22 the fruit
[1:19:42] of the spirit
[1:19:43] is love joy peace long suffering
[1:19:45] gentleness goodness faith
[1:19:47] meekness temperance against such there
[1:19:49] is no law
[1:19:50] and they that are christ have
[1:19:53] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:19:56] and lust thereof
[1:19:58] the affections and lust are still in the
[1:20:01] flesh
[1:20:02] but you've crucified it are you with me
[1:20:06] it isn't that it went away no
[1:20:09] right in here is where the change comes
[1:20:11] this is where the new birth comes
[1:20:13] the real crucifixion then it's then
[1:20:15] dying out to south
[1:20:17] now what is it it brings that old
[1:20:20] man into subjection the life of that old
[1:20:24] man
[1:20:24] he's gone but it brings this body
[1:20:27] this flesh that spirit what is there it
[1:20:30] brings it in subjection
[1:20:32] to the word of god this listen to me
[1:20:34] brother and sister
[1:20:35] this is why brother braham says it like
[1:20:37] this i think in faith is the victory
[1:20:39] he said that which used to rule you you
[1:20:42] now rule it it
[1:20:46] doesn't mean that there are times with
[1:20:48] this hominin
[1:20:49] this might not try to this might not try
[1:20:51] to rise let me tell you this is why
[1:20:53] we've got to stay under
[1:20:55] the influence of the holy spirit it's
[1:20:57] not a risk oh i don't want to go after
[1:20:58] the world i'm afraid i'll go back to the
[1:21:00] world
[1:21:01] that fear is passed from you as a
[1:21:02] believer when you pass from death unto
[1:21:04] life
[1:21:05] but the only fear if i can say holy
[1:21:07] reverence is
[1:21:08] i don't want to displease him
[1:21:13] and that's where there's a tension in
[1:21:15] your life i don't want to displease him
[1:21:18] because you still realize those things
[1:21:20] the genes the tendencies
[1:21:22] but this is where we keep it covered
[1:21:24] with the blood this is where we stay
[1:21:26] under the influence of the holy ghost
[1:21:30] this is why paul says in verse 25 if we
[1:21:34] live in the spirit
[1:21:38] you're born of the spirit of god you're
[1:21:40] living in the spirit
[1:21:42] you're living you're living in that
[1:21:44] battle in the holiest of holy
[1:21:45] you're living there this man this inner
[1:21:48] man is
[1:21:49] living in eternity
[1:21:52] you've already passed from death unto
[1:21:54] life
[1:21:55] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:21:59] walk see this is part
[1:22:03] paul's dealing with the believers that
[1:22:05] your life
[1:22:06] not just where you where you to live as
[1:22:09] a christian born of the spirit of god
[1:22:11] but you're to let your life be regulated
[1:22:14] by the shekinah glory of god
[1:22:19] this is why paul would come in verse 26
[1:22:21] and say let us not be desirous of
[1:22:23] vainglory you can see
[1:22:25] how the pride and this works together
[1:22:27] within thee provoking one another
[1:22:30] envying one another i say
[1:22:33] truly as the body you see god is using
[1:22:35] somebody
[1:22:36] we rejoice you know it's just like you
[1:22:40] you can't
[1:22:41] you you can't explain it you know even
[1:22:44] when it comes to
[1:22:45] preaching or singing special one person
[1:22:47] might preach
[1:22:48] once in a while the person preaches
[1:22:51] maybe quite a bit
[1:22:53] that's god that's in god's choosing
[1:22:55] that's how god uses
[1:22:57] it's same thing when it comes to singing
[1:22:59] special it's the same things
[1:23:01] and this is where what our when our the
[1:23:04] real zeal is that god
[1:23:07] my heart's desire is that your body
[1:23:10] would be
[1:23:11] blessed and be edified lord
[1:23:15] i mean does anybody in here think about
[1:23:17] lord today
[1:23:18] i'm gonna go hurt my body i'm gonna hit
[1:23:21] me in the in the top of the head i'm
[1:23:23] gonna nobody thinks like that
[1:23:25] hi we love ourselves too much right
[1:23:29] do you want to be comfortable i need
[1:23:31] lumbar support
[1:23:33] let me heat it i need cool i need
[1:23:36] come on now it's like a love-hate
[1:23:38] relationship
[1:23:40] but you see these are things brother
[1:23:43] brown goes into it and gives such
[1:23:44] direction and christ the mystery and i
[1:23:46] don't have time to read all this
[1:23:48] but it's there to refer to and brother
[1:23:50] branham lets us know
[1:23:52] this is i'm going to say it like this
[1:23:54] this is such a common quote
[1:23:55] but sometimes i think it's become too
[1:23:57] common
[1:24:00] you see brother and sister things
[1:24:01] brother brown lets us know
[1:24:03] he says satan won't let you stay a big
[1:24:05] sweet group
[1:24:06] we've seen that over the years
[1:24:09] you've seen that you've seen that but
[1:24:12] somehow or another
[1:24:15] we drift away and this isn't just
[1:24:17] remembering words or act like this like
[1:24:19] a robot
[1:24:20] no no no there's so much admonition in
[1:24:23] the word of god
[1:24:25] it should be such a desire that
[1:24:28] within our life brother brahman says how
[1:24:30] that satan
[1:24:31] he said he'll come in he'll shoot
[1:24:33] everything he can he's trying
[1:24:35] to do all he can he says even if he has
[1:24:37] to bring somebody in
[1:24:40] and they become a critic and he shoots
[1:24:42] them full of poison
[1:24:44] the brother brahm tells us even how to
[1:24:46] approach that don't ostracize that
[1:24:48] person
[1:24:50] are you with me they've been right here
[1:24:52] and maybe here
[1:24:53] they're going around here and going
[1:24:55] around there and going around there
[1:24:57] brother but here's what he does say see
[1:24:59] these are this is the advice he does
[1:25:00] give
[1:25:01] don't take sides with it
[1:25:04] the first thing you can do is shut it
[1:25:06] down
[1:25:08] it don't matter who it is we shut it
[1:25:11] down when it when he comes against
[1:25:13] the word of god when it comes to try to
[1:25:16] start putting
[1:25:16] doubt against somebody else in the body
[1:25:20] of christ
[1:25:20] that's not the holy ghost
[1:25:24] you don't need to be a prophet you don't
[1:25:26] even need to be that
[1:25:27] deep of a believer are you with me
[1:25:31] he said but here's what he says you stay
[1:25:33] right loving kind
[1:25:34] and sweet to one another pray for the
[1:25:37] man
[1:25:38] notice pray for the man that he'll be
[1:25:41] saved too
[1:25:42] or whoever it is pray for him but just
[1:25:45] stick one with another
[1:25:46] you know what stick means you're sticky
[1:25:49] but it's not the bad sticky it's like
[1:25:51] the little bears i heard brother graham
[1:25:53] talking about this
[1:25:54] morning they got in that molasses bucket
[1:25:56] and the little bear couldn't even open
[1:25:58] his eyes
[1:25:59] his eyes were stuck shut he got away
[1:26:02] from that tent
[1:26:03] and his brother and his mother started
[1:26:05] looking on him
[1:26:08] right he was all covered over with
[1:26:10] sweetness
[1:26:13] right this is why brother he says it
[1:26:16] like this
[1:26:16] he says if the brother you
[1:26:20] think he's a little wrong or the sister
[1:26:24] say lord don't
[1:26:27] let me never have the root of bitterness
[1:26:29] spring up
[1:26:31] brother you're not saying you're a
[1:26:33] believer
[1:26:35] oh brother shane you don't ever have to
[1:26:36] worry about the root of bitter
[1:26:37] bitterness no no no
[1:26:39] this is where the scripture says let all
[1:26:41] bitterness be put away from you
[1:26:44] situations things will come that can try
[1:26:46] to create
[1:26:47] bitterness is that right
[1:26:50] but here say lord don't ever let me have
[1:26:54] the root of bitterness spring up
[1:26:55] cause look look how this is because
[1:26:57] it'll affect
[1:26:59] him and it'll take christ right out of
[1:27:03] my life
[1:27:04] notice what the prayer what the real
[1:27:06] part about is
[1:27:07] i don't want to affect my brother who i
[1:27:10] think is wrong
[1:27:13] it's okay help me lord jesus
[1:27:16] this is where we lord
[1:27:19] help me because brother brown calls it
[1:27:21] he says the poison acids of
[1:27:23] malice jealousy envy all those things
[1:27:27] it'll run him he said from the
[1:27:29] tabernacle it'll running from your life
[1:27:32] see when you grieve the holy spirit the
[1:27:35] dove
[1:27:35] you're sealed to the day of redemption
[1:27:37] but that dove goes right out there
[1:27:41] and there's something as you as a
[1:27:42] believer because remember let me say
[1:27:44] this to scripture
[1:27:45] the bible says you are complete in him
[1:27:48] you cannot be a new creation without him
[1:27:52] right and when he pulls back his
[1:27:54] presence and his influence from your
[1:27:56] life
[1:27:56] as a believer you reckon something's not
[1:27:59] right
[1:28:01] laura what what did i say something lord
[1:28:03] did i entertain something a thought
[1:28:05] wrong
[1:28:06] why because he's sensitive to his
[1:28:08] presence
[1:28:09] it's his presence that you delight in
[1:28:12] it's his presence
[1:28:13] that you depended on is that right
[1:28:16] you value his presence this is why
[1:28:20] the scripture will go on i'm closing
[1:28:23] let us walk honestly in romans as in
[1:28:27] the day not in writing and drunkenness
[1:28:31] not in chambering and wantonness not in
[1:28:33] strife and envy
[1:28:35] i i like this you know this in many
[1:28:37] parts of the scripture it deals with
[1:28:39] put ye on the lord jesus christ and make
[1:28:43] not provision in other words occasion
[1:28:48] for the flesh to fulfill the luster up
[1:28:51] here's the son and daughter of god
[1:28:52] you're reigning and you're no weakness
[1:28:56] you're not walking oh i don't got no
[1:28:58] weakness no the holy ghost don't have no
[1:29:00] weakness
[1:29:01] the son and daughter of god on the
[1:29:02] inside you don't have no weakness
[1:29:04] but you also know the land that you're
[1:29:06] in has weakness
[1:29:08] is that right just like i know that this
[1:29:10] land around here in sheffield it's prone
[1:29:12] to flooding
[1:29:14] you know you think you're below sea
[1:29:15] level
[1:29:17] it's weaknesses you're aware of it right
[1:29:21] so you you're not gonna you you're not
[1:29:23] gonna make provision like
[1:29:24] wow just let it go but you are mindful
[1:29:28] of it
[1:29:29] you recognize these things and you put
[1:29:31] on this means to sink
[1:29:33] into the lord jesus christ
[1:29:37] sink into that he's it's mourn him
[1:29:40] this is where love fading by it's fading
[1:29:42] back into the love of god
[1:29:45] paul would write it in the same way
[1:29:46] above all things put on
[1:29:48] sink into charity which is the
[1:29:52] bond of perfectness what is it it's
[1:29:56] something
[1:29:56] that here even brother bill after when
[1:29:59] we've been born again and for years
[1:30:01] i could call my brother bill brother
[1:30:03] bill serving the lord for many years
[1:30:05] brother gomez different others
[1:30:07] and i can ask him have you stopped
[1:30:09] sinking in or putting on
[1:30:11] the lord jesus they would say no
[1:30:15] i'm learning more and more and more
[1:30:19] and more and it's all surrendering
[1:30:22] brother dave sits
[1:30:23] surely on and on you we could keep going
[1:30:26] you see this is where it's in us brother
[1:30:28] braham says the holy ghost
[1:30:30] it's in you to abstain from these things
[1:30:33] it's in you
[1:30:34] to shun shun evil and flee to
[1:30:37] righteousness
[1:30:37] he says it's in you all malice hatred
[1:30:40] strife envy and so forth
[1:30:42] come away from it for that'll take him
[1:30:45] from your heart another place he says
[1:30:49] he's talking about hear us seeing the
[1:30:52] city he said i believe it's getting
[1:30:54] ready he said to come into view
[1:30:56] this is the ending part of 65 the middle
[1:30:58] part

[1:31:11] heart
[1:31:12] against somebody get it out of there
[1:31:16] right then but you know what that
[1:31:18] requires
[1:31:19] honest reflection in the word
[1:31:22] to recognize lord i need you and when
[1:31:25] you see
[1:31:26] something coming up remember
[1:31:29] don't let satan try to tremble it you're
[1:31:32] a believer your desire is
[1:31:33] just to please god and you see that
[1:31:37] coming up
[1:31:37] you stand as a son of god and say this
[1:31:40] is on
[1:31:41] ground that i'm in possession of as a
[1:31:44] son of god
[1:31:46] and i'm not going to give any place to
[1:31:48] the devil
[1:31:50] is that right i'm not going to give any
[1:31:53] retreat to him
[1:31:53] you see something coming up in your
[1:31:56] heart
[1:31:58] get it out real quick amen this is what
[1:32:01] requires
[1:32:02] honesty with god let me just tell you
[1:32:05] something
[1:32:06] god don't look at you and say my
[1:32:08] goodness aaron i can't believe you
[1:32:10] how could you how could you feel that
[1:32:13] way about brother samuel
[1:32:15] how how could you
[1:32:19] he's a high priest
[1:32:23] he's one who's there to listen not on
[1:32:26] the other side
[1:32:27] of the curtain that says whoa wow
[1:32:30] my goodness well who are you wow no no
[1:32:35] he's a faithful and merciful high priest
[1:32:38] he's the true one he's there to
[1:32:41] intercede
[1:32:42] on our behalf do you realize sometimes
[1:32:44] as a high priest
[1:32:45] it's not that we are always there oh
[1:32:47] lord i've sinned again
[1:32:49] lord i need another sin offering that's
[1:32:51] for the high priest is lord
[1:32:53] i've sensed this coming up in my life
[1:32:55] lord god
[1:32:56] help me lord jesus and he goes to
[1:32:58] minister
[1:32:59] on our behalf as our high priest
[1:33:04] oh my don't you love him
[1:33:08] let's stand if you wouldn't mind if
[1:33:09] you're you have to sit you go ahead and
[1:33:11] sit i
[1:33:12] some of you i know it's it's a little
[1:33:13] hard and i always say that but i want
[1:33:15] you always feel
[1:33:16] feel that comfort brother brown makes
[1:33:18] this statement here and i thought of
[1:33:20] this as i came to these
[1:33:21] points some time ago brother branham
[1:33:24] you're aware he stands there brother
[1:33:25] brown
[1:33:26] is just he's honest before the people
[1:33:30] brother brown stands there in the
[1:33:31] message the word made flesh
[1:33:33] in the india trip and he asked the
[1:33:35] people
[1:33:37] in that message and then it's followed
[1:33:38] that night as he preaches the jubilee
[1:33:40] year
[1:33:42] and brother branham he's just come back
[1:33:43] from india
[1:33:45] and brother braham has seen
[1:33:49] where how things are over there he's
[1:33:52] seen some
[1:33:53] american women to where when there was
[1:33:55] um
[1:33:57] a little indian boy he said that it just
[1:33:59] needed
[1:34:01] just needed a meal he said was you know
[1:34:04] feet was swollen and things he said
[1:34:05] and he asked these american women he
[1:34:07] said and they turned their noses and
[1:34:09] walked on away brother graham got to
[1:34:13] looking at that
[1:34:16] and they got to looking at some other
[1:34:17] things
[1:34:19] and brother brown he asked the church
[1:34:22] he says i want you to pray for me he
[1:34:25] said because i've developed
[1:34:27] a critical spirit that haunts
[1:34:31] at me
[1:34:34] he'll say it like this in that message
[1:34:38] he says i recognize this is what he
[1:34:40] calls that critical spirit
[1:34:41] he says i recognize the other day a
[1:34:46] selfish spirit coming up in me wanting
[1:34:49] to tell everybody they're wrong
[1:34:54] now love is corrective is it not
[1:34:59] but what brother branham is dealing with
[1:35:01] as he goes into that part
[1:35:02] he says i wasn't coming out here and
[1:35:05] correct and
[1:35:05] being critical he said but it was
[1:35:09] in my heart he said i seen
[1:35:12] you see this woman dressed in merle and
[1:35:14] morrowind and it's in his heart
[1:35:17] how can she dress that way you see
[1:35:21] that part of it even though how she's
[1:35:24] dressed
[1:35:24] is wrong are you with me he's not saying
[1:35:27] oh you know it's not like this
[1:35:29] worldly out here oh we just love
[1:35:31] everybody we just love everything
[1:35:33] we just love liars they don't love
[1:35:37] they're only tolerant of things that
[1:35:38] goes along with them it's all emotion
[1:35:41] it ain't love it's not talking about
[1:35:44] oh we just take everything in that's not
[1:35:46] what it is
[1:35:47] what he's recognizing is is he can't do
[1:35:50] any good
[1:35:52] for even that woman who needs
[1:35:55] she needs to meet the lord jesus not
[1:35:58] just because of what she's wearing
[1:35:59] that's wrong because
[1:36:00] every man that looked with honor and
[1:36:02] lust after she's also
[1:36:04] guilty in the act of adultery it's just
[1:36:06] so what is he doing it's to think of her
[1:36:08] soul
[1:36:10] spirit that's motivating or a man
[1:36:14] that maybe is wrong in his and going
[1:36:16] about in his way
[1:36:19] but if it's not right in here it can
[1:36:22] never be helped
[1:36:25] you first have got to have the right
[1:36:27] feeling in here
[1:36:28] see this is why we need the help this is
[1:36:30] why we need the help of the holy spirit
[1:36:33] this is why when brother brandon stood
[1:36:34] in that cafeteria in toledo and remember
[1:36:36] he looked over there and that woman here
[1:36:38] she was you know drunk and
[1:36:39] you know the way she was dressed and
[1:36:41] hear a policeman standing in a gambling
[1:36:43] machine and you you know the story
[1:36:45] most of you do and brother braham said
[1:36:46] oh god how can you
[1:36:48] let this how can you let this stand
[1:36:52] and god said come here
[1:36:57] now mind you this was not brother
[1:37:00] branham's
[1:37:02] first or second year in serving the lord
[1:37:06] okay this has been many years
[1:37:10] but you see sometimes the things listen
[1:37:12] to me brother brown tells us in these
[1:37:14] other places he said sometimes he said
[1:37:16] if you only knew
[1:37:17] he told the people in word made flesh
[1:37:19] india trip he said if you only knew the
[1:37:21] things i've had to sit
[1:37:22] and i had to listen to things that i've
[1:37:24] had to see
[1:37:25] things sometimes that could so you look
[1:37:28] at them
[1:37:29] lord have mercy the things sometimes you
[1:37:31] have to hear
[1:37:32] or see and this but you see what happens
[1:37:35] is
[1:37:35] is to be able even if god calls a man
[1:37:38] into that position
[1:37:40] he still takes god to keep him in a
[1:37:42] place
[1:37:43] to where he doesn't lose his mind
[1:37:46] and to also hold the balance to
[1:37:48] recognize
[1:37:49] this is still the inheritance of god
[1:37:52] to recognize that that woman or that man
[1:37:55] what they need
[1:37:56] is a meeting with jesus
[1:37:59] hallelujah that's why we say god
[1:38:03] we need such a such a balance we want a
[1:38:06] godly zeal
[1:38:07] but we don't want that like what we read
[1:38:09] here at the end where it's a
[1:38:11] seriousness that it's critical of
[1:38:12] everybody
[1:38:14] under the pretense of all i want to help
[1:38:16] people
[1:38:18] and it's everything is just this is
[1:38:20] wrong and this is wrong and this should
[1:38:22] be
[1:38:22] you know eventually where that leads to
[1:38:25] they start questioning their wife
[1:38:27] their wife starts questioning them where
[1:38:29] does it lead to
[1:38:31] it never stops because there's not a
[1:38:34] foundation
[1:38:36] this is why we say god search me
[1:38:41] search me that's every day of our life
[1:38:43] god keep me
[1:38:44] lined up let's pray
[1:38:48] heavenly father lord
[1:38:53] we we we appreciate you lord
[1:38:57] dear god i i think lord that stand here
[1:39:01] lord
[1:39:01] and deliver lord those things that you
[1:39:03] placed on my heart
[1:39:06] lord it just oh god i stand here with a
[1:39:11] even a greater realization
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:14] of my need for you
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:18] lord i i've come to realize and i know
[1:39:21] that
[1:39:23] there's veterans i speak to more that
[1:39:25] are out here there's other
[1:39:27] lord brothers and sisters they've come
[1:39:29] to find this too
[1:39:31] maybe some lord haven't realized it but
[1:39:33] may they they recognize
[1:39:36] god the effect of being under the word
[1:39:40] at first lord would want to pray if
[1:39:42] there's one that hasn't met you in that
[1:39:44] way
[1:39:46] that god that maybe these things are are
[1:39:49] just
[1:39:50] it's still their life
[1:39:55] lord maybe they come to church maybe
[1:39:58] lord is seemingly a pretty good person
[1:40:01] but
[1:40:01] i pray that lord may they may they have
[1:40:04] such an honesty with you to say god i
[1:40:08] want the love of god
[1:40:09] in my heart i want to be changed
[1:40:12] i want to be transformed and lord for
[1:40:16] the lives that
[1:40:17] you've transformed we depend on you lord
[1:40:21] we don't just lord live in the spirit
[1:40:24] we're to walk in the spirit
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:27] maybe lord recognize the value
[1:40:31] lord as the reading the word of god
[1:40:32] coming to the house of god
[1:40:34] being in prayer lord when we talk about
[1:40:37] a personal walk
[1:40:38] there's a personal upkeep
[1:40:42] lord if if one of us if we didn't keep
[1:40:44] up with just the natural hygiene of life
[1:40:48] we would become very offensive
[1:40:52] with things we have to keep up with lord
[1:40:55] feeding ourselves and other things
[1:40:57] how much more on a spiritual level
[1:41:02] when jew would write with admonition
[1:41:04] keeping yourselves
[1:41:06] in the love of god praying
[1:41:09] in the holy ghost lord
[1:41:13] maybe just lord maybe tonight they can
[1:41:15] just recognize that
[1:41:17] the value of them maybe even as they're
[1:41:18] driving into work
[1:41:21] or they're getting ready lord maybe
[1:41:23] they're at their home they're getting
[1:41:24] really going to work say god
[1:41:26] order my steps this day

[1:41:37] confidence in the word

[1:41:48] strongholds it's casting away
[1:41:52] spirits lord that would want to
