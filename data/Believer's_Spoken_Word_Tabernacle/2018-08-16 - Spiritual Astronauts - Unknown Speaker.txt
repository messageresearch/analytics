healed or something like that but um um she had to make it right first before she had to go up there and she stepped out of line and made it right and repented of all of her sins and asked the blood to cover her and by the time she got up there obviously you know the angel the Lord shows brother branham everything every but everything in everyone's life and by the time she got up there and

Paul saying that and hath raised up and had raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ to Jesus a man and a man praise the Lord my brothers and sisters this evening astronaut or cosmonaut it means a person who trained to travel in a spacecraft amen amen and amen praise the Lord I surely believe that amen a space man a space woman or space traveler a space Canada Austral not cosmonaut you know that a space traveler a person who travels beyond the earth atmosphere a traveler in a spacecraft amen amen the Bible says and had he had raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus when you are singing songs this evening I felt something like jumping shouting screaming dancing you know we are getting into that atmosphere when brother bill singing that song the old songs you know the original faith original world amen these are the days of Elijah amen the great Elijah the Prophet he was an astronaut amen Enoch was an astronaut Jesus Christ is a master astronaut amen and the bride of Jesus Christ is an astronaut's amen we are in the Eagle Age and we have that anointing the anointing of the eagle we are born as an eagle even though we were in a boneyard we were in a denominational system even though we ran into some easels or religion systems or worldly stock or worldly you know worldly you know things you know but we were born as an Eagles to fly that's the working of the Holy Ghost we have today amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord he has raised us up growing up hallelujah growing up just just just draw just crossing the atmosphere of this earth crossing the atmosphere of the gravitation whatever the pulling you of this world we are just all coming we are the overcomers of this age hey man hallelujah and had raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ to Jesus a person who travels beyond the Earth's atmosphere spiritually also we are just traveling just just just cross just leaving all the world world atmosphere a worldly atmosphere a denominational atmosphere a traditional atmosphere a religious atmosphere and we are just entering into another relief when we are worshipping of a God in a spirit and in truth that means we are entering into another dimension we are entering into another relief we are entering into the atmosphere that atmosphere which was created by the believer amen hallelujah bara jesus said to scribes and Pharisees I am from appalled ye are of this world I am not of this world he and all you where he came from and he knew where he's going to and the same thing with the brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ in the same thing with the saints of God the same thing with a believer hallelujah I am from above hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah power for the spiritual astronauts my brothers and sisters I would like to read some quotes here what brother Branham said in the countdown 1962 in verse in the paragraph 27 he said Hebrew says here was made of things which do not appear other words they are supernatural amen and the supernatural is reflecting the natural see now the then the natural was eternal now then the natural was eternal or is to be everlasting with the supernatural but but sin sin perverted the natural so if the soul which I believe it is then everything that's happening on earth is a type of spiritual things that's happening see it's got to reflect something that achievement of man the achievement of man praise the Lord and whatever it's happening now in this world whatever is happening here in this world whatever we are seeing here in the natural world it's already somewhere in the spiritual world so you know some man-made man may think that I invented this I made this achievement I met this I met that we went we made something but it's already in another world he is so lord like the natural body is here is the natural body and the body was made to reproduce I like that it reproduce itself which was children and now the natural body in the natural birth of a baby we find out the first thing comes forth water one of the Branum is trying to explain the prophet of God he's trying to explain about the natural things and to the spiritual is comparing and typing you know so the knotch natural birth when women gives the birth to the child first thing comes water then after blood then after law the same thing in in the spiritual world even we are going to into the kingdom of God then we are going to be born again the same thing the justification the water baptism and the sanctification washing by the word amen and also the baptism of the Holy Ghost he sister you know the life coming inside of you hey man the same life of Jesus Christ coming into you the same life of God is in you that's a much the same word the same one of us is in you today hallelujah oh Christ the name of the Lord what a blessed people we are what a privilege the people people we are we are supernatural beams we are supersede bhama hallelujah the spoken word seen Word of God amen hallelujah hallelujah and he are also brother branham was talking about the natural you know we take for instance the marriage for union we find out that the marriage we find the courtship and there are agreements and then the marriage then it should settle it for all the time now that's the same thing is with Christ and the church natural times to the spiritual natural types to the spiritual whatever you are seeing in this natural world that is something some beyond of the you know spiritual world amen amen and amen hallelujah that's the same thing it is with Christ and the church see a courtship God calling to our hearts God calling to our hearts we surrender the marriage ceremony and the bride takes the bridegroom's name there it is that makes the bride amen and amen praise the name of the Lord and my brothers and sisters here here brother branham is talking about the spiritual astronauts in this message every believer every believer who believes the Word of God is a spiritual astronaut and we are in that age now we are not in airplane age we are not in our sand bag eh we are not in automobile age we are not in airplane age or any culture age we are in astronaut age which is going beyond Sun Moon stars and planets what makes you to travel like that that is something a supernatural power that read out power amen an atom power is already in the believer God by spiritual birth by new birth by spoken word seed Word of God we are just born into the kingdom of God by one spirit we all baptized into one body amen and amen praise the Lord hallelujah and here are my brothers and sisters you know in Saint Luke chapter 24 here we see Jesus you know promised here you know behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until he be endued it with power from on ha the the power is coming from ha is coming from above to take the people to back to that to that dimension or to that a bowl you know to to to to to take us up the power of the holy spirit and here you see Enoch a spiritual Aslan the Bible says Enoch walked with God and he was not for God to him he was not astronaut Enoch was not astronaut cosmonaut by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death was not found because God has translated him God translated him God is giving us the new birth God is opening our hearts to see the world God is blessing us with a spiritual blessing and God is lifting us up and

for the last scene we are looking for the last astronaut to come in then the door is closed Oh Lara hey man and amen and here we see the bride of Jesus Christ she's a spiritual astronaut we all know the Scriptures 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 13 to 17 and before she go into the rapture brother Branham said she will know who she is when the bride had will know who she is then she will go in the rapture Christ is the mystery of God revealed and three things happens brother Branham said before this rapture takes place the three things happens which is first a shout a voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God what is the shout brother Branham said the message first is the message go first and she believes and accepts the message and she will become the message under the messenger and she will be the voice of God in this age and she will be the voice of the under-under the messenger and she will be the final voice final voice to the final age and she is a spiritual astronaut and an after-work voice of Archangel relevance and what it is it's a resurrection when the trumpet sounds when the voice of Archangel sounds then the the dead Saints will you know raised up we all know that and Trump of God priest brother branham said if the feast is a marriage supper amen we are not going into marriage but we are going into the marriage supper Amen hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible says here in Isaiah 40 and 31 there that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint Eagles we are anointed as an eagle the eagle anointing is on us and here a rather random in Revelation 4 and 7 in Revelation Book of Revelations he preached you know his messages and and he said about that 4 beasts law and cough and man's face and flying eagle we all know that brother Branham said the first law and face arm in the lion you know it's a revelation is a book of symbols right so in the foster you know for beasts you know you see the lion but the man said those are the apostle's the early church stood for this message stood for this gospel boldly like a lawyer like a lawyer he men preach the word and give their lives to God amen and then cough well random said marchers persecuted Church this is the marchers you know and Roman Catholic Church killed or you know marcher this six million people am i right amen because in our language we count in different way but six million people hallelujah they killed a saints of God and brother Branham said the ox always the calf always represents to the what he said is a sacrifice sacrifice and number three man's face what that is man's face Martin Luther Martin Luther that is his age and last flying eagle brother branham said is the end time bright amen Ryan Martin Luther cough again I'm talking about another you know in another way you know in another you know message in the countdown he said you know about this Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecostal Aryan time right here you see the Martin Luther stood as a as a ball like a lawyer and he took all watch over the Roman Catholic Church did all their you know mistakes and wrongs and their sins and all these he wrote in a big thing and he went to the Roman Catholic Church and nailed it he's not write like a lawyer he never scared or never afraid to the denominational you know people see he stood like a loyal and cuffed John Wesley amen praise the Lord he preached he lived a sermon a man sacrificed he preached I don't know how many thousands of messages traveled sacrificed his life amen amen and amen and man's face a man-made theology man-made doctrines came out in this age you know in this Pentecostal age and you know all these crates and dogmas came in you know and doctrine self and and and flying eagle st. John the endtime right praise the Lord Martin Luther brother branham said horse-and-buggy age John Wesley automobile age Pentecostal airplane age endtime pride Ostrow not age Austral not age and when when these things are happening Martin Luther he preached justification and in those days that's like a horse and buggy in before they're the people they used to walk miles and kilometers and hundreds of kilometres hundreds of miles or they travel on the boat or they travel on the animals you know like a donkey or horse or something like that and most of the people walked in those days but they they use a wheel as their transportation that real helped them to travel that is a horse and buggy and we don't use horse buggy now see we came through that we came through that amen so this whatever the man invented now well whatever they they brought it he's came from that that that you know that horse and buggy and all this amen hope you're catching my words amen and John Wesley brother branham's an automobile and Pentecostal airplane and when automobile created when they created the when invented or when they find this when they made this automobile they you know it was more easy the same way the spiritual you know the ministry in the in the ages in the church ages I'm trying to explain I'm just catching my world transforming and just translating the words in mind you know and the Lord is so gracious and helping me amen thank you praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus so when God you know bringing his church to a process step by step one after one from from justification to sanctification and they thought it's good now but God said it isn't it and the believers waiting there was more and their age is over over and another age has come and these Wright brothers are trying to put the mission they want to make a mission flying mission a mission a motor automobile is you know it's a it's a it's a driving we are driving over on the on the earth on the roads but they want to put that motor order that that mission in the air and they they invented it and they tried and that is the spiritual side of Pentecostal people they felt the same Holy Ghost you know in the day of Pentecost the restoration of gifts the same healing the same miracles the same science and wonders taking place you know and the same you know Holy Spirit I mean there they felt like this is it oh my we are the bribe he just jumped in the air oh my we are going in the rapture no sir relevance said that is not it a healings ok praise the Lord miracles praise the Lord speaking in tongues and prophesying and and then and seeing the visions and dreams and all these all praise the Lord jumping up and down good everything is good but it's came too close to that age and there is something beyond that beyond the Pentecost we are the Pentecost and looks like very similar to that age but brother sister this bride he's some filter last remark when the brother took me into this Ohio drew these are what you call this John John and neil armstrong's museum and i have seen all these you know what kind of quotes they wear and the clothes and the suits or whatever you know the
