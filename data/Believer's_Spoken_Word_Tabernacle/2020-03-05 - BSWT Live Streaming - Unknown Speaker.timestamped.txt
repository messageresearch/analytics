[0:00] strip give him everything you've got put
[0:02] everything into it don't hold anything
[0:04] back because and we're talking about a
[0:08] life here tonight that we our life has
[0:12] been touched and been affected by the
[0:15] life of sister Mary Sanchez I could go
[0:18] on as I thought about down through you
[0:20] know just my heart just thinking of
[0:22] these things as you know throughout the
[0:25] days you know and I thought about you
[0:28] know here are the different ones that's
[0:30] gone on that you know from from around
[0:33] us I thought of sister Joe thought of
[0:35] her and it all today and it hasn't been
[0:37] at times where there's not times that
[0:39] they're out of my mind to think about it
[0:40] I think of brother Carper sister Cara I
[0:43] think of sister Betsy I think of so many
[0:44] different ones it's not something you
[0:47] just forget about but there's things
[0:49] there moong with with with people that
[0:52] you you recognize that in their life
[0:55] they fought the battle and they overcame
[0:58] and there was a great testimony within
[1:01] their life that that same testimony it
[1:03] resonates to this day there's a purpose
[1:08] that was served and once the purpose
[1:10] itself is finished then God brings us
[1:14] home it brings us home and this is why
[1:19] the scripture would speak in this time
[1:22] and purpose knowing that even where you
[1:24] and I would be it wouldn't it would
[1:26] remind us there's a time to weep and a
[1:29] time to laugh there's a time to mourn
[1:32] and a time to dance when I look at that
[1:35] part within the scripture I want you to
[1:38] see this clearly that in every season
[1:41] the Lord is faithful in every time of
[1:44] our life when we look at even when you
[1:47] you you look over the patriarchs in the
[1:50] scripture you think of even how the
[1:52] scripture would have such an astounding
[1:58] writing of Sarah if Sarah would be
[2:01] mentioned even concerning that of Israel
[2:03] our mother he would be wrote there in
[2:06] the in in in in in the scriptures there
[2:08] in the book of Nehemiah it would rewrote
[2:11] in that way here was not only a patriot
[2:13] matriarch one who was a yielded vessel
[2:16] unto God and notice when they passed
[2:20] when when Sarah passed Abraham mourned
[2:23] are you with me when when Jacob passed
[2:28] Joseph mourned he they mourned as a
[2:36] matter of fact the Scriptures tell us
[2:38] here that in that the time of Egypt that
[2:41] they mourned threescore and ten days
[2:44] many days they mourned then when they
[2:49] got leave to take the bones of Jacob
[2:51] Joseph and his brethren took the bones
[2:53] of Jacob they come into a valley before
[2:55] the crossing and they mourn there and
[2:57] all of Egypt is struck they hear this
[3:01] morning and they say what a great person
[3:04] what a great thing this is for this
[3:06] morning that has taken place let me just
[3:09] say this to you right now Joseph and the
[3:11] rest were not mourning whereas those who
[3:14] sorrow without a hope they were mourning
[3:18] because where it was was a great
[3:20] patriarch their mourning was also in
[3:23] thankfulness for a life that had been
[3:25] lived among them a life that had been
[3:28] yielded to the Spirit of God just speak
[3:31] things within that time and let me just
[3:33] tell you there is a life right here when
[3:36] we talk about sister Mary Sanchez we're
[3:38] talking about a life that's been yielded
[3:40] to God absolutely but the summer you
[3:51] preach in the funeral right now no but I
[3:53] got a lot to say and I'm not gonna say
[3:55] it all tonight but there is a time of
[4:01] mourning
[4:04] all of that is necessary as believers
[4:09] we've not been lifted out of mourning
[4:12] we're not numb we feel that morning we
[4:18] feel that loss amen we feel that it's
[4:23] just like with with with with brother
[4:24] bill you know sometimes I'm just gonna
[4:26] say this because I'm just you know I'm
[4:28] just speaking right now to not like a
[4:29] father sometimes people they don't even
[4:35] know what to say when it comes to
[4:37] comfort people it'll be alright you'll
[4:41] get over it you'd have been better for
[4:45] you just to say praying for you you hear
[4:51] sometimes we and then listen you know
[4:53] it's just like within this hour you know
[4:55] we were not as believers we're not
[4:58] trying to be spiritual we're trying to
[5:00] be God in flesh to be able to reach out
[5:06] to one another and say I'm praying for
[5:08] you that God would strengthen you
[5:12] amen as the little boy was in the time
[5:15] of storm he's when his mama came up
[5:18] there and said you know we're all
[5:19] Christians he said I know that but he
[5:22] said in the time of the storm
[5:23] I need a God with skin on it
[5:29] hallelujah our comfort it comes from the
[5:36] Lord we feel loss and void in this life
[5:41] but yet our comfort it comes from the
[5:44] Lord when I say that our comfort comes
[5:50] from the Lord remember Paul said in the
[5:52] opening of Corinthians the God of all
[5:54] comfort who comforted us and he said the
[5:59] way that he comforted us he said who
[6:01] comforted us by the coming of Titus you
[6:04] see if we can be just as yielded vessels
[6:08] to one another you see this goes even
[6:10] beyond the situation's that even that we
[6:12] are presently dealing with as a
[6:15] congregation if we can be sensitive and
[6:19] say lord help me help me to get my eyes
[6:23] off of my little world now I'm not
[6:25] rebuking you better house understand I'm
[6:27] saying help me not to get so caught up
[6:29] in my own little world help me to look
[6:32] at the this is the Bible Philippians 2
[6:34] look not every man on his own things but
[6:36] look every men on the things of others
[6:38] this is a mind of Christ Jesus was not
[6:41] occupied with what was best for him
[6:43] he came occupied with what was best for
[6:46] you and me
[6:47] I say God I want to live that kind of
[6:51] life I want to live that kind of life I
[6:53] want to be that more I want to be that
[6:54] much more sensitive and I'm not just
[6:58] talking about with your family I'm
[6:59] talking about the family of God because
[7:03] let me get real personal sometimes
[7:05] people will only visit their family they
[7:07] don't visit nobody else come on help me
[7:10] say man they don't men know where
[7:13] everything is about their family but you
[7:15] know what we are the family of God a man
[7:20] when one rejoice we rejoice with them
[7:22] when they one suffer we suffer with them
[7:26] I think you know the Lord Jesus when he
[7:31] reminded his disciples of his going away
[7:34] he told him he acknowledged that because
[7:40] of words remember he was letting him
[7:43] know what type of death
[7:45] he would die and the departure they
[7:47] didn't understand that but yet he told
[7:50] him because of these words in John 16
[7:52] your hearts are filled with sorrow now I
[7:58] could tell you like this there's times
[8:02] when things like this will come down to
[8:03] it I remember my mom can tell you very
[8:07] clearly where my dad in in the last I
[8:11] won't just say last year but yeah mainly
[8:13] the last year and especially as it
[8:16] narrowed down into the last ten months
[8:17] or so he had many had questions that he
[8:20] was asking her will you be okay if I go
[8:25] standing at the door and looking out
[8:28] you see it's something about a believer
[8:30] there's things that sometimes you become
[8:33] aware now those things I'll be honest
[8:40] with you you say better say no what
[8:41] would you do during that time well I
[8:43] certainly don't sit down and start
[8:45] asking my dad what kind of what tell me
[8:46] what songs you want something at your
[8:47] funeral I don't want to talk about it
[8:50] what did you do brother Samuel changed
[8:53] the subject come on now let's just let's
[8:58] just be real and if you were one that
[9:02] want to talk about funeral I'll make
[9:04] sure you show them to the door you
[9:08] understand you see because these are
[9:12] things were not to be occupied with sure
[9:15] there's things to plan on we understand
[9:17] that but yet within it all is to be an
[9:19] encouragement and strength
[9:21] I don't want we didn't want to think of
[9:23] that we don't want to think of those
[9:24] times even when we see health and
[9:26] sickness and things failing we don't
[9:28] want to entertain those thoughts because
[9:31] as Christians we are not we are not
[9:33] built to entertain those thoughts it's
[9:35] not that we're denying realities of
[9:37] things that we
[9:38] see in front of us but there is a
[9:40] greater hope that we are looking for we
[9:45] are looking for any moment at any moment
[9:48] to be changed in a moment in a twinkling
[9:50] of an eye our expectation is not death
[9:55] our expectation is the rapture
[10:07] he acknowledged that sorrow he
[10:09] acknowledged it yeah I said look he said
[10:12] sorrows filled your heart but the
[10:13] disciples I want you to think of this
[10:15] they were not in position to be able to
[10:19] see that life after death they were
[10:21] still as Paul would write subject by the
[10:26] fear of death it was the unknown man did
[10:31] not know that job inspiration came upon
[10:33] job
[10:34] the revelation struck Abraham even in
[10:37] his preparation for Sarah
[10:38] but you see within this time that light
[10:41] as Paul would write the light of
[10:44] immortality had not come to light
[10:47] because it could only come to light at
[10:50] after the death the burial and
[10:52] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:54] and sending back that same life that
[10:57] stood there in that frail body and
[11:00] straightened its shoulder so shoulders
[11:03] and said Lazarus come forth when they
[11:06] looked at a situation and said it's
[11:08] beyond any hope he said but I am the
[11:10] resurrection and the life
[11:15] hallelujah the disciples they weren't in
[11:19] their position
[11:20] yet this is what he promised them he
[11:22] promised them that he would send the
[11:25] comforter unto them and he let him know
[11:27] your sorrow is going to be turned to joy
[11:30] and let him know I will see you again
[11:33] and the joy that you have no man will
[11:38] take from you now we know what that joy
[11:41] is he's talking about that joy is where
[11:44] he would reveal himself personally
[11:48] through his word by the baptism of the
[11:51] Holy Ghost where they could no longer
[11:54] take him away from them and they can no
[11:57] longer take them away from him they had
[12:00] now become United through him by the new
[12:03] birth there was a joy in the midst of
[12:06] their heart that was not determined by
[12:09] the circumstances we through were there
[12:11] times they were down absolutely
[12:13] you see this is part of the paradox and
[12:16] part of the mystery just because you see
[12:18] me down there you see somebody else down
[12:20] doesn't mean they don't have joy the joy
[12:24] and happiness these are two different
[12:26] things happiness and faith then those
[12:29] things can sometimes fluctuate but the
[12:31] joy of the Lord is our strength and
[12:35] David said the Lord is the strength of
[12:38] my life Jesus went to Calvary Hebrews
[12:43] chapter 12 he went to Calvary and
[12:45] endured the cross for the joy that was
[12:48] set before him what did he have a clear
[12:51] expectation it wasn't that Calvary was
[12:56] welcoming it was what came after
[13:01] it isn't that these things are welcomed
[13:03] death is a knell unwelcome to guests
[13:15] he's given us a joy that in the midst of
[13:18] these overwhelming moments we're in that
[13:22] were overwhelmed covered over with grief
[13:25] yet there's a joy because truly weeping
[13:31] it only endured for the night joy comes
[13:35] in the morning this rock that David's
[13:41] talking about when the hearts
[13:42] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[13:48] higher than I this rock that David is
[13:52] speaking of is not the Rock of Gibraltar
[13:55] this rock is not even that of Mount Zion
[13:58] this rock is the person of Jesus Christ
[14:03] David would describe this rock in the
[14:06] scriptures that we read he would
[14:08] describe for thou hast been a shelter
[14:11] for me not will be thou has been the
[14:15] past testimony you've been a shelter for
[14:17] me in the time of storm I've been
[14:20] through storms in my life you've been my
[14:21] shelter I will dwell David said I will
[14:25] dwell in that Tabernacle he knew it to
[14:28] be a place of a bold a place that he
[14:30] could go to that's what this rock was a
[14:33] place a tabernacle a place that he could
[14:36] go to and find covered shelter under the
[14:40] wings you see when we look at the
[14:45] scripture think of it when the heart is
[14:48] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that's
[14:52] higher than I let me tell you this rock
[14:56] that's higher than I
[14:58] became low for the Bible said for such a
[15:04] high priest became us who is holy
[15:08] harmless undefiled separate from sinners
[15:09] and made higher than the heavens he was
[15:15] as the scripture said a man of sorrows
[15:19] acquainted with grief calamities things
[15:28] that would take place he was acquainted
[15:30] with them I'm glad if we've got a high
[15:36] priest like that I'm glad that we've got
[15:41] one that we don't use a prayer book for
[15:44] no vain repetitions we don't have to go
[15:47] and say well if I can just say the right
[15:49] words we can just say Lord my heart is
[15:53] overwhelmed I don't even know how and
[15:58] what to say I don't even know but you
[16:01] know you know what's going on you know
[16:05] what's what's covered over me like a
[16:07] gloom but I know that beyond this gloom
[16:10] and darkness you're still god you're
[16:15] still present and notice David's
[16:17] requests lead me to the rock that's
[16:20] higher than I can't get there on my own
[16:21] strength I need you to lead me to that
[16:26] place that's higher than me you know
[16:30] David was one that he had a testimony he
[16:32] said I do not occupy or X ourselves in
[16:36] myself in thoughts that are too high for
[16:39] me
[16:41] you know dave was saying those things I
[16:43] can't figure out not building bridges
[16:44] I trust you Lord how you're gonna get
[16:48] across when I get there he'll open up
[16:50] the way David said I'm not gonna
[16:52] exercise myself in thoughts too high for
[16:54] me this is the promise to us even as
[17:02] believers as it would write in Isaiah he
[17:04] shall dwell on high speaking of the
[17:06] upright of the believer his place of
[17:08] defense shall be in the munitions of
[17:10] rocks bread shall be given him his water
[17:14] shall be sure it's a secret place with
[17:19] her spiritual food in due season
[17:21] it's a hiding place thine eyes this is
[17:25] the promise
[17:26] dwelling here thine eyes shall see the
[17:28] king and his beauty they shall behold
[17:30] the land that is very far off you know
[17:35] something about it when you get up a
[17:37] little bit you can see further let me
[17:41] just say something a little carnal but
[17:42] maybe it'll help you the past couple of
[17:44] years I've hunted out a deer blind it's
[17:45] been alright because I don't have to
[17:47] worry about if I fall asleep falling out
[17:48] of a stand
[17:50] I like it because I can't act much my
[17:53] thermos in there with coffee and drink
[17:55] it sometimes get away with movement but
[17:59] you know what the problem is I can't see
[18:01] very far I like being up in a tree the
[18:05] higher up even though I hate Heights but
[18:06] I'd rather be up higher because I can
[18:08] see them coming in your angle of being
[18:11] able to see them is greater if something
[18:14] about being lifted up where you have a
[18:16] greater sight of what is approaching you
[18:20] you when you get lifted up you see more
[18:22] of everything that's laid out you know
[18:24] with you just looking at this land and
[18:27] the layout of this land of how it is if
[18:29] you you know you know how it is if you
[18:31] you get up there and you pull down
[18:32] Google's Earth or whatever more and you
[18:35] look at the layout of like your oh
[18:36] that's how that lays in there oh that's
[18:39] how the Black River runs oh this is how
[18:41] all this comes through here you see when
[18:43] you get lifted up you see things you see
[18:48] things that you didn't see before
[18:50] there's a different perspective now we
[18:54] understand that the devil likes to use
[18:56] Heights but he'll try to use Heights to
[18:58] show you positive points he took the D
[19:00] took Jesus up into the mountains this is
[19:03] why Paul would have the testimony of the
[19:05] binding of his life that neither height
[19:07] nor depth shall separate us from the
[19:09] love of God I don't care if you take me
[19:12] up and show me all the good points
[19:13] nothing will separate me from the love
[19:15] of God but we realize that there are
[19:18] Heights that belong to a believer there
[19:20] are Heights that belong to a believer
[19:22] that we know as heavenly places
[19:24] it's that where we're able to not on our
[19:27] own strength get there but by his
[19:28] sovereign grace he will take us there
[19:30] that were able to look into that land
[19:33] that looked so far off but yet that land
[19:35] is right here with us tonight were able
[19:41] as he lifts us up this is where that you
[19:45] know that David would also ride in the
[19:48] chapter that followed Psalm 61 and he
[19:51] would write of this rock and and say
[19:54] concerning the Lord and how that he was
[19:56] waiting on the Lord he would say he only
[20:00] is my rock and my salvation not my job
[20:04] not my mama not my daddy
[20:07] not my pastor he only is my rock and my
[20:14] salvation he is my defense i shall not
[20:18] be greatly moved David would write that
[20:21] again and then David would would go on
[20:23] and you those of you as you're listening
[20:26] to the message you know that this this
[20:28] bank of scriptures of Psalm 62 is the
[20:31] very text that the Prophet would be
[20:33] inspired to take when he spilt spoke the
[20:36] message Shalom in god is my salvation
[20:40] and my glory the rock of my strength my
[20:44] refuge is in God
[20:51] somes 27 which is the background brother
[20:59] branham would call it like this and on
[21:00] the wings of us know what does he said I
[21:02] want to preach on the the message on the
[21:04] conditions of the rapture
[21:07] he would call Psalms 27 in the message
[21:10] the rapture during reading the text the
[21:13] background for the rapture you know
[21:16] background is an important thing you can
[21:18] hear a story but when you hear the
[21:20] background of it gives a little bit more
[21:23] it gives more of a significance to it
[21:26] when you know the background look for
[21:29] example if you did not know the
[21:31] background even of the early ages and
[21:32] when we stand on the other side and you
[21:35] shake you shake hands and they they say
[21:37] you know I'm per petunia or I'm you know
[21:40] I was Paul or a Silas you know you would
[21:42] say you know or some of the others let
[21:44] me just say some of them who had come
[21:46] out that are there in the Moore and
[21:47] martyr ology and different ones who gave
[21:49] their life who are just mentioned in
[21:51] Hebrews 11 and yet we don't have their
[21:54] name but yet when you would shake their
[21:56] hand and they say yeah I came out you
[21:58] know of the age of Ephesus or I came out
[22:02] of the age of Pergamus and we could say
[22:04] oh okay wow that was a that's tremendous
[22:06] thing but when you know the background
[22:08] of what was taking place during that
[22:10] time then you look at that life a whole
[22:12] lot differently because you realized
[22:15] there was a triumph there was an
[22:17] overcoming that where they were right in
[22:19] the midst of where the enemy was
[22:21] attacking but yet the life of God inside
[22:24] of them as they were yielded to God it
[22:27] prevailed and overcame and they had a
[22:29] testimony that they left not their lives
[22:31] unto death they overcame him by the
[22:34] blood of the Lamb and the word of their
[22:35] testimony the background on something it
[22:38] has such a significant impact
[22:47] David's declaration the Lord is my
[22:50] salvation he's the light of my life
[22:53] who shall I be afraid of what shall I
[22:56] fear
[22:57] David said though a host and camp around
[23:00] about me though I'm besieged all around
[23:06] here's what David said though a host
[23:10] they rose up to consume my flesh but
[23:13] they stumbled and fail and he comes into
[23:18] a place and he's making this declaration
[23:21] known one thing have I desired and
[23:24] that's what I'm gonna seek after his
[23:28] desire was so illuminated in his heart
[23:32] it put his life in motion this is what
[23:36] he sought for I want to dwell in the
[23:39] house of the Lord all the days of my
[23:42] life I want to dwell under his abode I
[23:48] want to be in his leading and in his
[23:52] will
[23:53] I want to know what his choices are for
[23:56] my life
[23:59] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[24:01] inquire in his temple for in the time of
[24:03] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[24:05] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[24:09] hide me he shall set me up upon a rock
[24:16] lead me to the rock that's higher than I
[24:19] when my heart is overwhelmed will lead
[24:22] me to the rock that's higher than I and
[24:24] now shall mine head be lifted up above
[24:27] mine enemies round about me you see it
[24:30] moves from where we're just looking at
[24:32] things sometimes we're looking at it in
[24:34] look we're looking at it here almost in
[24:37] eye level and all what we see all around
[24:39] us we see
[24:42] the problem we see the grief we feel all
[24:48] of them are you with me this is where we
[24:50] need the help of the Lord this is where
[24:54] as David said attend unto my prayer Lord
[24:58] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me
[25:02] Lord I can't get there alone I need you
[25:05] to leave me there leave me to the rock
[25:08] that is higher than I I can't scale it
[25:13] and get there on my own
[25:14] I need you to lead me there Lord take me
[25:16] to the rock that's higher than I and as
[25:21] he'll bring us to that rock remember
[25:23] it's like that where as David would
[25:25] write in my head now is lifted up above
[25:27] mine enemies
[25:27] it's that same rock you know that Moses
[25:31] was bidden of the Lord there's a place
[25:34] by me come stand right here and when you
[25:39] stand right here then God covered him
[25:41] over in the cleft of the rock it was a
[25:44] place where God could put his hand cover
[25:47] over and Moses when he walked past he
[25:50] seen behind ur parts of a man it was in
[25:54] that place to think of it in that place
[25:57] where he would see how God was going to
[26:00] come down in flesh an answer to a
[26:04] question it was a place this is the same
[26:07] place where Moses stood and God let
[26:11] Moses know Moses said remember remember
[26:14] there were things that God said Moses
[26:16] because you did this you're not coming
[26:18] in the land is that right but God
[26:21] allowed him God said come up
[26:26] I want to show you this land he didn't
[26:32] have to show him that land but he said I
[26:33] want to show you this left he took him
[26:35] up on the mountain and he's shown in the
[26:37] land the law could never take him into
[26:43] that land but the sovereign grace of God
[26:50] when we read there of Mount
[26:53] Transfiguration we find that witness of
[26:57] Elijah and Moses are there what brought
[27:00] Moses there not his own works grace he
[27:06] was able to look across into that land
[27:09] but it would be grace that would bring
[27:11] him there
[27:14] that's embraced by God's sovereignty
[27:20] that same grace has took a hold in the
[27:24] bosom of our heart grace grace that
[27:29] brought deliverance to a captive grace
[27:32] that came for one who was shackled and
[27:36] has been made free one who did not know
[27:40] well who they were what they were but
[27:43] grace has let us know you are my son you
[27:46] are my daughter I've always loved you I
[27:48] sought you out what did that grace and
[27:52] that same grace that has taught our
[27:54] heart to fear that same grace of God has
[27:57] put within our heart that hope that
[28:00] expectation that know we walk in this
[28:02] life but yet our eyes have been anointed
[28:05] we are not living for this life we are
[28:08] living for the other side hallelujah we
[28:13] have within our life the grace of God
[28:16] the love of God's Word has spoke to our
[28:18] hearts and Willie said Lord how can I
[28:21] get fair Joshua steps in grace comes on
[28:24] the scene and say I will place you
[28:27] your position in the land though you do
[28:30] not deserve it but my grace will lift
[28:33] you up into that place therefore because
[28:44] my head's been lifted up he's he has put
[28:49] me up above my enemies I can see you
[28:51] know what he's saying he didn't say that
[28:54] the enemies weren't there he said I'll
[28:56] see victory
[28:57] I see victory this is not this right
[29:01] here it's not a defining of who I am
[29:03] it's not the finality my head has been
[29:07] lifted up because he has set me up upon
[29:11] a rock in the secret of his Tabernacle
[29:15] therefore will I sing songs of joy I
[29:21] will sing praises unto God sacrifices of
[29:26] joy amid say you know what a sacrifice
[29:31] is right sacrifice you say well that's
[29:35] something you give but remember God
[29:38] don't want anything that's lame Alton
[29:39] halt and blind and God wants the best
[29:43] that's why when they would offer the
[29:45] sacrifices remember they had to take out
[29:47] there's certain sacrifices they would
[29:49] take out and they would lay the fat they
[29:51] would lay the heart God wants the
[29:53] innermost part of our life the choicest
[29:56] parts he wants it all brother Bryan said
[30:03] it and it's right I'm thinking about
[30:05] this throughout the day
[30:07] I'll tell you truly sister Mary gave
[30:10] sacrifices of joy
[30:11] I missed tonight not shaking her hand
[30:17] when I came down that hallway sometimes
[30:20] since brother Richard and brother Carlos
[30:23] and things they been able to take out
[30:25] that other booth over there sister Mary
[30:27] now had been able to come in and sit
[30:29] over there so sometimes I didn't shake
[30:31] her hand there but I would catch it here
[30:33] then you'd find other times she wasn't
[30:36] here now you know if sister Mary wasn't
[30:40] here something is wrong so you didn't
[30:45] let me just meet just kind of capitalize
[30:47] on that that's the kind of Christians we
[30:48] want to be if you're not here you're
[30:51] missed
[30:51] now you're missed but I want you
[30:53] understand if you're not here you don't
[30:55] want it to be what no pie when I went
[30:57] unnoticed you want yourself not that
[30:59] you're trying to stand out you want to
[31:01] be ineffectual life and that effectual
[31:04] life isn't us doing something it's just
[31:06] being surrendered to the Lord now you
[31:13] know I'm not giving anybody a rose after
[31:15] they're gone without God by His grace
[31:17] allowed us to give roses before but she
[31:24] was singing sacrifices of joy I know she
[31:26] was sitting there attack she was in pain
[31:30] I'd ask her sister Mary before coming
[31:32] out to3 how you feeling I'm doing good
[31:35] I'm doing good
[31:36] many times I wouldn't want to scare I
[31:38] just would come and I just touch her on
[31:40] the shoulder I'd stand there minute
[31:42] touch her because she was even if she
[31:43] was out there she was her eyes be closed
[31:47] her hands she'd be out there you know
[31:52] familiar thank you Jesus
[31:54] out here can I hear that down that
[31:57] hallway thank you Jesus
[31:58] I'd hear that familiar how she said
[32:01] hallelujah when the spirit would strike
[32:08] her there was no mistake in her joy and
[32:13] her delight in the Lord she took refuge
[32:16] in the Lord many times you think about
[32:21] it even in prayer meeting times brother
[32:23] bill would be here virus by himself time
[32:25] sister Mary would be able to be here
[32:26] every times on Thursday or Sunday maybe
[32:29] a brother Bill have to take her back
[32:30] home as you know sickness and and things
[32:33] were you know moving in her body that
[32:36] sister Mary one haven't and brother not
[32:38] brother bill won't gonna stay home
[32:39] anyhow but they they weren't having it's
[32:40] just these are things that I want you to
[32:43] understand these are things we were
[32:45] gonna say Lord let it be so determined
[32:49] in my heart we're not we're not putting
[32:51] people up on pedestals but I'm just I'm
[32:53] just saying it like this God is still
[32:55] God
[32:57] these things that even after we brought
[32:59] him up here and we said what we said
[33:01] they never asked for that
[33:02] I knew the potential me doing that I
[33:05] could get skinned alive but those are
[33:10] things that needed to be known
[33:13] now we're not trying to be like nobody
[33:15] else we're not trying to feel nobody's
[33:17] shoes cuz you can't the only thing you
[33:21] can do which is means that's such a
[33:23] glorious thing is let the love of God
[33:25] just flow through your life and you know
[33:30] as you let that flow through your life
[33:31] God unfolds to you what he wants you to
[33:34] do
[33:43] when there was one particular song that
[33:48] I remember when it would be sung but the
[33:50] bill would sing it and sometimes where
[33:56] the Brian would sing it a mansion over
[33:58] the hilltop sister Mary could have had
[34:01] the worst day that would set it would
[34:05] just set it off right there she was
[34:07] right there you soon as they would start
[34:09] playing and start singing a mansion over
[34:11] the hilltop right there
[34:13] she worshiped through every stanza of
[34:15] that song
[34:17] if I know what I'm talking about because
[34:20] it wasn't just a song to her she wasn't
[34:24] just singing lyrics she knew she knew
[34:28] where she was where she was going the
[34:30] body that that she was in she felt the
[34:33] aches and pains and everything but you
[34:35] know what she knew she had a promise
[34:37] knowing what in silver land it was
[34:38] better than that it was a body that God
[34:41] had prepared for her she knew that when
[34:45] it come down to that moment it's just a
[34:47] step from here over there because she
[34:49] had already been walking with God and
[34:51] had a testimony before him that she
[34:53] pleased the Lord so she had a mansion
[34:57] over the hilltop she had a mansion that
[34:59] Jesus had promised if I go away I will
[35:02] prepare a place for you in my father's
[35:05] house are many mansions if it were not
[35:07] so I would have told you but I will come
[35:11] again and I will receive you unto myself
[35:15] she had a promise in her heart she had a
[35:17] witness in her exceedingly that promise
[35:22] was a reality I'd say it she had a
[35:23] witness in her heart of the resurrection
[35:26] of Jesus Christ the message of the hour
[35:28] had revealed him to her he never
[35:32] revealed him to be a second person or a
[35:34] third person or to just one of them it
[35:37] revealed that redemptive work that she
[35:40] was included in Redemption clear back
[35:43] before the foundation of the world
[35:45] so the sacrifices of joy was because
[35:48] there was a peace there was an abstract
[35:51] there was a token there was a comfort
[35:53] that had come that no matter what I'm
[35:55] going through that God the same God that
[35:58] has brought me this far will see me
[36:00] through the rest of the way
[36:03] she had the atonement of his life that
[36:06] was within the blood had moved into her
[36:09] soul she know she knew the passage has
[36:14] been paid see this is with the things
[36:17] that it makes it so easy because you
[36:19] know for a believer you have to preach a
[36:22] funeral their life has already breached
[36:24] it their life has already breached their
[36:28] funeral that's why we understand clearly
[36:30] that no matter what a man says the
[36:32] pastor in whatever more you know I
[36:34] hadn't been to a lot of funerals where
[36:36] there had been somebody else doing the
[36:37] service maybe my wife can't help me
[36:40] maybe there'd been some but you know I
[36:42] hadn't been through a lot you know but
[36:43] sometimes of different ones you come
[36:45] into and you come into situations and
[36:47] you can hear people who when people
[36:49] start talking about this one or whatever
[36:50] more and people are like who's he
[36:52] talking about
[36:54] because no pastor can put you there
[36:58] nobody can put you there only God can
[37:02] bring you there amen we don't know where
[37:07] our desire as a believer
[37:10] we don't want deathbed confessions thank
[37:14] God for what happened there on Calvary
[37:16] with with that of the feet that was on
[37:19] his right but remember God's desire is
[37:21] that our life would be lived fully for
[37:24] him
[37:26] think of one of the admonitions where
[37:28] Paul would speak concerning to us as
[37:30] believers that one of these days he said
[37:32] to speak of how that he Paul would call
[37:34] death write out death where is thy sting
[37:36] o grave where is that victory he would
[37:39] let it be known that this mortality
[37:41] shall put on immortality he let us know
[37:44] of the coming expectation in the closing
[37:46] verse of 1st Corinthians 15 he would let
[37:51] us know how to conduct ourselves while
[37:54] you are waiting abound in the work of
[37:58] the Lord if I could say it like brother
[38:02] bill would say it go forward go
[38:12] truly we we are gonna miss sister Mary I
[38:21] say gone oh we already do but we we miss
[38:24] her and I certainly think God you know
[38:30] God has things arranged just in his time
[38:32] God knew even if things I've watched
[38:36] this over the years in the assembly
[38:37] while God has things arranged just in
[38:39] his time and how things can be prepared
[38:42] there's a transition that's coming God
[38:46] prepares someone to be able to step up
[38:47] all these things it's God because it's
[38:49] God's economy it's God at work and you
[38:55] know the things that we we see here is
[39:02] we sorrow but we're sorrowing not as
[39:06] others that have no hope and with these
[39:11] words these are the words that were to
[39:14] comfort one another with these words
[39:19] and they just say this to you the
[39:21] comfort of these words is not
[39:24] necessarily for us to go up to one
[39:27] another and quote these passages of
[39:29] scripture the comfort of these words is
[39:32] to have that life to have that presence
[39:37] to have the reality of 1st Thessalonians
[39:40] 4 the rapture burning in our bosom and
[39:43] so when we go to express a word and say
[39:47] I'm praying for you
[39:52] we're not quoting 1st Thessalonians 4
[39:55] we are the manifestation of 1st
[39:59] Thessalonians 4
[40:02] it's to comfort one another and I think
[40:07] of this you know with brother bill and
[40:12] sister Mary I I so thank God that
[40:15] brother bill was able when the Lord seen
[40:21] fit for him to retire they were always
[40:24] the in sister Mary just I'd say it's so
[40:27] complementary to one another and I said
[40:33] you know I said the other night I said I
[40:35] think God for these years I couldn't
[40:38] remember how many years or brother bill
[40:39] had been retired
[40:40] I said you you all just grow even
[40:42] thicker together I mean they were pardon
[40:46] my saying is thicker than molasses I
[40:48] mean it would just I mean you know it
[40:50] was just little things you know I tease
[40:53] sister Mary and once in a while so
[40:54] sister Mary do you need me come and get
[40:56] brother bill so you can get a rest you
[40:57] know and and you know do you need it
[40:59] because brother bill times would like to
[41:00] go with me when it came to get brothers
[41:03] from overseas or he traveled with
[41:04] brother Richard brother brother bill he
[41:06] he loved doing he still does
[41:08] both of brother Bill and sister Mary
[41:10] could say this about them they have they
[41:12] have servant hearts and they're that
[41:16] sister Mary's already got her reward of
[41:18] a crown of righteousness a new body but
[41:22] I was just telling the Lord here today I
[41:24] said lord I can't wait to stand there on
[41:26] that day and I hear the other crowns
[41:28] that are given out to them the other
[41:31] rewards because we will be rewarded
[41:33] we're not doing it for rewards but to
[41:37] think of that of crowns that'll be
[41:39] throughout the scriptures that are
[41:41] mention of those other crowns and I
[41:44] think of how that you know with with
[41:47] sister Mary you know she her and brother
[41:49] bill just such a a love and such an
[41:52] example you know sister Mary was she was
[41:56] such an example I believe right here
[41:59] among us when there were things that
[42:01] come up and those of you you sisters
[42:04] could you could say a man to this there
[42:07] were times where she didn't ask you oh
[42:09] do you think you could make no you make
[42:12] this you make this and you make this
[42:15] you with me that's needed she would say
[42:20] that you make this you make this you
[42:22] make that and there were things that
[42:24] would be be ordered in that burden that
[42:27] that that she would have for the people
[42:30] and the Assembly of God through her
[42:32] she's a very detailed person she's
[42:37] sister Mary was one that you know as I
[42:40] have had different reports that's come
[42:41] in she always asking about the family
[42:44] different ones you know those of you
[42:46] that had children and things like that
[42:47] should ask you about your children
[42:50] she keeps up with those children
[43:01] sister Mary was a grandma to every child
[43:03] here she acted like it she was proud of
[43:11] all the different accomplishments and
[43:13] things like that i just i'd say i'd take
[43:16] take it out of this right here take out
[43:18] of this right here what you seen within
[43:20] her life i believe is an expression it's
[43:22] like a flower it was an expression that
[43:26] helps you and i see god helped me to
[43:31] also be interested in your body help me
[43:37] to ask others instead of saying you know
[43:39] what I had the worst day today I'll tell
[43:40] you I had no help me say fella Matthew
[43:42] how you doing today let's do 2 by the
[43:45] time we hang up but the man's like man I
[43:46] know he that guy had a bad day today
[43:50] lord help me
[43:53] these are scriptural principles here and
[43:57] I say tonight that within this right
[43:59] here I so thank God for brother bill and
[44:01] sister Mary I could go on and on because
[44:03] there's so many different scriptures
[44:05] that I think of when I think of sister
[44:07] Mary's life her and brother bill
[44:10] together and they truly were value to
[44:15] this assembly I believe I can safely say
[44:18] this I know that the Lord started this
[44:20] work I know that God called my you
[44:22] called my daddy and used my daddy here
[44:24] instrumentally but I can say this very
[44:27] clearly if it hadn't been for brother
[44:29] bill and sister Mary and different ones
[44:30] like brother herb and sister Joe and
[44:32] different ones that stood as pillars in
[44:35] this assembly and some of us as a young
[44:38] ones and different ones like that if you
[44:40] don't know their testimony when we get
[44:42] the next fellowship or you get the next
[44:44] time pull yourself up under that oak
[44:46] tree over there known as brother herb
[44:47] pull yourself up under the oak tree
[44:50] called brother bill pull yourself up
[44:51] under some of these oak trees and ask
[44:53] him say how was it because there's a
[44:57] testimony we benefit of the labors in
[45:00] the journey
[45:02] thank God for lives that have gone
[45:05] before us they've lived their time
[45:10] they've lived their testimony and they
[45:13] they have fought the good fight of faith
[45:15] I think God would still have the
[45:18] different ones here with us brother her
[45:20] brother Bill and I think of all the
[45:22] different ones and if I forget somebody
[45:24] please it's not it's just my mind my
[45:25] memory you forgive me as they said it's
[45:28] not Alzheimer's it's called some timers
[45:30] when you're young but I mean with all of
[45:34] our heart that for every one of us let
[45:37] our hearts be like that of Paul what
[45:42] would you have me do
[45:47] and the first thing God did for Paul was
[45:49] fill him up then when God filled him up
[45:52] then God God was going to answer this
[45:54] call this is what I want you to do for
[45:56] me it's the greatest greatest privilege
[46:00] and I say tonight that yes our heart is
[46:03] overwhelmed brother bill that's his
[46:07] sweetheart his wife I can't I can't even
[46:12] enter in to try to imagine how that
[46:15] would be but I know because I said that
[46:18] love that was so so thick that was so
[46:21] real that was between them and brother
[46:26] bill will need our prayer and our
[46:29] support I'll tell you you know how he's
[46:33] been at the door
[46:34] he's called brother bill brother bill
[46:40] didn't need a title to do nothing he did
[46:45] it as unto the Lord brother bill never
[46:48] said well I'm not a pastor I'm not a
[46:49] deacon so I can't call nobody no he
[46:51] called you if he don't see you sitting
[46:54] around in here he wondered where yet he
[46:57] called you I miss you miss seeing you
[47:00] same thing with sister Mary and these
[47:03] are things that when we look at they're
[47:05] gonna need they're gonna need that now
[47:10] from us and I'm gonna just say it very
[47:14] purposely not all at once but as the
[47:21] week's unfold as the months unfold I
[47:26] know God gives strength and grace I
[47:29] witnessed it just from my when my dad's
[47:31] passing God gave us strength and I when
[47:34] I set up on the side of the bed that
[47:36] morning a couple days after I said I
[47:38] told my wife I said this is the prayers
[47:41] of the people because I have touched I
[47:44] don't know how to describe it
[47:45] I felt strengthened the salmon were you
[47:47] sorrowful I was but I felt strengthened
[47:51] it didn't mean that waves didn't come
[47:53] sometimes waves came at odd times
[47:57] sometimes they would come at times right
[47:59] before I was you know getting ready to
[48:01] entertain maybe a service and I'd have
[48:03] to just say lord help my eyes help my
[48:05] but you know God is faithful because we
[48:09] hadn't lost sister Mary brother bill
[48:11] knows he and lost sister Mary right
[48:14] there when we were gathered there in
[48:16] that room yesterday
[48:19] we watched a saint go home to glory they
[48:26] were called to rest from their labor and
[48:29] no wonder the scripture would say
[48:31] precious in the side of the Lord is the
[48:35] death of his Saints because God had
[48:38] brought that masterpiece to appoint the
[48:42] purpose and brother Brennan said like
[48:44] any artist or any composer they don't
[48:46] bring it to that and then just do away
[48:48] with it he said they take it and they
[48:51] put it out
[48:56] may God comfort our hearts as well as an
[49:01] assembly brother rich in sister Maria
[49:04] and not just them but as an assembly
[49:06] with this even the passing of Liliana
[49:10] this has been very close for us it
