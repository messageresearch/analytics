[32:00] the book of
[32:01] joshua in the 10th chapter
[32:14] amen
[32:17] well praise the lord
[32:21] i was i was
[32:25] texting brother andrew earlier about the
[32:27] camp and he said it was
[32:29] a wonderful time and said that your
[32:32] pastor was tearing it up
[32:36] i know you probably missed him you'd
[32:38] rather see him but he's doing
[32:39] the lord's work we know there'll be
[32:42] great benefit from it amen
[32:44] joshua the 10th chapter i would just
[32:47] start at the 12th verse
[32:49] and then spake joshua to the lord in the
[32:51] day when the lord delivered up the
[32:52] amorites before the children of israel
[32:54] and he said in the sight of israel
[32:56] sons stand thou still upon gibeon and
[32:59] thou
[32:59] moon in the valley of agilent and the
[33:02] sun stood still
[33:03] and the moon stayed until the people had
[33:05] avenged themselves
[33:07] upon their enemies is is this written in
[33:11] the book of
[33:12] is is not this written in the book of
[33:14] jasher
[33:15] so the son stood still in the midst of
[33:17] heaven and hastened not to go down
[33:19] about a whole day and there there was no
[33:23] day like that
[33:24] before it or after it that the lord
[33:26] hearkened to the voice of a man
[33:29] for the lord fought for israel and
[33:31] joshua returned in all israel with him
[33:34] unto the camp of gilgal
[33:36] but these five kings fled and hid
[33:38] themselves in a cave
[33:40] at mecca and it was told joshua's saying
[33:43] the five kings are found hid in a cave
[33:45] at maccada
[33:46] and joshua said roll great stones upon
[33:48] the mouth of the cave
[33:50] and set men by it for to keep them and
[33:53] stay
[33:53] not but pursue after your enemies and
[33:55] smite the hindmost of them
[33:57] suffer them not to enter into their
[33:59] cities
[34:00] for the lord your god had delivered them
[34:02] into your hand
[34:04] and it came to pass when joshua and the
[34:06] children of israel had made an end of
[34:08] the slaying them with the very great
[34:10] slaughter
[34:10] till they were consumed that the rest
[34:12] which remained of them
[34:14] entered into the fenced cities and all
[34:16] the people returned to the camp
[34:19] to joshua macada in peace and none moved
[34:22] his tongue against any
[34:24] of the children of israel then said
[34:26] joshua open the mouth of the cave and
[34:28] bring out those five kings unto me out
[34:30] of the cave
[34:31] and they did so and brought forth those
[34:33] five kings unto him out of the cave and
[34:35] the king of jerusalem and the king of
[34:37] hebron and the king of jarath and the
[34:38] king of
[34:39] latchis and the king of eglon and it
[34:42] came to pass when they brought out those
[34:44] kings unto joshua
[34:46] that joshua called for all the men of
[34:48] israel and said unto the captains of the
[34:50] men of war
[34:51] which went with him come near and put
[34:54] your foot upon the necks of these kings
[34:56] and they came near and put their feet
[34:58] upon the the necks of them
[35:00] and joshua said unto them fear not nor
[35:03] be dismayed
[35:04] be strong and of good courage for thus
[35:07] shall the lord do to all your enemies
[35:09] against whom you fight
[35:10] and afterward joshua smote them and slew
[35:13] them and hang them on five trees
[35:15] and they were hanging upon the trees
[35:18] until the evening amen may god bless his
[35:20] word and you may be seated tonight and i
[35:22] i know that this is probably a familiar
[35:24] passage of scripture to most of us
[35:26] believers and
[35:27] we've heard it before but i just want to
[35:29] maybe just talk for just a few minutes
[35:31] tonight on
[35:32] on weapon of choice
[35:35] we have a weapon that we choose and
[35:37] we're in a battle and we know that we're
[35:39] in a battle and we know that we're in a
[35:41] fight and
[35:42] and we can we can we can choose to lay
[35:44] down and take it or we can choose to
[35:46] fight back and
[35:47] we can choose to just accept what the
[35:49] devil has given us and and the report
[35:50] that he's delivered us
[35:52] or we can we can choose to seek another
[35:54] report and we can we can choose to
[35:56] to fight back against what what the
[35:57] devil would put on us in this age and
[35:59] the
[36:00] and the laodicea spirit that we have to
[36:02] fight and and the
[36:03] the discrepancies that we have to fight
[36:06] and depressions and
[36:07] and and we can choose to fight back
[36:09] against that because we've been given a
[36:11] weapon
[36:12] and that weapon is the weapon of choice
[36:14] and i just like this passage of
[36:16] scripture
[36:17] to bring this out because joshua has
[36:19] been commissioned
[36:20] and and we know we all know the story of
[36:22] joshua and how
[36:23] how he was commissioned by moses that
[36:25] you you're going to take this land and
[36:27] and he had the captain of the lord of
[36:29] the hosts with him and joshua the
[36:30] prophet would tell us became fearless in
[36:32] his testimony that
[36:34] that he knew that he was ordained and he
[36:36] was called and he was placed
[36:38] to destroy every enemy that was in their
[36:40] land and and no matter how far the
[36:42] boundary would go but he knew
[36:43] that that he was ordained to destroy
[36:45] that enemy and that he was ordained to
[36:47] overcome that camp and he was ordained
[36:49] to
[36:49] to take down jericho and he was ordained
[36:52] to take down every king of the land and
[36:53] so joshua became fearless in his
[36:55] testimony but i like this portion of
[36:57] scripture here
[36:58] because under a joshua ministry he calls
[37:01] his mighty men of war to come back
[37:04] because he has a need for them he has a
[37:06] purpose for them and i believe that's
[37:07] where we
[37:08] come in is is under the power of the
[37:10] holy spirit he's fighting all our
[37:11] battles he's
[37:12] he's already the war he's already
[37:14] promised a victory and we can read in
[37:16] the back of the book that he's already
[37:18] overcome
[37:18] but but but he wants us to put an action
[37:21] into it he wants us to put a purpose
[37:23] into it and
[37:24] and so joshua has already gone out and
[37:26] he's slain every enemy that they're
[37:27] coming up against and
[37:29] and yet these five major kings have run
[37:31] into this cave and they've hid
[37:32] and so joshua does a wise thing and he
[37:34] rolls stones in front of them
[37:36] as to starve them out and so there they
[37:39] are in a cave
[37:40] and and they're becoming weak and
[37:42] they're becoming they'll just open up
[37:44] the cave and
[37:45] and that's the way that we got to handle
[37:47] the devil you know if we keep feeding
[37:49] them the negativity and we keep feeding
[37:51] them the the the discrepancies that we
[37:53] have in our mind and we keep
[37:54] we keep feeding them the despair that
[37:56] we're in and we keep feeding them the
[37:57] woe is me
[37:58] and as brother jewel would say the wowzy
[38:00] woos if we keep feeding him that story
[38:02] then then he grows stronger and he goes
[38:04] bigger and and
[38:05] and he doesn't ever get weak in our mind
[38:07] but if we'll just roll a stone in front
[38:09] of him a little bit
[38:10] and just starve him out and then let the
[38:12] holy spirit guide us on how to handle
[38:14] him and
[38:14] and so he said chase after every enemy
[38:17] that we've conquered
[38:18] and follow them into the city because
[38:20] they will produce more of them and they
[38:22] will have children and those children
[38:23] will become our enemy and and so don't
[38:25] don't leave
[38:26] one don't leave one alive and many times
[38:29] our
[38:30] our affections get in the way and our
[38:32] reasoning gets in the way and
[38:33] we don't want to be hurtful to anybody
[38:35] and joshua didn't have that problem
[38:37] joshua was a man that knew where he
[38:39] stood and he he knew that
[38:41] that enemy is going to become my my
[38:43] child's enemy and that's going to become
[38:44] my wife sending me and that's going to
[38:45] become
[38:46] somebody in my church's enemy he said we
[38:48] must destroy every enemy out there but
[38:50] of course in our day we're not battling
[38:52] against flesh and blood but
[38:53] we're battling against principalities
[38:55] and powers and spiritual warfare in high
[38:57] places and
[38:58] and so we we want to let maybe you know
[39:00] the affections take over and we don't
[39:02] want to strike that thing so hard
[39:04] in the ministry but but realizing under
[39:06] a joshua ministry that it's our
[39:08] obligation and we're actually ordained
[39:10] to strike against that thing no matter
[39:12] how hard it is because it's gonna come
[39:14] back
[39:14] stronger and bigger than it was before
[39:17] and so joshua knew this and he would
[39:19] seek after these enemies and he would
[39:21] destroy them
[39:22] but but but tonight we want to just deal
[39:24] with the five and i know there's so much
[39:26] more we can cover in this but just in
[39:27] about 40 minutes if we could just
[39:29] sum up these five kings
[39:32] and joshua starves them out and he says
[39:34] it's time
[39:36] there's a time and a season for
[39:37] everything and many of us have had
[39:39] things that we've repressed in ourselves
[39:41] and
[39:42] and faith that we haven't been able to
[39:43] stand out on and prayers that haven't
[39:45] been answered yet but there's a time and
[39:47] a season for everything
[39:48] and and under the move of the holy
[39:50] spirit he'll direct us
[39:52] now it's time let's turn our attention
[39:54] to this cave and let's move the stone
[39:57] away and let's deal with these five
[39:58] kings in this cave right
[40:00] i don't think any of us in here want to
[40:02] leave anything undone in our life we
[40:04] know that
[40:05] that there's there's the king is coming
[40:07] soon
[40:08] and he's not coming for an imperfect
[40:10] bride or a partial bride or
[40:12] or just a halfway surrendered bride but
[40:14] he's coming for a perfect bride
[40:16] who believes a perfect word under a
[40:18] perfect ministry i believe we have that
[40:20] in this stage we've been delivered that
[40:22] in this age and i believe that we are
[40:24] that perfect church
[40:25] that's rising up and yes us weak in
[40:27] faith and
[40:28] maybe we don't seem like we fit the part
[40:30] sometimes but god thinks we do
[40:32] because god put it in us to overcome and
[40:34] so i don't really care what i think
[40:35] i care what he thinks and i i don't care
[40:37] what my narrative is i care what god's
[40:39] narrative is
[40:40] and so we find ourselves in the same
[40:43] condition as joshua's men of war
[40:46] and there they have these kings trapped
[40:48] in this cave and
[40:49] it's time to deal with them and i don't
[40:51] think we can probably get into this on a
[40:53] thursday night but
[40:54] it's time to deal with some things you
[40:56] know the devil has put a lot of lies in
[40:58] our life he's put a lot of untruths in
[41:00] front of us and he's put a lot of rocks
[41:02] in front of us and a lot of logs
[41:04] and he's jammed up our channels and i
[41:06] don't think there's probably one person
[41:08] sitting in this building tonight
[41:09] that hasn't had had the devil come to
[41:12] them and say you're not gonna make it
[41:13] right you know the rapture is gonna
[41:14] happen tomorrow and you're gonna find
[41:16] everybody's gone and it's not gonna be
[41:18] you and
[41:19] and you fell short just just short of
[41:21] the finish line right brother paul
[41:22] that's
[41:22] that's how he talks that's his dialect
[41:24] that's that's his move but there's a
[41:26] time to deal with that spirit
[41:28] there's a time to bring a confirmation
[41:31] in our life that we know who we are
[41:33] and and though though the world may fall
[41:35] away there's one going to make it
[41:37] brother brahman said you've got to
[41:38] possess that faith that it's you that
[41:40] that if there's just one if he's just
[41:42] going to come back for one soul for one
[41:44] believer
[41:45] it's going to be me i believe that
[41:48] that we are that church i believe it's
[41:51] not for another age coming i believe
[41:53] it's not
[41:54] we didn't miss it back in another age
[41:56] but we're right at the pivotal time
[41:58] we're at the finish line and so the
[42:00] devil's going to try to hit us with
[42:02] everything he's got with the hardest
[42:04] ammunition he's got and
[42:06] and the hardest the hardest battles we
[42:08] are going through right now
[42:11] don't look for a squeeze to come it's
[42:13] already here
[42:15] if you can't feel it then just hang out
[42:16] with us for a day or two and
[42:18] you'll see that the squeeze has already
[42:19] been happening to the
[42:21] it's forcing us into a position but
[42:24] under a joshua ministry
[42:26] everything's under control those men
[42:29] didn't fear those kings they
[42:31] they ran into that cave because they
[42:33] feared joshua and his men and that he
[42:35] hadn't lost one and that he hadn't
[42:37] he hadn't been defeated and he had never
[42:39] lost and he was never retreated he never
[42:41] backed up
[42:42] and i believe we're under the same
[42:43] headship in this age that we don't have
[42:45] to back up on what the devil tells us
[42:47] and
[42:47] and say that that prodigal is too far
[42:49] gone and and you just don't know what's
[42:50] been said and you don't know the
[42:51] situation there but don't back up on any
[42:53] bit of ground
[42:54] because you're under a joshua ministry
[42:57] in this generation that came to set
[43:00] the the wrongs right and to set the
[43:02] crooked straight into
[43:03] and to tie up every loose sin i believe
[43:05] that we know that we're in that time
[43:08] and it's time to deal with these five
[43:10] things brother branham would bring that
[43:11] out in the message
[43:12] uh uh the greatest battle ever fought
[43:15] right and the the you know we have the
[43:16] five senses right we have
[43:18] the five senses of the natural and then
[43:20] he would bring out the five gates or he
[43:21] would call them the five gates of the
[43:23] of the soul right
[43:27] and and he would he would he would tie
[43:29] this in together
[43:31] and so we just want to read can we read
[43:32] some quotes is that all right
[43:34] he says now in here there's there's one
[43:36] this is out of revelations chapter four
[43:38] part three now in here there's one two
[43:41] three four five
[43:42] attributes in this soul now you wanna
[43:44] write this down first one is imagination
[43:46] the second one is conscience the third
[43:47] one is memory
[43:48] the fourth one is reason the fifth one
[43:50] is affection
[43:52] now did you get them all if you don't
[43:53] then let me know and
[43:55] we'll get back to that see taste fell
[43:56] smear here smell here in the body
[43:59] that's open to the body but the soul is
[44:01] imagination conscience memory reason and
[44:03] affection
[44:04] is the senses of the attributes like the
[44:06] senses of the soul
[44:08] and the soul is the nature of the spirit
[44:10] that's on the inside
[44:12] because the soul only puts out an
[44:13] atmosphere of what's on the inside of
[44:15] you
[44:16] it takes the place of sanctification it
[44:18] sets in the same category there
[44:20] all right everybody got that that's what
[44:22] he said
[44:23] now to this gate there's there's only
[44:25] one gate
[44:27] and that's called self-will you're the
[44:30] boss of what goes in there
[44:32] and what does it do what is this the
[44:34] body must be washed
[44:36] the lava is sanctified here filled with
[44:38] the holy spirit here this becomes god's
[44:40] judgment seat again where god sits in
[44:42] your heart
[44:43] and if you do something wrong you say oh
[44:45] my i did wrong but i
[44:47] challenge you to let jesus christ come
[44:49] in here
[44:50] and try to do it one time now he's
[44:53] speaking of the doors to the heart
[44:54] remember that you
[44:55] you open every door to the heart and if
[44:57] you let jesus come in and
[44:58] the devil used to beat you up and
[45:00] remember he gives that scenario but i
[45:02] challenge you he says to let jesus
[45:04] and come in and then let the devil try
[45:06] that one time
[45:08] brother you'll be you'll be he'll be so
[45:10] condemned to back off and
[45:12] shake the head of that thing as certain
[45:14] as i'm standing here
[45:15] because he's holy listen i'm quoting
[45:17] scripture if you love them things that's
[45:19] the world things of the world
[45:20] it's because the love of god is not even
[45:22] in you
[45:23] how did how did it self-will
[45:27] why would you call that self-will
[45:29] brother brandon because it puts a man
[45:31] and a woman back again just like adam
[45:33] and eve at the garden of eden
[45:35] on what the two trees self-will this one
[45:38] is death
[45:38] this one is life self-will immoral free
[45:42] moral agency god
[45:43] placed the first man adam and eve right
[45:45] here on free moral agency
[45:47] he places you in the same place and the
[45:50] only way that you can get this thing
[45:52] fixed in here is your own self-will
[45:54] hallelujah your self-will and i know
[45:57] that we battle with this because i'm
[45:59] i'm in the same boat well it's not by my
[46:02] will it's by his and
[46:04] but the power of choice remember we're
[46:06] talking about the weapon
[46:07] of choice and he says you have to
[46:10] will to do god's will
[46:13] that might be a fridge quote you have to
[46:15] will
[46:16] to do god's will you have to get rid of
[46:19] your own will
[46:20] to let god's will come in for this is
[46:23] the only
[46:24] channel that leads to the heart
[46:27] you have to will to surrender that to
[46:29] god god's not
[46:31] not god's not just going to come in and
[46:32] take it but it that's the power of
[46:34] choice that we have is to surrender
[46:36] ourselves and our own self-will
[46:39] and let god have his way and now that
[46:41] sounds real simple
[46:42] but that's the very thing that got eve
[46:44] that's the very thing that will get
[46:46] everybody that falls
[46:47] short but there is a people who will be
[46:50] able to surrender
[46:51] everything that they are to surrender
[46:53] every self-will and let i could ask
[46:55] everyone one by one and we could go
[46:57] through situations that we've been in
[46:58] and
[46:59] and see where our self will has gotten
[47:00] us and it hasn't gotten us in the right
[47:02] place
[47:03] it hasn't gotten us on top it didn't it
[47:05] didn't win us anything
[47:07] but but by now i think we've been
[47:08] through enough battles and we've been
[47:10] through enough heat and we've been
[47:11] through enough fire and we've been
[47:12] refined just so much that we know that
[47:14] our will is not going to get us there
[47:16] so our self-will has the ability to turn
[47:19] it over to god
[47:21] to turn over our imagination to turn
[47:24] over our memory and our conscience and
[47:26] our reason and our affections and say
[47:28] lord it's not my will but thine be done
[47:30] and i'm sure that the
[47:31] the that jesus there in the garden went
[47:34] through the very same thing that we're
[47:36] feeling now and
[47:37] lord if it be possible let this cup pass
[47:39] for me
[47:40] but he was ordained for that position in
[47:43] time
[47:43] he was ordained to to hang on the tree
[47:46] he was ordained to take the sins of the
[47:47] world
[47:48] and we're ordained to finish this word
[47:50] of god
[47:51] we are ordained to bring a culmination
[47:53] to everything that has been prophesied
[47:56] everything that has been preached
[47:57] everything that we are the fulfillment
[47:59] of the prophecy of god himself
[48:02] in this building tonight i believe i'm
[48:04] looking at fulfillments of god's word
[48:07] when god made a promise it's being
[48:09] fulfilled in this building tonight
[48:11] but because we are surrendering our
[48:13] self-will
[48:14] now he draws these five kings out to
[48:17] this one cave mouth and brother bam says
[48:19] that that is the entrance
[48:21] and it is self-will you'll never be able
[48:24] to overcome your imagination
[48:26] or your reason or or your your
[48:29] intellectual conception of something
[48:30] you'll never be able to overcome that
[48:32] without surrendering your self-will
[48:36] our weapon is choice
[48:40] can we read some more god when god made
[48:43] man
[48:45] the devil took his head and god chose
[48:47] his heart the devil through his
[48:49] imagination makes him imagine anything
[48:51] gives him intellectual conceptions of
[48:53] the scripture but
[48:54] god gets in his heart and leads him by
[48:57] the spirit
[48:58] makes him believe things that his
[48:59] intellectual don't know nothing about
[49:01] that makes me feel a little religious
[49:03] when i when i say that he says
[49:05] because there's things that we believe
[49:07] that are unexplainable
[49:10] and the devil wants to trap you in a
[49:11] corner and and demand that you explain
[49:14] how you believe what you believe and and
[49:17] and if you don't surrender yourself will
[49:19] you'll be stuck in that corner
[49:21] and you'll be stuck dealing with that
[49:22] cave for a long time but there's a time
[49:25] to deal with it we do not have to answer
[49:28] scientifically anything that the devil
[49:30] brings before us because we are not
[49:32] governed
[49:32] by the laws of this land i am not
[49:36] governed by these senses and these five
[49:38] gates and these
[49:38] because we have another sense and that
[49:41] sense is faith and it can override
[49:43] all of these senses when we apply all of
[49:46] our all of our focus
[49:47] and all of our energy and we apply all
[49:49] of our mind into that
[49:50] sixth sense it will overcome all the
[49:53] other five
[49:53] and all the other five natural ones in
[49:56] and though you can't explain how you
[49:57] were healed and how that cancer just
[49:59] fell off your body
[50:00] try to explain that to somebody you
[50:02] can't but but the problem is the devil's
[50:05] pushed people into a corner to try to
[50:07] explain
[50:08] a supernatural realm you tell me how
[50:11] that happened and
[50:12] and and if we don't if we don't know
[50:13] better we'll just back up in a corner
[50:15] and we'll begin to
[50:16] to back up and to back up and before you
[50:18] know it he's he's got the upper hand on
[50:20] us and he's he's overtaken something
[50:22] and all the while joshua joshua was
[50:25] standing there next to us saying
[50:26] just draw the sword just draw the sword
[50:29] i
[50:30] you've i've already defeated everything
[50:32] around him but you've got to defeat this
[50:34] one because it's in your case
[50:37] i i know that everybody in here is just
[50:39] as frustrated as i've been
[50:40] it's time to get the devil out of our
[50:42] cave it's time to get all of these all
[50:45] of these unbeliefs and all these doubts
[50:47] and all these regrets and
[50:48] and everything that we go through as
[50:50] humans it's time to draw them out of our
[50:51] cave
[50:52] and it's time to deal with them i
[50:54] believe we have the anointing it's on
[50:57] the earth right now i believe
[50:58] i believe the angels are commissioned to
[51:00] deal with these five kings that we have
[51:03] that have been living inside a body that
[51:05] is not theirs
[51:06] they have been driven into a cave that
[51:08] is not theirs and it's time to draw them
[51:11] out
[51:12] joshua said okay now now it's time and
[51:15] he said mighty men of war
[51:16] come and put your foot on the neck of
[51:19] these five kings
[51:20] i don't know about you but there's been
[51:21] many times in my life when i love to put
[51:23] the foot on this imagination
[51:25] when i love to put the foot on this you
[51:27] ever get into a situation maybe with
[51:29] somebody else in the church and before
[51:30] you know it you've
[51:31] you've built this whole story in your
[51:33] mind that that brother didn't
[51:34] brother paul you didn't shake my hand
[51:36] last time i was here so brother paul
[51:37] must really hate me
[51:40] you know i bet he's talking to his
[51:41] brother about me and i bet now ben
[51:43] doesn't like me and
[51:44] i bet it's just going around and you
[51:46] know what brother paul just didn't even
[51:47] see my hand out
[51:48] this example he always shakes my hand
[51:51] but you see
[51:52] that's how the devil works and then
[51:54] before you know it you can't sit there
[51:56] and be in fellowship and you can't be in
[51:57] peace in the church because
[51:59] there's something that's happened that
[52:01] nobody's aware of but you
[52:05] and that's how the devil works and then
[52:08] you'll withdraw
[52:08] i'll withdraw from paul and now i'm not
[52:10] going to shake paul's hand
[52:12] well now paul's going to think oh well
[52:13] he's definitely got something against me
[52:16] you see how the spirit of division works
[52:17] in a church and then before you know it
[52:20] the song leader is trying to have to
[52:21] plow through that spirit of division
[52:22] even to make some joy come into the
[52:24] sanctuary
[52:25] i know we don't deal with that here but
[52:27] i've just seen it happen in my life
[52:30] and then the pastor comes out and he
[52:31] wants to preach and he can't hardly get
[52:33] it get to preaching because there's so
[52:34] much contention between
[52:36] something that's not real
[52:39] but but the prophet taught us that the
[52:41] spirit of god will bring a true reality
[52:43] to the church
[52:44] it will bring a true reality to our mind
[52:47] that we can look at things
[52:48] how god sees them and we can look and
[52:50] say brother paul maybe you didn't shake
[52:52] my hand but i'm going to shake your hand
[52:53] anyway
[52:55] you know why because perfect love will
[52:58] cast
[52:58] out all fear i don't have to fear
[53:01] whether paul likes me or not because i
[53:03] know because i have perfect love for him
[53:05] and he's got perfect love for me and
[53:07] even though the devil would love to
[53:08] wedge himself
[53:09] in between us he can't because we have
[53:12] perfect love
[53:13] and if the whole church can get that
[53:15] unity amongst themselves
[53:17] what could we do for the lord i believe
[53:20] we all have a burden to do something for
[53:22] the lord it's the anointing of the age
[53:23] we want to get in the flood we want to
[53:25] get in the stream we see the power of
[53:27] god moving and it's anointing and it's
[53:29] placing
[53:29] and we want to be in that stream but
[53:32] perfect love has got to be our guide
[53:35] we'll never get there by our own will
[53:37] we've got to surrender it
[53:38] we've got to surrender that will there's
[53:41] a battleground for everything i just
[53:43] read that quote where brother branham
[53:44] said that the devil chose
[53:46] he chose the mind as his battleground
[53:50] in this context of scripture the mouth
[53:51] of this cave is the battleground
[53:54] it's our self-will the holy spirit is
[53:57] drawing it out
[53:59] it's drawing it out and it's our it's
[54:01] it's our obligation to deal with it
[54:04] amen we can't just let it get back in
[54:06] the cave
[54:07] because you know what it'll get back in
[54:08] the cave and he'll start getting
[54:09] stronger
[54:10] he'll start growing bolder i know this
[54:12] is pretty sunday school stuff but
[54:14] just what the lord gave me
[54:18] there's a battle front where they meet
[54:21] and test their powers where each army
[54:23] tested strength and
[54:24] against the other army a mutual meeting
[54:26] place now don't miss this
[54:28] when this great battle started on earth
[54:30] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[54:33] there had to be a place selected for the
[54:35] battle to begin and for the battle to
[54:37] rage
[54:38] and the battlegrounds begin in the human
[54:40] mind
[54:41] there's where the battle starts the
[54:43] human mind was chosen for the place of
[54:46] battle
[54:47] where where it was to begin and that is
[54:50] because that decisions are
[54:52] made from the mind right simple enough
[54:54] right
[54:55] right you think we could just well i'm
[54:57] just not going to decide to do that
[55:00] i'm just not going to decide to to be
[55:03] weak in faith
[55:05] but it's just not that simple is it
[55:09] i think it's more of more of a personal
[55:12] thing
[55:12] maybe for me tonight but but the devil
[55:16] can work
[55:17] through people he can work through you
[55:20] and there's nothing
[55:21] i hate more than when i realize that the
[55:24] devil has worked through me
[55:26] and i've made a mistake and i've said
[55:28] the wrong thing and i've
[55:29] i i've i've maybe even even unknowingly
[55:32] turned a cold shoulder
[55:34] or or or said something the wrong way or
[55:36] or set something against somebody or
[55:39] and and when you get that realization
[55:40] that the devil has used you
[55:42] there's nothing more painful for a
[55:44] believer to know that i let him get the
[55:46] best of me i let him get the best
[55:48] of me but but there's a time to deal
[55:50] with it
[55:51] and i think we've all been through
[55:52] different scenarios and different things
[55:54] where we know that the devil has got the
[55:56] best of us
[55:57] but under the joshua ministry he's
[55:59] called out those five kings
[56:01] he said we don't have to let them back
[56:03] in the cave we don't have to let them
[56:04] back where
[56:05] where they where they can reside and
[56:07] where they can have peace and and and
[56:09] and i just want to point out that this
[56:10] is not their cave
[56:12] you know the devil doesn't have a domain
[56:14] he doesn't have a home he doesn't have
[56:16] anywhere to go he doesn't have keys he
[56:18] doesn't have a house
[56:19] he doesn't have anywhere unless we give
[56:21] it to him he must have something to work
[56:23] through
[56:24] he's got to have somebody to work
[56:25] through he's got to have lips to work
[56:27] through
[56:27] just like the lord's got to have feet to
[56:29] walk and he's going to have hands to
[56:31] lift and
[56:31] he's got to have voices to praise but
[56:34] the devil has to have the same thing
[56:36] so our weapon is choice
[56:40] who are we going to let use us who are
[56:42] we going to let use us
[56:43] and i know we're in here tonight because
[56:45] we want to do something for the lord
[56:46] we want to be in his perfect will we
[56:48] want to walk in his perfect glide and we
[56:50] don't want to miss anything that the
[56:51] lord has for us
[56:52] so our weapon is choice and so maybe
[56:55] we've let these five kings dwell in our
[56:57] cave and
[56:57] they've been in there for maybe 20 years
[56:59] or five years or just
[57:00] just a few years but it's time to draw
[57:03] them out and to deal with them and
[57:04] joshua calls his men
[57:06] back and he says put your foot on the
[57:08] necks of these kings
[57:09] now now the the devil has messed with
[57:11] you your entire life and he's used your
[57:14] memory against you
[57:15] and he's used your imagination against
[57:16] you but under this commission you have
[57:19] been given the authority
[57:20] to place your foot upon the neck of that
[57:23] imagination it's not
[57:25] it's not it's not just for another age
[57:27] gone by that we read about in the bible
[57:29] but it's right now it's today that we
[57:31] have the power
[57:32] under this message to draw those kings
[57:35] out of the cave
[57:36] and say it's time for me to put my neck
[57:38] on top of you
[57:39] it's time for a perfect church to rise
[57:41] up it's time for a perfect believer to
[57:44] accept a perfect word
[57:45] under a perfect prophet and decide that
[57:48] this is the truth
[57:49] i'm not going back and i'm not
[57:51] retreating and i'm not letting you back
[57:53] in that cave but i'll pull you out if i
[57:55] have to die
[57:56] fighting but i've already been promised
[57:58] that i will overcome you
[57:59] i will put you under my feet i will put
[58:02] you under subjection
[58:04] i will put you where you belong because
[58:06] i am anointed to do it
[58:08] in this age not in another age
[58:11] in this age the hardest stage the most
[58:14] evil age the darkest age i have been
[58:17] anointed
[58:18] you have been anointed to defeat every
[58:20] enemy that comes in front of you
[58:22] now i know we get high in faith and it
[58:24] sounds good but then monday rolls around
[58:26] and we
[58:27] we think oh we're back in the corner
[58:28] again draw that king out of the cave
[58:32] it's time to deal with it friends we
[58:34] don't have much time left and i believe
[58:36] it's the time
[58:40] he's got to have something to work
[58:42] through
[58:43] remember remember when when jesus was
[58:46] preaching his sermon
[58:47] and and he felt a pull in his heart
[58:50] and there was a crazy man praying and he
[58:53] crosses the sea
[58:55] and he steps one foot on the sea and the
[58:58] devil realizes
[59:00] my time's up i pray that the devil
[59:04] inside
[59:05] that has been warring in our mind would
[59:07] realize that tonight
[59:08] time's up jesus has set his foot on the
[59:11] shore
[59:12] time's up and see the devil's got to
[59:15] have something to work through he's got
[59:16] to have a power to work through a life
[59:18] source to work through
[59:19] he doesn't have life of his own he's got
[59:22] to work through somebody
[59:24] even if it's a bunch of pigs he's got to
[59:27] go
[59:27] somewhere why don't you put him where he
[59:29] belongs he does not belong in your cave
[59:32] he does not belong in your mind he does
[59:34] not belong in your home
[59:35] he belongs in a bunch of pigs that they
[59:38] couldn't stand them either so they drove
[59:40] themselves off a cliff
[59:41] too long have we made a home for the
[59:43] devil where he feels comfortable
[59:45] where we're scared to upset him and and
[59:47] we think that we're going to upset the
[59:49] devil but i say draw him out of the cave
[59:52] no more devil do you have a place in my
[59:55] home no more do you have a place in my
[59:57] mind
[59:57] god said i can have a sound mind the
[1:00:00] power
[1:00:01] of a sound mind to have faith in god's
[1:00:04] word you know the devil only has
[1:00:06] one weapon and it's unbelief
[1:00:09] if we can overcome his one weapon you
[1:00:12] already know how he's gonna you know if
[1:00:13] i have a sword you don't know exactly
[1:00:15] how i'm gonna come at you
[1:00:16] i might swing this way and maybe maybe
[1:00:18] throw a hook in there
[1:00:20] or maybe kick the devil's only got one
[1:00:23] one weapon
[1:00:24] you know he's gonna attack you on the
[1:00:26] authority of the word
[1:00:28] you already know where the battleground
[1:00:30] is it's on the authority
[1:00:32] of the word and i believe in our day
[1:00:34] with these eyes
[1:00:35] we've witnessed more things more
[1:00:38] authority in god's word than any
[1:00:40] generation before us i believe
[1:00:42] we have we have seen god in the
[1:00:44] miraculous
[1:00:45] but if he never did another miracle in
[1:00:47] my life i would know that there's
[1:00:49] absolute authority in his word i would
[1:00:52] know that this
[1:00:53] will defeat the devil anytime any place
[1:00:57] anywhere you just tried and see friends
[1:01:00] you just put this word before you as you
[1:01:02] go
[1:01:02] you know how israel did it first they
[1:01:04] would sing a song
[1:01:06] first they would praise the lord and
[1:01:08] then they would put the ark of the
[1:01:09] covenant
[1:01:10] out before him and they would go
[1:01:11] anywhere that they wanted to go you know
[1:01:13] why because there's authority
[1:01:15] when you worship the word
[1:01:18] our praises are not to worship some
[1:01:20] building or some wood or some stage or
[1:01:22] some piano
[1:01:23] is to worship the word which is him
[1:01:27] which is the one who came and he said
[1:01:29] it's time
[1:01:30] to deal with these enemies in your life
[1:01:34] you've been given the authority put your
[1:01:36] foot on his neck it feels good
[1:01:38] go ahead put your foot just yeah
[1:01:42] remember that devil that tried to get
[1:01:44] you to stop coming tonight
[1:01:48] remember that devil that's been asked
[1:01:49] you if you had a week like i had
[1:01:51] remember the devil that's been at you
[1:01:52] all week
[1:01:54] put your foot on his neck
[1:01:55] [Applause]
[1:02:00] when god walked with just man alone by
[1:02:02] himself he had favor with god
[1:02:04] but when man begin to multiply and begin
[1:02:07] to get others and others and others they
[1:02:09] begin
[1:02:09] satan having more of a range to work in
[1:02:14] this man might believe a little bit
[1:02:15] leaning that way and the other one
[1:02:17] a little bit this way then when satan
[1:02:19] comes in he just
[1:02:20] fires it on then it becomes this and
[1:02:22] that and imaginations begin to come
[1:02:24] great
[1:02:25] and then corruption sets in brother
[1:02:27] graham's talking this is in the message
[1:02:28] the ark he's talking about noah's day
[1:02:30] but i just i just felt that that was
[1:02:32] appropriate
[1:02:34] he's got to have something to work in
[1:02:37] and when it was just adam and god there
[1:02:39] was it was perfect harmony
[1:02:43] it was it was perfect communion he's got
[1:02:46] to have
[1:02:47] something to work through something to
[1:02:49] work in and he and the more that man
[1:02:51] grew and the more the
[1:02:52] intelligent they got and the more they
[1:02:53] built and the more they conquered and
[1:02:55] the more they
[1:02:56] the more they they got civilized the
[1:02:59] more
[1:02:59] smarter they got satan had a playground
[1:03:03] to work through
[1:03:05] but there's been a promise in our age to
[1:03:08] be restored
[1:03:10] to be restored back to where it was at
[1:03:12] the beginning when adam walked with god
[1:03:14] in the cool of the evening and he heard
[1:03:16] his
[1:03:16] he heard his voice and he felt his
[1:03:18] worship and god the creator who created
[1:03:21] all things by his power through his
[1:03:22] spoken word
[1:03:24] and everything that is is the word of
[1:03:26] god made manifest
[1:03:27] the entire word was made and how we do
[1:03:31] error when we try to ignore god's word
[1:03:33] or try to limit god's power by our own
[1:03:36] imagination how we do error
[1:03:39] when we try to limit god's word by our
[1:03:42] imagination
[1:03:44] i just that quote really dealt with me
[1:03:47] because it's me
[1:03:51] god's power is not limited god god's
[1:03:53] authority is not limited in his
[1:03:55] his ability to heal and his ability to
[1:03:57] save and his ability to reach out and
[1:03:59] catch that lost loved one
[1:04:00] his power is not limited but it's by my
[1:04:03] imagination that his power is limited
[1:04:05] and
[1:04:06] and i believe it's time to deal with
[1:04:07] that spirit so let's just call he says
[1:04:09] the first one is imagination
[1:04:11] let's just call imagination o king come
[1:04:13] out
[1:04:14] and joshua says come out of the cave
[1:04:18] and joshua doesn't do it himself he
[1:04:20] calls the men
[1:04:22] and he says put your foot on his neck
[1:04:26] where's authority i'm on top of him
[1:04:31] he can't work through me anymore amen
[1:04:33] and sometimes we just got to tell the
[1:04:35] devil
[1:04:35] you're not going to work through me
[1:04:37] anymore and you've taken my imagination
[1:04:40] and you've built this false narrative
[1:04:42] and you've built this impossible
[1:04:44] situation
[1:04:45] but what is that to god what is that to
[1:04:48] god in his power that he can't move that
[1:04:50] mountain
[1:04:50] and what is that mountain before god
[1:04:52] that it won't become a plane before
[1:04:54] him but take that imagination out of the
[1:04:56] cave and put your foot on top of his
[1:04:58] neck and say no more
[1:04:59] i'm casting down imagination
[1:05:03] it belongs under my feet it does not
[1:05:05] belong
[1:05:06] dominating my thoughts and dominating my
[1:05:08] mind but i'm gonna cast it down
[1:05:10] by the power of the holy spirit see
[1:05:12] without the holy ghost
[1:05:14] these things are not possible without a
[1:05:17] joshua in your life
[1:05:19] these things are not possible if you're
[1:05:22] trying to do it by your own will and
[1:05:23] your own abilities and trying to
[1:05:25] overcome by your strength
[1:05:27] it will never happen but by the power of
[1:05:29] the holy ghost
[1:05:30] the holy ghost has claimed dominion over
[1:05:33] that cave
[1:05:34] and he said it's time to roll away the
[1:05:36] stone and it's time to deal with these
[1:05:38] things that we've tucked away
[1:05:40] back in the cave and it's time to put
[1:05:42] them under subjection
[1:05:45] that's our calling in this hour
[1:05:51] amen limit god's power
[1:05:54] by our own imagination
[1:05:59] we don't have time to go through each
[1:06:00] thing and i know that everybody's well
[1:06:02] taught here and you know
[1:06:03] where these gates end up and but it's
[1:06:05] but but
[1:06:07] i believe in this age satan has brought
[1:06:09] a challenge to the bride of christ
[1:06:12] did these things really happen
[1:06:16] did the lord really deal with the
[1:06:17] prophet that way
[1:06:19] did those miracles really take place did
[1:06:22] those things happen exactly in that
[1:06:24] order in exactly that way
[1:06:26] and and and did did he really meet you
[1:06:30] do you really know the lord is this
[1:06:32] really the truth or
[1:06:33] or was that some and before you know it
[1:06:34] he's attacked every memory that you have
[1:06:38] of having a relationship with the lord
[1:06:40] and he's attacked he's attacked every
[1:06:42] everything that you found to be a
[1:06:44] foundation he's attacked well did that
[1:06:45] really happen
[1:06:47] did that really there and he'll try to
[1:06:49] he'll try to just just fog that memory a
[1:06:51] little bit
[1:06:53] i found that that was interesting that
[1:06:54] that was one of the one of the symptoms
[1:06:56] of kovid was to a memory fog
[1:06:59] because you see right at that time the
[1:07:00] devil was trying to bring a memory fog
[1:07:03] across the bride of christ and say well
[1:07:04] did these things really happen
[1:07:06] was that really the way it was but i
[1:07:09] believe it's time to deal with that
[1:07:10] memory spirit
[1:07:11] hallelujah amen
[1:07:16] i was there when it happened to me i was
[1:07:18] there
[1:07:19] kind of like job right remember he went
[1:07:21] through a little memory fog and he had
[1:07:23] found himself
[1:07:24] down in the slumps and down at the mouth
[1:07:26] of a cave of self-will
[1:07:28] and and and his friends were saying well
[1:07:30] that you know just give it up
[1:07:32] you know it wasn't what you thought it
[1:07:34] was why don't you just make make
[1:07:36] something of your life from this moment
[1:07:38] on and why don't you just would just
[1:07:39] turn it around it's not too late to turn
[1:07:41] it around but job knew that there had
[1:07:43] there was something that had taken place
[1:07:45] there was a relationship with
[1:07:47] with god at some point that he had that
[1:07:49] was so strong
[1:07:50] and even though satan came against his
[1:07:52] memory with everything he had
[1:07:53] job knew there was something that
[1:07:56] happened one time
[1:07:57] i knew i used to have a relationship
[1:07:59] with a higher being out there and i knew
[1:08:01] it came
[1:08:02] through his word and i knew it came
[1:08:04] through fellowship and
[1:08:05] and job had found himself there on an
[1:08:07] ash heap
[1:08:10] wondering is it real is is he really out
[1:08:13] there
[1:08:14] and then he's got his best friends to
[1:08:15] come and whittle down on that memory a
[1:08:18] little bit more
[1:08:18] say no that never happened or no that
[1:08:20] wasn't real or no you never felt that or
[1:08:22] you were just emotional or you were just
[1:08:24] caught up in the affections of what was
[1:08:26] going on and
[1:08:27] that didn't really happen and job just
[1:08:28] began to get foggy in his memory
[1:08:31] amen but what job didn't know
[1:08:35] was that god had commissioned satan to
[1:08:37] do that
[1:08:39] because god had so much trust in job
[1:08:44] that he said hit him with everything
[1:08:45] you've got he won't forsake me
[1:08:48] now this might not mean much to you
[1:08:49] looking at it like job but what about
[1:08:51] you tonight what about this church
[1:08:53] tonight
[1:08:54] god has had so much confidence in this
[1:08:56] group of people that he said hit him
[1:08:58] with everything you've got they'll not
[1:09:00] forsake me they might have a memory fog
[1:09:03] and they might go through a battle but
[1:09:04] they won't turn their back on me
[1:09:06] because i know what's in him because i
[1:09:09] know i met job and we talked and we
[1:09:11] fellowshipped and i placed a seed within
[1:09:14] him
[1:09:14] that he cannot turn his back on me job
[1:09:17] couldn't do it with all the demons in
[1:09:19] hell against him
[1:09:20] he could not turn his back on god
[1:09:22] because god was already in him
[1:09:25] god had beat satan to the punch
[1:09:29] what about you tonight why are you still
[1:09:31] here
[1:09:32] why are you still believing because god
[1:09:34] already put a seed within you
[1:09:36] that no matter how many demons no matter
[1:09:39] how much hell comes against you
[1:09:41] you cannot turn your back on god you
[1:09:43] cannot turn your back on the truth
[1:09:45] because it's already been planted in
[1:09:47] there that you will
[1:09:49] see it all the way through we will stop
[1:09:52] short on the finish line we will not
[1:09:54] stop just out of breath when we're
[1:09:56] almost there
[1:09:57] we will make it all the way because we
[1:09:59] know
[1:10:00] i was there when the sons of god shouted
[1:10:03] for joy
[1:10:04] i was there when the morning star sang i
[1:10:06] was there when the spirit came
[1:10:08] i was there when the miracles happened i
[1:10:11] was there in those dark times when i
[1:10:14] overcame
[1:10:16] you can't turn your back on it it's too
[1:10:19] late
[1:10:20] god already beat satan's doubts to the
[1:10:23] punch
[1:10:24] he placed within you the seed of victory
[1:10:28] and no matter
[1:10:29] the wiles of the greatest enemy could
[1:10:31] come against you
[1:10:32] you will not turn your back on god
[1:10:37] you might have memory fog for a season
[1:10:39] but you
[1:10:40] won't turn your back on god you might in
[1:10:43] your own mind
[1:10:44] say i i give up i'm walking away
[1:10:48] this is not for me
[1:10:51] it never was real but in your heart of
[1:10:54] hearts
[1:10:56] god got there first before there ever
[1:10:59] was a flesh
[1:11:01] before there ever was an atom before
[1:11:03] there ever was a a particle in the air
[1:11:06] god got to your soul first and he placed
[1:11:09] within there a seed to overcome every
[1:11:12] self-will
[1:11:13] and by overcoming every self-will we can
[1:11:15] overcome every imagination
[1:11:17] every reason it's in
[1:11:20] our power this is the time to deal with
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:25] if i get a little excited but in my mind
[1:11:28] walking up here i said this is going to
[1:11:29] be more of a teaching message but when
[1:11:30] the lord takes over
[1:11:31] amen no man has a right to preach the
[1:11:35] gospel no
[1:11:36] person has a right to call themselves a
[1:11:38] christian
[1:11:39] until they can go back to a certain time
[1:11:41] in their life
[1:11:42] where they could come on that sacred
[1:11:44] sands at the back side of the desert
[1:11:46] where they know that they have
[1:11:47] met god all the infidels in the world
[1:11:50] and all these intellectual giants
[1:11:52] taking the bible and explaining away all
[1:11:55] the days of miracles
[1:11:57] their past there's no such a thing as
[1:11:59] divine healing
[1:12:00] all this stuff like speaking with
[1:12:02] tongues interpretation of tongues and
[1:12:04] gifts of healing
[1:12:05] and the baptism of the holy spirit now
[1:12:07] brother branham was preaching about this
[1:12:08] in 1960
[1:12:10] what does it mean for us today they can
[1:12:13] slip
[1:12:14] in and take your mind and twist you in
[1:12:16] such a way until they can take that away
[1:12:19] from your memory
[1:12:21] they can explain it away i want you to
[1:12:24] get this
[1:12:26] and don't ever let it pass from you but
[1:12:27] if a man's ever stood on that sacred
[1:12:30] sands at the back side of the desert
[1:12:31] when he meets god face to face
[1:12:34] there's not enough devils in hell could
[1:12:36] take that away from him he knows he
[1:12:38] met god he knows he's had an
[1:12:41] experience he talked to god regardless
[1:12:44] of what the opposition is he can say
[1:12:46] from that time something changed me
[1:12:52] no matter what memory comes against you
[1:12:55] you have
[1:12:56] the authority to put that memory under
[1:12:59] your foot
[1:13:01] every condemnation every sin of the past
[1:13:04] every mistake every regret every memory
[1:13:07] that the devil would use against you
[1:13:09] you have the authority to put it under
[1:13:12] your foot
[1:13:12] and by god's grace that memory will be
[1:13:15] destroyed
[1:13:16] and you will never remember it again i
[1:13:19] can't wait till we get over there
[1:13:21] you know what it's going to be like when
[1:13:22] we don't have one regret we don't have
[1:13:24] one one thing that we wish we wouldn't
[1:13:26] have said or
[1:13:27] wish we wouldn't have did or wish we
[1:13:28] would have acted this way when we get
[1:13:29] over there
[1:13:30] that's why he said their perfect piece
[1:13:36] because that memory is under our feet
[1:13:40] it's time it's time friends we're not
[1:13:42] going to have time to deal with
[1:13:43] with all these things but maybe we'll
[1:13:45] come back and deal with it
[1:13:49] but brother braham says what we need is
[1:13:51] to wait till we hear the voice of god as
[1:13:53] individuals
[1:13:55] every man and woman in this convention
[1:13:57] no matter if it's jim jones or the rest
[1:13:59] of them that's with you
[1:14:00] if they don't do it you do it anyhow
[1:14:03] you pull yourself back in the cave and
[1:14:06] wait there
[1:14:07] until god speaks to you don't you move
[1:14:10] he will do it don't you move
[1:14:14] he will do it hold your position
[1:14:17] this is a time to stand this is not a
[1:14:20] time to run
[1:14:20] this is not a time to grow weary this is
[1:14:23] a time to hold
[1:14:24] right where we're at i know
[1:14:27] this message is the truth does that
[1:14:30] change that satan comes against me
[1:14:33] no but i know this message is the truth
[1:14:36] i know i'm a son of god i know that god
[1:14:39] loves me i know that his word is supreme
[1:14:42] authority
[1:14:43] does that change the enemy coming
[1:14:44] against me no he's going to fight me
[1:14:46] harder
[1:14:46] but i know that's where job got the
[1:14:50] revelation because god
[1:14:52] says he knows he knows try him on every
[1:14:55] angle
[1:14:56] try him on every hand take his loved
[1:14:58] ones take his money
[1:14:59] take his house take the shelter over his
[1:15:02] head
[1:15:03] take his health he knows
[1:15:06] and i would ask ourselves tonight do we
[1:15:08] know have we
[1:15:10] met god on the sacred sands and we know
[1:15:12] we've had a real
[1:15:13] genuine experience with the lord because
[1:15:15] he's still giving out experiences
[1:15:17] he's still giving out salvation he's
[1:15:19] still filling with the holy ghost
[1:15:21] but we've got to get it while he's here
[1:15:25] he knew and that was the only reason
[1:15:28] he could overcome that's right the
[1:15:30] revelation shook him i can't lose
[1:15:33] because i know i was there
[1:15:36] when they shouted for glory i was there
[1:15:39] before this time was ever in existence
[1:15:42] brother ram said the christian has not
[1:15:44] one worry in the world
[1:15:45] they should be the most freest happiest
[1:15:48] people in the world
[1:15:49] because there's nothing you can't
[1:15:52] lose that's a prophetic promise
[1:15:56] you can't lose and i'm not just pumping
[1:16:00] you up so you feel good i believe we
[1:16:01] covered this you've got to meet god
[1:16:04] on the sacred sands and when you had an
[1:16:06] experience with god
[1:16:07] and god moves something inside your life
[1:16:09] you can't lose
[1:16:11] there's not a devil that can take you
[1:16:12] down there's not a cancer that can take
[1:16:15] you down
[1:16:15] there's not a depression that can take
[1:16:17] you down oh it might affect you it might
[1:16:19] plague you and
[1:16:20] you might be down on your luck and you
[1:16:21] might be down in your body but you
[1:16:23] cannot lose god can't lose you more than
[1:16:27] he can lose half of himself
[1:16:34] we've got to we've got to stop giving
[1:16:36] him room to work with us
[1:16:38] that's right amen it's time to deal with
[1:16:41] some things we know we've let satan work
[1:16:43] with us
[1:16:44] right we've know we let him use us in in
[1:16:48] in
[1:16:48] in our time in our efforts we're all
[1:16:51] guilty friends but it's time
[1:16:53] to deal with it
[1:16:56] if we could turn the scripture
[1:16:57] revelations 20
[1:17:01] in the first verse and i saw an angel
[1:17:03] come down from heaven
[1:17:05] having the key of the bottomless pit in
[1:17:07] a great chain in his hand
[1:17:08] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[1:17:11] serpent which is the devil and satan
[1:17:13] bound him a thousand years and cast him
[1:17:16] into the bottomless pit
[1:17:18] and shut him up and set a seal upon him
[1:17:20] that he should deceive the nations
[1:17:23] no more till the thousand years should
[1:17:25] be fulfilled
[1:17:26] and after that he must be loosed for a
[1:17:28] season now
[1:17:29] i read that scripture and it brings me
[1:17:31] rejoicing it brings me joy because
[1:17:33] he shall not have authority or dominion
[1:17:37] or a voice or a place to work and you
[1:17:39] know brother man said that chain is not
[1:17:41] like a log chain it wasn't like a
[1:17:43] binding chain
[1:17:44] but it was a chain of circumstance i
[1:17:46] believe we know that
[1:17:47] and later he would say that that chain
[1:17:48] of circumstances because the devil
[1:17:51] didn't have anything to work with he
[1:17:53] didn't have anybody to work through
[1:17:54] he didn't have a mind to occupy he
[1:17:56] didn't have a mouth to occupy he didn't
[1:17:58] have hands to occupy because the people
[1:18:00] of god
[1:18:01] got to a place where they drew him out
[1:18:03] of the cave entirely
[1:18:07] you don't have any more to work with
[1:18:09] with me devil you know what every time
[1:18:12] he works and i see him working and i see
[1:18:14] him using me
[1:18:15] you've just exposed another weakness you
[1:18:18] don't have any more to work there
[1:18:20] you don't have another you don't have
[1:18:22] another breath in there
[1:18:24] because we've been given authority to
[1:18:26] cast him down
[1:18:28] we don't have to take it in there we
[1:18:29] don't have to let him have dominion in
[1:18:31] there
[1:18:31] but we have been given authority to
[1:18:34] chain him down by circumstance
[1:18:36] the church that's on earth is redeemed
[1:18:38] and right in the presence
[1:18:40] of christ so he has nothing he can work
[1:18:42] on
[1:18:43] so it's not a chain as i said a log
[1:18:45] chain it's a chain of circumstance and
[1:18:47] he has
[1:18:48] nothing he can do he's helpless
[1:18:51] he's hopeless just waiting for the
[1:18:54] resurrection of the subjects
[1:18:58] that really puts the devil in his good
[1:18:59] place right he's helpless
[1:19:02] he's hopeless there's nothing he can do
[1:19:07] but it's by the weapon of choice true
[1:19:11] we're given challenges every day in our
[1:19:13] life
[1:19:15] choose you this day right
[1:19:18] are you going to serve god you serve men
[1:19:21] who are we going to serve
[1:19:23] i know this is a little bit of sunday
[1:19:25] school but take it down to another level
[1:19:26] right the weapon of choice
[1:19:31] we're not going to let the devil have
[1:19:32] dominion in our case
[1:19:35] we're not going to let the devil have a
[1:19:36] little home in there you know what he's
[1:19:38] starved to death in there
[1:19:40] we come to church and we sing the
[1:19:41] praises and we hear the we hear the word
[1:19:43] and we go home we listen to a tape and
[1:19:45] that's just choking the life out of that
[1:19:47] devil
[1:19:47] it's just choking the life out of him
[1:19:49] and now is the time to draw him out of
[1:19:51] the cave
[1:19:53] you had me for a season but god promised
[1:19:57] me the victory
[1:19:58] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:20:00] lord and in the power of his might put
[1:20:02] on the whole armor of god
[1:20:04] that you may be able to stand against
[1:20:06] the wiles of the devil
[1:20:07] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:20:09] blood but against principalities against
[1:20:10] powers against the rulers of the
[1:20:12] darkness of this world
[1:20:13] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:20:15] places wherefore
[1:20:16] take unto you the whole armor of god
[1:20:19] that you may be able to withstand
[1:20:22] what day the evil day and
[1:20:25] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:20:29] having your loins get about with the
[1:20:31] truth and having on the breastplate of
[1:20:33] righteousness and your feet
[1:20:34] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[1:20:36] of peace
[1:20:37] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:20:39] wherewith ye shall be able to quench
[1:20:42] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[1:20:45] take the helmet of salvation
[1:20:47] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:20:50] word of god
[1:20:51] and having done all we can to stand you
[1:20:54] know what brother paul there's nothing
[1:20:55] else i can do
[1:20:56] but stand on the word of god
[1:21:00] i'm not standing on my own will or my
[1:21:02] own ability or my own
[1:21:04] will to overcome but i'm standing on the
[1:21:06] word of god
[1:21:08] there's not a demon that can come
[1:21:09] against that there's not an oppression
[1:21:11] that could come against that
[1:21:12] there's not a spiritual wickedness in
[1:21:14] high places that can come against that
[1:21:17] because it is the supreme authority
[1:21:20] and if we can stand upon that rock amen
[1:21:24] for we for though we walk in the flesh
[1:21:27] we do not war after the flesh
[1:21:29] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:21:31] carnal but
[1:21:32] mighty through god to the pulling down
[1:21:34] of strongholds
[1:21:36] casting down imaginations and every high
[1:21:39] thing that exalteth itself
[1:21:40] against the knowledge of god and
[1:21:42] bringing into captivity
[1:21:44] every thought to the obedience of christ
[1:21:49] can i just read that fifth verse out of
[1:21:51] the amplified
[1:21:52] we are destroying sophisticated
[1:21:55] arguments
[1:21:56] and every exalted and proud thing that
[1:21:59] sets
[1:22:00] itself up against the true knowledge of
[1:22:03] god
[1:22:04] and we are taking every thought and
[1:22:07] purpose
[1:22:08] captive to the obedience of christ
[1:22:14] where's the devil belong under your feet
[1:22:19] where's that oppression that you fought
[1:22:20] your whole life belong
[1:22:22] under your feet we are taking captive
[1:22:26] every purpose every plane of the devil
[1:22:29] every stronghold he has everything that
[1:22:32] he's had
[1:22:33] power it's time there we knew there was
[1:22:35] coming a time when the devil would lose
[1:22:37] his power i'm here to announce
[1:22:38] it's time this is the moment where the
[1:22:41] devil loses power
[1:22:43] on the church of god where he's lost
[1:22:45] hold in your life you remember the
[1:22:46] moment when you first fell in love with
[1:22:48] jesus
[1:22:49] and you felt like a huge weight just
[1:22:50] lifted off of you and you knew there was
[1:22:52] something that changed but yet we go
[1:22:54] through battle
[1:22:54] after battle after battle but there is
[1:22:57] coming a day
[1:22:58] there is coming a time and joshua could
[1:23:01] tell the sun to stand still
[1:23:03] and there's never been a day like that
[1:23:05] since day but there's never been a day
[1:23:07] like this day where the devil loses
[1:23:10] complete hold
[1:23:11] on the children of god every son and
[1:23:14] daughter of god is promised to go
[1:23:16] free because you were there before the
[1:23:19] foundation of the world
[1:23:21] before there was ever a thought you were
[1:23:23] god
[1:23:27] how can he lose us friends how is he
[1:23:29] going to forsake us
[1:23:31] how is he going to leave us hanging he
[1:23:32] cannot do it
[1:23:34] his power is limitless there is nothing
[1:23:37] impossible with god
[1:23:45] there's no there's no we've got to clean
[1:23:49] every channel
[1:23:52] the problem is we've got logs boxed up
[1:23:55] because
[1:23:55] you know we've let our imagination take
[1:23:57] over we built maybe a false dialogue
[1:23:59] that god doesn't want to answer that
[1:24:01] prayer that god doesn't want to move on
[1:24:03] our behalf on that need
[1:24:04] and now we have a log jammed up in that
[1:24:06] channel but it's time to move the logs
[1:24:08] it's time to brother ramsey said let an
[1:24:10] atomic bomb come in there
[1:24:11] and in getting in the spirit he said let
[1:24:13] the logs blow out of the way and clear
[1:24:15] every
[1:24:16] channel that god can work through you
[1:24:18] and every mouth and every hand and every
[1:24:20] eye
[1:24:20] and every year that god can have
[1:24:22] preeminence in every cave in this
[1:24:24] building
[1:24:25] i believe that there is a perfect church
[1:24:27] i believe we make up that perfect church
[1:24:29] i believe
[1:24:30] there are people standing here that will
[1:24:32] not taste death that will not taste of
[1:24:35] the things of the devil because we've
[1:24:36] been made
[1:24:37] more than conquerors in this age and we
[1:24:39] will overcome every enemy
[1:24:42] against us i can't say it enough there
[1:24:45] is not enough devils
[1:24:47] that can stop you from victory there is
[1:24:49] not enough depression
[1:24:51] that can stop you from victory because
[1:24:53] you have been made
[1:24:54] to overcome it in this age right now
[1:24:58] by the power of the holy ghost is that
[1:25:00] it's time
[1:25:01] to draw them out of the cave and put
[1:25:03] your foot on top of their neck
[1:25:06] don't be nice to the devil he's not your
[1:25:09] friend he's not your pal
[1:25:11] put him under your foot put him under
[1:25:14] your foot and say devil i've had enough
[1:25:16] i'm drawing the line today i'm not going
[1:25:19] back to where i was yesterday
[1:25:21] i'm not going back to the habits that i
[1:25:23] battled with last week
[1:25:24] but i've had enough and i'm drawing the
[1:25:27] line
[1:25:30] he belongs under your foot you've
[1:25:33] already been given the victory
[1:25:37] drive everything out of those channels
[1:25:39] we want to be used by the lord
[1:25:41] we want to have him use us freely we've
[1:25:45] got to clear
[1:25:46] the channels out of our mind those those
[1:25:49] five senses are fine
[1:25:51] as long as they line up with the word
[1:25:54] your imagination and your reason that's
[1:25:55] fine
[1:25:56] as long as it lines up with the word you
[1:25:59] can use it but
[1:25:59] as soon as the devil brings twisting in
[1:26:01] there and you let that live on top of
[1:26:04] that brother graham said you'll grow
[1:26:05] a deformed faith why because you've let
[1:26:08] that channel be clogged so long
[1:26:10] that you have a lopsided plant because
[1:26:12] this channel is clogged
[1:26:14] but it's time to clear out the channel
[1:26:17] it's time to let god have all
[1:26:20] we just stand to our feet tonight we've
[1:26:23] got to drive every king out of the cave
[1:26:28] we can't stop to reason we can't stop
[1:26:31] the question and i mean
[1:26:33] lord knows we got a lot of quotes we
[1:26:35] could cover that but i believe we're all
[1:26:37] we know where we're headed with that
[1:26:42] but if we just stop and let the devil
[1:26:44] have have his way just just for a moment
[1:26:46] you remember the testimony
[1:26:47] of nellie sanders brother bam said it
[1:26:49] was the first time he'd ever cast a
[1:26:51] demon out of somebody
[1:26:52] remember he had he had he had witnessed
[1:26:54] to her and she gave her heart to the
[1:26:55] lord and she was living a good christian
[1:26:56] life and
[1:26:57] and she was trying to do good yes she
[1:26:59] was just walking down the street
[1:27:01] and heard a little music playing a
[1:27:02] little memory from her past
[1:27:05] and it caught her before you know it she
[1:27:08] was in there dancing and she was in
[1:27:10] there doing the things she used to do
[1:27:12] but something was different about her
[1:27:14] you see when she was dancing
[1:27:16] five or six years before that there was
[1:27:18] no condemnation there there was nothing
[1:27:20] that she felt sorry for she was making
[1:27:21] money doing it and she was good at it
[1:27:24] but you see she meant the lord and just
[1:27:27] stopping for just a moment caused her to
[1:27:29] fall
[1:27:30] but when you know him when you when
[1:27:33] you've been
[1:27:33] face to face with him when you've met
[1:27:35] him on the sacred stands she went to the
[1:27:37] very place that would have brought
[1:27:38] judgment upon her
[1:27:40] the pastor's house she ran and she
[1:27:42] banged on the door in the middle of the
[1:27:43] night
[1:27:44] i've done a terrible thing most of us
[1:27:47] most me am i am i growing up in my
[1:27:50] teenage years i would have ran from the
[1:27:51] pastor's house
[1:27:52] well because it was my dad and i would
[1:27:54] have gotten real trouble
[1:27:58] but see something had happened to her a
[1:28:01] reality had taken place
[1:28:03] is there grace for me and because she
[1:28:05] repented
[1:28:07] she was delivered there's
[1:28:10] there's deliverance in repentance
[1:28:14] we're not out none of us are too big
[1:28:16] none of us have not lived this life long
[1:28:18] enough or we think that we're somehow
[1:28:20] superior
[1:28:21] but just one moment in god's presence
[1:28:26] and that repentance will bring
[1:28:27] deliverance i like the way brother
[1:28:29] branham says he says we're following our
[1:28:30] captain
[1:28:32] the captain of deliverance when one
[1:28:35] rises up against you
[1:28:36] whack him down when that amazing
[1:28:39] imagination rises up against you
[1:28:41] whack it down when that memory rises up
[1:28:43] against you
[1:28:44] whack it down cast it down why because
[1:28:47] we're overcoming
[1:28:49] one battle at a time i believe
[1:28:52] i believe we're looking at the promised
[1:28:54] land i believe we're just
[1:28:56] right there at the finish line we're not
[1:28:58] gonna stop
[1:28:59] short we're not gonna we're not gonna
[1:29:01] falter but because we've been given a
[1:29:02] promised word i'm preaching to the elect
[1:29:04] of god tonight
[1:29:05] because we've been given a promised word
[1:29:07] in this hour we
[1:29:08] cannot lose but it's time to deal with
[1:29:11] the situations in our life
[1:29:13] lord i don't want to have any more
[1:29:14] unbelief i don't want to have any
[1:29:16] hindrance i want to be used completely
[1:29:18] by you
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:22] we all have a sword of faith it's time
[1:29:24] to use it
[1:29:27] i don't know what everybody's burden is
[1:29:28] or what what your need is tonight but i
[1:29:30] know that your sort of faith
[1:29:32] can be used to overcome that burden
[1:29:35] i wonder if we could just bow our heads
[1:29:37] and ask that the lord would move upon
[1:29:39] those behalfs we've done all that we can
[1:29:42] to stand and we're still standing
[1:29:46] not by our mind or not by our power but
[1:29:48] it's by
[1:29:49] that holy spirit that we met that one we
[1:29:52] came face to face with that knows
[1:29:57] you've been made more than a conqueror
