[36:13] services today that's
[36:15] true but God don't have to wait till the
[36:17] second service to meet your

[36:21] to wait till the end of the service to
[36:23] meet your need you can receive what you
[36:26] have need of
[36:28] as even the word is coming forth receive
[36:31] an authority receive what you have need
[36:33] of I believe the Holy Ghost comes
[36:36] through the preaching of the word I
[36:38] believe it's the preaching of the word
[36:39] that creates an atmosphere of Faith to
[36:40] believe God for all things and I just
[36:43] say no matter whatever is maybe on your
[36:45] heart that might seem like the biggest
[36:47] thing that you could look at maybe it's

[1:05:05] according to my
[1:05:07] word oh isn't it wonderful to have a
[1:05:10] prophet and the word of the Lord came
[1:05:12] unto him saying get thee hint turn thee
[1:05:16] Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook

[1:05:50] evening and bread and flesh in or in the
[1:05:53] morning and in the evening and he drink
[1:05:55] of the brook
[1:05:56] and it came to pass after a while that
[1:05:58] the brook dried up because there had not
[1:06:01] been rain in the land and the word of
[1:06:04] the Lord came unto him saying arise get
[1:06:07] thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon

[1:06:24] simple subject this morning

[1:06:35] abundance of your mercies and your grace

[1:07:49] we look to you this
[1:07:51] morning amen and amen God bless you you
[1:07:55] can be seated
[1:07:57] amen I want to minister on on a a
[1:08:01] subject called a place called there and
[1:08:06] I know that's U that that's quite a
[1:08:09] title a place called
[1:08:12] there I believe that God's the great
[1:08:16] architect and that God has got a master
[1:08:19] plan for each and every one of us here
[1:08:21] this
[1:08:22] morning there is none of you that are
[1:08:24] here by accident there are none of you
[1:08:27] that are in charge of your own
[1:08:31] destiny now I know that the world wants
[1:08:34] to say if you don't do it no one else
[1:08:36] will I want to say if God doesn't open
[1:08:39] it up and God doesn't lead you you will
[1:08:41] not reach the destiny that you that God
[1:08:44] has intended for you to
[1:08:46] reach I I believe that each of us have
[1:08:49] an ordained Destiny I believe God knew
[1:08:53] us before the world ever begin God knew
[1:08:56] where we would end up God knows where
[1:08:59] he's taking us how many believes
[1:09:02] that amen he he knows matters of fact
[1:09:05] this is not just to the Natural or it's
[1:09:08] not just to the spiritual but I believe
[1:09:10] it's to the Natural amen I I I believe
[1:09:13] God is interested in your job I believe
[1:09:16] God is interested in who you marry I
[1:09:18] believe God is interested in Amen in in
[1:09:21] every area of your life God is
[1:09:26] interested in you and he's been
[1:09:28] eternally interested in
[1:09:30] you man the prophet would say the church
[1:09:34] positionally before the foundation of
[1:09:36] the world when God in his labor pain was
[1:09:41] bringing forth bringing forth you
[1:09:44] knowing what you would do he placed you
[1:09:47] positionally into his own body now many
[1:09:50] people want to stop there and say well
[1:09:51] yes that was the spiritual aspect but if
[1:09:54] you were to go on brother Bram would
[1:09:56] would then give say he positionally
[1:09:58] placed you into his own body to be a
[1:10:01] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:10:04] preacher to be a a a prophet to be this
[1:10:08] or that he placed you positionally amen
[1:10:11] he placed you when before the foundation
[1:10:14] of the world and so God's Got A Plan
[1:10:18] God's got well glory to God some of you
[1:10:21] may be sitting in here this morning and
[1:10:22] saying well
[1:10:24] I I you know I I think God's forgot
[1:10:27] about me God's not forgot about
[1:10:30] you God's got all eternity invested in
[1:10:33] you amen you are here according to his
[1:10:37] Divine Purpose and plan amen the prophet
[1:10:40] would say we often get a view of him
[1:10:42] that makes him seem very impersonal it
[1:10:45] is as though God made the whole universe
[1:10:48] and all the laws that pertained to it
[1:10:49] and then stood back and become a great
[1:10:52] and personal God it is as though God
[1:10:54] made a way of salvation for lost Mankind
[1:10:58] and that way being the cross and then
[1:11:00] when uh when the death of Christ was
[1:11:02] atoned for our sins his resurrection
[1:11:04] gave us an open door to him and then God
[1:11:07] just folded his arms and stood back it
[1:11:09] is as if we have majored in believing in
[1:11:12] a great Creator who having created has
[1:11:15] now lost personal interest in his
[1:11:17] creation Now I say this is how too many
[1:11:21] people are apt to think but that is
[1:11:24] wrong
[1:11:26] thinking turn to your neighbor and say
[1:11:28] that ain't good
[1:11:29] thinking for God is governing in the
[1:11:34] Affairs of men right now yes sir he is
[1:11:39] both Creator and
[1:11:41] sustainer well oh I just want to I I
[1:11:44] feel like doing a real good Pentecostal
[1:11:46] jig right now amen because he is not
[1:11:49] just the Creator he's not just the
[1:11:53] savior he is the
[1:11:55] sustainer of his work amen amen many of
[1:12:00] times we we fail to realize that God
[1:12:04] knows the end from the beginning he
[1:12:07] knows when you're going to reach your
[1:12:10] destiny he knows where your destiny is
[1:12:14] and he is taking you to your destiny
[1:12:18] right
[1:12:20] now but you see in between amen the the
[1:12:25] time that he starts you to the time that
[1:12:28] you reach your destiny there's a lot of
[1:12:30] places called there amen you see you see
[1:12:35] Elijah was not told amen that the water
[1:12:39] Brook was going to dry up Elijah was not
[1:12:43] told that amen so when God had had
[1:12:46] called Elijah and amen Elijah come in
[1:12:48] and he shut up the Heavens because of
[1:12:50] the sin a of of the nation and amen and
[1:12:55] and the water the heavens had closed up
[1:12:58] and and the and and and the the cattle
[1:13:01] was uh amen were were thin and bare and
[1:13:05] the and there was no rain there was no
[1:13:07] crops there were none of these things in
[1:13:09] the land but yet God supernaturally took
[1:13:13] care of Elijah there at the water Brook
[1:13:16] amen while everyone else is looking for
[1:13:18] jobs and while everyone else is scared
[1:13:20] and while everyone else God's got a
[1:13:22] place for his elect God knows who you
[1:13:25] are well come on now we're living under
[1:13:28] I mean this world is under the Judgment
[1:13:30] of God the tribulation is upon us we
[1:13:33] understand amen that judgment is here
[1:13:36] there's no reversing that can you say
[1:13:38] amen amen but God's got an elect that he
[1:13:41] has says I'm going to keep you in the
[1:13:43] midst of the drought I'm going to keep
[1:13:45] you in the midst of the confusion I'm
[1:13:47] going to keep you in the midst of the
[1:13:49] discouragement I'm going to keep you
[1:13:52] when death is all around and the Death
[1:13:54] Angel striking you just stay beneath the

[1:14:13] destiny is but God doesn't say where

[1:15:13] going to take you to your destiny well

[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:54] I'm way off my

[1:52:14] but this is a new
[1:52:15] place so they come in and bringing the
[1:52:17] armor and everything on him now he was
[1:52:20] Head and Shoulders taller than everyone
[1:52:21] else and David was just as scrawny
[1:52:22] little
[1:52:23] lad right David couldn't even walk
[1:52:27] around in it right right he says
[1:52:29] listen I've not tried these let me use
[1:52:33] what God has trained me with he's not
[1:52:37] trained me with a sword and a spear and
[1:52:38] the armor but he has trained me in the
[1:52:41] shepherd or in the
[1:52:43] pasture with this little Shepherd
[1:52:46] sling and he defeated the enemy that day
[1:52:49] come on church he went from a little
[1:52:52] nobody to hearing the women sing
[1:52:58] songs Saul has killed his thousands but
[1:53:02] David has killed his tens of thousands
[1:53:05] he went from a little to a Hallelujah he
[1:53:09] went from a little to a man that was now
[1:53:11] going to be persecuted he was now going
[1:53:14] to be hunted like a like a rabbit being
[1:53:16] chased by a dog now the King was going
[1:53:19] to see he put his entire life to killing
[1:53:22] Avid destroying David destroying his
[1:53:25] influence but now he found
[1:53:30] himself that's good yes sir that is so
[1:53:38] good right
[1:53:42] great I killed the Giant now the king's
[1:53:45] trying to kill
[1:53:47] me and now he's hiding in
[1:53:51] caves for
[1:53:56] years he was in another
[1:54:02] place do you feel like you're ever going
[1:54:05] to you jump out of The Frying Pan Into
[1:54:07] the
[1:54:08] Fire do you ever feel like it's ever
[1:54:11] going to God is it ever going
[1:54:16] to so I'm dying in this one that is so
[1:54:20] good but in that time he's learning that
[1:54:22] he's not going to
[1:54:23] kill the man that's trying to kill him
[1:54:26] right in that time God put
[1:54:29] Saul right at his feet where David could
[1:54:33] take his own dagger and kill his own
[1:54:37] enemy but he was so he was he was
[1:54:43] trained so much by God that when he had
[1:54:47] him in his hands he says I will not
[1:54:50] touch God's anointed I will do him no
[1:54:53] harm what did he do God was training
[1:54:57] David to be the
[1:55:00] king just because he was anointed to be
[1:55:02] king did not mean he was ready to be
[1:55:05] king he was anointed but he had to go
[1:55:09] through
[1:55:15] training you could be anointed to be the
[1:55:17] bride you could be anointed to be this
[1:55:20] end time bride of Jesus Christ but but
[1:55:22] you've got to be
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:28] trained but the day
[1:55:31] came when David sat on the
[1:55:36] throne David was not going to be just an
[1:55:40] average man he was a man after God's Own
[1:55:44] Heart praise the
[1:55:46] Lord his

[2:12:36] baby disassociated from the Baptist
[2:12:42] denomination
[2:12:48] right and when he was in a cave because
[2:12:51] they were telling him that he was a he
[2:12:53] was a magician and there he was in a

[2:13:36] prophets he said what do they do they
[2:13:38] mess up that's all they they couldn't do

[2:13:46] go over in that age and what he could
[2:13:47] put over how he could with the nature of

[2:14:16] my senses am I becoming a mad man what's
[2:14:18] the matter with me why do I say the

[2:14:23] I do for what makes me I love people and
[2:14:26] yet just rip them apart I fast and pray
[2:14:30] to get rid of it and the more that I
[2:14:32] fast and pray the worse it comes
[2:14:35] incredible but it's true it's

[2:40:20] dying but every one of these test or
[2:40:22] trials it comes
