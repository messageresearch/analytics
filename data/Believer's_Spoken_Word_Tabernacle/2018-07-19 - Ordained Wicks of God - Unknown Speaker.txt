father different Lord situations but you know Lord every need and we just lift each and every one up before your throne Lord tonight and ask that you would just have your way father in the service will you come tonight Lord and just speak to a slore we ask it Lord in all things for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen may your loving tonight a man it's good to be a Christian let's go in our scriptures here in our Bibles to Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee well behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy rising amen may God bless His Word and bless you as you're being seated it's a very familiar passage of Scripture and I trust it is but I trust it's not common to our hearts and you look at the words and how that the Holy Spirit were just so quick and the words to our hearts and the find of how that were spoken to within this within the scriptures to arise and shine and we know that it has to be that without without there being light to come there had to be something that could actually be illuminated something that could be brought to light and when we think of that we know that it is very personal our light has come just like God has visited every generation every age and God his word is what is light when God makes that word become light it becomes a reality and the purpose of that is to bring seeds is to bring life to his children that are here and ordained within this present time as it has been within every time so if there is the command that is given to arise and shine then it speaks that there must be material lives that can be yielded to be able to reflect because there's there's no other true light but him there's no other light that we are to reflect but him we're not to reflect you know as it were a church or a program yet our lives do reflect upon what upon this assembly is brother band will tell us and many times you'll speak of how that you know there were those within that community they went out and they ran up garage bills and different things like that and the brem said we went out and we took care of that so that it would not be such a reflection upon the church but we realize that the shining of this light and the reflection of it that there is a call to reflect the very life of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's that's really the desire that burns within our hearts we want to see him reflected and glorified in our lives in every way we want to see him on display and and if God is called for this and this word has laid here then it shows that God knows just like within every bed of time what is laying here and the material that he already has placed here in order for him by his presence to illuminate that material and bring it to life to reflect him in this hour so when we we look at this here you know it's much like when you think of it when Moses here you look at how that in Moses life when Moses when he had went up into the the mountain to receive the commandments of the Lord the Bible says when he came out of the presence of God that his face shone and you know that was an experience of how that Moses had come into the presence of God and he had been illuminated with the very word that God had for that time to be given out and then you you think you moved from that time and you moved to where you see Stephen when he's coming to a place to where his life has also been illuminated by the presence of God and the scripture would declare and record his countenance was as like that of a angel that shine it and and we look at it that the soul that this was God's desire that it would be by his word coming in and being livered and you know amazing Moses face would have never shown had it not been that Moses was ordained for that he was called into that place and he was also receptive you see all of those parts were working together so that it was God's light that was made to reflect if there's nothing within a person to reflect they cannot reflect light if it's not in a person to be able to receive light they can never receive that but if there's something that is within a person it is certainly not something that man has put there or that we have read ourselves to a place of it but it's what God has already ordained and it's God that brings it into a place to where that he himself can begin to take that part that's ordained by him that material that which he is placed there and he himself can begin to reflect his own life through that so when we we think of this within that scripture of how that you see Stephens life of how that his countenance was shining within that time and and the glory of God was was being made meant made manifest in his life and certainly the glory of God when we look at this scripture right here that is displayed here before us we see the condition that the world is in we see that condition and it's such a stark contrast as a matter of fact the darkness that is upon the world is not something that has come just all of a sudden but remember it has been seeds that was planted before that's now coming into a place of maturity but the same way holds true for the light upon the believer it has been seeds that have been planted and now those seeds are coming into fruition for whatever has been planted will be reaped is that right so now when we look at this and then thinking of this in the scripture I just want to take this thought just here tonight just a little bit and ask that the Lord will just help us here on ordained wicks of god-ordained wicks of God and I look at here in the scripture of Colossians 1 verse 12 Paul says giving thanks under the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son he hath made us to be partakers of the inheritance and that that inheritance is is that of his own life this life that you and I have been made partakers up we understand it's not a church life this is not religion it's Christ's own life it's the Holy Ghost you and I have been made partakers of it to be made in the word made us to be fit we were not fit within ourselves we could not bring ourselves to our inheritance but God Himself become one of us and through the very offering up of the Lord Jesus we are brought back to our inheritance that we had in God from the beginning is that right but there has to be now when there is an inheritance you'll never know what rightfully belongs to you unless there's someone that can be Clare to you what it is that belongs to you but you've also got to be able to recognize that you're the one that is included in the writing and you've got to be able to recognize that to say what is being spoken that's for me now there might be others that will look at it and listen to it and it will never have a meaning to them but upon your heart upon my heart there's something about the word when it's spoken in this time in this hour it has an effect upon our life because it is our inheritance and to think that the Lord Jesus Christ he comes down and through those processes of bringing us to himself he calls us by faith is that right he sanctifies our life there's a cleansing of the blood hits a reading out of all the old habits and setting our mind and holding us and then he himself alone can come and step down and sit down to the midst of our life bringing us into that place think of this an inheritance of the saints that are in life every one that has walked where you and I are walking by God's grace Peter walk the same way Paul walk the same way that they were partakers of the same inheritance as a matter of fact Peter called it partakers of that divine nature so when we look at how that God has set forth here and we look at how that God has ordained for this moment I want to move over in the Book of Revelations and we know that the Book of Revelations itself it's a symbol there's many things throughout the scripture that are given as symbols there's ways how God Himself is even he wrote his Bible in the heavens you'll find Amos where Amos will be moved by the Spirit of God and he will tell the people of God seek after that of the seven stars and that of Orion God then writing it in the heavens and how that God was declaring even here within symbols of what had been down through the Old Testament and many of the old prophets have seen which we had spoke of here just some months ago but notice in verse 19 he says write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches if you remove the star you have no illumination to come to that church is that right a star himself is that which is in the right hand of God and it's set forth by God to that as is mentioned in each one of the letters down through of that in the Book of Revelations I don't mean to be redundant but I know that some of this might be new but to recognize that God from this time of the sacrificial the offering and the Ascension up to think of how that God has reserved within this time what was in his mind that he would call a Gentile bride he would call his people that which he has has already chosen before the foundation of the world and how that God has given their of the space of time that he himself by and through the Holy Spirit working to call his children unto himself and God has a program and his program it can't go outside of his program he hasn't he has a distinct program God if we want for rate within God's program then we received the true blessing of God because God is the one that puts his program over oh my and I look at how that this is his spoken of here within the Scriptures and brother Ron takes it like this in the Patmos vision and he says how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that main bowl because they had their wicks dipped there in the thick of this that ball it was one ball that was poured into that one ball that was on top of the candlestick it says and that ball was filled with that oil after the very Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ I had priests the Holy Spirit was poured back out it was poured out upon the Church of the Living God it was no longer just as David would know the Spirit of God and the prophets of old would know the Spirit of God moving on their life then pulling back moving upon their life then pulling back but the Lord Jesus himself was the first of this new race upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descend and remained this same is he and this is exactly what would take place for every Jose and son and daughter of God where the Spirit of God descending and remaining by a real true new birth to think of this and this manner he poured out of his of his life and it goes on to say each church age Messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost his wit his life has been immersed in Christ through that wick he is drawing the very life of Christ and by it gives out light to the church what kind of a light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hid with Christ in God now I want you to think of this this word through that wick he is drawing the very life of Christ and I want you just to think about I know it's a simple but just to think up on it just for a little bit because you see within our lives when we've been looking at the seven golden candlesticks and we've seen how that God placed it out there in a type in the tabernacle then we move over and we see it all the way down the old testament and into the new testament where it speaks that no man lied at the candle and then hide it under a bushel but he put a fit on a candlestick so there's a placement but to recognize God that God the God's whole working it's not that our life is concealed here within just these walls of this church that's not the goal is that it's it's easy let me say it like this it's easy and here to feel good or or to if we could say like this it'd be easy to live and maybe you know in a way of victory but this is not where God intends just for that life to be displayed but the Bible when he came down and he lit them candles or those wicks on the day of Pentecost remember he said you're to be witnesses on to me unto the uttermost parts of Judea Samaria beginning in Jerusalem so to where the Holy Spirit to think of this oh my of how that the Holy Ghost now in control of the Church of the Living God and how that God would take and guide and direct a Philip he would guide and direct different ones into places even to the place where Peter could open up and riding in the first part 1st Peter chapter 1 Peter an apostle and servant of God unto the elect saints of God into Cappadocia and all the way on through it was those who were elect and ordained of God and he said I've sent and I've come with this purpose in mind oh my I just you know and I think of it these wicks that are that are laid out here the wick itself is that predestinated seat of God it's predestinated of God you know you can't just make anything a wick not just anything will be a wick but there are certain materials that are ordained to be wicks there's certain things you know as it would be you can actually take a mop and you can take a mop and you can cut that mop and you can take that string when it better of cotton and you can actually take that and dip that one in an oil and let it sit in there in those old lamps you can set it there and let it be fed right up and it will not that string will not burn up but it actually has the ability within that string to bring up the oil and the fire itself is burning from the oil traveling through the wick glory be to God now to think of this of how these wicks and ordained and to look at it you find that how that God had each one of these men these seven stars that we're looking at it seven messengers and I want to kind of go back and forth in a reflection to just look at this tonight in comparison to our own lives it's ordained that wick when we look at that wick of God it is or day to draw from the very life of God through predestinated fibers that his life might be made manifest it's not it's not of who we are or who we've made ourselves but it is God's grace and here's working and what you think of this you were made you know there's a lot of things that you know that we said the oil you could have the oil but if they're said but if there's not the right material to absorb it it'll never do any good but there's got to be material that can absorb and you see a lot of with the preaching of the word the flow of the Holy Spirit it can there are some that are made to repel it but there are other hearts and lies that are made to absorb the working of the Holy Spirit that are made to absorb when God is expecting and expressing in that hour and it's something personal to our hearts that it's not something that we have done but it's ordained to it and it's absorbing right down on our fiber not even what sometimes you don't even feel it but it's being absorbed it's being absorbed sometimes you don't even recognize the absorption why because it's just simply part of who you are it absorbs through your life sometimes the manifestation of that you don't see it to some part on down the line oh my may God help us to ever abide within the oil amen think of this you're made to absorb and not repel made to absorb and not repel if you take out that wick think of this you take out the wick you've got oil and you've got fire but there's got to be a wick in between the wick in between it's only purpose it's only purpose is to bring the oil that is hidden draws it up that the light that is visible displays oil is down there so the wick itself is really not what's on display it is the fire itself that's on display and the oil itself it's manifested there has to fly the fire is the confirmation that oil is there you with me so this this wick when we look at it it's got to be something that can draw or else it'll just burn up it'll burn up it cannot it's not able to endure think of how that God laid this out even with the ark into saving of knowing this household in this time God God has laid the example you see all the way through the scriptures it is Jesus Christ we don't we don't just all of a sudden come to the realization of Jesus Christ in the New Testament but the New Testament reveals that Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new and we see the type because this is a book of redemption so it's showing all of these things and depicting here even in the time of Noah where trees were cut down but there was another tree that was cut down the trees that were cut down made out of a gopher wood they were of a special wood but the way that they were they were very spongy type wood they were a wooden me sat like this that was soft for I love this they were soft you wouldn't listen to me you would not have chosen them to make an ark out of you wouldn't have done it but you see the mind of God is on display here because God has the nether tree to be cut down and that tree has sat in it it has life in it it has what the scripture calls pitch which is atonement and when that life comes out of that tree that SAP and now it is put upon the tree but you've got to do one thing first you to heat that pitch so that that pitch now can move upon those other woods that are empty but gopher wood it shows that in our lives it was ordained and made to be absorbent of the real pitch of Almighty God that there's only one way that we are saved only one way that were sealed away and that's by the pitch of Almighty God had it been any other type of wood it would have never absorbed it but when this gopher wood absorbed it it became from soft to hard it came to a place to where he could it could be shaped and formed and it would withstand the judgment the waters of judgment could could rock up against it but the waters of judgment could not penetrate that pitch oh my you see with the pitch itself is what was great it wasn't the wood that was behind it because the word that was behind it was soft and would have been overlooked but it was the pitch it was the pitch it's his life it's Christ's own life it's not the wick it's Christ it's Christ you know it's like the bush Moses came there before the presence of God and God was going to speak to him and Moses marveled that here the bush burned yet was not consumed it was on fire naturally in the end of thinking and reasonings of man we would say that that bush should have burned up but this was not a natural fire this was a supernatural fire God showed these natural types here with the candlesticks but yet it was speaking of a real true spiritual fire that it would be his life it's not a fire that's created by a man because I ran a fire created by man can be put out but a fire where it's God himself our God is a consuming fire the man cannot put that fire out when the fire of God has come down and lit your soul and nothing can put that out there's nothing that can extinguish it there big tests and trials and all those things that will come your way you're spearing might get weak but that fire on the inside you're a Christian today you're a Christian tomorrow you're a Christian on the mountain you're a Christian in the valley you're a Christian when everything's going right you're a Christian when everything's going wrong why because it's not your life it's him and when you think I can't make another step it's shows it's not you it's him I'm not going to ask hands of those that maybe felt that way tonight or who have felt that way or will feel that way because within it all God proves his faithfulness you know these strips wicks these wicks that were used you know where they got these wicks from they got these wicks from the robes of priests the priests once their old robe their robe had been used because they got a new robe in a year they would take the priests robe and they would cut strips cuz they were made out of linen and they would cut strips of the priests robe and those strips were called swaddling cloth and they would use swaddling cloth or wick and that is what was used in order to draw up the oil that was down there over to the fire that was above let me say this you don't remember it I don't remember it but we were in when he came our high priest to be identified here upon this earth you and I were identified within him we died with him we rose with him hallelujah we were identified with him and because we were identified when he took the body he sent back the Holy Ghost the other part of the contract and he lets him know these are chips off the master diamond these are wicks that are taken from my robe of righteousness they are identified by my presence they illuminated by my life they are substance of my substance they have come from me they are mine from his own life that's why our high priest is also our brother guru be to God hallelujah you love him amen here oh my brother Bama says not only can we speak thus of the messengers but every true believer is dramatically depicted here I love that dramatically depicted here it's a drama an act they are all drawing from the same source they have all been dipped into the same Bowl they are dead to themselves and their lives are hid with Christ in God they are sealed in by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption no man can pluck them out of his hand I've just listed let's just let's just look at this for a few moments no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and shining giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost notice their visible life the visible life is something that we see in one another is that right it's a visible life but behind that visible life there must be an inner invisible life the inner invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word Satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost its sting the grave has lost its victory thanks be to gum be unto God they had this victory in and through the Lord Jesus Christ now think of this there's nothing their lives could not be tampered with your life cannot be tampered with we're here upon this earth the purpose that we're here is to serve God and and and understand the serving God is not just about good morality it's deeper than that and when his purpose is being served that is a natural effect you don't have to worry about good morality that that comes out of the very life of Christ but we're talking about serving his purpose and recognizing who he is and yielding to his working and there's nothing that can take us out of this earth until that purpose deserved you think I want you to think of this think of how many times that Paul you've read this through the book of Acts and we don't even have to go to Paul we can go to the life of the Lord Jesus how many times the Bible says that they sought to take him the Bible said they took counsel to take him here he was even move right out of the crowd and they didn't get to him you're not going to tell me that they did not have guards and did not have people that would bid would have been adequate to be able to get to him but it shows you he was under the protection of the prophecy of the word he was dwelling in a place of safety there is nothing that could take him until the time it was to take him it shows God has appointed times you know if it's you and I looking and I want you to think of this because listen friends even sometimes when we come down to different things that take place with the physical realm surgeries and on and on and on the we can go through you know what there's many times unless you've got a direct word from God you've got to completely just trust in the Lord not knowing what's going to be the outcome of this are you with me it takes a real trust from God I I don't know what's going to be the outcome out of this but God knows this and so our faith is focused in God not in an outcome that we would want even though that would be fine but ultimately is Lord may you help us and may your will be done think about this of how that they is Paul and and different ones they could Paul so many times here he was a light unto the Gentiles a light unto the church and to think of this of how that Satan on everywhere and everywhere tried to come at him tried to take his life I want you to I want to ask you this did it look like a real mighty man of God a real Conqueror one who stood there and Devils were cast out and there a woman who was you know possessed with the devil and he could speak in and and loosen that spirit from her life and yet here he is escaping out of the midst of a city lowered in a basket it didn't look very glorious but nonetheless it was still God that deliver T you risk me it didn't look glorious when Paul used his Roman citizenship because you see in the book of Acts he didn't always play that card or use that Z it wasn't just saying he wasn't he listened to me he wasn't resting on that understand what I'm saying Paul wasn't resting on that he was a Roman citizen but it happened to be that the Spirit of God would even lead him in appropriate time and he himself would bring us out and say how can you do this to him who is a Roman citizen I'm asking you who was it that brought it to Paul's attention it was the same God that met him on the road I asked you who was it when Paul stood before the pharisees and sadducees brought into a council and paul stood on the wisdom of God and he split that assembly right in half here he he knew where they all stood but Paul began to take positions in the word that was the Word of God and he split that thing right down the middle because there's many of them Sadducees didn't believe in resurrection but the Pharisees did now I'm what I'm trying to say is it was the wisdom of God you don't know what kind of situations that you might be brought into and a person can say you mean to tell me that you don't believe in a real Pentecostal move now they might be saying it from an organization but you can say I sure do believe in a real Pentecostal experience I do believe in a God who still manifests himself in prophecy in dreams and signs and wonders and in tongues and interpretation and they're looking at you and said Myles this guy believes the same way we do but yet you don't believe according to organization you believe according to the Living God what is it the wisdom of God my Lord God helped me to stay out of the way help you to stay out of the way that he can know that don't let me do let me classify things to say Lord this is really super spiritual and Lord I don't know about that I that don't look the spiritual eye I just want to be led by him because in many of the things that are very spiritual we don't even feel him I wonder how we would be it's a bad enough when our fleets their flights are delayed at the airport when I had to set in an airport sometimes some of the rest of you my goodness I hope to get the mechanics up here from Atlanta and fix that Delta flight and bring this man how are we gonna get there how long natural part of us right we don't always go into the gear and say well you know the Lord landed the plane for the front we don't always go to that gear because sometimes that's not why that plane is like that sometimes it's just patience god help me one time my wife said I was supposed to fly out real early go to Arkansas and they canceled the plane or they they had to fly up people from Atlanta to work on it or whatever more and they said you want to fly over to Detroit because we can't fly this plane more than 9,000 feet in the air but we think you can do that as a no I'll just stay right here my wife said you want me to come get us and no I got my laptop I'll just sit here get me a coffee I'll study I said I'm fine I don't I don't want to run around I just wait here during that time when I knew this is that hit well God you knew I wasn't supposed to speak tonight I want to speak that night anyhow but I said God you know but I say that to you because you know what we're not always that way and I say word because I include myself with you we're not always that way but I'm grateful that God brings us to back to these places a visible life and the invisible life that invisible life on the inside that we're Satan cannot touch that life not even death or death has lost its sting I want you to think Billy bomb uses these words and he describes us remember this what is speaking of the messenger that wick that's in the lamp lamp of God that speaks of you and I as the believer under this message now once you watch how he speaks of this now I didn't put these up but I just want to refer to him think of this in the Book of Revelations it never called one of them by name there's not one of the name of the messengers they're written you see it didn't have their name their natural name did not have to be wrote God declares who His Messenger is he declares it by his presence by the word that is given to him it matches and is the very characteristic of that age and it's made manifest he doesn't come to convince the believer but he's ordained by God to bring the very believer and point them into the very presence of Almighty God to make God known to that age think about how Paul Paul would even speak of this in Philippians I believe it's chapter 1 where Paul was letting them know he said you are partakers of my grace to think of what God has opened it's God's water it's God's plan you see because how things run according to the the course and things get off and they get off of the program of God but God had already reserved seven messengers that were ordained that when the Spirit of God would move on their life they would call that church back to the Word of God back to a living reality back to an experience and it's something that nobody has to prove it to you or try to explain it to you it's something that just resonates within your heart it's something that a church never gave you that tall but it's something all of a sudden it illuminates to your life I'll tell you what I remember as a young boy you know it wasn't an odd thing to hear the voice of the Prophet playing in our home that one then I'll think that was a common thing it was a common thing for the tapes to be in the car I remember before you know when he used to be tape player was a was a what do you call it uh it's something you look for in a car when you bought it hey hey does it have cassette no it's just got am/fm radio it used to be a time so I remember dad carrying one of them on you know them because set recorders that had the bar on it you're flopping around like this had a little old what I'm saying I remember all of that I knew there was something about that but it wasn't real to me at that time but Who am I when everything lined up when all the stars everything lined up for what God's timing in everything from my life then everything came together then it became life it was no longer something that my parents believed or where I went to church we believe like this and we believe like this it didn't matter whether there had been a building or not it's something that resonated in my heart and it's something that said a man's are the truth that that is the word of the Living God it's something that rose up in my life hallelujah you always been tonight it's something that illuminated it's something that came to light and it began to manifest itself and how these men they were not called by name their strength their strength was from God they could have never done it without his strength as we just looked at Paul we looked at their and others who can go through there's no way they could have done it their strength came from the Lord oh my they were safe in his care nothing could pluck them out of his hand nothing could separate him from the love of God let it be sickness pearl nakedness famine sword life or death they were truly yielded to him and kept by his omniscience hmm the brand puts it like this he says the seven spirit-filled messengers are the lords they may be repudiated they may be questioned listen to this indeed to human minds they may not even seem to qualify but nevertheless they are the messengers for their age God could have chose men that would have fit the human mind for that age but remember God's not interested and he never matches that of the human mind what remember what what man calls foolish God calls great and what God calls great man calls foolish is that right think of this I think these words are fitting to understand don't just leave him for the messengers it pertains he's bringing this down to us to reflect on this to human minds they may not even seem to qualify but nonetheless they are the messengers for their age God used in Abraham he lied he used a Moses he rebelled a Jonah he disobeyed a Samson he sinned a David he murdered he also used a Joshua and a Joseph listen to this and those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose histories seem to be perfect it would seem it would sing to the human mind but God would choose only those who was seemingly perfect and God has some of that sprinkled down through time are you with me that's why I remember Paul could say brother and he said you see after the flesh how that many noble are not called how many wise are not called how many mighty men after the flesh are not called but he said God had chosen it this is the thing God had chosen those things that are foolish those base things those weak things why did God choose that it was not because he chose how to do so that have just been a weakness on display but God chose because it's vessels lives wicks that can be yielded to him those with blemishes far outnumber those with perd that would seem to be perfect but all were and all are his none there deny that he used them by and through the Holy Spirit that he put within them to their own master they stood or fell and in them all was accomplished the sovereign will of God you look in the book of Judges and on down through the Scriptures God never chose it wasn't great people as far as by earth standards God chose people it was live listen he had already chosen look at Moses intellectual here was a sharp sharp man look at Paul sharp very intellectual Paul knew many different languages but look what Paul said I have learned to count vel those things but dung that I may win Jesus Christ Paul said I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees now look at this what was that because there were many Pharisees many men in that day who locked up the kingdom of God and would not allow the people to go into it but yet what was different about Paul it was the fibers that was on the inside what was it that was different in the city of Philippi there were fibers that were there within lives that the Spirit of God moving along it could be absorbed through their life to declare Jesus Christ I see who was it that led Lydia out by the riverside that day when pulling them made their way in the journey who was that better line that that was Almighty God that aligned it Paul here he is coming with the word and there were lives and hearts that could receive it you see it as we look at it even in a person who's smart listen friends sometimes even in our weaknesses we see with Paul we see with Moses these were very sharp men but yet they had to be come to a place of weakness in order that the fibers God could move and bring forth the fibers that was laying there you think about it even in the time even in the week things even in the weakness of our life it's God coming down because remember we can even allow our weaknesses to be excuses because when he Moses got in his presence Moses had all the excuses as a matter of fact brother Brad Musa like this he said he had seven arguments against God of why he could not do it you see what he tried to do Moses tried to do these things but when he got in the presence of God the presence of God made it very clear and Moses himself said I can't do this i can't Lord I can't I can't even talk right I can't do this now look at this God could not even allow those weaknesses to be an argument against his yielding but the presence of God moves into a place to where he will yield his weaknesses I read a statement here some time ago I think it to be a fitting statement humility is not thinking less of yourself but humility is thinking of yourself less now thinking less of yourself I'm a nobody I don't know the real truth about it is we will it don't believe all that about ourselves we need the help of God and I believe he's been helping us and he is helping us I just say it like that when we get to a place that we feel like we can do something right there God can't do nothing it just it stops right there but it's when God brings us to a place you know I find the longer that I go it's not a high the can pastor it's God is a pastor or both Simon didn't you know that from the beginning I did but yet I know it in a greater way I look at it now it's not odd there can be a husband but God is the one who brings forth that out of my life the same way with the father same way with the mother it's not even though the attributes are there but I'm trusting in him you understand what I'm saying it's trusting in him because without him we're nothing we're nothing without him and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself showing us as the high priest I can do nothing without him but to think of how that God has so brought in our life if we can look at what God has done through the messenger the same Holy Spirit we've been made partakers of you believe that same holy spirit the same spirit of God moving right here in services I'll tell you right now I believe with all my heart brother Branham would and would love to be able to come you know I trust you to be able to love to come here and preach to us listen to her you know brother Ram talks about going out to that trailer park you hear him in the first Shalom message he preaches didn't listen to power transformation brother Brown will refer that little group of people meeting in that trailer park right there he wasn't a massive crowd it was a small crowd it's not about number but it's the thing what he said he said I consider this like the backside of the desert where I can come he said and I can preach without people having superstitions because you cease to super specious thoughts can bind up the Holy Spirit but when the Holy Spirit the Bible talks about in the book of Thessalonians with the these'll and with the Thessalonians they received it not as the word of men but as it was the Word of God and the word Paul even admonished them he said prayed that the word would have free course that the word would have Liberty in our lives and our myths for this by this spirit by one spirit we're all baptized into one body all been made to drink into one spirit we are partakers of that same life no no our gift the gift within our lives that that to declare it's not in our life to declare as the star declared as far as to be a prophet but it is that prophet it came for a purpose and a reason to make Jesus Christ real to us in this generation it to lift up the standard that he's still the same God he he still gives a real true experience he's the same in every way in every aspect and then through that there is hearts and lives that believe that are touched by that our wicks that ordained to be able to express his life this is where Paul could say let me let me wind this down here this is where the Lord Jesus that scripture we looked at some weeks ago where he says let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your heavenly father which is in heaven our good works Paul makes it very clear when we're speaking of this of the good works Paul makes it very clear what these works are it's not religious works I think it's a wonderful thing to hold a door open for somebody I think that's a very courteous thing I think it's a very courteous thing if you see someone in need that you're able to minister to their need but these works are not just works that all would be a religious practice but it's what is ordained already within our lives Paul said very clearly we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works when when were when were we created in Christ Jesus unto good works this is through and by the new birth but what does the new birth release that which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them everything right there I think a brother branham was just reading across some things in the message a brother Brown find him saying over and over he said you get the people he said to the new birth to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the rest will take care of itself because it's a life working with in our lives it's not our power it's his power not our might not our strength is power think of this when they said what shall we do they asked the Lord Jesus what shall we do that we would work the works of God what's what he said believe this is the work of God that you believe on Him whom he had sent this is a work of God it's it's given to you to believe it's given to you and the light coming across the path it begins to move in your heart and bring you into that place that's why friends that when a longing is within a heart for God a church can never satisfy never just setting in a church can never satisfy it but it's it must it's a union with the Lord Jesus Christ to where it's United with him then that's a satisfying portion that's a that's a life it's satisfying and you're able to draw from him even when you're not sitting here you're tapped into that oil the fire of God is lit upon your life and you're drawing from him all that you have need of ordained unto good works that's close remember how the Scriptures they speak of James James and Paul speak of Abraham they take one man Abraham speaks of the faith that God saw stagger not Romans for stagger not their own belief but was strong giving praising to God he looked Paul was making known to us those things with God saw then James brings to the place to say show me your faith by your works they're looking at the same thing but it's a different angle you see whatever the life is the inner life it manifests the hidden life on the inside it manifests what was down there within Abraham's life when God spoke to his heart it began to reflect through his life his walk began to change he came out from where he was and he kept walking to the Lord who spoke to him I find it tremendous few weeks back I'm listening to the message for the brem says what Abraham did that day when he was down in Babylon he said they Abraham got out in a field and he prayed and he said this is what Abraham prayed he prayed and said Lord how you use Noah what you did through Noah you were that you were the Living God Lord will you manifest yourself to me in that way you see here Moses we realize this could have been handed down but that it just gripped my heart that day when I heard that absolute there's a point of reference something he could look it was there and said lord I believe what you did in Noah's day and I believe you're the same God and when he did that God spoke to him come out of this land come into the land then I'll show you and Abraham's works begin to declare his faith it began to express it it wasn't just works of just in ingest and just a level here of just things that we can just see you know here but it was it was a life that was actually being lived and being expressed in Abraham's walk oh my you love him tonight or Jesus lord you've what really directed us more to look not only at you care in your love for our lives but you have directed us Lord as we can see how that you have used God every one of your messengers your prophet told us like this that every true believer is in the hand of God and control from his love and power and received the full benefit of all that God is to the believer Lord sometimes [Music] within our lives Lord may be setting here tonight Lord we we need a deliverance in our lives lord like Paul did in some of the places he was in maybe a direction Lord trying to find the will of the Lord like Paul he the Bible said he is saying he tested to see whether to go into Asia we know what Paul eventually went into Asia but at that time where it speaks that there in the book of Acts he wasn't permitted to go at that time but rather he who was directed by You Lord to go I believe it was into Macedonia there was some sheep that were already there they were already sheep they just didn't know they were Lord Lord to see that it's you that directs your word your light your life across our path Lane Lord Jesus truly you display through all of this it's not the strength of the human instrument then Lord God in many cases the human instrument what you have called and ordained for their lives [Music] they're so incapable of doing it Lord you gave these examples of your working down through the Scriptures and how fitting in this our Lord that you make it known to us Lord because lord has were called and ordained in this hour to take a rapture nor Jesus it will not be our strength but not God it will be your supernatural working would that working Lord where you are working in our lives and working among us now Lord it will be come in a greater way your prophet tells us that Lord it'll be a refilling of the Holy Spirit what has worked while the whole time while that capstone has been coming down but I look at that Lord that it's not something where you'll overpower us No it's a yielding it's yielding Lord help us Lord within it that was not to make excuses of our weaknesses help us to recognize our weaknesses and to recognize that the God who is in us is greater than any weakness the Lord it's through our weakness your strength is made perfect for God our minds our finite minds cannot comprehend that but inwardly Lord we say Amen to it what perhaps here tonight there are wigs that are sitting here tonight that have never been lit but in their hearts or God striking Lord something that goes beyond Lord human reason and human understanding beyond explanations Lord Lord God where it can be from their heart Lord that can say that's a truth that's a truth Lord God this is for me this oil this fire it's for me Lord it's from my life Lord God had settled in their heart state they don't want just a church life but they want that life within him I pray tonight Lord would you just move for their requests in would move for their requests Lord you're the one nor that was our son to yourself maybe there's sickness Lord that has taken hold upon a body father tonight we pray Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Lord you and move upon that child of God move upon Lord that body tonight Lord touch it for your glory Lord Jesus you know the needs and Lord God the desires and more that we would have Lord the reason that we were long in desire for you to heal us is that we might be able to serve you better lord help us to man lord Lord God [Music] help us help us to yield Lord that's your program that you've ordained Lord that you might fulfill it through our lives we just Lord we give ourselves to you now Lord afresh God is wicks fibers Lord Oh God trim our lives back Lord we don't want our lives to these smoky lord but this is a time of land trimming Lord it's a time that speaks in the scripture that there's coming a day as smoking flax he will not quench this is the time Lord for our lives to be trimmed and ready Lord God help us Lord we pray father to give everything giving our all to you Lord may our lives be saturated every fiber of our life Lord granite I pray Lord you're our provider Lord you are supplier oh god you're everything to us [Music] you're our strength Lord or in the name of Jesus Christ let's just stand if we could [Music] if [Music] that's fear with Oh [Music] I mean let it be

no doubt you remember when the brand will give us that point regarding those that came to see Dwight Moody and that reporter showed up in that meeting and reporter said he's as bald as a pumpkin I said I don't see he said he stumbles stammers all over the place and spits and he can t pronounce his words right and everything else the brem said on that editorial he said Dwight Moody couldn't even read it he said but his man that was there with him began to read it to him you know the white moody just chuckled he said of course not they don't come to see me they come to see Jesus Christ it didn't it didn't about a beautiful presentation the the beauty of the presentation is the presenting of his life and each and every one of us friends every part about our life our temperament and our makeup God does not want every one of us to be the same God has all in his kingdom and they're all needed all kind it's all needed but it's up to God and God himself uses and steps down and makes himself known through our lives from its no greatness of our own it's him it's him if there's anything great about our lives it's him it's him and that's it you're loving tonight amen god bless you
