[26:53] landed a few weeks ago when Alex mul was
[26:56] preaching there today uh service
[26:58] I had a prayer cloth with me so I
[27:00] stopped him before he left and we prayed
[27:01] over it my granddaughter Emma had a sty
[27:04] on her eye on her left eye on a Friday
[27:07] it got Progressive worse so I went home
[27:09] with the prayer cloth and I laid it on
[27:11] her and with I I watched it for 48 hours
[27:14] and went down real fast and then I
[27:16] cleared up I was grateful to God that it
[27:17] happened but then she said it went to
[27:19] the from the left eye to the right eye I
[27:21] said I said I got angry that does it
[27:23] that tears it said Emma come here I said
[27:25] I wasn't angry with her but at the
[27:27] situation so I laid Hands On Us in Jesus
[27:30] name we're going to cause this thing to
[27:31] come off of her and it went I'm not
[27:33] saying one is greater than the other but
[27:34] it was accelerated in Jesus name as
[27:37] oppos to material faith in God's word
[27:40] and I was grateful God I kept watching
[27:41] again and said it left her but now she's
[27:43] completely healed and healthy so I watch
[27:45] with the three granddaughters I'm
[27:47] concerned about their safety and
[27:48] well-being and all the children the way

[42:49] together isn't it amen and uh we just
[42:52] want to just look to the Lord here this
[42:54] morning I wonder if you'll just turn
[42:56] with me to proverbs chapter 20 and we'll
[42:59] just see how the Lord will take this
[43:02] this morning I want to speak on the
[43:03] family um and I don't know if I'll get
[43:06] into I'm not going to rush on this part
[43:08] of it but
[43:10] um I want to would like to speak on a
[43:13] thought that the Lord just just really
[43:16] um dropped in my heart when we were on
[43:19] our way traveling on the way to on the
[43:22] way to DC to the meetings uh last
[43:25] weekend and we were just right writing
[43:27] in the car of just just listening to the
[43:29] message and um this thought I'd like to
[43:32] speak on out of the for a family and
[43:34] that is on Great Men of God great men of
[43:37] God and I want to read here from
[43:40] Proverbs Chapter
[43:41] 20 and verse five if we could to begin
[43:46] it says counsel in the heart of man is
[43:49] like deep water but a man of
[43:53] understanding will draw it out praise
[43:56] God so we we not only want to be God
[43:59] gifts us to be able to receive wisdom
[44:03] and instruction but also that God would
[44:06] give us the same wisdom to know when to
[44:09] apply it and how to apply it because
[44:12] remember the the prophet would tell us
[44:14] and take us into the spoken words
[44:16] Original Seed and is very very key
[44:18] statement because of the hour we're
[44:19] living in we're not just living we're
[44:22] not living in the hour of just the eyes
[44:25] the eyes have come because remember that
[44:28] light might come into the body and
[44:32] that's where now the mind of Christ has
[44:35] come upon the Church of the Living God
[44:38] that's the Capstone that's coming into
[44:40] that time that's why brother bradam
[44:41] could say in the beginning of power
[44:43] transformation he says now that we've
[44:46] been filled with his Spirit as we have
[44:49] we want to be
[44:52] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[44:55] receiving the mind of Christ
[44:57] Christ that's that's a work that's a
[45:00] work that God is doing bringing each of
[45:03] us first of all to the new birth and
[45:06] then from there into mature Sons and
[45:09] Daughters of God that's and that in
[45:11] itself the maturity is not a gift it's
[45:16] victory so we want to be as that the
[45:18] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[45:20] done with the word I'll tell you he
[45:22] wants it applied right here he wants it
[45:25] applied right here in my life into
[45:27] situations and God give me the wisdom
[45:30] amen for that most men verse six most
[45:33] men will Proclaim everyone his own
[45:36] goodness but a faithful man who can
[45:40] find let's just do the cliffnotes
[45:42] version of this a faithful man doesn't
[45:45] need to just to speak of his goodness
[45:49] that's true the life
[45:51] testifies of
[45:54] itself the just man walketh in his
[45:57] Integrity his children are blessed after
[46:01] him and verse
[46:03] 29 the glory of young men is their
[46:07] strength it's why you want to be as
[46:09] young men young women you want to use
[46:12] your strength for the right things God's
[46:14] given you that strength it's only for a
[46:16] period of it's for a period of time and
[46:17] it starts starts waning you want to make
[46:20] sure you make everything count is that
[46:23] right there's three things that you can
[46:25] always do as a young person you can with
[46:27] your life Life's a precious thing you
[46:29] can either spend it waste it or invest
[46:33] it true that's three things that we have
[46:36] a choice of and the beauty of old men is
[46:40] the gray head now I've got a little bit
[46:43] of that up here right right here but not
[46:46] up
[46:47] there but the beauty and it's not just
[46:51] we we understand you know in another
[46:52] place in the scripture they'll say the
[46:53] Hy head that means gray headed but it's
[46:57] dealing with many can have white hair
[47:00] gray hair and don't have the wisdom
[47:03] right that is needed and that wisdom
[47:06] with that with that of time it it
[47:09] doesn't come through of just speaking
[47:12] it's experiences yes and that's why I
[47:14] look all around the room every one of us
[47:17] God bringing us through experiences and
[47:19] God brings you through experiences tests
[47:21] and trials it's not just for your
[47:24] molding it's to be a blessing to
[47:26] somebody else yeah that's right it's
[47:28] experiences God brings you through this
[47:31] just as much as it says in the
[47:32] scriptures those examples in the Old
[47:34] Testament were written for our
[47:36] admonition not everybody had the exact
[47:40] same trials experiences but we draw from
[47:44] them all as the spirit gives us the
[47:47] application is that right and that's the
[47:49] same thing within our lives amen may God
[47:52] bless you I'd like to just as you're
[47:53] being
[47:55] seated um real quick I wanted to uh kind
[47:59] of give a little update uh very briefly
[48:02] here on uh uh on my neighbor uh Gabe
[48:06] Vasquez he the previous Thursday June
[48:10] 6th the same um uh day that uh sister
[48:14] Ruth Hoyer had went home to be with the
[48:16] Lord uh Gabe had passed on as well uh at
[48:20] that time and you know we had as a
[48:22] church I know many of you had asked at
[48:24] different times how is he doing and um
[48:27] you know uh really for him to have been
[48:30] here throughout that time uh till June
[48:33] 6th it was a miracle uh that in itself
[48:36] was a miracle because uh in March when
[48:40] my other neighbor we were talking they
[48:44] you know since January just to give you
[48:46] this point since January they had to go
[48:49] in and they had he had a colostomy bag
[48:52] from that time in January uh they were
[48:54] actually at a point just some of the
[48:55] doctors that were there a place that he
[48:57] had went to had just come in emergency
[48:59] doctors and they were just hey just go
[49:01] home you need to go in the hospice and
[49:04] his wife with working in the medical
[49:05] field this is seems kind of you know it
[49:08] just so they got another um other there
[49:12] other doctor came in and the other
[49:13] doctor said whoa uh not so soon you're
[49:15] too young we're not giving up like this
[49:18] and uh so he had a a procedure done that
[49:23] where the colostomy bag and then having
[49:26] the pecs system where you're feeding you
[49:28] he never ate solid food from the 1 of
[49:31] January on it was just simply that meal
[49:33] that goes in the bag and then your
[49:35] colostomy bag and I you know in my heart
[49:39] I had been praying and um you know that
[49:42] the Lord obviously I seen his young
[49:45] family had desire that God would just
[49:47] would completely raise him up I've seen
[49:49] God do that there's nothing impossible
[49:52] with the Lord and um you know most of
[49:55] all I you know I wanted that assurance
[49:58] and that part because as they had
[50:00] reached out to me I wanted that
[50:01] Assurance just to know that you know he
[50:04] had he had met the Lord he accepted the
[50:06] Lord as his savior I you know I don't
[50:08] know you or I don't know to what degree
[50:10] and what a person is called to but if
[50:12] they can look to the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:13] as their savior they're saved and
[50:17] so uh I you know had received a text
[50:20] back there and when we were uh
[50:22] communicating and I had been talking and
[50:24] you know been wanting to get talk with
[50:26] him but it just it just hadn't worked
[50:28] out I'd sent a prayer letter a letter
[50:30] with prayer cloth and I have a whole
[50:32] letter typed out and um just to to get
[50:36] to them and um you know he they they
[50:41] took that and and and thank thanked me
[50:43] for that throughout the whole thing um
[50:47] you know it was really a miracle that he
[50:49] would survive till June 1st one of the
[50:51] key things that I was praying about with
[50:52] that is that Lord if if it's your will
[50:55] to take him then I'm I'm asking for
[50:59] Mercy that he would be able to go
[51:01] through June 1st because that's when he
[51:03] would receive his retirement through
[51:05] Ford that way his family would be able
[51:08] to stay in place and so uh God granted
[51:12] that and we're thankful for that um but
[51:15] one of the things that he had mentioned
[51:16] to me he had talked to me and I had you
[51:18] know I had over I seen that text but you
[51:20] know so many months ago and you
[51:22] sometimes you wonder if this is all
[51:24] there's probably another message that
[51:26] will come out of this but if there's
[51:27] anything at all sometimes we can get the
[51:29] wrong thoughts about things we can get
[51:32] to where that we have things that seem
[51:34] so real in our mind and nobody's said it
[51:38] nobody's done anything but we have so
[51:41] real in our minds as though that we
[51:42] think this is exactly how it is and
[51:45] we're well you know I wonder why wasn't
[51:47] he wanting to talk with me why wasn't
[51:49] and I thought I thought at some point my
[51:51] I had you know heard that he was maybe
[51:53] you know maybe a little Disturbed or
[51:55] something like that you know going
[51:56] through the whole situation but I traced
[51:58] back in my mind I thought I can't I
[52:00] can't get that I can't get anything
[52:02] settled on that and um I went back to a
[52:06] text that he had sent me and my wife and
[52:09] I were talking and um he had sent me a
[52:12] text he said Sam he said I am trusting
[52:15] in the Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and
[52:18] Savior and it took me clear back to a
[52:20] text that he had sent back in the first
[52:23] parts of January and I kept that text I
[52:25] kept on that thread that he and I had
[52:28] and I went back to that and the reason
[52:30] what took me back to that now I want
[52:31] this is what I want you to think I've
[52:33] prayed all these months thinking as
[52:36] though somehow that oh God May soften
[52:38] his heart Lord soften his heart God had
[52:40] already softened his heart but I was
[52:42] trying to figure out why can't I get to
[52:45] him Lord I want to get to him Lord open
[52:47] the door you know I don't want to just
[52:48] go bust in the door because he's been a
[52:50] very sick man some days he don't get out
[52:52] of bed and so I don't want I've always
[52:54] told him I'm here we're here for you if
[52:56] you ever need anything for the children
[52:57] or anything we're here and uh and
[53:00] checking on you know his wife and things
[53:02] and this is what his wife said and this
[53:03] is what spurred everything she stood in
[53:05] the yard on Thursday morning and we were
[53:08] talking and we were just you know just I
[53:11] was there just ministering to her and
[53:13] she said Sam she said she said the
[53:16] fortitude that he had she said I know
[53:18] that it was the prayers of the people
[53:21] she said because she said through it all
[53:24] she said the battle that he fought she
[53:26] said an example he rolled in pain just
[53:31] in the last week and at night she said
[53:35] because they hadn't given him you know
[53:36] maybe sufficient with pain and the
[53:38] doctors would come in the next morning
[53:39] and say how are you doing Gabe he said
[53:41] doctors I believe it's taking a turn for
[53:44] the better she said I she said I'm
[53:47] sitting there in the room thinking are
[53:49] you kidding me what I just seen you go
[53:51] through last night but she said he he
[53:54] held that to the very end and I begin to
[53:58] realize within that I I'm just I'm being
[54:00] very transparent with you that there's
[54:02] sometimes we can get the wrong thoughts
[54:03] about things and where that all of a
[54:06] sudden that when I come to realize God
[54:08] just and to me I was grateful that I
[54:10] could say Lord I'm glad that I have that
[54:12] peace that I know that he had that
[54:15] settled with you and I realized why
[54:18] wasn't it that when they were trying to
[54:20] get him hey just to come and to to talk
[54:22] with me or me to come there why wasn't
[54:24] it why wasn't he going into all that
[54:26] because you know what everything when he
[54:28] would look at that that was to look at
[54:30] as
[54:32] defeat does that make sense to you yes
[54:35] and when that happened I
[54:36] realized that thought it kept me praying
[54:40] but my thought was in it it wasn't at
[54:42] all that he was angry with God it wasn't
[54:44] at all that he did that there was which
[54:47] you know a person without knowing
[54:48] without the Lord but I I just wanted to
[54:51] share that there's no doubt a message
[54:52] that come from there many quotes I can
[54:54] pull from that you know in scriptures
[54:56] and things sometimes our imagination is
[54:58] a very powerful thing imagination it can
[55:01] make it seem very very very very very
[55:03] very real and yet it's not real at all
[55:07] but I'm grateful to God I want to say
[55:09] thank you for your prayers for him and
[55:12] uh just may God uh richly richly bless
[55:15] you we want to continue to keep his
[55:17] family in prayer um today I thought
[55:20] about as I looked over there and I seen
[55:21] him and um Gabe was just a tremendous
[55:25] man and um
[55:27] there's a lot that he he would do for me
[55:29] Sam here take this tool try this out try
[55:31] this do this and do that and you know he
[55:33] was you know guiding me along in certain
[55:35] things and but he was just he was just a
[55:37] tremendous man and um I thought when I
[55:41] looked over there and I seen that to
[55:42] where today's Father's Day and his
[55:44] daughter she's 16 and just um lovely
[55:48] children the little boy he's 12 and so
[55:52] just remember them in prayer if you
[55:53] would the God who just just just
[55:55] minister to them and and help them amen
[55:58] through this and uh also we want to
[56:01] remember continue remember the Hoyer
[56:03] family I know brother Ed Hoyer he was
[56:05] headed on his way to BC I think he's
[56:08] there with brother Andrew his son now so
[56:10] we're thankful for that and uh some
[56:12] things you know being connecting with
[56:14] the family so you just keep them in
[56:16] prayer I I didn't mean to take time like
[56:18] this cuz I don't worry I know all this
[56:20] time
[56:21] counts I know every bit of time when I
[56:23] stand here it counts uh but um I just
[56:27] would like to just speak to you here a
[56:29] few moments and um this morning by the
[56:33] grace of God and I also want to mention
[56:35] brother this Thursday brother Brandon
[56:37] cicola is going to come and Minister be
[56:39] ministering for us uh my family and I
[56:41] are going to actually take just a few
[56:43] days here just to get away and it's been
[56:45] a couple years since I had done that and
[56:49] um you know I just uh just as we're
[56:51] coming off of a ministering trip and I
[56:54] tell you when I I'm just to give a
[56:56] little background on some things uh when
[56:59] when I'm not here and I'm on a
[57:00] ministering trip I really covet your
[57:02] prayers uh because it would be easier
[57:05] for me to stay here and be at home than
[57:08] go and Minister because when you go when
[57:10] it coming out like that it's not only
[57:11] the travel but it's the burden on My
[57:14] Heart Lord what do I say to these people
[57:18] and many of the times I go I don't know
[57:20] you know sometimes God will let you know
[57:22] in advance what you're going to speak on
[57:24] and other times it's not and I just
[57:26] trust him I know when he's laid the
[57:27] burden on my heart but then it's it's
[57:29] almost like you feel just even a greater
[57:30] release than I do on a normal
[57:32] Monday but I just I maybe you don't
[57:36] understand that and that's okay but I'm
[57:37] just asking you to pray for me when we
[57:39] when we go like that because I Lord
[57:41] knows I would rather just stay here it
[57:43] would be uh be easier so we love you and
[57:46] I want you to say this on the other side
[57:48] you'll see the effect of your prayers
[57:51] amen amen you'll see the other effect
[57:53] you you are a part of it amen this of
[57:55] the Ministry that God has brought us
[57:58] together and we're a part of the same
[57:59] vision we're part of the same vision
[58:02] we're not separate Vision we're part of
[58:04] it we're together so I want to speak
[58:06] here just a a few moments and I will
[58:08] just lay this in here uh this morning on
[58:11] Great Men of
[58:13] God and I want to begin just with
[58:16] reading a the Psalm of Life by Henry
[58:19] wodsworth Long Fellow you're familiar
[58:21] brother brandham quoted this many many
[58:24] times in the message and and this this
[58:28] was written with a purpose that young
[58:30] men and others would recognize there's a
[58:33] purpose in life there's an objective in
[58:36] life and how that God himself molds and
[58:40] shapes our life this written a long time
[58:43] ago but brother Brandon would always
[58:45] draw from it and especially the last
[58:47] stanza you'll recognize a lot he's
[58:49] referred to the whole thing before but
[58:50] let me read this he says here here he
[58:53] begins on the writing of this psalm tell
[58:56] me not in mournful numbers life is but
[58:59] an empty dream for the soul is dead that
[59:02] Slumbers and things are not what they
[59:05] seem life is real life is earnest and
[59:09] the grave is not its goal dust Thou Art
[59:14] to dust returnest was not spoken of the
[59:16] Soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is our
[59:21] destined end or way but to act that each
[59:25] tomorrow tomorrow find us farther than
[59:28] today Hallelujah art is long and time is
[59:32] fleeting and our hearts though Stout and
[59:35] brave still like muffled drums are
[59:39] beating funeral marches to the grave in
[59:43] the world's broad field of battle in the
[59:46] bavc of Life be not like dumb driven
[59:50] cattle be a hero in The Strife trust no
[59:54] future however ever Pleasant Let the
[59:57] dead past bury its dead act act in the
[1:00:02] living present heart within and God
[1:00:06] overhead lives of Great Men all remind
[1:00:09] us we can make our lives Sublime and
[1:00:13] departing leave behind us footprints on
[1:00:17] the sands of time footprints that
[1:00:20] perhaps another sailing over life solom
[1:00:23] man a forlorn and ship brother seeing
[1:00:27] shall take heart again let us then be up
[1:00:30] and doing with a heart for any fate
[1:00:33] still achieving still pursuing learn to
[1:00:37] labor and to
[1:00:40] wait I want to look here in this as we
[1:00:44] look at that in that Psalm of Life it's
[1:00:47] very clear that every like brother brand
[1:00:49] would tell us every heartbeat we're
[1:00:51] we're closer we're closer if God carries
[1:00:54] we're every Every Beat is closer to that
[1:00:56] that to that moment if the Lord terries
[1:00:58] we will all go by the way of the grave
[1:01:00] and what matters within it all is that
[1:01:03] the purpose that in life and that is the
[1:01:06] main purpose and the main purpose is to
[1:01:09] be born of the spirit of God and then
[1:01:13] allow God to unfold the purpose that he
[1:01:17] has intended and brought and and intend
[1:01:21] for each of our life because our life
[1:01:24] we're we're not here for a temporal
[1:01:26] purpose Paul would would Express that
[1:01:29] from his heart what God had put in his
[1:01:31] heart we are here for an eternal purpose
[1:01:33] if God has called us to be a part of his
[1:01:38] word of himself in this hour there's an
[1:01:41] eternal purpose that God has called us
[1:01:44] to and it's God that unfolds that
[1:01:48] purpose to our life and though as we
[1:01:50] read here in that Psalm there are uh
[1:01:53] great men are not men that are
[1:01:56] mistake-free great men are not men that
[1:01:59] are perfect in themselves but great men
[1:02:03] are men that whom God would speak to and
[1:02:07] they respond to his voice and take a
[1:02:11] hold of that promise that takes a hold
[1:02:13] of their life and seek to become what
[1:02:16] God has ordained and is calling and
[1:02:19] moving in their heart to become that's
[1:02:21] great men of God this is why when
[1:02:24] Longfellow would write that there as it
[1:02:25] says even when you have uh you know a a
[1:02:29] a a you know a Shipwrecked brother a
[1:02:31] forlorn brother but they can look at
[1:02:33] another that's gone ahead and say my how
[1:02:36] that they were knocked down here knocked
[1:02:38] down here knocked down here but they got
[1:02:40] back up what was it in them that caused
[1:02:42] them to get back
[1:02:45] up and that's that's what we're that's
[1:02:47] what we're looking for is that is
[1:02:50] looking at that having a real example
[1:02:52] Great Men of God I want to just read
[1:02:55] here out of Isaiah 60:1 the Bible said
[1:02:58] arise and shine for thy light is come
[1:03:02] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:03:04] thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover
[1:03:07] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[1:03:09] but the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[1:03:12] His glory shall be seen upon thee now
[1:03:17] you know this written here uh by by
[1:03:21] Isaiah moved by the spirit of God but it
[1:03:24] was written promise for this hour you
[1:03:28] see not only has God stored up the
[1:03:31] wisdom that is needed for the moment but
[1:03:35] God in himself by his Spirit reaches in
[1:03:40] those deep Waters and brings out the
[1:03:44] understanding that's needed for this
[1:03:46] moment you I you I could never have
[1:03:50] found these places all the way through
[1:03:53] the scripture and you recognize that the
[1:03:55] Bible itself is a book that's written
[1:03:58] for this hour we're not just having a a
[1:04:02] a a promise that we're looking to just
[1:04:05] one promise but we recognize that the
[1:04:07] whole the prophets and sages and all
[1:04:11] have looked and longed for this hour to
[1:04:14] come this hour of the Rapture this
[1:04:17] moment because when as the Rapture is
[1:04:20] upon us the Gentile Church being C away
[1:04:23] then we recognize that Israel receives
[1:04:26] her visitation and God's made a promise
[1:04:29] he's going to bring little Benjamin back
[1:04:32] God's going to he's going to restore
[1:04:34] Israel and this is where God is going to
[1:04:37] fulfill his word of even planting her in
[1:04:41] the land God is going to bring about
[1:04:44] that Millennium it's going to lead into
[1:04:47] the future home we we are here at the
[1:04:50] time of the ending of all
[1:04:53] things and you recognize that the the
[1:04:57] the corruption and everything that we
[1:04:58] see around us if let me just say it like
[1:05:01] this if you can't see that the world
[1:05:04] itself is falling apart then you need
[1:05:07] you need your eyes
[1:05:09] renewed because the world is full of
[1:05:13] corruption and deceit things are so
[1:05:15] confused there's no longer we're living
[1:05:18] in a world that hates
[1:05:21] absolutes they call good evil and evil
[1:05:24] good
[1:05:26] they we're living in a time in an hour
[1:05:27] and let me just say this to you to
[1:05:29] understand it's not the people it's
[1:05:34] Spirits because people listen listen in
[1:05:37] a man in his normal reasoning would not
[1:05:40] even think that
[1:05:42] way this is why the prophet said in in
[1:05:45] going beyond the camp he says Satan is
[1:05:48] taking his people beyond the camp of
[1:05:52] human
[1:05:53] reasoning that's good the simple things
[1:05:58] that should be known things that you
[1:06:00] don't need the Bible to know are you
[1:06:04] hearing me simple things and yet Satan
[1:06:08] is taking people beyond the camp of
[1:06:10] human reasoning now at the same time God
[1:06:14] is taking his people Beyond human
[1:06:19] reasoning but bringing us back into the
[1:06:23] mind of Christ because now with the mind
[1:06:26] of Christ then we have a judgment that
[1:06:29] can set at the Gate of reasoning and say
[1:06:32] that's not according to the word not
[1:06:35] going to take that you see th it's
[1:06:37] important and this is where God has
[1:06:40] brought you and I too in this hour by
[1:06:43] the grace of God through the holy spirit
[1:06:45] this is the strength of the hour and let
[1:06:47] me tell you knowledge itself is not
[1:06:50] enough to stem the tide of this
[1:06:53] hour you say what do you mean by that
[1:06:56] well in the days of Noah in the days of
[1:06:59] Noah the only thing that could withstand
[1:07:02] the waters the flood waters was being in
[1:07:06] that Ark and that Ark was to be in
[1:07:10] Christ amen that Revelation that Noah
[1:07:13] had received it was a vision it was a
[1:07:16] word from God and he be to labor in that
[1:07:20] vision and what he had as a vision as a
[1:07:23] word from the Lord became became
[1:07:27] material people laughed at the vision at
[1:07:30] what he said but when the vision became
[1:07:33] material when that became material then
[1:07:37] it was time for the prophecy to fully be
[1:07:41] fulfilled and the same way the word of
[1:07:44] the Lord has come to your life by vision
[1:07:47] and you're walking by faith which is
[1:07:50] God's revealed word and that Vision in
[1:07:53] your life what others can't see what
[1:07:56] others don't know about but it has laid
[1:07:58] hold on your life it's affecting your
[1:08:00] life and your Works declare the faith
[1:08:03] that's in your life from The Unseen
[1:08:07] realm and as this word is becoming
[1:08:11] material one of these moments it'll be
[1:08:14] the final moment for the word becoming
[1:08:18] material becoming flesh in our life you
[1:08:23] understand what I'm saying the word is
[1:08:25] wanting to become flesh this is why even
[1:08:29] the Holy Spirit deals with the life to
[1:08:31] lead us into repentance to bring
[1:08:34] conviction on our life and dealing why
[1:08:36] would God deal with things that you
[1:08:37] could look at and say that's very
[1:08:39] minuscule why does God have to deal with
[1:08:41] us about dress and this and that God
[1:08:43] takes little simple things to show that
[1:08:45] there's certain things that are not
[1:08:47] hitting the Mark just to do point out
[1:08:49] for one thing what spirit is in you if
[1:08:52] that Spirit resists the word or explains
[1:08:55] the word away it's not the Holy Spirit
[1:08:58] we can have the spirit of God on our
[1:09:00] flesh we can have it on our mind listen
[1:09:02] we can even enjoy his presence sitting
[1:09:05] right here but it's got to come to where
[1:09:08] it's more than just us benefiting or
[1:09:11] what he can do for me and how he makes
[1:09:13] me feel it's got to come to where the
[1:09:16] blessing comes to the place that it is
[1:09:19] ordained to come and that's the place
[1:09:22] where the blessing becomes life
[1:09:26] that's good yes sir is that right this
[1:09:29] is how God works and he deals with our
[1:09:32] life in such a very h a very special way
[1:09:35] we're living in a time in an hour and a
[1:09:38] season we're in that you know uh uh as
[1:09:42] we said knowing them they could not in
[1:09:44] that day they did not have the strength
[1:09:46] to stem the tide they had boats they had
[1:09:49] boats they had
[1:09:51] ships yeah Noah wasn't the only
[1:09:53] one but the with Noah he had a god
[1:09:57] constructed
[1:09:59] boat there you go some of them may have
[1:10:01] had a two-l boat may had a one Lev boat
[1:10:06] they might have just had a justification
[1:10:07] some might have had a justification
[1:10:09] sanctification but Noah had a three
[1:10:11] level
[1:10:12] boat and in that uppermost part of that
[1:10:16] boat he had a
[1:10:18] window there was a door opened in heaven
[1:10:21] that said come up hither
[1:10:24] hallu are you hearing me now he had
[1:10:27] there was a strength now look what Noah
[1:10:29] did as a great man of God his family was
[1:10:33] moved around the vision that God had in
[1:10:37] his heart decisions that they made in
[1:10:40] Noah's house was based on the vision of
[1:10:44] the
[1:10:46] word are you hearing
[1:10:48] me they could have come to knowah Daddy
[1:10:51] there's another field down the way we
[1:10:52] can plow that field and still be able to
[1:10:54] work on the we can do all of this and
[1:10:57] Noah no doubt Noah was tempted and to
[1:11:00] look daddy we'll be able to have more
[1:11:02] resources daddy will be able to do this
[1:11:04] but it would have to come back to if
[1:11:06] anything is going to take away and there
[1:11:09] moves the vision from being first
[1:11:12] priority then we're missing the mark but
[1:11:14] but Daddy we might need this we might
[1:11:16] need that if God gave the vision then
[1:11:19] God Will Supply the need in this
[1:11:23] hour that's a great man of God hallelu
[1:11:28] see in this the scripture I read that
[1:11:30] gross Darkness that's spiritual that's
[1:11:33] spirits that are upon the people brother
[1:11:36] BR says in the message Shalom and he's
[1:11:38] talking about this and many times he
[1:11:40] talks about it even then going beyond
[1:11:41] the camp and things he said men are
[1:11:43] becoming more like women women are
[1:11:45] becoming more like men do you know this
[1:11:47] didn't start in this age if you trace
[1:11:51] back that feminist M movement which is
[1:11:53] to Dem masculin that's right that
[1:11:56] started back in the 1800s yeah that's
[1:11:59] right that's right there's seeds that
[1:12:01] came about and all of those things it
[1:12:03] begin to come about that's
[1:12:08] right seeds produce a
[1:12:12] crop and you say well we're talking
[1:12:15] about spirits but do you realize the
[1:12:17] Holy Spirit Travels by the
[1:12:21] word Spirits travel by words this is why
[1:12:25] be careful little eyes what you see be
[1:12:28] careful little ears what you hear that's
[1:12:32] are you hearing me Spirits travel by
[1:12:35] words this is why brother Bram could say
[1:12:37] and you must be born again false
[1:12:38] teachers produce false
[1:12:42] births because word that's why this
[1:12:44] listen this is why that a minister his
[1:12:47] life should be clean before
[1:12:50] Goden because if not if it's not clean
[1:12:53] that spirit will try I don't care how
[1:12:55] how precise that he is if there's
[1:12:58] anything in his heart that's not right
[1:12:59] it'll travel with that word that's right
[1:13:02] right that's responsibility and let me
[1:13:04] just say this that should not only be
[1:13:07] the requirement that we hold Ministry to
[1:13:10] but it should be the requirement in our
[1:13:13] lives when I say something I want the
[1:13:15] Holy Spirit to be the amen behind
[1:13:20] it not to where it reaches something in
[1:13:23] my life and it's coming out and it it's
[1:13:25] bitterness it can't go no further it
[1:13:27] can't be effective the word words words
[1:13:31] that come out of our mouth it's not the
[1:13:33] words that are effective out of the
[1:13:35] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:13:38] speaketh this is why David said not not
[1:13:40] only let my words but let the meditation
[1:13:43] of my heart be acceptable in thy sight
[1:13:45] oh God this is an hour for the heart
[1:13:48] this what this message come to do was to
[1:13:51] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:13:54] father
[1:13:55] and that Faith was a Bible Faith it's a
[1:13:59] faith that is produced by the Holy
[1:14:01] Spirit himself living in your life that
[1:14:04] will punctuate every word to be amen
[1:14:08] even when the word comes and it corrects
[1:14:11] our life a great man of God will stand
[1:14:13] with that word and say so be it Lord I'm
[1:14:17] wrong I'm missing the mark right here
[1:14:19] but your word is true Lord be it unto me
[1:14:22] according to Thy word yes
[1:14:28] we have to step up to the duty you just
[1:14:31] brother B says it's like a heavy this he
[1:14:34] said it's like a heavy dark fog that's
[1:14:36] over the whole earth and we see it we
[1:14:40] see it it's smothering this is what he
[1:14:42] says it's smothering out real
[1:14:47] manhood real
[1:14:52] Womanhood yes sir
[1:14:55] wow many of
[1:14:57] even teachers I've never asked them
[1:15:00] different ones I've talked
[1:15:02] to they've come up to me and different
[1:15:05] ones that's asked and they've they've
[1:15:06] spoken hey they're looking to get out of
[1:15:10] it yeah
[1:15:12] right that's right because of the way
[1:15:16] things have got
[1:15:18] to sure who would have thought a kitty
[1:15:22] litter box in a classroom or in a
[1:15:26] bathroom you say oh that's just far out
[1:15:28] listen we used to be living in a time
[1:15:31] where you could put it off as West Coast
[1:15:33] and East Coast but the worldwide web has
[1:15:37] linked everything together to where it
[1:15:41] don't matter how country buunk in the
[1:15:43] school is or how Uptown City it is them
[1:15:47] Spirits have venues to travel through
[1:15:50] and it's affecting and influencing
[1:15:53] lives amen yes true let me just say it
[1:15:56] as plain as I know how God made a man to
[1:15:59] be a
[1:16:00] man the scriptures said he made them
[1:16:03] male have you not read he made them male
[1:16:07] and female in the
[1:16:13] beginning and just in case they want to
[1:16:15] argue they've you know got all these
[1:16:18] signs on restrooms now somebody was
[1:16:21] telling me of a of a place where they've
[1:16:23] got this sign you know where it's either
[1:16:25] you know it's neutral and then they got
[1:16:26] a sign next to it I guess somebody might
[1:16:28] been trying to been funny they said they
[1:16:29] got this old ugly looking thing and they
[1:16:31] said whatever
[1:16:33] too it's Spirits friends it's Spirits
[1:16:37] it's not the people I hope you
[1:16:39] understand what I'm saying it's not the
[1:16:41] people it's no there's no Reformation
[1:16:44] there's no psychologist there's no
[1:16:46] psychiatrist there is no answer for the
[1:16:49] crisis in this hour but the coming of
[1:16:52] the Lord
[1:16:55] it's the coming of the Lord that's the
[1:16:57] only hope for this world that's the only
[1:16:59] hope for a life that's under darkness is
[1:17:02] the coming of the Lord because when the
[1:17:04] Lord has come in your
[1:17:07] life he changes you from death unto life
[1:17:12] he removes confusion from your
[1:17:19] life that's what he does
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:25] but the
[1:17:27] confusion is not because of psychologist
[1:17:30] and psychiatrist they've only Fallen
[1:17:33] under it the confusion is because of
[1:17:37] that which calls herself the mother
[1:17:41] church and every one of her daughters
[1:17:45] that's come out of
[1:17:47] her at one time they despised her and
[1:17:50] came out in reformation and great
[1:17:52] Protestant but after so long a time they
[1:17:56] begin to look back we need to go back to
[1:17:58] Mama they begin to compromise they begin
[1:18:01] to let down let me tell you when God is
[1:18:03] in your life you don't have to back down
[1:18:06] one ioda from any
[1:18:09] devil I don't care how you feel I don't
[1:18:13] care how great the situation is before
[1:18:15] you you have an authority by God's word
[1:18:19] in this hour if you'll stand for God
[1:18:22] he'll stand for you
[1:18:25] we're living in a generation that's
[1:18:27] ashamed of the son of man they're
[1:18:30] ashamed of the word to be made flesh but
[1:18:32] the scripture said if you'll not be
[1:18:34] ashamed of me and my words in this
[1:18:38] generation then I'll not be ashamed of
[1:18:41] you I tell you need to throw off
[1:18:43] shameful feelings you need to throw off
[1:18:45] shameful complexes and say I'm going to
[1:18:48] stand for God's
[1:18:50] word I'm going to stand on God's word
[1:18:52] I'm going to say Amen to the word of
[1:18:58] God you first got to agree with God's
[1:19:02] word but it Smothers it
[1:19:06] out Smothers it out to where that men
[1:19:10] and women don't want to stand like they
[1:19:13] ought to
[1:19:15] stand
[1:19:17] compromising I'm not here to ril on
[1:19:19] anybody I want you I hope you understand
[1:19:21] that I think you
[1:19:23] do I haven't watched any the video but
[1:19:25] I've seen the headlines oh the Southern
[1:19:27] Baptist convention has just had their
[1:19:28] big vote to allow women pastors when was
[1:19:31] that ever a
[1:19:34] vote when was voting on whether or not
[1:19:38] God's word still
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:41] applies you know why they do that
[1:19:44] because it started out with them
[1:19:46] rejecting God's own
[1:19:49] life look Calvary is a wonderful thing
[1:19:52] but Calvary was not meant to just be
[1:19:54] something that you look at and see he
[1:19:57] was my sin Bearer it's to realize it was
[1:19:59] also the way that was made for you that
[1:20:03] you and I could follow him in through
[1:20:06] victory that he submitted his own will
[1:20:09] to the will of God that the will of God
[1:20:12] might come to you and I that we would
[1:20:14] not be born of the will of man but of
[1:20:16] the will of
[1:20:20] God that's what he did
[1:20:31] a real stand like men ought to be and
[1:20:34] take a stand right brother BR you know
[1:20:37] he says it like this I don't have this
[1:20:38] quoted but I have it in front of me here
[1:20:40] I just wanted to refer to and he says
[1:20:42] you know see the man out there wearing
[1:20:44] velvet pink shoes and stuff like that
[1:20:46] and they become more like women women
[1:20:49] smoking cigarettes and now they got
[1:20:51] cigars and cut their hair like men and
[1:20:54] the dainty lady feminist something is
[1:20:57] gone and the real masculine man is gone
[1:21:02] all he seems to think about is something
[1:21:04] evil on the other
[1:21:08] side well brother Samuel you know it's
[1:21:10] just normal for a man to think about
[1:21:13] certain
[1:21:16] things oh it got quiet
[1:21:19] now that's just normal normal normal for
[1:21:23] what what who stand
[1:21:28] you know the Bible said whosoever lookth
[1:21:30] upon a woman to lust after her hath
[1:21:32] committed adultery with her already in
[1:21:35] his heart sisters let me tell you
[1:21:37] something when you when you dress in a
[1:21:39] provocative way it's not the holy spirit
[1:21:42] that would lead you to display
[1:21:45] flesh you might be covered up flesh all
[1:21:48] the way up to here and all the way down
[1:21:50] to your toes but it's also how that
[1:21:53] you've covered that FL
[1:21:55] too amen come on the spirit of God leads
[1:22:00] you to Veil
[1:22:03] yourself that's that that that's a
[1:22:05] simple look at that's just even a simple
[1:22:07] litmus test to say what's the desire of
[1:22:09] my heart what's the desire of my life
[1:22:12] let me tell you God created you the way
[1:22:15] he wanted you and it's natural desire to
[1:22:19] want to look beautiful but don't let
[1:22:22] Satan that interpreter that came the
[1:22:25] don't let him interpret
[1:22:28] it are you hearing me don't let him
[1:22:30] interpret it you let God's word be the
[1:22:33] truth and every other man's word be a
[1:22:39] lie yes maybe you didn't have a father
[1:22:43] or somebody who really showed you what
[1:22:46] it was like for a man to treat a young
[1:22:48] lady maybe you didn't have a daughter or
[1:22:51] a father that actually would be able to
[1:22:55] to express to you who what your beauty
[1:22:57] was that you're beautiful you you have
[1:23:01] God I don't we're just going to go with
[1:23:02] this but you see that's that in itself
[1:23:06] God is a God that specializes in going
[1:23:09] down into areas that nely where you can
[1:23:12] look at and say that's the truth but
[1:23:15] there's something that wants to hold
[1:23:16] over and keep you from obeying it I
[1:23:18] would look down and say God go to the
[1:23:20] innermost part of my life if there's
[1:23:22] anything that's been tied up that would
[1:23:24] be hindering me from saying Amen to the
[1:23:27] word that I am fearfully and wonderfully
[1:23:30] made and every part of your word is
[1:23:32] yaying amen then God go down to the
[1:23:35] depths of the subconscious if there's
[1:23:37] something that's been said that I've
[1:23:39] retained that I'm not even aware of if
[1:23:42] there was something that was lacking in
[1:23:43] my life then God you are my heavenly
[1:23:47] father you knew I would be here Lord
[1:23:49] you're the one who cares for me nobody
[1:23:52] ever cared for me like Jesus
[1:23:56] I'm telling you God rolls up his sleeves
[1:23:58] in this hour and goes to
[1:24:03] work that's good if God would deal with
[1:24:06] a little life that had been chased by a
[1:24:08] big yellow dog when she was just a
[1:24:10] little girl and that fear had been in
[1:24:12] her life and the Holy Spirit would go
[1:24:13] down in that subconscious and relieve
[1:24:16] her from that the same spirit of God
[1:24:19] works right down in your subconscious in
[1:24:22] my subconscious to relieve us from
[1:24:24] things that either weren't said or
[1:24:27] things that were said things that
[1:24:29] weren't done or were
[1:24:31] done are you hearing me friends I'm
[1:24:34] talking about I'm talking about our
[1:24:35] heavenly father one who's there he
[1:24:38] brings healing in his wings there is
[1:24:44] healing hallelujah hallelujah so sure
[1:24:48] man in himself you can say well isn't
[1:24:50] that part still there and isn't well
[1:24:52] sure there's desires there but just see
[1:24:54] this is why it's just like when when
[1:24:56] young it could be young men that would
[1:24:58] come and you know don't matter where I'm
[1:25:00] at in camps or whatever brother Samuel I
[1:25:02] I want I want you to pray and ask God to
[1:25:04] take this lust Spirit from me and my
[1:25:06] response is God has given you a desire
[1:25:09] in your heart he's put that desire in
[1:25:11] your life now we want to bring it under
[1:25:13] the control of the holy
[1:25:16] spirit it's not saying God Strip This
[1:25:18] desire out of me that you know that you
[1:25:20] know that I there there's an attraction
[1:25:22] it's not that let it come under the
[1:25:24] Govern
[1:25:24] of the Holy
[1:25:27] Spirit that's what we want we want it to
[1:25:29] be under the governance of the Holy
[1:25:30] Spirit Hallelujah yes sir because
[1:25:33] remember the prophet himself had a cross
[1:25:35] he hung in his
[1:25:37] car and he said don't tell me he said
[1:25:40] that there's not a spirit that don't try
[1:25:41] to come over you when you see an ungodly
[1:25:43] woman he said I've had the Holy Ghost
[1:25:45] for years that's right you see our our
[1:25:48] Prophet was not he's not one he was he
[1:25:51] was a real man yes he was let me tell
[1:25:54] you something God work remember what
[1:25:55] Paul said you got many inst structures
[1:25:57] but you got one father in The Gospel is
[1:25:59] that right and to recognize that how
[1:26:01] this word has brought you and I into a
[1:26:03] place to where what it does it
[1:26:05] dismantles confusion as we feed on this
[1:26:07] word we're setting under this word
[1:26:09] because this word has not come from the
[1:26:11] origin of man this word has come from
[1:26:15] the mind of
[1:26:17] God we're not living in the hour of
[1:26:20] presuming and probing we're living in
[1:26:22] the hour we're saying that were laying
[1:26:25] loose are now tied together and we can
[1:26:28] see
[1:26:29] Christ clearly is so and let me tell you
[1:26:34] it took a great man of God to do that
[1:26:36] I'm not talking about the DNA of William
[1:26:38] brandom but I'm talking about when a man
[1:26:39] who was willing to stand there on what
[1:26:42] God had revealed to him and when every
[1:26:44] denomination when everything turned him
[1:26:47] down he wouldn't been to it they brought
[1:26:49] checks on the platform they they
[1:26:51] promised we'll buy you a jet we'll give
[1:26:53] you money but here was one listen this
[1:26:55] was an example to show that it's more
[1:26:58] than the fortitude of a man it was a
[1:27:01] revelation taking hold in the heart of
[1:27:04] God's prophet and he was ordained for
[1:27:07] this hour he was ordained for that so
[1:27:11] it's not you or me trying to compare
[1:27:13] ourselves with brother brandham but it's
[1:27:15] that quality of the Holy Spirit of the
[1:27:18] new birth in this hour that has come
[1:27:21] I've Got Confidence that the same ho ho
[1:27:24] ghost he has I've received it'll bring
[1:27:27] me to where it brought
[1:27:29] him that's the
[1:27:32] confidence not you or me comparing
[1:27:34] ourselves with brother bradam but it was
[1:27:36] to compare ourselves with the
[1:27:41] word and to recognize oh a great man it
[1:27:45] isn't that a great man's going to have
[1:27:46] all the pats on the back and thought of
[1:27:48] this way and thought of that way but a
[1:27:50] great man of God is a man that will
[1:27:53] stand for
[1:27:54] God will stand for truth he might have
[1:27:58] to stand alone but he'll
[1:28:04] stand this is why David in Psalms
[1:28:09] 144 Psalms
[1:28:11] 144 he
[1:28:13] said I will sing a new song unto thee Oh
[1:28:16] God upon a salt tree and an instrument
[1:28:19] of 10 strings will I praise Praises unto
[1:28:21] thee it is he that giveth salvation unto
[1:28:24] Kings who
[1:28:43] deliverthat that is so good that what
[1:28:46] was it what was it that made David a
[1:28:47] great man was it because that he was
[1:28:49] mistake free you heard that preached on
[1:28:50] last Sunday but what you found was is he
[1:28:54] was one who realized I am not the king
[1:28:59] exclusively here on Earth but my king is
[1:29:03] the Lord God
[1:29:04] Almighty I didn't come into this
[1:29:07] position simply because I happened to be
[1:29:10] at the right place at the right time God
[1:29:13] ordered my footsteps God has brought me
[1:29:16] through
[1:29:17] experiences and the same God hallelujah
[1:29:22] that brought David into that
[1:29:24] that same God molded David shaped David
[1:29:29] and brought him into
[1:29:31] position I never forget it brother
[1:29:33] Wendell mentioned something like it but
[1:29:36] I always think about my here was on a
[1:29:38] midweek service and my dad was
[1:29:40] ministering and it was one of those
[1:29:41] moments that just always stuck with me
[1:29:43] and I had really loved it he said God he
[1:29:46] took it it said God called David he had
[1:29:49] chosen David called him and anointed him
[1:29:52] and once David got anointed then he
[1:29:54] groomed
[1:29:56] him see this is why the anointing is
[1:29:59] different from the
[1:30:01] adoption the anointing the new birth is
[1:30:04] not your
[1:30:05] adoption we grow up into him in all
[1:30:10] things you see this is why the mind of
[1:30:13] Christ setting down and oh my don't you
[1:30:16] love him now what's what's how David
[1:30:18] David takes this approach here just give
[1:30:20] me just a few moments to lay this part
[1:30:22] in David David sees this and he says rid
[1:30:25] me and Deliver Me from the hand of
[1:30:28] strange children that word strange means
[1:30:30] foreign remember God didn't want his
[1:30:32] people mixing with the inhabitants of
[1:30:34] the land he said God told him he said if
[1:30:37] you allow the inhabitants to remain I'm
[1:30:40] warning you if you're not fellowshipping
[1:30:42] with the right ones your children are
[1:30:44] going to end up marrying
[1:30:46] them come on God had to deal with that
[1:30:48] in
[1:30:49] Nehemiah is that right when Nehemiah
[1:30:51] came back and said why are some of them
[1:30:53] speaking this some of them speaking this
[1:30:54] language a asked and some speaking this
[1:30:57] and some hey wait a minute we don't want
[1:30:58] a bunch of
[1:31:01] languages do you realize that's what God
[1:31:03] did in this hour we had a Baptist
[1:31:04] language Lutheran language Methodist
[1:31:06] language but God came and
[1:31:09] restored a pure
[1:31:12] language the language of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:15] of the word back into the Church of the
[1:31:18] Living
[1:31:20] God God changed your language he took
[1:31:23] the names of bow out of your
[1:31:26] mouth because as long as you had the
[1:31:28] names of bow you couldn't see yourself
[1:31:31] for who you really were and did not see
[1:31:33] that God and Christ are one and all that
[1:31:35] God has put in Christ he have poured
[1:31:38] into the church God took those names out
[1:31:41] how did he take the names out he took it
[1:31:43] out of your
[1:31:44] heart your heart has been turned
[1:31:49] back a language that was dead a language
[1:31:53] that was faint but God has brought a
[1:31:56] people back into the
[1:31:58] land once again the spirit of God is in
[1:32:01] the Land once again once again the
[1:32:03] people are hearing direct from God as
[1:32:05] they did at the day of
[1:32:09] Pentecost direct
[1:32:13] line
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:16] Hallelujah deliver me from the hand of
[1:32:18] stranger R me I I I I don't want to see
[1:32:21] how much I can mix I don't want to see
[1:32:22] how much I can fit in I don't want I
[1:32:24] don't want
[1:32:27] that and whose mouth speaketh
[1:32:32] vanity and their right hand is a right
[1:32:35] hand of
[1:32:36] falsehood and not real
[1:32:41] strength my why David why that our sons
[1:32:47] may be as plants grown up in their
[1:32:50] youth that our daughters may be as
[1:32:53] Cornerstone Stones polished after the
[1:32:57] similitude of a
[1:32:59] palace
[1:33:01] that's separation God calls for
[1:33:04] separation listen God still calls for
[1:33:07] separation God continues to call for
[1:33:10] separation sometimes the separation
[1:33:12] maybe where you're sitting at today is
[1:33:13] not about smoking drinking and and lust
[1:33:16] and all these other things out here
[1:33:17] maybe it's it's beyond that God's
[1:33:18] calling you and I to a separation to
[1:33:21] where it's separating from see taste
[1:33:23] feel smell here conscience memory
[1:33:25] reasoning affection that's what God is
[1:33:27] calling Abraham's seed to it's
[1:33:31] separation now I know through this
[1:33:33] building right here we've all been
[1:33:34] called to that maybe just as like I
[1:33:36] expressed right here when I was talking
[1:33:38] about my neighbor God called me to
[1:33:39] separate hey hey Samuel your thoughts
[1:33:42] about it let me tell you it was
[1:33:46] wrong seemed awful real I mean I was
[1:33:48] looking at things I was so burdened but
[1:33:50] God called me to a separation now I had
[1:33:53] a choice I could continue to stay with
[1:33:55] those same thoughts or I could take what
[1:33:57] God was leading me and showing me you
[1:34:00] see so sometimes the separation just
[1:34:01] simply where we're laying it down as God
[1:34:04] deals with it oh
[1:34:09] my go to that verse 15 at the end this
[1:34:12] is the result David talks about other
[1:34:14] things happy is that people that is in
[1:34:16] such a case yeah happy is that people
[1:34:19] whose God is the
[1:34:22] Lord I want say it takes the real source
[1:34:26] to bring forth the real thing in a man
[1:34:28] or woman to bring that right example of
[1:34:31] what manhood Womanhood and Christianity
[1:34:33] ought to be you recognize that here
[1:34:36] within it brother brand would make
[1:34:38] statements and I'm just going to refer
[1:34:39] to these and he would say he says man he
[1:34:42] said you can see men that are just
[1:34:43] strapping and man I mean they're just
[1:34:46] you know it seems like they're just the
[1:34:47] absolute physique of what a man should
[1:34:50] be now listen brother brandham appre
[1:34:53] appreciated
[1:34:56] manhood you remember when when he was
[1:34:58] had that complex and was going to go off
[1:35:00] and he talked about that man who came in
[1:35:02] there and eating pancakes at the at the
[1:35:04] diner him and Billy and that man he said
[1:35:06] he let out a big I
[1:35:08] chewy brother bram's I thought
[1:35:12] yeah brother Bram wasn't an ogre he
[1:35:14] wasn't a brute but what he was seeing is
[1:35:18] is where men themselves were becoming so
[1:35:21] dainty you know why it's a spirit upon
[1:35:25] the
[1:35:26] age you know why Ahab acted the way he
[1:35:29] did because not only was he a
[1:35:32] half-hearted
[1:35:33] Believer but he married a woman that
[1:35:37] turned his
[1:35:41] heart she was taken and Smitten by her
[1:35:44] beauty but she brought her religion with
[1:35:48] her she brought her beliefs her teaching
[1:35:52] she brought it with
[1:35:55] her it all comes with every bill every
[1:35:59] debt everything
[1:36:01] comes it's a complete package is that
[1:36:05] right well some of y'all got quiet you
[1:36:06] don't know if I say Amen or
[1:36:08] not but you see this is the
[1:36:11] result no doubt Ahab was a man now
[1:36:15] remember Ahab himself was live he was
[1:36:17] raised in a home it was a lukewarm home
[1:36:19] it was a home that you know they they
[1:36:22] they were Israelites they were Jews but
[1:36:24] they weren't fervent in serving God they
[1:36:26] just they just let little things go and
[1:36:28] and begin to just explain things away
[1:36:30] and look what it did for this young man
[1:36:33] who now become a husband he was no more
[1:36:36] fit to lead a home than nothing you know
[1:36:40] why the lack of training from when he
[1:36:42] was just
[1:36:44] young oh they got quiet you realize
[1:36:48] these are things it isn't just something
[1:36:49] what's packed in us and all of a sudden
[1:36:51] one day it just all of a sudden comes
[1:36:53] out that's good but you see listen it's
[1:36:55] the same way with God how could you and
[1:36:58] I come in listen now how could you and I
[1:37:01] come into the place for
[1:37:03] Rapture if he himself was not here to
[1:37:07] lead us all the
[1:37:10] way that's right he doesn't just birth
[1:37:13] you and I but he guides us the prophet
[1:37:16] would use it like this he trains us with
[1:37:19] nail scarred hands that we might conform
[1:37:24] to His Image in our
[1:37:28] walk yes sir and he's patient with us
[1:37:32] sometimes we I don't know I
[1:37:34] don't Lord yes Lord yeah yeah Lord be
[1:37:37] yes Lord I I know that's true but God
[1:37:39] you know God don't look down and say now
[1:37:42] your heart's not in it and condemn us
[1:37:44] but he just knows it's getting there let
[1:37:47] me just keep making pass after pass over
[1:37:50] their life let me just keep working with
[1:37:52] them you know why because God God
[1:37:55] doesn't condemn you into something he
[1:37:58] doesn't shame you into something but God
[1:38:02] comes down and by his love his love is
[1:38:06] what where you can look and yell there's
[1:38:07] a shame but you're not coming out of
[1:38:09] Shame you're recognizing what's holding
[1:38:12] me back what's laying around me what
[1:38:14] have I allowed what have I permitted and
[1:38:16] yet his love is so much greater to
[1:38:18] reveal that and that he is the
[1:38:22] way Hallelujah that is the faithfulness
[1:38:26] of
[1:38:28] God that's why brother BR could say that
[1:38:31] man himself is not measured by his
[1:38:33] muscles not measured by his stature man
[1:38:37] is a man by
[1:38:41] character that's the reason he said
[1:38:44] Jesus was the greatest man that ever
[1:38:46] lived I say Amen to
[1:38:48] that greatest man that ever lived there
[1:38:51] was nothing could measure to his
[1:38:54] character no beauty that we should
[1:38:56] desire him so Jesus I hope you
[1:38:59] understand I'm not I'm Not Jesus would
[1:39:01] not have been on the cover of GQ
[1:39:04] magazine he would not have been the
[1:39:06] poster in the men
[1:39:08] store there was no Beauty we should
[1:39:11] desire him you know why it was to bring
[1:39:14] what was real true character what a real
[1:39:18] true man
[1:39:20] is a man is more than male with male
[1:39:24] anatomy a man is a man made by the
[1:39:28] spirit of
[1:39:29] God do you realize before there was a
[1:39:33] physical man with the label
[1:39:37] male the Bible says in Genesis 1:26 let
[1:39:41] us make man in our own image and our own
[1:39:47] likeness what was it Spirit
[1:39:50] man that image was lost with the
[1:39:54] fall but God came down in order to
[1:39:59] restore that real image of what a man
[1:40:03] really
[1:40:05] isall so a man is not just one who
[1:40:07] fathers children he's not just one who
[1:40:10] plays te- ball he's not just one who
[1:40:12] goes fishing he's not just one who mows
[1:40:14] the grass all of those things are duties
[1:40:17] and responsibilities but a real man is a
[1:40:21] man whose life has been brought into
[1:40:24] contact with God where he knows who he
[1:40:29] really is and he has become a
[1:40:33] servant to the Living God because that
[1:40:37] character that you and I have received
[1:40:38] an invitation to have our character
[1:40:40] molded too it said who was in the form
[1:40:45] right of God but he thought it not
[1:40:48] robbery to be equal with God took upon
[1:40:51] himself the form
[1:40:54] of a servant always love how brother
[1:40:56] Bram says it in the message total
[1:40:58] Deliverance he says he was a man
[1:41:02] completely in his physical parts he
[1:41:06] could have been a man I find that
[1:41:09] incredible that statement I've always
[1:41:11] but he said he chose to deliver
[1:41:15] himself into the hands of
[1:41:19] God you see he could have lived
[1:41:21] according to other men and how they had
[1:41:23] lived but he chose to deliver himself
[1:41:26] into the hands of God I tell you this
[1:41:28] morning there's no greater thing that
[1:41:30] you or I could ever do than to deliver
[1:41:32] oursel into the hands of God oh brother
[1:41:34] Samuel I I you know I I believe I've
[1:41:36] been born again I believe my my nature
[1:41:38] has been changed there's an amen in my
[1:41:40] heart my desire is to please God then if
[1:41:42] there is there there is a constant
[1:41:44] desire to deliver yourself into the
[1:41:47] hands of God lord I don't want to walk
[1:41:48] by my own thinking I do not want to walk
[1:41:51] by these things I do not even want to
[1:41:53] claim besetting sins as oh I Fall to
[1:41:56] this I Fall to that no I want to
[1:41:58] Proclaim that you are my deliverer Lord
[1:42:00] you are my victory Lord I refuse to walk
[1:42:04] in subjection to this I am victorious in
[1:42:08] Jesus Christ I choose I choose to
[1:42:12] confess my
[1:42:13] wrongs the prophet leads the church in
[1:42:16] that message in delivering ourselves in
[1:42:18] a total Deliverance he said if there's a
[1:42:20] wrong feeling you got against somebody
[1:42:22] if there's ANC confess sins deliver
[1:42:24] yourself into the hands of
[1:42:30] God let me tell you friends you'll never
[1:42:32] find such a liberty as when we will do
[1:42:34] that and apply that but sometimes things
[1:42:37] can get so accumulated in our life and
[1:42:39] you know when things get accumulated in
[1:42:40] our life and it hinders you in your walk
[1:42:42] with God your you let it hinder you your
[1:42:44] prayer life and Satan wants to make you
[1:42:45] feel in a certain way and so you hold
[1:42:47] back from praying and reading and
[1:42:49] getting into the message or maybe coming
[1:42:50] to the house of God because you're
[1:42:52] feeling Satan is putting you right in
[1:42:53] the corner where he wants to be because
[1:42:56] he knows within yourself in me as well
[1:42:58] there is no help within myself but my
[1:43:01] help is in the Lord he is the strength
[1:43:04] and the source of my life I don't care
[1:43:06] if you feel lower than the padding under
[1:43:08] this carpet but you get in God's
[1:43:10] presence and say Lord You're the one
[1:43:12] that's able to raise me up you're the
[1:43:14] one that's able to break the Gloom and
[1:43:16] the doubt you are my way maker Lord
[1:43:18] you're the one who opens prison doors
[1:43:20] opens up blind eyes Lord You're the same
[1:43:23] God that changes heart you're the same
[1:43:25] God that brings Deliverance I am going
[1:43:27] to present myself before
[1:43:33] you my my my his
[1:43:37] character greatest man that ever lived
[1:43:40] because a man could be ever such out
[1:43:43] here but not be an ounce of man in
[1:43:46] it I want you to understand there's some
[1:43:48] there's some real men there's men that
[1:43:51] when I say men real men they're
[1:43:53] fathers and other things like that but I
[1:43:56] want to just say that what God has
[1:43:58] intended for each of us to be is that we
[1:44:01] would bear the
[1:44:03] characteristics of
[1:44:05] God that's God's desire of what a real
[1:44:09] man is it the world doesn't Define
[1:44:11] that sometimes you know the world it you
[1:44:14] know before it was just they had such a
[1:44:16] a Persona of the way things were but yet
[1:44:18] it was still them looking at things
[1:44:20] remember brother Bram said even before
[1:44:21] he said of a husband he said husband's
[1:44:23] not a dictator to treat his wife like a
[1:44:25] doormat but neither is she to be one
[1:44:28] that's ruling over him see all of that
[1:44:31] is kept in its balance you might say
[1:44:32] well how do I bring that in its balance
[1:44:34] you first of all as the man have to be
[1:44:37] in contact with God and submitting
[1:44:40] yourself to God because it will have to
[1:44:42] be God that will be displayed through
[1:44:44] your position that'll bring your wife
[1:44:45] into position or even vice versa you say
[1:44:48] give me an example on that well I can
[1:44:50] take every example down through
[1:44:51] scriptures with men of God but but let's
[1:44:53] just talk about this hour that we're
[1:44:54] living in God sent a word through a
[1:44:57] messenger who came into his position and
[1:45:00] Authority look at the effect of that
[1:45:03] word and where it's brought you and I oh
[1:45:06] that's so good it's a word that's laid
[1:45:08] here the whole time remember the opening
[1:45:11] of The Seven Seals it wasn't something
[1:45:13] added it's on the back side of the book
[1:45:15] meaning an end time
[1:45:17] Revelation but when the seals are taken
[1:45:20] off then the nature of Christ is fully
[1:45:23] revealed to the Church of the Living God
[1:45:26] it has taken that in order to bring the
[1:45:29] church into position to what you and I
[1:45:32] ought to be it wasn't
[1:45:34] theology brother ramam said in Rising of
[1:45:36] the sun he sent that little Eagle in the
[1:45:38] barnyard he wasn't a story about an
[1:45:40] eagle that got his attention it was a
[1:45:41] living Eagle that came over
[1:45:45] him and he recognized there's something
[1:45:48] that struck him that's who I am
[1:45:53] this was a great man of
[1:45:55] God brother Brown was what 5'6
[1:46:00] 5'7 wouldn't it been something God could
[1:46:03] have sent a messenger and he would have
[1:46:05] been some strapping guy with barn door
[1:46:08] shoulders so eloquent with his words
[1:46:11] would have had education degree upon
[1:46:13] degrees you know what as powerful as
[1:46:15] this word would have been you or I would
[1:46:17] have looked right at that and thought
[1:46:18] Lord our humanness our humanness just
[1:46:23] like it does even among right here in
[1:46:24] the body where you look oh my if if I
[1:46:27] could just be like so and so if I you
[1:46:29] don't know what so and so's going
[1:46:31] through you don't know what so and so's
[1:46:33] been through you don't know the mistakes
[1:46:35] and the failures and the trials and the
[1:46:37] tests that has come in order to bring
[1:46:39] them where they are but all of those
[1:46:41] things to a child of God works together
[1:46:44] for the good and what is the good
[1:46:47] there's one good and that is God that
[1:46:49] God might be fully displayed in a
[1:46:52] greater way in our life that's the good
[1:46:54] that's come out of
[1:46:57] it here God took a man in his
[1:47:05] hand and he showed us not just on the
[1:47:08] platform though we've seen it night
[1:47:10] after
[1:47:12] night that man that had knocked many
[1:47:14] preachers out come up here and you know
[1:47:16] the story he came up here spit in his
[1:47:20] face brother Bram demonstrates it has
[1:47:22] this roll
[1:47:23] down go ahead release your hands around
[1:47:25] some of you probably got F fist clenched
[1:47:27] right now he's rolling down now brother
[1:47:31] Bram said I sized him
[1:47:36] up right I sized him
[1:47:39] up but he
[1:47:41] says there was fear that came he said
[1:47:45] but I chose to think different thoughts
[1:47:49] do you realize what Authority you have
[1:47:53] those examples through the message don't
[1:47:55] just read over them God is showing you
[1:47:58] and I don't think you're defeated
[1:48:00] because of thoughts that are coming in
[1:48:02] your
[1:48:03] mind choose to think different thoughts
[1:48:07] you're a Son of God take dominion over
[1:48:11] this God has made you in his own image
[1:48:13] and likeness you are in control I don't
[1:48:17] care how out of control you feel the
[1:48:19] situation is as long as you can be subm
[1:48:22] it into the hands of God then it invites
[1:48:25] God on the
[1:48:27] scene and God took control of that
[1:48:29] situation because God took it personal
[1:48:32] God took that challenge and brother
[1:48:34] brandham allowed himself to get out of
[1:48:36] the way you know brother brandham would
[1:48:38] have held anything against that man you
[1:48:40] know brother Bram would have held
[1:48:41] anything and said that guy what right
[1:48:44] does he have to come up here and spit on
[1:48:45] me I am a servant of God you know if he
[1:48:48] listen not what he'd said if he'd have
[1:48:50] thought that it have been a different
[1:48:53] story brother samel you say but and then
[1:48:56] all of a sudden when things are said oh
[1:48:57] brother Samuel that makes it so high
[1:48:59] you've got to recognize the power that's
[1:49:01] within you don't saell yourself short
[1:49:05] don't minimize God recognize the god
[1:49:09] that's in you the same God that's in you
[1:49:12] listen I don't care if you've got a
[1:49:13] speck you've got enough in you to whip
[1:49:16] every devil out of
[1:49:18] hell with just one spec you've got
[1:49:21] enough to stand upon God's word word and
[1:49:23] call the promise
[1:49:25] [Applause]
[1:49:27] yours
[1:49:29] Hallelujah it ain't about the quantity
[1:49:31] it's the
[1:49:32] quality if brother brandom would have
[1:49:34] held one
[1:49:36] thing you'd have read a different story
[1:49:38] he'd have been laid out there like the
[1:49:41] rest see that shows the effectiveness
[1:49:43] you see how Satan Satan wants to get you
[1:49:46] and me in that realm I didn't act out in
[1:49:50] the flesh but remember the flesh just
[1:49:52] isn't this it's the spirit as well
[1:49:54] that's right it's your spirit as well
[1:49:57] where you can keep things Harbor things
[1:49:59] and you've got things in file cabinets
[1:50:01] and you keep that's where bitterness
[1:50:03] lays and it'll affect everything else
[1:50:05] you know what bitterness does it chokes
[1:50:07] out it Springs forth then it defiles
[1:50:10] many wow my my I'm talking about a real
[1:50:14] man right I'm talking about real women
[1:50:17] it isn't something that we look at my
[1:50:20] brother BR was you know my prove your
[1:50:21] manhood brother r go ahead you know and
[1:50:23] size him up it was showing us what a
[1:50:27] real man is is one who was under the
[1:50:30] control of the Holy Ghost AM for the
[1:50:34] sons of God are
[1:50:36] led by the spirit of God and he didn't
[1:50:39] just show that on the
[1:50:42] platform it happened in his
[1:50:44] home where the enemy was stirring up
[1:50:48] trouble in the
[1:50:50] home and here he came the the same God
[1:50:54] on the platform was the same God at
[1:50:57] home might have looked a little
[1:50:59] different didn't have a suit and tie but
[1:51:01] had an apron
[1:51:02] on honey can I borrow an
[1:51:05] apron all I got some one with flowers
[1:51:08] that'll
[1:51:08] [Laughter]
[1:51:10] do doesn't matter what it is God came on
[1:51:14] the scene and the enemy was cast out of
[1:51:17] the home through prayer
[1:51:23] a real man is a man that has contact
[1:51:26] with
[1:51:27] God and can be led by God Amen that's
[1:51:32] what God came to restore that's why when
[1:51:34] the Holy Ghost has come let me just tie
[1:51:37] this up this part of it when the Holy
[1:51:39] Ghost has come the Seal of the Living
[1:51:42] God you become an ins
[1:51:45] sign an example and the prophet says it
[1:51:49] like this you become an example of
[1:51:53] Christianity manhood and Womanhood why
[1:51:58] because he breaks the
[1:52:01] confusion can I have just a few more
[1:52:03] minutes maybe two three you say Brother
[1:52:06] Sam I was raised my daddy was a man's
[1:52:08] man my you know my my my mama boy she
[1:52:11] was a good mom he comes to break every
[1:52:16] confusion and there are good things that
[1:52:19] we have seen listen friends there's
[1:52:21] things that no doubt that there are
[1:52:22] things that you can look and if you look
[1:52:24] hard enough I don't care you can go
[1:52:26] through it oh my dad was this my dad
[1:52:28] listen don't just look at all the
[1:52:29] negative because there's no doubt some
[1:52:31] positive things that you can take from
[1:52:32] too abolutely you see what I'm saying
[1:52:35] that we are people of Truth are you
[1:52:38] hearing me we're people of Truth where
[1:52:39] we don't just throw throw it all out we
[1:52:42] look for truth that's right I'm saying
[1:52:44] I'm here for truth this is a time of
[1:52:46] assembling truth right maybe maybe the
[1:52:50] only thing you can think of right now he
[1:52:51] was a hard worker he believed going to
[1:52:52] work he believed in being faithful he
[1:52:54] believe hey that that's a great quality
[1:52:57] in this age in this day and age in this
[1:53:00] day and age Ah that's a great
[1:53:03] quality right maybe your dad had to work
[1:53:06] his way up from pushing the brooms to
[1:53:08] eventually he was a foreman H in this
[1:53:11] day and age they want to start as the
[1:53:16] CEO I mean after all I've went to
[1:53:18] college book smarts don't mean
[1:53:20] anything if you can't draw out of deep
[1:53:23] Waters understanding and know how to un
[1:53:26] to KN it and all you become is somebody
[1:53:28] that's filled with a lot of knowledge
[1:53:30] with no application I don't listen to me
[1:53:32] I don't want the smartest doctor or the
[1:53:34] smartest surgeon I want one who is
[1:53:37] surrendered and his humble and is simple
[1:53:40] I'm not interested in anybody oh they
[1:53:42] made the greatest marks I'm interested
[1:53:43] in somebody that can do the job
[1:53:47] right see you say what are you saying
[1:53:49] brother Samuel I've known a lot of
[1:53:50] people that's been valid dictorian that
[1:53:52] ended up as
[1:53:54] nothing that's nothing to shy away from
[1:53:56] getting good grades but I went to school
[1:53:58] with many of them in Somey they went to
[1:54:00] college one year and dropped out you
[1:54:03] know why they were used to everything
[1:54:04] coming
[1:54:05] easy one thing that helped me from a
[1:54:08] from a teacher that I had and it gave me
[1:54:09] courage because I I looked at myself I
[1:54:11] thought dear God I'll never be able to
[1:54:12] go to
[1:54:13] college I'm doing all I can right now
[1:54:15] the one thing he told me he said he
[1:54:17] didn't tell me he was saying to the
[1:54:18] whole class to me I took it it I took it
[1:54:20] and ran with it he said with college you
[1:54:22] don't need to be smart you just need to
[1:54:23] have common sense and you need to have
[1:54:25] drive to study I took that and ran with
[1:54:28] it I thought well I can do that I can do
[1:54:31] that but you know what it took even more
[1:54:33] than that it took the
[1:54:35] Lord I say it took the
[1:54:37] Lord I hope that's all right but real
[1:54:40] real Christianity it brings us to that
[1:54:42] place of real manhood real
[1:54:45] Womanhood so I just want to I want to
[1:54:48] end it with this this part of it just to
[1:54:49] give you this thought and the Lord
[1:54:50] willing we'll pick it up I want to just
[1:54:52] say it in this way in order to kind of
[1:54:54] give you something to kind of think
[1:54:56] about great men are not born Great Men
[1:55:01] that's
[1:55:03] right they
[1:55:06] become great
[1:55:09] Men by the
[1:55:12] promise that they hold in their heart
[1:55:15] right brother Brandon made a
[1:55:17] statement and I'm leaving you with this
[1:55:20] I really am
[1:55:23] he said
[1:55:24] Abraham was the greatest man on the
[1:55:28] earth now I don't know about you but
[1:55:30] when I read that I'm I looked at it in a
[1:55:33] manner years ago when I read that I
[1:55:36] thought the prophet has said this twice
[1:55:38] in the
[1:55:40] message I know Abraham's mistakes right
[1:55:44] I know his failures I know the outcome
[1:55:47] of what took
[1:55:49] place but the reason he was the greatest
[1:55:51] man on the Earth Earth the prophet said
[1:55:53] it like this was because of the promise
[1:55:56] he was holding
[1:55:58] Hallelujah and he who was the greatest
[1:56:01] man on the earth received a blessing
[1:56:04] from him that was greater he met
[1:56:10] MDC and
[1:56:12] MDC blessed
[1:56:16] him you know what it did it brought
[1:56:19] forth there that promise just became
[1:56:21] more real yes
[1:56:22] that promise moving in his life it
[1:56:25] caused him it led him into further
[1:56:29] decisions in his life that's right yes
[1:56:34] sir you know you can't look at Abraham's
[1:56:37] life and say he did this perfect right
[1:56:39] on the dot God told him to do this he
[1:56:40] did that God told him to do this he did
[1:56:43] that you can't read that God told him to
[1:56:47] leave where he was at in the ear of cdis
[1:56:49] he still had his daddy with him had a
[1:56:52] lot with him what brother brandom call
[1:56:54] it sh every time I read this how about
[1:56:56] gag he said was a hair in the biscuit I
[1:56:58] don't like hairs in my food so I know
[1:57:01] what he's talking about man that that'll
[1:57:02] ruin the whole meal right there take it
[1:57:05] take it take it take
[1:57:07] it take it I don't want to see it no
[1:57:10] more I don't want to see it don't pull
[1:57:11] it out take it so when I read that when
[1:57:14] brother BR said it always brother B said
[1:57:15] he was always a hair in the biscuit I I
[1:57:19] that to me
[1:57:25] it brings it down simple I'm glad God
[1:57:27] gave simple terms for you and I and he
[1:57:30] showed us through Abraham's life that
[1:57:32] you know what God kept working with
[1:57:34] Abraham he was a great man I don't care
[1:57:37] if all he did was make two steps he was
[1:57:39] a great man because God had spoke to him
[1:57:41] and he had a promise and that promise he
[1:57:44] took and God would move on his heart he
[1:57:46] would make more
[1:57:48] steps Abraham how come you're still got
[1:57:50] lot around don't you know what God told
[1:57:52] you to do God knew it was going to be
[1:57:55] hard for Abraham brother Braham said
[1:57:57] that was hard to separate from his
[1:58:02] nephew no doubt the thoughts going on
[1:58:04] how's he going to make it how's he going
[1:58:05] to do it how's he brother but God
[1:58:07] allowed something to take place in order
[1:58:11] to do what bring the
[1:58:14] separation let me tell you something if
[1:58:17] you can look at that and see that to
[1:58:20] God's care in our life and as God takes
[1:58:24] and he takes a man that's not born a
[1:58:26] great man but he's working on that man
[1:58:29] he's working on that life he's working
[1:58:31] on your life and my life to bring us to
[1:58:34] the greatness that matches the promise
[1:58:37] that's been made by a great God a
[1:58:40] faithful God and in his greatness came
[1:58:42] down to the lowest that he might give us
[1:58:46] the greatest gift that could ever be
[1:58:48] given the Holy Ghost because through
[1:58:51] theol H ghost it brings you and I from
[1:58:55] the New Birth into
[1:58:58] manhood so I want to leave you with that
[1:59:00] here this morning Lord willing we
[1:59:02] will'll pick that up on this of a great
[1:59:04] man of God but I want to leave you with
[1:59:06] that they're not born great men but they
[1:59:09] become great men right amen you might
[1:59:12] look at you can look at your life right
[1:59:13] now and say I'm not what I want to be
[1:59:16] and I'm not what I ought to
[1:59:18] be but I'm not what I used to be
[1:59:22] Brother Sam what are you going to do I'm
[1:59:23] just going to I'm going to submit myself
[1:59:26] to the glory of the Lord because in his
[1:59:29] presence we are changed from Glory unto
[1:59:33] Glory unto glory and you know how he
[1:59:36] does that he makes you with this glory
[1:59:40] to be prepared to receive the next
[1:59:43] Glory that's good that's what he did
[1:59:45] from day one in creation to day two to
[1:59:48] day three each day is preparation to
[1:59:50] sustain the oncoming Glory justification
[1:59:55] made way for sanctification
[1:59:57] sanctification made way for the baptism
[1:59:59] of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the
[2:00:01] Holy Ghost has made a way for the person
[2:00:04] of Jesus Christ
[2:00:07] himself aren't you thankful oh yes I'm
[2:00:11] thankful greatest man that ever lived
[2:00:13] the Lord Jesus Christ and to than that
[2:00:16] in this hour where it was as in Eden
[2:00:19] there was a man who was made in the
[2:00:21] image of God
[2:00:22] and in that image God made them male and
[2:00:25] female see that's the
[2:00:27] completeness yeah within that man was
[2:00:30] hidden his
[2:00:32] bride but now in Satan's
[2:00:36] Eden in Satan's Eden here is a woman on
[2:00:39] earth here is the bride and in her heart
[2:00:42] is the hidden man of the heart in her
[2:00:45] heart in her life he is the center of my
[2:00:48] life he's my heart so hidden inside of
[2:00:52] the Bride is the groom oh my what a
[2:00:56] mystery what a
[2:00:58] mystery amen oh my footprints on the
[2:01:02] sands of time men that have went before
[2:01:04] us Great Men of God let me just say this
[2:01:08] I don't have to look outside of this
[2:01:09] room to see Great Men of God to see
[2:01:13] great women of God look we could take a
[2:01:15] whole thing on the women of God Ruth
[2:01:17] Esther maybe God allow us to do
[2:01:19] that beautiful wonderful
[2:01:23] careful I say God I want to be all that
[2:01:26] you've ordained for me to
[2:01:30] be when brother Brown would use that
[2:01:32] word real let's go ahead and stand to
[2:01:34] our feet when he used that word real I
[2:01:36] look at that carefully how brother Brown
[2:01:37] would say that he would say a real man
[2:01:41] when I say I look at that carefully I
[2:01:42] don't want you to think oh oh that's
[2:01:44] brother Samuel's int it's not my
[2:01:45] intuition we're drawn to things by the
[2:01:48] spirit of God God picks things up to us
[2:01:50] just like in the scripture you know
[2:01:52] sometimes you're listening to a message
[2:01:53] or you're reading a scripture and all of
[2:01:54] a sudden something just picks up to you
[2:01:56] like oh this word when brother Bram
[2:01:59] talks about brother Williams he said oh
[2:02:02] he said he served a purpose in life he
[2:02:03] was a real father oh he said he was a
[2:02:08] real husband he said but the main
[2:02:11] purpose is that he was gerti by the holy
[2:02:16] ghost that word real
[2:02:20] friends the world wants to put that real
[2:02:23] and all of these things reality there's
[2:02:25] nothing reality about that there's no
[2:02:28] reality the only real reality there is
[2:02:32] is in
[2:02:34] Christ that's that's the only reality
[2:02:36] there is that's what's real that's
[2:02:39] what's
[2:02:40] true and that's that's what God's desire
[2:02:43] is for each and every one of us is that
[2:02:46] we're real
[2:02:48] Believers real Christians
[2:02:51] and you can't I can't make myself that
[2:02:55] that's not that God hasn't left that
[2:02:56] into our
[2:02:59] hands but he's given us his
[2:03:02] word if we can take his word and say be
[2:03:05] it unto me Lord according to your word
[2:03:08] and let the word just transform your
[2:03:11] life let the word brother brand says ask
[2:03:15] God to put word on top of word in your
[2:03:17] life until you're there in Christ and
[2:03:21] then as you're in Christ then God keep
[2:03:23] adding Lord to my life Lord let me
[2:03:27] decrease that he might
[2:03:31] increase God give me Grace I listen
[2:03:33] friends I got my hands up God give me
[2:03:34] Grace To Die to myself Lord give me
[2:03:38] Grace To Die to myself the Bible said he
[2:03:41] was led to the slaughter as a sheep is
[2:03:44] dumb before her
[2:03:48] shearers Lord I want to be more like you
[2:03:51] yes I want Lord to become I don't want
[2:03:53] to become a great man in terms of my
[2:03:56] name is known and oh this man no I Great
[2:03:59] Men I think that's been established is
[2:04:01] to have the character of
[2:04:03] Christ I told my boys we were talking
[2:04:06] there the other night in Fellowship in
[2:04:07] the living room I said I want to tell
[2:04:08] you something I'm not interested my goal
[2:04:12] is not to be right it's to be
[2:04:16] correct cuz if that's right that's
[2:04:18] that's Pride I want to be correct
[2:04:19] meaning that if there's something out of
[2:04:21] line I want to be corrected cuz I want
[2:04:24] to be correct I want to be correct we
[2:04:28] just having a little bit of Fellowship I
[2:04:29] I believe that's the part that God calls
[2:04:31] us to that's a part of maturity listen
[2:04:33] friends maturity and coming into this as
[2:04:36] adopted Sons and Daughters of God as we
[2:04:38] grow into this and the spirit of God
[2:04:40] making out of you and I Great
[2:04:42] Men great women if I could say
[2:04:45] it great people of God and you know
[2:04:49] what's great is because of the promise
[2:04:51] promise that we hold in this hour you
[2:04:54] know what's causing you to make the
[2:04:56] decision you're making is because the
[2:04:59] promise that you've
[2:05:01] received brother BR said that's the
[2:05:03] reason that Abraham separated from lot
[2:05:06] was because of the promise he was
[2:05:08] holding not because he thought he was
[2:05:10] better than lot he had a promise that
[2:05:13] was calling in his heart for a deeper
[2:05:17] separation and that's what takes real
[2:05:20] men it takes makes real men to be able
[2:05:23] to stand there and say well Brother Sam
[2:05:25] I've got it all together that's not what
[2:05:27] God showed
[2:05:29] us the greatest man that ever
[2:05:33] lived in the closing moments of his
[2:05:37] life he GED himself yes he did and he
[2:05:40] got down he took the lowest
[2:05:45] position upon the earth a footwash
[2:05:49] flunky
[2:05:52] and he washed their
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:59] feet Hallelujah let me tell you
[2:06:02] friends I believe in signs and miracles
[2:06:05] if we ever need there's Miracles there's
[2:06:07] there's there's heal there's things that
[2:06:08] we have need of we're never beyond that
[2:06:11] but let me tell you something don't ever
[2:06:14] minimize what God doing in your life and
[2:06:17] bringing you into surrender in your life
[2:06:20] and your character being molded don't
[2:06:22] ever minimize it that's the greatest
[2:06:24] Miracle because you can be sick and
[2:06:28] you'll be healed thank God for that I
[2:06:29] love to be well but you know what one
[2:06:32] day this body of God carries this body
[2:06:35] is going to have to be changed it'll go
[2:06:37] by the way of the great but that
[2:06:38] character that's what you take with you
[2:06:41] that's what you take with you and so
[2:06:43] when you stand there we stand there on
[2:06:45] the other side we're going to stand
[2:06:47] there as Miracles not only miracles now
[2:06:51] that God brought us out of the world and
[2:06:53] changed our life but we are going to
[2:06:55] stand there as miracles in the midst of
[2:06:58] Satan's Eden God has brought a people
[2:07:01] into complete
[2:07:03] submission in their
[2:07:06] character don't ever let the enemy
[2:07:08] minimize that in your life that is a son
[2:07:11] and daughter of
[2:07:14] God hallelujah who will be greatest
[2:07:17] Among Us will I be the one will I who's
[2:07:19] going to be Chief Among Us and Jesus
[2:07:22] said usually those that are chief are
[2:07:24] sitting at the table to be served he
[2:07:27] said and I am among you as one that is
[2:07:32] serving he showed us what a real man is
[2:07:36] a real woman showed us what real
[2:07:37] Christianity is it's not
[2:07:40] about me how blessed can I be how
[2:07:43] blessed can I
[2:07:45] be it's
[2:07:47] about what can I do for you Lord
[2:07:52] because remember where God called
[2:07:54] Abraham I've always loved this Abraham
[2:07:58] God told Abraham you will be blessed and
[2:08:02] be a
[2:08:04] blessing if all that if all that we look
[2:08:06] for in life is oh how I can be blessed
[2:08:08] if I go here I'll be blessed if I that's
[2:08:11] selfish it's about
[2:08:14] twofold not just to be
[2:08:17] blessed but to be a blessing amen

[2:09:41] done Lord God I know that not only in my

[2:10:54] Lord we need you
[2:10:58] father Lord as your Prophet told us this
[2:11:01] regarding Abraham what made him the
[2:11:03] greatest man upon the Earth at that time
[2:11:06] was not because he was a man without
[2:11:08] flaws and mistakes and
[2:11:11] failures it was because of the promise
[2:11:15] that he was holding in his life it was
[2:11:18] the
[2:11:18] promise that made him a great man
[2:11:22] not as the world as the prophet would
[2:11:25] recite to us over and over from how Paul
[2:11:27] would write to the Corinthians what the
[2:11:29] world calls great you call
[2:11:34] foolish and what the world calls foolish
[2:11:37] you call
[2:11:39] great so
[2:11:41] Lord You're the
[2:11:44] example it's what you call
[2:11:47] great we want to
