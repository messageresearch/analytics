the song service there and just good to see each and every one of you and we certainly are here under in somewhat different circumstances but I'm glad that we're in the presence of one who doesn't change amen no matter what what circumstances take place or what goes on I'm grateful that God is still the same and he's in control amen so we just want to say it's so good see some some more faces here this morning and so good to see each and every one of you and those of you that that are streaming even though we can't see your face may God bless you richly we just want to turn our attention amen to the word of the Lord but before we do let's just look to the Lord in a word of Prayer and ask that he'll just come he knows what our needs are he knows just how to speak to us and I'm counting on him I know you are too that he would come and deliver the word to our hearts father as we just wouldn't come in that and precious name that you have given to us Lord the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ you said ask the Father anything in my name and I'll do it Lord what a reality this is to our hearts Lord we we are standing here this morning whether we're here those that are streaming there are needs Lord that are among us Lord we need more than just just a word we need a word from you Lord we need you to come and to speak to our hearts Lord you're the one that we're looking to this morning no matter what the need is no matter what the situation may right now God it just be set in our hearts Lord speak to my heart let my eyes be open to see you know father I ask that God that you'll draw near you said if we were drawn on to you you would draw man to us Lord as your profit would take that scripture over and over again he would deal with it Lord how it begins even with our thoughts to where that even in our thinking to cast aside any thought any negative thoughts any thumb that would arise against the word any thought that would come to say that I'm not worthy any fault that would come Lord that is indirect contrary to your voice we ask Lord that you would just come Lord in our midst speak to our hearts may you do a work in every life this morning those that are sick in their body God may they receive a touch from you Lord we just ask Lord that you'll minister to every life now help us to get out of the way that you could be the glorified one among us Lord we pray in Jesus name Amen amen [Music] let's turn in our Bibles if you have them to Hebrews chapter 12 and I just want to just to express or to speak some things that God has really put on my heart here you are in the first part of the week and just of where we are even in the setting of the world and the setting of time and knowing the things that we are facing we must face and I just I just feel just such a function of the Holy Spirit just to begin into looking at this here this morning so here in verse 25 Paul writes see that ye refused not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain look at this in verse 28 what a comfort wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God except ibly with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to begin to look out here this morning and I know there's no way that will I'll get through and in any way the thought but I want to begin to look at this thought on stability in the midst of instability stability in unstable times and that's exactly where we are it has already been unstable times because no matter where when man thinks that everything is just right or it's good but yet God shows that just all it takes is one little thing and it can take away something that is thought to be so strong we've we've heard that you know and over the months and things like that of where the economy was at and all these things and I'm not going to get into all the the parts behind that because there's a lot of things that that we could say but I want to deal with it even in the part that you can see that here comes something along to the naked eye it's unable to be seen it's invisible and something like this that can come along in such a measure like this and then to see not just here within our nation but around the world the whole economy of the world and everyone else and really from the things that when I just conversing with some of the brethren from overseas that stood here in this pulpit you know there are things that you know where they certainly are not even tapping in or having some of the things that we would have perhaps available here within the states and things and you find there's a lot of things to go into within that but I want to say that in this manner we recognize that within the time that we're living in that we've got to have a place that we're resting in because I'm going to tell you right up front there's a lot of things that are being spoken and be expressed that people have no grounding of what's being said we know no more today than what we knew in the beginning and that's from the professionals now when we look at this this is where that our our lives and our hearts we we thank God just as you know we're the brand said the doctors they're God's agents thank God for them and we you know yes we we pray that there would be something of a treatment vaccine what-have-you but that's not where our faith is that and I'm just going to say it like this that that that that in itself would be only temporary but there is a real stabilizer that is present because we are we are facing and in unstable times but we do have a sure foundation and so I think of this statement that the Prophet makes here in Christ is revealed in his own words and I want you to listen this this which were familiar with but I want you to listen what he is speaking to us he said now the stabilisers has been put on the ship don't nobody get scared see we're already in unstable times I thought about that the other day dear Lord let nobody sneeze I always have a cough but you see what it's caused your Lord don't let nobody sneeze in a store much less than this church building now I'm not making light of anything what I'm trying to show you is is the realities of these things that are all around us there is a stabilizer present the stabilizers have been put on the ship great fearful ways are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore we're nearing the shore just stay stabled just stay in the word stay with God no matter how you feel oh my no matter how you feel no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word let it stay stable when you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else there talking about but our stabilizer he is right straight in the word God said it would be here he made a promise in Malachi 4 it would be here and that promise as we see its unfolded in the Gospels and even through the Old Testament into the new God promised that it would be here the stabilizer will crest look at this will crest every one of them will go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us what's where he goes you put us in the grave we'll come out again what this is not the real me this is not the real me this is only a possession this is not my inheritance it's my possession I have received the earnest you have received the earnest of our inheritance Joshua has come and divided to us our portion we have representation in the heavenlies you put us in the grave we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down here we'll crest every one of them cuz our great chief captain is calling at the other side now I don't know if you've ever looked at it or thought about what a stabilizer is but I have I got to looking at it included a link here when our notes would go out you know the ships especially theirs they have active and passive stabilizers and the reality is especially when you get into a big ship cargo ship or you know cruise ship and whatever it is when the waves themselves when the waves are coming and they in the you know the higher they get that starts affecting that ship and I want you to think about it the way they placed it in there when you're on one of those cruise ships which I never plan on being on one they just said that you know you want to make sure that your glass of water your glass of pop or whatever they referred to that it's not going off there you know the table that's why you have stabilizers what the stabilizers do they have those that are fixed that's one time it's called passive and it sits underneath the waterline you you can't see these stabilizers above the surface but they're actually beneath the surface of the water and they're actually there they're there to kind of catch and if the wave is coming this way you know that if the ship would go up kind of like this well that is there to kind of balance it out and kind of give a little bit of equilibrium and bring it back into the center of gravity but in these bigger ships and brother this ain't no this ain't a little boat us four no more this is the old ship design and we don't whinny more than just fixed stabilizers we need the active stabilizers and an active stabilizer is one that is actually controlled by a gyroscopic system that's a big word for me even to say but what it means is that there is something on the inside brother Joey that sense is that even the strength or the force of that wave and it's able to move that stabilizer so that it rolls and balances out that way so that the ship remains steady in the midst of that time oh I'm glad that we've got a stabilizer in the old ship aside I'm glad we got a stabilizer in our life it's not a fix but brother it's a living person this is not a good song he said he when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide you stabilize you through every storm we're never promised that we were going to be exempt from storms god never promised us that we would be exempt from sickness as a prophet put it he said we're not immune from these things but he did saved us right here when it comes I'll take it from the midst of you he promised over and over again I'm telling you you could stand right here and preach the atonement of divine healing oh my the scripture after scripture after scripture where God has said spoken that when sickness comes when disease comes the Lord will heal thee come on somebody you say what about if a wave takes somebody that wave in might there might be it seemed to be a sinking or drowning but remember we're believers are not kept from death believers are kept in death yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me I will not fear nor glory be to God this is our this is our refuge this is stability in unstable times I think we can agree and I don't want to dwell so much on this but I think we can agree that even on your phone run your computer or whatever you've got there are headlines that lack they are like drip lines of fear but the stabilizers are put in place to keep this ship from capsizing what's what look here what Jesus said in Luke 21 verse 25 there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars so in the heavens there's going to be signs there are and upon the earth here's the signs on the earth distress of nations that's been going on for years Russia has come right across right not just not just a few little bit but right next to our shoreline with their submarines flying with their planes over our airspace that's been going on these things have been taking place there's a distress among nations a perplexity among nations notice with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring we know he's fine think about over the years how many times we talk they're talking about tsunamis I mean in case you know you know if you haven't caught them let you know maybe one of the latest headlines that they just want to you know it just happens to be let's throw it in here with all the rest of these these headlines right now the weather prophets that's what brother BAM called them meteor mountain meteorologists they never repent for their false reports either come on now you know the weather prophets are saying this year's hurricane season is going to be awful bad now it ain't that weren't ignoring it but my stock isn't in a man's prediction we have been instructed by God when we begin to see these things lift up your heads because your Redemption draweth nigh oh yeah men's heart look at this men's hearts failing them for fear for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken matthew 24:4 and jesus answered and said to them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many their anointed all right but their teaching is not according to the word notice this is coupled as a sign and in this ye shall hear verse 6 hear of wars and rumors of wars What did he say see that ye be not troubled you know that tells me don't be feeding on it don't be digesting it because once you feed on you think on what you think on your talk on and you know all of that comes on that's what you live on I'm talking about stability in unstable times come on now for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences not just one pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places Nevada Utah the one in Nevada that they're saying this week they're saying hey that that that fault line is you know they're they're comparing it to the San Andreas and how much it's overdue I mean these things for years you know you get little messages about the different seismic activity that are taking place because there's there's sites that you can you know that'll let you know the different things that are taking place but you look even the part of it here I can remember even a few years back and even just sometimes we had earthquakes right here I remember one time you know it woke me up laying in my bed it woke me up man either somebody pick on my house up and moving it around or there's ground moving divers places different places understand they're looking they got everything focused in here but things are happening all around why man cannot control it they can try to predict this and predict that and predict that man can't control it let me tell you something all of that is nervous frustrations the earth is in birth pains the earth is groaning and travailing hallelujah what a time that we're living in nation against nation when have you seen it back over the past years we've seen the things this nation and this nation where was left alone now you have somebody goes in they remove this dictator they removed this one they removed that when they removed that one and we're becoming the police of the world you know why we're a puppet Rome has no army of their own come on somebody they have no army of their own the Bible talks about how that they can make miracles how that he speak of blasphemy Essenes make miracles take place that's calling atomic bombs down out of the sky you see these are things that knit not let you know I'm not a conspiracy I'm not a conspiracy that same anointing is the same anointing that's led people away because they start challenging everything how do I know what's right how do I know what how do I know how do I know certainly it keeps on going I'm not a conspirator the reality is this is settled within the scripture we realize the time that we are living in the hour that we're living in but it's not what I want you to understand I want you to understand this right here of what's being spoken in the scripture is by no means calling for you nor should it cause somebody to walk around well it's just gonna get worse it's just going to be bad no our addictions drawing nigh oh brother Samuel who knows you know I may never get married I may never dis and I may never have children and I may never have quit dwelling on all that that you don't even have no control over no man knoweth the day nor the hour well what should I do keep planting potatoes if you knew he was going to come to this morning guess where you'd be right here the rapture is not gathering people down at Cape Canaveral you understand these are thing this is the Enoch was not taken Enoch did not all of a sudden get an e-zpass and now he's on the turnpike home now this is my day I'm no longer taking the backcountry roads I'm gonna take the turnpike he walked the same way every day come on now he had a testimony that he pleased caught he didn't get his e-zpass or his token on a certain time in this all of a sudden take a certain Road he already had it he had been walking with God what are you saying brother say no I'm saying but even while you're cutting the grass you can be taken come on now I mean God has all this stuff in control he has everything in control but look what the scripture says all these are the beginning of Sorrows this is just like it was in the days of Noah it speaks of the condition of the owl we're living and you realize the scripture it tells us it gives in the day in Luke 17 in the days of Noah and in the days of lot it speaks of these two times in the days of lot in the days of Noah why because there was a call to come out of and go into it's Redemption so we're living in the time where the people the spirit of destruction is upon the people people just don't disagree with you anymore they want to destroy you they can't just walk away from truth they want to destroy it you know what they're anointed with the spirit of destruction come on now this is the spirit about the end time that was spoken here you have people that are disobedient look what Paul wrote in the last times it will be true rebels sometimes what's the first thing he talks about everything will be selfie me me me me me mean levers of self levers of pleasure it's all about self where does that inspiration come from it comes from the one who led the rebellion in heaven in the beginning because when God became man it was not all about me he said I had the son of man is not come to be ministered unto but rather to serve he came to minister to our knees so the condition of this world the spirit of destruction is disobedience covenantbreakers forms of godliness heady and high man minded lovers of pleasure more and then than lovers of themselves oh my but at the same time as much as it was in the days of Noah where there were vessels you realize the scripture says the earth was filled with violence through them Satan was getting influenced and there was inspiration coming through vessels but at the same time God's always got the answer there was vessels on earth that was recipients of the righteousness of God there's vessels on earth that just even has these demons have been released in Revelations man when the lid has been taken off a hell but I want you to remember the beginning of Revelations 10 starts with a conjunction and I saw another mighty angel of Hell all the demons have been turned loose against the bride of Jesus Christ and when the bride is gone it'll turn against Israel every nation will be gathered against Israel are you with me Satan is drawing that even right now just as he's drawing the ecclesiastical card of the denominational systems you realize the forming of those systems is the howling of Satan at the revelation taking hold in the bride that ecclesiastical card it's all being set up people are compromising their values I'm talking about church leaders churches are compromising every virtue they've got hmm man we could really preach on this for a little bit I just say it like this we are living in a mess this is unstable times the world is unstable nations are unstable but in the midst of it we have stability the stabilizer has been put on the ship he didn't say brother Carlos that there wasn't going to be waves it said great simple waves would come but takes Peter Claud there are stabilizers on the ship that's evil winds Satan blows his poisonous breath and he wants to try to sink that ship Saints Peter cloth but enjoyed their stabilizers beneath the waterline on the inside that's able to catch it sometimes you and I we're not ever able to catch it we don't see it but the stabilizer is old glory I'm glad it's not up to you and I to keep ourselves stable I'm glad that if we stay in the word there stabilizers there to keep us because after all we're not in a controlled tank we can't spend the rest of our lives in a controlled pink I hope you're with me now we can't spend the rest of our lives in a controlled controlled environment you with me Oh glory but it calls us out the Spirit of God it calls us out of Sodom calls us out of the mess of her religious system into this Ark of safety I want you to notice here this scripture that the Prophet he would read in his text for the rapture familiar Scripture but I'm gonna read it in verse 1 of Psalms 27 the Lord is my light just say it like this personally you say the Lord is my light you were sometimes darkness but now are you light in the Lord we were in darkness it was manifest in our life we were influenced by darkness but light has come and life I don't care if it's just a little you can put this place so dark if you strike a match in here that match that light will press the darkness brother how much greater in this hour we are living in the promise of Isaiah when it said that of the Sun in the moon it shall shine in its seven-pole strength we are living in this hour of strength when the lights of God's Word is shining with such other strength let me tell you something it's greater than your strength and my strength it's greater than your mind and my mind the strength of this light as we're living in this life it's changing us it's bringing forth Christ in our lives even when you don't feel like it even when you can't even see it but the light is bringing forth the Lord is my light the footsteps of the righteous or what ordered of the Lord and my salvation aren't you glad he's my salvation I'm not just talking about past tense I'm talking about how many things he saved me out of come on now oh brother Simon you must be talking about coronavirus knots all my things are even deadlier than that come on now so many things that we don't even know about but yet God has saved us and other times we didn't know about it other times afflictions or things came our way and God saved us he saved us notice what does that build one that's what Paul talks about that that in itself it continues to build and abound our hope whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail you can put that one on your refrigerator when when disease has showed up and said I'm gonna take you come on now this flesh has got to be redeemed but inside of it is a son a daughter of God but the devil can't patch until the purpose has been sure the devil I said food devil when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to consume my flesh they stumbled and fell though our host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should arise against me in this will I be confident what are you going to be comforting in the Lord is my light he's my salvation brother Simon what happens if he don't get me out well no he always gets us out what happens if you don't get through oh no he always brings us through remember though the waves we try to sink or drown can't can't the can will rise right back up are you with me Oh glory be to God but Simon what do you say our lives are in his hands it does not mean that we are foolish or ignorant but neither are we to live in fear one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple this is not just talking about the spiritual body of Jesus Christ notice what he brings it back down to read here in verse 4 think of for deliverance right here in verse 4 we can preach even a further evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the seal of the Living God notice what the desire is the desire is not for the things of the world the desire is I want to be where he is after I want to dwell it is presence I want to behold his beauty I want to enquire inquire means I want to proceed I want to see what is it as the word would shine back in my life what are the areas Lord that I need to pick up what are the areas that need to be smoothed out Lord Jesus I want to dwell in your house if you don't feel that way that's ahead so that's a real big concern verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shahad me in his pavilion you know how that has to be because I wouldn't know how to get into his pavilion I hope you're with me his pavilion couldn't stare me right in the nose right here come on now his prevent we're talking about a person we're talking about a dwelling place come on now when I was growing up with my parents when I was in the car or were there in the house they're playing the message or when I was sent right here in trench you know what it was the pavilion I was bumping into it I didn't realize that's what it was the place of safety that was trying to tell me you're not safe where you're at the condition you're in it's not safe what was it doing it was God's mercy and grace oh but thanks be to God he makes known the way who doesn't he does it in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me oh I'm glad aren't you let me tell you something we are more safe right here I'm talking about what the scripture says we have reached the place of safety we are safe in him we are safe in his word we are safe in his will one brother I won't call his name but here he was he was over there with brother Stephen tabali you know brother Stephens preached right here brother Stephen told the brother the brother had no idea that throughout right there in Uganda in that big meeting they were having had no idea the disease that was amongst the people and brother Stephen told him said when you walk up there to the platform I don't want you shaking nobody's hand I don't want you touching nobody I want you to walk straight there and you deliver what God's put on your heart right he knew better than just to tell him say hey don't touch nobody this or that you see that he just said don't you don't have to do that but brother walked right there and he ministered the word of the Lord you know what happened people were healed situations he didn't even know about a disease plague right among the people they were healed God came right among them and touched them I hope you understand and don't get off line even those of you better streaming I'm not talking about being ignorant I'm talking about that we've got a great big God there's a stabilizer in this ship [Applause] hallelujah in the time of trouble let me tell you this is a time of trouble this is a time of trouble and now shall my head look what he says in verse six and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me notice what this placement does it lifts up the head above it but Ronnie didn't say that it took away it just said my head's been lifted up above it he didn't say that we said oh no there's no enemy out there I'm going to cover my eyes no the enemy's out there but my head's been lifted up above it are you saying that you're above it no no I'm not saying I'm above it but I'm saying in him I am above it Oh brother Samuel what are you saying I'm saying in him is my place of safety oh my we are living in unstable times unstable times therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord notice what it says in the Book of Isaiah verse 32 he said behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and the covert from the tempest there's a there it's things all around us let me just say it let me tell you something there's things that's worse than diseases I'm not making light of these things I'm saying there's things that's worse than that every day you fight head-on with demons every day there's Devils all around let me just tell you something did the diseases are not demons with pretty little bonnets on every day they're all around every day these things are all around us it doesn't mean that we walk in let me just be let me just be very honest with you it does not mean that we would walk in nor would I walk around in to a unit that has all of that of coronavirus if God didn't tell me - it doesn't mean that I'm gonna walk in where there's leprosy if God didn't tell me - that don't mean I'm fearing it but if he says do it I do it you understand me but you see listen this is where it comes down to we've got to look at what we're feeding on the point said right here the Prophet gave exhortation stay in the word stay stable in the world get around somebody long enough and you can tell what they're feeding on I mean just say it to you in case nobody knows the media is manipulators it's nothing but manipulation control you know what it's called propaganda they drop that in times of war they'll drop those leaflets down to try to do what bring fear it's propaganda now listen I don't despise those people you say that what he does I'm not gonna listen to her you want to live in fear go ahead and live in fear I'm not gonna live in fear you understand we have a word to be directed by hey listen you know what there's things and guidance that they had given us or had things that they requested and you know what I don't despise that even of things that you know even that I I can stand and say here right now they know no more about it now than what they did in the beginning their theories have been blown out of the park I don't despise it I thank God that there's more people that didn't die you understand but the thing that what we're looking at you said let's enter what do you say and what I'm trying to say is we can't stay in a building all the rest of our life I got a lot more but we ain't gonna get there this is to help us what God would drop on our heart to help us in this and I can tell you this right now there's things where the Prophet dealt with these cases the anger of the Lord dealt with them right a crunk coming across the platform where people experienced things in their life but they had to be relieved of it in order to continue their normal life a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from The Tempest that's protection as rivers of water in a dry place ho ho so when there's a need when we're thirsty he is also rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land he is our protection brother Brandon gives an example in power transformation of one of the how the chaplain you know was asked by a sergeant to ride out to the battlefield over there in France you're familiar with the story no doubt but they ride out there and you know the chaplain things they said he talked about how he was feeling because when they rode out on this battlefield the sergeant was going out there to survey how many tanks had been lost how many have been blowed up well that had been a real edifying job wouldn't go and count how many tanks have went out of business that have been a real head of fine job with it he had to go out there and survey what had happened the mustard and poisonous gas bill artillery that had come in the midst of this war this war that had come about think about it his brother Graham says how did that Chaplin described it he said there was not a blade of green grass around it was bare it didn't look like brother and it didn't look like it all the luck it looks so much different but he said there was something that spoke to him said go over to that rock and when he went to that rock he said lift up that rock and what he found underneath that rock there was a lily our actual flower that had been preserved under the rock there was an agreement you know a green is life there was in life nowhere else but there was life hidden under the rock there is no other place of life but in Christ Jesus everything else is death all around Satan has shot his mustard gas his poison gas come on mouth he has got great big octillery's now it's called the World Wide Web why to get people cut he shoots it all around Satan shooting his poisonous gas his teaching and everything that comes along with it but in the midst of it all there's a bride there's an overcomer there's a lily that's hidden underneath the rock in the midst of all this and the instability and chaos all around there is a bride Daniel 12 verse one at that timing now this is this was going in dealing with the 144,000 but it's a parallel of revelations five Michael Christ in theophany form angelic form at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of that people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time talking about Israel now and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book I want you to notice what Michael is doing he's standing Stephen how did you seem I looked up and I saw him standing why was he standing homecoming time homecoming town he's standing up you know where that reflection of the stand of the Lamb that is standing in this hour it's reflected in the bride the bride is making her stand its Christ standing in his pride come on now this is the time we're living in and to think just as Michael Christ in angelic form will reveal himself into the 144,000 in the in their hour the holy ghost' classful message that you and i have been partakers up they will receive by but two witnesses of revelations eleven Moses and Elijah and Satan will cause all the world to turn against him they'll turn against him it's in that time in that time of tribulation where men will begin to call for the rocks of the mountains to fall on they will hate that move that's going on see the attention is on the bride right now yet listen though all the world turn against him yet he is with them thinking about us now the angel of the Lord the Covenant one he will stand with them in that hour which one the same one that opened the Red Sea the desire within their life in Isaiah 52 53 he calls out Isaiah 51 awaken or arm of the Lord awaken o strength of the Lord that part of the Red Sea you see it's expressing to us as believers that the angel of the Lord that has come to us in this hour in the form of the word he's manifest himself for a body of dust as he did before the tent door of Abraham and Sarah prior to the change of the body so is that same age of the Lord with this body of believers there's no devil no demon power that can rise and destroy his working there's been some cancers come took them there's been others cancer come God raised him up explain to me in the book of Acts why Peters release and James was beheaded you can't Hey and then you're really you mess up even trying to look for what is it showing it's in the hand of God they knew the enemy was after him come on now they didn't just walk out of their house you know and just walk out to the car or wherever they're going they had to kind of look twice come on now they didn't have a Costco membership and had to wear a mask what they had to look for was is there a sign of a Christian here come on now well you'd be saved under center what do you say I'm saying that all the way down through the ages they were doing with dealing with that in persecution brother branham tells us in the same message they could see their physical enemy they could see it but to think about it they stood and in the midst of that our remember the gospel went on no they were not going by their own works or their own imagination or other well I'm gonna go out and do this no you see what kept them is is because they were yielded to the Lord you know but the Colonel's they didn't go other house will say I'll prove I can come to your house and the Romans don't catch me that would have been the wrong attitude are you with me they actually might have got caught and they might have got some stripes you with me there might have been some things come up because their attitude was wrong in it but if they had a need brother Carlos to go to your house and get some bithday then if they went over there they would look around and you know looking around and seeing where things were act there was a need that's what it comes down to in our lives it's me God directing our lives the same angel the Lord he has one foot upon the land and one on the sea and the prophet of God in this hour would announce it to us and I want you just to stay with me I'm trying to bring a few things together and the prophet of God would announce it to us in this hour I think in 1949 he said the angel of the Lord is on earth tonight getting 144,000 gathering them up he's on earth tonight doing that performing that and that same angel the lord was standing there night after night after night he came with this message Abraham told Eliezer he said I sinned I sent angel the launch that is send his angel with you the angel of the Lord accompanies the message not way out there he's accompanying this message he's accompanied every life not just the ministers every believers life hallelujah he's gathering the Jews back in that same angel the Lord has come to set the church in order for the rapture it came to minister the seal of the Living God to us call us into a place of safety now I want you to think of this here in the scripture in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal that blow scientists mind this is the kingdom of God the Bible goes on to say we walk by faith and not by sight what does that mean this word walk means that our life is regulated conducted by faith if faith is a revelation faith brings what is invisible even though we can't see it when it makes it real to us somebody says explain I can't but I'm settled it's dropped you might be sicker than a dog but it's dropped she said you can't explain it the symptoms and everything else around you might speak contrary but when faith drops it says it says just like brother Branham would after he preaches the message the sixth sense and super since he said Oh God I want more of that faith that's what I want that's what we need in these unstable times that's the only thing that's going to stabilize us is more faith notice the Bible says in Hebrews eleven twenty seven how that Moses himself he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible brother branham goes into this and we were aware the dimension that is around us brother Brown goes in to talk about it of this of this dimension that's around us and he says now maybe you will never see it see such but you believe it anyhow remember brother Branham would stand here and he would say oh he says here they injure the Lord just reveal oh oh yeah I see you kneeling next to a bread uh I bed and that or I see in a doctor's office and this and that and so forth sometimes going clear back into their life sometimes things so simple that was in their life that had been paralyzing them not here physically but inwardly and the angel of the Lord would go right down into that area as a matter of fact brother Anne would stand there he said now you had asked about your prayer he said I'm hearing the words that you prayed in a land called prayer the words were going sometimes you feel like your words are going up and hitting the ceiling and coming right back down on you it's okay I'll be honest for you sometimes you feel like it's coming right back at you but you know what just as he told Daniel when he arrived Daniel from the first day thou did is set thy heart heaven was listening [Laughter] what stability in unstable times Oh glory notice he said but you believe in anyhow how much greater is their reward who has never seen and yet believe but some of us were born for that God places that in the church that's a profit from a baby birth profits are not just put in by man its gift born and he speaks of that let me just say it like this there's been things that even those of you who've had witnesses I have you know things of where they've seen the same lights here even you know through the time that we were in and then even before that and other and other times and seeing that now others might just like brother branham brother Graham talks about he said remember when we were there and that you know in the seven churches and he came down and drew it on the wall and how many of you heard you've heard my and you heard brother browning tell about it over and over he said he went up there when he and mom went and got baptized her brother Neville they just thought bill joy everybody saw it and brother never had time say brother brownie he said not everybody saw that he said brother Brennan talks about it as though everybody saw it not everybody saw it now let me just say it like this we may not be gifted to see into that realm God sent a prophet in the body to make us aware that God is here when man wanted to put him away in a gray God said I was in this hour to let us know he's not away he's right here hallelu he's right in his word he keeps his promise what was that stabilizers being put on the ship let me just say it to you like this the other day it was windy outside right I might say which they wasn't but you and you get you get what I mean it was windy the other day outside my brother Brian I didn't see the wind but I seen the leaves flopping in it I seen brother Joey the stuff I had cut out of my bed if there were leaves or little dried up straws of stuff I seen it blowing around you know what that let me know it was a visible of that wind that was blowing and if you asked me and said which waves that wind blowing let me see how many leaves are go up it's coming from this way so is it with every man that's born of a spirit of God it's the same wind of the Holy Ghost brother as may not see it but you see it in my life you see it reflected in that life that life begins to move in the current of the wind God makes himself visible the rest of the world canikin gumpa right in the nose and they miss it but God makes himself known remember Judas not Iscariot he asked how wilt thou manifest thyself to us and not unto the world how are we gonna see you in the world we'll see you he would reveal himself in his way to be the same yesterday today and forever I'll say blessed are your eyes that see and your ear that here what stabilizers in the midst of this hell [Applause] we've gotta wear come along but the joint that word is calling us home the devil's won the blow is breath but there's a word that's given us courage it's a same God that came down or not caramel and he gave courage to the 7000 when they seemed that living God come on the scene brother they stood up with courage how you gonna face tomorrow courage from the Lord are you gonna face next month carriage from the Lord we're not being ignorant I'm not despising anything I tell you the burden of that God dropped on my heart I couldn't get away from I couldn't get away from her brother Joe he dropped into my heart I couldn't get away from there was completely something else that even yesterday I already had was already moving and just kind of touching some things up and the Spirit of God I couldn't get away from him I told the boys I said I can't go out there on that walk right now there's inspiration that's come ha ha I will have to do it later you know why because I realize that I want you to understand me and please don't read into anything or misunderstand me I realize that even from this moment forward there's no doubt changes and things that have come coming our way and everything else but I realize right now yet we need a god to come on the scene because listen to me there's different ones you you you didn't mean some of you you never took a break from your job and then there's others of you they're calling you back to your job it's going to feel as odd walking in that job the first day as it felt walking in here the first time come on that's just your flesh the reality is this just these parts that are around I'll tell you and what does a Joey if felt odd the first time I went out into the grocery store I won't go in I mean I've seen people I never seen people like that before you know you wondered if you missed the hazmat suit shipment you understand you get to looking at that stuff right there can start affecting you just as faith produces faith fear produces fear that's why God told them in Deuteronomy 20 he said if there's any man you're getting ready to go into battle if you fear or you're faint-hearted go home because that's contagious fear is contagious that's God's Word even after the water has went forth in the opening of Deuteronomy 20 don't be a terrified don't be afraid but yet notice the word said if you're afraid or frightened go back home hallelu but there's a people of God I'm talking to you all across to you not just here but coming right across from that stream there's a people of God that are batting in the ship of Zion brother there are stabilizers that are put on that ship not gonna get my eyes off on no man's word I'll keep my eyes on that saith the Lord yes sure ground the grace of God will never lead you a cannot keep you hallelu [Music] glory be to God in the highest hallelujah let me just try to come down with this I'm on the jump line is that would you call the brother joy when you're over there getting ready to jump on the plane I'm on the jump line it's probably the only time I'm not afraid of heights these are the heights I like [Applause] second King 6 verse 13 and he said now remember here's what's happening there's a prophet in the name in the Land of Israel Elijah had gone on home but Elijah was there now with another message that Elijah was there living out in the commission that was given to Elijah God not a different one oh yeah it's now through a mini member body but it's still the same God on the scene you see what in there it made a last show where God is present and the Syrians couldn't figure out every time we go down this way there they are waiting on us wonder what kind of satellite system they got it was Star Wars before they ever knew about it God already had a GPS system in knew every move of the enemy that's why we got a watchman on the tower the whole ego is there yes what the enemy is doing checkmate devil boo hey man there's a holy ghost on the scene hallelujah glory be to God a watchman on the tower I'm glad about that I'm a witness of it there's some mistakes and decisions I could have made had it not been for the Watchmen brother Brian call it out certain little thing be awarded to me brother Joey why I'm sitting right in the house of God or maybe I'm in prayer or listening to a message or reading there in the scripture the morning and the Spirit of God was just all of a sudden Here I am reading I maybe could have finished that passage or finished how brother branham said it with the fluctuation of voice I maybe could have done that but the Spirit of God would come down how many times does that happen it's like I never heard that before I'm hearing it in a manner that brings down divine application to the situation I'm in what is that stability for him the midst of instability we're sheep we need a shepherd so I was told I'm saying behold he's in Dothan oh my god was just remember villain their every move every time the enemy would go to make this move right here God already knew that move this was a dangerous man brother Joey one man one man I said one man Elijah and look what they did they sent horses chariots and a great host for one man you want to know how afraid the devil is of you he sends a great host after you he ain't afraid of me and he ain't afraid of you per se but it's the one we represent but it just so happens when he touches one of God's children you've got Papua on your hands [Music] hallelujah oh yeah he just right up there watching us we're playing on the metal he's watching oh we're playing around you see that's why we've got a right to be happy why how can you have joy because he's watching over me he's not talking about being careless but neither is it talking about being worried and fearful are you with me it's because he's watching over and if there's the slightest little thing that maybe we can't see because the grass's is so so deeper we're at but he can see he's got the angle on the enemy he can see him coming in and there he lets out one of those bellows the screeches little each let's take a rise he's a wakes up he's an early riser was out he said no doubt looks at mana I guess I need coffee this morning I should have my coffee before I went outside this morning I'm a little dab of heavy cream in there Megan I'm what I'm seeing right now this don't look right come on now you know how it is you say you know what I'm just gonna have my coffee for our face today first but you know what your coffee don't have no miracle work in it to change what's before you I don't care from what star it comes from you don't have the ability to change the problems ahead of you are you with me the haze that goes out there and he looks as a good gracious he sees the Syrian host is all around him he goes and wakes up there lasha Elijah comes out he looks all around washes seasoned well Joe he sees him he's seeing all of it but I want you to watch approach will be Elijah verse 16 fear for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see brotherbrother put it just like this in the message looking through the unseen he said what it was he said it wasn't that he calls it Elijah it wasn't that Elijah seeing those angels there but he said Elijah had already had contact with God and he said what God said in the white was enough for Elijah that Elijah beliefs almost 34-7 the angel of the Lord in campus round about them that fear him and deliver them it alasa wasn't praying for his own eyes he was praying for the servant Silas why because what he was seeing what he was hearing they was shaking him he wasn't able to go about and conduct his business come on now the God look how God steps on the scene then Elijah prays and alasa said God opened his eyes that he can see because once he sees just exactly what you said in your way it'll stabilize him he'll lose sight of the Syrian army may God so open our eyes that we lose sight of the world we lose sight of all their height we'll lose sight of all of their tactics of intimidation we lose sight of that you say brother Samuel are you just telling us to walk out and act like nothing I didn't say that you're misinterpreting it altogether what I'm trying to say is is that there are some people then no doubt from here or wherever it's at then when you work and you've got to go back and do different things you're not gonna be able to call him up and say I ain't coming ain't you coming well because you aren't on and this and that and this and that you know what they'll say here's your pink slip brother Chanyeol that scares me to death you're looking at the wrong my prayer is God let her eyes be opened let her eyes be open here we're not walking around arrogantly ignorantly this virus has already touched our local body and more more than just image you're more than just a few this thing's has already been around we're not making light of this as though that these things are nothing but friends our urge within our hearts it's not about and don't misunderstand me it ain't about getting people here to the church if that's what you're thinking you're you're mistaken the Lord did not lay that on my heart for that but upon my heart because I realize there's our things that we are being bombarded with constantly figures that are not even true figures that are not even true where do we stand for the Vivian where do we stand that where do we rest that do we rest on the news networks or do we rest in the Word of God that doesn't mean that I hadn't read medical reports from different brothers whether joseline different ones would send me different things they're looking at within treatments and I would read through those things just as much as brother Branham would be aware of the Salk vaccine and other things like that because some of those things right there interesting I you never know where I'll get inspiration from it's just interesting but the reality of it is it all comes down to we need stability in the midst of instability because we do not have a promise or a hope when we're going to wait till the phone or we're going to wait till next year or we're going to wake to this or we're going to wait till that we don't have that promise what are you saying to us I'm saying don't stake your faith in that I'm saying Lord let my eyes be open to recognize that the angels of God brother BAM said brother Brian they never move away from their right there as a matter of fact he said in the midst of a meeting when your heart starts being turned towards the things of God you might set as a sinner you might set indifferent but as soon as your heart starts to turn he said here comes the angels of God that'll start to move around that life and they begin to encamped around that life and begin to minister to that life and say raise your hand raise your hand hey y'all go born up for prayer it begins to minister to that life the same angels of God that are encamped around about our life Satan knows they're there he called him a hedge when he talked to God about Joe you got a hedge around him Satan can't cross over that hedge he has to get permission oh let's just stop here I keep saying I'm stopping and I keep going and I keep going you're probably already used to it by now he said don't don't believe already saying but I want you to understand this and I want everyone to understand this don't take this word whether you're here whether you're home whether you will stream it or whether you will archive it whatever don't take this as a word of condemnation you've missed it if that's the way you've taken it one thing it shows is you're not in fellowship with God the way you ought to be because when you're in fellowship with God the way you ought to be there's a lot more grace and things is he meaning a single is he taking is he taking this single is it hey listen I went even when I said and listen to the word sometimes I want to know where where's a man going where's he going but I say this right here the things that we realize in this here if we are waiting as a people for everything to all of a sudden go back to normal I think we're waiting on the wrong the salmon what do you say I say let let him stabilize you and if you're a little fearful I listen this is why brother Brent say when a doctor's report comes or something comes along he said he said why did he give us the Holy Ghost he said why did he give us these promises so that we would have a rest in the time of trouble he said when those things come our way he said fear wants to set in he said it shouldn't shame on us but what does he do he refers this brother Aaron back to the ground that we need to stand on how we gonna face this how we're gonna face next to your next month or next week or whenever how we're gonna face it in him in him no matter what wave comes there is stabilizer sits that's able to catch it aren't you glad it ain't and then dead it didn't like dead roots to thee these aren't fixed stabilizers they're able to move brother I'll say if you're not in him this morning get any let him take you there to that place of safety let's bow our heads father how we just appreciate you this morning Lord your God my heart Lord not just only goes to the congregation here the Lord I look around I look around Lord the different places I've been around in the city sometimes you hear things Lord among people and just seeing them just Lord even sensing it there's a tenseness that's in the air but I pray that you would help us sword I feel sorry Lord for others perhaps Lord how that in this hour you would give us grace to be able Lord to minister to their hearts Lord God that there might be lives that would come to that place of safety in you not just out there but here is well Lord among us as an assembly dollar moon among Lord God the believers around the world through the churches Lord Lord there's many that said Lord throughout they need to get in Lord to a place of safety and not pray father Lord as we know that there are things about it that even as they're reopening and this one's opening this one's not opening this one's doing this and this was doing that all these things why is things in such a way Lord we see this tenseness among the people the Lord we ask that God as our hearts may our eyes be opened Lord if any eyes have got bloomed if become desensitized by things around us to where Lord God it becomes walking more by our reports than walking by the word Lord it's not that we want to be ignorant I think as much as we listen to the message the Prophet was not ignorant he would listen to different things but yet father we were pointed and given a stabilizer in this out we see things that are around us that's true we don't make light of those things Lord Father we know that there are parts of our lives that in some ways Lord for many of your children that are not option they're not optional these are things that they will have to resume places they'll have to go if you tarry they'll be teachers going back to school in the fall there'll be kids going back to school the Lord Jesus you've given us your word or God you help us and you stabilize us we just Lord we want to rest in you not to get focused on tomorrow we want to live and rest in you today Lord I pray if there's one Lord that's outside of the fold outside of the ship I ask God that you would move for them right now God just in the simplicity of their heart that they would Lord Jesus just from their heart to say Lord I want to move to that place of safety that place or God in you Lord Jesus our Lord I'm free from the pressures and the waves of this world I'm free from the influences and the love of this world but Lord God where I receive more god that's stabilization in my life when tests and trials and storms and things come our way there's a rock that were founded on lord help us you're gone throughout the nation throughout the world I think the Lord God on many of the pastors or even your God just different ones Lord that I've spoke to Lord nor them asking certain questions and looking at things Lord God I pray that Lord you'll help each and every one help every congregation help your children Lord God help the believers the Lord even as they would head back into the work place some Lord have already headed back others will be going back this week Lord others Lord God in the next week and on and on and on or Jesus help us your prophet said it like this he said when a man has ever come in contact with the unseen with the Living God he said there's something about that man that stabilizes that man when trouble arises when things come around he said to try to drown him there's that which rises within him and causes him to lift his head above it all all that's not a passive that's not a passive stabilizer that's an active stabilizer that's the Holy Ghost moving in our life that would draw our heads to say look up there's more with us than there is against us or Jesus we can walk with a stabilized walk help us lord I pray you know that we are but flesh Lord God here within these bodies things come our way the Lord God we lift our hearts and our eyes we lift our lives to this unstable time Lord you are our stability we love you for Jesus well don't you love you oh my just just so appreciative so thanking for its mercy to our lives oh my what loving kindness aren't you grateful for that to me when I when I looked at this and God just began to drop these things on my heart I thought Lord what mercy what grace you know Billy Brian I thought of it like that that there is something here I am going to move on this pathway and I thought sure's the world here's where we're going and the Holy Spirit says no this is direction right here oh I'm so glad for him I'm
