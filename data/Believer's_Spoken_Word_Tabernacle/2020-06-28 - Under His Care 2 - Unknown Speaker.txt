Lord Jesus I know Lord that we all have needs in our lives [Music] Lord we've come here not just to have our needs met what a warship you you meet every need Lord we just want to continue to worship your Lord as the word just comes in our myths or we want to be drawn by that pulsation to minister to your needs we're living in an age in a world where the church has rejected you world has rejected you then God by your mercy there's hearts there seed that you plant it in this time Oh God how we're thankful Lord that there's a place in our life that the Dove has flown into Lord we love you Lord Jesus we just invite you to come speak to our hearts through your word minister to our needs Lord Lord it has to come by you I ask God as you gave the inspiration and have directed Lord God in the study Lord I'm not tied to my notes I'm tied to you so lord I just want you to have your way help me this so yield myself to you as if it'd be the last time I'd preach Lord let me just get myself that this congregation gives ourselves the Lord may you come in our mid sword may you perform your word you know what's needed Lord you know how to get our attention you know how to speak to us Lord Father I pray may every hold that Satan would have Oh God may it be broken in the name of Jesus Christ may that sweet Liberty of the Holy Spirit just move Lord upon every life have your way now we pray father heal those that are sick those that are here those that are streaming God minister to their needs or do you see this prayer cloth I've got to wear or Lord well I would minister your word Lord I'm asking God that you would accompany that this prayer cloth you know the needs Lord that's present in that life Lord we're asking you because you're the only one that can do it and we believe as believers Lord you said if you ask the Father anything in my name I'll do it I'm asking you O God that you'll bring deliverance to that heart I'm asking you'll set the captive free Oh God I'm asking God for every hole that's upon that life it'll be broken Lord God and that heart Lord will be so completely turned to you O God that it will seek Lord Jesus for that reality of Oh God Granite Lord you're no respecter of distance so we ask these things now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you this morning so good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it we want to turn into Bibles our Bibles this morning to proverbs chapter 18 so appreciated the song service and the warship mr. Bethany and God bless you good to have you here you didn't need any help with that song by the way you did a fine job brother Brian proverbs 18 verse 10 amen the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run us into it and is safe I want to read that scripture again the name of the Lord is a strong tower what is his name it's his word revealed his life the name of the Lord is a strong tower noticed it's a raised position the righteous run into it and is safe glory be to God amen will you read one more place with me in isaiah 32 verse 1 this is behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land how many know that the Lord Jesus is all of that he's provided that for everyone amen a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock and a weary land when I read that it speaks of conditions that are not ideal conditions but we've got a place we've got an escape a place where we can go in the midst of all these conditions wind's blowing winds are blowing people standing here now they're standing over here now they're standing back here enough but you know to a believer when they're in this place the winds come up here the winds will buy us over here the Alice over here bow us over here but you know only thing that wind does is it loosens up it causes the roots to get down a little deeper storms come sure they come dry times come but in him we have refreshing a great Rock noticed the scripture a great rock in a weary land the prophet of God would pick this scripture up and say a weary land he said people talk about America all this is land of joy and happiness he said but if you only seen the judgment that's upon it it's a weary land but I'm glad we've got a great Rock a great rock in a weary land amen god bless you this morning as you're being seated I want to continue to look at that if the Lord will help us on being under his care and I think if there's one great thing as even the songs that were sung here this morning that would come and everything moving into that place we see God's faithfulness of how that he's watched over us the same God that has watched over us is the same God who is watching over us and he will watch over us all the way through this speaks of a hiding place where we're reading from here and the scripture it does not in any way portray that as believers that we would be exempt from conditions coming about as a matter of fact in the book of psalms psalms 27 it speaks that in the time of trouble and that's the very chapter the very chapter you know that brother Branham would take four and preach the message the rapture and he would use that that chapter for a background a setting to get and get a perspective of what the conditions are that are going on this the age that we are living in and the times that we're living in it's a time of trouble and I think it's just continuing everything is just continuing to build up we don't know how much longer that we are to be here but one thing that we do know for sure that God is not going anywhere without us and we recognize that the reason that there are limitations to how far that Satan can encroach right now and that's because of the Holy Spirit in the bride body is present upon this earth the scripture says that he in the book of second Thessalonians he that will let he let us until he be taken out of the way it's the Holy Spirit that working in hearts that are yielded to God that's still keeping this whole thing together as soon as as soon as it's taken up the chaos that we have seen in a minor measure I thought my plagues and everything else in a minor it's a minor measure compared to what it's going to be but no matter what conditions come about this is a promise we have that he's our hiding place he is our strong tower and I want to just look at this this tower and being under his care in Joshua chapter 20 verse 1 the Bible says the Lord's also spake unto Joshua saying speak to the children of Israel saying a point out for you cities of refuge where of I spake unto you by the hand of Moses that the Slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the Avenger of blood so God has appointed to them that they would have cities in their land that would be cities of refuge and when he does flee into one of these cities and shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city and I want you to catch this he cannot just simply walk into that city there is someone to meet him there it says that there shall be the elders of the city will meet him at the gate and he has to declare his calls why is he seeking entry into this city of refuge in other words a complete full confession complete full repentance they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the Avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the Slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not before time and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the Slayer return and come in unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled now I want you to think of this here brother Bram says it like this he says now a man coming to this place of refuge when he comes in there first he must want to come in he must desire to escape the wrath that's pressing to him he's got to want to do it so this is not something where a person is drug into it but rather they are under a pressure and when we look at this it says unwittingly unknowingly it's speaking of a person where let's say as they were maybe out cutting wood with an axe and they're chopping the axe and the axe head flies off or the axe flies whatever and it's mites and it kills a person it was that which when it was done that person could look and say I didn't mean to do that and there is a place provided for them that the Slayer that of the family and those that would seek the blood of this individual there is a place they can go where true judgment can be rendered because outside of that city it only becomes a debate a reasoning well I didn't mean to do this you know I never meant to do that but if they can make it to the City of Refuge and plead their case then there's one that'll meet them at the gate bring them into that city and then when they stand the judgment there before that congregation there's a judge that becomes their attorney and is able to plead their cause there's a high priest who's there and is able to declare though they are guilty it's true this one will slip but we are here to remove the guilt and reveal the true innocence this is why Jesus said in Matthew 11:28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest notice and nothing else outside of a person of Jesus Christ will ever give you rest Alleluia take my yoke look at this take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light hallelujah you know in reality a dispositive for a moment it's harder for a drunk to be a drunk than it is for me to serve God because a drunkard he wants to be free of that liquor but then he'll go and do it on the Thursday night or the Friday night or the senator he goes again doing he's in bondage he's doing something then he doesn't want to do but when a Christian is really a believer has really confessed their sins and they've been set free and those those of that sin death the reality of it is released on that life they are free it's not a chore to live for the Lord it's the greatest privilege the greatest honor that a mortal could have to serve the Lord Jesus the remm says I believe that a man coming to Christ and Christ is our refuge that's the New Testament refuge is Christ now a man coming to this refuge must want to come and he must remember another thing he's got to stay there he can't just run in till the pursuers get by and then go out again he's got to be satisfied not just enough to say I feel a little bit better so many times where it's it stopped is where a person can feel a little better they'll feel how I've been forgiven they feel a little bit of a lift but go until you're completely satisfied where there's no other longing in your life you have found him the pearl of great price you see God's a gentleman he won't encroach on you he comes where he's invited real repentance the presence of God is there to guide that and it welcomes him to move further you just can't run until the pursuers get by and then go out again he's got to be satisfied listen this yep believe if a man with his right mind could see that the net thing that the death was galloping behind him and the devil's hell he's going to and could find a place of refuge and then want to go out again there's something wrong with that man as long as he's in the refuge he's safe if he ever goes out again he's subject to his Slayers let me just say this this is why it's not enough just to come to a church you need to come you need to hear the word but you need to commit your life fully to God God cannot move unless there's genuine repentance you might say I need healing in my body but if there's sin laying that he will not move over that said you've got to fully repent there's got to be full confession in order for the comforter to come so when we say this it's not just enough to be around and I just want to be very intentional it's not just enough to be acquainted with this message you've got to be one with the author himself this message has come to reveal to us the City of Refuge a place that we can go to in the midst of a troublesome time in the midst of a weary land in the midst of a dryness in the midst of a famine there is a place that is revealed to you and I that you can be safe if he ever goes out again he's subject to his layers and in Christ we have a refuge and are secured then we have safety from the wrath of God and the wrath of hell that's coming upon us now I want to look at this confidence before we move a little bit further here this morning you see the scripture says in Hebrews 6:17 God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath who's he declaring thus to the heirs that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which in earth into that within the veil in other words it's just like the little boy who had the string and the kite and the kite was up above the clouds and here he is with the string and the man walks by and says what are you doing he says I'm flying a kite and the man says I don't see a kite he said I don't know he says it's up there he said you just can't see it the clouds are covering it up he said well how do you know it's up there he said because every once in a while I feel a little tug on that line hallelujah we have an anchor brother and there's a God it's not a poopy knee it is a fool from above amen we have been tied back in there was a breach in our life but the Holy Ghost has spanned the bridge and has tied us back in to Jesus Christ hallelujah is the abstract to the title deed we have an anchor I'll share it times out here you know it may seem like Airy emotions a reminder this or that but we got a stabilizer we're connected to the unseen realm hallelujah whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek just think of this here the man running for his life he's running he's there's been a man that's been killed somebody's died this man would come to this place of refuge a strong tower he would come to this place because he knew this is the only place this is the only place I can get to it's the only it's the only choice I have it's not it's not optional this is my only choice and he's coming to this city of refuge do you recognize it requires faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so he's coming to this place now when he stands there then the elder that hid that that receives them into the gate and his confession the man is guilty he's killed somebody else but only in this place with those that are presence can his innocence be revealed don't you recognize that when God takes a hold of a life that can be bound with sin and maybe you do look at sin and sometimes we think just drinking smoking and running around but the greatest sin and the only sin there is is unbelief they meant sin is unbelief and so within that man could come into that place but as soon as as repentance has come he's taken into that city brother he moves into that place of refuge I'm telling you there's a new man a new woman that raises up on the inside that says I don't even know that person who was in the past there's a new creation in Christ Jesus what is it it's that seed churn it was never never you that did it in the first place that's real truth justification that's real innocency and the only one that can raise that kind of an innocence E is the one who gave an innocent life and sit back the holy goes to come down and say I declared you innocent the first nature guilty that's why we've got to be born again hallelujah Romans they want there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death you're here this morning you don't recognize it let me just tell you Johnny crow you've already been set free all you gotta do is look let the word direct you that you have been set free like that old crows trained up he would walk that fence line eventually somebody came and they released that hold upon his leg but he kept on walking the same way he kept walking the same way why he had got used to that bondage come on rich women now he got used to walk in that same way but finally somebody cared enough to come back and let him know you're free you're free you're not chained down any longer and that's what the only goes through the revealed word of the hour it lets you and I know as the lamb is standing in power and authority you are free whoo you're loosed first John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness or confidence in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world you might say brother Samuel he was tempted to sin but he never sinned that's right but when that life has come upon you and it raises you up it declares the innocency of a son and daughter of God and if you do happen to fall short guess what he's there to convict you and lead you right back in are you with me now oh my because as he is you see as he is if we are covered with his blood he's not seeing us when we're under the blood he's not looking at us it's not our righteousness it's his righteousness the Bible said Abel in the book of other Hebrews chapter 11 that Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous it was not able it was the sacrifice that was revealed to him that released to him righteousness in the eyes of God and he had that assurance it's not me that liveth but Christ that liveth in me there's no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love fear can come but you've got authority to cast it out there God's army is commissioned to do just what he did in heaven and that was when Satan raised up against God he cast him out are you with me that's the way that his believers he said in my name they shall cast out evil spirits it's casting out by the word so it's knowing that that word is in you and you are in it and you stand upon that word and cast Satan out but the Branham takes I love this reference here when brother Branham came down with the ameba remember being over there in South Africa you let men set his itinerary you really can't blame you who wants the pressure of setting that it's enough to preach the meetings without trying to set your itinerary but God was moving in a certain area and the men who set the itinerary said we got to move from here to go here and the Holy Spirit speaking to the Prophet it says no no where to stay here pressure came pressure came and with all the men he's another brand new hiring interns - there's you familiar with it he turns to brother Bosworth and he but the bram says they're in the message you too you to see sometimes pressure comes from unexpected places God allows us to be tested now God allowed the Prophet to go ahead he says with that right there go ahead and go he said but you all pay for it it did not listen to me now it did not change his status as a son of God he didn't lose the Holy Ghost come on now he was just gonna get corrected but God now notice this here brother Graham comes and for six months after he comes back you know he's dealing with that amoeba case that parasite that's in his body a long time that's a long time six months to have to deal with something is that right I know sometimes an hour seems like a long time we're talking six months Pacey can't eat hardly can't sleep his brother Ben goes on to tell us this for six months and here in one morning how that the Holy Spirit comes to him and says as brother Branham is thinking in his mind what will my future be what will the outcome of this be you see God didn't let him know what the outcome was gonna be he was having to trust God and hear the Holy Spirit and look comes to him as he walks up and he says as thou was thinking of what would be your future he said yes he said he reached over and grabbed a piece of paper like typewriter paper and he said he stood beside me and he swirled them like that now I know one thing I know is that if you grab a piece of paper and you swirl them either there's multiple pieces of paper or one paper has been shredded whatever it is everything that was there on that paper was getting ready to be dispersed he took that paper here as he stands there the angel the Lord he takes that paper and he throws that paper up in the air and he announces to the Prophet your future is clear what he had a question on his heart what's gonna be the outcome hallelujah God came down and let him know this is what your future is gonna be like your future is clear let me just say to you this morning you've got a clear future ahead of you you've got a clear future the Word of God has come to declare to you and I as sons and daughters of God your future is clear a man when you move be under the blood I don't care what comes your future is clear he said you've been fearing that amoeba condition I said yeah will it ever leave me will it will it bother me anymore he said never no more when God does something he does it well first John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it definitely appear what we shall be but we now look at this we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is this revelation by the Holy Ghost we see you see when you come to this this tower you run into this tower notice the righteous run into it your I would have never called ourselves righteous but remember he saw you afar off he knew us before the foundation of the world what was he speaking about - that seed that lay beneath that darkness that's what he was speaking - he was not going to try to revive our old character or patch up our own nature he says there's one answer one remedy for that and that is that light would come and the light will disperse the darkness it'll cause that seed on the inside to rise up under the warming rays of the som what was dormant now arises and shines is a strong tower it's an elevated place it's no way and you and I could get into these heavenly places on our own there's no way that we could set ourselves on the rock like Moses we didn't know there was a place beside him on the rock he told us where the place was he has taken me in the secret of his tabernacle he has hidden me in his pavilion he have placed me upon a rock we could not get there of our own strength but just coming to the gate all you gotta do is come to the gate I'm the one that meets you at the gate who has a testimony of taken lives that are shattered that are found that look helpeth but he has a testimony he's got a reputation for taking the worst and transforming their lives his reputation is made on lives like that lives that were so rotten the devil said I don't even want to know more Jesus said I'll take them I'll take them no Lord if they come into your city they'll pollute it oh no you don't understand there's a fountain open in the house of David it's a better cleanse I'm able to set it free it's able to reveal who they really are huh glory be to God and because your sons Galatians 4:6 God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more a servant remember servant don't know what his Lord doeth but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ now let's draw on this a little bit I know the scriptures are familiar to you but this is what we're drawing with remember we're in the land we're not exempt from conditions being and being around us but there's got to be a place where you know where you're standing when everything else is shaking all around you you got to know where you're standing when pressure comes up in your life you got to know where you're standing hey man in Romans 8:29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified he sees you this is direct words from the prophet of God he sees you and I as a finished product hallelujah sometimes it's hard to see how far you've come but in that strong tower you're able to look back and say whew I've come somewhere I've come somewhere I was down there in the muck come on somebody I was beneath the muck and the Gulf all the dirt that was packed into me but light has come to raise me up in overcoming power it has raised me up Oh glory be to God God's grace has raised us above the multitudes and thickness of people what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us these aren't just words these are scriptures that win everything's breaking loose all around you you can apply this Scripture seems like family's coming against your bosses coming against your what I'm right here's a scripture if God is for me then who can be against me Enoch spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ you and God asks the question he really want you to answer it he's one less to consider who can't stand before him the devil's more than a match for any of us in the flesh but he's not more than a match for the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] he's not more than a match for God who shall separate us from the love of Christ notice not what who who's behind it shall tribulation shall distress persecution famine nakedness pearl sword see all these conditions all these conditions that are all-around conditions that we are exposed to and what does it do it proves the strength of the love of God ain't Curt in our lives and we are anchored to him as it's written for that sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter but may in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us not survivors more than conquerors for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord I really don't like Heights I know it's not real spiritual but I really don't like Heights but I will get up in a deer stand but I really don't like even though I know it's better to be higher up I really don't like to get on tall ladders but right now I'm on the safest ladder there is this this ladder has got angels ascending and descending it's got angels that will come and prepare cakes for you it's got angels that will come with the tester trial and the testers in that they'll come in minister strength - yeah amen there's angels they're watching over us so I don't mind these Heights this strong tower these heavenly places I don't mind them Jesus said my peace I give to you my peace I give to you where his peace arise from he knew who he was he knew who his father was he knew where he was in the word the word was alive to him see it was not a piece like the world gives the world gives a piece and says you may get a bump in your salary huh your 401k whatever it is Z or P whatever it might go up your retirement or well your this or you know or your insurance rates your insurance rates are gonna drop a hundred dollars and some of you would start shouting and never show don't worry it's only temporary just wait till next year but you see it's a it's a temporary peace but the PC gives its eternal tests and trials can come and situations arise but that peace what he gives it cannot be taken it cannot be taken even in the midst of situations that you and I don't know what's going on we know he's got this in control and you can say recognizing as we look here in this scripture we've come in to that place and the innocence is revealed the real true reality it's a safety where the pressure what is all the condemnation that's upon the life all that condemnation is released in Jesus Christ I'm telling you don't matter what kind of baggage a person is carrying right at the gate where that confession is made from the heart right there that is lifted from that life as they would enter into that city coming into that place of refuge they can let the pressure see what it brings us to that's what brings us to this reality of what the Seventh Seal really is it's a relaxing time it's recognizing and knowing who we are remember faith is based on forgiveness you're in the strong tower and you can look back and say oh how did I get from there to here he brought me here and the same one that brought you this far will take you the rest of the way home so I really don't matter what comes between here and there you're going it doesn't matter what situations arise your destination was already set before the foundation of the world God by grace comes down and reveals to you you come from God and you're going back to God brother when that revelation sets in to the Lord and you see it's not as brother mem says not know certain evidence it's a reality in our life that we know the love of the world has gone where we were we recognize where we were where I am now I did not bring myself here God had brought me here where it's not just a message that my mom and dad believed but this is my message this is my Liberty this is my joy [Applause] it's become personal and we're in this place and look back now shall my head be lifted up no it isn't that pressure has boundary lines remember it's our soul that is sealed pressure as I read to you last week it doesn't know any boundary lines such as this church or not this church but the RAM says when he's preaching brother Rutles it's here he said this church is plagued with it the tabernacle is plagued with it we're all going through we have tests yet trials we have pressures you have on and on so there's an N is no age limit rather men talked about two young girls when they went to school Bolivia says they were going in the first part of college and here the one girl both of them come and they'd given their life to the Lord but one of them she got out there and this the kids the professor they started poking fun you never kissed a boy what you've never see the pressure the pressure was coming as though that that's something and that pressure came upon that young lady until she was in an institution she almost lost well she did basically lose her mind and you remembering that in the in the message where brother Bram says I want you to remember me in prayer I'm going to go pray for that young lady and God who is rich in mercy he came down when that lady couldn't find her way back hallelujah the Holy Spirit had to go out and make contact with her spirit and bring it right back around Christ you see the pressures of this age they are real but don't fear there's one who's greater than every pressure don't fear mama and daddy there's one who's greater don't let that put fear in your heart just recognize you are serving a Living God when this word has come into your life I think of what the Prophet said when he's set there and Hattie Wright's house and the Spirit of God moved down he said it was like a super anointing and it spoke what had taken place with those squirrels he said had he said that's nothing but the truth he said what took place in there where the Spirit of God came down and just charged that place and he said the testimony is that house has never been the same presidents the power of this message the token applied your house can never be the same with Jesus calms it'll never be the same your life is never the same get anointed it never leaves your greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world boo devil I said boo devil the devil is like a roaring lion that's why this pressure is that we see all around us more more mental breakdowns it's a nervous neurotic age it's an age the Prophet said it's unfit for humans to live in I'm glad that my soul has been born from the Netherlands I'm glad there's a token I'm glad there's a visa on the passport it shows I got my immunizations brother William I'm good to go that's why the pressure is being built up I want you to think of this the pressures of this age the pressures is soft easy living I could really preach on this one for a little bit if godly but you know I mean dad CEO of the company why can't I walk out a high school and be the CEO yock yock Akiko Lord you know how it is I mean hey man I could be the boss of this place I don't know how to run it the grass is greener on the other side pressure of a soft care free you see what kind of an egg what kind of an attitudes among the people I don't care I don't care if I offend you I don't care what I say not to your face but on Facebook I don't care I don't care who sees I don't care I don't care he cares do you care that don't care attitude is what was outside of the arc that's a dangerous attitude this is this is what comes take all the brother Brown makes this statement it's a complex age use complex everything's so interconnected everything's so technology-driven oh my goodness it's the along with this the this is the pressures of this age the spirit of this age is people's rights in order to declaring I have a right to be sinful see that's what's coming out I have a right I have a right I have its inspiration from the pits of hell revelations chapter 9 said that there was one who fell not descended fell from heaven he was called a baton and he's a bad man he was called a baton apollyon and he loosened you see he's got followers he loosened that data then that which was battled in the river Euphrates what was it those unclean spirits that never crossed over to the promised land and they're influencing the Bible says when they ascended out of the pit it was a smoke smoke permeates you've been around the campfire come in you boys been in a fire ain't you there were some boys one time that went to a fire but it went about hot dogs and marshmallows they were being tested for their stand they went into that College they went into that job they went you understand they went in there and the Bible says that Nebuchadnezzar called for the mightiest men in the country to bang their hands Satan's mighty men wisdom all of these great things and they were binding up their hands you know was doing it was trying to silence their worship it was trying to clanton their praise you said these guys were in Babylon but their heart wasn't in Babylon rather they had already let off the pressure they might have been in Babylon physically but inside they were back there in Jerusalem and the heat of the furnace seven times hotter and the men who threw him in were consumed the stuff from her Shadrach Meshach and Abednego I know those are Babylonian names I can't remember the other Hebrew names Ananias what are you all gonna do now well weight balance so what are y'all gonna do well I see a three o'clock about time for prayer they were living in victory in the midst of pressure they had a place to let off the pressure when Daniel the pressure came remember Daniel said don't not so hasty don't tell the King not to be so hasty God is God he'll give an answer you might feel like you're in a situation I have an answer I've gotta have an answer I've got to have an answer you're only working against yourself my brother brian says many times he said when you come and you come to a place nowhere I forgot them you come into a place and you say I didn't get a prayer card oh no let me get a prayer card I'm not gonna get there he said see what's happening you're building up pressure you're building up pressure you've been oh I didn't get my seat oh no I just didn't happen well no I got into church later or no I got one I know I said and you're building up pressure when you get to thinking something has got to happen a certain way God don't come to nobodies box he who sits on the circle of the earth who's bigger than all of our problems he don't come to any of our crafted ideas and crafted ways but he said I'm God alone you didn't make me I made you here they are in the furnace now the men that through men are consumed and here they are down there and when they get down there the bands of the world that high and had them tied down the fire released those bands the test or the trial brother Aaron it comes to free pressures come brother Carlos it comes to loose God had an appointment he had an appointment to meet his children right in the midst of the fire oh there are others in heaven a set I'll go down I'll go down Gutzon these are my boys I'm going down to spend a little bit of quality time with my boys it puts the testing trial in a whole nother perspective don't brother Joey it's God saying I want a little bit of quality time with you all the pressure was there pressure was all around but I want you to think about this the fire burned off the band's but it didn't consume their clothes it didn't consume them and when they got out of that test that trial they didn't even smell like smoke what was it brother there was a seal of the Living God they were standing with the word of the Lord and they knew who they were and it preserved them judgment was upon their life but the seal preserved them and he met him there yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me the bread made this statement he said if he took us in knowing we were guilty if he took us in knowing we were guilty he said how much more now that we're in here will he not give us all that we have need of the woman of the Shunammite woman what's her name I don't know Sheena my woman what's the name of the world's air I don't know what it was Erica what's important it's what transpired in their life that's what's important about our lives in a the manger that's who's in it and God good here was this woman uh assuming she had received a son and this son dies from working in the field what God has given God's gonna take away no this is an opportunity pressure oh yeah you talk about pressure but I want you to think about this without me reading it when her husband said why are you saddling up their ass and going up there to the man of God this isn't a new moon or a feast she said I don't have to wait to Sunday to go worship though I don't gotta wait till Thursday night to go worship God she saddles it up and she said here's her testimony to her husband it shall be well it shall be well she prophesy come on she's under a message of life she gets there and it lasts you're Caesars hey does there's there's action of my woman I go I go out his go go ask her if all is well with her household and her husband and her child and go ask her and he goes and he asked her and she says it is well nut shall be any longer it is well her child was still there laying on the prophet's bed brother she knew where to take her children and the revealed word of this hour where Jesus Christ has made himself alive we're the reddest of the houses will not welcome him you have said he can have a place in my house this reveal world can have the uppermost chamber in my house how goes it it is well go take the staff and he said go ahead and lay it on the child he said I don't mean be disrespectful but I ain't going nowhere I ain't going nowhere I ain't going unless you come you know what her confidence her confidence was in the Living God that operated through Elijah's life she had an ear to hear she wasn't hearing Elijah's voice she was hearing God's voice she knew you gotta come to my house and brother Bram said she had got to her absolute she was at rest she was at peace her child's still back there do you recognize what a promise you have as sons and daughters of God when you've come into the place of safety and let off the pressure though you don't have an answer you can say it is well he has freely given us all things if I need healing by His stripes I'm healed if I need strength he is my strength if I need encouragement here's my encouragement when I'm weak that's what I'm strong she had a place to let off the pressure she didn't stop brother Trevor she didn't stop she said I want you to come to my house I want you to come to my house you've been there before I want you to come once again she's asking for God's presence to come what is it this is a secret to letting off the pressure now I just I want to I want to read this because I don't know if I'll get this one correct when you come into this place of refuge when you've really come in here God has taken you fully in remember you're not drug to that place a refugee is the one who brings you in by saying lord I need you I lay down my sinful life sinful habit I'll lay it all at your feet Lord I need you and you come in there I say the same thing as brother branham says right here he said I've never wanted to leave once he's touched my life I don't ever want to me I'm satisfied he's everything the Simon had explained that I can't but he's my everything brother Brahim says I pray daily God don't ever I don't ever want to leave here it's my refuge and pressures mount says well god I'm so happy here let me stay oh he says the pressure gets great and if it does then he is our outlet so we don't have to worry about it if you're all pressured up and you don't know where you're going what's going to happen to you after death you don't know you're going to die sometimes you've got to do it but then the thing to come is to come to Christ a refuge and let off the pressure settle it once and for all no matter what takes place I hope you don't mind me reading Christ is our refuge we can let off the pressure you can quit worrying about well if I die what's gonna happen to me what's gonna happen to my wife what's going to happen to the husband what's gonna happen to the children just come to Christ and let off the pressure he give us all things all things are ours by Christ listen so just let the pressure off the only way you can do it please don't misunderstand me I know that there's things that we have is outlet sometimes brothers at hunt or fish sometimes you just get so twisted up in you you're gonna have some sort of an outlet I don't want to be funny but I also know sometimes four sisters sometimes it can be dangerous but sometimes shopping but my brother's sister listen to me all of those things we see that with Jesus had come aside let's rest right brother Bram talked about going up you know into those things even where brother branham's talking about going on meetings he said look you some get me to go out here to California why don't you bring their young uns and come on and join us he said we're going to tour the camera what gun factory it is and we're gonna go to Disneyland he may change that if he was here to him about that place but you understand I say those things so that you understand not that you don't but to remind us don't make carnal natural things to replace the real outlet that you need when problems arise it's not like Oh Lord we've been under such stress we need to take Sunday and go to Cedar Point dum-dum-dum sorry I don't you're not thinking correctly all we've just been so busy you know God won't understand if we go to the Cleveland zoo God will understand if we go to the Columbus Zoo oh we just feel so released when we've come back from there something's wrong something's wrong with your walk either you've not made it into that place of safety or you've got sidetrack somewhere along the way because he is our joy pressures are going to come but there is a place that's provided by God Six Flags don't provide it Kings Island don't provide it the latest shopping outlets don't provide it you go there you may end up with more pressure you see your reality is pressures all around us well I'm so pressured you know I'm looking at this uh-huh that's that's the problem what you got your eyes on it will affect you your eyes not just these eyes but your mind what you're meditating on because what you meditate on is what you feed on that's why you have to watch what you're feeding on but there's only one place to have as a resource families wonderful you need friends let me just you can't replace that resource of letting off the pressure in him I would say this say God helped me to balance my life I'm gonna preach why I'm here well brother salmon I'm gonna go to shut myself in hiding and I'm gonna go have some time away from the Lord ask God to help you balance out your life so that you're not taking spans here and then like it's almost like binge eating come on now walk balance the stabilizers or on the ship praying at all times come on somebody sometimes you can miss fellowship and fellowship is good preach brother Samuel I will pressure gets built up there's ways to let off pressure hey the world gets together on their first days and Fridays preach with me now the coronavirus ain't stopping them I know just well some people said this guy's a fanatic let me tell you something friends what I'm talking about is is that look how the world themselves is acting that doesn't mean for us to act irresponsible but I'm telling you the world knows they look brother joy at the end of the week man I can't wait to Friday a lot of guys starting on Thursday man I can't wait to Friday can't wait to Saturday and then Sunday comes like oh mom what in the world did I do on Friday and on Saturday here it is they recognize that's their way to let off pressure but we don't have to go out there and get that drink there's a fountain that's open there's a rock in a weary land there are laughter's that are provided for you and I that we can drink from that when there's famine all around us when you feel a little the brittle dry winds of the desert but yet there's a place that you can go to and be saturated in his presence no wonder we have such joy we're doing better Samuel we have yes we're to have joy the joy of the Lord is my strength if you don't do nothing more on this tower that you're in just speak your head behind you and look how far he's brought you he's brought you safe that far and he will take you the rest of the way that ought to give you a comfort then too as you turn around and you face the problems you face the pressures it's like gyrus gyrus was on his way to the house he had already stepped out he was under pressure if you go you're out of here he's already felt that pressure but you know what God allows pressure to force us out pressure forces us out come on now Jarvis would have never moved to his daughter hadn't got sick he too continued to be a secret believer maybe God's allowing situations in your life to force you out hello somebody and along the way here came the news don't even bother the master don't even trouble him no more just let him go on back let him go fly she's dead Cyrus you think the pressure he was under before that came upon him at that moment there's no doubt about it it was a squeeze a pressure came on him at that moment but the one he had heard about he went to him and he was there with him cuz he had invited him to his home and Jesus heard it no she's only sleeping you see sometimes the way we look at a situation the pressure mounts up and Jesus said is asleep it might as well say Amen hey man Lord that's me and everybody else sometimes us us this part that's out here not our soul the part that's out here experiences anxiousness experiences worry experiences pressure the things be to God there's one in the ship when the probably was standing there next to his daughter and Satan came right up next to him and telling him all sorts of things and this and that and this and that and this and that and the Prophet said I was about ready to say if that's how he's going to be he said but there's something that rose up in me the new birth type post no glory of our own your flesh and my spirit our flesh and spirit is not built for this pressure but when that souls been sealed it's not a gun that's been made to be into another type of gun like brother Branham had that gun the Sun gun somebody reboard it but this gun this down on the inside when it's been born again it's got the right start a man has been bored out by the one who really makes it the one who stamps Weatherby on there he's the one who makes it the one who has stepped in the name of the Lord is a mighty strong tower ooh girl repeater God it's pressurized she's just sleeping don't worry I bite in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done and he would say I'm your friend that sticks closer than a brother I'm the one that will perfect what concerns you to finish what I've started pressures they're real we're not exempt from no matter how old you are but let me just say this positive thing at the same time no matter how young you are or how old you are there's a place of refuge where you can come and let off the pressure and it's just the trials come he's there to walk right beside you he's a faithful faithful friend this friend you don't have to put on any show phone you don't have to be something that you're not but if you let him you'll transform your life you'll make out of you what you can't even see in your life that's how great this friend is you love him sometimes in the sickness you know because there's stress is two different types right there's a good strength No gotta get dinner on the table but you know that's gonna be over all right I gotta clean the house right I gotta mow the lawn or you know or I gotta fix this can't put it off another week I've got to stand before a congregation it'll be over with but there's long stress sometimes that long stress is where like the profit with the amoeba case is a question mark at the end not a question on the promise of God for he said by your stripes by His stripes we are made whole the question mark becomes for us because we're looking at below it's gonna be is it gonna be it's gonna be medical route left of a surgery well I had to this Laura are you're gonna swoop down in miracle or what's it gonna be is it gonna be the giving of my life nor what what is that sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof worrying about tomorrow will only take your strength for today Oh what's gonna come what's gonna be what's gonna be you already know his word said I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases I know I'm speaking to different ones of you right now I've never been saying you know many of the places where you have been and we've all been in different places but I can tell you this just sometimes a little bit of suffering brother Carlos that I've been through it may only been a few days it seems like years you can call me a baby you can say whatever you want to say but sometimes when we're praying and it don't seem like we're getting any answers Jesus your friend Lazarus at the point of death come quickly rapido and what does Jesus do Terri's oh what's that mean pressures building of course Martha she has a way to try to do with that pressure she cumbers herself she cumbered with many things nothing wrong we have in a clean house but Jesus told her there's there's a balance but when Mary heard Jesus has come and the master the master he's calling for you where the Williams she dropped where she was at and went out to medium pressure was all around her think about the pressure not only was their brother dead he was sleeping they said dead but they had all the rest of the people around him uh-huh where's your church family at now mm-hmm where's your pastor at now was last time he texts you called you wait I didn't mean email you didn't even comment on your post it was pressure and God will allow that pressure but there's a release when she got to him Master if you had been here my brother wouldn't have died she had confidence in the working of God in that ministry but what Jesus was going to make her aware of is that there is no condition oh god there's no situation that's beyond redemption no situation pressure was on the brem says Jesus put a little bit more pressure on her and said I am the resurrection and the life and she accepted it she went to her knees she said I know my brother shall rise in the resurrection he said I am the resurrection and life she says and I know even now whatsoever thou asketh God he will give it to you and do you realize when you pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's Jesus praying through you even now whatsoever thou asketh the Father in my name there's no doubt about it there's needs there are great it might be different for every one of us we might look at that need different well when it comes to your home it's different when it comes down to your address you take a need where you could look at some and say you'll be all right God's in control but when it comes to your address then you get desperate and say God but those are those times that God steps in when nothing else will do there's nothing that flesh can resolve you've come to the end of your way you've done all you can do but this is where God steps in when the pressure gets so great that you think you're about ready to crack that's when he steps in you've got a place that you can let off the pressure you have promises that are available to you as believers there's no situation no situation beyond redemption if God's dealing with your you might say brother Samuel you don't know what so-and-so said you don't even know what what they have said against against what I believe where the brand tells us on the message paradox he said you want to see a paradox he said you see a man come into a meeting that would criticize the working of the Holy Ghost immediately what do we think that's blasphemy right but God knows and if God puts the burden on your heart then you pray you intercede like Abraham interceded for a lot brother Brent says is a miracle well God will come down and take a hold of a life like that he sent and that man who'd been a critic and criticizing the working of the Holy Spirit God will come down and change that man's life he said in the next night you'll be sitting in as a believer who does that God does that he specializes in taking situations that it seems like it's too far gone but God steps in we've got a place to let off the pressure let's bow our heads I know I've taken along longer time libertine I want to ask you this morning because I know not only here but on the Internet as well as you reflect into your life I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to pass this service for what God has laid on my heart here and so pressed on my heart throughout these days I wouldn't want to go away from here not knowing there's not been an opportunity been given that if there's one here this morning that you haven't come into that place of refuge that's safety that you might say but at Samuel I come to this church that's not what I'm talking about you said a man shall be as a covert as a shelter as a great where Allah is talking about the person of Jesus crying I'm gonna ask you is there one you would think deeply Lord I want to come fully into that place god bless your hand young man god bless your hand sister god bless your hands hallelujah maybe there's habits about your life just seem like you just can't but Sammy I just can't those things just keeps tying me down why don't you come fully into the refuge why don't you just lay them down lately I'm right there before the elders at the gate say Lord I'll lay it down at your feet god bless you oh I sit with all my
