[39:28] and so he wasn't even
[39:31] out of the airport in cleveland when he

[39:35] so we just want to remember them in
[39:38] prayer
[39:39] brother danny when i spoke with him he
[39:41] just had asked that we would just
[39:43] remember them in prayer during this time
[39:45] all the arrangements everything that has
[39:47] to be done but
[39:48] it's not just that that's that's their

[39:54] something that we
[39:55] just want to remember them in prayer i

[39:58] what brother danny had told me uh over
[40:00] the course of time like

[40:10] and you know i know that she
[40:14] had talked about she wanted to go on
[40:16] home to be with the lord and
[40:18] you know so certainly she's went on to
[40:21] her reward
[40:23] and we want to pray that god will just
[40:25] comfort
[40:26] the family in this time in this hour
[40:28] aren't you glad that
[40:30] he's a friend that sticks closer than a

[43:35] would walk out of here lord
[43:38] unmet this morning lord i'm certain oh
[43:41] god that you're here lord
[43:43] and for the lord you said where two or
[43:44] three are gathered in my name
[43:46] i'll be in their midst also lord we just
[43:49] invite you now lord that you'll just
[43:52] take control o god lord of
[43:55] every spirit of every situation or god
[43:59] of every life we pray in the name of
[44:02] jesus christ
[44:03] amen amen ephesians chapter 2
[44:09] verse 1.
[44:14] now what we're getting ready to read
[44:15] here we read from this on thursday night
[44:19] and most of you would be familiar with
[44:22] what a eulogy is
[44:24] we're getting ready to read a eulogy
[44:28] now as we know
[44:31] a eulogy is what is given at a funeral
[44:33] myself personally i've had to read a lot
[44:35] of them
[44:36] i don't like reading them because a lot
[44:38] of times i can't pronounce
[44:39] names and so i have to ask and i get all
[44:41] nervous and i try to phonetically write
[44:43] it out
[44:44] i'm giving you a little behind the
[44:45] scenes because sometimes i can't
[44:47] pronounce all those
[44:48] names now that doesn't mean i won't read
[44:50] the eulogy for your loved one
[44:52] but what i'm saying is as you understand
[44:55] that eulogy
[44:56] it talks about a person who was here
[44:59] but now they're no longer here they've
[45:02] they've moved on
[45:04] and we come there and as believers we
[45:06] realize that when we come to that
[45:08] of a funeral what we're going to bury is
[45:11] not that person
[45:12] we're going to bury the shell the house
[45:17] that that person that character
[45:20] lived in and so there's a eulogy you
[45:24] don't read a eulogy
[45:26] of a living person right i know
[45:29] sometimes people write their eulogy when
[45:31] they're still alive
[45:32] not me not me
[45:37] but we don't read the eulogy of a living
[45:39] person it's when
[45:40] someone has passed on
[45:44] so here's a eulogy written by the spirit
[45:47] of god
[45:48] of our lives and you hath he
[45:52] quickened made alive who were
[45:55] dead in trespasses and sins so i want
[45:58] you to see
[45:59] there was a part of you that
[46:02] was alive and there was a part that was
[46:05] dead
[46:08] the part that was alive needed to die
[46:11] the part that was dead needed to be
[46:13] raised
[46:16] where in time past ye walked according
[46:19] to the course of this world
[46:21] according to the prince of the power of
[46:23] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[46:25] the children
[46:26] of disobedience among whom also we
[46:29] all had our conversation in times past
[46:33] in the lust of our flesh
[46:35] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[46:37] of the mind
[46:38] and were by nature the children of wrath
[46:42] even as others now remember why why was
[46:45] it regarded as the children of wrath
[46:46] because
[46:48] we were under that first birth
[46:51] doesn't matter how good we were
[46:56] we can meet a lot of good people but
[46:58] remember a good person
[47:00] is not salvation if we if if people
[47:04] if if all god required was goodness he
[47:07] would have never rejected king
[47:09] he would have never rejected esau
[47:11] because esau was a much
[47:13] better man than jacob
[47:16] but when the holy ghost came hallelujah
[47:19] now we're talking a different story
[47:22] we're talking a man who now is living by
[47:24] the power of god now thou has power with
[47:26] god
[47:27] is that right so there has to be one to
[47:30] come and lift us from the
[47:32] judgment the condemnation of that first
[47:34] birth
[47:35] and that's only one could do that that's
[47:37] god look at verse four
[47:38] now he begins to speak of this but god
[47:42] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[47:46] wherewith
[47:46] he loved us even when we were
[47:50] dead in sins hath
[47:53] quickened us together with christ
[47:57] by grace ye are saved and hath
[48:00] raised us up together and made us
[48:04] sit together in heavenly places in
[48:07] christ jesus
[48:08] that in the ages to come he might show
[48:12] the exceeding riches of his grace
[48:14] and his kindness toward us through
[48:16] christ jesus
[48:18] for by grace are ye saved
[48:21] through faith and that
[48:25] not of yourselves
[48:28] it is the gift of god
[48:32] not of works lest any man
[48:36] should boast it's not what we
[48:39] quit is what he took
[48:44] amen amen for
[48:47] we are his workmanship
[48:51] created in christ jesus unto good works
[48:54] which god hath before ordained
[48:58] that we should walk in them
[49:01] amen i'll tell you this is one
[49:04] funeral where this eulogy is wrote right
[49:07] here
[49:08] this is a funeral that bring calls us
[49:10] some rejoicing
[49:12] this is a this is a eulogy when
[49:14] ministered and received and
[49:15] identified this funeral it causes
[49:18] rejoicing amen amen amen
[49:23] i'd like to continue to speak to you
[49:24] this morning on the sovereign
[49:26] working of the holy ghost may god bless
[49:28] you bless the word
[49:30] as you're being seated
[49:36] i want to come back into those places
[49:39] on thursday but i want to move where we
[49:41] were at and move just a little bit
[49:44] further and i know sometimes it's a
[49:46] little different and god will do things
[49:47] a little different i feel
[49:49] just to continue with on some of these
[49:51] parts
[49:52] right through service after service
[49:56] there's some things we're just trying to
[49:58] just being impressed of the lord to
[50:01] to come to we look at this
[50:05] and to know that
[50:08] when we speak of the sovereign working
[50:10] of the holy ghost we
[50:12] recognize that it's the same god
[50:17] in when we look back at genesis 1 where
[50:20] we find
[50:21] that the earth was darkness and void
[50:24] there wasn't any any life that was
[50:27] expressed upon it
[50:29] but when god spoke he began to speak now
[50:33] every seed was already planted that was
[50:35] there
[50:36] you couldn't see let's just say the
[50:38] tomato plant or the orange
[50:40] tree you didn't see that but the seed
[50:42] was already there
[50:44] but what was needed in order for the
[50:46] seed to come forth
[50:48] is the atmosphere had to change
[50:51] that was upon the earth you see it was
[50:53] an atmosphere
[50:54] that was was was preventing or
[50:58] not allowing that seed to come forth you
[51:01] see
[51:02] darkness itself the the earth itself in
[51:04] that in that condition
[51:06] in genesis 1 it shows
[51:09] that darkness had come there had been a
[51:11] separation
[51:12] from god's uh from from the from the
[51:15] very presence of god but now the word
[51:18] this is grace in genesis 1. now the word
[51:21] comes
[51:22] and says let there be light and
[51:25] god in speaking that word it now
[51:29] is speaking with authority to the
[51:31] darkness that is
[51:32] over the earth to give way that the
[51:35] light
[51:36] might have the right-of-way the
[51:38] preeminence and we all know this
[51:40] in the simple terms that light is
[51:43] greater than darkness even in the
[51:44] natural
[51:45] you can take a little a little match and
[51:47] you light a little match and this room
[51:49] could be completely
[51:50] dark with no windows but you light a
[51:52] little match you'll see that little
[51:54] flicker of light or you can take a
[51:55] a real dim flashlight a real dark room
[51:59] and that little that little itty bit of
[52:01] light it will still
[52:02] it will uh uh overpower the darkness but
[52:07] we we recognize that within this whole
[52:09] working in genesis 1
[52:11] it is god moving back and changing the
[52:14] atmosphere
[52:16] in order to bring forth the desire
[52:20] and what he has placed within that earth
[52:23] those seeds to come forth
[52:25] now all it needs for that let's say that
[52:28] tomato plant that was planned planted
[52:30] there
[52:31] it it all it needs is the one who spoke
[52:35] it
[52:35] knows where it's at that he would send
[52:38] his light
[52:39] and the nourishment upon it and
[52:41] everything
[52:42] that is in it the characteristic of a
[52:45] tomato plant
[52:46] everything is already within that seed
[52:50] that seed will not have to try to look
[52:53] at other tomato plants and say
[52:55] well i wonder how i get leaves like that
[52:57] or how do i get tomatoes like that no no
[52:59] it's already in it the only thing it
[53:01] needs
[53:02] it needs now life something
[53:05] that is greater than itself to come
[53:08] and release it from the shell that it is
[53:12] inside
[53:14] now when we look at this god working and
[53:17] drawing
[53:18] us unto himself and when we see this we
[53:22] look in
[53:23] ezekiel 36 i want to go right back in
[53:25] there
[53:26] in ezekiel 36 24
[53:29] god says for i will take you from among
[53:33] the heathen and gather you out of
[53:36] all countries and will bring you
[53:40] into your own land
[53:43] see it's god god calls for a separation
[53:47] then will i sprinkle clean water upon
[53:50] you that's the preaching of the word
[53:52] and you shall be clean
[53:56] from all your filthiness and from all
[53:59] your idols
[54:00] will i cleanse you you see once god
[54:02] brings them into a place it's important
[54:05] that to its it's a blessed reality
[54:08] that you can hear the voice of god and
[54:11] it's not just to hear it but that you've
[54:13] got a heart
[54:14] that will even be open and say yes lord
[54:17] that's all you got to say
[54:19] is yes lord that's yielding to him and
[54:22] then
[54:22] god's drawing you and his word is going
[54:26] forth
[54:27] to cleanse you you realize right now
[54:29] through this room
[54:31] there are waves that are passing through
[54:33] this room
[54:34] this this box that i have right here
[54:37] this transmitter
[54:38] there are waves that's going to a box
[54:41] over there
[54:41] and then it's channeled all through the
[54:43] wiring and this is what you hear
[54:45] over top of all the speakers and things
[54:48] but
[54:48] you don't see those waves
[54:52] you don't see them at all there's waves
[54:54] going through this room
[54:55] television waves there's wi-fi signals
[54:58] there's
[54:59] you know all these g's three four five
[55:01] and whatever more kind of g
[55:03] is going through this right now there
[55:05] are signals of cell phone calls
[55:08] there's voices going through here listen
[55:10] to me and i'm this is not i'm not
[55:12] speaking here of scripture
[55:14] this is science you know that but you
[55:17] recognize
[55:18] you don't see it you don't hear it but
[55:20] if you had a device
[55:22] something that was able to pick that up
[55:25] those waves
[55:26] and break in on that then it would no
[55:28] longer be
[55:29] something that is just out to error in
[55:32] the invisible
[55:33] it becomes something that is known
[55:37] is that right yes so we find
[55:40] how that god er how he moves by his word
[55:44] and i say that
[55:45] to to make this statement when we are
[55:48] setting and we're listening to the word
[55:50] let me just tell you something
[55:52] i i you know i've stood upon this for
[55:55] many many times in this old church you
[55:58] don't have to wait to a certain time of
[56:00] the service
[56:01] for all of a sudden the change to come
[56:04] the word while it's being
[56:06] preached while it's being preached
[56:10] the word can go right to work in your
[56:12] life
[56:15] god can move down so deep within a life
[56:18] that
[56:19] while that word is going forth this is
[56:21] scripture
[56:22] that they were filled with the holy
[56:25] ghost
[56:25] while the word was going forward
[56:29] demons were cut from their life
[56:31] sicknesses were cut from their life
[56:33] i want you to understand jesus said my
[56:35] words they are spirit and life
[56:37] he also told him that the kingdom of god
[56:40] he says
[56:40] it does not it's not something that
[56:42] comes visibly
[56:44] but it comes without he says without
[56:45] observation and the kingdom of god
[56:48] is the joy the peace and power in the
[56:51] holy ghost
[56:52] it's the word revealed and made manifest
[56:55] that what does it do
[56:56] it reveals jesus christ in all his power
[56:59] and authority to be the same yesterday
[57:02] today and forever
[57:03] i say it like this that that word going
[57:05] forth if you can
[57:07] just said in your heart to say i've come
[57:09] here to receive from you lord at your
[57:12] needs
[57:12] you watch how the word the word can pass
[57:15] right in
[57:16] to your being and you could have come in
[57:18] here all
[57:19] down in the dumps you could have come in
[57:21] here bound with sin
[57:22] you could have come in here empty but
[57:24] when the word passes through
[57:26] your life you then become that receiver
[57:30] of the signal that's being sent
[57:35] amen jesus said
[57:39] within this we find because this is the
[57:42] spirit
[57:43] of the lord jesus here moving verse 26
[57:46] of ezekiel 36
[57:48] notice what god said he will do
[57:51] a new heart also will i give you
[57:55] and a new spirit will i put within you
[58:01] this is nothing that we have done it's
[58:04] nothing you as a person can do
[58:06] this is what god said he will do
[58:08] [Music]
[58:10] and i will take away the stony heart out
[58:13] of your flesh
[58:14] and i will give you a heart of flesh
[58:17] this is all
[58:18] an operation of the holy spirit he is
[58:21] preparing amen that
[58:24] vessel that he might come and dwell
[58:27] in that life let me just say it like
[58:30] this
[58:30] just as the prophets of old were
[58:33] anointed
[58:35] by the logos by the holy spirit and they
[58:37] would speak
[58:38] and these prophecies that were laying in
[58:41] the scripture
[58:42] that would speak of the coming of the
[58:44] messiah
[58:45] it's the same way that with the working
[58:48] of the holy spirit
[58:49] in our life it is him that he is under
[58:52] we're under his operation
[58:54] and he is making a preparation
[58:57] for him to come just as he came
[59:01] in the body of his son of that flesh
[59:04] that was the coming of the lord is that
[59:05] right it's the same way
[59:07] the word goes forth to prepare
[59:10] for what the coming of the lord which is
[59:13] the holy ghost
[59:14] in you he's preparing his coming
[59:18] jesus could not come without john
[59:20] proceeding
[59:21] is that right there had to be a
[59:23] preparation boulders in the road when a
[59:25] king is traveling down this road
[59:27] boulder's got to be moved the roads got
[59:30] to be cleared out
[59:32] this is what the word comes to do it
[59:34] comes to clear
[59:35] things out for the word himself to come
[59:39] in
[59:44] and then look you see this is
[59:47] a new heart and a new spirit it's a very
[59:50] wonderful thing
[59:52] but the sad reality is that's where many
[59:54] people stop
[59:56] and i say many people i'm having numbers
[59:59] i'm just saying this
[1:00:00] right here this is where brother branham
[1:00:02] under the inspiration of the spirit of
[1:00:04] god
[1:00:05] would begin to go in preaching messages
[1:00:09] the impersonation of christianity
[1:00:11] what some people can't keep victory what
[1:00:13] does it take to
[1:00:14] live a christian life and go into
[1:00:17] messages after messaging and dealing
[1:00:20] with this because
[1:00:22] what it what was seen is there were
[1:00:24] lives
[1:00:25] that were up and down they were in
[1:00:28] and out up and down i'm not talking
[1:00:32] about a person getting
[1:00:33] down within where you can get down or
[1:00:36] discouraged
[1:00:37] but i'm talking about where it is alive
[1:00:40] that though god has touched that life
[1:00:42] they've repented of their sins
[1:00:44] but they come to a place and they get
[1:00:46] remember that first birth
[1:00:48] is a birth based on reasoning against
[1:00:51] the word
[1:00:53] i'm okay i'm a good guy i do a lot of
[1:00:56] good things for a lot of good people
[1:00:57] the rich young ruler had you beat
[1:01:01] he stood right before the lord jesus and
[1:01:03] said i've kept every commandment
[1:01:05] if he was lying jesus could have called
[1:01:08] him out
[1:01:09] but what he felt and what he failed in
[1:01:12] he didn't
[1:01:13] have eternal life and eternal life
[1:01:17] is not a commandment it is the person
[1:01:21] of jesus christ
[1:01:26] see this is what happens you see when
[1:01:28] brother brown would pray wouldn't deal
[1:01:30] with this
[1:01:31] he would make when the word comes let me
[1:01:33] just tell you something the devil gets
[1:01:34] all squirmy
[1:01:36] because he knows he's being uncovered
[1:01:40] because his whole plot and ploy is to
[1:01:42] rob you
[1:01:43] from what god has desired and intended
[1:01:46] for you to be
[1:01:50] and to notice if the uncovering of where
[1:01:54] we find that new heart and that new
[1:01:56] spirit and remember
[1:01:57] as we were looking there on thursday uh
[1:02:00] evening
[1:02:01] when when the bible says when the
[1:02:03] unclean spirit
[1:02:04] is gone out not cast out right
[1:02:07] not cast out when the unclean spirit has
[1:02:09] gone out when does the unclean spirit go
[1:02:11] out you know sometimes
[1:02:13] you know you look and you say well man i
[1:02:15] never seen this
[1:02:16] a devil cast out let me just say it to
[1:02:18] you like this every time
[1:02:20] when prayer is offered for the sick it's
[1:02:22] coming against the devil
[1:02:25] you take aware of life here healing
[1:02:27] comes in
[1:02:28] it speaks there's been a repelling a
[1:02:31] driving back
[1:02:32] of satan of the spirit listen that's why
[1:02:35] sickness comes in our body
[1:02:37] these bodies themselves the cells and
[1:02:40] and one more you can do whatever you
[1:02:41] want to
[1:02:42] you can suck carrot juice to your orange
[1:02:44] in the face
[1:02:46] there is you'll never bring this body to
[1:02:48] a place to where
[1:02:49] it's completely free and so
[1:02:53] immunized to where it'll never get sick
[1:02:56] there's weaknesses in our bodies in our
[1:02:59] cells
[1:03:00] this is why we need healing
[1:03:04] when healing comes what does it do the
[1:03:07] first thing
[1:03:08] is to cast out that spirit is to address
[1:03:11] that life
[1:03:12] when jesus came to the tree and fruit
[1:03:14] was not on it he
[1:03:16] said cursed be this tree
[1:03:19] for not having fruit amen what did he
[1:03:22] speak to
[1:03:22] the the life that was in the root
[1:03:26] and when they came out the next day they
[1:03:28] found the tree was dried up from the
[1:03:30] root
[1:03:32] see it comes it comes to deal
[1:03:36] within within that life in that
[1:03:39] new heart god giving a new heart and a
[1:03:42] new spirit that's a new
[1:03:44] way of thinking this is where people
[1:03:46] begin to say
[1:03:47] oh yeah yeah and it's a wonderful thing
[1:03:50] let me just understand
[1:03:51] don't misunderstand me it's a wonderful
[1:03:53] thing because it's a working of the holy
[1:03:55] ghost
[1:03:56] but it is not the holy ghost himself
[1:04:00] coming in it's him preparing
[1:04:04] because remember he's not going to come
[1:04:07] in with somebody who's disagreeable
[1:04:12] you'd be foolish to marry somebody
[1:04:14] you're arguing with all the time
[1:04:18] god's not going to do that well when he
[1:04:21] comes in i'll stop him to argue
[1:04:22] no he's working in a manner to bring
[1:04:25] a lamb like life
[1:04:29] if there's a seed on the inside it's
[1:04:32] lamb
[1:04:33] and it takes the lamb of god to bring
[1:04:35] that lamb to life what is that lamb
[1:04:37] doing it's where it begins to sacrifice
[1:04:39] it's where it begins to release it's
[1:04:41] where it begins to yield
[1:04:42] to the working of the holy spirit
[1:04:46] then the bible says see the heart the
[1:04:49] heart becomes open
[1:04:52] a new spirit it becomes open
[1:04:55] and see then god said
[1:04:59] in verse 27 and i will put
[1:05:02] my spirit within you
[1:05:06] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:05:09] you shall keep my judgments
[1:05:11] and do them let me just say it like this
[1:05:14] i don't believe there's any person
[1:05:16] that begins their walk with the lord
[1:05:19] with the purpose or the intent
[1:05:23] of failing
[1:05:27] it's a walk that has to begin by faith
[1:05:31] he that cometh to god must first believe
[1:05:34] that he is
[1:05:35] and that he is a rewarded warner of them
[1:05:38] that do
[1:05:38] diligently seek him amen
[1:05:42] that's a gift of god grace comes
[1:05:45] by your way and it's not god's faith
[1:05:47] it's your faith
[1:05:48] grace comes by to cause your faith
[1:05:52] to rise for your salvation
[1:05:55] are you with me this is why
[1:06:00] as the working of the holy spirit
[1:06:04] coming in our life and this is why i i i
[1:06:07] just a very clear when a person
[1:06:09] surrenders their heart to god
[1:06:11] they're touched in a service do not get
[1:06:14] in your mind
[1:06:15] that just come into this church you've
[1:06:18] made it
[1:06:18] right because now you got a bible on the
[1:06:22] coffee table
[1:06:23] you've made it that's religion
[1:06:28] that's religion there are many in hell
[1:06:31] right now because they accepted
[1:06:35] religion instead of salvation
[1:06:42] amen come on now we're going to get
[1:06:45] somewhere
[1:06:47] he is to be the object of our desire
[1:06:52] amen it's him that's to be the goal
[1:06:56] if a person comes and i'm just being
[1:06:57] very frank if a person comes and says
[1:06:59] well i don't want to be a prostitute no
[1:07:01] more
[1:07:01] i don't want to be a fornicator no more
[1:07:03] i don't want to be a doctor no more i
[1:07:05] don't want to be a drunkard no more
[1:07:07] that is not enough you're just wanting
[1:07:11] to be a better person
[1:07:13] that's not what christianity is about
[1:07:15] christianity
[1:07:17] is about christ coming in you and then
[1:07:20] the attributes
[1:07:21] of his life you become a good person
[1:07:34] no one yields their life
[1:07:38] with the intent of well i just i want my
[1:07:41] life just to be
[1:07:42] swept out and garnished and cleaned up
[1:07:46] and i just want to make ready for that
[1:07:48] for the unclean spirit to come back with
[1:07:49] seven other devils
[1:07:51] nobody enters that is that right
[1:07:55] nobody does that but what happens
[1:07:58] is when a person this is understand this
[1:08:01] is where it becomes an
[1:08:02] impersonation of christianity where
[1:08:05] it becomes you or anybody trying to live
[1:08:10] a christian life without it being
[1:08:13] christ in you doing it it's an
[1:08:16] impersonation
[1:08:19] you're having to make yourself
[1:08:23] after a while guess what your will
[1:08:26] and your intellect will have to give in
[1:08:31] right
[1:08:36] you see what happens this is what
[1:08:39] happens when the unclean spirit has gone
[1:08:41] out
[1:08:42] a person can say man i used to drink i
[1:08:44] used to smoke
[1:08:45] i used to do this and i used to do that
[1:08:48] man
[1:08:49] i must really be on on the right cause i
[1:08:52] don't drink and i don't smoke and
[1:08:54] i don't wear pants no more i don't do
[1:08:56] this no more
[1:08:57] that don't mean that you're full of the
[1:08:58] holy ghost
[1:09:02] come on preach with me now you see what
[1:09:05] can happen is
[1:09:06] this is where unclean spirits when a
[1:09:08] person comes to a place
[1:09:10] that they're not going to move any
[1:09:12] further they begin to reason
[1:09:14] against the word well i'm a better
[1:09:16] person than i used to be i'm
[1:09:17] you don't want to just be a better
[1:09:19] person you want to be a holy
[1:09:20] ghost-filled
[1:09:21] person you want to be born again
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:30] this is the desire this is the blessing
[1:09:32] that we would be invited to be
[1:09:35] partakers of because this many times
[1:09:38] is the reason why and i pray that god i
[1:09:41] just speak it right now
[1:09:43] i pray that every unclean spirit and
[1:09:45] every devil that would try to make
[1:09:46] people antsy
[1:09:48] walk away from their computer or walk
[1:09:49] away even here i
[1:09:51] bind every one of those devils that
[1:09:53] would want to try to hinder this working
[1:09:55] because he knows the power of this word
[1:09:58] of the holy ghost
[1:09:59] taking residency in that life and him
[1:10:02] being exposed he's uncovered he's
[1:10:04] powerless
[1:10:08] when god comes down brother brown would
[1:10:11] put it just as simple as this right here
[1:10:13] it's when god sends his bulldozer down
[1:10:17] praise the lord see
[1:10:21] those seven other devils coming in
[1:10:23] becomes a religious person remember what
[1:10:25] we read on thursday night it ended they
[1:10:26] become oh my they're a real bad drunk
[1:10:28] now or they're a real bad
[1:10:30] bad dope head right now or they're no no
[1:10:32] no they become religious
[1:10:34] that's the worst kind of devil there is
[1:10:37] is a religious
[1:10:39] devil
[1:10:42] that's the worst kind of devil there is
[1:10:45] but when the holy ghost comes down
[1:10:47] he comes down with the bulldozer
[1:10:51] hallelujah he comes down with the
[1:10:53] bulldozer in the backhoe
[1:10:56] come on now some of you many of you
[1:10:58] build houses i've been housing those
[1:10:59] you've seen those things take place when
[1:11:01] they there is a blueprint
[1:11:03] they have that lot it's already divided
[1:11:05] they come in there
[1:11:06] with a bulldozer first there's got to be
[1:11:08] men that can go around and move
[1:11:11] that dirt around level it out getting it
[1:11:13] into a place trying to get the the
[1:11:15] drainage right as much as they can
[1:11:17] before the backhoe comes in and the
[1:11:19] backhoe begins
[1:11:20] to dig the areas for the lines of water
[1:11:23] and
[1:11:23] sewer and all those things and begins to
[1:11:26] dig out where the basement's gonna go
[1:11:28] that is all part of the preparation for
[1:11:31] your house
[1:11:32] it takes that where a decision has been
[1:11:34] made
[1:11:35] and now there's work that starts on that
[1:11:37] lot there is that bulldozer there is
[1:11:39] that backhoe
[1:11:40] what is it doing it's preparing to lay a
[1:11:43] foundation
[1:11:44] it's preparing to build a house why
[1:11:47] because
[1:11:47] your desire is i'm going to live in that
[1:11:50] house that's how
[1:11:51] god works he is preparing when he sends
[1:11:55] down the bulldozer
[1:11:56] bulldozes out all the tin cans bulldozes
[1:11:59] and cleans it out
[1:12:00] he is preparing to come himself
[1:12:05] well he puts the drainage just right so
[1:12:07] the holy ghost it'll flow right out of
[1:12:08] your life
[1:12:09] he does not let me just tell you the
[1:12:11] holy ghost does not turn you into the
[1:12:12] charge
[1:12:13] and keeping of somebody else he comes
[1:12:15] himself and he's he's the caretaker
[1:12:18] matter of fact brother graham said the
[1:12:19] angels trim your bushes
[1:12:23] they are the landscapers
[1:12:26] because we're under his working amen
[1:12:30] is that right now this this sovereign
[1:12:33] working of the holy spirit jesus i'm
[1:12:36] just going to refer to some of these
[1:12:37] places in moving
[1:12:38] when jesus stands there talking to
[1:12:40] nicodemus
[1:12:42] here he comes and before this time
[1:12:45] he could never speak in terms
[1:12:49] that the time had arrived where a man
[1:12:53] or a woman could actually be born again
[1:12:56] we read in ezekiel and you see it all
[1:12:58] the way it's all typed out from genesis
[1:13:00] 1
[1:13:01] all the way through of god's desire to
[1:13:04] come
[1:13:04] in redemption and dwell in the midst
[1:13:08] of his people is that right so the
[1:13:11] sovereign working
[1:13:12] of the holy spirit he begins to work
[1:13:16] within that life paul would call it paul
[1:13:18] would say it like this
[1:13:20] he would say great is the mystery of
[1:13:23] godliness
[1:13:24] it is the new birth is a paradox
[1:13:28] you can't explain it right
[1:13:32] you can't explain it but you know that
[1:13:34] it took place
[1:13:37] it wasn't an emotion the motion might
[1:13:39] have accompanied it
[1:13:40] but it was an emotion the new birth is
[1:13:43] the
[1:13:43] passing from death unto
[1:13:46] life and jesus
[1:13:50] here in john 3 he lays this
[1:13:53] fundamental this is this is the
[1:13:55] fundamental doctrine
[1:13:57] of the church of the living god he said
[1:14:00] ye without a man being uh
[1:14:03] born of water and of spirit he can't
[1:14:05] enter into the kingdom of god
[1:14:07] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:14:10] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:14:13] spirit
[1:14:14] and notice he says marvel not that i say
[1:14:17] unto you
[1:14:18] you must be born again notice the words
[1:14:20] marvel not
[1:14:21] because a person marvel not they're
[1:14:24] trying to think
[1:14:24] trying to figure this out that's what
[1:14:26] nicodemus was trying to do
[1:14:28] how in the world can a man be born again
[1:14:30] does he have to enter
[1:14:31] back into his mother's womb that'll
[1:14:32] produce the same thing it produced the
[1:14:34] first time
[1:14:35] if it was possible because he that's
[1:14:37] born of a woman
[1:14:38] is a few days old and full of
[1:14:49] but there has to be that has to come
[1:14:52] forth
[1:14:52] a birth that is not of the woman tree
[1:14:56] hallelujah there has to come a
[1:15:00] birth that comes by the man tree the
[1:15:02] tree
[1:15:03] of life are you with me
[1:15:06] it would have to be his life so
[1:15:10] this is where the great uh mystery
[1:15:13] and the condescension of almighty god
[1:15:15] coming down
[1:15:16] and you see this is indeed where it is a
[1:15:19] mystery
[1:15:20] many people can look at your life and we
[1:15:22] don't have to go out there people can
[1:15:24] even look right in here and say
[1:15:25] well i don't understand it i i don't
[1:15:27] know how you know brother samuel or
[1:15:29] brother so-and-so or sister so and so i
[1:15:30] don't know how they do it you gotta know
[1:15:32] what your family understand is not the
[1:15:35] person's
[1:15:36] uh dna that's doing it
[1:15:39] there's some people who are some strong
[1:15:41] resolute people
[1:15:42] that says i'm not gonna drink that
[1:15:44] that's not good for business deals i'm
[1:15:46] not gonna do it they're a strong
[1:15:47] resolute person
[1:15:48] come on somebody there's people that can
[1:15:50] lay things down they stop this and stop
[1:15:52] that but you remember
[1:15:53] this is something that's so much greater
[1:15:56] it's not
[1:15:57] our works does the holy spirit come
[1:16:00] to energize us to lay things down yes he
[1:16:04] does
[1:16:04] by his sanctifying power
[1:16:09] don't marvel don't be perplexed
[1:16:12] about his work jesus goes on to say
[1:16:16] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[1:16:19] thou hearst the sound thereof
[1:16:20] but can't not tell whence it cometh and
[1:16:23] whether it goeth
[1:16:24] so is everyone that is born of the
[1:16:26] spirit you're a mystery
[1:16:30] you're a mystery people can't figure out
[1:16:32] what's wrong with your life
[1:16:36] right god did a work in my life
[1:16:41] all the people said give him so many
[1:16:43] weeks he'll be back out here
[1:16:47] they knew they knew and i say this
[1:16:50] shamefully
[1:16:50] even the police couldn't straighten it
[1:16:52] up
[1:16:55] i had a lot of promises but right back
[1:16:56] at it why
[1:16:58] nature right nature
[1:17:01] our promises don't do anything
[1:17:04] but i can tell you this right here when
[1:17:06] god deals with the heart and you
[1:17:08] stand on that word and say
[1:17:11] god i'm finished with sin
[1:17:16] let me just tell you something he's
[1:17:18] their present
[1:17:19] to take you he's the one that's drawing
[1:17:21] you and he's the one to make sure
[1:17:24] and to see that that desire that he
[1:17:26] sovereignly
[1:17:28] is raising up in your life that it comes
[1:17:30] to pass remember
[1:17:31] there's not one person in her that can
[1:17:33] bring the word to pass
[1:17:34] but he brings his word to pass and you
[1:17:37] are a part of the word
[1:17:38] and he brings his word to pass
[1:17:47] hebrews 10 1 for the law
[1:17:51] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:17:58] and not the very image of the thing the
[1:18:00] law gave sacrifices
[1:18:02] but it was a shadow the shadow it was
[1:18:05] not the very image
[1:18:07] can never with those sacrifices which
[1:18:09] they offered year by year
[1:18:10] continually make the comers there unto
[1:18:13] perfect
[1:18:16] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:18:18] be offered
[1:18:20] because that the worshipers once
[1:18:23] purged should have had no more
[1:18:26] conscience or
[1:18:27] desire of sins
[1:18:31] now remember god can touch our heart and
[1:18:35] deal with the heart
[1:18:37] and that heart can raise because there's
[1:18:40] three stages to a birth
[1:18:41] right is that right water blood
[1:18:44] spirit justification
[1:18:48] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:52] three stages of the sovereign working
[1:18:55] of the holy ghost now remember a person
[1:18:57] can repent of their scent wonderful
[1:19:00] wonderful i rejoice in that don't you
[1:19:04] if you don't something's wrong i rejoice
[1:19:07] in that
[1:19:08] now they could repent of their sin and
[1:19:10] they receive
[1:19:11] forgiveness from the sins that they
[1:19:15] committed but here's the thing
[1:19:18] if they don't go any further than that
[1:19:21] they're still the snake on the inside
[1:19:24] the very root or cause of why they did
[1:19:28] those other things
[1:19:30] forgiveness is like you snapping off the
[1:19:32] dandelion and the roots still there
[1:19:35] it'll come back it'll come back
[1:19:39] is that right so forgiveness is a
[1:19:42] wonderful thing
[1:19:43] but want to go deeper to where that the
[1:19:46] very
[1:19:46] snake is removed
[1:19:50] because that's a real problem see god
[1:19:52] deals with the heart to bring it in
[1:19:54] forgiveness
[1:19:55] for you to recognize there is indeed
[1:19:58] forgiveness for me through the blood of
[1:20:01] jesus christ
[1:20:01] i don't care how rank or how vile i
[1:20:03] don't care how a person is
[1:20:06] oh brother samuel this age you know this
[1:20:08] age is filled with all sorts of stuff
[1:20:10] it's already been covered in the word of
[1:20:12] god
[1:20:16] i'm sure that coral corinth those who
[1:20:19] are in corinth they wouldn't walk in
[1:20:20] here today and blush
[1:20:22] they would not walk in this world in
[1:20:24] blush but god let them know
[1:20:27] where where they came from he let them
[1:20:29] know their past
[1:20:31] their past had been removed he let them
[1:20:34] know
[1:20:34] because there was a process
[1:20:37] that they had been brought through to
[1:20:41] complete victory
[1:20:43] so when we recognize when we when we
[1:20:46] see that this perfection that god was
[1:20:49] calling for
[1:20:50] it would never come by offerings
[1:20:52] perfection doesn't come by offerings
[1:20:54] the offerings in the old testament it
[1:20:56] only covered sin
[1:21:00] in other words they were forgiven when
[1:21:02] they came and offered that sacrifice
[1:21:04] they were forgiven
[1:21:06] but you see the coming of the very image
[1:21:09] the true sacrifice the lamb of god
[1:21:11] there would come forth the holy creative
[1:21:14] blood of god peter would call it the
[1:21:16] blood of christ
[1:21:18] and that would pay the ransom the
[1:21:21] payment
[1:21:21] required for sin in order that we could
[1:21:24] go
[1:21:25] free let me just tell you something i
[1:21:27] understand
[1:21:28] over 2000 years ago that that event of
[1:21:31] calvary
[1:21:32] was made manifest it was there
[1:21:35] in the mind of god before adam started
[1:21:38] us to molecule
[1:21:40] revelations 13 8 that the lamb was slain
[1:21:43] but from for the foundation of the world
[1:21:45] before the devil ever was
[1:21:47] before there was ever god already had
[1:21:50] the plan
[1:21:51] set amen what was the plan
[1:21:54] that his children though his children
[1:21:57] would be
[1:21:57] separated by a birth that would come
[1:22:01] from reasoning against the word but he
[1:22:03] would come
[1:22:04] by his word and deliver his children
[1:22:08] that were trapped in that first birth
[1:22:10] that did not ask to come that way
[1:22:13] but they were trapped like an eagle in a
[1:22:16] zoo
[1:22:16] the eagle dries up and he wants to get
[1:22:19] out
[1:22:20] and it comes back down it flies up why
[1:22:22] there's something in it
[1:22:24] that is built to fly and the cage
[1:22:28] the bars are keeping it from escaping
[1:22:31] but there's got to come one who's able
[1:22:35] to set that eagle free and when he sets
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:38] eagle free it don't become an eagle it
[1:22:42] always was an eagle
[1:22:43] now it escapes the bondage
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:50] so god came down the very image
[1:22:54] wrapped himself in a blood cell
[1:22:56] hallelujah
[1:22:58] many great men abraham elijah on and on
[1:23:02] but every one of them were polluted
[1:23:03] blood everyone came just like you and me
[1:23:09] there had to be a blood that could deal
[1:23:11] with the sin
[1:23:12] question there had to be a blood that
[1:23:14] could pay the debt
[1:23:17] this was not a time of covering it was a
[1:23:20] time of redemption
[1:23:21] amen amen glory be to god
[1:23:25] see he would come in the likeness of
[1:23:27] sinful flesh he would take upon him as
[1:23:29] the bible said
[1:23:30] the seed of abraham he would experience
[1:23:33] every weary feeling that you or i feel
[1:23:36] right he would experience every
[1:23:38] temptation
[1:23:40] he would experience every sickness he
[1:23:42] would experience all of that
[1:23:44] and then in full obedience walk
[1:23:48] to calvary and pay the price shedding
[1:23:51] his blood
[1:23:52] he would descend into the lowest parts
[1:23:54] of hell and deposit our sin
[1:23:57] debt there and he would come triumphant
[1:24:00] marching right down up through the
[1:24:02] corners of hell
[1:24:03] stop in paradise empty out paradise and
[1:24:06] lead them
[1:24:07] up here in a resurrection is that right
[1:24:10] what was it it was the working of
[1:24:13] almighty god to destroy the works
[1:24:17] of the devil this is why
[1:24:21] it's a blood that comes to you and i a
[1:24:23] blood
[1:24:24] this is let me just i'm being very
[1:24:26] purposeful here
[1:24:27] this this blood it don't just forgive
[1:24:30] you
[1:24:31] many times i think the the thing is
[1:24:34] people want to they experience the
[1:24:36] forgiveness
[1:24:36] and thinks that's deliverance
[1:24:39] forgiveness is not deliverance
[1:24:41] forgiveness only makes way for your
[1:24:43] faith to say
[1:24:44] i can be delivered amen forgiveness is
[1:24:47] where they feel
[1:24:48] oh my you know i feel the lord lifted
[1:24:50] off and i feel this and that's a
[1:24:51] wonderful thing
[1:24:52] listen friends we we need the
[1:24:54] forgiveness of god
[1:24:56] even after we've crossed the line we we
[1:24:58] uh you know
[1:24:59] and from death unto life we still are
[1:25:02] things that where we die daily
[1:25:04] but it's not something in our nature
[1:25:07] i don't want to go there but you
[1:25:08] understand there's got to be a blood
[1:25:11] a power that comes that's not something
[1:25:13] that's presented to you and i
[1:25:15] that it's just forgiveness but it's
[1:25:17] something so much
[1:25:18] deeper than forgiveness it's where you
[1:25:21] come to a place
[1:25:22] you're no longer identified with that
[1:25:25] old
[1:25:26] man he's dead
[1:25:29] funeral has been preached a eulogy is
[1:25:32] being read
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:37] will they come and say i remember when
[1:25:39] you this i remember you know what you do
[1:25:42] you you remember the house but the guy
[1:25:45] used to be here
[1:25:48] he left he got evicted
[1:25:51] how did he get evicted well you see the
[1:25:53] holy ghost came and began to energize my
[1:25:55] faith
[1:25:56] i began to see something greater than
[1:25:58] what i had ever saw you see
[1:26:00] i've been trying to satisfy my thirst
[1:26:01] with all other sorts of things
[1:26:03] but i realize that'll never satisfy my
[1:26:05] thirst and there became one
[1:26:07] around my my my pathway you know you
[1:26:10] know like the woman at the well
[1:26:11] and he began to deal with a real thirst
[1:26:14] that was in my life that nothing could
[1:26:15] satisfy
[1:26:16] or quench and when he began to stir my
[1:26:19] faith how was he doing that he was doing
[1:26:20] that by his word
[1:26:22] they weren't playing an organ they were
[1:26:23] not playing a piano his word
[1:26:25] was creating an atmosphere for faith
[1:26:29] to take hold it was his word that was
[1:26:32] going forth
[1:26:32] her life she came to that well it was
[1:26:35] covered with
[1:26:36] darkness but the word began to move
[1:26:38] forth
[1:26:39] and the spirit was there to perform what
[1:26:42] the word
[1:26:43] had spoken amen
[1:26:46] no no no the guy that used to live here
[1:26:50] you don't live here no more
[1:26:54] amen it's time to do ownership
[1:26:57] see a new heart and a new spirit it can
[1:26:59] get ashamed
[1:27:01] why don't you quit doing this well you
[1:27:03] see what it is the
[1:27:04] science said you know this and science
[1:27:07] said that and
[1:27:08] or sometimes people say well you know my
[1:27:10] church teaches this
[1:27:12] so it ain't yours you're ashamed of it
[1:27:19] come on now preach with me a new heart
[1:27:21] new spirit he can get out there among
[1:27:23] the people
[1:27:24] and he starts getting ashamed you know
[1:27:26] why because it ain't standing on solid
[1:27:28] ground
[1:27:31] come on now i'm not i'm not i might be
[1:27:33] scolding you but this is spirit of god
[1:27:34] uncovering
[1:27:35] satan's working in your life i tell you
[1:27:38] out of these services god's bringing
[1:27:39] forth you're either going to move on
[1:27:41] into victory or you're going to go
[1:27:42] further in defeat
[1:27:44] it's your choice what you do with the
[1:27:46] word of god amen
[1:27:50] amen but i promise you this i'm sure the
[1:27:52] holy ghost
[1:27:53] he's going to keep on working and
[1:27:55] dealing and moving in our life
[1:27:58] you see there's a blood that comes to
[1:28:00] loosen us this is why
[1:28:01] paul i don't have time to read these
[1:28:04] statements over and over but paul
[1:28:06] would deal with not just how that the
[1:28:08] lord jesus was crucified
[1:28:10] because he had to be crucified he had to
[1:28:14] pay
[1:28:15] the penalty for you and me but remember
[1:28:19] paul would go on to say how in that he
[1:28:22] died
[1:28:22] he died only once
[1:28:26] and whoever is dead is made free
[1:28:31] paul would deal with this crucifixion
[1:28:33] and he would
[1:28:34] he would he would emphatically express
[1:28:36] that
[1:28:37] by jesus christ the world is crucified
[1:28:40] to me
[1:28:41] and i'm crucified to it he would say
[1:28:44] that every believer
[1:28:45] for every child of god has crucified the
[1:28:47] flesh
[1:28:48] and the affections and the lust thereof
[1:28:52] in galatians 2 20 let me pick this up he
[1:28:55] said i
[1:28:55] am notice this testimony i am crucified
[1:29:00] with christ
[1:29:04] nevertheless i live yet not i
[1:29:09] but christ liveth in
[1:29:12] me not what i'm struggling to do
[1:29:17] christ is living in me
[1:29:23] this coat is like the body
[1:29:26] it just so happens that this coat in
[1:29:28] this suit did not get purchased by
[1:29:30] somebody
[1:29:31] going to a bar right
[1:29:34] it just so happened that it got
[1:29:36] purchased purchased by by a preacher
[1:29:39] you see it but but the shell itself the
[1:29:41] coat
[1:29:42] it could have only gone wherever who was
[1:29:44] wearing it went
[1:29:46] right it wasn't the coat oh the coat
[1:29:48] says
[1:29:49] go into the bar no it was whoever wore
[1:29:51] it took it to the bar
[1:29:53] there you and i the coat our life our
[1:29:56] tabernacle
[1:29:57] our vessel our tent our body remember
[1:30:00] it was the nature within us that caused
[1:30:04] us
[1:30:04] to go certain places do certain things
[1:30:07] no matter how much you try to resist it
[1:30:09] it's the nature within the coal how do i
[1:30:12] do
[1:30:12] do i got to get a different coat no you
[1:30:15] need to get a new man
[1:30:17] inside the coast when you get a new man
[1:30:19] inside the cove
[1:30:21] you don't have to worry about the cult
[1:30:22] going to the bar
[1:30:24] because it's a new man that he don't
[1:30:26] want to go to the bar
[1:30:28] you've got a new man on the inside that
[1:30:30] don't want to have the things of the
[1:30:32] world why
[1:30:33] he is a new man
[1:30:37] but a religious man will say ah
[1:30:40] it don't hurt it's all right look at me
[1:30:44] i'm a good guy this is all right
[1:30:48] everything's fine well don't bother me
[1:30:51] to look at

[1:30:53] can look at women or women are beautiful
[1:30:55] oh look at this right here it don't
[1:30:56] bother me to drink he don't bother me
[1:30:58] looking pornography he don't bother me
[1:30:59] to do this right here
[1:31:00] if it don't there's a problem i said if
[1:31:04] it don't there's a problem
[1:31:06] but there is an antidote i know they're
[1:31:08] looking for a vaccine
[1:31:09] for covid they're looking for treatments
[1:31:11] brother let me tell you something
[1:31:12] the word don't come to bring treatments
[1:31:15] the word comes
[1:31:16] to fascinate you against sin
[1:31:19] we can live in that pastor's office to
[1:31:22] your blue in the face
[1:31:23] and i'm blue in the face it ain't the
[1:31:25] pastor's office
[1:31:26] or counseling that'll change you i'm
[1:31:28] talking about a god
[1:31:30] that's here this morning that can change
[1:31:32] you
[1:31:35] transform your life
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:42] hallelujah
[1:31:45] oh jesus somebody say sweet jesus come
[1:31:50] he's here this is the sweetness of the
[1:31:52] holy spirit
[1:31:57] i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i
[1:32:00] live
[1:32:01] yet not i but christ liveth in me
[1:32:05] and the life which i now live in
[1:32:09] the flesh the life that's in here
[1:32:12] that i'm living in the flesh
[1:32:15] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:32:19] who
[1:32:19] loved me and gave himself
[1:32:23] for me well i thought he paid the debt
[1:32:27] for the sins of the world
[1:32:29] he did but you see this is a personal
[1:32:31] revelation
[1:32:32] right when that revelation becomes
[1:32:35] personal
[1:32:37] not about pastor mama daddy but for you
[1:32:41] then that's when things change
[1:32:45] amen now let's look at this because as
[1:32:48] we were reading
[1:32:49] in ezekiel 36 god had said
[1:32:52] i'll give you a new heart and a new
[1:32:53] spirit i'll take the stony heart
[1:32:55] out of you and i will put my spirit
[1:32:59] within you now we recognize
[1:33:03] he said i'll put my spirit in you i
[1:33:05] cause you to keep my judgments
[1:33:06] uh judgments i'll cause you to keep my
[1:33:08] statutes in other words
[1:33:10] he is saying i will come and live my
[1:33:12] word
[1:33:13] out through you in hebrews 8 10
[1:33:17] this is a covenant that god is speaking
[1:33:19] of he says
[1:33:20] for this is the covenant that i will
[1:33:22] make with the house of israel after
[1:33:23] those days saith the lord
[1:33:25] i will put my laws into their mind now
[1:33:28] remember
[1:33:29] moses went up to the mountain when he
[1:33:32] went up to the mount
[1:33:33] he received the laws of god
[1:33:36] is that right thou shalt not
[1:33:40] and that was glorious glorious
[1:33:43] but remember what the law did the law
[1:33:45] only pointed out you're guilty
[1:33:48] you're guilty you're guilty
[1:33:52] i mean the guys don't pull you on don't
[1:33:53] pull you over here to pull you over and
[1:33:55] tell you what a nice-looking car you got
[1:33:58] they might do that to kind of sweeten
[1:33:59] the deal the ticket they're going to
[1:34:01] give you but
[1:34:01] they pull you over because you have
[1:34:03] broke the law
[1:34:05] now don't look at me funny as soon as
[1:34:07] you pass one down the road you're
[1:34:09] all of a sudden looking in the mirror
[1:34:10] and you know all of a sudden just
[1:34:12] my everything now it's not in a hurry
[1:34:14] anymore let's just settle down
[1:34:16] why because fear takes hold because
[1:34:19] you're thinking
[1:34:20] oh my are they going to have grace or is
[1:34:23] law going to come down on me
[1:34:25] is that right now notice here here comes
[1:34:27] moses
[1:34:28] with the laws now remember where they
[1:34:30] wrote in tables of stone
[1:34:33] but you see as long as they were in
[1:34:34] tables of stone they could never change
[1:34:36] nobody
[1:34:37] but those tables of stone were
[1:34:39] represented if it was only a type
[1:34:41] of where that the word now listen to me
[1:34:43] now where that the word
[1:34:45] would be received moses was god's
[1:34:47] prophet
[1:34:48] here the word would be received but then
[1:34:51] that word when it's received
[1:34:53] there was that where the word was to go
[1:34:55] forth
[1:34:56] to the people to where that that word
[1:34:58] would actually be placed
[1:35:00] into the lives and hearts of the people
[1:35:04] let me keep reading i will put my laws
[1:35:07] into their mind i will write them
[1:35:10] in their hearts and i will be to them a
[1:35:13] god
[1:35:14] and they shall be to me a people notice
[1:35:16] this is the sovereign working of god
[1:35:19] god is putting them in the right place
[1:35:23] and they shall not teach every man his
[1:35:25] neighbor every man his brother saying no
[1:35:26] the lord for all shall
[1:35:28] know me from least to the greatest
[1:35:31] for i will be merciful to their
[1:35:33] unrighteousness
[1:35:34] and their sins and their iniquities will
[1:35:36] i remember no more
[1:35:38] isn't that isn't that wonderful that
[1:35:40] every man shall know the lord from the
[1:35:42] least to the greatest or greatest to the
[1:35:44] least
[1:35:44] it wouldn't matter what the status is
[1:35:46] this is where the spirit of god would
[1:35:48] move
[1:35:48] down upon paul and paul would be able to
[1:35:51] pick this up
[1:35:52] this inspiration and let the gentiles
[1:35:55] know
[1:35:55] that though in a way it was all hidden
[1:35:59] in the old testament but god intended to
[1:36:02] visit you
[1:36:03] god intended to take you as a people
[1:36:06] for for his name sake paul would begin
[1:36:09] to minister
[1:36:10] these things of the truth and he would
[1:36:12] let him know there maketh no difference
[1:36:14] whether jew or gentile
[1:36:15] it'd make them no different circumcised
[1:36:17] or uncircumcised
[1:36:18] paul would even think of it in the same
[1:36:21] church paul would have those
[1:36:23] who was a master and there would be his
[1:36:25] slaves that would be sitting there or
[1:36:28] servants that would be there now when
[1:36:30] you think of slaves and things like that
[1:36:31] you can't think of it in terminology
[1:36:33] to how some of our history has written
[1:36:35] things because even when i go to the
[1:36:36] philippines
[1:36:37] and other places like that even times in
[1:36:39] africa they will have sometimes they
[1:36:41] will have servants
[1:36:41] they're not slaves they're people who
[1:36:43] actually will work in their house
[1:36:45] help keep the house clean and they
[1:36:47] actually help you know provide food
[1:36:48] some of you would call that a maid or
[1:36:50] you would call that you know a cook or
[1:36:51] cleaner or whatever more but you
[1:36:53] understand paul
[1:36:54] would have to by the spirit of god
[1:36:56] express that he that how god has called
[1:36:58] you
[1:36:59] he did not call you because you were a
[1:37:01] master neither did he call you because
[1:37:03] you were a servant
[1:37:04] he lets him know it's god's grace no
[1:37:06] matter what your rank is in society
[1:37:09] whether it's up here or it's down here
[1:37:11] that makes no different to god
[1:37:13] because god does not call you based on
[1:37:16] the ranking you
[1:37:17] are with the world he's calling you out
[1:37:19] of the world
[1:37:20] he's not trying to highlight your
[1:37:22] ethnicity your nationality
[1:37:24] he's not trying to highlight your
[1:37:26] cultural heritage he's not trying to
[1:37:28] highlight your first birth
[1:37:29] what he really wants he wants to
[1:37:31] annihilate or
[1:37:33] kill that first birth that he might
[1:37:36] step inside and you become a new
[1:37:40] creation hallelujah
[1:37:47] oh you don't understand the baggage i've
[1:37:48] got jesus specializes in that
[1:37:50] amen his reputation is made
[1:37:54] on those the prophet said even he said
[1:37:57] you could take a woman that could be so
[1:37:58] foul
[1:37:59] that the dogs won't even hal her name
[1:38:01] but he said you let god take a hold of
[1:38:02] that woman
[1:38:03] you let god come and change that woman's
[1:38:05] life you let god change that man's life
[1:38:08] god will clean that life up by his
[1:38:09] holiness to where holiness sets down
[1:38:12] on the inside that is a paradox the work
[1:38:15] of the holy ghost
[1:38:20] how powerful their sins and iniquities
[1:38:23] will i remember no more
[1:38:27] praise the lord let me just try to wrap
[1:38:29] up on this point is that all right
[1:38:31] we're just trying to wrap up here on on
[1:38:33] these things
[1:38:35] beer sins and iniquities i will remember
[1:38:38] no more now to think of this
[1:38:40] i will be merciful and then we truly we
[1:38:43] need
[1:38:43] and we are so thankful for god who is
[1:38:45] rich in mercy
[1:38:47] because if we got if we got what we
[1:38:48] deserved
[1:38:50] all right
[1:38:53] now you might be able to say well i was
[1:38:54] a goody two shoes you know i
[1:38:56] i knew all the sunday school verses you
[1:38:58] were still a child of wrath
[1:39:00] you needed to be born again memorized in
[1:39:03] scripture it's not the new birth
[1:39:06] knowing the message is not the new birth
[1:39:08] knowing god sent a prophet
[1:39:10] is not the new birth believing it's the
[1:39:12] truth is not the new birth
[1:39:15] but the new birth is where that life has
[1:39:17] come
[1:39:18] in you by the word for that day and you
[1:39:20] are birthed
[1:39:21] into jesus christ where it's no longer
[1:39:24] you trying
[1:39:25] to live a christian life
[1:39:29] christ comes in and lives a christian
[1:39:32] life
[1:39:33] through you amen mercy oh my
[1:39:37] what mercy is given you see let me just
[1:39:39] let me just dwell with this
[1:39:40] very much because this this is a um
[1:39:44] a very tremendous reality on on the
[1:39:47] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:49] because we we recognize of the new birth
[1:39:52] because when you recognize that in so
[1:39:54] much of what is called new birth or
[1:39:57] being born again
[1:39:58] has been so misconstrued when people
[1:40:01] have
[1:40:01] uh you know there's those the churches
[1:40:03] that you know teach well when a person
[1:40:05] confesses
[1:40:06] the lord jesus christ as a savior he is
[1:40:08] saved but the bible says he believeth
[1:40:10] unto
[1:40:11] salvation and paul said that
[1:40:14] that you you heard the gospel of your
[1:40:16] salvation afterwards you were
[1:40:19] sealed not when you heard it and
[1:40:21] believed you were sealed
[1:40:22] after you first had to hear it first had
[1:40:25] to respond it's all a working
[1:40:27] of the holy ghost but you see notice
[1:40:30] this is god listen to me now this is god
[1:40:33] coming in this hour
[1:40:34] this has to be clear because it's got to
[1:40:37] be clear for rapture
[1:40:39] god has ordained you and i to live as
[1:40:41] sons and daughters of god in this hour
[1:40:44] to walk by faith to walk with a faith
[1:40:48] where enoch walked let me just tell you
[1:40:50] to walk with the faith
[1:40:51] that'll stand right in the face of the
[1:40:53] devil and say you're a liar
[1:40:56] stand right in his face and say you
[1:40:58] ain't nothing but a bluff
[1:41:00] come on now what are you talking about
[1:41:02] i'm talking about
[1:41:03] as our husband was a serpent bruiser
[1:41:06] we are anointed to be a serpent bruiser
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:13] let me just say it like this you take a
[1:41:15] man that was bound with drinking
[1:41:17] bound with pornography bound with all
[1:41:19] those things you let god transform that
[1:41:21] man's life
[1:41:22] i tell you right now there'll be a
[1:41:23] witness coming out of that man's life or
[1:41:25] you let somebody's been a church member
[1:41:27] they've sat in a church for year after
[1:41:29] year you let god energize that life that
[1:41:32] person will be a witness
[1:41:33] of a living god and they'll be there to
[1:41:36] encourage the others
[1:41:37] brother he did it for me he'll do it for
[1:41:39] you
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:42] you let god take a hold of that life why
[1:41:45] they'll be witnesses
[1:41:46] unto him by what power the power of the
[1:41:49] holy ghost
[1:41:52] that put you into service
[1:42:10] what are you doing well i got some more
[1:42:12] steak on this plate
[1:42:13] just trying to
[1:42:20] this is the mystery
[1:42:25] that part we just wrote and wrote it
[1:42:26] right here in the beginning there was a
[1:42:28] part of you that was dead
[1:42:30] that was that seed of god
[1:42:33] a desire to serve god right knowing that
[1:42:36] there is a god
[1:42:38] knowing that there's got to be more
[1:42:40] there's a seed
[1:42:42] but it was dead like the seed you go to
[1:42:45] plant your corn tomatoes
[1:42:47] marigolds on and on and on it's dead
[1:42:49] right
[1:42:50] is that right now there has to come
[1:42:54] a certain water or water that's able
[1:42:58] to when water comes up on the sea
[1:43:01] probably i'm probably not speaking to
[1:43:02] people you know this you take seeds
[1:43:05] and they are hard i don't care if
[1:43:07] they're a little lettuce
[1:43:09] seed looks like a you know it just looks
[1:43:10] like a i don't know
[1:43:13] it's just a you know a little little
[1:43:15] something it's hard
[1:43:17] it's hard you know what you have to do
[1:43:20] you bury it
[1:43:22] and when you bury it you water it what
[1:43:25] does the watering do
[1:43:26] the dirt that that seed is encased in it
[1:43:30] takes that water
[1:43:31] and what the water does is it begins to
[1:43:35] soften
[1:43:36] the hardness that's in that seed
[1:43:40] because there's a germ on the inside of
[1:43:43] it
[1:43:43] but it needs to be delivered of the
[1:43:46] hardness
[1:43:48] so the water comes to break down that
[1:43:51] hardness
[1:43:52] that's why there is the preaching of the
[1:43:54] word
[1:43:55] this is why jesus said except the man be
[1:43:57] born of the water
[1:44:00] and of the spirit the water is the word
[1:44:03] the preaching of the word makes you
[1:44:05] aware it brings conviction
[1:44:07] because the spirit travels through the
[1:44:09] world
[1:44:10] is that right you must be born of the
[1:44:13] water and of the spirit
[1:44:15] it listen it takes two that it takes two
[1:44:17] to have a birth
[1:44:20] i mean my wife didn't have those
[1:44:21] children on her own right
[1:44:25] those guys they look like me sorry about
[1:44:27] that
[1:44:28] some act like me sorry about that
[1:44:34] it took two come on now
[1:44:37] it takes two you have the seed of god on
[1:44:40] the inside of you but you need the
[1:44:42] quickening power
[1:44:43] to come and raise that up
[1:44:46] is that right it takes the father and
[1:44:48] the mother
[1:44:50] it takes here the father is the word the
[1:44:52] spirit we are born of that new jerusalem
[1:44:54] who is mother of us all
[1:44:56] the spirit of god coming down with that
[1:44:58] word to deliver birth
[1:45:00] to deliver sons and daughters of god to
[1:45:02] deliver word birth
[1:45:04] outside of the word and it's just spirit
[1:45:06] it could produce false births
[1:45:09] false sensations false evidences come on
[1:45:14] somebody
[1:45:16] is why god sent sends his word this is
[1:45:18] why we must be born
[1:45:20] of the water and of the spirit
[1:45:24] everybody okay i know you're getting
[1:45:27] nervous you're saying
[1:45:28] i say i'm coming down that last point
[1:45:29] but i i don't want to fly through it
[1:45:32] right right that seed was dead
[1:45:37] when god dealt with your heart and you
[1:45:39] repented
[1:45:40] listen to me you were not repenting
[1:45:43] for the seed that was dead inside of you
[1:45:47] that was the potential son and daughter
[1:45:50] of god
[1:45:52] how can something that's dead commit
[1:45:55] sin the seed the seed of god
[1:45:59] the son and daughter of god on the
[1:46:01] inside
[1:46:02] when you were sitting on the bar still
[1:46:04] drinking it wasn't the seed of god
[1:46:06] that was their drinking
[1:46:09] but neither could you be recognized as a
[1:46:11] son or daughter of god
[1:46:13] in that condition but there had to come
[1:46:16] a call
[1:46:17] like it did to the prodigal what's he
[1:46:19] calling to
[1:46:20] he's calling to the sea that's on the
[1:46:24] inside
[1:46:28] talking about receiving a signal as it's
[1:46:30] moving through the building
[1:46:32] what is it that receives the signal it's
[1:46:34] the seed of god on the inside
[1:46:37] flesh profiteth nothing
[1:46:41] the flesh will say i get tired man when
[1:46:43] just gotta hurry up man
[1:46:44] just gotta go here but the inside man
[1:46:48] says
[1:46:49] keep it coming jesus
[1:46:52] see the inside man says it like this
[1:46:54] inside man does not look at it and say
[1:46:56] oh yeah you already passed that
[1:46:58] checkpoint oh yeah i did that it's not
[1:46:59] that's not what a spirit filled believer
[1:47:01] does
[1:47:02] it takes god's word and they keep on the
[1:47:04] roots keep on growing deeper
[1:47:05] and becoming more established let me
[1:47:07] just tell you something these words that
[1:47:09] god is speaking right here
[1:47:10] in these services is not just trying to
[1:47:13] lead people in the path of life
[1:47:15] and to show people that path into
[1:47:17] sonship it's much
[1:47:18] deeper than that even it's to bring you
[1:47:20] and i who have even crossed into that
[1:47:22] place that your faith
[1:47:24] might even be firmly more established
[1:47:28] when i repented you repented i did not
[1:47:31] repent for what a son of god did
[1:47:33] or a daughter of god the seed was dead
[1:47:36] we were dead
[1:47:37] in sin and trespasses
[1:47:41] are you with me but now when the
[1:47:43] quickening power
[1:47:45] comes it comes to raise
[1:47:48] up that seed
[1:47:51] that was planted there that was god knew
[1:47:55] from his mind that which was in
[1:47:59] god and when you drop
[1:48:02] from your mother's womb and you took
[1:48:05] that breath of life
[1:48:06] that seed was already there in you
[1:48:10] that's why you couldn't fit in
[1:48:14] this is why oh you don't know all the
[1:48:16] darkness you don't know all this
[1:48:18] a lot of darkness a lot of things
[1:48:21] but remember the seed is what he's
[1:48:24] coming for
[1:48:26] as soon as that seed is quickened it's
[1:48:28] over
[1:48:30] i said it's over sealed
[1:48:33] to the day of your destination
[1:48:38] it's over you now have a different man
[1:48:43] inside the coat
[1:48:47] a different man inside the coat you see
[1:48:51] this is where within this this is why
[1:48:54] brother brown would take this example
[1:48:56] and you've heard this many times
[1:48:58] but he would talk about in the message
[1:49:00] rapture he also speak of this an
[1:49:01] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:49:03] and see this is where he says let's just
[1:49:06] say for example
[1:49:08] and brother i was dealing with the fact
[1:49:09] he said i've always preached
[1:49:11] that jesus he was deity it was not just
[1:49:15] a man
[1:49:16] it was god condescending god
[1:49:19] coming in flesh
[1:49:22] then we look at our lives and to see
[1:49:27] that within our lives brother branham
[1:49:29] would say the bride is not just
[1:49:31] washed she's not just forgiven
[1:49:34] she's justified and then he takes the
[1:49:37] little story
[1:49:38] of where brother greene could come to
[1:49:40] him and brother
[1:49:42] greene you know uh maybe had heard that
[1:49:45] brother
[1:49:45] says had heard that i had been drinking
[1:49:47] and and doing all sorts of things
[1:49:49] and then when he come to me and brother
[1:49:51] green said brother brown am i heard
[1:49:52] you were drinking and brother brown said
[1:49:55] not me
[1:49:56] all right what you heard was wrong
[1:49:59] i hadn't been drinking see he never did
[1:50:03] it accusation had come his way
[1:50:06] but he never did it right
[1:50:10] now watch out brother and goes you
[1:50:12] forgive me
[1:50:14] i didn't do it what are you forgiving me
[1:50:17] about but if i'm guilty now listen to me
[1:50:19] if i'm guilty i can be forgiven
[1:50:22] but i'm still not just because i did it
[1:50:27] but you see when the blood of jesus
[1:50:29] christ is
[1:50:30] come it cleanses us from sin
[1:50:34] till it's put in the book of god's
[1:50:36] forgetfulness he's the only one can do
[1:50:39] that
[1:50:41] i feel sorry for them guys that go sat
[1:50:42] in the booth and talked to talk to
[1:50:44] another center on the other side
[1:50:47] some of them guys i'll tell you what's
[1:50:49] the truth or vile and everything else
[1:50:51] and talk to him a man can't save you a
[1:50:53] man can't take blood for you
[1:50:57] amen come on somebody
[1:51:00] that's only a copycat there's a real
[1:51:02] mediator
[1:51:03] there's only one mediator between god
[1:51:05] and man and that's the man christ jesus
[1:51:08] there's only one man he won't just
[1:51:10] forgive you
[1:51:11] he'll take the very nature that made you
[1:51:14] do it in the first place
[1:51:18] that's greater than forgiveness thank
[1:51:20] god for forgiveness
[1:51:21] but we're talking about being justified
[1:51:24] how can we be justified
[1:51:25] when that new man that new woman on the
[1:51:28] inside
[1:51:29] is raised up by the power of god you
[1:51:31] might have all these things in your
[1:51:33] memory
[1:51:33] and the devil try to haunt you and point
[1:51:36] things out in your memory
[1:51:37] but remember when the quickening power
[1:51:39] has come
[1:51:40] and has raised up that seed it's a new
[1:51:42] life brother
[1:51:43] it's a new creation you and listen there
[1:51:46] you stand justified
[1:51:48] you never did it
[1:51:54] though dwelling in this body this body
[1:51:56] held certain things clicked on certain
[1:51:58] things
[1:51:58] did certain things but yet remember this
[1:52:00] body was moved remember
[1:52:02] this body was moved by the life that was
[1:52:05] in it
[1:52:06] but soon as you get somebody different
[1:52:08] inside of here
[1:52:12] hallelujah this suit might have been
[1:52:15] worn by a politician
[1:52:16] now it's too cheap
[1:52:22] right it could have made all sorts of
[1:52:25] promises and done all sorts of things
[1:52:27] but you see it's not the suit it's who's
[1:52:30] in it
[1:52:31] it's who's in it
[1:52:42] you know oftentimes we have baby
[1:52:43] dedications and
[1:52:45] those are wonderful times i know my my
[1:52:48] wife really likes those times
[1:52:51] and we all we rejoice right but you
[1:52:54] realize when that baby comes
[1:52:55] it's innocent right innocent
[1:53:00] and you think my goodness it's so
[1:53:01] innocent
[1:53:03] but do you realize that graham said when
[1:53:05] you've been born again
[1:53:07] you're actually more innocent than that
[1:53:09] child is
[1:53:12] how can that be because you were once
[1:53:15] dead
[1:53:16] yes the sins that were committed in this
[1:53:19] body
[1:53:20] there was another life that was in there
[1:53:24] and there had to come forth a
[1:53:26] crucifixion
[1:53:28] a death that that one who was dead
[1:53:32] might become alive
[1:53:37] where it comes to a place where it's
[1:53:40] it's a love affair
[1:53:41] it's no longer you or me
[1:53:44] it's no longer as paul said i that
[1:53:47] liveth
[1:53:48] but it's christ who liveth
[1:53:51] in me see when this has come you don't
[1:53:55] have to look over your back
[1:53:57] you don't have to look at who's around
[1:53:59] right
[1:54:00] you don't have to wonder because you're
[1:54:02] not putting nothing on
[1:54:04] you're not acting you're not
[1:54:06] impersonating
[1:54:09] it's genuine from the inside
[1:54:12] amen no longer i who liveth
[1:54:15] but christ who liveth in me
[1:54:18] oh my see now it's his life that's
[1:54:21] operating through that seed word
[1:54:24] that's producing just exactly what he
[1:54:27] himself
[1:54:28] had called for i'm going to stop right
[1:54:30] here
[1:54:32] i'm just going to stop here this morning
[1:54:36] but i believe with all my heart
[1:54:41] i believe with all my heart
[1:54:45] that it's god's desire to sovereignly
[1:54:49] work in our lives in our hearts
[1:54:56] and if there is something there in your
[1:54:58] life
[1:55:00] if this today no matter where where
[1:55:02] you're at you might be a person
[1:55:05] and you might have said man i wonder why
[1:55:08] my life was always up and down
[1:55:10] in and out
[1:55:13] i couldn't get much further because than
[1:55:16] this today
[1:55:17] but you realize friends we're not just
[1:55:19] talking about living a good life
[1:55:23] people can live a good life and there's
[1:55:25] a big difference between being a
[1:55:26] christian
[1:55:27] and a spirit-filled christian
[1:55:31] big difference a new heart and a new
[1:55:34] spirit a wonderful thing
[1:55:37] but you don't want to stop there
[1:55:41] you take the word and you apply the word
[1:55:45] in your life it wouldn't do you
[1:55:48] listen i can lay my hands on you and i
[1:55:51] believe with all my heart
[1:55:52] that quickening power a portion of that
[1:55:54] that god has allotted to me
[1:55:56] it works in my life but i want you to
[1:55:59] understand
[1:56:00] i can't make nobody live a victorious
[1:56:03] life
[1:56:05] you could come live in my house you
[1:56:07] being around me
[1:56:08] is not going to make you live a
[1:56:09] victorious life
[1:56:12] you understand what i'm saying right
[1:56:14] here's the real miracle of it
[1:56:17] if you were to take you were to take a
[1:56:20] pig i take a pig
[1:56:21] and i bring the pig into my house
[1:56:24] that pig is gonna eventually it might
[1:56:27] like some of the scraps i give it
[1:56:30] you might like some of the food it might
[1:56:32] be
[1:56:33] you know everything else around for a
[1:56:34] little while
[1:56:37] the thing about it is it still has a
[1:56:39] desire and a nature on the inside
[1:56:42] i could put a bow tie on it i could
[1:56:45] bathe it in buttermilk man i could make
[1:56:48] it a shiny
[1:56:49] nice guy and man i could really clean
[1:56:52] him
[1:56:52] up and
[1:56:56] but he's still a pig right in his nature
[1:57:03] are you with me
[1:57:08] the first chance i get up in that patio
[1:57:09] door and that screen
[1:57:13] he puts that nose on that screen
[1:57:17] he starts watching my movements
[1:57:22] i know he goes to open that door at
[1:57:24] eight in the morning
[1:57:25] tomorrow morning i'm getting out why
[1:57:29] there's things out there that still have
[1:57:32] a pool
[1:57:36] still have a pull well what has to
[1:57:39] happen
[1:57:41] if we can get to that nature on the
[1:57:43] inside
[1:57:45] and you take out of that nature a pig
[1:57:49] now you look at the outside and say oh
[1:57:50] that's a pig
[1:57:51] i mean that's how we do from from little
[1:57:52] kids we look at something oh that's a
[1:57:54] pig you know we have those things
[1:57:57] p.i.g pig and we learn to identify
[1:58:00] something by the outside
[1:58:03] but there are characteristics that we
[1:58:04] know about a pig
[1:58:06] is that right we know kids like mud and
[1:58:08] pigs like this and pigs like that
[1:58:10] characteristics what are those
[1:58:12] characteristics those
[1:58:14] are attributes of its nature
[1:58:19] if you can get to the inside of that pig
[1:58:23] and you can bring a change of its nature
[1:58:26] in other words
[1:58:27] take that nature out of a pig
[1:58:30] and put the nature of a sheep on the
[1:58:32] inside
[1:58:34] somebody look at me like what are you
[1:58:36] talking about
[1:58:38] it's a simple expression of the new
[1:58:40] birth
[1:58:41] god taking that nature of a pig that
[1:58:44] lights
[1:58:45] the world the mud and everything else

[2:01:33] things in your life
[2:01:34] how can that compare to the power of
[2:01:37] almighty god
[2:01:39] amen we're not talking about you licking
[2:01:41] your spots and you becoming a better
[2:01:43] person
[2:01:43] we're talking about the power of god
[2:01:45] coming and transforming
[2:01:50] we're not even talking about when here
[2:01:52] you recognize when god has moved
[2:01:54] into our heart and that transformation
[2:01:57] has come
[2:01:58] we are resting in his
[2:02:01] working we're yielding to his word
[2:02:05] his word is what's pulsating in our life
[2:02:08] it's not me it's christ
[2:02:13] let's pray
[2:02:16] heavenly father
[2:02:19] lord jesus you know every need
[2:02:23] lord that's here before us your god when
[2:02:26] the word
[2:02:28] is spoken as you deliver it then lord
[2:02:31] your spirit
[2:02:32] comes to move lord god
[2:02:36] in behind that word and to perform
[2:02:39] what lord you have called for now lord i
[2:02:42] ask
[2:02:43] your god not only for hearts
[2:02:48] and lives that are gathered here those
[2:02:50] that lord are
[2:02:51] streaming or will archive this service
[2:02:55] lord god i ask lord jesus
[2:03:00] but lord may you just deal so personally
[2:03:04] with every heart
[2:03:07] and i pray god that lord
[2:03:11] fear that would try to take a hold
[2:03:14] may it be driven back lord doubt and
[2:03:18] unbelief
[2:03:19] may it be driven back lord in the name
[2:03:21] of jesus christ
[2:03:24] may o god their eyes not be upon
[2:03:27] themselves but may
[2:03:28] their eyes be focused upon you
[2:03:31] and lord if they've walked with a new
[2:03:33] heart and a new spirit
[2:03:35] that's a wonderful thing lord but god
[2:03:39] as they recognize like if they would go
[2:03:42] to a doctor
[2:03:44] and a doctor they would let the doctor
[2:03:45] know i'm having this pain or
[2:03:48] i'm having this condition or this is
[2:03:50] bothering me at night or this
[2:03:52] the doctor will pull
[2:03:56] from his knowledge
[2:03:59] of symptoms that
[2:04:02] are known by the person
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:07] and then he once the diagnosis is made
[2:04:11] he will make a prognosis
[2:04:15] he will tell them things either to do or
[2:04:16] to avoid
[2:04:18] even to write a prescription
[2:04:21] and that is to address
[2:04:26] why it is the need and why they're there
[2:04:30] now lord the new heart and new spirit in
[2:04:33] the removing of that stony heart
[2:04:35] that's a sovereign work of you lord
[2:04:39] that you're working in that life
[2:04:43] so we don't we don't despise that we
[2:04:46] know that you're working
[2:04:47] it takes you to take a heart that would
[2:04:49] be so cold so hard so indifferent
[2:04:52] towards the word of god and it takes the
[2:04:55] warming rays
[2:04:57] to begin to move on that life and begin
[2:04:58] to turn it to where it begins to be
[2:05:01] open to the things of god
[2:05:05] it takes you lord god to come around and
[2:05:08] set a mind in order for holiness
[2:05:11] where they begin to think in holiness
[2:05:14] lord
[2:05:16] beginning lord to apply that faith and
[2:05:18] laying things down
[2:05:20] it takes you lord coming and moving in
[2:05:23] that life
[2:05:24] because you're the object you're the
[2:05:26] object lord you're the reason
[2:05:29] you're the reason that a heart or life
[2:05:31] would repent
[2:05:33] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[2:05:34] jesus christ the lord
[2:05:36] you're the reason it's you they want to
[2:05:39] be united with you
[2:05:41] [Music]

[2:19:59] sister rebecca you know god had been
[2:20:01] dealing with her heart for
[2:20:03] well since back in in january but even
[2:20:07] right here in in one of the services i
[2:20:09] noticed where she
[2:20:10] really had made a stand for god well
[2:20:14] at that still at that point she hadn't
[2:20:17] spoke
[2:20:17] anything about being baptized in the
[2:20:19] name of the lord jesus christ yet she
[2:20:21] had
[2:20:21] god had already been dealing with her
[2:20:23] heart and it was uh two weeks ago i
[2:20:26] think it was this
[2:20:26] this coming monday his uh i was out
[2:20:30] walking and

[2:20:33] music but one the message

[2:26:17] dealing with hearts and lives it don't
[2:26:19] matter what age you are
[2:26:21] when god deals with your heart all it
[2:26:24] takes is some
[2:26:25] simple obedience to his voice
[2:26:29] and you know um probably i could have my
[2:26:33] mom come over here and give the
[2:26:34] testimony more than i could but
[2:26:36] you know zachary a lot of times since my
[2:26:38] dad had passed away
[2:26:39] he'll go and you know spend time with
[2:26:41] with uh with my mom and
[2:26:43] times at different times back and back
[2:26:45] and forth you know
[2:26:46] keeping her company as well and well you
[2:26:49] know he's he's heard
[2:26:50] the preaching he's we've talked at
[2:26:52] different times but
[2:26:54] he happened to be down there the one
[2:26:55] time with his
[2:26:57] his mammal and they were reading the
[2:26:58] bible in the morning and
[2:27:00] they began to talk about water baptism
[2:27:02] that was on his heart
[2:27:04] and um began to talk about that he had
[2:27:06] already given his life to the lord
[2:27:08] and um then at that point in time it
[2:27:10] really really began to
[2:27:12] dealing to take a further step to really
[2:27:14] you know because that's tied together
[2:27:16] repentance
[2:27:17] and baptism in the name of the lord
[2:27:19] jesus christ
[2:27:20] and so after this past thursday service
[2:27:23] i walked in the back room and i
[2:27:25] i didn't see the note but my wife found
[2:27:27] the note and she brought it over to me
[2:27:29] and uh on on the note he said i want to
[2:27:32] be
[2:27:33] baptized too and you know
[2:27:38] i know that that it's not it's something
[2:27:40] that god has to do the work
[2:27:42] in a life you know it don't matter how
[2:27:44] much as parents parents we want to see
[2:27:46] god working our children
[2:27:47] but we can't make our children
[2:27:49] christians we can't make our children
[2:27:51] serve god
[2:27:52] but i'm glad that god's put something
[2:27:54] greater on the inside of us
[2:27:56] where he changed us and then we've got
[2:27:58] confidence that the same god
[2:28:00] who got a hold of our life he's the same
[2:28:02] god for their life
[2:28:04] and that's where our confidence is in
[2:28:06] the working of the word in our own life
[2:28:08] so we just want to pray for him we want
[2:28:11] to lift him up prepare and ask
