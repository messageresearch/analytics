[25:47] harm. Cuz he walked through [music] my
[25:49] store. He came looking for me.
[25:54] Oh, glory. [music] He came looking for
[25:57] [singing] me.
[26:01] He came looking for me.
[26:03] [music and singing]
[26:04] Oh, hallelujah.
[26:07] He made a way.
[26:10] There was [music] a way
[26:12] that I could see. [music and singing]
[26:17] I drifted so far.
[26:21] Jesus was near.
[26:23] Rescue my soul.
[26:26] Calm all my fears. [music] I'm safe from
[26:29] all harm.

[26:56] that I could see.
[27:01] I drifted [music] so far.
[27:04] Jesus [singing] was near.
[27:07] Rescue [music] my soul
[27:10] from all my fears. Now I'm safe from all
[27:14] harm. Because I met the one who came
[27:18] looking for me.
[27:21] Now I'm safe from all harm cuz I've met
[27:26] [music] the one who came looking for me.
[27:30] [music]
[27:36] Amen. Hallelujah. As brother Samuel
[27:38] comes this morning introduce the
[27:40] brother. Amen. Let's sing that. All I
[27:41] want to do is love him.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help me Jesus. Let me say that
[27:45] when you see all that he's done for you,
[27:47] how much he loves you. Lord, just help
[27:48] me love you more. Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:52] All I want to do is love him.
[27:59] So glad I feel his [singing] love for
[28:03] me. [music]
[28:07] Jesus paid the [singing] price of
[28:10] redemption
[28:14] on the cross of Calary. [singing]
[28:21] So [music and singing] every day my
[28:23] heart
[28:25] will praise [music and singing] him.
[28:27] Why? Cuz I know I'll never
[28:30] [music and singing] be the same.
[28:36] All I want to [music and singing] do
[28:39] is love. That's right. Love his
[28:43] [music and singing]
[28:44] holy
[28:47] name.
[28:49] Yes, Lord. All I [singing] want to do
[28:54] is love [music] him.
[28:57] Oh, I'm so glad I feel his blood for
[29:01] [singing and music]
[29:02] me.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus paid the price [singing] of
[29:09] redemption
[29:12] &gt;&gt; on [music]
[29:13] the cross of Calary.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:18] &gt;&gt; And so [singing]
[29:20] every day my [music] heart
[29:23] will praise him. [singing]
[29:26] &gt;&gt; For I know I'll never be [music]
[29:30] the same. [singing]
[29:34] And all I want to do [music]
[29:37] is [singing] love him. Love his
[29:42] holy [singing]
[29:45] name.
[29:49] Praise the Lord.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it [music] is to serve
[29:52] the Lord.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to know that, Amen. It's not
[29:57] our own strength.
[29:59] Sometimes it [music] feels like our
[30:01] strength when we have to push a little
[30:04] bit, but that's actually yielding. And
[30:07] there's always many times there's
[30:09] barriers and that barrier is self. But
[30:12] yet God that what what actually brings
[30:15] us beyond that is the love of God and
[30:18] just to all just to always keeping
[30:21] before us who he is what he's done for
[30:24] us and what he's done for us my we can
[30:27] never truly praise him enough. Amen.
[30:30] that when he has broke the very yoke of
[30:33] bondage around our lives for the grace
[30:36] that he's he's ministered to us for the
[30:38] areas that he's touched and my just so
[30:41] brought such repair and restoration.
[30:45] There's no one like Jesus.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; His love and his care is so deep. It's
[30:49] beyond what even a writer could pin
[30:51] down. It's beyond what we can even
[30:54] imagine. Amen. But it's real. It takes a
[30:57] hold of us. And I'm glad we can't
[30:58] explain it. I'm glad that there's a loss
[31:00] of words within that, but it's something
[31:03] that you know that you've experienced.
[31:06] Amen. And so we just we thank God for
[31:09] his mercy. Amen. Here this morning,
[31:12] amen. So good to have each [music] and
[31:13] everyone here with us. And um we want to
[31:17] just uh continue remember um Brother
[31:19] Brian and the family in prayer. And um
[31:21] we'll try to get all the details out
[31:23] about um there's a memorial service, I'm
[31:26] assuming.
[31:28] Yes and no. Maybe. Okay. So, just be
[31:32] looking for that on the the thread if
[31:34] there's any details from brother Brian
[31:36] or we'll get those out on the text
[31:38] thread and also try to copy that out to
[31:41] the email as well. And um just want to
[31:44] also thank the Lord, you know, the
[31:46] request that went out about uh Sister
[31:49] Raina on Thursday and you know, we
[31:51] didn't know when they had to take her
[31:53] back to the emergency room whether or
[31:55] not that there was a brain bleed from
[31:56] her falling on the ice. Ended up being a
[31:59] concussion instead. And um so we're
[32:03] thankful to God's mercy.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the fall that she took with
[32:07] the vertebraes and things like that
[32:08] could have been a whole lot worse. Uh
[32:10] but we thank God for his mercy. Amen.
[32:13] And so we just want to continue to
[32:14] remember her in prayer and different
[32:15] ones among us. And we want to welcome
[32:18] brother Josh Martin. Brother Josh has
[32:20] been here with us before. He and his
[32:22] wife, Sister Loretta. And we're so glad
[32:24] that um they would make time and be able
[32:27] to be here with us this morning. We just
[32:29] want to pull on the gift of God. Uh God
[32:32] knows what our needs are and uh we just
[32:35] ask that the Lord will just just come in
[32:37] a special way. Say, Lord, I just like
[32:40] the song said, "Here's my cup. I lift it
[32:43] up, Lord. I I lift I lift my life. I
[32:46] lift my heart. Lord, come and fill it,
[32:48] Lord. Come and speak to my heart, Lord.
[32:50] You know my needs." You know, if you
[32:52] think about when Moses was there before
[32:55] the burning bush. Brother Ram says this
[32:57] over and over, but how to me how true it
[33:00] is.
[33:01] In less than five minutes, God did more
[33:05] for Moses
[33:06] &gt;&gt; than what 40 years
[33:09] &gt;&gt; of schooling could ever do.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; He knew about the promise. The prophet
[33:14] said he was born with the equipment in
[33:17] him. He had complete he had a lot of he
[33:21] had understanding regarding
[33:24] that of what God was looking to do in
[33:27] that day. But he needed
[33:30] that to be quickened within him. He
[33:33] needed that revelation. And you know,
[33:35] God knows what he's called each of us to
[33:37] do. Even God knows the questions and
[33:40] what we have on our hearts. [music] Just
[33:42] a moment in his presence. Just one
[33:44] moment. We can just say, "Lord, just
[33:46] just a few words, Lord. Just just help
[33:48] me to get [music] bowed into that point
[33:50] because it might just be a sentence that
[33:52] God would have for you [music]
[33:54] this morning, but just a few words.
[33:57] Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just if we could, let's just
[34:01] stand and let's invite brother Josh and
[34:04] Amen. Once again, so happy to have he
[34:06] and sister Loretta here with us. And um
[34:10] let's sing that song. Fill my cup, Lord.
[34:14] Fill my cup.
[34:17] Fill my cup,
[34:21] Lord.
[34:24] I lift it [singing]
[34:27] up,
[34:29] Lord.
[34:32] Come [singing] and quench
[34:38] this thirsting [singing]
[34:41] of my [music] soul.
[34:48] Bread [singing]
[34:50] [music] of heaven,
[34:54] feed
[34:56] [singing and music] me, Jes.
[34:58] I want
[35:00] no
[35:02] more.
[35:04] Here's my cup.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup, Lord.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Fill it up.
[35:11] [singing]
[35:14] Oh,
[35:17] let's just sing [music] it once again.
[35:21] My cup,
[35:24] Lord,
[35:26] I lift
[35:29] it [music] up.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; I surrender, Lord.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; I yield to you, Lord.
[35:36] Come and finish
[35:39] this thirsting [singing and music]
[35:45] of my soul
[35:52] &gt;&gt; and heaven [singing]
[35:55] [music] feed
[35:57] me till
[36:00] I want
[36:02] no [singing]
[36:04] for
[36:06] here's my cup.
[36:10] Fill it up
[36:13] and make [singing]
[36:15] Can we sing that one more time now?
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, fill my cup,
[36:25] Lord. [singing]
[36:29] I lift [singing] it up,
[36:33] Lord.
[36:37] Come and quench [singing]
[36:40] [music]
[36:42] this thirsting
[36:45] of [singing]
[36:46] my soul.
[36:52] Oh bread
[36:54] of heaven,
[36:57] [singing and music]
[36:59] feed me till I want
[37:05] no [singing]
[37:06] more.
[37:09] Here's [music] my cup.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Fill it up
[37:16] and make [singing] me whole.
[37:23] Amen. I trust that's your desire this
[37:25] morning. Lord, here's my cup. I'm going
[37:28] to empty it out so that you can fill it
[37:31] up. You know, brother Brandon would say,
[37:33] many people wants Christ to be their
[37:36] savior, but not their Lord. But I say,
[37:38] Lord, I'm emptying myself out so that
[37:40] you can have rulership over every aspect
[37:43] of my life, of my home, [music] of my my
[37:46] decisions, my future, whatever it may
[37:49] be. I'm emptying out myself so that I
[37:52] can follow your leadership and and I
[37:54] trust that's that's why we're gathered
[37:56] here today is not just to show off our
[37:59] our nice clothes or just to show brother
[38:02] Samuel we're not backslid but I believe
[38:04] if we've come together to draw closer to
[38:07] the Lord and I trust if if if that's
[38:09] your desire I know if that's your desire
[38:12] God will meet that need and meet that
[38:14] expectation and and we can leave this
[38:17] place with a a bigger eye or more of a
[38:20] revelation of who he is. And and I
[38:23] believe that our God is an ontime God.
[38:25] And whatever you your need may be this
[38:27] morning, he is still answering the
[38:30] prayers and the and the desires of the
[38:32] heart. Amen. But it's good to be with
[38:34] you here today. I count it's an honor
[38:36] and a privilege to be here. I pray
[38:39] something can be said today to be a
[38:40] blessing and and to strengthen your
[38:43] faith in some way. But if you would have
[38:45] your scriptures, let's let's open our
[38:47] Bibles to John 14 and5.
[38:50] Have a lengthy passage of scripture.
[38:53] But I pray it's okay if we if we take a
[38:56] few moments and read it. It's good to
[38:59] have my family with me. Uh my wife
[39:01] Loretta and my my three kiddos, Ethan,
[39:04] Brielle, and and Oliver. Uh our Oliver
[39:08] is a I think seven weeks old now. So we
[39:11] we have a newborn. And so it's the
[39:14] Lord's Lord's blessed us and this is
[39:16] their first time away from home and
[39:19] their first trip. And so he's he's doing
[39:21] good so far. So we pray that that the
[39:24] Lord continues to to bless us with a
[39:26] good traveler. The other two have been
[39:28] great. You know, we we're on the road a
[39:30] lot. So we thank the Lord for for
[39:33] blessing us with that. But it's it's
[39:35] good to have them with me here today.
[39:37] Bring greetings from our home church,
[39:39] Brother Wendle Martin and the saints
[39:40] there, New Life Outreach. They send
[39:42] their greetings. Amen. But John 14:55,
[39:46] Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not
[39:49] whether thou goest, and how can we know
[39:51] the way? And Jesus saith unto him, I am
[39:54] the way, the truth, and the life. No man
[39:58] cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye
[40:02] had known me, you should have known my
[40:04] father also. And from henceforth ye know
[40:07] him, and have seen him. Philip saith
[40:10] unto him,"Lord, show us the Father, and
[40:12] it sufficeth us." Jesus saith unto him,
[40:15] "Have I been so long time with you, and
[40:18] yet hast thou not known me, Philillip?
[40:20] He that hath seen me hath seen the
[40:22] Father. And how sayest thou then, show
[40:25] us the Father? Believest thou not that
[40:27] I'm in the Father, the Father in me. And
[40:30] the words that I speak unto you, I speak
[40:33] not of myself, but the Father that
[40:35] dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
[40:38] Believe me that I am in the Father, the
[40:40] Father in me. Or else believe me. For
[40:42] the very works sake, verily, verily, I
[40:45] say unto you, he that believeth on me,
[40:47] the works that I do, he shall do also.
[40:50] And greater works than these shall he
[40:53] do, because I go unto my Father.
[40:56] Whatsoever you shall ask in my name,
[40:58] that will I do, that the Father may be
[41:00] glorified in the Son. And if you ask
[41:03] anything in my name, I will do it. If
[41:06] you love me, keep my commandments, and I
[41:08] will pray the Father, and he shall give
[41:10] you another comforter, that he may abide
[41:13] with you forever, even the Spirit of
[41:15] truth, whom the world cannot receive,
[41:18] because it seeth him not, neither
[41:20] knoweth him, but ye know him. For he
[41:23] dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
[41:26] I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[41:28] come to you. Yet a little while the
[41:30] world seeth me no more, but ye see me,
[41:33] because I live, ye shall live also. At
[41:36] that day you shall know that I am in the
[41:38] Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He
[41:41] that hath my commandments, and keepeth
[41:43] them, he it is that loveth me. And he
[41:46] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[41:48] father, and I will love him, and will
[41:50] manifest myself to him. And Judas saith
[41:54] unto him, not a scariot, Lord, how is it
[41:57] that thou will manifest thyself unto us,
[41:59] and not unto the world? And Jesus
[42:02] answered him, and said unto him, If a
[42:04] man love me, he will keep my words, and
[42:06] my father will love him, and will come
[42:09] unto him, and make her abode with him.
[42:12] Amen. Can we bow our heads this morning?
[42:14] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[42:17] what an honor it is to come into your
[42:19] your house, Father. Lord, may we never
[42:21] take this lightly or for granted, Lord,
[42:24] that we have a place where we can come
[42:26] and hear hear words of life, Father,
[42:28] that can strengthen and encourage, Lord.
[42:31] God, as we come into this place today,
[42:33] Lord, we're a needy people, and we're
[42:36] nothing without you, Lord. We ask that
[42:38] you would just have your perfect way
[42:40] here among us, Father. You know the
[42:42] hearts and the desires of your people. I
[42:45] ask that your word, may it strike the
[42:47] target, Lord. May it answer prayers,
[42:49] Father. May it may it come forth with an
[42:52] anointing. Father, Lord, we commit
[42:54] ourselves and the service into your
[42:56] hands in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:00] God bless you. You may be seated. And I
[43:03] just have a simple thought this morning,
[43:05] but it would be a people for his name.
[43:07] Man, and brother Brandham would say,
[43:09] notice what harmony Jesus never did
[43:12] anything until seeing of the father or
[43:15] the father showed him first. harmony
[43:18] between God and Christ. See John 5:19.
[43:22] So will the bride and he shows her his
[43:25] word of life. He shows her and she
[43:27] receives it. She never doubts it.
[43:29] Nothing can harm her, not even death.
[43:32] For if the seed be planted and the the
[43:35] water will raise it up again. Amen. Then
[43:37] I get a then I get a big great
[43:39] hallelujah. Here is the secret. The word
[43:42] is in the bride and the mind of Christ
[43:44] to know what he wants done with the word
[43:47] and she does it in his name. She has
[43:50] thus saith the Lord. Then it is
[43:52] germatized. So the Holy Spirit waters it
[43:55] until it's grown and serves its purpose.
[43:57] They do only his will. No one can
[44:00] persuade them different for they have
[44:02] thus saith the Lord. Or they keep still.
[44:05] Then they will do the works of God, for
[44:08] it is himself in them, continuing his
[44:11] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[44:15] his days. And and I think that we're
[44:17] living in an incredible time. I I
[44:20] believe that that we're upon the earth
[44:22] for a purpose. And and I believe that
[44:24] God has called us to be his body upon
[44:27] the earth and that he can have
[44:29] preeeminence in and the word can can
[44:32] flow through and fulfill what God has
[44:34] for this generation. And and and I like
[44:37] how brother Brandham, he is putting it
[44:40] that the that the word of truth comes to
[44:42] the bride and she receives it, never
[44:45] doubts it, and then she will do the
[44:48] greater works. And and she does it
[44:51] through his name, in his name, for she
[44:54] has thus saith the Lord. And and I
[44:56] believe that that that that the name
[44:59] that the we're coming under is an
[45:01] important thing. and and and when you
[45:03] look at what's so important about the
[45:06] name, brother Brandham, he would teach
[45:08] us that your name characterizes you. It
[45:11] it describes your nature. So, a name is
[45:14] more than just a title or what you're
[45:17] called, but it's the character that
[45:19] you're under. And we could see through
[45:21] the Bible that that Jacob would be
[45:24] changed to Israel and a a and Simon to
[45:27] Peter, Saul to Paul, and and we can look
[45:30] at the opening of the of the seals.
[45:32] Brother Brandham would say, "I'm not
[45:34] going to call you church, but I'm going
[45:36] to call you bride." And and I believe
[45:38] that that has more than just a just a
[45:41] better sounding to it, but I believe
[45:44] that was done for a purpose. And I
[45:46] believe that that when we come under
[45:48] that name, we're coming under a life and
[45:51] coming under an anointing. And this
[45:54] would be prophesied by the scripture
[45:57] that God would take a people out of the
[45:59] Gentiles for his name's sake. And I
[46:02] believe we're living in that time.
[46:04] Brother Brandon would tell us we're
[46:05] living in the separating time where God
[46:08] is calling a bride and the devil's
[46:10] calling a church. And he says, "Let me
[46:13] be a part of that bride." And I'm sure
[46:15] that's your that's your attitude
[46:17] tonight. I don't want to just be a
[46:18] church member, but let me be a part OF
[46:21] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST where I take his
[46:24] name, come under his headship. And it's
[46:27] incredible because we're living in an
[46:29] evil age. Brother Brandham would call it
[46:31] the most deceitful age that there has
[46:34] been. He would preach a message called
[46:36] the God of this evil age. And he would
[46:38] say that it's it's incredible to think
[46:41] that it's the most EVIL AGE, BUT OUT OF
[46:44] THAT AGE, God is calling a people for
[46:47] his name's sake. He would talk about how
[46:49] how that Nazareth was a was a wicked
[46:52] city. It was a prostituting city. And
[46:55] there wasn't a more wicked city upon the
[46:57] earth at that time. BUT OUT OF THAT
[47:00] PLACE, God would call a virgin Mary and
[47:03] would through her produce the promised
[47:06] child. AND HE WOULD SAY, "SO IS IT TODAY
[47:08] IN THE MOST evil age that THERE'S EVER
[47:11] BEEN. GOD IS CALLING A people for his
[47:15] name's sake." So I believe that they're
[47:17] living in a special time. And I believe
[47:20] we're being gathered together. Excuse
[47:22] me. And I don't believe we're being
[47:24] gathered just under a title of Baptist
[47:27] or under a title of Pentecostal or under
[47:30] a title of even message, but I believe
[47:33] we're coming under the life of Jesus
[47:36] Christ which is producing the greater
[47:39] works. And brother Brandham, he in the
[47:42] message God pro God's provided place of
[47:44] worship. He would say there's a
[47:46] difference between somebody putting
[47:48] God's name there and God himself putting
[47:51] his name there. And so many people can
[47:54] claim they're under the name of the
[47:56] Lord, BUT IT'S JUST A TITLE TO THEM
[47:59] BECAUSE YOU CAN BE CALLED a Christian
[48:01] and yet lack the life of Jesus Christ.
[48:04] You can you can BE UNDER THE TITLE OF A
[48:06] MESSAGE believer and still lack the life
[48:09] OF JESUS CHRIST. BUT WHERE HE PLACES HIS
[48:12] NAME, the life is going to be there. SO
[48:15] WE'RE NOT MAKING OURSEL BRIDE, BUT GOD
[48:18] HAS CALLED US AND HAS CHOSEN us and has
[48:21] PLACED HIS LIFE THERE WHICH IS
[48:24] PROCLAIMING THIS IS MY APPROVED PEOPLE
[48:27] UPON THE EARTH. NOT A MEEK BELIEVER, NOT
[48:30] SOMEBODY TRYING TO WORK SOMETHING UP,
[48:32] BUT I MYSELF HAVE PUT MY NAME THERE AND
[48:36] IS PRODUCING A LIFE. AND BROTHER
[48:39] BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US THAT that
[48:41] there's nothing in the Bible that types
[48:43] denominationalism
[48:45] like Babylon. He says it was a forced
[48:47] religion that everybody around there had
[48:50] to come to the Tower of Babel to
[48:52] worship. And what I think is incredible
[48:55] is Brother Brandon then would tell us
[48:57] that you don't get into Christ BY BY
[49:00] BEING FORCED into it. He says you come
[49:02] into it by election. HE SAYS YOUR HEART
[49:05] POURS YOU INTO IT. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE
[49:08] TO THINK THAT THAT THAT Abram would be
[49:10] in a place called which was in southern
[49:13] Babylon. So here Abram was in a forced
[49:17] religion, BUT YET GRACE WOULD CALL HIM
[49:20] AND SAY, "I'VE ELECTED YOU FOR ANOTHER
[49:22] PURPOSE." AND HERE WE'RE living in a in
[49:25] in A IN A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYBODY'S
[49:28] CHRISTIANS. You know, EVERYBODY IS GOING
[49:31] TO HEAVEN. EVERYBODY HAS THE LIFE OF
[49:33] CHRIST. BUT YET THERE'S A PEOPLE BY
[49:37] ELECTION THAT IS CALLING YOU OUT OF A
[49:40] RELIGION AND IS PLACING YOU IN A LIFE.
[49:43] CUZ I DON'T WANT JUST RELIGION. RELIGION
[49:46] IS GOING TO FAIL YOU. RELIGION IS NOT
[49:48] GOING TO KEEP YOUR MARRIAGE TOGETHER.
[49:49] RELIGION IS NOT GOING TO SAVE YOUR
[49:51] CHILDREN. BUT THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST,
[49:54] WHICH THIS MESSAGE HAS BROUGHT, HAS AN
[49:57] AUTHORITY TO KEEP LIVES TOGETHER. HAS AN
[50:00] AUTHORITY TO CHANGE DESIRES AND KEEP
[50:03] MARRIAGES TOGETHER. WE HAVE NOT BEEN
[50:05] GIVEN A FORCED RELIGION. WE'VE BEEN
[50:07] GIVEN a life by election. AND IT'S
[50:10] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE HERE ABRAHAM WOULD BE
[50:13] IN THIS FORCED RELIGION, BUT YET GRACE
[50:16] WOULD CALL HIM OUT. AND YOU COULD LOOK
[50:18] THAT IT WAS GRACE EVERY STEP OF THE
[50:20] JOURNEY. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL
[50:22] US THAT ABRAHAM is a type of the church,
[50:25] right? And he would say that in in the
[50:27] message Jehovah Gyra, I believe it was
[50:29] the the second part of it. He says, "Are
[50:31] you enjoying the study with Abraham, he
[50:33] says that Abraham's life, his journey is
[50:36] a type of the church." AND WHENEVER I
[50:39] WOULD COME ACROSS THAT, IT GAVE ME A
[50:41] DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE of Abraham BECAUSE
[50:43] YOU HEAR THE STORY OF ABRAHAM, HOW THAT
[50:45] GOD WOULD CALL HIM, GOD WOULD CHANGE HIS
[50:47] BODY, HE WOULD MEET MCKAZDC. BUT ONCE I
[50:50] WOULD SEE THAT, it opened IT UP TO ME
[50:53] THAT ABRAHAM'S MY TYPE. EVERY PART OF
[50:56] THE JOURNEY THAT ABRAHAM WOULD GO
[50:58] THROUGH, WE'RE GOING THROUGH IT AS WELL.
[51:01] BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT GOD
[51:03] WOULD CALL HIM BY GRACE. CALL HIM WHICH
[51:06] WOULD BE JUSTIFICATION WHICH WOULD BE
[51:08] LUTHER. AND THEN HE WOULD SAY THERE WAS
[51:10] the confirming of the covenant. He would
[51:12] say which WAS WESLEY WHICH WAS
[51:14] SANCTIFICATION. THEN HE SAYS THEN HE
[51:17] moved on to the Holy Ghost WHICH WAS EL
[51:19] SHADI, RIGHT? WHICH WOULD BE THE
[51:21] STRENGTH GIVER. HE WOULD SAY THAT IS
[51:23] PENTECOST. BUT THEN HE MOVED ON TO
[51:25] ANOTHER PHASE OF HIS JOURNEY WHICH WOULD
[51:28] BE HIS NAME CHANGE. HALLELUJAH. AND WHAT
[51:31] WOULD THAT NAME CHANGE DO? IT WOULD TAKE
[51:33] AWAY HIS REPUTATION OF FATHERLESS AND
[51:37] WOULD BRING ON GOD'S REPUTATION OF
[51:39] FATHER OF NATIONS. SO WHAT WOULD THAT
[51:42] DO? BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THAT NAME
[51:44] CHANGE WAS HIS ADOPTION WHICH IS WHAT
[51:46] WE'RE LIVING IN TODAY. WE'RE NOT LIVING
[51:49] IN THE DAY OF JUST JUSTIFICATION OR
[51:51] SANCTIFICATION OR JUST A A PENTECOSTAL
[51:54] UH GIFT OR OR THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[51:57] GHOST. WE'RE LIVING IN THE DAY WHERE GOD
[52:00] HAS [screaming] CHOSEN TO PLACE HIS
[52:02] NAME, WHICH IS OUR ADOPTION, WHICH IS
[52:05] PLACING US IN OUR INHERITANCE, THAT THE
[52:08] WORLD MIGHT NOT KNOW THE SPIRIT OF
[52:10] TRUTH, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW IT
[52:12] BECAUSE I WILL BE WITH YOU AND BE EVEN
[52:15] IN YOU. WHAT IS IT? HE HAS CHANGED US
[52:18] FROM A CHURCH MEMBER TO HIS BRIDE AND
[52:21] HAS PLACED HIS ANOINTING UPON OUR LIFE
[52:25] THAT THERE CAN BE A POWERFUL PEOPLE UPON
[52:28] THE EARTH. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE WE'RE HERE
[52:30] MORE THAN JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE AND
[52:32] AND TO HAVE A MARRIAGE AND TO HAVE
[52:34] CHILDREN AND TO HAVE A GOOD JOB. BUT WE
[52:36] ARE UPON THE EARTH TODAY TO PRODUCE THE
[52:40] LITERAL LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND I
[52:43] BELIEVE THERE IS A PEOPLE TODAY THAT IS
[52:46] PRODUCING THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO WORK,
[52:48] YOU'RE PRODUCING JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU GO
[52:50] TO SCHOOL, YOU'RE PRODUCING THE LIFE OF
[52:53] JESUS CHRIST. WHEREVER YOU MAY GO,
[52:55] YOU'RE PRODUCING IT BECAUSE SOMETHING
[52:58] HAS CHANGED. WE'RE NOT JUST A CHURCH
[53:00] MEMBER. WE ARE THE BRIDE. HIM. AND
[53:02] WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS BROTHER BRANDON
[53:04] WOULD SAVE the name change OF ABRAHAM
[53:07] WOULD CONDITIONED HIM FOR THE BODY
[53:09] CHANGE WOULD CONDITION HIM FOR THE
[53:11] PROMISED CHILD TO COME. AND SO WHAT ARE
[53:14] WE LIVING IN? BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY
[53:16] WE'RE LIVING IN THE BRIDE AGE. WE'RE
[53:17] LIVING IN THE RAPTURING AGE. SO WHAT IS
[53:20] IT? SINCE WE'VE RECEIVED OUR BODY OR
[53:22] RECEIVED OUR NAME CHANGE, NOW WE'RE
[53:25] CONDITIONED FOR A BODY CHANGE. THAT'S
[53:27] WHAT WE'RE WAITING ON. WE'RE NOT WAITING
[53:29] ON BROTHER BRANDON TO COME AND RIDE THE
[53:31] TRAIL AGAIN. I BELIEVE HIS MESSAGE IS
[53:34] ALREADY RIDING THE TRAIL AGAIN THROUGH
[53:36] THE BRIDE. THE GREATER WORKS WASN'T
[53:39] THROUGH BROTHER BRANDON. THE GREATER
[53:40] WORKS IS INSIDE OF THE BRIGHT COMING OF
[53:43] JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[53:46] WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON, BROTHER JOSH?
[53:48] WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A GIFT. WE'RE NOT
[53:49] WAITING ON A SENSATION. WE'RE WAITING
[53:52] ONE MORNING BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9. THERE'S
[53:54] GOING TO COME A COLD SWEEP THROUGH OUR
[53:56] HOME AND IT'S GOING TO CATCH US AWAY AND
[53:58] WE'RE GOING TO STEP INTO OUR BODY
[54:00] CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING ON.
[54:03] WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A GREATER GIFT.
[54:05] WE'RE WAITING ON THE COMING OF JESUS
[54:08] CHRIST. OH MY. WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED
[54:11] HIS APPEARING. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[54:13] THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
[54:15] APPEARING OF CHRIST AND THE COMING OF
[54:17] CHRIST. HE'S APPEARED. NOW WE'RE WAITING
[54:20] ON HIM TO COME AND WILL CATCH US AWAY IN
[54:22] A RAPTURE. YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS MORNING
[54:25] THAT GOD HAS CALLED US FOR A SPECIAL
[54:27] PURPOSE. BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL
[54:30] US THAT GOD SAID A PEOPLE, not a church,
[54:33] that he's going to call for his name's
[54:35] sake. AND HE WOULD TELL US THIS isn't an
[54:38] an individual affair, right? He's not
[54:40] moving IN A BODY OR a group setting, BUT
[54:44] HE'S WORKING IN INDIVIDUAL LIVES. HE
[54:46] WOULD SAY HE'S NOT GOING TO CALL THE
[54:48] BAPTIST, BUT ONE OUT OF THE BAPTIST. NOT
[54:51] THE PRESBYTERIAN, BUT ONE OUT OF THE
[54:53] PRESBYTERIAN. HE WOULD SAY MANY TIMES,
[54:56] I'M NOT AGAINST THE PEOPLE. I'M AGAINST
[54:58] THE SYSTEM. RIGHT? SO HE'S CALLING NOT A
[55:01] DENOMINATION BUT HE'S CALLING
[55:03] INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IN A
[55:06] FORCED RELIGION BUT HE WOULD CALL YOUR
[55:09] NAME BY ELECTION AND THERE WOULD COME A
[55:11] WORD ACROSS YOUR LIFE ACROSS YOUR PATH
[55:15] AND YOU WOULD SAY I AM MEANT FOR
[55:17] SOMETHING MORE. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WE'RE
[55:20] NOT JUST GATHERING UNDER A CHURCH A
[55:23] CHURCH NAME BUT WE'RE GATHERING UNDER
[55:25] THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. AND BROTHER
[55:28] BRANDON, HE HE WOULD HAVE A A QUESTION
[55:31] GIVEN to him. Will there be or is there
[55:33] now a place for the bride together to
[55:37] live? Like when Moses led the children
[55:40] of Israel, THEN HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION.
[55:42] I'M GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR
[55:44] YOU. IT WAS JUST REVEALED TO ME. I'M
[55:47] GOING TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. YES, SIR.
[55:49] THERE'S A PLACE FOR ALL THE BRIDE TO
[55:52] GATHER TOGETHER. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE
[55:54] IT'S AT? IT'S IN CHRIST. CORRECT? JUST
[55:57] GATHER IN THERE AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.
[56:00] AIN'T THAT A POWERFUL THING? WE'RE NOT
[56:03] COMING UNDER A CHURCH BUILDING. WE'RE
[56:05] COMING UNDER JESUS CHRIST, WHICH IS THE
[56:08] REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. NOT JUST A
[56:10] WORD. IT'S A LIVING WORD.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A LIVING WORD THAT IS
[56:16] CHANGING OUR LIFE, CHANGING OUR DESIRES,
[56:18] AND ONE DAY IT'S GOING TO CHANGE OUR
[56:20] BODY. IT'S A LIVING REALITY. THIS
[56:23] MESSAGE IS MORE THAN QUOTES, MORE THAN
[56:25] DOCTRINES, MORE THAN THEOLOGY. IT'S A
[56:28] REALITY THAT IS CHANGING LIVES. IT'S A
[56:31] REALITY THAT IS GETTING A HOLD OF PEOPLE
[56:34] AND PRODUCING THE LITERAL LIFE OF JESUS
[56:37] CHRIST.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A PLACE THAT GOD is
[56:41] positioning us into. And that's WHY I
[56:44] BELIEVE IN A BRIGHT AGE BECAUSE WE'RE in
[56:47] Leodysia, but we're not a PART OF LEORA.
[56:50] WE'RE IN THE MOST EVIL AGE, but we're
[56:52] NOT A PART OF THE MOST EVIL AGE BECAUSE
[56:55] THERE'S A SEPARATION THAT HAS TAKEN
[56:58] PLACE. And brother, AND THE BIBLE WOULD
[57:00] TELL US IN EXODUS 8:22, "AND I WILL
[57:04] SEVER IN THAT DAY THE LAND OF GAN IN
[57:06] WHICH MY PEOPLE DWELL. NO SWARMS OF
[57:09] FLIES SHALL BE THERE, TO THE END, THOU
[57:12] MAYEST KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD IN THE
[57:14] MIDST of the earth. AND I WILL PUT A
[57:17] DIVISION BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND THY
[57:20] PEOPLE. IN OTHER WORDS, HE THIS IS A
[57:23] PROCLAMATION TO TO TO the the people of
[57:26] of THE EGYPTIANS THAT THERE'S GOING TO
[57:28] COME PLAGUES THROUGH THE LAND, BUT I'M
[57:31] GOING TO SEVER OR SEPARATE, PUT A
[57:34] DIVISION BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND THY
[57:37] PEOPLE THAT WHEN THE PLAGUES COME,
[57:39] THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PARTAKE OF IT. AND
[57:41] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE GAN WAS IN EGYPT
[57:45] BUT THEY WERE SEPARATED. HALLELUJAH. SO
[57:48] WHEN THE DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME THROUGH
[57:50] EGYPT, THEY WAS IN EGYPT BUT NOT A PART
[57:53] OF EGYPT. AND WE'RE IN LEOA BUT WE'RE
[57:56] NOT A PART OF LEOA. WE'RE IN A
[57:58] [screaming] BRIDE AGE. IT WAS ANOTHER
[58:00] VOICE AND COME OUT OF FOR MY PEOPLE, NOT
[58:03] ALL PEOPLE, MY PEOPLE. AND BE NOT
[58:06] PARTAKERS OF THEIR SINS AND OF THEIR
[58:09] PLAGUES. THERE'S A SEPARATION THAT HAS
[58:12] TAKEN PLACE. AND BROTHER BRANDAM SAID,
[58:14] DIDN'T JESUS SAY IN THE LAST DAYS,
[58:16] MATTHEW 24:24,
[58:18] THE TWO WOULD BE SO CLOSE IT WOULD
[58:21] DECEIVE THE very genes predestinated,
[58:23] the elected ones, IF IT WERE POSSIBLE,
[58:26] ALMOST LIKE THE REAL THING. SEE, SO IN
[58:29] THE LAST DAYS, NOW YOU SEE IT'S WHEAT
[58:31] time now. IT'S GETTING HARVEST TIME.
[58:34] THIS IS NOT LUTHER'S AGE. THIS IS NOT
[58:36] PENTECOSTAL'S AGE. THIS IS THE BRIDE
[58:38] AGE. AS MOSES CALLED A NATION OUT OF A
[58:41] NATION, CHRIST TODAY IS CALLING A CHURCH
[58:45] OUT OF A CHURCH. YOU SEE THE SAME THING
[58:47] IN TYPE taking them TO THE GLORIOUS
[58:51] ETERNAL PROMISED LAND. SO I BELIEVE THIS
[58:54] POSITION IS NOT SOMETHING TO COME, BUT I
[58:57] BELIEVE WE'RE IN THAT POSITION NOW.
[58:59] YEAH. YOU KNOW, AND brother Samuel, I
[59:01] had a brother tell me the other day that
[59:03] we're not in adoption YET. HE SAYS, "THE
[59:05] PENTECOSTALS HAVEN'T SEPARATED YET." I
[59:07] SAID, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE ADOPTION
[59:09] MEANS TO BE PLACED. THAT'S WHAT THIS
[59:11] MESS HAS COME TO DO WAS TO PLACE US. AND
[59:14] SO I BELIEVE WE'RE LIVING IN THE DAY
[59:17] WHERE GOD HAS PLACED US INTO OUR
[59:19] INHERITANCE. WE'RE NOT WANDERING AROUND
[59:22] IN THE WILDERNESS ANY LONGER. WE'RE NOT
[59:24] WANDERING AROUND TRYING TO GET THERE. WE
[59:26] HAVE ARRIVED. WE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN OUR
[59:29] POSITION. OH, IT WAS IT WAS IT would be
[59:31] CALEB THAT WOULD SAY, "GIVE ME MY
[59:33] MOUNTAIN. I'M NOT STUMBLING AROUND THERE
[59:35] NO MORE. I'M HERE. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN.
[59:38] I DON'T CARE HOW OLD I MAY BE. THAT'S MY
[59:40] INHERITANCE. THAT'S MY PROMISE. OH MY.
[59:44] AND IF GOD, WE HAVE SOME MORE PEOPLE
[59:45] LIKE THAT TODAY. I SAY THE GATES OF HELL
[59:48] MAY COME AGAINST YOU, BUT THEY'RE NEVER
[59:50] GOING TO PREVAIL. YOU MIGHT YOU MAY FEEL
[59:53] LIKE YOU'RE WEAK. YOU'RE TIRED. YOU'RE
[59:55] YOU'RE YOU'RE A TIRED CHRISTIAN, BUT YET
[59:57] JUST REMEMBER YOU'RE UNDER AN ANOINTING
[1:00:00] THAT IS PLACING YOU. I SEE WHATEVER GOD
[1:00:04] LEADS YOUR SOUL TO BELIEVE, CLAIM IT.
[1:00:07] HALLELUJAH. THIS AIN'T A PROSPERITY
[1:00:09] GOSPEL. BUT AS THE WORD COMES ACROSS AND
[1:00:12] IT STRIKES THAT SOUL AND YOU SAY AMEN. I
[1:00:15] SAY WHATEVER IT IS, YOU CAN HAVE IT. IF
[1:00:18] YOU WANT TO SEE PRODALS COME BACK HOME,
[1:00:20] I SAY BELIEVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE
[1:00:22] REVIVAL IN YOUR HOME, I SAY BELIEVE IT.
[1:00:26] IF YOU WANT TO SEE MARRIAGES COME BACK
[1:00:28] TOGETHER, I SAY BELIEVE IT. WE'RE UNDER
[1:00:31] AN ADOPTION MINISTRY THAT IS PLACING US
[1:00:34] IN OUR INHERITANCE.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; NOT SOMETHING TO COME. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE
[1:00:41] ARE SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES. OH MY.
[1:00:45] WE'RE SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES. AND AND
[1:00:48] WE'RE CONNECTED TO A LIFE SOURCE.
[1:00:50] BROTHER BRAND SAY THAT'S THE WAY
[1:00:52] CHURCHES ARE. THERE TOO MANY TODAY.
[1:00:54] WE'RE JUST TAKING THE name of Christian
[1:00:57] church pretending to be the bride when
[1:01:00] it's artificially.
[1:01:02] HE SAYS WE'RE NOT CONNECTED WITH CHRIST
[1:01:04] IN ANY WAY. WE'RE LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL
[1:01:06] TOOTH, an artificial arm, AN ARTIFICIAL
[1:01:09] EYE. SEE, IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:01:11] ARTIFICIAL IF WE'RE JUST PUTTING IT ON.
[1:01:14] WELL, YOU CAN'T PUT ON CHRISTIANITY. YOU
[1:01:17] YOU HAVE GOT TO BE CONNECTED WITH IT.
[1:01:20] AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE
[1:01:21] ARTIFICIALLY THE BRIDE, BUT I believe
[1:01:24] that we ARE CONNECTED TO THE LIFE OF
[1:01:27] JESUS CHRIST. AND AND BROTHER BROWN, HE
[1:01:29] WOULD TELL US THAT THERE'S A SPIRIT
[1:01:31] BEHIND EVERYTHING, RIGHT? He says
[1:01:33] there's spirits behind music, spirits
[1:01:35] behind buildings. He says spirits behind
[1:01:37] church. And he says you can take on a
[1:01:39] CHURCH SPIRIT AND YOU WOULD HAVE THAT
[1:01:42] NATURE OR HAVE THAT ANOINTING. BUT I
[1:01:45] DON'T BELIEVE GOD HAS CALLED US TO COME
[1:01:47] UNDER A CHURCH SPIRIT. BUT TO COME UNDER
[1:01:50] HIS SPIRIT. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE
[1:01:53] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, "THIS IS THE
[1:01:54] uniting time." AND HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THE
[1:01:57] BRIDE UNITING WITH?" HE would say,
[1:01:59] "SHE'S UNITING WITH THE WORD." HE WOULD
[1:02:01] SAY, "HEAVENS AND EARTH MAY PASS AWAY,
[1:02:03] BUT my word will never PASS AWAY. SHE'S
[1:02:06] UNITING HERSELF WITH THUS SAITH THE
[1:02:09] LORD." REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANY
[1:02:11] DENOMINATION OR ANYBODY ELSE SAYS, SHE'S
[1:02:14] UNITING HERSELF AND SHE'S GETTING READY.
[1:02:17] WHY? SHE IS THE BRIDE. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:02:20] SHE'S UNITING HERSELF WITH THE
[1:02:22] BRIDEGROOM. AND THE BRIDEGROOM IS THE
[1:02:24] WORD. AND SO, AND THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE
[1:02:27] WE ARE AT TODAY. And brother Brandon
[1:02:29] would tell us when we take on his name,
[1:02:31] he says, "We're no longer a church of
[1:02:33] the world, but we're the church of God.
[1:02:35] We're a church of Christ." And and he
[1:02:37] would stop and he would he WOULD SAY, "I
[1:02:39] DON'T MEAN THAT BY NAME. I mean that by
[1:02:41] nature." AND SO, IT'S MORE THAN A TITLE,
[1:02:44] BUT IT'S THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD. IT'S THE
[1:02:47] LIFE OF GOD AND AND THE ATTRIBUTES OF
[1:02:49] GOD IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NAME
[1:02:52] OF GOD. And and you brother I mentioned
[1:02:55] earlier brother Brown I'm going to
[1:02:56] PREACH A MESSAGE BECAUSE God provide a
[1:02:58] place of worship. And he would say that
[1:03:01] that in the place where my name is of
[1:03:03] Paul I will MEET THE WORSHIPPER THERE.
[1:03:06] NOT AT ANY PLACE BUT WHERE MY NAME IS
[1:03:09] THERE YOU CAN MEET ME THERE. MY
[1:03:12] ATTRIBUTES can be displayed to you. And
[1:03:15] and if YOU LOOK AT THAT WORD OR THE
[1:03:17] definition of name, IT MEANS REPUTATION,
[1:03:21] FAME OR GLORY. SO WHERE MY NAME IS GOING
[1:03:24] TO BE, THERE MY GLORY IS GOING TO BE
[1:03:27] THERE. MY REPUTATION IS GOING TO BE AND
[1:03:31] AND YOU CAN MENTION SOME PEOPLE'S
[1:03:33] REPUTATION or some people's name and it
[1:03:36] brings up a reputation. for anybody that
[1:03:38] that that THAT LIKE IN CONSTRUCTION. I'm
[1:03:41] an electrician by trade and and so you
[1:03:43] can mention a company's name and that
[1:03:45] brings up a reputation. You know, you
[1:03:47] can get the question, you know, of a
[1:03:49] good AC guy or a good plumber. You can
[1:03:51] mention the name and they say, "Oh,
[1:03:52] WE'VE USED HIM BEFORE." WELL, THAT NAME
[1:03:54] BROUGHT UP A REPUTATION. AND THE BIBLE
[1:03:57] WOULD SAY IN PROVERBS 22:1,
[1:04:00] A GOOD name is RATHER TO BE CHOSEN THAN
[1:04:03] GREAT RICHES. SO IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD
[1:04:06] REPUTATION IS BETTER THAN RICHES. AND AS
[1:04:10] I WAS LOOKING AT THESE THINGS, THE BIBLE
[1:04:12] SAYS WE'RE BORN SPEAKING LIES. WE'RE
[1:04:14] SHAPING INIQUITY. SO WE WAS BORN WITH
[1:04:17] THE REPUTATION OF JUST A CHURCH ME
[1:04:20] SOMEBODY THAT'S GOOD FOR NOTHING. BUT AT
[1:04:23] THE NAME CHANGE, HE WOULD TAKE AWAY OUR
[1:04:26] REPUTATION AND WOULD GIVE US HIS
[1:04:28] REPUTATION. WHERE WE ONCE WAS A
[1:04:30] POWERLESS PEOPLE, BUT NOW WE'RE MORE
[1:04:33] THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH CHRIST. SO THAT
[1:04:35] NAME CHANGE WOULD CHANGE OUR REPUTATION
[1:04:39] AND WOULD CHANGE THE FUTURE THAT WE WAS
[1:04:41] WALKING UPON. YOU KNOW, CUZ UH WHENEVER
[1:04:44] GOD WOULD CHANGE ABRAHAM'S NAME, HE
[1:04:46] DIDN'T CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT SOUND
[1:04:48] BETTER. IT HE CHANGED IT TO ALTER THE
[1:04:51] FUTURE THAT HE WAS WALKING UPON.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD CHANGE THE COURSE THAT HE WAS
[1:04:57] WALKING UPON. AND THE BIBLE WOULD SAY,
[1:04:59] "IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ON MEN
[1:05:03] UNTO ME." IN OTHER WORDS, YOU MIGHT BE
[1:05:06] WALKING A DIRECTION, BUT IF THE WORD BE
[1:05:09] LIFTED UP, IT'S GOING TO DRAW YOU. IT'S
[1:05:12] GOING TO ATTRACT YOU. YOU REMEMBER THAT
[1:05:14] THE BROTHER BRANDMA TELL THE STORY OF
[1:05:16] THE FIVE SONS THAT THAT THAT ALL WENT
[1:05:19] into the military. Do y'all remember
[1:05:20] that STORY AND HOW THAT THERE WASN'T
[1:05:23] ANYBODY IN THEIR FAMILY THAT WAS EVER IN
[1:05:26] THE MILITARY? BUT THE OLDEST SON GREW
[1:05:28] UP, WENT INTO THE NAVY. SECOND ONE GREW
[1:05:30] UP, WENT INTO THE NAVY ALL THE WAY DOWN
[1:05:32] TO THE FIFTH SON. ALL WENT INTO THE
[1:05:35] NAVY. AND THE PARENTS KNEW SOMETHING WAS
[1:05:38] GOING ON BECAUSE WHAT MADE THE CHANGE?
[1:05:41] THEY WERE ON A DIRECTION OF BYPASSING
[1:05:43] THE MILITARY, BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
[1:05:46] SOMETHING WOULD CHANGE THEIR DIRECTION.
[1:05:48] AND SO THEY STARTED TO INVESTIGATE WHAT
[1:05:51] MADE THIS CHANGE. THEY WOULD GO INTO THE
[1:05:53] THE BOYS'S BEDROOM AND WHAT WOULD BE ON
[1:05:56] THEIR WALL. IT WAS A PICTURE OF A SHIP
[1:05:59] UPON THE OCEAN. AND EVERY NIGHT BEFORE
[1:06:02] THEY WENT TO BED, THEY LOOKED AT THAT
[1:06:04] PICTURE. EVERY MORNING THEY GOT UP, THEY
[1:06:06] LOOKED AT THAT PICTURE. WHAT WAS IT?
[1:06:08] SOMETHING WAS LIFTED UP THAT WOULD
[1:06:11] CHANGE THE DIRECTION THEY WAS WALKING.
[1:06:13] [screaming] OH MINE, IF I BE LIFTED UP,
[1:06:16] I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME. YOU MIGHT
[1:06:19] BEEN ON A DIRECTION OF SUICIDE. YOU
[1:06:22] MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON A DIRECTION OF A
[1:06:24] MARRIAGE FALLING APART, BUT A WORD WAS
[1:06:26] LIFTED UP ONE DAY. AND AS YOUR PASTOR
[1:06:29] WAS PREACHING, HE WAS LIFTING UP A
[1:06:31] REALITY. AND YOU WILL LOOK UP AND LIVE.
[1:06:34] YOU WOULD REALIZE THERE IS SOMETHING
[1:06:36] DRAWING ME. IT'S ATTRACTING ME. IT'S
[1:06:39] PULLING ME TO A REALITY.
[1:06:42] IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN.
[1:06:45] SO THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH
[1:06:47] ABRAHAM. THERE WOULD BE AN ATTRACTION
[1:06:50] OUT OF AND WOULD CHANGE THE DIRECTION
[1:06:52] THAT HE WAS UPON BY THE REPUTATION OF
[1:06:55] GOD. AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL
[1:06:57] US WHAT THE NAME CHANGE WAS, RIGHT? It
[1:06:59] would BE ABRAM. AND THEN ELOHIM, THE
[1:07:02] LAST PART OF ELOHIM WOULD COME TO ABRAM
[1:07:04] AND IT WOULD BE ABRAHAM. WHAT WAS THAT?
[1:07:07] WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS THAT SHOWING? IT WAS
[1:07:09] MAN HUMANITY AND DEITY COMING TOGETHER
[1:07:14] CHANGING THE COURSE OF HUMANITY TO THE
[1:07:18] LEADERSHIP OF DEITY. AND THAT IS WHAT
[1:07:21] HAS HAPPENED IN THIS GENERATION. YOU'RE
[1:07:24] NOT JUST THE SON OF YOUR PARENTS BUT YOU
[1:07:26] ARE THE SON AND DAUGHTER OF ALMIGHTY
[1:07:29] GOD. AND HE'S PLACED HIS NAME IN YOUR
[1:07:32] HUMANITY.
[1:07:34] HE'S PLACED IT IN YOUR HUMANITY, IN YOUR
[1:07:36] FLESH THAT HAS ACHES AND PAINS. IN YOUR
[1:07:39] FLESH THAT HAS MIND BATTLES, IN YOUR
[1:07:42] FLESH THAT GETS TIRED, IN YOUR FLESH
[1:07:45] THAT DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TAKE
[1:07:46] ANOTHER STEP. DEITY HAS COME IN THAT
[1:07:49] HUMANITY IN THAT FALLEN FALLEN FLESH
[1:07:53] THAT HAS HAS ACHES AND PAINS AND IS
[1:07:56] PRODUCING THE COURSE THAT JESUS HAS FOR
[1:07:59] YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. SO, WE'VE BEEN
[1:08:03] GIVEN THE REPUTATION OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:08:06] AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK
[1:08:08] AT ZAKIUS. THE BIBLE SAYS HE SOUGHT TO
[1:08:11] SEE WHO JESUS WAS. AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO
[1:08:14] JUST SEE THE BODY OF JESUS. HE WANTED TO
[1:08:17] SEE who Jesus was. He wanted to SEE THE
[1:08:20] THE REPUTATION THAT HE HAD. AND AND IT'S
[1:08:23] INCREDIBLE CUZ THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US
[1:08:25] THAT JESUS, he would come TO TO TO
[1:08:28] ZAKIUS'S HOUSE AND HE WOULD LATER on
[1:08:30] leave ZAKIUS'S HOUSE. SO THE BODY LEFT,
[1:08:33] BUT THE REPUTATION REMAINED. THE GLORY
[1:08:36] OF JESUS WOULD REMAIN BECAUSE THE BIBLE
[1:08:39] WOULD TELL US THAT ZAKIUS, HE WAS A TAX
[1:08:41] COLLECTOR, RIGHT? HE HE HE WAS A MAN
[1:08:43] THAT HE HAD DONE PEOPLE WRONG AND AND
[1:08:46] AFTER THAT GLORY WOULD COME TO HIS HOME,
[1:08:49] HE WOULD GO AND MAKE ALL OF HIS WRONGS
[1:08:51] RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE WILL DO.
[1:08:54] IT'S A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT CAN CHANGE
[1:08:57] DESIRES THAT CAN CHANGE THE COURSE THAT
[1:09:00] YOU ARE UPON. YOU SEE, IT'S THE GLORY OF
[1:09:03] THE LORD THAT HAS RISEN UPON US. THE THE
[1:09:05] THE THE THE REPUTATION OF THE LORD HAS
[1:09:09] COME UPON US IN THIS GENERATION. AND
[1:09:12] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE MOSES, HE WOULD
[1:09:14] WANT TO SEE GOD'S GLORY, [clears throat]
[1:09:16] EXCUSE ME, in Exodus 33:18. And he SAID,
[1:09:20] I BESEECH THEE, SHOW ME THY GLORY. AND
[1:09:23] HE SAID, I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS
[1:09:25] PASS BEFORE THEE, AND I will proclaim
[1:09:27] the name of the Lord before thee, and
[1:09:30] will BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE
[1:09:32] GRACIOUS, AND WILL SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I
[1:09:36] WILL SHOW MERCY. SO WHAT'S HE SAYING
[1:09:38] HERE? THAT MY NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH MY
[1:09:42] ATTRIBUTES. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A
[1:09:44] DIFFERENT SIDE OF ME WHERE I AM NOT JUST
[1:09:47] A GOD OF JUDGMENT, BUT I'M A GOD OF
[1:09:49] MERCY. I'M NOT JUST A GOD OF WRATH, BUT
[1:09:51] I AM A GOD OF GRACE. AND AND IT WAS AT
[1:09:54] THE PROCLAIMING of that name THAT THEY
[1:09:57] WOULD SEE THE ATTRIBUTES OF WHO GOD IS.
[1:10:00] AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE
[1:10:02] BIBLE TELLS US THAT THE DEATH ANGEL
[1:10:05] WOULD COME THROUGH the land of Egypt,
[1:10:06] right? AND WOULD STRIKE ALL OF THE
[1:10:08] FIRSTBORN. AND COULD YOU IMAGINE BEING
[1:10:11] PHARAOH? ANY GOOD LEADER WOULD WOULD
[1:10:13] WOULD WOULD WOULD TRY TO COME UP WITH A
[1:10:15] PLAN. ALL THE FIRSTBORNS ARE DYING IN MY
[1:10:18] KINGDOM. WHAT CAN I DO TO SAVE THEM?
[1:10:21] WHAT CAN I DO TO GET THE JUDGMENTS OUT
[1:10:23] OF MY HOME, OUT OF MY KINGDOM? BUT
[1:10:25] LITTLE DID HE KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE
[1:10:28] THING CALLED HISSIP. BROTHER, THE BIBLE
[1:10:30] TELL US THAT THEY HAD TO GET HIP, RIGHT?
[1:10:33] DIP IT INTO THE BLOOD AND WOULD PUT IT
[1:10:35] OVER THE DOORPOST. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:10:37] WOULD TELL US THAT HISSIP WAS A COMMON
[1:10:40] WEED IN PALESTINE. SO LITTLE DID PHARAOH
[1:10:43] KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SO SIMPLE THAT
[1:10:47] COULD CHANGE THE JUDGMENT, TAKE AWAY THE
[1:10:49] JUDGMENT FROM HIS KINGDOM. BUT YOU KNOW
[1:10:52] WHAT? IT WASN'T REVEALED TO HIM. THE
[1:10:54] NAME OF THE LORD WAS A PROCLAIMED TO
[1:10:57] HIM. HE WAS UNDER JUDGMENT. BUT AT THE
[1:11:00] SAME TIME, AT THE PROCLAIMING OF MY
[1:11:02] NAME, I'M GOING TO SHOW MERCY TO THESE
[1:11:06] PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE UNDER JUDGMENT.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER BARON, TELL US WHAT DOES
[1:11:12] HIPCEPT TYPE IT TYPES FAITH, RIGHT?
[1:11:14] SOMETHING SO SIMPLE. AND WE'RE LIVING IN
[1:11:17] THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WHERE PEOPLE'S
[1:11:19] LOSING THEIR MINDS. SUICIDE IS TAKING
[1:11:21] PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT. AND
[1:11:23] PSYCHOLOGISTS. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND
[1:11:25] THE ANSWER, TRYING TO FIND THE CURE TO
[1:11:28] KEEP PEOPLE. BUT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW
[1:11:30] THE PROCLAIMING OF THE NAME OF THE LORD
[1:11:33] IN THIS GENERATION HAS BROUGHT MERCY TO
[1:11:36] WHOM I [screaming] WILL BRING MERCY TO.
[1:11:39] [applause and cheering]
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. YOU MAY SAY, "WHAT DO YOU
[1:11:42] MEAN?" WELL, WHAT IS WHAT IS THE NAME OF
[1:11:45] THE LORD? BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD
[1:11:46] TELL US THAT THE PROCLAIMING, THE WORD
[1:11:49] INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:11:52] NAME OF GOD. SO WE'RE UNDER HIS NAME.
[1:11:55] THE WORD INTERPRETED IS THE
[1:11:57] MANIFESTATION OF THE NAME OF GOD. SO IN
[1:12:01] OTHER WORDS, WHILE ONE PEOPLE'S UNDER
[1:12:03] JUDGMENT, THE OTHER ONE IS UNDER GRACE.
[1:12:06] THE OTHER ONES IS UNDER MERCY. AND I
[1:12:10] BELIEVE THAT'S WHO I'M FALLING UNDER.
[1:12:12] NOT JUDGMENT, BUT UNDER GRACE. You
[1:12:14] believe it this MORNING THAT IT'S GRACE
[1:12:17] EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THAT IS CALLING
[1:12:20] CALLING US AND proclaiming the name of
[1:12:22] the Lord AND BROTHER BRANDON HE WOULD
[1:12:24] TELL US THAT THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:12:27] GOD WOULD HAVE TITLES right he would be
[1:12:29] the rose OF SHARON LILY OF THE VALLEY
[1:12:32] BRIGHT AND MORNING STAR HE WOULD SAY
[1:12:34] JEHOVAH GYRA OR THEY WERE ALL TITLES BUT
[1:12:37] WHENEVER CHRIST COME WHAT WOULD JESUS
[1:12:40] SAY I COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME IN OTHER
[1:12:44] WORDS. I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S GLORY.
[1:12:47] I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S REPUTATION.
[1:12:50] YEAH, THERE'S A STORM COMING. YOU
[1:12:52] REMEMBER THE ONE THAT SAYS, "LET THERE
[1:12:53] BE LIGHT." THAT SAME REPUTATION IS IN
[1:12:56] THIS BODY. PEACE BE STILL. I'M COMING IN
[1:12:59] MY FATHER'S GLORY.
[1:13:02] HALLELUJAH. LAZARUS, COME FORTH. WHAT
[1:13:05] WAS IT? THE FATHER'S [screaming] GLORY
[1:13:07] WAS IN INSIDE OF A BODY PRODUCING A
[1:13:11] GREATER WORK. OH, WHAT ARE WE LIVING
[1:13:13] UNDER TODAY? WE'RE LIVING UNDER THE
[1:13:16] GLORY OF THE LORD. THE SAME LIFE THAT
[1:13:18] WAS IN JESUS CHRIST TO SPEAK THROUGH A
[1:13:21] NATURAL STORM IS INSIDE OF A PEOPLE THAT
[1:13:24] CAN SPEAK THE SPIRITUAL STORMS.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:13:29] HOW YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH. I
[1:13:31] SAY PICK UP A WORD AND AS YOU SPEAK THAT
[1:13:34] WORD, IT HAS AN ANOINTING THAT CHANGE
[1:13:37] SITUATIONS.
[1:13:38] YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK IT'S TIME
[1:13:40] THAT WE GET ALL GET AWAY FROM NEGATIVE
[1:13:43] CONFESSIONS AND GET BACK TO A POSITIVE
[1:13:46] CONFESSION. YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:13:48] SAYS WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING NEGATIVE, HE
[1:13:50] SAYS THAT'S THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE. GOD
[1:13:52] HASN'T CALLED US TO SPEAK A A DEVILISH
[1:13:55] LANGUAGE. HE'S CALLED US TO SPEAK A
[1:13:57] HEAVENLY LANGUAGE. WHAT IS THIS HEAVENLY
[1:13:59] LANGUAGE? THE WORD IS NIGH IN THE HEART
[1:14:03] AND EVEN IN THY MOUTH. THE WORD NIGH, IT
[1:14:06] MEANS AT HAND. SO THE WORD IS AT HAND. I
[1:14:09] SAY PUT THAT IN YOUR MOUTH. SPEAK THY
[1:14:12] WORD. INSTEAD OF NEGATIVITY, SPEAK
[1:14:15] SOMETHING POSITIVE.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming]
[1:14:18] COME ON NOW. [laughter]
[1:14:19] THAT NEGATIVE SPEECH AIN'T GOING TO HELP
[1:14:21] YOU. OH, I'M PREACHING NOW. THAT
[1:14:24] NEGATIVE SPEECH AIN'T GOING TO PULL YOU
[1:14:26] OUT OF DEPRESSION. IT'S NOT GOING TO
[1:14:28] PULL YOU OUT OF ANXIETY. THAT NEGATIVE
[1:14:30] SPEECH AIN'T GOING TO SAVE YOUR
[1:14:32] CHILDREN. BUT A POSITIVE GOSPEL WILL. A
[1:14:35] POSITIVE WILL. IT HAS THE POWER TO
[1:14:38] CHANGE SITUATIONS.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; What is it, brother Josh? REMEMBER JOHN?
[1:14:43] GO TAKE THE BOOK. EAT THE BOOK. THEN YOU
[1:14:46] SHALL PROPHESY AGAIN. WHO IS THAT? A
[1:14:48] TYPE OF YOU AND I. WE'VE TAKEN THE BOOK.
[1:14:51] WE'VE EATEN THE BOOK. NOW WE'RE SPEAKING
[1:14:54] THE SAME WORDS THAT WAS INSIDE OF THIS
[1:14:56] BOOK. YOU BELIEVE that tonight OR THIS
[1:14:59] MORNING? OH MY. SO JESUS WOULD SAY, "I
[1:15:02] COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME." Excuse me.
[1:15:06] And and I think IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLE
[1:15:08] BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS US that Jesus
[1:15:11] would look at THE PHARISEES AND WOULD
[1:15:13] say in vain, "Do you worship me?"
[1:15:15] TEACHING FOR DOCTRINE the tradition of
[1:15:18] men. So here they were worshiping, BUT
[1:15:21] YET THEIR WORSHIP WAS IN VAIN. AND THAT
[1:15:24] REALLY SPOKE TO MY HEART. I DON'T WANT
[1:15:26] TO BE WORSHIPING AND MY WORSHIP be in
[1:15:28] vain. I I don't WANT TO BE PAYING MY
[1:15:30] TITHES AND AND MY OFFERINGS and coming
[1:15:33] to church on a Thursday and upon a
[1:15:36] Sunday and my worship be in vain. And
[1:15:39] and you WANT TO KNOW WHY THE worship was
[1:15:41] in vain? Brother Brandham, HE WOULD TELL
[1:15:43] US THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY HAD
[1:15:45] DISASSOCIATED
[1:15:46] THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO
[1:15:49] ANOINT THE WORD. HOW COME? BECAUSE THAT
[1:15:52] THROUGH THEIR TRADITION. SO BY WHAT THEY
[1:15:55] THOUGHT WAS RIGHT, THERE WAS
[1:15:56] DISASSOCIATING
[1:15:58] the moving OF THE SPIRIT TO ANOINT THE
[1:16:01] WORD. And and and that can happen IN A
[1:16:03] IN A MESSAGE CHURCH AS WELL WHERE YOU DO
[1:16:06] AWAY WITH THE MOVING OF THE SPIRIT AND
[1:16:08] ALL YOU HAVE IS A LETTER AND THE LETTER
[1:16:10] KILLTH, BUT THE SPIRIT BRINGETH LIFE.
[1:16:13] YOU SEE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A DEAD
[1:16:15] LETTER. WE'VE BEEN GIVING A LIVING WORD.
[1:16:18] AND SO AS WE COME UNDER THE LIVING WORD,
[1:16:21] WE'RE GIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT RIGHT AWAY.
[1:16:24] NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, IF IT HAS TO
[1:16:26] CONVICT US, WE SAY, "YES, I WANT MY
[1:16:28] WORSHIP TO BE MET BY GOD." IF IT SAYS TO
[1:16:31] THROW THINGS OUT, WE SAY, "YES, I WANT
[1:16:34] MY WORSHIP TO BE MET BY GOD." AND AND
[1:16:37] WE'RE LETTING THE HOLY SPIRIT HAVE THE
[1:16:39] RIGHT AWAY IN EVERY SITUATION. AND AND
[1:16:42] AND I THINK IT'S A POWERFUL THING
[1:16:45] BECAUSE IN THAT MESSAGE, GOD GOD
[1:16:47] PROVIDED A PLACE OF WORSHIP. Brother
[1:16:49] Brandon would take that scripture in
[1:16:50] Deuteronomy. Don't worship in any OF THY
[1:16:53] GATES. BUT AT THE PLACE WHICH THE LORD
[1:16:56] SHALL place his name, THE LORD GOD SHALL
[1:16:59] CHOOSE to place his name. He says there
[1:17:02] you shall worship. and and and BROTHER
[1:17:04] BRANDON WOULD TYPE THAT OUT TO
[1:17:06] DENOMINATIONS THAT THE THE THE PEOPLE'S
[1:17:09] COMING TO GATES BUT it's denominational
[1:17:11] gates AND AND SO HERE HERE THE PHARISEES
[1:17:15] WERE SINCERELY worshiping but they were
[1:17:18] at THE WRONG ALTAR THEY WERE AT THE
[1:17:20] WRONG GATE THEY WERE AT THE ALTAR OF
[1:17:22] THEIR THEOLOGY OF THEIR TRADITIONS AND
[1:17:25] HERE WOULD COME THE RIGHT ALTAR WHICH
[1:17:27] WOULD BE JESUS SAYING I COME IN MY
[1:17:29] FATHER'S NAME SO THE PLACE THAT HE TOLD
[1:17:32] YOU TO WORSHIP HERE IN MINE. AND WHAT
[1:17:35] WOULD THEY SAY? OH, YOU'RE A BE ELABUB.
[1:17:38] YOU'RE A FORTUNE TELLER. YOU'RE A PRINCE
[1:17:40] OF THE DEVILS. AND SO, HERE WAS THE
[1:17:42] PLACE OF WORSHIP, BUT YET THEY WERE AT
[1:17:45] ANOTHER PLACE. THEY WERE AT ANOTHER
[1:17:47] ALTAR. AND WHAT I THINK IS SO POWERFUL
[1:17:50] IS WHILE THE WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING TO
[1:17:52] ONE GROUP, YOU COULD LOOK AT MARY AND
[1:17:54] MARTHA. THEY WOULD HAVE A BROTHER CALLED
[1:17:56] LAZARUS. AND AND JESUS, HE WOULD BE FOUR
[1:17:59] DAYS LATE, RIGHT? AND HERE MARTHA WOULD
[1:18:02] CALL FOR JESUS TO COME. SHE KNEW IF HE
[1:18:05] WOULD COME, HER BROTHER COULD BE MADE
[1:18:07] WELL. BUT YET HERE, HERE JESUS WOULD
[1:18:10] WANT TO SHOW THEM THE AUTHORITY THAT HE
[1:18:14] WOULD HAVE. I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S
[1:18:16] REPUTATION. AND SO HE WOULD ALLOW
[1:18:19] [screaming] LAZARUS TO GO BY THE WAY OF
[1:18:21] THE GRAVE. HE WOULD SHOW UP. AND YOU
[1:18:23] KNOW, BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US THAT
[1:18:25] THAT THAT MARTHA HAD A RIGHT TO SAY,
[1:18:28] "WHY WASN'T YOU HERE? YOU WHY DIDN'T YOU
[1:18:31] COME? MY BROTHER WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND,
[1:18:33] AND YOU ALLOWED HIM TO DIE." BROTHER
[1:18:35] BRANDHAM SAYS SHE HAD A RIGHT TO SAY
[1:18:38] THOSE THINGS. BUT SHE FORFEITED THOSE
[1:18:40] RIGHTS. AND INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT, SHE
[1:18:43] WOULD SAY THIS HERE. LORD, IF YOU WOULD
[1:18:47] HAVE BEEN HERE, MY BROTHER WOULD NOT
[1:18:49] HAVE DIED. BUT I KNOW NOW [screaming] IF
[1:18:52] WHATEVER YOU ASK GOD, IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:18:56] YOU'RE COME IN THE FATHER'S NAME, YOU'VE
[1:18:59] GOT THE REPUTATION, YOU'VE GOT THE
[1:19:01] GLORY, WHATEVER YOU ASK NOW, IT WILL
[1:19:04] [screaming] HAPPEN. SHE DID NOT COME
[1:19:06] UNDER A NEGATIVE SPEECH. EVEN THOUGH SHE
[1:19:10] DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, SHE WAS STILL
[1:19:12] POSITIVE. I'M AT THE RIGHT PLACE OF
[1:19:14] WORSHIP. THE REPUTATION OF THE LORD IS
[1:19:18] HERE. AND I SAY, YOU MIGHT BE GOING
[1:19:20] THROUGH A ROUGH SITUATION, BUT REALIZE
[1:19:23] YOU'RE AT THE PLACE OF WORSHIP, NOT AT
[1:19:25] THE RIGHT CHURCH, BUT UNDER THE RIGHT
[1:19:27] ANOINTING, UNDER THE RIGHT WORD, AND THE
[1:19:31] GLORY OF THE LORD HAS RISEN UPON THEE
[1:19:34] AND SHALL BE SEEN. LORD,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; OH, WE MIGHT BE AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS,
[1:19:42] BUT WE'RE AT THE SAME PLACE. BROTHER
[1:19:44] BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US WHEN THE
[1:19:46] DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME THROUGH THE LAND
[1:19:48] OF EGYPT, HE SAYS THAT DEATH ANGEL COULD
[1:19:50] GO INTO ANY HOME. IT COULD GO INTO THE
[1:19:53] PALACE, BUT HE SAYS THERE WAS ONE PLACE
[1:19:56] THAT DEATH ANGEL COULD NOT GO TO. AND HE
[1:19:58] SAYS NOT ONE HOME, ONE PLACE. AND HE
[1:20:01] SAYS THAT'S WHERE THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB
[1:20:04] WAS. AND HE SAYS SO IS IT TODAY. THERE'S
[1:20:06] ONE PLACE THAT THE DEATH ANGEL,
[1:20:09] SPIRITUAL DEATH CANNOT COME INTO. AND HE
[1:20:11] SAYS THAT'S WHERE THE LIVING WORD IS. SO
[1:20:14] WE MIGHT NOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION. I
[1:20:17] MIGHT BE IN OKLAHOMA. YOU MIGHT BE HERE
[1:20:20] IN OHIO. SOME MIGHT BE IN MICHIGAN,
[1:20:22] PENNSYLVANIA. WE'RE NOT IN THE SAME
[1:20:24] LOCATION. BUT WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE IN
[1:20:27] CHRIST JESUS SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES
[1:20:31] WHERE THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS.
[1:20:35] [laughter]
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; OH MY. SO BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY
[1:20:39] ABOUT MARTHA. HE SAYS LIFE AND DEATH
[1:20:42] CANNOT ASSOCIATE IN THE SAME CHANNEL. SO
[1:20:45] HERE MARTHA WOULD SAY IF YOU WOULD HAVE
[1:20:47] BEEN HERE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT HAVE DIED
[1:20:48] BUT EVEN NOW AND SO THEY WOULD COME IN
[1:20:51] THE SAME CHANNEL. WHATEVER. OH MY I HOPE
[1:20:54] THIS IS MAKING SENSE THIS MORNING. SO
[1:20:56] THE WILL THAT JESUS HAD THE PURPOSE THAT
[1:21:00] JESUS HAD IN LETTING LAZARUS DIE MARTHA
[1:21:04] [screaming] WOULD COME IN TUNE WITH.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:21:09] THINGS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT GOD'S
[1:21:11] GOT A PURPOSE. AND AS YOU SPEAK A
[1:21:13] POSITIVE WORD, YOU'RE COMING IN LINE IN
[1:21:16] THE SAME CHANNEL THAT GOD HAD FOR YOU
[1:21:20] GOING THROUGH THAT.
[1:21:22] HALLELUJAH. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:21:25] THAT JESUS WANTED TO TEST HER. HE WOULD
[1:21:27] SAY, HE WOULD SAY UNTO HER, I AM THE
[1:21:29] RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. HE THAT
[1:21:31] BELIEVETH IN ME, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS,
[1:21:33] NOT ON ME, BUT IN ME. HE SAYS, "YOU
[1:21:36] CAN'T BELIEVE ON HIM UNTIL YOU'RE IN
[1:21:38] HIM." RIGHT? AND HE SAYS, "BY ONE
[1:21:40] SPIRIT, WE'RE ALL BAPTIZED INTO THE
[1:21:42] BODY." AND HE SAYS, "NOT BELIEVING ON
[1:21:44] ME, BUT IN ME." AND SO HERE, BUT AS
[1:21:46] JESUS GOES ON TO SAY, "THOUGH HE WERE
[1:21:49] DEAD, YET SHALL HE LIVE." WHATSO AND
[1:21:51] WHATSOEVER liveth and believeth IN ME
[1:21:54] SHALL NEVER DIE. BELIEVEST THOU THIS?
[1:21:56] AND SHE SAITH UNTO HIM, "YAY, LORD, I
[1:21:59] BELIEVE THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF
[1:22:02] THE SON OF GOD, WHICH SHALL COME INTO
[1:22:05] THE WORLD." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT
[1:22:08] SHE CALLED HIM BY THE RIGHT NAME. AND SO
[1:22:10] WHILE THE PRIESTS WERE CALLING HIM BE
[1:22:12] ELABUB AND FORTUNE TELLER AND PRINCE OF
[1:22:15] THE DEVIL, SHE REALIZED THIS IS THE
[1:22:18] PLACE OF WORSHIP. AND SHE WOULD CALL HIM
[1:22:21] BY THE RIGHT NAME AND WOULD SAY, "LORD,
[1:22:25] YOU'RE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING
[1:22:27] GOD." AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS
[1:22:29] WHENEVER HE WHENEVER SHE SAID THAT, HE
[1:22:32] SAID, "OH, BROTHER," EVERYTHING WAS
[1:22:34] READY TO SPARK OFF RIGHT THEN AND
[1:22:36] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD STOP AND WOULD SAY
[1:22:38] THIS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. OH,
[1:22:40] HALLELUJAH. SO ONCE SHE WOULD SAY,
[1:22:43] "YEAH, LORD, I BELIEVE YOU'RE CHRIST,
[1:22:45] THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD." BROTHER
[1:22:47] BRANDHAM SAYS THE COGS THEY STARTED TO
[1:22:49] SPIN THEN AND WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY? HE
[1:22:52] WOULD BE CRYING AND THEN HE WOULD WIPE
[1:22:54] AWAY THOSE TEARS AND WOULD SAY WHERE
[1:22:56] HAVE YOU LAID HIM? WHERE HAVE YOU LAID
[1:22:58] HIM? ROLL AWAY THE STONE. [screaming]
[1:23:00] ROLL AWAY THAT STONE. AND HE WOULD SPEAK
[1:23:03] THE VOICE OF LIFE IN THAT SITUATION. HOW
[1:23:06] COME SHE RECOGNIZED WHERE SHE WAS AT WAS
[1:23:10] [screaming] THE GLORY OF THE LORD?
[1:23:13] OH, AND I BELIEVE THIS BRIDE HAS
[1:23:15] RECOGNIZED THIS IS MORE THAN A WORD, BUT
[1:23:18] THIS IS WHERE THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS.
[1:23:20] AND THAT GLORY IS HERE TO MOVE IN EVERY
[1:23:23] SITUATION.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU MIGHT GOT LOVED ONES THAT IS NOT
[1:23:29] IN A NATURAL TOMB, BUT IN A SPIRITUAL
[1:23:32] TOMB. GOD IS STILL COMING TO TOMBS AND
[1:23:35] SPEAKING THE VOICE OF RESURRECTION AND
[1:23:38] BRINGING LIFE TO TEENAGERS, BRINGING
[1:23:40] LIFE THE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHATEVER THEY
[1:23:43] MAY BE. I BELIEVE YOU CAN BRING THE
[1:23:45] AUTHORITY OF THE WORD TO THAT SITUATION.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; OH MY LAZARUS DIDN'T BRING JESUS TO THE
[1:23:52] TOMB. MARTHA DID.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. HE KNEW HOW TO RESPOND. IF
[1:23:56] THERE'S A SIN THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO
[1:23:58] RESPOND. BUT IT WAS BECAUSE OF A LOVED
[1:24:00] ONE THAT WAS SAVE. BUT EVEN NOW, LORD,
[1:24:03] WITH HER POSITIVE CONFESSION WOULD BRING
[1:24:06] THE GLORY OF THE LORD TO A LOVED ONE'S
[1:24:09] HOME. And I BELIEVE WE CAN STILL BRING
[1:24:11] MIRACLES. COME ON. WE CAN STILL BELIEVE
[1:24:14] AND GOD CAN SAVE LOVED ONES BECAUSE OF
[1:24:17] YOUR CONFESSION, BECAUSE OF YOUR FAITH,
[1:24:20] BECAUSE OF YOUR UNWAVERING FAITH.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; MY SO, AT THE PROCLAIMING OF MY NAME,
[1:24:28] I'M going to SHOW MY GLORY. AND I THINK
[1:24:31] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
[1:24:34] WE got a portion of God revealed to us.
[1:24:37] But all OF WHO WHO GOD WAS, ALL OF HIM
[1:24:39] HAS BEEN REVEALED. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:24:42] WOULD TELL US THAT THE GOD IN EVERY
[1:24:44] EVERY GENERATION would bring a new part
[1:24:46] of the word. And and he he would he
[1:24:48] would be building up. And brother
[1:24:50] Brandon would SAY THIS HERE, LIKE MY
[1:24:52] BODY WAS BUILT. I'M TOLD IT STARTED in
[1:24:54] the spine, BUT IT WASN'T ALL SPINE. IT
[1:24:57] WENT FROM that to ribs, from lungs to
[1:24:59] hands to arms to feet and so forth until
[1:25:03] it came out to be the person that I am.
[1:25:06] And so, AND HE'S GOING ON TO TELL US
[1:25:09] THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ALLOTTED word for
[1:25:11] each generation. So, just like the
[1:25:13] NATURAL BODY WAS BUILT UP PIECE BY
[1:25:16] PIECE, SO WAS THE SPIRITUAL BODY. WE HAD
[1:25:19] A WORD. We had we had Luther. We had
[1:25:21] sanctification. WE HAD PENTECOST. BUT
[1:25:23] NOW HERE WE ARE WITH THE CAPSTONE WHERE
[1:25:26] THE HEAD HAS COME TO THE BODY WHICH IS
[1:25:29] BRINGING THE INTELLIGENCE. OH, BROTHER
[1:25:31] BRANDHAM SAYS YOU CAN'T GO ANY HIGHER
[1:25:32] THAN THE EYES. RIGHT? HE SAYS THE EYES
[1:25:34] IS A PROPHETIC SIGHT AND WE ARE A
[1:25:37] PROPHETIC PEOPLE. SO WE'RE NOT LIVING AT
[1:25:39] THE BASE. WE'RE NOT LIVING JUST UNDER
[1:25:41] SANCTIFICATION OR OR WESLEY OR LUTHERAN,
[1:25:44] BUT WE'RE LEAVING IN THE DAY WHERE
[1:25:46] CHRIST HAS LIFTED US UP INTO HEAVENLY
[1:25:48] PLACES WHERE WE CAN SEE OUR FUTURE,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; WHERE WE CAN SEE THAT ALL THE ALL THAT
[1:25:54] GOD PROMISED ME I CAN OBTAIN. OH MY. SO
[1:25:58] HERE WE ARE. BUT AS I MENTIONED THIS
[1:26:01] quote earlier, brother Brandham says,
[1:26:03] "And the NAME IS IN THE WORD BECAUSE HE
[1:26:05] IS THE WORD." AMEN. WHAT IS HE THEN? THE
[1:26:08] WORD INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF
[1:26:12] THE NAME OF GOD. NO WONDER FLESH AND
[1:26:14] BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO YOU. BUT
[1:26:16] MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN. FLESH AND
[1:26:19] BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO YOU. BUT
[1:26:21] HE SAYS MY FATHER AND WHICH IS IN HEAVEN
[1:26:24] HATH REVEALED THIS TO YOU WHO I AM. AND
[1:26:27] UPON THIS ROCK I BUILD MY PLACE OF
[1:26:30] WORSHIP AND THE GATES OF HELL CAN'T
[1:26:32] SHAKE IT DOWN. AMEN. OH CHURCH OF THE
[1:26:35] LIVING GOD. STAND IN FIRM FOUNDATION ON
[1:26:39] JESUS Christ alone. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S
[1:26:42] WHAT WE'RE STANDING UPON TODAY is Jesus
[1:26:45] Christ alone. And and brother Brandham,
[1:26:47] he would TELL US THAT IN MY NAME you
[1:26:50] shall cast out devils. HE WOULD SAY
[1:26:52] THAT'S THE FATHER'S NAME. HE SAYS HE PUT
[1:26:54] HIS NAME IN JESUS CHRIST. AND AND THEN
[1:26:56] HE WOULD SAY THIS here in him in there
[1:26:59] he meets to heal the sick. IN HIM AND
[1:27:02] THERE HE MEETS TO SAVE THE LOST. HE
[1:27:04] MEETS the field WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND
[1:27:07] THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE GOD MEETS HIS
[1:27:09] PEOPLE FOR WORSHIP. AND I LOVE THAT
[1:27:12] QUOTE, EXCUSE ME, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST
[1:27:15] COMING UNDER JUST A a rep just coming
[1:27:19] UNDER A A VAIN SOMETHING trying to work
[1:27:21] something out. BUT IT'S A PROMISE WHERE
[1:27:24] TWO OR THREE are gathered IN MY NAME. I
[1:27:27] WILL BE IN THEIR MIDST. THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:27:30] THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER
[1:27:33] AND THE RIGHTEOUS RUN INTO IT AND ARE
[1:27:35] SAVED. THESE ARE LITTLE NUGGETS THAT GOD
[1:27:38] GAVE US ALONG THE WAY SAYING ONCE YOU
[1:27:41] FIND MY PLACE OF WORSHIP, ONCE YOU CAN
[1:27:43] COME UNDER MY NAME, ALL [screaming] OF
[1:27:46] THESE PROMISES CAN BE REVEALED UNTO YOU.
[1:27:49] AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE name of
[1:27:51] the Lord is not just a tower,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; but it's a strong tower. CUZ THERE'S A
[1:27:56] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TOWER AND A STRONG
[1:27:58] TOWER. CUZ I DON'T WANT TO BE JUST IN A
[1:28:00] TOWER. [screaming] BUT LET ME BE IN A
[1:28:02] STRONG TOWER. YOU REMEMBER IN THE OLD
[1:28:04] TESTAMENT, I BELIEVE IN THE BOOK OF
[1:28:05] JUDGES, there was a AN INVADING ARMY
[1:28:08] THAT WOULD COME COME INTO the land and
[1:28:10] and THEY WERE WIPING OUT ALL OF THE
[1:28:12] WARRIORS, WIPING OUT ALL of the men. AND
[1:28:14] THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THERE WAS A group of
[1:28:16] people that would run into a tower. AND
[1:28:18] THE BIBLE SAYS THAT that the king and
[1:28:21] his and his and THIS INVADING ARMY WOULD
[1:28:23] COME TO THAT TOWER and would destroy it.
[1:28:26] Would kill everybody that was in it.
[1:28:27] Destroy the tower. BUT THE BIBLE THEN
[1:28:29] WOULD TELL US THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN
[1:28:31] WOMAN. NOT JUST A WOMAN, BUT A CERTAIN
[1:28:34] WOMAN. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT SHE WOULD
[1:28:36] GO INTO A STRONG TOWER. NOT JUST A
[1:28:39] TOWER, BUT A STRONG TOWER. AND THE BIBLE
[1:28:42] SAYS THAT THAT THE KING WOULD COME TO
[1:28:44] THIS TOWER, THE STRONG TOWER, AND WOULD
[1:28:47] BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE DOOR LIKE HE DID
[1:28:49] THE OTHER TOWERS, BUT HE COULD NOT BREAK
[1:28:51] the door down. AND WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY?
[1:28:53] I AM THE DOOR.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; NO MAN CAN COME TO COME IN UNLESS
[1:28:58] THROUGH ME. SO HERE THIS INVADING KING
[1:29:01] WAS TAKING OVER HOMES, TAKING OVER
[1:29:03] CHURCHES, TAKING OVER FAMILIES, BUT HE
[1:29:06] CAME AGAINST THE STRONG TOWER. AND THE
[1:29:08] BIBLE SAYS HE COULD NOT GET IN BECAUSE
[1:29:11] OF THE DOOR. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT WOULD
[1:29:12] HAPPEN? THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE CERTAIN
[1:29:15] WOMAN, SHE WILL LOOK OUTSIDE OF
[1:29:17] [screaming] THE TOWER AND WOULD GRAB A
[1:29:19] PIECE OF A MILLSTONE AND WOULD THROW IT
[1:29:21] DOWN AND WOULD DESTROY THAT KING. OH,
[1:29:24] WHAT AM I SAYING? SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD
[1:29:27] THE WHOLE MILLSTONE, BUT WHAT SHE DID
[1:29:29] HAVE, SHE WOULD THROW OUT OF HEAVENLY
[1:29:32] PLACES. AND THAT WORD UH WOULD BE AN
[1:29:35] ANOINTED WORD WHICH WOULD DESTROY THE
[1:29:37] ENEMY THAT WAS TAKEN OVER. AND WE HAVE
[1:29:40] BEEN PLACED IN A STRONG TOWER. YOU MIGHT
[1:29:43] NOT KNOW ALL OF THE MESSAGE. YOU MIGHT
[1:29:45] NOT COULD BE ABLE TO QUOTE ALL OF THE
[1:29:47] SCRIPTURE, BUT TAKE A PIECE OF THAT
[1:29:49] MILLSTONE. TAKE A PIECE OF THAT WORD AND
[1:29:52] THROW IT OUT OF HEAVENLY PLACES. AND THE
[1:29:55] DEVIL THAT IS DESTROYING MARRIAGES CAN
[1:29:57] NEVER TOUCH YOUR MARRIAGE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; THE ONE THAT HAS TAKEN OVER CHURCHES CAN
[1:30:03] NEVER TAKE THIS CHURCH BECAUSE WE ARE IN
[1:30:06] A STRONG TOWER.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A TOWER BUT A STRONG TOWER
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; AND HE IS THE DOOR. OH MY. IT'S
[1:30:17] INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT JESUS WOULD
[1:30:19] SAY, "I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD." NOT JUST
[1:30:21] A SHEPHERD, BUT A GOOD SHEPHERD. AND YOU
[1:30:23] KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US
[1:30:25] THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A hireland
[1:30:27] and a shepherd. HE SAYS THE HIERLAND IS
[1:30:30] WITH THE SHEEP DURING THE DAY, BUT AT
[1:30:32] NIGHT TIME HE GOES INTO HIS HOME. BUT HE
[1:30:35] SAYS THE SHEPHERD, HE'S WITH THE SHEEP
[1:30:37] DURING THE DAY, BUT AT THE NIGHT TIME HE
[1:30:40] BECOMES THE DOOR. IN OTHER WORDS, CHRIST
[1:30:42] SAYS, I'M THE GOOD SHEPHERD. I'M WITH
[1:30:45] YOU IN THE GOOD TIMES, BUT IN THE BAD
[1:30:47] TIMES, I AM STILL WITH YOU. I'LL NEVER
[1:30:50] LEAVE YOU. I'LL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I'LL
[1:30:52] BE WITH YOU EVEN IN YOU.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; I'M THE GOOD SHEPHERD. I LAY DOWN MY
[1:30:57] LIFE FOR THE SHEEP. SO, WE'RE NOT THE
[1:30:59] ONLY ONE KEEPING OUR EYES SINGLE UPON
[1:31:02] THE WORD. BUT THE WORD IS ALSO KEEPING
[1:31:04] HIS EYE ON US. THE LORD IS ALSO WATCHING
[1:31:06] US, SAYING, "I'M NEVER GOING TO LEAVE
[1:31:08] YOU. I'M NEVER GOING TO FORSAKE YOU."
[1:31:10] BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A STRONG TOWER.
[1:31:12] NOTHING CAN GET TO YOU UNLESS it comes
[1:31:14] through me.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY SAY, "THEN WHY AM I IN THIS
[1:31:19] GREAT TRIAL?" BECAUSE HE KNEW YOU COULD
[1:31:21] handle it. You remember Job? Hey, THE
[1:31:24] DEVIL COULDN'T EVEN GET TO JOB UNTIL GOD
[1:31:26] SAYS, "HEY, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOB?" HE
[1:31:28] SAYS, "OF COURSE, BUT I CAN'T GET TO
[1:31:32] HIM. YOU'RE THE DOOR."
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] I'M PREACHING NOW. HE
[1:31:36] SAYS, "I CAN'T GET TO HIM. YOU'VE GOT A
[1:31:38] HEDGE AROUND HIM." HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW
[1:31:40] WHAT? I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO TOUCH
[1:31:42] HIM, BUT I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN HIM
[1:31:44] BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST SOME WEAKLING.
[1:31:46] HE'S A MATURED SON OF GOD. YOU CAN COME
[1:31:49] AGAINST HIM, BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO CURSE
[1:31:51] MY NAME." AND SO IS IT TODAY. HE'S THE
[1:31:54] DOOR. HE SAYS, "OKAY, YOU CAN TRY IT.
[1:31:57] YOU CAN GO AND TRY TO DISCOURAGE HIM,
[1:31:58] BUT AS HE COMES AGAINST YOU, YOU SAY,
[1:32:00] "GREATER IS HE THAT IS [screaming] IN ME
[1:32:03] THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD." SATAN,
[1:32:06] I'M NOT JUST IN A TOWER. I'M IN A STRONG
[1:32:08] TOWER.
[1:32:10] [applause]
[1:32:10] I'M NOT JUST A CHURCH MEMBER. I AM THE
[1:32:13] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I'M NOT JUST A
[1:32:16] SON. I'M AN ADOPTED SON. I'M AN ADOPT A
[1:32:20] DAUGHTER PLACED IN MY INHERITANCE. I SAY
[1:32:23] THIS MORNING, GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN
[1:32:26] YOU THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD.
[1:32:29] WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF, YOU ARE AN
[1:32:31] ADOPTED SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THAT
[1:32:35] HAS BEEN SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:32:39] HEY, BROTHER BAM SAYS WHEN YOU SPEAK THE
[1:32:41] WORD, IT'S AS GOOD AS DEITY SPEAKING.
[1:32:44] WHY IS IT? IT IS DEITY SPEAKING. IT'S
[1:32:47] THE SAME WORD THAT SAID, "LET THERE BE
[1:32:49] LIGHT." IS THE SAME WORD THAT CAN FLOW
[1:32:51] THROUGH YOUR LIPS. YES, SIR.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; HEY, we're not just speaking our own
[1:32:55] thoughts. Come on now. WE GOT TO KEEP
[1:32:57] THAT IN CONTEXT, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT JUST
[1:32:59] SPEAKING OUR OWN THOUGHTS. WE'RE
[1:33:00] SPEAKING THE WORD. WE'RE SPEAKING THE
[1:33:03] ANOINTED WORD. AND THAT STILL HAS AN
[1:33:05] ANOINTING.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; That's the way I BELIEVE IN PREACHING
[1:33:09] THE MESSAGE. THAT'S WHY I'M SO THANKFUL
[1:33:11] FOR MEN LIKE BROTHER SAMUEL THAT'S NOT
[1:33:13] GOING TO PREACH THEIR OWN IDEAS. THAT
[1:33:14] AIN'T ANOINTED. BUT THIS WORD IS
[1:33:16] ANOINTED.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; OH [screaming] MY. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE
[1:33:21] WE CAN COME UNDERNEATH IT and expect the
[1:33:24] greater works.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It's a place that we're living in and
[1:33:29] and we're and we're and we're walking
[1:33:31] in. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT GOD HAS HAS
[1:33:34] PLACED HIS NAME UPON us and and would
[1:33:37] tell us THAT THAT I'VE CALLED YOU FOR
[1:33:39] THIS SPECIAL PURPOSE. You can look at
[1:33:42] First Peter 2:9. The Bible says, "But
[1:33:44] you are a chosen generation, A [snorts]
[1:33:47] ROYAL PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, a
[1:33:49] peculiar people, that you SHOULD SHOW
[1:33:51] FORTH THE PRAISES OF HIM WHO HATH CALLED
[1:33:54] YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO HIS MARVELOUS
[1:33:57] LIGHT, WHICH IN TIMES PAST WERE NOT A
[1:34:00] PEOPLE, BUT ARE NOW THE PEOPLE OF GOD,
[1:34:04] WHICH HAD NOT OBTAINED MERCY, BUT NOW
[1:34:07] HAVE OBTAINED MERCY." WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
[1:34:10] WE WERE NOBODY'S, BUT NOW WE'RE
[1:34:12] SOMEBODY.
[1:34:14] WE WERE A NOBODY. WE WEREN'T A PEOPLE.
[1:34:16] BUT NOW WE'RE NOT JUST A PEOPLE. WE'RE
[1:34:18] THE PEOPLE.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU REMEMBER BROTHER BROWN TELL US
[1:34:21] THAT THERE'S THREE NATIONALITIES of
[1:34:23] people, RIGHT? HE SAYS WE COME FROM THE
[1:34:25] SONS of Noah, Ham, Sham, and Japheth,
[1:34:27] right? And he says that's the Jews, the
[1:34:29] Samaritans, and the Gentiles, right? And
[1:34:31] he says that the Jews WOULD GET THE
[1:34:33] MESSIAH SIGN whenever Jesus came to
[1:34:36] Philip, I believe, or Nathaniel, and
[1:34:38] would say before Philip called thee, I
[1:34:40] saw you on the fig tree. I saw you on
[1:34:42] THE TREE. HE SAYS THAT WAS THE MESSIAH
[1:34:44] SIGN TO THE JEWS. And he says then he
[1:34:46] would do the Messiah sign to the
[1:34:48] Samaritans, RIGHT? THE WOMAN AT THE
[1:34:50] WELL, RIGHT? YOU the one you're living
[1:34:52] with AIN'T EVEN YOURS, RIGHT? HE SAYS
[1:34:54] BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM. Even
[1:34:56] he even the woman at the well SAYS WHEN
[1:34:59] THE MESSIAH COMES, he's going to do
[1:35:00] THESE THINGS. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR THE
[1:35:03] MESSIAH. BUT THE GENTILES, BROTHER BRHAM
[1:35:05] SAYS, WERE ROMANS. THEY THEY WERE
[1:35:07] HEATHEN PEOPLE. THEY WERE WORSHIPING
[1:35:09] IDOL GODS. THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR THE
[1:35:11] MESSIAH. BUT IN THIS GENERATION, WHO DID
[1:35:15] THE MESSIAH SIGN COME TO? NOT THE JEWS,
[1:35:19] NOT THE SAMARITANS, BUT IT WOULD COME TO
[1:35:21] A PEOPLE THAT WERE NOBODIES. IN TIMES
[1:35:24] PAST, YOU WERE NOT A PEOPLE, BUT ARE NOW
[1:35:28] THE PEOPLE OF GOD. YOU WEREN'T LOOKING
[1:35:30] FOR ME WHEN I CAME THE FIRST TIME, BUT
[1:35:33] NOW YOU HAVE SEEN MY APPEARING. YOU HAVE
[1:35:36] SEEN WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS GENERATION
[1:35:39] AND I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; OH MY BROTHER BRANDON, I'M GOING TO SAY
[1:35:45] IN MANY PLACES, LORD, I CLAIM THEM FOR
[1:35:47] your glory. He says, I CLAIM THEM TO BE
[1:35:49] A JEWEL in your IN YOUR CROWN. I CLAIM
[1:35:52] THEM AS TREASURES OF THIS MESSAGE OR OF
[1:35:54] THIS GOSPEL. AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS
[1:35:57] HE DIDN'T JUST KEEP it for the local
[1:35:58] audience. HE WOULD SAY, "ALL THE ONES
[1:36:01] THAT WILL HEAR THIS MESSAGE," HE SAYS,
[1:36:03] "I CLAIM THEM." I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS
[1:36:05] JUST HIM SPEAKING WORDS. I BELIEVE THAT
[1:36:08] WAS A PROPHETIC WORD. I'M GOING TO CLAIM
[1:36:11] THE BRIDE. ALL THE ONES THAT HAS A ARE
[1:36:14] TO HEAR THIS WORD, I'M GOING TO CLAIM
[1:36:17] THEM.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; AND AS THE CLAIMS AS GOD CLAIMS YOU, ALL
[1:36:21] OF THE CLAIMS OF THE DEVIL is broke.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE CLAIMED BY
[1:36:26] GOD, YOU CAN'T BE CLAIMED by the devil.
[1:36:28] Right? You remember whenever you
[1:36:30] remember whenever Jesus he needed the
[1:36:32] the donkey to ride into Jerusalem,
[1:36:34] RIGHT? AND THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT HE
[1:36:36] WOULD TELL THE DISCIPLES, "GO INTO
[1:36:39] THERE. YOU'RE GOING to find A DONKEY
[1:36:40] THAT IS TIED UP." He says, "Loose him
[1:36:42] and bring him to me." AND IF ANY MAN
[1:36:44] ASKS YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING, TELL HIM, "I
[1:36:47] HAVE NEED FOR IT." AND SO, AS LONG AS HE
[1:36:50] WAS TIED UP, HE COULD NOT FULFILL THE
[1:36:52] PURPOSE OF JESUS. BUT ONCE JESUS WOULD
[1:36:55] CLAIM HIM, HE HAD TO BE UNTIED.
[1:36:58] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:36:59] WE MAY HAVE BEEN TIED DOWN BY A LOT OF
[1:37:02] THINGS, BUT ONCE THIS MESSAGE CLAIMED
[1:37:05] YOU, WHAT'S THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY
[1:37:07] DOING? THE PREACHING SAYING, "GOD HAS
[1:37:10] NEED FOR YOU. HE HAS NEED FOR YOU. HE
[1:37:13] HAS NEED FOR YOU." AND HE'S LOOSENING
[1:37:15] YOU AND WASHING YOU. OH MY. BY THE WATER
[1:37:19] OF THE WORD. AND AS YOU'RE BEING WASHED,
[1:37:22] YOU'RE BEING CUT FREE FROM EVERY CLAIM
[1:37:24] THAT THE DEVIL HAS. AND YOU'RE CLAIMED
[1:37:27] BY ANOTHER.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT IS THIS STAKING MAN'S FILTER?
[1:37:31] IT'S GIVING YOU A HOLY MAN'S TASTE.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. THIS FILTER, WHAT WOULD
[1:37:36] JESUS PRAY UNTO GOD? DON'T TAKE THEM OUT
[1:37:38] OF THE WORLD, BUT KEEP THEM FROM EVIL.
[1:37:40] AND HE WOULD SAY, SANCTIFY THEM BY YOUR
[1:37:43] WORD, AND YOUR WORD IS TRUTH. WHAT IS
[1:37:46] IT? IT'S A FAKING MAN'S FILTER. NOT
[1:37:49] TAKING YOU OUT OF THE EVIL, BUT TAKING
[1:37:52] THE EVIL OUT OF YOU. AND AS THE WORD
[1:37:55] CLAIMS YOU, ALL OF THE EVIL IS BEING
[1:37:57] PURGED OUT OF YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:00] [screaming]
[1:38:00] AND IT'S SANCTIFYING YOU AND CLAIMING
[1:38:03] YOU FOR THE GLORY OF GOD.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:38:08] WE'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY THE VOICE OF
[1:38:11] ALMIGHTY GOD IN THIS GENERATION.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't you thankful YOU'RE
[1:38:17] CLAIMED?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HAVE THINGS WE'RE
[1:38:20] NOT PROUD OF. SOMETIMES we have scars
[1:38:22] that we don't like. WE HAVE HURTS THAT
[1:38:25] WE DON'T LIKE. We have we have THINGS IN
[1:38:27] OUR PAST WE'RE NOT PROUD OF. We have
[1:38:29] things in our future we're not proud of.
[1:38:32] But you know by the Brown tell us that
[1:38:34] word washed means to be loosed.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Right? And here the word has come to
[1:38:38] wash us which means loosen us. IT'S COME
[1:38:42] TO SET US FREE. And you know but the
[1:38:44] Bible would tell us about Lazarus that
[1:38:47] whenever Jesus came and he says Lazarus
[1:38:49] come forth but the brand would tell us
[1:38:51] if he said come forth the general
[1:38:53] resurrection would have happened right
[1:38:55] but Jesus wasn't after everybody he was
[1:38:58] after Lazarus
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; so he SAYS LAZARUS COME FORTH THAT WAS A
[1:39:02] CLAIMING NOT JUST FOR EVERYBODY BUT
[1:39:04] THERE'S A PREDESTINATED ONE IN THERE I'M
[1:39:07] GOING TO CLAIM HIM HE WOULD SAY LAZARUS
[1:39:09] COME FORTH AND SO HE WOULD BE BROUGHT TO
[1:39:12] LIFE RIGHT?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; But you know that's not the end of THE
[1:39:14] STORY.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS HE WAS STILL IN grave
[1:39:17] clothes.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT? IT WASN'T
[1:39:21] JESUS GOING AND loosening the grave
[1:39:23] clothes. He would commission a five-fold
[1:39:25] ministry saying loose him AND LET HIM
[1:39:28] GO. SO THE SAME VOICE THAT WOULD BRING
[1:39:31] HIM TO LIFE NOW WAS COMMISSIONING A
[1:39:34] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY WITH THE SAME WORD,
[1:39:37] WITH THE SAME ANOINTING TO LOOSE
[1:39:39] LAZARUS.
[1:39:42] And oh MY, I BELIEVE THAT'S what the
[1:39:44] word does. When we come into a service
[1:39:46] like this morning or THURSDAY NIGHT,
[1:39:48] MAYBE A BIBLE STUDY OR WHENEVER WHENEVER
[1:39:51] THE WORD'S coming forth and your
[1:39:52] pastor's laboring under an inspiration,
[1:39:54] under an anointing, what he's doing is
[1:39:57] he's washing you. He's loosening you.
[1:40:00] And what's so incredible about that is
[1:40:03] that you can come with scars and leave
[1:40:05] out with no more scars.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; You can come in with hurts and leave
[1:40:09] healed. YOU CAN COME IN BROKENHEARTED.
[1:40:12] OH MY. HE'S COME TO HEAL THE
[1:40:14] BROKENHEARTED. HE'S COME TO TAKE AWAY
[1:40:17] TAKE AWAY THE MOURNING and give you a
[1:40:18] spirit of praise. Give you a spirit of
[1:40:20] take away the spirit of heaviness for
[1:40:22] the garment of praise to take away the
[1:40:24] mourning for the oil of joy. Oh
[1:40:26] hallelujah. That's what he's COME TO DO.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES we're hurt. We're human
[1:40:31] beings.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; You know, even the hardest of people are
[1:40:36] hiding sensitive issues in their hearts.
[1:40:39] Sometimes it's the hardest people, the
[1:40:42] ones that are hurt the most,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; right? And and I hope this is okay.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETIMES SCARS AND
[1:40:48] HURTS lay in there and you can put the
[1:40:50] suit on, you can put your nice dress on
[1:40:53] and you can come and everybody thinks,
[1:40:55] man, that is a SAINTLY CHRISTIAN, BUT ON
[1:40:57] THE INSIDE YOU'RE HURTING. YOU'RE A
[1:40:59] LIAR. YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIFE.
[1:41:01] YOU'RE NOT A SINNER. BUT YET THERE'S
[1:41:02] STILL SOME GRAVE clothes that is holding
[1:41:05] the heart where where you've been hurt.
[1:41:07] YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES UH LIKE TRUST ISSUES
[1:41:10] can come from a scar, can come from a
[1:41:12] hurt. Then you you get married and that
[1:41:14] trust issue is still there. It's because
[1:41:16] the devil's still trying to claim you,
[1:41:18] but the word can wash.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; The word CAN LOOSE. COMPLEXES CAN GO
[1:41:23] BACK TO A SCAR, go back to a hurt.
[1:41:25] Somebody can say something against you,
[1:41:27] call you fat or call you short, call you
[1:41:30] ugly, call you pretty, and then that can
[1:41:32] hurt a put a little hurt there on that
[1:41:34] heart, on that spirit man. And then that
[1:41:37] hurt can stay there and stay there and
[1:41:39] stay there and you're growing up. You
[1:41:40] grow up, you know, you can be married,
[1:41:42] have children, but yet that hurt is
[1:41:44] still there. And what that does, the
[1:41:47] devil has a foothold whenever we're
[1:41:50] still have a little bit of the grave
[1:41:51] clothes.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; But the word has come to wash.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; The word has come to loose.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; And you see, we're not perfect. WE'RE
[1:41:59] GOING TO HAVE MISTAKES.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:42:03] I'm just preaching a little bit this
[1:42:04] morning. You remember whenever Sarah
[1:42:07] [snorts] would be Sarahi, right? And the
[1:42:09] Bible says that God would change her
[1:42:12] name from Sarahi to Sarah. Brother
[1:42:13] Brandham says that was her princess
[1:42:15] name. And [snorts] you know what would
[1:42:16] happen after her name was changed? The
[1:42:19] Elohim would come to Abraham and would
[1:42:22] say at according to the time of life,
[1:42:23] you're going to have a baby. And here
[1:42:25] Sarah, not Sarahi, Sarah would be in the
[1:42:29] tent and would laugh. How can it be that
[1:42:32] that that me and my husband can have
[1:42:34] pleasure again when we're old? And the
[1:42:36] Lord was saying, "Why did Sarah laugh?
[1:42:38] NOT SARAHI. WHY DID SARAH LAUGH?" And
[1:42:42] Sarah would say, "I did not laugh." And
[1:42:44] he would say, "But you did laugh in your
[1:42:46] heart."
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS, "GOD WOULD HAVE
[1:42:48] STRUCK HER dead there, but first he
[1:42:51] would have to strike Abraham dead."
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; It was after the name change
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; that she was still making mistakes.
[1:42:59] AND SOMETIMES WE make mistakes and then
[1:43:02] that puts a puts a scar where where we
[1:43:05] don't feel worthy. We don't feel like
[1:43:06] we're not we don't feel good. We don't
[1:43:08] we don't feel like God's called us
[1:43:09] anymore. We don't feel like we're the
[1:43:11] bride of Christ. But little did Sarah
[1:43:14] know that in the the hall of fame, the
[1:43:17] hall of faith in the book of Hebrews,
[1:43:19] WHAT WOULD PAUL UH WHAT WOULD HE WRITE
[1:43:22] DOWN? Not by faith Sarah laughed, BUT BY
[1:43:25] FAITH Sarah counted HIM FAITHFUL. HER
[1:43:28] MISTAKE WASN'T THERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:43:30] WAS THERE? HER FAITH AND HER name
[1:43:32] change.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:43:36] YOUR MISTAKE IS NOT IN THE LAMB'S BOOK
[1:43:38] OF LIFE.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. WHAT IS IN THE LAMB'S BOOK
[1:43:43] OF LIFE IS YOUR NAME CHANGED.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; IS YOUR NAME. YOUR NAME IS ENGRAVED in
[1:43:48] the palm of HIS HAND.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT MAKE MISTAKES, BUT THAT DON'T
[1:43:52] DO AWAY WITH IT.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] PAUL DIDN'T SAY
[1:43:55] IN SARI BUT HE SAID SARAH EVEN THOUGH
[1:43:58] SHE MADE MISTAKES THAT DID NOT TAKE AWAY
[1:44:01] HER NAME change you remember PETER AND
[1:44:04] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE PETER was
[1:44:05] zealous Peter WAS SOMEBODY OH SIMON
[1:44:08] MEANS ZEALOT right it's here the LORD
[1:44:11] YOU KNOW WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I the son
[1:44:13] of man am some say this some say that
[1:44:16] who do YOU SAY IT WAS PETER THAT WOULD
[1:44:18] SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE CHRIST THE SON OF THE
[1:44:20] LIVING God and Jesus would say that
[1:44:22] you're no longer going to be Simon But
[1:44:24] you're going to be Peter, right? So he
[1:44:26] would COME FROM A ZEALOT. SIMON MEANS
[1:44:28] ZEALOT. PETER MEANS LITTLE STONE.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT GAVE HIM THIS NAME CHANGE WAS
[1:44:34] THE ROCK OF REVELATION, RIGHT? Jesus
[1:44:36] would SAY, "UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL BUILD
[1:44:37] MY CHURCH." AND THE GATES OF HELL WON'T
[1:44:39] PREVAIL. But the Brandon SAYS, "WHAT WAS
[1:44:41] THAT? WHAT WAS THAT ROCK?" It wasn't
[1:44:43] Peter. It wasn't even the man Jesus. IT
[1:44:45] WAS THE REVELATION OF WHO JESUS WAS. AND
[1:44:48] SO WHEN PETER RECOGNIZED
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THE PLACE OF HIS
[1:44:53] WORSHIP, IT WOULD CHANGE HIS NAME.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WORD DOES THE LITTLE STONE COME
[1:44:58] FROM? THE ROCK.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; SO ONCE HE REALIZED THE ROCK, HE WERE IT
[1:45:02] WOULD OPEN UP A REVELATION. YOU'RE a
[1:45:04] part of the rock.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You're a little stone. But you know what
[1:45:08] would happen? He would make a mistake.
[1:45:10] He would curse. He he would say he
[1:45:12] wouldn't even know Jesus. Now he's upon
[1:45:14] a upon a boat fishing naked. BUT YOU
[1:45:16] KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
[1:45:18] THERE WOULD COME SOME LADIES THAT WOULD
[1:45:20] COME AND AND WOULD COME TO THE SUPPLER
[1:45:22] AND THERE WOULD BE AND AND JESUS would
[1:45:23] meet them and would say, you know, uh,
[1:45:25] GO TELL MY DISCIPLES AND TELL SIMON, NO,
[1:45:29] go tell my little stone.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; GO TELL PETER HE FEELS LIKE A FAILURE
[1:45:33] RIGHT NOW. HE FEELS LIKE A NOBODY RIGHT
[1:45:36] NOW. HE FEELS LIKE HE'S HE'S BE HE'S
[1:45:38] SEND HIS DAY OF GRACE AWAY. HE FEELS
[1:45:41] LIKE HE'S BOUND FOR A TRIBULATION. HE
[1:45:43] FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO GRACE FOR HIM. BUT
[1:45:45] GO TELL HIM HE IS STILL A LITTLE STONE.
[1:45:49] TELL HIM HE IS STILL A PART OF
[1:45:50] [screaming] THE REVELATION. TELL HIM I
[1:45:54] HAVE STILL CALLED HIM. I'VE ELECTED HIM.
[1:45:56] I'VE CHOSEN HIM. HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:46:00] AND YOU MIGHT FEEL THAT WAY THIS
[1:46:01] MORNING. YOU MIGHT GOT SCARS. YOU MIGHT
[1:46:04] GOT HURTS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO
[1:46:06] WAY YOU'LL EVER BE LOVED. GOD WILL NEVER
[1:46:08] LOVE YOU. GOD WILL NEVER SAVE YOU. BUT
[1:46:10] YET, YOU'RE STILL A PART OF THE ROCK.
[1:46:13] YOU'RE STILL A PART OF THE THE ROCK OF
[1:46:15] REVELATION IN THIS GENERATION.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; OH, YOUR YOUR MISTAKES DON'T DEFINE YOU.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. YOUR PAST DON'T DEFINE YOU.
[1:46:23] YOUR FAILURES DON'T DEFINE YOU. HOW DOES
[1:46:25] GOD SEE YOU?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; HEY, I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH A LITTLE
[1:46:28] BIT. HOW DOES GOD SEE YOU?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, CUZ MANY TIMES WE LOOK AT
[1:46:32] OURSELVES THE WAY THE DEVIL LOOKS at us
[1:46:34] and WE FAIL TO SEE THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING
[1:46:36] AT US. YOU REMEMBER WHENEVER ELIJAH
[1:46:38] WOULD BE IN THE CAVE AND HE CRIES UNTO
[1:46:40] THE LORD, THEY'VE THEY they've tore DOWN
[1:46:42] YOUR ALTARS. THEY'VE DESTROYED ALL OF
[1:46:44] YOUR PRE ALL YOUR PROPHETS. AND WHAT
[1:46:46] WOULD THE LORD SAY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I
[1:46:48] STILL HAVE 7,000 THAT HAS NOT BOWED
[1:46:50] THEIR KNEE. HE WAS LOOKING AT THE
[1:46:52] SITUATION DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD
[1:46:55] WAS LOOKING AT IT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO
[1:46:57] LOOK THROUGH THE THINKING MAN'S FILTER.
[1:47:00] WHEN WE LOOK AT OURSEL, WE LOOK AT
[1:47:02] OURSEL THROUGH THE THE WAY GOD LOOKS AT
[1:47:04] US THROUGH GOD'S WORD. BECAUSE WE CAN
[1:47:06] HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF
[1:47:10] OURSELVES, BUT GOD'S LOOKING AND SAYING,
[1:47:12] "WHAT do you mean? You haven't sent your
[1:47:14] day of grace away. YOU'RE NOT UNWORTHY.
[1:47:16] I MADE YOU WORTHY. YOU'RE NOT UNLOVED.
[1:47:18] [screaming] I LOVED YOU WITH AN
[1:47:20] EVERLASTING LOVE AND WITH MY LOVING
[1:47:22] KINDNESS. I HAVE DRAWN THEE."
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU REMEMBER IT WAS
[1:47:26] GIDEON. WHENEVER AN ANGEL WOULD COME TO
[1:47:28] GIDEON, IT WOULD SAY, "YOU'RE a mighty
[1:47:30] man of valor." The word valor means
[1:47:32] wealthy. That means wealth. AND HERE
[1:47:34] GIDEON LOOKS BACK TO THE ANGEL AND SAYS,
[1:47:37] "I'M THE LEAST OF MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND
[1:47:38] MY FAMILY'S POOR." AND THE ANGEL SAYS,
[1:47:40] "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? [screaming]
[1:47:42] I'M GIVING YOU A MESSAGE OF WEALTH. QUIT
[1:47:44] LOOKING AT YOURSELF AS A NOBODY AND LOOK
[1:47:48] AT YOURSELF THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING AT
[1:47:50] YOU."
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; HEY, I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY.
[1:47:53] YOU GOT TO QUIT LOOKING AT YOURSELF
[1:47:54] THROUGH THE EYES OF MISTAKES, THROUGH
[1:47:57] THE FILTER OF OF FAULTS AND AND FAILURES
[1:47:59] AND AND PAST SINS, SINS, AND AND HURTS
[1:48:02] AND MISTAKES. AND AND LOOK AT YOURSELF
[1:48:05] THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; OH MY. GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU AS PERFECT.
[1:48:12] GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU LIKE BLAMELESS
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; and saying, "Devil, you may try, but
[1:48:17] you're going to be be the one that's
[1:48:18] judged for it."
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE JUDGED
[1:48:21] FOR YOUR MISTAKES. THE DEVIL is
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; oh the accuser of the brethren was cast
[1:48:26] down into the lake of fire and we
[1:48:28] condemned him by the word of our
[1:48:29] testimony and the blood of the LAMB OR
[1:48:31] WE CAST HIM DOWN BY THE BLOOD OF THE
[1:48:33] LAMB and the word OF OUR TESTIMONY. WHAT
[1:48:35] IS IT? WE MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH SOME
[1:48:37] HARD THINGS but the filter of God's word
[1:48:40] that's what's upon our lips.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Not our mistakes. You know, as our
[1:48:45] musicians come this morning, I
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; I remember a testimony
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; at [snorts] Louisiana camp. I believe
[1:48:52] there was a young lady that had tried
[1:48:55] committing suicide and she would have
[1:48:57] scars upon her wrists and that was a
[1:48:59] hurt that the devil plagued her with.
[1:49:02] She never felt like she can worship,
[1:49:04] never felt like she can raise her hands
[1:49:05] and and the [snorts] freedom of worship.
[1:49:08] And she would always bring her hands
[1:49:10] down. And it was at Louisiana camp one
[1:49:12] year that while she was in the presence
[1:49:14] of God that something would come over
[1:49:16] her heart and she would lift up her
[1:49:18] hands and condemnation would come
[1:49:20] through her heart. What's everybody
[1:49:21] going to think? What are they going to
[1:49:23] think when they see those scars? What
[1:49:24] are they going to think whenever they
[1:49:26] see your wrists? They're going to look
[1:49:27] at you differently. And she would raise
[1:49:29] those hands regardless. [snorts] And as
[1:49:31] she was worshiping the Lord, she would
[1:49:33] look at her wrists and those scars were
[1:49:35] gone.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE VERY CONDEMNATION THAT
[1:49:39] WAS condemning her heart, she would
[1:49:41] break free out OF IT.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; SO, I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIME,
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THE SCARS WERE AFRAID TO CAN
[1:49:49] TALK to somebody about
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; because what are they going to think of
[1:49:52] me? But you know, once whenever that
[1:49:55] scar is, how would I put it? Whenever
[1:49:58] the devil's exposed, he has no foothold
[1:50:00] in your life.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Scars can be a foothold. Mistakes can be
[1:50:04] a foothold. BUT ONCE THAT'S CONFESSED,
[1:50:07] ONCE THE HEART, IF IT'S AN ELDER OR YOUR
[1:50:10] PASTOR, PASTOR'S WIFE, WHOEVER IT MAY
[1:50:12] BE,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAM, SOMETHING HAPPENED WHEN I
[1:50:15] WAS A KID and and it's holding ME BACK.
[1:50:17] THEN WATCH there come a liberty in that
[1:50:19] situation.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; The devil loses its foothold. He likes
[1:50:22] to dwell in darkness and the secret of
[1:50:24] cover, right? BUT ONCE THAT'S EXPOSED,
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; ONCE THE HEART is exposed,
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; and then then there comes a light. Walk
[1:50:31] in the light.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; That's so true.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; I say this morning, whatever may be
[1:50:36] holding you back.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; He's here this morning to break every
[1:50:41] claim.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; He's here to heal every hurt.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; It might be a natural hurt, spiritual
[1:50:46] hurt. It might be a preacher that hurt
[1:50:48] you, you know, but the word of the Lord
[1:50:51] is here to wash.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Can y'all play something soft as we bow
[1:50:55] our heads this morning? [snorts]
[1:50:59] As our heads are bowed, maybe there
[1:51:01] there's somebody this morning that would
[1:51:02] say, "Brother Josh,
[1:51:04] I'm the one you were talking to this
[1:51:06] morning. [snorts]
[1:51:08] If you want to lift up your hands, the
[1:51:09] Lord sees Lord sees the hands. I've got
[1:51:12] scars. I've got hurts. I was hurt as a
[1:51:16] kid or hurt by a preacher. You You know
[1:51:18] the situation,
[1:51:20] maybe mistakes.

[1:51:28] And the devil's telling you, you're not
[1:51:30] worthy. You've sent your day of grace
[1:51:32] away.
[1:51:34] But let me say this. The word is here to
[1:51:36] wash. [snorts] It's here to loose.
[1:51:39] You may say, "I don't know what to do."
[1:51:41] Brother Josh, you know what I say?
[1:51:44] Brother Brandham says, "Lifting your
[1:51:45] hands is a sign of surrender."
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lift up those hands." It's I'm
[1:51:50] surrendering the hurt. I'm surrendering
[1:51:53] WHATEVER IS TRYING TO HOLD ME BACK.
[1:51:57] I'M GOING TO look through the filter of
[1:51:59] God's word.
[1:52:01] I GIVE THE WORD SUPREME authority in my
[1:52:04] life. I GIVE THE HOLY GHOST THE RIGHT
[1:52:06] AWAY. Dear heavenly father, LORD, YOU
[1:52:10] SEE THE HANDS ALL OVER THE BUILDING.

[1:52:38] But Lord, are you here to loosen us?
[1:52:43] Lord, you're here to break the binds of
[1:52:46] hidden sins.
[1:52:48] You're here to break the binds of the
[1:52:51] stronghold the devil has in young
[1:52:53] people.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe you're here right now to
[1:52:57] deliver a total deliverance.

[2:18:03] Amen. [music]

[2:19:19] [music]
[2:19:22] Circumstances are going to change.
[2:19:25] [music]
[2:19:26] The word [singing] has set it in motion.
[2:19:31] I'm looking with expectation.
[2:19:35] Amen.
[2:19:38] [music and singing]
[2:19:40] Oh hallelujah.
[2:19:44] [music and singing]
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:52] [singing and music]
[2:19:55] Amen.
[2:19:56] Amen.
[2:19:59] Amen.
[2:20:06] Hallelujah. [cheering] Praise the name
[2:20:08] of the Lord.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege it has been
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; to once again set in heavenly places.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Be washed by the water of the word.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. How powerful it is that
[2:20:25] it's the anointing as of the word of God
[2:20:27] in this hour. It changes conditions.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; That's what happened in Genesis 1.
[2:20:35] That's why it's so that's why it's so
[2:20:37] powerful in the preaching the word for
[2:20:40] the season
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; in this moment in this hour. It gives
[2:20:44] the grace for the people to rise.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; You see, because we're living in a time
[2:20:48] when there is no ceiling,
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; There is no ceiling. It's going on up
[2:20:53] into rapture.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the the headstone, the
[2:20:57] capstone has come. It's rising on up
[2:20:59] into him in all things. We're not called
[2:21:01] to a station. We're not called just to a
[2:21:03] point. There's not another message to
[2:21:05] come. We're living in this hour.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why a word is
[2:21:10] ministered for us to be able to rise
[2:21:12] into all that God has for us.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's powerful, isn't it?
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; We we all know what what that is. When
[2:21:21] there's a negative, we see it. You can
[2:21:23] see it all around you. you can get on
[2:21:24] and you know sometimes you can those of
[2:21:26] you that got social media and whatever
[2:21:28] more and you can it's no wonder like but
[2:21:31] they say in this day the amount of
[2:21:33] depression and everything else that it
[2:21:34] is people can get on there and they just
[2:21:36] get to looking at somebody else's feed
[2:21:38] and they get down
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; but there's there's a better report.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; These are things that in this hour it
[2:21:44] really don't take a lot of rocket
[2:21:46] scientists just simple things look at
[2:21:48] the right source.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. tune out the other things and tune
[2:21:53] in on the Lord. Amen. And I believe God
[2:21:56] I believe God zeros our hearts in right
[2:21:59] into his word. And you say, "Brother
[2:22:00] Samuel, is that really all that's
[2:22:02] needed?" Let me tell you something.
[2:22:04] Inside of Jesus Christ is the answer for
[2:22:07] all of life's questions.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; God didn't send this message is not an
[2:22:12] addition to the Bible. This message is
[2:22:15] the Bible revealed.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This message is not an added book.
[2:22:20] That's why when people say, "Well, we're
[2:22:21] going to get people to Christ and then
[2:22:22] we'll get them to the message." They've
[2:22:24] missed the They've missed what the
[2:22:25] message is. The message is Christ.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; It's God that's revealed himself to you
[2:22:32] and I to be the same yesterday, today,
[2:22:35] and forever. And what a comfort it
[2:22:38] brings to our heart. I I tell you right
[2:22:39] here, right here this morning, whatever
[2:22:41] you've come in here with on your heart
[2:22:44] and let the word of God that has just
[2:22:46] come to just so lift and push back every
[2:22:48] cloud of doubt and everything about
[2:22:51] whether you're worthy or you're not
[2:22:52] worthy. The word of God is what makes
[2:22:54] you and I worthy.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how you walked in
[2:22:58] here. It's how you walk out of here.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; It's a choice that's been made. The
[2:23:02] Lord, I receive your word. And I I tell
[2:23:05] you that just kept ringing in my heart
[2:23:07] as the brother was preaching. Even now
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; even now. You know sometimes you can I
[2:23:14] can talk with sometimes individuals and
[2:23:17] people even situations that's outside of
[2:23:19] this this church and you begin to talk
[2:23:21] with a person and you wonder do you have
[2:23:23] any hope or any outlook for the
[2:23:25] situation that even you're working with?
[2:23:29] But I'll tell you, this is what I simply
[2:23:31] believe that the grace of God has no
[2:23:35] limitations.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bram said it. He
[2:23:38] said, "Soververeign can do what
[2:23:40] sovereign wants to do.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Nobody tells sovereign what to do.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; There's no limitations to God's grace."
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; So, what are you saying, brother Samuel?
[2:23:50] Whatever the need is upon your heart,
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; there's no limitations for God meeting
[2:23:56] that need. You can just say, "Lord, just
[2:23:59] remedy everything. If there's anything
[2:24:01] in me, Lord, that would be in any way
[2:24:03] out of line with that. Remedy it all so
[2:24:06] I can look with a clear expectation so
[2:24:08] that even as I go to look tomorrow
[2:24:10] morning or today after church, my
[2:24:12] expectation just continues to grow." And
[2:24:14] you watch how God will just continue to
[2:24:16] channel that word. God will continue to
[2:24:18] minister because his word, it's coming
[2:24:20] to pass.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; I could say it like this. His word's
[2:24:23] materializing.
[2:24:25] [laughter]
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're here. I'm here. His word's
[2:24:28] materializing. This is as the prophet
[2:24:30] said, Elohim materializing in a body of
[2:24:34] believers.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love him?
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it's in simplicity. It's
[2:24:39] in such simplicity. It's actually looked
[2:24:41] down upon. It's despised. And but yet,
[2:24:43] it's in such simplicity how God is
[2:24:45] working. And I love how the Lord took it
[2:24:47] right there through Brother Josh. It's
[2:24:48] God walking right with you into the
[2:24:50] school. It's God walking with you right
[2:24:52] into the workplace. It's God right
[2:24:54] there. Listen, you are the greatest
[2:24:57] miracle.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said the greatest miracle.
[2:25:02] He said where God can take a person that
[2:25:04] the dogs wouldn't even howl their name.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; He said but you let the presence of God
[2:25:09] come into that person's life, it changes
[2:25:11] their life,
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; And like somebody can say about your
[2:25:16] name and they remember you a certain way
[2:25:17] and they they bring up that name. Are
[2:25:19] you talking about so and so? Then
[2:25:20] they'll ask for the surname. But once
[2:25:23] the testimony is just meet them, just
[2:25:26] talk with them,
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; just get with them a little bit. Then
[2:25:28] you realize, wait a minute,
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; what I used to know I it's the same old
[2:25:32] shell, but what's moved into this into
[2:25:35] this house is a different person.
[2:25:37] [laughter]
[2:25:38] Amen. There's a different reputation
[2:25:40] going on. It's Jesus Christ the same
[2:25:43] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. The
[2:25:46] glory of God being revealed. Oh my. It's
[2:25:50] not us. It's not you changing you. It's
[2:25:52] the word of God that we're receiving.
[2:25:55] It's changing us.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where our confidence is at,
[2:25:58] isn't it? Our confidence has been taken
[2:26:00] away from any church, from any idea. Our
[2:26:02] our confidence is in Christ the word.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love him this morning?
[2:26:09] It's been so good to be here in his
[2:26:10] presence. And I'll tell you,
[2:26:13] just keep looking. Just keep with that
[2:26:16] expectation with whatever the need and
[2:26:18] whatever it is, keep looking. God is
[2:26:21] faithful to fulfill what he has said.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; If something comes along, it tries to
[2:26:28] take away from that a discouraging
[2:26:30] thought or even something you see, do
[2:26:33] you know what you need to do? Just take
[2:26:34] that seaweed out of your mouth and keep
[2:26:36] looking to the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[2:26:39] what you need to do. Keep anything, any
[2:26:41] distraction comes a late, just push that
[2:26:42] right. And you know what you call that?
[2:26:44] A lying vanity.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Because it's Why? Why is it lying? It
[2:26:47] could seem so real, but when God's
[2:26:49] promise has been made real, that's a
[2:26:51] lying vanity.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham's crookedness may have got more
[2:26:56] real of a morning, but he called it a
[2:26:58] lying vanity.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; And we're Abraham's seed. [laughter]
[2:27:04] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[2:27:08] Lord who against hope believed in hope
[2:27:10] that he might be the father of many
[2:27:12] nations. Amen. Brother Josh, thank you.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Wonderful. [applause]
[2:27:17] Wonderful.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:22] Amen. We have been [cheering] We have
[2:27:24] thoroughly been blessed. What a
[2:27:25] masterpiece.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful word from the
[2:27:28] Lord. Amen. This morning. Amen. So, you
[2:27:31] take our greetings back to Brother
[2:27:33] Wendle.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your mom, your family, church.
[2:27:37] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts in a
[2:27:39] word of prayer. And my we have so much
[2:27:41] to be thankful for. Heavenly Father, oh
[2:27:45] dear Lord Jesus, how we are so so
[2:27:48] grateful for your mercies, Lord.
[2:27:51] Oh Lord, truly they are new every
[2:27:54] morning. And what a refreshing it is,
[2:27:57] Lord, as we come into your presence,
[2:28:01] Lord Jesus. We have
[2:28:04] been gathered, Lord, to your table,
[2:28:07] Lord. Right here under the word is where
[2:28:10] the clouds are broke back that
[2:28:13] attributes can express themselves.
[2:28:16] It's where doubt is dispersed
[2:28:19] and where the light shines through.
[2:28:21] Lord, it's where you come, Lord, and and
[2:28:24] breathe upon your children. Lord God,
[2:28:27] you speak your word, Lord, of over our
[2:28:29] lives.
[2:28:31] And that word is the anointing.
[2:28:34] It changes. It changes the atmosphere.
[2:28:38] So, heavenly father, even right here
[2:28:40] this morning, for every need, every
[2:28:43] request, maybe someone's praying about a
[2:28:45] loved one, maybe there Lord, whatever
[2:28:48] that request is, no matter how it might
[2:28:52] look, may that be the words like Mary
[2:28:55] said or Martha, even now, Lord, even
[2:29:00] now. And Lord, it's your word spoken in
[2:29:04] season that has breathed a real
[2:29:08] confidence in our hearts even now. How
[2:29:11] we thank you for your mercies, Lord.
[2:29:13] Once again, thank you, Father. May you
[2:29:16] go with your children, be with Brother
[2:29:17] Josh and Sister Loretta, Lord, as they
[2:29:20] would be traveling, Lord. And Father,
[2:29:23] the different places, Lord, they would
[2:29:25] go. I pray that God, you would
[2:29:27] strengthen and refresh our brother. Dear
[2:29:30] God, we so appreciate the gift, Lord. We
[2:29:32] appreciate all of all of your gifts,
[2:29:34] Lord. Father, everyone is vital to your
[2:29:38] body, Lord. And we are we are so
[2:29:40] thankful, God, for the great diversity,
[2:29:43] Lord, that you have placed among us. And
[2:29:45] that, Lord, a life that would yield that
[2:29:47] you could step down and speak to our
[2:29:49] hearts, Lord. Lord Jesus, we've heard
[2:29:53] from you this morning once again, and we
[2:29:55] want to say thank you, Father. Thank you
[2:29:58] for Lord the word of encouragement Lord
[2:30:01] God that you have spoke to our hearts.
[2:30:03] Thank you father. Now Lord may you go
[2:30:05] with your children many requests upon
[2:30:08] upon hearts and now may we look with an
[2:30:12] clear expectation for that word to come
[2:30:15] to pass. We love you and we thank you
[2:30:17] father in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen
[2:30:21] and amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
