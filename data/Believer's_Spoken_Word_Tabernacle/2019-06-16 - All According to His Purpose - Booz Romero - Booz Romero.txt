control we give you a loner in glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father we ask you to bless us as we speak about you as we share something from you father because as human beings we don't have anything good from from us further but everything that comes from you father that is what we want this morning we ask you to bless us as we read your word father bless your children as they hear your word father may we not not be used by hearers of the word but may we be doers of the word this morning bless your children and bless the one that is here speaking father thank you so much for everything that you have done for us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and we all can say how many can say Amen this morning a man we're happy to be here in the house of the Lord you may have your seats just for for just for one minute and I'm happy to be here and especially this morning and I'm so grateful to your past pastor for the confidence to be here and this time by the first time I want to introduce to you all my wife so you want to stand up then so I know brother Steve Steve reason what was with you on Thursday he told me well I was telling brother Samuel that you that and he was telling me that you were excited because you were coming with your wife well I am beyond excited you know Amen because we know that the Lord everything is beautiful like Under the Sun and and he makes everything beautiful and mint and he made a wife for me and I'm happy to be here and it is almost a year you're willing in let's say twenty days we're gonna be celebrating our first year and it's been a good year and then gave him a writer in that it's good it's good to get near amen so we're happy to be here and now let's always stand and I'm so grateful with your pastor for the confidence to asking us to be here he wanted me to be here in May we couldn't make it in May but now we're here and everything it just has to has to be in the Lord time not not late not not before nor not sooner or later but everything is in his time and men so you have your Bibles if we can go to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 when you have it you can say Amen so in whom we are in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worked all things after the counsel of his own will amen everything is after his own will amen so and then the book of Romans 8:28 it says and we know we know that all things work for good all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose Amen you came you may have your seats so I was telling my wife this morning I was like well I know what the Lord wants wants to tell us or when what he I was confident on what he wanted me to speak for you this morning but yesterday we had a few fellowship with some of the youth here and while I was talking to them the Lord said no now you're going this way so I'm like Lord but I already have my notes for the other one and he's like no but you're going this other way so I'm like okay Lord we just want to be willing and we want to be sensitive to what you want to speak to us this morning he meant so the lawyers good amen so brother Reacher sister Maria we've been praying for your your granddaughter and I use one I tell you one thing sometimes we ask for a miracle and we say Lord heal her Lord do it do it this way but I have learned one thing and it's like Lord why don't we pray for your perfect wheel it's a little bit different isn't it because we want we want we want a miracle we want we want we want her to be fully recovered but this morning I would like to invite you to pray Lord what is brother Brennan it speaks about it is like sometimes it is just to bring us closer to God amen so whatever situation you're going through this morning it is just to bring you closer to the Lord so that is what we want to speak this morning amen I had something but the Lord said something else so I am I use one a titled is called according to his purpose this morning we are called according to his purpose Amen so if I if I can start this with this kind of little illustration there was this huge battle going on and you know back in the way they had musicians or they have like I know somebody that was in the battle with them and they were playing some music so they will keep the soldiers they will keep them kind of excited going because they were going to possess something amen so but in this specific instance when they were they were fighting and in the end in the general he saw that they were losing he started telling the guy that was playing the trumpet the trumpet he told him hey you know what please play this song to go back please play the song to go back and he was just playing this song to go onwards and then until they defeated the enemy and then and and then and after you know after they kind of were rejoicing on what happened is like they asked him why didn't you play the song to go back and he said a very simple answer and he said because I don't know it because I didn't know it so that is the same message for us this morning if the enemy's car is coming to you this morning and is telling you to go back you don't know that word the only word that we know this morning is to go forward amen the only thing that we know this morning is that he is the same yesterday today and he he is still the same today he's the same yesterday but he is still the same today I mean we should be content this morning to know that Lord you are my healer you are my Redeemer you're my everything this morning and I don't know the word defeat I know the word the work says that I am an overcomer this morning amen I'm so happy to know this morning that in the midst of these insane age I have a sound mind this morning I have a mind and that King worship the work is work I have a heart that that is sensitive to the Word of God this morning a lot of people they are losing that that's incense that sensitivity for the world but this morning you know as we just hear something from him I just want him to come and speak to my heart this morning I just want him to tell me that he is here this morning and he is not just here without a purpose he is here with a purpose in my life this morning she is here to restore the ones that have fallen before but now you can say I am seated now in heavenly places you can say this morning that you are redeemed you can say this morning that you have been restored you can say that you can see your back earning you can see that you came from a broken family but guess what now you are in the family of God and in the family of God there is a father there is a mother and he's the same he's my father he's my mother he is my everything this morning that is the purpose of God for us this morning amen so this morning I can tell you I don't know what I don't know the word defeat I know the word that I am an overcomer amen we're happy to know to be here you know a little bit stress and thinking about that you know in yesterday my wife would like your hands are cold and like yeah when I get a stress on my hands can get cold and my hands are cold right now just pray for me this morning amen amen so let's think a little bit about the life of Joseph and we're gonna go through his life a little bit I I don't want to keep you too long and I know these are Sundays a Father's Day it allows you to all our fathers may the Lord bless you and especially when you have a godly father amen a father that love the Lord a father that have you know endure everything but that they love the Lord we are grateful for that this morning a man I have one that is in Mexico and he sends his greetings brother Marcelo you may remember him he sends his greetings and and he's still fighting the good fight amen and we're let's think a little bit about the life of Joseph and you know he had a calling but before that the the prophecy came to his his predecessors he came to Abraham like I will make of you like a big nation and your sea will possess the gates of your enemies and although although all of those things and it was good to know that it was good to know it in it together as an information but it meant I I can have all the tapes I can possess the gates of its enemies and and he was content he was happy with that but until he came to face a trial then we see how he reacted and he reacted the right way Amen so we can say that after his you know like he had some dreams and everything that was going well for him and these were all kind of types and shadows of something that was that was coming they meant so when when they come to this this this position his brothers they were like you know what you're too much we have to do something with you so after his brothers they planned to kill him they planned to kill him and they put him in the pit you know like they put him there and and they took his seven color garment and they they stained it with that with blood and everything they brought it to the Father letting the father know that that his his son was dead but he wasn't the heavy man he was there in the PA and then they saw him and in and and and that there is a purpose there was a purpose for Joseph to be there he meant that's what we were saying that they they who are predestinated according to the purpose of him Joseph was predestinated occurred according to the purpose of God for a reason Amen because remember that they are in the Old Testament kind of all those were examples of the New Testament and then from the New Testament all those were examples of the church that was supposed to come now amen so how many times you have had situations where you're facing you know like somebody's rejecting you or somebody is is kind of saying it speaking lies about you and every see and that is what happened with Joseph amen I can tell you one thing the lorry had a purpose over the life of Joseph many times we were going through a rough situation we just look at our current state we just look at our current situation but how many times have we as a Lord to show the big picture what's his purpose when we're going through the trial what does he want to show us this morning Oh what can we say this morning Lord when I'm going through an emotional trial because this the word also have come to heal my emotions the Lord also have come to heal my mind amen he has come to heal not just your your your your spirit your natural body but also to healed your mind also to heal your spirit also to heal your soul that you can forgive those that have done you wrong my brother was preaching in our church and he was saying divine love love its enemies its enemies and we have to get to that point amen so what can we say when we're going through a trial or translation that we say Lord why me why am I going through these why wouldn't that other person that is not faithful well the Lord loves you because he wants to try your faith he wants to try your your life and say okay where are you standing are you really trusting in me that even if it is not according to your your expectation you are still going to believe on me that's what I'm saying is that we look at the at the small picture but we don't know at the big we don't look at the big picture where we're on what he wants to show us this morning but now we can see Joseph as an example or as as as a shadow of the Lord Jesus Christ that he was brought to the pit he meant after he died he went he went to preach to those lost the souls that were in prison amen and but he that was not the resulting thing so he had to be there and then he was rose again amen so now what can we say here Psalms 34 17 and 19 and it says the righteous cry and the Lord hear them and deliver them out of out of all their troubles your righteous this morning he's gonna deliver you this morning and then it says in the next verse it says the Lord is night unto them that are of a broken heart how many have had a broken heart I can say amen amen situations trials in life my car has been broken but the Lord is nigh to me this is not if he was nice to me he was close to me at the time and he is still close to you this morning and he saved those those that have a contract a spirit so in other words I was selling the church in in in in Toledo it is not bad to have a broken heart it is not bad to be sad it is not bad to be you know if a contracted spirit because those are the ones that the Lord is seeking to come and heal because many times we hear preachers or people that say no you're supposed to confess everything you know like you that you're not going to any trial that you're going through any situation yeah we are we're as long as we we're still in this human flesh we're going to still fighting ever every inch of the territory it's not bad to say that you're facing something that they've got the wrong position is to stay there the wrong position is a juicer playing the song of defend the position that we as believers are supposed to have this morning is to say Lord I'm facing these but being be by your other I'm gonna process what is mine this morning what do you have this morning that you can say I need to possess this this morning whether it is your mind or people dealing with things that pornography or hard feelings bitterness whatever it is this morning the Lord is giving you a chance to say I'm done with this I wanna go I want to go forward with the Lord that's why I said you can go to trials you can go to tribulations and praise the Lord for those because those are just molding us unto the stature of the perfect man but don't dwell in your mistake that is the one thing that I have learned when you go in your mistake and you start having those pity parties with the enemy when you say all you know what yeah yeah I'm defeated I'm a loser and this and that but whatever you're confessing that will become your possession this morning but as I said it is not bad to go through a trial it is not it is not a wrong thing to go to a tribulation because he's nearby you he's the Bible says you're my authoritarian like he draw nigh to me and I will draw nigh to you cry out to me and I and I will come back will come to you and I will answer you this morning what is your trial what is your tribulation what is your mind battle that you're going through this morning that he's not able to conquer that he's not able to bring the solution there is nothing impossible with God what is what Delian said Lord at thy word I'm gonna go and I'm gonna possess what is ours where was Gil he was given he was like in he was like yes Lord the angel came the word came the word the word gave him up as a commission and he was still doubting it's okay he's it is okay to the hour but underling your doubt because many people that's where the enemy comes and get you and then people get discouraged and that's why they leave Church but I'm not like those that are kind of those are going backwards I'm going like I'm I am part of that are going forward with the Lord I am part of those that said that sale or even though even I'm going through a big trial this morning ler I know that I know that I know that you are my healer I know that you are going to vote with me in the middle of my trial that is his promise at the end of the day this word I can tell you this morning this word he doesn't have any other purpose taught to me in my life I was telling the youth in my back in in church and I was telling them like all these divine love all this tests the virtues of the Podesta the stature of the perfect man those are not to be those we are going to those are not for me to use them when I am on the other side on the other side everything is perfection I need them to fight a good battle here I need temperance to fight to fight the enemy here I need virtue to fight the enemy here what do you need this morning I ask from the Lord amen and the Lord says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivered them out of them all oh boy but like and as as we sing sometimes it's like not always as I would but always for my good that is how she's going to liver me from my trials but we are we happy to know that this morning Lord out of my tribulations are of might and temptations out of my afflictions you're gonna deliver me because that is your promise I love all of them he will deliver you from for the random says and sometimes we have more travels when we become a Christian than when we did when we were sinners isn't that right isn't that true amen when you were having you know there your drinking is smoking and having a big time and the enemy wouldn't bother you because you already had you but now that he doesn't have you the law is gonna allow him to come against you and the prophet of God says God promised many afflictions strange feelings and strange things that will be the on our understanding but it is always on for our good because you know that the street the situation the trial you are facing the only thing that is it is working in you is that you kind of keep growing in the law and I can tell you another thing that when you're facing that trial that is not even for for your for your benefit is for the benefit of somebody else because if somebody else will face the same now you can come in witness to them and say I went through that and I did it this way that's and it happened to you it happened to me that way amen the prophet of God says we just can't understand it because if we did then that wouldn't wouldn't be a faith to us we wouldn't go we will go we'll just with understanding amen but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith his word that it is going to work some good things for us he says and there is none of us immune for a from them just talking about the trial says the tribulations and if we could realize that those things are for our good he said that would be a good thing amen but what can we say they write the name of the Lord it is a strong tower and their righteous will run into that tower and they're gonna be saved talking about the righteous it like it doesn't matter it like if you're a righteous man you're gonna go to see through tribulation through situations but remember you are called according to his purpose all or what a great purpose you have for my life amen now look Praful Oh God says in the message I know he says it is those those hard hours that presses on to those sacred to those sacred hints in other words like when you're in depth in the greatest viral or the creator's situation in your life the only thing that your tribulation or your situation is doing he's just pressing you or sending you to his hands it was in the Bible and remember no matter how the distress is Satan cannot take your life until God has finished with you there is nothing that can happen to you unless God permits that there is no evil that can come unless God permits that and it is for your good and he is working that and we say amen to that it is for your good I'm like Laura you sit for really for my good yes it is for your good amen now look Jockamo Joseph his brother insults all him because they were they were have some Yellow Sea against him and now he was sold to the house of Potiphar and what well he was there he became you know because when God with somebody it doesn't matter where they are they will always be prosperous so here we have Joseph he's at Potiphar's house and then his wife he was always hey come and be with me come and be with me you know and he was always you know extending the trial and he's like no this is not for me because you're my my Master's wife you're his possession I know that I can I can use everything else but not his wife because his wife is his possession but you know every single day she was kind of after him in after him and after him until one day nobody was at the house he had the opportunity because nobody was there he made but what he did he ran away from me because there was a purpose in his life that he was going to be without seeing or he was going to be blameless before the Lord amen and what happened then he was sent to prison because somebody lied about him how many times we have faced these situations with somebody can say a lie about us and then we use feel down well look at what Joseph's attitude was he somebody lied about him and then he was sent to prison because and there was no justice because he he wasn't to prison for something that was unfair but even in prison Genesis 39 23 he says the keeper of the prison look not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him in that which he did the Lord made it to prosper even in prison the Lord may may may Joseph's life stay to be prospered even make when you may feel that you are in a pre in a prison or in a situation your life is going to prosper I'm not talking I'm talking and spiritually I'm talking like that you're gonna keep growing in Christ I can tell you one thing if you have noticed something here is that everywhere Joseph was despite his trial the scripture was being fulfilled many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivered them out of them all he was a righteous man he was he respected part of our house he respected his brethren but in the middle of that the Lord was delivering delivering him from all of that all or helped us this morning that that may be major may we be your righteous in yours may we be righteous in your sight having that promise that our tribulation you will await that in our tribulation you will always be present and set us free how many can say that Lord when I have found the greatest battle ever fought in my mind you are there to set me free how many people don't raise your hand but you may have been in the virtual community suicide and the Lord was there to set you free out of that how many times you were in a position where you were like you know what I'm done with Church I'm done with the pastor I'm done with the musicians I'm going with these with that in the other and the Lord said no no no you gotta come to church you gotta be humble and we're here this morning those are tribulations or if those are afflictions and again I'm not talking about the natural stuff because we all can face that but I want to make sure that when we talk about the spiritual real we are free from the enemy why because even you know a job said job said he said that you know I know my Redeemer liveth and he's like even if they destroy my flesh I will see God because he's his so he says spirit it was energy in a different sphere in a different atmosphere and our is where we are aiming for this morning Lord if they come and destroy this flash that's okay Lord but don't let them destroy what you have build in my heart because that has an eternal destination and it is sealed until the day of our Redemption how many can say this morning I have received the holy water the Holy Ghost of my inheritance and I know that nothing not hell not not that not the things that are higher the things that are above no no principalities no nothing will be able to separate me from the love of God nothing can break that feel that God has put in your heart Amen because when he puts that seal in your heart he says this is a finished product and thank you saying why if a missile is traveling with this yes and as I said because you're still in this flesh but the one that is inside is already still for his eternal destination the one that is inside he has a purpose he has been called according to the purpose of God amen what your trial was your tribulation that the Lord cannot come and deliver you from now there is nothing impossible with God it was told to Sarah Sarah there is nothing impossible with God Sarah was like well but you know like my must my My Lord he is 99 years old and I'm serving time in 89 or 75 ma is 75 and 65 and like in according to lore time you're going to have a son a son and then like 25 years later Abraham was still confessing the same thing and Sarah was still doubting but I can tell you one thing when the Lord came Elohim came down and he spoke you know like the last sign to the Gentiles what was that they secret the revealing of the secrets of the heart and then when her heart was revealed the Lord who could have killed her but he couldn't heal her because she was part of Abraham so I can tell you that this morning the enemy nobody can touch you this morning because you are part of your heavenly Father this morning what am I going to be oppressed because of the enemy this morning if I have a savior that have overcome everything this morning are you press this morning are you troubling your mind that's okay I can tell you but now you can come to the altar you can come to him and you can say lord help me as that guy say care of my unbelief and he helped them did he help them yes he did what can he do for you this morning if I can tell you this morning what your trial was your tribulation that he cannot come in here and and and mend a broken heart he can do everything he wants he can heal your granddaughter yet right now he can do it who you have to say Lord what's your will what's your purpose were these but your purpose are my trial this morning he's good isn't he I was there with the musicians but they were praying I was a you static cry and I say Lord thank you so much because that we have your word that we can still comment here from you the pure word they unadopted altar word of God amen I mean they're grateful for that for a pastor that is still you know is standing for this word standing for the pure word of the hour should be grateful for that in support the ministry man now look Joseph they had then after he was imprisoned and he had the you know the cupbearer in the in the in the baker and they had a dream here he interpret the dream for them and everything and then he told him remember me when you're back in the Kenda and they forgot him but the Lord never forgets even if people will forget you this morning he will never forget him amen he is my father he is my mother he's my everything this morning look now he was imprisoned after ringing the interpretation you know today to the Baker in the cupbearer in he then they remember one of them remember because the other one was his his head was caught and one of them remembering he well you know what I remembered that there was a little pastor there he in the in that little corners a corner store Church that he spoke the truth and I gave my heart to the Lord why don't you bring him in let him speak and then but Luke when somebody is cool according to the purpose of God they will always give God the praise they will always give God his place they will always recognize that it is not them that have a gift but if it is the Lord that has has a gift for their lives when they came here to when Joseph came before the Pharaoh he told him I cannot interpret this dream amen he is like because that you know the others they wanted him to to let them know the dream and that they could bring interpretation but Joseph was not a way neither Daniel was that way they were like you know what the God of heaven the God of my of my father Abraham they got of my father Isaac Isaac and Jane and Jacob and he is the one that can can interpret interpret this dream then he told him Genesis 41 39 that was now this is Pharaoh speaking and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God has shown you all these things there is none so discreet in wise as thou art thou shall be over my house and according unto me thy war shall all be my people shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than death and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have said the over all the land of Egypt now look it was being said over the land of Egypt in Farah took off his drink from his hand input on Joseph's hand and array him investors of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck all his trials all his temptations all all his tribulations were being paid off he was now by the right hand of fair and I was saying these the other day Luke what was taking place here it was a time of adoption for Joseph after all the tribulations he went through he was being adopted he was being found as a true son of God and then if we ask how does a child was adopted in the old time they have to go to a process of testing and learning and they and then and then the master is going to come in and give the report to their father and say well he is not ready yet he's not ready he is not ready he was wait a little bit but what can we say here for Joseph the time king that he was ready to be somebody to be the son of favor if you if you want to see it that way but when they they have to like in in that time they have to go through a testing and learning mainsheet making sure that the child has the characteristics of the father and that he was going to take care of the father of business does this sound familiar it was like the prodigal son he was put on new ropes having new shoes but those are ring means our ring I can say it means out thirty what those new shoes mean new shoes new shoes mean the possession of the world what does the Rope mean that is a word that is playing in the believer that is being placed in the believer amen he was position as an adopted son of God praise the Lord while working we say this morning Lori might be in position are you really trusting in me this morning amen amen he was position he was adopted but now the main thing or the greatest trial was coming for Joseph it was not when he was in the pit it was not where he was impressive it was not now that when he was in Joseph's house it was now where he was going to face his siblings when he was going to face his brothers why because there's where he could say this is time to pay backwards to pay forward this is my time this is my hour when I'm gonna pay them were all what they did but he didn't have that attitude Janice is 45 birds for two verse 8 and it says and Joseph said unto his brethren come near to me I pray and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you saw into Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves and that you saw me here heater heater I mean for God did send me for you to preserve life that was the purpose that was Joseph green coal according to the purpose of God for this what was it to preserve life for these two years have the family and the family been in the land and yet there are five years in the which ye there shall neither be hearing nor harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance what was happening here was heaping paying for or paying them back for what they have done No why because he was a special type of caliber of person that's why the Lord he he will Chuck he will choose just a few because he knows that those are the type of they have a caliber of people that they can they can do the right thing if I if I ask you this morning what would you have done if somebody has done all what they did to Joseph Lord change my heart amen what was the purpose that he had to go through all that tribulation Joseph he was to preserve the life even to the ones that had that hated the things that they were meant for evil where for the good of many and there was the children of God the prophet of God says the deserts and the in the winds this corpse should the scorpions and the cobras in in alone out in the wilderness till he almost perish there is nothing in this this I love there is nothing that can defeat the purpose of God can something defeat the purpose of God no God has brought Moses forth and Moses had to do what what God told him to do because gasps purpose cannot be defeated I mean he can say amen to that God's purpose cannot be defeated now if I can ask you this morning what is what is his purpose because we read it in the in the book of officials according to the purpose of God according to his will in brother Branham speaks and he says there is a three-fold purpose of God what is the first purpose amen is to reveal himself to the people amen the first thing he says that was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Yahoo by God who cover all his face all time all eternity couldn't do that but he he is too great to be even revealed to people because it would be too mysterious amen how cool that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of lighted space that God that infinite God that eternity an eternal God how could he reveal to people and then the prophet of God says the reason how he revealed revealed himself to us first is because he loved to be a father he loved to be he says he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man amen that is the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man the son of men they didn't know what he was talking about many of them he meant but now you get it he wants to he wanted to express himself as a father he wanted to be a father for many that's what we can say this morning he is my father that is the first purpose that he had when when he was kind of when he created all these great plan is like how can I can I be close to them I wanna have a relationship with them I want to be a father to them amen that's why also he created Eden and there he put Adam and Eve and she was a father to them it was Jehovah now God dwelling with his family but that was not enough Rainie that's not enough no because there were more attributes that needed to be revealed in those attributes you were part of those attributes is mourning and even more than that he needed to be a savior but in order for heavy for him to be a savior there had to be something that had to be lost he needed to be a healer but another in order for him to be a healer there was there needed to be somebody to be to be it that needed to be sick but even greater than that he wanted to be a mine delimiter but in order for that to happen there was something that will have kind of mine my battle this morning that he wants to reveal himself as that then we say deliverer we make her all of that we say seeing it very beautifully but how how real is that zombie coming to our lives he was to one of the main purpose was to express himself I identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ because he couldn't say I am the lord that healeth thee if he will never experience what was to be to be sick or or to be to Cara disease that's what he became in Christ did Jesus had headaches I will say so did Jesus cry yes he cried the he captain tation temptations yes he caught them but the Bible says that in everything he was perfect what was that he was to show himself to us as the father the son the father what it was the father in the creation he was he was showing himself to them but I was not enough prophet of God says what is the second purpose he wants to have the preeminence the preeminence in the body of believers amen now from being the father baby or being being Jesus now he wants something else now he wants to dwell he wants to have the preeminence in his children how many children are here this morning and I love this topic and I'm gonna say it this morning Matthew 10 Jesus goes and he commissioned he commissioned a the disciples and he told him go and preach and heal and cure and cured a day all of them he can we read it this morning Matthew chapter 10 look chapter 10 verse 5 and it says these twelve send them forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not that's Charlie Matthew 10:5 why am I saying this because he's telling then golden he'll go to the lost sheep of Israel but don't go you don't go to the Samaritans don't go to the Gentiles and one thing that I have noticed that every single time Jesus was it got kind of West tire of his journeys he will go to the Gentiles isn't that wonderful because that is when when when that Sarah Phoenician woman came to him and she said Lord healed my mama I was I think was his daughter he says like it is not worthy for me to give the bread of the children to the dogs and she says like Lord yes I know I am a dog she recognized her condition but she says Lord but out of the master's table the dogs they eat the crumbs that fall from there and she says like oh I haven't heard such faith on in all Israel so woman and he said go and let your child be healed amen that was the first instance and then he told him to go to the way of the Samaritans and then when he was in John chapter 4 Jesus was tired and he went he and I and I preached this the other day and he needed to go by Samaria who was in Samaria there was this woman that she was he had something in her heart that needed to be changed but she came to the wrong source rivers of living water we're inside of her she didn't know that how can what can we say this morning if the rivers of living water are not in us this morning but then what is it bring me a drink then she said Lord why why do you are you asking me to give to bring you a drink if Jews and Samaritans we don't fellowship we don't get along with each other and he asked and he talking if you will know who is asking you you you will ask him and out of your belly rivers of living living water will flow out of you and I love this because Jesus told the disciples don't go there but I will what is he doing this morning that's why they we can say that the message for the disciples was for just for the Jews the time but it was there was a greater work that he needed to do in himself and that's why he's cleared this morning that's why his here's killing the broken hearts that what he's here he's healing the broken minds because it is his work it is nobody else's work but it is his work he says you guys don't go but I will go can he meet your need this morning yes he can this morning because he says I will go he's expressing himself there is a purpose because now we're kool according to his purpose now he's like an entire Kol according to a purpose then I have to go and help him to fulfill that purpose amen isn't this exciting or what the lore has for us is like in one scripture he says one thing but in the other he goes and doing himself amen the next will be other purpose a jihadi was to have the preeminence in his body of believers Roberto God says his bride that he might live in people he wants to live in people how many can say this morning Lord I'm one of them I want you to come and live in my heart and the accusers are going to come and they're gonna say you and I say yeah he said so and that settles it I believe it amen the enemy is going to come to point your passenger say devil do you know your future prefer Oh God says he called oh that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again that's why he gave his Bligh his life he gave his blood the blood of God for who for me because if he wouldn't go he's like it is it is needed that I will go so that that this peer the comfort that will come entering you didn't we say didn't we sing if the spirit or the scripture says if they say if the spirit was raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he will quicken your mortal bodies but even even though my body is getting old I'm getting tired I get tired now that I Drive a lot but it doesn't matter because if he's rolling in here he's going to quicken that see that is in me amen he's a savior prophet of God says and he had to express that and how could how could he do it only through Christ how could he be a son only through Christ how could he be a healer only through Christ see all things are in that person of Jesus Christ that's why our airing we invited always to come and meet the person of Jesus Christ are invited always to receive the Holy Spirit which is not just the Spirit of God not just an emotion I mean not just a sensation but the Spirit of God in our lives and an even greater to meet him face to face that is what he wants this morning so the first purpose was to reveal himself to the people the second purpose was to have the preeminence in the indiv REO believers but that is not enough but is it third purpose what was in the Garden of Eden it was Adam and Eve a husband in a wife relationship there is where he wants us to restore us there is where he wants us to restore us back to to our relationship as a father as a husband with his wife that's why the prophet of God says now you're a longer a church I'm gonna call you a bride I'm gonna call you more than a bride I'm gonna call you a wife and then where is a husband now notice again that's a three-fold purpose manifests himself in Jesus Christ and then to come and have the preeminence in the body of believers by Jesus Christ and then what was the next purpose to restore back Eden bring back that which was lost Lord I was lost but now I am found therefore I'm on my way to my promised land did you say amen to that that was the only thing out of order amen I was out of order Lord all the rest of his things was they were in order but he had to put let men the men have to be a free for moral agency to fall so that he may be a savior to displayed what is in him that he can be a savior for me this morning amen he's attributed as a savior something had to be lost and everything that men fell and became lost he become the savior of that oh praise the Lord don't just lift up her hands and say lord thank you so much for these great purpose that you got for my life this morning Lord it is that no you you you don't you just want to have preeminence in my life Lord but now you want to send me back where I come from you want to send me back to the real it with the real Adam and the real if this morning blessed be the name of the Lord what can we say this morning if God is for us who can be against us blessed be the name of the Lord how can we just give him thanks [Applause] can just close her eyes and say Lord in all these things thank you Lord and we know that in all these things that all these things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and then for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many among many brethren moreover whom did he predestinated then he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things it God be for us who can be against us he that is spared not his own son but delivered him out for his all for us all how shall he not with him all also freely give us all these things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified who is he that condemneth ascribe Christ that died yea rather that it is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord that is our purpose that is the purpose of the Bible believers this morning to go back where that relationship as a husband and a wife was there in Adam and Eve he wants us to go back but in the meantime he wants to have the preeminence in her lives how many this morning can say Lord if I have not given you the preeminence this morning when I raise my hand and I want to bring it before anymore I want you to forgive me Lord because many times I have cat I have taken for granted Lord their preaching of the word I have means the services Lord where you were speaking and I have not come to church just because and I have bring so many excuses before you Lord but I know that every single
