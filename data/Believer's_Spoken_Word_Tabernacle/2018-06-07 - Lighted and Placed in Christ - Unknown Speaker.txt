========================================

blessed are they that know thy voice the joyful sound thereof they shall walk in the light of thy countenance Oh Lord they could walk to the upper room what was it light showed them light light showed them light aren't you glad godless and Friends God is responsible to his word he's responsible to his word his word listen his word is what binds in his boundless and his word is his Oh are you with me his word is his oath he is bound to his word and as he's bound to his word all it takes his faith in his word to release him who had made the oath and what he said that he is and what he will do he will do for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people Wow think of a time that we're living in here people don't even know what they are now think about this I can make that statement brother branham made that statement clear back in 1964 he wasn't saying that to put people down but he's letting us know of darkness do you recognize where darkness darkness knows no ends it keeps going it keeps working to where things that would you you look we've seen this we've seen the movements that are even going on even right now more movements continue to come more movements continue to come everybody is so moved by their feelings well I feel this is right I feel they ought not do this I feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel feel and you're not careful you'll get remor you'll get caught up in that social mumbo jumbo to come on somebody because you know what they want to play on who you are you've got to remember you're not called here to be a part of their movement there is one movement and it's not the movement of man it's the move holy ghost it's the move of the pride of the Lord Jesus Christ glory be to God hallelujah gross darkness I'll cover the people but the Lord shall arise upon him and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy rising wear the brim says when man has sent a message so long when man see you living like him when he sees your character and your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifest then man will see Jesus Christ they won't have to look around anywhere else and say what does this Creed teach what does that Cree teach they'll know what God is when they see you Shalom God's peace be upon you and when God's Word is vindicated in this age completely you'll see it and believe it Shalom to you let me close look at this responsibility that were called to hell more close show forth the praises of him you're a chosen generation Joseph a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people for what purpose that you should show forth the praises of him that called you out of darkness into this marvelous light which in times past were not a people once you think of how this is worded there was no order about our lives we were in chaos we could say all we were Gentiles but we were not a people God looks at a people is one who is assembled to him by his namesake we were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy can I read one more - you may read this quote here I know it's small had to try to dig that up brother Richard can't you see that okay back there okay and I know the rest you can see it and the only way that God can preach the gospel today is through that lump of clay God's God doesn't need machinery he just needed lumps of clay lumps of surrendered claim and that's why he is keeping you here you want to know why you're here oh but a sent me here to understand I run every day and you know I eat organic organic organic organic and I do all of this and I do that's wonderful that's that's tremendous if it's good enough having me over for dinner now I'll join with you long as it's not grass I don't want to eat grass I just want the things that I eat to eat good grass but that's why you're here I believe in taking care of ourselves but that's why we're here we're not here for any other purpose what I'm here so that I can be the best in this company that's not why you're there when you get that kind of a focus that I am here I'm to make this company stand out on the map you got the wrong focus the devil has pulled one right over your eyes and I'm telling you what's the truth you'll be left right here at the day of the rapture the purpose and focus is not about your abilities or my abilities that's not the gospel the gospel is not something that we sat down on a lunch break and talk about the gospel is his life walking in shoe leather and where it's not just something you tell somebody you're a Christian but they know who's first in your life they know about the way you talk they know by the way yeah they know it by the loyalty that is portray through your life so when you look at it and say ah it's just Thursday night Church it'll be okay without me you're showing what you think of him oh it's just Sunday now this is so much more important you know I didn't even get the ketchup on my yard work this week and I didn't get to do this you're showing what's more important good holy be to God hope you'll send me you don't know what I've been through believe me you're looking at the wrong way remember remember when the purpose that we are coming here is that he might speak to our lives the first thing that goes from you assembling yourself together with the Saints is your heart and when your heart goes outside your body will follow that's a truth it's your heart Omaha hey commonality is a big thing in it it's easy to become common with one another that's where we need the help of the Lord lord help me to be able to look beyond vessels help me be to be able to when I come here I come here how many days a week or how many a survey how many how many services out of the month i lord help me not to let this become common you realize friends it's not just something that just oh it just becomes common it will become a part of your life and who you are that's up to you you can either be known you can be a full-time work on your job and yet people call you a part-time worker hello somebody you know I'm saying but it's up to you do you want to be a full-time worker and be known to be a full-time worker it's up to you you're the only one that makes it you're the only one that can make that choice and that's why you sit people have a right to come to Christ and say Lord Jesus if you only heal me now I'll go I may not be a preacher but I'll talk about it I'll do everything that I can you are the vine I'm one of the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit the branches bears fruit not the vine the branch the vine only puts the energy into it the gospel can be creep pre preached by Christ if you'll open yourself and be a branch that old bear forth fruit did you catch what he said the gospel can be preached by Christ he's just told us you don't have to be a preacher for the gospel to be preached Paul said the Word of God has sounded out from you the gospel can be creature be preached by Christ if you open up yourself and be a branch that will bear fruit others can see Christ in you by your testimony by your life and the way you live he is the energy but you're the show picture you're the walking Bible no man light of a candle and hide of it under a bushel but he that lighteth it he sets it on a candlestick positioned in him the body for what purpose to show light you see in all the places where you live where you go think of this friends God did not want I look at it if if brother Branham had still been here I don't think any of us would have to think where we would be planning on going this weekend nobody had to think about it is that right we'd probably be going right down we'd be traveling to wherever brother branham's at withers in Jeffersonville and Matt be down in Jonesboro or you might be it don't matter we'd we'd probably be trying to but you see God the message itself has already been spoken what God wanted to say has already been said but now that same God who spoke it is the same God making it real in our lives and in our hearts and God did not want just one little place and everybody gather to that one little physical location but remember that one place that is so important that we be and that's in the Lord Jesus Christ it's in that one body and God would have so much about diversity that is set up God would have one little outpost here God would have one little outpost there don't why would God have that think of this what if there had not been light come by your way oh brother say me I was hungry but who put that hunger in you who put it in you to where you could not be satisfied where you were who did that that was already within you but how God shined that light right across there and that light when they begin to minister to you it began to warm up and here you begin to walk in it and eventually that light itself it lights you up and then as it lights you up then Christ Himself he sets you on the candlestick all these places even where we live where we work where you go to school sometimes being a light it's not necessarily all that we say it's the life that we live and remember the life that we live it speaks volumes it ministers it preaches that's last scripture that we let's stand that we mentioned let your light let your light I think that's such a big word let your light so shine that they may see your good works how many know he's not talking about delivering fruit baskets how many know that he's not talking about opening the doors for the elderly those are all wonderful things he's not talking about that but remember your good works is him working through you because there's nothing good in you and me if there's any work that is good it's him doing the work remember they asked the Lord Jesus what must we do that we might work the works of God believe on Him whom he had sent and that you might work the works of God that would they may glorify your father which is in heaven I said Lord I want my vessel to shine wherever I'm at wherever God's placed you at whatever the job is wherever it's at let it shine you realize sometimes remember it's the light shining through you that makes a way for even the light to be spoken through you said Lord just shine through me let it give light Lord let it be there I've seen pictures here I was looking at just some wonderful pictures that showed some little children kneeling beside the bed praying and then it showed a little pictures of you know them sliding glass doors that you have it showed some children as they're praying there and when you look that they took the picture and looking at it's a drawing they took a picture and looking at those glass sliding doors and you see the Lord Jesus standing right there in that room that's our desire we may not always we may not see it all the time may not feel it it's not about that it's let your light shine let your life be so placed by God God where you have for me your position your placement Lord
