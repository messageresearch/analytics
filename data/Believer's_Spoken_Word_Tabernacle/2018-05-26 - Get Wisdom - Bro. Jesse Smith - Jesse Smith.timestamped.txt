[42:22] your blessing this morning amen
[42:24] we stand redeemed when I think of all my
[42:30] faults and my failures I consider all
[42:38] the times I've let God down
[42:42] I am humbled by the grace he has
[42:49] extended I'm amazed at the mercy I could
[43:03] never
[43:05] is the of on my own somehow every time I
[43:12] come before his throne
[43:17] I stand petite thank you Jesus

[43:31] see now when he looks at me he sees
[43:36] those nail-scarred hands that bought my
[43:41] Liberty I stand
[43:45] every team
[43:49] and even at my best I am worried
[43:56] I have nothing precious I can get a
[44:05] broken life is all I have to offer
[44:12] and yet it is a priceless TIFF two years
[44:18] a bit of mark of sin will never fade
[44:27] away oh but I can come before him on the
[44:34] shade

[45:09] had my best I am unworthy I have nothing
[45:18] precious I can
[45:22] a broken life is all I have to offer and
[45:32] yet it is a priceless gift to hear the
[45:40] bitter mark of sin will never fade away

[46:27] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah isn't
[46:33] that a wonderful privilege I said didn't
[46:36] had a wonderful privilege to stand
[46:39] before him unashamed and he made it all
[46:43] possible he made it all possible without
[46:47] him there's there's nothing else there's
[46:49] no way that we can have the life that we
[46:52] have but he came to give us back the
[46:55] life that we had with him before aren't
[47:00] you grateful for that that's that's
[47:02] that's the heart of the gospel isn't it
[47:04] the heart of the gospel is not about
[47:06] doctrines but the heart of the gospel is
[47:08] about God himself coming down becoming
[47:11] one of us and redeeming his children
[47:14] back to himself
[47:16] amen what love and you look at that you
[47:19] know here in the service this morning we
[47:21] direct that right towards the young
[47:23] people but we're all young you know I
[47:26] used to hear different ones tell me you
[47:29] know that I still my body might be a
[47:32] certain age but I still feel 18 in my
[47:35] spirit now I just had to take that by
[47:38] theory I have heard but now I see
[47:47] younger women y'all know what I'm
[47:49] talking about
[47:50] there's things where you know you used
[47:51] to be able to just to walk outside and
[47:53] you could just start shooting baskets
[47:54] and the boys say dad let's go outside
[47:57] and I said let me think about it let me
[47:59] get my thoughts in order and once I get
[48:02] out there let me stretch a little bit
[48:04] and you don't know what you're gonna
[48:07] pull or but the Lord is so good so good

[48:37] goodness we appreciate the specials this
[48:39] morning don't we I'll tell you y'all
[48:46] sing like that again this morning he
[48:48] might start preaching I'll tell you what
[48:53] the Lord is so good you know it's I'll
[48:56] tell you what if serving the Lord is
[48:58] it's full of joy it's full of joy you
[49:02] know I used to I used to wonder as a
[49:05] young person what in what in the world
[49:07] did did they see sitting around talking
[49:10] what was it they seen in church you know
[49:12] you just you just went to church and and
[49:14] you went and you think man and you know
[49:16] back in those days you'd have the the
[49:20] meetings and you know they preach maybe
[49:22] two hours or something and then my dad
[49:24] would get up and I knew that's gonna be
[49:25] another half hour 45 minutes and I'd sit
[49:28] there and think my goodness man you know
[49:30] but you know what it was when you do
[49:33] when you when you don't see yourself and
[49:35] you don't know your part in it it's kind
[49:37] of hard to to really focus in on it but
[49:41] I'm telling you right now no matter how
[49:43] old you are how young you are you've got
[49:45] a part in this
[49:46] it's no mistake no mistake that you were
[49:50] born in a home in this hour where God
[49:53] had already taken a parent or parents
[49:55] and already birthed them by this word
[49:58] it's no mistake we're living in a time
[50:01] where it's so so close but what a
[50:04] privilege it is to be able to have a
[50:06] parent or parents or grandparents it's a
[50:08] privilege to not only be able to hear
[50:10] this word but in your heart if you can
[50:12] just look while the words coming forth
[50:14] and say Lord just make yourself more
[50:16] real to me and you watch the Bible says
[50:19] very clearly it says if we draw 9 to God
[50:21] he'll draw 9 to us you just start
[50:24] getting in your thoughts this morning
[50:26] and saying Lord just make yourself more
[50:28] real to me Lord and I'll tell you what
[50:31] God will come right on the scene he'll
[50:33] take the gift that he's put in brother
[50:35] Jesse's life and God will take that gift
[50:37] and operate it and and the way he
[50:39] operates it is because of based on our
[50:41] needs our needs really did take the way
[50:44] that this service will go the the man of
[50:46] God can study and he'll prepare by
[50:48] inspiration that's dropping but yet to
[50:50] put it all together it's gonna take God
[50:52] to come on the scene and God to minister
[50:55] to our lives and when you when you hear
[50:57] God minister in that way and you know
[50:59] brother Jesse don't know me
[51:01] he might know you but he don't know you
[51:03] he don't know the thoughts it's been
[51:05] going through your mind he don't know
[51:06] all those things but there's one here
[51:08] among us who knows all about it and that
[51:12] same one that talks to you in that way
[51:13] he's letting you know you've got a part
[51:16] and you know it's like when you look at
[51:18] a drama some of you may be had to do a
[51:20] play sometimes you know in school they
[51:22] have you in reading where you got a you
[51:23] have to read a part and you know how
[51:25] they put me out in italicized part they
[51:27] say read with enthusiasm you come across
[51:30] the kid and they say oh look dad's home
[51:33] no no no stop stop stop
[51:34] it says read with enthusiasm Oh what do
[51:38] you mean look dad's home see those
[51:41] little parts are in there to let you
[51:44] know how to read your part and there's
[51:47] only one that can really help us do our
[51:49] part and that's the one who ordained us
[51:52] in this part and he knows just exactly
[51:55] how to bring that expression out of your
[51:58] life
[51:58] God is so good he's so faithful in this
[52:02] generation in this moment in this time
[52:05] God is faithful and I'll tell you this
[52:07] right now the message that God sent in
[52:10] this hour it came for you it came for
[52:14] you
[52:15] brother brems said when he was caught up
[52:17] there he said in that consolation of
[52:19] angels he said I remember young people
[52:21] what he said concerning you see this
[52:25] message this word that God has given to
[52:27] us it's not a message for older people
[52:30] it's a message for all of his children
[52:32] you don't matter how young you are you
[52:34] might look at your stature and say how
[52:36] can I do anything but you let God take a
[52:38] hold in your life and you say Lord just
[52:40] have your way in me you do what you want
[52:43] to do in my life and you watch how God
[52:45] will move God does things that the mind
[52:49] itself cannot even conceive because it's
[52:52] not a natural way it's a supernatural
[52:54] God you're loving this morning I know
[52:58] I'm not the preacher this morning but
[53:00] the preachers here already but we want
[53:03] to just pool on the gift of God I want
[53:05] to say that I so appreciate brother
[53:08] Jesse as he's making his way on out he
[53:09] and sister Chris and they just have they
[53:11] just are bosom friends and I just really
[53:14] really love him and appreciate him and
[53:15] and I'm just grateful that brother Jesse
[53:19] was able to be here and take this
[53:21] service and brother Jesse's got a
[53:23] wonderful gift that God has placed
[53:25] within his life to be able to to reach
[53:27] and to minister to young as well as to
[53:31] old and we just want to pull on the gift
[53:32] of God I believe God has something for
[53:34] us you know and and I believe that with
[53:37] all my heart we want to just turn our
[53:39] attention fully to the word and and just
[53:41] so grateful for what God is doing in
[53:44] this time it's exactly right brother
[53:45] Nathanael that song that you sung today
[53:47] it's a time of joy it's a time of joy
[53:51] but the brem tells us and you know what
[53:53] this is not something you just have to
[53:54] read and know about it's something you
[53:56] experience but the brem says once a man
[53:58] has been born of the Spirit of God he
[54:00] said you've been tapped into a
[54:02] powerhouse of joy and that's the truth
[54:05] you've got joy even in a time when you
[54:07] should be down
[54:08] and you can't figure out down deep
[54:10] beneath the dark clouds and the despair
[54:13] I've got joy I've got joy because joy is
[54:17] not Joy's not happiness joy is there
[54:19] because a happy you can be in your
[54:21] emotions either way but there's joy down
[54:23] in your soul Oh glory be to God
[54:27] Amen well I'd better get out here we're
[54:29] gonna take the whole service for the
[54:31] Jessie we love you come on brother amen

[54:54] land

[55:57] let's take our Bibles this morning by
[55:59] the grace of Lord it feels like Sunday
[56:01] but it's actually Saturday so we're
[56:04] grateful to be in the house of Lord this
[56:05] morning we just want to greet everyone
[56:06] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see
[56:09] the Saints such familiar faces over the
[56:11] years we're so grateful for all the
[56:12] support from the Sheffield Saints this
[56:15] was the first message church I ever
[56:17] walked into so many years ago now it
[56:20] must been seventeen years ago by the
[56:21] grace of Lord so I'm so thankful to have
[56:23] started here and thankful for the
[56:26] fellowship of brother Samuel and the
[56:28] wisdom and the mentoring he's given me
[56:29] of course you know that's all by the
[56:31] Holy Spirit and but we're so grateful to
[56:34] be with you and we appreciate the
[56:36] assembly here in the Saints let's go to
[56:38] Matthew chapter 25 alright a title this
[56:43] morning I'd like to just speak on get
[56:45] wisdom I'd like to speak on that this
[56:47] morning get wisdom I believe it's
[56:51] supposed to be kinda like a youth
[56:52] service but hopefully we're all feeling
[56:54] young this morning by the grace of the
[56:56] Lord but do we so appreciate the desire
[56:59] to minister to the youth and to the
[57:02] youth out there may God bless you and
[57:04] trust the Holy Spirit will speak to you
[57:06] this morning by the grace of the Lord I
[57:08] know he will if you're hungry and
[57:10] thirsting because God never disappoints
[57:12] anyone who comes to the house of Lord
[57:14] hungered and thirsting for righteousness
[57:16] where the RAM said one time he said I
[57:18] never left Church disappointed and nor
[57:21] have I by the grace of the Lord because
[57:24] God is so real to us
[57:25] he's always revealing more of himself to
[57:27] us Matthew 25 like to start at verse 1
[57:34] and we'll be reading two texts we'll go
[57:36] to proverbs 4 after this but I like to
[57:37] read Matthew 25 just 1 through 4
[57:40] familiar a portion to us then shall the
[57:44] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
[57:45] virgins which took their lamps and went
[57:47] forth to meet the bridegroom and five of
[57:50] them were wise and five were foolish
[57:52] they that were foolish took their lamps
[57:55] and took no oil
[57:57] with them verse four but the wise took
[58:01] oil in their vessels with their lamps
[58:05] let's go to proverbs chapter four like
[58:14] to read verses five six and seven
[58:26] proverbs 4 verses 5 6 & 7 if you're
[58:30] there say Amen verse 5 get wisdom that's

[58:37] understanding forget it not neither
[58:42] decline from the words of my mouth
[58:45] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[58:48] thee love her and she shall keep thee
[58:53] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[58:59] get wisdom he's got to say it twice
[59:01] aren't you glad the Holy Spirit repeats
[59:03] things so we don't miss it get wisdom
[59:06] and with all thy getting get

[1:01:03] the praise the Lord
[1:01:09] well again we're happy to be here by the
[1:01:11] grace of Lord and and you know I don't
[1:01:15] really agree bring greetings from my
[1:01:16] church because they didn't know I was
[1:01:19] coming because I just found out
[1:01:20] yesterday I think it was or was it day
[1:01:22] before and we're grateful to be here and
[1:01:24] brother Samuel said thanks for your
[1:01:25] sacrifice but it is no sacrifice to come
[1:01:27] here it is a blessing to come here I
[1:01:31] don't care if I worked all week or it
[1:01:33] was sick all week it would be a blessing
[1:01:35] to be with all of you so God knows how
[1:01:37] much we love all of you and and you know
[1:01:40] those all the encouragement you've given
[1:01:42] over the years brother ray you know I
[1:01:43] think - brother brother Richard and
[1:01:44] brother bill and brother herb you know I
[1:01:47] just appreciate all the encouragement
[1:01:49] over the years what a tremendous group
[1:01:50] you have here and I was telling brother
[1:01:52] way out of text you know this church is
[1:01:54] like a model Church that I want to model
[1:01:55] our church after because of the maturity
[1:01:58] here the love for the Lord here the
[1:02:01] dedication here it's really quite
[1:02:03] striking to see that and we just I just
[1:02:07] want to see more of that in Akron by the
[1:02:08] grace of the Lord so we're just grateful
[1:02:10] for your testimonies amen and keep up
[1:02:12] the great labor of love that you do
[1:02:14] praise the Lord so I want to look at
[1:02:16] this thought here and maybe I'll take an
[1:02:18] hour or maybe two hours we'll see how
[1:02:20] long you know
[1:02:22] I'll joke there you know I generally set
[1:02:24] a timer now to keep myself under control
[1:02:26] so that's the nice thing about this
[1:02:27] watch I can set timers and time myself
[1:02:30] and by the time I get started I got like
[1:02:32] 15 minutes left you know so but it isn't
[1:02:35] very handy you know even for preaching
[1:02:36] but especially at school you know when
[1:02:38] we have to be a certain time in place
[1:02:39] this thing is worth every cent you know
[1:02:41] to make sure I'm on time for school and
[1:02:43] I don't forget music and I don't forget
[1:02:44] PE and it's just a real help by the
[1:02:48] grace of the Lord so we're thankful to
[1:02:50] be with you let's look at this thought
[1:02:52] here this morning get wisdom it's kind
[1:02:54] of a combination of numerous messages
[1:02:56] the I felt like the Holy Spirit has
[1:02:58] given me over the past few months and I
[1:03:00] trusted to be a blessing to you I want
[1:03:02] to thank my wife for bringing all the
[1:03:03] six kids with her this we're with us
[1:03:05] this morning where's my wife well she's
[1:03:07] already out with the kids no no doubt
[1:03:08] about that
[1:03:09] but let's give her a round of applause
[1:03:10] appreciate my wife Amy she brought six
[1:03:17] kids but she's back in the seventh by
[1:03:18] God's grace so we're grateful the baby
[1:03:21] should be here any week now by God's
[1:03:23] grace but we're so thankful another
[1:03:26] arrow God has given to us and so we just
[1:03:29] want to sharpen that arrow and the Bible
[1:03:31] said it will be shot out at the gates of
[1:03:32] the enemy and helped tear down the
[1:03:35] kingdom of Satan somewhere amen
[1:03:37] so thank God for that so I like to look
[1:03:41] at this thought and I want to look at
[1:03:42] getting wisdom how many of the book of
[1:03:45] Proverbs you know I just started
[1:03:48] preaching on it I haven't ever preached
[1:03:50] on it really thoroughly until recently I
[1:03:52] think I've got 11 sermons on it so far
[1:03:54] but it's just been a tremendous book and
[1:03:58] you know the word wisdom has a few
[1:04:01] different thoughts about it but I just
[1:04:04] to define it in a few ways you might
[1:04:06] understand is his skillful living it's
[1:04:09] applying the word you know at the
[1:04:13] correct time because knowledge is just
[1:04:16] knowing the word knowing Hebrews 13:8 or
[1:04:20] you know Isaiah 53 verse 5 you know acts
[1:04:24] 2:38 wisdom in our knowledge is just
[1:04:27] knowing the Word of God but wisdom is
[1:04:30] actually taking that word and applying
[1:04:33] it at the right time of your life
[1:04:36] and it's in other words it's following
[1:04:38] the leadership of the Holy Spirit and so
[1:04:42] when you do this when you live with
[1:04:45] wisdom these are decisions you make like
[1:04:48] we'd say you'd make a wise decision and
[1:04:51] that's what wisdom is when you choose
[1:04:53] the right choice at the right time and
[1:04:57] so these decisions that you choose
[1:05:00] ultimately build your testimony or build
[1:05:03] your character because your character is
[1:05:07] the only thing you're taking with you is
[1:05:10] that right it's the only thing that
[1:05:12] we're taking with us is the care and the
[1:05:14] character is just the collection of wise
[1:05:16] decisions
[1:05:17] I remember when brother Richard taught
[1:05:19] that in Sunday school you remember that
[1:05:20] about 17 years ago I remember that he
[1:05:25] said it's your moral make up is what you
[1:05:27] said the character is you're more moral
[1:05:30] make up and you you know right and wrong
[1:05:32] you're choosing right over the wrong and
[1:05:34] so these decisions build your character
[1:05:37] and the Bible said wisdom builds her
[1:05:41] house so knowledge is like the materials
[1:05:45] you use to build a church here or
[1:05:47] reconstruct the church but wisdom is
[1:05:49] taking that those materials and
[1:05:51] constructing something beautiful and so
[1:05:55] if you search the scripture wisdom and
[1:05:57] knowledge go together throughout the
[1:05:59] entire Bible just like oil and wine you
[1:06:02] remember the the third seal brother ram
[1:06:04] labored on that he says he said you can
[1:06:06] run the concordance and oil and wine are
[1:06:08] always together in worship because they
[1:06:11] go together you can't have one without
[1:06:12] the other well that's how it is with
[1:06:14] wisdom and knowledge knowledge is just
[1:06:17] knowing the word why no the Bible says
[1:06:18] this I know the Bible commands that I
[1:06:21] know the Bible points us to this but
[1:06:24] wisdom is actually applying that to your
[1:06:26] life and then seeing the results of it
[1:06:28] because jesus said wisdom is justified
[1:06:31] of her children
[1:06:33] in other words wisdom is manifested by
[1:06:37] the results that it bears amen so in
[1:06:41] other words you know someone walked in
[1:06:43] wisdom when you see the fruits of their
[1:06:46] acts
[1:06:47] so many times wisdom doesn't have an
[1:06:50] immediate blessing upon it but give it a
[1:06:53] little while you've got give that seed
[1:06:55] of God a little time amen
[1:06:57] plant that seed leave it in the ground
[1:07:00] water that seed for a little while and
[1:07:02] watch the Sun go to take effect on that
[1:07:05] seed and pretty soon you're gonna find
[1:07:07] some wonderful godly fruit amen and then
[1:07:11] that fruit is then that's the effect so
[1:07:13] that's the results that's the evidence
[1:07:16] of the wise decision that God led you to
[1:07:18] make amen it's exactly right
[1:07:23] now another way you and I might
[1:07:25] understand the word wisdom is just the
[1:07:28] just saying this the perfect will of God
[1:07:31] that's the way I've just explained it at
[1:07:33] preaching our church wisdom is the
[1:07:35] perfect will of God the perfect decision
[1:07:38] the best decision God would have us make
[1:07:41] is the perfect will of God
[1:07:42] in other words walking in obedience to
[1:07:45] the Holy Ghost and now bringing it down
[1:07:48] to our text is the lifestyle of the wise
[1:07:53] virgin that's wisdom because she's
[1:07:57] called the wise virgin
[1:08:00] now virgin means she had no interactions
[1:08:03] with the world right no no flirting
[1:08:07] around and no interactions with the
[1:08:10] world she was completely she was free
[1:08:12] from that and member both were free from
[1:08:15] that the wise and the foolish were both
[1:08:18] free from those interactions with the
[1:08:20] world
[1:08:20] they weren't flirting with the world
[1:08:22] though the foolish were not neither were
[1:08:26] the wise but the wise had something that
[1:08:30] the foolish did it and that was the oil
[1:08:33] they knew they needed more oil they knew
[1:08:38] how much oil they needed amen
[1:08:41] the foolish were foolish about it they
[1:08:44] were not wise about it they thought well
[1:08:47] I only need a certain amount or I don't
[1:08:48] need you to take my lamp or uh-uh they
[1:08:51] they just didn't have the understanding
[1:08:53] that they might need more oil so they
[1:08:57] made no preparations to
[1:09:00] bringing enough oil and I don't know
[1:09:02] about you Church but I don't want it I
[1:09:04] just don't want a little bit of a ninety
[1:09:05] to last me five more years in the
[1:09:08] message like some people that fall away
[1:09:10] I don't want to fall away ten years down
[1:09:12] the road I want enough oil so that no
[1:09:16] matter when Jesus Christ comes I can
[1:09:19] shrimp my lamp
[1:09:20] make sure the fires burning and go out
[1:09:22] to meet him amen I'm not looking for a
[1:09:27] way out of the message because the
[1:09:29] message isn't me praise God I'm not
[1:09:34] looking for loopholes in the Bible where
[1:09:36] I don't have to do this I want to do
[1:09:38] God's will more than anything else I
[1:09:42] want to please God amen
[1:09:44] that's how we should all feel that's how
[1:09:47] any real Christian feels you know when
[1:09:50] the seals brother Branham was preaching
[1:09:52] and he was talking about how he couldn't
[1:09:53] prove brother brand was saying I can't
[1:09:55] prove my name is on the Lamb's Book of
[1:09:57] Life
[1:09:58] he said there's that you can't prove it
[1:10:00] and he says you know he said but one way
[1:10:03] you'll know for sure he says as soon as
[1:10:05] you see that word the person whose name
[1:10:07] is on the book of life can't wait for
[1:10:10] the moment to go do the will of God so
[1:10:14] that's one way that proves that your
[1:10:16] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life when
[1:10:18] the word of God the book of life that
[1:10:20] we've been given when it flashes before
[1:10:23] you when the commandment is preached to
[1:10:25] you you receive it and you can't wait to
[1:10:28] fulfill it glory it's the wisdom of God
[1:10:34] and Jesus Christ Himself said I like in
[1:10:38] a wise man in Matthew 7:24 unto a man
[1:10:42] who builds his house upon a rock
[1:10:44] a man who hears the word and then go
[1:10:48] does the word a lot of people come to
[1:10:51] church and hear the word but how many do
[1:10:55] the word that's a different story right
[1:11:00] we've got to hear the word we've got to
[1:11:04] have circumcised ears but then we've got
[1:11:06] to remember that word as soon as we
[1:11:08] leave the parking lot as soon as we get
[1:11:12] home that
[1:11:12] eight this afternoon as we're
[1:11:15] fellowshipping or whoever you go you've
[1:11:17] got to remember that word you've got to
[1:11:20] let the Holy Spirit write that word upon
[1:11:23] the fleshly tables of your heart
[1:11:28] praise the Lord now let's look at the
[1:11:32] scripture here just a moment here let's
[1:11:33] go to proverbs chapter 1 since we're
[1:11:35] there in proverbs 4 I felt the Holy
[1:11:38] Spirit you know as I was preaching on
[1:11:40] the wisdom series just bring out some
[1:11:42] nice types here now if you know proverbs
[1:11:45] you know Solomon wrote this book and
[1:11:47] then there was at the end there some
[1:11:48] letters or chapters that were Hezekiah
[1:11:52] found and he placed in this book and
[1:11:54] then there's you know two kings at the
[1:11:55] end that agar and and and Lemuel that
[1:11:58] kind of placed this book and they
[1:12:00] complete this book and but it begins as
[1:12:04] a personal letter from solomon to his
[1:12:07] son and i thought this would be good for
[1:12:10] the young children for the young people
[1:12:12] because this is a let this starts out as
[1:12:15] a letter from a father to his son and 23
[1:12:22] times in this book solomon says these
[1:12:25] words my son this is a this is a a
[1:12:30] desire from a father's heart for his
[1:12:33] children to listen to him
[1:12:37] he wants his children to hear what he's
[1:12:40] saying and he wants him to take not take
[1:12:43] it for granted but he wouldn't see he
[1:12:45] wants them to lay these words and and
[1:12:48] but the bible said even wrap them around
[1:12:49] your neck like a necklace let these
[1:12:54] words be always before your eyes don't
[1:12:57] look to other things but but just let my
[1:13:00] words of wisdom be placed before your
[1:13:04] eyes so this is the father's heartbeat
[1:13:06] to his son in chapter 1 verse 1 the
[1:13:12] Proverbs of Solomon the son of David
[1:13:13] king of Israel to know wisdom and
[1:13:15] instruction to perceive the words of
[1:13:17] knowledge
[1:13:17] I'm sorry understanding to receive the
[1:13:19] instruction of wisdom justice and
[1:13:22] judgment and equity now the first time
[1:13:28] he says my son is in verse 8 remember
[1:13:29] there's 23 times in Heart Church I
[1:13:31] preach every time he said it and I
[1:13:33] enjoyed it a lot of times I was talking
[1:13:35] right to Malachi Somyot you get it a
[1:13:37] second time here tonight or maybe third
[1:13:39] or fourth or fifth time but
[1:13:41] we understand these things are true for
[1:13:43] daughters or sons but in verse eight my
[1:13:47] son here the instruction of thy father
[1:13:49] forsake not the law of thy mother now if
[1:13:53] you would and go to verse 20 and now
[1:13:57] Sullivan he gets allegorical or like a
[1:14:01] metaphor or he starts painting like a
[1:14:03] picture of what wisdom is like in verse
[1:14:07] 20 wisdom crying without so wisdom just
[1:14:13] doesn't stay all hidden you know and
[1:14:16] this perfect win of God is just not
[1:14:18] hidden away somewhere
[1:14:19] wisdom is trying to get its voice out
[1:14:24] she utters her voice in the streets she
[1:14:31] cry it in the cheap place of concourse
[1:14:33] in the opening of the gates in the city
[1:14:35] she utters her words saying how long you
[1:14:37] simple ones will you love simplicity and
[1:14:39] thus corners the light there scorning
[1:14:41] and fools hate knowledge turn at you
[1:14:43] I'm sorry turn you at my reproof so look
[1:14:47] at this wisdom is like a woman who goes
[1:14:49] out in the streets and she's crying who
[1:14:51] will listen to me is there anybody out
[1:14:54] there who wants to listen to me and so
[1:14:58] we see this wisdom here is symbolic of a
[1:15:01] woman heading out in the streets which
[1:15:03] is also a type of Acts chapter 2 praise
[1:15:06] God because look at the next verse at
[1:15:09] verse 23 turn you at my reproof behold I
[1:15:11] will pour out my spirit unto you does
[1:15:16] that sounded familiar to anybody it
[1:15:18] ought to be in Acts chapter 2 wisdom
[1:15:22] went out into the streets brother
[1:15:23] Branham so they jumped jumped out of
[1:15:25] windows and they went out to the streets
[1:15:28] the Bible said declaring the wonderful
[1:15:31] works of the Lord and three thousand
[1:15:34] people came to Lady wisdom and said we
[1:15:36] want wisdom and they buried him in the
[1:15:38] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] wisdom couldn't stay in the upper room
[1:15:44] thank God they were in the upper room
[1:15:46] but wisdom will send you out to declare
[1:15:49] the wonderful works of God in your home
[1:15:52] right on the job in your school wisdom
[1:15:56] we'll take you out it'll make you cry
[1:15:58] out do you want to come to church do you
[1:16:00] want to hear the word of God is there
[1:16:02] anybody that wants to hear God's Word
[1:16:04] Amen that's what wisdom does the church
[1:16:08] now this the wisdom would be like the
[1:16:10] church here the church has led the woman
[1:16:12] right the church she goes out and cries
[1:16:15] out I will pour out my spirit upon all
[1:16:17] flesh amen your sons and your daughters
[1:16:20] our prophesy your old men will dream
[1:16:22] dreams your young men will see missions
[1:16:24] amen hallelujah and it was tight
[1:16:27] beautifully here in proverbs chapter one
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:32] look at verse 25 but ye have said it not
[1:16:35] all my council and would none of my
[1:16:38] reproof doesn't that remind you of the
[1:16:39] latency in church age in revelation 3:18
[1:16:42] jesus said take counsel from me to buy
[1:16:47] gold tried in the fire
[1:16:49] Amen Jesus wants to have a counsel Jesus
[1:16:54] wants to have a meeting Jesus wants to
[1:16:56] talk it over with all of us amen and we
[1:17:00] know that we know the story in Chapter
[1:17:02] one we know what happens we know they
[1:17:05] rejected what the majority people reject
[1:17:07] it and then the last part of the chapter
[1:17:09] there you know wisdom is is is mocking
[1:17:13] the sinners who rejected it oh god help
[1:17:16] us not to spurn mercy in this hour help
[1:17:20] us to really examine our lives are we
[1:17:21] really living wise lives well the man
[1:17:26] said checkup every hour
[1:17:27] are we doing that that's what we must do
[1:17:31] hallelujah now in in chapter 1 we see
[1:17:35] the invitation the invitation goes out
[1:17:38] now how many have received the
[1:17:39] invitation I have now proverbs 2 tells
[1:17:43] us how to get even more wisdom how many
[1:17:47] would be interested in that because
[1:17:49] remember no man can come to God except
[1:17:51] God draw him first they men
[1:17:54] it wasn't you seeking God it wasn't me
[1:17:58] seeking the message that was seeking me
[1:18:00] praise God I never would have found them
[1:18:04] on my own I didn't find God I wasn't the
[1:18:07] one searching God God was seeking my
[1:18:09] lost soul amen
[1:18:11] but he purchased my soul he sanctified
[1:18:14] my soul
[1:18:14] he saved my soul he filled my soul at
[1:18:17] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:19] he did it it's exactly right but chapter
[1:18:25] 2 tells us if we like more wisdom and
[1:18:27] this is what our young people and I
[1:18:29] think our older people can do to my son
[1:18:33] if thou wilt receive my words verse one
[1:18:35] and hide my Commandments with thee so
[1:18:37] that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom
[1:18:40] and apply thy heart to understanding
[1:18:43] here it is right here this is if you how
[1:18:45] many Mountain want more wisdom
[1:18:46] look at verse three yay if thou Christ
[1:18:50] after knowledge and lift this up thy
[1:18:54] voice for understanding you know how
[1:18:58] many times have we seen you know in our
[1:19:00] own lives we go to pray we're like lord
[1:19:02] I want more of you we're just so tired
[1:19:05] and we all go through it right I go
[1:19:07] through it we all go we all get burdened
[1:19:09] down by the cares of the world but here
[1:19:12] the wiz the book of wisdom is telling us
[1:19:14] we've really got to be convinced and
[1:19:17] concerned it's got to be more than just
[1:19:21] a casual asking of God we've got to mean
[1:19:25] business young people if you want to
[1:19:28] know God you've got to get down to
[1:19:30] business
[1:19:33] it's got it just can't be a casual
[1:19:36] asking and this was under the blood of
[1:19:37] bulls and goats cry after knowledge lift
[1:19:42] up your voice for understanding God I
[1:19:45] want to know your will for my life god I
[1:19:49] want to know I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:54] that's the kind of people we want to
[1:19:56] have in our church that's the kind of
[1:19:59] people us the kind of families we want
[1:20:01] to raise we're we're more concerned
[1:20:04] about the things of God than the things
[1:20:06] of the way
[1:20:09] because I can show you 10 million people
[1:20:11] that lifted up their voice for the Cavs
[1:20:13] last night but how many were lifting up
[1:20:15] their voice in God speak to my life
[1:20:18] speak to my family move upon our church
[1:20:22] in Sheffield at these special meetings
[1:20:24] we need the wisdom of God we need the
[1:20:27] understanding of the Holy Spirit this is
[1:20:29] what we should lift our voice for verse
[1:20:36] 4 if thou seekest her as silver and
[1:20:41] searches for her as for hid treasures
[1:20:44] I've never went gold diggin I've never
[1:20:48] went silver diggin but I've seen videos
[1:20:49] on at school you need huge machinery you
[1:20:53] need explosives you need bombs the
[1:20:56] treasures are deep down in the earth
[1:20:59] amen in church if you want the treasures
[1:21:03] of God you got to go deep on your knees
[1:21:05] you've got to go deep down in prayer
[1:21:07] you've got to be more sincere it's going
[1:21:12] to take more than a casual 5-minute
[1:21:14] prayer it's going to take a little more
[1:21:19] than just you know reading one chapter a
[1:21:21] day now which that's good that's a good
[1:21:23] way to start
[1:21:24] but brother Ramson don't forget he said
[1:21:26] but after that you'll start reading more
[1:21:28] and more and your hunger more and more
[1:21:29] for God it can't be just a casual thing
[1:21:36] well I check this off I love to do this
[1:21:39] but this is not something just want to
[1:21:41] check off while I'm done for the day
[1:21:42] seeking the Lord
[1:21:48] then thou shalt understand now looking
[1:21:50] for spot then so what happened then
[1:21:52] after what after first you cry lift up
[1:21:54] your voice seek and search then thou
[1:21:59] shalt find answer then thou shalt
[1:22:01] understand the fear of the Lord and find
[1:22:04] the knowledge of God so the Bible is for
[1:22:08] things and then it says then you find
[1:22:11] the fear of the Lord and the knowledge
[1:22:14] of God now how many are willing to go to
[1:22:16] that extreme praise the Lord when
[1:22:21] there's so many different apps and so
[1:22:23] many different things and different
[1:22:25] attractions and different voices out
[1:22:27] there and but the voice of lady wisdom
[1:22:29] is cry she's crying out in the streets
[1:22:32] saying I will pour out my spirit but
[1:22:35] you've got to come and you've got to
[1:22:37] come God's provided way it's got to be
[1:22:42] more than life
[1:22:44] glory verse 6 for the Lord giveth wisdom
[1:22:48] out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
[1:22:49] understanding he layeth up sound wisdom
[1:22:51] for the righteous he's a buckler to them
[1:22:53] that walk uprightly that reminds me when
[1:22:55] brother Brian talked about how every
[1:22:57] promise of God is like in a variety
[1:22:58] store the Bible said God lays up wisdom
[1:23:02] for the righteous and brother and said
[1:23:04] if your healing looks really high up
[1:23:06] there he said don't get discouraged he
[1:23:08] said just go get a ladder climb up that
[1:23:11] ladder of faith grab ahold of that
[1:23:13] because this is God's variety store he
[1:23:16] lets you in you've got access to that
[1:23:19] ladder you've got access through prayer
[1:23:21] if a promise looks too high say God give
[1:23:24] me a ladder let me climb Jacob's Ladder
[1:23:26] let me grab a hold of what belongs to me
[1:23:29] that you gave me hey man
[1:23:35] hallelujah he's striking
[1:23:40] Chapter three to certain detective
[1:23:42] chapter three here so chapter one she
[1:23:45] invites the Holy Ghost Church invites
[1:23:47] them to come out and be born again by
[1:23:49] the Holy Ghost then chapter two if you
[1:23:51] receive that invitation says this is how
[1:23:53] you get the fear of God this is how you
[1:23:55] get the understanding of God you've now
[1:23:57] got to do something into it right the
[1:24:00] Bible says that you if we want more of
[1:24:03] God we must draw nigh into God and then
[1:24:05] God will draw nigh unto you now chapter
[1:24:14] three looking at verse 13 happy is the
[1:24:19] man that findeth wisdom and the man that
[1:24:21] getteth understanding for the
[1:24:22] merchandise that is better than the
[1:24:24] merchandise of silver and gain there of
[1:24:26] then fine gold
[1:24:27] I'd have a hard time convincing a lot of
[1:24:29] church members of that today if you get
[1:24:33] wisdom it's better than a hundred
[1:24:35] thousand dollar paycheck or signing a
[1:24:39] contract will now make two hundred
[1:24:40] thousand a year actually wisdom is more
[1:24:43] valuable than that twenty-five I'm sorry
[1:24:46] twenty-five a hundred thousand or
[1:24:48] whatever two hundred fifty thousand
[1:24:50] contract the world would think Oh duh
[1:24:52] this is easy I'll take this twenty-two
[1:24:55] this quarter million I'll take this this
[1:24:57] contract is more valuable but God Word
[1:24:59] says just the wisdom has got of God is
[1:25:02] more valuable than that think about it
[1:25:09] with the wives versions when one's
[1:25:10] knocking trying to get in and Jesus will
[1:25:13] not let them in he said it's too late
[1:25:17] you weren't wise with the oil you
[1:25:21] weren't wise in your preparations what
[1:25:23] oh my could you imagine being on the
[1:25:25] inside and the rejoicing and then
[1:25:28] imagine what the sadness on the outside
[1:25:30] I could have got in that I had tsiyon
[1:25:33] was so close to that I was inches away
[1:25:35] from that the word of God's been
[1:25:38] delivered to us God sent us a prophet
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:42] he gave us thus saith the Lord we should
[1:25:45] make every opportunity to get the wisdom
[1:25:47] of God amen
[1:25:49] and seek for lift up your voice for it
[1:25:53] search that secret search for it
[1:25:56] we should make every effort to gain the
[1:25:59] wisdom of God it's exactly right
[1:26:03] look at verse 15 I love this she's more
[1:26:08] precious than rubies rubies can rubies
[1:26:12] are some of the rarest gems of all I
[1:26:14] preached a little bit on that at the
[1:26:15] home church but you know based upon a
[1:26:17] gymnast or I'm sorry a gemst website or
[1:26:20] something like that I tried to take the
[1:26:21] most reliable website I could but rubies
[1:26:24] are more rare than diamonds and they're
[1:26:27] extremely valuable and the Bible says
[1:26:29] that she's more I'm sorry it's she's
[1:26:32] more precious wisdom is more precious
[1:26:33] than rubies and all things thou canst
[1:26:38] desire are not to be compared unto thee
[1:26:42] that's powerful I wonder how many young
[1:26:45] people here desire maybe a dad that
[1:26:49] loves them more a mother that would love
[1:26:52] them more for our teenagers I wonder how
[1:26:54] many are desired a good husband one day
[1:26:56] a godly wife how many of them boys
[1:27:01] desiring a godly wife someday boys
[1:27:04] desire no I want a good job someday or
[1:27:06] the sisters I want to do this someday we
[1:27:08] have all these desires I'm gonna have
[1:27:10] desires out there there are so many
[1:27:14] desires all we want to see this
[1:27:15] accomplished
[1:27:16] we want to see that accomplished but I
[1:27:18] hope my life you know produces this or
[1:27:20] that but the Bible said that wisdom is
[1:27:23] greater if you get wisdom it's greater
[1:27:26] than all the desires of your heart amen
[1:27:29] that's why wisdom has to be the desire
[1:27:32] of your heart amen knowing the perfect
[1:27:37] will of God
[1:27:40] that's more valuable than anything you
[1:27:42] could desire well I've always wanted a a
[1:27:46] Mustang brother Jes I've always just
[1:27:48] wanted a Mustang I've always just wanted
[1:27:50] that Corvallis always had that desire
[1:27:54] what's the Bible say all things you
[1:27:58] desire cannot be compared to wisdom
[1:28:04] the Bible later says in verse 18 she's a
[1:28:08] tree of life that's why it's more
[1:28:11] valuable because wisdom is life-giving I
[1:28:15] know I'm walking in the perfect will of
[1:28:17] God there can be nothing more valuable
[1:28:21] than that - no I have not transgressed
[1:28:24] God's command for my life amen
[1:28:28] I have done all that the Lord has asked
[1:28:32] me to do you know the Bible said that
[1:28:34] about David the Bible said David did
[1:28:36] everything the LORD commanded except for
[1:28:38] in the area of Uriah and Bathsheba other
[1:28:42] than that man what was he church he was
[1:28:43] a man after the heart of God and we
[1:28:47] should be a church after the heart of
[1:28:49] Christ amen
[1:28:51] is that right oh this is beautiful
[1:28:56] my the the scripture speaking to us
[1:28:59] today oh it's glorious
[1:29:02] now look here in chapter 4 why was our
[1:29:07] our text get wisdom get understanding
[1:29:10] forget it not neither inclined from the
[1:29:12] words of my mouth forsake or not and she
[1:29:14] shall preserve the loved her and she
[1:29:16] shall keep thee wisdom is the principal
[1:29:19] thing therefore get wisdom with all that
[1:29:21] getting get understanding there's a lot
[1:29:26] of getting I want to get this job I want
[1:29:28] to get this app I want to get this
[1:29:31] spouse I want to get this close I want
[1:29:35] to get you name it I want to get this I
[1:29:37] want to get that I want to get that but
[1:29:39] the Bible said with all you're getting
[1:29:40] but one thing we must get is wisdom
[1:29:44] Peter said over and over give all
[1:29:46] diligence he said it twice in 2nd Peter
[1:29:48] chapter 1 he of all diligence give all
[1:29:51] your effort to make your calling and
[1:29:54] election sure make sure everybody knows
[1:29:58] that you are elected amen you are chosen
[1:30:02] you're one of the chosen few you are a
[1:30:04] child of God lay everything else aside
[1:30:07] but give effort to make sure they know
[1:30:10] you're one of the
[1:30:11] you glory st. Paul was so humble and I
[1:30:18] find brother Brown the same way st. Paul
[1:30:20] was so humble he said in first
[1:30:21] Corinthians chapter 9 he said I've got
[1:30:23] to beat my body down and I've got to
[1:30:26] bring it under subjection that I'm not a
[1:30:29] castaway and if you look at anybody who
[1:30:34] would be saved in Paul's day well
[1:30:36] definitely Paul he was a missionary
[1:30:38] three great missionary trips miraculous
[1:30:41] miracle after miracle miracle after
[1:30:44] miracle church started after church
[1:30:46] sergeant you would think if anybody had
[1:30:47] any security it would be st. Paul but he
[1:30:51] realized that there's something there
[1:30:53] was sin laying in his members and he was
[1:30:55] humble enough to admit there's times and
[1:30:57] when I'm not walking the spirit and good
[1:30:59] and evil right there and the good that I
[1:31:01] wanted to do I don't do but he says not
[1:31:05] either do it it's not the soul it's not
[1:31:08] the CGT it's the sin that growth within
[1:31:11] me and I've got the daily crucify the
[1:31:14] lusts and the affections thereof and
[1:31:16] when I do that then I walk in the spirit
[1:31:19] then there's no condemnation to them
[1:31:21] that are in Christ Jesus
[1:31:23] uh-huh bori amen amen
[1:31:29] what a blessing the Word of God is I
[1:31:34] remember again remember brother BAM said
[1:31:36] the same thing he said I can't prove
[1:31:38] that my name's there
[1:31:39] he said God could use me as a tool for
[1:31:42] something else he never got harder
[1:31:45] you're prideful and said look how much
[1:31:47] better I am than all of you I'm a
[1:31:49] prophet I see visions I preach the seven
[1:31:52] seals he now you know he never exalted
[1:31:54] himself like that
[1:31:55] he was humble because he was an example
[1:31:58] to us and we should take that same
[1:32:01] example in fact I was preaching last
[1:32:03] week on how Jesus said he told the
[1:32:06] disciples you know the rich young ruler
[1:32:08] came and they said my goodness can
[1:32:10] anybody be saved and then Peter pipes up
[1:32:14] and says Lord he said we've left
[1:32:16] everything what do you have for us and
[1:32:19] he said you'll receive a hundredfold in
[1:32:22] this life both in this
[1:32:24] and the world to come and he said you
[1:32:26] will sit on the 12 Thrones judging the
[1:32:29] 12 tribes of Israel and brother ramen
[1:32:33] one to those quotes he mentions that and
[1:32:35] he says ma he said look at those Apple
[1:32:38] style judges he said now I don't want to
[1:32:40] do that he said I don't want to I don't
[1:32:42] need a big shot like he said I don't
[1:32:44] need a big place
[1:32:45] he said just let me sit at Jesus's feet
[1:32:48] for a thousand years now look we know
[1:32:54] brother Graham's gonna get something
[1:32:56] like that he's going to get some great
[1:32:57] reward but he wasn't in it for that he
[1:33:01] was in it because of the grace of Christ
[1:33:03] amen the level of Jesus the love of the
[1:33:07] Lord and he said I don't want none of
[1:33:10] that but yet we know and he would he
[1:33:11] crossed over he was high lifted up and
[1:33:13] he was the leader and enough to be
[1:33:15] judged by that and remember the leaders
[1:33:18] get judged more strictly than others so
[1:33:22] it's not a desirable thing but look how
[1:33:24] humble he is we know he will present us
[1:33:27] the later see abroad he will present us
[1:33:30] to Christ because Paul said in second
[1:33:34] Corinthians 11 that he would present
[1:33:36] them to Christ as a chaste virgin and
[1:33:40] the Prophet said that's a special
[1:33:42] promise to each church age messenger so
[1:33:45] their God chooses a man who doesn't
[1:33:48] really want to be there well you can let
[1:33:49] brothers owns a let brother happen and
[1:33:51] God brings up brother Branham he doesn't
[1:33:55] want to be there but God brings him up
[1:33:56] there because he's so humble because of
[1:34:00] the grace of God I'm not exhausting
[1:34:03] brother Branham do you understand I'm
[1:34:05] just saying that's what grace produces
[1:34:07] in our hearts
[1:34:10] it produces humility Who am I what have
[1:34:14] I done what can I do that compares to
[1:34:17] anything Jesus did I have nothing to
[1:34:20] show
[1:34:21] I love the humility of the Gods prophet
[1:34:24] amen now I just a better speed up here
[1:34:30] yeah there you go
[1:34:32] halfway done with my hour now remember
[1:34:37] wisdom I want to look a little more not
[1:34:39] in the scripture wisdom is an individual
[1:34:42] gift how we know that but also wisdom is
[1:34:45] the attribute for all Christians so
[1:34:48] every Christian has a measure of wisdom
[1:34:50] but there's some people that have an
[1:34:52] extra measure and it's the gift of God
[1:34:54] it's one of the nine gifts of the Spirit
[1:34:56] but Ram said the greatest of all gifts
[1:34:58] that's in the local body
[1:34:59] he says his wisdom he says is that right
[1:35:01] the next is knowledge how are you going
[1:35:03] to operate now it's when you haven't got
[1:35:05] wisdom to operate it
[1:35:07] if you don't haven't got no wisdom you
[1:35:10] can't operate the knowledge haven't
[1:35:11] gotten out you won't know how to have
[1:35:12] peace you've got the first things first
[1:35:14] not no evidence he said upon the Spirit
[1:35:17] of God she's talking about tongues
[1:35:19] tongues are not the evidence he said
[1:35:21] because wisdom is actually listening
[1:35:22] first a man and look at Ephesians 1:17
[1:35:27] can we put it up there Ephesians 1:17
[1:35:29] just so everybody can see it
[1:35:30] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:33] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:35:36] how many how many want that to be you
[1:35:39] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:35:45] the knowledge of him I can't think of a
[1:35:49] better duo than that wisdom and
[1:35:51] revelation wisdom I know what God wants
[1:35:55] done and revelation is unveiling of thus
[1:35:59] saith the Lord
[1:36:00] good amen I know how to take the
[1:36:04] knowledge and all this but God has also
[1:36:06] revealed himself to me he's taking the
[1:36:09] curtain away and things that I struggle
[1:36:11] it before I now see clearly I know what
[1:36:14] I'm looking at I'm looking at Christ I'm
[1:36:17] looking at the word
[1:36:21] hallelujah
[1:36:23] but now let's move to this year
[1:36:25] now you remembered also that the Bible
[1:36:29] said before wisdom is what the fear of
[1:36:31] the Lord and the Bible said the fear of
[1:36:35] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[1:36:37] and brother Ram preaches this I can't
[1:36:39] think of the message right now I don't
[1:36:40] have the quote in front of me
[1:36:42] respect 61 yeah there it is but Ram said
[1:36:46] the fear of the Lord you must have
[1:36:47] reverence for God God demands respects
[1:36:51] and brother man brings it down to his
[1:36:53] life he said I fear my wife he said I
[1:36:57] fear my mother he said I fear he said I
[1:37:00] fear the mayor of Jeffersonville he said
[1:37:04] I fear my children I feel that I fear
[1:37:06] the church he said because I don't want
[1:37:09] to do anything that would cause them to
[1:37:11] stumble so when you've got the fear of
[1:37:16] God you Reverend Scott you know God is
[1:37:18] watching all your thoughts and every
[1:37:21] decision that you make and because of
[1:37:25] that you're careful how you treat your
[1:37:27] wife or your husband or your children or
[1:37:30] the mayor you get a chance to talk to
[1:37:33] the Sheffield mayor I don't know if you
[1:37:34] do or not but if you do you'll be a
[1:37:36] light in the witness you'll be careful
[1:37:39] how you act around them people should
[1:37:42] sense my there's something different
[1:37:43] about you because you've been with
[1:37:46] somebody greater than the mayor amen
[1:37:48] you've been with Christ amen I said
[1:37:51] brother and said about Elijah Elisha to
[1:37:53] hear a hab and all of his entourage
[1:37:55] because he'd been with somebody greater
[1:37:57] than a half it was God Almighty amen
[1:38:00] Lorie that's exactly right now
[1:38:07] the fear of the Lord the Bible said is
[1:38:09] the depart from evil so you know you
[1:38:13] fear God when you run from evil we were
[1:38:17] preaching at our Bible Club we do two
[1:38:18] Bible clubs one the Arrowhead the
[1:38:20] elementary went the middle school
[1:38:21] arrowheads on Thursday middle schools on
[1:38:23] Tuesday and we were teaching on how to
[1:38:26] use wisdom with the Internet and one of
[1:38:28] the boys got ahold of it you know one of
[1:38:30] the scriptures I mean we must have
[1:38:31] taught or read and he said one of my
[1:38:33] friends took his cell phone and tried to
[1:38:35] show me a dirty picture he said mr.
[1:38:37] Smith I took that phone and I threw it
[1:38:38] across the room and I said oh the wisdom
[1:38:41] of a child
[1:38:44] how many would say lord help me to have
[1:38:46] that kind of wisdom that's wisdom that
[1:38:50] was true fearing the Lord you see
[1:38:54] something that's offensive to the Holy
[1:38:55] Spirit and you depart from it instantly
[1:38:58] you don't hang around and see how long I
[1:39:01] can handle to cuss words will mean I can
[1:39:03] handle three will be backing into four I
[1:39:06] can handle five half-dressed people no
[1:39:08] you're supposed to run from it instantly
[1:39:10] praise God we're supposed to turn from
[1:39:13] the evil snare praise God for our bodies
[1:39:16] on the temple of the Lord amen that's
[1:39:22] right and the Bible said you're happier
[1:39:25] when you're fearing God all day long
[1:39:26] that joy brother Samuel is talking about
[1:39:29] that's when you'll be joyful because you
[1:39:30] know oh you know you're pleasing your
[1:39:32] Lord all the Lord kept me from this
[1:39:34] temptation the Lord kept me from that
[1:39:36] temptation my I'm having a great day
[1:39:38] I'm walking in the spirit I've got
[1:39:41] victory today praise the Lord Amen now
[1:39:47] wisdom comes down to this wisdom comes
[1:39:50] down to obedience to the Word of God
[1:39:54] because the Bible said that obedience is
[1:39:57] better than sacrifice remember with Saul
[1:40:01] Saul he was supposed to kill all the
[1:40:03] animals before Samuel got there and
[1:40:06] that's when Samuel brought out that
[1:40:08] wisdom that it's better to obey than to
[1:40:11] sacrifice right so wisdom is obedience
[1:40:17] for that specific situation that you're
[1:40:19] in
[1:40:20] and it's greater than sacrifice a lot of
[1:40:23] people will say this you know when it
[1:40:24] comes to church they'll say well if I
[1:40:26] just I'll skip Wednesday night and I'll
[1:40:29] just listen to it on Thursday and they
[1:40:31] don't get to it on Thursday
[1:40:34] Rogers skip Sunday morning or Sunday
[1:40:37] night I'll just skip that and I'll make
[1:40:40] up for later see that what they're
[1:40:41] trying to make a sacrifice rather than
[1:40:44] obey the Word of God well I can't pay my
[1:40:47] ties this week
[1:40:48] all right then next week I'll just give
[1:40:50] a little extra offering and next week's
[1:40:52] comes and the Bible says like holes in
[1:40:54] your pockets all the money's found all
[1:40:56] of your pockets because you know by God
[1:40:58] the first time Oh hallelujah
[1:41:02] it's exactly right wisdom is obeying and
[1:41:07] it's greater than sacrifice now church
[1:41:12] we need to learn I think we can learn
[1:41:14] from the most from the wisest person in
[1:41:17] the Bible outside of Christ who was that
[1:41:19] Solomon but RAM says Solomon had a gift
[1:41:23] of you knew it he had a gift of wisdom
[1:41:28] and discernment brother Branham said
[1:41:30] Solomon literally saw God twice our
[1:41:35] prophet saw him three times
[1:41:38] Solomon seen him twice God revealed
[1:41:41] himself unto Solomon and Solomon started
[1:41:44] off his kingdom in a mighty way huh me
[1:41:45] know that how many have you how many
[1:41:48] have seen that though people start out
[1:41:50] in the message really full go really on
[1:41:52] fire really going good but pretty soon
[1:41:54] the cares of the world start getting
[1:41:56] them down that's how Solomon was he
[1:41:59] started out on fire with this gift of
[1:42:02] wisdom it was the oddest time it was a
[1:42:04] like a honeymoon time for Israel the
[1:42:07] Golden Age it started out because he
[1:42:11] honored the gift of wisdom but you know
[1:42:14] the Bible said it came to pass when he
[1:42:16] was old in 1st Kings 11 for that his
[1:42:20] wives turned away his heart after other
[1:42:22] gods
[1:42:24] and his heart was not perfect with the
[1:42:26] Lord is God as was the heart of David
[1:42:28] his father for Solomon went after Astra
[1:42:34] the goddess of the zidonians and after
[1:42:36] milcom the abominations of the am writes
[1:42:38] and Solomon did evil maasai Lord and
[1:42:40] went not fully after the Lord as did
[1:42:44] David his father then did Salman look
[1:42:48] now look look how far sin takes him sin
[1:42:50] will always take you farther than you
[1:42:51] want to go a little compromise once you
[1:42:56] compromise on that the next things a
[1:42:58] little bit easier to get into and the
[1:43:02] man who built the greatest earthly
[1:43:05] tabernacle at least that I'm aware of to
[1:43:07] God the same man who built the greatest
[1:43:10] earthly temple for God he now he starts
[1:43:13] building temples for all the other gods
[1:43:16] can you imagine that
[1:43:19] and Solomon did even sigh Lord and went
[1:43:23] not flee after the Lord then verse 7
[1:43:24] then he built a high place for Chima the
[1:43:26] abomination of Moab in a hill that's
[1:43:28] before Jerusalem and for Moloch and the
[1:43:29] abomination of children of Ammon and
[1:43:31] likewise did he for all his strange one
[1:43:34] it's not that he just built one building
[1:43:37] for his gods it was one for every God of
[1:43:42] all his wives the wisest man did the
[1:43:47] consumers never agree with brother
[1:43:48] Branham on that the wisest man outside
[1:43:50] of Christ time started working on the
[1:43:53] devil started working him over time
[1:43:55] pretty soon he compromised for one wife
[1:43:57] and then now he's got to compromise for
[1:44:00] another oh we don't want that
[1:44:02] compromising spirit in here we're gonna
[1:44:07] stand year after year after year if we
[1:44:10] got a say in decade after decade after
[1:44:13] decade we know will not compromise on
[1:44:15] God's holy word can you imagine walking
[1:44:21] in Jerusalem at the beginning of Simon's
[1:44:22] reign you know seven years after he
[1:44:24] built the temple there is my lorries
[1:44:27] come back a few late years later and
[1:44:29] right beside that is Moloch and asteroth
[1:44:32] his temple like how in the world how did
[1:44:34] that slip past Solomon
[1:44:36] how did that slip past the man went to
[1:44:39] get the wisdom it's because he gave his
[1:44:43] heart to his wives and his wives turned
[1:44:47] his heart away from obeying the Word of
[1:44:50] God
[1:44:51] does every understand that and look at
[1:44:55] verse 9 was God happy with this no and
[1:44:58] the Lord was angry with Solomon because
[1:45:02] his heart was turned from the Lord God
[1:45:03] of Israel which had appeared unto him
[1:45:05] twice I just can't even wrap my mind or
[1:45:09] I just want to see God one time in a
[1:45:11] vision I haven't I just want to see him
[1:45:13] one time but Solomon seen him twice seen
[1:45:16] God Almighty twice and still decided to
[1:45:21] build these Tabernacles
[1:45:22] that proves it doesn't matter how many
[1:45:24] experiences you have you've got to have
[1:45:26] a daily experience hey I appreciate
[1:45:32] experiences times when I felt the
[1:45:33] presence of God or times God has healed
[1:45:35] people I prayed for but that does
[1:45:37] nothing about today today I've got to
[1:45:39] follow Christ today I've got to build
[1:45:42] Christ in my life and not build things
[1:45:45] for the world
[1:45:46] I must invest in Christ today a phrase
[1:45:49] the Lord and then you read the book of
[1:45:52] Ecclesiastes I haven't preached on this
[1:45:54] book but in that book Solomon goes
[1:45:56] through these five W's he tried
[1:45:58] everything he tried women and that
[1:46:02] didn't satisfy him young people a person
[1:46:05] won't satisfy you maybe there'll be a
[1:46:07] blessing to you my wife's a tremendous
[1:46:09] blessing to me I hope I'm a tremendous
[1:46:11] blessing to her but that's not the
[1:46:15] ultimate satisfaction
[1:46:18] he tried women then he tried wine the
[1:46:22] Bible said that if you read the cleese
[1:46:23] yesyes then he tried wealth he acquired
[1:46:27] more money than everybody else and then
[1:46:29] he cried then he tried wisdom just
[1:46:30] earthly wisdom all the books and memory
[1:46:34] he studied so much he got tired and then
[1:46:37] the thing he tried was works
[1:46:39] he tried rebuilding cities and building
[1:46:42] things he thought all these things would
[1:46:43] satisfy and all those five W's didn't
[1:46:46] satisfy because there's only one
[1:46:48] that satisfies and that's the word of
[1:46:51] God amen
[1:46:52] Cory the Living Word of God for today
[1:46:59] and young people you can try any of
[1:47:01] those things and I tried some of those
[1:47:03] things before I was saved and they never
[1:47:05] satisfied I always was empty but then
[1:47:08] Christ came to fill me amen
[1:47:13] and God knows this on my heart there's
[1:47:16] nothing more I'd rather do than preach
[1:47:17] God's Word it is the greatest thrill of
[1:47:20] my life to preach God's Word and to feed
[1:47:23] God's sheep the food of God that they
[1:47:25] need if you could ask me what would you
[1:47:28] do to go to Game seven of the finals of
[1:47:30] the Super Bowl or would you be present
[1:47:32] itíd States I'd say let me do one thing
[1:47:34] let me preach the people who are hungry
[1:47:36] to hears the Word of God amen
[1:47:40] then we'll see heaven come down to earth
[1:47:43] amen hallelujah it is the greatest
[1:47:47] privilege of our lives to serve the Lord
[1:47:49] Jesus Christ programs and Satan's wisdom
[1:47:56] was seen in Genesis 3
[1:47:57] he said wisdom as Satan was presenting
[1:48:00] to her said you shall not surely die see
[1:48:02] it's trying to make the Word of God say
[1:48:04] something that isn't so he said that's
[1:48:07] what wisdom is today oh brother how they
[1:48:10] how we tarry on that the seminary
[1:48:12] schools of theology that's they're very
[1:48:13] nests that's their grassroots is trying
[1:48:15] to make God's Word say something that it
[1:48:18] doesn't so anytime the Word of God says
[1:48:22] something and Satan says oh it doesn't
[1:48:24] do that nothing bad will happen to you
[1:48:26] you know you know that you you can
[1:48:28] compromise a little bit that is the
[1:48:30] wisdom of Satan the wisdom of God will
[1:48:33] tell you keep the Word of God now let me
[1:48:37] go in this thought here this is the
[1:48:38] middle thought I want to hit just before
[1:48:40] I close but the close may be but a
[1:48:43] little bit further so don't get caught
[1:48:45] up on that word clothes
[1:48:48] we're still open for business right now
[1:48:51] but go to numbers 19 if you had numbers
[1:48:54] 19 this is a thought I just want to
[1:48:56] bring out it's when I preached
[1:48:58] repeatedly at our at our church and I
[1:49:00] preached that brother Tim Humes and
[1:49:02] brother Brooks his church there's two
[1:49:04] churches out there in Iowa now praise
[1:49:05] God one in Iowa City and one in Des
[1:49:08] Moines and preaching at both churches
[1:49:10] there and God did it was just a
[1:49:12] wonderful thing there but numbers 19 you
[1:49:18] know Solomon's heart got turned away
[1:49:20] glory it got turned away by lusts and
[1:49:26] then it was at that moment as soon as he
[1:49:29] did that it's almost as if his spiritual
[1:49:31] life died and he stopped growing
[1:49:37] he stopped drawing closer to the Lord
[1:49:40] where did it start it started in his
[1:49:43] home whichever wife it was out of the
[1:49:46] thousand I don't know which one started
[1:49:49] it but that's filthy I don't know which
[1:49:55] one it was but one of them in the house
[1:49:57] convinced him let's build this you know
[1:50:00] it's just for my dad when he comes to
[1:50:02] visit you know when you're in law just
[1:50:06] for the in-laws no we'll just get a TV
[1:50:09] for the in love what's your social drink
[1:50:14] you know at the restaurant you know
[1:50:15] because it's dark there nobody will see
[1:50:17] us it's okay we'll just wear shorts when
[1:50:21] it's when it's really hot at see your
[1:50:23] point
[1:50:23] we won't wear them any other time just a
[1:50:26] Cedar Point we'll let the kids wear
[1:50:28] swimsuits you know just the kalahari is
[1:50:31] that that's close to here right that's
[1:50:32] pretty close to here or whatever it is I
[1:50:34] forget Kalahari there's another one what
[1:50:36] is it is it Kalahari okay I know there
[1:50:39] was another one you know they just start
[1:50:41] off and it starts we'll just make that
[1:50:43] decision and it starts the death
[1:50:44] actually starts in the home that's where
[1:50:49] it started for Solomon
[1:50:53] now it's interesting church is that in
[1:50:58] numbers 19 it's the laws of purification
[1:51:01] for sin it's the waters of separation
[1:51:04] how many are familiar with this I hope
[1:51:07] you are if not you're I think you really
[1:51:09] like this here by God's grace it was a
[1:51:11] real blessing to me remember
[1:51:13] the waters of separation was for every
[1:51:18] every believer and it was it was so
[1:51:23] important the Bible tells us plainly
[1:51:26] that if you didn't get sprinkle by the
[1:51:31] waters of separation you were cut off
[1:51:33] from the church and it didn't matter if
[1:51:36] you were a stranger you just came into
[1:51:39] the message or if you were actually
[1:51:41] someone already in the message already
[1:51:43] part of Israel it didn't matter if you
[1:51:47] touch something dead or something died
[1:51:50] in your house you were unclean that's
[1:51:55] what the scripture says and I want to
[1:51:57] just make a few things here remember how
[1:52:00] the Bible said when they would kill the
[1:52:02] red heifer they would have to take the
[1:52:04] blood and they'd catch the blood and
[1:52:06] then have to go down to the tabernacle
[1:52:07] and after sprinkle at seven times I
[1:52:10] remember that and brother Ram said
[1:52:12] there's blood for every church age so as
[1:52:15] Ephesus Smyrna pirate ear of Pergamos
[1:52:18] right Philadelphia Sardis and then there
[1:52:22] was blood for Laodicea glory the blood
[1:52:27] of Jesus Christ has been sprinkled in
[1:52:29] heaven for this generation bearishness
[1:52:33] and it's the same blood that was there
[1:52:35] for Ephesus amen
[1:52:37] the same blood that forgave Paul the
[1:52:40] same of blood that redeemed Peter after
[1:52:42] all of his mistakes that same blood is
[1:52:44] for you and I today amen hallelujah it's
[1:52:49] the same blood and it's for everyone
[1:52:52] it's for whether there's a stranger
[1:52:55] because look at verse 10 numbers 19 10
[1:52:57] if you can pull it up and either gather
[1:52:59] with the ashes in the heifer cell wash
[1:53:00] his clothes and be unclean until the
[1:53:02] even it shall be under the children of
[1:53:04] Israel and unto the stranger that
[1:53:06] sojourneth among them every Jewish
[1:53:10] believer was under this law of the
[1:53:12] waters of separation no matter if you
[1:53:15] just started the church yesterday or if
[1:53:18] you've been the church your whole life
[1:53:21] everyone had to be cleansed this way
[1:53:23] there was no excuses if you didn't get
[1:53:26] sprinkled you were cut off no matter how
[1:53:29] much of a faithful church member you
[1:53:32] were because there's one way for
[1:53:34] cleansing and that is through the blood
[1:53:37] how many understand that go to verse 13
[1:53:40] numbers 19 13 I'll just read over there
[1:53:45] whosoever touches the dead body of any
[1:53:47] man that's dead and purified not himself
[1:53:49] defiles the tabernacle Lord and that
[1:53:51] soul should be cut off from Israel
[1:53:53] because the water separation was not
[1:53:54] sprinkled upon him he should be unclean
[1:53:56] his uncleanness is yet upon him go to
[1:53:59] verse 20 verse 20 says very much the
[1:54:04] same thing here but the man that shall
[1:54:05] be unclean and shall not purify himself
[1:54:07] that soul shall be cut off from among
[1:54:09] the congregation because he's the file
[1:54:11] the sanctuary of the Lord the water
[1:54:13] separation has not been sprinkled upon
[1:54:15] him he is unclean right
[1:54:18] isn't that striking church and I
[1:54:21] wondered for so long how can people come
[1:54:23] to church and be so happy in Jesus and
[1:54:25] just give them a few months and then act
[1:54:28] like they don't even care about the
[1:54:29] preaching they would cry for the cross
[1:54:33] they would thank God for the cross and
[1:54:35] weep and cry but give them a month or
[1:54:37] two or maybe six months or a year and
[1:54:39] pretty soon they they don't really get
[1:54:41] excited about the word anymore
[1:54:43] and I always wanted that for years how
[1:54:46] can this happen how does this happen but
[1:54:49] the Bible tells us this in verse 14 a
[1:54:52] 3:14 Numbers 1914 this is the law when a
[1:54:57] man diet in a tent all that come into
[1:55:00] the tent and all that is in the tent
[1:55:01] shall be unclean seven days look at
[1:55:04] verse 15
[1:55:06] and every open vessel which has no
[1:55:08] covering bound upon it is unclean now
[1:55:15] don't let me lose you here stay with me
[1:55:17] ever take a deep breath can really do
[1:55:19] that refresh yourself I don't want to
[1:55:23] lose you at 50 minutes into the sermon
[1:55:25] here I just got a little bit more to go
[1:55:27] if you bear with me here
[1:55:28] but listen everybody had a tact no
[1:55:31] matter how long you've been the message
[1:55:32] if something died in your tent you were
[1:55:36] unclean and everything that was open was
[1:55:39] exposed to the the evil that that death
[1:55:44] every open vessel was unclean and it was
[1:55:48] your job as the father of the house to
[1:55:52] take you and your whole family and even
[1:55:54] your tent and your you that they would
[1:55:56] come to you with the sprinkling and they
[1:55:59] would sprinkle this blood of this waters
[1:56:01] of separation on you and then you had to
[1:56:03] wait seven day or three days you had to
[1:56:05] take a bath after three days and they
[1:56:06] come back the seventh day and then they
[1:56:08] say you're clean on the seventh day but
[1:56:11] what if you didn't do that what if you
[1:56:15] didn't go to church and confess your
[1:56:17] faults to the people you sinned against
[1:56:21] they could cut you off pretty soon
[1:56:24] praise the Lord and I think that's one
[1:56:29] thing that shows a real maturity of
[1:56:30] Christians were most mature when we can
[1:56:33] confess and confront sin I found that
[1:56:37] the most mature Christians and I know
[1:56:39] our people who can talk about their
[1:56:41] mistakes and go to that person one on
[1:56:44] one and do exactly what Jesus said in
[1:56:46] Matthew 18 because it's so easy for us
[1:56:50] to talk about it with somebody else or
[1:56:53] talk about it on Facebook rather than
[1:56:56] talk about it to the person individually
[1:56:58] right is that right
[1:57:02] so something dies in your home and all
[1:57:05] everything's death we've got to get
[1:57:07] right with God a church listen if they
[1:57:10] didn't get right with God right away
[1:57:13] they couldn't even go and worship at the
[1:57:15] church the priest would keep them out of
[1:57:18] something died it's your house it was
[1:57:19] reported last week you can't get in here
[1:57:22] and so they go back to their tent well
[1:57:25] when are we gonna do this water
[1:57:26] separation well I don't know I'm too
[1:57:27] busy I gotta work tomorrow the big games
[1:57:31] tonight how can I go to the waters of
[1:57:32] separation how can I do that I mean I've
[1:57:38] got this I'm gonna take care of all
[1:57:39] these things okay and so they would sit
[1:57:41] out service after service and they
[1:57:43] wouldn't enjoy how the priest would make
[1:57:46] sacrifices the people bring their
[1:57:47] sacrifices it would go up they'd be
[1:57:49] forgiven and the priest would go in the
[1:57:51] whole Easter place and one day year then
[1:57:53] the high priest would go in the holiest
[1:57:55] of Holies but they were physically kept
[1:57:59] out of the glory of that worship and so
[1:58:03] people today are kept out spiritually of
[1:58:06] the glory of the worship when they fail
[1:58:09] to get cleansed by the waters of
[1:58:10] separation Peter says that the waters he
[1:58:16] said your sprinkled with the blood of
[1:58:18] Jesus Christ he said unto obedience so
[1:58:21] when you confess and say I'm wrong
[1:58:23] forgive me when you do that the Bible
[1:58:27] says you get sprinkled with an anointing
[1:58:29] Lord when you finally obey the Word of
[1:58:33] God and confess you're wrong and say
[1:58:35] you're sorry and really mean it
[1:58:36] it's spiritually a waters of separation
[1:58:39] has sprinkled upon you and now you're
[1:58:42] clean and now you can get somewhere with
[1:58:44] God they would physically be kept out of
[1:58:51] the tabernacle because something
[1:58:53] physically died in their homes but today
[1:58:58] it's so much more deceptive because now
[1:59:02] they could come to church and sit in the
[1:59:05] tabernacle or come to the altar and if
[1:59:08] they're they don't confess their sins
[1:59:09] they get no closer to God the Bible
[1:59:13] calls it grieving the Holy Spirit in
[1:59:15] Ephesians 4:30 now think about this
[1:59:19] church every open vessel in the tent was
[1:59:21] exposed to the death how many got little
[1:59:25] children at home
[1:59:26] got a lot of open vessels in your home
[1:59:28] those children are just going to soak in
[1:59:30] whatever you say whatever you watch
[1:59:32] whatever you do they're just going to
[1:59:35] soak in everything that you do but if
[1:59:37] something dies if there's something dead
[1:59:39] if there's a sin that's laying in your
[1:59:41] home it will affect them as well I think
[1:59:45] as parents we can all say amen to that
[1:59:48] if I make a mistake it may rub off on my
[1:59:51] children if I make a mistake it may rub
[1:59:54] off on my wife we've got to limit our
[1:59:58] mistakes we've got to purge the sin
[2:00:00] we've got the purge that's dead stuff
[2:00:02] because it makes everything open in our
[2:00:04] house ever it makes everything dirty and
[2:00:07] it makes it unclean
[2:00:09] so that means TV's and movies and bad
[2:00:13] websites pervert the house right any
[2:00:20] compromise on the Word of God will
[2:00:23] affect the house so now we see what
[2:00:27] happened to Solomon can we all see what
[2:00:28] happened to Solomon one little
[2:00:30] compromise in this house caused death in
[2:00:33] this house and then it spread to the
[2:00:35] entire kingdom
[2:00:36] oh my you see it all the time people all
[2:00:42] just make a little exception for I just
[2:00:44] want to watch this movie it's just the
[2:00:45] kids movie and those are some of the
[2:00:47] raunchiest nastiest movies there are you
[2:00:50] understand I know because I got 20 of
[2:00:53] them in my class that tell me all about
[2:00:54] the movies I'm like I don't want to hear
[2:00:56] about that dirty jokes and all kinds of
[2:00:59] evil all kinds of perversion coming from
[2:01:02] Disney or whatever moved Pixar movies
[2:01:04] whatever they are b/c it's because
[2:01:06] they're exposed to death in the 10th oh
[2:01:09] my god help us Church
[2:01:16] now I wanted to say this here one thing
[2:01:22] that we must be careful of is our
[2:01:24] unconfessed sin the Prophet said your
[2:01:26] misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you
[2:01:29] believers can cause this church to
[2:01:31] bitterly fail and at the day of judgment
[2:01:33] you'll be responsible for every bit of
[2:01:35] it let me know that ache and his brother
[2:01:39] Brandon is an example from the Bible
[2:01:41] Aitken hid this things in his house
[2:01:43] where's always go back to the house he
[2:01:46] hid the Babylonian garment the wedge he
[2:01:49] hid it in his house and because of that
[2:01:52] it caused the church to lose innocent
[2:01:54] lives and we're responsible humming oh
[2:01:57] we're responsible hey man if there's
[2:02:00] death in the house we've got to purge
[2:02:02] the house praise the Lord Amen now
[2:02:07] there's a lot of sins that get people
[2:02:10] and there's a lot of death that runs and
[2:02:14] one of the most popular ones today are
[2:02:16] movies like Star Wars that just came out
[2:02:17] this weekend last December I was
[2:02:22] preaching this similar message over
[2:02:24] there in North Carolina in Iowa two
[2:02:27] weekends in a row went to Iowa the next
[2:02:28] next weekend went to North Carolina and
[2:02:30] it just came out and Star Wars the other
[2:02:33] one came out there's my our Star Wars
[2:02:36] just come out and everybody was so
[2:02:37] excited about it and something mean I
[2:02:39] was I was studying out you know I heard
[2:02:40] the kids talking about it something
[2:02:41] started dealing with me and I just went
[2:02:44] to the scripture and I thought what is
[2:02:45] the real Star Wars and I saw how the
[2:02:49] Bible God promised Abraham that your
[2:02:51] descendants will be as the stars of
[2:02:53] heaven and so the real star wars are
[2:02:57] believers who are fighting the good
[2:03:01] fight of faith praise God and people
[2:03:04] today are so caught up this weekend I
[2:03:06] think it's the solo movie because all
[2:03:08] the children we're talking about it I
[2:03:09] don't go to trash like that we used you
[2:03:11] shouldn't either but they're all excited
[2:03:14] about the Star Wars and and then my
[2:03:17] heart went to Revelation 19 how at the
[2:03:21] Battle of Armageddon there's going to be
[2:03:23] a real Star Wars because all the stars
[2:03:26] are going to come from heaven
[2:03:28] writing white horses and god's own son
[2:03:32] will be the leading one and a sword will
[2:03:36] come out of his mouth and it'll smite
[2:03:38] every nation praise God
[2:03:40] it'll smite the unbelievers so that's
[2:03:44] just the perversion the Star Wars it's
[2:03:46] just the perversion of what you and I
[2:03:48] are doing now we're battling amen
[2:03:51] for the kingdom of God amen
[2:03:54] it's exactly right so that's just a
[2:03:58] perversion just like tattoos are
[2:04:00] perversion people want us they want to
[2:04:03] write things up they just want to see it
[2:04:05] to get inspiration they want to write it
[2:04:07] they want to draw it they just want to
[2:04:09] they will never everybody know this is
[2:04:10] what I am now I put all my children's
[2:04:12] names here or whatever this is what I am
[2:04:14] that's just the perversion the real
[2:04:17] thing is the Holy Spirit writing his
[2:04:20] word upon the fleshly tables of your
[2:04:22] heart amen and that's why you here this
[2:04:27] morning
[2:04:27] to let the Holy Spirit write its word
[2:04:29] upon your heart amen
[2:04:31] it's such a perversion we've got to
[2:04:36] overcome these perversions with the
[2:04:39] wisdom of God amen
[2:04:44] now
[2:04:49] this is explains why for all these years
[2:04:51] that explains why people get so excited
[2:04:53] about the message but then after just a
[2:04:56] few little months and times they're no
[2:04:58] longer excited it's because they're
[2:04:59] spiritually cut off from the
[2:05:01] congregation think about it when you
[2:05:04] walk in and you're really prayed up in
[2:05:06] the Lord I mean your life you're trying
[2:05:08] every you're asking God for mercy
[2:05:10] you're repenting of your sins and you
[2:05:12] come excited to hear the hot the Word of
[2:05:13] God at the house of God you come and you
[2:05:17] come in and it don't matter if it's John
[2:05:19] 3:16 you can say praise the Lord you
[2:05:24] don't care if it's Genesis 1:1 you don't
[2:05:27] care what the preacher preaches on you
[2:05:28] can raise your hand and say hallelujah
[2:05:30] that's the truth I believe God's Word
[2:05:32] God's Word does something to you but see
[2:05:37] when God's Word doesn't move people it
[2:05:39] show something is wrong in their life
[2:05:42] something's died in their tent did you
[2:05:46] know brother Graham said this is lhara
[2:05:47] grace he said you know he said you
[2:05:50] getting some little mission out
[2:05:52] somewhere you know you might find a
[2:05:53] whole lot in there some spiritual
[2:05:55] vitamins God has got them for you to
[2:05:58] help your spirit to pep you up a little
[2:06:02] that's the preaching of the gospel so
[2:06:06] the gospel is your vitamins let me know
[2:06:08] that I hope somebody gets pepped up
[2:06:10] today if I know I'm getting packed up so
[2:06:13] hopefully you're getting packed up too
[2:06:15] my brother said that's the preaching the
[2:06:17] gospel
[2:06:17] if the preaching the gospel won't pep up
[2:06:20] the church there isn't nothing that will
[2:06:24] amen if this preaching last night this
[2:06:30] morning tomorrow morning if it doesn't
[2:06:32] pop you up nothing will because this is
[2:06:35] life
[2:06:37] and if it's not life and it's not lower
[2:06:40] than something's died in your turret
[2:06:42] amen
[2:06:43] [Music]
[2:06:45] you've got to come to the altar you've
[2:06:48] got to come see the priest you got to
[2:06:51] come priest sprinkled by the blood of
[2:06:52] Jesus unto obedience does ever
[2:06:55] understand that every stranger every
[2:06:58] person I don't care if you're in the
[2:06:59] message 40 years 50 years or like me uh
[2:07:02] how many years many message 17 years I
[2:07:05] don't care how long you been in when you
[2:07:08] at when we let something die when we not
[2:07:10] sin come into our lives
[2:07:11] it cuts us off from the blessing of God
[2:07:15] and it puts us in a very sad place let
[2:07:22] me look at one more thing here before I
[2:07:23] close so more thing
[2:07:26] think about this something died in a
[2:07:31] fence that's just called let's just call
[2:07:33] him the the Jewish family has called the
[2:07:34] Smith family something died in their
[2:07:37] house Oh something's died oh we let sing
[2:07:40] in our house we better go talk to the
[2:07:41] pastor so the man goes down to the
[2:07:44] pastor the pastors he says something
[2:07:47] died you know my dog died the house
[2:07:49] death is in her house we're all unclean
[2:07:50] will you come sprinkles he said yes sir
[2:07:52] I'll come right away he comes over he
[2:07:54] sprinkles the house he sprinkles the
[2:07:56] tent they take everything that was
[2:07:57] affected I their they clean it they all
[2:07:59] spring clip and then on the east end oh
[2:08:01] praise the Lord
[2:08:02] he wasn't clean yet the third day they
[2:08:06] got to keep all the dead stuff out the
[2:08:07] third day he goes take a bath he gets
[2:08:09] all washed he said oh my I'm ready to go
[2:08:13] to church and the priest says no you're
[2:08:14] not you got four more days to wait he
[2:08:19] waits four more days finally the priest
[2:08:21] comes his house and said all that all
[2:08:22] the dead stuff out and church that's
[2:08:24] what the Holy Spirit's doing does he
[2:08:26] wants to make sure we're really sincere
[2:08:28] about getting sin out of our lives
[2:08:31] praise God some people can keep up their
[2:08:35] deliverance for one day we need more
[2:08:37] than a one day victory God's not a one
[2:08:40] day victory kind of God right when Egypt
[2:08:44] when Israel came out of Egypt they
[2:08:45] weren't free for just three days they
[2:08:48] were free as frickin B
[2:08:50] and so when this family can keep it up
[2:08:52] for seven days oh praise the Lord now I
[2:08:54] can get back to the house of God now I
[2:08:56] can go worship now I can go sacrifice to
[2:08:59] my god so you bring his family and he'd
[2:09:02] bring the goat in or whatever they had
[2:09:04] they'd sacrifice it and he would feel
[2:09:06] the sin of that sacrifice and now he
[2:09:09] could cry at the altar and say praise
[2:09:10] the Lord my sins are forgiven before he
[2:09:14] couldn't experience that joy he couldn't
[2:09:18] experience and then the priests would
[2:09:19] washed their hands and they'd washed the
[2:09:21] sacrifice it had to rightly divide the
[2:09:24] sacrifice as preachers rightly divide
[2:09:27] the word of God and then it be rightly
[2:09:30] divided then they could go into the
[2:09:32] Holies the priest would go in there and
[2:09:33] church they would go in there and the
[2:09:35] first thing they would see is light from
[2:09:39] the tabernacle of the candlesticks there
[2:09:41] the candlesticks the menorah and this
[2:09:44] light would be manifesting and they
[2:09:46] would rejoice in the light that they had
[2:09:49] remember if you had sit in your home you
[2:09:52] couldn't experience the priest could
[2:09:54] experience this they wouldn't have this
[2:09:55] glorious light shining in their lives
[2:09:57] oh my go to Leviticus 24 here the
[2:10:08] biggest chapter 24 verse 1
[2:10:17] just a beautiful type here Church the
[2:10:22] biggest 24 verse one and the Lord spake
[2:10:23] unto Moses saying
[2:10:24] command the turn of Israel that they
[2:10:25] bring unto the unto the pure olive oil
[2:10:28] beaten for that light to cause the lamps
[2:10:30] to burn continually without the veil of
[2:10:32] the tavern or the testimony the
[2:10:34] tabernacle the congregation shall Aaron
[2:10:36] order from the evening unto the morning
[2:10:37] before the Lord continually it should be
[2:10:39] a statute forever in your generations
[2:10:42] you see this so everybody in the whole
[2:10:45] entire congregation had a part in the
[2:10:48] worship of God everybody played a
[2:10:51] crucial part the priests had to do their
[2:10:55] part but did you catch the scripture
[2:10:57] here it's the people who had to bring
[2:11:00] the beats in oil for the priests to use
[2:11:03] how many know that a preacher can't
[2:11:05] preach half a lick of a message unless
[2:11:06] the people bring in anointing - is that
[2:11:11] right see this was this was s was
[2:11:14] accountability everywhere if the peope
[2:11:17] if every tenth doesn't keep all the
[2:11:19] death out and then if every tenth isn't
[2:11:22] producing beat and oil
[2:11:23] oh my we're burning the midnight oil
[2:11:26] praise to the heart see there's either
[2:11:29] death in your home or there's oil being
[2:11:31] pressed out in your home amen
[2:11:33] either the Holy Ghost is in your home or
[2:11:36] death is in your home that's the way the
[2:11:39] church that Living God moves on and then
[2:11:42] the people of God brought this oil along
[2:11:44] with their worship and then they took
[2:11:46] this oil in and now the light the
[2:11:48] glorious light of the church ages can
[2:11:50] shine isn't that beautiful doesn't it
[2:11:57] prove to all of us how important
[2:11:58] everyone's household is the people's
[2:12:03] household had to be constantly beating
[2:12:05] the oil praying forgiving loving praying
[2:12:10] for the Holy Ghost praying for victory
[2:12:13] praying for healing all these things
[2:12:14] producing the right kind of life and
[2:12:16] they would bring that life to the house
[2:12:18] of God did you bring oil to the house of
[2:12:21] God this morning amen
[2:12:25] it's a beautiful thing to see it and I
[2:12:28] could go further remember the last thing
[2:12:30] before the holiest of Holies was the
[2:12:32] altar of incense the place of Prayer
[2:12:35] and this is like we saw earlier with the
[2:12:37] wisdom this is where you cry out to God
[2:12:40] your prayer is as incense before the
[2:12:43] Lord as I studied that there was four
[2:12:46] parts to the incense and you know that
[2:12:47] there's four parts to it and it fits
[2:12:49] that that acronym of pray PRA why that
[2:12:53] we taught in Sunday school it fits that
[2:12:55] perfectly where we have to praise God
[2:12:57] first and then repent of our sins and
[2:13:00] then ask out our request and then yield
[2:13:03] to God's will for our lives oh it's
[2:13:05] beautiful
[2:13:06] it's beautiful this is our worship this
[2:13:09] is how we approach to God this is what
[2:13:12] we must get the wisdom of God amen let
[2:13:16] me close with this here by God's grace I
[2:13:18] know I kept it too long here so forgive
[2:13:19] me let's go to back to Proverbs I want
[2:13:25] to finish there I hope you can see it by
[2:13:30] the grace of Lord I hope it be a
[2:13:31] blessing to you my God is so good to us
[2:13:34] let's go back to proverbs 15 6 proverbs
[2:13:39] 15 6
[2:13:49] so we started with the wise virgin and
[2:13:51] how we must get wisdom and look what the
[2:13:54] scripture says proverbs 15 6 in the
[2:13:57] house of the righteous is much treasure
[2:14:00] when the revenues of the wicked is
[2:14:03] trouble
[2:14:04] now bro Graham said very few rich people
[2:14:06] will even be saved because Jesus said
[2:14:08] that so the treasure Solomon's talking
[2:14:11] about is not money go to proverbs 21
[2:14:16] verse 20 21 verse 20 there is treasure
[2:14:23] to be desired and oil in the dwelling of
[2:14:27] the wise but a foolish man spend it up
[2:14:32] so where does it place this oil where's
[2:14:34] the wise version got her oil she's got
[2:14:36] it right in her home
[2:14:38] that's her treasure the baptism of the
[2:14:43] Holy Ghost glory look what the Bible
[2:14:49] says
[2:14:49] Rob let's go back to proverbs 3 32 for
[2:14:55] the froward is abomination to the Lord
[2:14:57] but his secret is with the righteous oh
[2:15:00] that's beautiful
[2:15:04] the secret is with them the treasure is
[2:15:07] in their home and the treasure is the
[2:15:09] oil in their home that's the treasure
[2:15:13] that they have their house is clean
[2:15:16] there's no death in the house and
[2:15:17] they've got plenty of oil they got
[2:15:19] plenty of treasure amen
[2:15:21] last Scripture revelation 2:19
[2:15:24] you can stand her feet let's stand here
[2:15:26] by God's grace revelation 2:19
[2:15:35] I know that works and charity and
[2:15:38] service and faith and patience and thy
[2:15:40] works and the last to be more than the
[2:15:44] first
[2:15:45] did you know brother Ram said this is
[2:15:48] the secret to overcoming Satan your life
[2:15:51] did you know the scripture is how many
[2:15:52] knew that brother Ram said this is the
[2:15:55] scripture this has the secret of God the
[2:15:59] Bible said the secret is with the
[2:16:01] righteous the oil is in the righteous
[2:16:03] home and here's what program says about
[2:16:06] this this is certainly remarkable this
[2:16:08] is in the church age book chapter 6 as
[2:16:09] the darkness of the age increased as the
[2:16:12] honor roll of the martyrs grew lengthy
[2:16:15] up day by day they worked all the harder
[2:16:17] they served all the more and their faith
[2:16:19] increased how tragic it was that in the
[2:16:22] Ephesian age love waned and truly
[2:16:25] nothing is said of the increased labor
[2:16:26] of love and the other ages but in this
[2:16:29] age the Thyatira age is the darkest of
[2:16:31] all ages they served him even more what
[2:16:36] a lesson that is there is no ceasing of
[2:16:41] this gracious service of love and to our
[2:16:44] Lord but rather an increasing of it that
[2:16:49] is the secret let the enemy attempt to
[2:16:54] thwart our service to the Lord
[2:16:56] our reply is increased service when the
[2:17:01] faint are crying in fear that is the
[2:17:03] time to shout the victory amen did you
[2:17:08] catch a church the secret to overcoming
[2:17:11] Satan's barrage is and attacks of death
[2:17:14] on our homes is to not lay off and not
[2:17:18] and well I'll just serve God less I'll
[2:17:20] just do a little less the secret is to
[2:17:22] reply and say devil shut up I'm giving
[2:17:25] God more of my time I'm giving God more
[2:17:28] of my love
[2:17:29] I'm giving God more of my service that
[2:17:32] is the secret that dwells with the
[2:17:35] righteous
[2:17:37] let's bow our heads for a moment by
[2:17:38] God's grace I just plate is so sweet to
[2:17:43] trust in Jesus can we play that would
[2:17:44] that be okay you know we're in an age
[2:17:49] where we're bombarded with reminders
[2:17:52] appointments schedules tests trials the
[2:17:58] Prophet said this is the most deceptive
[2:18:00] of all ages we live an extremely
[2:18:06] difficult time
[2:18:10] and we've got to keep our homes clean
[2:18:13] before the Lord we have to make sure
[2:18:15] nothing dead comes into our houses for
[2:18:20] once something Dead's once sin enters
[2:18:22] our house it affects the entire family
[2:18:25] it cuts us off from the blessing and
[2:18:29] love of the Lord we don't feel the same
[2:18:34] about the cross we don't feel the same
[2:18:36] about the blood we don't feel the same
[2:18:39] about the preaching of the word and
[2:18:41] we've all read this morning that wisdom
[2:18:44] is the principal thing and with all of
[2:18:47] our getting we should get understanding
[2:18:49] I wonder if there's anyone this morning
[2:18:53] that would say brother Jesse pray for me
[2:18:54] I've let some dead things get into my
[2:18:56] home bless those hands that's those
[2:19:01] hands let me pray for you
[2:19:04] now if your real sincere pray with me if
[2:19:06] you want the joy of the Lord to return
[2:19:09] that dead thing has to be sprinkled with
[2:19:11] the blood of Jesus Heavenly Father you
[2:19:15] saw the hands Lord bless those sincere
[2:19:17] honest hands Lord I believe your Holy
[2:19:22] Spirit has gone into their tent this
[2:19:24] morning and reveal to them perhaps why
[2:19:29] the joy of the Lord is gone why the love
[2:19:33] of the word is gone
[2:19:34] [Music]
[2:19:36] and Lord in your grace and mercy you
[2:19:38] come not to bring condemnation but to
[2:19:41] bring the waters of separation to

[2:20:15] Holy Spirit be poured out upon them O

[2:20:27] presence Lord God knowing that we are to
[2:20:30] get wisdom we're to get the perfect will
[2:20:32] of God we're not to settle for dead

[2:21:15] watch something about what they see nor
[2:21:21] that the open vessels are not

[2:24:56] [Music]
[2:25:09] preciousness us all for grace to trust
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:25] you're thankful for the word of the Lord
[2:25:29] you know I tell you the way the Lord
[2:25:32] just brought that this morning with
[2:25:34] wisdom looking inwardly in our tents you
[2:25:38] know the greatest thing that we can ever
[2:25:40] do when we come to a place that we feel
[2:25:43] like I'm good that's the very very place
[2:25:47] that were bad because it's the Word of
[2:25:52] God the ministering of the word when we
[2:25:55] look at what God has sent his word to us
[2:25:59] in this generation it was not a word
[2:26:03] that was given to us just so that we
[2:26:06] would have knowledge knowledge is a
[2:26:08] wonderful thing but if you remember just
[2:26:12] how the Lord spoke to us here this
[2:26:14] morning then you find brother Branham
[2:26:16] over and over from the seals you find
[2:26:19] him even after the seals almost every
[2:26:22] message brother Brown would ask you say
[2:26:25] God will you come and reveal to us that
[2:26:30] we might know we might know how to live
[2:26:34] in this day you see just this is not
[2:26:40] enough it's not enough but wisdom itself
[2:26:46] it comes not it's not a wisdom from us
[2:26:50] reading remember it takes more it takes
[2:26:54] an operation of the Holy Ghost you see
[2:26:57] we can look at print and we can take
[2:26:59] print and say ah this very this here
[2:27:02] this here but you see wisdom is has to
[2:27:05] be a discernment behind the situation a
[2:27:08] discernment behind to know how to apply
[2:27:11] and we're living in that moment where
[2:27:15] the Holy Spirit because the message that
[2:27:17] God has sent to us it points us and
[2:27:20] directs us and it will lead us into that
[2:27:23] token lie
[2:27:27] so the message is it directs us to that
[2:27:30] place and we need that wisdom of God
[2:27:34] like the Holy Spirit spoke and what a
[2:27:36] privilege it is for us as young people
[2:27:39] to be able to have access to call upon
[2:27:43] God you know this is an age where things
[2:27:45] are put right at our fingertips and I
[2:27:49] want you to think of what the Holy
[2:27:50] Spirit here at the end was directing to
[2:27:53] the tents because when you look in your
[2:27:56] life and sometimes you can look and say
[2:27:58] I want to see victory but remember
[2:28:01] victory does not start with someone else
[2:28:03] victory starts with you victory starts
[2:28:06] with me it's you having victory in your
[2:28:10] own life first see the enemy wants to
[2:28:13] deflect and distract our attention but
[2:28:15] victory starts inside of our vessel
[2:28:18] first and when victory is dwelling
[2:28:21] inside of our vessel it has an effect
[2:28:24] and can be an opening that others
[2:28:27] themselves can look at that and say what
[2:28:29] is it about this person why is this
[2:28:31] person the way they are well they're not
[2:28:34] they did their life is not as hard as
[2:28:36] minor they're not going through this or
[2:28:37] they've never been expected that we
[2:28:39] don't believe the devil's lies because
[2:28:42] that's the devil's lies one thing that
[2:28:44] we know is that God is faithful is
[2:28:48] faithful you know and and when we we
[2:28:52] look at how that God has provided for us
[2:28:55] within this hour that we truly by His
[2:28:58] grace can look to him we can seek after
[2:29:02] God and ask God to make himself known to
[2:29:05] us in this time and this is where we you
[2:29:08] think of it as as as young people young
[2:29:11] men young young young ladies there is so
[2:29:14] much of life that is ahead of you so
[2:29:16] many pathways so many so many directions
[2:29:19] to take but yet within it all as what
[2:29:22] brother Jesse was speaking here as the
[2:29:25] Lord was bringing that through him that
[2:29:26] that's all that matters you know when
[2:29:29] when God had when God did it did such a
[2:29:32] work in my life
[2:29:33] I just be very honest with you I didn't
[2:29:35] care about getting married now you might
[2:29:38] think
[2:29:38] I just didn't I my whole focus was is I
[2:29:43] just wanted to serve the Lord that's the
[2:29:46] truth and you know I remember my dad
[2:29:49] telling me you know my dad was trying to
[2:29:50] talk to me about the different things
[2:29:51] but really that's all I might that's all
[2:29:53] my joy was I never declared I was gonna
[2:29:55] be a Paul but I just that's my whole
[2:29:58] focus I just I was just in love with the
[2:30:01] Lord and I'm still in love with the Lord
[2:30:03] now that was a theme of my life I
[2:30:05] couldn't get enough and I I still can't
[2:30:07] get enough and then you know when my
[2:30:11] wife and I met and I've said this to the
[2:30:13] young people I've said it to everywhere
[2:30:15] I've went right now she is the number
[2:30:17] one person that I love to fellowship
[2:30:19] with about the word I've got a lot of
[2:30:22] other I've got a lot of friends brother
[2:30:23] Jesse in myself real good friends I've
[2:30:26] got a lot of other friends a lot of
[2:30:27] other ministry brothers but there is
[2:30:29] nobody that I love to fellowship with
[2:30:33] about the word but her and to tell you
[2:30:36] the truth you can ask the kids you can
[2:30:38] ask them what mom and daddy what is it
[2:30:41] that they talk about now I don't we
[2:30:43] don't go around the house and quote the
[2:30:44] scripture and throwing this out and can
[2:30:46] you finish this quote can't even known
[2:30:48] but sometimes she has to listen to me
[2:30:50] and then there's other times I'm
[2:30:51] listening to her but we there's such a
[2:30:53] fellowship this is our joy see see
[2:30:57] serving the Lord is not about coming to
[2:30:59] church it's not about just doing
[2:31:01] something it's not about just saying
[2:31:02] well I believe this you know I believe
[2:31:04] this and I believe God sent a prophet
[2:31:06] and I believe this I know it's more than
[2:31:08] that
[2:31:08] it's not a lifestyle it's a life that's
[2:31:12] God's that's what God's desire is for
[2:31:15] you is that you would have life and have
[2:31:17] it more abundantly
[2:31:18] and all it all it takes is the little
[2:31:21] things of what the Holy Spirit was
[2:31:23] speaking to your heart today there might
[2:31:25] have been one thing as a young person
[2:31:27] that you can you can say Lord you spoke
[2:31:30] to my heart it might have been something
[2:31:31] in your tent all you have to do is take
[2:31:34] that one little thing and say Lord I
[2:31:38] give this to you lord
[2:31:41] because and there could have been
[2:31:43] hundreds of people here but God still
[2:31:46] mindful of your need and God would speak
[2:31:49] in that manner just to make himself
[2:31:51] known to you and then you find yourself
[2:31:53] seeking after him in that and then
[2:31:56] you'll find it just starts it keeps
[2:32:00] going it keeps going because you obey
[2:32:02] his voice and little things
[2:32:04] he keeps opening keep some for me yeah
[2:32:06] you know the thing that I think is very
[2:32:09] very good that we can look at you know
[2:32:12] sometimes when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:32:14] conviction can strike but just listen
[2:32:17] listen to me just a moment if there's
[2:32:20] things that's on your phone or on your
[2:32:23] Facebook that you know it's not Ryan
[2:32:26] it's death
[2:32:27] don't try to reform it quit it you don't
[2:32:35] try to reform and I'm gonna switch the
[2:32:37] platform on it I'm gonna redo this no no
[2:32:38] because first of all you didn't have the
[2:32:40] right balance so they don't have the
[2:32:43] right balance you had to have the right
[2:32:44] foundation so don't just no don't just
[2:32:47] say well I'm gonna convert it all the
[2:32:48] scriptures and convert it all the quotes
[2:32:49] and no no no you have ever had the right
[2:32:52] foundation so it's not just erasing and
[2:32:55] it's not just well I'm gonna delete this
[2:32:57] app can you say why do you say that
[2:32:58] because you delete one app if you still
[2:33:01] don't get to the root of the issue
[2:33:02] you'll get another app you got yeah we
[2:33:06] have to understand what how is it that
[2:33:08] death came in you get to the root of the
[2:33:11] issue and the Holy Spirit
[2:33:13] over and over like brother Alexander
[2:33:15] spoke last night and Holy Spirit brought
[2:33:17] that one scripture out the axe is laid
[2:33:19] to the root of the tree when the
[2:33:23] scripture declares of of God Himself
[2:33:26] becoming one of us it says he is the
[2:33:28] root so God came to deal with the root
[2:33:30] of the issue so we're not we're not
[2:33:33] ignorant of Satan's devices because you
[2:33:36] can take one thing and say oh this oh
[2:33:39] yeah and you just get rid of this but
[2:33:41] you get rid of this and you really
[2:33:42] haven't gotten rid of it you have to get
[2:33:45] rid of here that's that's where as
[2:33:48] brother Jesse was speaking that's real
[2:33:51] deliverance
[2:33:52] because you don't get the root the weed
[2:33:55] comes back how many know I'm talking
[2:33:56] about the weed comes back you got to get
[2:33:58] the root you got to get the root and God
[2:34:03] is present to deliberate and to unearth
[2:34:07] all of those roots that's what I'm
[2:34:11] grateful for
[2:34:12] we're not let's listen to me now right
[2:34:15] here where we're standing it's not in
[2:34:17] any way I used to think in one way here
[2:34:19] we've come we've come to the message I
[2:34:21] know I was born and raised in the
[2:34:22] message but I remember one of the first
[2:34:23] times that I ever had dealt with the
[2:34:26] subject and I went to preach on a
[2:34:28] subject called the Feast of iniquity
[2:34:30] I thought why in the world am i
[2:34:32] preaching this is a message church and I
[2:34:34] just started ministering but I preached
[2:34:36] the Feast of iniquity and I thought what
[2:34:39] but what I really what you realize is
[2:34:41] we're not exempt from problems so it's
[2:34:47] not about you know that look how God had
[2:34:49] to bring me along on that we're not
[2:34:51] exempt from problems but we have the
[2:34:53] answer we have the answer and that
[2:34:58] answer is the Lord Jesus Christ not a
[2:35:01] theory not a historical being but the
[2:35:04] very Living God that's the answer to the
[2:35:10] devil's question that's the answer right
[2:35:12] there God is so good to us what our what
[2:35:15] a wonderful word that the Lord brought
[2:35:17] to us this morning you love the Lord one
[2:35:20] that good this morning my I was broke
[2:35:23] down God has you know you think about
[2:35:25] for the young people here if your
[2:35:28] timeline just like my timeline
[2:35:30] you guys make timelines in school right
[2:35:32] I never liked making them
[2:35:35] I never seemed like I always got
[2:35:37] everything put up here at the beginning
[2:35:38] and I had this wide gap at the end and
[2:35:41] finally when I became a teacher I
[2:35:43] learned how to space those things out
[2:35:45] but you know all of those little points
[2:35:48] on a timeline their events and every one
[2:35:51] of those events there are things that
[2:35:54] they're happenings they were important
[2:35:56] points and God our timeline is already
[2:36:00] laid out your timelines laid
[2:36:02] every little point every little thing
[2:36:04] and you don't have to worry about what's
[2:36:06] gonna happen at this point once the main
[2:36:08] thing is is that your life is committed
[2:36:11] into his hands God sees to it that every
[2:36:14] Junction and every point you'll make it
[2:36:19] you'll make it you don't ever have if
[2:36:22] the Bible is so clear in the Book of
[2:36:24] Psalms 119 that they who are seeking
[2:36:27] after him can do no iniquity when we're
[2:36:31] seeking fully after God you can do no
[2:36:33] iniquity it's fully focusing on him God
[2:36:37] is just such a clarity within it and it
[2:36:39] doesn't something deep it's just simple
[2:36:41] they say Lord make yourself more real to
[2:36:45] me and as he speaks to you just keep
[2:36:48] yielding to him and you watch how that
[2:36:50] your Lord will move within your life it
[2:36:53] starts out like a little button
[2:36:55] but it grows too eventually he's seated
[2:36:58] on the throne you love a man my brother
[2:37:04] Jesse we appreciate that this morning
[2:37:16] it's just so wonderful well we have we
[2:37:20] have a dinner here that the right inside
[2:37:24] the restrooms on the bulletin board if
[2:37:27] you don't know the address it's there I

[2:37:52] that God has given us a time like this I
[2:37:55] want to say I just appreciate each of
[2:37:57] you for being here I know I know there's
[2:37:59] been a lot of sacrifice you know to be
[2:38:02] here and to come during this time but
[2:38:04] you know that's what it's all about
[2:38:07] that's what it's all about
[2:38:09] it's sacrifice isn't it the whole
[2:38:12] Christian walk is sacrifice and you know
[2:38:17] God were always rewards sacrifice when
[2:38:20] we do it for the right reasons God
[2:38:21] always rewards sacrifice amen

[2:39:33] voices want to try to guide them to lead
[2:39:37] them to even try to tell them things
[2:39:40] about themselves but there's only one
[2:39:43] voice that really holds the real mystery
[2:39:49] and understanding of our lives and Lord

[2:41:12] things or we could say apps for this or
[2:41:14] that Lord sometimes some of the most
[2:41:17] subtle ways that the enemy works in our
[2:41:20] life is to even get us Lord thinking in
[2:41:24] the wrong direction Lord your prophet
[2:41:27] told us even when we get to thinking on
[2:41:30] these certain things I've got to write
[2:41:32] this up he said the Holy Spirit takes
[2:41:36] its flight so help us lord help us Lord
[2:41:41] that in our lives and hearts God to ever
[2:41:45] remain covered by the blood let our
[2:41:48] hearts and our lives Lord Jesus may
