have brother Jos and sister Sharon here they were married there in in February and uh so it's been a a process but I would say this to you I know brother joshu would Echo these words them standing here together uh with what was spoken by the embassy and other things it's a miracle and I I would say it I would say it like this I I look at everything that's done that it's always a witness for you and I for no matter what need or situation is that we would have before us they were told there will not be anything till 2025 but I like how the scripture could say I like in the scripture puts the conjunction but God but God oh no my my my situation that's not the end but God Amen so we're just so thankful to the Lord that they're here with us and uh also coming up we'll have more details perhaps brother Shane you can gather some of those details for the email for um December 30th um a gathering that they're having uh and we certainly want to support that and so um I think also brother Brian he made some other announcements here today as well we're certainly not encouraging you to stay home uh so but uh I think there are things that we just we want to use uh we want to use wisdom and uh I was um I was preaching was preaching a meeting and uh you know it it didn't bother me if it's only two people there I that doesn't bother me and but the meeting you know there was more than two people and the brother I told him I said hey I said look who's supposed to be here they're here and the others are streaming you can see all of that I said look that that doesn't affect me one bit uh I believe if we can be in the house of God we want want to make do everything we can to be in the house of God that's right amen I I believe that's what we do as Believers uh but uh there were some things that um you know well anyway I don't want to say too much because of somebody streams of service but uh needless to say you know I was uh praying for individuals with Fe statement one time it's true it says uh uh Jesus and germs are kind of alike they're everywhere and so I you know we we we thank the Lord for that I know I know that uh glad to have brother Brian back here with us and uh I I I told him I told him back there this morning just kind of teasing with him I said I hope no more no more presents come back from Arkansas this time and uh so glad to have uh Brother Ray he was back here with us on Thursday and uh and different ones had battled sickness it's just good it's good to be together it's just good to see each one of you and when you're not here we miss you amen we miss you amen and so let's just look to the word of the Lord here in this morning I want to say thank you to the Musicians if you'd like to turn with me in your scriptures to Luke Chapter 2 amen we certainly just love you and uh certainly count and an honor to be here and my I tell you I I didn't get a touch on it on Thursday but my the message brother Ronnie ministered here last Sunday what a tremendous word and uh I you know I I want to believe in some ways but I uh with things that God gives us the grace and I do believe I I'm not I'm not interested in um chatter uh I'm not I'm not interested in um ideas about the message I I'm only interested in the message and uh I I look at that and I think you know that's the thing that we we want you would say well brother Samu isn't that all the same goal I think sometimes there's things that are the goal but it's one of those things is you know the picture itself it's never become more obscure but it becomes more plain there's things even as I read back over of quotes that I'll go back over certain things that maybe I've had down in a file from last year and I look back across I say my it's more plain now than it was last year and it just the picture it what it happens is is the picture itself never shifts away from Jesus Christ being the same right if it does then there's some peace in there that's not right so everything and that goes in our lives to everything he should always be the same if there's a peace we've put in our life that somehow it's taking away from him being the same in our lives that God I I don't need that peace in there I just want the peace that you want that you would remain the same in my life amen so I want to just read just a few verses of scripture in Luke Chapter 2 and uh just a a thought here that really just uh burning on my heart and then even from last weekend with some things that I was uh speaking on and just this was kind of in the background of my heart but in Luke chap 2 and beginning in verse 6 and the Bible says and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping water watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child amen May the may the Lord bless the word Les could we just have just a word of prayer here and I know we all we are gathered here we have needs we want to hear from him there's things that God has laid upon my heart but I the the thing that we need is I need the same inspiration that he would that he gave it and brought it to me that he would come and bring it to us today and that he would speak to every need he knows God's reserved he hasn't let me know everything but God has knows what our need is and he is mindful of that and we just want him just we want him to have his way that's that's my ultimate desire here Heavenly Father Lord as we we are so thankful Lord for the moment that we have together together and Lord we ask Lord that you would just come Lord once again Lord in a very special way come and anoint us Lord for service anoint us Lord that we might hear that we might see that we might Lord understand and that our lives God might be further change Lord in this moment Lord we pray Lord may you minister to every need now Lord we give ourselves Lord speaker and hearer to you Lord without any reservation oh God For Your Glory we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen may God bless you as you're being seated I want to I want to speak on a thought here uh in and that is becoming what we are beholding becoming what we are beholding amen you know it's very very crucial that what you whatever you look at uh it will affect the direction and course of your life you remember the young man when he was riding he got on and rode that bike and the promise was whoever can ride the bike down the plank will win the Schwin BL the bike and a lot of very experienced writers got on there men no doubt writers these were probably the guys going through the neighborhood that could ride without holding the handlebars I never was able to do that so well don't don't don't take me out now but I I just I wasn't able to do that maybe I was on Country gravel too much you know and but uh uh you know he got on there and very simple he rode to the end of the plank and the rest of them around said how what in the world did you do and he said there's one thing he said that I I noticed what all of you did did he says you got to looking at everything that was right here on the side he said and that's what that's why you went off he said but what I did was I just kept my eyes on the goal at the end and that that was a direction and this is why that with every and everything in every part of your journey with God as a Believer it is important and God with his grace comes to direct your focus and attention as he does mine upon the goal at the end lot of distractions can come around our life lot of things to try to pull our attention away but if we can keep our eyes on him then that's when he'll see us through whatever turbulent moment we're in whatever pressing time that you're in whatever in your life that you're going through maybe it's a besetting sin but keep your eyes on him because he'll give you the strength to move through all of that it was when Peter took his eyes off of the Lord Jesus and began to consider how he was walking and what was taking place in his life and when he got occupied on that beholding the wrong thing he begin to sink so it's important of what you behold we see that uh even in the world and the things that we live in even right now of becoming whatsoever that we behold remember it was Lot's wife she was they were instructed when you're called out of Sodom don't look back but she began to hear the cries it was loved ones that were crying and she turned and when she turned against the voice of the angel that said Don't Look Back she became a pillar of salt and this is why Jesus would simply just say in a phrase of scripture remember lot's wife cuz just within those three words is a lot of things to consider to reflect upon and to think about and so to realize that it's very important that also what we are beholding we want to become what we're beholding and I'm talking in terms of the word when I'm looking and just drawn here in this part of the scripture and I'm just to kind of lay behind uh the scenes I I'm thinking of us as Sons and Daughters of God it's important that we're becoming what we're beholding and that we're beholding the right thing and God would be sure to set the right thing before us uh I think many times that as a when I was teaching school you know you could uh somehow take for example you could say well you know the kids they've already wrote letters before when I was a fourth grade teacher well they've wrote letters when they were you know in first grade and second grade and third grade so I'll just tell them to write a letter they'll they'll know what they're doing you realize that the skills themselves aren't continually practice they'll continue they'll lose certain things and then there's certain things that maybe that within that year it's going to be added beyond what they had the previous year such as you know in first grade it's a great accomplishment for them to write uh a number of sentences uh but then when you start moving up into other grades it's now becomes the thought itself kind of deepens and you know it becomes into paragraph so there's a greater expectation and so I just want to say it like this there's a greater expectation in this hour for you and I and God himself has not left us to wonder as to what's expected but God when he makes a promise in his word he doesn't step back and say now you figure it out you try to find out you Tred to see uh determine when it's being fulfilled but we see the pattern once again right here that when this the promise that was made that Behold a virgin shall conceive a child would be born his name shall be called emman it would be an everlasting sign now God made that promise on Isaiah Mary and Joseph were fellowshipping about that promise brother brother Bram gives us that dramatization within that and no doubt these Shepherds they knew about that they no doubt knew the word but you see God in his grace comes by and makes known to them that this fulfillment of the word that's been promised it's being fulfilled right now amen and God makes it known to them as he comes to the Shepherds and I don't want to dwell so much on that this morning but he's coming to simple humble lives to make himself known amen you see God himself being omniscent he doesn't he's not going to waste his time God will broadcast the word but the word comes with an intended target in mind knowing there's there's Hearts because let me just tell you something it would be like you going to the store with your children and you know how it was even as you had your children when they were younger I think sometimes even mothers right now want to make sure that their 40-year-olds are tucked in bed you know I see you see you were out i' see you live 360 you need to be home and you know it's things that you want to uh uh check up on but if you went let me just say it like this so you understand if you went to the store with your children you just didn't walk out the door and look at your wife and say hey uh where where are the kids at no you make sure you went in there with them so you want to make sure they're coming out with you and God coming down to redeem you and I God came down here because we were always his children and he was coming to get us we've always been a part of him so to see that they were called from where they were and notice after the word itself was made known to them they themselves then turned after the great Jubilation and all of the everything that was spoken they themselves said let us go now even unto Bethlehem and see the thing which has come to pass which the Lord made known to us and the Bible say as we read they came and made haste and they saw the Babe lying in the manger and when they seen it they made it known a broads saying which was told them concerning this child now notice the word makes known this is a moment of fulfillment they in obedience to the word now it's going to become something that they must see and give witness to personally it's not going to be enough for them just to take the Angel's word are you hearing me now this is why we hear the message but the message must become something where you see it personally not just something where you take the Angel's word for it but it's something that you recognize this was for me and you walk according to the word to come and see because listen the messenger is a star in the hand of God and he sent there to point and to open the way that Satan has wanted to close off for you coming back in as a son and daughter of God and Satan wants to obscure that but God sends a word where it's a direct reflection of the light himself from the throne that you might walk into the full path as Sons and Daughters of God that's right so you say well shouldn't we take the Angel's word they did they acted upon it they did what he said if they had stayed in the field where they were they would have never saw what the word was saying was on Earth you see that's where it puts it on you and I we can hear we can hear the word and we can stay in the same place where we're at but listen no matter where you're at in your journey it's one thing as God is making his word known but he's letting you know go to the Fulfillment that he is proclaiming don't just stand in the field and say glory to God in the highest peace and Good Will has come but to go and behold what has been fulfilled and become that and I think this is where we look in the scripture here and you hear from this from the portion we read today where the Bible had said there was no room for him in the end that's quite quite a symbol that's placed out there of what it spoke within the lives and the hearts of men right of how it was even among the religious of that day there was no room for him I want you to listen how brother BR says this he says no wonder there was no room for him in the end it wasn't wrapped right it wasn't wrapped the classical paper around it you see uh and and and and forgive me for just a moment but it's just like you know you could have the most beautiful paper wrapped around a gift right the paper ends up in the trash it's the gift it's like the gift bags that are given you don't want it give it back to me I'll recycle and use it again come on all the rest of us Penny Pinchers in here but you see what I'm saying notice the Bible said there was no Beauty in this gift trap no beauty that we should desire you see God has chosen in such a way and so ordained it it was always his thought are you hearing me this was always his thought and God's thought being expressed now it has an effect on those when he comes that are a part of that thought and so when he reveals himself they could look and see they they could see here here's a man remember the Greeks they stum LED and they looked and said they want to see Jesus but all they saw was a man but the disciples saw the gift that was behind behind the flesh behind the paper yes sir is that right that's what's important is that in everything listen to me now in everything in your Christian walk my Christian walk I want to know where is Christ in this if there's anything presented as a gift if it even is a gift of something this is to further your natural life it'll help you I want to know where is Christ in this amen well brother Samuel how can I know that listen you're a Believer the Bible says that we are to exercise our senses to be able to discern good and evil and we do that by eating the meat of the Worden when you're not eating and feasting on the word your discernment goes down your discernment it becomes now your reasoning abilities your feelings about things well I think feeling it's all right I feel it's okay I you know I think God understands that you see what happens you now begin to move into a realm that you're not called to live in you're out of your domain as a son and daughter of God when you're not living from the soul realm amen amen Satan's desire is to pull you into the spirit realm pull you into the flesh realm that's what the maniac there in Oregon wanted to to do when he came up the stage it wasn't the man so much it was the Satan himself knew if he could get the prophet out of that Realm of the soul and get him in his Spirit realm he had him whipped the very moment we go to our reasonings we're whipped that's why the Bible said lean not to your own understanding Hallelujah beloved believe not every Spirit but try everyone notice it say it didn't say believe not every wrapping believe not every flesh Veil no it said try the spirit what is behind the rapping where will this take me will it lead me closer to God or further of God but you see that's according to your objective my objective what's our desire I believe your desire it would correspond with what's in my heart I want to be closer to God I want to to be more like God absolutely amen I I want I want to be more like him I want listen Enoch got so close to God until God took him he didn't get further he got closer notice it was wrapped as a gift as a gift from God sent from God a God that they didn't know nothing about they claimed they did and they claimed they was looking for him but he did not come in the way that they thought he was coming according to their Creeds they could not receive God's Gift he was wrapped different he was wrapped up like a baby he was born in a manger he come from poor people come from a bunch of Fanatics so how could they receive something like that no wonder there was no room for him in the end I want to just announce right here and I would try to say it you you're just a privilege to be I think what was it brother John Sanger said you're just privileged to hear me preach on myself there's more room for him there's more I I don't have enough I want more I want more I want him to have more in my life is that right sometimes in order to have more you you know Brothers you know how it is if you're going to have more pictures on the wall you got to get rid of some of the rest of them there's only so much room in the basement right there's only so much room in the garage before you star renting storage units eventually got to just start getting rid of it and and and that's the same thing in our Liv it's things sometimes that God's asking us to get rid of and you know what he's actually calling us to to trust him more it really isn't so much about the thing he's dealing with our life about it isn't necessarily the what he's dealing with our life about that it's sin he's just simply saying and you're there's no room for me to further grow and spread out in your life but Lord I must have this I must do this I must do that God brings us to a place of trusting him completely that's what Genesis 22 was Abraham Abraham you would have never saw that out of Abraham in Genesis 12 you didn't you never saw it in Genesis 13 never saw it in 14 15 16 17 18 19 you didn't see that to Genesis 22 so you know what that tells me that we grow hallelujah it's growing to a place this is coming to a place of complete trust to where Lord I trust your word above my own reasonings say is all listen Saint's tactic is always to bring us into our reasonings on things to dwell and to shift for ourself within that way and I just want to say within that where it says there's no room for him there's a lot of even among we realize listen in this hour he's knocking he was knocking at the door he was put out of the church now you would look and say well they have the Bible yeah whatever version they've got now even if they have King James version but they put him out because you can have all of the letter and if you don't have him who is the author the dynamic to the mechanics you missed what it's all about that's right it's about him he's the only one that can make the word live he's the only one that can make it work in our lives right yes sir so it's him I I don't need more education I don't need more knowledge I don't need to know this and know that what I need I need him I need to know him oh I want to know him more and how do we know him more by beholding what he himself is making known to you and I and becoming what we're beholding that's now that's the challenge that's the challenge that we face that's the battle that's where Satan battles is becoming and that part of becoming the in between from what we're beholding no room for him they you know they don't want they don't they don't want they they want things their way let me just say what it boils down to within this you'll hear Brother brand say this over and over in the message and I think it's very true because Satan's desire is to corrupt the Mind from the Simplicity of the Gospel they were looking for what they looked at was we need a great military man to come down and to lead us out and he'll you know destroy all this and destroy all that what God what they needed God gave them what they needed was a baby say a baby they needed a birth they didn't need more training they didn't need a more of an intellectual man they needed a birth let me just say this friends you cannot bypass the new birth and ever get anywhere with god well I'll go to this conference or I'll go to this or I'll go to that let me just tell you something self-help and all those other things I'm just going to tell you personally from my heart there is nothing that can that can do what the new birth can do you say brother Samuel how can you say that I'm a witness I'm a witness of what the new birth does in a life I believe there's other Witnesses here but you see how Satan wants to sow if we not careful he wants to sow creeping in right even among us as though now something is substituted when in God's intended purpose is that Christ would dwell supremely in our lives even more amen watch how brother Ram says this he says and further in that quote in paragraph 64 he says he was wrapped then in a dirty cloth a swaddling cloth brother John zanger made mention of that when he was here and what they put around the ox's neck and he's wrapped today in the same thing they call Holy Roller fanaticism a bunch of Heretics it's wrapped up in swaddling cloth and the world don't want it right oh I'm so glad to raise that cloth off listen let me tell you something friends let me just bring this this quote right here not bring it up to date but let me just tell you the world still don't want it there's even around our ranks that don't want it they wanted to formalize the working of the Holy Spirit and control it you don't control God glory god is made to flow through you and I amen prise the Lord oh my I I I I want I want all of him amen I want all of him much as he says oh I'm so glad to raise that cloth off look notice I'm glad to raise that cloth off that to me that statement that's made right there it is not just a statement in passing of what the scripture we've read but in this very hour it is Christ himself that has taken the Veil off of the word God has taken the veil off of what man has has looked at in confusion but God himself has taken the cloth he has opened the seals and who is those seals he is those seals that's why the prophet could say over and over he says when he opened those six seals notice he the seven seal open the six seals it's him it's him that has come right here Among Us it's him that's taken the cover off the word where the where the church has said well you just agree with this and you just sign our book or you just ascribe to this or even how the spirit wants to work around our message well you just believe brother randam is a prophet and you just believe that the doctrines are the truth and you just subscribe to this no but to take the cloth off and to see what it really is it's [Music] Christ it's Christ and when I say that it's Christ in you amen look he says look what's laying underneath it eternal life God made flesh and dwelt among us remember let me just give just a few bounce on a few examples Phillip went to Nathaniel and told him we found him right we found him we found him whom Moses and the prophets spoke of we found him and then he proceeds to tell Nathaniel of where he is Jesus of Nazareth and what's Nathaniel's response Nazareth what good can come out of that swaddling cloth what good can come out of that life let me just say this to you listen I know from my own life where others that I where I grew up in the city I grew up in those that were around that knew me what happened to that guy or even individuals you know that after they start hearing certain things how teachers could look at you and things like that and he listen I was in I was in need of help I needed help from a living God I needed to meet that God personally are you hearing me but look at they can look at your life look at my life what can come out of that life it's not what you're seeing but what's beneath there it's not the darkness that's around it but a sea that's beneath it it's what's beneath that it's the character that God SED in there that's what he's working to bring forth are you hearing me God's not trying to bring you and I to a place to where that we conf formed to the word that's not what it is he's leading you and I out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light and the light shineth brighter and brighter and brighter until that perfect day it's God himself leading his children above the muck that we were buried in Above This Pond of Life above all the dirt that was packed into US above all the grab bag of life it's the quickening power of God that's leading us they said to him the one of the greatest things come and see come and see come and behold what I'm saying has been fulfilled and when he got there the word itself identified him behold an Israelite in whom there is no gu amen huh Rabbi when did you know me I saw thee before before Philip ever called you I saw you before what before are we talking about where were you [Applause] before before the foundation of the world when the angel sang and The Morning Star shouted for Joy where were you before Hallelujah I saw you before H you hear what I'm saying so no matter what sin or what unbelief or what has ever tried to hedge in a seed of God it will not work it cannot overcome the word of God it cannot overthrow the purpose of almighty God every son and daughter of God comes to a personal Resurrection amen I tell you let me just say this to you these are not just words but it's things that the Holy Spirit called into our hearts that we would behold and become what we're beholding and he says you believe this he says you're going to see greater than this what would be greater well more of the same sure more greater meaning more but greater than this you'll see something greater than this what could be greater than seeing the Messiah than seeing God in Christ what would be greater is seeing God in you seeing God in your own life that's the working of redemption God does not want you talking about somebody else's testimony Daddy's testimony mommy's testimony the prophet's testimony you're to have your own [Applause] testimony become what we're beholding the woman at the well H she came and there at the well she began to behold and when she was beholding she became what she was beholding she left her water pots everything let me just preach for a moment everything that she had come to rely on in life that some how was an appeasement she knew the word but something that she could rely on no doubt she had she was very beautiful she could rely on that she could rely on her charm she could rely on going to that well but you see God wanted to bring her to a complete Reliance upon the word because all that other ground is Shaky Ground right right she was with the one man ah that didn't work out then the next and the she he wanted to bring her to s Solid Ground to stability in her life so here he begins to talk to her what is she doing she's beholding but after beholding she becomes what she's beholding now we never read anymore about we don't even know her name we don't never read anymore about this but we do know one thing for sure she had to be one that received an upper room experience like the rest of them did but she had and walked by the experience that God was giving her at that moment that was an experience of redemption that this word is for you it's not by an accident that you are hearing this word and the word is dealing with your life the word is touching things in your life in your heart and going down through and calling you out it's not an accident it's not by chance it's by Design now the Bible says in John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he he shall not speak of himself now but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so I want to say when we look here in this scripture that's a very uh uh uh loaded scripture because when he is come he leads and guides us into all truth it it never stops he continues to lead us on and the truth itself is the person of Jesus Christ I want you to think he stood in the midst of pilate's court and proclaimed that the purpose he was sent was to Bear witness to the truth what truth what truth was he to Bear witness too the truth that was lost but I I thought the prophets had the truth the truth would move through them but the truth that was going to be restored was the truth like they had it in Eden where God's image was veiled in their lives Hallelujah he came to restore that truth right Hallelujah not a truth because the prophets notice the spirit of Truth would move upon them then it would lift off then it would move upon them then it would lift off because remember that was the difference with the coming in Redemption on whom you see the spirit descending and remaining the same is he so the identification is the abiding of the spirit of the Living God that leads and guides in all of the truth amen amen so he come to Bear witness of the truth remember God has not left it up to you and I to figure our way out God makes himself known to you and I personally the little Eagle that was in the barnyard the prophet picks this up and rising of the sun he said he did not need a picture of an eagle right right but what had the effect is when he saw a being like he was and he didn't have a mirror are you hearing me he didn't have a mirror that he could walk by and say I look different than them but he could look only in a shortened way my feet are different than their feet my wings are different than them my feathers these said he could see differences but he wasn't able to identify his kind and by beholding the chickens all he did was try to act like a chicken that's all he knew to do but when one came that was of his kind and Mama eagle flew over he could look up and see that is a being that's a living being he couldn't explain it he couldn't figure it all out but something was just taking hold on his life that all the rest of the thoughts and the clucks of oh you'll never be able to do that you got to watch out for them they're the kind that eat us you got to watch out they'll swallow up everything I mean they they'll do away with our Creeds they'll do away with all these Isom they'll do it but there was something that was taking hold on him that was greater than any power of human reasoning or intellect it was the power of almighty God that was coming down through the Chanel of the word being fulf filled and when Mama eagle flew over his head was up Hall she said jump son jump he jumped hallu oh he jumped on the fence post I don't know jumping up on the fence post might have took a Month of Sundays but finally he that courage came on in there then he got up on that fence post but then after the fence post here mama Eagle said just flap your wings you're built for this you see he had a living reality that he could look at and that's what God comes to show you and I is a living reality making himself known to you and I through every facet of our life Acts chapter 1 and verse 8 Jesus said to the disciples you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth now you can put your name in there and not just in your community but through every aspect of life to be a witness that he has come amen that we are living in the last days that it is a fact it's a reality that God and Christ are one amen you're a witness that God still gives the Holy Ghost amen you're a witness that there is genuine Christians you're a witness that the gospel is still in effect you're a witness that the apostolic age AG is still in session and when he had spoken these things while they behal now I want you to notice while they behadd he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven then they returned unto Jerusalem from the mount called ol of it which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey now I want you to think just for a moment the direction of where they headed after things had not worked out like they thought it would work out they were going away from where they needed to be right what was taking them away discouragement brother bramy uses another word bewildered we thought that's what they said we thought and it wasn't that their thinking as far as him being a redeemer it's they didn't understand the thought of redemption but you see God comes think for 40 days he comes and he gathers them they don't know where he's going to appear there they are out fishing right there they are here right and here he shows up you know all of that was also training that was also training for them to let them see and to know that God is interested and he occupies himself with every part of our life even when they needed fish he supplied what they needed and to be put them brother BR said put them in a place to where you never know what corner you turn and you're going to see him standing there always to be aware he's right here with us he's near but there had to have been something that was there at this event that was taking place and how that they had witnessed this event and man 40 days walking with him but to think how these the Angels the Bible said two men that stood by them dressed in white apparel they these angels must have captured think about it what they are seeing they have witnessed he who said I'm going to go away for a little while and your sorrow but you'll see me again then he lets them know and again I say I'm going to go away but you'll see me again he was letting him know the first time will be the crucifixion and then the resurrection and then the next time you'll see me going but I will come again but I will come in you because your sorrow will be turned to Joy that's what the spirit of Truth was leading them into to behold it was to behold the promise that was for their lives to Behold The Working of the holy spirit in their lives evidently these these these uh these uh these angels are standing there they must have you know must have said Hey Hey cuz as they said by the scriptures look you're gazing you're beholding too long and not moving to the place of becoming I believe it's important that we look upon the right things I don't believe that we need that we are to rush about things I believe that when we look at things and say God let it so move into my life because listen so many times that's where even things have gotten to even in life theyve looked they thought they knew what it was and they took off and yet they didn't they missed what it was really all about we think the message was just another great Revival and they missed it and failed to recognize that what the message was all about was the original message of Christ in you then you must be born again that Christ becomes preeminent through your life not just become born again and set around as though I made it already but now it's Christ Living and operating and breathing and moving through every facet of our life had to been where they were they kept on looking and if Satan can get you to look at the wrong thing or look even at the right thing but in the wrong way he's got you remember John when he was given a tour in the Book of Revelations the prophet of God gave John a tour because when John fell down to worship Him He said stand up on your feet see thou doest it not I am of thy fellow servants the prophets what was he saying what you're beholding but you're not looking at it in the right way it's not to worship me but to see that this God who is the person of Truth the spirit of Truth is leading you to the real truth in your life that you are a son of God you are a daughter of God let me tell you your first birth my first birth is the lie you hear me the first birth is the lie it's a product of the lie that was told in the the Garden of Eden but the second birth is the product of the truth it is the truth himself coming forth that you are a son and daughter of God that's what happened to the woman at the well it was the truth beneath the darkness coming forth it was the truth in the prodical son it was the truth in Peter the truth in Paul so that's a key want to be moving to a place of becoming you know not just come and look at it man that's wonderful tremendous wow glory to God in the highest and then we back here again oh glory to God in the highest praise the Lord what are you saying brother the Sam becoming what we are beholding you know what that means is you can even come here in the church and you've got to press beyond what you're even seeing and what you're hearing right cuz you can see and hear just a man you can have and sense a feeling and a sense the anointing of the Holy Spirit you got to go beyond that you got to move beyond that you got to remember he's here to lead you to direct you it's one of those things that God take the man of God and help me to see the areas in my life where I need to grow Lord in you oh my let me move on here quick so he would let them know even as he did at the tomb remember think about it in the grace of God if he had not come the Angels where they were even as he appeared to Mary Magdalene they were looking in the Tomb if he hadn't come if the Angels had not announced they'd have still been there looking at the tomb right they would have charged admission to it it would have become just a sight but it wasn't to be a sight it wasn't to be I mean I I'm thankful that there's places that we can visit but it's something deeper than that memorials are all about to let you know and remind you what he was yesterday he is still the same today that's what memorials are all about memorials are not gravestones that God don't move no more like that that's not a memorial of God that is a supplier of man Hallelujah but the memorials of God are witnesses what God did before he's still God today and he had they had to tell him he's not there he's risen a change had come a fulfillment of scripture had taken place an announcement that would begin to gather the scattered sheep together for the purpose and to serve his purpose so in other words the seeing was changed to beholding him in the Fulfillment of his word now had changed from the example to behold now the entrance and the summons into the same image to become a partaker of his life a joint Heir a beneficiary why didn't he repair to aapas why didn't he go back to them and say see what I told you you didn't believe me it wasn't for them they weren't believers they didn't believe then they wouldn't believe now right even what Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler they got the they got the prophets in the Psalms right right you see here when he comes back now is to behold this is the entrance that's why as we're beholding Christ it's behold holding that entrance into all things beholding him the who has all wisdom has all things for our life this is why even when the prophet would say it like this remember regarding the hidden Mana when it was given as Junior Jackson gave that dream about that crowbar being taken in the top of that mountain coming off notice not the bottom the top we're at the summit it's Capstone time Hallelujah and underneath that Capstone notice it was in the hand a crowbar to go in there and what did he instruct what did he instruct to be done Brethren look on these things look on these things not go out and see what so and so said on this website we're not in the days of presuming no more we're in the days when the perfect interpretation has come Hallelujah we're in the days when the absolute of God's stop has broke the silence around our life has broken amen it's God's thoughts being carried out it's God's thoughts we're being moved by and notice even as the prophet said then there were those even at that time and I certainly think there's always a time in a season and we understand that but there were those who who who who began to follow and go after brother Bram where he was going and what they failed to recognize is here was the angel making the announcement he's on earth now the Fulfillment of the word is hereall your deliverance has come Christ is here dwelling right Among Us right we love his appearing we love his appearing here he is and to behold and now to become what we're beholding I want to just let me just let me just move through this these parts here and God's wrapped gift I think paragraph 156 Brianna he says it like this he says God's Gift package wrapped up in the form today of the Holy Ghost it was wrapped up then and called the Son of God God's Gift package was just taken up and rewrapped again in and sent back it was wrapped up in the Son of God then it's wrapped up in sons of God today called The Church taken up rewrapped so it's the same gift not a different gift it never called you and I to be Overcomers and then give us something different he said be of good cheer for our I have overcome the world and the prophet takes that verse of scripture in John 16:33 he said what Jesus was saying there is I took the holy ghost in my body and I overcame by it and so shall you because what was it it was the Holy Spirit quickening the word and it was the word living out it was the truth living out oh my and now let me just trying to move here just just in these things here let me say it like this will only live as deep as what you're beholding right that's good in other words you're only challenged to what you're beholding and giving yourself too you see you can be beh hold it we can behold it and go away remember the Bible J James speaks of this we don't want to be hearers of the word and but notice what it says deceiving our own selves how could that be how could being a hearer be a deceiver of our own selves how can that be we're beholding something and our understanding of what we think and we're walking by understanding instead of by Divine expression oh I understand this now or I understand the godhead or I understand serpent SE or I oh yeah here is we talking about the New Birth again what that's the greatest event to ever take place in your life of the new birth and it's on the new birth that there is a growth to take place in our life let me tell you none one of us nobody's going anywhere without every child of God coming into that place of a real genuine birth and God also wants to break any imagination that would be around our lives of thinking we have something when we don't have it Hallelujah understand me that the Holy Spirit itself when we're looking at it it's deeper than just a good clean moral life that's wonderful but the prophet said that's why this is the most deceptive age he said because people can live good morality above drinking above smoking above all those other things but not having the personal life of Jesus Christ and you would say well what would be the personal life of Jesus Christ well what did the life of Jesus Christ do in the body called Jesus I only do those things which please the father that's right I must be about my father's business I have not come to this earth to do my own will but the will of him that sent me that's he was more connected and aware of the other realm than he was in this realm he walked in this realm that's true but he lived by the other realm that's what the Holy Spirit does to you as a Believer that's why when John saw the holy city coming down he saw it coming down as a bride prepared what was he saying that now the coming of the Holy Spirit it lives out in the delegates of that City Hallelujah here amen in this Earth as it will be there Samuel that's challeng it should there should be a challenging to live deeper we want to become what we're beholding this message was not just meant to be something that we gather around and hold hands and dance around it like dancing around the fire and glory to God God sent a message but behold what he has sent behold I want all that God has for my life there's more that I don't want things to crowd him out I want want to make more room for him I don't want to be one to say I got enough Jesus it's kind of like you know when they come around the restaurant you just no no more no more not enough I don't want no more no no I want more I want more am if my cup overflows overflow it Hallelujah overflow it Lord that's overwhelm me because I I'm not the one that brings the word to pass but oh let me just give myself to you Lord that the word will come to pass in my life notice this this in Acts 19 if I can just refer to these couple places because I want to get to one one last Point here was in Acts 19 here the Paul when the Bible says Paul had passed through uh EP Ephesus now remember Ephesus ends up being one of the real uh group of Believers that were very very matured with things he didn't have to talk to them about gifts I had to talk to him on how to act his husbands and wives right had to work with them on domestic things of life God knows how to adoption of sons God said adoption of sons act like an adopted son at home woo my see that's that's God speaking to you and I helps us to act and move within that realm where we need to be God help us here where they were have you receiv received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we've not beheld that we've not beheld that well what do you mean well I you know we can only live as high as what we're hearing we we haven't heard that but they were living all that they had heard you see one thing they were doing what they had beheld they had been giving themselves to it because when it came time for another step they were ready to make that next step is that right that's the same thing God works within our life to where we become what we're beholding now Paul makes known to them hey Jesus indeed is the Christ but I want you to understand what God has done in Christ that has been offered up the sacrifice and the Holy Ghost has come so it was no longer just beholding him out here just beholding and fellowship and talking about all the all the things you know of Jesus is the Christ and this quote goes with this quote and this scripture goes with this scripture and this one goes here and I can prove this here no let's see what's beneath it hallelujah amen let's see what's beneath it God doesn't need a group of collective Minds getting together to Hash things out that's why the Holy Ghost has come God has given the Holy Ghost goes to his church so it's not one man leading another man by another man's idea and then it just becomes instead of the birth of Christ it becomes another that person come on we've had that enough already we do not want to we do not want to give birth to personalities the only person that we want to see glorified and raised in our midst in our lives is Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Simplicity of it to think of how they were beholding now what they beheld they become but Paul had to take them back to that original sign that's why the brother Bram could make this statement Bri I don't know if I have this here A super sign in 1959 paragraph 111 do I have that there do I have it or not super sign okay I don't I want you to listen to this statement here listen the message is revived again in the last days the message of who he is and what he is you catch what he's saying so the message is not something new the message is revived again it's the original message That's what Satan has worked to corrupt what is the original message Christ in you that's right that's the original message but how did God revive it look others have the Bible have the Bible just like you and I do smart men very in intelligent men men that know the words and the breakdowns and all those other things but the message is revived again and God revealed it he took a vessel and revealed this message through a vessel that didn't even have a seventh grade education what was being revealed Christ what was being made known that this is God's objective in our life that's that was what it's all about great smart men that had studied even when brother Bram looking at uh here he is in his robed in a white wig calls up Jack Mo a great Theologian and Jack said well you know that that there his age you know he's matured and brother Bram said something did not ring right it didn't ring right why because that itself was a thought of man but God's thought was he is the finality he is the amen he is the same yesterday today and forever he is Alpha and Omega it him is complete and supreme authority it's Emmanuel dwelling in you with the same works that he did manifesting himself through you the very same things that he did it's the evening light yet it's evil spoken of and it's a hard way brother Bram says it like this go to Broken sister 195 uh 65 brother Ram's talking about the word in you he says nothing can take its place it is God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in Hebrews 138 said he is the same yesterday today and forever how can we rub that away from that it's got to be the truth he Remains the Same he is the same in every principle listen that's the reason you enjoy it you Baptist Methodist Catholic and Presbyterians you enjoy that presence somewhere in you you've accepted God maybe sometime in an intellectual way maybe maybe you have felt the power of God and you're a servant of God but when you can really come into God and recognize your place in him as a son or daughter of God that's what brings that great thrill to you that God intended you to have amen you see what he's saying here in this quote it's deeper it's deeper than just enjoying his presence Lord it's deeper and he's letting the people know listen and I'm not we're not taking that away he's bringing it down to this place here you enjoy that but God what what you are what you are beholding he says notice it's to become something greater than just any intellectual way of feeling God's power and maybe you're a servant of God but when you can really come into God to where you recognize your place in him as a son and daughter of God that's what brings that great thrill to you that's the joy that's the subtleness that's the satisfaction that's the foundation that's the foundation place where God lays that foundation in your life that's the real thrill when you recognize I'm a son and daughter of God so now what you have beheld you have become now let me just let me just shift this here just a moment so that becoming more like him because I have to cover the breath of everything that's here becoming more like him it's letting God go deeper in your life no matter where you're at in your journey right remember God you can let God in as your savior that's the only further he'll go if you don't open up other doors so good brother Bram takes this he says you have to go from the door of Pride he says then he says here he says from That Door of Faith he said then he said here you find that Pride so he keeps on going from door to door what is it Avenues areas in our life that God is working God is moving God is taking over it's becoming more and more like him we sometimes I think that when brother Bram talks about how the spirit in this last days he said I think he said that it has been so underestimated of this Spirit the pre he calls it the pressure of this age of of of soft Easy Living that everything has to be so easy easy So Soft just hand it to me God just give it to me just give it to me but you see it comes down to remember when things didn't happen the way they thought it should happen they went away and went fishing again they were bewildered but he came and gathered them how did he gather them by the Fulfillment of the word not according according to their thoughts about things so many times the things that is so lacked and I'm not I'm not putting anything on on a person down but I want you to understand faith is the very thing that governs and I say oh God let your spirit come and energize Faith In Hearts let it energize faith in life to where you realize God has never thrown in the towel on you God has never said that's it I've dealt with you service after service I've dealt with you here I've dealt with you here I put roadblock here road block that's not God that's how we respond sometimes had responded okay is when we come to a place where it didn't happen this way but listen remember the thing we want is the truth the truth and the truth comes to make us free from what the [Applause] lie and it comes in such Simplicity a small package now I'm coming down here I want to just leave these last few words when looking upon this here as Paul said we have been born we have born the Earthly image this is just from my heart now let us bear the Heavenly image and the true image of God is to receive his life and be transformed to become a new creation in Christ Jesus where all things have become new and the old things are pass passed away and Paul would go on to say that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable to his death Paul would go on to say that we are being changed from Glory unto Glory even by the spirit of the Lord as we are beholding his face in an open glass to become what we are beholding Hallelujah to look into the perfect law of Liberty satan is all about to try to distract our vision away from the purpose but what's been uncovered in this hour what's been taken off in this hour what a privilege we have to be able to look in and see eternal life to be able to look and to see Christ in your life to be able to recognize I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God he would go on to say that we're not to count ourselves as perfect in other words complete but rather to press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus and that we are beholding and seeking to apprehend which we've been apprehended of in other words what I'm beholding I want it to become what God is saying I want it to become in my life I don't want to just behold it I want to become what I'm beholding we want to be doers of the word of God as we're beholding ourselves in the mirror of God's word and submitting ourselves to the perfect law of Liberty the working of the Divine love of God to bring to pass every promise in our lives from that of the new birth to all things to the very changing of the atoms of our bodies now as a school teacher and you would know his parents sister Nita would know Mr Maria working in school brother the Rocka would know as he worked in the school you know the some of the things that can burden sometimes that burden me people when we had kids and you have to you're training you're wanting you you things groundwork you're laying in for what's coming down the road and people are not uh children are not you know parents aren't they're keeping them out of school they're keeping away from this and oh they got this and sometimes you get to begin to know hey these these excuses I mean this it's it's beyond what I what I'm talking about I'm not just honing in right now on Church attendance I'm honing in on that there wasn't something present present to really give themselves to glean from what was going on and you talk about trying to play catch up with things trying to catch up here and catch up there and catch up there and catch up here I'm looking at I'm looking at these things of how that in our lives and in our walk with God Lord I help me to be so shut in with you where the distractions and things of this life things like even what brother John Sanger brought out right here on traps beautiful in bringing that out but it was more than a beautiful sermon it's why it was something to look in our life and say God what about my life where in my life where where are things within my life brother Simon you're telling me to put myself so I'm not telling you to put yourself anywhere but I'm just saying friends that when we look at the word of God we want to become what we're beholding in other words if we're still standing in the same place that we were before we're not becoming what we're beholding and if what you're hearing it seems like well this is just right where this at I I I I want to hear more but listen you've got to become what you're beholding and the only way you can become what you're beholding you've got to be sincere in your approach to it you've got to be very serious with oh brother Samuel that's just fanaticism that's what they thought that's what they thought it's not fanaticism he we owe him our whole life everything and all that we are can I read you a quote here this is kind of a Quantum Leap in the message statue of a perfect man but I think it' be very fitting I I'm not going to read the scriptures I would love to perhaps we'll come back to it as time but you know as when brother BR preaches out out of second Peter 1 verse 1- verse 13 you can read it later on but I want you to watch how brother Braham himself comes to the end of a statue of a perfect man and he says I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray that I'll seek daily with without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old stature of mine till I can be a manifestation of the living Christ am see adding two is not I've got this now I put this now I put this this is where some of the teaching and some of the groups have got off to people keep falling off falling off on you come under under the word for your day but the foundation is Faith the foundation is the new birth am is that right and this is where brother bradam himself I'm not going to stop here was one who knew the new birth he said I'm not going to stop seeking daily until I can see the manifestation of the living Christ here he says for he became sin like me that I might become the righteousness of God he took my place Lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for look at this how many will pledge that same thing by the grace of God I say this morning how many will pledge that Lord hallelujah and I I wanted to keep adding adding adding I think brother Jerry years ago I I love that because we you know we've seen that all the time the prayer of JZ but I love how how the Lord LED brother Jerry to bring that out here and brother Jerry he he read that scripture and he he come to that part in the in the service my it just turned my world upside down he said how has japz prayed Lord enlarge my borders and the Holy Spirit came down through brother Jer and said Lord enlarge my character enlarge everything enlarge that Christ in my life Lord let it grow Lord God let it grow let Christ become magnified in my life let him grow more Lord the power of his resurrection and the fellowship the left hand The Fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death I want to grow Lord I want to become what I'm beholding and I want I want to be locked in I Lord give me Grace help me Lord where distractions are all around we're in an hour We're All Around we're distractions but help me to stay focused upon you Lord Amen brother brandham says I pledge it Lord this church pledges it the full stature of Jesus Christ there's more room for him amen there's more room for him and remember the reason they wouldn't they didn't give him room is because he didn't have any room in their ideas remember that's what the prophet is bringing us to place that too so where does making room for him begin in our thoughts starts right there God told Joshua chapter 1 meditate on these things right day and night then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and of a good success it begins with his thoughts what does that mean that means there's more of God for me there's more there's more I want to become what I'm beholding Hallelujah I want to take the word that I'm hearing here this is a very simple application but it's very very true I want to take the word that I'm hearing and I want to pray over it I I rejoice in the word I rejoice in his presence that I I I rejoice in his presence but the word that's coming I take it and to pray over it Lord I want to see more of you in me if the prophet of God could stand here and make that statement until I see the manifestation of the living Christ in me you would think why would he be requesting for something that's already taking place because there's more room there's more [Applause] room there's more room it will require more emptying out it'll require digging out some areas but God will give us the grace amen and Leadership that we need and some of that digging out is through prayer it isn't anything that we can talk out or Reason out it's through giving ourselves to the word of of God and in prayer as you give yourself to the word it isin't about what you feel I don't I don't feel anything's happening that's not a thought that comes from God remember as the word itself is coming forth it affects your life as you take it and take it into your life Lord let my life let my life absorb that word let my life assimilate to that word like we looked at on Thursday night let it just take it in Lord just taking him in and becoming what we're beholding Hallelujah to where we're no longer in the same place where we were but we're closer to him closer to him because like I said with those kids that sometimes would come to me and sister Nita different ones who witnessed this too sometimes you realize they had been out of school so much or been here been there and so many different things you had to catch up on previous skills and bring them up they had it in other words friends what this is the point I'm trying to make they didn't maintain where they were at they actually went backwards if you're not going forward you're going backwards you you you can't stay neutral you either move on with God or you're going backwards how can I be going backwards because if you don't walk in the light as he's in the light the light passes on that's why it's very important to how God peeling back and open opening the word and we look into it and see him Lord in my in every aspect of my life God's wanting to do more and in their thoughts they had limited him in his expression I want to make room for him I is continually continually to be changed until that final moment when the very atoms of this body have been changed until that time we press on until that moment we keep moving forward because it's the prize that's set before us to become what we're beholding God sets the example he sets everything a victory before us we don't come into a service I I I listen I I believe this message is not a I don't believe the message of the hour is a message of condemnation it's a message of Liberty it's a message of Grace it's a message that comes to minister courage ability and strength and love to you to let you know who you are amen and to let you know what belongs to you let you know what rights you have that you can look at that and exercise your rights it's a right for you to have the Holy Ghost it's right for you to be healed it's right for you to be delivered it is right it's part of your rights God continued to move through our lives say God help us amen help me to behold the right thing help me God stay focused amen and I want to become what I'm beholding I want to become that Lord I want to become that you love him amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer musicans if You' come oh my amen and amen thank you Lord oh thank you Jesus I want you to think just even from the depths of your heart your life maybe that's not a place that maybe you've you've come to yet with God but you realize God's leading you to to that place of his life to have the preeminence in you maybe you've enjoyed his presence and that's wonderful that's wonderful remember you've got to behold the right thing in Acts 19 he had to take them back and point them show them the right thing the prophet said they had to recognize that sign first before they could receive the Holy Ghost to know what it's all about I I want you to know right here this morning I'm not asking you to look for an emotion no no I'm asking you as the prophet simply said it in the message invisible Union he said look for a truth from the depths of your heart where everything is laid and surrendered before him as every head is bowed every ey is closed I ask you not to be looking around but just as you're coming and you're looking here and you're seeing then you say Lord that's what I want in my life that's the walk that I want Lord in you I want that life amen praise the Lord maybe there's things that here cuz we God has spoke to us on so many different levels here this morning God's not just spoke to us about being born again and then that's that's it no it's it's it's to all of us becoming what we're [Music] beholding but I would ask you would you would you be willing to allow God to move into the very thoughts of your [Music] life and let him just travel down every area he'll be right there he he doesn't Force you there he'll lead you he'll be right with you but to say Lord like you would do in your heart home when you get together and you say we got to sort through this stuff we got to figure out what needs to go would you just say Lord I there's things that Lord I know that can crowd out in my life your Prophet said there's a lot of things that can try to take it out of us he said your boss can you can let your boss take it out of you you can let different things try to take these things out of you what God is wanting to bring to pass in your life and Satan knows just EX exactly so meticulously how to plant different things along the way to get your focus away from what God is calling you to but I believe with every one of us in our walk this is a personal walk that there's a deeper walk for every one of us and I'm wondering how many like the prophet had said coming to that place of a pledge that Lord I'm not going to stop when I Seek You daily without ceasing until I see all of these great virtues flowing even in a a greater way I I'm not coming to a place well I've got all the virtue I need I've got all the patience I need no no there's more there's more adversities and circumstances of Life lead us to a place of more surrender I wonder how many would say Lord help me I want to make room for you beginning right with my thoughts my ideas my ideas have have limited you in a certain way but I don't want my ideas cuz your thoughts are so much higher than mine I don't want to limit you Lord I want to take the limiters off amen God bless you Hallelujah that's that's my prayer Lord that's my pledge [Music] L I want to go deeper I want to become more what I'm beholding Hallelujah because as we walk in the light more light will be shown to us amen God bless you this morning can we pray together Hallelujah Heavenly Father L Lord as here we are gathered in your presence [Music] Lord Lord we so appreciate being able to see one another as we said in the beginning parts of the service it's it's just wonderful Lord It's refreshing to see different ones Lord all of us Lord even there's some now that are not with us Lord sickness and other things taking place but God how wonderful it is to just be together as brothers and sisters and Lord as much as we we love one another and we cherish these moments that we can come together and it's vital for our lives it's so important Lord more than I believe that we lord can even realize but Lord we've not we've not come with the with the main purpose to see one another we come here with a purpose to see you we want to behold you Lord Lord that the word itself would speak speak to each of Our Lives to every need that's here that the word Lord would ch challenge us and encourage us go deeper Lord Lord going deeper isn't so much us walking from this room to that room as it is you us surrendering and you going deeper in our lives Lord even as we stand here this morning there's needs Lord that are throughout the building hearts that Lord that God were requests have been offered up that lord said that's that's the life that I want that's the life that I want I I want that substance I want that life that's that's what I want Lord now father that required faith in order to raise that hand to defy a law of gravity Grace has given to rise above law and they Lord have accepted that Lord now I ask oh God that as they would just keep their eyes on you you will do for them Lord you can do it right here in this moment you can do it in the next moment but God I'm asking Lord that may such a Grace and determination so set upon their hearts and their lives from this moment forward Lord they'll not take their eyes off of you Lord to that thrill to that joy to that peace has come into their lives and they can see you living through them Lord and I'm asking Lord that for every one of us Lord that are here sometimes Lord our ideas that's what gets in the way Lord all of us our ideas Lord if your Prophet could stand there in 1965 at the close of his ministry one of the last messages he would preach on the wings of a snow white dove and he could speak about that experience at Eagle Rock and he would speak regarding the word that's been opened in this hour and say to you in prayer that we could hear it Lord you have led me to a faith like I never had before Lord that's an example for my life for our lives that you've come to lead us to a place to where our faith greater than what it is now every every aspect of our life lord it's not looking for great big glamorous things it's it's in the simple things you coming in Lord and moving through every channel and every thought of our life Lord we want to make room for you in the simple things of life that we're every because why in our thoughts that's where decisions are made is in the mind where Lord God to where we even begin with that place say Lord let my life let my mind be filled with your thoughts that the decisions that I make it leads it leads me closer to you because I can't go forward and backward at the same time but I want to go forward I want to go forward I want to press on I want that word to continue to work and the maturity and every bit of the greenness being baked out of my life I want to become more and more and more and more in the image of Jesus Christ Lord the desire in our hearts I think Lord of how that the prophet when there could be others Lord that they would look they would mistake things things that would be said but to think Lord how that brother brandham when he sat there and it had troubled sister da she couldn't figure out why are people saying brother Brown why are these people calling you Jesus Christ why are they saying this brother Bram Lord as he took that CU it's also in questions and answer 64 there but he took that very thing he said that's it's not right it's a spirit that's there he said but if it wasn't so close as that I would doubt my Ministry oh God [Music] it's not Lord us walk it's not in these things sometimes in our ideas that we have we limit you in our ideas but may we recognize it's Christ help us Lord It's Christ Living out his own life through our lives through the vocation of life that he's called you to it's Christ Living out his own life his word through your life Lord not something that we have to make ourselves but may we lord just just surrendering to you becoming what we're beholding Lord help us Lord I pray we love you we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ you love him Hallelujah encouraged to press on encouraged to keep pressing let's press toward the mark let's go deeper let's become what we're beholding the prophet said as you walk in the light then as you walk in that watch more light open and unfold that's our desire isn't it amen if you'd like to stand with us could we just invite him just to water the word he's right here just to water that word in in our lives it's something we take and we meditate about and we pray over we pray I tell you friends that's that's a prayer constant in my life I'm just giving you a little bit of an Insight but that's a prayer that's constant is Lord I want to be a better servant I want to be a better servant that's right help me Lord show me Lord where my I may know where weaknesses are at but show me help me Lord I want to see this word I want in every aspect of my life until I stand there and we see him that day it is we worth it all every bit of pressing beyond the weakness of our flesh pressing to just make contact with him in prayer just pressing and putting on a tape and taking in the message and where it feels like oh you're not getting anything God's not telling you that that's right just you just you put on the word and and here you are you're reading you're like I am sometimes in my devotions when I'm reading in devotions my sometimes it's just like it just things just start just just moving but then there's other times I'm reading in devotions that day and I'm my mind everything coming what about this what about this need what about this oh you better put this in reminders oh you better do this you're going to forget this your wife told this call this one call this you got to do this you got to and [Music] then it's real isn't it those are moments let me just tell you something those are moments to press press Beyond because the reward is worth it there's times where we appreciate the feelings we appreciate feeling God but there's sometimes we got to go beyond our feelings because our feelings will lie to us but he's never lied to us he said whether you feel me or not lo I Am With You [Music] Always every every moment in our life Lord I want to take in I want to just take in I want to become more like you go ahead brother Brian just lead us brother we have had enough of getting everything we want yes Lord we are weary of Liv in this life

and honor and glory and power amen amen amen blessing in honor and glory and power onen blessing and honor and glory and power [Music] on I want you to think about this as we prepare to go sometimes our our thoughts and our minds we're talking about becoming what we're beholding it's not about what we're doing as far as us doing or us making it happen it's about us yielding in his presence because the disciples could not bring to pass what they were beholding with the resurrected Messiah but he pointed them where to go and T and they went and they were endued with power from on high H how did they go there they went there as yielded vessels so then in Acts 19 how did that happen yielded vessel because we've all been there we've all even been in areas of our life where here the word is coming to pass and we want to see the word come to p and then we we we look at it as though it's something that we've got to do or I've got no it's what we're yielding ourselves to that's why we want to behold and know that Satan is interested in distracting that's like where a person who is sick in their body remember brother brandom talked about here you're prayed for and he says all of a sudden he says you get worse the tumor and everything swells up and immediately at that moment everything comes around I'm not any better I'm worse I feel worse today than I did before he said that's the best sign of your healing see is what we're beholding and yielding to that word regardless of what my senses say regardless of any other thought regardless of anything let every man's word be a lie and God's word be true yes sir and that's simple yielding to the word of God even as we're taking and we're meditating on the word of God when you are in a moment that you may not feel as a very spiritual moment and here you are working and walking through the factory walking through the store and you're meditating on the things of God you know what's happening you're yielding that's good so good sometimes you don't don't expect things to all of a sudden it' BEC coming saying pow things are happening just like that no no it's little by little amen from Glory unto Glory just say it like this Lord I'm just going to give myself to you you know what you put in me you know how to bring every leaf out of the apple seed every Apple out of the apple seed I'm just going to stay in your presence Lord and that's the thrill that's in your heart as a Believer to know I'm in his presence I I I see what he's doing in my life I see he is working w't you love him to I didn't mean to keep you standing there amen just sing another song for us while we have prayer yeah hold on brother Brian A tes okay uh brother Brian how about this she just wants to give a quick testimony the red the red there you go s read it let me appreciate Sister Rita I love you guys my brothers and sisters well the Lord has put upon my heart you heard my testimony how the Lord God healed me of for stage cancer and then I gave you the testimony of them going to do a biopsy on me had me on the table all the tubes up in me and everything and they couldn't it totally shrunk they couldn't find nothing to do it on well I was sick there a couple weeks you know elements from the enemy with a cough and sore throat so I was out for like two weeks and I kept Colin told him I had to cancel well I did get to go to him last Monday and uh he's coming in he's got my papers and he's walking in reading my papers and then he stopped dead in his track he said what is this and then he walked a few more feet and he said what is this he said he said you don't feel no pain or nothing he said I said no he and he said I don't understand it I said I do it's God that's what it is it's God so I just want you guys to know I want you to hear what the cancer doctor said amen amen oh praise the Lord H God good amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh how thankful I am Sister Rita when she had shared that before I said oh just how wonderful how wonderful the Lord is the doctors look at it and the doctors can only go by what they see that's right what they feel what you tell them but I'm glad there's a greater report oh yes hallelujah oh yes there's another report and that's a report I believe amen oh how we thank God for his Mercy you know what that is that's that's for us as a body it there can be others that would see it in other places but that's for us as a body yes that no matter what report you've received there's a greater report that's right there's a greater report and whose report will you believe you want to believe his report that's the one that's the truth it can be a lot of facts ain't that right be a lot of facts but facts aren't the truth no facts are there were giants in the land but the truth was I've given you the land I'm not going to preach right here but if we could a lot of facts Satan May saying there's a lot of facts about your life but your facts are not the truth that's right don't you love him Hallelujah God is so good amen we're going to walk like Enoch walked that's right Enoch what did you do when trouble come I walk with God what did you do when things
