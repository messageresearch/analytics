[16:21] just so so happy for
[16:25] brother adam and sister bo and
[16:28] god has added to their family once again
[16:31] and they have a little isaac
[16:35] had a little faith first and then faith
[16:38] led to isaac
[16:40] [Music]
[16:42] amen we just thank god amen for his
[16:45] blessings
[16:46] and i thank god for the adam's sister
[16:49] we just want to as the lord jesus
[16:53] you know you find down through in his
[16:56] ministry
[16:58] the greatest event
[17:02] in redemption that was to take place
[17:06] to make a way for you and i and yet
[17:09] what a life that was shown to us because
[17:12] he took notice when those that were
[17:15] among
[17:17] he noticed even the need in their body
[17:21] they're hungry the disciples who think
[17:25] how they were so
[17:26] everything was so occupied but see god
[17:29] included these things in there for you
[17:30] and i
[17:32] because even in the midst of it he would
[17:34] show that he's interested
[17:35] and knows every detail of our life
[17:39] he disciples the bible says when they
[17:42] brought infants unto him that he should
[17:45] touch them
[17:48] they what are you doing
[17:51] you see the lord jesus here in a time of
[17:54] dedication
[17:56] you know that that was not anything new
[17:58] that was
[17:59] even from the old testament because when
[18:02] even when joseph's
[18:04] sons he from manasseh they were born
[18:07] while
[18:09] joseph and jacob were separated but yet
[18:11] when they
[18:12] brought him to that place and joseph
[18:14] brought that the blessing would be given
[18:17] to that of the children that of the
[18:19] firstborn
[18:21] we know how that god crossed jacob's
[18:23] hand but
[18:24] i always i love how when jacob
[18:28] he prays that prayer and he says the
[18:31] angel
[18:32] that redeemed me redeemed the lad
[18:36] also and you know when we
[18:39] have been born again of the spirit of
[18:41] god
[18:43] that's the real firstborn it takes the
[18:46] angel of god coming
[18:48] to redeem what belongs to him we
[18:51] dedicate this life
[18:53] father and the mother come they want to
[18:56] commit it back into the hands of god
[18:57] committing their lives
[19:00] that god would direct and guide them
[19:02] that god has a purpose
[19:04] for little isaac when the angel of the
[19:07] lord
[19:07] came to manoa's wife
[19:11] it spoke concerning that child
[19:14] and manoa's wife concerning samson she
[19:17] told menoa
[19:18] manoa being a believer he said ask that
[19:20] he would come again
[19:22] so when he came again then he made known
[19:25] to them
[19:26] this is how that you should guide this
[19:29] life
[19:30] they could not make the purpose come to
[19:32] pass in the life of samson but only god
[19:34] could do that but they had
[19:36] responsibilities to raise that child
[19:40] to follow the admonition of the lord and
[19:42] that's the same way
[19:43] with us as parents we we cannot
[19:47] bring them into the birth that they need
[19:50] even into this world it is an act of god
[19:55] but to bring them to that birth that is
[19:58] real life
[19:59] it takes god but thanks be to god that
[20:03] there
[20:05] has been a word a message and the angel
[20:08] of the lord
[20:09] is among us amen to direct us and give
[20:12] us counsel and
[20:14] leadership in this time and a peace and
[20:17] a comfort to know
[20:18] he's the one that brings the purpose out
[20:20] of our life
[20:22] oh my what a message that we've received
[20:25] what clarity what a vision in this hour
[20:28] amen so as we just want to dedicate
[20:32] little isaac to the lord his brother
[20:35] adam and sister bo

[23:39] brother alex
[23:41] that won't that won't fit me
[23:44] thank you and you might be generous
[23:48] buddy but that won't fit me
[23:50] amen well we just we just want to turn
[23:53] our attention to the word of the lord if
[23:55] you wouldn't mind standing
[24:00] and believe me i understand we're here
[24:02] and these
[24:03] have these contraptions on our face at
[24:05] times like that you i
[24:07] understand at times it's just like you
[24:08] gotta pull it down and up and
[24:10] other things like that don't it don't
[24:12] bother me a bit
[24:14] at all i understand those things that
[24:17] has to happen
[24:18] so let's just look here to the word
[24:21] we're just going to read one scripture
[24:23] and we'll just let you have your seats
[24:25] then in james chapter 2 and i just want
[24:27] to read the very
[24:28] last scripture verse 26.
[24:32] james says for as the body without
[24:36] the spirit is dead
[24:39] so faith without
[24:42] works is dead also
[24:47] look how he parallels this together for
[24:50] the body
[24:50] without the spirit is dead
[24:54] so faith without works
[24:58] is dead also
[25:01] the brown would say it like this and
[25:02] works as faith express we started with
[25:04] this last week
[25:06] faith and works are husband and wife
[25:11] they work together
[25:14] the husband works with the wife the wife
[25:17] with the husband
[25:19] they identify one another
[25:23] amen lord jesus we just
[25:26] look to you now father in the further
[25:28] part of the service
[25:30] we just invite you god that you will
[25:32] just come and
[25:34] speak to our hearts and minister to our
[25:36] lives in a very special way
[25:38] we ask it in the name of jesus christ
[25:40] amen god bless you for being seated
[25:44] i'd like to continue to speak on that
[25:46] thought operating
[25:47] by the faith of the hour
[25:51] and to see how that when we
[25:54] see this with faith and works of how
[25:56] that they identify
[25:58] one another and we've been reading in
[26:00] that scripture that
[26:01] undoubtedly that you are very familiar
[26:04] with that
[26:06] we recognize that when jesus when he was
[26:08] here
[26:09] upon the earth remember many of them
[26:12] they
[26:13] they they questioned him
[26:17] and even the disciples they
[26:20] they themselves had had a difficult time
[26:23] sometimes to understand
[26:25] of who he was and to even understand
[26:28] even at times as brother bran would
[26:30] place it
[26:31] who was speaking was it was it the son
[26:34] or was it the father who was speaking
[26:36] but behind that
[26:38] and they they you know it wasn't you see
[26:40] when when god does something it is in
[26:42] such
[26:43] simplicity that it goes
[26:47] goes so far beyond the natural
[26:50] thinking the natural thinking cannot
[26:52] even grasp it
[26:54] but it takes the mind of god coming down
[26:58] and to even open to us to where we can
[27:00] begin to see
[27:02] even what god is doing um
[27:05] and this is where jesus would say even
[27:07] in john 14
[27:09] when he would speak to philip and the
[27:10] rest he says if you can't believe me
[27:13] he also said this to the pharisees he
[27:15] says if you can't believe me
[27:17] believe the works that i do you see he
[27:20] had a testimony
[27:22] where he could declare of who he was but
[27:24] yet his his testimony was just not
[27:26] word only his testimony was
[27:29] was that there is a life there are works
[27:32] that are being expressed through my life
[27:34] jesus
[27:35] was in contact and was tapped in to the
[27:38] to the realm of where we see the
[27:41] prophets were
[27:42] at times where they would tap into it
[27:44] down through the ages but yet
[27:46] there had to come a restoration to where
[27:49] that which adam fell from there would
[27:52] come through the second adam
[27:54] the quickening spirit that would be able
[27:55] to raise
[27:57] us as sons and daughters of god back
[27:59] into that place where god
[28:01] speaks lip to ear to us back to a place
[28:03] to where
[28:04] we are led by the spirit of god
[28:07] with a real change from the inside of
[28:09] our life
[28:10] so where that our life it's not us
[28:12] trying to operate
[28:14] but it is now god operating
[28:17] his life he's operating his word through
[28:20] our lives as yielded vessels
[28:22] and as we looked at it last week god
[28:24] himself does not
[28:25] he does not uh take something based on
[28:29] what the status is in life that's where
[28:31] man does that this is where jesus said
[28:34] judge not he says you judge according to
[28:36] appearance
[28:37] and that's not righteous judgment but
[28:39] he's talking there's got to be a
[28:41] discernment something that comes
[28:43] from deeper within because many of the
[28:45] people would never have even given the
[28:47] woman at the well the time of day
[28:50] even many of the people really think
[28:52] anna was in the temple
[28:53] simeon even where simeon was at think of
[28:55] peter and on and on
[28:57] these were individuals that nobody would
[29:00] have given
[29:00] time to they were regarded as outcasts
[29:03] they were regarded as you know
[29:05] not intelligent not in smart but see
[29:08] paul
[29:08] paul would pick up and he would remind
[29:11] the corinthian church because
[29:13] in that particular locality that was a
[29:15] that was a very
[29:16] wretched city that was a city that was
[29:19] such debauchery and such things that had
[29:22] taken place in that time
[29:24] but paul would remind the believers in
[29:27] that time
[29:28] he would as god told paul remember paul
[29:30] wanted to get out of corinth you
[29:32] remember that in the scripture
[29:33] he wanted to leave it was not a
[29:35] convenient place
[29:36] it wasn't a place that you know you
[29:39] would want to be him
[29:40] but god told him he said he came to him
[29:43] at night and said
[29:44] i want you to abide here for i have
[29:48] much people in this city
[29:51] and they needed to hear the gospel
[29:54] of their salvation they needed a word
[29:58] sounded to them that would start to
[30:01] alert them to
[30:02] this is what i've been searching for all
[30:05] of my life that i couldn't even put
[30:07] my finger on or even explain but
[30:10] something begins to rise within them
[30:12] and they see the condition of their life
[30:14] and this is where the spirit of god
[30:16] could take paul and say you know all of
[30:19] these conditions
[30:20] drunkards of feminine and on and on and
[30:22] on shall never
[30:24] inherit the kingdom of god and such were
[30:26] some of you
[30:27] but you are justified but you are
[30:31] satisfied you are
[30:32] filled with the spirit of god you see
[30:34] that
[30:35] changed everything in other words that's
[30:38] not
[30:39] who you are any more
[30:44] something changed then it becomes the
[30:48] same testimony of the lord jesus
[30:51] where he said if you can't believe me
[30:54] believe the works
[30:56] if you can't believe me it says because
[31:00] the works if i don't do the works of my
[31:02] father
[31:03] then don't believe me that's a pretty
[31:05] bold statement
[31:06] if i do not the works of the father then
[31:10] then you know don't believe me you see
[31:12] and it would be placed in this manner
[31:14] jesus did the works of the father
[31:18] because the father was in him
[31:22] see a change had taken place man
[31:26] here would be the blood over here and
[31:28] here was the law
[31:29] they weren't together and there was here
[31:32] man
[31:32] carrying out the works of the law
[31:35] as best they could but they needed a
[31:38] change
[31:39] on the inside there had to come a change
[31:42] of administration on the inside to where
[31:45] the word
[31:46] and the blood would not be two separate
[31:48] things but it now
[31:50] would become one and it would be
[31:52] conveyed in the person
[31:54] releasing the power that is in the
[31:57] covenant
[31:59] and this is why jesus here now coming to
[32:02] restore
[32:03] what adam fell from and he says he did
[32:06] the works of the father because the
[32:07] father was in him
[32:09] that's why the works was done because
[32:11] the father
[32:13] was in the son the word brother brown
[32:16] will say it like this
[32:17] and i didn't include these up there i
[32:19] just want you to listen he says the word
[32:21] itself
[32:22] speaking from john 1 in the beginning
[32:24] was the word and the word was with god
[32:26] he says the words were invisible
[32:30] the word was invisible until it was made
[32:33] flesh and the word become visible
[32:36] remember the scripture
[32:38] no man has seen god at any time but the
[32:40] only begotten of the father
[32:41] he hath declared him the god we serve
[32:45] is an invisible god the pillar of fire
[32:49] is a veil that he veils himself in
[32:53] right so moses moses did not see him
[32:56] but he saw the hunger parts is that
[32:59] right
[33:00] you see god has always veiled himself
[33:03] it's an invisible god this is why in
[33:05] colossians 1
[33:06] who is the image of the invisible god
[33:10] in hebrews 1 1 god in sundry times
[33:13] a spake unto the fathers in the prophets
[33:17] half in this last days spoken unto us
[33:20] by his son whom he has appointed the
[33:24] heirs of the world who is the express
[33:28] image of god hallelujah
[33:32] that very term expressed image is a term
[33:35] that you and i know very well
[33:36] it's facsimile or facts simply put
[33:40] jesus christ was god facts down to earth
[33:44] you don't fax one thing and then you
[33:46] receive something else on the other end
[33:48] is to receive that same image that same
[33:51] one
[33:51] that same god all that he was back there
[33:54] he
[33:54] poured into christ all that was in
[33:58] christ
[33:59] he poured into the believer amen
[34:02] this is why i love this brother ram says
[34:05] and through
[34:06] his sacrificial death at calvary and his
[34:09] resurrection
[34:11] positionally placed his church
[34:14] in that realm oh my god
[34:18] lifted us from just here we are we go
[34:20] about our daily tasks and
[34:22] you know taking care of this and taking
[34:24] care of this but listen
[34:26] this is not the realm that we're to be
[34:28] confined to
[34:29] [Music]
[34:31] simply put we're not to be confined to
[34:34] our first birth
[34:37] even when you've been born again this is
[34:39] where paul would come
[34:40] with admonition stand fast in the
[34:42] liberty wherewith christ hath made you
[34:44] free and be not
[34:46] entangled again in the yoke of bondage
[34:49] but to stand in that liberty god made a
[34:52] way
[34:52] that we could come into that realm
[34:54] around that place where
[34:56] redeemed where sons and daughters are
[34:58] able to come into that place
[35:00] heavenly places back in contact with our
[35:03] representation
[35:04] we were our representation is that word
[35:07] body
[35:08] that part that god himself is reserved
[35:11] in the heavens
[35:12] it's that part that we're in contact
[35:14] with
[35:19] to see this he positionally placed us in
[35:22] that realm
[35:23] that the same invisible god could come
[35:26] into the individual
[35:28] and make the word visible
[35:33] now let's look at this here just for a
[35:35] moment as we take this thought
[35:38] of faith and works husband and wife
[35:41] they identify one another in ephesians 5
[35:45] 21 i want you to notice
[35:48] paul is writing paul is taking a
[35:50] parallels we'll read here
[35:52] and he deals with of even how that
[35:55] the marriages are even to be conducted
[35:58] but he's pulling it from the ultimate
[36:00] pattern
[36:02] of christ and the church now notice how
[36:04] he places this
[36:05] in verse 21 submitting yourselves one to
[36:08] another
[36:09] in the fear of god
[36:12] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[36:15] husbands
[36:16] as unto the lord for the husband
[36:19] is the head of the wife even as christ
[36:22] is the head of the church and he is the
[36:25] savior
[36:26] of the body i want you to think of this
[36:30] the body his body his body
[36:34] is his subjects his children
[36:37] that which come from the very loins of
[36:40] god's own mind
[36:42] that seed that that from him where
[36:45] did adam's bride come from
[36:49] she came from within him amen
[36:53] that could not be released until adam
[36:56] was put to sleep
[36:58] but when adam was put to sleep calvary
[37:02] then the side was opened and out of
[37:05] adam here come forth what was needed
[37:09] to make up the body
[37:12] are you with me the bible says in the
[37:14] book of uh and the book of genesis
[37:16] male and female created he them
[37:19] but you see that that female part that
[37:22] that spirit that which is part
[37:24] of the original spirit could not be made
[37:26] manifest
[37:27] in that body but there had to be a body
[37:31] that which that original spirit that
[37:34] counterpart
[37:34] could actually be displayed through and
[37:38] it could not go
[37:39] over into anywhere else but it had to
[37:41] come from within him and god multiplied
[37:44] cell
[37:45] on top of sound the same as a calvary
[37:47] when the water the blood and spirit were
[37:49] released
[37:50] this is why god brings you and i back to
[37:53] himself by himself
[37:56] god that justifies god the saint divine
[37:58] and is god that brings the complete
[38:00] change by the holy ghost
[38:02] he is the savior of the body you and i
[38:05] there's no way we could save ourselves
[38:08] we couldn't redeem ourselves you could
[38:11] really try to make your life a lot
[38:12] better
[38:13] but you know what the way this was not
[38:15] god's desire
[38:16] to try to make your life better remember
[38:18] there were many prophets and many of all
[38:20] who lived lived a good life they lived
[38:23] by the revelation that was given at that
[38:25] time but remember
[38:26] that revelation burned in their heart
[38:28] they knew the time is coming
[38:30] they were waiting for it just as they
[38:32] have waited on this time
[38:34] down through the ages knowing this time
[38:38] would come here is that right
[38:42] he is the savior of the body therefore
[38:44] as the church is subject unto christ
[38:47] so let the wives be to their own
[38:49] husbands and everything
[38:51] notice it's not just wives there's not
[38:53] just a woman
[38:54] right this is this life is a designation
[39:02] that lays within to be a wife
[39:06] is that right there are things that come
[39:08] with that just as much husband
[39:10] but listen how how would a young lady
[39:14] how would a how would one know oh
[39:17] this this this this gentleman or this
[39:20] man
[39:20] this this individual he's interested in
[39:23] me he has
[39:23] he's coming into a tent this is the
[39:25] reality of it
[39:26] coming to a time where he's got that of
[39:29] a home on his mind
[39:31] he's gumped out of a family on his mind
[39:33] you know what he might it might have
[39:34] taken him a long time to grow up
[39:36] but eventually we're not god's not that
[39:38] way but you understand eventually comes
[39:40] attack he's not interested in dating
[39:43] nothing wrong with that but he's not
[39:45] interested now he's not interested in
[39:46] just
[39:47] well you know i just want to have a
[39:48] female counterpart no
[39:50] but he makes himself known even in the
[39:52] time
[39:53] you know and it might shock her there
[39:55] over dinner and he says you know what
[39:57] i'm interested in getting married and
[39:59] she might say whoa
[40:00] buddy i don't know about that right now
[40:05] that she might go her own way
[40:08] but nonetheless there is that attribute
[40:11] that part of husband
[40:12] that's being stirred up at that time and
[40:16] when that's made known
[40:17] there is an attribute of life that
[40:19] begins to rise up
[40:22] hallelujah sometimes you know people are
[40:25] looking for signs out here and
[40:26] signs out there look for that attribute
[40:29] to be
[40:29] expressed itself that servitude that
[40:32] yielding of heart
[40:33] that desire that care you see that's the
[40:35] same way it is
[40:36] within the bride of jesus christ god can
[40:39] come down
[40:39] and he makes himself known i want to be
[40:41] your husband i want to be your husband
[40:44] i i want to marry you but a person can
[40:46] say i'm not ready for that yet
[40:48] i'm not ready for that kind of a
[40:49] commitment yet you know i just want to
[40:50] have a good time you know
[40:52] let's just be around one another i'm not
[40:53] ready for that kind of a commitment
[40:55] because there's a lot of responsibility
[40:58] that comes with that
[41:00] but you see when love takes place
[41:02] [Music]
[41:05] brother it's not looking at things like
[41:07] oh i'm going to have to do this and
[41:09] i'm going to have to do this she's not
[41:11] even thinking about
[41:12] she's got to start preparing the meals
[41:15] she's got to clean the house
[41:16] come on now she's not thinking about
[41:19] that that
[41:20] is not even before her you could tell
[41:22] her you realize this has to be
[41:24] yes but you know what it is she is in
[41:27] love
[41:27] with him brother and whatever it
[41:30] requires
[41:31] at all costs that is not going to stand
[41:34] between her
[41:35] and him being united
[41:39] i'm talking about in our life
[41:42] [Music]
[41:45] mother and father you go down there you
[41:47] try not to forget my friendship
[41:49] you ain't staying in this house you'll
[41:50] get out but you see when that pool
[41:53] it's coming greater you're not even
[41:55] thinking about consequences of
[41:57] well you do doing that right there
[41:58] you'll be finding yourself another job
[42:00] you'll be i'll tell you what you'll be
[42:01] out of
[42:02] daddy's company but something's moving
[42:04] down here
[42:06] it's greater than any other word there's
[42:08] a word that's going out that's claiming
[42:10] that life
[42:11] you're not looking at well i got to give
[42:13] this up and i got to give this
[42:15] no no it now it's not looking at what
[42:17] contacts and what affiliations and what
[42:20] you have to give up
[42:21] but you're simply focused in on him
[42:25] and you can't even explain why you love
[42:28] him
[42:32] glory be to god therefore as the church
[42:36] is subject unto christ so let the wives
[42:40] be to their own husbands
[42:41] in everything husbands love your wives
[42:45] even as christ also loved the church and
[42:48] gave himself
[42:49] for it that he might sanctify
[42:53] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[42:57] by the word that he might present it to
[43:00] himself
[43:02] a glorious church not having spot
[43:05] or wrinkle or any such thing this whole
[43:08] scripture right here
[43:09] it deals with the change on the inside
[43:11] by the new birth
[43:12] that leads to the change on the outside
[43:16] glory just as spots are moved and
[43:19] blemishes are moved by the change on the
[43:22] inside
[43:22] eventually there'll be a body where
[43:24] there'll be no wrinkle
[43:27] no wrinkles there will be a complete
[43:29] change all his works
[43:31] are perfect amen oh glory but that it
[43:35] should be
[43:36] holy and without blemish so ought men
[43:39] to love their wives as their own
[43:42] bodies he that loveth his wife
[43:45] loveth himself what's he writing of this
[43:47] is not just writing in the natural
[43:49] remember he's pulling this from how that
[43:52] god himself has so condescended through
[43:55] christ
[43:56] that the whole purpose was his love for
[43:58] his body
[44:00] he loved himself because what really is
[44:03] that part in you
[44:04] that seed that gene of god what is that
[44:07] that's god
[44:08] amen that's a part of god there is
[44:10] laying within that
[44:12] eternal life that gene there are very
[44:14] things
[44:15] are laying there's so much that brother
[44:16] graham could tell us in future home he
[44:18] says you were not saved
[44:20] on any certain day you were always
[44:23] saved you just now recognized it
[44:28] glory be to god so he that loveth he
[44:31] loved letting men love their wives as
[44:33] their own
[44:34] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[44:37] himself for no man ever he ever yet
[44:39] hated his own flesh
[44:41] but nourisheth it and cherisheth it even
[44:43] as the lord the church
[44:45] for we are members of his body
[44:48] of his flesh and of his bones so there
[44:51] is no other way
[44:52] god himself will make himself visible
[44:55] than through his body now there could be
[44:58] many miracles that could take place you
[45:00] know as we've talked about it sometimes
[45:01] you know
[45:02] you can read and you can hear you know
[45:04] different ones that you know here they
[45:05] maybe walk through a hospital or
[45:07] something's taking place in a miracle
[45:09] i've sat around even with family that
[45:11] don't even walk
[45:12] in the light of where that you and i
[45:14] would see and friends let me tell you
[45:16] something
[45:16] they're not absent of miracles and
[45:18] miraculous in their life
[45:20] but you see the miracle itself and any
[45:23] of the miraculous
[45:24] you and i realize that that is to make
[45:27] known
[45:27] his presence and that there would be
[45:29] even of a greater life but you and i
[45:32] did not bring ourselves to this we
[45:34] realize it's much deeper than just
[45:36] even miracles you first of all you've
[45:38] got to be a miracle
[45:40] you may never in your own life say well
[45:42] i have been used to do this and i
[45:43] haven't been used to do this
[45:45] but if you yourself are a miracle by
[45:48] the new birth brother that's the
[45:50] greatest miracle that can ever take
[45:52] place
[45:53] and truly the bible would say that signs
[45:55] and wonders follow
[45:56] them that belief now when we look at
[45:59] this the members of his body
[46:01] we know that you know it's really
[46:03] peculiar i know i'm speaking some people
[46:05] in here are
[46:06] you know medical professionals and
[46:07] you've went through all the different
[46:09] classes but
[46:10] still there are certain things that
[46:11] astound me but just as god
[46:13] himself would talk about upon this rock
[46:16] i will build my church
[46:17] you recognize that that here how god
[46:19] started his church there
[46:21] on the day of pentecost then we see
[46:23] where the fall had taken place
[46:24] but remember she was birthed by the word
[46:27] so in order for her to come back
[46:29] to a complete birth by the word it will
[46:32] take the word itself
[46:33] that revelation of god working in his
[46:35] season until where the body
[46:37] or the bride is standing there in a
[46:40] fullness
[46:40] which he is in this hour that her and
[46:43] christ
[46:44] might be united together think of it
[46:46] that the cells within a body you know
[46:48] it's
[46:49] fascinating that even there's about
[46:51] three you know somewhere about
[46:52] three billion of the genomes of the dna
[46:54] that's in your body and you realize
[46:56] that even with the cells themselves
[46:58] there are components
[46:59] within those cells that when those are
[47:01] released like you take liver cells
[47:03] and you release them into that body if
[47:05] there's a need you know what
[47:07] it is not the kidney has to say oh you
[47:09] don't belong here
[47:11] the muscle in the arm doesn't say oh oh
[47:12] you don't belong here but it's amazing
[47:15] of how
[47:15] that when those cells themselves they
[47:17] will find themselves right there to the
[47:20] liver
[47:21] it is that which is already known it's
[47:23] something that is of its kind
[47:25] it's a cell that knows where to go just
[47:27] exactly
[47:28] as it is with every son and daughter of
[47:31] god
[47:31] in the economy of god in the time that
[47:34] we're living in
[47:35] it's something about it that you and i
[47:37] were wondering we were searching
[47:39] but god never lost sight of you and i he
[47:41] knew exactly where we belonged in the
[47:43] body
[47:44] and the word has come in this hour to
[47:46] bring you and i
[47:47] into that position by his spirit notice
[47:51] this is a great mystery
[47:52] but i speak concerning christ and the
[47:54] church nevertheless let every one of you
[47:57] in particular so love his wife even as
[48:00] himself and the wise see that she
[48:03] reverence
[48:03] her husband now let's look here in in
[48:06] hebrews chapter 10
[48:09] because when we we recognize that within
[48:11] it
[48:12] here the bible would speak about this
[48:15] this great work of redemption to bring
[48:19] about that
[48:20] that union as a husband and a wife
[48:23] you know it's something that when
[48:25] brother brown would deal with this and i
[48:27] know it's on a
[48:27] he's dealing with it on a spiritual
[48:29] level but it brings it down even into a
[48:31] natural time
[48:32] it should not it should not be a
[48:34] question if if
[48:35] this is husband and wife it should not
[48:38] be a question
[48:39] am i married are they married to christ
[48:42] or
[48:42] is it married to christ it have to be
[48:44] such an expression
[48:46] because it's a love affair this is not a
[48:48] duty
[48:49] this is not something we have to do it's
[48:52] a real
[48:52] love affair that's what leads to
[48:55] marriage
[48:57] look at this in hebrews 10 1 how paul
[48:59] would bring it for the law having a
[49:01] shadow
[49:01] of good things to come and not the very
[49:04] image of the things can never
[49:05] with those sacrifices which they offered
[49:07] year by year continually make
[49:09] the comers there unto perfect for then
[49:12] they would they not have ceased to be
[49:13] offered
[49:14] because the worshipers once purged
[49:16] should have had no more conscience or
[49:19] desire of sin but in those sacrifices
[49:22] there is a remembrance again
[49:24] made of sins every year for it is not
[49:28] possible
[49:29] that the blood of bulls and of goats
[49:31] should take away
[49:32] sin because within those animals there
[49:35] was no
[49:36] soul it was blood that was offered to do
[49:39] what
[49:39] forgive or cover
[49:42] the one but the remembrance was there
[49:44] every year
[49:46] though they were forgiven but yet the
[49:48] very
[49:49] cause of it was still there in their
[49:51] life
[49:52] now it might you know obviously if they
[49:54] it was the same thing they fell to
[49:56] in the same year then there was judgment
[49:59] coming to that person
[50:00] they would be put to death you know why
[50:02] that was a type to show
[50:04] that the very atonement of the lord
[50:06] jesus christ when that life
[50:08] would move on the inside of a life
[50:10] brother it releases you
[50:13] from the dominion of sin you're no
[50:15] longer
[50:16] under the hold of sin in other words the
[50:18] administration
[50:19] and the rulership has changed in your
[50:22] life give me some more monitor up here
[50:23] please
[50:24] it has changed within their life
[50:26] altogether
[50:27] you're no longer under the control of
[50:30] that first
[50:30] birth this is why that we needed a
[50:33] redeemer
[50:34] we needed a blood that was able to take
[50:37] care of
[50:37] and pay the penalty and then that life
[50:40] would come to you and i
[50:41] and be able to work on our life notice
[50:44] this
[50:44] in verse 5 wherefore when he came into
[50:47] the world
[50:47] he said sacrifice and offering thou
[50:50] wouldest not
[50:51] but a body hast thou prepared me now who
[50:54] prepared this body we were looking at
[50:55] this last week
[50:56] mary did not prepare this bottle if mary
[50:59] prepared this body
[51:01] satan still got a claim is that right
[51:03] but the bible says
[51:05] in the book of galatians for in the
[51:07] fullness of time
[51:08] god sent his son right born of a woman
[51:11] not made but born of a woman that he
[51:14] might redeem us
[51:15] who are under the curse of the law the
[51:18] bible would go on to say in the book of
[51:19] romans
[51:20] that he came in the likeness of sinful
[51:22] flesh when he stood
[51:24] before those men of pharisees and said
[51:27] before abraham was
[51:28] i am they said thou are not a man more
[51:31] than 50 years old and thou has said you
[51:34] have seen abraham
[51:35] but you see what they were looking at
[51:36] was this visible part right here
[51:38] but who was talking on the inside the
[51:41] same god was speaking
[51:42] on the inside from the throne room and
[51:45] was declaring
[51:46] i was the one who came down and i spoke
[51:48] to abraham i'm the one that created the
[51:51] worlds
[51:52] i'm the one who framed them together i'm
[51:54] the one who took on flesh
[51:55] and discerned the very thoughts and
[51:57] intents of the heart
[51:58] before abraham but notice even in saying
[52:01] things i hope you're with me
[52:03] even in saying things so bluntly so
[52:06] obviously they were not able to catch it
[52:09] what is that it isn't friends but it's
[52:12] something that's wrong with them
[52:13] there's got to be something on the
[52:15] inside that it begins to register oh my
[52:19] it's something that you don't even
[52:20] understand what's taking place
[52:23] but god is moving in your life blood is
[52:26] dealing with your life
[52:27] things are changing about your life
[52:31] glory but a body has thou prepared
[52:34] me in burnt offerings and sacrifices
[52:38] for sin thou had us no pleasure
[52:41] you see it's just so much so much deeper
[52:43] than just forgiveness thank god for
[52:45] forgiveness
[52:46] is that right each day of our life as
[52:49] paul would said i die daily
[52:51] we have to remember over and over lord
[52:53] forgive me
[52:54] but it's not doubt of bondage if it's
[52:57] out of bondage if you're under the
[52:58] control
[52:59] then friends you need to have a real
[53:01] loosening you need to have a real birth
[53:03] because the birth of god in your life it
[53:06] brings control
[53:08] it brings divine authority on the inside
[53:10] of your life
[53:12] notice in verse 7 then said i lo i come
[53:15] in the volume of the book it is written
[53:17] of me to do thy will o god here is the
[53:20] words being expressed
[53:21] above when he said sacrifice and
[53:24] offering and burnt offerings and
[53:25] offering for sin
[53:26] thou wouldest not neither had his
[53:28] pleasure therein
[53:30] which are offered by the law then said
[53:32] he law i come
[53:33] to do thy will o god he taketh away
[53:37] the first that he may establish the
[53:39] second
[53:40] you cannot establish the second if the
[53:43] first is still there
[53:45] the first has got to be removed in order
[53:49] that the second can come
[53:50] in other words jesus will not come and
[53:53] cohabitate
[53:54] with a living old man
[53:58] the new birth is not jesus coming and
[54:00] saying well i'm going to cohabitate and
[54:02] i'm going to reform this guy
[54:03] i'm going to change him and i'm going to
[54:05] take it around that's not the faith of
[54:07] god
[54:07] that's still operating by human
[54:10] intellectual faith emotional
[54:12] sure but it's still you operating it
[54:15] but when he comes what does he do he
[54:18] takes away the first
[54:19] anybody ever like something taken from
[54:20] you
[54:22] you might as well be honest some of you
[54:25] get fat and mad if they come to your
[54:26] table
[54:27] and take your plate away and you ain't
[54:28] even ate the last one little kernel of
[54:30] corn
[54:32] let's god i paid for that that was 25
[54:34] cents worth right there
[54:37] but nobody likes things taken away from
[54:39] us right you just don't like somebody to
[54:41] walk up and say
[54:42] hey give me that i mean you you know
[54:44] it's part of you that would rise up i
[54:46] don't care who you are
[54:47] and what your makeup is you'd feel a
[54:49] little hurt is that right
[54:50] you know what the world's wrong with him
[54:52] why is he doing this but you see
[54:53] the way that he takes away the first he
[54:56] doesn't come
[54:56] and get us in a headlock and pull it
[54:58] away from us no
[55:00] remember this is a work of the faith of
[55:03] god
[55:03] now god does not do away with our faith
[55:06] but it must be our personal
[55:08] faith that would raise to a level but
[55:10] how can it raise to a level
[55:12] without the faith of god how can we
[55:15] raise to a level
[55:16] in something that we're not even aware
[55:17] of there must be that of the faith
[55:20] of god that is present that will come
[55:22] and stimulate
[55:23] our faith to say you know what i i just
[55:26] believe it
[55:27] that he died for my sins i believe he
[55:30] paid the price
[55:31] i believe that i wanted his children i
[55:33] believe that the holy ghost is for me
[55:36] i believe this is my what's he doing
[55:38] he's taking away
[55:40] the first that he might establish the
[55:43] second
[55:43] how is he doing that by his faith coming
[55:46] down
[55:47] and operating on our faith
[55:50] oh glory so we're not just not in
[55:52] comatose lord you just do it all
[55:54] lord i just no it's his faith coming
[55:57] down
[55:59] to operate on our faith he taketh away
[56:01] the first
[56:02] that he might establish the second by
[56:05] the which will we
[56:06] are sanctified through the offering of
[56:08] the body of jesus christ once for all
[56:11] brother baby says it like this i want to
[56:12] read this one to you he says in the
[56:14] beginning was the word
[56:15] and the word was with god and the word
[56:18] was god
[56:18] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[56:20] among us my sheep
[56:22] hear that they know it a stranger they
[56:24] will not follow
[56:26] now we know as bible readers jesus never
[56:28] never
[56:29] said you will become my sheep
[56:32] he said i'm the good shepherd and my
[56:35] sheep
[56:35] know my voice
[56:39] now here he is speaking in all of israel
[56:41] and all of them here on the outside
[56:43] by flesh could say i am a seed of
[56:46] abraham
[56:47] but not all of them were children of
[56:48] abraham children of the faith
[56:50] of abraham the children of the faith of
[56:53] abraham
[56:54] is that of the sheep what brings faith
[56:56] to you and i his voice
[56:58] his voice has authority it has power
[57:01] it's creation it moves in your life
[57:03] you know how it moves down and you
[57:04] cannot even explain the subtleness
[57:07] the peace the direction even in your
[57:09] everyday life
[57:10] you cannot even explain it but man
[57:12] you're happy that it's there
[57:14] you're grateful for the peace and the
[57:16] divine assurance
[57:17] of almighty god oh my think of it
[57:21] man others are looking well i i need to
[57:23] have this promise
[57:24] i need you know if if i serve god i need
[57:27] this promise
[57:28] and i need this kind of assurance
[57:30] brother there's no greater assurance
[57:32] that can be made real to your life than
[57:34] by the divine
[57:35] change of your nature and that on the
[57:38] inside
[57:39] to where you can say i don't know what's
[57:41] going to happen tomorrow
[57:43] i don't know how the outcome is going to
[57:45] be but i know this
[57:46] he said lo i'm with you always he told
[57:49] me
[57:50] i'll never leave you nor forsake you my
[57:53] husband
[57:54] is with me glory be to god
[57:59] hallelujah oh my he says they don't hear
[58:02] these creeds
[58:03] they don't hear these dogmas and these
[58:05] things that's been injected
[58:07] to make an organization instead of a
[58:09] body
[58:10] a body has to have prepared me a body
[58:12] has not prepared me
[58:14] sacrifices and offerings that would has
[58:16] not but a body
[58:17] has thou prepared me a body
[58:20] of believers a body
[58:24] that's been born so in order for this
[58:28] body that's been prepared for him there
[58:31] had to be a body
[58:32] prepared for him are you with me
[58:37] god himself created the blood cell both
[58:41] egg
[58:42] and life is that right
[58:46] he was neither jew nor gentile
[58:49] yet he would be regarded as the son of
[58:52] david
[58:52] yet he is also the root and offspring of
[58:54] david
[58:55] amen is that right he would come forth
[58:59] through him by that of the woman but but
[59:02] it was completely
[59:03] a creation of god you know why because
[59:05] that's exactly what god
[59:06] was going to do for each and every one
[59:08] of us our
[59:10] our coming into this birth into this
[59:12] life this
[59:13] faith it could not be us helping god
[59:16] we've seen the outcome of ishmael is
[59:17] that right
[59:18] it can't be us even by a slight doubt
[59:21] it's got to be
[59:22] god himself coming and doing the full
[59:24] work
[59:25] in our life that's what redemption is
[59:28] all about
[59:28] now think about it here brother man says
[59:30] it like this it's just as simple
[59:32] he said before it can be uh a body of
[59:34] human beings
[59:35] before i could act as a human before i
[59:38] could walk like a human
[59:39] before i could talk like a human i have
[59:42] to be
[59:43] born a human you can't do it unless
[59:48] you're born
[59:48] like a human but you know what by the
[59:50] joy i don't even have to think how a
[59:51] human acts
[59:53] i don't have to think you know what i
[59:54] wonder how human acts here
[59:58] is that right and you know there's a
[1:00:01] part in your life right now
[1:00:02] that even situations that arise and
[1:00:04] before you might have just
[1:00:06] you know given right into it and there's
[1:00:08] things that even how god
[1:00:09] is molding and shaping in your life to
[1:00:11] now when there's situations that rise up
[1:00:13] you are standing there just as brother
[1:00:15] branham did when that maniac came up and
[1:00:18] that man spit in his face
[1:00:19] began to say everything brother braham
[1:00:21] said i did not say a word
[1:00:23] he said because i knew better he said i
[1:00:25] was waiting on the angel of the lord to
[1:00:27] speak
[1:00:28] and that's where you and i god brings
[1:00:30] you and i into that place
[1:00:31] if we if we live in the spirit let us
[1:00:34] also walk in the spirit
[1:00:36] god help me help me when situations
[1:00:38] arise
[1:00:39] things that could try to pull on that
[1:00:41] outside mouth
[1:00:42] pull on that part but there's a part on
[1:00:44] the inside that's governed by the holy
[1:00:47] ghost
[1:00:47] that says lord i want to please you in
[1:00:49] this hour lord help me lord
[1:00:51] i don't want my feelings to be placed
[1:00:53] above the word i don't want my attitude
[1:00:56] to be placed above the word but as a
[1:00:58] wife we want to voluntarily
[1:01:01] surrender ourselves and say lord you're
[1:01:03] my husband
[1:01:04] what should i do in this town let this
[1:01:07] moon
[1:01:08] reflect the glory of the sun
[1:01:15] how would a knot on a tree know how i
[1:01:17] acted how could it ever say
[1:01:19] i don't act like that the only way he
[1:01:21] could be that way would be born like me
[1:01:23] that's the way organization is dead it
[1:01:26] draw people away
[1:01:27] went after a creed but in order to be a
[1:01:30] son of god
[1:01:31] you've got to be born of the spirit of
[1:01:33] god then you become
[1:01:34] christ-like and you do the works of
[1:01:36] christ then you're not funny to them
[1:01:38] people
[1:01:39] a human acting like a human is not funny
[1:01:42] in this day and age i'm thankful
[1:01:47] we got people that act like all sorts of
[1:01:49] things
[1:01:51] hey that's true you know but a human
[1:01:53] acting like a human
[1:01:55] is not funny even for a human for you
[1:01:58] and i to get into a situation
[1:02:00] that might even be fearful might even be
[1:02:02] concerning
[1:02:03] something all of a sudden you get news
[1:02:05] they've found something there's a test
[1:02:07] result
[1:02:08] there's this it's not funny that all of
[1:02:10] a sudden fear would want to come up in
[1:02:12] your life
[1:02:12] that's not funny but what it is there is
[1:02:15] something that's greater
[1:02:16] than that fear it's a perfect love and
[1:02:18] when that when that man on the inside
[1:02:21] can be tapped that fear can try to
[1:02:23] present you're going this is going to
[1:02:24] happen to you this is going to take
[1:02:26] place
[1:02:26] this is what is that that's a goliath
[1:02:28] that's trying to make a boast
[1:02:30] but there's a david on the inside all
[1:02:32] glory be to god he may not be that big
[1:02:35] in stature on the outside but when you
[1:02:38] let god move in your life
[1:02:40] brother there's a great big god that is
[1:02:42] so humble
[1:02:43] he will tabernacle himself in his body
[1:02:46] his seed and it'll express itself
[1:02:48] through your life
[1:02:50] you're not even aware of what's taking
[1:02:52] hold on your life you just know god
[1:02:54] you're in control
[1:02:58] a human acting like a human is not funny
[1:03:00] and a christian acting like a christian
[1:03:02] born of the same spirit is no different
[1:03:06] you see look how paul would place this
[1:03:09] in galatians 2
[1:03:11] 20. he said i am crucified with christ
[1:03:16] nevertheless i live
[1:03:20] yet not i but christ
[1:03:24] liveth in me amen
[1:03:27] and the life which i now live in the
[1:03:30] flesh
[1:03:32] i live by the faith
[1:03:35] of the son of god who loved me
[1:03:39] and gave himself for me
[1:03:43] so there's a part as he could say
[1:03:47] i'm crucified then there's another eye
[1:03:51] that says
[1:03:52] yet i'm living then there here's the eye
[1:03:56] that says the life i now live
[1:04:00] i live by the faith of the son of god so
[1:04:03] wasn't paul
[1:04:04] trying to live this it wasn't paul
[1:04:07] trying to make himself and
[1:04:08] i've got to do this friends it's so much
[1:04:11] deeper than that
[1:04:12] and don't let the devil brage with
[1:04:14] condemnation and try to run your way
[1:04:16] but just know the mercy of god would
[1:04:18] call out to you this morning and say
[1:04:20] there's a deeper life it can't just it's
[1:04:23] not enough just
[1:04:24] faith in the son of god that's not how
[1:04:26] paul was living
[1:04:27] it was by the faith
[1:04:30] of the son of god the same faith that
[1:04:34] the bible speaks
[1:04:35] in in hebrews 11 the same faith that
[1:04:38] spoke
[1:04:38] and here god believing his own word that
[1:04:41] same
[1:04:42] faith that framed the worlds together
[1:04:44] that same
[1:04:45] faith that moved in that time that is
[1:04:48] the same
[1:04:48] faith that moves upon our life if that
[1:04:51] faith in itself
[1:04:53] does not move upon our life and draw us
[1:04:56] into this place right here
[1:04:57] then we cannot be a christian
[1:05:01] amen so there's a life that's being
[1:05:04] lived
[1:05:04] and paul said i'm not the one operating
[1:05:07] it but in order for him to live it
[1:05:09] brother brian
[1:05:10] he's got to be yielded he's got to be
[1:05:13] under the headship
[1:05:14] of the word that has come see that's a
[1:05:17] sign of the new birth
[1:05:18] under the headship of the word not just
[1:05:21] saying we believe it
[1:05:23] not just lining up and saying well i
[1:05:24] don't do this and i don't do that
[1:05:26] because you see for many people the
[1:05:27] token themselves
[1:05:28] many people will look and judge people
[1:05:30] and say oh they got the token i'll tell
[1:05:31] you why
[1:05:32] they can quote this and do that man on
[1:05:34] the outside everything's dressed right
[1:05:35] now listen if the tokens on the inside
[1:05:37] it will display itself on the outside
[1:05:40] but brother and sister the token goes
[1:05:41] much deeper
[1:05:42] than just our dress it goes much deeper
[1:05:45] than just our ability to quote
[1:05:47] our ability to know the scripture the
[1:05:49] token is the literal
[1:05:51] life of jesus christ it will produce the
[1:05:54] same
[1:05:54] meekness and humility that it did in
[1:05:57] that body
[1:06:00] is that right now to think about this
[1:06:03] faith
[1:06:04] you know brother brown would talk and
[1:06:05] speak of it in this manner
[1:06:07] he would speak of how that even in the
[1:06:09] time you know back there
[1:06:11] uh you know in the ages where there were
[1:06:13] many who they had a good human faith
[1:06:15] they believed as far as
[1:06:16] well this is wrote in the word and you
[1:06:18] know the bible says a virgin shall
[1:06:20] conceive and
[1:06:20] here here you know here's mary and and
[1:06:22] they've got all that peace and cues
[1:06:25] but see that's human intellectual faith
[1:06:28] brother brown would say like this he
[1:06:29] says as the church back then
[1:06:31] had many mental believers
[1:06:35] likewise he said even yet today we find
[1:06:38] many
[1:06:38] mental believers it's not a life
[1:06:43] and i hate to say it sometimes it's
[1:06:44] become a lifestyle
[1:06:46] right right where you know you're
[1:06:48] dressed like how the amish they'll put
[1:06:49] on certain attire
[1:06:50] they don't do certain things but it's
[1:06:52] not a lifestyle
[1:06:54] matter of fact it's not something that
[1:06:55] you live it's what he comes in
[1:06:58] and lives on the inside now listen to me
[1:07:00] now when it comes to god deals with the
[1:07:03] life
[1:07:03] he's drawing you and i into in
[1:07:05] justification
[1:07:07] we would repent of our sins that old man
[1:07:09] is still there but what's he doing
[1:07:11] trying to take away the first then you
[1:07:13] find to where then the mind
[1:07:14] is set in order for holiness there's
[1:07:16] ways that you begin to think oh
[1:07:18] i shouldn't wear this and my get this
[1:07:20] out of my closet or i need to stop doing
[1:07:21] this or you know i don't want to do that
[1:07:23] and this is around me what is it it's
[1:07:25] god setting the mind in order for
[1:07:26] holiness
[1:07:27] what's he doing he's getting an
[1:07:29] agreement set up because remember
[1:07:31] he's not going to reach down and take
[1:07:33] something away from you
[1:07:34] and yank it out of your hands and say
[1:07:36] praise god i delivered you no
[1:07:38] deliverance has to come when you desire
[1:07:41] it
[1:07:42] are you with me it had to wait god could
[1:07:45] not have sent moses
[1:07:46] down to egypt any sooner god works on
[1:07:49] both ends glory be to god
[1:07:51] it's just like in this service this
[1:07:53] morning even while you're sitting here
[1:07:55] it's
[1:07:56] god that's already been working on your
[1:07:58] heart
[1:07:59] god working on my heart what is that
[1:08:01] that is omnipotence
[1:08:03] at work and god is moving to bring a
[1:08:06] connection together
[1:08:08] and when the people the bible says begin
[1:08:10] to cry amen
[1:08:12] they got tired of that
[1:08:15] let me just tell you something as a
[1:08:17] parent or a different one or whatever
[1:08:20] you got loved ones why should i pray
[1:08:22] bruce saying i've been praying god would
[1:08:24] save their soul
[1:08:25] just pray and say god make them sick of
[1:08:27] the world amen
[1:08:28] all right get them to a place that they
[1:08:30] don't love it no more
[1:08:32] get them to a place lord god to where
[1:08:34] lord there is no peace
[1:08:36] anywhere for them anymore you know why
[1:08:38] you're not praying that on them to try
[1:08:40] to rob them
[1:08:41] you're letting you know what it is they
[1:08:43] need a real touch
[1:08:45] from almighty god they need the first
[1:08:48] taken away that he might establish the
[1:08:50] second
[1:08:51] and there is no way the second can come
[1:08:54] as long as we're content
[1:08:56] with the first when jesus came
[1:08:59] what did they say you ain't taking our
[1:09:01] law from us
[1:09:03] you're not taking it away right no you
[1:09:05] can't have it
[1:09:06] you're against it it continued on when
[1:09:09] paul was here
[1:09:10] paul could stand there and speak to him
[1:09:13] this man's against the law
[1:09:14] he's taken away from the law you say
[1:09:17] they wanted
[1:09:19] what god had permitted and given to them
[1:09:22] but that was only a shadow
[1:09:29] i don't mind to tell you i like
[1:09:30] sometimes you know i can see in my
[1:09:32] office sometimes i'm there sitting at
[1:09:33] home
[1:09:34] and i can see sometimes i can look out
[1:09:36] god and i can see sometimes a shadow
[1:09:38] and i know my wife is right there i
[1:09:40] could see her come by as a shadow
[1:09:43] anymore you know the boys are almost
[1:09:44] tall as she is and talks to them taller
[1:09:46] and
[1:09:46] everything else you know and but you
[1:09:48] know what there's nothing like her
[1:09:51] i don't hug a shadow i don't tell a
[1:09:54] shadow you know what you're beautiful
[1:09:57] i appreciate you honey i don't tell
[1:09:59] shadow that but i can tell her
[1:10:01] but the shadow only lets me know there's
[1:10:03] a real hurt
[1:10:05] and that's what the law did it let us
[1:10:07] know this was god's nature
[1:10:09] in scripted there and god was letting us
[1:10:12] know
[1:10:12] that i was coming at time as he
[1:10:15] prophesied
[1:10:16] in ezekiel prophesied there in the psalm
[1:10:18] there would come a time
[1:10:19] that god would literally inscript his
[1:10:23] own life
[1:10:28] now as jesus said i've come in the
[1:10:29] volume of the book that it's written of
[1:10:31] me
[1:10:32] so have you been written off and the
[1:10:35] writing in the book
[1:10:36] it's not just writing in the book this
[1:10:39] written expression of the word
[1:10:40] has been wrote in your seed all along
[1:10:45] this is why the world the devil wanted
[1:10:47] to try to make you comfortable
[1:10:49] as he could and according to that first
[1:10:51] nature oh my
[1:10:52] that first man he loved those things he
[1:10:55] went along with it whatever it was
[1:10:56] you know it was within that but yet
[1:10:58] still there was something on the inside
[1:11:00] that this
[1:11:01] ain't satisfying this just saying it
[1:11:03] ain't satisfying what was it
[1:11:05] it's that part of god himself that he
[1:11:08] placed within you
[1:11:09] so that he himself he would come and
[1:11:12] find you
[1:11:13] if it had not been for that you and i
[1:11:16] would be adrift
[1:11:17] just like everybody else but what was it
[1:11:19] that god was tugging on
[1:11:21] god was not tugging on this man right
[1:11:23] here he was not even tugging on my
[1:11:25] spirit
[1:11:26] but he was tagging on that gene on the
[1:11:29] inside
[1:11:30] that is what is magnetized to him this
[1:11:33] flesh is not magnetized to god
[1:11:35] my human spirit is not magnatastic god
[1:11:39] but that seed on the inside brother it
[1:11:42] is magnetized to god
[1:11:45] and that great magnet coming by oh yeah
[1:11:48] that seed on the inside it was bolded
[1:11:51] down
[1:11:52] by the by that of the cares of of our
[1:11:55] life brother brown said
[1:11:56] as a young man he said i would have
[1:11:58] surrendered my life a long time ago but
[1:12:00] there was a
[1:12:01] spirit that hung above me that kept
[1:12:04] pressing me back
[1:12:05] kept pressing me back but let me tell
[1:12:07] you something though that spirit
[1:12:08] could have hung and pressed us back but
[1:12:10] it could not take away
[1:12:12] that part on the inside that was
[1:12:14] magnetized to god
[1:12:16] oh brother what happens the word begins
[1:12:18] to come
[1:12:19] it begins to release it begins to unbolt
[1:12:22] and remove the things that you and i are
[1:12:25] held down by
[1:12:26] what's doing that the power of the
[1:12:28] creator
[1:12:29] himself
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:35] this is why the faith
[1:12:39] brethren would say just like this let me
[1:12:40] say this he says
[1:12:42] it takes the very faith
[1:12:46] of the son of god to drop into a man's
[1:12:50] heart listen this this to me is profound
[1:12:53] so that he can receive the lord of glory
[1:12:58] into the temple not made
[1:13:01] with hands this right here
[1:13:04] it came between james and pat browning
[1:13:07] the human spirit that i have it was that
[1:13:10] that was hanging around my mother when
[1:13:11] it got close for me to be born
[1:13:13] but this temple is a place
[1:13:16] that god says this is my betting ground
[1:13:21] this is the place that i've reserved
[1:13:22] listen to me there's never been another
[1:13:25] seed in this bedding ground
[1:13:28] this bedding ground is virgin ground
[1:13:34] jesus hallelujah it's virgin ground it's
[1:13:37] never
[1:13:37] been touched by man
[1:13:42] neither is it gonna be touched by man
[1:13:45] because you cannot be born of man nor
[1:13:48] the flesh nor the will of man you must
[1:13:50] be
[1:13:51] born of god
[1:13:54] sure god had men that would raise up a
[1:13:56] temple according to a pattern
[1:13:58] then that pattern was given to him by
[1:14:00] the spirit they would move within that
[1:14:02] part
[1:14:02] to raise up the temple but what part of
[1:14:04] the temple did god dwell in
[1:14:06] what part did god say i come and sit
[1:14:09] down by my presence
[1:14:10] he was in the innermost place
[1:14:14] the holiest of holies truly his presence
[1:14:17] was venerated throughout that of the
[1:14:19] whole temple just as it is
[1:14:21] in your life when the holy ghost has
[1:14:23] come and it tabernacles it brings
[1:14:26] to that place to where the first man
[1:14:28] passes away
[1:14:29] that old nature passes away and then god
[1:14:32] moves
[1:14:32] and he raises up that seed on the inside
[1:14:35] you see the old man was not a virgin
[1:14:37] the old man was already condemned but
[1:14:39] that new one on the inside it's a virgin
[1:14:42] bride
[1:14:42] it's never been touched at all but when
[1:14:45] the seed
[1:14:46] of his life comes on the inside it
[1:14:48] raises up
[1:14:49] that new man on the inside of you
[1:14:52] what does that hear the faith of god
[1:14:55] dropping down
[1:14:57] and moving in our life simply put
[1:15:00] it's god receiving himself in you
[1:15:05] it's god coming down and receiving
[1:15:07] himself
[1:15:08] how can you how could it be that you
[1:15:10] could believe for these things
[1:15:11] even as a man would believe unto
[1:15:14] righteousness
[1:15:14] how can that be except the faith of god
[1:15:17] would move
[1:15:18] over that individual and they would be
[1:15:20] able to say i don't want to live this
[1:15:22] life no more
[1:15:23] i want to surrender my life what is that
[1:15:25] that's the faith of god that's moving
[1:15:27] just as it moved on the waters in the
[1:15:28] beginning and begin to push them back
[1:15:30] it's the faith of god that's operating
[1:15:33] that's the same way
[1:15:34] the faith of god operates it brings
[1:15:36] forth sanctification
[1:15:37] and what is it doing even in your life
[1:15:40] you're looking at
[1:15:40] hey i i i don't want to do these things
[1:15:42] no more i want to please god i want to
[1:15:44] serve god
[1:15:45] it even causes you where you start
[1:15:47] changing your friends
[1:15:48] you start realizing hey wait a minute i
[1:15:50] don't want to go that route i don't want
[1:15:52] to go that direction
[1:15:53] your thoughts are being changed who's
[1:15:55] doing that the faith of god
[1:15:57] and what's he doing he's leading you to
[1:16:00] a place to where it's not him
[1:16:01] trying to take it but now you say here
[1:16:04] lord
[1:16:05] he says thank you and then he steps on
[1:16:07] the inside
[1:16:11] he said this is a body that i prepared
[1:16:13] for myself
[1:16:18] this is why as he said it would be a
[1:16:20] living faith this is why
[1:16:22] when you think about it as the bible
[1:16:23] opens in the very first part of genesis
[1:16:26] let every seed bring forth half its own
[1:16:28] kind if dogs beget dogs cats begat cats
[1:16:31] god would beget god's
[1:16:36] sons and daughters of god
[1:16:39] of that same gene that same life that
[1:16:41] same nature
[1:16:42] this is why when the scripture would go
[1:16:44] on here first first john 3 5
[1:16:47] we know that he was manifested to take
[1:16:50] away our sins notice
[1:16:51] the manifestation in order to take away
[1:16:54] our sins
[1:16:55] and in him is no sin now notice how john
[1:16:58] would bring this if this
[1:16:59] is not just a putting away this is not
[1:17:01] just a covering over
[1:17:03] but it's actually a putting away not
[1:17:05] just of the sins
[1:17:07] but it puts away the nature
[1:17:10] because if you go and snap that
[1:17:11] dandelion off the roots still there
[1:17:14] you got to deal with the root you get
[1:17:16] the root out you don't have to worry
[1:17:18] about it
[1:17:18] that thing ain't coming back no more he
[1:17:20] was manifested to take away our sins
[1:17:22] and in him is no sin whosoever abideth
[1:17:25] in him
[1:17:26] sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not
[1:17:29] seen
[1:17:30] him neither known him he's talking about
[1:17:32] being a practitioner
[1:17:33] one who is still under the bondage
[1:17:35] brother samuel i just can't help this
[1:17:37] if you get in him he can help you
[1:17:42] if you just say lord take me deeper into
[1:17:44] that place he can help you
[1:17:46] he has the ability the authority to
[1:17:49] bring you to that place to where it's
[1:17:51] not
[1:17:51] well you've stacked together five good
[1:17:53] days i i tell you man i've had
[1:17:55] i've had two good weeks and i haven't
[1:17:57] but what it is he loosens you
[1:17:59] from the hold of that master
[1:18:02] but he won't force himself on you young
[1:18:05] person
[1:18:05] middle-aged old he doesn't force
[1:18:07] remember he's not and this is not
[1:18:09] the lord jesus is not in a service going
[1:18:11] come on give it to me come on give it to
[1:18:13] me
[1:18:13] come on give it to me that's not him
[1:18:17] no no he doesn't work that way he works
[1:18:20] by
[1:18:20] a love affair
[1:18:24] he wants your hand to be open to say yes
[1:18:27] lord well what is that that's faith
[1:18:30] how does faith come by love amen
[1:18:33] amen whosoever abideth in him sinneth
[1:18:36] not
[1:18:36] whosoever sinneth hath not seen him
[1:18:39] neither known him
[1:18:40] little children let no man deceive you
[1:18:42] he
[1:18:43] that doeth righteousness let me just
[1:18:45] move on this verse here
[1:18:46] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:18:50] even as he is righteous
[1:18:53] righteousness in the old testament was a
[1:18:56] man was righteous
[1:18:57] as long as he done what was in the law
[1:19:01] but this righteousness is not where the
[1:19:03] man
[1:19:04] is trying to do what's in the law this
[1:19:06] righteousness
[1:19:07] is because within him has been birthed
[1:19:10] the very righteousness of jesus christ
[1:19:13] in other words how paul would put it in
[1:19:15] romans 2 they they that have not the law
[1:19:17] speaking of the gentiles
[1:19:19] they that have not the law or a law unto
[1:19:21] themselves
[1:19:23] they are governed by the spirit of
[1:19:25] almighty god
[1:19:26] it's no longer it's person says well
[1:19:28] can't you do this can't
[1:19:29] sure but i don't want to
[1:19:32] but the desire look it goes so much
[1:19:34] deeper than just well i don't want to do
[1:19:35] this and i don't want to
[1:19:36] thank god for that it changes our very
[1:19:38] desires but you see
[1:19:40] as it changes our desires it still put
[1:19:42] it places within us
[1:19:43] a desire for righteousness even to wear
[1:19:46] things that could come up in our life
[1:19:48] it might be a thought somebody says
[1:19:50] something to your work something said in
[1:19:51] the family
[1:19:52] and man that flesh that old part right
[1:19:54] there it can it can want to raise up and
[1:19:56] say you know what
[1:19:57] you need to give him a piece of your
[1:19:58] mind you need to tell them this and tell
[1:20:00] them that
[1:20:01] and tell them that but there is a new
[1:20:03] king on the inside there's a
[1:20:04] righteousness on the inside brother
[1:20:06] samuel it seems like sometimes
[1:20:07] there's a struggle but look what your
[1:20:09] desire is on the inside
[1:20:11] your desire is to please god what is
[1:20:14] that that's a righteousness
[1:20:16] that's issued from the very throne and
[1:20:19] temple
[1:20:19] of god that is set forth in your life
[1:20:23] hallelujah this is why that paul could
[1:20:26] write i don't have this down
[1:20:27] but in romans 3 22 even the
[1:20:30] righteousness of god
[1:20:31] which is by faith of jesus christ
[1:20:35] by faith of jesus christ this
[1:20:38] righteousness is not us
[1:20:39] putting something on but the
[1:20:42] righteousness of god has said
[1:20:44] come here i'ma put you on
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:48] he ain't putting on my body he gets down
[1:20:51] there in the control tower
[1:20:53] he gets down in the control tower and
[1:20:54] like a nehemiah he takes care of the
[1:20:56] spirit realm
[1:20:57] he says get these gates bordered up your
[1:20:59] affection gate's getting a little weak
[1:21:01] let's get it fixed up
[1:21:02] the reasoning gate getting a little weak
[1:21:04] let's get it fixed up memory gate oh i
[1:21:06] can see
[1:21:06] where the enemy's been trying to come in
[1:21:08] on the sabbath day and trying to disturb
[1:21:10] your sabbath trying to recreate and go
[1:21:13] back in old memories you need to get
[1:21:14] that date fixed up
[1:21:15] what is that there's a good man in the
[1:21:17] house that's seated there in the city
[1:21:20] that's why the bible says greater is he
[1:21:23] that
[1:21:23] ruleth the city than he that taketh the
[1:21:25] city
[1:21:26] oh my this is not a god who moves down
[1:21:29] upon our life and then pulls back this
[1:21:32] is not the old testament
[1:21:34] but the new testament on whomsoever
[1:21:37] thou shalt see the spirit descend and
[1:21:40] abide
[1:21:42] this is the son of god this
[1:21:45] is a son and a daughter of god amen
[1:21:50] oh my it's not our righteousness it's
[1:21:52] his look verse 8
[1:21:53] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:21:56] it's a practitioner
[1:21:58] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:22:01] for this purpose the son of god
[1:22:04] was manifested that he might destroy
[1:22:08] the works of the devil
[1:22:12] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[1:22:15] sin
[1:22:16] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:22:19] cannot sin
[1:22:20] because he's born of god there's no
[1:22:23] desire
[1:22:24] the nature's gone there's been the
[1:22:27] change on the inside he's not keeping
[1:22:29] days and times
[1:22:31] he's passed beyond the keeping of feast
[1:22:33] days and times well praise god it's been
[1:22:35] two weeks and
[1:22:36] thank god it's been two months no he's
[1:22:38] passed from time
[1:22:39] into eternity what has this man on the
[1:22:42] inside
[1:22:43] he's passed from time into eternity it's
[1:22:46] not
[1:22:47] it's not anything that well i've got to
[1:22:49] make myself and man i'm gonna make a
[1:22:50] better you and
[1:22:51] five steps to make a better me no this
[1:22:53] comes down where god himself
[1:22:55] recreates in your life
[1:22:59] by his faith
[1:23:03] you see this is why as it goes on let me
[1:23:05] finish
[1:23:06] in this the children of god are manifest
[1:23:09] and the children of the devil whosoever
[1:23:10] doeth not righteousness
[1:23:12] is not of god neither he that loveth not
[1:23:15] his brother
[1:23:17] that's true right part of the
[1:23:20] righteousness of god
[1:23:23] so a paradox itself you know every one
[1:23:26] of us
[1:23:27] when you've been born again of the
[1:23:28] spirit of god it's a paradox
[1:23:31] i tell you it's working a paradox even
[1:23:32] when you begin to see a life being
[1:23:34] changed
[1:23:35] you begin to see things fall away begin
[1:23:38] to see things drop away
[1:23:41] now remember remember you can't pull the
[1:23:44] chicken out of the egg
[1:23:47] preaching preaching brother samuel well
[1:23:49] if i can just get with that brother you
[1:23:50] can't pull him out the egg
[1:23:51] you'll kill him all right oh if i could
[1:23:54] just get you know that that chicken
[1:23:56] would come out no no
[1:23:57] it's got to be under the right
[1:23:58] atmosphere and in
[1:24:00] its time god brings to pass his word
[1:24:04] in his time oh glory be to god
[1:24:08] what happens a paradox a paradox is
[1:24:11] something that is
[1:24:12] incredible but yet it's true
[1:24:17] just like through the scriptures every
[1:24:20] life when you read the lives of
[1:24:22] believers
[1:24:23] it's paradox the red sea
[1:24:26] the parting of the jordan israel going
[1:24:29] and taking kingdoms
[1:24:30] that's much larger than themselves what
[1:24:32] was that that was going on
[1:24:34] it was the works of god according to the
[1:24:37] word
[1:24:38] in that time it was a paradox incredible
[1:24:42] strange but it's proven
[1:24:46] true right think of how men have given
[1:24:49] their lives
[1:24:50] foolishly to try to disprove this bible
[1:24:54] that's right foolishly
[1:24:58] they get caught up in something men that
[1:25:00] tried to prove david never lived or
[1:25:02] tried to prove this and tried to prove
[1:25:04] that
[1:25:05] god would let them go on after so long a
[1:25:07] time so long the time
[1:25:09] until when they finally can you think of
[1:25:11] it at the end of that life
[1:25:13] what 60 years you've wasted trying to
[1:25:16] disprove
[1:25:17] something but you realize even to dig up
[1:25:20] the artifact and say
[1:25:22] oh there was a david it's got to be more
[1:25:24] than that
[1:25:26] you got to know the god of david amen
[1:25:30] you got to know the god of david so you
[1:25:32] see this is why that not
[1:25:33] there's not one of us can actually be a
[1:25:36] real christian brother brain would say
[1:25:37] it like this
[1:25:38] unless we become a paradox in ourselves
[1:25:40] that something happens to us
[1:25:42] that changes our whole being
[1:25:46] see this is why many people don't
[1:25:48] surrender because they're not ready to
[1:25:50] you wonder i'm praying and i'm doing
[1:25:52] this they're not ready to die
[1:25:54] now listen don't get mad at them are you
[1:25:56] hearing me
[1:25:57] don't get mad at him what should i do
[1:25:59] let the love of god be expressed through
[1:26:01] your life
[1:26:02] let them see who jesus really is
[1:26:05] are you with me i mean you can hound
[1:26:07] them well you need to be born again
[1:26:09] you need to be born they they know they
[1:26:10] need to be changed and matter of fact
[1:26:12] many of them
[1:26:13] are under such a such a thing right now
[1:26:15] even how the devil
[1:26:16] not just leading them out there but the
[1:26:18] enemy can get on them and say tell me
[1:26:20] what why would god want you look how
[1:26:22] you've walked away
[1:26:23] look how you've done this you know
[1:26:24] better than this and you know that
[1:26:26] listen the enemy is always there to try
[1:26:28] to play things
[1:26:29] even out of good intentions what should
[1:26:31] i do be jesus christ to them
[1:26:33] be like the lord jesus was in luke 15.
[1:26:36] he sat down and the scribes and
[1:26:38] pharisees they criticized him
[1:26:40] he sat down with with all of those
[1:26:42] sinners and publicans
[1:26:43] they wanted to be around him but they
[1:26:45] didn't want to be around them
[1:26:48] are you with me sinners aren't dumb
[1:26:50] friends we were each and everyone
[1:26:52] sinners
[1:26:53] you don't want to be around somebody
[1:26:54] who's going to pick you apart you
[1:26:55] already know you're a sinner
[1:26:57] you want to be around somebody that's
[1:26:59] god in flesh
[1:27:01] somebody that can encourage you somebody
[1:27:04] that can strengthen you
[1:27:05] it may not be that they can rattle off
[1:27:07] the scriptures it ain't that anyhow
[1:27:09] that brings a change in your life it's
[1:27:11] got to be god
[1:27:12] on the inside it ought to be something
[1:27:15] inside of your life not your speech
[1:27:17] it ought to be your life that people
[1:27:20] want to be
[1:27:22] like you because of the life
[1:27:25] that's on the inside of you
[1:27:28] something about that man something about
[1:27:31] that woman
[1:27:33] they may not be who's who but boy i love
[1:27:35] being around them
[1:27:40] don't let your devil tell you i'm gonna
[1:27:41] preach don't let the devil tell you oh
[1:27:43] you're a compromiser
[1:27:44] you need to say something you need to do
[1:27:46] this you need to do that the devil's
[1:27:47] trying to instigate something
[1:27:49] you need to have discernment i said you
[1:27:51] need to have discernment
[1:27:53] the spirit of god will never lead you in
[1:27:55] a state
[1:27:56] of anxiousness you ought to be able to
[1:27:59] adjourn these things in your spirit
[1:28:00] well i've got to say something i've got
[1:28:02] to say something you're right you've got
[1:28:03] to say something
[1:28:04] but what does he want to say maybe he
[1:28:07] wants to say just by your life
[1:28:10] and an atmosphere is created around your
[1:28:13] life let me tell you something friends
[1:28:14] the word itself is not the letter it's
[1:28:17] not the letter
[1:28:18] the word itself is a person that comes
[1:28:21] among us
[1:28:22] the word is a living reality of jesus
[1:28:25] christ
[1:28:25] he's the one that brings conviction he's
[1:28:28] the one that brings change
[1:28:34] so what should i do quit trying to play
[1:28:35] tug of war
[1:28:38] the word is preached
[1:28:41] conviction is to set in but it's got to
[1:28:45] be
[1:28:46] where that life finally surrenders and
[1:28:48] says yes
[1:28:55] oh lord not by works
[1:28:58] of righteousness that we have done
[1:29:02] can i read just a few more it's not by
[1:29:05] works of righteousness
[1:29:07] and titus which we have done
[1:29:12] good things good things that could be
[1:29:14] done following this and
[1:29:16] following that listen that's part listen
[1:29:18] to me now
[1:29:19] that's part of god working but don't
[1:29:22] rest there you should be something we
[1:29:26] think god if there's something within
[1:29:27] you
[1:29:28] that you want to do what's right maybe
[1:29:30] you walked into this service
[1:29:32] and there's things that maybe that's
[1:29:33] just all about your life but there's
[1:29:35] something moving even in your heart
[1:29:37] right now says you know what
[1:29:39] i don't want to be a partaker of that no
[1:29:40] more
[1:29:42] i'm gonna lay this i don't want this in
[1:29:44] my life no more
[1:29:45] what's what's what's that what's
[1:29:47] happening it's god
[1:29:48] moving it's god moving
[1:29:52] oh glory be to god not by works of
[1:29:56] righteousness which we have done
[1:29:58] but according to his mercy he
[1:30:01] saved us by the washing
[1:30:04] of regeneration and renewing
[1:30:08] of the holy ghost it's him
[1:30:12] it's him that's bringing that change
[1:30:14] about in our life this is what paul
[1:30:16] would go on to say
[1:30:18] second corinthians 5 16 wherefore
[1:30:20] henceforth we know we know man after the
[1:30:21] flesh
[1:30:22] yea though we have known christ after
[1:30:24] the flesh yet now henceforth we know him
[1:30:26] no more
[1:30:27] if any man be in christ he is a new
[1:30:31] amen creature notice be in christ
[1:30:36] he's a new creature all things are
[1:30:38] passed away
[1:30:40] behold all things are become new
[1:30:43] amen amen let me leave you with the
[1:30:46] scripture
[1:30:48] ephesians 2 10 for we
[1:30:52] are his workmanship
[1:30:58] it's not the work of a church if it's
[1:31:01] the work of the church it'll reflect the
[1:31:02] church
[1:31:04] amen is that right we are his
[1:31:07] workmanship created
[1:31:12] created i'm already here
[1:31:16] but he's talking about that inside part
[1:31:21] that inside part that only he can create
[1:31:26] and bring birth to just as much
[1:31:29] as that egg did not come from mary
[1:31:33] god supplied egg and the life
[1:31:37] that seed inside of you was a field
[1:31:42] a womb it was that other
[1:31:46] nature that god needed to raise up
[1:31:50] but before he could establish the second
[1:31:53] he had to take away the first man
[1:31:56] there had to be a manifestation of
[1:31:59] himself that would
[1:32:00] take away the first that would stop it
[1:32:03] from being a i know i need to but
[1:32:05] it would stop it from until it becomes
[1:32:07] this
[1:32:08] lord here take it all
[1:32:11] take it all come live completely lord
[1:32:16] what's creating that that love has went
[1:32:19] to such a deep level
[1:32:21] what does love do you know love is
[1:32:24] very peculiar level calls people to do
[1:32:27] strange things
[1:32:28] when they're in love they'll put the ice
[1:32:30] cream in the microwave instead of the
[1:32:31] freezer
[1:32:33] they're just thinking they start doing
[1:32:36] strange things
[1:32:38] and you know love it's a risk
[1:32:42] i hope you're hearing me right it's a
[1:32:44] risk
[1:32:47] every time you love it's a risk
[1:32:50] you see this is where it's at in your
[1:32:52] life you've tried
[1:32:54] or you thought about it or even where it
[1:32:56] was in our life
[1:32:57] let me just speak for myself can i i
[1:33:00] tried
[1:33:02] i wanted to serve god gave my life to
[1:33:06] god
[1:33:06] and an altar youth camp also here
[1:33:11] i want it but you see
[1:33:15] it had to come a place
[1:33:18] because i remember let me tell you i'm
[1:33:21] just going to speak as he's bringing it
[1:33:22] to me
[1:33:24] when i knelt that day in that basement
[1:33:26] over there
[1:33:28] the joy was something taking place i
[1:33:31] never
[1:33:31] went with that on my mind brother greg
[1:33:33] never went with that on my mind
[1:33:37] and i remember when my brother spoke to
[1:33:38] me that day he said he could see it
[1:33:42] he said you want me to pray with you i
[1:33:43] said i sure do
[1:33:45] even when i knelt down listen to me now
[1:33:48] i was afraid you know what i was afraid
[1:33:51] of
[1:33:52] i've tried this before and i couldn't do
[1:33:55] it
[1:33:59] brother gabriel there was something
[1:34:00] greater at work
[1:34:03] he wanted a pretty place but next to a
[1:34:05] dog came down in the basement
[1:34:09] that life isn't surrendered the same was
[1:34:13] their fear there was a fear that what do
[1:34:14] i do when my friends call
[1:34:16] see all those thoughts were still right
[1:34:17] there but
[1:34:19] there was something working that was
[1:34:20] greater than me
[1:34:22] amen amen amen
[1:34:27] god was working packed up on my cds big
[1:34:32] old box
[1:34:33] gave them away jewelry and stuff here
[1:34:37] i don't need this stuff no more
[1:34:40] what was that that was god working in my
[1:34:42] life in sanctification
[1:34:46] to things just begin to take
[1:34:49] but you know when he was working in that
[1:34:51] there was a faith
[1:34:53] it was growing it was growing
[1:34:57] to where it came to a place
[1:35:00] i wasn't afraid no more i wasn't afraid
[1:35:05] it came to a place to where he brought a
[1:35:07] complete change
[1:35:09] in my life a paradox
[1:35:13] a paradox how many know i'm talking
[1:35:16] about
[1:35:17] there's a change that came about in your
[1:35:20] life
[1:35:21] that you can put your foot on listen to
[1:35:22] me now
[1:35:24] not maybe a day not maybe an hour not
[1:35:26] maybe a minute
[1:35:28] no no no i'm talking about a change
[1:35:32] that you can put your foot on brother
[1:35:35] brandon had an interview with sister
[1:35:36] bruce

[1:35:39] month did you feel this or what day

[1:35:47] way he said
[1:35:49] what was that that changed your life she
[1:35:52] said christ
[1:35:53] he said that's your answer right there
[1:35:56] that's the ground
[1:35:57] of your experience of the new birth
[1:36:00] right there
[1:36:01] to where you have a witness in your life
[1:36:04] i'm not the same guy there's been a
[1:36:07] change it's no longer me trying to keep
[1:36:09] and
[1:36:09] keep no no there's been a change on the
[1:36:12] inside
[1:36:13] what is it a new creation
[1:36:17] amen created in christ jesus
[1:36:21] unto good works
[1:36:25] don't you love him amen don't you
[1:36:28] appreciate his mercy
[1:36:30] amen aren't you glad that he swept by
[1:36:32] over your life and here we were holding

[1:37:04] you walk into a service and you're like
[1:37:05] this
[1:37:06] maybe you've got it right here just

[1:37:09] let me just kind of dramatize them but
[1:37:12] as a service goes on you

[1:37:30] what he's doing
[1:37:31] he's getting you to consider amen

[1:37:42] some i go talk to they work in stores
[1:37:45] and i'll make points to go talk to him
[1:37:48] and you begin to see there's certain
[1:37:50] things you stick around a little bit and
[1:37:51] let them talk about things
[1:37:52] and then all of a sudden they'll start
[1:37:54] talking to you brother samuel there's
[1:37:56] certain things i've been
[1:37:57] i've been wanting to know maybe about
[1:37:58] this or whatever more you might look and
[1:38:00] say well they're still holding it

[1:38:05] like it used to be
[1:38:06] right right it's coming out of their
[1:38:10] pocket

[1:38:32] for every situation answer

[1:38:41] god in you
[1:38:43] he knows what to do amen

[1:39:30] what came anointed the faith
[1:39:34] that was already in him

[1:39:44] what we're in
[1:39:46] god knows the challenge that trials the
[1:39:47] test god knows the things that we're
[1:39:49] facing
[1:39:50] but god has provided the faith that's
[1:39:53] necessary
[1:39:54] to push our faith into that place

[1:40:26] way in your mind i could never have
[1:40:28] imagined this in my mind
[1:40:29] what would it be like how is it that
[1:40:32] it's not me trying to watch this or
[1:40:34] what's that
[1:40:34] but how is it it's a mystery but i'm

[1:41:07] your request be known to the lord
[1:41:09] as we just offer a prayer heavenly
[1:41:11] father
[1:41:13] you're the same god this morning lord
[1:41:16] the same one who moved
[1:41:18] in genesis 1. you're the same god right
[1:41:21] here
[1:41:23] you're god you work on both ends
[1:41:26] you deal with lives you deal with hearts
[1:41:30] lord god it's you that brings about
[1:41:33] the change the transformation in our
[1:41:36] life
[1:41:39] it's your faith lord it's the faith of
[1:41:42] god
[1:41:44] moving down oh god
[1:41:48] how beautiful lord it was spoken the
[1:41:51] faith of god
[1:41:52] that moves down to receive the lord of
[1:41:55] glory
[1:41:57] into the temple not made with hands
[1:42:00] father i pray this morning
[1:42:04] dear god may it be an outpouring of
[1:42:07] yourself
[1:42:08] lord may the faith of god
[1:42:12] lord just take a hold fully
[1:42:16] of hearts and lives lord that they
[1:42:20] recognize this portion this is for them
[1:42:23] maybe they've been lord as you gave me
[1:42:26] that example as i stood here this
[1:42:27] morning of
[1:42:28] their life and like that handkerchief
[1:42:33] still holding on to it it's a risk
[1:42:37] but father where love comes
[1:42:40] it takes us beyond that lord is you help
[1:42:43] me
[1:42:44] i pray that god that i know it ain't
[1:42:46] just words that would make it plain it's
[1:42:48] got to be you
[1:42:49] but sometimes lord you'll use the
[1:42:50] vernacular of man
[1:42:52] you'll use examples paul would use
[1:42:54] different examples
[1:42:56] but i pray god
[1:43:00] even lord as they would maybe fell in
[1:43:02] love with their spouse their mate
[1:43:05] it's a risk but love
[1:43:08] itself is worth the risk
[1:43:13] your god as your faith moves
[1:43:17] it moves away lord all the fears
[1:43:21] will i be able to do this will i be able
[1:43:25] lord help them to see maybe may this
[1:43:28] morning that they see
[1:43:29] they never brought themselves where
[1:43:31] they're at you have
[1:43:35] may they see lord god it's not what
[1:43:38] they're able to do
[1:43:40] the lord like that handkerchief is in my
[1:43:42] hand
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:45] that they're willing to surrender it
[1:43:48] that you can take it lord you can take
[1:43:51] that old nature
[1:43:52] that old man
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:55] but god you can remove it out of the way
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:44:00] raise up that new man on the inside
[1:44:03] as paul would speak of that in the book
[1:44:05] of colossians that we're raised by the
[1:44:08] operation
[1:44:09] of the faith of god
[1:44:12] raised from that state of deadness that
[1:44:16] seed that wound that betting ground
[1:44:19] that virgin ground that lay in our life
[1:44:23] lord that woman at the well i know we
[1:44:25] use her many examples
[1:44:26] one day we're going to know her name
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:31] but her life lord god there was darkness
[1:44:33] all over it
[1:44:35] oh god the atmosphere it was so dark
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:40] i thought she was trying to fit in she
[1:44:42] would try and hear
[1:44:43] try there she had man after man
[1:44:49] but he never satisfied there's a thirst
[1:44:52] within her
[1:44:54] you placed that thirst lord
[1:44:57] that nothing of this temporal life could
[1:45:00] satisfy
[1:45:02] that's the grace of god if you're
[1:45:05] sitting here this morning you say why
[1:45:06] can't i be satisfied
[1:45:08] that's the grace of god
[1:45:12] to see that you're not condemned
[1:45:16] how is that the grace of god so that you
[1:45:19] would not become
[1:45:20] settled in sin oh there might be all
[1:45:24] kinds of sin and everything heaped up
[1:45:25] about your life
[1:45:27] but there is something on the inside
[1:45:29] where you're hungering
[1:45:31] thirsty let me tell you let me tell you
[1:45:34] what our lord and savior said
[1:45:36] blessed are they that do hunger
[1:45:40] and thirst after righteousness for they
[1:45:43] shall be
[1:45:44] filled it's that compartment on the
[1:45:46] inside
[1:45:48] that seed we've been talking about maybe
[1:45:50] you may not understand all of it it
[1:45:52] isn't about that you understand it all
[1:45:54] but it's something that's registering
[1:45:55] down deep in your heart you say lord
[1:45:59] i just want to surrender i wanted you
[1:46:02] lord god you weren't even anticipating
[1:46:06] this
[1:46:07] maybe you came to service you weren't
[1:46:08] anticipating this
[1:46:10] maybe you started coming to this church
[1:46:12] weren't anticipating this
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:16] but it's not a church that you're seated
[1:46:18] in the presence of
[1:46:19] you're seated in the presence of the
[1:46:22] almighty god
[1:46:25] he who takes his word
[1:46:28] for glory and by a spirit in a love
[1:46:32] affair
[1:46:33] he begins to woo to your heart
[1:46:36] he begins to move beyond all the risks
[1:46:40] that are there in your life
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:43] it raises to a place to where
[1:46:46] you believe all things are possible
[1:46:50] [Music]
[1:46:53] lord jesus grant that this morning lord
[1:46:58] dear god no doubt behind hands there is
[1:47:00] hearts that's what's most important

[1:47:07] it were still has that
[1:47:08] handkerchief or that old man still in

[1:48:17] they've experienced that where the faith
[1:48:19] of god
[1:48:20] has moved down to receive the lord of
[1:48:22] glory in the temple not made with hands
[1:48:25] lord they can testify like paul the life
[1:48:27] i now live in the flesh
[1:48:32] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:48:34] not faith in him
[1:48:36] but his own faith
[1:48:40] i'm living by that faith
[1:48:44] it's a living faith i'm kept in victory
[1:48:48] by this faith this is the victory that
[1:48:50] overcometh the world
[1:48:52] even our faith
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:55] lord to think of it our faith would be
[1:48:58] nothing
[1:48:59] without your faith behind it but your
[1:49:02] faith
[1:49:03] stimulates our faith
[1:49:08] lord there's needs right here sickness
[1:49:11] different ones lord god
[1:49:13] that are in need of complete healing in
[1:49:15] their bodies
[1:49:16] different ones lord are in need of
[1:49:18] counsel and direction maybe decisions
[1:49:20] they've got
[1:49:20] in their life but i pray right now in
[1:49:23] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:49:26] just lord god as our brothers and
[1:49:27] sisters down through time
[1:49:29] have faced lord decisions they faced
[1:49:32] adversity they faced tests and trials
[1:49:35] they faced circumstances
[1:49:37] but yet through it all you were faithful
[1:49:41] to see them through lord god to give
[1:49:44] them
[1:49:44] the leadership they needed in that
[1:49:46] moment
[1:49:48] granted lord we're not trying to do it
[1:49:49] on our own
[1:49:51] but we ask the lord god may that faith
[1:49:53] of god whether it be for healing
[1:49:56] maybe there's a decision in your life
[1:49:57] you say lord
[1:49:59] i need that faith to drop for my healing
[1:50:01] this morning
[1:50:02] i need that faith lord god to drop
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:07] well that same faith that dropped in
[1:50:10] order to receive him into the temple not
[1:50:12] made with hands
[1:50:12] the same faith of god that moves down by
[1:50:15] revelation
[1:50:16] that would allow you to rise up and say
[1:50:20] i'm healed i'm healed
[1:50:25] if you haven't received that yet what
[1:50:27] should i do
[1:50:29] hang on to the faith you've got and you
[1:50:31] confess
[1:50:33] how long do i confess it like john ryan
[1:50:36] he kept confessing it confessing it
[1:50:39] until eventually
[1:50:40] sitting in that barber chair it dropped
[1:50:43] it dropped his eyes came open
[1:50:47] don't disregard human faith don't
[1:50:50] disregard it
[1:50:53] but let god move behind it he's the high
[1:50:56] priest
[1:50:58] of our confession
