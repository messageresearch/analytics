[35:28] amen
[35:29] just so
[35:30] grateful to
[35:32] be back together again amen and uh
[35:35] certainly
[35:36] appreciate
[35:38] your prayers this past week and
[35:40] the lord was
[35:41] so good to us
[35:43] and the services
[35:45] you know every every camp is different
[35:47] when you go to it and i'm talking about
[35:49] not just the facilities i'm talking
[35:51] about each year at the same camp
[35:54] it's different and so
[35:56] we just thank the lord for his mercy and
[35:59] god gave just such grace there was
[36:02] breakthrough at the camp with hearts and
[36:05] lives and god helped many
[36:08] many hearts and lives and i certainly
[36:10] believe that we'll continue to see the
[36:12] the testimonies that will continue to
[36:15] come in from that and i certainly want
[36:18] to say i know that it was your prayers
[36:20] and
[36:21] you were joined with many others that
[36:23] were praying for the services
[36:25] and
[36:26] it's just quite something when you
[36:29] i know that for some of you haven't you
[36:31] haven't been there but
[36:33] when i when you see everything at
[36:36] at the meeting
[36:38] from the ministry that's going on you
[36:40] have
[36:41] in the morning you have three different
[36:44] places
[36:45] where there's ministry going on
[36:48] you have the
[36:50] the children
[36:51] up to age
[36:52] 13. in a little tabernacle and when i
[36:55] say little that's just because of their
[36:57] age
[36:58] and the way that they relay and bring
[37:00] the gospel right down into their level
[37:03] and just to seeing the holy spirit just
[37:06] moving among them
[37:08] and then you have
[37:10] the group that's 14 to 18 and they're in
[37:13] the main tabernacle and there's ministry
[37:15] in the morning there
[37:17] and then the group of 19 and older
[37:20] which is that's the group that i had
[37:21] this year they were just laying in
[37:23] teaching
[37:24] bringing bringing things
[37:27] down the things that they're facing and
[37:28] will be moving in into their life and
[37:31] you have three different parts but
[37:32] that's not all
[37:33] every one of the
[37:35] staff and everything that's there the
[37:37] dorm leaders
[37:38] i tell you what there's things that
[37:40] after the ministering sometimes you know
[37:42] we don't walk out of that everybody
[37:44] comes together
[37:45] from 14
[37:47] on up in the main tabernacle at night
[37:50] and sometimes from a service like that
[37:52] we don't walk out of that service until
[37:55] 11 11 30
[37:57] still working with hearts
[38:00] and
[38:01] then there's some
[38:03] counselors are still in there some
[38:05] counselors remain
[38:06] some of those
[38:08] children young young people are not
[38:10] getting back to their dorms
[38:11] to 1 30
[38:13] 2 in the morning
[38:15] god just moving down and they see a
[38:18] living lord jesus christ and it's just a
[38:21] moment of breakthrough
[38:22] and we witnessed that
[38:24] and uh this
[38:26] this week and
[38:27] you know sometimes it's a little hard i
[38:30] in in in sometimes the services like i
[38:32] told you sometimes the atmospheres
[38:34] sometimes we have to press even when we
[38:36] come here
[38:38] and um but you know just because we have
[38:40] to
[38:41] press it's one of those things we just
[38:43] realized okay i sense this i'm gonna
[38:45] have to press a little bit
[38:47] it's just like in those services you
[38:49] could kind of ins and some of the things
[38:51] starting up okay we're gonna have to
[38:52] press and
[38:53] you know sometimes what we would do and
[38:55] we start seeing that i start looking
[38:56] strategically where i'm gonna set that
[38:59] night
[39:00] i start look where am i going to sit you
[39:02] want to i want to find a place where i
[39:04] can start pulling and just pulling the
[39:05] presence of god right back over like
[39:08] like a like a like like a like a sheet
[39:10] or a tent just getting right in there
[39:12] let's just let's just pull pull on the
[39:14] gift of god and
[39:15] so we start you know
[39:17] you start kind of strategically
[39:19] positioning yourselves and then i think
[39:21] that be something good here for the
[39:22] assembly as well
[39:24] there's times where we as we come in and
[39:26] we can sense sometimes you know it
[39:27] becomes to us sometimes what are we
[39:30] going to do sometimes when there's might
[39:31] be seems like a tense service like boy
[39:33] brother brian's having a hard time
[39:35] brother so-and-so's having a hard time
[39:36] well you know they keep putting bullets
[39:38] in the gun we want we want to get in
[39:40] there and say yes lord
[39:42] that's why we keep that's why with the
[39:43] song is that keep singing keep singing
[39:45] just leave it leave it leave it leave it
[39:47] lead us into that present because as we
[39:49] move into that place right there
[39:51] sometimes it can be tight because you
[39:52] know
[39:53] we go through things
[39:55] sometimes our spirits we can be
[39:57] tight
[39:58] is that right
[40:00] then sometimes as we move into those
[40:01] places say god help us
[40:03] and we just start pressing in there and
[40:05] start pressing in you know and
[40:07] so it's just like brother brian i heard
[40:10] what he said today how he felt and
[40:13] sometimes when sometimes we don't always
[40:16] feel that way
[40:17] is that right
[40:18] that's where a sacrifice of praise comes
[40:20] in
[40:21] that's where sacrifice comes in and
[40:24] that's where sometimes we just we we do
[40:26] it not because we feel sometimes you we
[40:28] just we don't feel but we do it because
[40:30] he's worthy
[40:31] amen and we just we love him
[40:34] amen where would we be without him
[40:36] amen he's so precious to us and so i
[40:39] just wanted to share that with you and i
[40:41] would have paul and ben they they went
[40:43] with me i would have them give
[40:44] testimonies here today but i know that
[40:47] it's kind of putting them on the spot
[40:48] but i know that they were really blessed
[40:51] in the meetings and the services
[40:53] among others and so
[40:56] i just want to say thank you for your
[40:57] prayers
[41:00] and no way i can only relate it and
[41:02] relay it that when
[41:03] thursday morning was over for me you
[41:05] know how they have a pressure valve on
[41:07] the pressure cooker that's how i felt
[41:12] something that's been months and months
[41:14] and months and months and you know just
[41:15] trying to find the mind and the leading
[41:18] of the lord and that's how it is with
[41:19] all of the the brothers in the ministry
[41:21] and we just i just thank god for
[41:24] everyone they did they just did such a
[41:25] tremendous job but the daniel andes
[41:28] brother andrew glover brother jonathan
[41:30] martin brother paul lafontaine

[41:41] amen the the people of god and the bride
[41:43] of jesus christ and hearts being edified

[41:48] of god so i would just want to say thank
[41:51] you you you may not
[41:53] see it but
[41:54] your prayers were effectual
[41:57] it had an effect
[41:58] and as you continued to pray in those
[42:01] services so i just want to say thank you
[42:05] this morning we want to lift the
[42:08] special offering here for
[42:11] the building project

[46:02] turn to first john chapter 2.
[46:12] amen it's just so good to see you and be
[46:15] with you and i just have heard just
[46:17] wonderful reports
[46:18] of the of
[46:20] the service here on thursday and i'm so
[46:23] i'm i'm blessed by hearing that amen
[46:26] that
[46:26] that you you've been edified
[46:30] so i just really look forward to getting
[46:32] getting in and just listening to that
[46:34] that message as well because i just uh
[46:38] to me i so appreciate
[46:39] brother nathan erickson and the gift
[46:42] that's there in his life and
[46:45] i just really
[46:46] really really appreciate
[46:49] the yielding to the lord
[46:51] verse 12 i'm just going to read a couple
[46:53] verses that we've been reading these the
[46:55] past two services but i want to just
[46:57] move here and try to bring something to
[47:00] a point this morning
[47:01] in verse
[47:04] verse 13
[47:06] we'll start there
[47:08] i write unto you fathers because ye have
[47:10] known him
[47:12] that is from the beginning
[47:14] he's talking about knowing the word
[47:17] and the word in the beginning was the
[47:19] word and the word was with god and we
[47:21] realized that the
[47:22] word is not a letter but the word is the
[47:27] person
[47:28] of jesus christ
[47:31] because you have known him that is from
[47:33] the beginning and i write unto you young
[47:35] men because you have overcome
[47:38] the wicked one
[47:40] write unto your little children because
[47:42] ye
[47:43] have known
[47:45] the father and god add the blessing to
[47:47] the word that you're being seated
[47:49] i'd like to continue on that thought i
[47:51] write unto you fathers
[47:53] and as we
[47:56] are looking as
[47:57] paul or not paul but as john would write
[48:00] this by inspiration
[48:02] it's what an encouragement it is
[48:05] that god has set forth and there are
[48:07] hearts and lives
[48:09] that
[48:10] have
[48:11] have a good understanding and a good
[48:13] understanding is not
[48:15] so much that it's com
[48:17] all knowledge
[48:18] because we we know it takes something
[48:20] it's more than knowledge
[48:22] knowledge itself can never it never can
[48:25] and it never will change anybody but it
[48:27] takes an understanding and if i could
[48:30] say it in this way understanding what
[48:32] i'm speaking of is where the word itself
[48:34] because we have to have knowledge we
[48:36] have to have instruction the bible comes
[48:38] to and the word of god comes to instruct
[48:41] us in other words to set a clear
[48:43] expectation
[48:45] that we can move within that channel of
[48:47] the word that's open to us and then the
[48:49] understanding itself is where when that
[48:52] word begins to move down in our life and
[48:55] that word this is something i want you
[48:57] just to take is that the word itself
[49:00] the word is eternal so the word just
[49:02] doesn't come into our life and just
[49:05] like as moving my bible and it moves
[49:07] here and it just stops
[49:08] the word as it comes into our life it
[49:11] keeps moving
[49:13] in our lives
[49:15] the word that we receive it isn't just
[49:17] oh i've got that revelation and now i've
[49:18] got to get this revelation the word
[49:21] itself what it is he keeps unfolding
[49:24] himself and that word just keeps opening
[49:27] keeps it keeps working in our lives
[49:30] the bible said perfect love casteth out
[49:34] all fear
[49:35] and the love of god is the holy holy
[49:37] ghost that is the word of god as it
[49:39] comes into our life it dismantles
[49:43] every
[49:44] hold of fear uncertainty
[49:47] worry and doubt and i'm glad he's still
[49:50] doing that
[49:51] when the enemy would want to raise his
[49:53] head up and maybe stand in our
[49:56] conscience i'm talking in our spirit
[49:58] realm or something comes up in the
[49:59] reasoning i'm glad that there's a
[50:01] greater power on the inside that
[50:04] is able and it releases to us a virtue
[50:07] and a strength to dismantle the hold of
[50:10] the enemy if the scripture at which it
[50:12] does tell us to cast down you and cast
[50:15] down imagination and everything that
[50:18] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[50:20] god i'm thankful there's a resource and
[50:22] a power that you and i are able to draw
[50:24] from and that person that that that
[50:27] resource is the very person of jesus
[50:29] christ himself
[50:31] that's what the word is the word is the
[50:33] person of jesus christ it is that same
[50:36] word that the bible says that that was
[50:39] that was god that that that is god that
[50:42] was in him and that same life it came to
[50:46] give light into men an understanding and
[50:50] and in this hour there's a lot of things
[50:52] that's called light the bible says this
[50:55] in this in this day
[50:57] in this time that we're living in it
[50:59] would be a time when light when it would
[51:01] be not
[51:03] clear not day nor night
[51:05] but god said i will bring a real
[51:08] understanding in the evening time
[51:11] that would be a light so it's not
[51:13] something that's vague and something
[51:14] that's gray and all covelled or covered
[51:17] over but i will bring something that's
[51:20] absolute
[51:21] something that is true something you are
[51:23] able to put
[51:24] your feet upon and stand upon solid
[51:27] ground
[51:28] and god has made a promise in every time
[51:31] knowing what would come in the
[51:33] advancements how satan would come and he
[51:36] says i will raise the standard when the
[51:39] enemy comes in like a flood i will raise
[51:41] a standard against the enemy and the
[51:44] standard is not god giving another word
[51:46] but it's god making his word more sure
[51:50] more real and how does he do that but by
[51:52] himself coming into his word and making
[51:55] that promise real so then we as the
[51:58] children of god have a clear direction
[52:01] and an expectation for our lives so
[52:05] we're not left wondering what comes next
[52:08] what comes next but god opens a clear
[52:10] direction that we can have faith and
[52:13] faith is that which looks beyond that of
[52:16] just the temporal it looks to what god
[52:19] says and says regardless how i feel
[52:21] regardless how i think regardless of
[52:23] what everything's going wrong this is
[52:25] what god has said this is god's desire
[52:28] and faith itself is like an anchor
[52:30] that's just cast into that place to say
[52:32] so being lord
[52:35] and then allow the word just to come as
[52:37] i said is the word moving in our life
[52:39] and what does it do it dismantles every
[52:42] hold of doubt or unbelief every bit
[52:45] around our life that's the power of the
[52:47] person of jesus christ the holy spirit
[52:50] working in our lives
[52:52] so this this gospel the word that god
[52:55] has given to us in this hour it has it
[52:58] calls for relationship and it's deeper
[53:01] relationship than what has been through
[53:04] the seven church ages because every one
[53:07] of the seven church ages had a portion
[53:10] or brother brown would say their dip in
[53:13] the holy ghost
[53:14] they each had that but we're living in
[53:17] the bride time or as the scripture says
[53:21] let us be glad and rejoice for the
[53:24] marriage of the lamb has come
[53:26] and that you we can't you we're not
[53:28] united with just a part of him we're not
[53:31] even united with the shadow we're not
[53:33] united with the type we're not we are
[53:35] united we're now the very person himself
[53:39] the holy ghost in its fullness has come
[53:42] down right among us in the promise of
[53:45] his word to unite a people together in a
[53:48] perfect relationship
[53:51] and it's it's it's rapturing grace for
[53:54] you and i
[53:55] it's a it's a relationship that through
[53:57] that relationship the lamb himself is
[54:01] revealed and as he's revealed through
[54:03] that revealing it also makes known this
[54:06] is the lamb's wife
[54:08] these two shall no longer be twain
[54:11] but they're one
[54:13] and so when we see this of of the
[54:16] father's this understanding notice how
[54:18] that the scriptures would speak through
[54:20] the life of the lord jesus when he was
[54:22] standing here as one
[54:25] that when god came came to redeem you
[54:28] and i
[54:29] god became one of us
[54:33] and he became one of us that he might
[54:35] redeem us and through that oneness also
[54:38] that he might be able to understand us
[54:41] to be a faithful and merciful high
[54:44] priest one that can be touched by the
[54:47] feeling of our infirmities in other
[54:49] words there's nothing that you
[54:51] can experience that he has not already
[54:55] experienced
[54:57] and you have to understand experience
[54:59] itself doesn't even have to do with with
[55:02] with a committing but an experience
[55:04] itself is where he was tempted in all
[55:07] points such as we are
[55:10] yet without sin he experienced what it
[55:12] was
[55:13] when when when sadness would come he
[55:16] experienced depression he experienced
[55:19] this is scripture now the bible says he
[55:22] he suffered in the in the garden of
[55:24] gethsemane when you when you study that
[55:26] in that portion he studied depression as
[55:29] if we could take it on his scale he's he
[55:32] he came to experience of what it was at
[55:34] an apache moment
[55:37] he experienced that he said brother
[55:39] samuel what does that mean well it
[55:41] doesn't mean that he came that in order
[55:44] we could have a separate group and say
[55:46] this is where all the anxious people
[55:48] gather we'll probably all be there this
[55:50] is where the people because at one time
[55:51] or another we're anxious or we're
[55:53] depressed
[55:54] come on church let's be real now
[55:56] but he didn't come to make camps he came
[55:59] to deliver us out of that camp
[56:01] he came to us so we can say father i'm
[56:04] feeling this way i'm feeling like david
[56:06] said when my heart is overwhelmed
[56:10] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[56:12] i
[56:15] open up that pathway lord open that up
[56:17] lord then and so we have a faithful and
[56:19] merciful high priest god became one of
[56:21] us and through that relationship notice
[56:24] through that relationship as he himself
[56:27] is on his way in the fulfillment of the
[56:29] word he speaks to the disciples and he
[56:32] lets them know there's a change in
[56:34] relationship i'm no longer going to call
[56:36] you servants because a servant doesn't
[56:38] know what his lord is doing but i'm
[56:39] going to call you friends
[56:42] so that that change in word from servant
[56:45] to friends
[56:46] it was declaring this is a moment of
[56:48] change this is a season of change this
[56:50] is a moment where there are things that
[56:53] can be begin to be made known to you in
[56:56] a greater measure then after the
[56:59] resurrection he comes and he declares
[57:02] there's now a change in relationship
[57:04] because the price has been paid the debt
[57:08] has been settled is that right
[57:10] he has he has ascended up now it's time
[57:14] for
[57:15] complete relationship but all of these
[57:18] parts servant friends now leads to this
[57:21] place
[57:22] call us brethren
[57:25] to think of it we were always his breth
[57:27] they were always his brethren is that
[57:29] right
[57:30] they were always his brethren but there
[57:32] is a relationship that is taking place
[57:35] to lead them into that place they
[57:37] wouldn't have understood brethren in in
[57:40] the time when it was the time of of
[57:42] servants they wouldn't have understood
[57:44] what brethren mean you see when words
[57:46] are spoken it lets you know the season
[57:48] and lets you know the promises that
[57:50] belongs to you and it's it's more than
[57:52] just a word it's an awakening of the
[57:55] spirit of god that awakens something
[57:59] within you he called me brethren
[58:02] what it is the word is awakening you to
[58:06] the promise and relationship
[58:09] of this hour
[58:10] yes sir
[58:12] that's why when the holy spirit could
[58:14] stop the prophet there
[58:17] in the seals and say i'm no longer going
[58:20] to call you church and listen how he
[58:21] says this i'm going to call you bride
[58:24] that you might understand it
[58:28] you see to recognize because this is not
[58:32] church
[58:33] thinking we are the bride yet to be
[58:35] called the church of the living god is
[58:38] what a great honor but it's declaring
[58:40] this is the season of the bride
[58:44] it's been the church all along but that
[58:46] there's an awareness and the spirit of
[58:48] god moves by that word i think we can
[58:50] all say clearly right here this morning
[58:53] there's a greater understanding that god
[58:55] has brought into our lives no matter how
[58:58] long we've been walking in the message
[59:00] of right now of what it means to be
[59:02] called the bride of jesus christ
[59:05] we see the effect of that word
[59:09] is that right
[59:10] and notice even how that relationship
[59:14] jesus didn't jesus was not just changing
[59:16] that relationship but there were things
[59:19] that were four seasons servant friend
[59:22] and brethren so the whole of what we
[59:24] were reading in the scripture here all
[59:27] of it speaks of relationship fathers
[59:30] well in order to be a father somebody
[59:32] you know
[59:33] they have to have then of of children to
[59:36] be a young man they're a product of a
[59:38] union children is a product of a union
[59:41] though all of these are in different
[59:44] positions in their walk or in their life
[59:48] but every one of them are right where
[59:50] they need to be
[59:52] and though think how god places this
[59:55] together god places it together to where
[59:58] that the fathers that he's wrote to in
[1:00:00] here they have understanding they've
[1:00:02] passed through certain things in their
[1:00:03] life they don't necessarily have the
[1:00:05] same stamina the same strength as the
[1:00:08] young men i'm not talking about the
[1:00:09] strength of the holy ghost i'm talking
[1:00:11] about strength in their natural body
[1:00:13] but they have but the young men have a
[1:00:15] strength but notice if you have all that
[1:00:17] strength that's there you've also got to
[1:00:19] have an understanding that goes with
[1:00:21] that
[1:00:23] and an understanding that also will
[1:00:26] display itself in humility to the lord
[1:00:29] and in humility to other things like
[1:00:31] when solomon came the mistake that
[1:00:33] solomon made and it divided the kingdom
[1:00:36] is he should have listened to the
[1:00:38] fathers
[1:00:40] but instead solomon listened to the
[1:00:43] young men the young men had a lot of
[1:00:45] zeal
[1:00:46] we're going to get things curved out
[1:00:48] here but what happened is that zeal
[1:00:51] it actually brought division
[1:00:55] so we want to have zeal but we want to
[1:00:57] have zeal according to the time
[1:00:59] according to the season according to
[1:01:01] what's called for at that moment and i
[1:01:03] can say this and i'll have both hands up
[1:01:05] god help me
[1:01:07] help every one of us to have the right
[1:01:09] zeal at the right moment at the right
[1:01:11] time
[1:01:13] we need that leadership and that's one
[1:01:15] of the parts of that a father a father
[1:01:19] begins to of the display is that a young
[1:01:22] man or a child that's coming on
[1:01:25] they can look and they can see a father
[1:01:27] one of understanding and saying my what
[1:01:29] a what a what a great man of faith what
[1:01:32] a what a great lady of faith and you
[1:01:34] know they can look and but remember ruth
[1:01:36] didn't become ruth overnight esther
[1:01:38] didn't become esther overnight rebecca
[1:01:39] didn't become rebecca overnight abraham
[1:01:41] didn't become abraham overnight
[1:01:45] but it wasn't working in their lives so
[1:01:48] i say it in this way
[1:01:50] you know i mentioned this there when i
[1:01:52] was with one of the with with the group
[1:01:54] there of the 19 year olds and up when
[1:01:56] the holy ghost has come and he sets down
[1:01:59] in your life he doesn't change you and i
[1:02:02] this is what i told them and i thank you
[1:02:03] we will all benefit from this he doesn't
[1:02:05] change you from 19 year old thinking to
[1:02:07] 50 year old thinking
[1:02:11] you see there's two parts of maturity
[1:02:13] there's a maturity in our natural life
[1:02:15] and a maturing in our spiritual life
[1:02:18] if we have the wrong expectation then
[1:02:21] we're under a confusion we're under oh
[1:02:24] things are not going as planned no no no
[1:02:26] remember brother brahma he would tell us
[1:02:27] so many things he said you can look
[1:02:29] around and things seem like this he said
[1:02:31] but everything's right on plan
[1:02:36] so there's a maturing that that that
[1:02:38] takes place
[1:02:39] by the spirit of god within our lives
[1:02:43] you know it none of those things this is
[1:02:44] why paul would have to write to timothy
[1:02:47] and speak to him and admonish him as a
[1:02:49] young man is fleeing youthful lust
[1:02:52] but following after those of faith and
[1:02:55] charity and all of those things he was
[1:02:57] giving him a direction in his life and
[1:02:59] he also said don't despise your youth in
[1:03:02] other words just to take a back seat but
[1:03:05] follow after
[1:03:06] there is examples timothy for you to
[1:03:09] follow
[1:03:11] follow after those examples
[1:03:14] and this is where for fathers and let me
[1:03:16] get back to the point that as fathers
[1:03:19] and or as young men and children i can
[1:03:21] remember and i still you know to this
[1:03:23] day i find myself it's kind of funny
[1:03:25] because i find myself in a minister's
[1:03:27] meeting and i'm looking around i'm i'm
[1:03:28] looking around i was in a i went to a
[1:03:31] ministers down to a minister's gathering
[1:03:33] we had had in kentucky some weeks ago
[1:03:35] and i went down there and i'm looking
[1:03:36] around i realized oh my lord i'm one of
[1:03:38] the oldest ones in the room here
[1:03:41] you know i'm wanting somebody older ones
[1:03:42] you know to fall back and you know
[1:03:44] taking this and standing up and you know
[1:03:46] and think i'm saying lord have mercy i'm
[1:03:48] only 46 years old you know but i'm
[1:03:50] looking around you know you're looking
[1:03:51] for somebody around you but you know
[1:03:53] sometimes the things that we look at and
[1:03:55] it is a mystery to us because the
[1:03:57] working of the holy spirit is never
[1:03:59] anything that you and i can explain if
[1:04:02] it is something we can explain then it's
[1:04:04] not the holy ghost
[1:04:06] because the bible says in these those
[1:04:09] eyes that are inward in our life that
[1:04:11] god brings faith into our hearts and
[1:04:14] those lies are anointed with the eyes
[1:04:16] have of the holy spirit that's what nick
[1:04:19] or jesus was telling nicodemus that then
[1:04:21] we understand the kingdom of god or see
[1:04:24] it it doesn't mean we understand as far
[1:04:26] as well i know everything there is to
[1:04:27] know about it that you don't know that
[1:04:29] from your birth
[1:04:31] when we're born again we don't know that
[1:04:34] oh i know everything no there's more
[1:04:36] that we see and we know as we go on and
[1:04:39] just bring it to this point you can look
[1:04:41] at someone that's been serving the lord
[1:04:44] for maybe a time and you're like wow man
[1:04:46] i i want to just move out and have faith
[1:04:49] like that that didn't come overnight
[1:04:52] it doesn't mean that we have to stand in
[1:04:53] the backseat but it means this right
[1:04:55] here what real faith is and those that
[1:04:59] life that you see
[1:05:00] that maturity real maturity is not
[1:05:03] something that's sticking its chest out
[1:05:05] but it's able to stand in humility
[1:05:08] and it's to be it's an example of a life
[1:05:11] that has come to such a place in their
[1:05:13] walk with god to realize
[1:05:15] he is here
[1:05:17] and i can do nothing on my own
[1:05:23] that's real maturity that's real
[1:05:25] understanding is i need him now that
[1:05:28] doesn't mean when we say we need him
[1:05:30] that it's just he's doing everything and
[1:05:32] i'm just you know it's like well lord
[1:05:34] you just do it and i'm over here doing
[1:05:36] this no
[1:05:37] if god's wanting to tend to this and i
[1:05:39] see this is a need then i'm going to be
[1:05:41] praying about how to care for this how
[1:05:43] to tend for it how to tend to it then
[1:05:45] he's coming down he gives me direction
[1:05:48] on how to attend to it so i must know
[1:05:52] what needs to be or alerted to the
[1:05:54] season that i'm living in
[1:05:57] bring in let the holy spirit bring it
[1:05:58] down to uh in our natural lives and our
[1:06:01] spiritual lives because right in the
[1:06:03] midst of a congregation as the words
[1:06:04] going forth god allows you and i to see
[1:06:08] just exactly in the season of our life
[1:06:11] of where you and i are at the bride is
[1:06:13] in a season as a whole a rapturing
[1:06:16] season
[1:06:17] are you with me
[1:06:18] but each and every one of us we are also
[1:06:20] in a season underneath that great season
[1:06:24] and that is all the working of the
[1:06:26] person of jesus christ
[1:06:29] and this this is where paul could write
[1:06:32] talking about this understanding and he
[1:06:34] would write in first corinthians 14 9 he
[1:06:37] says in the church i would rather speak
[1:06:40] five words with my understanding than
[1:06:43] that that by my voice i might teach
[1:06:46] others also than ten thousand words in
[1:06:49] an unknown tongue
[1:06:51] so paul's recognizing much it doesn't
[1:06:54] take much to bring a great achievement
[1:06:58] all it takes is a yieldedness and a
[1:07:01] healiness and a humility to see there's
[1:07:03] a need that's present for this moment i
[1:07:06] would rather paul says speak five words
[1:07:08] paul's recognizing this isn't about me
[1:07:10] it's about the body and that's what the
[1:07:13] holy spirit brings out in our life
[1:07:15] that's the maturing of the spirit of god
[1:07:17] in our lives look at what it did in our
[1:07:18] natural life
[1:07:20] look at how the curbing out in our
[1:07:21] natural life even as we grow it should
[1:07:24] be this way even in our natural life if
[1:07:27] we are pulling away from from a
[1:07:29] selfishness and that's the same way it
[1:07:31] works in our life spiritually he's he's
[1:07:34] god comes in to give us sufficient grace
[1:07:38] to deliver us from our own selves
[1:07:43] not just once but paul said i die
[1:07:46] daily
[1:07:48] jesus said carry the cross
[1:07:50] daily
[1:07:52] brethren be not children in
[1:07:54] understanding how be it in
[1:07:57] malice
[1:08:00] be your children
[1:08:02] be and understand to be men so if
[1:08:04] there's anywhere we want to be in the
[1:08:05] high chair it's when it comes to malice
[1:08:09] we might look awful funny being big
[1:08:10] people in a high chair
[1:08:12] or maybe they can make them our size but
[1:08:15] we that's what we want to be we want to
[1:08:16] be children because you see malice
[1:08:18] cannot exist
[1:08:20] when you look among children you can
[1:08:22] have children that you know they
[1:08:23] disagree but you give them time they're
[1:08:25] out there playing and everything else i
[1:08:27] mean unless the parents foster division
[1:08:31] somebody with greater knowledge can
[1:08:33] foster these things and no we don't play
[1:08:35] with them we don't
[1:08:37] but but if children are left to
[1:08:39] themselves you'll find them and it's
[1:08:42] it's like what happened because there
[1:08:44] are children in that part there's things
[1:08:47] that they see that you and i can say oh
[1:08:49] when they grow up they won't be playing
[1:08:50] so much but you see there's a part of it
[1:08:53] that they see the value of i want to go
[1:08:56] play kickball i want to go play with
[1:08:58] this child and what right now i'm
[1:09:00] feeling or this scuffle we had or this
[1:09:02] words that ain't worth it i want to go
[1:09:04] play
[1:09:05] and that's what paul is bringing to you
[1:09:07] and i the oh god help us to be children
[1:09:10] and you say how can we be children well
[1:09:12] it's not a light switch but it's staying
[1:09:14] in the presence of our father
[1:09:16] and we recognize i am his child and he
[1:09:20] is my heavenly father
[1:09:23] you see these are things it's not just
[1:09:25] that all of a sudden well i have the
[1:09:26] holy spirit and light switches going on
[1:09:28] it's staying in the presence of almighty
[1:09:31] god remembering i am his child and he's
[1:09:34] my father
[1:09:35] we want to be men of understanding we
[1:09:38] want to be hearts and lives of
[1:09:40] understanding the bible says in first
[1:09:42] chronicles 12 32 that the children of
[1:09:44] issachar now this is when the tribes
[1:09:46] were coming to turn the kingdom
[1:09:49] to
[1:09:49] from saul unto david and remember they
[1:09:53] here they were as refuge uh
[1:09:56] refugees in that time they were outcasts
[1:09:58] but the bible says regarding the
[1:10:00] children of issachar which were men that
[1:10:03] had uh understanding of the times that's
[1:10:06] first chronicles 12 32 men that had
[1:10:08] understanding of the times to know what
[1:10:11] israel ought to do
[1:10:14] now
[1:10:15] when you read this and as a bible reader
[1:10:17] you'll know
[1:10:18] all the way through there you have
[1:10:20] different tribes that are mentioned of
[1:10:21] one's an expert to war one was was
[1:10:24] expert in bowls and you know and knives
[1:10:27] and all that right there and all of
[1:10:28] that's needed right it's all needed but
[1:10:31] god is pointing out this was very
[1:10:34] necessary because where all of these
[1:10:36] other parts were needed for battle
[1:10:39] for taking possession for defending what
[1:10:42] rightfully belonged to israel there also
[1:10:45] had to be men within the midst of all of
[1:10:48] that there had to be a character that
[1:10:51] would be able to handle that power
[1:10:55] and it would be men of understanding of
[1:10:58] the times in other words we've come to a
[1:11:00] spot that david we've been running we've
[1:11:04] now gathered at hebron and hebron is the
[1:11:07] place of the fathers we have been
[1:11:10] gathered here it's time to anoint david
[1:11:13] king
[1:11:14] and i'd say in this hour as fathers as
[1:11:17] husbands as every every child of god in
[1:11:20] here i think it's time that we can say
[1:11:22] god knew we would need understanding in
[1:11:24] this time daniel said understanding
[1:11:27] would be released when the seals were
[1:11:29] tore off the understanding would come he
[1:11:32] would come to hearts and lives to say
[1:11:34] we're living in a time it's time to
[1:11:36] anoint david king in other words it's
[1:11:38] time to receive this word that has come
[1:11:41] to us in power and glory and
[1:11:43] demonstration as the mighty conqueror
[1:11:46] and let it be king in other words every
[1:11:48] idea that i have let it be cast out and
[1:11:51] let the king
[1:11:52] reveal and his splendor and his glory in
[1:11:55] my life in my home in my marriage in all
[1:11:58] my relationships let the king of glory
[1:12:01] declare himself men understanding the
[1:12:03] times
[1:12:07] psalms 133 verse 1 david said behold how
[1:12:10] good and how pleasant it is for brethren
[1:12:12] to dwell together in unity in unity a
[1:12:15] wonderful thing
[1:12:17] now you know how unity comes don't you
[1:12:21] everybody's got to think like i think
[1:12:24] is that right
[1:12:25] i mean we're going to be in unity
[1:12:26] everybody's got to order their steak
[1:12:27] medium
[1:12:29] medium rare baked potato and getting you
[1:12:31] hungry now ain't no
[1:12:34] i mean everybody's got to think like i
[1:12:35] think you know one of the most glorious
[1:12:37] revelations is when you realize god
[1:12:39] didn't call you to change nobody else
[1:12:43] god has everybody has their own
[1:12:46] temperament and your temperament is not
[1:12:48] a sin
[1:12:51] are you with me remember them guys
[1:12:52] sitting down at the end of the holiday
[1:12:54] brothers they were pop popping them
[1:12:55] squirrels off pop
[1:12:57] glory got another one brother brahms up
[1:12:59] the holler sportsman's holler
[1:13:01] and he puts his gun down against the
[1:13:02] tree and he starts crying
[1:13:04] he hears them having a good time down
[1:13:06] there why am i this way
[1:13:09] why am i this way you see he was wanting
[1:13:10] delivered from something that god
[1:13:13] fearfully and wonderfully made and put
[1:13:14] there
[1:13:16] what can i why why can't i why is it i
[1:13:18] got to be so tortured but i can't hit
[1:13:19] him in the eye i mean i've been happy to
[1:13:21] be just hitting you know and kill him
[1:13:22] you know
[1:13:24] but you see here's what the spirit of
[1:13:25] god said i made you that way for a
[1:13:29] purpose
[1:13:30] you see one of the greatest revelations
[1:13:32] that we can realize god doesn't want us
[1:13:34] in our temperament our disposition to
[1:13:37] change brother braham says if you things
[1:13:39] that are to be if you would have judged
[1:13:41] james by peter you'd have kicked peter
[1:13:43] out
[1:13:45] because peter was much different than
[1:13:47] james or andrew you you know what i'm
[1:13:48] where i'm going with this that it's the
[1:13:51] holy spirit brother brandon places it
[1:13:52] very clearly and why people are so
[1:13:54] tossed about he comes down in the center
[1:13:56] of your temperament
[1:13:58] to direct it i'm glad about that aren't
[1:14:01] you
[1:14:02] god knows what he's doing
[1:14:04] and when we look at that that even comes
[1:14:06] into our children and what we have here
[1:14:08] in the assembly god has never called me
[1:14:11] that you know i'll pick on brother joe
[1:14:12] here a little bit god never called me
[1:14:14] the man i've got to change brother joy's
[1:14:16] makeup or how he looks that god is not
[1:14:18] if i think that i'm going to waste my
[1:14:20] time
[1:14:21] i mean nothing bill joy you understand
[1:14:23] what i'm saying and so why am i going
[1:14:25] i'm fine listen to me i'm fighting
[1:14:28] against god
[1:14:31] because david received the revelation
[1:14:34] how marvelous are thy thoughts to me
[1:14:38] i am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:14:41] now that applies not only within the
[1:14:42] assembly and it's a paradox how god sets
[1:14:45] us all together
[1:14:47] right
[1:14:49] some of us are punctual pete and some of
[1:14:51] us are
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] not sin
[1:14:56] it's not sin
[1:14:57] are you hearing me now i know sometimes
[1:14:59] we we like to put things in as as
[1:15:01] rankings and but it's not it's reality
[1:15:04] sometimes we have to understand the part
[1:15:05] of where we're made up but listen
[1:15:07] friends you say what are you saying that
[1:15:08] brother say well why he's saying it is
[1:15:10] so that it's not our idea that's exalted
[1:15:13] it's jesus christ who's exalted in our
[1:15:16] midst
[1:15:18] when the greek said they never came to
[1:15:19] them and said show us your idea tell us
[1:15:22] your idea they said sirs we would see
[1:15:25] jesus
[1:15:28] right
[1:15:29] when philip was there with him he said
[1:15:30] show us the father he said how long i've
[1:15:32] been with you he said show us the father
[1:15:35] it suffice it he said when you have seen
[1:15:37] me you have seen the father in other
[1:15:39] words he brought it from being something
[1:15:40] way out here so mysterious so distant he
[1:15:44] brought it down to a place is that god
[1:15:46] has been walking right here it's god
[1:15:49] that you've been fellowshipping with
[1:15:51] it's god that's been touching your life
[1:15:53] it's god that's been providing for you
[1:15:55] loaves and bread and every it's god
[1:15:57] that's been doing this it's god in
[1:16:00] simplicity working through
[1:16:02] human temples
[1:16:05] how pleasant it is for brethren to do
[1:16:06] all together in unity
[1:16:10] right it's all give and take i mean in
[1:16:12] order for us you know to
[1:16:14] dwell in unity
[1:16:16] everyone not just somebody
[1:16:18] everybody has to forsake their own
[1:16:20] opinions and ideas
[1:16:23] right
[1:16:24] in order to do that
[1:16:26] in order to have a unity because we
[1:16:28] could come into the service what if we
[1:16:29] allowed our opinions in coming into the
[1:16:31] service and then those opinions you
[1:16:32] would say well i'll tell you what if
[1:16:34] they would have done this and boy they
[1:16:35] should have only had the you know only
[1:16:37] had two specials right now today and it
[1:16:40] wasn't the two specials that threw the
[1:16:42] service out of whack it was your
[1:16:44] attitude
[1:16:46] because god will allow things to come
[1:16:48] our pathway to see are we
[1:16:51] fathers in this or not
[1:16:56] what are we going to do in the midst of
[1:16:58] this situation
[1:17:00] you see so sometimes the unity it's just
[1:17:02] like look at times when i go and
[1:17:04] minister places
[1:17:05] and you know i've been in meetings
[1:17:07] sometimes and now the song service can
[1:17:09] go an hour
[1:17:10] i know when it goes an hour and just
[1:17:12] trying to get out there and get a feel
[1:17:13] of the people i know whether or not
[1:17:16] how much within that service then maybe
[1:17:19] it's going to have to drop now sometimes
[1:17:20] in special meetings there's a lot more
[1:17:22] grace that's given there people are able
[1:17:23] to endure a little bit more i understand
[1:17:25] it's not about enduring but i think you
[1:17:27] get what i'm talking about what if we
[1:17:29] stopped in a place and you just said it
[1:17:31] ain't going you know what they sang that
[1:17:32] song right there and his drum beat was
[1:17:34] off and this and that oh lord have mercy
[1:17:36] man what a service that would be what an
[1:17:39] atmosphere
[1:17:41] right
[1:17:43] so sometimes we let little things that
[1:17:45] mean a lot to us
[1:17:47] hinder us satan gets in there and
[1:17:50] hinders us for the rest of the service
[1:17:53] you can't blame it on anybody else my
[1:17:55] goodness
[1:17:58] you can't this is where as fathers this
[1:18:00] is where we want to be people of
[1:18:02] understanding and i don't i think with
[1:18:04] understanding i'm not too big to ask god
[1:18:06] help me lord jesus
[1:18:12] when that one's in the philippines and
[1:18:14] they finally came and got man service
[1:18:15] that song sure has been well over an
[1:18:17] hour maybe hour and a half and for the
[1:18:18] row and then they're apologizing to us
[1:18:20] hey when in rome we do is wrong
[1:18:24] you know hey we just we just roll with
[1:18:25] it this is this is normal this is
[1:18:27] expectation so what did you do brother
[1:18:29] samuel i got out there and sung a song
[1:18:31] [Laughter]
[1:18:34] hey everybody so here to dwell together
[1:18:36] in unity verse two my it's like the
[1:18:38] precious ointment up on the head notice
[1:18:41] notice i want you to see this here it's
[1:18:43] like the precious ointment upon the head
[1:18:47] that ran down
[1:18:49] upon the beard
[1:18:50] even aaron's beard that went down
[1:18:54] to the skirts
[1:18:56] of his garments
[1:18:57] maybe to try to put a visual here
[1:18:59] if this was there's much there's a
[1:19:01] different consistency between water
[1:19:04] and syrup
[1:19:06] now you know i used to think syrup
[1:19:09] was that stuff that come in mrs
[1:19:10] butterworth's bottle
[1:19:12] my aunt mama
[1:19:14] i thought that was sir
[1:19:17] that was a fake
[1:19:20] now i don't mean to tear down no
[1:19:22] companies but you know i really i didn't
[1:19:24] know what maple syrup really was when
[1:19:26] you get maple syrup it's almost like
[1:19:28] water
[1:19:31] i thought no wonder i really never cared
[1:19:32] for mrs butterworth and all that stuff
[1:19:36] but i'm running at a point here
[1:19:40] the consistency how notice the precious
[1:19:43] ointment moving notice it wasn't just
[1:19:45] something that just
[1:19:50] david was able to capture how unity
[1:19:53] moves
[1:19:55] unity begins with the head
[1:19:59] unity begins with the head
[1:20:01] and unity flowing down
[1:20:04] into the body
[1:20:07] not fast
[1:20:09] you know sometimes we want to see fast
[1:20:10] change glory to god hallelujah oh fast
[1:20:13] change
[1:20:14] dope open it up microwave or we hate
[1:20:16] microblading way food but we try to
[1:20:17] microwave our children microwave
[1:20:19] husbands wives and everything we're
[1:20:21] going they're instant
[1:20:28] i mean we first got a microwave and dad
[1:20:30] got all into that oh man cakes in the
[1:20:33] microwave nastiest stuff in the world
[1:20:36] he about root me on scrambled eggs and
[1:20:38] making scrambled eggs in the microwave
[1:20:40] then things had butter on all you had to
[1:20:42] do was put them in your mouth and go
[1:20:43] like this and it was
[1:20:46] it wasn't natural
[1:20:48] you got to be in a skillet man
[1:20:52] but i'm making a point that the working
[1:20:54] of the holy spirit by unity is that
[1:20:57] which moves from the head down
[1:21:00] it moves down through every detail in
[1:21:03] your home in your life and you say
[1:21:06] brother samuel i need it to get down
[1:21:07] here just stand still and let the holy
[1:21:10] spirit do the work he knows where he's
[1:21:13] got to get to you don't have to guide
[1:21:15] him you don't have to take the holy
[1:21:17] spirit by the hand he knows exactly
[1:21:19] where to get to he knows every bedroom
[1:21:21] every heart of your children your wife
[1:21:23] your husband he knows how to get there
[1:21:25] he doesn't need my help
[1:21:32] well brother samuel glory to god what
[1:21:34] does that have to do with unity i'm
[1:21:36] getting somewhere here
[1:21:38] as the dew notice here's how it is
[1:21:41] it's as the due of hermit don't worry
[1:21:43] that coke going off don't mean it's
[1:21:44] going to be 50 more minutes
[1:21:47] as the dude notice this is how it is as
[1:21:49] the dew of hermann
[1:21:52] and as the dew that descended upon the
[1:21:54] mountains of zion how many of you ever
[1:21:56] heard the dewfall
[1:21:59] you heard the dew fall
[1:22:01] no you did
[1:22:04] that was bad that was probably a trick
[1:22:05] question
[1:22:07] i fought in them tried failing those
[1:22:08] trick questions many times so nobody
[1:22:10] heard the dewfall
[1:22:12] right you know god says that's a nice
[1:22:14] dude tonight boy
[1:22:16] that's a nice dude i mean eventually
[1:22:18] when you walk in the grass if you're up
[1:22:20] at a certain time or early in the
[1:22:22] morning
[1:22:22] you catch you're like wow this is a
[1:22:24] thick dew this morning
[1:22:26] in the fall
[1:22:28] wonderful in the fall when it frosts
[1:22:29] like that for a lot of reasons but
[1:22:32] that dew you don't hear it coming down
[1:22:34] it comes down in stillness
[1:22:38] and that's god's promise
[1:22:41] of the covenant to the children of
[1:22:43] abraham i will give you
[1:22:45] the dew
[1:22:47] of heaven
[1:22:48] because there are going to be dry times
[1:22:51] and it's not going to rain but my do
[1:22:54] shall descend
[1:22:58] it'll be the work of almighty god in the
[1:23:01] time of the silence and the dew will
[1:23:03] produce
[1:23:05] the dew will produce
[1:23:08] you you don't hear it where it's coming
[1:23:10] from you don't see it when it's coming
[1:23:12] but there's a confidence this is part of
[1:23:14] the covenant that if i can just be in
[1:23:16] that place of unity you say brother
[1:23:18] samuel i need to do but this is the
[1:23:20] qualifications be together in unity and
[1:23:23] when we're together in unity then the
[1:23:25] dew comes down
[1:23:28] and this is where the bible says and
[1:23:30] therefore the lord commanded the
[1:23:31] blessing even life forevermore
[1:23:34] sometimes we're trying to get things
[1:23:35] backwards we're praying we're asking god
[1:23:38] i need this god we need this god we need
[1:23:40] this god we need this
[1:23:42] and we're praying
[1:23:44] this isn't putting nobody down that's
[1:23:45] not i'm included here with this it's us
[1:23:48] understanding you the dew doesn't come
[1:23:52] when we're all tore up
[1:23:55] the do comes
[1:23:57] in the stillness
[1:23:59] of the
[1:24:00] night
[1:24:02] be still and
[1:24:04] know that i'm god
[1:24:06] it's when his presence come in and
[1:24:08] brother braham says that's that moment
[1:24:10] of refreshing back in the holiest of
[1:24:12] homes
[1:24:13] he says it's those times he said that we
[1:24:15] get so
[1:24:16] with our lives he said and we just have
[1:24:18] to get alone in prayer
[1:24:20] not that let me say this not that we
[1:24:22] don't pray
[1:24:24] but we don't make prayer tradition
[1:24:27] in other words clock in at three o'clock
[1:24:29] out at four come on our lives are so
[1:24:31] used to time frames
[1:24:33] but prayer itself is not confined just
[1:24:36] to the position of your body
[1:24:39] it's the prostrating of our heart to god
[1:24:44] you can pray how could a man pray
[1:24:46] without ceasing
[1:24:49] because you're in fellowship with god
[1:24:52] lord i love you lord jesus
[1:24:54] lord i'm going into work today i invite
[1:24:56] you lord would you
[1:24:58] go into work with me lord i don't know
[1:25:00] what i feel this is a great day i'm
[1:25:02] thankful for the sun it's a beautiful
[1:25:04] day maybe pick up brother brian's lines
[1:25:05] it's wonderful but lord i need you today
[1:25:09] would you just come and let's have
[1:25:10] fellowship today lord i want to draw
[1:25:13] closer why i'm here this job you've
[1:25:15] given me talents you've given me i want
[1:25:17] to draw closer to you lord
[1:25:19] that's inviting him it's inviting the
[1:25:21] dew of hermann
[1:25:23] that which falls upon mount zion
[1:25:26] mountains of zion and all of this here
[1:25:28] notice
[1:25:29] as it speaks in the scripture here on
[1:25:30] the mountains of zion if this is not
[1:25:32] speaking of mount zion which would be
[1:25:34] jerusalem it's speaking of the mountains
[1:25:37] that surround it
[1:25:39] see we are called to mount zion which
[1:25:41] mount zion is what
[1:25:43] it's that of the word the holy spirit in
[1:25:46] the lives of his people
[1:25:47] but outside when we when we leave we're
[1:25:50] outside of
[1:25:52] of church
[1:25:53] it's mountains of zion you're on a
[1:25:55] mountain of zion you're on a mountain of
[1:25:57] zion and what does it do you need that
[1:25:59] elevation this is where the dew comes
[1:26:02] down
[1:26:03] in a dry
[1:26:05] dry region
[1:26:06] yet the dew comes to give necessary
[1:26:09] moisture
[1:26:10] for life to come forth
[1:26:15] so unity unity is very very very
[1:26:18] critical even in all of our lives
[1:26:20] remember when brother branham walked
[1:26:22] into
[1:26:23] his home and everything was tore up
[1:26:26] brother branham never walked in there
[1:26:27] and started giving orders
[1:26:28] hey stop this hey stop that hey come on
[1:26:30] now come on get away from that get it
[1:26:33] it was an example that was shown to us
[1:26:37] right
[1:26:39] you took dominion
[1:26:41] and how do you first take dominion by
[1:26:42] first allowing the holy spirit to have
[1:26:44] dominion here
[1:26:46] and recognizing that you know what if i
[1:26:48] go on this on my own it's going to be a
[1:26:49] big mess
[1:26:51] right have a certain way we're going to
[1:26:53] feel about it but
[1:26:56] how god comes and gives us grace to
[1:26:58] direct that and notice the simple way
[1:27:00] that brother branham took that began to
[1:27:02] help washing dishes begin to talk to his
[1:27:04] wife an atmosphere came think of this
[1:27:08] brother brandon went in the living room
[1:27:09] with the children
[1:27:11] he came in there next to his wife
[1:27:14] and he put on the apron
[1:27:20] one of the first times that brother gerd
[1:27:21] wrote a wallet seen brother branham was
[1:27:23] wearing an apron washing dishes and it
[1:27:25] blew him away
[1:27:26] he went over this house i'm here
[1:27:28] thinking a prophet of god stepping out
[1:27:30] with the commandments of god here's a
[1:27:32] prophet of god stepping out with an
[1:27:33] apron god bless you brother gerst
[1:27:37] oh that ain't manly according to whose
[1:27:39] definition
[1:27:41] according to whose definition see we
[1:27:42] talk so much about what we're not of the
[1:27:44] world you realize the world itself
[1:27:47] permeates very slowly
[1:27:51] we got this thing listen you can be
[1:27:53] manly and wash dishes
[1:27:56] and sweep the carpet in other words to
[1:27:58] help out
[1:28:00] right it's all together to help out
[1:28:03] oh my i don't know where this is going
[1:28:05] but you understand notice what happened
[1:28:07] that atmosphere changed it was tight in
[1:28:10] that place
[1:28:12] right brother brahm didn't say here let
[1:28:14] me read you some quotes and let me read
[1:28:15] some scripture rebuke your one side
[1:28:16] rebuke you down the other tell you how
[1:28:18] you must be intact oh you shouldn't be
[1:28:19] that you're a daughter of god you
[1:28:20] shouldn't be yeah
[1:28:22] that would have done a lot of good
[1:28:26] a men of understanding
[1:28:31] and what happened
[1:28:32] a change of an atmosphere brother brown
[1:28:34] says the kids stopped arguing
[1:28:37] they started getting together and
[1:28:38] started playing
[1:28:40] man that make any parent have a praise
[1:28:42] break right there
[1:28:45] you know you need to be older you need
[1:28:46] to act order you need to grow
[1:28:49] we we have all of these directions and
[1:28:51] listen friends the holy spirit is not
[1:28:53] telling us this morning that all of a
[1:28:54] sudden here we we come out of these
[1:28:56] things oh i hear this and man now i'm
[1:28:58] going to be the perfect parent he's the
[1:28:59] perfect parent
[1:29:02] there's not one of us in here that are
[1:29:03] the perfect parent
[1:29:05] but thank god for his word that comes to
[1:29:07] remind us of the channels and direction
[1:29:09] in our life so we can yield to him
[1:29:15] and if anybody feels like they're the
[1:29:16] perfect parent you can come forward
[1:29:18] we'll cast that prideful devil and that
[1:29:20] lying spirit off of you
[1:29:24] now i want you just to ch just to catch
[1:29:26] this here just to uh just a moment here
[1:29:29] brother branham is talking about because
[1:29:31] sometimes we we are looking at things
[1:29:33] uh i hope the lord will just help me to
[1:29:35] bring this together as it just so
[1:29:38] just just just dealing with my heart
[1:29:41] you know
[1:29:42] we're looking sometimes at trying to
[1:29:44] make things or things
[1:29:46] transpire or things happen even in our
[1:29:49] homes
[1:29:50] and we can't even make things change in
[1:29:52] our own lives
[1:29:54] we can't do that now
[1:29:56] this is where brother branham makes this
[1:29:58] statement in the message show us the
[1:29:59] father i love this
[1:30:01] he says
[1:30:03] you don't try to go to a seminary and
[1:30:05] get this indoctrinated bombing embalming
[1:30:08] fluid put into you or some social creed
[1:30:11] because it's not life
[1:30:13] right think of the term relationship
[1:30:15] okay
[1:30:16] the thing you want is the baptism of the
[1:30:18] holy spirit the incarnate power of god
[1:30:20] dwelling in you that accepts this word
[1:30:23] notice that accepts this word and makes
[1:30:27] it live out as it really is
[1:30:30] that's what he does that's what the
[1:30:31] person of christ does
[1:30:33] coming to our lives
[1:30:35] it's him taking the word
[1:30:38] and bringing then the word coming to
[1:30:40] pass in our life
[1:30:42] all the way through
[1:30:45] you see this is where we stand as men of
[1:30:48] issachar
[1:30:49] children of god in this hour
[1:30:51] understanding
[1:30:52] he's king of my life
[1:30:55] he's the king of this throne of my
[1:30:56] thoughts he's the king he's above the
[1:30:59] thoughts that even i think of myself
[1:31:01] because if he is above that then what if
[1:31:04] i put him above it then what happens it
[1:31:06] flows down
[1:31:09] it's removing all of those things that
[1:31:12] even that you know can come into mind
[1:31:14] that could come into our mind we place
[1:31:16] him
[1:31:17] as the king in our life
[1:31:21] is that all right
[1:31:22] so then i love this brother brahm says
[1:31:24] you know he says
[1:31:25] that little orange tree takes the
[1:31:27] simplicity of showing us the father that
[1:31:28] little orange tree says when you plant
[1:31:30] it maybe when you get it it's a little
[1:31:32] sprig about so big
[1:31:34] anybody ever seen them little trees that
[1:31:36] give you like an arbor day
[1:31:38] what do you do give them away they're
[1:31:39] too small
[1:31:41] but they're you know you look and
[1:31:42] they're so small right and you look at
[1:31:44] some of them you're like
[1:31:45] uh how long does it take to grow
[1:31:47] uh by the time you're in
[1:31:50] you're like no i won't even see it i
[1:31:52] won't even live here
[1:31:53] but you don't understand it starts out
[1:31:55] like a little spring but let's get to
[1:31:56] the point it starts out a little spring
[1:31:57] it says you plan it see see how my my
[1:32:00] human way of looking at i want something
[1:32:02] to grow i i want to be able to see it i
[1:32:04] want to be able to enjoy it but you
[1:32:05] planning out something that starts real
[1:32:06] small
[1:32:08] okay
[1:32:09] that's all
[1:32:11] that you have to do to it
[1:32:14] is plan it
[1:32:17] you don't have to go out and say now
[1:32:19] i've got to get me some oranges
[1:32:21] somewhere and you go to dumping into it
[1:32:24] the oranges
[1:32:25] is already
[1:32:27] in it
[1:32:29] it's like this it's already in it
[1:32:32] the only thing that little tree has to
[1:32:34] do
[1:32:34] is you have to keep plenty of water on
[1:32:37] it
[1:32:39] right
[1:32:40] how many of you know when you plant
[1:32:41] something you better water it
[1:32:44] and you don't water it like when we had
[1:32:46] planted trees some years ago you don't
[1:32:48] water the guys came out and they say hey
[1:32:50] don't be watering this every day you
[1:32:52] water it to you water it every every
[1:32:55] third day
[1:32:57] and about five minutes but don't do no
[1:32:59] gusher on it
[1:33:01] why because the gusher just runs off
[1:33:03] put it put a put a drip on it it was a
[1:33:06] lady that really helped me a lot she
[1:33:08] said get a five-gallon bucket and drill
[1:33:10] a hole in it like that and put the
[1:33:12] bucket near the plant fill the fill the
[1:33:14] bucket up and that little it the water
[1:33:16] will go down real slow but it goes down
[1:33:17] to the roots training the roots go deep
[1:33:20] for water
[1:33:22] because if you just
[1:33:24] oh i watered the tree
[1:33:27] it runs off and what it does it trains
[1:33:29] the roots come up because water's only
[1:33:31] on the surface
[1:33:36] if you allow it's slowness what are the
[1:33:38] slowness as you're giving it water it's
[1:33:40] also teaching it go deep
[1:33:42] go deep go deeper go deeper go deeper
[1:33:44] maya we can preach on that one
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:47] the only thing that little tree has to
[1:33:49] do you have to keep plenty of water on
[1:33:51] it
[1:33:52] then the only thing the tree has to do
[1:33:54] is drink and it drinks and it drinks it
[1:33:55] drinks over its amount
[1:33:57] as it drinks it pushes out limbs pushes
[1:33:59] out leaves
[1:34:00] drinks more pushes out blossom
[1:34:02] drinks more it pushes out oranges just
[1:34:05] drink push drink and push and that
[1:34:08] said that's all you have to do
[1:34:10] when we are planted together in christ
[1:34:12] the only thing we have to do is drink
[1:34:13] from his promise
[1:34:16] you see
[1:34:17] drinking from his promise is not only
[1:34:19] when i'm in the word listening to the
[1:34:20] word but you realize drinking from his
[1:34:22] promise watering it is also saying thank
[1:34:25] you lord
[1:34:27] thank you for your mercy lord
[1:34:29] thank you for your grace lord another
[1:34:31] week another day lord
[1:34:33] father you're the lord of my life it's
[1:34:34] it's staying in
[1:34:36] fellowship with him
[1:34:39] it's talking with him he's right there
[1:34:40] with us
[1:34:42] when when you have something going on
[1:34:45] invite him you say well sam i believe
[1:34:47] he's with me but just
[1:34:49] just be real purposeful with it lord
[1:34:51] jesus will you sit down right here right
[1:34:52] next to me
[1:34:55] oh
[1:34:57] brother samuel that's that's real simple
[1:35:00] i know it is
[1:35:02] but
[1:35:03] remember this is a relationship
[1:35:06] this is not a god who's far off
[1:35:09] it is not one who came down who came
[1:35:12] with an sd card and said here
[1:35:14] we're going to let you download the
[1:35:16] commandments and you give that back to
[1:35:18] me because i'm going to take somebody
[1:35:19] else and download it there but he came
[1:35:21] down and he said
[1:35:22] i am the word
[1:35:25] i've come right here to be
[1:35:26] a display and also to affect your life
[1:35:31] i tell you i'd rather i'd rather have
[1:35:33] him sitting right by me
[1:35:35] i'd rather invite him and say lord you
[1:35:37] lead me today
[1:35:38] you direct me today
[1:35:40] every time when i take the pulpit even
[1:35:42] when i'm studying when i'm studying and
[1:35:44] the inspiration i can the sense that
[1:35:46] inspiration is moving right in at that
[1:35:47] moment and i said lord now you direct me
[1:35:50] lord for your children
[1:35:52] you guide me lord you know you know the
[1:35:54] needs that are going to be present
[1:35:56] guide me lord
[1:35:58] i all i want to do is get into that
[1:35:59] channel of inspiration and follow that
[1:36:02] so as we were planted in christ the only
[1:36:04] thing we have to do is drink from his
[1:36:06] promise and push out i love that the
[1:36:08] only thing we have to do is drink
[1:36:10] and push out
[1:36:12] that's it everything that you have need
[1:36:14] of is in you when you receive christ
[1:36:16] because christ is in you
[1:36:18] and you just have to drink from his word
[1:36:20] his life and push out
[1:36:22] that's all we have to do
[1:36:24] and what does that do that's showing the
[1:36:26] father
[1:36:29] for his life it's his life that's coming
[1:36:31] forth
[1:36:32] leaves
[1:36:34] the growth of the tree oranges that are
[1:36:36] coming from in from forth in our lives
[1:36:42] hallelujah
[1:36:43] in the message here let me in the
[1:36:44] scriptures let me read galatians chapter
[1:36:46] 2
[1:36:47] and then i'm just going to come down
[1:36:49] from here
[1:36:51] because there's no way i can keep on
[1:36:52] going with this to make it make the
[1:36:54] point
[1:36:54] in galatians 2 20
[1:36:57] paul would write i am crucified with
[1:36:59] christ
[1:37:01] now i want you to catch this here
[1:37:03] paul never says i was
[1:37:06] i am
[1:37:08] ongoing
[1:37:12] not i was
[1:37:13] i am ongoing
[1:37:15] i'm crucified
[1:37:17] with christ
[1:37:20] nevertheless
[1:37:22] i live
[1:37:24] yet not i but christ
[1:37:27] liveth in me
[1:37:30] and the life which i now live in the
[1:37:34] flesh
[1:37:35] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:37:39] who loved me
[1:37:40] and gave himself for me
[1:37:42] what a glorious revelation
[1:37:45] when when we're living not by our
[1:37:48] strength
[1:37:50] we are living by
[1:37:52] the strength and reality
[1:37:55] of the relationship of the lord jesus
[1:37:57] christ
[1:37:59] that he
[1:38:00] gave himself for me
[1:38:04] he did it for you brother joy
[1:38:07] bill he did it for you
[1:38:09] and i'm living now see it's one one
[1:38:11] thing to say he did it but then has you
[1:38:14] be as you accept that and you don't
[1:38:16] accept it
[1:38:17] by works
[1:38:21] that's not accepting it you're trying to
[1:38:22] earn it
[1:38:24] how do you accept it you accept what he
[1:38:26] did for you he's the one that has come
[1:38:29] to our life dealt with our heart
[1:38:32] his love has spoken to our life
[1:38:34] so what is it that is taking place it's
[1:38:37] himself he's revealing himself to you
[1:38:40] and i the work of calvary
[1:38:43] and what is the work of calvary it's to
[1:38:45] bring
[1:38:46] relationship
[1:38:49] i'm not living paul said by my faith i'm
[1:38:52] living by
[1:38:54] the faith of the son of god
[1:38:57] i'm living by that faith
[1:39:00] of the one who loved me
[1:39:03] and gave himself for me
[1:39:05] you understand that relationship that
[1:39:08] reality when we understand that and oh
[1:39:11] god help us to so live within that
[1:39:15] that it's it's his working in our life
[1:39:19] brethren how pleasant it is to dwell
[1:39:21] together in unity resting in him
[1:39:25] who's begun to work he's performing it
[1:39:28] until the day of jesus christ
[1:39:30] in our homes in our families it's
[1:39:33] resting in this reality that i'm not
[1:39:35] living i'm not living by
[1:39:39] my works there's things that god calls
[1:39:41] us to do like i said we see the time we
[1:39:44] need to be moving in this and we're
[1:39:45] asking god to give us direction in
[1:39:48] seeing the need but we realize it's not
[1:39:50] me or you acting apart from god
[1:39:53] relationship has come to where we can
[1:39:56] say
[1:39:57] as jesus said
[1:39:59] that whatsoever the son seeth the father
[1:40:02] doing that doeth the son likewise
[1:40:04] there's a relationship we're not acting
[1:40:07] on our own
[1:40:08] we're acting under his influence his
[1:40:11] direction his love
[1:40:13] and his care in our lives
[1:40:16] i do not verse 21 i do not frustrate the
[1:40:19] grace of god in other words bring
[1:40:20] confusion to it for if righteousness
[1:40:23] come by the law
[1:40:25] then christ
[1:40:26] is dead in vain
[1:40:31] paul putting it very clearly to
[1:40:35] the body of believers here
[1:40:39] that this
[1:40:40] life because remember there were those
[1:40:42] who had come in back into
[1:40:44] the galatian church
[1:40:46] trying to turn the people back to
[1:40:48] self-efforts
[1:40:49] self-reformation
[1:40:51] instead of resting
[1:40:54] on the person of jesus christ
[1:40:57] paul's letting him know
[1:40:58] why are you going back to something that
[1:41:00] takes that's taking away from
[1:41:02] relationship
[1:41:03] relationship is here
[1:41:06] the lord he made a way for complete
[1:41:09] relationship
[1:41:11] and see these are the things as it comes
[1:41:12] down as it moves down even into our
[1:41:15] homes and into our lives we recognize
[1:41:17] that the greatest thing
[1:41:21] is that that god brings forth
[1:41:23] relationship in our life
[1:41:26] now let me just drop these little
[1:41:27] statements for you and i'm not going to
[1:41:28] preach on them today
[1:41:30] release relationship
[1:41:32] without boundaries and standards
[1:41:36] is confusion
[1:41:39] are you hearing me
[1:41:40] grace has come to us but it isn't grace
[1:41:42] you just do whatever you want
[1:41:44] god loves you you know what that brings
[1:41:47] right
[1:41:49] grace
[1:41:50] god spoke to titus and what how did i
[1:41:53] love how the spirit of god brings it
[1:41:54] through titus the grace of god come
[1:41:57] teaching us
[1:41:59] corrects us
[1:42:01] gracious and say ah
[1:42:03] you're a good boy you're good girl
[1:42:05] everything's good man praise the lord
[1:42:07] you
[1:42:08] you know better they come of your genes
[1:42:10] they come of my genes you know what's in
[1:42:11] our genes
[1:42:13] and i'm not talking about levi's either
[1:42:15] i'm talking about the genes of of our
[1:42:17] makeup
[1:42:18] right
[1:42:19] and that's why you can look at certain
[1:42:20] things your life you say they need the
[1:42:21] holy ghost
[1:42:23] they're gonna need they're really gonna
[1:42:24] need that relationship with jesus christ
[1:42:26] come on be honest now
[1:42:29] you're good there there's the need but
[1:42:31] you recognize that that of the
[1:42:33] relationship itself and yet if there's
[1:42:35] rules
[1:42:36] without relationship
[1:42:38] that leads to rebellion
[1:42:42] there's an age to become their buddy
[1:42:46] are you hearing me now always you have a
[1:42:48] relationship but you don't you're not
[1:42:50] buddies when you're five years old
[1:42:52] right
[1:42:54] are you hearing me well that's for
[1:42:56] another service
[1:42:58] but it's relationship
[1:43:00] god does not god give us boundaries
[1:43:03] oh how precious are those boundaries
[1:43:05] aren't you i'm glad when he corrects me
[1:43:07] i'm glad i'm glad that he says hey wait
[1:43:09] a minute the tide's only going this far
[1:43:12] the moon you know caused the boundaries
[1:43:14] you know we're not just we're not like
[1:43:15] little kids running around over the
[1:43:16] doctor's office of we're in this
[1:43:18] person's face and we're in this person's
[1:43:20] face
[1:43:22] you've probably seen that i've seen that
[1:43:23] hey there's personal space
[1:43:26] you know that you don't run around and
[1:43:28] get in everybody's face well that's
[1:43:29] something that parents teach
[1:43:31] should teach they didn't cute getting in
[1:43:33] everybody's face
[1:43:36] now i know sometimes you go oh brother
[1:43:37] sam there's a big old stick in the mud

[2:03:25] oh
[2:03:26] jesus how we love you lord
[2:03:31] how great you are lord
[2:03:36] hallelujah
[2:03:37] i think of that
[2:03:39] that scripture in the song of solomon
[2:03:42] where the bible says
[2:03:44] love
[2:03:45] is as strong as death
[2:03:48] it might seem like that those don't
[2:03:49] belong in the same
[2:03:51] scripture
[2:03:52] but you think about it
[2:03:54] you go back and look at a picture
[2:03:57] maybe a year ago two years ago three
[2:03:59] years ago four years ago and you look
[2:04:01] and you say wow
[2:04:02] where did those wrinkles come
[2:04:05] where did that hair go or where did this
[2:04:06] change you know what it is once we reach
[2:04:09] a certain spot death starts setting in
[2:04:11] is that right
[2:04:12] it just keeps setting in
[2:04:15] but think about that
[2:04:16] as the love of god setting in on our
[2:04:18] life
[2:04:20] like a picture that we took
[2:04:22] and here we were in preschool
[2:04:25] kindergarten
[2:04:26] first grade you know some of those
[2:04:28] pictures you take in first grade and you
[2:04:29] smile and you're missing a tooth
[2:04:32] and then by the time you get to fourth
[2:04:34] grade you look and you say wow
[2:04:36] i can see that's that person back there
[2:04:38] and you see that and then here seventh
[2:04:40] grade eighth grade
[2:04:42] it's what is it it's a life
[2:04:45] that's maturing and growing
[2:04:48] and it seems like all of a sudden like i
[2:04:49] look at young our young people i look at
[2:04:51] our boys and look i look at them i think
[2:04:53] goodness what happened here
[2:04:55] it's like brother nathan erickson who
[2:04:56] stood here the other night in ministry i
[2:04:59] remember when brother nathan said on the
[2:05:00] front row and i went to brother race his
[2:05:02] feet didn't even touch the ground
[2:05:05] i remember that
[2:05:07] i think goodness what happened
[2:05:10] now i'm looking up to him what happened
[2:05:12] in many ways look up to him
[2:05:14] it
[2:05:16] it's see
[2:05:17] it's it happened it was growing it was
[2:05:20] changing
[2:05:21] that's what
[2:05:23] the relationship with the lord jesus
[2:05:25] christ brings about in your life
[2:05:28] you welcome him
[2:05:30] he brings change
[2:05:33] you welcome him and invite him in
[2:05:35] it's inviting and you watch how things
[2:05:38] change
[2:05:39] just like those pictures in that
[2:05:41] yearbook there's a change taking place
[2:05:43] in your life
[2:05:44] who's doing that not a creed
[2:05:47] not an idea
[2:05:49] it's the person of jesus christ
[2:05:53] when we rejoice and say the marriage of
[2:05:55] the lamb has come and we understand what
[2:05:57] that means it's christ here in his
[2:05:59] fullness and a bride is coming into full
[2:06:01] view it's to understand that here is the
[2:06:03] very person of jesus christ not just a
[2:06:06] baptism of the spirit but the person
[2:06:08] himself coming
[2:06:11] and he brings transformation in our life
[2:06:14] probably for every
[2:06:16] husband and wife that's in here i can
[2:06:18] truly say this right now i love my wife
[2:06:21] and i appreciate her more now
[2:06:24] than when i even started coordinating
[2:06:25] when we got married it means more to me
[2:06:28] now
[2:06:29] i don't know what i'd do without her
[2:06:32] our fellowship
[2:06:33] as i told the young people the other day
[2:06:35] i said
[2:06:36] before i was ever called to the ministry
[2:06:37] i said i've got a lot of good
[2:06:39] ministering friends
[2:06:40] good brothers i said my favorite person
[2:06:43] to fellowship with around the world is
[2:06:45] my wife
[2:06:47] no one i'd rather talk to i know some
[2:06:49] might not have that opportunity but
[2:06:51] there's no one else it's your best
[2:06:52] friend
[2:06:55] and i believe if you don't have i
[2:06:56] believe god can move on that
[2:06:58] and bring that about
[2:07:00] okay
[2:07:01] understand that don't look at it and
[2:07:02] take like a condemning look in and say
[2:07:04] god this is what you're able to do
[2:07:07] we want that relationship why because in
[2:07:09] everything that we do when dwelling
[2:07:11] together in unity what does it do
[2:07:13] it allows the spirit of god just to flow
[2:07:17] now you haven't realized how it was look
[2:07:18] how brother brown stood on the platform
[2:07:20] that time
[2:07:21] and that maniac came up there
[2:07:24] everybody else was fearful
[2:07:26] right they were all tore up and things
[2:07:28] were going every which way there wasn't
[2:07:30] any unity taking place right there
[2:07:34] but brother branham
[2:07:36] he yielded his thoughts to the lord
[2:07:40] you remember that brother bram says i
