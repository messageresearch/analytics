need to move it down a little bit we okay okay just give you a little testimony while you're sitting down on Thursday you know brother Sam contacted me to come preach and and I just felt in my heart immediately that you know I wanted to come and help him out and speak to you all and I don't remember what day we talked but Thursday night I think I got a little touch of food poisoning and I mean it just tore me up and I was up you know one thirty to five just pacing I was just so sick and I I made a little maybe I maybe I got to be balanced out on it but but the John la Fontaine the Sunday that he ministered was the last time we heard from him and that was actually I was supposed to preach that Sunday but I got sick on that that Saturday and my voice was in and out and so I said brother John I said it I know you're preparing for Wednesday night would you take Sunday for me and I'll take your Wednesday and he said well yes sure brother that's fine well I didn't realize he was he was feeling a little bad and what we come to believe far as we know was that you know he was having a heart attack right at that time and so I looked at a man who paved the way through preaching the gospel and he got up and through a heart attack he could preach and so I believe I'm just trusting I told him I might saw him in the hospital I think it was Wednesday when he went in I can't remember and I said brother John I said I'm looking at this two ways I said either I put you here whorehouse that God knew that you needed to speak one more time and I said I'm just trusting in that and so I kind of made a little commitment there I thought you know what did these brothers do before they had someone else they could lean on they preached whether they were sick or not so I said God I just I believe if I'm wrong then then you changed the situation but I believe that you want me to go preach to those peoples so touch me so Thursday Thursday night Friday morning I mean I was just so sick doing a little bit better I'm trying to remember what night it was I think it was Friday Friday night I woke up about one of 12 12:30 and again I was just I wasn't just sick to my stomach and I and I thought lord I I need a touch from you and I just just kind of felt in my heart I thought you know if I knelt down at my bedside I'd feel better so I knelt down and I got to thinking about it and I thought you know my grandfather sent me a prayer cloth that the Prophet prayed over when he was preaching the the seven seals and said I'm gonna go get my Bible and I'm gonna get that prayer cloth so I laid my Bible open to acts 19 that's the scripture that says that they took cloths off of Paul's body and they laid it on the sick devils were cast out the sick were raised and I took that prayer cloth and I just held it on my stomach where it was hurting and I held and I just I just leant over on my Bible and I just rested my face on my Bible and I prayed and I said God I just I'm trusting in your word I have nothing else here I just I'm so sick I can't do nothing well this might sound funny you might be me a fanatic I don't know but my wife laughed at me a little bit but I remembered a testimony brother Perry Greene told and he said there was a man and he had stomach trouble and the way that they cut these prayer cloths they cut it with it differently and it just frayed a little bit on the end and so the brother that was having the stomach trouble said can I just have one of those threads and he said well sure and he gave it to him and he ate it and so I held I held this prayer cloth up in the moonlight and I saw a thread sticking out and so I grabbed this thing and I died and I'll tell you what I don't know at what point it was shortly after and I'm not and you know I mean I'm just applying Scripture any way that I can and I tell you that stomachache left me call me a fanatic freaking appease the prayer cloth but I heard a testimony and I thought God if you can do it for him I'm gonna claim it too amen so we're just trusting in the Lord this morning I've just I've just been a little you know there's there's been a lot of death around us lately as believers brother John and and you all brother browning and you know this this young sister is it Liliana Liliana and I don't know if she went here I don't know how how close I don't know the situation but you know I was talking to my grandfather's almost almost 90 and it just kind of hit me he said you know Sonny said I'm hoping the family's coming out and he lives down in Texas said the family's coming out in April and he said I just like to see everybody before the Lord takes me home and that just kind of hit me and I thought well pop I said I'm gonna I'm gonna come out and see you but I'm gonna be a little selfish I'm gonna do it after everyone else leaves because I want you to myself because I can't tell you the last time I seen him and he's just a great prayer warrior for us so this has been on my heart a little bit I was actually going to go a different way and yesterday and study the Lord took me this way so I feel a little bit unprepared I haven't preached this before so but coming in here after you all worshiping I just feel like if I can't preach in this atmosphere then I need to hang it up if you would stand for the reading of the word if you would open up the scripture to first Corinthians 15 first Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 49 and I bring you greetings from pastor Paul and the local assembly back home and I just trust that this will be a blessing to you today 1st Corinthians 15 49 and as if we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruption shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory and then the great words that we know Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thinks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen and if you would 1st Thessalonians 4 first Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 13 but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen let's pray Lord Jesus we come before you God and Lord I'm just submitting myself to you once more Lord I might feel within myself God and capable or whatever it might be but Lord if you just help me get out of the way God and let you speak Lord then we'll know God that we're seated in heavenly places we'll know God that we can walk away father with encouragement or correction or whatever you'd have father I just ask Lord that you be the preacher this morning can I pray for brother Sam Lord it's one thing it's a hard thing to lose someone who's older in life but Lord to lose somebody who's so young and to preach that funeral Lord it's Lord is just some things are hard to understand bless your people now bless brother Sam bless the funeral in Jesus name Amen amen you can be seated again I don't know you know the full situation where where our young sister went to church and things but I just thought that I might be able to come and minister to you today because regardless of whether its family or or whether they went to our church or you know you you know the family because a lot of them come here but a lot of times our hearts break with them and and it's it's just it's just too difficult to understand it's just too hard I'm just realizing I forgot a piece of paper I wanted to read you but that's okay you know there's another situation that we know of some friends of ours that we go to church with their family down south I don't I don't know well it's what's what's their last name I can't think of it right now you might know him but they they had a child it was a boy it'd be their first boy and it was just a couple hours old and and it it was born too soon and and the baby passed and so she she just wrote a beautiful testimony just just so beautifully written and and you know you could come back and and I believe it was job that said though you slay me yet I'll trust you and sometimes in these situations that's the only thing that we can fall back on is Lord though you slay me I'm gonna trust you because we can't listen we're in we're in time we're in we're in we're in this light in this matter we can't understand the bigger picture because we can't see the bigger picture but you never know what would have come down the road for for one of these little ones are for for one of the older ones you know I mean you just we believe that God is a healer of the sick that doesn't change God can heal the sick and if you don't believe that I just asked you to go getting the word a little bit longer and ask God to change your heart and reveal that to you because God does heal the sick I testified of it this morning I'm telling you my stomach was just in all kinds of trouble but God came down on the scene by his word and and and by faith in his word I was healed and you can receive your healing this morning you don't have to come up for prayer you can receive your healing while the word goes forth all you have to do is believe it all you got to do is claim it as your own that's it that settles it amen regardless of what the circumstances look like regardless of what symptoms you feel if you'll cling to the Word of God that thing has to leave you brother John la Fontaine was was he said and I'm claiming it - he was a stage 4 cancer survivor that's how he said it I'm a stage 4 cancer survivor you know sister sherry told me she said cancer couldn't take my daddy because he claimed that he was a stage 4 cancer survivor the Lord chose to take him by another way we don't know why the Lord took him we believe that the Lord could have raised him up I believe that even under the influence of medical anesthesia that God could have raised him up out of that bed without the doctors backing off the anesthesia I just believe God's that big God because one day he stood at the graves of Lazarus and he said Lazarus come forth and that was after four days when corruption had set in and Lazarus came forth out of the grave he had to rise up because that was the word of the Lord Jesus so I believe the word of God but oftentimes we just have to have just as much faith as you apply towards God raising somebody up from being sick or raising them up from the dead you have to apply the same amount of faith if the Lord chooses to take them because there's a much greater picture I don't I don't you know I hope this is okay but this is just how I've been thinking about it you know our our little sister Liliana or this this couple that lost the baby just just hours old or minutes I think you never know that the the the family the dad's the dad's a logger the family's into farming you have no idea what would have happened maybe that little boy would have had an accident down the road that would have tore him up and it would have been much worse off to see him in that state than to see him pass just just a couple minutes old maybe listen I I hope this is okay I'm just I'm just trying to help you see a bigger picture here what if our little sister Liliana what if what if what if something bad would have happened to her down the road what if some man would have come in with ill intention and and and would have got her off to herself or something we don't like to think that way but listen you got to apply your faith just as much that God is a big God he knows the end from the beginning and he knew that right now was the best time for sister Liliana to come home is this okay this morning is it okay if we talk about this I just I just trust us so minister to you Hebrews 13 14 you know I often wonder people I think sometimes they would question well why do we have sickness why do we have death well there was a fall in the beginning in the Garden of Eden Satan came in and he injected his his his plan into God's plan he perverted God's plan and and and the wages of sin is death so where does death come from death comes from sin sin entered the world and therefore interrupted eternal life it brought time into the picture all of that for a bigger plan right but but here Hebrews 13 14 says for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come so as believers we know that death is a part of this life we don't know if we'll see it we believe that that one day in the moment and in the twinkling of an eye that we shall be changed and that we won't see death but but the fact of the matter is some of us are going to see death some of us have seen death right I mean we lost loved ones and things that's just that's just the reality of what we're living in until until that wonderful day that we're looking forward to here on this earth were not promised tomorrow we're not promised life eternal why we are here on this earth in the shape that it's in and and understand that when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you receive eternal life but I'm talking one day if God doesn't come in your lifetime you're gonna taste death with the Holy Ghost with eternal life right but you understand what I'm saying eternal life this isn't God's we're not back to God's eating yet eternal life doesn't exist on this world in the state that it's in in fact it can the Prophet taught us that that there's this is Satan's Eden this God God cannot come and dwell in this state and really when you receive the Holy Ghost you can't stay in this state why why then does a believer die because you can't stay here because this is not your Eden yet this is Satan's Eden you can't live in this in the state that it's in you you can't stay and sin forever when you have God in you in fact we're promised in the scripture that we're gonna experience death we're gonna experience sorrow but we're also promised that we'll be comforted Matthew 5:4 says blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted so pray for the family pray for the ones who have lost loved ones don't don't sister browning I hope you don't mind me saying don't quit praying for sister browning and in your pastor because when holidays and birthdays and things come along come along it all that pain it can be it could be a day of the year it could be a smell it could be a song it could be anything and it triggers the memory and and oh the pain it brings but the Bible says that blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted it please yes these three three verse one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to be plucked up that which is planted a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away when I read that I thought you know it's a time to get to gain a loved one it's a time to gain a relationship and then there's a time to let it go to let God take him a time to ran into time to sow a time to keep silent in the time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace to everything there is a season and a time and a purpose notice I just noticed that in the scripture and a time to every purpose under heaven everything has a purpose and listen as believers as believers that's where we rest that's where we find joy that's where you're fine that's where in in the midst of loss in the midst of a funeral going on today you could come here this morning and you could worship from the depths of your soul because as believers you realize that there's a purpose you may not know that purpose and you may not understand it but you know that there's a purpose Paul tells us in 1st Thessalonians that he doesn't want us to be ignorant he says don't be ignorant brethren and mourn as those who don't have a hope so listen it's okay to mourn it's okay to mourn he just said Paul said it's okay to mourn but listen I don't want you to be ignorant don't don't mourn as those that don't have a hope because that morning I can tell you I've been close to people I i we have family members who don't who don't believe in God and when they mourn it's a terrible thing they they mourn and they just their Paul just says it beautifully there is no hope they have no hope they don't see they can't see a bigger picture they it just it tears them up to the point where that's their and don't get me wrong if you got to go on an antidepressant for a little bit that's do it do what the doctor says I believe that God can take you off of it - God will use that same doctor to put that prescribe you medicine to take you off of medication so if if you need it don't feel bad take it but know that that that this this is going to do you better than any pill that you can ever have you understand is that an okay balance I I trust that your pastor would agree with that but don't don't mourn as them that have no hope I mean they just they and and listen there's a natural process I believe you forgive me my my voice is just keeping me from really preaching how I want to you know we they they they just go back and forth there's there's a there's a time I believe in mourning from what I've seen that you know you go back in your mind and you wonder should we have done this different did did we give him the right medication did we give it to him when they when they needed it did they did they suffer too long did they feel this that and you just go through all that I listen I've watched a lot of people and and they just it just rolls around in their mind and listen you you got to stop that rolling and you got to have faith at some point you got to trust God amen you just you just have to stop it because otherwise Satan will keep you in such a turmoil that that he'll just steal your joy but when you don't have a hope you don't have you know it's it's when the wheels going like this the thoughts are going like this with the word and with faith you can stick it in there and stop it but without without a hope it just keeps going around and around and around and it'll just it'll drive you crazy you'll you'll just go insane thinking about these things because and it just tears you up don't let Satan steal your joy amen don't let Satan steal your joy so it's okay to mourn listen you want another scripture when Jesus came to the grave of Lazarus what's the shortest scripture in the Bible that I know of jesus wept so it's okay to weep it's okay to mourn it's okay to feel the loss it's okay but there's a truth there's a truth that we hold to as believers and that truth is that Paul tells us believers they don't die believers only sleep amen believers only sleep jesus said of Geri's his daughter she sleepeth and then the disciples were like well Lord we don't know not understand that maybe he meant this maybe he that and jesus said listen she's dead okay if you really want me to put it in your terms she's dead but if you look at the heavenly where I'm from in my kingdom Jesus was preaching his kingdom to him and he said she's only asleep she only sleeps for you all she's alive in another place of Lazarus our friend Lazarus sleepeth I'm sorry I was it's graves of Lazarus our friend Lazarus sleepeth and then the disciples were questioning and he said Lazarus is dead but listen she sleepeth he's sleeping believers they sleep they go to sleep they don't die they don't die this is the kingdom of God Paul goes in first Thessalonians to instruct us how to help someone who loses a loved one how do we help how do we because because the the grief is so great I've listened I just found that you know we try to find words and we try to speak things to help somebody who's going through a loss and and the truth is really there's not a whole lot you can say that's gonna make them feel better because there's just there's just an emptiness and and there's just a hole there and and it just it can't be filled it can't be there's a lot that's why they call a loss you lost something and even though you know one day you'll see him again it still hurts it physically it hurts one time I and it may have been your pastor I'm not sure but I remember hearing the story about a little boy and his parents I believe they died in a fire and they were trying to comfort this little boy he wouldn't hardly eat he wouldn't talk he just off to himself just completely shut in and they had the funeral and the little boy came out and he went over and he sat on the front of the church steps and another little boy come out and he sat next to him and he put his arm around him and they just cried they just both of them just started crying and after they had their cry they got up and they ran off and they started playing and so the pastor and the pet and then the other ones that the adults they called the little boy that went over and set and put his arm around him they said come over here we've tried everything what did you do what'd you say to him what what what'd you say to get him to bring him back and he said nothing he said I just cried with him and listen sometimes you don't have the words to say sometimes sometimes just cry with them it just shows them that you care in it and really that that says more than words can say because because you're connecting heart-to-heart with her you're connecting with their pain is this okay this morning I want a shout louder but my voice is restricting me a little so I'm just trusting this is the way the Lord wants it to go the word says that someday we're going to see them again Paul says comfort one another with these words we won't we won't prevent those that sleep from coming for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven I just want to take a moment because I want to I want to show you where we're at in time because I believe that he said comfort one another with these words and I believe if we can see where we're at in time then we'll be comforted I believe that we'll be excited even in the midst of loss and things it gives us it gives us the hope that we're going to see them but we're going to see them one day soon for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first when when he's descending then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord so shall we ever be with the Lord you want to find comfort that's not just with the Lord just talking about you and him he's talking about with those loved ones we're gonna meet him in the air and then we'll be forever with the Lord then we'll be eternity one with another then then sickness and sorrow and death will cease notice we're alive and remain are caught up and we don't prevent them let me see here I'm just missing something here okay a little bit further could I keep going Paul said in first Corinthians 15 we read I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed some of us aren't going to taste death listen if we're believers we believe in a rapture otherwise what are we here for what what other what other explanation do you have for after afterlife what other what other hope do you have if you don't believe in a resurrection if there is no God and there is no heaven what are you living for I got news for you if you believe that you come back as an ant i squish ants I don't like ants I don't like spiders so what do you do then I hope that's not but I just I would just challenge your faith I don't believe we got anyone here that believes that but I'm just I'm just saying what what do you I want to I want to direct your hope I want to direct your faith there what are we living for what are we striving for let me ask you this when the preaching of the word comes forth if there's not a heaven if there's not a rapture if there's not a resurrection then what's in here that says amen to the word what's in here when we hear about these things that you feel that drawn that connection I can tell you you're being spoken to from another dimension oh my my heavenly home is bright and fair I feel like traveling on amen there's something pulling there's something you're connecting with and that's your body over there waiting for you so remember if we die here we have a body already waiting amen you have a theophany you have a heavenly home that's your mansion over there Amen sister Liliana brother John that little baby brother brother browning the different ones who have gone on when they take their last breath here they're already over there they just it's just it's just a change of location amen their home just changed really their home here were strangers their home now amen so it's as its as the Lord descends as the Lord descends to gather us together now I want to watch I want you to watch I want you to catch these things he descends first with a shout what's the shout brother Branham taught us it's the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride it's a shout a messenger getting the people ready we've had the shout we're preaching the shout to you today we've had the shout that the messengers been taken off the scene the shout has come the message is calling the bride together if you don't understand what I'm talking about I would encourage you to get with your pastor get with brother brother Sam and and ask him about these things because this tells us where we're living in time this gives us our hope we're living in a time we're living in this it's it's it's the shout it's the message that we preach it's the message that brother Sam preaches every Sunday every Thursday to you the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice that allowed voice in st. John 11:30 844 my voice is feeling good thank you for praying that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection so understand it's it's the shout it's it's getting the bride together and then the voice comes and he calls up out of the grave the Prophet said that if Jesus wouldn't have said Lazarus come forth then every grave would have been open well guess what one day Jesus is going to come forth and he's going to say come forth my bride and all the graves will be open now watch getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead Sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things takes place the next is what was a trumpet a voice a shout shout a voice of trumpet now the third thing is the trumpet which always at the Feast of Trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that will be the bride's supper the Lord's Supper with the bride and the sky see the first thing comes forth is this message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages the ones that have died in our time they're caught together and then the Trump the feast in the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends I ask you where are we at in time really if we believe we're just waiting we're just waiting for the dead for the excuse me those that sleep we're waiting for those that sleep to be called up and then the trumpets going to go forth and then we'll be with them forever more that should encourage our hearts this morning you know I've just had this burning on my heart and I was thinking you know if I get the opportunity I'm gonna say it today you know the scripture tells us that as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man as it was in the days of Noah and of life you know I think it words it those couple different ways but it's referring to the things that are going on in those times brother Branham teaches us and I was thinking you know I was listening I've just been listening through the through the the message the year 63 and I and I just went through flashing red lights of his coming and something he said that struck me and I went I'm gonna set a challenge out to especially our brothers this morning as it was in the days of Sodom we know that there's you know the amaura immorality is just on the rampage it's just corruption as has never been more corrupt than the day that we're living in at the time that is right now but it says that if you look back during those times that the son of man saw that the the daughters are the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were faring and brought in unto them the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were fair and went in unto them I want to challenge you brothers and I'm just going to preach that if you're stuck on pornography that that Delilah is stealing your strength and you need to come away from it that's the time we're living in and they have statistics I've heard years ago that they would have I was I don't know why this all came into my mind but I'm just gonna say it they had statistics years ago I remember hearing that the worst that hotel saw of pornography being viewed on TVs and hotels from different groups they had come stay was was Christian was among Christian men that's a shame that's a disgrace that's a disgrace I asked you that if you're if you're bound that you you give over to God that you that you seek God repent and come away from the thing because that thing let me I'm not getting it let's get away from pornography whatever you're tied to today whatever sin whatever whatever thing that you that you feel is draining your strength come away from it because that thing will be here Delilah and it'll take your strength I'm gonna point out if for whatever it is I don't care what it is it's time that we get away from these things that we live as Christians should live because we're preparing for a rapture and it's going to come any day and we need to be ready we need listen we need to be mature grown-up Christians if the sinner can't come into this building and seek God on display and I'm talking that's going to be reflected in your personal life then where can the sinner go amen they should be able to look at you in the workplace and you should have a have such a cleanliness about you such a holiness that it attracts them to you that that listen don't take your holiness for granted when God brings holiness into your life that you that displays whether you realize it or not sisters your your that your the great example of this the way the way you dress the way you conduct yourselves the things that the scripture says about about hair and about makeup that's okay listen if you struggle about it now don't just just stay with it got it reveal it to you but I'm just saying that is there's such a thing of holiness in your life that's why God they listen oh my that's why God required that's why God asks it of you quit quit looking it as I have to I have to do this I listen if you catch what God's trying to do for you as a woman of God you'll want to do it you'll just want to do it because you realize it's it's a protection it's a it's a it's a position for you God says listen I want your dignity to be the highest that it can be and that's why I'm asking these things of you that doesn't determine your salvation it's not a heaven or hell issue will give the critics that it's not a heaven or hell issue but I get so tired of hearing that because it's not about is this a heaven or hell issue it's about what pleases my lord what pleases you lord my brother the things that you look at the things that you watch the things that you look that you go to for entertainment the things listen I believe in I believe in wholesome entertainment in moderation because even though wholesome things it can stew your strengths but I'm just saying friends what's pleasing to God what's pleasing that's what we need to look at what's pleasing to You Lord and if you don't know don't don't fret don't get worked up ask him ask him who better to ask than the one who asked you than the one that says listen I love you I love you well Lord what why I love you it select it selectively love it's not because of what you've done it's not because of what you don't do Paul said that those things that I want to do I can't seem to do and the things that I don't want to do I seem to find myself doing what can separate us from the love of God show height or depth shell principality shall death nothing shall separate us from the love of God so listen get it out of your head that anything God would ask of you is is determining his love to you it doesn't the the the words of the song are escaping me that I asked you to sing again but it was just so good because God doesn't look at us he doesn't look at us he looks at the sacrifice you have a representation you have representation in heaven the Lamb the bloody lamb is on the mercy seat god when he hears your voice oh listen friend somebody must be struggling this mornin because when God from his throne looks down and he hears your voice he doesn't see you he sees your representation Oh which is Jesus Christ hallelujah he sees Jesus my is it that what it what a deal what a trade what a trade what a trade I just can't [Applause] Satan says mr. browning I'm gonna use you because I know you won't be offended Satan says hey did you see what sister browning did did you see that he's accuser of the Brethren day and night constantly accusing did you see what my sister did did you sorry he wouldn't call you sister did you see what she did did you see what your daughter did the one who claims to be your daughter did you see what she did and I can imagine that here's God and and he just just listening to Satan just accuse you and then and then he gets tired of it so he looks over at your representation and it's a bloody lamb [Applause] and he just says I can just imagine we dramatized and God just says son what do you say and Jesus says well father look at him and then God looks and he says I see you my son I only see the blood and then if you remember the vision that the Prophet had it's all being written down in the book and Jesus just says takes a little blood from his side and writes pardon and you know what God does God touched that book and I'm lucky the baptismal is and I'm open because this would be a perfect representation because God takes what Satan accused you of and he throws it in a sea of forgetfulness and let me tell you something God is so great that he never remembers it again because Satan will try and go fishing and I don't know if he catches anything and God's sea of forgetfulness but even if he comes and brings it back up this is written pardoned on it it smudged out the words can't be seen and there's your representation and that's all's God can see and then when you're sick and then when you're sad and you cry out to God God hears your voice but he sees your representation that's why when you pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the same as Jesus Christ Himself praying because that's the high priest that's the one that's that's reading your words to God what you pray he's iterating to God so it's just the same as if he prays listen God answers every prayer when you think that God didn't answer your prayer let me tell you God answers every prayer it may not be the way that we wanted it or the way that maybe we were asking for it but let me tell you this if you'll pray and you'll say father thy will be done you'll never be disappointed Amen never you'll never be disappointed I don't know if we say this for our benefit or yours but I don't know how long I've been on this but none of that was in my notes so let's go on with our thought here revelations 21 verse 1 are y'all ok I haven't been paying attention to time so and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea that word pass away is a term we often use it's not the same word as I'm reading here but we often use that that term of words pass away to describe somebody who's who's gone on to be with the Lord who's died we they passed away we'll say that word in the English language means it's done it's dead it's it's gone pass away when you say they passed away it means they're not here no more but there's certain instances like this in the scripture where it the actual meaning of the word passed away here means to change from one form to the other so as believers when we say that our little sister Liliana or our brother John passed away that just means we're saying as they changed from one form to the other amen they're not dead they sleep they're just changed into their heavenly home they changed into the into the incorruptible I like this because just to illustrate this I want you to I just I just thought this was beautiful so I'm just I'm just gonna say it how Oh Lord gave it heavens and earth shall shall pass away jesus said but my words shall never pass away then let me read it to you by the meaning heavens and earth shall change but my word will never change amen that word change it's it's a loosing when Christ went to the grave of Lazarus he said loosed him it's the same word it's a it's a it's a changing from one form to the other it's the loosing one day friends why are these these corruptible bodies are going to put on incorruption and we're going to be changed from one form to the other we're gonna be loosed from from this vessel that that can get sick and that can die and that can feel sorrow and that you know that that Satan just he's a it's the principalities of the air and he can affect this thing but one day we're gonna be changed and he can't touch that thing he can't touch us there let me see I might I might just skip some of this there will be no death there I just I just want to encourage you this morning I just want you to have some joy this morning in your heart there will be no death there there's no sorrow there there's no heartache there there's no sickness there's no fatigue there's no there's no headache there's no stomachache there's no cancer there will never be another teardrop off a mother's cheek for her baby there may not never be another teardrop off of a husband or a wife for their for their spouse for their sweetheart there will be another never another tear you'll be with them forever with the Lord death is I just got to start bringing it to a close death where the Branham said this about death he can only take me by the hand and lead me across to master he is not my slave driver I am NOT death slave he is my slave Christ conquered death for me and only one thing he can do is pull me into the presence of my Maker when this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have another one waiting that's what death is to the believer it's just to usher it just takes you from one form to the other death death you know when you when someone's dying and in it there there's a little bit of suffering that that goes with death whether you know and it might I just want to say this right because you know there's it's just different circumstances I've seen but when they die you know the the the breathing will become labored what is that well let me ask you when a woman is in labor her breathing changes she's got to breathe different because why because something is about to be born where the random said that in you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a life it's it's a baby you have you have the life of Christ inside of you and when death comes there has to be something that that triggers that birth there has to be something because you know nobody wants to die that they even the lot you know even as believers we know what's on the other side but we get worried about loved ones here we don't we don't want to leave different ones behind we're thinking about that we're thinking are they going to be okay what about this one are they going to be taken care of what about you know this one struggled with this and you have all these things you know those things are still on you and so you're laboring into it and so the Prophet said you need something to just shock you a little bit it just shocks you a little bit and then and then it's birth it's like when that baby's born it needs a little shock a little stimulation to take its breath and that's all death is that's all death is for you that's all death is for these ones who have gone on it's just a little shock to birth them into that other Kingdom I pray this is helping you this morning because you know sometimes these these things when we have people dying that's close to us it leaves a lot of questions and I and I just trust them that your questions are being answered this morning if this early for the hammer neck will be dissolved we have one already waiting you know waiting all right now so this is this is I I put this in I just felt led to put this in and and I'm just trusting maybe somebody had a question on this in Matthew 1810 he was speaking about taking little children I believe this is where he says suffer the little children to come unto me there was little children little tots three or four years old picking them up they brought him unto Him children a child children comes from the name child it's it's a little fellow not an infant but between that and a teenager it's not responsible yet for itself so I I hope I'm just gonna step back a minute because I just pray this is okay they're not responsible for themselves yet so our little sister Liliana she wasn't responsible for herself yet so maybe someone would say well will she be there now he said take heed that you don't despise if you'd really take that interpretation of the word is mystery see did not see see that take heed that you don't mistreat one of those one of those little ones mistreat a child you should never do that they're their children they don't know see and now notice said because they're angels always beholding the father's face with which is in heaven you see in other words they're angels their messengers their bodies they're Angelica bodies that they'll go to if they die are always before the father's face see now if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting is that right that's a body so to me what he just said here was those little ones that they don't know no better they they they have representation before the father's face it's it's he listened he just said there ain't their angel which is the body that they'll go into if they should pass from this life into the next so why are you saying this well hopefully I'm making sense by now has just try to put it another way I believe that our sister Liliana I believe she'll be there she she was in that year she didn't know no better she had representation before the father's face now I want you to I want to I want to explain to you if just for a minute again can I have just it's only 12:30 does that answer if you had a question would with sister Liliana be there with the little ones be there I hope this answers it for you now the prophets said there's there's no children there's no babies there we're all one age for one eternity if you had to pick one age while you younger ones might not be able to pick this yet if you're over the age of 2025 will say what age would you go back to if you could choose what what age was your prime did you feel good could you stay up all night and then get up and go to work the next day what age was that around 20 right so think of that age your prime the prime of your youth when did when did when God made Adam and Eve did they come as infants no they came in the prime of their life that was their age that was and it was going to be for eternity but Satan interrupted that plan so what are we going back to for you older ones you should well if you can do it without hurt and you could stand and rejoice and say we're going back to that so the prime of the huge Amen hey listen I I the only reason I can just poke a little bit I'm only 32 but I'll tell you it hurts sometimes at 32 I might not know completely but things have changed I want to read to you one more thing in closing are you okay is this okay today I'm I just pray it's been a help to you I want to read to you something if you listen and I hope I hope this is okay I trust I believe I know brother Sam if you haven't read the supernatural book and you'd like to read a good book get with brother Sam to get you one of these because this this will really tell you what God did in our day in our age God oh it's just you need to read it if you haven't and if you're not a good reader they have it on audio and they do a decent job at it it's pretty good so I want to I want to read to you just just a couple of things here now again I don't know who I don't know what what what who all we have here so if you don't know what I'm talking about again get with brother Sam Hill he'll explain it real well to you we believe that a prophet came in our day and in this prophets life it wasn't a flowery blood of ease you know he it wasn't I hope this is okay but it wasn't the the Joel Osteen's and in that you know with multi-million dollar and and you know this was a humble man from Kentucky with a seventh grade education and God did a work through this man and we could show you in the scripture that's what I'm saying if you want if you don't understand this get with brother Sam because he'll show you in the scripture and that's what's important but he went through a lot of hardship and he lost he lost his his wife and and a little baby girl early on and so this is just picking it up after that he dreamed it so this is talking about him he dreamed he was somewhere on a prairie out west walking along a desert road singing a pop popular Western ballad there's a wheel on the wagon that's broken and the sign on the ranch says for sale bill walked by an old covered wagon the kind that the early settlers called a Prairie schooner one of the wagons front wheels was broken making the Box frame tip down in one corner until the axle touched the ground next to where the cracks would and will leaned up against the wagons frame a pretty young lady stood watching him so when his baby died she was just seemed like maybe a year and a half if that so this is this is a young lady standing there pretty young lady the way the wind played played with a long blonde hair her blue eyes sparkled in the Sun as bill walked by he took off his cowboy hat and greeted her cheerfully good morning ma'am she answered good morning daddy bill stopped and stared at the beautiful woman dressed in white she looked at least twenty years old why miss how can I be your daddy when you're almost as old as I am her smile widened showing perfectly formed teeth daddy you just don't know where you are on earth I was your little Sharon rose Sharon but you you were just a little baby there there aren't any babies here daddy they're all the same age we're immortal where is where is my brother Billy Paul I left him with mrs. broy just a little while ago Sharon said I'm going to wait here for Billy why don't you go on up and see mama she's waiting for you up at your new home new home brand homes don't have never owned a home we've always been poor vagabonds you have one here daddy look and she pointed up the road there at the end of the trail stood an impressive mansion perched on top of the hill the Sun had just dipped behind the mansion's roof and now Sun beam shot out in every direction like beacons guiding weary travelers home to rest bill walked along the road and with his hands up in the air singing my home sweet home a long stairway led from the bottom of the hill up to the front door you still listening hope waited in the doorway dressed in white and her long black hair unfurl unfurled in the breeze bill bound up the stairway taking three steps that are stride when he reached the landing he fell at her feet hope gently urged him to get up bill said hope I just met Sharon down on the road she's turned out to be such a beautiful young lady yes she has bill we've got she said yes she has bill bill you've got to stop worrying about me and Sharon listen I'm talking about those who have lost loved ones you've got to stop worrying about them honey I can't help it I've been so lonesome for you both and Billy Paul cries for you all the time I don't know what to do with him Sharon and I are far better off than you are she said promise me you won't worry about us anymore hope put an arm over his shoulder and patted his back just like she had done so often on earth bill you look so tired you're wearing yourself out praying for the sick come inside with me now you can sit down and rest he walked with her inside the mansion and there sat a green Morris chair exactly like the one he had lost to the finance company because he couldn't make the payments Hope said do you remember that chair a lump form to Bill's throat how well I remember they won't take this one she assured him it's already paid for I don't understand you're going back now bill promise me that you won't worry about me and Sharon any more hope I can't promise that can you can you put yourself there but hope was suddenly gone and bill was waking up he was still kneeling over the cot in the darkness of the kitchen he stood up and looked around the darkened room it seemed like he could feel an invisible arm over his shoulder hope is that you it seemed like it could he could feel her petting his back hope are you here in the room was he imagining it or could he hear her voice whispering promise me you won't worry bill said hope I promise if you've lost a loved one I prayed you can hear them this morning and whispering to you don't worry about me don't don't worry don't don't worry no more I'm better off than you are promise me you won't worry it promise them you won't worry because you have a joy which is set before you you have a promise in the Word of God that one day you'll see him again we'll be caught up together and then forever with the Lord amen God richly bless you as you stand to your feet you know the Prophet said one time I heard that he said our loved ones are only as far as we put them because remember if this earthly tabernacle be destroyed we already have one waiting it has to be near you for you to step right into if your theophany is that close to you then that other dimension is that close you'll just step right into it someday there are only as close and over as far as you put them one time again is just something I had heard that I think sister methi maybe lost her mom and she was sitting on the couch and and brother Branham was sitting there and he said he said honey do you miss your mom she said yeah I do and he said well she's just sitting right there can you imagine friends the ones that we've lost out there at the funeral wherever they are right now can you imagine just picture this because this is truth sister Liliana is just right there with them that little baby that that couple lost down south it's just right there with them all the time brother John is right there sis maybe brother browning is right next to you right now hopefully enjoying the service it's only listen if you haven't lost a loved one heaven is only that far away I pray friends let's let's let's live like it's that close because one day I'm telling you friends and we're we're that far in time one day it's just gonna be the twinkling of an eye faster than you can blink and then we'll be there what a glorious day amen [Music] if you would just bow your hearts with me for a moment really you got something you can just sing real soft here go ahead just while your heads are bowed as he sings this [Music] shadows demon amen just think on the Lord unending days where nights will never Oh a city where storm clouds ever get whoa this is just whatever means to [Music] what will it be when we get over No enjoy Oh [Music] crowd price oh this is just [Music] as I play that real soft I wonder if you could just find somebody's brother and a brother or sister your sister just let's lay our hands upon one another and pray for one another again friends I I don't I love him but I don't know you I don't know what your situations have been but if you've lost a loved one I just I just remember the words that have been spoken this morning just keep your mind over on heaven as we pray Lord Jesus we come before you God and Lord I just lift my hands up over the congregation this morning Lord God I've seen some crying and things Lord and no doubt God they they've suffered
