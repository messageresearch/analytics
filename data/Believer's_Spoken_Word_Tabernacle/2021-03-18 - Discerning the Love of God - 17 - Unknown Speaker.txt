anything lord that would be displeasing to you we ask you forgive us father lord god we thank you dear lord jesus for this time we give ourselves to you lord this congregation for your glory lord in jesus name amen god bless you tonight let's read in the bible first corinthians chapter 13. i want to go back to verse 1. come on down from there first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1 though i speak with the tongues of men of angels have not charity and become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing do i bestow all my goods to feed the poor though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing the charity suffereth law it's kind he envieth not it vaunteth not itself and is not up amen in the amplified bible just to pull that part out the last part is what i want to begin dealing with here this evening it is not puffed up means does not display itself hardly so it deals with with pride you look here in the definition of the word puffed there in the in the scripture it deals with the primary sense of blowing it just wind it depends on where that wind is coming from because the wind of the enemy it brings poison it brings pride but the wind of god brings life so it just depends you know it and god's wind doesn't bring emptiness it brings transformation it brings his nature it brings his character so this is why we could have everything else but without charity we're nothing so look at this with puffed up it means to inflate to blow up to cause to swell up to puff up make proud to be puffed up to bear oneself lawfully be proud may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you know you think of this within our lives of how that the spirit of god would deal and express this through paul these are these are things that we understand that in our life that when we are born again of the spirit of god that just as much as you and i are humans we begin to take on the characteristics of a human we do not take upon the characteristics of a tree because the nature and the life what is within us is that of human and it will it will come out within its in the natural ways we're not there's not one of us here that's struggling to be a human it's the same way it is when we're born again of the spirit of god we're not we're not struggling to be a christian it is a life that then is automatically lived out of us we know that there is a maturity in our life of how the spirit of god would deal with our life and brood and move upon our lives to mature us and we recognize that maturity is not us getting to a place to where we are free from mistakes or even from for that matter of having maybe certain feelings or things that would arise but maturity is where we begin to recognize our need is for him completely is our self-sufficiency that'll never work we need him some real maturity is not something that we get to a place that we're higher it actually is quite the contrary it's actually a lowering of self that he might increase it's recognizing that we need him more and more and more and more and so when we look at these things we understand there's many things that as the attributes of the spirit of god would work within our life by the new birth and from that of the soul there is a change that has taken place where there is a new nature there's a new ownership there's a life that is there that moves to mold and shape our character and you and i know that character itself the holy ghost is the gift of god paul would call it the unspeakable gift of god but yet character is not a gift character is not something that can be given to any of us but character itself brother ram would simply put it this way it's a victory so in order for character if it's a victory then there must be battles or oppositions things that are set before us for us to overcome when we look in the land when israel would come in the land as soon as they cross the jordan then they come into the circumcision and once they move from there then now they're ready to start waging war on the inhabitants and start putting things out that have existed there they're there now ready to start tearing down idols tearing down orders tearing down pictures anything at all that would influence them in the wrong direction they've got an authority by god it's not them going into the land and trying to reform the land but they're going under the authority of thus saith the lord so have the word of god would direct him to take things down take take and take this away and submitting this that's the same way the holy spirit would do and work in our lives as well so the charity being that of god's own life the love of god the spirit of god it comes to influence our our our thoughts our actions and everything about our life and yet when we look at this some of these things as we've looked at it with envy with that part of it we've seen that with envy we've seen that even with vaunting or the boasting or the braggart and then here another characteristic that lets us know this is not what love is now you would look at this and you would think well that should just be a given but yet when we recognize it it's god letting us know that that nature that's down there on the inside that real nature on the inside will never exhibit these types of things but you and i are still left within this pest house we're still left within this two parts of us that are unredeemed the soul has been redeemed and we're looking to the redemption of the body human spirit that'll be replaced with the theophany because there is the perfection of three soul theophany glorified body so in the meantime here the spirit of god comes into our life by the new nature and god would admonish us to mortify the deeds of the body through the spirit these are not things that that god himself will do for us but it's things that you and i are entrusted with to recognize when things would want to rise up maybe it's a certain feeling or a certain way and the spirit of god as we will recognize it remember brother ram tells us there's two there's two parts to overcoming recognize the devil at every one of his tricks and then recognize that the god in you is greater and has already overcome that thing so it's to submit to the god who is within us mortify the deeds of the body bringing the body in subjection to the life that's within it because every one of these things that we've looked at here from that of envy to that of boasting and now when we look at this of pride they all you'll see how they all go together but yet let me just say this to you they are all spirits because even thoughts that come to you thoughts that may be of a wrong feeling thoughts that would come of a you know of something that maybe somebody said something in a way and you think why did they say it that way and that thought comes remember that thought is not just something of error but that thought is a spirit and the spirit remember it's always looking for some sort of an avenue or some way that it can somehow get in you know it's like a little balloon you take a balloon that's laying out you're getting ready to blow it up for the parties you know birthday party it's a little thing you know it's just laying down out of the way but as soon as you get that balloon and you get it filled with somebody that's got a lot of air they can blow that balloon up depending on what kind of balloon it is some of them are harder to blow up than others but you know you got to stretch it out and stretch it out but you begin to inflate that balloon and that balloon itself it grows bigger now it looks a lot bigger than what it actually is but but in reality all that it is is a lot of air and these are the things that when we see this with with the leading of the lord paul would write to you and i am this way this scripture will will pertain a lot to us as some of the things we begin to look at here this evening in second corinthians chapter 10 paul said for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds you know what strongholds are they are retreats castles or let me just put it simply excuses strongholds casting down notice what it says casting down imaginations that's familiar language the devil knows what it means to be cast down so casting down imaginations these are things that would want to exalt themselves notice casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god there's only one that i know who exalts self and that's the devil because it's where it operates totally contrary to the very kingdom and program of god god he descends cle dad god moves down to the very lowest and then it rises to the very highest so we see that this thing as the scripture says cast down every high thing a high thought that would exalt itself above the knowledge of god now there's things within the word that you and i know that there's things that we don't have to pray about and say well lord is it wrong for me to feel this way against my brother and my sister you don't got to pray about that you know what the word says there's many things that are laid out within the word then there are other things that can come our way that we do got to pray about now the praying about doing that part as i mentioned before you might have to pray as brother brahm said until you feel better towards that person before you talk to them again so notice casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having it in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled we realize these scriptures these are not things that god will do for us but these are things that we must yield ourselves to god and then god himself empowers equips us he gives to you and i have the strength as we yield to him then this is what he himself comes on the scene to do now when you look at this here i want to go to the book of ezekiel and you begin to see of how that things that when we look at this puffed up or when something that self can begin and you know would begin soul seemingly small but then it would exhibit itself you would look where does this start from this puffed up because this inflated this is something that would happen within a person or an individual before it ever manifests itself out in a physical realm it happens within now notice when we look at this characteristic we're going to track this down by the help of the lord and looking at this this very characteristic of how that this pride and how it begins to move as we see it here in the book of ezekiel chapter 28 verse 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus now this is a nation this is a national king and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sun full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou hast been in eden the garden of god this king had never been in the garden of god but the discernment of the spirit of god recognized who was behind this nation who was behind this king president whatever you want to say it dictator he recognized the spirit that was behind him you see god when god deals with the situation he's not dealing with this out here he's speaking to the spirit he's speaking to that that's why brother bram said in the prayer lines he said when things would begin to take place in these meetings it's a revelation of the holy ghost that uncovers the devil and he said you can begin to see the change of countenance on people's face because the devil is being exposed where he has got a hold in their life through indifference or sin and on and on and on so we recognize the spirit of god it's not dealing out here so much in this realm even though maybe a person there can be certain things that are being expressed out here in this realm but you can do all you want to out here in this realm but you'll never get to what the real real real root of the problem is you got to deal with that spirit you got to deal with that nature you got to deal with what it is that's influencing it so notice thou hast been in the eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz the diamond burl the onyx the jasper the sapphire emerald carbuncle gold workmanship of thy temperance and of thy pipes was prepared in the in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherubim that covereth think of how close and have sent thee so who set him to be this way god did thou waste upon the holy mountain of god you couldn't get no closer he could you couldn't get no closer no anointed cherubim that covered and thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect look at this look at this thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee who's he talking about lucifer satan he's identifying the spirit that's behind this king by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart now watch this thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty who gave him his beauty god did who created him god did god gave him the beauty that he had but yet notice thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty so there was a place as it shows us in the scripture that actually what what here is something that is god-given but he pulled it out from under being under the word of god or under the oversight or the influence of god and the very thing that was given to him beauty that was that was a great thing but when it pulled out he pulled it out from under the influence of the word and begin to move it for his own self this is the very thing that led to his downfall now notice thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty so it began in the heart thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness satan is look at this this wisdom it speaks he was a great man as far as an archangel remember he was the most beautiful archangel he was one of great beauty now notice i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee now let me just let me move on here you see when we look at this we find that how down through the scriptures we find clairol from the book of revelations we find that even when this this very same thing this rebellion that was that was led there in heaven we don't know how long because we know this was in this was in heaven this was in eternity how long was this was this something that was moving within his heart when was it something that all of a sudden that it just began to move in a way that he began to envy he wanted a kingdom that was more beautiful than michael's he wanted to take away and he wanted to draw people or angels after himself and to think of this this same attribute of this of beauty where things are more beautiful he he when he came down to earth after he was kicked out of heaven remember this he came down and he comes with that same measure when when cain comes to offer before god think of that abel comes with a bloody lamb and cain comes with the fruits of the field they weren't rotten god never turned down the sacrifice because they were rotten and you know had had all kinds of spots on them they were the most beautiful fruits and everything about it was beautiful but yet when it came to it god rejected cain's sacrifice cain put a lot of effort into it but everything that cain thought that it would be beauty that would actually draw the attention of god but he failed to recognize god this not god is not moved by our beauty god looks on the heart it's not the outward beauty that god is looking at god's been looking at the inner beauty of what real genuine character is this is why paul would open and say though i have all these gifts i could do this i can have i can do that all of these things that can be done but yet if i have not the beauty of the love of god the character of god then i'm nothing you see satan himself he operates in this way it has been the same way that he's always presented it before people he presents things in a way that it's beauty that it's harmless that it's okay it's fine but yet beneath that all of that hot air is a lot of death there's no substance there's no life listen to me satan himself is a very religious man this guy was the right hand man to god he knows how to worship he knows the order of these things he knows he knows all about this so he knows how to move people within these things and satan himself in order to actually gain a following he must make things appealing it must be beautiful so the same way that he moved in heaven is the same way when those angelic battles fell upon human beings he moves it in the same way he draws it out within beauty look at it to where even when john let's make a quantum leap clear to the very end in the book of revelations when john is given a private guided tour of the book of revelation by that of an angel one who was sent and remember he was a prophet he was there to uncover what was symbols and begin to unfold these things when john saw this church this harlot church john when he looked upon her my house she was decked and man how she was just so beautiful and it was remember he said i i was in awe i wondered he was just taken in awe but all of a sudden the spirit of god it begins to uncover all of her crosses all of her everything else her gold her scarlet it begins to uncover every bit of it and show that she is filled with the blood of the martyrs she herself that looks so beautiful that looks as though she saw it so struck john but once it was revealed to john where john was awestruck at one time he said i ain't going after that woman no more i'm courting her no more i sure am getting engaged to her i this has been uncovered you see what the spirit of god how precious the leading of the holy ghost is when we're praying and we're looking to god god will seek to it if our heart desires to walk in truth and desires to walk in the word the holy ghost is still a revealer and a discerner and he'll uncover things if we'll only look to him beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful and it works the same pattern it works to get into nations you realize when when satan took jesus and he shows him there in the temptations remember what he told him he said fall down and worship me and i'll give you all these kingdoms but let me just tell you something at one time they weren't his kingdoms you realize when every nation and everything started it did not always start out that they belong to satan but the bible would record how that lucifer himself weakens the nations he moves in what starts out like look at our own nation started out with real godly principles our constitution godly men think of this now men who sit there in the congress every year beginning on january 1st they would get a brand new bible and they would take and they would write in their bibles they would read their bible and after december 31st they would take that bible and give it to one of their family members that had their notes wrote in it but january 1st they would get another bible they would do the same thing look at this public school you know the reason public school came in these are things that you can go and read the reason public school came in is so that people children would learn to read the bible because the founding fathers believed they believed it like this they said if people will read the bible and it will be revered we will not need police officers oh my they weren't defunding they just were upholding the law but now i'm one that says don't you dare defund them we need them with all the lawlessness and everything else that's going on insanity among people but you see look where it's got to look how it comes in satan did not come in by a storm he comes in by deception or as the scripture says flatteries he comes in and flatteries and beauty he weakens the same way he comes to the nations is the same way that he did in heaven with those angels that third part of the stars that he led it's the same way that he came to eat he began to flatter her he began to touch her hand and he began to let her know this is a purpose you were made for let me just tell you something as a young person and anybody else don't you dare allow the enemy to interpret to you why you were made or your purpose or who you are let god's word let it be the defining factor of your life god god birthed you you were born a boy you are a boy you were born a girl you are a girl you'll stay a male you'll stay a female and served the very purpose and the economy of almighty god and god himself will teach you the purposes he'll guide you in every facet of your life if you'll look to him all those times where he has to correct us because everything is not about flatteries give you what you want let you do what you want but god is a faithful parent he's there to correct us he's there to point out if you go this way this is what's going to happen if you keep going this way why he's not interested in taking your life by flatteries that's to blow you up in the wrong way but god's interested in our character that it would be molded and shaped by his own glorious character it's a character and a life that'll stand the test of time glory be to god this was a kingdom that was based on appeal you know the bible that says the soul that sinneth that's who shall die the bible says sin is pleasurable for a season it's based upon beauty or that which is made easy the same way that he came to eve same way from heaven same way he moves into the nations it's the same way that he'll move upon a preacher and then we'll move from that preacher he'll move right into the congregation he'll move upon that daddy move right down into the home you see satan always comes in a way to want to weaken brother and sister if there's one thing that you and i should be able to stand there if there's anything that tries to weaken the prescription of god's holy word we can look at that and just as those true ephesians they could look at them in that day and said you are a false apostle you're not saying what paul said well you know but paul meant it like this you're a liar paul said it like this and i'm just gonna happen to say it and if you want to say it's his opinion i'll take his opinion over your opinion any day i'll stay with this word are you with me i look at those things so now we recognize of what that you and i are dialed into of how that the enemy would want to come in that manner you see he we we need to follow when that when these things are coming and we see it coming about this is the very things as we're saying it's time to cast it down when the enemy presents you with the thought cast it down don't you don't have to reason it out you don't have to prove nothing to that devil cast it out if listen when the word when something has rose in your mind i hope you're with me now those of you sometimes and every one of us we fight mind battles from time to time and there's things that that can come up but just remember this right here that when those things arise you remember as the enemy and as a spirit wanting to get you all worked up what must i do cast him out the bible says submit yourselves unto god that means come under the lord if there's anything that's out of line lord forgive me getting back in line then resist the devil and he will flee from you you know he's used to being cast out so we might as well keep it going he's used to being thrown out he was not given an escalator matter of fact you'll never read where satan descended the bible says he fell from heaven in revelations chapter 9 it says we saw him fall from heaven but when you read revelations 10 1 i saw a mighty angel descending down from heaven oh glory you know what it speaks that there is power and authority in humility through a life that will descend and submit itself to the word there's power to power to live a real life of authority that same beauty the same attribute think about it the very thing that god gave him lucifer could not say this thing that happened oh it's it's hurt me no he failed he failed right by allowing a thought to enter right and it started to blow now maybe that it started out new and it just blew up a little bit know it just started coming in the church and looking around thinking wow these real sorry people just keeps on going they look like they've got a lot of problems they've always got prayer requests they're always requesting the same thing maybe they don't have faith like i have and it just keeps who's doing that not god satan it's poison breath of satan you see this is why that the beauty or anything that god has given your eye things that we can even look at with beauty i'm not going to preach on that part of it tonight but to look at the things that god has given to you and i even things that can be within the natural it's things that you and i are to guard or to watch over even when it comes to you know a life that can have great spiritual understanding but it's to watch over that and don't allow things as we would say to go to your head because you see one of the very simplest things that you can look at you can think well this is something that's of god let me just give you just a little quote to kind of tease you with that thought a little bit on beauty brother brown tells us and how can i overcome he said just as satan propositioned jesus when he was on the mountain he said you started out sisters he said after god got a hold of your life you let your hair grow long he said then all of a sudden he said a little thought or a feeling came your way my i didn't know i looked so good with long hair he said right there satan is setting in to proposition you he said you must overcome that now isn't long hair that's that's god's word is that not that's the word of god in obedience to the word of god but it just goes to show that even in our obedience to the word of god it's that where we don't want to allow it to become a place that satan can blow and inflate air hallelujah now to think of this when we look here in the scriptures let's look at this here just for a moment when we look here at beauty and let me just kind of skip down here to ezekiel 16 verse 13. you can read the rest of the chapter when you get home but god is reminding israel here they are in captivity down in babylon he's reminding them of where he brought them from he's reminding them that even when you were born nobody cared for you nobody took you up you matter of fact you were sitting there in in your own blood but i passed by your way and i said live i said live i took you i washed you and god begins to move how did he begin to move with israel god provided for them their garments their attire god begins to let them know i was the god i'm the god who was right there with you the whole time in other words i'm the one who took you when you were nothing and i have provided for you as a faithful husband i have given to you all that you have need of and here he picks it up in verse 13 thou was depth with gold and silver thy raiment was a fine linen and silk embroidered work thou didst eat the flower and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful thou didst prosper into a kingdom they grew there into a kingdom and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comments you remove the commonness of the lord and the beauty is no longer renowned simply put brother banham said it like this in the church age book he said you take the spirit of god from the church and you've got nothing but a bejeweled corpse it's dead hallelujah so this is what what gives the church its beauty it's his comerness it's his life it's his glory it's not our works it's our yielding and his life it's him that takes us who was shameful who was ugly and he himself comes and he brings forth out of a situation of despair a situation that nobody would help us nor could they help us but he comes along and he takes a situation that everybody would have passed by on they would not have given a given anything for this spot of land but god said i know there's a seed on the inside there's a son or daughter there on the inside and his life been being imparted what does it do it brings forth the beauty of his holiness perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee you didn't merit it i put it upon it you yielded to me as my wife and i put my comeliness upon you but thou didst trust in thine own beauty get this beauty where did this beauty come from it come from god see they got to looking more at the gifts instead of the giver or they begin to look at things that were taking place instead of who it was that was doing it they began to look at it in a manner as though it was something that they had done and as soon as that took place in their heart it began to remove from god this is why the bible would say trust in the lord with all thine heart isaiah 14 i referred to this moments ago but i want you to look at this here once again here is isaiah by the spirit of god he's speaking to the spirit that's in the king of babylon and he's identifying the spirit how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of a morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mountain of the congregation you know one there's one big problem here i huge problem i i i i i in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high so as we looked at that the weakening it weakening it just starts to weaken to where he gains control beauty and little by little you see when we look at this brother adam would speak of it in this man i just want to refer this and he's tying this in with with this this this fall of satan he says he was the greatest person in the heavens outside of god he was god's right-hand man to fellowship and he got puffed up in his heart i want to just drop this in and leave this right here as we said moments ago you couldn't have gotten no closer to god than what he was right but yet he was so close to god but his heart went away and once his heart went away how did his heart go away it went into its own way and as soon as that happened then there was nothing left than for him to be cast out of heaven you see brother i'm saying ending like just about the same thing today he said god can bless a fellow put him put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a know-it-all he's got to start an organization or he's got to do something that's different god has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until god calls him to do something oh he said a man that god can bless and he'll still keep himself a man and not be an angel or a god temptations come are you with me but notice notice these these very parts of these things that we study and you look at it this is not god keeping him little it's up to the man to keep himself little it's up to you and i to keep ourselves in a place where god can use us is that right as soon notice as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him think of that given to him this is not even anything that that belongs to him or that he's done it's given to him like satan's beauty was he wants to become a god he wants to become an angel he wants to be some come some great person you know like what i do me and me and mine that's the wrong attitude god's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and the more he blessed the littler the man will become amen and then say lord right here lord right here that's my desire lord it's not just about lord i want more blessings lord help me to stay little help me to stay small notice he says you'll never get more of god until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself now that don't mean run yourself down that don't mean to think that doesn't mean to you know putting yourself down it means that you think less of yourself you've got to be little yourself lord i i need you look when the lord jesus come here is the son of god the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell in him in his testimony i can do nothing of mine own self but what the father showeth me the son doeth likewise he had authority but he was reserved in obedience to the father's will you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself god will bring a base he that will humble himself god will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as god will be big in you let's look at another king here one by the name of saul saul was not petitioning to be king he was not running around as a matter of fact he was hidden he was away but god pointed him out we know he was anointed by the prophet but i want you to notice these words and samuel said now this is after a time saul's now been been serving two three years he's been his king in the army he's there's been a lot of things that he said he's put a lot of fear a lot of scare tactics you know he's butchered the oxen sent them throughout all israel you follow me and if you don't follow me and samuel you're i'm going to cut you up like this god's people are not ruled by fear the bride is not ruled by fear it's by the love of god the love of god brings a fear but it's not an unclean fear the bible says the fear of the lord is clean is that right so the bride doesn't need to be put in fear to get in position it's the power of god that puts her in position she yields to his leading and she comes into position his son had won a great battle you know his son had jonathan had led you know against one of the garrisons and now once this battle has been won saul you know he wants to gather all of israel and now it comes time for there to be an offering about that time of the day of the evening there's to be an offering that's to be offered up and saw you know how the scripture goes he got a little nervous he said oh my goodness i did this has got to be done there's got to be an offering but you see if god god himself will never be late or miss one appointment god's never missed an appointment in the fulfillment of his word man has missed a lot of god's appointments but god has never missed one of his appointments so he finally saw he goes ahead and intrudes himself into the office and he offers offers up the sacrifice and now when samuel comes to him do you know all of the the report with the battle and that of amalek but i want to go right to this verse to where now samuel speaks to him and samuel says when thou was little in thine own sight this is where his this is saul's beginning it was a glorious glorious beginning little in his own sight but what happened he let his littleness get away from him and his littleness it removed to where now he was no longer little in his own sight and you know one of the telltale signs as god goes on to say what's thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed the king over israel notice one of the telltale signs was saul you'll find this this was the same thing that took place in heaven it's the same thing that begin to move all the way through is saul himself would report back to samuel and say i've obeyed the word of the lord i've done everything that the word told me to do but the real truth of the matter is is that he only did what he felt was important to do the rest of it he left undone he felt it wasn't important to kill the king again he felt you know the people they need sacrifices hey we need sacrifices to offer up you know to jehovah that's all reasoning the word of the lord says go and wipe every one of them out but because he refused the bible records it as the word came and just flatly said you've rejected the word of the lord god did not care if he obeyed 99 and nine tenths of it the one tenth is where god looked at him said because you denounced that one-tenth you have rejected the word of the lord you say well how can that be because the word is the person of jesus christ himself you take away one spec of the word you take away from god you've rejected the word of the lord how did he get to this place he no longer was little in his own eyes inside that may god help us let me look at another one just refer to this using a king in israel king of judah when you read this about uzziah you can read it later but this is one who walked according to the word of the lord the visions that came through zachariah the bible said this as long as he sought the lord the lord was with me you see it's just like what was spoken to saul god's not interested in the parts that we want to obey god said obedience is better than sacrifice there can be a lot of things that's done but god looks for obedience and obedience is there in the heart that's why paul could deal with them in romans and say you have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine that was delivered to you it's obedience that god values to his word and uzziah here was a man that was so instrumentally used of god he was a man as you can read there in ii chronicles 26 he was a man that stood on god's word as a 16 year old boy he was anointed king over judah he served in the kingdom 52 years and he sought god as long as he sought god god was with him he was stood even the political pressures in that time he stayed for the word of god it didn't matter what anybody else said around him you find where the army was built you find where military was built up jerusalem was built up you find the place of eloh was restored and built up many great things through this man's life and his tenure that was there but i want to remind you here of a scripture that it speaks in second chronicles chapter 26 verse 15. it says he made in jerusalem engines and let me go just to the last part of it and his name spread far abroad for he was marvelously helped till he was strong josiah how did you how did this come about how did this come about well you know i i have these abilities no you were marvelously helped how did you get where you were well you know i i just did this and i know you were marvelously helped the same marvelous help is the same one who does marvelous things god helped him why did god help him because he sought after god and as long as he sought after god god was with him that's a key he was seeking after god the bible says seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and then all these other things will be added to you let me just tell you something if you've got problems in your life if you try to seek to resolve them problems and you put them ahead of god's word let me just go ahead and tell you in the name of the lord you are not going to fix one thing because your approach to it is wrong it's against god's word god said seek ye first the word of god if there's something that you're doing that's not according to god's word don't ever expect for god to bless it god will marvelously help you he'll help me as long as we seek after him because when we're seeking after him it shows we need you lord we need your guidance we need your leadership we need your lord god every day he was marvelously helped till he was strong i wonder brother aaron till he was strong i wonder if this is something that god says i've helped you to a place josiah you're a good guy now you've been in the message for so long you know the quotes and you know this and i mean you know look at you you just you've just been in church for so long this was not god's thoughts because remember when we're strong it locks him out this is why paul can learn the glorious revelation when i am weak then i'm strong what does it mean to be weak to be brought into circumstances and situations where you recognize the frailty of human weakness that's god's grace to give unto you and i to help us master the thought of human ability if paul needed that grace how much more do you and i need he must marvelously help till he was strong but when he was strong not in the eyes of god in his own eyes his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense his to think of it he became inflated to such a place to where he no longer respected god's divine order you know why because he was out of order where did that out of order begin right in here because he got out from his place his position then he went over tried to take another place try to take another position now think of this you know brother brahman says some different things and i just want to just drop a few of these things because it really pertains to us he said it said god took an example like this he showed us god will bless a man that'll be true to the word of god right he said but he got to a place he started feeling self secured brother aaron you know no doubt feeling self security he probably was he didn't go to the temple and you know take up one of the incense and go to start offering that in prayer but it was it started out as a feeling he started feeling secure i wonder if it was that uzi thought i don't need to pray as much i've got a lot of victory i don't need to read as much i have a good understanding of the message now i've got more of the of a picture about it i don't have to study as much anymore then you ain't preaching to me you ain't preaching to me because when i realized of studying and continuing to lay to lay before god i cannot tell you you know what i'm talking about there's times you're listening to message after message after message sometimes some of the things when i'm preaching within a series i'll take certain messages and i've done this through the years i'll just keep listening and listen and listen and listen and listen and listen and listen and listen and just keep putting them on i'm not sitting there like this but i'm just listening and all of a sudden oh wow never heard it like that before or you'd be studying you see something you come across a man i never seen it like that before my i never heard it like that before that's god opening that up for you and me when we get to a spot but we feel like we don't need to pray as much and we don't need to read as much and be as dedicated we're feeling self-secure [Applause] god has never told us you're strong enough tell you what let me tell you how strong you are you don't got to come to church but about once a month you're a real strong fellow let me tell you the prophet said you can't be as good a christian outside a church as you can be inside a church now i know some people don't feel comfortable right now and they're streaming but i but i want you to understand this right here if you can be in the house of god and even when times resume and how things themselves would come about that's a choice that you and i are making hello somebody what happens is begin to feel a little secure and oh my that's the time to recognize let the word what should the word do it brings us to a place to discern that high thing that's exalting itself against the knowledge of god and cast it down because it's a spirit wanting to take away it starts out that's where you make your mistake yeah bram says you've got to continue look at this continue to serve god no matter what you was back 10 years ago it's what are you now you can't live off a past reputation what are you now must continue on in serving the lord oh my he he got to thinking brother around you know what would pick this up i i i want to read this statement brother m says it like this he says this king though being a godly man as he was he felt self-sufficient is that did you win those battles or did god help you did you build up this military did you build up that of jerusalem did you do that or did god equip you who was it that increased your name was it your skills that got you that position on the job or was it god come on somebody it's to remember who has marvelously helped you his marvelous help does not make us when we can really it brings us to a realization i need you lord i need you more now than i ever needed you lord jesus said let us always remember we're under god we're under his word you know he got the feelings secure is this okay but the brahman said he uses these words and i like to follow this how the prophet is laying this in describing these thoughts he said he got the feeling secure he just absolutely felt anchored like i can't go nowhere listen to these words there's no way for him to ever fall no way there's no way for me to ever fall you better get a checkup and to recognize it's the grace of god upon our life brother branham would say it like this in this measure when he's talking about it because somebody was criticizing another another minister talking with uzziah as well brother brownwood said you must remember man cannot order himself god ordered his man god makes you what you are any man any man is subject to mistakes he is subject to error because he is human he's subject to the violations of god's law he's subject to many things because satan tempts him and he's just a human being and if god ever lifted his hands he would fall you hear this if god ever lifted his hands he would fall i don't know about you but i want to stay in a place that invites his hands to be all over my life i don't want to move to a place to where it's now you feel self-secure little things you start doing that you would never do before things you would never you would check your attitude before but now you let it go on check you used to pray fervently but no longer praying fervently anymore i want to be in his hands i want my life i don't want to live with that false feeling i'm anchored that's all win with no sales that's it has no substance behind it because i find contrary with apostle paul saying i press toward the mark of the high calling paul would say like this let me bring it into the context of how it's wrote i bring my body under subjection in other words beat it black and blue i'm not missing when i'm jabbing it he wants to raise up and i am swinging i am all of these things that could rise up i'm swinging at it lest i myself should be a castaway let me finish this quote if god ever lifted his hands he would fall but bremen said i've heard people say oh satan can't do that he said you let god lift his hand one time and you watch what happens i constantly plead god don't send him have mercy on me keep him away from me you see i need god's mercy and we all constantly pleading lord i need you let me just leave you with this can i give one more example in the book of deuteronomy i'm not gonna i'll just refer to it you can read it you know home devotions and so forth but not a deuteronomy 8 god told them just as simply it starts like this when you come in the land when you've eaten an art full give thanks unto the lord amen begins to go through his blessing upon the land his blessing upon their flocks blessing upon their homes but once again he would come back around don't forget the lord he said lest when you're full what happens when you get full it doesn't matter if you're fat or skinny what happens when you get full you get a little sleepy is that right some of you afraid to say it but it's true sometimes you can get you know especially after we get done with maybe a thanksgiving dinner christmas dinner you get done with that and you think oh man you just you know you're just laden with turkey gravy and you're ready to go back and go to sleep you're full but you see when you get full it can also come a great danger you can get relaxed things are provided it's going a little bit easier things are a little bit easier it's a little nicer got a little bit more but that's a time when we have to guard i don't think there's anybody here in this room that many times that we can look at that you can see things i can see from my own from my own perspective i can remember at times with things from from my parents and what they had to do with and and the things that was before us i remember how things were you remember back there in the early 80s you know many of you remember that of how the interest rates on houses and things like that it was in double digits and the democrat wasn't even in office well maybe that's when it was but you understand i mean here you had these things and they were so in that place you couldn't afford nothing things were different but look at it in a time a time of where things are a little bit maybe a little bit more plenteous not that anybody living high on the hog but you understand what i'm saying when things big themselves you get to a place of where it's full you don't need to pray as much as you need a lot of times you don't need to move as much as you did at other times but remember that is false security we need god more now than we ever did material things do not make life easier if you're not careful material things will tie up more of your time are you with me it shows how we need god's leadership we need his direction this word forget is to where we cease to care things we just start to kind of give away god brother brown talks about uzziah and different things you know come in god wouldn't mind this and god won't mind this but we need to stay fervent amen before god fervent in our lives that every one of us that when satan wants to try to present a thought high thing to cast him down amen this is why brother branham just closed here this is why brother bram said you watched he said a family he said here's a family he said god will take a family he said and god will bless him he said he'll fill their lives with the holy spirit and he said pretty soon he says you know he says they'll finally they'll move out of the neighborhood they were in maybe he says now they maybe have a nicer house and now he said instead of them driving he said maybe old junkie cars they drive nicer cars they you know they used to drive the cars that you had to pray to get to the store now you have to pray to find out how to turn them on how to turn them off is that right you know well which tire the one i got to inflate and this and that you see how things change it becomes so much more convenient you don't have to look at your tires it'll just let you know the dummy bells will go off left front tire fill it with air used to be before you had to check those things and look at it that tire needs a little bit of air right there now it just goes off you need air it's more convenient ah you don't have to look go down and get the paper to see the weather just pick up your phone from your nightstand but don't anybody start drawing up on me now it's convenience what does convenience do if we're not ignorant of satan's devices it's not saying that those things are wrong it's to recognize within this time right here we need god more now than we ever did he has marvelously helped us and it's going to be his marvelous grace that gets us out of here amen we need his help every day of our life every time when we come to the house of god we need his marvelous god said if you obey my word i'll be an adversary to your adversaries i'll take up your part we want to stay in that place stay in that place with god and having fellowship see how so suddenly these things can just you can just move in just something just right there in the heart a little security a little feeling little things that let go unchecked listen i'm not trying to here tonight the spirit of god ain't trying to come down on you but it's it's bringing us to an awareness of where we're at in this time it's a time to really evaluate our life it's a time to evaluate in the midst of it and it's a time that you and i are given this stewardship god will not will not do this for us this is why he speaks to us the way he does like this this evening and he lets us know don't become less watchful but watch and pray watch and pray look to him he's the one who's guiding us he's the one directing us we need him of all that god has revealed we need him more now we need him to continue to reveal his word to our lives we need his leadership now it's not a time to abandon the holy ghost we need the holy ghost more than ever we need the angel of the lord more than ever we need to depend on him more than ever we need the wall of fire round about us more than ever we need you i think as the musicians would come as we would go in prayer would you play that song i need thee lord i need lord jesus how we appreciate you lord your god truly i believe the lord that i can speak on behalf of the hearts lord of your children those that are gathered here those that are gathered lord god by way of the internet those that will archive this service lord may you help us help us the lord that we not become relying or relying upon ourselves lord it's so easy for us to say that but it's something lord god that it's how we display that we can we could all i think every one of us would say well no i don't rely upon myself but i wonder lord do we pray like we used to pray are there things that we seek your face about or do we just take it for granted that we know you well enough oh god i pray here tonight lord jesus may dear god there be a real renewing in our hearts [Music] i pray father may any feeling of self-security feeling lord god strong in ourselves [Music] may we just show god by the authority of the word may we cast down that imagination may we cast down that high thing and say no i will not be taken with the spirit of this age that says i'm rich and have need of nothing i need the lord jesus lord i need you every day of my life i need you in the decisions that i make not only not only when it comes to spiritual decisions but lord in the natural i need you lord god to guide me i realize that i must make decisions but oh i want to be under your influence there's things that you can see but god i believe this with all my heart whether it comes to buying a house buying a car whatever it might be i believe lord god is a witness the will of god is always accompanied by the peace of god i'm a witness to that lord i'm a witness lord to things lord that no matter what could be painted out to be a real nice picture of something lord but you know if there's problems behind it you know that lord god even in relationships on the job you know that lord god of things lord that can be right around us may we trust not our own eyes but may we lord god look to your eyes as your prophet would tell us that prayer itself is the radar screen of the believer it shows up the enemy's whereabouts [Music] as it moves around god granted i pray there's not one believer lord god there's not one of us lord not one that would say lord that we lord could say within ourselves that we feel secure we feel strong for that so anchored i'm so anchored that i could not fall but oh god [Music] we look to you lord it's your grace that we need lord jesus it's your grace lord and we stand just like the prophet would stand there i constantly plead keep him away from me lord keep satan away from me lord keep him away from me lord don't ever take your hands off of my life lord may our hearts lord may our hearts welcome you in simple obedience lord to your word welcoming you lord welcoming your hands lord grant it lord i pray lord if there's one here tonight or on the way of the internet the lord they've tried to do this on their own maybe there's things they've tried to offer to you a great beauty may they realize the lord jesus it's not the things it's not the works [Music] our works that you delight in but it's yielding lord our lives to you [Music] it's yielding lord and you coming and inviting you to come in and really transform our lives may they lord jesus just lay aside all the works the things that lord that they would be trying to do and may they just yield themselves to you and say lord i want to accept the lamb that's been provided for me you've been provided for me lord there's a lamb for me you are my sacrifice lord jesus the blood that's been provided for me the holy spirit god's own life that's been provided [Music] that i can be transformed into a son and daughter of god [Music] fashioned according to his own image granted lord hear tonight lord no matter what it is lord at home life on the job no matter what it is lord god i pray may we lord jesus

daughter or my wife or my husband god give us leadership help us lord jesus we need you lord grant it lord i pray in the name of jesus christ amen oh my you're more welcome to stand if you'd like to
