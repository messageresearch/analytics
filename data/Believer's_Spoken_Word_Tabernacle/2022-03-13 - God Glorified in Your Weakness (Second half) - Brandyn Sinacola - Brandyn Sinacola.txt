TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because you're good you're wrong god gave you two hands that can work god gave you a mind that can think god gave you feet to walk and carry you there god gave you a vehicle to get you there trust me i've been there where you're thinking lord i need a vehicle i don't know what i'm going to do with this thing it's falling apart there was one time we pulled into my parents driveway and from the end of the driveway up probably longer than from here to the back of the church there that mirror in the back the muffler fell off and there were pieces all the way up the driveway lord i don't just keep driving but god god gives us the ability god gives us the strength spiritually it's it's god who causes us to grow and and and so when you're talking to these believers when you talk to brother bill and different ones they they're they're giving god the glory he gave them the ability he gave them the success he gave the blessing and he gets all the glory now i i i was thinking about this just through some conversations back home that have happened recently and i thought you know we we you may be sitting here this morning and you may have been in the message all your life you may be just coming into the message but we might need god we do need god but i'm just saying this morning you may need god to bring you the truth of the message even though you've been in it for years you you something something maybe you're new here this morning and something's drawn you to the ministry here and and maybe maybe you don't know exactly what it is but you know it's truth coming forward but yet you feel you you just feel like there's so much for you to learn sitting here this morning and yet it's it's it's god that drops the truth into your heart by revelation you could try all you want you could read your bible from from morning till night from now until christ comes and it'll do you no good unless the author drops what he wrote into your heart and he can't use what you think about it you know i was thinking about this too we we've got we've got you know there's a lot of old-timers in the church but there's a lot of young bucks that have come up too and and god can't use what you think about the message god can't use what you think about the scripture god will give inspiration i'm not trying to take away from that but just make sure that it's of god and not of an arrogance that you know i've been in this thing and and you know this this young brother he's he's boring me because he's not talking about the deep things of god i can tell you you're off track right there not because you're thinking i don't care that you think that about me it because i know where the truth of it is and that's that god god has to reveal that to you you can't bring that to god and say god this is what you this is what you meant through the message and this is none of these ministers are right lord what i'm i'm right and they're all wrong you've crossed confidence and you've gotten into arrogance you know one of the reasons that the prophet gives actually the reason he gives in this message perfect strength by perfect weakness he gives the reason that we come to church and and i'll give you a scripture to back it up says the bible says judgment begins at the house of god and and i want to drop this in because i want to challenge our thinking this morning of your reason why you're here this morning why did you come to church some come to get a pat on the back and then they'll leave disappointed but the prophet said that we come to church to find out what our faults are and the things that we might better ourselves by and to find our bad places to find our bad places and you say that's a terrible reason to come to church but but remember what i'm preaching this morning is that through your weakness god is made strong and so we find our faults so that we can grow in those areas and so that we can bring those things to god so that we can grow and be who god wants us to be it's it's it's maybe you feel like man this minister is really pointing out my weaknesses but god is pointing them out because he wants you to bring that to him so that he can make it a strength in your life so that he can be strong through you and and and we receive encouragement coming to church and we receive correction and we we receive building up but sometimes god might have to tear down what you've built up yourself so that he can build the right foundation so that he could build the right building so that he can use the right materials for the building and so so often you know sometimes we can come to church and and you know we we think we got it all together and and you know lord lord i really need i i need encouragement this morning lord and then the minister comes and you think lord i still need encouragement this morning but just just really lock into what's what's being said and to the heart of what's being said because because you know when when i come and i know that i know that the ministers you know brother sam and and our hearts desire is that our heart beats in unity and harmony with what god's heart is if i none of this i listen i'll open the door i'll throw my ipad out if this is of myself because i don't want to bring anything that's of my own mind and on my own heart i i you know in study god will drop things you know even i preached this wednesday at home but in in going back through my notes and praying lord what would you have for this congregation i'm i'm deleting stuff and adding stuff and and god's just taking me down past and i think lord i'm i'm just gonna trust you that this is this is what you have for this people because i don't i don't know their situations i don't need to know your situation and and i have a heart for your situation but what i want is i want god to step into that situation not brandon synacola because like i said i when i look at myself i don't see much but but if god can use me and god can speak to you then that's all's that matters and you this is just maybe my uh my calling in life um uh you know it's just i i think i've mentioned it before my burden for for my pastor back home and and it's for the congregation and i feel that for brother sam this morning too is i just i have a burden and and you know brother paul back home gave me you know he calls me assistant pastor and i and i really appreciate that and it means a lot and and so these things get on my heart though pertaining to pastors and and maybe i couldn't say it back home because i because i know of certain situations but i don't know of your situation so i'm just going to say a couple things this morning if we come to church to find out where our bad parts are and i want to say one more thing about that we find out where those are but i want you to remember i remember what i spoke on last time the scripture i took was bala took balaam around to the hindu parts of israel to the bad parts of israel and when he went to go speak a curse god spoke a blessing and he said i don't see what you're saying he said i see him justified that's how god sees you and your weaknesses this morning but if we come to church to find out where those bad places are and where our weaknesses are and with the things we need to shore up and things then you have to have confidence that the man bringing the word is your pastor and and one of the services i listened to that that really spoke to me in in just different conversations and and you know things with my pastor and the way i was feeling at the time and then i overheard a brother tell my pastor at a minister's meeting we had and he said you know this is a really good service that i can't remember the conversation how it got brought up because it was so it was just a quick comment and he said abel ministers brother harold beckett family camp and i thought i got to find that so i went and i found it and as i'm listening i'm realizing lord this is everything that i feel called to this is this is my calling lord and but in there he said a lot of things that i just thought was so good and one of the things is you have to know who your pastor is and you have to be able to receive what he's bringing behind the pulpit because if if we come to church to see our bad spots and you resent that man you'll never receive it you have to know who your pastor is you have to know that this man has your very best interest in mind and if you don't have that if you if you if you sit in your seat and you resent the man then you need to pray about where to go to church because not only do you hurt yourself if you have a family you're going to hurt your family don't ever talk about a minister in front of your family you may have to have conversations between you and your wife but never do that in front of your kids because there may be some day when god needs to use that man to speak to your kid but because you bad-mouth that man god can't use him because you remember what the prophet said that the she-bears came out and they destroyed those kids because they were making fun of the prophet of god and the prophet our prophet for this day said that was because the parents at home badmouthed them [Applause] so maybe i've said those things before but i just felt to put it in here again because we have to have confidence in the man and know that god has given us this gift behind this pulpit to tell us our if we're going to receive him telling us where our where our our weaknesses are so the prophet said any other objection by coming to church and we don't get much out of it you won't get much out of church unless you come to realize where your bad spots are that's that's a little bit hard to swallow ain't it you can't come to be seen you can't come to be heard it don't matter how loud you say amen if you're wanting to be heard then it don't you're coming for the wrong reason you can't come to show off the new dress you can't come to show off the new suit or to see so and so you know if if you got a little uh liking going on with the with the brother or sister in the church then then you know if that's the only reason you come to church that's a good benefit to come into the church i'm not gonna lie but if that's the only reason you're coming to church you're coming for the wrong reason let me give you young young men and any any singles in the church a little advice if you come to serve god and to get closer to christ and and you come for these right reasons you'll attract the right mate you'll attract the right character character draws character and if you're coming just to be seen you're coming just to see her then then brother she's going to pick up on that because you're not coming for the right reason if we come for some religious obligation or or to get a good feeling because you know you go to a camp meeting because it's just it's it's the glory it's it's the hurah from the glory days you know we want to go back to the glory days and and have the camp meetings again and and so you go or or maybe you stay home from service regular service but you know camp meeting i'm in i'm in i remember the glory days i'm into the camp meeting so you come to church and you know it's like it's like a a uh you know we we always say you come to church on easter and christmas you know but but you know you're coming for a religious something you know religious some religious reason that you're going to come because of a camp meeting but so i just asked you this morning why do you come to church and that's just for you to reflect on in your heart so i said you know if if we're new to christianity or we're new to the message don't try to figure everything out the bible says the holy ghost will teach you if you've been in the message for years and you realize lord i need a change there's something i'm not viewing this the way i should don't try to figure it out call on the holy ghost because james 1 verse 5 if you want a scripture for that says does anyone lack wisdom let them ask of god who gives it freely and it shall be given to them so let me let me just see if i can get off arrogance and things and we'll get back to weaknesses when we feel we know everything whether it's because we've been in churches or in the message all of our lives god has to take us on the backside of the desert where we can learn human weakness moses and and paul if anybody had bragging rights in the bible it was moses and paul just you know moses i i i never quite heard him say this before and until i was listening to this message but brother branham said you know in the in the movie of the ten commandments he said you know moses he's this you know got big arms and stuff and he said i imagine that's what moses looked like because he said he was he was brought up under in the palace of pharaoh and you know strong man and military leader and could teach the teachers and things you know but yet god said i can't use any of that and that's a little bit discouraging because he took him on the back side of the desert for 40 years to get out of him lord let me be like paul if you got to get anything out let it only be three but the prophet says this and then the other side we get these feelings and we think that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of god that's the very thing that god wants to get us into that that kind of shape so we can he says in another spot he says if you get to think in that way too much then you'll never do nothing because you're focusing on your weaknesses at that point if i focus on my weaknesses i'll sit down i just i'm i got nothing but but you can't focus you can take you can take either side arroga or or looking at yourself too much he says when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to god's spirit this is a big part i believe is when we realize we're insufficient then we're subjects to yield to god's spirit as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to the place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it so then if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but we'll if we'll just yield ourselves to god then god can't fail there's only one thing god cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail but he cannot fail he says whenever you get licked and realize you're licked and then come back come come on back and humble yourself get weak find out you're human and there's none of your intellectuals can do it human weakness will never be used of god god by the human weakness pours himself into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument certainly you've got to get yourself out of the way i want to read that last part just one more time because there's so much said there human weakness will never be used of god god by the human weakness pours himself into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument certainly you've got to get yourself out of the way you can't bring your sin to god and say god use this it'll never work but sometimes god will use that sin so that you realize how weak you are and then they'll say okay now you're humble now i can use you he'll use those things he'll let those things happen hard to believe but i believe he'll let those things happen so that you humble yourself and then he can use you so are you with me still second corinthians 12. second corinthians 12 and verse 6 for though i would desire to glory so if you ever want to read something good go back and read chapter 11 and chapter 12 because like i said if anyone had bragging rights it was paul and paul actually had to take the opportunity to brag a little bit because the corinthian church there were men who were bragging and the corinthian church was gravitating towards them and paul says okay you want to follow the man who has bragging rights here i come rolls up his sleeves and just lays it all out everything he's been through and he keeps saying though he keeps saying you know bear with me in my folly this is this is foolish to do but i gotta do it because other men are trying to come in and steal your heart but he says for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest i should be exalted above measure though the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice and that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for this is how god works for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmity in reproach and necessities in persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong then am only them am i strong paul could have come with the abundance of wisdom that he had in the training and the teaching that he had with with great words to to wow the people and he said i didn't come in any of that but i came in the power and the demonstration of the gospel because i got all of me out of me and let god take over and then through all of that revelation that god just started opening even everything that he had known about the message prior god had to burn all of that out of him reteach him and even in all of that revelation god gives him a little bit of an affirmative to help keep him humble to help keep him humble because god needed paul to stay humble so that he could continue to use him because when paul would realize you know lord this this thing and brother branham said it buff it as like a waves on a ship it would come and then it would go and it would come and paul would pray and then it would go and then it would come and paul would pray and it would go and it's just this this thing that was always in paul's life and and lord why is this what can't you take this from me and and christ speaks to him and he says listen that's there because if it wasn't there you'd get a little too big-headed and i need you to stay humble i need you to i need you to get low every now and then so that you realize that that you're that you're you stay humble so i can be strong in your life the greek dialogue said it like this and this was just really neat my favor is sufficient for power is perfected in weakness power is perfected in weakness when we recognize our weaknesses we can turn them over to the lord we recognize we need his help and we surrender that area in our life to him and then his power comes in and perfects that spot but you have to recognize it and not just waller in it and oh i'm so low and i'm so downtrodden by this thing then you take it to god god this is in my life god this is how i feel about myself but i just want to get out of the way and lord i pray that that you would help me be humble and that you would you would step in and be my strength i need you to take this area of my life time's going quick from my standpoint so hopefully it is from yours too we're almost done here when he was weak then he become strong yes sir he shut the heavens this is elijah that it would rain that's when he got strong when he lost his church lost everything he had everything else but he stayed with god's word then he had power to shut the heavens when jacob lost all his strength then god gave him power to become a prince see when paul lost his education in all his theology god made him a missionary to the gentiles when moses lost all of his ability and become weak god made him powerful and sent him to egypt in the power of the spirit at 80 years old whiskers hanging down his wife on a mule in a young and sitting on her lap and and a stick in his hand went down and conquered egypt yeah see not with an army behind him like he wanted to go but in the power of the spirit amen sometimes in your weakest time is when jesus comes and the weakest of moments that's when jesus comes when you've lost your spouse and you feel weak when you've lost a little one and you feel sad god will come by and give you strength jesus said blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted you have to know mourning before you can no comfort when you when you've lost your job and you're losing your home and your vehicle god will make you strong it's hard to it's when you're going through it you even despise the man saying that but god will come on the scene and he'll give you strength to go through that there's there's a reason there's a purpose there's a brother lost lost his job they just tried to move him out and you know get him to quit and he and he wouldn't he just gave his very best and so they laid him off and he said you know the timing of that was perfect because even in the meeting before the day before he said i learned things that i could put on my resume that happened for growth in the company really under you know the help of his leadership in in some of the areas so he was able to put that on his resume and then he had a job he really wanted to get and he didn't end up getting it and come to find out a friend who's working there said things are going down the tube in this company all of a sudden so he said it it may just be the lord you didn't get that job the friend didn't say that but you know we're we're saying that to him encourage him confess your weakness the prophet said but confess your faith in god and his strength and his word we got to empty ourselves we got to empty our vessels empty what we know empty what we think and just say god here i am i i'm here lord to present myself to you and i know that there's nothing more that i can do would you wash me and dress me in your righteousness and until you're finally through lord i'm still going to come and present myself to you because i need you if you think you have strength just closing comments here if you think you have strength you can stand to your feet you'll take your own way of doing it you have to realize you're weak so you'll take up what god has given you to be strong so if you're looking at your own strength you'll pick that up and and i actually i heard this in the greatest battle ever fought brother branham made the comment he says you can't even sin until you lay god's word down so you actually if you think you're strong in your own strength what you'll do is you'll actually lay down your strength and you'll pick up what you feel is your strength and your weapon you know in in in samson's hand under the power of god an old dried-up donkey jawbone could bash in inch thick brass helmets but if samson would have went in his own strength it would have been it would have turned to dust as soon as he picked it up he wouldn't have had nothing to fight with but under the power of god he picked up what god had placed in his hand and god gave him strength with it and you know i i just just in the last maybe closing comments i'm going to skip some of my last comments here is when you look at the different lives in in hebrews 11 you look at gideon where was gideon when the angel of the lord came to him hiding behind the well i believe it was and not only that but then he sees an angel and he sees an angel and then he says you know gives them all of his excuses all of his weaknesses lists them out and then he says you know the angel says but you're a mighty man of valor i'm going to use you and he says um i know you're an angel but i need a sign and then the sign happens and he goes well praise the lord [Music] i see i've seen an angel i've been given one sign i think i need another sign and yet god used gideon as a judge of israel and not only that with all of that with with disbelieving the word of god god puts them over in the hebrews and then you look at barack and barack i don't know i i had to kind of refresh myself and this is interesting and and uh you know your sisters if you don't see this yet then just bear with me forgive me but barack a prophetess come to him a woman prophet and she said god's gonna use you you're gonna go defeat the enemy and here's barack i i imagine you know just maybe built you know i don't know i don't know if he was a general in the army or what you know but it just you know god's going to use you go and take the enemy and barack says okay okay all right but you have to come with me [Music] so he tells this woman brothers you tell your wife i'll go serve the lord but only if you come with me and if you don't come with me i'm not gonna serve the lord and she says okay i'll go with you but you don't get any glory in this and yet barack being led by a woman ends up over in hebrews look at the weakness of the man no no spine no backbone and yet he ends up in hebrews so my main theme my main heart what i believe god's heart was and through this message and hopefully it's been made clear by now but is though you're weak you're strong though you have all these faults and things and you just you struggle along and you and you just feel like i can't make it and and and and though you have days of sadness yet god will make you strong you know you're already there in god's eyes i i i god will make you strong he'll give you he'll give you he'll let your theophany right because your theophany is already though this tabernacle be destroyed we already have one waiting in the presence of god your theophany will come and no no this is who you are this is who you are brother this is who you are this is who you are and you'll be given strength from on high so i pray i pray this encourages you i pray that this shows you where your weak spots are and i pray that you leave knowing that god is bigger than you are god is greater than your mistakes god's greater than your strengths and god's going to lead us through amen god bless you let's uh maybe brother if you sing something i'll pray after you sing dear lord i'll be a witness if you will have my weakness i know that i'm not worthy lord [Music] my eyes of faith i see thee upon the cross of calvary dear lord i pray let be thy servant [Music] jesus use me lord surely there's a work that i can do [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll stand for you dear jesus i'll spread the gospel to the lost each day

and lord even yet still god i still feel so insufficient but lord i pray god that through my weakness lord that you would be made strong this morning that the sheep lord would feel fed and full and
