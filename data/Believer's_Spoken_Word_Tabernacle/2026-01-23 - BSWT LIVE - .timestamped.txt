[29:25] to carry
[29:30] everything

[29:39] And oh,

[29:48] Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[29:55] Thank you, Lord.

[32:43] the Lord in prayer
[32:46] and his arms he'll take and shield
[32:52] thee. Oh, I
[32:56] will find a soulless there. One more
[33:00] time. What a friend. Oh,

[33:20] What a privilege
[33:24] to
[33:28] Oh,
[33:30] everything to God.
[33:49] Praise the Lord.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Pardon me as dealing with an update here
[33:57] and it's a little different for me. Um,
[34:01] I want to u just certainly want to say
[34:04] uh how we so appreciated the meetings
[34:07] this weekend
[34:08] &gt;&gt; and God was so good to us and just uh
[34:11] the word of the Lord was so uh so rich
[34:14] and
[34:15] &gt;&gt; you know there's many um areas sometimes
[34:18] that we God will have us to uh traverse
[34:22] through once again and come through and
[34:26] uh everything is always on time. Amen.
[34:30] With God. And God knows just what what
[34:32] what you and I what we have need of. And
[34:35] um we so thank so thank God for brother
[34:38] Trevor being here with us and just what
[34:41] a great blessing it was and great
[34:42] encouragement. Amen. And so um uh we
[34:46] also I want to uh remind you uh to
[34:51] continue to keep Sister Rachel in prayer
[34:54] as well. Sister Rachel Atkins. Um, I
[34:57] realized last week I called her sister
[34:59] Rachel Hannah.
[35:02] I'm glad brother Ryan didn't come
[35:04] through the phone and
[35:06] just my mind I I I but but everyone knew
[35:09] and but I am so thankful for how God's
[35:12] grace and bringing her through. Brother
[35:14] Ryan was just just texting me of how
[35:17] that um still a little dizzy and a
[35:20] little nausea. And so sometimes, you
[35:22] know, with the healing process, uh we
[35:25] don't know exactly how all of those
[35:26] things um are are to work out, but we
[35:30] know one thing that God is still in
[35:32] control. And and God is one as he's seen
[35:35] Peter all the way outside the city. He's
[35:38] the same God to see sister Rachel all
[35:40] the way through this. Amen. So, we want
[35:42] to just continue to hold her up in
[35:44] prayer uh just as diligently as we were
[35:47] when the requests were going out on the
[35:49] thread. And um also want to ask you to
[35:54] uh remember brother Jeremy Shriner and
[35:57] brother Danny Stemann in prayer. They um
[36:00] have arrived in India there yesterday
[36:02] and they're going to be there in uh
[36:04] India for about 12 days and ministering.
[36:08] So, we want to just remember remember
[36:10] them and um the Lord will just use them
[36:13] in a in a very great way to be a
[36:14] blessing to uh the bride in that part uh
[36:18] where where God would have them to
[36:20] minister. And also, I know you I think
[36:22] Paul said something about this coming
[36:24] weekend, just try to stay alert.
[36:27] So, um you know, uh sometimes when we've
[36:30] um I think it was last Thursday when we
[36:32] had to cancel, you know, I uh you I had
[36:35] to get out and do some things. Uh I was
[36:37] out on the roads and looking. I said,
[36:39] "Man, maybe I think we might have been
[36:40] able to pull through on this one, you
[36:42] know." But you you know, at the same
[36:44] time, I I know sometimes you get it
[36:46] right, sometimes you don't, and
[36:47] sometimes you wear on the side of
[36:48] caution, but what I was really concerned
[36:50] about because there were certain roads
[36:52] last week that when I started coming
[36:54] closer going north on 58, the roads were
[36:58] horrible. So, it just went from clear
[37:00] blacktop to where you had cars just
[37:03] pushed over.
[37:04] to my wife. I said it was just like
[37:05] something changed just like that going,
[37:07] you know, past Bob Evans, Chick-fil-A,
[37:09] and things like that. So, um, but
[37:11] anyhow, you know, we're we're thankful
[37:13] that God permitted that we could have
[37:15] service in the weekend. So, just be
[37:17] alert for that. Just be watching, you
[37:19] know, there on the phone. And, um, you
[37:21] know, we're not going to keep you
[37:23] guessing till 10:00 a.m. in the morning.
[37:26] We won't do that because just like uh
[37:28] Sister Stephanie and I see she's not
[37:30] here this evening but sister Stephanie
[37:32] is one she told me she said if you have
[37:34] any inclination let me know because she
[37:35] said I'm I'm leaving at about 6:30 in
[37:37] the morning on Sunday to make the way
[37:39] there because she she comes in here and
[37:41] she cleans and uh and uh so same thing
[37:45] on Thursday. So we'll try to be really
[37:48] on top of that and looking at it. Amen.
[37:50] Well, let's just stand and
[37:54] we'll just see how this how this runs
[37:56] here.
[37:58] So, let's um let's go here to Romans
[38:00] chapter 5,
[38:15] Brian. I don't know if I'm doing it
[38:17] correctly or not. um
[38:22] either screen mirroring. It's it just
[38:24] was a new update. So maybe in my um go
[38:28] back in my Benjamin, go back in my bag
[38:31] and on one of the cases you'll find my
[38:32] my mini and just bring that out to me.
[38:37] I didn't just do this, by the way. This
[38:40] was uh I've had this here before me, but
[38:43] um
[38:44] so Romans chapter 5 and just uh let's
[38:48] maybe have to bear with me here till we
[38:50] can get that out here and get that other
[38:52] part hooked up. Romans 5 and I want to
[38:54] read just five verse of scripture there.
[38:58] Uh therefore being justified by faith,
[39:02] we have peace with God through our Lord
[39:05] Jesus Christ, by whom also we have
[39:09] access by faith into this grace wherein
[39:14] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[39:17] glory of God. And not only so, but we
[39:22] glory in tribulations also,
[39:26] knowing that tribulation workketh
[39:29] patience, and patience experience,
[39:33] and experience hope, and hope maketh not
[39:37] ashamed, because the love of God is shed
[39:41] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
[39:45] which is given unto us.
[39:48] Amen. So, thank you. So, I want to maybe
[39:52] look here just tonight and I'd like to
[39:55] just speak on a thought on accumulation
[39:57] of godly
[39:59] confidence. So, let's just go to the
[40:02] Lord in a word of prayer tonight and
[40:04] let's just look to him. Our heavenly
[40:07] father,
[40:09] Lord, we are so thankful God for your
[40:12] mindfulness and your faithfulness, Lord,
[40:14] through every part of our lives, Lord.
[40:18] And we just, Lord, commit, Lord, every
[40:21] part of this service now into your
[40:23] hands. We thank you, Father, for just
[40:26] the the time, Lord, to gather and to
[40:29] worship, Lord. Oh, God, for our worship,
[40:33] Lord, it's it's not in vain. We are
[40:35] worshiping Lord with a thanksgiving from
[40:38] our heart for God the grace that you
[40:41] have God given to our lives and just to
[40:44] see what you are doing Lord and Father
[40:47] you're working in our lives oh God how
[40:50] we so thank you Lord even as we pour
[40:54] through Lord those Lord what you spoke
[40:57] to us this weekend Lord how we are so
[41:00] grateful Lord for your love and your
[41:02] care Lord we thank you father for every
[41:05] one of the gifts, Lord, that you have
[41:07] sent, Lord, to us. We need them, Lord.
[41:10] And we, Father, are so thankful, God,
[41:13] for your mercy. We ask that you would
[41:15] just be with the different needs, Lord.
[41:16] Sister Rachel, continue to give her
[41:19] strength in her body. I know Brother
[41:21] Rocco, Lord, still recovering, Lord, in
[41:23] his body. And, oh God, different needs,
[41:27] Lord, among us. May you just, Lord,
[41:29] minister to each one, God. May you give
[41:32] strength, I pray, Lord, to your
[41:34] children. Lord, be with brother Jeremy,
[41:36] Brother Danny Steamman there, Lord. May
[41:38] you, oh God, just give them such a a
[41:41] strength, Lord, physically and oh God,
[41:44] just use them, Lord, as channels, Lord,
[41:47] God, to minister, Lord, to those needs
[41:50] that would be present there, Lord. that
[41:52] it would be so undeniable Lord that God
[41:56] that you have been mindful and your care
[41:59] and Father for what you have done Lord
[42:02] all the glory will go to you. We ask
[42:05] Lord for your blessings now upon the
[42:06] remaining part of the service. Lord, I
[42:09] pray God together that myself and the
[42:11] congregation. We want to be just one
[42:14] with you, Lord. And just help us, Lord.
[42:16] I pray tonight that we can so get out of
[42:18] the way, Father, that God, that the
[42:21] thought that you've placed in our hearts
[42:23] could just be conveyed, Lord, by you.
[42:25] That would be my desire, Lord. May you
[42:28] come, Lord, the spirit of truth and just
[42:30] speak to our hearts now in Jesus
[42:32] precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[42:36] as you're being seated.
[42:55] So I want to uh look here here in this
[43:00] um in this moment from the uh looking at
[43:05] that thought on accumulation of godly uh
[43:08] confidence because
[43:11] we know that even as we walk on in our
[43:14] journey uh with the Lord Lord, that
[43:16] there is is a confidence. And when you
[43:20] think of confidence, I want you to think
[43:22] of trust. And I want you to think also
[43:26] faith. And I want you to think of love
[43:28] because it all uh works to great works
[43:30] together in a great in a great harmony.
[43:33] And we we understand that even as the as
[43:36] the prophet would would teach us that it
[43:38] is love that actually is what produces
[43:42] faith. And this is where that even as we
[43:45] uh look here at at the word of God and
[43:48] to know that um in God's word that God
[43:52] would express um his word to our hearts.
[43:56] But God his desire is that we would see
[43:59] him. And that's that's that's the whole
[44:01] cusp of it all is that we would see him.
[44:04] We would recognize his presence. We
[44:06] would recognize his love and his desire
[44:09] for our life. And brother Brandon will
[44:11] take this within um within the message
[44:14] thy house and he will uh deal with this
[44:17] and looking at it in terms of that of a
[44:20] relationship. And he said, "I was
[44:22] telling my wife the other day of just
[44:24] how much that um that I had loved her."
[44:26] And he says, "You know, I guess it's
[44:28] okay for me to talk about this in
[44:30] public." He said, "And and she just
[44:31] began to speak about Bill. You know, I'm
[44:34] getting fat and turning gray." And you
[44:36] know, Brother Bram had away with words,
[44:38] didn't he?
[44:39] And uh and he said, you know, he he he
[44:42] told her, he said, it it really wouldn't
[44:44] matter no matter to what degree of size
[44:46] and hair and all this like that. He
[44:48] says, because it's based on love. And he
[44:51] says, you know, and he begins to give
[44:53] counsel even to the young ones that are
[44:55] sitting there because this is a house
[44:57] meeting. And he says there, but there's
[44:59] something about you that you love her.
[45:02] And that's the same thing. There's
[45:04] something about him that you love him
[45:06] whether he's handsome or not, whether
[45:07] she's pretty or not. Uh that really
[45:10] doesn't matter whether you love them
[45:11] just the same. But you know, and I know
[45:14] we could deal with this part of it
[45:16] because sometimes with young people when
[45:17] we're talking about they say, "Well, is
[45:19] there a part of attraction?" And sure,
[45:21] there's a part of attraction. But the
[45:23] one thing that you begin to look at is
[45:25] deeper than what can be the attraction
[45:27] out here is when you begin to get to
[45:29] know the character and that person and
[45:32] that individual. and they might be a
[45:34] real royal uh character, but maybe it
[45:38] just something as you're praying and
[45:39] you're waiting and you're looking to
[45:41] God, you just can never get settled on
[45:44] that. And God God knows just how to lead
[45:47] us. You know, he every time with God's
[45:50] will, the dove of the Holy Spirit is
[45:52] always accompanied right there. And so
[45:54] God knows just how to lead and to guide
[45:56] us. and what what really matters even as
[45:59] the the message of the hour would take
[46:01] us to really see that it's really
[46:03] character that really matters and when
[46:05] you you think of that even in terms of
[46:08] the message of the hour you recognize
[46:11] that the message itself it's Christ
[46:13] being revealed and remember it's still
[46:15] the same parallel of Isaiah 53 he still
[46:19] is despised and rejected of men when the
[46:22] when the scripture was wrote there on
[46:23] Isaiah 53 it never said he will be
[46:26] despised Ed, it says he is despised and
[46:29] rejected of men because Christ was
[46:31] rejected in Noah. Christ was rejected in
[46:35] Isaiah. Christ was rejected in Jeremiah.
[46:38] But among the elect, they received the
[46:43] servants that God sent. So then they
[46:46] received the word of God and they
[46:48] received that portion and they received
[46:50] God's blessing to their life. But it was
[46:53] Christ in those men. So it's looking
[46:56] beyond the frame and the veil and it's
[46:59] looking in that's where within the the
[47:01] message of the hour when we express that
[47:03] and as we've been just laboring within
[47:05] that that it's it's not uh confined it's
[47:08] not a group or collections of doctrines.
[47:11] It's not how well we can recite
[47:13] something but it's meeting the very
[47:15] person of Jesus Christ. And that's what
[47:18] really matters within a life because
[47:20] that's what really holds and that's what
[47:22] really brings stability through all of
[47:25] the tests and trials because life is
[47:28] filled with test and trials and we're
[47:30] not we're not uh as far as troubles they
[47:33] they have troubles out there we have
[47:35] troubles as well but the difference is
[47:38] is where you're anchored and you know in
[47:41] whom you have believed
[47:43] &gt;&gt; and so brother Brown picks this up and
[47:45] he says you know he says now within In
[47:47] that he says a marriage itself based
[47:50] anything uh outside of that it'll never
[47:53] be successful. It'll never be happy. He
[47:56] says you know he says you can get around
[47:58] one thing and friends a conversion
[48:00] outside of the same thing won't last
[48:03] either. When you go to church and say
[48:05] I'm going to join church and going to be
[48:07] baptized. If that isn't coming from a
[48:10] heart of love to God yonder it'll never
[48:13] go nowhere. All you'll do is join church
[48:16] and be baptized.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; See, the the objective is is to fall in
[48:20] love with him.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes a very key
[48:23] statement in restoration of the bride
[48:25] tree. He says, "Let him he says all you
[48:29] have to do is yield and he will take you
[48:33] to your healing. He will take you to the
[48:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost." And see, it
[48:39] becomes it it it's it's where God
[48:42] reveals his love. That's where that even
[48:45] when John I just think back to that
[48:47] scripture. I love how John writes that
[48:49] in first John that herein have we known
[48:53] and believed the love that God hath to
[48:57] us.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; I'M YOU CANNOT NO WONDER with the the
[49:01] the man who was writing the love of God
[49:04] how rich and pure. THERE'S NO WAY in our
[49:07] mind to wrap our natural or finite mind
[49:11] around it because the love of God is so
[49:14] much deeper. It's so much greater. IT'S
[49:17] NOT A LOVE that's even based upon the
[49:20] conditions of time. It's a love that
[49:22] originates from eternity that reaches
[49:26] into time AND BRINGS DELIVERANCE AND
[49:29] CONTACTS US BACK to the representation
[49:33] and whom that God knew that you and I
[49:37] always were. It brings us into that real
[49:40] relationship with him. So, you know,
[49:42] this is why that brother Brandham goes
[49:44] on to say, he says, "Now, when you're
[49:46] converted to Christ, a love to Christ,
[49:49] then you accumulate a faith in Christ
[49:53] like you would to your wife or to your
[49:55] husband. You accumulate a faith that you
[49:58] walk in that faith. It just something
[50:01] about it that anchors you there." So, he
[50:05] goes on to say, "That's the same way it
[50:07] is about Christ." And what Christ says,
[50:10] you believe it and you just stay right
[50:12] with it. And that's the way it just
[50:14] raises you up right above it. And God
[50:17] brings it to pass and fulfills his
[50:20] promise. If thou will believe on the
[50:23] Lord Jesus Christ, thy and thy house
[50:25] shall be saved. And I would just say it
[50:27] in this manner that if you haven't
[50:29] listened to this message in a while, thy
[50:31] house, and you're praying for loved
[50:33] ones, I tell you, you talking about a
[50:36] message to go and listen to and sit down
[50:39] and just brother Brandon, just speaking
[50:40] in that with that group that's there in
[50:43] Typton, Georgia, there's so much
[50:45] application on how to approach things in
[50:48] faith with our family and to hold on to
[50:52] the promises of almighty God. And you so
[50:55] there is an accumulation of faith within
[50:58] our lives. There's there's more there's
[51:00] a faith that is greater or should be
[51:03] greater in our life and in our walk now
[51:06] than what it was than when we first
[51:09] believed. And to be you know to
[51:11] accumulate there's a there's a lot of
[51:13] things that when we uh look at this with
[51:16] accumulation it is it's a gathering of
[51:19] things. And I think probably we would be
[51:22] maybe uh professionals on some of this
[51:24] because we accumulate certain things.
[51:26] Everybody has something you kind of
[51:28] accumulate. You know, we sometimes it's
[51:30] not it's sometimes it's things that I'm
[51:32] going to save this for later. I'm going
[51:34] to save this for later. I'm going to
[51:35] save this for later. What are those
[51:36] screws to? I don't know. But we may use
[51:38] them, you know. And and I understand
[51:40] sometimes it all depends on um where
[51:43] where people have come from.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Like my mama Brown, she froze
[51:47] everything. She froze even Halloween
[51:50] candy and she would pull it out and well
[51:54] I don't have to describe all it but you
[51:55] know she came through those times of the
[51:57] depression. So you know the it just
[51:59] become a a natural thing and you know
[52:01] that's the wild sometimes if you maybe
[52:03] you know you have maybe a little more
[52:05] than what you had before you still you
[52:06] look at things in a still in the same
[52:09] light and you're just like my I don't
[52:10] want to get rid of this. I don't want to
[52:11] get rid of this and you might need this
[52:13] and so uh but my point is is not for us
[52:17] to look at one another but my point is
[52:18] is that we understand what accumulation
[52:21] is and accumulation is not something
[52:23] that just takes place like massive halls
[52:26] all at once.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; It's things little by little by little
[52:31] by little.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And that's the same way it is with our
[52:35] faith, our walk with God. There is an
[52:38] accumulation. And it's not something
[52:41] that we are sensing even in that moment
[52:44] and even sometimes the circumstances
[52:47] through the tests through the trials and
[52:49] even how God would direct us in his word
[52:52] we're not even uh seeing the whole
[52:54] picture but it isn't until we've come to
[52:57] that place and being able to look back
[52:59] and we can see my Lord Jesus how that
[53:03] you have brought me to where I am and we
[53:06] also are appreciative appreciative of
[53:09] his leadership in these moments OF JUST
[53:13] HIS NUDGES here and there and how he's
[53:16] there to guide us and we appreciate and
[53:18] it's building a faith within our life to
[53:21] where we walk within that confidence. SO
[53:24] IT'S NOT A MAN-MADE CONFIDENCE. IN OTHER
[53:27] WORDS, THIS IS NOT A CONFIDENCE THAT
[53:29] COMES BECAUSE I CAN PUT two and two
[53:31] together, but it's a confidence that has
[53:34] accumulated because of the love of God.
[53:38] And we are witnessing that in our own
[53:41] lives through all of our shortcomings.
[53:43] We're witnessing it how God will
[53:46] minister to us in the very needs in our
[53:48] life where he'll come into times of
[53:51] devotion where he'll come right through
[53:53] the messages and here we are listening
[53:55] to a message and God WILL DROP SOMETHING
[53:58] RIGHT DOWN AN ANSWER that we've been
[54:00] praying about AND WE WATCH GOD'S CARE
[54:03] AND AS WE TAKE that in what we're doing
[54:06] through a RELATIONSHIP IT BUILDS a faith
[54:09] and an accumulation that cannot be
[54:13] schooled led into us.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; It comes through experiences.
[54:20] It comes through time. And so this
[54:23] accumulation, I want to just say it in
[54:25] this way that the accumulation of this
[54:28] faith, it will happen and it will never
[54:31] be greater than the love of God that's
[54:34] able to support it and guide it. Amen.
[54:38] So this is why when brother Brandham
[54:40] would always as Paul would make the
[54:43] distinction between
[54:46] um that of faith to move mountains or
[54:49] from gifts of healing, working of
[54:51] miracles, gifts of faith all the way
[54:53] through there and brother Ram will put
[54:54] that distinction in the message
[54:57] desperation among other places showing
[54:59] us that there can be great faith that
[55:02] can even be utilized uh even when it's
[55:06] not a sincere heart. And you would say,
[55:07] "Well, how could that be not a sincere
[55:09] heart?" Because when it's not sincerely
[55:12] lined up and grounded with God by a real
[55:16] birth.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And so where this faith that we're
[55:21] talking about, it's a faith that Paul
[55:24] wrote of where Paul said, "The the life
[55:27] that I'm now living, I'm living by the
[55:29] faith of the Son of God." This is the
[55:32] same faith that Jude said we're to
[55:34] earnestly contend for. This is the same
[55:37] faith that Paul wrote in Romans 12 that
[55:40] God had dealt to every man a measure of
[55:43] faith. This faith that we're talking
[55:45] about is the Holy Ghost.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Is that sixth sense that drops into the
[55:52] heart of an individual that you may
[55:54] never maybe your calling isn't to lay
[55:57] hands on people. MAYBE THERE'S YOU MAYBE
[56:00] THERE'S NOT a calling yet. I believe
[56:01] everyone that as a believer you're going
[56:04] to be you're be called to do that at
[56:05] some point or another. But I think you
[56:07] understand what I mean is is that there
[56:09] may not be things that you would be uh
[56:13] called to do out here, BUT YET THE
[56:16] CONSTANT STANDING and believing in God's
[56:19] word and a FAITH THAT HOLDS STEADY THAT
[56:22] EVEN WHEN GOD SAYS NO, YOU STAND right
[56:24] there and YOU LOVE HIM JUST THE SAME. So
[56:28] in other words, your love is not
[56:30] dictated or determined based on uh how
[56:33] how good the bank account is or how good
[56:36] things are going at home or how good
[56:38] things are going. BUT BUT BUT THERE HAS
[56:40] GOT TO BE a real a love. And I know ALL
[56:44] OF THOSE THINGS CAN HAVE TRIED TO AFFECT
[56:46] AND TRY TO INFLUENCE, BUT IT'S A FAITH
[56:49] THAT HOLDS STEADY THROUGH THE MIDST OF
[56:51] IT ALL. SURE, you may get down. Sure,
[56:54] you may feel like I can't put one foot
[56:56] in front OF THE OTHER. BUT THAT'S WHY
[56:58] IT'S GOT TO BE A FAITH THAT'S GREATER
[57:01] than intellectual faith because AN
[57:03] INTELLECTUAL FAITH, IT ONLY TAKES A
[57:06] MATTER OF TIME AND IT can be blown right
[57:08] out. BUT WHEN IT'S FAITH THAT'S GROUNDED
[57:11] THAT THERE IS IT'S FOUNDED ON A ROCK, IT
[57:14] DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COMES YOUR WAY.
[57:16] THERE MIGHT BE STORMS, THERE'S TRIALS,
[57:18] THERE'S WIND, THERE'S ALL SORTS OF
[57:20] THINGS, BUT IT CANNOT TAKE AWAY THAT
[57:24] EXPERIENCE THAT'S FOUNDED ON A ROCK.
[57:28] CAN DO IT. SO GOD WILL ALWAYS HOW GOD IS
[57:32] WORKING WITH ALL of this is that the
[57:35] accumulation of this confidence and I
[57:38] want you to think once again of this
[57:40] linked together with love. It'll never
[57:42] be greater than the than the love of God
[57:45] is able to support it and guide it in
[57:48] OUR LIFE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT produces
[57:51] faith is REAL TRUE LOVE. NOW REMEMBER,
[57:55] BROTHER BRAM STARTS IT JUST JUST JUST
[57:58] STARTING OUT WITH EVEN LOOKING at where
[58:01] you were and where you are now,
[58:04] &gt;&gt; right? Brother Bram takes THAT IN
[58:06] PERFECT FAITH BECAUSE HE SAYS FAITH IS
[58:08] BASED on forgiveness.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO YOU'RE ABLE TO SAY LIKE THE
[58:13] PROPHET SAYS, "LOOK WHERE YOU WERE. LOOK
[58:16] WHERE YOU ARE."
[58:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID THAT somebody who loved you?
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND HE SAYS THAT OUGHT TO
[58:25] create a perfect faith.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; You see, BY DOING WHAT? LOOKING AT WHERE
[58:31] that he has taken YOU FROM AND WHERE YOU
[58:34] ARE. AND SURE, ALL of us can say tonight
[58:37] that, you know, I'm not what I want I
[58:39] ought to be. I'M NOT EVEN WHAT I WANT TO
[58:41] BE, BUT I'M NOT WHAT I USED to be. All
[58:44] right.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOOD TO KNOW TO HAVE THAT
[58:48] declaration in our HEARTS BECAUSE WE ARE
[58:51] PRESSING ON THE UPWARD WAY.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION. There is
[58:57] accumulating. And we want to be
[58:59] accumulating the right things.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you in this life we
[59:06] can accumulate the wrong things.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; This flesh. Remember the prophet says
[59:12] that even after the new birth has come,
[59:15] he says that sticky carnal nature is
[59:17] always going to bother you until this
[59:19] life has been fully developed
[59:22] &gt;&gt; out
[59:23] &gt;&gt; from that new birth until we go. But you
[59:26] know he also told us in the message
[59:28] ashamed that when we don't abide in the
[59:33] presence of God that's when we also get
[59:36] prickly
[59:37] and you know we we all can fellowship
[59:40] from this area because I think even
[59:42] sister Judith you all in Cleveland
[59:43] probably have it too. doesn't make much
[59:45] sense to me. But at any rate, when they
[59:47] when we have the recyclable trash and
[59:50] and and and it seems like every single
[59:53] night we have trash collection the next
[59:55] morning is windy.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; You almost want to say, "Everybody just
[1:00:02] dump your trash right back here on my
[1:00:04] patio. I'll just pick it up."
[1:00:08] That's a little sarcasm, but you know,
[1:00:10] the thing of it is you you know, I I get
[1:00:13] I get the some of the principles and I I
[1:00:14] understand some of that. But what I'm
[1:00:16] saying is is that THERE'S A LOT OF
[1:00:18] THINGS THAT get collected. There's
[1:00:19] things that all the way through the
[1:00:21] hydrangeas on either side. I look out
[1:00:23] there in the in the in the woods and you
[1:00:25] know, from where they're building across
[1:00:26] the way and man, there's just big sheets
[1:00:28] of that Tyvec that are just blasted up
[1:00:31] against trees BECAUSE WHAT IS IT? IT
[1:00:34] WOULD HAVE KEPT ON GOING, BUT THERE'S
[1:00:36] THINGS that caught it.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And this is why that in our LIFE THAT
[1:00:41] STICKY PART AND THOSE THINGS ABOUT OUR
[1:00:43] LIFE, IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE. But
[1:00:45] this is why we have to have TO BE FIRMLY
[1:00:48] AWARE. IT'S SO EASY FOR US, THE FLESH
[1:00:52] PART, TO CATCH THOSE THINGS that are
[1:00:55] carnal.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; So and so said this to me, so and so
[1:01:00] didn't do this. my husband said this or
[1:01:03] my wife said this or so and so didn't
[1:01:05] shake my hand or this and we CAN GO
[1:01:08] RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD AND IF WE'RE NOT
[1:01:10] CAREFUL we accumulate the wrong things.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF THE SIGNS THAT WHEN your
[1:01:17] accumulation is going the WRONG
[1:01:20] DIRECTION IS HOW is your love to the
[1:01:24] Lord?
[1:01:25] Now, ONE WAY TO MEASURE HOW YOUR LOVE is
[1:01:28] to the LORD IS IS HOW IS YOUR LOVE
[1:01:31] toward one another?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; See, THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE WE KNOW,
[1:01:37] AM I RIGHT WHERE I NEED to be, even
[1:01:39] within THE PRESENCE OF GOD. YOU SAY,
[1:01:42] "HOW DO I KNOW THAT I'M RIGHT WHERE I
[1:01:43] NEED TO BE?" TO WHERE YOU'RE NEVER
[1:01:45] LOOKING DOWN ON SOMEONE ELSE.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE EVER LOOKING DOWN,
[1:01:51] YOU'RE IN the wrong position.
[1:01:53] But always even even in situations to
[1:01:57] where we bring uh needs to the Lord IN
[1:02:00] PRAYER, WE'RE LIFTING UP AND SAYING,
[1:02:02] "GOD, MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, YOU KNOW
[1:02:04] THE NEED, LORD, THAT'S PRESENT IN THEIR
[1:02:07] LIFE, LORD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
[1:02:09] GOING THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE
[1:02:10] BEEN THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE
[1:02:12] THEY'VE RESPONDED THIS WAY, BUT YOU DO,
[1:02:14] LORD. THAT'S MY BROTHER. THAT'S MY
[1:02:16] SISTER, LORD. MINISTER TO THEIR NEEDS,
[1:02:18] LORD, AND CONDITION MY HEART, LORD. All
[1:02:22] right.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S SIMPLY TO TRUST GOD. THIS LOVE,
[1:02:29] it'll remember, IT'S IT'S LOVE THAT
[1:02:32] PUSHES OUR FAITH out onto the
[1:02:34] battlefront to stand. And it's trust and
[1:02:37] confidence in his word simply because he
[1:02:42] said it. And that's through that comes
[1:02:44] through fellowship with him. It's got to
[1:02:47] is a peace that passes all
[1:02:49] understanding. a faith that'll master
[1:02:51] THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY STANDING ON WHAT
[1:02:54] GOD HAS SAID. NOT NOT THAT YOU KNOW HOW.
[1:02:56] THAT'S NOT MASTERY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE.
[1:02:59] BUT MASTERING THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
[1:03:02] KNOWING in whom you have believed.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; MASTERING THE CIRCUMSTANCE DOES NOT EVEN
[1:03:08] MEAN THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR PRAYER
[1:03:10] ANSWERED THE WAY YOU'VE PRAYED. BECAUSE
[1:03:12] IN HEBREWS 11, IN THE HEROES OF FAITH,
[1:03:15] THERE WERE SOME WHO WERE KILLED,
[1:03:17] TORTURED. YES.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? NOT ALL WERE DELIVERED
[1:03:22] FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LIONS.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY ALL HAD A TESTIMONY AND IT WAS
[1:03:27] ALL VITAL AND IT WAS ALL JUST AS GREAT
[1:03:30] AS THE OTHER.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; It's the hall of fame
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; of faith and of trust of confidence.
[1:03:37] They, the Bible tells us in the book of
[1:03:39] Revelations, they loved not their own
[1:03:42] lives unto death.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Not until death. They didn't come right
[1:03:48] up to the point of it and then pull
[1:03:49] back, but unto they submitted
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; all the way through.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That's really good. Let's look at a few
[1:03:57] scriptures here.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 3:17, Paul said that Christ
[1:04:02] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[1:04:06] ye being rooted and grounded in love. So
[1:04:11] to dwell in faith, being rooted. So I
[1:04:15] there's A SOURCE THAT I'M DRAWING from
[1:04:17] because when you're ROOTED AND GROUNDED,
[1:04:20] YOU'RE DRAWING from an unseen source.
[1:04:25] And listen, this is why uh I think
[1:04:29] about, you've heard me share this
[1:04:30] before, that even within uh plants and
[1:04:34] things like that, like when we had these
[1:04:36] planted out here and then and then these
[1:04:38] planted, when we would would water them,
[1:04:41] you're wanting not a it doesn't matter
[1:04:43] if you get the leaves or not, but it is
[1:04:45] it's a slow watering that will actually
[1:04:48] absorb in the ground because what it's
[1:04:50] being done, it's teaching THE ROOTS TO
[1:04:54] GO DEEP.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; IF YOU JUST WATER A LOT ON TOP, IT
[1:04:58] TEACHES THE ROOTS JUST TO STAY ON A
[1:05:00] SURFACE LEVEL. AND THIS IS WHY GOD TAKES
[1:05:03] US. WE NEED, listen to me now, we need
[1:05:07] experiences. THIS IS WHY WE NEED WE AND
[1:05:10] GOD CAN DO IT ON A THURSDAY NIGHT. HE
[1:05:12] CAN DO IT ON A SUNDAY. GOD CAN DO IT and
[1:05:14] you know, just like AT A YOUTH CAMP. BUT
[1:05:16] GOD DOESN'T WANT EVERY SERVICE. IT'S NOT
[1:05:18] GOING TO BE A YOUTH CAMP SERVICE.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; EVERY SERVICE. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
[1:05:22] THAT THOSE THERE IS A NEED FOR THAT. GOD
[1:05:26] IS INTERESTED IN BUILDING PEOPLE'S FAITH
[1:05:29] AND TO BRING ABOUT A REAL BIRTH AND A
[1:05:32] REAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S HOW HE WANTS
[1:05:34] TO DO EVEN IN EVERY SERVICE. BUT YET,
[1:05:36] THERE'S ALSO GOT TO BE TRAINING AND
[1:05:38] TEACHING
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU AS
[1:05:42] JUST A NURSERY PLANT AND SAY, "WELL, I'M
[1:05:44] JUST TRYING TO WORK ON EVERYBODY ELSE."
[1:05:46] GOD IS WORKING ON ALL ACCOUNTS AT THE
[1:05:49] SAME TIME AND HE'S TEACHING us by his
[1:05:52] spirit to go deeper.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Because there's storms.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And there's also a source that we're to
[1:06:01] draw from that when dryness comes
[1:06:05] because you'll have dry seasons in your
[1:06:07] life.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You will. Every you don't have you don't
[1:06:11] have every season's not a wet season. So
[1:06:13] God teaches us to go and trains us to go
[1:06:17] deeper.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; So there's stability that even when in
[1:06:23] our lives you don't feel him when you're
[1:06:27] praying
[1:06:29] when you have to come and you're coming
[1:06:30] to a service and you're pressing more.
[1:06:33] It's not a service that's almost like
[1:06:35] sometimes how brother Brian describes it
[1:06:37] like brother Brian will say you know at
[1:06:38] times man I I can just be up here and
[1:06:40] say hey uh let's you know let's sing
[1:06:42] this song boom it's ready to explode
[1:06:44] there's all all of those moments right
[1:06:47] and then there's other times where you
[1:06:49] feel like you're the ox of the team and
[1:06:50] you're pulling
[1:06:52] and you're pulling
[1:06:54] but every one of those is everything
[1:06:58] each one is DIFFERENT AND WE CAN SAY
[1:06:59] WELL THIS ONE SHOULD DO THIS AND this
[1:07:01] one SHOULD DO THAT BUT GOD IS TRAINING
[1:07:03] LEADING US TO THAT THAT WE ARE TO DRAW
[1:07:06] FROM THAT UNSEEN SOURCE TO WHERE THAT
[1:07:09] WHEN EVEN WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND US
[1:07:12] THERE MIGHT BE DRYNESS BUT YOU ARE
[1:07:14] TAPPED IN TO JESUS CHRIST.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A FAITH AND A CONFIDENCE
[1:07:19] THAT YOU CAN STAND THERE that no matter
[1:07:22] what situation rises or even as God
[1:07:25] would minister to things in our hearts
[1:07:27] and our lives there is a faith that is
[1:07:31] residing there.
[1:07:33] Because how many know it's true that
[1:07:35] there's times when situations come up,
[1:07:37] you don't have time to go and say,
[1:07:38] "Well, I'm going to go pray through."
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; You don't have time for that. Jesus
[1:07:41] never said, "You know what? I'm going to
[1:07:42] go pray through. So, you all just wait
[1:07:44] at the front of the boat and I'm going
[1:07:44] be back here praying through." No. He
[1:07:46] knew who he was.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it in this way. It It's not
[1:07:51] sliding prayer, but it's saying that
[1:07:54] contact and that constant fellowship
[1:07:56] with God and all of that. Don't put it
[1:07:59] on a time ratio, but stay in contact
[1:08:01] with him. Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Stay in contact with him. Be ready at
[1:08:05] all times. Even in those moments just
[1:08:07] just ready to just for to step in and
[1:08:10] you know, well, brother Samuel, I feel
[1:08:12] unworthy. Why? Well, brother Sam, I
[1:08:14] haven't had time in prayer today.
[1:08:15] Really? What kind of time are you
[1:08:16] gauging? Are you saying you haven't had
[1:08:17] an hour?
[1:08:20] So, show me a scripture that'll make you
[1:08:23] worthy after an hour.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S MAN'S TRADITION.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HINDRANCES. AND WHAT THAT IS THAT
[1:08:30] HINDERS GROWTH.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S THINGS THAT SOMETIMES THAT WE
[1:08:35] HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TAUGHT. IT'S JUST
[1:08:37] THINGS THAT WE FEEL.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I know I can go through quotes or I can
[1:08:40] go through scripture. Oh sweet hour of
[1:08:42] prayer.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. LOVE THAT SONG. Oh to kneel in
[1:08:47] prayer. RIGHT. AND WE WE HAVE THOSE
[1:08:49] THINGS. AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT TALKING
[1:08:51] ABOUT THAT AS FAR AS OH WE SHOULDN'T
[1:08:53] HAVE TIME WITH GOD. WHAT IT WHAT IT'S
[1:08:55] SPEAKING ABOUT IS THAT THERE IS TO HAVE
[1:08:58] A MOMENT WITH GOD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:09:01] THAT ITSELF IT GROWS. YOU BEGIN TO
[1:09:03] REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO JUST
[1:09:06] WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR KNEES THAT YOU CAN
[1:09:08] STAY AS PAUL SAID IN THAT CHAPTER WHERE
[1:09:12] IT'S A CHAPTER OF BATTLE PRAYING WITHOUT
[1:09:15] CEASING.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Tell me how that's done if you've got to
[1:09:18] be in your prayer closet the whole time.
[1:09:20] Well, brother Samuel, what he was saying
[1:09:21] is is don't cease to be in your prayer
[1:09:23] closet. HE'S SAYING PRAY WITHOUT
[1:09:24] CEASING. PAUL WOULD SAY STANDING. But
[1:09:27] David WOULD SAY LAYING. RIGHT? SO IT'S A
[1:09:30] CONSTANT STAYING in a state of prayer.
[1:09:33] That's why the prophet said regarding
[1:09:34] Abraham when he saw them coming, he said
[1:09:37] Abraham kept himself in an atmosphere of
[1:09:39] prayer at all times.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; We got to get going here.
[1:09:47] Peace be to the brethren and LOVE WITH
[1:09:51] faith from God the Father and the Lord
[1:09:54] Jesus Christ. SO NOTICE HOW BRINGING
[1:09:57] THIS TOGETHER and love with faith.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "And the grace of our Lord
[1:10:03] WAS EXCEEDING ABUNDANT WITH FAITH and
[1:10:06] love which is in Christ Jesus."
[1:10:10] PAUL SAID, "HOLD FAST the form of sound
[1:10:13] words which thou has heard of me in
[1:10:15] faith and love which is in Christ
[1:10:17] Jesus." He goes on, "NOW I WANT YOU TO
[1:10:20] THINK OF THIS HERE. THE DESIRE OF FAITH
[1:10:23] and how faith and love operates
[1:10:25] together." And notice this commenation
[1:10:29] in these three points in in in Fameon.
[1:10:32] says, "Hearing of thy love and faith
[1:10:35] WHICH THOU HAST TOWARD THE LORD Jesus
[1:10:38] and toward all saints." He says the very
[1:10:41] same thing in the NEXT TWO CHAPTERS. SO
[1:10:43] there there is there IS NO WAY FOR US TO
[1:10:46] HAVE THE FAITH in the right way to THE
[1:10:50] LORD JESUS AND NOT HAVE LOVE UNTO ALL
[1:10:52] the saints because I would say within
[1:10:55] that all that all reccluded all. Right?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; It even INCLUDED THOSE THAT RUBBED YOU a
[1:11:04] little bit and you rubbed them.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A LOVE. SEE, LOVE IS NOT
[1:11:09] ABOUT THAT. WE ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE.
[1:11:11] BUT IT OUGHT TO BE SUCH A LOVE THAT IT
[1:11:14] SHOULD NOT BE NOTICEABLE. OH, THIS ONE
[1:11:16] HAS SOMETHING AGAINST this one. OH, THIS
[1:11:18] ONE HAS A PROBLEM HERE. HOW DO YOU KNOW
[1:11:20] IT'S STANDING OUT? IT OUGHT TO BE LOVE
[1:11:24] THAT IS GLUING AND BRINGING US TOGETHER.
[1:11:27] BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, IF OTHERS CAN
[1:11:29] NOTICE IT, THE DEVIL NOTICES IT AND HE'S
[1:11:32] GOING TO CONTINUE TO POUR IT ON AND
[1:11:34] THERE'LL BE AN ACCUMULATION IN the wrong
[1:11:36] way.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; This is why we need not only the
[1:11:42] discernment of the Holy Spirit, but we
[1:11:44] need, oh God, let our hearts just be
[1:11:46] right in tune and submission to your
[1:11:49] will. James chapter 2:5, remember James
[1:11:52] is writing in a very pastoral letter
[1:11:54] about how there were differences being
[1:11:56] made. you know, with this one right
[1:11:58] here. You know, they've got a powerful
[1:11:59] 401k. Uh they drive a Cadillac, they do
[1:12:02] this. You sit right here. And then they
[1:12:03] have another one over here that maybe
[1:12:05] they're riding a red wagon to church. Uh
[1:12:07] you sat down there on the stool.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; See, they were making after evil
[1:12:13] thoughts.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes that we Let me just
[1:12:17] preach a little bit on this. Sometimes
[1:12:21] we can say, "Brother Samuel, that's very
[1:12:24] kindergartenish." But sometimes if we're
[1:12:26] not careful, you can start to place
[1:12:29] people because they check this box, they
[1:12:32] check that box, they check this box,
[1:12:34] they check this box. But what's most
[1:12:36] important is is you don't know if
[1:12:38] they've checked the box of the Holy
[1:12:40] Ghost.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And you know what? There ain't no way
[1:12:43] for you to know.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; That's why when brother Brandham was
[1:12:47] asked the question, "Brother Brandom, I
[1:12:48] want to be able to tell if somebody's
[1:12:49] got the Holy Ghost." Brother Brandham
[1:12:50] said, "No, brother, that's not something
[1:12:52] for you."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:55] Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; And I don't know why somebody would even
[1:12:58] be worried about that.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Let every man take
[1:13:01] account of HIS OWN
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; HIS OWN SELF."
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WITHIN A SERVICE, DON'T LET
[1:13:07] THE DEVIL DISTRACT YOU AND GET YOUR EYES
[1:13:10] OVER HERE. LOOK, LOOK, FRIENDS, AS THE
[1:13:13] PASTOR OF THIS ASSEMBLY, I'VE GOT A
[1:13:15] RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYONE THAT COMES
[1:13:17] HERE AND LOOKS TO THIS THIS PLACE AS
[1:13:20] YOUR HOME CHURCH AND MYSELF AS YOUR
[1:13:23] PASTOR. I'VE GOT A RESPONSIBILITY. BUT
[1:13:25] LET ME JUST TELL YOU, WHEN THE WORD IS
[1:13:27] COMING FORTH, MY HEART IS OPEN BEFORE
[1:13:30] GOD. I'M NOT HERE LOOKING and saying,
[1:13:32] "Well, this one, THIS AND THIS ONE,
[1:13:33] THIS." CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU WALK OUT OF
[1:13:36] SERVICE, WHAT DID YOU GET? WELL, THIS
[1:13:37] ONE, THIS, and this one, that. AND THEN
[1:13:39] I ASKED YOU, "WHAT DID YOU GET?"
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; AND IF ALL YOU CAN SEE IS SHORTCOMINGS,
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ASK GOD for a real refilling
[1:13:49] of THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I'M BEING SERIOUS, FRIENDS. WE CAN THEN
[1:13:53] THAT THAT CANNOT BE A PART OF OUR LIFE
[1:13:55] AND THEN EXPECT TO BE A A LIFE THAT EVEN
[1:13:59] OUR FAMILY WANTS TO BE around
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; because your picking won't stop with one
[1:14:04] person.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; It'll keep on going.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; But God help us.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; God help us. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. I
[1:14:13] DON'T CARE IF IT'S A PERSON that they
[1:14:14] walk IN HERE 15 MINUTES LATE. I WANT TO
[1:14:16] ENCOURAGE THEM.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? BECAUSE IT
[1:14:21] MAY NOT BE THAT WAY THE WHOLE TIME, BUT
[1:14:23] I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM IN THEIR WALK
[1:14:25] WITH GOD.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul, this is why JAMES WROTE
[1:14:30] THIS. HATH NOT GOD CHOSEN THE POOR of
[1:14:32] this world, rich in faith, and heirs of
[1:14:34] the kingdom which he hath promised to
[1:14:36] them that love him? That's why I've said
[1:14:37] this. I've given brother Carlos a rose
[1:14:39] many times. I APPRECIATE HIM STANDING
[1:14:41] OUT THERE AND GREETING AS PEOPLE ARE
[1:14:44] COMING IN.
[1:14:45] I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:14:47] IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PLACES WHERE
[1:14:49] YOU'RE NOT GREETED AND THE PROPHET TELLS
[1:14:52] US THE DEACONS ARE TO GREET AT THE DOOR
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; AND WELCOMING THE PEOPLE IN. SEE, THAT'S
[1:14:58] PART OF THE SACRIFICE THAT THE DEACONS
[1:15:01] have to make.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S PART OF THE SACRIFICE JUST LIKE
[1:15:05] TRUSTEES HAVE IT AND MUSICIANS HAVE IT.
[1:15:07] THEY HAVE THE THERE'S ALL OF THAT THAT
[1:15:09] PART THAT GOES INTO IT TO GREET PEOPLE,
[1:15:12] TO ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER. BROTHER, I
[1:15:14] HAVEN'T SEEN YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. IT'S SO
[1:15:16] GOOD TO BE HERE. SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[1:15:18] ENCOURAGE THEM BECAUSE LISTEN, WHATEVER
[1:15:21] NEEDS TO BE DONE, it will have to be a
[1:15:23] God thing.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; See, you have to be able to stop and
[1:15:28] think and think, if my life and my
[1:15:31] testimony and what I'm saying, is it
[1:15:33] encouraging people?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I want to be an encouragement.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I sure do. I want to be an encouragement
[1:15:42] to somebody. I want to be encouragement
[1:15:44] to God's children. So you notice, rich
[1:15:47] in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which
[1:15:48] he had promised to them that love him.
[1:15:50] FOR IN JESUS CHRIST, NEITHER
[1:15:53] circumcision avaleth anything, nor
[1:15:55] uncircumcision, but faith which workketh
[1:15:59] by love.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] And I think that when we consider this
[1:16:05] of how the faith and love working
[1:16:08] together through the scriptures,
[1:16:10] remember
[1:16:11] Paul would write of how charity never
[1:16:13] faileth. He would remind us of the three
[1:16:17] that's always a part of the fulfillment
[1:16:19] of God's word, hope, faith, and charity,
[1:16:21] and remind us that the greatest of these
[1:16:24] is charity.
[1:16:27] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:16:28] He says, "Love the Lord with all your
[1:16:30] heart, with all your soul, with all your
[1:16:32] mind, with all your strength, and faith
[1:16:35] will accompany that love." ABRAHAM HAD
[1:16:39] TO LOVE GOD to believe him. Do you love
[1:16:42] him? And more you love him, the more
[1:16:45] faith will accumulate. Right.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; See, this is why that in this hour when
[1:16:52] we we think OF HOW THAT GOD HAS DONE IN
[1:16:55] THIS hour with with loosening the seals
[1:16:59] from off of the book.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; THE THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT OF GOD,
[1:17:04] GOD'S VOICE, GOD revealing
[1:17:07] his word, his secrets, revealing his
[1:17:10] WORD TO OUR HEART. WHAT IS THE WHOLE
[1:17:12] PURPOSE OF THAT? IS TO BUILD a rapturing
[1:17:16] faith.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] AND IT IS THROUGH THAT THAT PREPARES the
[1:17:20] church, GETS IT IN ORDER, GETS IT READY
[1:17:23] FOR THE GOING HOME. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT
[1:17:25] GOD IS DOING WITH THIS WORD THAT HE'S
[1:17:28] GIVEN. AND THIS IS WHY THAT IN THIS HOUR
[1:17:31] THAT THE BRIDE, WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS
[1:17:33] THERE IS A FAITH WITHIN THE BRIDE THAT
[1:17:36] IT'S NOT AN INTELLECTUAL FAITH. IT IS
[1:17:39] THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS ONCE delivered
[1:17:42] to THE SAINTS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE
[1:17:45] MINISTRY OF MALACHI 4 WAS ALL ABOUT. THE
[1:17:48] PROPHET SAID HE WILL SEW THE ENTIRE
[1:17:52] REVELATION ALL THE WAY ON DOWN. HE SAID
[1:17:55] HE WILL ALSO IT WILL BE A RESTORING OF
[1:17:58] BIBLE FAITH.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the ministry of the word in
[1:18:04] this hour has done to bring us back to a
[1:18:06] Bible faith. to simply be able to stand
[1:18:08] on God's word because he said it.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; So the more you love him, the more faith
[1:18:16] will accumulate. Now I I like uh brother
[1:18:18] Brandham, you know, he applies this real
[1:18:20] quickly. He goes into this about with
[1:18:22] Abraham here with El Shadi. Now you know
[1:18:26] when you think about the the uh that of
[1:18:29] how God would reveal himself to Abraham
[1:18:32] as El Shadi,
[1:18:34] God reveals and makes known to Abraham.
[1:18:38] Abraham, come next to me and draw from
[1:18:42] me into you what's needed to produce.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Think about this. It was Abraham. He was
[1:18:51] walking all the way through his journey.
[1:18:53] We looked at this a couple weeks ago
[1:18:55] when he was going THROUGH HIS JOURNEY.
[1:18:57] HE HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; HE HAD HIS SHORTCOMINGS.
[1:19:02] But within IT ALL, YOU COULD NOT GET
[1:19:05] ABRAHAM AWAY FROM THE PROMISE THAT GOD
[1:19:08] GAVE HIM.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; HE KEPT GOING.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; HE KEPT COMING BACK. YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:19:16] BECAUSE HE COULDN'T ESCAPE THE PLAN AND
[1:19:19] PROGRAM OF ALMIGHTY GOD. NO MATTER WHERE
[1:19:22] HE WOULD GO, IF ABRAHAM WENT DOWN WHEN
[1:19:24] HE WENT DOWN TO EGYPT, HE COULD NOT BE
[1:19:26] COMFORTABLE DOWN THERE IN EGYPT. WHY?
[1:19:29] THAT WAS NOT WHERE HE BELONGED.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; GOD REMOVED COMFORT TO GET HIM BACK INTO
[1:19:34] THE LAND. AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT
[1:19:36] GOD DOES WITH YOU AND I. HE'LL REMOVE
[1:19:39] COMFORT TO GET US BACK TO WHERE WE NEED
[1:19:42] TO BE. AND NOT JUST BACK TO WHERE WE
[1:19:44] NEED TO BE, but to continue to walk on
[1:19:47] with him. Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That's what he did with Lot. He allowed
[1:19:52] the circumstances to arise. But you
[1:19:54] know, when a baby,
[1:19:56] you know, brother Abraham called said
[1:19:58] God's word is his breast
[1:20:01] and he brought he brought Abraham up
[1:20:03] close.
[1:20:05] And Abraham, you know, when like a child
[1:20:07] can be fretting, man can be so tore up,
[1:20:12] but they just get next to mama.
[1:20:15] And it's not the nourishment. I know
[1:20:17] sometimes a man, THEY COULD EAT A HOUSE
[1:20:19] DOWN, BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE
[1:20:20] NOURISHMENT WHAT CALMS IT. IT'S THAT
[1:20:23] CLOSENESS, THAT INTIMACY, THAT
[1:20:26] RECOGNIZING THAT SAME HEARTBEAT
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THERE in the beginning.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; AND THAT JUST BEGINS TO CALM THEM AND
[1:20:34] AND then they're taking in the
[1:20:36] nourishment and they're AND THEY'RE JUST
[1:20:38] THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY JUST, YOU
[1:20:39] KNOW, THEY'LL just go right to sleep.
[1:20:42] AND SAME THING THAT GOD, THIS IS WHY GOD
[1:20:44] BRINGS YOU AND I. HE WOOS US UP NEXT TO
[1:20:47] HIM. AND HERE COME AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
[1:20:51] TO SETTLE US IN OUR FRETTING, IN our
[1:20:53] weakness, IN TIMES IN OUR LIFE, IN OUR
[1:20:56] JOURNEY WHERE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT MY
[1:20:59] THAT EVERYTHING AROUND US IS SPINNING.
[1:21:01] BUT GOD KNOWS HOW TO DRAW us
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; to where he'll settle us.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; True. This is why that even when
[1:21:09] Abraham, look how that Paul would write
[1:21:11] this in in Romans 4,
[1:21:15] he considered not his own body now dead.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham no doubt got to a spot where he
[1:21:23] had to think about getting out of bed.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't which what foot goes first
[1:21:32] that comes later. It was just thinking
[1:21:34] about getting out of bed. Then he would
[1:21:37] see the hunchback.
[1:21:40] Then he would also not only see HIMSELF
[1:21:41] BUT SEE SARAH. And it wasn't like things
[1:21:44] was climbing upward,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BODY WAS FAILING,
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; THE EVERYTHING AROUND HIM THAT HE COULD
[1:21:52] SEE WITH HIS SENSES. AND WHEN HE COULD
[1:21:55] HEAR SARAH GO, "OH, SNAP, CRACKLE, POP."
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; OH,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM, I I I'll get breakfast for you
[1:22:03] as soon as I can get over there. Don't
[1:22:05] worry, dear. I can't even straighten up
[1:22:07] right now myself.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING AROUND THE SENSES, THE
[1:22:14] SENSES, EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS
[1:22:17] TOTALLY CONTRARY TO THE PROMISE THAT WAS
[1:22:20] ON THE INSIDE.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROMISE ON THE INSIDE IS WHAT
[1:22:25] allowed Abraham to look beyond his
[1:22:28] senses.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; AMENISE
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; AND CONSIDER NOT. IN OTHER WORDS, he
[1:22:33] never took them in. He never looked at
[1:22:36] them and brought it in line with God's
[1:22:38] word and said, "Huh, I wonder my this
[1:22:41] is, you know, I'm it's getting worse.
[1:22:43] It's not getting better. It's man, my
[1:22:45] pain, everything is getting worse. I'm
[1:22:47] more of a hunchback." NO, NO. ALL ALONG
[1:22:50] HE WAS DRAWING FROM THAT WORD. BUT
[1:22:52] NOTICE NOTICE HOW ABRAHAM'S JOURNEY, THE
[1:22:55] PROPHET TAKES IT IN Genesis 12, 13, 14,
[1:22:58] 15, 16, 17. HE TAKES IT ALL THE WAY UP
[1:23:02] INTO THAT PLACE OF GENESIS 18 AND
[1:23:05] SHOWING THE PROGRESSION OF THE CHURCH of
[1:23:07] the living God and even you and I as an
[1:23:10] individual
[1:23:12] and how that faith is being accumulated
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and God is moving and working and he's
[1:23:19] operating within our lives.
[1:23:27] I know this is very
[1:23:29] very simple but the prophet would say it
[1:23:31] just like this in perfect faith.
[1:23:34] It says when he was 100 years old 25
[1:23:37] years later he was stronger believing
[1:23:39] it.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't get weaker. He got stronger.
[1:23:46] And Jehovah Gyra says he still believed
[1:23:48] it stronger than he did the first place.
[1:23:51] 25 years to keep building. and he had 25
[1:23:54] years to keep building more faith onto
[1:23:58] it.
[1:24:01] So there was a building an accumulating
[1:24:04] that was going on within his life. I we
[1:24:08] can look and you if you all you see is
[1:24:10] Abraham's failures you're missing seeing
[1:24:12] the accumulation
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; because you don't go from Genesis 12 to
[1:24:17] Genesis 22.
[1:24:20] But that what we see in Genesis 22,
[1:24:24] it was within that seed the whole time.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; It was there the whole time. And even
[1:24:31] through look look friends, EVEN THROUGH
[1:24:33] HIS FAILURES. YOU THINK HOW HOW COULD
[1:24:37] HOW COULD FAITH GROW EVEN THROUGH MY
[1:24:39] FAILURES? BECAUSE GOD EXPRESSES HIS LOVE
[1:24:43] AND HIS CARE FOR YOU to bring you back
[1:24:46] to teach you TO SPEAK TO YOUR HEART. AND
[1:24:49] YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A LOVE THAT YOU
[1:24:52] CANNOT ESCAPE.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S A LOVE THAT'S NOT BASED ON YOUR
[1:24:57] WORKS.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; It's not based on your merits.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; It's based on him.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And that's that's wonderful because if
[1:25:06] it's if it's on you and I, boy, there's
[1:25:08] a problem.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; It's always been a problem. Anytime
[1:25:12] there was a covenant that it was based
[1:25:14] on part of it with man. But this is why
[1:25:16] it's an unconditional covenant
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; and it's a God who is fulfilling his
[1:25:20] word in our lives.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God has to bring us back into
[1:25:24] a place to where we will yield. And he's
[1:25:26] letting us know, look, I've only asked
[1:25:28] you to be the channel. I'm the one doing
[1:25:30] it.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; I'm the one doing it.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a few more moments?
[1:25:42] Let me just try to move let me try to
[1:25:44] move through this this part of it here.
[1:25:46] You can read these these portions of
[1:25:48] scripture later on. But just looking in
[1:25:50] in the in that of of the church in
[1:25:53] Thessalonica
[1:25:55] and even what a what a beginning it had.
[1:25:57] What a when I say a rough beginning, I
[1:25:59] mean such where it was such a test right
[1:26:02] there and how that everything came about
[1:26:05] for this church and how that it was
[1:26:07] birthed right out of Paul and the
[1:26:09] missionary journey right there. But Paul
[1:26:11] would write of, and I'm just going to
[1:26:13] kind of skip through this. Paul would
[1:26:15] write and acknowledge their work of
[1:26:17] faith, their labor of love, and their
[1:26:21] patience of hope in our Lord Jesus
[1:26:23] Christ. And knowing, brethren, beloved,
[1:26:27] your election of God.
[1:26:30] Now he's pointing out their faith even
[1:26:32] as Paul would go on in THIS SAME CHAPTER
[1:26:34] OF HOW THAT THE TESTIMONY of their faith
[1:26:39] is even reaching to others.
[1:26:42] So their faith THERE'S A IT'S A SOUNDING
[1:26:45] OUT SO THAT PAUL IS actually taking
[1:26:49] account from others of the effect of the
[1:26:53] gospel on their life because the effect
[1:26:55] of the gospel on their life has made its
[1:26:57] way and touched others.
[1:27:00] And Paul is writing about the work of
[1:27:02] faith wherein that they turned to God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; HE'S WRITING ABOUT THEIR LABOR OF LOVE
[1:27:08] IN THAT THEY SERVED the living and true
[1:27:10] God. HE'S WRITING OF THEIR PATIENCE IN
[1:27:13] THAT THEY WERE WAITING. They they they
[1:27:16] came into a place of waiting. They were
[1:27:19] waiting with faith for that of his
[1:27:23] return.
[1:27:25] Notice this in the scripture. I'm just
[1:27:28] I'm just just dealing with this this
[1:27:30] portion.
[1:27:33] Paul writes of how that Timothy brought
[1:27:36] the report of their faith and charity
[1:27:39] back to him. How they were comforted
[1:27:44] and that all of the affliction and
[1:27:46] distress by your faith that you stand
[1:27:48] fast in the Lord.
[1:27:51] I think what a what a testimony because
[1:27:56] I want to just say it in this way. We
[1:27:58] know there's always there always can be
[1:28:01] an attack.
[1:28:03] But friends, it's easy when everything's
[1:28:06] on a mountain.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It's easy when everything's going just
[1:28:12] right.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; But fruit's not produced on the
[1:28:16] mountain. That's right.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; God never even wanted us to even say,
[1:28:21] "Well, you just seek for mountaintop
[1:28:23] experiences." God doesn't want you
[1:28:24] living by mountaintop experiences.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Mountaintop experiences have
[1:28:30] significance in the scriptures. They are
[1:28:33] significant moments. But what God does
[1:28:36] on a mountain, he prepares you for
[1:28:39] what's coming in the valley.
[1:28:41] What God did in Genesis 22, he prepared
[1:28:44] Abraham for Sarah's departure at the
[1:28:46] bottom of that mountain.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Same thing with the Lord Jesus on Mount
[1:28:51] Transfiguration. Prepared him as he came
[1:28:54] back down. Here was all the troubles.
[1:28:57] God prepares you in mountaintops for the
[1:29:00] valley. But the valley is where it
[1:29:03] expresses what God is doing in our
[1:29:06] lives. And what a testimony I think of
[1:29:09] like when you know you read of this and
[1:29:11] you hear of sister Stadill if you
[1:29:12] remember and I've referred to this many
[1:29:14] times where for her she looked at her
[1:29:17] own LIFE LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM my baby
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; right
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; God God didn't send you over here to
[1:29:23] PRAY FOR HIM I MUST NOT HAD THAT MUCH
[1:29:25] FAITH AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS no
[1:29:27] sister you had great faith
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; because when God decided
[1:29:33] to bring your baby on home you remain
[1:29:36] remained faithful.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; That's great faith.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Because as I said in Hebrews 11,
[1:29:45] everything doesn't always go the way
[1:29:48] that we are looking for it to go.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Look at this here in verse n. For what
[1:29:58] thanks can we render to God again for
[1:30:01] you? For all the joy wherewith we joy
[1:30:03] for your sakes before God night and day
[1:30:06] praying exceedingly that we might see
[1:30:08] your faith and might perfect that which
[1:30:12] is lacking in your faith. Paul when he
[1:30:15] writes this of perfection he's dealing
[1:30:17] with completeness and maturity.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Paul's recognizing where they're at. IN
[1:30:24] OTHER WORDS, PAUL'S NOT EXPECTING THEM
[1:30:27] TO BE WHERE he is right now.
[1:30:32] BUT HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE THAT
[1:30:35] OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE WORD HAS GOT to
[1:30:38] be laid before them. THERE'S GOT THERE'S
[1:30:40] GOING TO COME EVEN AS there is
[1:30:42] afflictions and TESTS AND PERSECUTIONS.
[1:30:45] BUT EVEN AS THE WORD IS BEING DELIVERED
[1:30:47] AND AS THEY'RE SUBMITTING TO THAT WORD,
[1:30:50] THERE WILL BE A PERFECTING
[1:30:52] of their faith. It'll be there a
[1:30:55] dissolving of more of more of self.
[1:30:58] It'll be a completeness.
[1:31:01] You see the lack of faith when Paul is
[1:31:03] speaking of this here, he's not speaking
[1:31:06] of a lack of a new birth.
[1:31:08] He's speaking of a growth.
[1:31:13] Let me just let me let me just pick up
[1:31:15] maybe one more scripture here
[1:31:19] right here. The very next scripture. Now
[1:31:22] God himself and our father and our Lord
[1:31:25] Jesus Christ direct our way unto you.
[1:31:29] And the Lord make you to increase and
[1:31:33] abound in love one toward another and
[1:31:38] toward all men even as we do toward you.
[1:31:44] Let me just say this. Paul was writing
[1:31:46] this in green. This was an example.
[1:31:51] Paul might have said,
[1:31:54] "Maybe I want to go to the Ephesian
[1:31:56] church more.
[1:31:59] Maybe he had his preferences kind of
[1:32:01] fit, you know, Ephesian church, but this
[1:32:05] was love being expressed. See, sometimes
[1:32:08] when we're love, listen, uh I'm thinking
[1:32:10] back from Friday night, I guess what it
[1:32:12] is, is not about helping little old
[1:32:14] ladies across the street,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; There's a part of that. But it's about a
[1:32:18] love like PAUL IS LOOKING AT EVEN HOW
[1:32:20] GOD WOULD BE SO ATTENTIVE TO THE NEEDS
[1:32:23] AND THE CARE THAT'S RIGHT HERE
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT AMONG THE PEOPLE AND HOW
[1:32:28] GOD WOULD TAKE PAUL AND USE PAUL AS A
[1:32:31] VESSEL TO MINISTER TO THOSE NEEDS.
[1:32:35] I think I don't I can't remember the
[1:32:37] saying exactly then you know was I think
[1:32:39] somebody made the statement about
[1:32:40] missionary work they said we're so busy
[1:32:42] looking to send somebody to Ecuador
[1:32:44] instead of looking next door.
[1:32:48] I think that's how it went. But you
[1:32:50] know, it's always like, "Oh, WAY OVER
[1:32:51] HERE." BUT WHAT ABOUT HERE?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR HOME? WHAT ABOUT
[1:32:55] RIGHT HERE? EVEN LOCALLY, NOTICE GOD
[1:32:58] MAKE you
[1:33:02] to increase and abound in love toward
[1:33:05] one another. In order for that to take
[1:33:07] place, for love to grow,
[1:33:10] well, yes, there does have to be some
[1:33:13] there'll be some differences, but that's
[1:33:16] not the only way love grows. Love also
[1:33:19] grows that as we suffer together.
[1:33:24] Love also grows even as we're we're
[1:33:27] praying for needs, we're we're looking
[1:33:30] to God and we are even as in the taking
[1:33:33] in of of God's word. that love is is
[1:33:36] growing even in situations that can seem
[1:33:39] so hard and so difficult.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Even God can allow. Remember the prophet
[1:33:45] tells us this in why Christ speaks 63.
[1:33:48] He says, "You just wait right after a
[1:33:50] good meeting." He said, "Satan, it'll be
[1:33:53] just a few days and Satan will be turned
[1:33:55] loose on that congregation."
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not a quote that I have on
[1:34:02] my refrigerator.
[1:34:04] That's not a quote that I look that I'm
[1:34:06] just like I don't I don't I don't focus
[1:34:08] on that. But what I do know is is
[1:34:10] because Satan is going to be permitted
[1:34:13] to come and test to see where did that
[1:34:18] word fall?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Did it just fall in our minds? Did it
[1:34:23] just fall in our spirit? Or has it
[1:34:25] fallen down or bringing us to a place to
[1:34:28] say, "Oh God, let it drop in me, Lord.
[1:34:32] let it drop in me. So, there's a growing
[1:34:36] I I'm just going to stop with this
[1:34:37] scripture. We'll pick it up next week.
[1:34:39] To the end,
[1:34:41] he may establish your hearts unblameable
[1:34:46] in holiness before God, even our father,
[1:34:51] at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:53] with all his saints.
[1:34:56] Paul's not speaking of a of a perfection
[1:34:59] that's the result of the new birth or a
[1:35:02] perfection as as though that someone
[1:35:04] lacks it, but rather it's the working
[1:35:07] of the Holy Spirit in one's life. It's
[1:35:11] God dealing, ministering to our lives.
[1:35:15] It's the Holy Spirit coming through the
[1:35:17] word, dealing with us, admonishing us in
[1:35:20] order to bring us to a place of
[1:35:22] perfection.
[1:35:24] I don't mind telling you as I stop here
[1:35:26] tonight.
[1:35:30] I think back to when God first got a
[1:35:32] hold of my life. You you don't you don't
[1:35:35] see all the growth that's going to be
[1:35:38] ahead.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And and just being very honest that you
[1:35:42] know, we don't start off spiritually
[1:35:44] mature. We come through all
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; of the stages. We come through all of
[1:35:50] those places and there's things that we
[1:35:52] we don't see yet about OUR LIFE. AND I'M
[1:35:54] GLAD BECAUSE IF WE SAW ALL OF THE
[1:35:58] PERFECTING THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE
[1:36:00] AND ALL THAT WAS REALLY NEEDED, you
[1:36:02] wouldn't be able to enjoy
[1:36:05] your salvation.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; BUT SEE, GOD DOES IT LITTLE BY LITTLE.
[1:36:10] IT'S AN ACCUMULATION. WHY? because he's
[1:36:13] not interested in destroying you.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; But he wants you to joy and enjoy his
[1:36:20] working in your life,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; even through all your shortcomings,
[1:36:25] through even where the word the the
[1:36:28] clarity of the word is like, "Oh, I
[1:36:31] never seen it like that before." And
[1:36:33] when you say, "I never seen it like that
[1:36:34] before." WHAT WHAT YOU REALLY REALIZE IS
[1:36:36] IS that it stabilizes you. That that
[1:36:38] that's there. That's the effect. When
[1:36:40] you see something like you never seen
[1:36:41] before, I mean, what a blessing it was
[1:36:43] on Saturday night.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; What a blessing it was on Saturday night
[1:36:47] with with with the service and you BEGIN
[1:36:49] TO SAY, "MY, I I DIDN'T SEE THAT. I
[1:36:51] HEARD different ones say, "My, you know,
[1:36:53] I WISH I WOULD HAVE HEARD THAT, YOU
[1:36:54] KNOW, YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND
[1:36:56] years ago." But, you know, aren't you
[1:36:59] thankful for it?
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to SAY IT LIKE THIS RIGHT
[1:37:02] HERE. LET ME SAY THIS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK
[1:37:04] BACK, LISTEN TO ME. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
[1:37:06] OVER YOUR LIFE, IT WASN'T THAT, "OH,
[1:37:09] GOD, I WAS FUMBLING AROUND. LORD, I I
[1:37:12] WAS I I I WISH, LORD, THERE'S A LOT OF
[1:37:14] REGRETS AND THINGS, YES, THAT WE HAVE,
[1:37:17] BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS AND PLACES
[1:37:20] THAT YOU'VE PASSED THROUGH THAT GOD'S
[1:37:23] GRACE HAS BROUGHT YOU THROUGH. AND YOUR
[1:37:25] LIFE IS A TESTIMONY OF GOD'S GRACE THAT
[1:37:29] THROUGH IT ALL, THE PROMISE OF GOD
[1:37:32] REMAINS SURE."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYONE HAS A TESTIMONY WITH GOD.
[1:37:40] IT DOESN'T ALL LOOK THE SAME. GOD DON'T
[1:37:42] WANT A SEARS AND ROBOT HARMONY HOUSE.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; But there's ONE THING THAT IS THE SAME.
[1:37:51] The new birth is from death unto life.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T GROW INTO THE NEW BIRTH, BUT
[1:37:56] THE NEW BIRTH IS A SOVEREIGN ACT BY
[1:37:58] ALMIGHTY GOD. BUT FROM THERE,
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; we grow. Right?
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; This is why remember how the scripture
[1:38:05] when it tells us Paul writing to the
[1:38:07] natural fathers, he says, "Don't
[1:38:09] exasperate. Don't provoke your children
[1:38:12] to anger lest they be discouraged."
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Parents, don't make a move. I think I
[1:38:22] got a little something up here. But you
[1:38:24] you realize that there's times that even
[1:38:27] within parenting,
[1:38:30] you could say something
[1:38:32] And there's times to say something. But
[1:38:34] you also realize that there's the times
[1:38:37] and depending on even how each one is
[1:38:39] natured. You say, "Oh, brother Samuel,
[1:38:41] it's blanket." God doesn't treat treat
[1:38:43] this congregation like a blanket. He
[1:38:45] says he knows every sheep by their
[1:38:46] character.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; God knows how to approach us.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; His character will never change. The
[1:38:54] mask might look different, but his
[1:38:56] nature always remains the same.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; It's always the word.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows how to bring us to
[1:39:01] himself.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; You see this IS THAT'S THAT'S PART OF
[1:39:06] GOD'S LOVE.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. IN OTHER
[1:39:09] WORDS, GOD'S NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU
[1:39:10] LIKE HE DEALS WITH BROTHER RICHARD.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Richard's nature a certain WAY.
[1:39:15] BROTHER GOMEZ IS NATURED A CERTAIN WAY.
[1:39:17] BROTHER JOHN CARLOS ON AND ON. BUT GOD'S
[1:39:19] GOING TO DEAL WITH US
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; IN OUR own way.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; And if we can see that, what love is
[1:39:25] that?
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; What condenses? I know he CAME DOWN AND
[1:39:29] BECAME ONE OF US, BUT HE still
[1:39:32] is manifesting himself as a servant,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; to you and I and to our needs to
[1:39:39] minister to us. You know, when we can
[1:39:41] see that, you know what that does? That
[1:39:43] accumulates faith.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; There's a love that you you see you pick
[1:39:48] up in that that accumulates faith. It's
[1:39:50] not a faith that you walk as though that
[1:39:53] oh, I've got everything under control,
[1:39:55] but it's a faith that you realize and
[1:39:57] you're resting in his word.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; And God, this is all his workmanship
[1:40:04] in that accumulation of a godly
[1:40:06] confidence in our lives. There's places
[1:40:10] he brings us to now and brings us to
[1:40:13] things within our lives right now. I
[1:40:15] know. I know. Like I said,
[1:40:18] I felt like when God got a hold of my
[1:40:20] life, I felt like boom, man. I'm rapture
[1:40:21] ready.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; I'm ready. I'm ready to go, you know,
[1:40:26] and I don't think you should, you know,
[1:40:27] you should joy. As I said, you enjoy
[1:40:29] your salvation. But then God begins to
[1:40:31] bring you along and begin to look back
[1:40:33] and you as he's working in your life,
[1:40:35] you begin to realize, oh Lord, oh my.
[1:40:39] But als those moments are very necessary
[1:40:42] also
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; because you know why humility allows him
[1:40:46] to move.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in shaming us. He's
[1:40:51] interested in that there would be an
[1:40:53] accumulation of godly confidence
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because we're looking for the rapture
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; we're looking for the rapture. Do you
[1:41:02] love him?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand and have a word of
[1:41:07] prayer.
[1:41:20] Hallelujah. Maybe we could just just
[1:41:22] pray for let's pray for one another
[1:41:27] because certainly every one of us are we
[1:41:29] are in journey and I know I may ask this
[1:41:32] a lot but
[1:41:34] I believe we're always in God's will as
[1:41:36] we're praying for one another.
[1:41:39] God would just continue to build and
[1:41:43] Lord laying his word and and help us to
[1:41:45] be help us to be sensitive to that Lord.
[1:41:48] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:41:52] Lord,
[1:41:53] we are so thankful,
[1:41:56] dear God, as we can look into your word
[1:41:58] and just to see your love and your care
[1:42:02] that you have to us, Lord.
[1:42:05] Oh, Father,
[1:42:07] within these two places, Lord, of faith
[1:42:10] and and love, God, how it works together
[1:42:13] to bring a real confidence.
[1:42:17] Lord,
[1:42:20] I know that even as Lord God, throughout
[1:42:22] this congregation, there's many things
[1:42:25] at times, Lord, that we've prayed for
[1:42:27] and maybe it didn't come or go the way
[1:42:31] that we were looking for it. But I thank
[1:42:35] oh God of how that is there is a
[1:42:38] confidence
[1:42:40] that Lord that has has kept throughout
[1:42:44] the whole time.
[1:42:46] Lord I can also remember as a young boy
[1:42:49] when we were gathered over there on Gary
[1:42:50] Avenue. I remember
[1:42:54] I still remember that service Lord where
[1:42:56] that that lady got right up out of that
[1:42:59] wheelchair.
[1:43:01] I remember that service as a just a boy.
[1:43:05] That's the last time we ever saw her.
[1:43:07] Lord,
[1:43:11] I don't I don't fault them for that. I
[1:43:12] know, Lord. There's those that come for
[1:43:14] the fishes and loaves, but maybe they
[1:43:16] just weren't ordained, Lord.
[1:43:19] But father, how how is it when I think
[1:43:22] of little Edith Wright and I think of
[1:43:25] Lord even the prophet would point out of
[1:43:28] that sister in that wheelchair. He would
[1:43:30] speak of it in I believe it's power
[1:43:32] transformation refer to it in that first
[1:43:35] message of the oddball and he said we've
[1:43:38] prayed but don't know why that God has
[1:43:40] not healed her as of yet but he spoke
[1:43:43] these words and I never forgot about it.
[1:43:45] You said what a beautiful character that
[1:43:47] she has.
[1:43:49] Lord,
[1:43:51] it certainly is all in your hands.
[1:43:55] And even in those settings, we know,
[1:43:58] Lord, there is absolutely nothing
[1:44:01] impossible with you. And if we're
[1:44:04] believers, your prophet told us in
[1:44:06] spiritual food and due season, he said,
[1:44:09] "Then you as a believer, there's nothing
[1:44:10] impossible with you either."
[1:44:13] that Lord, we also we're aware
[1:44:17] that God, you're going to have
[1:44:19] testimonies
[1:44:22] that are going to stand there and say,
[1:44:24] "I looked for my healing, but I never
[1:44:27] received it on this side." But they
[1:44:30] stood faithful
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; to you, Lord, because there was a love
[1:44:35] that carried him beyond
[1:44:40] any lack of understanding.
[1:44:43] love that would take a hold of faith by
[1:44:45] the hand and say, "I I don't understand.
[1:44:48] I've we've prayed for this and prayed
[1:44:50] for maybe our little girl or prayed for
[1:44:52] a boy or this or that and and how things
[1:44:55] have went."
[1:44:58] And yet, Lord, we know that
[1:45:02] even within daily living,
[1:45:06] there's a faith just daily living, Lord,
[1:45:09] of daily striving.
[1:45:11] Even right here tonight,
[1:45:14] we would never never equate ourselves
[1:45:16] with the martyrs.
[1:45:18] Never.
[1:45:20] But yet, Father, your prophet would tell
[1:45:22] us we're living in a more deceitful age.
[1:45:27] He said, because back then they could,
[1:45:29] they knew their enemy. He said, but
[1:45:31] right now it's such a deception.
[1:45:35] It's come under the name of church and
[1:45:37] religion. and how that Satan so subtly
[1:45:41] would like to just take from the people
[1:45:44] of God the great riches and treasures
[1:45:48] that God that you have for us and what
[1:45:50] you've delivered to us. Father, I pray
[1:45:53] for each and every one of my brothers
[1:45:55] and sisters tonight.
[1:45:57] Dear God,
[1:45:59] may our roots go deeper in you. Yes,
[1:46:03] Lord.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Give us strength, Lord, if you Lord, as
[1:46:07] you send the mountaintop experiences,
[1:46:10] let our hearts be captured.
[1:46:14] Let God the preparation move in our
[1:46:17] lives that God will anchor us
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; in the valley
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; to bring forth fruit.
[1:46:26] Oh father, may the Lord God the faith
[1:46:30] and love just Lord growing Lord in our
[1:46:33] lives just knowing Lord there's a lot of
[1:46:36] times it's just not us sitting around.
[1:46:39] It don't grow just by sitting around and
[1:46:41] and listening.
[1:46:43] Yet faith does come by the word. But
[1:46:46] it's where many of these things, Lord,
[1:46:48] it also is coupled together
[1:46:51] through experiences,
[1:46:54] through situations
[1:46:56] that you permit in your infinite wisdom
[1:47:00] to come our way. even Lord
[1:47:04] through some of our poor decisions.
[1:47:10] But help us.
[1:47:13] Help us, Lord,
[1:47:15] perfect what's lacking, Lord, in our
[1:47:19] faith.
[1:47:22] Make us, Lord, as Paul wrote there in
[1:47:25] that first epistle to the Thessalonans.
[1:47:30] But Lord, make you to increase and
[1:47:33] abound
[1:47:35] in love one toward another, even as we
[1:47:38] do toward you. Father, I pray,
[1:47:43] grant that, Lord God, for
[1:47:46] our assembly, Lord. Grant, Lord, not
[1:47:50] only our assembly, but Lord, the bride
[1:47:51] around the world,
[1:47:54] oh God, how that Lord, the enemy is
[1:47:56] just, dear God, always was always
[1:47:59] working to try to break confidence in
[1:48:02] the word and trying to bring division.
[1:48:07] Sometimes, Lord, it's not even
[1:48:09] recognized in that way. But help us,
[1:48:12] Lord, help us to be sensitive. And not
[1:48:15] only that, but help us Lord to look
[1:48:18] beyond.
[1:48:21] And Lord Jesus
[1:48:24] to look to you in all things.
[1:48:27] Cuz sometimes the things that you allow
[1:48:29] us to see,
[1:48:31] I wonder if you're not looking and
[1:48:33] testing to see what our attitude's going
[1:48:35] to be towards it.
[1:48:38] Are we going to go and talk about how
[1:48:40] wrong they are? at least to what we feel
[1:48:44] how wrong they are. Or are we going to
[1:48:48] take it to you in prayer?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Lord God, help us. I pray
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; make us, Lord, if Paul could write that
[1:48:59] to that church,
[1:49:01] that's to our lives as well. Make us to,
[1:49:03] Lord, increase and abound in love one
[1:49:06] toward another. Father, even right here,
[1:49:09] God, among the young people, among,
[1:49:12] Lord, every age, oh God. Lord, how I
[1:49:15] thank you, dear God. Oh, I've got, Lord
[1:49:18] God, I've got friends, Lord. I've got
[1:49:19] great friends in other other places,
[1:49:22] Lord.
[1:49:23] But, Father, you didn't call me to
[1:49:26] pastor in other places. I've got good
[1:49:29] friends, but right here, right here,
[1:49:32] this is my family.
[1:49:35] Not just my natural family, but God,
[1:49:36] this is that portion that Father, you've
[1:49:39] put in my heart to care for, to pray for
[1:49:43] these needs. And Lord, I don't believe
[1:49:44] you didn't just do that here. That's not
[1:49:46] just in my heart, but Father, in the
[1:49:49] hearts of your children.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Dear God, help us, Lord.
[1:49:56] Make us to increase, Lord.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; May the Holy Spirit, oh God, just so
[1:50:02] teach us. Help us, Lord, through every
[1:50:05] circumstance. It always isn't pleasant,
[1:50:08] but Father, may we always be sensitive
[1:50:10] to your teaching,
[1:50:12] knowing that God, you're there wanting
[1:50:15] to perfect us.
[1:50:17] Help us, Lord. Make us more like you.
[1:50:22] May there be God. I pray even in this
[1:50:24] year.
[1:50:26] May our lives may there be more of an
[1:50:29] accumulation of godly confidence
[1:50:33] and emptying out of other things and
[1:50:36] accumulating the right things. Lord God,
[1:50:39] I want to make more room. I want to
[1:50:42] empty up. Lord God, guide us. Direct us.
[1:50:46] If there's things, Lord, that we're
[1:50:48] holding on to, maybe it's things that we
[1:50:50] know of. Lord God, may we ask you for
[1:50:53] grace and say, "Lord,
[1:50:55] I want to let go of that. I don't want
[1:50:57] to carry that no more.
[1:51:00] I don't want to I don't want to have
[1:51:01] that part of this of my life reserved
[1:51:04] for that. I want to let it go.
[1:51:08] Grant it, Lord. Give me grace.
[1:51:12] Help us, Lord. I pray
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:20] Give me a heart
[1:51:23] that's filled
[1:51:26] with love. Oh, and make
[1:51:31] me more
[1:51:34] like.
[1:51:38] Oh Jesus,
[1:51:41] make
[1:51:43] me more. Yes, Lord.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:51:52] make
[1:51:54] me more like thee.
[1:52:02] Oh, and give me a heart
[1:52:07] that's filled
[1:52:10] with love.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Make me more like.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord.
[1:52:31] The
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[1:52:36] make
[1:52:38] me more
[1:52:41] like thee.
[1:52:47] Give me
[1:52:49] a heart
[1:52:52] that's filled
[1:52:55] with love
[1:52:58] and grace. Make me more
[1:53:03] like thee. Make me more like thee. Oh
[1:53:09] Jesus, make
[1:53:11] me more
[1:53:14] like thee.
[1:53:18] Jesus,
[1:53:20] make
[1:53:22] me
[1:53:25] like thee.
[1:53:31] Lord, give me
[1:53:34] a heart
[1:53:36] that's filled
[1:53:39] with love
[1:53:42] and make
[1:53:44] me more
[1:53:47] thy
[1:53:50] Lord. Give me a heart
[1:53:55] that's filled
[1:53:58] with your love
[1:54:01] and may
[1:54:04] be more.
[1:54:11] I want to live
[1:54:15] the way
[1:54:18] he wants me
[1:54:21] to live.
[1:54:23] I want to give
[1:54:27] until there's just no more
[1:54:33] to give.
[1:54:35] I want to love
[1:54:40] till there's just no more love.
[1:54:47] I could never
[1:54:50] ever love
[1:54:53] my Lord.
[1:54:57] Oh, I want to live
[1:55:02] the way
[1:55:05] he wants me to live.
[1:55:09] I want to give
[1:55:13] until there's just no more
[1:55:19] to give.
[1:55:21] I want to love
[1:55:26] to
[1:55:30] more love.
[1:55:33] I can never
[1:55:36] ever
[1:55:42] I want to live. I want to live
[1:55:48] away.
[1:55:50] He wants me to live.
[1:55:55] I want to give
[1:55:59] until there is just no more to give.
[1:56:07] I want to love
[1:56:11] love to be there is just so
[1:56:17] love but I can never
[1:56:21] ever
[1:56:24] love.
[1:56:26] I want to love
[1:56:31] until there is just no more.
[1:56:40] I could never ever
[1:56:50] create in me
[1:56:54] a clean
[1:56:56] heart.
[1:57:00] Oh
