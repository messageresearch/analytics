[48:37] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[48:40] out of it
[48:41] are the issues of life and put away from
[48:44] thee
[48:45] a forward mouth and perverse lips
[48:49] put power put far from thee
[48:52] let thine eyes look right on and let
[48:54] thine eyelids look straight before thee
[48:57] ponder the path of thy feet and let all
[48:59] the ways
[49:00] be established turn not to the right
[49:03] hand
[49:03] nor to the left remove thy foot
[49:07] from evil i also want to look in the
[49:09] book of john the seventh chapter
[49:12] there solomon is writing about the heart
[49:14] and he says out of the heart
[49:16] floweth the issues of life and you look
[49:19] here in john the seventh chapter
[49:21] and just one verse i want to read here
[49:24] this evening john
[49:26] the seventh chapter and i want to look
[49:28] here in the 38th
[49:29] verse maybe we could just begin with the
[49:32] 37th verse i know this is a very
[49:34] very familiar scripture speaking about
[49:36] christ being the water of life
[49:38] and it said in the last day that great
[49:41] day of the feast
[49:42] jesus stood and cried saying
[49:46] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[49:48] and drink
[49:49] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[49:53] hath said out of his belly
[49:56] shall flow rivers of living water
[50:00] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[50:03] living water we ask the lord this
[50:05] evening to add the blessing
[50:06] to the reading of his word as you may
[50:08] have your seats here this afternoon for
[50:11] just a few moments from those scriptures
[50:13] tonight if i
[50:14] could take just a few minutes of your
[50:16] time to speak to here on something
[50:18] that's up on my heart just to open these
[50:20] meetings up with tonight
[50:22] i want to speak to you for a few moments
[50:23] on unclogging
[50:25] the channels unclogging the channels and
[50:27] i realize we're living in the time right
[50:30] now
[50:30] we we know we have four seasons of the
[50:33] year we have fall winter
[50:34] spring and summer and we're living in a
[50:36] time right now that we could call spring
[50:39] and it's a time where people call it
[50:41] spring cleaning or
[50:42] getting rid of things or making room for
[50:44] more
[50:45] i know some people call it purging out
[50:48] their closets
[50:49] purging out garages purging out sheds
[50:51] all kinds of things
[50:52] you can call it and i believe that what
[50:54] is happening in the natural
[50:56] is only a sign of something that would
[50:58] be happening in the spiritual i
[51:00] believe if the world is cleaning out
[51:01] things getting ready for more stuff to
[51:03] come in
[51:04] of the natural then i believe the church
[51:06] of the living god is making room for
[51:08] more of the things of god
[51:09] amen to come into their lives and and
[51:11] you look in the book of psalms 19 verse
[51:13] 12 just lay a foundation here
[51:15] david said who can understand his heirs
[51:18] cleanse thou
[51:19] me from secret faults he says in psalms
[51:22] 51 verse 2
[51:23] wash me thoroughly from my iniquities
[51:25] and cleanse me from my sin
[51:28] verse 5 behold i was shapen in iniquity
[51:31] and in sin did my mother conceive me in
[51:34] verse 7 he says purge me with hyssop
[51:36] and i shall be clean wash me and i shall
[51:39] be whiter than snow
[51:41] he comes along in psalm 79 and verse 9
[51:44] and says help us
[51:45] o god of our salvation for the glory of
[51:47] thy name
[51:48] and deliver us and purge away our sins
[51:52] for thy name's sake how many could just
[51:54] say tonight lord i want to be purged
[51:56] amen i
[51:56] i want to i want to purge you know i
[51:58] don't want to leave here the way i came
[52:00] i don't want to leave with the same
[52:01] thoughts or the same
[52:03] maybe the same ideas or the same
[52:04] directions i want to leave here changed
[52:07] amen i want to leave here purge now we
[52:09] begin to talk about purging and how can
[52:11] you not talk about purging but think
[52:13] about the word purgatory
[52:14] and the prophet of god said this in the
[52:16] way of a true prophet he said i do
[52:17] believe in a purgatory
[52:19] he said but i believe it's right now he
[52:21] said you purge your own soul
[52:23] he said purgatory means to purge so when
[52:25] you see that you've done
[52:27] something wrong he said get out there
[52:28] and clean it out of you
[52:30] by confession and crying and fasting and
[52:33] praying
[52:33] he said someone even laughed at me when
[52:35] the lord came here not long ago and give
[52:37] me a vision
[52:38] i always wanted to see about binding
[52:40] that serpent i always wondered how to
[52:42] i should step out like that when that's
[52:44] what i've wanted all my life then i
[52:46] began to fast and pray
[52:47] and said what you do that for and i said
[52:50] in there
[52:51] he said i was not sincere enough after
[52:53] he came
[52:54] then i wanted to purge myself not wait
[52:56] till you die
[52:57] and let some priest try to purge you but
[53:00] purge your soul
[53:01] see but see they took it out of the
[53:03] authoritative word
[53:04] put it over in the hands of some
[53:06] man-made dogma to bring
[53:07] money into the church because they took
[53:09] out the look at the worldly things in
[53:11] the worldly church great powers in the
[53:13] world political
[53:14] powers amen but god looks at his word
[53:16] amen so we're not here tonight
[53:18] amen to purge ourselves by the ideas of
[53:20] a man or by the traditions of
[53:22] denomination
[53:23] amen or the creeds of religion we are
[53:25] here amen to purge ourselves by the word
[53:28] of god in any word
[53:29] amen that's contrary to god's word is
[53:31] wrong as far as i'm concerned it's the
[53:34] word or nothing yes sir
[53:36] as far as i'm concerned it's the word or
[53:38] nothing he said
[53:39] yes sir now when brother branham
[53:41] preaches the message you know
[53:42] he'll actually preach a message on doors
[53:44] and he clearly identifies
[53:46] he meant that there are many doors in
[53:48] the heart of the human being
[53:49] that god himself wants to gain entrance
[53:52] to there is the door of pride there is
[53:54] the door the private life
[53:56] there is the door of faith there's all
[53:57] kinds of doors he meant in the door of
[54:00] the heart so rem calls it door to the
[54:01] heart or doors in a door
[54:03] he meant and he's showing you that god
[54:05] is wanting to get in there
[54:06] and he's wanting to make room for
[54:08] himself there there's possibly
[54:10] something in those compartments he
[54:11] mentor in those areas of your heart that
[54:13] is occupying
[54:15] he meant a place that god desired for
[54:17] himself to dwell now
[54:18] in proverbs 4 solomon instructs us amen
[54:21] to keep thy heart with all diligence in
[54:23] the message
[54:24] the word became flesh india report he
[54:26] said listen my christian friend
[54:28] if there is any alt in your heart
[54:30] against anyone
[54:31] amen go to them now and be reconciled
[54:33] forget all the past
[54:35] and if you've been having up and down
[54:37] life remember something
[54:38] amen has come into that heart something
[54:41] has moved into those thoughts
[54:42] no matter who your enemy is love him
[54:45] amen
[54:46] love him no matter what's happened let
[54:47] it go amen
[54:49] after all you're in a field with weeds
[54:51] we realize that but we must both grow
[54:53] together
[54:54] we've got to come up together for a good
[54:56] whale amen cannot put forth evil waters
[54:59] and neither can an
[55:00] evil whale amen put forth good waters a
[55:03] tree
[55:03] cannot bring forth corrupt fruit and
[55:05] good fruit at the same time
[55:07] he said so let's either make the whole
[55:09] well clean
[55:10] or let's make the whole well dirty one
[55:12] or the other see
[55:13] amen for it's dirty to begin with so
[55:16] let's clean it out
[55:17] amen the whales and say lord pour in
[55:20] your spirit
[55:21] amen and lead me o god lead me so the
[55:23] prophet is saying
[55:24] amen that a whale could not put forth
[55:26] dirty water he meant in clean water a
[55:29] tree could not put forth corrupt fruit
[55:31] he meant an incorruptible fruit and
[55:32] therefore he meant a church cannot put
[55:35] forth a good spirit and a bad spirit
[55:37] it's either putting forth a good spirit
[55:39] amen or it's putting forth a bad spirit
[55:40] now there's got to be an origin
[55:42] amen where those spirits are coming from
[55:44] and when you get a church
[55:45] and then there's full of ideas and full
[55:47] of traditions and full of religion
[55:49] and full of all kinds of things it will
[55:51] put forth he meant a dirty whale it'll
[55:53] put forth a whale
[55:54] that there's no power to wash the center
[55:57] there's no power to clean up the
[55:58] unbeliever
[55:59] there's no power to set the captive free
[56:02] amen but what about it tonight on the
[56:03] first night of this meeting why don't we
[56:06] amen let the holy ghost clean out the
[56:08] well amen let the holy ghost clean out
[56:10] the church
[56:11] let the holy ghost clean out the young
[56:12] people listen amen i'll tell you what we
[56:14] need is a good old-fashioned
[56:16] nester and amen to where everything that
[56:18] we've been bogged down with
[56:19] is gone amen when the wind of god begins
[56:22] to blow do you realize when the wind
[56:24] blows
[56:24] amen things are laying down if they are
[56:27] not bolted and anchored it's going to
[56:28] blow away with it amen look outside the

[58:50] living god cannot flow the ideas of this
[58:52] message
[58:53] and the ideas of pentecostalism outside
[58:56] of this word
[58:57] there is no anointing there is no
[58:58] inspiration amen therefore
[59:00] church why don't tonight we clean
[59:02] everything out of the church
[59:04] that is not in the message clean
[59:06] everything out of the church
[59:07] that was not taught by a prophet listen
[59:10] you're looking at one preacher that
[59:11] don't care what your grandma said
[59:12] i don't care what your baptist pastor

[59:17] and if a prophet said it there ought to
[59:18] be some people that's got to cut
[59:20] amen to believe it and to preach it
[59:23] listen this is not a baptist church
[59:25] this is not a denominational church this
[59:27] is a house of worship
[59:29] this is a house of god where he desires
[59:32] amen that his spirit would flow through
[59:33] the church
[59:34] hey the days of trying to be identified
[59:36] with one thing one group
[59:37] and identify with another them days are
[59:39] long gone church

[59:46] is no anointing hey now don't don't
[59:48] start bumping me amen let me preach here
[59:50] for a second
[59:50] you've got to believe what the prophet
[59:52] said or your church will be as powerless
[59:54] as 900 denominations amen but thank god
[59:58] for this message
[59:59] amen thank god for this prophet that
[1:00:01] we're not sitting on the fence tonight
[1:00:03] amen wondering what to believe and
[1:00:04] wonder where to go we have been purged
[1:00:07] amen by the word of almighty god and
[1:00:09] it's not bitter water here
[1:00:11] it's not corruptible fruit here it's not
[1:00:14] figs one day
[1:00:15] and buries the next it's the saith the
[1:00:18] lord
[1:00:18] that is flowing through the church
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:21] to think tonight that we have seen the
[1:00:23] results of the life of somebody
[1:00:26] that said they serve god one day and
[1:00:28] believe the message one day
[1:00:29] and then serve the devil the next day
[1:00:31] and believe the devils lie the next day
[1:00:33] the problem of god picks this up in
[1:00:35] jehoshaphat and says all that together
[1:00:37] making it under consideration
[1:00:39] he said jehoshaphat had purposed in his
[1:00:41] heart
[1:00:42] he meant to serve the lord and declined
[1:00:44] to the things that his father david did
[1:00:46] he meant at the beginning and the
[1:00:48] prophet said i like that
[1:00:50] he meant at the beginning let's say that
[1:00:52] together at the beginning
[1:00:53] amen at the beginning see in other words
[1:00:56] he went back
[1:00:57] to the old landmark and they clean out
[1:01:00] all the roles
[1:01:01] it would be good for pentecost they
[1:01:03] meant to go back to the old landmark
[1:01:05] it would be good for all of us to go
[1:01:07] back to the old landmark and clean out
[1:01:09] the rose
[1:01:10] he said i'm talking supposedly to mostly
[1:01:11] pentecostal here this afternoon
[1:01:13] what would happen if actually this
[1:01:15] church went back to the old landmark
[1:01:18] he said you talk about it cleaning up
[1:01:20] amen there'd be one around here
[1:01:22] it sure would he said you would be
[1:01:24] acting different
[1:01:25] you would be dressing different you
[1:01:27] would be talking different
[1:01:28] it'd just be all together a different
[1:01:30] church if we went back
[1:01:32] and then to the old landmark where amen
[1:01:35] we started from
[1:01:37] amen so the devil wants to put something
[1:01:39] between you
[1:01:40] amen in the old landmark amen because if
[1:01:42] you lose sight
[1:01:43] of the old landmark amen you'll lose
[1:01:46] sight of your future
[1:01:47] you'll lose sight of your conviction
[1:01:48] you'll lose sight of your hope
[1:01:50] amen but if you keep the road clean amen
[1:01:52] between you and the old landmark
[1:01:54] amen that no matter what you go through
[1:01:56] amen you can always look back of the old
[1:01:59] landmark
[1:01:59] and say there is where it happened amen
[1:02:02] and i wonder tonight
[1:02:03] is there anybody here says i know i've
[1:02:05] got a landmark
[1:02:06] amen i know i've got somewhere amen that
[1:02:09] the pillar of fire
[1:02:10] amen came down into my soul and i drove
[1:02:13] the stake down
[1:02:14] amen i know i've got a landmark but
[1:02:16] there's been some things
[1:02:18] amen that's got between me and the
[1:02:19] landmark amendment i believe the holy
[1:02:21] ghost
[1:02:22] amen is sending a stick of holy ghost
[1:02:24] dynamite he met into these meetings this
[1:02:26] weekend
[1:02:27] he meant to clean out everything that is
[1:02:29] between you and the old landmark which
[1:02:32] is the word
[1:02:34] now when you begin to think about
[1:02:35] channels amen you'll find that there are
[1:02:37] many channels
[1:02:38] in the body of christ amen that he
[1:02:40] himself placed there
[1:02:42] amen that he himself wants to flow
[1:02:44] through when you look at what a channel
[1:02:46] means
[1:02:46] it is a prepared route somebody say a
[1:02:48] prepared route
[1:02:50] it is a prepared route amen for
[1:02:52] something to pass through
[1:02:54] into something else it is something that
[1:02:56] has been prepared
[1:02:58] he meant for something to pass through
[1:03:00] into something else
[1:03:02] amen so god works through channels and
[1:03:04] god prepares the channel
[1:03:06] and the devil does everything he can
[1:03:10] he meant to clog up the channel amen god
[1:03:13] prepares the channel and the devil does
[1:03:16] everything he can
[1:03:17] a meant to clog up the channel now when
[1:03:19] a channel becomes clogged up
[1:03:21] it actually means it's blocked amen so
[1:03:24] that little or nothing
[1:03:25] amen can pass through to unclog
[1:03:28] something
[1:03:29] means you've got to remove all the
[1:03:31] accumulated matter
[1:03:33] that is built up in that channel amen i
[1:03:35] believe another word for unclocking
[1:03:37] amen is revival amen i believe another
[1:03:40] word
[1:03:40] amen for unclogging the channels meant
[1:03:43] he was reviving the channels
[1:03:44] amen i believe a revival a minister
[1:03:47] washed out all the unbelief
[1:03:49] amen washed out all the sin amen and let
[1:03:52] the people come out
[1:03:53] amen and see that god is still god and
[1:03:56] his word is still true
[1:03:57] and his power is still here and his
[1:03:59] anointing is still upon the church
[1:04:01] and the message is still thus saith the
[1:04:03] lord and the message is still the
[1:04:05] absolute
[1:04:06] amen outside of it we are a confused
[1:04:08] group of people
[1:04:09] amen but with it tonight amen there's
[1:04:12] nothing the devil can send in the church
[1:04:14] amen it'll cut the flow off listen he
[1:04:17] may send something in
[1:04:18] amen but if there's an anointing there
[1:04:20] it'll pick that thing up and blow it to
[1:04:22] kingdom come
[1:04:24] now how many says lord clean out the
[1:04:26] channels amen amen lord clean out the
[1:04:28] channels
[1:04:29] amen let me see that god is still god
[1:04:32] the bible says
[1:04:33] amen that i am the lord and i change
[1:04:35] amen not
[1:04:36] amen therefore ye sons of jacob are not
[1:04:39] consumed now when you begin to look at
[1:04:41] channels you've got to realize the
[1:04:43] channel of god
[1:04:44] is always open amen the channel of god
[1:04:47] is always open
[1:04:48] but god's channel is never caught amen
[1:04:51] the channel of god
[1:04:52] is always open he said remember church
[1:04:55] god's words are true
[1:04:56] i believe the right mental attitude
[1:04:58] towards any divine promise of god
[1:05:00] amen will bring it to pass if you can
[1:05:03] look at it in the right way
[1:05:05] but remember here's been my standard in
[1:05:08] life he says i have tried
[1:05:10] amen to do this what have you tried to
[1:05:12] do brother branham
[1:05:13] the first thing i want to find out
[1:05:14] whether it's the will of god or not
[1:05:17] then i know it's god's will then the
[1:05:19] next thing
[1:05:20] is my objective to it and my motive in
[1:05:22] doing it then if it's the will of god
[1:05:25] and my objective is right and my motive
[1:05:27] is right i have faith that it will be
[1:05:29] done
[1:05:30] because first it is the will of god and
[1:05:32] my objective is to glorify him
[1:05:34] and my motive is to give him all the
[1:05:36] glory see there's no selfish motives
[1:05:39] about it
[1:05:39] you have a selfish motive it won't work
[1:05:42] he said if your objective is to make
[1:05:43] money for yourself or something
[1:05:45] you'll never succeed he said so there is
[1:05:47] genuine faith
[1:05:49] but you must come into the right channel
[1:05:51] the real channel of god
[1:05:53] to have the genuine faith there's human
[1:05:56] faith
[1:05:56] amen then there's the faith of god let's
[1:05:58] let's separate that there's human faith
[1:06:00] then there is the faith of god and you
[1:06:02] must have a godly faith to believe
[1:06:05] now then to have godly faith you must
[1:06:07] have the mind of christ in you
[1:06:10] see then that's how god projects to you
[1:06:12] amen visions and revelation
[1:06:15] and all these things comes amen by the
[1:06:17] mind of christ being
[1:06:19] in you see then that opens another
[1:06:21] channel to say
[1:06:22] where is the mind of christ is the mind
[1:06:24] of christ in heaven
[1:06:26] is the mind of christ in a grave in
[1:06:27] jeffersonville is the mind of christ
[1:06:30] stuck out in the mountains of arizona
[1:06:32] amen the prophet said amen we have the
[1:06:35] mind of christ
[1:06:36] now you will never find the channel of
[1:06:38] god without the mind of god
[1:06:41] without the mind of god you'll never
[1:06:43] find the channel of god
[1:06:44] that's why paul would say for who hath
[1:06:46] known the mind of the lord
[1:06:48] that he may instruct him but we have
[1:06:51] let's say this together we have
[1:06:53] the mind of christ amen we're not
[1:06:56] looking for it
[1:06:57] we're not trying to find it amen we have
[1:07:00] the mind of christ
[1:07:01] amen here is the secret of this amen the
[1:07:04] word is in the pride as it was in mary
[1:07:07] amen the bride has the mind of christ
[1:07:11] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:07:13] his word amen she performs the command
[1:07:16] of his word
[1:07:17] in his name amen for she has
[1:07:20] thus saith the lord amen aren't you
[1:07:23] aren't you thankful to know tonight
[1:07:25] we're not looking for thus saith the
[1:07:26] lord and we didn't just have thus saith
[1:07:29] the lord
[1:07:29] and we're not just going to have the
[1:07:31] saith the lord but right here brother
[1:07:33] jim tonight
[1:07:34] in the house of god we have the saith
[1:07:38] the lord
[1:07:38] you say well you're not a prophet and i
[1:07:40] don't see brother branham here
[1:07:42] but this message amen is thus saith
[1:07:45] the lord if the prophet said there is
[1:07:47] one god we say
[1:07:49] amen because that was thus saith the
[1:07:52] lord
[1:07:52] if the prophet said you were born amen a
[1:07:55] gene seed of almighty god
[1:07:57] we don't question it we don't back up on
[1:07:59] it we say amen to it
[1:08:01] because that's thus saith the lord if
[1:08:04] the prophet said the seventh seal is
[1:08:06] open
[1:08:06] we don't back up on it we don't bury our
[1:08:09] heads in the sand
[1:08:10] like a bunch of ducks without a
[1:08:11] direction to go we stand here
[1:08:14] and say we've got the safer come on
[1:08:16] church
[1:08:17] the devil's been pushing and the devil's
[1:08:19] been pushing
[1:08:20] and the devil's been pushing but it's
[1:08:22] time somebody
[1:08:23] ain't then rise up and start pushing
[1:08:25] back and then we're not a bunch of
[1:08:26] hybrid christians here
[1:08:28] trying to mix some concoction together
[1:08:30] to bring a revival in the church
[1:08:32] we have got to saith the lord tonight we
[1:08:35] have got the word
[1:08:36] of the lord in the church and the mind
[1:08:39] of christ
[1:08:40] is here to fulfill the will of god
[1:08:44] listen church we're not looking for
[1:08:46] direction we've got direction
[1:08:48] we're not looking for revelation we've
[1:08:50] got revelation we're not and he said
[1:08:52] with andrew we want more yes we do
[1:08:54] but we don't want any revelation outside
[1:08:57] of what a prophet has said now
[1:09:00] ah the devil don't like that but he
[1:09:02] ought to know by now i really don't care
[1:09:06] we have clogged the channels long enough
[1:09:08] with man's ideas
[1:09:09] we have clogged the channels long enough
[1:09:12] with brother adam told brothers soul and
[1:09:13] soul
[1:09:14] and sister so and so 50 years ago amen
[1:09:16] we've clogged the channels long enough
[1:09:18] you realize we got people sitting in
[1:09:19] message churches
[1:09:20] that's afraid to read message books
[1:09:22] because of some false doctrine
[1:09:24] that's been taught we got young people
[1:09:26] afraid ain't meant to turn a tape
[1:09:28] hey i'm gonna preach right through it
[1:09:30] tonight amen we got young people
[1:09:32] afraid to turn a tape on amen because
[1:09:35] they're afraid
[1:09:35] they'll be confused listen you'll be
[1:09:37] confused without a prophet
[1:09:39] amen but when you hear a prophet it'll
[1:09:42] move you from being confused
[1:09:44] into being anointed and revelated with a
[1:09:47] vision before you
[1:09:50] now we're not here tonight trying to
[1:09:52] find the mind of god
[1:09:53] we've got it we all agree we've got it
[1:09:56] tonight
[1:09:56] amen we are not here like cain and abel
[1:09:58] who in genesis 4
[1:10:00] amen was trying to find the channel of
[1:10:02] god the bible said by faith abel
[1:10:04] amen offered unto god a more excellent
[1:10:06] sacrifice amen than cain
[1:10:08] by which he obtained what witness that
[1:10:11] he
[1:10:11] was righteous amen god testifying
[1:10:15] of his gifts and by it being dead amen
[1:10:18] yet
[1:10:18] speaketh now watch this the prophet said
[1:10:20] cain was just as religious as abel was
[1:10:25] both made altars both loved god both
[1:10:27] made sacrifices both worshipped
[1:10:29] they both paid tithes they both done
[1:10:31] everything just alike
[1:10:33] he said but able by faith which is what
[1:10:36] is the revelation he meant the word of
[1:10:39] god
[1:10:40] revealed made plain showed out and
[1:10:42] vindicated brother brown even got happy
[1:10:44] brother samuel and said glory amen cain
[1:10:48] made an offering but god didn't
[1:10:49] vindicate it amen god required worship
[1:10:52] amen but by the true channel think about
[1:10:55] this
[1:10:55] prophet said by the true channel you say
[1:10:58] well my church is it
[1:10:59] he said wait a minute god interprets his
[1:11:01] own word by its
[1:11:02] terms that he spoke him he said cain
[1:11:05] said i am religious
[1:11:06] i am a lover of my maker i offer thee
[1:11:08] this fine altar
[1:11:09] i offer to you this sacrifice i built
[1:11:11] all these things up for because i love
[1:11:13] you
[1:11:14] and abel the same thing amen watch us
[1:11:17] now it's the one that's vindicated
[1:11:20] it's the one that's proven and god come
[1:11:23] down
[1:11:24] and received abel's sacrifice because by
[1:11:28] revelation he had struck amen the true
[1:11:31] channel of god
[1:11:32] that was accepted they've been both boys
[1:11:35] doing the same thing
[1:11:36] amen but there was a big difference here
[1:11:38] there was a seed difference
[1:11:40] amen cain was of that wicked one amen
[1:11:43] abel was not of the wicked one
[1:11:45] hey are you in the church amen therefore
[1:11:47] cain was probing and pulling
[1:11:49] and picking trying to find he'd been the
[1:11:51] channel of god

[1:11:56] tapped in
[1:11:56] to that true channel and i'll say this
[1:11:58] the message of the hour
[1:12:00] amen has reopened amen the true channel
[1:12:03] of revelation to the church amen that
[1:12:05] had been clogged up
[1:12:07] with theology and man-made theories and
[1:12:10] seminary ideas
[1:12:11] had clogged up the revelation in the
[1:12:13] church so where people didn't even
[1:12:15] believe in prophets
[1:12:16] they didn't even believe in divine
[1:12:17] healing they didn't even believe in the
[1:12:19] manifestation of the gifts
[1:12:20] they didn't even believe that god amen
[1:12:22] can still anoint a man
[1:12:24] and speak to that man and squirrels come
[1:12:26] into existence
[1:12:27] amen but god said in the last days help
[1:12:30] me church
[1:12:30] amen i will open up the channel again i
[1:12:33] will open up the channel
[1:12:35] that i can flow into the church listen
[1:12:37] this message didn't come
[1:12:38] amen for a personality amen to flow in
[1:12:41] the church
[1:12:41] this message didn't come amen for a
[1:12:44] preacher's idea

[1:12:47] is a channel
[1:12:48] amen that is prepared from the almighty
[1:12:51] god
[1:12:51] that has been prepared for his spirit
[1:12:54] amen to flow back in the church
[1:12:57] oh somebody shout thank you lord for
[1:12:59] opening up the channel
[1:13:01] amen thank you lord amen for sending a
[1:13:03] prophet

[1:13:06] there is no such thing as three gods
[1:13:08] there is no such thing amen is putting
[1:13:11] your name on a church roll
[1:13:12] and being a part of pride there is no
[1:13:14] such thing
[1:13:15] as putting your name on a church card
[1:13:17] the only way these things come
[1:13:19] is by a birth of the holy ghost coming
[1:13:22] in the soul

[1:13:56] what i do
[1:13:57] so the prophet come he meant not to hurt

[1:21:51] flesh detectives well that was in the
[1:21:53] spirit and that was in the flesh
[1:21:55] and that was oh
[1:21:58] you would have been there on the days
[1:22:00] and told miriam she's probably in the
[1:22:01] flesh too
[1:22:02] but you know what she had done what i'm
[1:22:03] getting ready to tell you i don't care
[1:22:06] she picked up a tambourine and she began
[1:22:08] to jump and dance up and down the bank
[1:22:10] he said why because the holy spirit amen
[1:22:13] likes to catch
[1:22:15] he meant from one to another like an
[1:22:17] atom in a relay race
[1:22:18] it began to jump from one to another and
[1:22:20] they all got tambourines
[1:22:23] brother jim they all got tambourines and
[1:22:25] just had a real
[1:22:26] jubilee he said if that ain't the holy
[1:22:29] ghost i don't know what it is
[1:22:30] there they were singing in the spirit
[1:22:33] amen dancing
[1:22:35] in the spirit beating all the music and
[1:22:37] clapping their hands
[1:22:38] what a time they was having he said why
[1:22:41] they was annihilated from their enemy
[1:22:44] they was annihilated from their enemy
[1:22:49] now can i tell you what they were doing
[1:22:51] that under an old covenant
[1:22:54] got to quote right here in front of me
[1:22:56] they miriam was dancing
[1:22:58] amen brother under an old covenant
[1:23:00] brother vernon miriam had a hot spell
[1:23:02] under an old covenant amen the prophet
[1:23:04] said he still
[1:23:06] does the same thing under a new covenant
[1:23:09] he said way better than the old
[1:23:11] covenants well if they were shouting
[1:23:13] under the old covenant
[1:23:14] and they were dancing on the old
[1:23:16] covenant don't you thank the church
[1:23:18] of the living god tonight has got a
[1:23:20] right he meant to shout
[1:23:22] under a new mediator under a better
[1:23:24] ministry
[1:23:25] established upon better promises yes sir
[1:23:28] i'm talking about the god he said i
[1:23:31] forgive all thy iniquities
[1:23:32] and i heal all thy diseases hey
[1:23:36] i forgive all that iniquities i heal all
[1:23:39] thy diseases
[1:23:40] do you realize in the old testament they
[1:23:42] had one prescription
[1:23:43] under the old covenant i am the lord
[1:23:47] that healeth all thy diseases but today
[1:23:50] the prophet said today
[1:23:54] we have some 600 or better promises
[1:23:58] on divine healing alone
[1:24:01] if miriam could shout on one promise
[1:24:04] then don't you think we got a right to
[1:24:06] shout on 600.
[1:24:10] if he did it under the old covenant then
[1:24:12] how much greater is the covenant today
[1:24:15] he said if he did it under the top what
[1:24:17] will he do under the anotype
[1:24:18] he said see you know what i began to
[1:24:21] believe christian friend
[1:24:22] that we're just living in the beginning
[1:24:25] of the greatest time
[1:24:26] that the world has ever witnessed are
[1:24:29] you ready for this
[1:24:30] somebody say i'm ready preacher i'm
[1:24:32] ready i just believe that all
[1:24:34] of the lines are getting unclogged you
[1:24:37] know clogged up with all kinds of
[1:24:38] doctrines
[1:24:39] and theologies and all kinds of unbelief
[1:24:42] that's been handed down
[1:24:44] amen from generation amen to generation
[1:24:47] now
[1:24:47] amen they get bumpy here but put your
[1:24:49] seat belt on we'll get through it
[1:24:50] amen there's more than just there's more
[1:24:52] than just sin
[1:24:53] and ungodliness amen that clogs up the
[1:24:56] generations
[1:24:56] that clogs up the channels amen do you
[1:24:59] realize if you pass
[1:25:00] down amen can i take some liberty here
[1:25:02] if you pass down the idea
[1:25:04] amen to your children and your
[1:25:05] grandchildren that this message
[1:25:07] is another idea on the shelf and brother
[1:25:10] bannon was a prophet
[1:25:11] but there were certain areas you
[1:25:12] couldn't preach and there were certain
[1:25:14] things you couldn't say
[1:25:15] i tell you what you ought to be you
[1:25:16] ought to be ashamed of yourself amen
[1:25:18] because you've just passed down
[1:25:19] something that'll clog up the channels
[1:25:21] amen of their minds
[1:25:23] and of their spirits but i say tonight
[1:25:25] is there any new generation here
[1:25:27] that says the old fighters are dying off
[1:25:29] amen but we're a part
[1:25:31] of the generation that's going to take
[1:25:33] the land
[1:25:35] is there anybody going to take the land
[1:25:37] listen is there anybody they'll say
[1:25:39] amen you know people say precious
[1:25:41] spirits are passed down
[1:25:43] from generation to generation and
[1:25:45] somewhere it's got to stop
[1:25:47] amen somewhere it's going to be broken
[1:25:50] somewhere
[1:25:50] it's going to end do you realize the
[1:25:52] same day of hope amen passes down
[1:25:54] unbelief
[1:25:55] about this message from generation to
[1:25:58] generation
[1:25:58] to where if you've got an old man saying
[1:26:00] that it was brother brown's opinion
[1:26:02] about a boy wearing shorts
[1:26:03] you'll have a young man saying the same
[1:26:05] thing if you've got an old man saying
[1:26:07] it was brother brown's opinion about the
[1:26:08] word you'll have a young man saying the
[1:26:10] same thing
[1:26:11] amen but god is looking for the seed of
[1:26:13] abraham
[1:26:14] who will separate themselves from all
[1:26:16] five senses
[1:26:17] and will let the holy ghost amen awaken
[1:26:20] the supersense
[1:26:21] and say lord there's things i don't
[1:26:22] understand there's things i can't make
[1:26:25] sense of
[1:26:25] amen but i am a believer i'm a part of
[1:26:28] this new generation
[1:26:29] if the prophet said it i believe it that
[1:26:32] settles it
[1:26:34] and i get a witness here that says if
[1:26:36] the prophet said it
[1:26:37] amen i believe it and that settles it
[1:26:40] down
[1:26:41] brother jonathan if a prophet taught it
[1:26:43] we believe it
[1:26:44] that settles it
[1:26:46] [Applause]
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:48] well you slept with andrew i don't i
[1:26:50] don't agree with that well the prophet

[1:26:54] divine healing and the days of miracles

[1:27:00] because it come down from a former
[1:27:02] generation
[1:27:03] god don't heal the days and miracles has
[1:27:05] passed and we automatically believe that

[1:27:13] demon of alcoholism

[1:27:27] the prophet said
[1:27:28] he said the devil ran into moses he ran
[1:27:30] into david
[1:27:31] he ran into all of them until he ran
[1:27:32] into christ and he hit 150 volt wire
[1:27:35] and he said he got sins real good
[1:27:38] because everything that was in god
[1:27:40] he poured into christ and everything
[1:27:42] that was in christ
[1:27:43] amen he poured in the church what are

[1:32:07] and daughters of god
[1:32:09] that is received amen the spirit of
[1:32:11] truth
[1:32:12] the mighty shout thank you lord for the
[1:32:14] spirit of truth
[1:32:16] where the spirit of truth comes amen now
[1:32:18] there's one thing the devil loves to do
[1:32:20] there's one of his favorite channels
[1:32:21] that he loves to clog up
[1:32:23] it's the channel of inspiration
[1:32:26] the devil loves to clog up the channel
[1:32:30] of inspiration because he knows if a
[1:32:33] church
[1:32:34] loses the inspiration
[1:32:37] it won't be long and they'll be
[1:32:39] expiration
[1:32:43] if a church the devil didn't like that
[1:32:46] but i really don't care
[1:32:47] if the devil can get you to believe this
[1:32:49] message is not inspired
[1:32:51] it's only a matter of time before your
[1:32:53] young people are swept out in the world
[1:32:55] if the devil can get you to believe that
[1:32:57] the holy ghost
[1:32:58] amen is not still with the church then
[1:33:00] it will be a matter of time
[1:33:02] till the church will turn into more than
[1:33:04] a place of change
[1:33:05] it will turn into a place of cycle
[1:33:07] continuation are y'all hear me
[1:33:09] amen but i believe the bible says that
[1:33:11] there is a spirit in man
[1:33:13] and the inspiration of the almighty
[1:33:16] giveth them
[1:33:17] understanding now when the prophet
[1:33:19] preaches this message
[1:33:20] i have heard but now i see he actually
[1:33:22] takes time
[1:33:23] to go back and refer to the previous
[1:33:25] message called trying to do god a
[1:33:27] service
[1:33:27] without it being his will he said there
[1:33:30] was david just aspired as he could be
[1:33:32] all the people shouting glorifying god
[1:33:34] he meant that he was the wrong
[1:33:36] person he said the inspiration should
[1:33:38] have come to nathan
[1:33:39] now watch this he said but they never
[1:33:41] consulted nathan
[1:33:43] he said in job's day job was the prophet
[1:33:45] of his day
[1:33:46] he said the only thing god had done to
[1:33:47] job was give him wisdom
[1:33:49] and the word and inspiration but he
[1:33:51] could get no inspiration
[1:33:53] but he knowed all of his mechanics he
[1:33:55] had offered the burnt offering
[1:33:56] he had done everything he knew to do was
[1:33:58] right but he couldn't get a word from
[1:34:00] the lord
[1:34:00] but the devil couldn't move him
[1:34:04] the devil couldn't move him there you
[1:34:07] are see when you know
[1:34:08] you've done exactly what god told you to
[1:34:11] do see
[1:34:12] he said then wait for the channel of
[1:34:15] inspiration
[1:34:16] to open up to you and now i'm healed
[1:34:22] watch how he turns that so quick he said
[1:34:24] when you know
[1:34:26] you've done all that you could do the
[1:34:28] word is revealed to your heart
[1:34:30] he said then wait for the channel of
[1:34:32] inspiration to open up
[1:34:34] and then you'll say now i'm healed
[1:34:38] when it drops in there it's all over see
[1:34:42] he said you don't need no prayer lines
[1:34:44] or nothing else
[1:34:45] it's over brother michael it's revealed
[1:34:48] it's been revealed to you
[1:34:51] oh glory if you are sick tonight
[1:34:55] and the preacher is preaching healing
[1:34:57] and you're hearing the promises
[1:34:59] and you're hearing the promises but
[1:35:01] nothing is anchored amen you know what
[1:35:03] you need you need a prayer line
[1:35:04] you need an altar call but when the word
[1:35:07] strikes the seed
[1:35:08] inside of your soul opens up the channel
[1:35:12] and the same inspiration that is
[1:35:14] dropping on the preacher
[1:35:16] drops inside of your soul then you'll
[1:35:18] scream out
[1:35:19] now i am healed it's all over
[1:35:24] oh i believe i'm going to decree and i'm
[1:35:27] going to declare this

[1:36:10] said you don't
[1:36:12] even need a prayer line i believe in
[1:36:14] prayer lines

[1:36:17] what the prophet said here
[1:36:18] the only thing you need is an open heart
[1:36:24] oh god hey hey hey the only thing you
[1:36:28] need
[1:36:28] is an open heart now do you see why the
[1:36:31] devil wants to clog up your heart
[1:36:33] now do you see why the devil wants to
[1:36:35] clog up the heart of the church
[1:36:37] is because if the heart is clogged then
[1:36:39] nothing can pass through
[1:36:41] there's no power can pass through no
[1:36:43] inspiration can pass through but if it
[1:36:45] ever becomes unclogged
[1:36:47] you'll see john 14 12 manifested
[1:36:50] in the church of the living god
[1:36:54] oh and the inspiration drops and then
[1:36:56] nothing can change your mind
[1:36:58] you have got it now brother andrew are
[1:37:01] you sure about this message
[1:37:02] are you sure about what you're preaching
[1:37:04] i am so sure i am willing to die for it
[1:37:07] i am so sure that what i'm preaching out
[1:37:10] of tonight is inspired
[1:37:12] can i tell you what a prophet said amen
[1:37:14] he said men of old to the ages
[1:37:16] has read this bible it's inspired
[1:37:18] congregations
[1:37:20] ever since it was written
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] it's inspired congregations ever since
[1:37:30] it was written
[1:37:31] he said it's like a love letter he said
[1:37:33] but once god has spoke
[1:37:34] for the entire human race it's just as
[1:37:37] fresh tonight
[1:37:38] as it was the hour it was spoke god
[1:37:41] spoke
[1:37:41] and said that christ was the lamb slain
[1:37:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:46] and when god drew his program in his
[1:37:47] mind and spoke it amen christ
[1:37:50] was slain right there
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:53] though he wasn't actually slain for four
[1:37:55] thousand years later
[1:37:56] he said but notice this and god in there
[1:38:00] threw for
[1:38:00] knowledge seen who would be saved and
[1:38:03] who would not
[1:38:04] and there our names were written in the
[1:38:06] lamb's book of life
[1:38:08] from the foundation of the world and
[1:38:10] associated
[1:38:12] with the slain lamb oh
[1:38:15] church are you all hearing me tonight
[1:38:17] then that tells me the one that was
[1:38:19] inspired
[1:38:20] amen the word to be wrote was the same
[1:38:22] one inspiring
[1:38:23] amen the interpreter of the written word
[1:38:26] is the same one inspiring
[1:38:28] the church of the living god tonight
[1:38:32] when you catch the inspiration now the
[1:38:34] prophecy when a man is inspired
[1:38:35] amen he reads the inspired word and he
[1:38:38] set the two
[1:38:38] inspirations together somebody shout
[1:38:40] together
[1:38:42] gives the result no matter how well you
[1:38:44] study it'll never do good
[1:38:46] till you are inspired yourself the words
[1:38:49] already
[1:38:50] inspired so what we need today is an
[1:38:53] inspiration over us god sweeping down
[1:38:57] with a new inspiration breathing over us
[1:38:59] his power
[1:39:00] and his love and himself that it might
[1:39:03] inspire us
[1:39:04] to quicken us and to awaken us to his
[1:39:06] word
[1:39:07] see and then the word being brought into
[1:39:09] the spirit of inspiration
[1:39:11] then you'll see miracles things happen
[1:39:13] because the two
[1:39:15] amen just comes together now watch this
[1:39:18] when the two comes together the
[1:39:21] miraculous takes place
[1:39:23] when the two comes together the
[1:39:25] miraculous takes place
[1:39:27] all right let's go to mark 14 where
[1:39:29] there was a woman
[1:39:30] who came in and she washed the feet of
[1:39:33] jesus right
[1:39:34] she comes in to wash the feet of jesus
[1:39:36] and the prophet said notice
[1:39:38] she had a service to do for him she had
[1:39:40] heard of him
[1:39:41] now she's seen him with her eyes she had
[1:39:43] a service to do
[1:39:44] she had nothing to do it with but she
[1:39:47] rushed forward anyhow
[1:39:48] to do the service and god furnished
[1:39:51] amen the towels and the water because
[1:39:54] there was an inspiration there
[1:39:56] oh god oh her channels weren't clogged
[1:39:59] up
[1:39:59] even her mind wasn't clogged up even
[1:40:02] when she
[1:40:03] laid eyes on him brother jonathan she
[1:40:05] said that's him
[1:40:06] that's him that's the one that can
[1:40:08] forgive sin that's the one that can heal
[1:40:10] the body
[1:40:11] that's the one that raised the dead
[1:40:12] that's the one they've been there
[1:40:14] stopped by bartimaeus
[1:40:15] and opened his blinded eyes that's him
[1:40:18] what happened inspiration
[1:40:19] amen fell down on her heart and when
[1:40:21] inspiration fell on her heart
[1:40:23] it moved her into action
[1:40:26] now are y'all hear me and i preached you
[1:40:29] for a second
[1:40:29] the prophet said she had the elbow she
[1:40:32] had to elbow
[1:40:33] her way to the crowd to get to the feet
[1:40:35] of jesus
[1:40:36] do you realize when somebody would stop
[1:40:38] her and say what are you doing
[1:40:40] she would say i'm going come on
[1:40:44] i'm going to wash the feet of jesus
[1:40:48] are you awake they would look at her
[1:40:52] and say what are you going to do it with
[1:40:54] where's your towel
[1:40:55] where's your water i don't know
[1:40:58] but there's a pulsation in my heart
[1:41:04] there's a pulsation in my heart that if
[1:41:06] i just
[1:41:07] get at his feet amen he'll supply the
[1:41:10] water
[1:41:10] he'll supply the town what are you
[1:41:12] saying brother andrew
[1:41:14] i'm saying tonight if you'll just let
[1:41:16] the holy ghost open up the channels
[1:41:18] he'll supply the inspiration he'll
[1:41:20] supply the refreshing
[1:41:22] he'll supply the revival she rushed
[1:41:25] forward
[1:41:26] he meant to do him a service why because
[1:41:28] there was a pulsation in her heart
[1:41:30] there was an inspiration there was a
[1:41:32] channel there
[1:41:34] opened to receive it now i want to say
[1:41:37] it like this
[1:41:38] in the old testament one of the water
[1:41:42] tactics of the enemy
[1:41:43] was to come in and stop up the water
[1:41:46] channels
[1:41:48] if the enemy could stop off the water
[1:41:50] channels
[1:41:53] it wouldn't be long before the entire
[1:41:55] camp would die
[1:41:58] if you look in genesis 26 17 the bible
[1:42:01] says isaac departed pence
[1:42:03] pitched his tent in the valley of
[1:42:05] guerrilla and dwelt there
[1:42:06] and i'm just going to read through this
[1:42:08] quick and isaac again the wells
[1:42:09] of water
[1:42:10] which they did the days of abraham his
[1:42:12] father for the philistines had stopped
[1:42:14] them after the death of abraham
[1:42:15] and he called their names after the
[1:42:17] names by which his father had called
[1:42:19] them
[1:42:20] and isaac's servants digged in the
[1:42:22] valley and found their wealth spring and
[1:42:24] water
[1:42:25] and the herdsmen of guerrero did strive
[1:42:27] with isaac's herdsmen
[1:42:28] saying the water is ours and they called
[1:42:30] the name of the well esec
[1:42:32] because they strove with him then they
[1:42:34] dig another well
[1:42:35] and they strove for that also when he
[1:42:36] called the name of it sitna but i love
[1:42:38] verse 22
[1:42:40] and he removed from fence and digged
[1:42:42] another well
[1:42:43] and for that they strove not and he
[1:42:45] called the name of it
[1:42:46] rahul both and he said for now
[1:42:50] the lord notice what he said here
[1:42:54] before abraham's will and isaac's well
[1:42:58] and isaac digged and his servants dick
[1:43:01] but
[1:43:01] now he says the lord has made room
[1:43:05] for us amen and we shall be fruitful in
[1:43:09] the land
[1:43:10] so what he was showing you here is the
[1:43:12] time would come
[1:43:13] when there would not be a power strong
[1:43:16] enough to drive you away from the whale
[1:43:19] that god had opened up and the water in
[1:43:21] it to flow through you
[1:43:24] the promise in the public utility if you
[1:43:26] don't pay the bill
[1:43:27] they'll cut the water off you'll drive
[1:43:29] around the house and he said that's
[1:43:31] what's the matter
[1:43:32] with god's people tonight in the last
[1:43:34] few minutes the evangelist is coming out
[1:43:35] okay
[1:43:36] that's what's the matter with the people
[1:43:38] tonight they just
[1:43:40] didn't pay the price amen and the water
[1:43:42] has been cut off
[1:43:43] he said you know what he said that's
[1:43:45] reason some full gospel church members
[1:43:47] and so forth
[1:43:48] don't believe in divine healing because
[1:43:50] the water
[1:43:51] has been cut off and where there's no
[1:43:53] water
[1:43:54] it gets stickers where there's water
[1:43:57] that same plant
[1:43:58] will soften up and make leaves
[1:44:02] now let me say like the prophet said
[1:44:04] that when they found out there was
[1:44:06] without water
[1:44:07] and when you're without water you're
[1:44:09] without life
[1:44:11] when there's no water in the church
[1:44:13] there'll be no joy in the church
[1:44:15] when there's no water in the church
[1:44:16] there'll be no hand shaking in the
[1:44:18] church
[1:44:18] when there's no water in the church
[1:44:20] everything the preacher says
[1:44:22] was aimed at me and my family when
[1:44:24] there's no water oh i hit something
[1:44:26] right there
[1:44:26] when there's no water in the church amen
[1:44:29] every sermon
[1:44:30] is condemnation to you every song it's
[1:44:33] kind of when there's no
[1:44:34] water in the church there's no joy in
[1:44:36] the church and the devil knows that
[1:44:38] so he'll do everything he can ain't
[1:44:40] meant to stop up the channels
[1:44:42] that the water can flow through amen but
[1:44:44] i say devil get out of here
[1:44:46] because the holy ghost is here with a
[1:44:49] stick of dynamite
[1:44:50] ain't meant to open up the channels in
[1:44:53] the church
[1:44:55] now let me say it like this we do not
[1:44:57] enter these things
[1:44:58] amen i want to lay some word in here for
[1:45:00] a second we do not enter the spiritual
[1:45:02] things
[1:45:03] by fear amen but by faith now watch this
[1:45:06] the prophet said i'd like to have this
[1:45:07] afternoon meeting on instructing man
[1:45:10] just in the way of the spiritual things
[1:45:13] that i understand
[1:45:14] i'm not a teacher but let me tell you
[1:45:16] how to enter into this spirit
[1:45:19] he meant a more spiritual way so the
[1:45:22] prominent are saying
[1:45:23] i'm not a theologian i'm here as your
[1:45:26] brother
[1:45:27] to instruct you on how to enter into the
[1:45:30] things in a more spiritual way
[1:45:32] look here in second timothy 1 7. the
[1:45:34] bible says god
[1:45:35] has not given us the spirit of fear but
[1:45:38] of power
[1:45:39] and of love and of a sound mind then the
[1:45:41] promises of god
[1:45:43] are not the promises of man they are
[1:45:46] divine
[1:45:46] promises that are accompanied with
[1:45:49] divine power
[1:45:50] now in here in second timothy 1 we find
[1:45:53] these three divine promises of god
[1:45:55] the spirit of power the spirit of love
[1:45:58] amen and the spirit of a sound mind
[1:46:01] the spirit of power spirit of love and
[1:46:04] the spirit of a sound mind
[1:46:05] let's can i take a few minutes here the
[1:46:08] spirit of power
[1:46:09] micah 3 verse 8 shows us there is a
[1:46:11] spiritual power
[1:46:12] to rebuke sin but truly it says i am
[1:46:16] full of power by the spirit of the lord
[1:46:17] and of judgment and of might to declare
[1:46:20] unto jacob his transgression
[1:46:22] and to israel her sin in luke 4 14
[1:46:25] we see the spirit of power comes upon
[1:46:27] jesus as an example
[1:46:29] that the spirit of god is superior
[1:46:31] somebody shout superior
[1:46:33] is superior to every other spirit and
[1:46:36] jesus returned in the power of the
[1:46:39] spirit in the galilee
[1:46:41] and there went out of fame of him
[1:46:42] through all the region round about
[1:46:44] acts 4 33 and with great power gave the
[1:46:47] apostles witness
[1:46:48] of the resurrection of the lord jesus
[1:46:50] and great grace
[1:46:52] was upon them all acts six and eight and
[1:46:54] stephen
[1:46:55] who was full of faith and power did
[1:46:58] great wonders
[1:46:59] and miracles among the people see then
[1:47:01] the prophet of god will say lord
[1:47:03] amen take every young man amen and let
[1:47:05] him rise up
[1:47:06] and get anointed with the spirit the
[1:47:09] spirit of love
[1:47:10] the spirit of fellowship the spirit of
[1:47:12] power that they might help take the
[1:47:15] gospel
[1:47:15] into all the world see then the gospel
[1:47:18] travels
[1:47:19] by the spirit of power by the spirit of
[1:47:21] love and the spirit of fellowship
[1:47:24] and what three channels does the devil
[1:47:26] love to shut up in the church
[1:47:28] the spirit of power the spirit of love
[1:47:30] and the spirit of fellowship
[1:47:32] now don't get clyde on me we just saw
[1:47:34] this through cove and
[1:47:35] he shut up the spirit of fellowship amen
[1:47:38] amen not now
[1:47:42] well let me just say like this for the
[1:47:43] vernon he tried his best to shut it up
[1:47:47] [Applause]
[1:47:49] hello the spirit of fellowship
[1:47:52] to where a brother can't shake a
[1:47:54] brother's hand and a sister can't hug
[1:47:56] his sister's neck
[1:47:57] amen and the believers can't come
[1:47:59] together they may notice this
[1:48:00] but the spirit of power amen is here
[1:48:03] tonight
[1:48:04] to open up the channel of fellowship
[1:48:07] come on church we need the fellowship
[1:48:10] of believers of like precious faith
[1:48:14] oh i'm a preacher for a second you know
[1:48:16] what amazes me
[1:48:18] is we got people that won't come to
[1:48:19] church because they say they can't get
[1:48:21] along with somebody in the church
[1:48:22] but they go to the party at christmas
[1:48:25] time with their boss
[1:48:26] and they go to the uh they go to the
[1:48:28] company's party
[1:48:30] and you mean to tell me you get along
[1:48:31] with all of them well then i just put up
[1:48:33] with her
[1:48:34] i just put up with their ways amen now
[1:48:36] if you can be forbearing with a bunch of
[1:48:38] sinners
[1:48:38] and a bunch of drugs and alcoholics then
[1:48:41] don't you think it's time
[1:48:42] amen to get a love in your heart for the
[1:48:45] fellowship of the believers of like
[1:48:47] precious faith
[1:48:49] my bible says that light has no
[1:48:51] fellowship with darkness
[1:48:53] amen and sin has no fellowship with
[1:48:55] righteousness
[1:48:56] and faith has no fellowship with
[1:48:58] unbelief
[1:48:59] come on church we need the spirit of
[1:49:02] power amen to open up the channel
[1:49:04] amen of fellowship in the church again
[1:49:09] the prophet said our heavenly father i'm
[1:49:10] gonna read this may they every
[1:49:11] superstition leave the people
[1:49:13] that devil that tries to keep them in
[1:49:15] darkness he said truly they are designed
