Stephanie and and the family there brother brother tero wife and we just appreciate them so much and amen I want a brother Brian made mention to you about the fellowship Lord willing next weekend at the Depot following the service here so let's just remember that and we want to go right on into the word this morning let's go to Psalms 127 I know that's a big shock isn't it Psalms 127 verse 1 my wonder word of the Lord just wonderful Thursday night Psalms 127 verse 1 a song of degrees for Solomon Wow what a what a statement to start out with this is that Solomon might know even though Solomon has been designated by God to build the house of the Lord David wants him to remember your designation is yielding your designation is not your strength except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that building except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep low children are in heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate a man let's just bow our heads and award a prayer here this morning you ever need upon your heart you'd want to make known to the Lord and say Lord just remember me god bless you bless you this morning let's just go to the throne of God together Lord Jesus it's just a privilege and an honor Lord that we can be able to come together as brothers and sisters of like precious faith Lord with one desire with one motive with one objective Lord your God that's to hear from you Lord each and every one of us the Lord there are needs upon our hearts Lord as we know very very well Lord all throughout the congregation here we're either in a trial coming out of a trial or heading into a trial we're in one of those places this morning and how thankful we are that God once again how that you remind us that father you are over all things Lord and so Lord beyond behind the hands that Lord are lifted up and for every heart Lord we Sun a song here just moments ago and the desire was is that you would listen to our hearts for Lord truly we have this Lord in your word where you have made real to us and we have witnessed it as believers where the Spirit of God has made intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered Lord father testimony after testimony of that we are just Lord God desiring once again this morning Lord as you have heard our hearts crime that dear God that you would come by our way and you would speak to our our lives Lord in such a personal way Lord though it may not be that you would call maybe out the exact need you can do that Lord it's based on what you see Lord and what your will is but Lord as we look at it sometimes Lord it's just Lord where you will minister to us that will help us to be able to yield more and get out of the way that you might fulfill what we are what we are desiring and laying before you as a need Lord we realize more and more as we walk in this life and fathers were walking in you that the greatest need that we have and the challenge that always lays before us is us getting out of the way would you help us this morning and may father even from this service Lord God from in our lives Lord God the yielding father and the growth that would take place father Lord we just pray that you'll just come among as the Lord God by your Holy Spirit Lord and break the word of life to our hearts Lord we pray Lord ministering to every need that's here in the name of Jesus Christ amen I mean God blesses your being seated got to get my prop back out here we've been looking at this in the scripture on children as arrows and as we we took that the last time that we were together quite a few of the times here and looking at some of the parts within the scripture and we examining that of an arrow itself and you know there's things that God will use as we've said we see this in the word where God will use different symbols God will take things and the symbols themselves are used not because God has to use them but God will do that so that you and I can be brought into an understanding and so you know you think of even how that Paul himself would deal even in the book of Ephesians you you see it in the book of Corinthians you see it also in the book of Hebrews Paul will at times compare it to that of a race you'll also compare the walk of our life to an Olympian who is training like a boxer who would have to bring his body into subjection then you'll find where Paul will deal with in in Ephesians 6 and he'll actually put two things before us that where we are wrestling not against flesh and blood so there's a wrestling match that's going on and then Paul will go on in that same scriptures that are verses that are put there that we are clothed with the full armor of God and so as a soldier so it's a it's a war that we are engaged in so there's many different analogies and symbols that are used in the scripture to help our understanding and sometimes we can read over things and we not that we meaningly read over just to pass over it but I believe that God has a time that he will quicken things to our heart you know there's things that every one of us have read there's things that I've heard that brother Bam has said there's things I've read in the scriptures and certain things I just couldn't you know my understanding I knew there was something more it wasn't that I didn't believe it it's just I knew there's something deeper that's being said here now it isn't it for me to pry it because remember it wasn't the prophet who pried out these things it was God Himself who took the cap off the mountain so if God did it in order for this message to come to us than it has to be the same God to open these things to our heart and God will always do it in the right time in the right season and I believe that the word is always always in season for what we have need of it the word is not something that's set forth like for example what we heard on Thursday night of trials and and things like that there you know we how many times that we've heard and ministered with on trials but you see it's not about us coming to a place to where we have a memory of things and oh this is what's going on old this is what's happening but it's it's much deeper than that God gives a word for a season in that time showing you and I that the eyes of the Lord are indeed showing themselves strong in our behalf it's God coming to minister to our needs and I'm so grateful for that that it's a word that God speaks in season to our lives and as we look at this with arrows and and going through this week we've seen that there are indeed four parts to an arrow and you know I'm not here to try to educate you on on the home the times of the arrow but you know you have that you have the very shaft itself of the arrow and the material that it's made out of and we've we've looked at that and then you have also the you know you've got the fletchings of the of the arrow that have to be placed on the arrow in' and those fletchings are more than just things of color as a matter of fact now these colors right here I used to think those things were pretty nice you know I thought my that's a nice color but until I shot one of these and it I had to find it in the woods and that color doesn't do too well finding it in the woods because most of the leaves on the ground kind of look this color so I thought it was a great color but really the best thing it could I think now is probably white because white wood with that blood on it'll stick out like a sore thumb but at any rate that's not that's free there wasn't unspiritual about that well maybe there is if our lives are so quiet that the blood of Jesus Christ could shine forth so we have been another we have the other part here of that of you know the knock itself and then we have that where the knock you've got to have a knock there if you don't that string can slip all around and that arrow can come off of there in such a way and and then you have the tip itself which is the the thing that we want to look at a little bit closer here and and take the next part of it here I want to look at this this part right here these these fletchings and I want to look at these fletchings and these are things that actually when you look at it if an arrow did not have a fletching on it if it was just the straight shaft itself though it might have a knock upon it and though it might have an arrow the fletching itself is for a purpose of this arrow that that the back end will not get ahead of the front end it actually the the actual fletchings itself actually creates a drag so that the arrow will stay in humility I mean it will stay in the right order so that it doesn't get the back in front of the front so it's just a right way and this and yet this right here when we look at this character that is molded and and that can be shaped because these things it's very meticulous of how that you would apply this fletching and a lot of times guys will take it and they'll take the fletching and they'll kind of give it a little bit of a of a spin to it so that even when the arrow is coming off this flight and the spin and has it's going it they want to try to keep it as straight as possible in flight and that's the same thing that the character and the molding of character within the lives not only of our children but the same way that God does and works in our life and I'll tell you what you might think and I think maybe as a parent boy we got our work cut out for us but how about him but you know what he didn't pull back he didn't shirk the duty he knew everything that would be about us but his confidence is is his life dwelling in us and then that submission and that humility he will accomplish what he has ordained to be accomplished he sure will and he is doing that so when we look at this of the fletching because you know many times character we know character to be you know how and who you really are no matter if you're by yourself or other people are around your character is who you are when you think of it in the term of the of the Hebrew when they we look at the word name the word name itself actually means character and so when you think of that in terms of God calling the names of his children down through the ages it's God calling the characteristic of himself in that hour by manifesting his word that calls the people of the hour because we are identified in the name of Jesus Christ and when that name is manifest we are a part of that name and then we begin to recognize that we in ourselves are not of this world but we indeed are Pilgrims and strangers this world is not my home and we begin to recognize that there is a greater calling and a greater family of which that you and I are a part of and that is a family that is of a tree that knows no end it's the tree of life and we we can see that within that of character character itself it is something that the molding of how that we will respond and act and and in situations and I just reminded of the of the thought you know brother branham under the inspiration of God would speak to us so many times upon character and how that within character itself that it's not a gift nobody can give you in our character you realize that even the preaching of the word ELISA I'm saying the preaching of the word itself does not give you an eye character but the ministering of the word calls us in submission that he might mold our character and the real molding of our character when we say Lord I want to see more of the virtue this virtue of my life that bit the only way that any of the virtues come forth that is already within us is under trials and under tests they don't come forth in any other way how can brotherly kindness come forth unless there is a test that will bring that forth because you see it's got to be brotherly kindness not just not just something of where somebody is earthly in their makeup but it must be something for the depth of God's divine nature same way with temperance patience and all those other things so it's character itself is the very AMOLED and shaping it's not a gift but it is a victory and you know we can go throughout this a building you know this morning there are many things that I can even attest them only that the greatest victory itself is not so much when I would see certain things then take place or maybe my response within something or how that I can approach something and look at something now and think my goodness out I never approached it like that a year two years ago five years ago ten years ago but you can what were the great victory is is when you begin to recognize and the victory is starts from within you that's the great victory that means that no matter what comes along the victory you've already come to a place in your life to be able to lay down your will it don't mean that it ain't gonna be hard and we're not going to be tested but remember we're still in this sticker sticky taco burl shell but thanks be to God we've got the life of sweet life on the inside and there's a development that's going on and that development is by us surrendering to his working so as we look at this the thing that I'm just drawn to by the by the Holy Spirit when I was looking at this of character because we can begin to look at character and we could say well you know we do this and we can think no doubt of many scriptures we've used when we look at even the raising of children and how that the Holy Spirit would a brings forth and the tutoring and the raising of our life but I want you to notice here that every one of these fletchings right here it would do no good unless there was something to be able to bond these fletchings on this shaft the only way that character itself can actually be molded as their first has to be unity without unity there can be no character molding unity itself is actually what gives the word life and substance and meaning I want you to think of this for a moment think of Peters life brother Branham will dramatize this for us when he speaks of how that Peter you know he could hear his dear old daddy you know in brother Brent said he could see the tears remember all this of how his dad would tell him about remember what God had spoke through Moses regarding that the Lord our God shall raise up a prophet like unto Moses and from among the Brethren and you know the the rest of that of that story or the rest of that scripture and to think of it that that was more than just a word that was a promise wasn't it there was a promise of a redeemer all the way back from the Garden of Eden and it was there was that which you would have to recognize that there's things that brother Branham is saying in the in in that particular story that he may not say by words but it's being said and that is that there had to be something that no matter what it was within Peters life Peter we know you know he needed a touch from God in his life but no matter what it was he could not get away from what his dad had said now you can look and say well Peter was elected to that I will agree with that I will definitely say amen to that a hundred percent but I what I what I'm looking at here what is so pressed upon my heart there had to be something that was such an impression beyond the words that were called talking about the coming Messiah that actually there was a life behind the quoting and rehearsing of the prophecy that actually would cause Peter to actually look for it and it looked there were many men that rose up to being the Messiah but yet there was something about it how God had it so arranged and reserved within that hour and there was such an impression of that word and I believe it wasn't that Jonas was a forceful man that he was a dictator that it was something I boys I'm gonna tell you that I don't believe that at all I believe that the Holy Spirit that was there who gave the promise of the Messiah the same one who came down in the Garden of Eden I believe that that same Holy Spirit there who will bring that promise to pass God releases divine grace that moves upon the elect as it has down through the time to those who are gathered to that promise making ready for that promise to be fulfilled and then Jonas himself under that divine grace so it was not just words that he was Solon but it was actually word that was anointed by the grace of God that was something more than just word to wear that Peter could reverence the word and I believe with all my heart this is why that unity is so important when we look at that of the molding of character unity is one of the is one of the greatest things and I don't want to just say one of but it is the achievement and the desire of Almighty God so when we look at this here in Psalms 133 verse 1 the Bible says like this from the near passage of Scripture a song of degrees of David behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity now this is what God thinks concerning unity notice among brethren those who are of the same parents God wants unity within the family dog wants unity within his family and the one one the heir God is even laying down in this scripture as he has all along that the real prescription for unity among one another is to first be united with him so then when we look at this it is good and how behold look at take observation how good and how pleasant it is how good it is and we look at this word how pleasant how agreeable and you know how delightful how sweet how lovely how agreeable it is for brethren to dwell together in unity think about this you know the arm the the good how many times we look in the scripture in the very beginning where God the Bible would say from each of those days how that God would speak and then he would step back and he would see what he spoke come to fruition in that time and God would step back and say behold it is good it is very good what was God looking at you see God had in his mind a full vision of what God intended to do but God is not in a hurry he's not dragging his feet but God is working so that every detail of what he has spoken for that day that it will come forth and when it comes forth the very manifestation of that is the characteristic of that word that has been spoken and when it comes forward then God can look and say behold it is good so this one we're looking at it it's the same way how can there be unity outside of the word there can't be in a unity any correct unity outside of the word it must be solemnly based on the word so then when we're looking at this here within the scripture such a harmony and a unity then you're looking verse two hears we go on down it says now look what this unity is like it is like here is a comparison it is like the precious ointment up on the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments so god this is God showing this of a perfect man he's showing what what unity does the effect of unity this unity of his spirit his presence in notice upon the head upon the head and as it moves from the head it's to flow down as he even would describe Aaron's face even Aaron's beard and he goes clear to the very end of the garments aren't you glad that that same Holy Spirit that came and anointed our Lord Jesus as now as it came back into the church after his offering up aren't you glad that you and I are part in this hour of the finishing up it's no different it's not a different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost and how has he returned by the promise of his word so has his word what is his word it is that which makes up his body so here the flow of the spirit and unity it takes there of a harmony that flows from the head down it shows them to you and I that unity itself was restored and is restored first through Christ the head is that right Paul Paul puts this forth here and Paul's reminding there in the book of Corinthians that every man would know that God being the head of Christ and Christ the head of every man NU'EST me and then he goes on down and brings it home down in the man the head of the woman he brings down the correct unity and the correct order that is set forth now when I look at this here in verse 3 as it goes on I love this it is as the dew of Hermon it's like God they just can't get a way of talking about unity he said let me give you another example it's as the dew of Hermon determine being Zion and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore so there's a designated place of the blessing of God God designates where his blessing is poured out it is poured out upon Herman and Herman being that of sanctuary his house his dwelling that which he himself has chosen to inhabit and to think how God would describe it it wasn't something that's noisy you know like last night I'll tell you what that rain that was coming down it was some hard rain that lightning that was coming down it was lightning all that but some of your looks I can tell some of you already asleep and I wasn't that late either but I'll tell you what that rain was really coming down it was making a noise coming down but you see do itself doesn't make a noise do itself is not something that is to be belittled as a matter of fact it one of the blessings that God promised to Jacob who was inheritor of the blood birthright and part of the blessing is that Perdue of heaven would be yours now sometimes we could look at the dew of heaven and say what the dew of heaven what will the dew of heaven do the dew of heaven it comes down in such a stillness and such a sweetness you can walk out of a morning among your flowers walk up on your grass you can look at that there is avery freshman that comes in the morning by the do yet you don't hear it you don't see it you don't say hey honey you hear that dew falling outside you don't hear that at all and neither do you hear the do when it's ascending back up from where it comes from you do not hear that but the dew itself is accomplishing the work of which it is to do on our behalf they might say Lord I want rain I like services where the rain is pouring down to but there's also times that we need do and sometimes do can settle down just real soft you're loving that do settling down there in that sanctuary in that in that home you know I'll think about it it's a place I believe that that believes our desire as believers we want we not only warn but I believe our homes is a place that were the Spirit of God not just our homes but us where he can show up at any time because we never know what he's going to do because listen friends the whole thing of him showing up it might be him showing up to rapture our body you know it do the say the thing about it is if we are become more aware but the whole thing of this of the other spirit and that of the world that tries to work is to try to bring us out of that realm of expectation but I'm so glad that God is here he's not defeated and God knows how to bring his people under expectation now I want you to watch that this anointing now that the profit I always loved this quote why are people so tossed about think about the the statement why are people so tossed about bill dime says some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is he said did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever given to anyone and what they did or what they what did they do when they had the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever give to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without mission one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read the Spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the blind look what the anointing did for him the anointing upon his life it put him in such a place for what living for the Liberty that would come to others so it's not about me being free and me but no it's the Latin that anointing moving on his life he could look at what it what the Liberty that would bring to others recovering of sight to the blind but you know the Jubilee sounding all of those things not to think of that how could he stand there and say that in that way because he knew who he was he wasn't living for himself he was living for you and me and now notice and now we would think if such an anointing was on him that been prophesied eight hundred years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler now the Church of Christ and the Baptist people hey man and in that we don't believe in screaming and hollering running off but he's trying to show us that an anointing it's not just something that comes and goes comes and goes comes and goes that's what he's trying to show us he's not belittling you know this as much as I do I found it very interesting I said after a meeting there in Virginia and I spoke there would brother Kenny captain we were talking there as ministers together and it was just incredible some of the testimonies that brother Kenny Capps was given of how that the prophet of God Himself how he got and entered so much into the Spirit of God he wasn't no dry stick-in-the-mud now listen friends we're not taken away you worship God according to the dictates of your heart but remember make sure the dictates of your heart are not dictating the way that everybody else can worship is that right just as much as maybe some that's not maybe as vocal and there might be others that are vocal and others in her vocal say why aren't these people vocal on their little said they were learner not vocal why are they vocal you see let that that's just that's just childish that's just foolishness don't let that stuff separate us and let's get united and let's worship God that's what it's all about you know sometimes you can be preaching to people they may not say a man but I'll tell you what I can still fill the pool that they're pulling on the Lord gen alright he said there was that anointing we would want to run all over the building scream and holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he done under the anointing whoo this is the dew of Hermon this is the do this is what words notice what words were used were ministering grace to the hearer it was it was a word that was seeking to edify a word that was seeking to loosen his confidence was this was not the words of Isaiah this was the words of his father Isaiah was a servant an instrument a prophet of God that was used and the Spirit of God quickened that portion of the word to him and he stood there at that time as the do oh my upon his life and there was a word that went forth what an atmosphere you know the Bible said never a man spake like this man and the Bible says that the common people heard him gladly Wow that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control but some of you mean that after I get out of here Monday morning that you have the anointing is supreme power under control you see brother BAM tells us what in the message humble thyself what real humility is he says is being able to conquer yourself he said when you're able to conquer yourself you've got more power than the man that would run all around the building because you have been able to conquer yourself and let's just be honest that's the greatest person that's the person we've got to conquer over and over and over and over but thanks be to God we've got the mighty conquer on the inside greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world that's anointing because remember anointing is like how prophet would describe it there I think it's in the message who do you say this is in 64 brother Brent says you know he says you take a young man that can look at a woman and he said she make a very fine wife oh what a wonderful wife she is oh my she would do all this and brother I've said it dudes no you know no good unless you make her your wife now we understand everything that has to be done but notice Bill Graham said that's the same way it is with the message he said you can sympathize with it now what does it mean to sympathize with something that's right now it's the truth it's right it's absolutely truth yeah that's right I agree with it yeah but that don't do no good but he says when you become one with it you take it you receive it and he receives you he said then the anointing is with you as it is with others but now remember the anointing is not emotions you might be making your biscuits of a morning right there under the anointing because what you're under the anointing of this word Christ you're under the headship of this word whether you feel like it or when Christ has moved into the depths of your heart and you're examining your life you know we examine a heart we examine our life to make sure that we are in fellowship with him because to a believer the worst thing that can happen is to be out of fellowship with him because to get out of fellowship with him you get out of fellowship with one another it just it just keeps going but we'll stay on this this morning so when we look at this unity of where it's at it is that anointing of that that you and I are under it is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how and that's what's here well I think what you could really preach on this court a long time that no and what and how does that mean that everything is laid out this is what's gonna happen and that's well let me ask you is that what happened when when God had the plane grounded in Memphis did the Prophet and all the house and wats to it I'm gonna go down this way there'll be a mailbox here I'll turn that way no matter of fact he didn't know why it was he didn't know what was going on he didn't even know why the Spirit of God had said follow me this way he didn't know but all he knew was to obey that whole example was destroying - you and I in this hour that the simplicity of God to obey his voice and God will you will move through our lives that is supreme power in control Oh glory be to God - unity itself unity it brings stability in a life you with me it brings stability when we're united in the right way sometimes when there's wrong unions even though a person can come out of that Union and realize oh that was a bad Union but sometimes there has to be a healing that takes place in order for them to trust for a true union so you see there God knows what he's doing God knows how to mold and to shape our lives because remember the whole attribute a whole characteristic of unity is stability and without unity think about this without unity nothing can be accomplished I won't ask you on how many of you have surgeries I know I've been to some of you most of you that's had surgeries and things but I know one thing you know when we come in the room you certainly wouldn't want doctors and nurses and everybody else saying hey I'll tell you what you took my parking spot no no I didn't I was Employee of the Month hey I'm handing him the forceps today no you're not I got here first and I got him on the tray now how many of you would feel like this is gonna be a wonderful surgery this is going to be wonderful you wouldn't just be asking me to pray your husband or your wife or whatever more you'd be saying you think we can reschedule this you think we could you think we can why because you recognize you're the one going under the knife and you recognize you're the one going under the knife and what is it about it you recognize there's got to be unity there I don't want them fighting over this kind of stuff right here because unity itself they might have differences so in some amount of took so and so's parking spot so and so might accenting so-and-so's pew so and so mine I did this or whatever more but when all of that is laid aside and said hey we got a patient right here with cancer and we're going in there to get that cancer today and all of them said what did you see on the report whereas this where's the blood levels anesthesiologist where's this set and they outside might have all sorts of disagreements but there's one thing about it they are there in that room not because they necessarily agree with one another but they agree with what they have been anointed for and that causes them to lay aside other things that are not so significant in an amazing you find things sometimes in families where things will be driven apart in such a way and then all of a sudden how there'll be something that God will permit and allow to come into that family and a sickness will come together people who wouldn't even talk to one another people who wouldn't even look at one another won't text one another won't call one another email whatever and on and on and on and on you let something happen you know what they're right there and beside the hospital bed all differences are forgotten what a shame it is it takes something like that to happen what a shame it is for that to happen oh my you're loving you might be sitting here this morning you might say I thought were preaching on family I am we are but it's bringing this down God showing you and I how he deals with you and I because remember as we've said over and over God will not ask you to do something that he himself is not only willing but has already done the very same things that he asks of you and I remember what he desires for you and I he already came down and he took his own walls upon himself now to think of this here in the scriptures and brother BAM we'll go through this in the message oneness and when you look at this in the message one this brother Ram sets this forth of how that God's program is that we would be one with him and once you just listen our brother brand brings this Luther have said now the first man and first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God very important with God it's not one another than with God it's with God and with one another now watch this this is how what's this meter it's like a test meter they were in harmony with God so much so much how do you know they weren't such harmony God could come down at any time he desired and talked lip to ear with Adam and Eve that's the harmony that's the harmony that God desires for our life now listen friends weak we can let down you know our our spiritual bonnets as it were and many times there's the things and the cares of life that'll try to take away that openness that we could have with God and God can come by away and say hey this is this has taken up time of where you're thinking on me because remember y'all want to make I want you your way to be good and prosperous of a good success I want you to think upon me I want to draw near to you Psalms one he that's planted as a tree by the living water in his law does he meditate day and night you're aware of it as believers God don't speak to us just when we're at the house of God he speaks to us here but you see the whole part of it is not just so that it's here there's things that God will speak to our lives here and mana Sheena's his children but this is not your walk with the Lord this is only something that how you come and you see the value of coming together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith and receiving from the Word of God that as you even go out of here when you're in your own homes in your own places you're living a victorious life and the real victory is as we've said us getting out of the way and it takes the word the sharp sword for us to be able to receive the dividing of us from us my so much he could come down at any time he desired I tell you one thing that I've told the Lord and this is where I want to stay I'm just telling you this I've told him but if there's many times where he's woke me up in early hours there have been times where he went where I'm and maybe in the middle of doing something and have to say hey I need to stop over here I need to just put down certain things and write down certain points or do certain things I said this to him anytime you want to wake me up wake me up anytime you want to talk to me talk to me if I'm sleeping or whatever more I found some of those times just to be the most dearest of times early of the morning the center were you tired you know later on the day yeah and sometimes I did get a little tired maybe when it came near dinner but there was such a refreshment of hearing from him a little something maybe he dropped along with money but don't you meant so much to me it's just something that just encouraged me throughout the day it's something that would you know put a smile and here's something that I could just go forward with and say thank you lord getting an amazing how when was it John Wesley's mother that Susanna is that Suzanne and Wesley remember how it was so portrayed that with with her and her husband with her husband I think was it Charles that forgive me I can't remember right now was it Charles okay it was portrayed in such a way that of all the children that they had when you ask those children they each and every one thought they were momma's pick and when they all come together and all to sit around your no no I was momma's pick your mom her mom's what it was she had away she had time with each of them and we're talking about time we're talking about to where it was something to where they were made to feel special that's just something on a finite schedule how much greater with our Heavenly Father how that he's able to so minister to you and I that you and I could walk out of this service stand right in that parking on say hey did you hear this my one this Samantha yeah that was really good and there's something else that you've tucked away in your heart and then hit something God has come right by each and every one and lets you know you're special to me you're special notice what I've said now that is perfect oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to hear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were worn with God God and his family was one any man and his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere now I'm not gonna elaborate on this part today but if you'll notice the discernment of the world narrows down not upon that of the family but it narrows down on what is the root what's the problem what's because what is it that's driving the family apart let's deal with that many times that's the thing that needs to be dealt with all of these other eruptions on the surface and you need to do this and stop doing that those are surface eruptions of problems that lie much deeper that's the truth it we don't want to work on suffering surface eruptions it's like trying to put caps on things it's like trying to blow out fires you know when they have those wildfires they don't go around trying to put out every little fire they want to go to where that source is at and they first of all want to keep it so it ain't spreading no more they first of all stop the spreading of it then they begin to go through and they knock out each one of them they'll put that border up where they'll actually lay that water down so it ain't gonna go no further you know that's the first thing to where you start at there might be something don't let the devil beat you up and over the head the thing you need to start on and say look there's things are separate I may not understand it may not know it I'm not going to look at it and say it's their fault this fault that fault but first of all let's unite together and let's get some water laid down here so it don't spread no further that's where it all starts what is that that in itself is uniting together so it don't affect no one else before you ever get it contained that's the first place to start boy mama hallelujah they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent and parent with children my goodness it's so hard for me not to preach this quote right here this morning but if I do I end up reaching things there's it's because all of this unity this is what should be this unity it's not just children being one with the parent but the parent is to be one with the child it's not just mother being one with father but father's to be one with mother this is Ephesians 5 submitting you selves to one another in the fear of God hyung just believe this I know this to be a fact this was demonstrated right here right through our prophets life it wasn't just something was demonstrated through the Lord Jesus right here there are things that we could go right through but I can't go that way this morning of how that these things in order to bring agreement and to bring unity notice they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture so the picture notice what people see is the unity that lays beneath the surface or the disunity that's God's purpose you believe that that's God's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with this family earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them let me just stop right here is the Spirit of God presses on my heart do not allow yourself to set there in that manner and say oh there's this there's this disunity there's this disunity but rather allow your heart to be united with the word and say I believe that is God's purpose and I believe that's God's desire for my life for my marriage from my home for my children stand upon that word don't you give the devil one ounce or one part of a ground to stand on you stand upon your god-given rights these are your god-given rights the Holy Spirit is not putting and pointing and putting us down but he's showing what belongs to you and I man and it is by the power of Almighty God that God desires and will and is manifesting his word oma the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them than each other with God they all they become all one so God's nature dwelling on the inside bounnam says isn't that a beautiful picture once again picture picture this isn't God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself John 1 I believe it's John 1 15 or 17 one of them right after says the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us it says and we beheld the only begotten of the Father full of glory full of truth and full of grace and then it goes on to say that he that through that of the only beloved that him he hath declared the father that word declared means for narrow manifests who make known openly reveal it's a picture in that wonderful what God does in secret Matthew 6 what the wanton be man who enters in and praise the father who sees and heareth and secret come on friends that little room is not a place here in this country that little room is that in Christ where the word itself and the anointing the presence of God is upon that word oh my that same living God right here among us to unite us with him amen glory be to God think of this a beautiful picture something that is so reserved within our hearts but he said I will openly make it known oh brother brems says isn't that a beautiful picture God in his family father over all supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to be heartache I think that's what they were singing about that pay day you're awake right where they sing that special this morning when they sung about the payday send me a little time said waiting man I just got paid this Wednesday am I getting paid again this I'm talking about a real payday I'm on a real one no revita God never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God and him again he says it what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one now let's move ahead to John 17 verse 17 and we look here we find the Lord Jesus here in intercessory prayer because truly there's never been any other greater unity then when God Himself came down and become one of us where that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the greatest uniting heaven and earth embraced greatest uniting that took place oh my now watch watch what takes place of how that here the Lord Jesus he's in prayer and this prayer itself it comes to a place of intercession he recognizes that his time the purpose and verse 1 of where of his purpose upon the earth it's time now that it must be glorified so he recognizes his purpose now watch this here is the purpose that's coming and in the midst of it he's asking he's interceding on our behalf there's one request that he's going to make and that's I want their fellowship I want their fellowship you know what that was that was the same heart of God before there was Adam Stardust or molecule that wanted fellowship God just didn't want to talk to people but remember he had a closeness with these people these disciples were right around him but yet that was not true unity that was not restoring what had fallen in Eden that wasn't yet yet it had to be one where he would lay his life down in order that his life might come back upon us that we might be unified with him and the father so one great principle though it's not wrote here but it is wrote here that unity itself is not something that comes without a sacrifice unity comes by sacrifice and the only way it can be a sacrifice before he was ever put on Calvary's tree the sacrifice the lamb was already crucified right here his will was crucified to the will before he ever said anything out of his mouth it was already right here he was unified he was not notice his desire to be one it wasn't that he didn't love his brother and the Prophet tells us this he loved his brother he loved the fellowship with them he said he didn't want to go he loved the sunsets like you and I love the sunset but he real in order for his brethren to be one with him that he must pay the price that his life might come back in you and I that would be real oneness and through that oneness right there we have the expectation that's soon and very soon we will be united with our Lord Jesus Christ by the moving of this king inside of us a king inside of us that manifests that how everything else that was tried everything else that was done yet nothing could overcome that first birth but the king himself let it be known that I have overcome and you have overcome and that manifestation of the king manifesting his victory through our life when he becomes incarnate to us we will crown him the king of kings and the Lord of lords Nebuchadnezzar was a king of kings but he was not V what's this prayer for unity verse 17 sanctify him through that truth thy Word is truth in a powerful unity itself it begins with word in the very beginning God looked upon the darkness the bleak condition God said let there be light and when he spoke the Spirit of God Ruach went out and brother Brad remember how brother Branham dramatizes it when that word went forth he said that dove of the Holy Spirit its wings came around this earth and it begin to brood and COO over it who you see what that word did it was cooing to bring forth what he had called for the light was needed to bring into manifestation what he already had sown autumn mercy you can preach predestination all the way through these scriptures here amen God didn't plant the seed in you and on this generation it was like that was needed to bring the seed that he had already found in you and I and the light coming upon the seed it brings forth and because what was already there he could say I already knew you you thought this and you thought that what's he done he is by perfect love dismantling all fear or if I can only make it only make it he has already made it and you are in him by predestination the life has come to you and that cast you into the body how can you miss it you've seen your day and it's message you recognize the program of God and your part within it nobody can take that away from you you don't matter how many websites come up you don't matter how many things come away head-on another one thing to do with it I have found him and the reality is he has found me and if it hadn't been for that gene on the inside I wouldn't have been found forgive me for comparing us to a dog but Caleb Caleb means dog and you know they microchip them dogs you know they ask you you want to microchip your dog that way if your dog ever gets taken they can you know do this little scanner and they have no collar on it it might look like you don't belong to nobody honey let's take this in and make it a good member you don't belong nowhere and all of a sudden there comes a scanner across it this belongs to so-and-so you mean the same I don't know it belongs over here there was already a chip a seed by virtue of predestination that was already sown in your life it had his name inscripted in the water to be manifested this generation and when the light of God came across you recognize I'm not just here I'm not just a member I was not just a duck I'm not a chicken I am an eagle you recognize there is a greater claim upon your life light manifest what he's already placed there let's just try to finish these few scriptures can we do that I love just call let's go get a brand bite to eat and come back here then I'd have to have every one of the brothers back here praying for me in the office of Lord help me come on your breach but oh ma let's let's just move here just a little bit as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world he knows as the father has sent me so I am gonna send you the father that sent him went in him in the wonderful train up a child in the way that he should go and when he grows old he will not depart from it Peter did not depart from it what was and it was the life that was there behind what Jonas was saying concerning Deuteronomy 18:15 it was the life it was not the voice of Jonas it was God's voice divine grace that was rolling off of that promise and Rome and Jonas heart that he moved and made an imprint upon Peters heart let me tell you something God's Word can't fail it will not return back to him void and for their sakes look at this verse 19 and for their sakes I sanctify myself he didn't st. if I self because of himself he sanctify himself for their sakes we could stop right here and just say lord help us in our homes right here in the church let us live lives sanctified for others that God might move for others it's not about oh boy they need this or no no it's I want to be available don't you want to be available as for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth watch this moving the precious ointment moving down through upon the face the beard coming down the body that they might be sanctified let me tell you something sanctification if I could say it right it's contagious contagious yeah you live a sanctified life it'll affect everything around your home now you might say brother Simon I don't have TV we don't have TV we don't have cable we don't have this and that's all fine and good but even in the sanctification of your attitude it's effectual it catches it catches because God is able to work through that and that's our whole objective is that God might be able to work and why do we do it know we could say it I could say this or I could put this point in or I could say but for others you love him verse 20 don't think I'm not gonna read the rest of the chapter verse 20 neither pray I for these alone us for no more no no but for them also which shall believe on me through their word you know this confidence was is that I word your word my word is not going to be my word in your word it'll be his word but remember once his word is given for you and me it's our word when God said in the beginning I will give her see and the Prophet picks it up in the message oneness he said the woman has no seed but once God gives it to her it then is her see hallelujah this is my message this is your message they men the Holy Ghost is mine the only ghost is yours the rapture is mine the rapture is yours he's given it to me and we are one with him what the Spirit has said the prophecy and the bride says the same thing the Spirit believe on me through their word oh Jesus you're so wonderful in in wonderful God gives signs and wonders to accompany his word because there might be and we might we need to know how God will show up sometimes you read it all through the book of Acts if God were to help some of those people said I'm telling you what Paul's preach to you if you don't believe what Paul said tough but look of God's mercy God would come around and heal someone so that the governor would open up to Paul and hear what he had to say and we taste something God visiting this generation for you and I it's more it was more than signs and wonders it brought to a reality to us as the bride of Jesus Christ that he is here not in corporal form but he is here in the person of Christ his word it identifies us aware that we are what does he do by the things that you and I cannot see when it says you were at a clinic and you read a clinic and this and that and so forth and all these things and isn't that the truth thus saith the Lord you're healed you see you and I were at the clinic you and I couldn't see that you and I weren't fair I'm let me see who can I ask were you there let me see we'll get an investigation was this was this true was this all here you and I don't do that but look what it is you and I can see it did we not see it God even allowed one to be recorded on deep call to thee you and I can see those things what was that for that our faith in what you and I cannot see becoming material that our faith would be in this word that God has promised that that same word is becoming material in you and me because as the prophet said he said this is greater than the vision perfect faith perfect faith this is greater than the vision because he said that vision says something that's contrary to this we take this but you see what he's showing in perfect faith he's showing us the whole purpose of the ministry was to place our faith return it back return it back to the Apostolic fathers not some new thing that started no this is the finishing remember what precious ointment was on the head flows all the way down to the Bible says the skirts means the end I felt like I opened the can of sardines about this big and this thing's turned into a 55-gallon drum up here honey even got to any where we're going I just notice here here's the purpose notice that they might believe on me through their work notice the purpose of the word going forth notice the effects that it will bring that they may be one that's the work of the ministry there is only one ministry and that's the Ministry of Jesus Christ through the seven churches the work of the ministry it's God's work to unify us in faith it's God's work to perfect you and I it's God's work that you and I come unto the full statue of a perfect man it's God's work that they may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee see here's what would happen those that would just stay there and say oh my God was in Christ I know God manifest himself in that body but if they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost they miss their day of visitation they fail to understand what has been manifest before them do you realize here here in the third pull opening of a Ministry of the Lord Jesus you know the first and second pool there was and there was that of the secrets of the hearts that were made known there were there were many diseases many things that were healed but here in the third in the opening of the third pool of his ministry John 6 he begins to sit down and you begin to find a weeding out and then has it continues to move on that third pole is coming into a place where the Ministry of the Lord Jesus is coming to the time of where the offering up and then through the crucifixion then through the resurrection he makes himself known to the disciples what's he doing he's gathering them to the promise by the promise and he's gathering them so that the promise now might be made manifest in them see not just to him in him not just to them but in them it's not just looking at the message but it's to have the message in you and you and it not enough to talk about the token is to get under it has thou father art in me and I in thee this is the kind of oneness not goodness how many times you hear brother Branham say over and over he said when people say I've got the Holy Ghost and he says that what spirit you have in you won't cope with the word how is that the Holy Ghost you see if you've got the Spirit of Christ within you remember he's in the father the father's in him you're in him and he is in you there is a unity so the Spirit of God does not break unity with the word alright notice that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me haha one enough see there's a plurality no that's just a lack of understanding on your part the reality is that Christ Himself is the manifested word and that manifested word is the father he is the word revealed from word to flesh it is the same because it is the same nature I am God and I changed not when he said I have come in my father's name the same character that the world why-why that the world may believe that thou has sent me so us being one together with him is a testimony he's come and he's coming he's come you weren't allowed to laugh 2,000 years ago no but he come that he might come in me and he came to me that he might come for me 3 comings that the world may believe you see your life your life my life is a testimony of His grace trophies of His grace remember here's the picture that the world may see verse 22 I'm coming down prepare for landing and the glory look at this and the glory which thou gavest me I have given there was nothing about self here nothing about self it's about you and me what you've given me the glory why that they may be one even as we are one you know what I'm seeing over and over here unity comes by sacrifice it comes by giving oh brother Samuel I've got a hundred dollar bill that's wonderful raise your hand we'll collect it put in the mission fun offering but I ain't talking about that kind of giving you can give all that and give everything else and you miss the principle part that God wants you to give God wants us to give of our lives and keep giving of our lives and the real giving of our lives requires us dying day later that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them that the world may know that you have sent me and that thou has loved them as thou hast loved me he loves you with the same kind of love the same no I'm on a boat this morning he loves you the same way he loves you the same way there's no storm that can sink your boat you with me all the Devils in hell canna sail against you but his love notice it's something that is seen friends I just say it like this don't let don't let the devil make a union or what is thought to be a union that you come to this church that's not a union with Christ I know brother Evans a prophet that's not a union with Christ and I you know I believe that the message is true that's not a union with Christ don't I'm just from my heart don't just take an association when you have access to the full promise you see there's no excuse to say I can't live a victorious life I agree with you but you let him who is the victor come on the inside and he'll live his victory through you he'll manifest that you are the victory of Calvary the reason that he went the reason that he come the reason that he would send his word even in this hour this is God's desire for unity a oneness think of how but the Lord Jesus himself would say it a new commandment I write unto you that you would love one another once you think of this a new commandment it wasn't a new commandment in the sense that God had not already said that in the commandments but God was releasing what was needed in order to do that because this is not our love it's his love we love one another with his love and showing that that in itself comes forth when Paul can even write in Ephesians 5 of the unity between a husband and wife he does not say husbands figlio your wives but he says agapo that's higher than our figlio how can that be if agapo is not in US and we're not in a gobble it must be the love of God within us and the love of God in us it triumphs it perseveres it takes a valuation of situations to recognize that the way that I handle this situation there's little eyes watching me and it's not that we're doing it because of little eyes watching us because the truth be known whether you got little eyes around you or not you got his eyes and whether you do it or not his I see here and so we want to walk pleasing to the Lord we want to make sure there's a union to where that character it's a molding and a shaping that our arrow is not going through air like this we want to make sure it's such a unity that that character can be molded if God did not become one of us then you and I could never be born again and without being born again we could never have our character molded to match his own glorious character unity precedes character but when unity has come then character starts being built character comes forth and you know what what's needed in order to hold these fletchings right in place God moves in our life moves in our life you know God allows circumstances to come in our life to Humble us I mean know that sometimes of old mind what I've got so much humility right there that's pride but God God knows just what to do so we have the right drag it's not gonna be head over heels flying straight to the prize suppose salmon he's got his work cut out for him I know I know we and we know that too but you know what greater is He that is in us then he that's in the world so when you look at that and you bring it down into the home you bring it down for your marriage you bring it down for your children don't try to start working on well I'm gonna work on her and I'm gonna work on him and we really need to work on these children stop unity first unity first and then unity will actually bring the effect of the training the teaching the molding how many heard that the Prophet how many heard the Prophet tells us in the message token he said when that token is applied he said speak to him in love he said they long to hear you say something to them I asked what is that that's Christ Christ in you Christ in me it's Christ with love and consideration so it first starts with unity unity let's just stop here is unity important sure is very very very important but unity in the right way in the right way let's pray Lord Jesus I pray father this morning or Jesus for the word that you have given to us we thank you Lord and father Lord from tenderness of our hearts this is our request Lord we want to give ourselves to this word to you mold is Lord Seamus Lord if there's one or more whether they're just sitting here now new or maybe they've been for years or God may there not be one that would take for granted the privilege and opportunity that you have made available that we have been and can be made one with you well it's not just one in our thinking what's deeper it's where we're one from within Lord Jesus I've read these statements here Lord that you've given to us Lord God here in this hour to where Lord within the Dominical world in many places they would read this same scripture but the Spirit of God picks it up in this hour showing that this is the only program that you've laid down the program of God that we would be one but it is not as men would so think and try to order it it's not just coming together as a group of churches that are bound together we realize the Lord that that very thought itself is also moved by a spirit binding the tears together for the burning but Lord God the people of God have always been and are united by the promise of God down through the ages Lord as your children has been and are united by the promise of your coming waiting for your coming Lord Jesus I pray this morning may there not be one young or old that God would place their refuge in this church they take that Lord as the old that that's a unity no it's the Lord God wonderful to be able to Lord to come among the order body of believers in people Lord God that would love you and pray for you and care for you the Lord God may may they realize the Lord God that in order for there to be a real true unity Lord that is for you to be in them or maybe some of them Lord God leave things of the world they can look at and they can say why I no longer drink I no no there's smoke and I no longer run around and I no longer do this then Lord God is that you that is the heartbeat of their life is it you the one that they crave and they long for that they delight in Lord is it you that they desire to please or God not just have they been where they no longer do these things but are you the all and the Sun and the theme and the desire and the delight of their life Lord God to where it is about you to where when people meet them people talk with them Lord God they know that Jesus Christ is the theme of their life Lord we're not talking about doctrine we're not you're not talking about somebody being able to explain this and laid this out in the scripture that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a life where Paul could say when Christ who is our life when he shall appear we shall be like him what I pray if there's one here this morning that would desire that Lord because that's your desire I pray this morning the Lord God as they would make it nook known by an uplifted hand Lord and say Lord I want to be united and I want the Holy Spirit down in the depths of my soul amen god bless you god bless those hands I don't want to be just one who is associated because I know that just being around this church that's not enough I must be baptized by one spirit into one body and if the question is arising in your heart right now here is what you yield to you first repent for maybe someone who's new repent acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior Lord forgive me of my sins and Lord Jesus I accept you as my savior and the next part of that step coming together is to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that baptism is not identifying you with this church here it's identifying you with your sacrifice that you are witnessing he is my Savior the Lord Jesus Christ to be baptized for the remission of your sins the remission means the loosening as one who is set free that I'm no longer gonna be walking underneath this sin bear oh my you might say brother Samuel I've known the Lord for many years I now be careful I'm not asking if you know about him I'm asking do you know him what the call of the Holy Spirit is is that do you know him do you serve Him or are you just acquainted with him don't just be acquainted with him be one with let him flow down through every avenue of your life and the last part of that is you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost his life that has been calling you and working in your life to draw you to repentance that has moved within your life to even open you to this place of which that you would even surrender right now you yielding to that life the Holy Spirit himself and then he moves down into the depth of your life to receive you in him what grace what grace I wonder this morning let me just invite you may be this morning you've not walked into the waters of baptism would there be any that would be willing and desire to say I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ okay god bless that hand god bless you sister amen I wonder if there's one here as we raise those hands ago you say I want that Union in my life now you believe it don't just raise your hand it's not just raising your hand with a hope so remember this is for you of how the Holy Spirit would take and direct these things to come in this moment of an open invitation this is God's grace ministered personally to you this morning god bless those hands this morning you believe that that is for you the promise is for you that when we pray right now you lay aside everything else out of your mind every doubt you cast every doubt aside lay it aside to know that this promise this is for me and I ask the rest of you how many of you would say Lord I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost I want a refilling of the Holy Spirit a refreshing of the dew of Hermon that descended upon the mountains of Zion I want to refresh you I want to refresh believe that this for you this refreshing is for you think of it just one chapter two chapters after they received the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter two was two chapters later they came together again and prayed and they were filled again with the Holy Ghost oh my I believe he's here can we pray together now let's pray together as believers knowing recognizing that this promise is for us you have need of healing in your body maybe need of deliverance maybe it's oppression maybe it's depression he knows what it is and he's the Lord that healeth all thy diseases so let's approach our Heavenly Father right now Lord Jesus father as we come in that all-sufficient and redemptive mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ our sacrifice our lamb Oh Lord God our provided way of approach Lord Father there are needs and requests Lord that are here that were already upon the hearts Lord before the world ever went forth but Lord you you come by way of your word Lord because you're not just here just to speak Lord but you're here to minister to our needs support I pray God for the hand Lord or Jesus had that little one Lord that raised their hand and said I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father God I think you dear Lord God that though father Lord God all that demons out of hail Lord or father may have tried to keep Lord God that heart Lord back Lord and that hand from being raised Lord God but to know that father you already touched her heart Lord God before and Lord sure desire is Lord God to walk on in to the waters of baptism Lord for one purpose Lord and that's to be united with you Lord on that that same life Lord God might live Lord God effectually Lord God in her life Lord God grant in Lord Jesus I pray father that God that you would just move for her right now Lord God according to the confession of her faith Lord and I asked Lord God for each and every one Lord hands that were lifted up Lord hearts that are behind those hands Lord God that desire Lord God not just to be associated Lord around the church - Lord Li associated around the message Lord but God their desire Lord is to be one with the God of the message Lord that the Living God would live Lord God down in the depths of their life Lord God that father they're not Lord God gonna remain idle Lord God but they realize the Lord God in the emptying of of their life Lord God it's that you might feel them Lord and father this promise is for them Lord when you may bad Lord God great declaration Lord through the lips of Peter who had reached back by the Spirit of God and pulled out of Joel and identified by the Spirit of God that this is the season this is the time this is the outpouring of the Holy Ghost father so say I now Lord under the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord God may they receive the Holy Ghost Lord God may they receive Lord the person of Jesus Christ Lord into the depths of their life or God - where they're United with you Lord one in purpose Lord one in mind Lord God one in heart father - where Lord God the very Lord heartbeat of God moves and pulsates through their life Lord our God - where they are a picture show of the love of God they are a picture show Lord of the divine love of God that's moved Lord God not just the column out of the world not just to clean them up Lord God but moves down to where they can testify and others can say I'll tell you what that young that woman that man there's some about them I'm telling you what's a truth there is an atmosphere about their life Oh Lord God it's something Lord - where when they walk in Lord and whether they're around their home whether they're around others Lord in the congregation or they're around on their job there's something about it Lord though they may not be able to quote and lay everything out but there's one thing about it their life displays a picture that they are united with the Lord Jesus Christ that he is the love of their life he is their love program in Lord God granted this morning Lord father behind Lord these hands this morning I got my hands up Lord I want a refilling Lord one filling many refilling supporting Lord God I'm told by your prophet as he would draw our attention to what a real revival is then a real revival he said it's not adding any more water into the lake that what is already there but he said what a revival is is where that wind will glory gets to move and there upon that water and as the water itself is troubled it will actually move the trash that's out in the lake where people have discarded things and it will push it to the shore Oh glory be to God where there are words that have been loosely spoken actions which have been Lord loosely conducted father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we ask for God for our filling of the Holy Ghost Lord down into our lives Lord God father that everything that is unlike you Lord God will wash Oh God to the shores of our lips in repentance Lord God coming from our heart Lord God Oh
