[19:03] [Applause]
[19:04] [Music]
[19:18] Oh
[19:20] [Music]
[19:26] oh I had a senior moment
[20:03] good morning Saints we don't get to come
[20:05] down here that often anymore so it's
[20:07] nice to see everyone this morning I was
[20:10] thinking this morning as we got off of
[20:12] something brother Branham said a long
[20:16] time ago he said what a resurrection
[20:18] that that was but what a resurrection
[20:21] this is and so I say Shalom to all of
[20:25] these resurrected Saints out here that
[20:28] have experienced that resurrection for
[20:30] yourself this is a song many years ago
[20:33] that was sung at my sister's wedding and
[20:36] a couple years ago our pastor brother
[20:40] Todd was preaching on perfect love and
[20:41] how we tend to think of God's love with
[20:43] our figlio love with our bodies and and
[20:45] that's where our mind goes but God's
[20:47] love is not thought with our bodies with
[20:50] our figlio love and it goes so much
[20:52] deeper and that our love actually comes
[20:54] from our origin and that we originated
[20:57] from him and that's where our love comes
[20:58] from so on the way home from that
[21:00] service I thought of the song that had
[21:03] been sung at my sister's wedding and I
[21:04] hadn't thought of it she'd been married
[21:06] I don't say how many years ago but she's
[21:08] been married a long time and I thought
[21:11] of this song and then God just started
[21:12] dropping new words into my heart based
[21:14] on that sermon and gave me new
[21:16] inspiration for that song so it's about
[21:19] Isaac and Rebekah but then it turns into
[21:21] our story it turns into the bride's
[21:23] story of where we are now on this song
[21:26] and I don't even know why keep so I just
[21:30] started singing one day as I was doing
[21:36] what I'd done so many times I heard of
[21:42] someone
[21:44] and who lived far away
[21:47] I was asked if I would go and be his
[21:53] chosen bride I went with his servant
[21:59] twas in the evening time when I heard
[22:06] his servant cry behold your Isaac this
[22:13] man I've brought you to behold there he
[22:19] stands my promise was true
[22:24] and now Rebekah my time with you is done
[22:30] you nineteen time with your Isaac has
[22:37] begun are you in love with this
[22:41] wonderful word of life and are you
[22:48] living like a virtuous wife are you
[22:54] wearing the wedding band of unmerited
[23:00] grace do you know your Isaac is he still
[23:07] preferred above all that you've observed
[23:17] the Bible was written for his bride in
[23:22] the end time and now we can see what was
[23:29] always in his mind
[23:33] by Isaac and I are one it's an invisible
[23:40] Union this perfect loves revealed it
[23:45] comes from my origin this love will take
[23:51] me to my future
[23:54] [Music]
[23:58] behold your Isaac its Christ revealed to
[24:03] you in a cloud he came down and showed
[24:09] himself in view and now
[24:14] Rebecca just like the evening time and
[24:22] like Rebecca who in the evening time be
[24:30] hailed her Isaac so are you now little

[45:10] name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[45:17] want to just greet each and every one of
[45:20] you and some different visitors that are
[45:23] here may God bless you and just want to
[45:28] make a few announcements here I know
[45:30] that the sisters are warning very
[45:32] quickly to meet right after the service
[45:34] in the back conference room that won't
[45:36] be too long I know that this is Easter
[45:40] Sunday and you probably have other plans
[45:42] and plans to get to as well but the
[45:46] meeting itself will just be a very quick
[45:48] meeting just in regards to the upcoming
[45:52] meetings that we have coming up here at
[45:54] the end of May and the fellowship dinner
[45:57] that would be associated with that there
[46:00] will also be some emails that are coming
[46:02] out and regarding that but please set
[46:05] that aside on your on your calendar for
[46:09] that Memorial Day weekend brother Tim
[46:11] Humes will be here with us and we just
[46:13] want to keep that in prayer that the
[46:15] Lord would just just move and just speak
[46:18] to our hearts in a special way and also
[46:22] I wanted to say that if there's anyone
[46:24] that is willing to we always get
[46:27] requests for different ones that are
[46:30] coming in we had last year once again
[46:32] requests for those that were asking to
[46:34] stay with someone so if you would be
[46:39] willing whether it's a brother or a
[46:41] couple brothers or whether it's
[46:43] you know whether it's sisters they're in
[46:46] the home if you would just if you just
[46:48] let brother Shane know and then he can
[46:50] we can just kind of go from there if we
[46:53] hear anything because we usually get
[46:54] that on the Facebook and and sometimes
[46:57] there's just like I said sometimes it's
[46:59] situations financially it's a little bit
[47:01] more affordable for someone if they have
[47:03] somebody to stay with those that are
[47:06] coming in then there's other times where
[47:08] people just like to stay with someone
[47:11] else and if we have young people that's
[47:14] coming in one thing that I certainly we
[47:17] we like doing during this time this is
[47:19] where they have some some different
[47:22] older ones who actually can express to
[47:25] them what the Lord has not only done in
[47:29] their life but what he's doing and it's
[47:31] a little bit of a disciple and it's one
[47:34] of it's something that is just a very
[47:36] precious reality you know within our
[47:39] hearts because of what God has done in
[47:41] our hearts we we want to share and we
[47:43] want to encourage amen
[47:46] one another so we just we just thank God
[47:49] for His mercy for that I just want to
[47:52] also there's a car that we'd receive
[47:54] from from brother Greg and sister
[47:57] Suzanne as well as the gsella dawn
[47:59] family brother which would be sister
[48:02] Suzanne's father there for the Claudio
[48:05] we know that he went on home to his
[48:07] reward and they just were wanting to
[48:09] thank the church for the flowers and for
[48:14] just all that was done in the prayers
[48:17] during that time so he's already he's
[48:21] already went to his reward he's already
[48:24] he's already there amen
[48:27] but soon and very soon we're going to be
[48:29] united again amen soon and very soon
[48:33] amen
[48:34] so we just want to just approach the
[48:36] word here this morning and just see how
[48:38] the Lord will just direct us in mark in
[48:41] mark chapter 16 is where I'd like to go
[48:44] for a few moments here mark chapter 16
[48:56] and let's just we'll begin reading at
[48:59] verse one and when the Sabbath was
[49:05] passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[49:08] mother of James and some salmi had had
[49:14] bought sweet spices that they might come
[49:17] and anoint him and very early in the
[49:20] morning the first day of the week they
[49:22] came unto the sepulchre at the rising of
[49:25] the Sun and they said among themselves
[49:28] who shall roll us away the stone from
[49:31] the door of the sepulchre and when they
[49:34] looked they saw that the stone was
[49:38] rolled away for it was very great and
[49:41] entering into the sepulchre they saw a
[49:44] young man sitting on the right side
[49:46] clothed in a long white garment and they
[49:49] were affrighted and he said unto them be
[49:52] not a frightened ye seek Jesus of
[49:56] Nazareth which was crucified
[49:59] He is risen he is not here behold the
[50:03] place where they laid him but go your
[50:07] way tell his disciples and Peter that he
[50:10] goeth before you into Galilee there
[50:13] shall you see him as he said unto you
[50:16] they went out quickly and fled from the
[50:18] sepulchre for they trembled and were
[50:20] amazed neither said they anything to any
[50:23] man for they were afraid
[50:26] now when Jesus was risen early the first
[50:29] day of the week he appeared first to
[50:31] Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast
[50:33] Seven Devils and she went and told them
[50:37] that had been with him as they mourned
[50:40] and wept and they when they had heard
[50:43] that he was alive and had been seen of
[50:46] her believed not may God bless you bless
[50:50] the reading of his word as you're being
[50:52] seated
[51:02] no doubt the these passages of Scripture
[51:08] they would be read throughout the world
[51:13] and for those who has already been
[51:15] within services would have been read
[51:18] whether early in the morning or even
[51:21] during this time but one thing about it
[51:24] we we believe that as believers that
[51:28] we're not just we're not just reading of
[51:32] history but we realized that the
[51:36] scripture all Scripture is given by
[51:38] inspiration and we recognize that that
[51:42] the Word of God the Bible the scriptures
[51:45] its prophecy what God did before he's
[51:49] the same God and he'll do it the same
[51:52] way and so when we we look at this they
[51:57] had they heard and there were reports
[52:00] that were being given to that of the
[52:03] disciples and but yet after even hearing
[52:07] they needed to see they were believers
[52:11] they were believers but they needed to
[52:14] see him there's nothing can ever
[52:18] substitute or take the place of seeing
[52:21] him now he's not going to come here this
[52:25] morning and make himself known with nail
[52:29] prints in his hands or his side Riven
[52:33] but he comes as he came to them there in
[52:37] the resurrection they were walking on
[52:40] the road to Emmaus with him in Luke 24
[52:42] and the Bible says their eyes were
[52:46] Holden that they would not know him but
[52:48] he went through the word and he began to
[52:52] take the promises that identified and
[52:56] were fulfilled within the ministry all
[53:00] of the suffering and all of the promises
[53:03] that pertained to him and he unfolded
[53:06] himself by way of his word so that here
[53:10] that they would know him and it was then
[53:12] when he came in among them
[53:14] and he broke the bread when they invited
[53:16] him in that he did something there that
[53:19] he had already done before before he was
[53:23] ever crucified and they recognized it
[53:26] was him
[53:27] now you see the word itself it had to be
[53:30] where he would come and make himself
[53:32] known in the form of his word because
[53:35] there was a promise that laid for that
[53:38] of the believers where where the reason
[53:40] the whole coming of the Lord Jesus
[53:42] Christ it was more than just Calvary you
[53:46] know many times it's looked at and and
[53:48] what spoke of over and over is the cross
[53:50] and the crucifixion thank God that he
[53:53] was willing to go for you and I but that
[53:56] was in order to pay a price that he
[53:59] might be able to release to you and I
[54:01] that life that was needed in order to
[54:05] raise you and I up and when you you
[54:08] think of it of how that you know he he
[54:10] came among them here in his word and and
[54:13] he began to make himself known I want to
[54:16] just break in here for a few moments
[54:17] into John chapter 20 where it talks
[54:20] about where he Mary Magdalene was there
[54:23] and here she is coming to the the tomb
[54:26] and when she came there remember here
[54:30] the angels they asked her in verse 13
[54:32] they said to her woman why weepest thou
[54:35] and she said because they have taken
[54:38] away my Lord and I know not where they
[54:41] have laid him and when she had dust said
[54:44] she turned herself back and saw Jesus
[54:47] standing and knew not that it was Jesus
[54:51] now here is one who washed his feet this
[54:56] was not somebody who had seen him you
[54:59] know from a great distance and really
[55:01] just you know kind of had made something
[55:03] out fuzzy but she had seen him
[55:06] physically she knew him but then she
[55:09] also knew him as the one who where she
[55:13] had come and her life was all twisted up
[55:17] and and she and her self she was so
[55:20] bound as the Bible would would tell us
[55:22] here she was bound with seven devils but
[55:26] yet she came to the feet
[55:28] the Lord Jesus and in which she made
[55:30] herself there to his feet to wash his
[55:33] feet there was something in her heart
[55:35] that drew her there and remember it was
[55:38] there that when we understand she was
[55:40] actually set free of what she was bound
[55:44] with and and we know you and I there's
[55:47] no letter like she knew him to be the
[55:49] Messiah's she's seen this but here she
[55:52] is standing face to face and she doesn't
[55:55] know that it's him you see you can be
[55:58] standing face to face and the Lord Jesus
[56:00] Christ standing right there and speaking
[56:03] to you and you don't even recognize who
[56:06] it is but you see one thing that he'll
[56:09] always you can always count on
[56:11] he will always reveal himself by his
[56:14] word in his word and he will make
[56:17] himself known that he's the same
[56:19] yesterday today and forever the Bible
[56:22] said once again let me read it she saw
[56:24] Jesus standing and she knew not that it
[56:27] was Jesus and Jesus said unto her what's
[56:30] this words woman why weepest thou
[56:33] why seek us now her whom seekest thou
[56:36] shes supposing him to be the gardener
[56:39] said unto him sir if thou have borne him
[56:43] hence tell me where thou has laid him
[56:46] and I will take him away so she's
[56:49] talking to him Jesus didn't change his
[56:54] dialect come on somebody but you see
[56:59] here there's a veil that's over her and
[57:02] even when he would address her in a
[57:05] general term woman that is not enough to
[57:09] break that veil from around her life but
[57:12] now in the next verse where he turns
[57:14] around and says Mary when he when he
[57:18] moved it from just a general term and he
[57:21] actually called her name he was letting
[57:24] her know I know you
[57:28] there was something that was contained
[57:29] within that voice the expression of that
[57:32] word that characteristic it broke the
[57:36] veil that was over her eyes and the one
[57:39] that she was searching for the one she
[57:42] was looking for she was talking to he
[57:46] had been talking to her
[57:48] oh girl repeated God he was standing
[57:53] right there before her and when she
[57:55] recognized he's the very one I've been
[57:57] searching for he's the very one I've
[58:00] been looking for it became personal and
[58:03] the veil was lifted from her eyes oh my
[58:08] then we understand you know how that it
[58:12] came in this hour the disciples you know
[58:16] and here they had they had walked with
[58:18] him and my you know that what they
[58:21] fought what they fought even when they
[58:24] walked with him on the road you know
[58:26] they didn't understand about the
[58:28] suffering they didn't know they didn't
[58:30] know that he was gonna have to suffer
[58:32] that they were veiled from that they
[58:34] didn't understand that remember they
[58:36] were they were cast down even in their
[58:39] heart and their spirit said we thought
[58:41] he was to be the Redeemer we thought he
[58:44] was to be the Messiah but you see it
[58:46] wasn't for them in that hour to
[58:49] understand that of the suffering because
[58:51] he alone is the one that would to bear
[58:55] the suffering he alone is the one that
[58:57] would bear the sin the iniquity the
[58:59] transgression he would bear all of that
[59:02] he would take all of that the
[59:04] chastisement of our peace would be laid
[59:06] upon him there is nothing that not one
[59:08] of them could help him out in that he
[59:10] had to go and take that alone
[59:12] all glory and he took all of that alone
[59:15] and now here they are they're going
[59:17] about you know in their life you you
[59:19] know you and I have we've been through
[59:21] times some situations in our life where
[59:23] events and tragedies happen and you just
[59:26] feel numb
[59:27] anybody know I'm talking about I never
[59:31] forget you know when when the Lord took
[59:32] my dad on I just felt numb
[59:35] they're just like a shock that just you
[59:37] just numb wasn't you know if there's
[59:40] other things that take place and and I
[59:42] think of it you know within this that no
[59:45] doubt you know when I look at that just
[59:48] in the little things that we could
[59:49] relate to here they were they were in a
[59:52] state of shock and a state of numbness
[59:55] but you realized that here of all the
[59:57] miracles they had seen a lot of miracles
[59:59] I want you to pay attention now they had
[1:00:01] seen a lot of miracles there was
[1:00:03] healings that accompanied his ministry
[1:00:05] the Bible tells us in the book of Acts
[1:00:07] that meant Jesus was a man of God
[1:00:10] approved among them was signs and
[1:00:13] wonders following his life now listen
[1:00:16] there had always been healing mental
[1:00:18] doubt were many others who had even came
[1:00:20] before him where there were healings and
[1:00:23] there were miracles but yet there were
[1:00:24] things that did stand out that even
[1:00:27] where the blind man would say that
[1:00:29] there's never been anything recorded
[1:00:30] where a man was healed in this manner
[1:00:33] even since the foundation of the world
[1:00:36] but you see of all the healings of all
[1:00:39] the signs of all the wonders yet the
[1:00:41] greatest proof that he himself was who
[1:00:45] he said he was was when he got up on
[1:00:48] that Easter morning when he rose up on
[1:00:51] that Easter morning brother that itself
[1:00:53] there was an announcement that could
[1:00:55] ring out in that hour that the sin debt
[1:00:58] has been paid
[1:00:59] he had already declared it is finished
[1:01:03] there on the cross he had stood there in
[1:01:05] the midst of all the temptation that the
[1:01:08] enemy had offered him he had stood
[1:01:10] faithful on that word and here he was
[1:01:12] now coming forward to sound that Jubilee
[1:01:16] trumpet that year is finished there has
[1:01:19] been a blood that has atoned for sin
[1:01:22] that there is little and there is a
[1:01:24] voice that goes out that says he can be
[1:01:27] free hallelujah never was in Easter
[1:01:31] morning never was there a sunrise like
[1:01:34] this sunrise that sunrise was a special
[1:01:38] sunrise amen there was a dual Sun rising
[1:01:42] that morning there was a Sun that broke
[1:01:45] over the horizon but at the same time
[1:01:48] there was a son that also rose and not
[1:01:52] just a son but the son of God he rose he
[1:01:56] he triumphed over Satan's Trinity of
[1:02:00] death hail in the grave and he rose up
[1:02:03] on that Easter morning to be able to
[1:02:05] bring it to you and I that I am he that
[1:02:08] was dead and I'm alive forevermore you
[1:02:12] see he who was alive he died you and I
[1:02:20] were in a condition of death but in
[1:02:27] order for us to be raised and I I'm
[1:02:30] talking about down in our soul for there
[1:02:34] to come a change within our life there
[1:02:36] had to be a price that was paid in order
[1:02:40] for that life to be released to you and
[1:02:42] I in order to raise that seed up you
[1:02:44] know how it is you take a seed you bury
[1:02:47] that see we see the plants even coming
[1:02:49] up right now you have to bury that seed
[1:02:51] and in that seed when the water begins
[1:02:54] to come around it it begins to actually
[1:02:56] rot all of that outer casing so that the
[1:02:59] germ of life on the inside can come
[1:03:01] forth and that's what the light will do
[1:03:03] the light will draw that that life it'll
[1:03:06] draw it up from the ground now think
[1:03:09] about this here because when we look at
[1:03:12] this in terms of where Mary was at
[1:03:17] she was standing face to face with him
[1:03:21] and he spoke to her but she don't
[1:03:25] realize it's him
[1:03:27] it wasn't until as we said moments ago
[1:03:31] that he called her name that she
[1:03:34] recognized who he was to think about how
[1:03:38] that Jesus now now through this word the
[1:03:41] the word that has come to pass he's
[1:03:44] actually now moving and he gathers
[1:03:46] together all of those sheep that had
[1:03:48] been scattered he's bringing them all
[1:03:51] together now
[1:03:52] they were so as we said numb and
[1:03:55] disheartened and downcast and you know
[1:03:58] what things didn't go as they thought it
[1:04:00] ought to go but everything was happening
[1:04:03] just exactly how it ought to be
[1:04:05] happening and he began to bring them
[1:04:08] together what was it that was bringing
[1:04:10] them together it was the fulfillment of
[1:04:13] that promise of the word that was
[1:04:16] drawing them together and the whole
[1:04:18] point was it had to bring them together
[1:04:20] so that they themselves could receive
[1:04:23] the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:25] you see it wasn't just the offering up
[1:04:27] at Calvary but now through that offering
[1:04:30] now that life could be poured out upon
[1:04:32] the other children of God that it would
[1:04:36] bring sons and daughters of God that had
[1:04:39] been housed in there you know like seeds
[1:04:41] that were dead but now that life could
[1:04:44] come and raise up those sons and
[1:04:46] daughters of God nothing else could do
[1:04:49] it
[1:04:49] except his own life think about it how
[1:04:51] they were there you know on the day of
[1:04:53] Pentecost they were all gathered
[1:04:56] together and Jesus let him know that he
[1:04:59] said I I will send the promise of my
[1:05:02] father upon you he let her know that you
[1:05:07] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:05:09] is poured out upon you is that right he
[1:05:13] let him know that he there was there was
[1:05:15] a declaring there of what would take
[1:05:17] place and to think about it how that the
[1:05:20] Church of the Living God in this hour in
[1:05:22] this time here here would would come
[1:05:25] forth there on the day of Pentecost and
[1:05:28] what is just stay with me here just a
[1:05:30] few moment
[1:05:31] how the church would come forth there
[1:05:34] where when he when he arose reading
[1:05:37] Goethe Caiaphas's he didn't go to the
[1:05:41] religious people in that hour they had
[1:05:44] already rejected him but he came and
[1:05:47] gathered his disciples he did not go to
[1:05:51] them and say see two canvases on the
[1:05:54] rest see I'm the one who was you know I
[1:05:56] see everything is true I'm the one who
[1:05:59] was he did not go to them because it
[1:06:01] wouldn't matter they wouldn't believe
[1:06:02] him anyhow if they wouldn't believe him
[1:06:06] before they won't believe him now but he
[1:06:09] goes together those who had believed on
[1:06:13] him and now he's gathering them unto
[1:06:16] himself now here will we recognize that
[1:06:18] within it that when you you consider and
[1:06:21] think about it that here of the Church
[1:06:24] of the Living God of how that God
[1:06:26] himself would give would give there on
[1:06:29] the day of Pentecost he would actually
[1:06:31] give the bride there that would come
[1:06:34] forth from that second atom from the
[1:06:37] Lord Jesus Christ remember his sign I
[1:06:39] know I'm going kind of quick but his
[1:06:41] side was open and when his side was open
[1:06:44] remember what came out of his side there
[1:06:46] it was the water it was blood and it was
[1:06:48] spirit is that right he released what
[1:06:51] was needed in order to bring you an eye
[1:06:54] back to his side when he laid Adam down
[1:06:57] in the beginning there he opened up his
[1:07:00] side and he took out a reel and he began
[1:07:03] to multiply on that rib and after there
[1:07:06] as he multiplied on that rib he
[1:07:08] separated the spirit there and he left
[1:07:11] the masculine part there within Adam and
[1:07:14] brought that feminine part original
[1:07:16] spirit brought it fair inside of Adam's
[1:07:19] bride is that right and then he
[1:07:22] presented Adam with his bride and Adam
[1:07:24] could say she's bone of my bone flesh of
[1:07:27] my flesh
[1:07:27] she's life of my life that was a pre
[1:07:30] figure of what would take place because
[1:07:33] of Calvary
[1:07:35] well that inside of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:38] there was a great mystery that was a
[1:07:40] longing there was that of redemption
[1:07:42] where he had within him his bride that
[1:07:45] which would be his body that which rid
[1:07:48] he was come to redeem and on the day of
[1:07:51] Pentecost here when the Spirit of God is
[1:07:55] poured out the church itself of the
[1:07:57] Living God was born there and the day of
[1:08:00] Pentecost given straight from the hand
[1:08:03] of God I want to just read this here it
[1:08:05] was given that last Adam was given a
[1:08:08] bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and
[1:08:11] she remained separate and undefiled for
[1:08:15] some time this was before the Ephesian
[1:08:18] age ever started
[1:08:20] she was undefiled she was pure now when
[1:08:25] I refer to that of the fission Age I'm
[1:08:27] talking about Gentile Church ages there
[1:08:29] was a ages of which God would call out a
[1:08:32] bride but here and Pinnacle's
[1:08:34] when he poured out of his spirit there
[1:08:36] and now when we see of how that the
[1:08:39] bride herself she would come forth
[1:08:41] it was pure undefiled then there was
[1:08:45] everything about it for that space I
[1:08:47] believe about twenty years
[1:08:49] it was absolutely pure it was a bride
[1:08:51] age in that hour a time where in that we
[1:08:54] find the maturity of that life event of
[1:08:57] that one that had rose on that Easter
[1:08:59] morning here it was reflected within the
[1:09:02] bride in that hour
[1:09:05] perfect reflection they're the same life
[1:09:07] being made manifest again but then we
[1:09:10] find as you know as Bible readers you
[1:09:14] know you find within it that how that
[1:09:17] when the church entered they're in into
[1:09:20] the first age of the Gentile ages and I
[1:09:24] might just drop it like you know when we
[1:09:25] look at this to find that how God would
[1:09:29] actually through the Old Testament he
[1:09:31] spoke about saving the Gentiles he spoke
[1:09:37] about that through the Book of Isaiah on
[1:09:38] and on and on and on through all the
[1:09:40] minor prophets but what was not known
[1:09:42] was that there was going to be a bride a
[1:09:47] wife that he would take out of the
[1:09:49] Gentiles you see that type was hidden
[1:09:52] there within Joseph when Joseph was put
[1:09:55] away and rejected of his brethren like
[1:09:58] that of the Lord Jesus the Bible says he
[1:10:01] was given a wife a Gentile bride and
[1:10:06] this is where Paul would pick it up in
[1:10:08] Ephesians 5 and talk about the mystery
[1:10:11] of Christ in you that mystery concerning
[1:10:13] the Gentiles that mystery that was
[1:10:16] hidden in in God before the foundation
[1:10:18] of the world and he would call that
[1:10:21] mystery in Ephesians 5 said I'm speaking
[1:10:23] of the great mystery concerning Christ
[1:10:25] and the church so defined that how that
[1:10:29] then when the church here she comes
[1:10:31] forth she's pure undefiled but then we
[1:10:35] understand that you know the Bible is
[1:10:37] very clear that just as you see those
[1:10:41] twins that are work down through the
[1:10:42] ages and down through time we find that
[1:10:45] that Antichrist spirit was also right
[1:10:48] there working in the earth think about
[1:10:51] it it wasn't something way out here they
[1:10:53] under Christ fear we understand that
[1:10:55] that ain't something over here in
[1:10:56] witchcraft that Antichrist spirit is
[1:10:58] that which will stand right there with
[1:11:00] the word but it denies the living Lord
[1:11:03] Jesus Christ it's not anti-world it's
[1:11:07] Antichrist
[1:11:08] it'll look at the word but it denies the
[1:11:10] very power of the Living God who gave
[1:11:13] the word and to bring it to pass
[1:11:17] Laura betta God because as long as that
[1:11:19] word is laying there and how that Satan
[1:11:22] can keep people away from that word
[1:11:24] there is all sorts of confusion and
[1:11:26] muddled up and everybody is left to
[1:11:29] their own faults about things but when
[1:11:31] he steps on the scene he who is the word
[1:11:34] and expressed the word he silences all
[1:11:37] the other opinions and all the other
[1:11:39] philosophies and theologies why he
[1:11:41] declares what he said within his word he
[1:11:44] makes it alive and makes it real
[1:11:48] I'll think about this of how that the
[1:11:51] church when it entered there in that
[1:11:54] Ephesian age remember it enters in there
[1:11:56] as a fallen woman the very verse opening
[1:12:00] part in Revelations to remember from
[1:12:04] whence thou art fallen I have somewhat
[1:12:08] against thee see that spirit had already
[1:12:11] got in there now there was that of the
[1:12:13] elect that had been that stayed true
[1:12:15] with the word but remember this church
[1:12:18] in itself think of how that the Lord
[1:12:20] Jesus himself he even said concerning
[1:12:23] his self when he was standing there and
[1:12:26] the Greeks came to see him in John 12
[1:12:28] they wanted to see Jesus we would see
[1:12:32] Jesus and the disciples brought the
[1:12:35] Greeks to see him now remember all the
[1:12:39] Greeks saw was a man oh it's just
[1:12:43] another man just another gift
[1:12:45] that's all they saw but you see that to
[1:12:49] the elect there was something that was
[1:12:52] beyond that of just another man they
[1:12:56] recognized sure they seen it was God
[1:12:58] veiled in humanity but it was something
[1:13:00] much greater than just just that of a
[1:13:03] man they recognized this is the very one
[1:13:06] as the attenion would say you know and
[1:13:08] and Philip would speak to him this is
[1:13:10] the one that Moses spoke of this is the
[1:13:14] one the prophets we're talking about we
[1:13:16] have found him is that right and it
[1:13:21] wasn't just them the new that Nicodemus
[1:13:23] even told the Lord Jesus he said that
[1:13:25] even those men that were in the
[1:13:27] Sanhedrin he said they
[1:13:29] and we know that thou art a teacher come
[1:13:31] from God we're talking about religious
[1:13:35] people you couldn't put a finger on
[1:13:37] their life but yet they themselves they
[1:13:41] knew he was a man come from God they
[1:13:44] knew there was something different about
[1:13:46] his life
[1:13:47] they knew that there's no way that
[1:13:49] things could be taken place unless God
[1:13:52] was with him you know what that means
[1:13:54] when God is with you his presence is
[1:13:57] with your life it means that his
[1:13:59] presence he himself is with you like he
[1:14:02] would tell Moses like you would tell
[1:14:04] Gideon and he would tell the different
[1:14:05] ones down through time and that is a
[1:14:07] comfort yet to you and I as believers
[1:14:10] where his presence going with you and I
[1:14:13] oh my here the church comes in in that
[1:14:19] time but remember here when we find
[1:14:23] within the church itself there's got to
[1:14:25] be there to wear the seed it would
[1:14:29] actually go into the ground a complete
[1:14:31] time of darkness to where the seed would
[1:14:34] actually be buried that life that
[1:14:37] original life it would go into the
[1:14:39] ground during the dark ages it would be
[1:14:42] buried right in the midst of that Fant
[1:14:44] IRA age but remember when you bury a
[1:14:48] seed whatever seed you plant you do not
[1:14:52] plant a tomato seed and expect to get a
[1:14:55] green pepper whatever seed you plant
[1:14:59] when it comes into full maturity it will
[1:15:04] have the same characteristics because
[1:15:07] the life will bring it forth in that
[1:15:09] manner so here even though when you look
[1:15:13] at the beginning who was that crucified
[1:15:16] him Rome all right put him in a to put a
[1:15:22] Roman seal upon that - so matter of fact
[1:15:25] they said make that tomb as sure as you
[1:15:28] can make it and as sure as they tried to
[1:15:32] make it but yet you can't you cannot
[1:15:34] overthrow prophecy
[1:15:37] because he said he said in the in
[1:15:40] standing upon the word there of what was
[1:15:43] already spoken there by the mouth of
[1:15:46] David that destroy this temple and in
[1:15:49] three days I'll raise it up again
[1:15:51] those men were looking at the physical
[1:15:54] temple that was there but he was
[1:15:55] speaking of his own body is that right
[1:16:00] he was speaking of his own body because
[1:16:02] even when he said except the corn of
[1:16:04] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[1:16:06] abideth alone but if it died you'd bring
[1:16:09] it forth much fruit so to see how that
[1:16:14] you know down through the ages the Bible
[1:16:17] tells us in Joel chapter 2 verse 25 it
[1:16:21] speaks of how the working of the enemy
[1:16:25] little by little to eat away at this
[1:16:30] tree little by little to eat away at
[1:16:34] this bribe that was given through the
[1:16:37] Lord Jesus Christ there at the day of
[1:16:40] Pentecost but it would eat little by
[1:16:43] little and the Bible says in Joel 2:25
[1:16:45] I'm to restore to you the years now
[1:16:49] think of it if the word restore is given
[1:16:52] it declares there's gonna be something
[1:16:54] that's taken and the only way that it
[1:16:57] can come back again is there must be one
[1:17:00] who's able to restore it and when you
[1:17:03] restore anything you don't mean that
[1:17:06] it's not partial partial it's not good
[1:17:09] enough you understand what I'm saying
[1:17:14] it's like you know I've heard it said
[1:17:16] before you know different ones that work
[1:17:18] on you know sometimes they work on cars
[1:17:20] and you're not I know some brothers that
[1:17:22] like they like doing that and they like
[1:17:23] taking you know some older cars and and
[1:17:25] remaking them you know and going in and
[1:17:27] you know redoing and they'll have it in
[1:17:29] their workshop but sometimes when you go
[1:17:31] to those shows you'll see maybe you know
[1:17:34] a Ford truck but inside of that Ford
[1:17:37] truck maybe they couldn't find a Ford
[1:17:39] engine and so they put maybe a Chevy
[1:17:43] engine well I know that'd be tough when
[1:17:44] there
[1:17:47] they put a Chevy engine in there maybe
[1:17:50] they were putting you know on the
[1:17:51] dashboard there you know inside of that
[1:17:53] Ford truck maybe they would find a
[1:17:54] dashboard maybe that was you know off of
[1:17:56] an older Camaro and they would put it in
[1:17:58] there now no matter how good that truck
[1:18:01] looks and you could look at it and say
[1:18:02] my that's a perfectly restored Ford
[1:18:05] truck it's not restored it's only
[1:18:09] restored when it has all of the original
[1:18:14] parts if it has one part that is not
[1:18:18] original it's not restored and here
[1:18:24] already what lay within the prophecy I
[1:18:27] will restore to you the years that the
[1:18:31] locust Hathi the cankerworm and the
[1:18:34] caterpillar and the Palma worm my great
[1:18:37] army which I sent among you now the look
[1:18:40] how that this you know this enemy would
[1:18:43] work the locust the cankerworm the
[1:18:44] caterpillar Palma Lord this is all the
[1:18:46] same bug it's all the same spirit
[1:18:50] working little by little by little eats
[1:18:54] it down to a root but remember the life
[1:18:57] is in the root probably most of you
[1:19:00] right now I know around my house is you
[1:19:02] know I look out there looked out this
[1:19:03] morning when the Sun was coming out I
[1:19:05] still keep checking on it every day rose
[1:19:07] bushes and different lilies and things
[1:19:09] that are coming up right now you know
[1:19:11] what everything rabbits and other things
[1:19:13] hate those things down I cut them down
[1:19:15] at a certain time there you know and
[1:19:16] late fall or early spring you cut the
[1:19:19] things down they're cut down to the
[1:19:20] ground but you know the life itself I
[1:19:22] thought my perennials now the life is
[1:19:24] down there in the roots you start
[1:19:26] letting it warm up and there being a
[1:19:28] moisture that comes on it you'll start
[1:19:29] seeing shoots that are coming out of
[1:19:31] there
[1:19:32] why the life itself is right there in
[1:19:35] the roots and though that Satan himself
[1:19:37] he had off bark he ate off leaves he ate
[1:19:40] off all of this but he could not get to
[1:19:43] the roots in the roots is where the life
[1:19:47] was at in the roots is where and he said
[1:19:51] I will restore unto you all the year
[1:20:00] to think of it how that the church would
[1:20:03] bring under that characteristic of a
[1:20:05] lion that fed that kingship where the
[1:20:08] king himself was roaring out of their
[1:20:10] life where the kingdom of God now had
[1:20:13] moved within the hearts of men by the
[1:20:16] Holy Ghost it had moved in there and now
[1:20:19] how they stand out in that hour they're
[1:20:21] standing there under that authority but
[1:20:24] then as time would go on and his Satan
[1:20:27] would work to find that how that the
[1:20:29] enemy would work to where it would come
[1:20:31] to a place where then his his religion
[1:20:34] he would actually be joined together
[1:20:36] with the government with politics and
[1:20:38] they would actually be able to enforce
[1:20:41] things when stiffer ones did not want to
[1:20:44] worship the way they wanted to worship
[1:20:46] i'ma talk about the true church I'm
[1:20:49] talking about the false church where
[1:20:52] that spirit came in there and here are
[1:20:55] uniting and moving there in another ride
[1:20:57] but notice how the combat is of that
[1:21:00] spirit that would rise there that would
[1:21:03] want to you know it came against the
[1:21:05] Church of the Living God and the think
[1:21:07] of it that as it came against them this
[1:21:09] is where we have all of the millions
[1:21:12] that were martyred down through that
[1:21:14] time and remember in the Book of
[1:21:16] Revelations
[1:21:17] there's a woman that is spoken of in
[1:21:19] there she is called out about what she
[1:21:21] is she's a that means she's an
[1:21:24] unfaithful untrue unclean woman she
[1:21:28] claims to be the Church of the Living
[1:21:31] God she claims to be the bride of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ but remember when her cover was
[1:21:37] taken off what was found in her was the
[1:21:40] blood of the saints come on church I'm
[1:21:43] talking about that Roman Catholic spirit
[1:21:45] that spirit of Babylon that what was
[1:21:48] inside of her she had persecuted it well
[1:21:51] Lou said it was Satan trying to snuff
[1:21:54] that life out just like he did when he
[1:21:56] came against Abel but even though Cain
[1:22:01] slew Abel
[1:22:02] there was a Seth that came forth
[1:22:07] every time that Satan thought he had
[1:22:10] that light but you see he could only
[1:22:13] come against the vessel he could kill
[1:22:15] the vessel when it was time but he could
[1:22:17] not take away that life because that
[1:22:19] life it is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:22:22] that was motivating them down through
[1:22:24] time to fulfill his word you realize
[1:22:27] that for you and me there's not one
[1:22:29] thing that can come and take your life
[1:22:31] unless called first per minute why
[1:22:34] because our life is being motivated by
[1:22:36] the Spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:22:38] you're even motivated by one spirit or
[1:22:40] another so to think about it how would
[1:22:46] they combat this this this power that
[1:22:50] was coming against him through sacrifice
[1:22:55] here comes forth the characteristic of
[1:22:58] an ox and they give of their lives they
[1:23:02] pour their lives out having loved not
[1:23:05] their lives unto death many of them went
[1:23:08] there and they stood there and they
[1:23:10] stood on the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:23:13] in their life young people middle-aged
[1:23:16] people old people everyone all different
[1:23:19] Sall different classes they stood there
[1:23:22] but they stood on that testimony of
[1:23:24] Jesus Christ it was that seed that was
[1:23:27] going in the ground I want you to think
[1:23:29] about it the how that God had said I
[1:23:31] will restore how God would move here if
[1:23:36] you go with me to revelations chapter 14
[1:23:39] and here in them in the Bible when we
[1:23:42] pick this up here recognizing that God
[1:23:45] his promise is that he would restore in
[1:23:49] revelations 14 verse 6
[1:23:52] it says and I saw another angel fly in
[1:23:55] the midst of heaven having the
[1:23:57] everlasting gospel to preach unto them
[1:24:00] that dwell on the earth and to every
[1:24:03] nation and kindred and tongue and people
[1:24:05] saying with a loud voice fear God and
[1:24:09] give glory to him for the hour of his
[1:24:12] judgment has come and worship Him that
[1:24:15] made heaven and earth and the sea and
[1:24:17] the fountains of water so here it is
[1:24:19] calling the worship back to the true and
[1:24:23] living God here is a Ministry notices I
[1:24:26] saw another angel fly in the midst of
[1:24:29] heaven having the everlasting gospel
[1:24:31] here is where the message rings back
[1:24:33] because remember in order to restore
[1:24:35] that life it's going to grow into the
[1:24:38] fullness of its power and here we find
[1:24:41] this ministry that comes forth is that
[1:24:43] where God would would raise up a man you
[1:24:46] know there were many men during this
[1:24:48] time but you know there is a season for
[1:24:50] this word and this scripture to be
[1:24:52] fulfilled no doubt Luther had read
[1:24:55] across the scripture are you with me
[1:24:57] many had read across that scripture but
[1:25:00] you know there came a moment there to
[1:25:02] where that when God would would have
[1:25:04] Luther to stand still and the
[1:25:06] inspiration would strike and think about
[1:25:08] it all his theology and all that he's
[1:25:11] been taught is that sacrament that those
[1:25:13] things are the actual elements of the
[1:25:16] body and of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:18] Christ but the inspiration here in that
[1:25:21] moment it strikes Luther and Luther
[1:25:24] declares their that the just shall live
[1:25:27] by faith you see there was a message to
[1:25:30] go forth a message is not something that
[1:25:32] a man desires to bring it is God's
[1:25:35] desire and that message that God sends
[1:25:39] he has someone that's on earth to be
[1:25:42] able to reflect his desire and take that
[1:25:45] message and if he's got a message to
[1:25:47] give he's got a people that will respond
[1:25:50] to that message there might have been
[1:25:52] millions no doubt that was that would
[1:25:54] never have heeded what Luther spoke in
[1:25:57] that hour but yet there was an intellect
[1:25:59] group of God that was rising up out of
[1:26:02] those dark ages that was coming out of
[1:26:05] the
[1:26:05] well that model looks like he was just a
[1:26:07] little shoot it didn't look like the
[1:26:13] same one that went in the ground but
[1:26:16] hold on to be continued
[1:26:22] who was it that taught Luther we said he
[1:26:26] went to seminary he went the theology
[1:26:28] they didn't teach him this in a moment's
[1:26:33] notice
[1:26:34] the teacher was present the Holy Ghost
[1:26:39] who is the teacher stood right there and
[1:26:42] Luther threw that down and said that is
[1:26:45] not the body of my Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:47] that is not the literal blood you
[1:26:50] realize what that is just a few little
[1:26:52] words like that can take away the power
[1:26:55] that God desires to release for your
[1:26:57] life for them look has all of that think
[1:27:00] of that church as they continue to put
[1:27:02] that forth before people what does it do
[1:27:04] it keeps people in bondage it keeps them
[1:27:08] in bondage where they're looking to keep
[1:27:10] coming back and you know confessing
[1:27:12] their sins let me tell you something
[1:27:13] there is one who rose from the grave and
[1:27:16] when he comes and moves into your life
[1:27:19] you don't have to worry about if I can
[1:27:21] keep this up if I can do this
[1:27:23] he comes in your life and delivers you
[1:27:27] completely who taught Luther the Holy
[1:27:34] Ghost it was revealed but here the Holy
[1:27:39] Spirit it was power
[1:27:41] but that was power to stand there in
[1:27:43] that hour and proclaimed that word
[1:27:46] it was the everlasting gospel it was a
[1:27:49] power of justification whereby that the
[1:27:52] faith of the people was not resting in a
[1:27:56] church your faith if your faith rest in
[1:28:01] this church you got in their own spot
[1:28:04] come on somebody there's one place where
[1:28:07] our faith is to rest and that is in the
[1:28:10] Lord Jesus Christ the just shall live by
[1:28:15] faith before God can ever do one thing
[1:28:19] for you and even for what he can
[1:28:21] continue to do it requires faith it
[1:28:28] moves on in verse eight and there
[1:28:30] followed another angel saying notice
[1:28:33] followed another angel saying Babylon is
[1:28:36] fallen is fallen that great city because
[1:28:39] she made all nations drink of the wine
[1:28:43] of the wrath of her fornication you see
[1:28:46] what's happening she is being exposed
[1:28:49] that's exactly when the Spirit of God
[1:28:51] begins dealing with the heart in life
[1:28:54] you know what he's doing he's exposing
[1:28:56] that hole that's been upon your life
[1:28:58] what you look at and say I can't do this
[1:29:02] but if you only realize it's a spirit
[1:29:04] that's got a hold of your life that's
[1:29:07] why the drunker can get rid of drink
[1:29:09] it's a spirit a demon that's got a hold
[1:29:12] of their life but I'll tell you there's
[1:29:13] a greater one here right here this
[1:29:15] morning that even while you're sitting
[1:29:17] right there he can release that hold
[1:29:20] from around your life he'll give another
[1:29:22] thirst another drink in your life it'll
[1:29:25] inoculate you to where sin itself you
[1:29:28] will reign over it
[1:29:32] hallelujah so how do you know I'm a
[1:29:35] witness
[1:29:38] I'm a witness who was it you see Wesley
[1:29:45] Wesley in this hour
[1:29:48] here's another man no doubt he's right
[1:29:52] across the scriptures but the
[1:29:56] inspiration strikes him was it something
[1:29:59] that he earned in a seminary something
[1:30:03] he learned in theology no now he met her
[1:30:07] read it maybe he there would have been
[1:30:08] some that he heard read it but you see
[1:30:11] remember when the Lord Jesus spoke to
[1:30:13] Mary when he called her woman she didn't
[1:30:18] know him but as soon as the
[1:30:20] characteristic within the word was
[1:30:22] spoken Mary her eyes come open and to
[1:30:28] see how the same spirit of God now
[1:30:30] coming in more power when move there and
[1:30:33] Wesley would rise under inspiration and
[1:30:36] he would proclaim because the Bible
[1:30:38] points out her fornication
[1:30:40] it's pointing out there needs to come a
[1:30:43] cleansing flow a deeper life and just
[1:30:46] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:30:49] now there is a cleansing power that
[1:30:52] comes from the blood that's able to
[1:30:55] release you and set you free this is
[1:30:58] God's working I will restore to you all
[1:31:00] the years and to think of this here it
[1:31:04] comes up a little more here's the same
[1:31:05] plant
[1:31:07] it's coming up a little bit more then
[1:31:11] here under this same characteristic
[1:31:14] under the wisdom of man the anointing of
[1:31:16] the Spirit the Holy Spirit would work in
[1:31:18] that direction and then you had find
[1:31:22] some saints of God then begin to pray
[1:31:25] and get together begin to strike their
[1:31:30] heart because they begin to see an
[1:31:32] outpouring of the Holy Ghost William
[1:31:36] Seymour some of the others that that
[1:31:39] were around some of the sisters and
[1:31:41] different ones how did they begin to
[1:31:43] witness the outpouring of the Holy
[1:31:45] Spirit you see there had been much of
[1:31:47] this had been spoke about as far as
[1:31:49] within the word the justification the
[1:31:52] sanctification but you know now once it
[1:31:55] come now to where that of Pentecost were
[1:31:57] the baptism of the Spirit and to where
[1:32:00] that gifts and healings and miracles
[1:32:02] were being done you see now there
[1:32:04] actually was a rumor that comes up and
[1:32:07] the rumor that comes up is he's alive
[1:32:13] before that time there was no rumor but
[1:32:16] now there comes up a rumor he's alive
[1:32:20] but now when we look at where where it
[1:32:24] moves to and we see that the promise
[1:32:26] here of how that there would be a return
[1:32:29] of light in this hour because remember
[1:32:32] God he he makes himself known in threes
[1:32:36] three sevens and so forth but to think
[1:32:39] that we even within threes of how that
[1:32:42] godness of perfection and now let's look
[1:32:45] here in the scripture here just for a
[1:32:46] moment in Revelations 14 continuing on
[1:32:49] in verse 9 and the third angel followed
[1:32:52] them and said with a loud voice if any
[1:32:56] man worship the Beast and His image and
[1:32:59] receive his mark in his forehead or in
[1:33:03] his hand the same shall drink of the
[1:33:07] wine of the wrath of God which is poured
[1:33:09] out without mixture into the cup of his
[1:33:12] indignation and he shall be tormented
[1:33:15] with fire and brimstone in the presence
[1:33:17] of the Holy Angels and in the
[1:33:19] presence of the Lamb and the smoke of
[1:33:21] their torment ascends it up forever and
[1:33:24] ever and they have no rest day or night
[1:33:26] whose imaged the Beast and His image
[1:33:28] whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
[1:33:31] here is the patience of the saints here
[1:33:34] are they that keep the commandments of
[1:33:36] God and the faith of Jesus so now here
[1:33:41] at the ending now we we have that aware
[1:33:44] the gifts all of that has been restored
[1:33:47] in that Pentecostal time but at the end
[1:33:52] of that day at the end of the third day
[1:33:54] this is where that it's not going to be
[1:33:58] a rumor but he would actually the Lord
[1:34:01] Jesus would make himself real to the
[1:34:06] people that I am indeed alive I'm not
[1:34:10] just alive I am the same yesterday today
[1:34:13] and forever he wouldn't let it be known
[1:34:18] in the same power same maturity I I know
[1:34:20] things have changed I know as time goes
[1:34:23] on things change but let me tell you
[1:34:25] something the power of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:27] the power of God it does not change it
[1:34:31] only becomes greater and greater and
[1:34:34] greater think about how that God would
[1:34:39] have it to where the prophet in this
[1:34:41] hour he would stand there and he would
[1:34:44] take that of Luther and he would type
[1:34:46] that with the horse and buggy horsepower
[1:34:49] right then it would move to that of the
[1:34:52] time of sanctification more horsepower
[1:34:55] the automobile right there's more power
[1:35:00] then it would come when there's more
[1:35:02] power where the gifts would be restored
[1:35:04] to where there would be an airplane they
[1:35:06] would be able to get off the ground but
[1:35:09] they can never escape the atmosphere of
[1:35:12] the earth
[1:35:14] is that right but you see God has
[1:35:18] promised in this day in this hour in his
[1:35:22] word that there is a rapture where that
[1:35:28] he himself is coming to take a bride
[1:35:31] that has been made ready by his life
[1:35:35] those who have received him have been
[1:35:39] that he has received them he is coming
[1:35:42] back in order to take his bride to where
[1:35:45] he is and it's going to take more power
[1:35:49] than just airplane power it's going to
[1:35:54] take more power than just jet fuel it
[1:35:58] takes rocket fuel it's going to be an
[1:36:01] astronaut that's able to break the
[1:36:04] atmospheres of the earth hello and
[1:36:09] that's exactly what God has done and is
[1:36:13] doing in this hour you see the power of
[1:36:16] God that is was released within this
[1:36:18] hour he will call you in justification
[1:36:21] he'll sanctify your life and he will
[1:36:24] fill you with his own life and what he
[1:36:26] does is not just a trickle but he pours
[1:36:29] the whole thing out this is the time
[1:36:34] this is the season of the seal of God
[1:36:40] the seal could not come in Luthor's day
[1:36:43] it could not come in Wesley's day it
[1:36:46] could not be kind could not come at the
[1:36:48] beginning of this last church age you
[1:36:52] with me the seal is where there is a
[1:36:55] finished work a seal expresses ownership
[1:37:01] a feel expresses security
[1:37:08] when you're given the seal like when
[1:37:11] Esther was given the seal as she would
[1:37:14] ride out what was there and then it
[1:37:16] would be sealed with the seal of king of
[1:37:19] Azeroth
[1:37:20] it had to be done or brother and sister
[1:37:24] we've not been given a title down
[1:37:27] through those other down through those
[1:37:29] other times right there but when the
[1:37:31] first angel went forth the second angel
[1:37:33] and forth remember they were still
[1:37:35] baptizing in titles in the name of the
[1:37:39] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:37:41] Ghost but he's got a name those are just
[1:37:43] titles of one person he's not three
[1:37:47] separate people that's a lot of the
[1:37:51] devil it's one one person it's God
[1:37:56] revealed in fatherhood God revealed in
[1:38:00] Christ and God in you by the Holy Ghost
[1:38:03] it's the same Lord Jesus Christ Alleluia
[1:38:09] and that revelation it breaks the hold
[1:38:13] up loanable lives we're safe in his told
[1:38:17] those lies it absolutely breaks the
[1:38:19] seals and the hold around the person's
[1:38:22] life because why you recognize there is
[1:38:25] a complete and perfect of told me that
[1:38:28] it's not three persons not two persons
[1:38:31] but it is the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:35] Christ he said in his word repent be
[1:38:41] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ God
[1:38:50] come down and walk right among us think
[1:38:56] of how his life was hear his testimony
[1:38:58] when he would even express labor not in
[1:39:02] John 6:27 labor not for the meat which
[1:39:05] perishes but for the meat which endureth
[1:39:07] unto everlasting life which the Son of
[1:39:10] man shall give unto you for him hath God
[1:39:14] the Father see
[1:39:17] his name Han come in my father's name
[1:39:24] his name is his life and his promise and
[1:39:31] his word is that he would send the Holy
[1:39:34] Ghost in his name now think of this
[1:39:40] there would have to be as we were just
[1:39:43] looking at this here our return
[1:39:47] a return of what God had delivered there
[1:39:51] straight from his hand on the day of
[1:39:55] Pentecost it would have to be a bride
[1:39:57] that would arise in this hour that would
[1:40:01] come back to being that true word bride
[1:40:05] it would be that to where he would call
[1:40:08] her out of all of the the isms and the
[1:40:11] darkness and all of the confusion that's
[1:40:14] been you understand Babylon I know
[1:40:16] there's visitors and everything here as
[1:40:17] well but you realize what Babylon is you
[1:40:19] look the word up it's simple it's
[1:40:21] confusion
[1:40:22] think about what we're living in this
[1:40:25] hour people don't even know what they
[1:40:27] are and you call that Liberty it is the
[1:40:31] product of her religion they don't know
[1:40:36] who they are and look at how that even
[1:40:40] you know the Pope would stand within
[1:40:42] this hour let me tell you something it
[1:40:43] ain't just the Pope but it's also all
[1:40:45] the daughters that are underneath it
[1:40:48] where you got men standing in the pulpit
[1:40:51] that have no business to be standing in
[1:40:53] the pulpit come on somebody they were
[1:40:56] not to be a handler of the word they've
[1:40:59] got all sorts of things that have come
[1:41:01] in there but the Bible identifies it
[1:41:03] that she is a cage full of every hateful
[1:41:07] and unclean bird you listening now look
[1:41:12] at this here with the third angel the
[1:41:14] third angel here he's calling don't go
[1:41:16] into that don't go into those systems no
[1:41:19] watch out that mark is coming don't go
[1:41:21] in there receive the seal of God he's
[1:41:24] calling on that and the same ministry
[1:41:27] now watch this here in the scripture
[1:41:29] we'll just see how far the Lord will let
[1:41:31] us go with this here but in Revelations
[1:41:35] 18 verse 1
[1:41:37] and after these things I saw another
[1:41:40] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:41:44] power and the earth was lightened with
[1:41:48] his glory another angel come down from
[1:41:53] heaven and as he come down he has great
[1:41:57] power and the earth was lightened with
[1:42:01] his glory now you know the calibre let's
[1:42:05] just read this here and he cried
[1:42:06] mightily with a strong voice saying
[1:42:08] Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen
[1:42:11] and has become the habitation of devils
[1:42:13] and the hold of every foul spirit and a
[1:42:17] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[1:42:19] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[1:42:22] of the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:42:25] kings of the earth have committed
[1:42:27] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:42:30] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[1:42:31] abundance of her delicacies and I heard
[1:42:34] another voice from heaven saying come
[1:42:36] out of her my people that you be not
[1:42:40] partakers of her sins and that you
[1:42:43] receive not of her plagues for her sins
[1:42:46] have reached unto heaven and God hath
[1:42:49] remembered her iniquities watch how the
[1:42:53] brother branham brings us together here
[1:42:54] I know this familiar ground but in the
[1:42:56] first seal he says remember them last
[1:42:58] angels those three angels we just read
[1:43:00] that the third angel come across and
[1:43:03] says come out of her my people so he's
[1:43:05] he's bringing these two together the
[1:43:06] third angels message he is also one with
[1:43:09] this message right here when that angel
[1:43:11] flies at the same time that message
[1:43:14] drops here for the last trumpet and that
[1:43:17] last message that last seal opens all
[1:43:20] happens at the same time and all seals
[1:43:23] up and goes over into eternity now think
[1:43:28] of this last things or what we're
[1:43:29] reading about right here the Bible says
[1:43:31] as we were reading here that I saw
[1:43:33] another angel come down from heaven
[1:43:36] there's already an earthly angel here
[1:43:39] but this angel comes down from heaven
[1:43:42] and this one that comes down from heaven
[1:43:45] having great power this is not just you
[1:43:48] know horse and buggy power this is not
[1:43:51] just automobile power this is not just
[1:43:54] airplane power this is coming with
[1:43:58] rocket fuel
[1:44:00] amen this is coming with the full power
[1:44:04] of God that's able to bring that of the
[1:44:08] people of God that have been mixed up in
[1:44:10] this confusion now to think about it
[1:44:13] when here mixed up in this confusion
[1:44:15] people have been looking for churches
[1:44:17] been wondering what's right and here's
[1:44:19] this ride and do I believe this and
[1:44:21] which ones right how many different
[1:44:23] churches are there thousands I lost
[1:44:28] count
[1:44:30] but there's got to be one because the
[1:44:36] Lord Jesus he firmly declared it in the
[1:44:40] scripture in Matthew 16 that upon this
[1:44:42] rock I will build my church and the
[1:44:46] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[1:44:50] it
[1:44:50] so he himself was declaring he has a
[1:44:54] church and he's the one that's the
[1:44:57] builder of it there's not a man that
[1:44:59] built that church who would it be to God
[1:45:02] so to think the hound that this angel
[1:45:05] coming down having great power and the
[1:45:08] earth was lightened with his glory now
[1:45:10] when we look at this and to see that
[1:45:12] that great that great power that's the
[1:45:15] Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost here it's
[1:45:19] he's that light that lightens the earth
[1:45:20] and what's he doing he being the chief
[1:45:24] eagle he's calling out all the eaglets
[1:45:31] come out of her my people you know how
[1:45:36] it is I mean my wife calls my name I
[1:45:41] know who called my name when I was
[1:45:44] younger my daddy would call my name or
[1:45:47] my mom I knew their voice but you know
[1:45:51] even in that right there there might
[1:45:53] have been somebody else who had a
[1:45:54] similar voice to them but you see this
[1:45:58] right here it is something that rings so
[1:46:03] clear and so deep within the heart like
[1:46:06] it did that day where he the Lord Jesus
[1:46:09] was standing there and he calls Mary
[1:46:11] woman but when he says Mary that
[1:46:14] releases it right there and that's the
[1:46:18] same way when his voice speaks when the
[1:46:20] Spirit of Truth its calls out your name
[1:46:23] it deals with your life in a personal
[1:46:26] way I don't care how much theology I
[1:46:28] don't care how much sin I don't care
[1:46:30] what is trying to wrap you up but when
[1:46:32] that voice itself speaks to you there is
[1:46:35] a power in that voice that's able to
[1:46:38] draw you
[1:46:39] as you submit to it it'll take you from
[1:46:42] where you are to where you need to be it
[1:46:45] will place you in the body of Jesus
[1:46:48] Christ where he always knew you I wish I
[1:46:55] had a louder voice it exposes what's
[1:47:01] going on it lightens the whole earth you
[1:47:06] know what happens when you light things
[1:47:07] up you see things you see things that
[1:47:12] you normally didn't see y'all been
[1:47:16] walking through the house kids left out
[1:47:19] toys on the floor you thought you knew
[1:47:20] where you were going and you step on it
[1:47:23] you wish at that time boy I wish I had a
[1:47:26] light just I wish I just cut the light
[1:47:28] on but you see now here here is the
[1:47:31] promise within this hour and how that
[1:47:34] the Scriptures have declared that the
[1:47:37] coming of the Son of Man I don't have
[1:47:38] time to read it but the coming of the
[1:47:40] Son of Man would be as that as the
[1:47:42] lightning and that of lightning that
[1:47:44] lighteth the the sky from the east unto
[1:47:47] the west
[1:47:49] that's the coming of the Son of Man a
[1:47:52] man to recognize that in this hour when
[1:47:55] we think of that in those terms the son
[1:47:57] of man it's not just coming in a small
[1:48:00] portion but it is Christ Himself coming
[1:48:03] in the fullness of his portion the
[1:48:06] fullness of his life the fullness of his
[1:48:09] nature why because there is a bride upon
[1:48:12] the earth there is that which he is
[1:48:15] coming there to claim as his own and to
[1:48:17] fake his life with in this hour
[1:48:20] poured out upon the Church of the Living
[1:48:22] God to reflect himself the same that he
[1:48:26] was when he was here as in groom form he
[1:48:29] now reflects and manifests himself in
[1:48:32] Bradford
[1:48:35] the world is headed for a climax
[1:48:41] everybody senses it that's why the
[1:48:45] neurotic conditions that's why people
[1:48:50] are more appeal to get up peel to go to
[1:48:53] bed peel to live what it is these
[1:48:58] are conditioned
[1:49:00] you know the animals know when there's
[1:49:01] things going on the animals know when
[1:49:05] there's going to be an earthquake they
[1:49:07] know how to gather themselves there's
[1:49:09] certain things when you look at animals
[1:49:11] you know I hunt a little bit I don't
[1:49:13] claim to be a great hunter but I know
[1:49:15] when there's certain pressures coming in
[1:49:17] and there's a change in air pressure
[1:49:19] coming and there may be is a change in a
[1:49:21] weather front I know you get out before
[1:49:24] the front comes in or you get out as
[1:49:26] soon as the front is passed why the
[1:49:28] animals will move
[1:49:31] you and I don't feel I mean sometimes
[1:49:33] when you have sinuses you feel different
[1:49:35] pressure but we don't feel that like
[1:49:37] they do but they move and they respond
[1:49:40] upon that I'll tell you a brother and
[1:49:42] sister that's exactly the way this world
[1:49:45] is right now it's sense it sits in a
[1:49:48] nervous condition it's in an erotic
[1:49:51] state they realize the end is heading up
[1:49:54] but yet they don't understand they don't
[1:49:56] know all of these things but to look
[1:49:58] within this hour that God would
[1:50:01] illuminate he was sent for the light of
[1:50:03] his word that you and I might be able to
[1:50:06] see and listen it is just something
[1:50:08] that's exclusive if there's something
[1:50:10] tugging in your heart near this morning
[1:50:11] you might have looked at churches and
[1:50:13] everything else but yet there's
[1:50:15] something that pulls and deals with your
[1:50:18] heart that there is something more than
[1:50:20] what I have right now there's more from
[1:50:23] my life there's great there's something
[1:50:25] greater than just being a part of a
[1:50:28] church it's to be one with the Lord
[1:50:31] Jesus Omaha let me just try to wrap this
[1:50:36] up here there's no way to move through
[1:50:39] it all but to think this angel this
[1:50:43] angel here in Revelations 18 it comes to
[1:50:46] the earth he comes to bring light and he
[1:50:50] shines that light around the world it's
[1:50:52] a mighty angel he comes to proclaim a
[1:50:55] message he comes to call people out of
[1:50:58] that condition that condition that we
[1:51:01] read about we're such confusion
[1:51:05] not knowing if goddess is a
[1:51:07] one-two-three but then look at the
[1:51:10] confusion look at the confusion to where
[1:51:15] it stands within this hour to where even
[1:51:17] a man
[1:51:19] I think it was you know was that Pope
[1:51:22] Francis said here you know just a even
[1:51:25] just a few years ago
[1:51:26] well there's even room in the Church of
[1:51:27] the Living God for infidels
[1:51:31] pray theist how in the world do 10 an
[1:51:35] atheist be in the Church of other than
[1:51:37] God you see what it is it's about
[1:51:41] conquering it's about conquering and it
[1:51:46] conquers all the religions all the
[1:51:51] religions invites them all in and you
[1:51:57] know it's the kind of the spirit that
[1:51:59] moves behind it is that it no matter
[1:52:01] what kind of life you live but as long
[1:52:04] you know as you just stayed with the
[1:52:06] church as long as you just say you know
[1:52:08] that Jesus is your Savior as long as you
[1:52:12] just look to the church for your
[1:52:13] salvation you won the church that died
[1:52:15] for us then won the church that got up
[1:52:18] on an Easter morning you see what that
[1:52:20] lion does it keeps people in bondage
[1:52:24] amen but the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:52:27] great angel the Holy Ghost loosed among
[1:52:31] the church in this hour it lets you and
[1:52:34] I know that there is Liberty it reaches
[1:52:38] out to the heart every Eagle of God that
[1:52:41] is setting around it reaches out to them
[1:52:43] that even when they might be in such a
[1:52:45] low and abound condition but there's
[1:52:48] something that resonates in there that I
[1:52:50] know I can be free why because there's a
[1:52:55] longing if there's a longing to be free
[1:52:57] there's a place where you can be free
[1:53:03] that great danger of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:06] moving throughout this earth and I think
[1:53:11] of this how that moving in such a manner
[1:53:15] bringing everything together brother
[1:53:18] Branham says it like this and I'm
[1:53:20] closing
[1:53:22] when this voice that was on the earth
[1:53:27] when it sounded come out of her when
[1:53:32] this voice was sounding remember there
[1:53:35] was a voice that echoed in heaven and
[1:53:38] that voice echoed in heaven was that a
[1:53:41] verse for where we had read or bear in
[1:53:43] Revelations 18 and notice mudram says it
[1:53:46] like this I love this statement he says
[1:53:48] this messenger on the earth talking
[1:53:51] about that earthly messenger was so
[1:53:54] inclined with God until when he spoke it
[1:53:58] on the earth God echoed the same thing
[1:54:01] out of heaven he was so inclined with
[1:54:06] God to God echoed it in the heaven what
[1:54:09] a harmony that was there who is it that
[1:54:12] brought that harmony with the seventh
[1:54:15] angel the same Holy Spirit that moved
[1:54:19] upon Luther that moved upon Wesley that
[1:54:22] moved there for the restoration of the
[1:54:24] gifts it's the same Holy Spirit moving
[1:54:27] now in a greater power in a greater
[1:54:30] measure what's he doing he's bringing
[1:54:32] all things in life to where the word
[1:54:34] itself that was expressed this messenger
[1:54:38] this that was given was so in line to
[1:54:41] heaven echoed it why because it was not
[1:54:47] a voice of the earth though that voice
[1:54:50] is is clothed or or borrowed that of an
[1:54:53] earthly voice to speak through but it is
[1:54:56] not the earthly voice that were attached
[1:54:58] to come on somebody because the earthly
[1:55:02] voice listen to me the earthly voice is
[1:55:05] a voice that God's voice the voice of
[1:55:07] God spoke through is there not and it is
[1:55:12] that spirit of truth that you and I
[1:55:14] would be tuned in to because we could
[1:55:17] hear we could hear a natural voice we
[1:55:19] could hear it all day long but you know
[1:55:21] friends if all that you can hear is that
[1:55:23] of the prophets voice and you cannot
[1:55:26] hear the same Holy Ghost speaking and
[1:55:28] dealing with your heart oh my I'm afraid
[1:55:31] you need to ask God open my ears
[1:55:34] or because you are the same Lord God
[1:55:36] you've never we can give never diminish
[1:55:39] but the word that God has given in this
[1:55:41] hour that same Holy Ghost is right here
[1:55:44] among us
[1:55:56] I think of this a heart I'm just gonna
[1:55:58] stop at that point
[1:56:03] but with this
[1:56:06] the angel of the Lord moving down here
[1:56:16] we were like Eagles
[1:56:19] trapped in the barnyard
[1:56:24] we saw chickens we talked like chickens
[1:56:30] but you see we had been told about
[1:56:33] Eagles but we needed something more than
[1:56:37] just somebody telling us about an eagle
[1:56:38] we needed to see an eagle seeing what an
[1:56:44] eagle look like that changes it had been
[1:56:52] talked about with Eagles but now here
[1:56:54] comes great momma eagle flying over she
[1:57:00] flies over the barnyard and she begins
[1:57:03] to scream out come out of her something
[1:57:09] grabs ahold of that little Eagles heart
[1:57:13] he sees that image that living image
[1:57:17] above him he can't explain it but it's
[1:57:22] something that just you know it just
[1:57:24] resonates in here that's what I want to
[1:57:29] be no doubt his life was full of
[1:57:33] confusion he could not figure out why
[1:57:35] did he not get the same joy out of
[1:57:37] eating bugs and worms that the rest of
[1:57:39] them did
[1:57:41] he couldn't figure that out what's wrong
[1:57:44] with me but in that day when that living
[1:57:49] image swooped over it took ahold of his
[1:57:52] life what was it it was that great angel
[1:57:55] with great power and glory it swooped
[1:58:00] over there and the darkness that was
[1:58:03] around about his life then it gained an
[1:58:05] echo
[1:58:07] come on I can't yes you can spread your
[1:58:13] wings but I can't they they told me I
[1:58:17] can but I'm telling you you can you see
[1:58:20] they didn't know how to speak to Eagles
[1:58:23] it took one it was an eagle that knew
[1:58:26] how to talk to Eagles hallelujah he came
[1:58:31] there in the barnyard he flew over there
[1:58:33] he lightened up that barnyard and all of
[1:58:36] a sudden that little one he just say he
[1:58:38] made a jump he jumped up on a post but
[1:58:40] that great Eagle was going on it's a now
[1:58:43] you're on the post come on now you're
[1:58:45] not out of there all the way you've got
[1:58:47] wings that you were born with you did
[1:58:49] not know those potentials lay there
[1:58:51] within your life
[1:58:52] you wondered why you look different why
[1:58:54] you were strange why you were laughter
[1:58:57] you wonder what was different about your
[1:58:59] life I have come to tell you the mystery
[1:59:02] about your life why you're so different
[1:59:06] why you're so odd and you know what it
[1:59:08] is something that is overriding
[1:59:11] everything that he's ever been taught it
[1:59:15] is overriding everything that has been
[1:59:18] crammed into him and telling him you
[1:59:20] can't do this the days of miracles has
[1:59:22] passed and all these things it is
[1:59:24] overriding all those other voices why
[1:59:27] this is the voice of the one that knew
[1:59:31] that he was an eagle and when that voice
[1:59:34] rises there on the scene within a lot it
[1:59:37] cancels out all the other voices that
[1:59:43] little Eagle rose up he always was an
[1:59:45] eagle he always was an eagle
[1:59:49] and he rises up in that rushing mighty
[1:59:54] wind he gets them feathers those wings
[1:59:59] they're probable as a dust storm came in
[2:00:01] there and that barnyard
[2:00:05] no don't dummies turn up this dust
[2:00:07] around here but it's something about it
[2:00:10] is he's he's getting loose he's
[2:00:11] recognizing what the voice is telling
[2:00:14] him it's true he's seeing it in his own
[2:00:18] life he's looking at my wings look like
[2:00:21] her wings hallelujah my feet look like
[2:00:25] her feet come on somebody what's he
[2:00:27] doing he's seeing the image that is
[2:00:30] above him and he recognizes that is me
[2:00:34] that is my mother that's calling me
[2:00:40] [Applause]
[2:00:41] that's what God has done and is doing in
[2:00:46] this hour
[2:00:47] and then that life moves within you
[2:00:51] goodbye Barnea heart appreciated to
[2:00:57] fellowship with the chickens while I was
[2:00:58] there but good Bob is there maybe for
[2:01:00] you but it's just not for me I never
[2:01:02] could digest that stuff but it's
[2:01:05] something about it that oh my he's got a
[2:01:07] taste of that fresh meat and as he began
[2:01:10] to eat that meat that meat that was
[2:01:12] coming down it was spiritual food that
[2:01:14] was in due season it was actually giving
[2:01:17] him strength to be able to spread his
[2:01:19] wings he was receiving divine energy
[2:01:23] how was he getting that divine energy
[2:01:25] from the great power that was being
[2:01:27] released hallelujah he was receiving
[2:01:31] energy to wear that he could have a lift
[2:01:34] off let me tell you brother and sister
[2:01:39] that's exactly what God has done in our
[2:01:44] lives
[2:01:49] you and I Hey the messenger came in line
[2:01:53] you and I were out of line
[2:01:55] you and I were out of line but the angel
[2:01:59] of the Lord came and sought us out
[2:02:02] he came and sought us out and dealt with
[2:02:04] our hearts I would say it like this this
[2:02:11] morning and I'm closing there's just no
[2:02:15] way to cover all that but I would say it
[2:02:18] this I would say this morning this is
[2:02:21] God's desire for each and every one of
[2:02:24] us this is this is God's heart for every
[2:02:28] one of us to wear that same power is
[2:02:36] working moving within our lives
[2:02:40] lifting us
[2:02:43] it lifts you out of sin it lifts you out
[2:02:46] of holes upon your life you might be
[2:02:50] sitting here this morning in your life
[2:02:52] you think what in the world would he
[2:02:54] even want to do with me
[2:02:56] hey listen he looks beyond all your
[2:02:59] problems and all of your bondage that
[2:03:02] you're in right now and he's the one to
[2:03:04] set you free no matter what that need is
[2:03:10] within your life he's the same yesterday
[2:03:12] today and forever if you don't know him
[2:03:17] this morning you can know him you can
[2:03:21] know him not just to believe on him but
[2:03:25] you can know him in the cleansing power
[2:03:27] and in the fullness of the baptism of
[2:03:31] the Holy Ghost where it changes your
[2:03:34] life completely he's the same yesterday
[2:03:40] today and forever and I say what an
[2:03:44] Easter that was but what an Easter this
