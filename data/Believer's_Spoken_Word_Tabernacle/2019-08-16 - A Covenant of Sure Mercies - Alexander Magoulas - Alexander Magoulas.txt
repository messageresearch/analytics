[Music] [Music] I will dance I will dance I will win the spirit [Music] I will [Music] [Applause] whoa yes whoa repeated god amen I tell you what I'll tell you what the world sings in the world dances and they don't even have a reason to but they even had a reason and then the word was being restored the ark was coming back to Jerusalem he had a reason to dance amen you got a reason this morning got a reason huh amen whew amens there got a reason to say Amen this morning got a reason to sing praise the Lord Amen God's been good to us praise the Lord I tell you what he was just feeling good I guess I hope you feel good I come into church and I just felt great didn't have to pop a pill hey man didn't have to shoot up didn't have to go to psychologist I did have a little bit of coffee that's okay I think praise the Lord we sure appreciate you all we want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know I was at the youth camp there was rather browning a few weeks ago gotta see him minister the morning and I know he's not here so I can get away with give him a rose but but just what a tremendous ministry and job and we just you know I just really appreciate his burden for the young people in his ministry and I can get behind something like that and I hope you all can too I feel like that's what we're all about here since a common spirit amen so how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity well praise the Lord I get to talk like this I'll just have you on your feet all 45 minutes and you'll be like man we've been staying for 45 minutes you know like I'm gonna have to anyway or longer so if you have your Bibles this morning I won't I will try to keep you on your feet too much longer but we're going to turn to the Book of Isaiah the 55th chapter and I was looking to maybe go a different direction with the service and I was praying this scripture came to me and I was trying to figure what this is about and I forgot I didn't do this on purpose but the last time ministered here I believe I took this very same scripture and it's a different text I'm not preaching the same sermon everybody shut down on me now so I was gonna preach the same one it's actually a different sermon I think I mentioned that there's a whole nother thought here and so I didn't realize that I'm like oh praise the Lord I was looking this morning what I preached last time that's what that's about so we're gonna take this same scripture but I have a different thought this morning and we just pray the Lord blessed T and the Holy Spirit take it out to the people Isaiah the 55th chapter here and the scripture says in the first verse it says hello everyone that thirst if come you to the waters and he that hath no money come he buy and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money and without prize wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfies not hearken diligently unto me an ET that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and a commander to the people now last time we talked about the character of David as a leader this fourth verse but I want to come back here this third verse and tie it in this morning read it once more it says incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of David I like to take that as a thought a covenant of sure mercies but before I before we Minister this morning I just want to go ahead and bow our heads for a word of Prayer and look to the author of this scripture our gracious Heavenly Father it was you that exhorted us just now in this scripture to incline our ears to you to hear and our souls would live father many people they they've studied this Bible perhaps and maybe they've even heard the word of God maybe they've sat in church for years but what we want to Incline we want to lean towards that word right now I believe whichever way the tree leans is the way the tree falls and so Lord we just want plying ourselves right now to hearken diligently as the scripture says to hearken diligently unto your word lord may we not be slothful but diligent of those who are partakers by faith and patience partaking the promises Lord we want that kind of a testimony this morning we want to be the one that we could that you can look at say that is my my son or daughter that is hearken diligently unto my voice father I pray you just take this word which has been read now be enlightener I hate his father and give understanding to us Lord may it be so sweet in our my own father even though it be bitter in the belly may be sweeten our mouth and enlighten our eyes even there's that honey enlighten to Jonathan's eyes when an army was an hungered Lord pray you to come and satisfy our hungry souls give us that drink that that we would never thirst again Lord if there be one here today Lord that don't know you that way if there be one here today Lord that sinned against your father each of us Lord we're having a need this morning Lord just forgive us where we've sinned where we've let you down Lord we we back son maybe a thousand times a day we we need your grace we need to come to sure mercies Oh mercies that don't waver or falter but we need your mercy today just as much if not more than we've ever needed it before father we need that assurance I pray you'd come strengthen establish and settle your people this morning may you bless them I pray father know what said and done and he received great glory and honor on this and do that which only you can do we pray for we ask it in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the bride says Amen god bless yous you're seated amen praise the Lord a covenant of short mercies as a thought this morning when the Apostle Paul and his company there they're going about on a missionary trip there and they they depart from purga you can read about in the book of Acts the thirteenth chapter and I'm just going to read to you here in a moment but they they depart from purga and they return to Antioch and the Apostle Paul he begins to minister in a synagogue there and he says this in acts 13 and the 17th verses says the god of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with an hi arm brought he them out of it and about the time of 40 years suffered he their manners nice people say God don't care about whether he got manners or not but he suffered their manners they meant well I just thought I'd drop it in there quick amen listen everything God did for them they complained about who they complained about to Moses complain to each other they murmur and complain they mad you say what's that got to do with me we got to be careful we don't murmur and complain against each other man cuz how you treat each others how you treat the Lord so he suffered their manners their bad manners is all right forty years he suffered there man pretty good though suffered healer managed in the wilderness and when he had destroyed seven nations in the line of canaan he divided their land to them by a lot and after that he came unto them he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet and afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them saw the son of Kish a man of this tribe of Benjamin by the space of forty years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said I like this testimony I want this kind of testimony he gave testimony of testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will of this man's seed of God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus now I'm just gonna skip down for the sake of time the thirty third verse thirty third verse says God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children and that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second Psalm thou art my son this day have I begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption in other words the evidence or the proof of this that he doesn't return to corruption he said on this wise I will give you the sure mercies of David what we read in our opening tax amen so God has made promised that David would have a covenant or make it he would make a covenant of sure mercies is an everlasting covenant amen and he's gonna give this to David now I want you to think about this and I'm gonna take the stop for just a few moments here because David had been anointed by the prophet Samuel to become the king of is our from the time he'd been just a teenager hey man he's just a young man brother BAM says maybe 14 years old and so this young man he's anointed in the midst of his brother to become the next king but he does not inherit the throne automatically or instantly amen but this boy and then later a man that's gonna one day become king he spent many years as a ragtag been to Gentile warriors he trains them they're the best of the best and he's he's slaying lines now they're slaying lines he's slaying Giants they're slaying Giants amen they they come under him and but I want you understand that he and his men they wanted his vagabonds four years raiding the camps of the enemy raiding the Philistines from day to day why because King Saul was out to kill David amen to be a king look like a king for quite a spell a man actually looked like a fugitive a renegade er an outcast and I want you to see that David had fought for Saul amen he'd come and played music for me taking an evil spirit off and then he was tormented by evil spirits he'd been a friend to his son Jonathan amen the Bible says their souls were knit together the love that they had between was so great he'd been a friend to his son he'd fought his battles for him he played his music David had been faithful in every way now I want you to catch this now David had not tried to take anything from saw he wasn't trying to promote himself he'd been faithful he stood behind Saul in every way possibly man and yet when he and yeah at the end of it all Saul's looking to take his life hey man he done every kindness to him and been kind to him and he repaid him with trying to take his life you were painting with a spirit of murder and when Saul couldn't kill him on his own he got his whole church amen you got a whole arm he said we're gonna go after this guy and we're gonna run down cuz he's trying to now I want you notice he's got the whole army going after David he's on the run and he fusion and yet David encounters them a man you're familiar with this David encounters him in the Lotus in a cave one night and david has an opportunity he has an opportunity just slay this man saw and yet he doesn't take it because he understands that the same God that anointed him to be a king I know did this man and I was not for David to remove him brother Ram says this and respects he says if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in God that's exactly right so you respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him he said I've heard congregations talk about their pastor just how they talk about him running down ridicule him how is that pasture ever gonna do anything for you what he says he can't do it you don't he says I don't say this Church and I'm not saying this church either he says I don't say this Church but I mean churches I have seen he says you've got to love your pastor you've got to know he's a human being well yet God has made him the pastor the Holy Spirit has made him the overseer then you've got to respect him in that manner and no matter what the pastor's done oh my he said we need to shake my hand no matter what the pastor's done if you respect him in your heart as God's ever God will respect you now notice he's not saying if he does the right thing but even if he does the wrong thing if you respect him God will respect you for that hey man praise the Lord that's true listen I said this one time I was preaching somewhere I said sometimes God well let your pastor may be able to note your pastor to say or do a certain they doesn't have to be a pastor could be a minister whoever may be a deacon but he'll anoint that man or he'll allow them to say or do something just a little contrary to what you think and sometimes God will allow that cuz he's wanting to see how you're gonna react you know puffed up and say well I got rights oh I know better than him or can you respect that man's office and then because God is not looking to see how much smarter d-do you are than the next guy a matter how much were qualified you are he's wanted to see how you respond to Authority amen hey man praise the Lord it's like I was talking about here I was really young you read the Book of Jeremiah in the 35th chapter the Prophet Jeremiah he goes to the sons are at Kabul when he's at the with the sons of her cob God tells him I won't you sit down and offer these guys wine to drink so the Prophet Jeremiah offers them wine to drink out of these cups and they said not so we won't do this he said we've not drank wine since our forefather Rick hop command it's not to do this we've knocked one of the houses but we wandered in tents because our grandfather commanded us to do this and God says I want you to look at this I've spoken to my children day and night and they've not hearken unto me but these men they pursue their natural father I mean God blessed them with an everlasting lineage because they had respect for that man Amen praise the Lord so I want you to notice this because they respected that man listen it wasn't that necessarily what they were doing was right or wrong but their daddy gave him a command and they had enough respect for that man as their father that God blessed him a man prays alone see listen it's like this is where I'm coming to King Saul he had a position and he was alright with having Authority but when the prophet Samuel comes to him hey man the man that anointed him to be king the man that legitimize his claim as a king that anointed him when that man comes in with an ordinance from the Lord he didn't respect that man's Authority he didn't respect the words the Lord came to him he men and so what happens he makes himself Ian but I want you understand the very profit legitimate him he's he's hot on a said he is made of disobedient to the word by that prophet and in doing so he made himself the enemy of God and then what would it be today if I come up here and I preached this message and I claimed to believe this message and I'm criticizing the Prophet well he did this wrong and he did that wrong and he said this and I'm up here doing that I'm actually destroying my own authority I'm undermining my own ministry man then if studium preached what this message has done in their life and they make great claim they come out and say well there's nothing to it and a prophet me mistakes and a prophet this and a prophet that where does that leave them hey man see they've actually undermined the very thing that God give them hey man praise the Lord it doesn't do us any good to go around tell people that we believe on the authority of Scripture we're not gonna obey the word ourselves hey man listen we can't tell our children you respect others respect the authority if we won't do it ourselves hey man we're Tehran and model disrespect towards other people we say we believe in a fivefold ministry but we won't sit under a pastor hey man when we torch them they go to church but we don't go with him brother Branson a sin hey man he says it's absolutely a sin not what he said he said it's a sin to send your children son in school go with them and then listen well we all want our kids to go to church but people don't want to go to church themselves and then they wonder why the kids don't go hey man listen you've got to you've got to show you believe this thing because what happens after a while people looking saying you don't believe this if you don't respect this word why would I respect what you have to say about it he gives an example he said he was reading a little editorial cartoon one day and he said there's this this dad he'd been up drinking the night before and he's passed out Sunday morning with all these beer cans laying around him and the son he's got a little nine-year-old boy I think it was or whatever come up and he was just up for church got all cleaned up said who's gonna take me to church who's gonna take me to Sunday school and here that daddy's passed out with all these cans on them now we probably don't have a lot of believers with a bunch of beer cans around but we've got other kinds of cans hey man that keep us from serving God well listen we can go to the ballgame we can go to work and we can show up on time for work and then we can watch the movie or stare at a video game or do whatever for hours but we can't seem to make you to church amen we can't seem to find time to pray like you used to we can't seem to find time to serve the Lord or read our Bibles listen if you can do all those things you can find time to serve God I mean if you got breath in your body to complain and murmur and fuss and fight you've got breath in your body to praise God you've got breath in your body to confess the word hey man praise the Lord some money here's daddy passed out all these cans around he can do this and he can do that he can do this but he can't serve God amen like I said if we're not serious about the word why would somebody take you seriously about it amen I mean think about this even Saul's son Jonathan amen I was just talking about when I was praying but even Saul's son Jonathan he comes back and he finds some honey and he begins to eat this honey and they said you don't know you don't know the Kings give it a commandment the Kings made a commandment you're not supposed to eat we're on a fast right now and watch what Jonathan says about his own daddy he says that he's the one that's hurt the land he's almost done toys in my father's trouble the land look at my eyes how they're enlightened by this little bit of honey he says and how much more if the people could eat freely of the spoil see he's even lost respect for his own daddy now who's the king amen now listen Jonathan's a good man he's a godly man he was a real friend of David but he perished with Saul and that battle is that right why because the Bible said if you honor your father and your mother your days will be long on the earth amen so listen even though what he said was right he was wrong and saying it because that man had an office got it annoying that man to be a king but David the scripture tells us he behaved himself wisely hey man that's what we not to do is that right when we have a disagreement with somebody or maybe we just don't see eye to eye or maybe we got questions about the word even or whatever it is we ought to behave ourselves wisely and many David behave himself wisely in the presence all to where Saul himself recognized it hey man praise the Lord I listen I'm coming doesn't mean David has to be one Amen because he respects the office the scripture tells us four times like I said that he behaved himself but listen this is a so David he's running from Saul because he knows he's gonna be a king one day but yet there's a song on his way and I wonder how many times how many times are we like David maybe they was laying out there in the stunts of the stars one night and he began to wonder to himself what am I gonna be a king have I made a mistake somewhere how about let God down hey man listen it wasn't a day or a week but years past been anointed he knew even called and yet he's sitting there waiting for it to come to pass this he's got a man chase him trying to hunt him down amen don't want no doubt many times he begin to question within himself have I missed something that I missed the calling of God did I make a mistake somewhere God really speak to me hey man you ever gotta have to God show you something and there's a salat comes anyway listen Saul got in David's way listen it wasn't because David was a threat to the kingdom of Israel it wasn't because David was a bad man is because Saul was jealous of David that's why he was in his way amen unless is sometimes the spirit of rise up and come against you but listen just because Saul coming against you doesn't change the fact that you're called to be a king you're called to be a priest let's call you in the purpose hey man listen saw this he was tormented by an evil spirit a man it played on his vanity it played on his insecurities and it played on his pride not because he was going to make him say he had already failed as a king he'd already made himself the enemy of God and that's why he finds himself in this position amen so he should have stepped down he should have moved out of the way and let David fight let David take over but his pride wouldn't let him and his insecurities wouldn't let him we've got to be careful that we're not trying to get in somebody's way just because we think we could do it better we've got a better idea about it but we've got to acknowledge what God has done amen praise the Lord amen listen we fight so hard sometimes to destroy our enemies you don't have to defeat anybody hey man listen your enemies already defeated Satan he's defeated but this is your biggest enemy today's this flesh you're walking around in if you can never get mastery over this guy it doesn't matter how many souls rise up it doesn't matter how many Philistines rise up you've got the mastery over you've been called to be a victorious King you've been called to be a priest and then it's not your job to worry about what your calling you through this card you you work out your own calling you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling Amen listen David who wanted he'd been a man of war the Bible says he'd been a man of war for years he'd become accustomed to it from the time he was a little boy he flasks your life he's wandering around he's fighting in the desert fighting enemies hey man and finally saw parishes listen he didn't have to kill so so I pushed because he was the enemy of God God took him off the scene he took Jonathan off the scene and Dave becomes a king hey man and he rises up and he who finds his position a man hopefully we got some sons and daughters of God here that found their position hey man hopefully it's not just something you're looking for hopefully you know what you're called to do amen praise the Lord now listen heaping they were accustomed to honoring he'd been used to fleeing he dwelt in tents he'd lived in caves but he finally he becomes a king and something remarkable happens during the time he's a king Israel finds peace from and rest from all its enemies amen hey man praise the Lord listen they've got so much in his life I think that's pretty good I believe in making so completely serve God till the devil don't know what to do with him you know it seemed like some Christians are I'm not picking how a man but seems like some Christians they're always just getting beat up and they're always just fussing and they're always just toiling there they're wonderful gonna have rest they're ever gonna have peace we're gonna get victory but listen the Bible says he's giving us a rest he's giving us our victory this is our victory that overcomes the world even our faith I meant to make Christians trying to find victory he's got the victory hey man they're waiting for power you got power fugitives your kings your queens we're not waiting for victories victories now if you can't get victory today wouldn't you get it let me ask you when are you gonna start getting victory I'm preaching to somebody now somebody getting quiet amen you ought to get a shout there'll be a shot of the king in the camp he got victory there ought to be a shot not a bunch of rebel ready remember carrying on the mastery over the enemy in the camp we let out a war cry our enemies defeated [Music] [Music] look at the victories god bless him with time after time after time listen he was untouchable as long as he had a promise that he was going to be a king that devil couldn't come near him I wonder how many Spears whizzed around his head that were thrown at him just like we saw through that job and how many arrows passed by him you're looking at man like George Washington but I'm preaching about George Washington here's a man that he wasn't hiding the tent somewhere waiting for somebody else to fight his battles come on come ask somebody he wouldn't wait for somebody else the victory never touched him in his life he was for a nation it's gonna be destroyed one day I tell you what some believers put so much work into trying to save America problem told you she's done for put that much effort in your home your kids we get to save you put that much time in prayers you campaign it for somebody maybe somebody gets saved at your church maybe you get some praise our lord we get so political minded a man look we're not supposed to be of this world we're in this war now listen you want to vote for lower taxes I get that that's fine and I'm not against that but we get so we get so worked up about politics and who's gonna be charging who we're gonna vote for him and receive the kingdom that cannot be moved so why are you worried about it coming got to call me don't have recessions hey man you gotta come he don't go up one day and down the next he owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills you know brother been talking about the Burnham terminal he said they took a loan out in the middle of the depression for that time when they paid it off tell me God can't make away tell me god he's limited a man he can make away not just when everything's booming and everything's going well listen girl with blessed stay there when he was in the midst of being a fugitive when he was runnin how much more when he's a king now they've got rest from every enemy the kingdom is something that hasn't happened for years they've been through the time of the judges by jebbie sites in Pharaoh's ayats and Philistines amen but this Kings got so much victory nobody wants to fight him I feel pretty good

have to remind not every day hey you're on are you gonna do this thing you just think God you just begin to praise God and then you don't have to nag the devil like some women in huh well now I'm not trying to be mean but why does a person one day not you because they're not in the position to tell you what to do that's why you're not why are you nagging the devil day after day you leave me alone leave me you know what Jesus what the word said and he departed I must tell him to go you're the king you can have a rest well you can have rest from all your enemies in this life problem what I'm saying is you can be the master where the babe said a man in faith here the faith is the master of every circumstance and Manny says that the fundamental foundation reverses man was created to be a master of every circumstance and then every circumstance sickness comes and you can start sickness in the face say you're not greater than the one that's in me you got unpaid bills coming and you got your dollars in the bank we say you know what this bill is not greater than my father he owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills you know trouble Church and many somebody don't like him you say you know what God approves me he called me accepted he called me blameless maybe your neighbor don't like heat you love them anyhow because the greater is He that's in you well praise the Lord David he's sitting there one day on his throne he's got a nice big fancy house kinda like this got big old sea during this night like man this is great hey I got one of $25 tents from Walmart I tell you what that wasn't fun sleeping in that back pain and this and that I got a house God give him a house he'd give him a palace a house is seated The Cedars are left on the best citizen again Tina's got his big old house there's oh he got his cabin out in the woods and he's just oh man ice what I've been dreaming of listen he's wanted for years he's gonna tack for years he stared the Stars for years but now he's got a house inside David Amen I love having a house I got a lazy boy kick my feet up didn't have that in the wilderness now air conditioning whoo praise God for air conditioning I tell you I wouldn't Kerry was a Christian brother brand was waiting to shake her I of the Hittites ham there in heaven I want to meet William Carey the man they've been in the air conditioning god bless you hey man praise the Lord I'm just so thankful man it's so much better some of y'all like camping how many likes camping I don't I like living in the house amen that's okay every now and then I get that that's fine but I wouldn't want to live that way this lived this way for years I mean father gets a house he's like this is great I've got a house inside Davises I have a house God doesn't have a house all these years since the time of Moses he's wandering around the tent like I did and a house is better than attack something big is the stern side he wants to build a house for the Lord he says you know what there's something in me now listen Moses didn't tell him to build a house for the Lord amen Nathan didn't tell him to build a house for the Lord he got permission they remember he didn't give him this idea see we didn't give this idea something and Ava's alive Amen God putting inspirations his life we said you know huh I want to build a house for God no man ever told them that and yet God said that's exactly right I want a house I'm gonna let your son Solomon build me a house hey man praise the Lord I'm gonna let him do me huh now listen he's got a better idea that he he actually has a greater glory or a greater habitation I'm coming to hear just a little bit a man but he says you know what I never told you here sweetie is what he says he says I've never told you I want a house but I want one I've been house shopping for years looking for the right kind of habitation and here's a man by the name of David and there's something in his heart says I want to build a house for the Lord hey man the scripture says this in 2nd Samuel 7 11 and I since the time that I committed judges to be over my people Israel and if caused the arrest of all I am he's also the Lord tell thee he will make the in house and when that day's be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with my father's I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for now my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever amen go down to verse 16 again ah the the house and my kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy throne shall be established forever so God is making a covenant we read about in the opening scripture he's making a covenant with this man and this is the Covenant that he hasn't he's not made a covenant like this since the time of Abraham amen he doesn't say well if David does this I'll do this and if he doesn't do this I'll do this but he's making an everlasting unconditional covenant with him he said because there was a desire in your heart oh ma no because there's a desire in your heart to build a house for me therefore I'll let you see do it therefore I will establish my covenant with you forever because of that desire amen praise the Lord listen this is this is why this is so special because he's a man after God's own heart now listen what makes him a man after God's own heart many examples we could seem like David saying we could pray like David pray we could dance like David dance you know David could repent he could humble himself he could listen to God he could be contrite I mean he was a shepherd over sheep he loved his sheep there's so many things about being his life we could look at say that's a man after God's own heart but there's something in particular that was in his heart that God said I'm gonna make a covenant with you amen the Bible tells you in first Kings a Solomon speaker says it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel and the Lord said unto David my father whereas it was in your heart to build a house into my name thou did us well that it was in thine heart other words this is the thing the desire in his life to build a house for God that was the thing they said that's why I'm gonna make a covenant with you amen David said one thing have I desired it wasn't a bigger house or Lamborghini it was a better paying job one thing if I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple listen that's what was in David's heart a desire for the house of God I hope I hope I'm talking to some people they got the same kind of desire Eman listen this house God was gonna make sure this house was established listen he gives so much wealth and so much power to Solomon you look in the Integrity's it was the greatest Kingdom the wealthiest King had ever been in the ancient times why no praise of Lord you don't have to actually answer that but I'm going to why did God prosper Solomon why didn't give him so much wealth why didn't give him such a great Kingdom to build an house for his name cuz he promised David he would do it listen he wasn't wealthy just to be wealthy he wasn't blessed just to be blessed listen if God has blessed you with something maybe it's money maybe it's a gift maybe you can sing whatever God is giving you God has blessed you with something for a reason it's not for you to sit on it or to pride yourself on it but it's to use it for the purpose of God's house amen if God gives you something in your life it's for his purpose it's for his house hey man he bless Solomon for David's sake because he made a promise to David amen listen Solomon is a king he had 300 wives I think senator concubines and he backs at the end of his life and yet God preserved his kingdom why because he made a promise to David listen maybe you got lost loved ones this one maybe you got a child that's wayward in the world or something and you think maybe there's no hope I want you to understand him there was hope not just for David's child but for his great great great grandchildren listen miss a man by the name of Hezekiah in the Bible this man God says the prophet Isaiah some wonder you know this story he says the prophet Isaiah have an Isis set your house in order for you're gonna die and Hezekiah he turns his face toward the wall and he begins to cry he says Lord would you have mercy on me would you spare my life now listen this prophet is giving a prophecy and he's walking out the house he says why done my job I love no house gonna being goss's go back what go back Tom's gonna live really I just told me good go back tummy's gonna live home in his heart to me go back in that house and mush right back up to that man that you just pronounced the death sentence over and you let him know let's save the Lord I will spin your life I'm gonna you 15 years because of thy father David is our Isis for thy father David's sake I'll do this because Hezekiah prayed the right kind of prayer it wasn't cause he just hung himself God made a promise [Music] whatever god had mercy for him because of one man's zeal one man's desire one man's passion the belt got a house was mercy on his great great children after him for him what about for you today you've got a token not a chemistry but the life of Jesus Christ in you the same faith that save you can save your children can save your great-grandchildren you can save your great great great great you know I pray over my children every night I pray bless them pretty bust their future spouses and have them forward Terry I play dress their seat after them even the tenth generation you say brother no but if it does I prayed for him I want to have a kind of a testimony testimony say my son and I remember his prayer he served me after my own Widow in his generation fulfill all his will not had mercy on that man he had mercy on something because of one man see we saw herself short too much nobody I can't this God don't hear my prayers that's the devil lyin to you why that's like I said why are you coming here and beat you up service after service if there's any place you should be able to get victory it's in the presence of God in the house of God huh one thing if I desired behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his temple to dwell in the house of the Lord in my life see the hand of God like I've never seen him before I'm gonna testify like David surely it's Sir Mercy's sale emergency thank goodness for me every day of my life I'm gonna behold his beauty I'm gonna inquire in his temple it's gonna come to pass oh listen Solomon he builds this temple hey man he builds a temple he's so great is the glory of this natural temple oh my think about us now this is marble in stone in man's craftsmanship and yet so great is the glory of this former house that when the glory of God comes down they can't even stand to minister in the house of God listen lots of people don't stay in church because they're tired they could not stand was so strong it drove them to their knees the fire of God [Music] housed in this temple may be such a glory till I can't even stand in his presence but I follow my knees thank you give me rest from every enemy even love me to see this message you've allowed me to receive my dancers visitation but God come to give you more than a visitation he come to make you the habitation of the Spirit he dropping by for the weekend hallelujah somebody awesome people are going to church well time to repay the Lord a visit for the week listen I've heard so much to this in my life even a message churches we preach about service we preached about church I'm all about church harder I'm all about service every Sunday morning I need a god that can hear my prayer going down the road in my car just as much as he can to this altar I'm the same girl that speaks to me on Sunday meeting my children all through the week I don't need a part-time visitation visitations for divorced people we're married we joined him with him in the kitchen to see his father ship in his house tired is part time Christian stuff when I make mistakes when I lose my wife [Music] look solemn does this great temple that's great but not everybody lives in Jerusalem there some people there.just their way over here in Sheffield Ohio some way over here in Africa so sama gets inspiration they don't need a temple like that so we're gonna pray a prayer over this temple we're gonna dedicate to a special purpose Lord when your people are afflicted and they are in bondage and there's strangers in the far-off land they can lift up their eyes and look toward this temple we're God dwells they can look in the right direction and praying God will deliver them when these people when a pestilence comes on them and then find themselves smitten with cygnus they can look toward this temple sacrifices remain dedication to taking place you could be in the midst of Hoboken you could be on the the backside the backside stranded somewhere the flat tire in the moon hour but if you look toward that temple and by utter his name if you just move your lips and faith he would hear you and deliver you hey man notice the mercies of David was no longer just something with David it had moved into his seed it had moved in his children it was now in a building he made a hops and the same verse that David had if you just looked toward this house that David one to Bill you pray toward this house God would gives you the same mercy and it's funny how we read the Bible these great men of faith these great women in the Bible that's a nobodies like you and I you think Noah was smarter than the rest of a scientific age was he just a better kind of blood than the next man you know was he was he was he white collar or well uh he found great he found grace in the sight of God you think Abraham you think Abel was some great man he was the least he was the least of all people so some of y'all I'm too old to serve god it's me with 75 years old and God starts dealing with him that's 75 don't tell me God can't use you don't tell me God can't hear your prayer not tell me you're too weak it's like I said before brother brain said the weakest Christian are you here this morning so I'm just I wish I was a spiritual I wish I was as anointed and I wish this and this and that get rid of wishbone cuz the weakest Christian below is homeless newest Christian the kingdom of how begins to shake and the devil's begin to tremble and they turn on the red alert look out somebody's breaking through to heaven hey man listen John I understood that he was in the belly of a fish and then he was in the buff brother said anybody had a reason to be discouraged it was Jonah everywhere he left hopefully you don't look around church this morning feel that discours everywhere he looked was the inside of a fish it was bones and darkness and water and seaweed and whatever else cold and slimy probably RunAs good clothes if anybody had a reason to be discouraged its am so discouraged they even observed lying manatees for sitting their owner see let me say that again they that observe lying values forsake their own mercy see the mercies are sure God's mercies are sure it's what are you looking at if you observe lying babies well the doctor said this well the Pope says this well the congressman this doesn't matter what may have to say about it what did God say about it we shook up by what people say I wish you put as much confidence in God's we do each other there are opinions ideas here's here's a prophet Jonah he said I was in the belly of hell hey man listen he he wasn't sitting there and flower bed of ease he said I was in the bed of hell and darkness surrounding me he said but yet once more listen I don't know where you're at this morning this afternoon but let me tell you once more if you'll buck turn toward his holy temple and you'll begin to pray he'll hear you out of the belly of hell listen I'll be real honest with you I don't know how he knew where to look didn't have a compass didn't have a flashlight he didn't have Google Maps on his phone how's he know where to look by faith he knew there was a temple somewhere amen listen I'm gonna let you're on a secret the temple wasn't even standing anymore it was a bunch of rubble Hilary love was the foundation but the foundation of that temple was enough listen when the devil come with a power worm and the king room and the locusts and he cut down this bride tree even a little bit that was up was enough to raise up again he could look towards the temple one man's desire one man's desire to build a house delivered a man from the belly of a fish hundreds of years later I just hope God will hear my prayers one day you get a desire like this man I don't have to convince your prayers you get a desire like David half a man after God's heart you get a desire like that in your life you know I don't have to make you serve God I don't have to make you an overcomer I don't have to try to prop you up you'll find that desire in your heart is enough ambition for the kingdom of God hey man you say I'm not building that kind of a house I've got a house he's got a house it's not made with hands he's got a greater glory this latter temple this greater house it's gonna and he's a car for solving what did he do for you let me citizen

going amen amen nobody wants some God you are I'm gonna pray and he opened that he looked towards that place where that temple had been it was destroyed when the Babylonians come and he prayed as he had prayed before there was mercy out of seven years of captivity listen see these men didn't just pray but they prayed in the right direction and then that's why there were sure mercies they prayed in the right direction you say what's that got to do with let me ask you when you pray what do you pray to him it's not a nomination idea of God hey Manny he's not just floating out here in the milky way somewhere listen brother Graham said when you pray who do you pray to you pray to the God that's in you come on somebody many times we pray to God that's out there and we're hoping he comes by our way but I want you to understand you pray towards this temple you print the God that's inside you the word of faith Paul says in Romans 10 it's not you know it's in your mouth it's in your heart I'm not looking towards Jerusalem this afternoon hoping God answers my prayer but I've come into a heavenly mount to New Jerusalem to the spirits of just men made perfect to the nubile company of angels I've come I am that I am that bride adorned let's come out of heaven I'm not praying to a god that's that's out there with a hubble space girl I'm not even praying to God this three feet away when I

nowadays well praise God he's not he's never too busy to hear your prayer he's never too busy to give you mercy amen listen he had mercy for you and you were an enemy of God when you made your bed in hell like David like Jonah he heard you he brought me out of the miry clay he set my feet on a rock and you don't think you can love your neighbor your brother your sister I just don't know how God could ever deal with them well praise the Lord they're gonna be people make it you didn't think could make it could be feel not make it you thought we're gonna make it shoot that's gonna be gonna be how God wants it to be I say hey man hey man I'm not looking towards Jerusalem listen they look toward Jerusalem toward a temple that used to be there they pray to a god of history and God answered their prayers who are not praying this morning we're not preaching about I got in history this message is brought about in history he's not over there he's here he's here he's in the house he's in my

our neighbour one day we wanted to kill him because he didn't wants to come to his house so we did with Nabel is that right Abigail had to stop him he was gonna kill that man he numbered the people of Israel and brought a plague on the people of Israel listen this man didn't just steal some candy from the five-cent jar hey man he didn't just pilfer a t-shirt from this man to his death [Music] [Music] with treachery got still up David don't tell me there's no there sure mercies don't tell me don't tell me my family they're too far from God tell me that my god concealer David let's say that's a man after my own heart he could do that with David he could do that with David what can I do with you really I'm asking him what can he do with you always saying all things are possible what can he do if you could just if you could really just right now just just fully surrender to God just right now late online praise the Lord you know I was preaching about this other day I said you know Jesus said we've got to count the cost we got to take up our cross and then listen it was easy it was easy when I had nothing to give it up for the Lord when I was a nobody I had no prospects no family no nothing I don't think I had to give him was my sin that was the thing he wanted hey man listen when we get to place we get comfortable we get to a place where God can't use us like he used to cuz we just got too busy we can't surrender like we used to we can't just lay it all down like we used to but I just asked you right now if you can have that kind of a desire you could let that reign in your heart you could just lay everything down right now just really sell off everything what could God you right now in this service right now look you don't matter if it's the worst preacher in the world if you could give everything to God right now he can do anything God can do more in the next five minutes then you can do it a lifetime of your own effort for your salvation for your

his life the worst maybe sin of his whole life Santa mantas death took his wife commit adultery he begins to pray that God forgive him Gus you want to talk about mercy God said I already forgave you for even asked some of us still asked him for forgiveness for things we did 30 years ago amen so stumbles still living in the past I pray with the brother just a few weeks ago this man he got it spared his life I won't get in the hotel but he'd been in an accident and God showed me a vision I said God was gonna spare his life and God was gonna do certain things spare his life raising them up
