[38:39] [Music]
[38:58] Oh
[39:00] [Music]
[39:13] bah bah
[39:17] Oh hallelujah glory be to God you
[39:26] believe that amen we a lot of things we
[39:30] don't understand we don't have to
[39:32] understand it we just have to know in
[39:35] whom we have believed and know that and
[39:38] be persuaded that he is able to keep
[39:42] that which I've committed against that
[39:44] day amen don't you love the Lord this
[39:46] morning
[39:47] it's so good to see each and every one
[39:49] of you and how you came out on this nice
[39:52] cool brisk morning I guess the one thing
[39:56] we can take positive out of it here you
[39:59] know as God made a way for us to be a
[40:00] church and just trusting that even
[40:03] within this here it makes a way for
[40:05] germs to get killed
[40:07] is that right amen we need that we need
[40:11] that cold weather and you know how I am
[40:13] my wife after the young people had left
[40:16] on Friday evening from the youth meeting
[40:19] there you know it started to snow I
[40:23] don't know what time it was
[40:26] thankfully they had we had kept it in
[40:28] that way they could get on the road and
[40:31] get home but my goodness we when it
[40:34] started snowing I just turned the lights
[40:36] off and I just sit there and from the
[40:37] window I love it
[40:39] I know some of you all don't like that
[40:42] but I love the snow and that's why we're
[40:46] different but didn't if something is so
[40:48] special of the grace of God in our
[40:51] hearts that is the same amen I I just
[40:54] enjoy it now one of the reasons I enjoy
[40:56] the snow and you and most of you know
[40:58] this as well because I lie I don't like
[41:00] the darkness and when you do that when
[41:02] it's snowing it's just lit up it's one
[41:05] thing I miss about the steel mill when
[41:06] they would let those things off the sky
[41:08] was just being lit up you know I
[41:11] remember his boys we could go out and
[41:12] play football right about 11 o'clock at
[41:14] night he was just lit up in the sky you
[41:16] know and I just I like the snow when I
[41:18] look out and I can see the light and
[41:20] things like that so that wasn't very
[41:22] spiritual but I just thought I'd share
[41:24] that
[41:26] but you know there's always a part in
[41:28] that snow you know that we look for and
[41:31] and there's always a need you think of
[41:33] seeds that's been planted even what they
[41:36] call winter wheat it's needs a little
[41:40] thin blanket of snow to be able to cover
[41:43] it because that thin blanket of snow it
[41:45] actually it keeps it warm and then that
[41:48] moisture will settle in there and you
[41:50] know when you look at that snow see it
[41:52] might change your attitude or might
[41:53] change your outlook on snow when you
[41:55] look at that snow it's as white as white
[41:58] as can be and he said though your sins
[42:01] be as scarlet they shall be whiter than
[42:06] snow so God just drops the snow every
[42:11] once in a while brother Joshua I know
[42:15] that didn't happen in the Congo but yet
[42:16] you see it here he drops it every once
[42:19] in a while for you just to remind you
[42:20] your sins that were scarlet they're
[42:23] whiter than
[42:25] amen don't you love the Lord amen he
[42:29] took Joel one day and separated Jobe
[42:31] when Jove thought why is this going on
[42:33] why is this taking place and and God
[42:35] just let him know so wait a minute here

[45:39] that Lord he that would even read and
[45:44] hear the words of this prophecy is
[45:47] blessed and father we're here this
[45:53] morning Lord this in our hearts is more
[45:56] than just coming to serve a duty Lord
[46:01] it's more than just it being Sunday and
[46:05] here we are Lord our hearts there's a
[46:10] desire within our hearts to draw closer
[46:14] to you Lord we want more of you and we
[46:20] want to give more of ourselves for we
[46:23] realize Lord that in this place Lord you
[46:27] have given us that you would come and
[46:29] meet with this Lord
[46:31] Lord we want to be we want to be changed
[46:34] we believe God than the effect of your
[46:38] word it's a living word the Lord when it
[46:42] moves into our hearts it Lord it becomes
[46:46] an expression in our life that Lord
[46:49] where the word that was on paper it
[46:52] becomes flesh Lord and Lord it moves
[46:56] within our lives when we go back to our
[46:59] homes back to our jobs and everything
[47:01] and you know every test and every trial
[47:05] you know everything behind every hand
[47:07] and you know even everything that we
[47:09] will face Lord and Lord we're depending
[47:13] on you we asked that Lord that you would
[47:16] come and minister to every need minister
[47:20] to every heart Lord and father when we
[47:23] would lord it when the service is
[47:25] commenced Lord may it be God that from
[47:29] our hearts we can say didn't on our
[47:32] hearts burn within us as he talked to us
[47:35] along the way the Lord you're the one
[47:39] that we need to hear from and Lord we
[47:42] just ask that you Lord would come Lord
[47:45] and speak to us Lord just as you spoke
[47:48] Lord to Adam and Eve in the beginning
[47:51] just as you spoke to Abraham just as you
[47:53] spoke Lord to each and every one of your
[47:55] children
[47:56] Oh God come speak lip to ear to our
[47:59] hearts Lord may the Spirit of Truth Lord
[48:02] just minister to every life in a
[48:04] personal way I pray O God may you just
[48:08] Lord take control completely father of
[48:12] my being and every being that's here
[48:14] Lord we ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[48:17] amen
[48:18] god bless you as you're being seated
[48:27] as we were looking at Abraham last week
[48:32] and we were dealing with the thought of
[48:36] giving my all and dealing with that from
[48:41] numbers 15 where we are brought into
[48:44] this land and God himself has made a way
[48:48] that we can come in he has delivered us
[48:51] and brought us in as the scripture says
[48:53] in the beginning of the book of
[48:56] Colossians he has delivered us from the
[49:00] kingdom of darkness and we have been
[49:03] translated into the kingdom of his dear
[49:06] son our lives are truly a work of
[49:10] Almighty God and when we we look at the
[49:13] scope of everything across stit and you
[49:15] I think even of last week that as you
[49:19] evaluate and allow the Holy Spirit just
[49:22] to move upon our hearts I certainly
[49:25] believe that how God was speaking to our
[49:27] hearts last week and I believe this is
[49:29] something he continues and it wants to
[49:32] draw from our life and that's to give
[49:33] our all and you know the reality when
[49:36] you look at Abraham's life and you take
[49:38] the scope of Abraham's life from Genesis
[49:41] 11 all the way through Genesis 22 what
[49:46] you find is you find as a life that God
[49:50] has spoke to and that life continues to
[49:53] surrender the surrendering never stops
[49:57] the trust never stops the trust itself
[50:03] just becomes greater and to think of how
[50:07] that God would lay this example out
[50:10] every one of us that are gathered here
[50:13] this morning if God has spoke to your
[50:17] heart every one of us fall somewhere
[50:21] along the way from Genesis 11 through
[50:24] Genesis 22
[50:26] and to recognize that with within it
[50:29] that every promise that God has made
[50:33] when God has made you and I promise that
[50:37] promise it God's desire is that it would
[50:40] find its mark in our heart not in our
[50:46] mind first yes our mind you know we
[50:49] could receive it here in our mind but it
[50:51] must drop down into the depths of our
[50:54] soul you know brother Brandon would talk
[50:58] about in the message Shalom and he would
[50:59] talk about Judas he said Judas had the
[51:01] light up here but he said the light
[51:04] never got down here when the light when
[51:08] the light or the word has come down here
[51:10] it is something that just so completely
[51:14] expresses itself but yet if we look back
[51:17] into Abraham's life in Genesis 11 though
[51:21] we may not see any movement within
[51:23] Abraham's life as far as God has spoke
[51:27] to him but we don't see any movement out
[51:29] of the earth Cal DS and then the latter
[51:31] part of Genesis 11 here he comes to Iran
[51:33] and yet he still not come into the land
[51:37] or to where God would show him I will
[51:40] show you this land but yet but yet if we
[51:43] can and I believe we to understand this
[51:46] by God's grace before Abraham ever
[51:50] packed one box to leave the earth caddy
[51:57] already in his heart he made a decision
[52:04] Abraham wasn't following anybody else he
[52:07] was following the voice that spoke to
[52:09] his heart so before he ever impacto or
[52:14] they got their house and everything
[52:16] before that ever happening it started in
[52:18] the heart and that's that's exactly
[52:20] where it starts and that's exactly where
[52:23] it continues to unfold is in the heart
[52:27] what we look at every one of us have the
[52:30] desire and the aim that we are called to
[52:32] in this age as Genesis 22 to where God
[52:36] would require of everything of the
[52:40] promise he's given you and I when he
[52:42] gave Abraham Isaac and I and Abraham
[52:46] took Isaac and he went up there and he
[52:50] offered him up he gave all from what God
[52:55] had given him and that's the way that
[52:58] when we look at a life and if I can and
[53:01] I and I pray that it is just is so
[53:04] simple to our hearts and that is that in
[53:07] our lives that let us be sensitive to
[53:11] and and welcome the Lord to say Lord and
[53:14] I want to give my all and that friends
[53:18] that's not something that it's just as
[53:20] though Abraham you know made a quantum
[53:22] leap from Genesis 11 to 22
[53:25] there were many adversities many
[53:28] misfortunes there were misunderstandings
[53:32] that Abraham himself had in regards to
[53:37] the promise but because the promise was
[53:40] a revelation in his heart
[53:43] revelation holds within it prevailing
[53:46] power it prevailed over every one of the
[53:50] misunderstandings that were there
[53:51] Abraham chose day after day moment after
[53:58] moment to focus out all unbelief and
[54:01] focus on the Living God Abraham didn't
[54:07] know how was going to happen
[54:09] he just simply knew gone made the
[54:13] promise and I'm trusting in him and
[54:15] Abraham's trust did not wane it grew
[54:18] greater to a place to her Abraham was
[54:22] willing to give his all and God knew he
[54:26] would give his long but God wanted it to
[54:30] be displayed this is where what God has
[54:37] sown within our hearts it must come
[54:40] forth there's just so much that just
[54:46] grasp grips my heart within that that
[54:49] that chapter for you for for some years
[54:51] it just things he just meditated you
[54:53] keep coming back to that place because
[54:56] Genesis 22 is is a very when you look at
[55:01] the the prophets ministry it would he
[55:03] would bring us into this place and keep
[55:06] bringing us to Jehovah Jireh keep
[55:08] bringing us to that place why because it
[55:11] is the Lord providing for himself how in
[55:16] the world could you and I live this word
[55:20] without God providing for himself a life
[55:25] think his his word has already been sold
[55:29] within our hearts that seed was already
[55:33] there but how could the sea
[55:35] come forth unless there was quickening
[55:39] power of his life to come to release
[55:43] what's inside of you and I it couldn't
[55:47] happen without God himself and when God
[55:50] makes a promise remember when God makes
[55:53] a promise it is God his word
[55:56] isn't oath it is God binding himself God
[56:01] committing himself and I when you think
[56:05] of it like that God's word that goes out
[56:08] it's God committing himself I say let
[56:11] that same life live inside of me to her
[56:15] I'm committed to that word just as God
[56:19] has been committed to that word
[56:22] nothing else will do nothing else will
[56:27] do
[56:29] Genesis 2010 this is where we're at this
[56:33] is where we're at this is the promise of
[56:36] the rapture this is what the church has
[56:39] long for remember the promise of the
[56:42] coming Sun there's got to be something
[56:44] that that life that can be offered up to
[56:47] God
[56:48] it could not be offered in any other age
[56:51] it was all going to make the whole body
[56:55] of Jesus Christ now it comes into that
[56:58] place for the entire body of Jesus
[57:00] Christ for the fullness of the Holy
[57:03] Spirit to come into the Church of the
[57:06] Living God
[57:07] you realize this is the promise we're in
[57:09] when we're talking about the message of
[57:11] the hour we're talking about the
[57:13] revealing of the Son of Man Christ
[57:16] Himself coming fully into his church
[57:22] Jesus is not going to marry and he will
[57:25] not marry nor take a bride in rapture
[57:27] that's a halfway bride he's coming for a
[57:31] fully mature woman and the maturity is a
[57:38] maturity of that word life inside of you
[57:42] and I that word life that brings the
[57:44] harmony that I can do nothing of myself
[57:48] but what I see the father doing that
[57:52] doeth the son likewise
[57:59] here is Paul you know I then their life
[58:03] after life that we can take within that
[58:06] because that we can show lives that were
[58:11] offered up the scriptures speaker that
[58:13] Hebrews 11 takes the account of every
[58:16] one of them who we would call heroes of
[58:20] faith they offered their lives they
[58:25] sacrificed and they gave why because of
[58:30] him he became their all-in-all Paul
[58:40] makes a statement you know we could very
[58:42] well read this text and have and
[58:44] funerals and to think of it in one way
[58:48] this morning it would be good to preach
[58:50] some funerals it would be good to preach
[58:54] some funerals where lives come to their
[58:57] end you might say brother Samuel I'm not
[59:01] fit to die right now if you're not fit
[59:03] to die you're not fit to live but when
[59:07] you're fit to live in you're fit to die
[59:09] you see within it live it's not just
[59:13] something that we wait to the deathbed
[59:16] but it's where in our lives right now
[59:19] that there is a commitment that is made
[59:22] to the Lord a surrender that is made to
[59:25] God and we're reading here of a life
[59:28] that has come to it's coming to its end
[59:33] when Paul could and I think this is
[59:35] something when we look at these are not
[59:37] just words to us but where Paul could
[59:40] write in this manner I'm now ready to be
[59:42] offered that speaks of a confidence
[59:46] there was a confidence about his life
[59:49] I'm ready to be offered up that word
[59:52] offered up means for my life to be
[59:55] poured out as a drink offering the time
[59:59] of my departure is at hand
[1:00:02] he goes on as we read here I've fought
[1:00:05] the good fight so it wasn't something
[1:00:07] easy what happened in Paul's life it had
[1:00:12] to be greater than Paul's self-will
[1:00:15] because there'd be a lot of adversity
[1:00:18] there'd be a lot of temptations there'd
[1:00:21] be a lot of things come at him that
[1:00:23] would shake him to his core there would
[1:00:27] be there would be engagements that he
[1:00:29] would have to engage in listen to me the
[1:00:32] engagements fighting a good fight was
[1:00:34] not fighting with others it was even the
[1:00:37] wrestling and overcoming of his own will
[1:00:43] because our biggest enemy we've got is
[1:00:46] our own self I fought a good fight think
[1:00:51] of this these portions of Scripture
[1:00:53] right here where it is wrote you can
[1:00:55] read it when you get home
[1:00:56] Paul is testifying that he says Dimas
[1:01:01] having loved this present world hath
[1:01:04] forsaken me Paul had to be he had to be
[1:01:10] he was moved in a matter think of it
[1:01:12] Paul was a man look at his life let's
[1:01:15] just look at him in the natural he was a
[1:01:17] man that when Paul believes something he
[1:01:19] believed it now let's just look at that
[1:01:22] when he believed it he believed it when
[1:01:24] he was taught he was a Pharisee of the
[1:01:26] Pharisees Paul near the scripture knew
[1:01:30] the law knew the prophets he knew all
[1:01:32] those things and Paul himself he
[1:01:35] persecuted the Church of the Living God
[1:01:39] he took him out of their homes they
[1:01:42] slaughtered and killed him Paul even
[1:01:44] stood there and he held the coats of
[1:01:46] those who stoned Stephen behind brother
[1:01:54] branham metallicy said when he stood
[1:01:56] there holding those coats he said there
[1:01:58] was something he saw and he witnessed
[1:02:02] there in Stephens life he said it never
[1:02:06] got away from him you see Paul had all
[1:02:08] the knowledge but he didn't know the
[1:02:11] Lord he had all the scriptures Ollie he
[1:02:16] memorized it maybe Paul had the scars on
[1:02:19] the sunday-school charts but he didn't
[1:02:21] know the Lord hallelujah that's why he
[1:02:28] was up swimming and standing against it
[1:02:30] he didn't know the Lord
[1:02:33] but this is what I want you to catch
[1:02:36] remember we said his natural makeup and
[1:02:40] Paul believed something he believed it
[1:02:43] are you listening now but when he met
[1:02:47] that pillar fire on the road to Damascus
[1:02:52] there was something that went deeper
[1:02:55] than his natural ability Paul believed
[1:03:01] what he believed that's true but brother
[1:03:02] this was divine revelation the Hall was
[1:03:05] no longer walking just by written word
[1:03:08] he now was moved by the will of God and
[1:03:14] that's what calls caused people to call
[1:03:19] him a heretic that's why he could stand
[1:03:24] in front of the gripper in the way
[1:03:25] that's called heresy so worship I the
[1:03:29] God of my father's you see this is what
[1:03:35] it is he was worshipping God he was
[1:03:39] giving his all because God had revealed
[1:03:44] himself to Paul personally here the will
[1:03:50] of God was revealed think about it Paul
[1:03:52] had pressure all around you can read
[1:03:55] through the book of Acts where Paul
[1:03:57] would have pressure all around him even
[1:03:59] where Paul in one point in the scripture
[1:04:02] was wanting to know do I go should we go
[1:04:05] into Asia do we go at this time knowing
[1:04:09] knowing that it was God's will to take
[1:04:12] the gospel to the Gentiles but Paul did
[1:04:16] not take things for granted and say we
[1:04:18] go here we go here and we go here but
[1:04:21] the Bible says even when he came to a
[1:04:23] place in his life the Bible said he is
[1:04:26] seyd and that were to say in the Bible
[1:04:29] means he tested he tested to see is this
[1:04:32] God's will and you remember that night
[1:04:36] the Holy Spirit the angel the Lord he
[1:04:38] came to him in a dream gave him a dream
[1:04:41] there you hear a man in the minute garb
[1:04:43] of Masand Macedonia
[1:04:46] and speaking in Batman that way Paul
[1:04:48] would know as the man would speak in a
[1:04:50] dream come come to us and he would know
[1:04:54] at this time this is the will of God
[1:05:00] Paul was a man that when we see it was
[1:05:06] something greater than his natural
[1:05:08] ability I've had times or heard people
[1:05:11] say or when this person believes
[1:05:14] something they really believe it it's
[1:05:16] going to take more than your natural
[1:05:18] ability
[1:05:19] you'll never endure with just your
[1:05:23] natural ability I've heard people tell
[1:05:28] me and even this recently better sender
[1:05:30] I've never backed down from a challenge
[1:05:32] I've always been stubborn within that
[1:05:34] you're bragging on your first birth it
[1:05:40] is not your first birth nor my first
[1:05:43] birth that receives any glory hallelujah
[1:05:49] God will call wise men but not Paul said
[1:05:52] not many
[1:05:56] God will choose this is the scripture
[1:05:59] you know many of the poor and of the
[1:06:01] weak
[1:06:03] those who say lord I need your help I
[1:06:08] can't find my own way even in what I'm
[1:06:13] praying for do I take this job or do I
[1:06:15] take that job do I go here do I go there
[1:06:17] Lord I can't find my own way
[1:06:20] I need your leadership
[1:06:27] there's a lot written within this story
[1:06:30] I have fought a good fight of faith to
[1:06:33] wear even Dimas Dimas was so troubled
[1:06:38] the Bible said he loved this present
[1:06:40] world brother bastard Dimas he said he
[1:06:43] didn't go out and be in and start
[1:06:44] running nightclubs brother Brandon would
[1:06:47] take it you follow me now you know I've
[1:06:48] preached on this in present stage of my
[1:06:50] ministry he would even take it and say
[1:06:52] that he said now Dimas was a
[1:06:53] spirit-filled man but spirit-filled
[1:06:55] we're not itself come on friends that's
[1:07:01] why it's got to go deeper than just on
[1:07:03] the flesh or just in our mind it's gotta
[1:07:07] become a revelation when it becomes a
[1:07:12] revelation there's a uniting that takes
[1:07:15] place hallelujah
[1:07:19] neither things present nor things to
[1:07:22] come can ever separate me from the love
[1:07:27] of God that is in Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:07:29] and I am persuaded of that when Dimas
[1:07:37] would you know a poem do you think Paul
[1:07:39] didn't know this when he said having
[1:07:43] loved this present world guerrillas
[1:07:45] there's worldly thinking in the Bible
[1:07:47] the same messenger right here Paul he
[1:07:50] would write in the opening of Romans and
[1:07:53] speak of how the carnal mind is enmity
[1:07:57] to the spiritual mind Dimas was mind was
[1:08:02] how in the world can this man be one
[1:08:07] that's used to pray for the sick and the
[1:08:09] sick is healed and he leaves trophies up
[1:08:11] there sick in Mullane Meletis how could
[1:08:15] how can he leave somebody who's been so
[1:08:17] faithful to him how can he leave him
[1:08:20] sick and this man who has a ministry
[1:08:24] that everyone would love and he only has
[1:08:26] one coat
[1:08:29] what is that worldly thinking worldly
[1:08:36] thinking reasoning you realize this
[1:08:37] world the framework the framework of
[1:08:40] this world the framework of it is not
[1:08:44] the product of the faith of God this
[1:08:47] world and you can see how its crumbling
[1:08:50] it is the product of reasoning reasoning
[1:08:57] cannot spend the test this is why we
[1:09:01] need divine revelation and divine
[1:09:04] revelation stands even when we don't
[1:09:07] have an answer here but there's an
[1:09:09] answer there that justice stand that's
[1:09:15] the power of divine revelation I've
[1:09:21] fought a good fight
[1:09:22] he had to over flap you think Dimas
[1:09:23] wasn't sitting there in the meetings
[1:09:24] look how brother branham with dramatizes
[1:09:26] you'd realize friends there's things I
[1:09:28] preached I've preached right through
[1:09:30] critical spirits where things have come
[1:09:34] and has just sent and been critical and
[1:09:36] you have to you know what you have to do
[1:09:37] or bypass it pick out somebody who's
[1:09:40] really feeding on the Word of God and
[1:09:41] preach to him you have to go beyond
[1:09:46] because a critical spirit won't receive
[1:09:48] nothing from God come on somebody and
[1:09:53] I'll tell you it's it's that serious you
[1:09:55] think that Paul didn't didn't deal with
[1:09:58] that criticism that was coming his way
[1:10:00] here he is preaching divine healing and
[1:10:03] he packs a physician with him by the
[1:10:05] name of Luke hmm wow he really believes
[1:10:11] in the power of God takes his youngins
[1:10:13] to the doctor when they're sick come on
[1:10:19] friends but what Dimas what Dimas failed
[1:10:23] in is because Dimas was looking at it
[1:10:27] through his own eyes but let's get back
[1:10:29] to Paul Paul by God's grace overcame
[1:10:33] that he didn't try to say Themis let's
[1:10:37] sit down and let me have a conversation
[1:10:38] with you I will be able to persuade you
[1:10:40] listen
[1:10:41] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:10:44] kingdom of God and Jesus said flesh and
[1:10:47] blood had not revealed this unto you but
[1:10:50] my father which is in heaven when it's
[1:10:55] become a revelation you have heard
[1:10:58] directly from Almighty God where my
[1:11:04] pastor said you got to hear directly
[1:11:06] from God your pastor will be a man of
[1:11:09] God yielding of God but you've got to
[1:11:12] hear directly from God for yourself well
[1:11:18] my husband or my this note you gotta
[1:11:21] hear personally and Jesus networking
[1:11:30] jammed up no drop calls on Jesus Network
[1:11:40] it ain't 3G 4G 4G it's all G it's all
[1:11:44] God
[1:11:45] [Applause]
[1:11:48] yes sir brother ho mile we could really
[1:11:54] preach on that a little bit man I fought
[1:11:56] a good fight I have finished my course I
[1:12:04] have kept the faith
[1:12:09] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:12:11] crown of righteousness and then watch
[1:12:13] this because Paul realized this is
[1:12:16] revelation what is given to him was has
[1:12:22] it's given out remember Paul said you
[1:12:25] are in 2nd Corinthians 3 you are that
[1:12:30] revelation that's been wrote in our
[1:12:32] heart Paul remember he was going to say
[1:12:36] we preach not ourselves preaching self
[1:12:42] is Satan's Eden I get results and I get
[1:12:49] this this is why brother Graham said in
[1:12:50] Satan's Eden he said his messenger
[1:12:53] Satan's want to establish themselves in
[1:12:57] the hearts of the people
[1:12:59] but God's servants want to see Christ
[1:13:03] established in the heart of the believer
[1:13:10] hallelujah I fought a good fight man you
[1:13:14] know these verses of Scripture here I
[1:13:16] it's almost hard for me to preach from
[1:13:17] him because this is my daddy I teased
[1:13:19] him so much I said when you're gonna
[1:13:21] preach from another text my dad preached
[1:13:25] from this text so much but you know what
[1:13:26] he lived it and I wouldn't tease him in
[1:13:29] a bad way you know I just had ways he
[1:13:31] and I could just you know kind of tease
[1:13:33] a little bit here and there but when I
[1:13:35] look at it as it said which the Lord the
[1:13:37] righteous judge shall give me at that
[1:13:40] day
[1:13:41] look at this confidence this was
[1:13:45] confidence but it wasn't not confidence
[1:13:48] as far as within himself when Paul could
[1:13:51] say I have you know Paul is looking at
[1:13:53] the grace of God that has brought this
[1:13:57] to pass in my life and Paul could no you
[1:14:01] know brother Greg Paul could realize
[1:14:03] that God would use the agency of man but
[1:14:07] it didn't need those intellect he just
[1:14:11] needed Paul to be healed it and when
[1:14:14] Paul could see that out working of that
[1:14:17] life in his life that's how Paul had
[1:14:21] confidence he
[1:14:22] confidence in the outworking of the life
[1:14:25] that was within him I have finished my
[1:14:29] course literature there were no doubt
[1:14:32] some things were Paul as he would say in
[1:14:35] the scripture I got to die daily
[1:14:37] there are some things replied to say
[1:14:39] that I forgive me is that right
[1:14:47] but he had to have confidence in the
[1:14:50] working of that life within his life and
[1:14:55] not to me only but unto all them that
[1:14:59] love his appearing we're looking for his
[1:15:03] coming but we're living in his appearing
[1:15:07] his appearing is where he would reveal
[1:15:11] and make himself known by the promise of
[1:15:15] the word that is ordained for this hour
[1:15:22] are you with me
[1:15:24] that's his appearing to think how that
[1:15:27] God would appear and make it real to our
[1:15:30] hearts this is the promise of the hour
[1:15:33] you can't have the advent of the coming
[1:15:40] of the Lord Jesus in his first coming
[1:15:43] without without that of Isaiah and
[1:15:47] Malachi 3 the promise that was made for
[1:15:50] John the Baptist you can't have it
[1:15:52] without that Advent it's part the Advent
[1:15:56] goes together that's the same way in
[1:15:59] this hour behold I will send unto you
[1:16:02] Elijah the Prophet you can't have the
[1:16:06] second coming and deny the advent of the
[1:16:10] Prophet messenger can't do it because
[1:16:16] listen in order to be ready for his
[1:16:19] coming we must be prepared
[1:16:23] that's why we'll take greater than the
[1:16:26] mind of a man this message is not the
[1:16:30] intellect of brother Branham this
[1:16:32] message is the SAP of Holy Spirit from
[1:16:38] the throne of God so much so in
[1:16:45] Revelations 18 1 when the Bible says
[1:16:48] that there was a great angel that came
[1:16:51] down revelations 18 1 after these say
[1:16:54] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:16:57] glory what is that
[1:16:59] the coming of the Son of Man the visit
[1:17:05] of the Holy Ghost to the Church of the
[1:17:08] Living God and when that messenger
[1:17:11] sounded on earth the prophet said it
[1:17:15] echoed in heaven he said what it was is
[1:17:20] that messenger was so inclined
[1:17:22] with God to when he spoke heaven echoed
[1:17:27] it heaven one plan takes the message
[1:17:37] from the throne of God has come down to
[1:17:42] this earth for an in kind people but you
[1:17:49] and I might have the same assurance that
[1:17:52] Paul had I have kept the faith I've run
[1:18:00] the course and I love his appearing
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:08] love his appearing not just I love all
[1:18:12] the miracles I don't know
[1:18:13] that all comes with me but it's love his
[1:18:16] appearing
[1:18:28] too many times people have just been
[1:18:29] caught up with the aurora or the all
[1:18:32] that surrounds the message instead of
[1:18:34] receiving the message the revelation of
[1:18:39] it they've been caught up with just that
[1:18:42] part of signs and wonders and miracles
[1:18:45] but they never realized a sign only lets
[1:18:49] you know and point you to something I
[1:18:55] mean when I Drive down the road and I'm
[1:18:58] going somewhere I know I got my GPS but
[1:19:01] I like signs - I like signs when I look
[1:19:04] at it it says especially if it says you
[1:19:06] know good eats on this exit here come in
[1:19:09] and get some of our country cooking
[1:19:11] Cracker Barrel and you come into that
[1:19:12] and you know you've got that gravy and
[1:19:14] biscuits up there and this is 143 B I
[1:19:17] know I'm there mile markers on the side
[1:19:19] of the road if it says 156 I can do a
[1:19:21] little bit of math right then no problem
[1:19:23] 156 minus 143 that's 13 miles right on
[1:19:26] up the road think I can make it what is
[1:19:32] what I'm trying to say signs are not for
[1:19:35] decorations signs are to point us to a
[1:19:39] living reality hallelujah how good use
[1:19:47] that messenger is God's desire to use
[1:19:50] every one of us as his children he don't
[1:19:54] need another prophet he just needs lives
[1:19:57] that just has like the Prophet would say
[1:20:00] now you know I'm waiting on something I
[1:20:03] don't know where to take this job or
[1:20:05] this shot you know I'm waiting on
[1:20:07] something I'm waiting on him that's the
[1:20:10] exact pole
[1:20:15] and then starts to talk I'm just trying
[1:20:19] to catch your spirit and then the vision
[1:20:22] breaks it's all an example to us
[1:20:31] haha
[1:20:34] well we're gonna get somewhere and even
[1:20:37] cut off the text no grandma says listen
[1:20:42] a message absolute
[1:20:48] brother sister I'm telling you I've said
[1:20:50] this for years but it becomes more real
[1:20:53] the titles of these messages are not
[1:20:56] just titles they are declarations and
[1:21:01] they are announcements an absolute
[1:21:08] brother Brandon would pick that up
[1:21:10] killing showing us through the
[1:21:11] scriptures we can see it all of those
[1:21:13] who live down through the scriptures
[1:21:15] they had an absolute they had something
[1:21:19] that was greater in them that would
[1:21:22] cause them to walk this way and not walk
[1:21:26] this way
[1:21:27] and brother Adam would say it like this
[1:21:31] it's one of those messages he would say
[1:21:34] this he had a purpose in saving me he
[1:21:41] had a purpose in saving you and I'm
[1:21:47] determined by his will look at this by
[1:21:51] his will to do his will the reason he
[1:21:59] done it I don't know why he done it but
[1:22:04] not to add to or to take from it
[1:22:08] revelation 22:19 said don't do it if
[1:22:10] he's our absolute it cannot be otherwise
[1:22:12] there is no way for it to be otherwise
[1:22:14] he's got to be the absolute the last
[1:22:17] word think of this you know there were
[1:22:23] millions in sin when I got saved he had
[1:22:27] a purpose in saving me I'm the oddball
[1:22:31] amongst the Brethren many times I
[1:22:33] believe in predestination seeded a
[1:22:36] serpent bad times in the name of Jesus
[1:22:38] Christ all these other things the
[1:22:39] visions the power of Christ returned
[1:22:41] back and condemning organizations and
[1:22:43] things I'm the oddball but he had a
[1:22:46] reason to save me a purpose for doing it
[1:22:53] he saved me when there was millions of
[1:22:56] others in sin but he saved me for some
[1:23:00] reason now sisters how many of you have
[1:23:04] ever had your husband
[1:23:07] by you some sort of a kitchen utensil
[1:23:16] inst apart
[1:23:19] slow-cooker
[1:23:21] mr. Marriott sister mercy shaking her
[1:23:23] head frying pan cast-iron pan maybe
[1:23:29] something go good with the cornbread
[1:23:31] just you know I'm talking about some you
[1:23:38] why would he do that
[1:23:41] what'd he do would he buy you that just
[1:23:43] so that it would just be simply hung up
[1:23:46] on the wall or just set it right there
[1:23:48] on the counter
[1:23:49] well we can hang it up over the stove
[1:23:56] no it was purchased and delivered
[1:24:03] because he wants you to use that maybe
[1:24:07] it will help in your meal prep he may
[1:24:09] not even know what kind of Mills are
[1:24:10] gonna come out of the crock-pot insta
[1:24:12] pot or whatever in the world it is he
[1:24:14] may not know he just knows this is
[1:24:16] something that gets you no food can be
[1:24:18] made in and and I like food I know it's
[1:24:23] a very simple example its carnal but you
[1:24:27] know what God used Paul to make
[1:24:30] connections with things so that we could
[1:24:34] understand God did not save you nor me
[1:24:41] for no reason there's a purpose
[1:24:46] he had God didn't just speak to your
[1:24:51] heart and you're sitting here this
[1:24:52] morning just just by chance
[1:24:54] it's no grotzinger god don't work that
[1:24:58] way there's a reason there's a purpose
[1:25:05] and it's something to move within our
[1:25:08] hearts that if God had a purpose in
[1:25:11] saving me I want to be determined to
[1:25:15] fulfill that purpose by his will then we
[1:25:27] look at this they were educated man
[1:25:29] there were smart men there were
[1:25:30] theologians there were bishops and
[1:25:32] doctors and so forth in the field when
[1:25:34] he saved me but he saved me for some
[1:25:37] reason in other words there could have
[1:25:39] been people that had more knowledge of
[1:25:41] the scripture better educated could
[1:25:46] pronounce their words better but God
[1:25:48] didn't save them he saved you God's not
[1:25:56] interested in highlighting human ability
[1:26:02] God wants to highlight himself in our
[1:26:06] lives the dream goes on to say that he
[1:26:14] keeps on high he had a reason for it and
[1:26:17] I'm determined to hold that reason no
[1:26:19] matter what anybody else says I don't
[1:26:21] disfellowship him don't discredit him
[1:26:23] but I know what I'm tied to you know
[1:26:26] what you're tired too he wanted me like
[1:26:29] this he had me like this
[1:26:30] I was made like that for a purpose I had
[1:26:32] to be made up of all these qualities and
[1:26:34] so forth and all these no accounts so he
[1:26:37] could dig it out of me and put something
[1:26:40] in there that was his word and I'm
[1:26:43] determined I'll know nothing else but
[1:26:46] Christ
[1:26:51] sometimes that determination we want to
[1:26:54] grow but we need to also say stay is
[1:26:56] simple in determination you ever take
[1:26:59] like a little kid and here they are you
[1:27:01] know in the hot chair
[1:27:03] think I know because I had a few of them
[1:27:05] there in the hot chair some a little bit
[1:27:08] more strong wielding others but you have
[1:27:10] them in a high chair and you give a
[1:27:11] little something right right
[1:27:16] they can't chocolate and you're about
[1:27:25] ready to lay hands you know that what
[1:27:30] you're giving them they don't want it
[1:27:34] but there's something that they walked
[1:27:39] maybe won the spaghetti maybe it's the
[1:27:42] buttered roll
[1:27:44] they might have had a taste of it and
[1:27:46] they liked it hmm then you bring that
[1:27:50] out determination they saw something
[1:27:57] that they wanted they were determined to
[1:28:04] get it a little kid a little baby like
[1:28:11] that
[1:28:11] how much more for our lives we know what
[1:28:16] it means to be in the will of God we
[1:28:20] know what it means to feel the power of
[1:28:22] God and the glory of God we know what it
[1:28:25] means for him to speak to our hearts and
[1:28:27] that's why with anything else could
[1:28:29] count we can say because why there's
[1:28:38] something we have tasted out and the
[1:28:41] rest of the world has lost its grip
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:51] there's something greater that touches a
[1:28:55] lie like the captain when they would
[1:29:03] come into this Harbor many ships wrecked
[1:29:05] because women would come out on the
[1:29:06] shore scandal addressed and they would
[1:29:08] sing and they would lose sight of their
[1:29:11] course and turn the ship in and they
[1:29:13] would crash upon the rocks and the only
[1:29:15] reason those women came out there
[1:29:17] skandhas Lee dress is to cause the ship
[1:29:19] carrying the treasure to wreck so that
[1:29:23] there were those waiting in the rocks
[1:29:24] that could come and relieve that ship
[1:29:27] wreck of its treasure
[1:29:32] they would tie that captain up and plug
[1:29:35] the years of every one of those
[1:29:39] shipmates he was to turn and turn him
[1:29:47] but they had been silenced to that
[1:29:50] request the man got off the ship to one
[1:29:54] day and will suddenly heard some other
[1:29:57] music he turned and he walked to that
[1:30:01] music was right in a church singing
[1:30:05] Amazing Grace or whatever the songs were
[1:30:09] God done something in his life never
[1:30:14] gonna have to sail that way again are
[1:30:17] you hearing me they were gonna have to
[1:30:20] go back to that job go back to the
[1:30:22] school
[1:30:22] go back among the family they're gonna
[1:30:24] have to go that same way
[1:30:27] when they came up that pathway in that
[1:30:30] course the makes SP hey captain
[1:30:34] do we need to tie you up and put the ear
[1:30:36] said no sir
[1:30:38] you don't got do that no more he said
[1:30:41] I'd done her music that's better than
[1:30:43] more beautiful than that he heard music
[1:30:47] that wasn't gonna wreck his here
[1:30:49] our music that would bring him safely
[1:30:51] home and that's what it is for the night
[1:31:00] I'm telling you that is the power of the
[1:31:03] gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul would say
[1:31:08] it's not I that liveth but Christ that
[1:31:11] liveth inside of me let me just refer to
[1:31:19] a few places Jesus standing in the
[1:31:22] temple he looks upon over at the
[1:31:27] Treasury where they would come in and
[1:31:29] they would deposit
[1:31:31] and he looks and he points out to the
[1:31:34] disciples look at this little widow
[1:31:37] woman she gave two months and Jesus
[1:31:43] could say she has given more than all
[1:31:50] the rich let's just put this in layman
[1:31:55] terms
[1:31:57] she gave let's say two dollars let's say
[1:32:02] ten dollars but here the rich they put
[1:32:09] in a hundred dollars well when we're
[1:32:11] looking at just the calculations the
[1:32:14] rich put in more by calculations but
[1:32:17] Jesus was looking more than just what
[1:32:20] was given out here he was looking at
[1:32:23] where was it given from the rich gave
[1:32:28] more out here
[1:32:30] but when it came from here she gave more
[1:32:35] than the rich that's mark 12 Jesus said
[1:32:39] she gave of her what you understand what
[1:32:42] that means she could add she could have
[1:32:45] used that $10 it would have made me made
[1:32:48] things a little bit more comfortable for
[1:32:50] her
[1:32:53] and there's things that you and I can
[1:32:55] hold back on God not just with money but
[1:32:59] our time our lives
[1:33:03] you know I've you know I've I've
[1:33:07] repented you know have you been baptized
[1:33:11] in the name of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:33:14] trying to get you to get works up
[1:33:15] through us through a church I'm talking
[1:33:17] friends it's got to come to where you
[1:33:19] don't just stop somewhere you've got to
[1:33:22] keep going the biggest curse is to get
[1:33:26] in your mind I've made it that's a curse
[1:33:32] because we become complacent and the
[1:33:34] things that you escaped it begins to
[1:33:36] overtake you and go on here in the
[1:33:43] scripture showing how Paul had that kind
[1:33:45] of an attitude where have you been
[1:33:47] where you had where are you moving are
[1:33:49] you moving on with the Lord you say why
[1:33:52] do you say it because I'm telling you
[1:33:53] the rapture is upon us
[1:34:00] halfway living in and out and every
[1:34:03] thought going in a rapture
[1:34:06] not going interruptions to be living for
[1:34:10] his coming come on somebody is living
[1:34:16] for his coming where everybody knows
[1:34:21] everybody knows you're living for the
[1:34:26] coming of the Lord
[1:34:29] she gave her all she didn't hold back in
[1:34:33] one area it goes deeper because
[1:34:36] sometimes when you touch on that and you
[1:34:38] touch on things sometimes you know in
[1:34:40] your sin are our own carnality instead
[1:34:43] of recognizing the word as a vision and
[1:34:44] say oh yeah well that was a great
[1:34:46] salvation message you missed it you
[1:34:49] missed it
[1:34:49] even if last Sunday you thought that was
[1:34:51] a great salvation that you missed it it
[1:34:53] wasn't about that God just happened to
[1:34:56] break over in those areas it was about
[1:34:58] you and I giving our all not becoming
[1:35:03] complacent well I know the message you
[1:35:06] know and I can quote this quote and I
[1:35:08] know this this and I do this and I do
[1:35:10] that it's more than that it's where your
[1:35:14] life is wrapped up in Jesus Christ
[1:35:20] hallelujah the scripture would say it
[1:35:24] like this this is challenging to all of
[1:35:27] our hearts that's it is challenging to
[1:35:30] all of our hearts this is why Jesus
[1:35:32] could say don't lay up for yourselves
[1:35:34] treasures on this earth it decays
[1:35:39] you can give yourself to such things of
[1:35:42] this earth wait a few years it'll be on
[1:35:46] the curve second week of the month if
[1:35:48] you live in Lorraine what you labor for
[1:35:54] work for it nothing wrong with you
[1:35:57] understand it ain't nothing wrong with
[1:35:59] that of the furniture but it's the part
[1:36:00] that things that things that people will
[1:36:04] value and labor for and pour out their
[1:36:06] lives the puck corners here save here
[1:36:09] they'll give here how hard we can't go
[1:36:11] there no no we can't well peace and hot
[1:36:13] what would you have huh you know well we
[1:36:16] got to make a payment on this right here
[1:36:17] so let's do this they will put such
[1:36:19] value on things of this earth and yet
[1:36:23] things of their soul
[1:36:25] they'll take so for granted well I mean
[1:36:28] you know if we don't go to church I mean
[1:36:29] you know God understands he's a great
[1:36:31] big God Jehovah job is gonna come down
[1:36:33] and provide rapture force you know he's
[1:36:35] just gonna take us no he's not no he's
[1:36:38] not I said no it's not no he's not
[1:36:41] God's not gonna do that they not up for
[1:36:47] your tread self treasures on this earth
[1:36:48] but lay up treasures in heaven this is a
[1:36:53] very scripture that most of us would
[1:36:56] know you know him from Sunday School
[1:36:58] where your treasure is house the rest of
[1:37:04] it go there were your heart be also
[1:37:09] you ever had somebody and maybe as a
[1:37:11] coach or somebody they can sit there and
[1:37:13] look at them or you can look at your
[1:37:15] kids if you're privileged to have them
[1:37:19] home school or you can look at other
[1:37:22] things in their life and say you ain't
[1:37:24] given your all
[1:37:27] or the coach or somebody else a put your
[1:37:31] heart in it put your heart in it you
[1:37:36] know if that means you put your all in
[1:37:38] it you put your heart in it you're
[1:37:42] pouring yourself in it hallelujah
[1:37:52] this is why when the scripture he would
[1:37:55] be very clearly there is nothing we
[1:37:57] brought into this world and we're not
[1:37:58] gonna take nothing out of it hey man
[1:38:02] this is why even you know the admonition
[1:38:06] where even as the Prophet would speak of
[1:38:09] this in spiritual food and due season
[1:38:11] and he would mention to you and I
[1:38:13] regarding what God has done in this hour
[1:38:17] and he would say I want you to get built
[1:38:20] up in this holy Oracles of God in the
[1:38:23] faith the faith of this hour and they
[1:38:27] just say this is plain as simple as I
[1:38:29] can say it you need to be listening to
[1:38:32] the message of the hour you need to be
[1:38:37] feeding on that word there's no right
[1:38:41] now of everything that we have at our
[1:38:43] disposal there's absolutely no excuse
[1:38:46] we're both Simon I'm reading a book on
[1:38:49] Finney you need to be giving yourself to
[1:38:51] the message of the hour Finney is not
[1:38:54] the messenger for this hour you can read
[1:38:58] something there on the side but you need
[1:39:01] to give your all to this it's going to
[1:39:07] take look at this it's going to take
[1:39:09] more faith than ever was in any age for
[1:39:12] this has to be rapturing faith be taken
[1:39:16] up we want to look like we said we want
[1:39:18] you to believe tonight in all that you
[1:39:20] have seen heard the word you have heard
[1:39:25] preached the signs and wonders that
[1:39:27] you've seen done
[1:39:30] we want you to accumulate all that
[1:39:34] together in your heart and consider it
[1:39:38] whether it be of God or not accumulate
[1:39:44] it the messages that God brings right
[1:39:49] here is the same inspiration that God
[1:39:55] has given in this out without the
[1:39:57] message I have nothing to preach there
[1:40:03] is nothing to preach this Bible this
[1:40:06] Bible wonderful the Bible is wonderful
[1:40:09] but without the inspiration of the Holy
[1:40:12] Ghost in this hour the message of the
[1:40:15] hour it's a dead letter they've taken
[1:40:20] the quickening power of God to raise up
[1:40:23] the body of Jesus Christ that makes this
[1:40:28] word an absolute think about it you know
[1:40:32] what I'm talking about
[1:40:33] churches have sold out they once
[1:40:36] believed in certain things and then they
[1:40:38] go to their councils and their councils
[1:40:40] are split heaven just last year
[1:40:46] AME Methodist movement African Methodist
[1:40:49] Church they went to their council our
[1:40:53] split because they're getting pressure
[1:40:57] to allow homosexuality in the pulpit and
[1:41:02] in the church what's doing that cuz they
[1:41:07] don't have the absolute of the Holy
[1:41:10] Spirit the Living Word of God
[1:41:17] what would cause somebody to forsake
[1:41:20] this work because they don't have the
[1:41:22] absolute of the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:41:28] talking about an anointing on a spirit
[1:41:31] I'm talking about Jesus Christ in the
[1:41:36] soul huh my voice might be a little bit
[1:41:48] up and down and strong in that sound
[1:41:50] this is strong for a counseling session
[1:41:52] but this is more than just preaching
[1:41:57] this is more than just preaching friends
[1:42:02] I'm not here to preach I'm here to
[1:42:06] deliver what God's put on my heart
[1:42:09] there's a lot of wonderful things that I
[1:42:11] shout and sing through the weekend the
[1:42:13] inspiration and I'll follow these
[1:42:15] different things goes in the file
[1:42:17] because we're waiting we're looking for
[1:42:21] what he is going to say the brem says
[1:42:27] lucky last year old Elijah if God be God
[1:42:31] then serve Him if this message is the
[1:42:37] Living God
[1:42:38] the promise of the word made alive and
[1:42:42] serving serving with everything you've
[1:42:47] got you don't want to be down there like
[1:42:51] Paul's heaven I wish I would I was
[1:42:54] opposed not saying I wish he said I have
[1:42:58] and let me tell you something Paul was
[1:43:01] also one that would quickly be able to
[1:43:02] point out to you and I that don't you
[1:43:04] glorify flesh oh if I could just be like
[1:43:07] Paul Paul was quick to point out these
[1:43:09] vessels are earth they're fragile weak
[1:43:12] vessels it's not the vessel it's the
[1:43:15] excellency of the power of God's that's
[1:43:18] drilling behind our flesh
[1:43:20] so if you say I want to be like thought
[1:43:22] what you're really saying is I want that
[1:43:25] same Christ that lived through Paul and
[1:43:28] Paul was so surrendered to I want to
[1:43:30] live that kind of a surrender life and
[1:43:37] if Jesus is the center of all things to
[1:43:40] the Christian hallelujah
[1:43:43] that's what this message does it reveals
[1:43:45] Jesus Christ you take this message away
[1:43:49] and you've got the ideas of a man come
[1:43:55] on somebody and if Jesus is the center
[1:43:58] of all things to the Christian then I
[1:44:00] think we ought to let loose of
[1:44:03] everything yes and cleave to him
[1:44:08] remember he's the center he's the North
[1:44:11] Star he is the ultimate he's the
[1:44:13] absolute I never heard the Underground
[1:44:18] Railroad it's one of things I like to I
[1:44:23] like reading about Mother Burley and I
[1:44:24] were talking about her here the other
[1:44:25] night all right I said you ever read I
[1:44:27] said I love it I study a lot on I read a
[1:44:29] lot about it a lot of houses I know of
[1:44:31] places all up through Oberlin places in
[1:44:33] Sandusky I've been in in houses it was a
[1:44:38] whole thing of what was taking place
[1:44:40] where there was slaves that was down
[1:44:42] there in the south come on somebody and
[1:44:48] there was one who would go down there
[1:44:50] Harriet Tubman was also known as what
[1:44:52] Moses there right she would go down in
[1:44:57] there she would risk her life so that
[1:45:00] others could be free come on the Bible
[1:45:04] would say in the book of Acts come on
[1:45:06] now follow me the Bible says they have
[1:45:07] hazarded hazarded their lives for the
[1:45:10] gospel
[1:45:11] you're not hazard or their lives you
[1:45:13] might look and say however hazarded my
[1:45:16] life look at decisions you've made you
[1:45:19] could have taken decisions that would
[1:45:21] have made it easier on you
[1:45:24] decisions that would have comforted you
[1:45:27] do you but you made decisions on account
[1:45:33] of the gospel are you in me it speaks
[1:45:39] back there but I'd identifies that life
[1:45:41] still comes on think about how they
[1:45:43] would travel on that of that Underground
[1:45:45] Railroad they would Pat there was marks
[1:45:47] they were looking at signs they would
[1:45:51] fill up on the trees to know the
[1:45:53] direction they're going they had to use
[1:45:54] nature nature was giving signs to them
[1:46:00] you're on the right path deliverance is
[1:46:03] nigh come on now
[1:46:05] the earth Kronus and travaileth are you
[1:46:09] with me now they were looking and how
[1:46:12] did they know when you study it how did
[1:46:14] they know even though this house might
[1:46:17] have been a house that was designated as
[1:46:19] a safe haven the only way they knew you
[1:46:23] can come to this house at this time
[1:46:25] there was a light and not just a light a
[1:46:28] candle light and the light of the candle
[1:46:32] would know you're safe you see you see
[1:46:40] there are seven lamps seven spirits come
[1:46:43] on for him seven stars and when that
[1:46:47] revelation comes from there that light
[1:46:50] that shining it lets you know various
[1:46:53] safety come on in here
[1:46:57] there is safety and then you move from
[1:47:04] that place to the next place to the next
[1:47:07] place the goal was not over land the
[1:47:10] goal was not the followed house in
[1:47:11] Sandusky that was not the goal those
[1:47:14] were just stations along the way we're
[1:47:20] not called to a station we are called to
[1:47:23] the rapture it's the light of the gospel
[1:47:28] that says their safety here their safety
[1:47:32] under the blood
[1:47:34] there's the night that lets you know
[1:47:36] your past is clear your future is bright
[1:47:48] when were they watching the whole time
[1:47:50] Northstar looking at the North Star if
[1:47:57] the North Star was over here it wasn't
[1:48:00] the North Star that moved
[1:48:01] they had drifted so they kept their eyes
[1:48:06] on the North Star and they just thinking
[1:48:07] well you know what you know how it if
[1:48:09] sometimes you get lost some of you've
[1:48:12] never been out there in the woods a
[1:48:13] hunting when it turns dark and you can't
[1:48:14] even see your faith your hand in front
[1:48:15] of your face and you think I came out
[1:48:17] just like this this way I came out here
[1:48:20] never forget I was out there deer
[1:48:22] hunting in the woods and Wellington one
[1:48:24] time is out there with Mikey and I came
[1:48:26] out of the tree man I got done got my
[1:48:27] climber down and packed it all up and
[1:48:29] here it was it was dusk and dark and I
[1:48:31] started walking I said man I know I came
[1:48:32] in this way I started walking
[1:48:34] finally Mikey came out there hey you
[1:48:38] called me Sammy he got that from his
[1:48:40] grandma hey Sammy
[1:48:44] he's come up here I said we didn't come
[1:48:46] that way he said we came this way he
[1:48:49] said I just went back the way after I
[1:48:51] dropped you off you see how being in a
[1:48:57] situation I thought I knew where I was
[1:48:59] going but thankfully when he was there
[1:49:04] to call it out to me and I started
[1:49:06] walking you know what happened I started
[1:49:08] realizing oh yeah there's that
[1:49:10] reflective tag on that tree oh there's
[1:49:12] that oh yeah I recognize the others
[1:49:15] fence post we had to crawl over there
[1:49:16] yeah recognize all this now
[1:49:19] somebody had to call me
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:23] the North Star the absolute is the
[1:49:28] revelation of Jesus Christ don't take
[1:49:30] your eyes off of it you might start to
[1:49:34] drift this way a little bit what do I do
[1:49:36] look at the North Star
[1:49:39] you see that's what the preaching of the
[1:49:42] gospel it goes forth to do what does it
[1:49:45] do it doesn't cover the North Star but
[1:49:48] sometimes I walk has got off a little
[1:49:50] bit but the preaching of the gospel it
[1:49:53] reveals where the North Star is it
[1:49:55] reveals where we are so that we will are
[1:49:58] here can be connected with where we need
[1:50:01] to be coz the North Star it'll lead us
[1:50:04] home so how do our life comes and
[1:50:13] awefully are turning this way it's an
[1:50:17] offering turning this way it's offering
[1:50:20] up of our will surrendering it to him
[1:50:25] we owe him everything don't we we owe
[1:50:30] him everything we owe him all that we
[1:50:34] are
[1:50:34] let me read these scriptures in closing
[1:50:39] Philippians 3:7 here is Paul who we read
[1:50:45] about
[1:50:48] what things were gain to me those are
[1:50:54] counted loss for Christ it shows in a
[1:51:01] valuing reflecting evaluating applying
[1:51:05] the token to every situation
[1:51:12] there's things listen to me that God
[1:51:16] doesn't want you to have that would be
[1:51:18] gain to you but whatever becomes gain to
[1:51:22] you and Christ is diminished that's all
[1:51:25] it is is gain to you but when it's
[1:51:30] really a gain in other words again
[1:51:32] listen to me you want to be as Abraham
[1:51:37] to be blessed and be a blessing
[1:51:45] and I've had people ask me about things
[1:51:47] and they were praying about where to go
[1:51:48] to church and here you know years ago
[1:51:52] some things I told him I said look
[1:51:54] because I never told anybody you come
[1:51:57] here you got to have that revelation
[1:52:03] because there'll be things it'll test
[1:52:05] that revelation you got to have that
[1:52:08] revelation I said this is the thing you
[1:52:12] apply it when God called Abraham he said
[1:52:17] you will be blessed and you will be a
[1:52:21] blessing because he you're not meant to
[1:52:25] be as just a place that receives water
[1:52:29] and there's no outlet but your life is
[1:52:33] meant to receive
[1:52:40] do you love the Lord look at this power
[1:52:44] I'm saying what I think these are
[1:52:45] scriptures and I look at these
[1:52:47] scriptures I know you've heard me read
[1:52:48] from more I look at these scriptures I
[1:52:51] look at these these are things for our
[1:52:53] lives to evaluate everything evaluate
[1:52:57] everything yeh doubtless watch how Paul
[1:52:59] says I count all things but loss for the
[1:53:01] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[1:53:03] Jesus my Lord whom I have suffered the
[1:53:07] loss of all things and do count them but
[1:53:14] dung that I may win Christ and be found
[1:53:21] in him not having mine own righteousness
[1:53:28] see Paul was a recipient of that word
[1:53:31] than life he was receiving and is it a
[1:53:35] word is coming it's changing his life so
[1:53:38] who is it it's the righteousness of God
[1:53:41] working in his life which is of the law
[1:53:46] but that which is through the faith of
[1:53:48] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[1:53:50] by faith that I may know him and the
[1:53:54] power of his resurrection and the
[1:53:56] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:54:01] conformable unto his death if by any
[1:54:05] means I might attain unto the
[1:54:09] resurrection of the Dead now this
[1:54:11] scripture it might sound like Paul's
[1:54:13] just on the well I want to be part of
[1:54:14] the resurrection you don't want to just
[1:54:16] be part of the resurrection because all
[1:54:19] are going to be resurrected one day Paul
[1:54:23] is speaking here I'm not I want to be
[1:54:25] part of that second I want to be part of
[1:54:27] the first resurrection that's what I'm
[1:54:30] striving for that's what I'm laying
[1:54:34] everything on the line do you realize
[1:54:37] the pulse that I counted but dumb you
[1:54:39] know the under strict you know what Paul
[1:54:40] came to the place he didn't put
[1:54:42] something back there and then keep on
[1:54:44] sitting down at the dinner table say you
[1:54:46] know if I've done this I mean this could
[1:54:49] have been good and I mean that this
[1:54:50] could if you keep if you
[1:54:52] if you keep those thoughts and keep
[1:54:55] dwelling on it eventually what your
[1:54:58] thoughts are and your words your heart
[1:55:02] will follow the Bible says if they had
[1:55:06] been mindful of the country they were
[1:55:08] taken out of they certainly would have
[1:55:10] had an opportunity to return but we seek
[1:55:14] for our country the other William we
[1:55:19] seek for that country whose builder and
[1:55:21] maker other days is God
[1:55:28] Hebrew him how could you say that to lot
[1:55:31] he didn't say it harshly Abraham was a
[1:55:34] gentleman you want to go this way we'll
[1:55:36] go this way you're gonna go this way
[1:55:38] we're gonna go this way it was the
[1:55:44] promise the promise he had been holding
[1:55:46] what was happening it was becoming more
[1:55:49] preeminent in his life
[1:55:56] verse 12
[1:56:00] I'm not gonna read the whole chapter
[1:56:01] don't worry I want you to look at these
[1:56:04] verses but does this is a man by Apostle
[1:56:07] Paul the messenger of that he's he's
[1:56:09] been caught up into the third heaven he
[1:56:13] saw things but the carlo's that says
[1:56:14] it's not even lawful to be uttered a man
[1:56:21] that has borne imprisonments beatings
[1:56:24] he said people that were patting him on
[1:56:27] the back at one point and now we're
[1:56:30] ready to stab him come on now people
[1:56:35] that were cheering him up now they
[1:56:36] turned against him look what he says not
[1:56:44] as though I had already attained either
[1:56:50] were already perfect listen I understand
[1:56:54] Paul was talking about the perfection of
[1:56:55] Christ Paul was speaking of that in
[1:56:57] Hebrews let us go on to perfection yes
[1:56:59] he's talking about the perfection of the
[1:57:01] soul there but this perfect right here
[1:57:05] is Paul was speaking of maturity I want
[1:57:09] to see this word lived out in me Paul's
[1:57:15] not saying yeah I've already made it you
[1:57:17] know how God delivered the revelation
[1:57:19] that's been delivered through my life
[1:57:21] I've already made it know this is what
[1:57:24] he thought of himself it was not self
[1:57:27] condemnation it was not Paul saying oh I
[1:57:29] know tell I ain't no good that's pride
[1:57:32] come on now pride always seeks to cover
[1:57:38] but Paul is actually speaking something
[1:57:41] that within his life he has not counted
[1:57:45] himself but I've already attained to it
[1:57:47] either were already perfect I would say
[1:57:51] that Paul was somebody that you would
[1:57:53] love to have fellowship with because he
[1:57:56] wasn't a know-it-all even though he he
[1:57:59] was wrestling so much of the revelation
[1:58:03] of Jesus Christ but if you would have
[1:58:05] been around Paul this was a spirit of
[1:58:08] humility I guarantee you to felt like
[1:58:10] the bigger person but I follow laughter
[1:58:17] if that I may have pre him that for that
[1:58:22] which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[1:58:25] I'm seeking to lay hold this is what
[1:58:30] he's saying but then I want to lay hold
[1:58:33] on what has laid hold on my life
[1:58:38] what's gripped my life you know what I'm
[1:58:40] talking about
[1:58:41] what's gripped our life you can't
[1:58:43] explain it you can't explain when God
[1:58:47] gets ahold of your life you can't
[1:58:49] explain that hole that's on your life
[1:58:52] and you somebody can suit challenge you
[1:58:54] but there's a hole in your life there's
[1:58:57] an anchor let the Hebrew children when
[1:59:00] it comes time to scan you scanned God is
[1:59:05] silent but you stand I'm standing on the
[1:59:09] Word of God I don't know if he's gonna
[1:59:11] deliver us but we're gonna be delivered
[1:59:13] from you O king either way
[1:59:20] weighing bound wing bound so you can get
[1:59:25] these kneepads out of here
[1:59:28] hello we're not bound down we're
[1:59:32] standing gonna beat up god I want to
[1:59:39] apprehend what I've been apprehended off
[1:59:43] brethren verse 13 I count not myself to
[1:59:49] have apprehended I count not I think not
[1:59:54] do you realize friends you realize how
[1:59:57] many times brother Branham would tell us
[1:59:58] and we find the scriptures your thoughts
[2:00:03] what you think on creates an atmosphere
[2:00:08] around you when Paul was hearing the
[2:00:13] word and receiving from God it was
[2:00:17] challenging Paul's life it was
[2:00:20] challenging every part of his life for
[2:00:22] the date it challenged him in these
[2:00:25] places to where Paul he did not think in
[2:00:29] his mind I've got it made I'm the
[2:00:34] messenger look what's come to through me
[2:00:37] look what has been declared Paul knew if
[2:00:43] that word has come forth just like in
[2:00:47] the beginning when he speaks
[2:00:50] it's to come forth into manifestation
[2:00:59] in that wonderful all said I know when
[2:01:04] he speaks it's to come forth in my life
[2:01:09] and Paul would not think because what
[2:01:12] you think creates an atmosphere you see
[2:01:17] where real humility begins it's not like
[2:01:21] out here like somebody can be doing this
[2:01:26] out here and it's either one and all
[2:01:30] this you can see then you see the people
[2:01:33] everything could be so pious and this
[2:01:35] and that but humility comes from a
[2:01:44] humble heart it's a humble heart to the
[2:01:52] revealed will of God it comes out
[2:02:00] we don't count ourselves in our own
[2:02:02] abilities to be able to do it but lord I
[2:02:05] give myself but this one thing I do
[2:02:10] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:02:13] and reaching forth unto those things
[2:02:16] which are before me I press you see
[2:02:22] you've got to have that allow him allow
[2:02:25] him to clear your past you with me he
[2:02:32] could is the past and gives you focused
[2:02:35] on the future
[2:02:41] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[2:02:45] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:02:52] oh how you doing I press striving toward
[2:03:01] the mark he's got his eyes set on the
[2:03:05] prize and you know what that prize is
[2:03:09] it's a crown of life eternal life a new
[2:03:14] body I've got my eyes and they'll say
[2:03:18] this morning if you don't got your eyes
[2:03:19] let say God I want to give myself to you
[2:03:24] and if you can look and look we need the
[2:03:28] reliable ministering of the word why
[2:03:30] because there's times where we can get
[2:03:33] caught up in the cares of life and
[2:03:36] sometimes we can get caught in our own
[2:03:39] thinking about things and we can get
[2:03:42] caught into reasoning on certain trying
[2:03:44] to reason this out and looking but this
[2:03:47] is why we need
[2:03:50] the ministering of the word the Ministry
[2:03:55] of the word it brings the North Star in
[2:03:58] view to where when our feet have got off
[2:04:02] we can look to see what the gospel is to
[2:04:05] do calls you to see the North Star
[2:04:07] I've traded God when you've come I pray
[2:04:10] the God this morning
[2:04:11] and every service we come into that it's
[2:04:15] the North Star that you see you may not
[2:04:18] remember was that brother Samuel was
[2:04:19] that brother BER dream Berlin was that
[2:04:21] but who in the world was that was that
[2:04:23] was that something ruther Richard said
[2:04:24] when the prayer request was that
[2:04:26] did you see the North Star was that
[2:04:30] maybe they know maybe that was one that
[2:04:31] special song I wonder that ain't
[2:04:34] important what's important is you saw
[2:04:36] the North Star everything that is done
[2:04:40] within a service is for the edification
[2:04:44] of the body of Jesus Christ I know I've
[2:04:53] been a little longer today didn't get to
[2:04:58] know nearly nowhere but that's the
[2:05:02] thought giving my all
[2:05:08] we're in a race the finish line is in
[2:05:12] sight brother Greg all of the witnesses
[2:05:16] all around us we have the witnesses
[2:05:20] sometimes on a course when they're
[2:05:22] running that marathon course they don't
[2:05:24] have people just standing around but
[2:05:26] they had people standing at the front
[2:05:27] everybody's cheering them yeah but when
[2:05:30] they get near the end there's certain
[2:05:32] points of that race they got people
[2:05:34] there saying he staggered not at the
[2:05:38] promise of God clout of many witnesses
[2:05:42] [Applause]
[2:06:00] don't you love the Lord
[2:06:03] give everything and listen friends this
[2:06:07] is where we come to bigger beyond this
[2:06:08] service it comes to a place to let the
[2:06:12] word the examine our lives like Paul
[2:06:16] where we're not just feeling comfortable
[2:06:19] but we're examining our lives Lord as
[2:06:23] Paul said let every man examine
[2:06:25] themselves seeing where they be in the
[2:06:26] faith or not let us examine where is our
[2:06:29] heart had as a heart got misplaced has a
[2:06:33] heart got over here as a heart words are
[2:06:35] heard at for wherever our heart is there
[2:06:37] were a treasure be also let everything
[2:06:41] be invested into the kingdom of God
[2:06:44] sometimes I just don't feel like I have
[2:06:46] the words and everything of what to say
[2:06:48] but friends if I could say with
[2:06:50] everything within me give everything
[2:06:52] you've got those that are streaming
[2:06:55] those that are all kind of theirs give
[2:06:57] everything you've got
[2:06:59] don't let anything be put ahead of the
[2:07:02] Lord sometimes you see things where
[2:07:05] people will give they'll give everything
[2:07:07] oh I can't miss this shopping trip and
[2:07:09] they'll go shopping and then they're not
[2:07:13] even in the house of God where your
[2:07:16] heart is there your treasure is also
[2:07:20] this is something to be it's something
[2:07:23] to check our life but the same way that
[2:07:24] challenge me good we all need challenged
[2:07:26] I said we all need challenged we all
[2:07:29] need a letter everything be examined in
[2:07:32] that in the Word of God because what
[2:07:35] Paul said I'm now ready to be offered up
[2:07:40] let's just pray
[2:07:47] Oh Lord Jesus father
[2:07:54] Lord you know from my heart and I
[2:07:58] believe the hearts of your children Lord
[2:08:02] they have not gathered to hear a sermon
[2:08:07] and not gathered to just be preached to
[2:08:09] no no Lord we've gathered here this
[2:08:15] morning
[2:08:18] in order with a real purpose you had a
[2:08:21] purpose for saving me you had a purpose
[2:08:26] for saving them
[2:08:31] Lord we're determined to do your will by
[2:08:37] you will
[2:08:40] god I pray this morning
[2:08:44] may the Holy Spirit if our vision has
[2:08:49] become scaled over if
[2:08:57] with hot Lord to where our attention as
[2:09:01] the Prophet spoke about the bride coming
[2:09:04] into preview and he noticed that that
[2:09:07] bride got her eyes on the Church of the
[2:09:14] world oh how bad they were getting and
[2:09:18] all that that that wasn't that's not the
[2:09:21] focus our focus
[2:09:26] is to be on you Lord there's a lot of
[2:09:31] things that disappointments and things
[2:09:33] that come along the way we see things
[2:09:37] now we see Lord if you tarry they'll be
[2:09:40] more there'll be others that will depart
[2:09:46] but that's not our focus there be other
[2:09:51] circumstances other things that will
[2:09:53] come about but lord
[2:10:01] we hear the voice calling us to the
[2:10:07] North Star get back into life get back
[2:10:11] into step
[2:10:13] [Music]
[2:10:17] Lord Paul said I've run I finished my
[2:10:21] course Lord were called in this hour
[2:10:24] there is the finish to finish as runners
[2:10:30] that are part of a relay race every age
[2:10:32] has handed off that baton that baton of
[2:10:36] the word there's been an overlapping in
[2:10:39] every age and the handing off and Lord
[2:10:43] here we are in that final stretch and
[2:10:46] the Scriptures tell us that God having
[2:10:49] provided some better thing for us that
[2:10:51] they without us should not be made
[2:10:53] perfect we feel the responsibility of
[2:10:58] the message of this hour we're not here
[2:11:03] to defend it you already did that but
[2:11:07] it's here Lord God
[2:11:09] the responsibility just to live it
[2:11:15] to live it give everything to run with
[2:11:20] all that's within us
[2:11:22] father I pray here this morning I know
[2:11:25] and soldiers every heart everyone Lord
[2:11:29] knows and I ask that God may the heart
[2:11:34] that could look and say Lord I need that
[2:11:38] absolute in my life I need the
[2:11:43] indwelling of your life I need that
[2:11:45] change in my life Lord to where as the
[2:11:49] example about the man who once had to
[2:11:52] have his mouth gagged and his shipmates
[2:11:54] their ears blocked he found them a
[2:11:58] melody that released him Lord this
[2:12:07] morning may from their heart because
[2:12:10] Lord that's where it must begin he's
[2:12:13] right in the heart
[2:12:15] say Lord my heart I surrender Lord my
[2:12:20] heart Lord and in the life Lord that
[2:12:25] they would say Lord take over Lord kill
[2:12:29] every every sin desire Lord everything
[2:12:33] Lord that's unlike you everything that
[2:12:36] would hinder Lord and lay it aside this
[2:12:39] morning Lord lay it decide I lay it by
[2:12:44] the afford of the word I lay aside every
[2:12:46] way every sin that does so easily be sir
[2:12:50] [Music]
[2:12:52] Lord God from every heart this morning
[2:12:55] said it hard
[2:12:59] I want to be lined with that Northstar
[2:13:05] your God I want not make straight paths
[2:13:10] before my feet I want to follow that
[2:13:13] Northstar with all of my heart when the
[2:13:20] word comes up I want to be I want to
[2:13:23] hear that word I want to see the
[2:13:25] Northstar every service I want to see
[2:13:28] that Northstar so so out through the
[2:13:32] week Monday Tuesday Wednesday I'm
[2:13:34] focused on the North Star first day
[2:13:37] comes along and if there's an area of my
[2:13:39] life that's not lined up with the North
[2:13:41] Star right there it can be lined up with
[2:13:43] the North Star Oh Lord God to every
[2:13:47] fiber of our life is so lined with you
[2:13:51] Lord we need you we need you like the
[2:13:55] simple example I gave the Prophet
[2:13:57] himself was talked about that in the
[2:14:00] message of God he thought he knew which
[2:14:02] way he was going he himself was a guide
[2:14:05] in that country and yet here it was he
[2:14:10] walked around the same area over and
[2:14:15] over and over and over Lord I believe
[2:14:21] there's some hearts here this morning
[2:14:22] the City Lord I'm tired of walking in
[2:14:25] the same area and all I keep coming back
[2:14:28] to is a dead deer hanging I want to go
[2:14:32] on to that place of safety and Lord
[2:14:36] [Music]
[2:14:38] ceptin struck the heart of the Prophet
[2:14:40] and he knew there's a tower appear and
[2:14:43] there's a line from that tower that line
[2:14:46] is just above me but if I can find that
[2:14:51] line that line will take me to where I
[2:14:56] want to go and so Lord he prayed in
[2:15:00] humility he forgot all that he knew
[2:15:02] about being a guide Lord and he prayed
[2:15:06] and he said loud would you let me sing
[2:15:10] that line and about that time he said
[2:15:14] that mist gets separated and he was able
[2:15:19] to see that line Bennett met miss close
[2:15:24] back again but he was able to see that
[2:15:26] line where it was Lord right here this
[2:15:29] morning as you said in the beginning let
[2:15:31] there be light Lord God by the unction
[2:15:33] of the Holy Ghost I say Lord this
[2:15:35] morning let there be light Oh God they
[2:15:39] look for a heart that says Lord I'm
[2:15:42] tired of running around these trees Lord
[2:15:44] and pretending and acting like I know
[2:15:47] what I'm doing I'm tired of that and how
[2:15:53] Lord is the prophet saw it he just
[2:15:56] raised his hand and he kept walking with
[2:15:59] his hands in the air and eventually his
[2:16:03] hand hit that line oh my when it hit
[2:16:07] that line he grabbed it from that point
[2:16:11] on there was a hand over his head he
[2:16:15] might have had to change hands one would
[2:16:17] get tired but he never let go of that
[2:16:19] line and he made it to the destination
[2:16:26] that he wanted to get to Lord
[2:16:31] hands might be getting tired sometimes
[2:16:36] the weariness Lord sets in from the
[2:16:38] trials of this life the testings Lord of
[2:16:42] this life the father may they just
[2:16:46] take the other hand reach up and
[2:16:50] grab that line let the one hand just
[2:16:52] come down and rest for a little bit but
[2:16:56] Lord taking that line and keep on
[2:16:58] walking
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:01] father I ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:17:04] for every young person Lord middle-aged
[2:17:07] old everyone Lord may we keep walking
[2:17:13] for you are our guide
[2:17:17] you're our guide Lord you're our guide

[2:19:53] moment is say the Lord help me to see

[2:20:02] know you ever been driving somewhere and
[2:20:04] you just you kind of come to a place and
[2:20:06] you feel like you know what I probably
[2:20:07] need to stop and ask directions I know
[2:20:11] sometimes we think we got GPS and that's
[2:20:13] all there is to it but believe me GPS
[2:20:15] has put me some places in Cleveland it
[2:20:16] said you arrived and I did not arrive I
[2:20:20] was in a place I needed to get out of

[2:20:28] around and I was sitting in front of
[2:20:29] houses it was not the hospital but you
[2:20:33] know what I had to do I finally go to a
[2:20:36] place maybe a little gas station and
[2:20:39] over a restaurant or pull up next to
[2:20:41] somebody say hey hey
