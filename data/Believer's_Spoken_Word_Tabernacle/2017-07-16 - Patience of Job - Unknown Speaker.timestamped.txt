[45:53] and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[45:56] he committed sins they shall be forgiven
[45:59] him confess your faults one to another
[46:01] and pray one for another that you be may
[46:04] be healed the effectual fervent prayer
[46:07] of a righteous man aileth much Elias was
[46:10] a man subject to like passions as we are
[46:13] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[46:15] not rain and it rained not on Earth by
[46:18] the space of three years and six months
[46:21] and he prayed again and the heavens gave
[46:22] rain and the Earth brought forth her
[46:24] fruit you may be
[46:32] seated
[46:36] job we all know the story of
[46:41] Job And how
[46:44] that in one day such catastrophes fell
[46:50] job he lost all that he
[46:52] had he said job the savans fell and took
[46:57] away all the donkeys in The
[46:59] Oxen and they said
[47:05] the that the calans fell and took away
[47:08] all the camels and when they did they
[47:10] killed all the
[47:11] servants each time a man comes said I
[47:14] alone am am left to come and tell you
[47:17] this
[47:18] news and it said as one would get
[47:21] finished speaking the other would come
[47:24] and it was just one thing right after
[47:26] another you ever been there yes where it
[47:30] seems like it just one thing right after
[47:32] another you get you you get one thing
[47:35] that you maybe you get through that and
[47:37] then there's something else and you and
[47:40] sometimes you look and you say can I get
[47:42] a break yes I'd like to catch my breath
[47:47] yep but we're in a
[47:51] race and you ain't got time to stop and
[47:54] catch your breath
[47:57] brother random said quoting from Hebrews
[48:00] 12 he said lay aside every weight and
[48:02] sin that does so easily beset you and
[48:05] run this race with
[48:09] patience so we're in a
[48:12] race there's no there's no time to to
[48:16] stop there's no time to fall off to the
[48:20] side we're drawing nearer to the
[48:23] end we've seen times in in the past
[48:27] where maybe someone would fall away from
[48:29] the race for a
[48:31] while and then God would speak to him
[48:33] and bring them back but we're drawing
[48:36] near a time when there isn't no more
[48:38] time
[48:39] left for playing
[48:42] around it's time to get down to business
[48:45] with God Amen there's no more time to to
[48:49] fall to the
[48:51] Wayside I remember when I was in the
[48:54] army we had
[48:57] uh we had a run that we did every
[49:00] Friday and uh our platoon Sergeant
[49:04] called it tour of the
[49:05] town and it it was a tour of the Town
[49:08] believe me we ran 10 miles every
[49:12] Friday and there was individuals and it
[49:16] was always the same
[49:19] individuals that they'd make it down the
[49:21] first Hill and when we left the base
[49:24] they'd fall out and while we were
[49:26] completing the Run they walked back up
[49:28] the hill took a shower and got ready for
[49:30] the next
[49:37] formation but it's it's he that endureth
[49:40] to the
[49:42] end this is time for
[49:45] enduring there's there's no time for
[49:48] fooling
[49:50] around and I thank God that he's been
[49:54] merciful
[49:56] yeah was I myself at one time fell from
[49:58] the
[49:59] race but God was
[50:02] merciful and he's been merciful to many
[50:04] of you here thank God for
[50:07] that Hallelujah but now it's time to run
[50:11] it with patience stay with it stay the
[50:15] course finish the race because we're
[50:18] drawing near to the
[50:24] end
[50:32] here was job he was a a prophet anointed
[50:36] of
[50:38] God the only thing job knew knew to do
[50:41] when all these things beel him was to
[50:43] stay with the
[50:45] word and that's the only thing we can do
[50:49] stay with the
[50:51] word job his neighbors came to him said
[50:54] job you know you done done
[50:56] wrong you know you've secretly sinned
[50:59] that's why all these things look look
[51:01] what's all happened to you you you know
[51:03] you've lost everything you
[51:05] had and now you're sitting on an ash
[51:08] Heap covered with boils scraping the
[51:10] boils
[51:15] off you're miserable
[51:19] Joe you've done something
[51:22] wrong but job said no I have not sinned
[51:27] for I have stayed under the Blood of My
[51:32] Sacrifice amen
[51:34] Satan is there to accuse
[51:37] you and say maybe it's something you've
[51:40] done wrong that's why you're going
[51:42] through this trial or that or this
[51:50] suffering but you're under the blood of
[51:52] your
[51:53] sacrifice amen
[51:56] amen If any man sin we've got an
[51:59] advocate with the
[52:00] father amen we know that as the Bible
[52:04] says if any man say sin not then he's a
[52:07] liar we all are human we're subject to
[52:13] mistakes and being human we got to
[52:18] remember that not only are we human but
[52:20] the person next to us is human
[52:23] also amen
[52:29] that's why the scripture says complain
[52:31] not against one
[52:34] another you know that's something that
[52:36] can C if it catches on in the
[52:39] church it's very de it would be very
[52:42] devastating to your
[52:44] services when you got one complaining
[52:46] against
[52:47] another then what happens is they invite
[52:51] a
[52:52] spirit and that Spirit comes in and it
[52:54] finds fault with with everything that
[52:56] other individual
[52:57] does but what we need to do is take a
[53:00] look in the
[53:01] mirror and realize that as God is
[53:04] longsuffering with us the Bible
[53:07] instructs us we're to be longsuffering
[53:10] with one
[53:11] another realize that one another is
[53:13] human instead of complaining pray for
[53:16] one another amen CU I'll tell you
[53:19] something if I'm the elect of God then
[53:22] you're not going to go without me
[53:26] so if I need prayer you better pray for
[53:30] me amen you can say the
[53:33] same if you're the elect of God then
[53:37] this church Ain't Leaving Without You So
[53:39] they better be praying for you we need
[53:42] to pray one for another amen we need to
[53:46] have love brother maram said there were
[53:49] come a time to where the only real love
[53:51] left would be among the people of God
[53:57] that love needs to be displayed that's
[53:59] not filial
[54:03] love that is AG goo love perfect love
[54:08] the angel of the Lord told Brother
[54:09] Brenham no one would go there without it
[54:13] nothing enters without perfect love we
[54:17] need to have that love for one another
[54:19] the Bible says love would cover a
[54:21] multitude of
[54:23] sin why job said pre Adventure my
[54:28] children have sinned I'll offer a
[54:30] sacrifice for
[54:32] them job did all that he know to do we
[54:35] do all we know to
[54:38] do you see a brother or sister in Fault
[54:41] pray for
[54:42] him ask God to
[54:50] intervene sometimes we get in situations
[54:53] where we may feel like like somebody
[54:55] wronged
[55:00] us well this isn't the I'll get back at
[55:04] them
[55:05] thing and it's not to go around telling
[55:08] somebody else I'll tell you what they've
[55:09] done to me I'll tell you what I'm sick
[55:11] of
[55:13] it say brother you ain't never heard
[55:16] nobody say that I beg your
[55:21] pardon but instead we should be praying
[55:23] one for the other
[55:26] that's
[55:27] where strength in your group
[55:36] lies having that Godly love and praying
[55:40] one for another intervening in each
[55:43] one's
[55:52] behalf job said he had not Sinn because
[55:55] because he was coming God's appointed
[55:56] way under the shed Blood Brother R says
[55:58] this in a message of Fellowship then
[56:00] God's obligated to a man who will stand
[56:03] like
[56:04] that let him go right down to the last
[56:07] person even to his wife come out and
[56:10] said job why don't you curse God and die
[56:13] just think his own wife turned against
[56:16] him and because someone will turn
[56:19] against us and think that we're funny
[56:20] and odd all of God's people are funny
[56:23] and odd to the world sure they
[56:25] are you are peculiar people a royal
[56:30] priesthood offering sacrifices to God
[56:33] the fruits of your lips giving praise to
[56:35] his
[56:40] name
[56:42] when these
[56:43] things after they came and told job all
[56:46] these things that had befell his
[56:50] family and his possessions
[56:55] the Bible
[56:56] says
[56:59] that job Rose and rent his manle and
[57:02] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[57:04] the ground and
[57:11] worshiped
[57:12] that job wasn't going by his
[57:16] feelings he wasn't letting his emotions
[57:19] govern him cuz if he had let his
[57:22] emotions govern him he wouldn't have
[57:24] fell down to
[57:27] worship cuz I we have a love for our
[57:33] children and here every one of his
[57:35] children had passed away in a moment's
[57:40] time you think that didn't stir his
[57:42] emotions sure it
[57:45] did but job didn't act out of his
[57:49] emotions he had acted out of his
[57:53] soul what he
[57:55] knew and he worshiped God in the face of
[58:00] all the things that have befell
[58:04] him this is for an example to
[58:08] us and job said naked came I out of my
[58:12] mother's womb and naked shall I return
[58:14] thither the lord gave and the Lord have
[58:16] taken away blessed be the name of the
[58:19] Lord the Bible says in all this job
[58:22] sinned not nor charged God foolishly
[58:37] when we have a loved
[58:40] one that is sealed into the body of
[58:44] Christ and when God takes
[58:48] them it doesn't matter how he takes
[58:53] them
[58:55] there
[58:56] is you know people say well maybe to
[59:01] die without suffering well that's
[59:04] comforting to
[59:06] us but death is
[59:10] death and if it would befall one of us
[59:14] that is here this
[59:16] morning that it would be God's will for
[59:19] us to go on before the
[59:23] resurrection
[59:25] then it doesn't matter how that death
[59:27] comes for
[59:30] us we'll leave just the
[59:32] same but we've got that promise of the
[59:35] Resurrection amen I thank God for that
[59:39] amen
[59:41] amen death brother Braham says is just a
[59:44] carriage God hooks up a horse to it and
[59:46] drags you into
[59:50] Glory it's just as this one song says
[59:53] it's just a doorway to that other
[59:56] Shore we don't fear
[59:59] it but when God takes one of ours it's
[1:00:03] not a time to charge God it's not a time
[1:00:05] to question God why did you take them
[1:00:07] why did you take them in the way you
[1:00:09] took
[1:00:18] them suicide is a horrible
[1:00:21] thing and it's something that among all
[1:00:25] deaths that it's one that we hope that
[1:00:29] none of our loved ones goes by that
[1:00:32] way but it's still
[1:00:37] death some that have suffered from
[1:00:40] losing their love on that way they say
[1:00:41] the suffering is
[1:00:45] harder it's only because of what's in
[1:00:47] your
[1:00:51] mind I know from experience
[1:00:57] I brother randam says in one place he
[1:01:00] said that a person who was born again
[1:01:04] filled with the Holy Ghost could get a
[1:01:09] tormenting
[1:01:11] devil and he said could cause them to go
[1:01:14] completely
[1:01:16] insane he said but that didn't touch
[1:01:19] their
[1:01:22] soul he said it could cause them to go
[1:01:24] completely insane and even take their
[1:01:27] life but that doesn't touch their
[1:01:35] soul it's not a death we'd want to see
[1:01:39] anyone go
[1:01:44] by but it's still
[1:01:53] death
[1:01:58] brother M said God's always faithful
[1:02:00] when we're coming God's provided
[1:02:04] way job never charged God foolishly
[1:02:08] that's where I
[1:02:11] was we're not to charge God
[1:02:19] foolishly in a moment I'll get to
[1:02:21] something where we'll talk about the
[1:02:23] love of God and how you know God loves
[1:02:25] you or
[1:02:28] not as I've had people in the face of of
[1:02:31] a death of a loved one question well
[1:02:32] does God love
[1:02:34] us that isn't how you tell whether God
[1:02:37] loves you or
[1:02:39] not I'll get to that in a
[1:02:42] moment in the message of Fellowship
[1:02:44] brother R said God's always faithful
[1:02:46] when we're coming God's provided way job
[1:02:49] said I've made my confession I have
[1:02:52] burned the offering that's exactly what
[1:02:55] God required he worshiped God under the
[1:02:57] shed
[1:02:58] blood and all of a sudden then the
[1:03:00] spirit Came Upon the prophet and the
[1:03:02] Thunders roared and the Lightnings
[1:03:06] flashed now he had had what we call
[1:03:09] job's comforters brother B also called
[1:03:11] them his
[1:03:13] neighbors we could call them his
[1:03:15] Brethren from the
[1:03:21] church and they came to him and they
[1:03:26] thought they were coming to help
[1:03:28] him but instead they were trying to find
[1:03:32] somewhere some fault something that
[1:03:34] would tell them why God had done this to
[1:03:41] job brother bam says that's a
[1:03:45] mistake every son that cometh to God
[1:03:48] will be
[1:03:50] tried and that was what was happening to
[1:03:53] joob
[1:03:55] but
[1:03:58] job says once that you know job waited
[1:04:03] until impatiently until job didn't have
[1:04:07] a
[1:04:09] Bible job knew God by Revelation by
[1:04:15] Vision he didn't have a Bible to go to
[1:04:18] like we
[1:04:23] have
[1:04:25] and so
[1:04:26] job waited patiently through all of this
[1:04:31] he endured
[1:04:33] it and in the end God came and brought a
[1:04:37] revelation to
[1:04:39] job and he
[1:04:42] said I know that my redeemer liveth
[1:04:46] Hallelujah and though the skin worms may
[1:04:49] devour this body yet in my flesh shall I
[1:04:52] see God
[1:04:55] and not another but I shall see
[1:05:01] God we need to wait patiently until God
[1:05:05] reveals and God will show you many times
[1:05:08] when you're going through being tried
[1:05:10] going through a time of suffering you
[1:05:12] don't know why you're suffering you
[1:05:14] don't know why this has come on you you
[1:05:16] don't know why it's befallen
[1:05:19] you job didn't
[1:05:23] know that Satan had come before almighty
[1:05:27] God and and God he didn't know that God
[1:05:31] had been bragging on
[1:05:35] [Applause]
[1:05:39] him so all these things Begin to Fall
[1:05:42] him because God was bragging on him and
[1:05:45] Satan said back that
[1:05:48] up brother R said Satan took a
[1:05:52] notion I I believe there's times when
[1:05:54] he's tooken oce in our
[1:05:58] lives but he said you got a hedge around
[1:06:00] him said lift that hedge and I'll cause
[1:06:03] him to curse your
[1:06:04] name job didn't know all these things
[1:06:07] that happened he didn't understand that
[1:06:10] that had been what had happened until
[1:06:13] later when God revealed it to him when
[1:06:16] it was all said and
[1:06:18] done and that's the way it is when we're
[1:06:20] going through a time of suffering we
[1:06:24] don't know why that we're
[1:06:27] suffering but friends it's don't think
[1:06:30] it's because you've done something
[1:06:35] wrong if you done something wrong
[1:06:38] believe me it'll end up coming across
[1:06:39] the
[1:06:41] pulpit you don't have to worry about
[1:06:45] that God has a way of exposing our lives
[1:06:49] from from the pull pit in such a way we
[1:06:51] think everybody sitting around us knows
[1:06:53] exactly that he was talking about
[1:06:57] us that's just God's
[1:07:00] way so God's not going to bring some
[1:07:02] suffering on you when you are under the
[1:07:04] shed
[1:07:06] blood doing all you can to live for God
[1:07:09] he's not going to bring suffering on
[1:07:10] because you're doing something
[1:07:12] wrong but he allows suffering to come
[1:07:15] because it's through suffering that we
[1:07:18] are made
[1:07:20] perfect and we must with patience endure
[1:07:24] it until the end then God will show us
[1:07:28] why we went through that now there may
[1:07:30] be things I don't know I've thought
[1:07:32] there may be things that I won't know
[1:07:34] the why until we get on the other
[1:07:52] side pardon
[1:07:57] me I preached a funeral one
[1:08:01] time of a six- week old
[1:08:04] child was just 6 weeks
[1:08:07] old it had been abused until the abuse
[1:08:10] killed
[1:08:14] it and I had to preach his
[1:08:19] funeral and I said every life to every
[1:08:23] life there's a
[1:08:25] purpose and the prophet said that you
[1:08:28] don't leave here until that purpose has
[1:08:30] been
[1:08:32] fulfilled and I said what could have
[1:08:34] been the purpose of a child just six
[1:08:37] weeks
[1:08:39] old well I can tell you
[1:08:42] this it gave that that man and that
[1:08:46] woman an opportunity to do right or do
[1:08:51] wrong and I'll tell you they'll be
[1:08:53] judged by God for what they
[1:09:01] did Brother Ram said it doesn't matter
[1:09:06] if the child is born from the meanest
[1:09:09] parents in the
[1:09:11] city he said when babies die they go to
[1:09:20] heaven had someone challenge me on that
[1:09:23] one one time and I don't know why they
[1:09:25] challenged me brother Brown said it you
[1:09:26] believe brother brown or you don't but
[1:09:29] they challenged me on it they didn't
[1:09:30] believe that they said what if that
[1:09:33] baby's serpent seed I said isn't that
[1:09:35] something no serpent seed babies ever
[1:09:39] die well that's the way I'd look at
[1:09:43] it because brother random said all
[1:09:45] babies to die go to
[1:09:48] heaven so that's
[1:09:50] simple I just believe what he said
[1:09:54] that's good and that was the Comfort I
[1:09:57] gave to the grandparents of that young
[1:10:01] child and I preach it like that even
[1:10:03] though that the mother of that child who
[1:10:06] had had been involved in doing these
[1:10:08] things was sitting right there at the
[1:10:09] funeral I still preach it that
[1:10:17] way sometimes that's got me into
[1:10:21] trouble because I preach what God puts
[1:10:23] on my heart regardless of who's sitting
[1:10:27] there I'll say what God tells me to say
[1:10:31] let the chips fall where they may
[1:10:40] right theam says and I've heard but now
[1:10:42] I see he says and now this man being a
[1:10:45] prophet he had access to God's
[1:10:48] grace but job didn't have a bible to
[1:10:51] read the Bible wasn't wrote then he
[1:10:53] actually access to God was by Revelation
[1:10:55] and by Vision that was before the Bible
[1:10:57] was written and now we find out take
[1:10:59] some of his life when God blessed him
[1:11:02] and made him a great man while even
[1:11:04] everybody respected him even to his
[1:11:06] wisdom had become so great his
[1:11:09] inspiration from God had Vindicated him
[1:11:11] to be God's servant so plainly until the
[1:11:14] people come from everywhere to hear him
[1:11:17] and then Satan began to accuse that
[1:11:20] man that's the way he does every inspire
[1:11:23] servant of God Satan's always there to
[1:11:26] accuse him of everything that he does
[1:11:29] that's not
[1:11:36] right he's the accuser of the
[1:11:40] Brethren and he's there to accuse every
[1:11:42] servant of
[1:11:45] God so don't don't think your case is uh
[1:11:51] odd or peculiar you're not the only one
[1:11:56] facing sometimes we think that the thing
[1:11:59] we're facing no one else has ever faced
[1:12:01] it that's not
[1:12:06] true to to think that we got a priest
[1:12:11] were thinking very small with a small
[1:12:13] mind because there's a great big world
[1:12:15] out there and I'm here to tell testify
[1:12:18] that God's got children all around the
[1:12:21] world not just here in this name
[1:12:27] I tell you what I can't wait until that
[1:12:30] day when we can fellowship and be able
[1:12:32] to speak and understand one
[1:12:35] another now a few of us maybe are
[1:12:38] bilingual and can understand some now
[1:12:41] but you don't know every language in the
[1:12:44] world but you'll build a fellowship with
[1:12:47] brothers and sisters from all around
[1:12:48] this world and you won't have to worry
[1:12:50] about because we'll all be speaking the
[1:12:52] same language
[1:12:54] hallelujah
[1:12:56] hallelujah only reason we speak
[1:12:58] different languages because somebody got
[1:13:01] a notion to build a tower one
[1:13:16] time now we find out his life and trials
[1:13:20] and his great
[1:13:21] faith the Bible even says have you not
[1:13:24] read of the patience of Job Faith Waits
[1:13:27] with patience for the promised word to
[1:13:30] be fulfilled amen Faith Waits with
[1:13:34] patience for the promised word to be
[1:13:49] fulfilled it says in the message of
[1:13:51] Fellowship said now notice job righteous
[1:13:53] man godly man everything against him one
[1:13:56] day Satan took an otion that's what I
[1:13:59] mentioned to you earlier Satan took a
[1:14:02] notion to make him deny
[1:14:05] God and when he did no matter what was
[1:14:08] going on how much he was persecuted how
[1:14:11] much he was called that he was on the
[1:14:14] wrong path job stayed pat on the word I
[1:14:17] like that he said pre Aventure my
[1:14:20] children have sin I'll offer a sacrifice
[1:14:22] for them
[1:14:23] now the only thing that man knew was the
[1:14:26] burnt offering that was God's
[1:14:28] requirement many people think sometimes
[1:14:31] because disaster happens to a Christian
[1:14:33] old he got off the will of God they left
[1:14:35] the church they went
[1:14:37] out sometimes that's not right because
[1:14:39] God chastens every son that comes to him
[1:14:42] he cleanses him purges him and tries him
[1:14:45] to see if he will
[1:14:49] stand he tries us to see if we'll stand
[1:14:52] as I said said on Wednesday night he
[1:14:54] already knows we're going to he just
[1:14:56] wants to watch us do
[1:15:00] it he God was proud of
[1:15:07] job recall how he said it in the
[1:15:10] scripture he
[1:15:11] said have you considered my servant job
[1:15:14] there is none like him in all the
[1:15:17] land that was Papa
[1:15:19] God sticking his chest out there really
[1:15:22] proud of his
[1:15:24] [Music]

[1:15:32] you I look out across this congregation
[1:15:34] and I see individuals that I've

[1:16:37] of
[1:16:41] Job when I first announced the title I'm
[1:16:44] sure you thought
[1:16:46] my how could I ever measure up to that
[1:16:50] the patience of

[1:16:58] name I'm
[1:17:03] sorry but you've
[1:17:22] endured
[1:17:25] brother R says and glorified Jesus said
[1:17:27] job noted for his
[1:17:29] endurance holding out in the face of
[1:17:33] opposition his neighbors coming around
[1:17:36] saying see you got some sickness now

[1:18:20] contrary and any that cannot bear those
[1:18:23] things are illegitimate children and not
[1:18:26] the children of
[1:18:28] God if a man ever saw him in his heart
[1:18:32] knowing Jesus raised for his
[1:18:34] justification accepted the same on the
[1:18:37] basis of the blood and the word put
[1:18:40] trials upon him nothing can separate us
[1:18:42] from the love of God that's in Christ
[1:18:45] Jesus Remember that true this isn't
[1:18:49] anything that it is not speaking that
[1:18:52] you've been set separated from God's
[1:18:57] love those who he called he is Justified
[1:19:01] and those he's Justified he's already

[1:21:07] day as Abraham had endured that there
[1:21:10] was three men that come to visit

[1:21:18] Abraham Abraham knew they were more than
[1:21:20] just men true where one was almighty God
[1:21:26] and the other two were Angels

[1:24:02] verse
[1:24:21] 9-1
[1:24:26] I Know Thy
[1:24:27] works and
[1:24:29] tribulation and
[1:24:35] poverty I Know Thy Works thy tribulation
[1:24:38] and
[1:24:40] poverty but thou are rich and I know the
[1:24:43] blasphemy of them that say they are Jews
[1:24:46] and are not but are the synagogue of
[1:24:49] Satan fear none of these things which
[1:24:51] Thou shalt suffer
[1:24:53] uer behold the devil shall cast some of
[1:24:55] you into prison that you may be tried
[1:24:59] and you shall have tribulation 10
[1:25:01] days be thou faithful unto death and I
[1:25:05] will give thee a Crown of
[1:25:07] Life he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:25:10] what the spirit saith to the
[1:25:13] churches he that overcome shall not be
[1:25:16] hurt of the second
[1:25:19] death God didn't tell them they weren't
[1:25:22] going to
[1:25:23] die he told him that some of them were
[1:25:26] going to be offered
[1:25:28] up but he said for them to endure
[1:25:32] it he said I know you have tribulations
[1:25:35] but did he take the tribulations from
[1:25:37] them no he said I know of your
[1:25:40] sufferings but did he stop the
[1:25:42] sufferings
[1:25:46] no did he prevent their lives from being
[1:25:49] taken no but he said
[1:25:52] if they would
[1:25:54] endure amen be
[1:25:57] faithful unto
[1:25:59] death that they wouldn't have to fear
[1:26:02] the second
[1:26:04] death what's the second death it's after
[1:26:08] the resurrection when all are come up
[1:26:09] before the white Throne judgment to be
[1:26:13] judged and those that are not found
[1:26:15] worthy suffer the second death Eternal
[1:26:18] separation from
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:32] I brother B says this in the submer
[1:26:34] church age in church age book I know
[1:26:35] your
[1:26:37] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[1:26:40] your
[1:26:41] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[1:26:44] to so many
[1:26:45] people like Israel they wondered if God
[1:26:48] really loves them how can God be just in
[1:26:52] and loving if he stands by and watches
[1:26:54] his people
[1:26:56] suffer that's what they asked in Malachi
[1:26:59] the burden of the word of the Lord to to
[1:27:02] Israel by Malachi I have loved you
[1:27:05] sayeth the Lord yet we say you say
[1:27:09] wherein hast thou loved
[1:27:11] us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith
[1:27:14] the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated
[1:27:18] Esau and laid his mountains and his
[1:27:20] Heritage to waste for the dragons of the
[1:27:23] Wilderness you see they could not figure
[1:27:26] out God's love they thought God's love
[1:27:29] meant no suffering they thought that the
[1:27:33] love meant a baby with parental
[1:27:37] care but God said that his love was
[1:27:41] elective
[1:27:43] love the proof of his love is
[1:27:48] election amen it's not whether you
[1:27:50] suffer or don't suffer
[1:27:53] it's not how good things go for you or
[1:27:55] how bad things go for you it's not how
[1:27:58] much possessions you have for you can
[1:28:01] lose it
[1:28:03] all it's
[1:28:05] not worldly Goods that you've been
[1:28:07] blessed
[1:28:09] with but it's election that's God's
[1:28:12] proof of his love to you he has called
[1:28:16] you he has chose
[1:28:21] you
[1:28:23] Hallelujah why because God knew when the
[1:28:26] choice would be put to you God knew what
[1:28:30] you would choose and therefore by forn
[1:28:34] knowledge he could predestinate
[1:28:39] you he says through
[1:28:43] Paul quotes this again from
[1:28:46] melachi Paul does and
[1:28:49] says Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[1:28:52] have I hated before either boy was born
[1:28:54] the Bible says that the election of God
[1:28:56] might stand
[1:29:00] sure the proof of his love is election
[1:29:03] that no matter what happens his love was
[1:29:07] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:29:09] chosen unto
[1:29:10] salvation because God had chosen you to
[1:29:13] Salvation through sanctification of the
[1:29:15] spirit and belief of the truth he may
[1:29:19] commit you to death as he did Paul he
[1:29:22] may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:29:24] job that is his prerogative he is
[1:29:28] Sovereign but is all with a purpose if
[1:29:33] he did not have a purpose then he would
[1:29:36] be the author of frustration and not of
[1:29:38] Peace his purpose is that after we have
[1:29:42] suffered a while we would be made
[1:29:45] perfect established strengthened and
[1:29:47] settled as job said he put strength in
[1:29:51] US
[1:29:52] us amen he himself suffered he learned
[1:29:57] obedience by the things he
[1:29:59] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[1:30:02] the things that he suffered then he
[1:30:05] quotes Hebrews
[1:30:07] 58-9 though he were a son yet learned he
[1:30:11] obedience by the things which he
[1:30:12] suffered and being made perfect became
[1:30:15] the author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:30:18] them that obey him in plain language the
[1:30:22] very character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:30:31] suffering how's our character going to
[1:30:33] be
[1:30:34] perfected by
[1:30:40] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:30:43] left a church a measure of
[1:30:45] suffering listen that they too by their
[1:30:50] faith in God while suffering for him
[1:30:53] would come to a place of
[1:31:03] perfection we can count it
[1:31:06] glorious in the midst of our suffering
[1:31:09] we can worship like job did in the midst
[1:31:13] of our
[1:31:14] suffering why because we know that as it
[1:31:19] perfected the character of Jesus so
[1:31:22] shall it perfect our
[1:31:26] character this is character perfecting
[1:31:36] time we live in a world of
[1:31:41] Sorrow we live in a world of pain of
[1:31:47] hurt not just God's
[1:31:50] people
[1:31:54] it is a world of Sorrow this world has
[1:31:57] nothing to offer
[1:32:01] us but it is a time of perfecting our
[1:32:06] character because friends once the
[1:32:08] Rapture takes place and we're caught up
[1:32:11] to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:32:13] there's no more perfecting of character
[1:32:16] it must be done by then that's
[1:32:19] true the millennium
[1:32:22] is not about building your character
[1:32:24] it's got to already be there that's
[1:32:26] right because in the Millennium you'll
[1:32:29] be
[1:32:34] rulers now is the
[1:32:39] time why did he did he want this brother
[1:32:42] Brenham ask then he quotes from James 1
[1:32:46] 2-4 my brethren count it all joy when
[1:32:49] you fall into divers Temptations knowing
[1:32:52] this that the Trine of your faith
[1:32:55] worketh
[1:32:56] patience but let patience have her
[1:32:58] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:33:01] tire and wanting
[1:33:12] nothing brother Ram said job went down
[1:33:15] in the
[1:33:18] harness he was enduring job didn't sit
[1:33:21] down
[1:33:22] job was
[1:33:28] enduring he said Abraham went down in
[1:33:31] the
[1:33:34] harness you know what you y'all know
[1:33:37] what that
[1:33:47] means went down in the harness they were
[1:33:50] working
[1:33:52] they were
[1:33:54] serving they were busy about God's
[1:33:57] business they were
[1:34:08] enduring said Isaac went down in the
[1:34:11] harness Joseph went down in the
[1:34:15] harness that's the way we're going to
[1:34:20] go
[1:34:25] we're not going to have time for a
[1:34:28] breather as I said early
[1:34:33] on I can remember going through some
[1:34:35] hard
[1:34:36] trials that I thought were hard at the
[1:34:38] time when I first went down to Pastor in
[1:34:45] Dixon and I thought it was so
[1:34:50] hard I felt like I was going to
[1:34:54] break and I remember praying and said
[1:34:57] God
[1:34:59] I can you let up a little
[1:35:04] bit give me a chance to catch my
[1:35:09] breath well that didn't
[1:35:11] happen and the next one got
[1:35:14] harder and the next one got
[1:35:18] harder but the thing about it was is the
[1:35:20] next one got harder the one in the past
[1:35:23] looked like well that wasn't so hard
[1:35:24] after
[1:35:26] all what happened there was a
[1:35:31] growth there was a
[1:35:34] growth there was a building of and
[1:35:37] perfecting of
[1:35:39] character that's the way it is with you
[1:35:41] you can look back see things you've went
[1:35:44] through that at the time seem
[1:35:46] devastating some of you face diseases of
[1:35:50] death and it was devastating but you can
[1:35:54] where you stand now look back at that
[1:35:56] and see how God brought you through it
[1:35:58] and you said that wasn't so
[1:36:02] bad but then you face something
[1:36:07] else what's
[1:36:09] happening that's him perfecting your
[1:36:11] character he's building it you're
[1:36:17] growing you're making
[1:36:20] progress
[1:36:22] yeah like
[1:36:24] a one statement I heard down the South
[1:36:28] said said uh they were under a certain
[1:36:32] pastorship that turned out later to not
[1:36:36] even end up believing the
[1:36:38] message it said they drove down a Stak
[1:36:41] and 10 years later they were still
[1:36:42] standing by
[1:36:44] it meaning they hadn't made any
[1:36:48] progress but we're making progress
[1:36:53] that's why that the ones behind
[1:36:56] us we've growing through
[1:36:59] that and we look back and we say what
[1:37:02] I'm going through now is harder than
[1:37:06] that guess what the next one's going to
[1:37:08] be harder than
[1:37:13] that but there's coming a
[1:37:16] day just like job
[1:37:19] said I'm know my redeemer liveth
[1:37:23] hallelujah amen and there's coming a day
[1:37:27] that I'm going to see
[1:37:29] God
[1:37:32] hallelujah and not another for me but I
[1:37:35] myself Shall Behold
[1:37:47] Him Joseph went down in the
[1:37:50] harness remember what Joseph
[1:37:54] said he said don't bury me
[1:38:01] here Joseph had a revelation that had
[1:38:05] been passed down through the
[1:38:08] family Abraham was was the first in that
[1:38:13] family to catch the
[1:38:15] Revelation and Abraham went and asked to
[1:38:20] buy a certain place lot of
[1:38:22] land a
[1:38:27] cave to where he would bury Sarah
[1:38:31] there when Abraham died Isaac took
[1:38:34] Abraham and buried him
[1:38:36] there when Isaac died they took Isaac
[1:38:39] and buried him
[1:38:43] there Jacob also told him don't bury me
[1:38:48] here and they still had the liberty of
[1:38:51] at that time to take Jacob and go bury
[1:38:55] him in the same place that Sarah Abraham
[1:38:59] and Isaac had been
[1:39:03] buried the prophet said it was the same
[1:39:06] place job had been
[1:39:08] buried and they had each got the
[1:39:11] Revelation that job had
[1:39:16] Hallelujah I know my redeemer
[1:39:19] liveth and there is a Beyond this life
[1:39:22] there is a Resurrection coming and I
[1:39:25] will be part of that
[1:39:34] Resurrection Joseph don't bury me down
[1:39:37] here bear me up here with my fathers
[1:39:41] bear me the way they were buried the
[1:39:43] word the plane they was buried in the
[1:39:46] place they were buried in that's the
[1:39:48] same thing for me that's the reason I
[1:39:51] want to be buried in the name of
[1:39:58] Jesus I want to be buried in the name of
[1:40:00] Jesus the prophet
[1:40:02] said for those that are in Christ will
[1:40:06] God bring with him when he
[1:40:09] comes
[1:40:11] hallelujah praise the Lord buried in the
[1:40:15] name of
[1:40:17] Jesus I'll tell you something
[1:40:19] friends
[1:40:22] it's important what name you're buried
[1:40:25] under it's important how you're
[1:40:29] buried whether random said somebody said
[1:40:31] to me oh it doesn't make a difference he
[1:40:32] said yeah yes it does it does make a
[1:40:38] difference buried in the name of
[1:40:46] Jesus I've shared with
[1:40:49] you recent trial that my family had went
[1:41:01] through one of the young girls we'
[1:41:03] adopted accused my son of some
[1:41:08] things my son
[1:41:10] Nathaniel because and this is what she
[1:41:13] ended up telling the guardian that the
[1:41:16] court appointed to
[1:41:17] her and she also told the lawyer the co
[1:41:20] accorded to her she said I
[1:41:23] lie because I wanted to wear pants and
[1:41:27] makeup and cut my hair and they wouldn't
[1:41:30] let
[1:41:31] me I want to be like the other kids at
[1:41:35] school and she told him she
[1:41:38] lied we went through a trial for that
[1:41:40] for a whole
[1:41:45] year the trial in it for me
[1:41:48] was it was my son
[1:41:53] and I didn't want his name smeared by
[1:41:55] some
[1:41:59] lie and for what a
[1:42:03] purpose but God has a
[1:42:08] way
[1:42:11] and they finally decided in the court
[1:42:15] they would send my son to a psychiatrist
[1:42:19] for an evaluation
[1:42:22] and it's it's called a psychosexual
[1:42:26] evaluation and there's some
[1:42:29] pretty uh personal questions and things
[1:42:32] they
[1:42:34] ask and he went and endured
[1:42:38] that and at the end the psychiatrist
[1:42:42] said there's no way possible he could
[1:42:44] have done the things he was accused
[1:42:47] of he said it's not in
[1:42:49] him
[1:42:53] I thought if she just said she lied
[1:42:55] that'd be the end of it but it wasn't
[1:42:57] God wanted
[1:43:03] proof and before that happened my wife
[1:43:05] and I talk what were we going to do with
[1:43:10] her after this was all said and
[1:43:15] done that psychiatrist told my son said
[1:43:18] don't ever get around her again in your
[1:43:22] life and we had my wife and I we we
[1:43:27] treated her well even through that year
[1:43:29] that she lived with we never treated her
[1:43:31] wrong we never treated her
[1:43:34] evil we treated her
[1:43:39] good that Christmas she got gifts just
[1:43:42] like everybody
[1:43:44] else even though my son and half my
[1:43:48] family couldn't be there for that
[1:43:49] Christmas
[1:43:53] but I knew the family was never going to
[1:43:56] be mended as long as she was with
[1:44:00] us and we thought of different things
[1:44:03] what we might do put her in the boarding
[1:44:06] school or do different things we were
[1:44:08] thinking what how were we going to do
[1:44:09] this somehow we had to reunite the
[1:44:12] family and we prayed and ask God for
[1:44:19] guidance and then
[1:44:21] she ran away from
[1:44:25] home was involved in the theft of two
[1:44:32] cars total out one of the
[1:44:36] cars and was
[1:44:38] with three other uh
[1:44:43] teenagers and they then by this time
[1:44:47] realized the law was going to be evident
[1:44:48] so they were on their way to Fleet to to
[1:44:52] the
[1:44:56] Carolinas we didn't know what had
[1:44:58] happened we didn't know I didn't know
[1:45:00] until about 10:30 that morning the
[1:45:02] school called me and said your daughter
[1:45:05] wasn't at
[1:45:08] school and so we I called my wife we
[1:45:11] begin to search find out where was she
[1:45:15] finally realized there was nothing else
[1:45:18] she had ran away so we reported it that
[1:45:21] way to the
[1:45:25] officer that the officer told us by
[1:45:28] doing that that we wouldn't be liable
[1:45:30] for anything she
[1:45:32] did and so anyway the police found her
[1:45:37] brought her back home it was about 3:00
[1:45:38] in the morning when they got her back
[1:45:42] home and you know she had on makeup and
[1:45:47] pants and all this and she comes in no
[1:45:51] it wasn't pants maybe it was pants or
[1:45:53] shorts something I can't remember
[1:45:56] now I looked at her and said you got
[1:45:58] school in the morning go get cleaned up
[1:46:00] and go to
[1:46:04] bed the only thing that we said to her
[1:46:07] about it was now you're going to have to
[1:46:10] go and appear in
[1:46:13] court and
[1:46:15] so when the date come that we had to
[1:46:18] take her to
[1:46:19] court
[1:46:21] the
[1:46:21] same prosecuting attorney that had been
[1:46:25] in the case of my son was the same
[1:46:26] prosecuting attorney that was there for
[1:46:29] her
[1:46:30] case and the prosecutor got up and said
[1:46:33] due to the things that she suffered she
[1:46:37] thought she should be took into State's
[1:46:39] custody and
[1:46:42] evaluated so they took her from us that
[1:46:44] day and put her in State's
[1:46:48] custody once she got into state custody
[1:46:50] she told him she didn't want to come
[1:46:53] back to
[1:46:56] us we had to go through this whole thing
[1:46:58] with children's services and I tell you
[1:47:01] what I pray for anyone that goes through
[1:47:04] that if you're ever going through it get
[1:47:06] word to me somehow I'll be in prayer for
[1:47:12] you but I sat there and told her from
[1:47:14] the first day I said well I don't want
[1:47:16] her
[1:47:18] back she's in your custody now out I'm
[1:47:21] fine with
[1:47:23] that she don't want to be back
[1:47:25] anyhow if you bring her back she's just
[1:47:27] going to run away
[1:47:29] again and I wanted my family
[1:47:32] reunited and I looked at it and I told
[1:47:34] my wife I said this is the hand of
[1:47:36] God we were looking for what was the
[1:47:39] answer I said but God had the
[1:47:44] answer in the middle of April this year
[1:47:48] we went before the judge and signed find
[1:47:50] away our perennial
[1:47:54] rights and they put her up for
[1:47:57] adoption that's what her wishes was
[1:48:00] that's what she
[1:48:01] wanted they told us that the family
[1:48:05] that she had been placed with was
[1:48:08] already considering adopting
[1:48:14] her God knew what he was
[1:48:18] doing we couldn't see it at the start of
[1:48:21] all we couldn't see how it was going to
[1:48:23] come out it looked like it would be
[1:48:27] impossible but God did it in such a way
[1:48:30] that it cleared my son
[1:48:33] completely and
[1:48:36] then she got her
[1:48:40] wish and then my family was
[1:48:44] reunited and we were able to have a
[1:48:48] Christmas
[1:48:49] together we hadn't been able to have
[1:48:51] birthdays together
[1:48:53] Christmases fourth of July's Memorial
[1:48:55] days Labor Days no
[1:49:01] holidays it was a blessing to have the
[1:49:03] family back together
[1:49:05] again but my point is God knew what he
[1:49:09] was doing and he knew how to do
[1:49:11] it I tried to intervene a couple of
[1:49:14] different times didn't do no good and
[1:49:17] then I finally said Lord there's nothing
[1:49:20] I can
[1:49:21] do if there was I'd do
[1:49:23] it but God took care of
[1:49:29] it I don't care what you're going
[1:49:33] through you may look at it and say I
[1:49:36] don't see why or the how or what someone
[1:49:42] told me
[1:49:45] once when their brother had died from
[1:49:48] suicide they said what good could come
[1:49:51] from
[1:49:52] this the same individual that said that
[1:49:55] later gave his life to
[1:50:07] God I don't know what good will come
[1:50:11] from the things we go through but I know
[1:50:13] that all things work together for the
[1:50:15] good of them that love the
[1:50:17] Lord that are the called
