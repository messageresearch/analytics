[40:12] [Music]
[40:21] [Music]
[40:31] [Music]
[40:37] what a promise what a promise
[40:42] they managed to think that by God's
[40:44] grace I believe I'm one of them that in
[40:49] this age in this hour where that promise
[40:51] has been has been unfolded and has been
[40:55] spoken of even all the way from the Old
[40:59] Testament all the shadows and types that
[41:02] are within there but then to see it
[41:03] spoken in this hour Paul ministered that
[41:06] but yet within it God by His grace how
[41:11] that we would be able would be partakers
[41:14] of witnessing this promise coming to
[41:17] pass and yet if Paul and all of those
[41:20] before had not ran faithful to what God
[41:23] had revealed to them we would not be
[41:25] ruined so with so they without us cannot
[41:29] be made perfect but you know what what
[41:32] what good does the heads don't do if
[41:33] there's no pyramid to set on a mint so
[41:36] it all works together for the edifying
[41:38] is God who's been moving down through
[41:41] time don't you loving this morning it's
[41:44] just so so good to be in the house of
[41:45] the Lord and I know there's so many
[41:48] different needs and we see different
[41:51] ones of you I know that we're back
[41:53] different ones that are meant to say
[41:54] that brother Dominic sister Julia back
[41:56] with us on Thursday they were going last
[41:57] weekend and we missed y'all and see
[42:00] different ones and we got sickness that
[42:02] goes around right now and you know my
[42:04] wife was out two weeks ago and and then
[42:06] you know thought that she was just
[42:08] defeating that thing and then even
[42:10] Zachary and and so they were pretty bad
[42:13] off and in the week here and so we just
[42:18] thank God though that for his touch you
[42:21] know sometimes we we go through those
[42:23] things and how she takes it a whole lot
[42:25] better than I did
[42:25] I mean I'd rather be the fellow that
[42:30] that just gets it Lord just if you're
[42:31] gonna if she had just give it to me if
[42:33] she just makes that house run
[42:36] she just makes it run this makes
[42:38] everything just go just right you know
[42:40] there's nobody can make a sandwich like
[42:42] my wife I can take the same ingredients
[42:45] and put them on bread brother Carlos
[42:47] they don't taste a thing so that's why I
[42:50] asked her say honey would you mind
[42:51] making me a turkey sandwich it they so
[42:53] good I think it's maybe just her touch a
[42:55] little bit of love goes in it you know
[42:56] something but I just heard you miss her
[43:01] this morning and want to say that just
[43:04] to mention to you remember the upcoming
[43:07] services we have here with brother
[43:08] George Smith on January 11th that's a
[43:11] Thursday evening and then on the Friday
[43:14] evening the 12th at 7 o'clock and
[43:18] there's just some things that I really
[43:20] just would have on my heart I really
[43:23] want brother George to be just share not
[43:25] only things that are taking place
[43:26] currently but I really want him to also
[43:29] share that insight that that God allowed
[43:32] him to have he has a real a real good
[43:35] angle into that on in brother Rams life
[43:37] and I want him to be able to share that
[43:39] and just seeing how things will will
[43:43] will go out let me just I'll stay in
[43:45] contact with you about it but if there
[43:48] are things that questions so forth that
[43:52] cuz I wafer there's any questions I'd
[43:54] like to get those to brother George
[43:55] beforehand and that's kind of the
[43:57] direction I have for that Friday night
[43:59] service because I usually sometimes I've
[44:03] been in situations where in different
[44:05] places sometimes overseas and things
[44:07] like getting they do have questions and
[44:08] answers and sometimes you get things
[44:10] I've been in youth meetings and and then
[44:12] things always make me nervous
[44:13] questions and answered I'd rather preach
[44:15] any day written questions and answers'
[44:16] you there were a lot of questions and
[44:17] answers I don't I don't like questions
[44:19] and answers so much on the spot because
[44:20] I like to be very thorough and an answer
[44:23] I try to be as great as much as I can
[44:25] but I want to I want if the Lord will
[44:29] help us be able to maybe do that on that
[44:31] Friday but I you know sometimes you can
[44:34] get into real some real things or people
[44:35] popping up and asking questions they
[44:38] would like to try to if we can get
[44:40] anything ahead of time you know with
[44:41] that we'll just kind of see I'm gonna
[44:43] I'm gonna talk with brother George here
[44:45] a little bit more as we as we're
[44:47] approaching that
[44:48] also prayer meeting this coming this
[44:51] coming Tuesday here at 6:30 p.m. and
[44:54] I'll tell you what the Lord I know I
[44:56] know not everyone is able to be here and
[44:59] say especially you know those of that
[45:01] that are are driving a distance but I
[45:03] certainly appreciate everybody joining
[45:05] together in that time in prayer and you
[45:07] know maybe sometimes there's things that
[45:09] comes up at 6:30 or something even for
[45:10] those of you that are away but even if
[45:13] on your heart you can just you know have
[45:16] some time that day or that time to make
[45:18] it a real special time just for
[45:19] different needs I'll tell you right now
[45:21] the Lord has has been answering prayer
[45:26] and it's not just just as a recent but
[45:29] we just see things how that God even in
[45:32] these these times that would come
[45:33] together we've had testimonies that come
[45:36] right just the very next service right
[45:38] after that others we're still praying
[45:41] and we're still believing and still
[45:43] trusting the Lord but it's a wonderful
[45:45] opportunity to be able to to come
[45:48] together and just approach and these
[45:49] take these needs before the throne of
[45:51] God and I'm so glad that God has given
[45:53] us that opportunity so those of you that
[45:55] may not be able to be here from a
[45:57] distance but you're here you're joining
[45:59] with us in prayer and in heart and we
[46:03] just our work because we're together and
[46:05] we're just we see God moving and just
[46:08] just a wonderful thing I also remember
[46:10] as their prayer request was given about
[46:12] those who be traveling different young
[46:14] people and as they're traveling in from
[46:17] that the winter youth retreat no doubt
[46:19] going so many different directions and
[46:21] also talked to his brother Dave earlier
[46:23] this morning and by the Dave kress and
[46:26] he had asked you know just to greet you
[46:29] all and to thank you or your your
[46:32] prayers and your love and your support
[46:34] sister crest she's he's week right now
[46:37] and they're trying to get the infection
[46:40] under control in her lungs you remember
[46:45] a week ago on well is right before a
[46:48] week ago last Friday when she went in to
[46:51] when her hip had come out again think it
[46:53] was a fifth time that her hip has come
[46:55] out and so Lord willing what they're
[46:59] wanting to do is put in that
[47:01] that permanent ball in there or the
[47:04] socket and that's something that it just
[47:08] be fused in there there was that who
[47:11] that that is something that they are
[47:13] planning on doing but before they can do
[47:15] that they need to get the infection
[47:17] cleared out of her lungs because when
[47:18] she was under that anesthesia
[47:22] last Friday even though they had waited
[47:25] the period of time you know for that to
[47:28] be cleared out of her system food and
[47:29] stuff like that there was some
[47:31] aspiration so that's what she's dealing
[47:35] with she's brother crest told me this
[47:37] morning's that she's really weak and not
[47:40] able to stand up on her own and walk on
[47:43] her own right now and and you know many
[47:46] of you went through a lot of afflictions
[47:47] yourself and just affliction itself just
[47:50] the ordeal let alone from all of that
[47:51] taking place it's enough to wipe you out
[47:54] you know but you had everything else on
[47:56] top of it and so we just lost joining
[48:00] with them and prayer that we just want
[48:01] to continue that as well also yesterday
[48:03] I had received a text earlier in the
[48:06] evening from brother Chuck Collins and I
[48:09] don't know where it stands now I brother
[48:12] Chuck just text me and had let me know
[48:14] yesterday that far as was sister
[48:16] Elizabeth whom we have been praying for
[48:18] and and we continue to hold on before
[48:20] the throne of God in prayer that they
[48:23] you know yesterday
[48:26] she was in and out of consciousness and
[48:28] her liver and had shut down an hour
[48:31] before he text me her heart rate was up
[48:34] and so they're just they at that point
[48:36] in time they were you know as it has
[48:38] been all along only a miracle from God
[48:41] we keep her here and you know I you know
[48:44] would think about it and just you know
[48:45] it laid so heavy on my heart throughout
[48:47] yesterday and it's been then even last
[48:49] night you know and just thinking of it
[48:52] your is a you know as they have a
[48:55] four-year-old and also brother Joshua
[48:57] and her husband Joshua Collins and just
[49:00] them just wonderful believers in the
[49:02] Lord and God knows God knows and we I
[49:05] tell you what we're always we're always
[49:06] in the will of God when we're praying
[49:08] for life and for healing because I it
[49:11] doesn't matter how bleak the
[49:13] circumstances I know these things when
[49:15] mention that even when I got the text
[49:16] from brother Chuck you could take a gasp
[49:18] because it oh but there's nothing beyond
[49:21] the Lord remember remember what he made
[49:25] himself
[49:25] remember how he made himself known to
[49:27] Martha in that time he said I am the
[49:31] resurrection of life she was looking for
[49:33] well he will raise us up that he's
[49:35] letting her know that I am I am the
[49:37] resurrection and life right now and I
[49:40] believe that God has made that very
[49:41] clear
[49:42] in this generation and God has made that
[49:45] clear to us personally and so we we have
[49:49] that we have that experience in our
[49:50] hearts and so we can we can pray with
[49:52] that an inner end with that family I
[49:54] know there's many other other requests
[49:56] and sickness and things like that and
[49:58] I've asked even the song leaders if they
[50:02] wouldn't have you shaking hands
[50:04] I hope you are okay with that brother
[50:07] sending you out I have faith I do but I
[50:08] also have wisdom I mean unless we're
[50:13] gonna hand out plastic gloves I know how
[50:18] some of y'all do you put gloves on
[50:19] before you shake people's hands
[50:21] I'm gonna call nobody's name on but
[50:26] that's fine I mean in this age this time
[50:28] that we're living in you know what it's
[50:30] like this why do you think when you go
[50:32] to Sam's Club or Walmart
[50:34] everybody has it now you grab a shopping
[50:36] cart what it but we just used to grab
[50:38] shopping carts now before you go in they
[50:40] got this big old canister of wipes right
[50:44] everybody's antibacterial but I believe
[50:49] with all my heart we do need to take
[50:52] precautions and I believe it was always
[50:53] you know hey ever I love you all being
[50:56] able to shake hands with one another you
[50:57] greet one another out there and you know
[51:00] it's like hey if you want to air five
[51:02] somebody you know or air shake or this
[51:05] bumper you know or however you want to
[51:08] do it but I you know I just I think
[51:11] within here we we want also to be to be
[51:14] careful so I hope you understand that
[51:18] well I think that's it unless I'm
[51:21] forgetting something here which that's
[51:22] very possible let's turn to the Bible
[51:25] here and and I didn't put this on the
[51:27] overhead but I want
[51:28] go to Psalms chapter 63 if we got it
[51:33] Psalms chapter 63
[51:40] the only thing about making
[51:42] announcements and talking to y'all
[51:43] before and I feel like that gets counted
[51:44] against me Psalm 63 verse 1 you love the
[51:58] Lord O God thou art my god
[52:08] early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth
[52:12] for thee my flesh longeth worthy in a
[52:15] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[52:19] to see that power and thy glory so as I
[52:24] have seen thee in the sanctuary because
[52:28] thy loving-kindness is better than life
[52:31] I love that thy loving-kindness is
[52:37] better than life because thy
[52:39] loving-kindness is better than life my
[52:41] lips shall praise thee thus will I bless
[52:46] thee while I live I will lift up my hand
[52:49] in thy name my soul shall be satisfied
[52:54] as with Morrow and fatness and my mouth
[52:57] shall praise thee with joyful lip when I
[53:00] remember the upon my bed and meditate on
[53:02] the in the night watches because thou
[53:05] has been my health therefore in the
[53:07] shadow of that Wings will I rejoice my
[53:12] soul followeth hard after thee thy right
[53:14] hand upholds me but those that seek my
[53:19] soul to destroy it
[53:20] shall go into the lower parts of the
[53:22] earth they shall fall by the sword they
[53:25] shall be a portion for foxes but the
[53:27] King shall rejoice in God every one that
[53:30] sweareth by him shall glory but the
[53:32] mouth of them that speak lies shall be
[53:35] stopped
[53:37] let's just bar here's a word of Prayer

[56:44] Lord so fully in surrender we pray Lord
[56:48] we just give ourselves to you now
[56:50] in the name of Jesus Christ amen god
[56:52] bless you being seated amen
[57:02] I want to just refer back into that
[57:09] portion of scripture out of Ephesians 2
[57:12] where we have been have been looking on
[57:16] the great mercy of God brother Branham
[57:21] he says it like this and the God who is
[57:23] rich in mercy I read this to you last
[57:25] week but I want to go back into this a
[57:27] little bit this morning the Lord will
[57:29] help us
[57:30] he said you once in times past were dead
[57:34] you were dead
[57:36] even many here tonight one time can look
[57:39] back and know that you were dead but now
[57:43] why aren't you dead tonight as you were
[57:45] then you deserve to be that way because
[57:49] you was a sinner but God who is rich in
[57:52] mercy that's the thing God who was rich
[57:55] all these things that were but God that
[58:00] made the change right there God who is
[58:03] rich in mercy not wants you to catch
[58:05] this right here that made the change
[58:08] right there God who is rich in mercy and
[58:12] he said I'm so glad for that that he
[58:15] being rich in mercy if he was just rich
[58:18] in money if he was just rich in
[58:20] materials which he is but yet the
[58:23] greatest thing is being rich in mercy
[58:25] all what a great word that is how that
[58:28] we were once dead you think about it
[58:32] when you look over that and in Ephesians
[58:34] 2 and I don't believe we can ever look
[58:37] at it and read it enough and it just
[58:39] continues as a great love story and
[58:41] redemption and to recognize that the
[58:44] conditions that we were in when you you
[58:48] think of it that even right here is
[58:50] we're sitting here this morning that if
[58:52] it was not for the mercies of God we
[58:55] wouldn't be here it's the mercy of God
[58:59] because when we look at the scriptures
[59:02] and in Ephesians 2 and knowing that the
[59:05] conditions that truly that we were in we
[59:08] were dead in sin and trespasses and that
[59:11] is even if in our lives there was
[59:13] nothing that maybe that you could search
[59:16] out and say well I never did
[59:17] and I never did that and I never did
[59:20] that but yet every one of us were born
[59:23] in sin and shaped in iniquity and come
[59:25] to the world speaking lives every one of
[59:28] us needed someone we needed deliverance
[59:32] from that first birth because staying
[59:36] under that first birth that is a
[59:37] condemnation but yet God made a way that
[59:41] we could be delivered and be brought
[59:43] into that new birth and so when we look
[59:47] at this this condition that we were we
[59:50] were in and it was truly a situation
[59:52] that as we read here just moments ago
[59:54] when it would come down to what is
[59:56] deserved we deserved hell if it was
[1:00:00] God's justice and judgment that was
[1:00:03] being poured out upon us we wouldn't be
[1:00:05] here this morning but there was one who
[1:00:08] was able to take the justice and the
[1:00:13] judgment of God and that was God himself
[1:00:16] coming down and becoming one of us
[1:00:18] creating a tabernacle that he might
[1:00:21] himself pay the price that was needed
[1:00:24] and we know that God poured out his
[1:00:26] wrath upon that body there there within
[1:00:29] that God made you and I pay for our sins
[1:00:32] and to think of it that with within this
[1:00:35] here of how that God's mercy that you
[1:00:38] and I might receive of this mercy and
[1:00:41] what I want you to to look at here this
[1:00:43] morning as we go into it that God indeed
[1:00:46] is rich in mercy and God had mercy for
[1:00:50] us but as we looked in that in that
[1:00:53] quote that we were looking at that mercy
[1:00:55] itself God being rich in mercy there
[1:00:59] came a change to our life to where that
[1:01:02] mercy is not just something that we talk
[1:01:05] about but we have received a direct
[1:01:09] witness and experience of the very mercy
[1:01:13] of Almighty God so when we think of this
[1:01:16] here I want to go back into the
[1:01:17] scriptures here just for just for a
[1:01:19] moment into some places where we were
[1:01:21] because when we look at this on the
[1:01:23] richness of God's mercy we find that
[1:01:26] they enriched us there's so many that
[1:01:29] very word itself
[1:01:30] there's so many plentiful in in
[1:01:32] quantities and and so many different
[1:01:35] avenues and aspects and we we want to
[1:01:37] just look at that here for a moment
[1:01:38] because I I want to just bring us and
[1:01:40] review just a moment before I move on
[1:01:42] this morning in Exodus 33 17 here is
[1:01:45] where that the that God is speaking to
[1:01:48] Moses and Moses has made a request that
[1:01:51] he would see his faith see his glory and
[1:01:55] God speaks to Moses and verse 17 of
[1:01:58] Exodus 33 and he says I'll do this which
[1:02:01] thou has spoken for thou has found grace
[1:02:03] in my side and I know thee by name and
[1:02:05] he said I beseech thee show me thy glory
[1:02:08] and he said I will make all my goodness
[1:02:10] pass before thee and I will proclaim the
[1:02:14] name of the Lord before the now remember
[1:02:17] when we're looking at this here within
[1:02:19] the scriptures we we looked at this last
[1:02:21] week that here when we think of the
[1:02:23] mercy of God there's many many words
[1:02:25] that that the riders will try to use to
[1:02:30] convey to convey the different realities
[1:02:34] and quality of God's mercy because
[1:02:37] within it they they will write of God's
[1:02:40] in one in one sense of it they'll write
[1:02:43] of God's goodness you'll read the word
[1:02:44] goodness in the scripture
[1:02:46] you'll link of the word that we just
[1:02:48] read in Psalm 63 thy loving-kindness
[1:02:50] which is the same word as goodness it's
[1:02:53] the same word as mercy that God uses
[1:02:56] there in that that goodness that
[1:02:58] faithfulness that's steadfastness and
[1:03:00] when we we look at that we know that
[1:03:03] when as we see that that it's not just
[1:03:05] faithfulness and goodness and
[1:03:07] steadfastness alone that's the best that
[1:03:09] the riders themselves can do but as I
[1:03:11] was sharing with you last week when the
[1:03:13] the Hebrew writers the rabbis and
[1:03:15] different ones will take this word this
[1:03:17] word has said which is the word that
[1:03:20] would be used in that of mercy and they
[1:03:22] would convey that word that that that to
[1:03:26] actually speak of all or the depths of
[1:03:29] it that it's not just something of
[1:03:31] faithfulness and steadfastness but there
[1:03:33] is that steadfast love of God because if
[1:03:36] you take love out of it then you've
[1:03:38] written then you don't have the mercy of
[1:03:40] God but God's mercy
[1:03:42] is a steadfastness of love and so notice
[1:03:46] in here in verse 19 as it goes on and it
[1:03:48] says and I will be gracious to whom I
[1:03:51] will be gracious and will show mercy on
[1:03:55] whom I will show mercy so I want you to
[1:03:57] look at this that God has mercy but
[1:04:00] God's intention and desire is that that
[1:04:04] mercy would be shown and not just
[1:04:08] something that's out there but that it
[1:04:10] would be shown to those in whom God has
[1:04:14] intended to make this mercy known to so
[1:04:19] he says this this word mercy here it's a
[1:04:22] different word but look what it means
[1:04:24] it's the love love deeply have mercy be
[1:04:27] compassionate have tender affection and
[1:04:30] and to be shown compassion so we we see
[1:04:33] within this this word here that there is
[1:04:35] a depths of God's mercy and you look at
[1:04:39] it even in the depths of God's love and
[1:04:40] we look at this just in this life you
[1:04:43] can love you know you love other
[1:04:45] children just like I can love I can love
[1:04:48] your children but my children there's a
[1:04:50] different love that I have from my
[1:04:52] children then I have for your children
[1:04:54] and it's not because I'm a bad person
[1:04:56] it's just simply that I love mine
[1:04:59] there's a deeper depth of where mine is
[1:05:02] because they are my children they are
[1:05:05] from me and that's the same thing with
[1:05:07] God's love with God's mercy I tell you
[1:05:11] what the world here as we know it in
[1:05:13] this and this time people they are
[1:05:16] benefiting from God's mercy here upon
[1:05:19] this earth they may not come to know the
[1:05:22] riches and depths of his mercy like you
[1:05:25] and I by His grace have come to know but
[1:05:28] remember a lot himself he in what he
[1:05:31] received lot himself said thou has
[1:05:34] magnified thy mercy unto me in that thou
[1:05:39] hast saved me is that right but we know
[1:05:43] that within all of that as we see that
[1:05:46] there is a coming out and there's a
[1:05:47] going in when lot will save lot didn't
[1:05:50] he didn't ask and say hey can I go over
[1:05:52] where
[1:05:53] for him zat but rather lot said there's
[1:05:55] a place over here I want to go over
[1:05:57] there can I go over there and he said
[1:05:59] escape hither go quickly so the lot
[1:06:02] himself he was saved but rot was not
[1:06:06] redeemed there's a different depth of
[1:06:10] mercy
[1:06:11] in Exodus 34 here is Moses receiving God
[1:06:16] honoring this request and the Bible says
[1:06:20] the Lord descended in the cloud and
[1:06:21] stood with him there and proclaimed the
[1:06:24] name of the Lord now here he is
[1:06:26] proclaiming this name remember Jesus
[1:06:28] said I've manifested that name verse 6
[1:06:31] and the Lord passed by before him and
[1:06:33] proclaimed the Lord the Lord God
[1:06:36] merciful and gracious long-suffering and
[1:06:41] abundant in goodness there's that word
[1:06:42] goodness again and that word above their
[1:06:45] merciful deals with one who has
[1:06:48] compassion look at this in verse 7
[1:06:50] keeping mercy for thousands I believe
[1:06:55] that that is I'm identified their mercy
[1:07:00] that has been reserved for thousands
[1:07:03] that is innumerable an order a truth
[1:07:06] that their God has kept mercy aren't you
[1:07:11] glad look at this now forgiving iniquity
[1:07:15] and transgression and sin and that lie
[1:07:19] will by no means clear the guilty
[1:07:22] visiting the iniquity of the father's
[1:07:24] upon the children and upon the
[1:07:26] children's children under the third and
[1:07:28] to the fourth generation so hear it
[1:07:30] within this same verse of scripture we
[1:07:33] find that in these these verses here
[1:07:35] that God revealing his name his name as
[1:07:39] he is revealing it is is the attributes
[1:07:42] it's the very life so when God here
[1:07:45] manifested in Christ the Lord Jesus
[1:07:47] could say in John 17 I have manifested
[1:07:50] thy name unto those whom thou gavest
[1:07:53] unto me is that right
[1:07:55] so the manifestation of that name is
[1:07:58] here God's word that word
[1:08:00] being made flesh that word coming to
[1:08:03] pass
[1:08:03] that's God's name being made manifest
[1:08:07] every time God has made manifest of a
[1:08:10] promise
[1:08:10] God has revealed remember an attribute a
[1:08:13] characteristic of who he is
[1:08:15] even when Moses was there before God in
[1:08:18] the burning bush what did he say he said
[1:08:20] who shall I tell them has sent me
[1:08:22] they're gonna want to know your name
[1:08:24] so God reveals not just a word to him
[1:08:29] but God what God reveals to him God is
[1:08:33] there present to vindicate that that he
[1:08:36] is the I am so Moses was not just
[1:08:38] ministering a message of the I am but
[1:08:41] the I am was ministering the message of
[1:08:43] I am through Moses and he was there to
[1:08:47] vindicate the word that had been
[1:08:49] revealed I tell you right now we don't
[1:08:51] just need revelation we need vindication
[1:08:54] the promise as the Prophet stood over
[1:08:56] and over in the opening of the seals and
[1:08:59] you find him continuing to move through
[1:09:01] this again and again he said is that
[1:09:03] it's not only promised to be open to us
[1:09:06] by divine revelation but also with
[1:09:10] vindication and this is where he brings
[1:09:13] it in he keeps working with this feast
[1:09:16] the trumpet he brings it on over in the
[1:09:18] future home and he deals with a life
[1:09:20] that is sealed away with God and he said
[1:09:23] what that life is that evidence that
[1:09:25] life of the Holy Spirit is not only what
[1:09:28] has been revealed but there has been
[1:09:30] there is a vindication and that
[1:09:33] vindication is his life personally
[1:09:36] within you and I you see I want to just
[1:09:40] say it like this that there are things
[1:09:43] that when the word is presented you and
[1:09:45] I can look at this as we remain we
[1:09:48] alluded to this a little bit on Thursday
[1:09:49] night that through the minister the word
[1:09:51] there's things that where God can bring
[1:09:53] things together for you and I and we can
[1:09:56] look at it and say that's exactly the
[1:09:58] truth well I see that by bringing all
[1:09:59] that together but yet remember what our
[1:10:02] desire is is not just seeing it like
[1:10:04] that but Lord let
[1:10:06] live in me because this the the word not
[1:10:12] only the message that God has sent in
[1:10:14] this hour for you and I but all the way
[1:10:16] down through time God never intended
[1:10:19] that the word wouldn't would become
[1:10:22] merely just a Bible study or that it
[1:10:24] would become just a knowledge but God
[1:10:26] desires to perform his word through our
[1:10:29] life to where that he is our life I want
[1:10:34] you understand a book can't be my life a
[1:10:36] tape can't be your life listen this
[1:10:38] Bible can't be my life but the only
[1:10:40] thing that God has said can point me to
[1:10:44] that life and to that relationship and
[1:10:47] will foster that and encourage that but
[1:10:50] there must be that life of the word
[1:10:53] Himself living inside of me and then
[1:10:57] this word and everything that God has
[1:10:59] given it is for the edifying of that
[1:11:03] wall in that relationship outside of
[1:11:06] that that's just our our mirror of scent
[1:11:09] or knowledge of thing we don't want
[1:11:11] because knowledge can never hold anybody
[1:11:14] I'll tell you right now when I was
[1:11:16] growing up and bound in sin and out
[1:11:18] there in the world I tell you what I
[1:11:20] could argue with somebody blue in the
[1:11:22] face about serpent seed I could do that
[1:11:25] I could you know there's something about
[1:11:27] it that I just I knew that this message
[1:11:29] was a true but I didn't have the power
[1:11:32] there wasn't a relationship and knew it
[1:11:35] was true sure yeah I mean I can't I
[1:11:39] couldn't go through things been like I I
[1:11:41] came now but but even within that this
[1:11:43] is a life this is he is my life it's not
[1:11:47] something that it's just Thursday and
[1:11:49] it's Sunday and he's my life it's every
[1:11:52] day it's it's all it's all but I long
[1:11:54] for it's all but I want to do I just
[1:11:56] want to please him I don't want to miss
[1:11:58] anything it's an opportunity it's it's
[1:12:03] him and that's where the Prophet would
[1:12:05] even warn even in the message come
[1:12:07] follow me that he preaches to the
[1:12:09] graduates and he says we don't want this
[1:12:12] message he said our message it can
[1:12:14] become just theology
[1:12:18] what a warning this message it's not of
[1:12:21] all the doctrines friends that's not
[1:12:23] what it's about
[1:12:24] the life itself the life that's what
[1:12:27] it's about it's alive and the life
[1:12:29] itself will take us and correctly place
[1:12:32] us in the doctors because the doctrines
[1:12:34] are not the life the doctrines are the
[1:12:36] bark on the tree you can stand in those
[1:12:39] doctrines and those doctrines as after
[1:12:41] the life has come in and you're standing
[1:12:43] right there as he has taught you lord
[1:12:45] have mercy I don't know where that came
[1:12:46] from
[1:12:49] but keeping mercy keeping mercy he's
[1:12:55] kept mercy before you and I ever
[1:12:58] surrendered whether a young person
[1:13:00] whether you old he has reserved and
[1:13:03] kempt mercy I want you to think of this
[1:13:06] the same way that God has reserved and
[1:13:10] kept mercy for you and I waiting for us
[1:13:12] to come to the realization I need you
[1:13:15] Lord that's the same reserve that God
[1:13:20] asks of us even in Philippians chapter 2
[1:13:22] when he would say up fill up with bowels
[1:13:25] of Mercy then we would have a reserve
[1:13:28] and and be so filled with God's mercy
[1:13:31] and and ready to ready to display that I
[1:13:38] want to say this and in this in this
[1:13:41] regard you see in the scripture here
[1:13:43] because in the hour in which we are
[1:13:47] living in which were not worth as far as
[1:13:50] time yes it's a different hour but as
[1:13:52] far as the way that spirits have worked
[1:13:54] all the way down to Scripture speaks of
[1:13:57] the mystery of iniquity was already
[1:14:00] working back there Paul himself
[1:14:03] Jude remembered Jude there he he spoke
[1:14:06] of how that there were men who were
[1:14:07] taking the grace of God and turning it
[1:14:11] into lasciviousness God didn't do that
[1:14:14] men were doing that is that right so
[1:14:17] there's a truth to God's grace just as
[1:14:20] there's a truth to God's mercy because
[1:14:23] within this in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:27] here is revealed the very mercy of God
[1:14:31] so through the ministering of the name
[1:14:33] because remember the Lord Jesus himself
[1:14:35] as he moved upon David in the Psalms I
[1:14:38] believe at Psalms 44 Paul picks it up in
[1:14:41] Hebrews 2 and he identifies the position
[1:14:44] where he were Christ would be walking in
[1:14:47] the midst of the Church of the Living
[1:14:49] God saying I will declare thy name unto
[1:14:53] my brethren Amen unto my relation unto
[1:14:57] my kinfolk under that of letter of that
[1:15:01] same nature so here here God's desire in
[1:15:05] proclaiming that name it's a life it's
[1:15:07] we understand it's not just a name
[1:15:10] that's given and saying on the name of
[1:15:12] Jesus Christ a Christian but there's a
[1:15:13] life that's attached to it
[1:15:15] when that name is mentioned because name
[1:15:17] would name the very word name we know in
[1:15:20] the Hebrews is Shem is character but
[1:15:22] when you mention that the word name
[1:15:24] itself in the Greek it speaks of what is
[1:15:26] it what reputation what honor comes to
[1:15:29] mind what is it that comes to mind at
[1:15:31] the mentioning of the name of the Lord
[1:15:34] Jesus Christ they meant so this is where
[1:15:37] it requires Claude to reveal his name to
[1:15:43] that generation because it's God
[1:15:45] revealing his name to be the same notice
[1:15:48] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:50] forever who is Jesus Christ
[1:15:52] it requires that because through that
[1:15:54] name being revealed
[1:15:55] comes the very depths of God's mercy to
[1:16:00] the people of God of whom in his reserve
[1:16:02] and yet in that age there is also that
[1:16:05] where God will also hold those guilty
[1:16:09] who spurn his mercy so so we find
[1:16:13] something that the mercy of God is not
[1:16:14] something that that it would just let
[1:16:19] down or compromise the mercy of God is
[1:16:22] not how that many would try to make it
[1:16:25] as though that you know God's mercy
[1:16:28] just you know you you can never live an
[1:16:30] overcoming life and God understands you
[1:16:32] know he remember Psalm 78 he knows that
[1:16:36] we are but flesh that is true but in
[1:16:39] that God knows know what I'm saying is
[1:16:41] that we are but flesh it's not true that
[1:16:43] we can live in overcoming life let me be
[1:16:45] very clear about that we can live in
[1:16:47] overcoming life amen it's about his name
[1:16:50] and that life be revealed to us it's
[1:16:52] just like I told the young people here
[1:16:54] just last month and we're looking I said
[1:16:56] you look at songs that are being sung I
[1:16:58] said and be careful with the songs that
[1:17:00] are being sung and you're looking at
[1:17:02] because sometimes these songs are being
[1:17:04] sung in a manner of perpetual failure
[1:17:07] they hold within them no victory are you
[1:17:12] with me it's constantly like there's no
[1:17:15] victory there's no strength there's no
[1:17:17] power that's not true the name of the
[1:17:20] Lord has been revealed to us that he is
[1:17:22] all-powerful he is the mighty God he is
[1:17:26] a deliverer he is within our strength
[1:17:28] he's a conqueror he is everything he's
[1:17:32] not been diluted the atonement hasn't
[1:17:35] weakened but as a matter of fact it's a
[1:17:37] gathering of all things together in this
[1:17:40] hour it's greater than it's ever been
[1:17:44] since the day that Christ himself walked
[1:17:48] here in flesh in that hour has the son
[1:17:52] of man is that right and here we are
[1:17:54] living in this hour after the church
[1:17:58] ages of the the Son of God and here we
[1:18:00] are in the closing out of that seven
[1:18:02] churches where God promised to visit the
[1:18:05] Gentile church again in the revealing of
[1:18:08] the Son of Man and I'm telling you right
[1:18:10] now that is a sign of a coming and a
[1:18:13] transition where Christ Himself living
[1:18:16] in the flesh of his people
[1:18:23] what an hour we're living in what a time
[1:18:27] we're living in we're living in a time
[1:18:30] where it is a time that requires
[1:18:32] decisions it requires you and I to be
[1:18:36] adamant he requires us to be focused
[1:18:40] within this hour
[1:18:41] oh my so there is this mercy that is
[1:18:45] within here coming back to this here it
[1:18:48] it is something that when we look at it
[1:18:51] when the Hebrew riders as I looked and
[1:18:54] just studying over that of the word has
[1:18:56] said and looking at it and just looking
[1:18:58] at where that their their thought line
[1:19:01] and where they were moving with these
[1:19:02] things and and it finds you know let me
[1:19:05] just kind of read I don't have any up
[1:19:06] there but let me just kind of read from
[1:19:08] a little bit you know the question had
[1:19:10] had was put forth in one of the writings
[1:19:12] that right there at the turn of the
[1:19:13] century which comes first mercy or
[1:19:15] justice and you know one of the one of
[1:19:18] the the commentators there of the the
[1:19:21] rabbi's said God gave presidents
[1:19:23] presidents means importance to the rule
[1:19:25] of mercy and joined it with the rule of
[1:19:28] justice and this is important because he
[1:19:32] says you know how much when we look at
[1:19:34] the scriptures we read God's
[1:19:35] loving-kindness God's goodness and that
[1:19:38] sometimes it loses it loses the
[1:19:41] connection with the righteousness of God
[1:19:44] because his mercy is kept it is reserved
[1:19:49] but in no way is God in his word is it
[1:19:54] written where that it would have
[1:19:56] sentimental values I want you to see
[1:20:00] understand that it's not sentimental
[1:20:03] values that where God's compassion is
[1:20:05] simply looking on you and I and saying
[1:20:07] they'll never be able to do it they'll
[1:20:09] never be able to live it they'll never
[1:20:11] destined it that right there that is
[1:20:13] excuses and it would and it speaks to
[1:20:15] God's own weakness if that's what this
[1:20:18] would imply but God desires
[1:20:21] righteousness righteousness is that in
[1:20:25] that condition that that point in that
[1:20:28] place and that state of which man is
[1:20:30] accepted before God
[1:20:33] there's only one way that you and I can
[1:20:35] be accepted before God and that's to be
[1:20:38] in Christ and in Christ is not being a
[1:20:42] part of a church in Christ is to be born
[1:20:45] of the Holy Ghost to be dwelling in the
[1:20:50] body of the word that is a living being
[1:20:53] Christ is that all right but in order
[1:20:59] for you and me to get there we need not
[1:21:04] just that mercy kept but the mercy must
[1:21:07] be revealed
[1:21:10] it must be revealed if there is mercy
[1:21:14] that's for me I need it needs to be
[1:21:16] revealed to me so here in no way you
[1:21:22] know the writer will say you know what's
[1:21:24] in it here it says you know when we look
[1:21:26] at how that his passion for
[1:21:27] righteousness is so strong that he could
[1:21:29] not be more insistent in his demand for
[1:21:32] but God's persistent love for his people
[1:21:35] is more insistent still I want you think
[1:21:38] of this for a moment hear God's desire
[1:21:40] for this righteousness think about down
[1:21:43] through time and how that God allowed
[1:21:47] the humanity to be displayed even of his
[1:21:50] prophets and of his people God allowed
[1:21:52] that to be but yet God did not stop God
[1:21:57] didn't say okay no tried man his love
[1:22:01] was insistent but his love did not cause
[1:22:04] him to compromise you see love moves him
[1:22:08] there's an object there's a goal there's
[1:22:11] a vision and love is moving there at a
[1:22:13] friend's there's things that you and I
[1:22:15] can look at within families within
[1:22:17] marriages or than everything else Church
[1:22:19] and whatever more and you can look at
[1:22:20] things even on your job you can look at
[1:22:23] things sometimes and you can become so
[1:22:24] frustrated by just what you're seeing it
[1:22:26] seems like this isn't going or this
[1:22:28] isn't happening things aren't falling
[1:22:30] right in line but remember here love
[1:22:32] itself must be the driving force with
[1:22:36] love being the driving force doesn't
[1:22:38] mean you do away with the requirements
[1:22:40] it means that love is there to
[1:22:43] to Minister what's needed in order to
[1:22:45] bring forth what's being called for it
[1:22:50] must be present there in love the we we
[1:22:54] know we can go in the scriptures with
[1:22:55] this in first Corinthians 13 love is
[1:22:57] patient love is kind
[1:23:01] tell me Holly let's have you and a pram
[1:23:05] family service I told you last night
[1:23:08] this is a family book we're his family
[1:23:11] but this is this this love this requires
[1:23:15] out of our life look just even right
[1:23:18] here within an assembly
[1:23:19] it requires love to wear that we're able
[1:23:21] to you know be when I say tolerant of
[1:23:25] things and of one another and make
[1:23:27] allowances I'm not talking about
[1:23:28] allowances for sin but to wear that
[1:23:31] within the midst of it to wear that
[1:23:33] there is a desire to see lives and
[1:23:36] others help not not not in a way uh to
[1:23:39] wear it just like a judge doubt but
[1:23:42] where that God's love is there to
[1:23:45] minister to that life if a person
[1:23:47] doesn't want to receive that that's on
[1:23:48] there a court are you with me that
[1:23:52] that's that's on their record you know
[1:23:54] as I said last week God God you know God
[1:23:57] will continue to deal with hearts
[1:23:59] continue to deal with lives but God is
[1:24:01] not going to continue to pour and
[1:24:02] continue to pour and continue to pour
[1:24:04] continue to pour remember God is here
[1:24:07] getting you and I together and ready for
[1:24:09] rapture so think of this know the
[1:24:18] sentiment is not operating out of
[1:24:20] sentimental notice this in the scripture
[1:24:22] how that it would speak of the great
[1:24:25] mercy of God let me just jump into this
[1:24:28] quote here and the message here to him
[1:24:29] brother Ram in 1958 he said I don't want
[1:24:32] justice I don't want judgment I want
[1:24:36] mercy God give me mercy not his law not
[1:24:42] his denominations not his bishops I want
[1:24:45] his love and His mercy
[1:24:48] now this is it let me just let me let me
[1:24:51] just speak on this a little bit
[1:24:53] this isn't brother branham in some way
[1:24:55] speaking as though that well I'm just
[1:24:58] unable to live right I'm not that's not
[1:25:00] what he's talking about he's speaking of
[1:25:02] I need his mercy I am a recipient of
[1:25:05] God's mercy but I need his mercies as
[1:25:09] David would say over and over his tender
[1:25:11] mercies which is that compassion where
[1:25:14] as David could say he crowded my life
[1:25:17] with tender mercies you are a work of
[1:25:20] the master and that word when God
[1:25:23] revealed the Lord God the Lord God
[1:25:25] merciful that word merciful in Exodus 34
[1:25:28] is compassionate one with a possible
[1:25:32] exception Wow one with a possible
[1:25:37] exception you and I need that it isn't
[1:25:41] because well we're listen wewe need that
[1:25:44] listen God is molding us he is shaping
[1:25:46] us he is chastening us
[1:25:48] he's moving upon our lives we need the
[1:25:51] very mercy of Almighty God because just
[1:25:54] simply put sometimes we think we've got
[1:25:57] it and all of a sudden when we go as I
[1:25:59] said you know last week you go to shoot
[1:26:02] at the barn you come out of a service
[1:26:04] got it all lined up and instead of
[1:26:06] hitting your barn you hit another barn
[1:26:11] what we need we need merciful one who's
[1:26:14] there who new doesn't just say that's
[1:26:16] okay you can hit other people's barns
[1:26:18] that's all right no we need one with
[1:26:20] tender mercies to be able to direct us
[1:26:22] and where we can come right in line with
[1:26:25] that and show us so that what our desire
[1:26:28] is that he has stirred up that that
[1:26:31] desire can be fully come to pass in our
[1:26:35] life it requires his tender mercies
[1:26:39] that's why David could say continue that
[1:26:44] tender mercies continue he would say i
[1:26:46] loving-kindness we need that and I say
[1:26:50] that because just with just receiving
[1:26:53] the Holy Ghost it isn't that we don't
[1:26:55] need God's mercy anymore our soul has
[1:26:58] already pass under the judgment of
[1:27:01] Almighty God and we have received God's
[1:27:04] mercy when we have been born of the Holy
[1:27:07] Ghost we have received that depth of
[1:27:09] God's mercy but we need his continual
[1:27:13] mercies in the working of our lives we
[1:27:18] need His mercies and our families His
[1:27:20] mercies in our homes we need His mercies
[1:27:24] so here brother bream says that's what
[1:27:27] the world is hungry for sometimes I pay
[1:27:32] close attention out and the Lord will
[1:27:33] just have me hone in on certain words
[1:27:35] this is what the world is hunger in for
[1:27:37] I just begin to look at that word hungry
[1:27:40] you know there's a lot of things you can
[1:27:42] fill up on and it don't quench hunger is
[1:27:48] where there's a there's a craving
[1:27:50] there's a need and here the world itself
[1:27:57] satisfying with all sorts of things
[1:27:59] there's all kinds there's so much more
[1:28:02] now for people to have and have access
[1:28:06] to so much more but yet so much greater
[1:28:11] the hunger this is a fulfillment the
[1:28:14] famine in these days so it's greater but
[1:28:20] yet notice within it his love and His
[1:28:24] mercy God's mercy upon us
[1:28:26] I couldn't stand his law I can't keep
[1:28:29] his law and he knows I don't want his
[1:28:31] justice he would condemn me but I'll
[1:28:34] accept his mercy what will his mercy do
[1:28:38] change me his mercy will change my
[1:28:44] nature to where it's not just something
[1:28:46] that God is forgiving forgiving but God
[1:28:49] is able to look down and say I know you
[1:28:51] didn't mean to do it
[1:28:54] why cuz he knows your nature your nature
[1:28:58] and his nature is compatible
[1:29:04] by then what can Jesus do for you he can
[1:29:08] save you he can heal you he can give you
[1:29:10] his salvation he can take you to glory
[1:29:12] he can cover your sins he can make you
[1:29:15] love one another aren't you glad for
[1:29:17] that now to think of this here in in the
[1:29:24] Old Testament there would be where there
[1:29:27] is a time and God laid these things down
[1:29:30] in tight to where that there would be a
[1:29:33] time each each year where there would be
[1:29:37] blood that would be placed upon the
[1:29:40] mercy seat there would be a cleansing of
[1:29:42] the sanctuary each year and we know that
[1:29:45] that that atoning blood we know that it
[1:29:48] was done once a year and we know that
[1:29:49] that speaks of his Paul would tell us by
[1:29:51] the Spirit of God that once and for all
[1:29:54] once and for all he suffered he don't
[1:29:58] have to come back and suffer again he
[1:30:00] suffered once and for all
[1:30:01] he paid the price already you and I
[1:30:06] coming to him are only coming to the
[1:30:09] realization the acceptance of what he
[1:30:12] has already done for you and I he
[1:30:16] commended his love for us that while we
[1:30:18] were yet sinners he died for us it would
[1:30:22] know him you know it would be no sense
[1:30:23] for me to tell you you could be free if
[1:30:26] there was nothing there that could say
[1:30:28] you could go free but I'm only a
[1:30:30] spokesman by sent by God to say you're
[1:30:33] free and it requires faith to raise up
[1:30:36] and say I accept that I received that I
[1:30:38] received that declaration I'm free I
[1:30:41] want to walk right into that what will
[1:30:43] God have for me so this mercy seat
[1:30:49] remember the mercy seat and the
[1:30:52] cherubims were of all one beaten work we
[1:30:56] find those cherubims moving on in
[1:30:58] Ezekiel we find those cherubims moving
[1:31:01] on over there clearing the Book of
[1:31:03] Revelations John sees those terrible's
[1:31:05] we see those chair was to be the
[1:31:07] anointings and we've seen all that of
[1:31:09] where that is set up around the
[1:31:10] tabernacle in a type all of these
[1:31:13] things were speaking of God's presence
[1:31:15] God's presence is directly united with
[1:31:20] his mercy Amen it's his presence which
[1:31:23] is his word there the mercy seat is
[1:31:26] where that God told Moses I'll meet you
[1:31:30] there
[1:31:30] I'll commune with you there it's there
[1:31:32] in that secret place where God wouldn't
[1:31:35] would would would meet and personally
[1:31:38] communion and that's where he meets you
[1:31:40] and I you and I could not go in there
[1:31:42] but through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] there has been made away through the
[1:31:47] veil of his flesh because he died and
[1:31:51] paid the price that that way might be
[1:31:54] opened up to you and I that you and I
[1:31:56] are not just staying out here in rituals
[1:31:59] underneath the lights of well today at
[1:32:02] sunny tomorrow it's dark today it's
[1:32:04] sunny tomorrow star we don't even have
[1:32:06] to come into the place of it stop there
[1:32:08] of where it's lights now artificial
[1:32:11] lights lighting of candles but the wind
[1:32:13] can blow my oh my feel shade hold my
[1:32:16] praise o'clock glory to God I feel safe
[1:32:18] and then the max wind comes along blows
[1:32:21] it out I don't feel saved anymore
[1:32:23] I don't feel praise God there is a
[1:32:25] deeper wall that goes beyond our
[1:32:28] feelings and that is they walk inside
[1:32:31] the veil of Almighty God to where you
[1:32:35] and I can meet God face to face and
[1:32:38] whether I feel or whether I don't feel
[1:32:40] there's an anchor that holds hallelujah
[1:32:48] so we don't want we don't want the
[1:32:51] Justice of God we couldn't stand God's
[1:32:53] justice but his mercy is what we want
[1:32:58] amen we want his we want his mercy and
[1:33:01] when we think of that as long I want to
[1:33:04] read this statement here sister it's
[1:33:06] about the third paragraph down below 66
[1:33:09] there in Revelation chapter 5 but I want
[1:33:11] to read this to you here brother banner
[1:33:13] says there was a time of the cleansing
[1:33:15] of the sanctuary when it was a judgement
[1:33:18] seat as long as the blood was off the
[1:33:20] seat so when the cleansing came there
[1:33:23] wasn't many blood on that seat there was
[1:33:25] judgment
[1:33:26] the same seat that was a seat of mercy
[1:33:30] had become a judgement seat just that
[1:33:34] quick the time changed it changed but
[1:33:40] mercy held until that moment once you
[1:33:44] think of this we're now approaching that
[1:33:47] time now we are now approaching in this
[1:33:49] age of cleansing of the sanctuary and
[1:33:52] the judgments coming upon the earth as
[1:33:55] long as blood is there God cannot
[1:33:58] destroy the earth longest blood is there
[1:34:02] nobody's a sinner before God everybody's
[1:34:05] right because there's an atonement for
[1:34:07] everybody
[1:34:10] so what's God looking at the blood
[1:34:14] covering the earth for God so loved the
[1:34:21] world you can finish it then He gave His
[1:34:24] only begotten Son that whosoever
[1:34:25] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:34:28] have everlasting life a blue covering so
[1:34:32] the blood covers for all so everybody
[1:34:36] listen to me now
[1:34:37] everybody as the properties say nobody's
[1:34:40] the center before God but when that
[1:34:42] blood is lifted when that blood is
[1:34:46] lifted what is going to matter is
[1:34:49] whether you have accepted or been
[1:34:51] accepted in his perpetuation to wear
[1:34:56] when that blood when that blood is
[1:34:58] pulled away you are taken with it
[1:35:02] amen we're not talking about literal
[1:35:04] blood we're talking about his life here
[1:35:07] he meant that life that was within that
[1:35:09] blood cell his life right here upon this
[1:35:12] earth they tried to extinguish this life
[1:35:18] they tried to boil the life out they
[1:35:21] tried to do everything but they could
[1:35:23] not get that life separated because
[1:35:26] Claude had an intended purpose that this
[1:35:30] word that life was going to remain upon
[1:35:33] this earth until every one of his
[1:35:35] children were brought back home the only
[1:35:39] thing Satan was given permission to do
[1:35:43] this to do that but the only thing you
[1:35:45] could do is bring a furtherance to the
[1:35:48] gospel you with me it's trying to like
[1:35:53] trying to kill something then it
[1:35:55] multiplies it's like they like they hate
[1:35:59] tell me you know and out things I've
[1:36:00] read about with the Coyotes and things
[1:36:02] like yet they say you get after hunting
[1:36:04] the Coyotes that you know you can hunt
[1:36:05] them any time of the day
[1:36:09] they say you say start feeling pressure
[1:36:11] they start multiplying x feel pressure
[1:36:18] we're not coyotes then I think about the
[1:36:23] Prophet Telesis and we looked there in
[1:36:25] the satire and age of such a dark age
[1:36:27] such a gloomy time such a time when
[1:36:29] everything was against the Church of the
[1:36:32] Living God and I love how the Prophet
[1:36:34] with that eyes able to pick that out he
[1:36:36] said in the midst of this time right
[1:36:38] here the Church of God prospered and
[1:36:41] grew even more hallelujah you can't you
[1:36:45] can't stop the life it's not else like
[1:36:50] that little that little spring that the
[1:36:52] Prophet was talking to him not me
[1:36:55] is something behind me
[1:36:58] hey minutes alive that's behind me as
[1:37:03] long as that blood is there everybody
[1:37:05] that means with all of our heart our
[1:37:07] desire our desire is God let this word
[1:37:12] go to reach every heart every life Lord
[1:37:15] to give me that opportunity Lord let me
[1:37:18] take those opportunities to witness you
[1:37:21] know the greatest witness that you and I
[1:37:22] can have as your life you can tell
[1:37:26] somebody about this message but if you
[1:37:27] ain't faithful about it they wonder and
[1:37:29] look at you and say it must not be that
[1:37:30] good oh you know brother Sam no no you
[1:37:36] don't gotta explain the side effects
[1:37:37] list you take it it has side effects but
[1:37:45] these side effects have been the same
[1:37:46] side effects
[1:37:47] they've been affecting the believers the
[1:37:50] same way all the way down through time
[1:37:53] glory be to God
[1:37:55] it showed in our lives so look he says
[1:38:02] if you fail to accept that atonement and
[1:38:04] go into his presence then you are a
[1:38:06] sinner you're beyond that mercy you've
[1:38:09] judged yourself so she failed to receive
[1:38:14] it you judge yourself so you have the
[1:38:17] opportunity to receive it sometimes you
[1:38:22] know even with listen young ones at home
[1:38:24] with it you know when I get older this
[1:38:26] is not about when you get older this
[1:38:28] isn't like about going out and picking
[1:38:30] out a burial plot well you know what I'm
[1:38:32] gonna go ahead and pick out my burial
[1:38:34] plot and I'm gonna go ahead and get this
[1:38:35] wheel made out and all this other things
[1:38:37] no this is about getting ready to live
[1:38:43] it's about being ready to live for him
[1:38:46] to give your life to Him a service unto
[1:38:49] Him it's the greatest privilege and I
[1:38:52] just told the boys our last night who's
[1:38:54] there with him and I said you know I
[1:38:56] said the only regret I have a set of 19
[1:38:58] years old and God got ahold my life I
[1:38:59] said there's a lot of regrets I had I
[1:39:01] wish there an even way to tell was
[1:39:03] nineteen years old
[1:39:08] probably some of you have different ages
[1:39:10] and whatever more you'd say but what
[1:39:12] we're looking at is that he's everything
[1:39:18] but while there's mercy when the
[1:39:21] cleansing of the sanctuary comes the
[1:39:23] blood goes off the mercy seat in the
[1:39:24] wrath of God falls upon the earth God be
[1:39:27] merciful to us that we be not in that
[1:39:29] day fountains with that mercies of God
[1:39:34] the rich young ruler he came
[1:39:37] face-to-face with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:41] just like you sitting right here this
[1:39:43] morning
[1:39:43] we're right here face to face with his
[1:39:45] presence he had lived a good life but
[1:39:51] yet when he walked away he continued to
[1:39:54] increase see you can go out of here and
[1:39:57] you might have went out of here before
[1:39:59] and you think a pretty good week and
[1:40:01] pretty good day man sterling getting
[1:40:03] from underneath that ministering like
[1:40:04] that and that preaching man will happen
[1:40:06] what it is is conviction let's come home
[1:40:12] oh if I can just make it out another day
[1:40:16] I can just do this if I can just do that
[1:40:18] and you already look and look in the
[1:40:22] head to this right here but it's it's to
[1:40:25] respond to that because when that young
[1:40:28] that rich young ruler when he was there
[1:40:30] in hell he could look over and see
[1:40:32] Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham that was
[1:40:36] the promise of resurrection and what did
[1:40:39] he say sin Lazarus over didn't dev him
[1:40:44] dip his finger he didn't even ask for a
[1:40:46] glass you run like some of you know you
[1:40:50] know and you say I'm not gonna have
[1:40:51] another glass of water for go to bed I'm
[1:40:53] thirsty he just asked for a drop he
[1:40:56] thought man I'll get a drop there wasn't
[1:40:59] nothing for him he had despised and
[1:41:03] rejected God's mercy to him there's a
[1:41:11] lot of things let me tell you something
[1:41:12] right now there's a lot of thing I'm
[1:41:14] just going to I'm just
[1:41:15] with him there's a lot of things that
[1:41:18] can occupy your attention as young
[1:41:20] people in this hour there are so many
[1:41:23] things that can occupy your time and let
[1:41:26] me tell you what it is it's things that
[1:41:28] Satan has laid out as bait he knows that
[1:41:35] if he can fill your mind with other
[1:41:36] things and getting you meditating and
[1:41:38] thinking and dwelling on other things
[1:41:40] you've got something that you can direct
[1:41:43] your mind away from the conviction of
[1:41:46] the Holy Ghost that you sense that's a
[1:41:49] saintly and a service with anyone who's
[1:41:51] older if he can direct your mind away to
[1:41:54] something that's either coming after
[1:41:55] service or this or that he'll try to do
[1:41:58] that but remember is to respond to that
[1:42:01] conviction of the Holy Spirit that deals
[1:42:03] with your heart in your life right now
[1:42:10] very important and Satan is a chief
[1:42:15] anesthesiologist he knows how to numb
[1:42:21] you you can hear so much and allow to
[1:42:27] wear that conviction and in the ministry
[1:42:29] of the word
[1:42:30] listen friends it's not it's not the the
[1:42:32] way that the word itself as far as maybe
[1:42:34] it's spoken maybe my voice is louder
[1:42:37] than what somebody could stand here and
[1:42:39] their voice is much something that has
[1:42:40] nothing to do with it that's just me as
[1:42:42] a person
[1:42:43] but all right I can't I that's just me
[1:42:46] as a person and let me tell you
[1:42:47] something I'm no different outside than
[1:42:48] what I am here in the pulpit now I don't
[1:42:50] run around the house saying hey I want a
[1:42:52] grilled cheese but what I'm saying isn't
[1:42:56] that for me there's a passion about I'm
[1:42:58] not saying that the other person is not
[1:42:59] passion that's just how God made me and
[1:43:05] when he set the knobs he stripped the
[1:43:07] knobs huh that's a I don't know how
[1:43:10] you're gonna adjust him
[1:43:13] but what I'm saying is is that the
[1:43:16] conviction of the holy spirit it is
[1:43:20] something that is present regardless of
[1:43:22] the vernacular or how things are
[1:43:25] actually being said whether it's with a
[1:43:27] loudness or whatever his presence his
[1:43:32] word that brings a conviction it deals
[1:43:35] with hearts and deals with lives that's
[1:43:38] him speaking in His mercy for God to
[1:43:41] even call these things out that's God's
[1:43:43] mercy hmm think of this Paul lets you
[1:43:52] and I know here that we are that wild
[1:43:55] olive branch
[1:43:58] Paul writes there in the in the Romans
[1:44:01] he reminds us the Holy Spirit as Paul
[1:44:04] reminds us we were not even included
[1:44:06] mentioned in the adoption the covenants
[1:44:10] all these things these things were
[1:44:12] pertaining to Israel is that right
[1:44:15] but what Israel and no one else could
[1:44:19] see the prophets would have little as
[1:44:21] the Spirit of God would move upon him
[1:44:23] there would be insights that would come
[1:44:24] you see if they're in the life sometimes
[1:44:27] it's not just what's spoken it's in the
[1:44:28] life in Abraham's life Abraham was a
[1:44:31] Gentile is that right he was a Gentile
[1:44:35] you see that coming in Abraham's life
[1:44:37] you see even how that the Spirit of God
[1:44:39] will move upon Isaiah and said I will
[1:44:42] provoke me to jealousy among the people
[1:44:44] has not God all this was hidden and
[1:44:48] that's why Paul could speak in Ephesians
[1:44:51] and say now even in cautions one of that
[1:44:54] hidden mystery that was there but now
[1:44:59] has been revealed it was not known that
[1:45:03] you and I were there they didn't know
[1:45:05] that with Joseph and the Gentile bride
[1:45:06] God knew it and all of this was hidden
[1:45:11] now begins to come out God's mercy
[1:45:15] Joseph had not been rejected there would
[1:45:18] have been no marriage there there would
[1:45:22] have been no Gentile bride for Joseph is
[1:45:24] that right
[1:45:25] if there had been to listen to me now if
[1:45:27] there was no Gentile bride Joseph was
[1:45:29] not that there would be no restoring and
[1:45:33] helping of Israel is that right
[1:45:37] God called Ruth and in them in the
[1:45:41] scriptures there in Ruth how that Naomi
[1:45:46] speaks Ruth and she says thou has dealt
[1:45:49] has said kindly with me so here she is
[1:45:52] dealing kindly with Naomi and saying I
[1:45:55] want to go with you
[1:45:57] right and they owe me a gives the full
[1:46:01] blanket and says well you don't have to
[1:46:05] sell right you don't have to go all of
[1:46:08] this way but what she said could not
[1:46:12] derail or remove Ruth because Ruth the
[1:46:17] Prophet tells us and the Holy Ghost
[1:46:18] series Ruth had a vision there was
[1:46:25] something that caught ahold of Ruth
[1:46:27] where Ruth could see she had no promise
[1:46:30] in that land but she said my God's gonna
[1:46:34] be your God's gonna be my God where you
[1:46:37] like that's where I'm gonna go and lodge
[1:46:40] let him say why did she she had no
[1:46:42] promise there but she goes she's drawn
[1:46:46] there and she comes there she comes in
[1:46:50] the scripture here she is she lights up
[1:46:53] on beau has his field who directs her
[1:46:55] there a spirit she comes to that field
[1:46:59] and she speaks to him vomits showed me
[1:47:01] her said kindness goodness and then
[1:47:05] after the barley harvest where that
[1:47:08] Naomi has directed her delay at his feet
[1:47:12] he said unto her thou has shown me that
[1:47:17] I shown greater has said kindness in the
[1:47:21] latter than they did in the beginning
[1:47:23] why because in the beginning she chose
[1:47:27] to come to Israel but what's greater is
[1:47:30] that she chose
[1:47:33] who was there oh it's a great thing
[1:47:41] listen to me now it's a great thing to
[1:47:44] say Lord I want to serve you Lord I want
[1:47:47] to live for you that's a great thing but
[1:47:49] it's a greater thing to receive him who
[1:47:54] calls you and is drawing to your heart
[1:47:57] to sail our beyond just knowing you
[1:48:00] beyond just knowing these truth they
[1:48:02] aren't just being in a church lord I
[1:48:04] want to know the Lord that is showing
[1:48:09] has said kindness and goodness
[1:48:12] back to him who has shown it to you is
[1:48:17] all right so this mercy is reciprocated
[1:48:21] you can only show the mercy that has
[1:48:25] been displayed and you have received all
[1:48:29] right jesus said in the Beatitudes David
[1:48:37] says it in the Psalms on to the upright
[1:48:39] now will show thyself merciful blessed
[1:48:44] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[1:48:47] mercy the right even in the prayer think
[1:48:52] of this now even in the prayer that is
[1:48:55] mentioned in the scriptures in regarding
[1:48:58] that of perfect faith where it's
[1:49:01] speaking of in our prayer forgiveness
[1:49:04] ELISA perfect faith is not just based on
[1:49:07] our forgiveness from God it's based on
[1:49:09] you and I'm living where no one else
[1:49:13] owes us well that one did I guess we
[1:49:19] just stop there today
[1:49:20] forgiveness is where you're not holding
[1:49:22] anybody else in debt because remember in
[1:49:30] that passage of Scripture the man wanted
[1:49:33] to be free he begged he begged that the
[1:49:36] king
[1:49:37] please forgive me of my debt the King
[1:49:39] never gave me his debt then he went back
[1:49:40] to one who owed him as a you paid me
[1:49:43] so he didn't he didn't just receive
[1:49:46] forgiveness he missed what it was all
[1:49:49] about it was pardon pardon that's where
[1:49:56] Jesus could say em you pray yeah
[1:50:01] remember you have any haunt should go
[1:50:03] make that right and he says the word
[1:50:06] compassion have compassion the word
[1:50:09] mercy are you with me
[1:50:13] hey listen friends we can stand against
[1:50:15] wrong but you have to have the right
[1:50:16] attitude the Scriptures all the way
[1:50:19] through all the way through the Prophet
[1:50:21] standing right there in ministering
[1:50:23] things even when the Spirit of God
[1:50:24] remember when the Prophet was calling
[1:50:26] things Rickey's and ricotta's remember
[1:50:27] that the Spirit of God corrected him
[1:50:29] come on somebody pick it on up after
[1:50:32] that you find in continuing to say Ricky
[1:50:34] Xandra Karras what's the difference
[1:50:36] what's the difference the difference is
[1:50:39] is that it is said with the love of God
[1:50:48] but you see because think about what the
[1:50:50] Prophet said many of a just as the
[1:51:03] Prophet needed him the mercy the tender
[1:51:04] mercies of God right there you and I the
[1:51:11] gospel calls out wrong the Prophet stood
[1:51:14] right there call it out wrong that's
[1:51:17] God's mercy you said brother Simon what
[1:51:20] I would have to me I've got the Holy
[1:51:22] Ghost that's because you and I are not
[1:51:24] listen when God gave us the Holy Ghost
[1:51:26] it did not make a self-reliant no sir
[1:51:29] that's that that's contrary to the
[1:51:32] nature when God feels with the Holy
[1:51:35] Spirit that is because there has been a
[1:51:38] union and we say yes Lord you are my
[1:51:42] husband you are my lord you are my
[1:51:45] provider remember he takes the veil and
[1:51:46] puts it on his shoulder showing I have
[1:51:48] complete care and oversight for your
[1:51:51] life
[1:51:51] is that right so that's these are the
[1:51:54] things these are things where the Holy
[1:51:55] Spirit will speak to us to mention and
[1:51:58] call different things I like to that we
[1:52:00] might be directed within these things
[1:52:02] and sometimes it's hard
[1:52:06] my role tired look at this Paul he deals
[1:52:22] with this let me read here in Romans
[1:52:25] 1134 as ye in times past he saw about
[1:52:27] their wild branch that was crafted in ye
[1:52:30] in times past have not believed God yet
[1:52:33] have now obtained mercy through their
[1:52:36] unbelief that's what we see with Joseph
[1:52:38] down there you see that because of their
[1:52:40] unbelief we've obtained mercy even so
[1:52:43] have these also now not believe that
[1:52:46] through your mercy they also may obtain
[1:52:49] mercy back to Ruth and Naomi Ruth
[1:52:55] receives that child and gives back to
[1:52:58] that child and they only becomes nurse
[1:53:02] right this gospel returning back to the
[1:53:06] Jews it was their and unbelief but
[1:53:11] because they had rejected it mercy has
[1:53:15] been extended to us it wasn't God saying
[1:53:17] oh no I gotta find somebody
[1:53:18] no that was all in God's plan it was
[1:53:23] hidden it was hidden there I wonder how
[1:53:27] much when they would read over Hosea and
[1:53:29] Paul picks us up and Hosea Peter picks
[1:53:32] up on Hosea said and the other places
[1:53:34] and Isaiah I wonder how many times that
[1:53:36] they ran over those things concerning
[1:53:38] that of the Gentiles and they just ran
[1:53:40] over but God spoke those things with you
[1:53:44] and I in mind Oh for God hath concluded
[1:53:54] them all in unbelief that he might have
[1:53:59] mercy upon all
[1:54:04] aren't you grateful that God
[1:54:08] g-got isn't not run around and picking
[1:54:10] people out right now it's his word that
[1:54:13] goes forward that draws you and I to him
[1:54:17] watch how what's how Paul describes this
[1:54:20] in Romans nine my let me just try it let
[1:54:24] me let me just try to get here just a
[1:54:25] little further and then then we'll close
[1:54:27] it here Romans nine what shall we say
[1:54:34] then is there unrighteousness with God
[1:54:36] god forbid what huh what a way to start
[1:54:40] this this Duren righteousness was gone
[1:54:43] where he say it to Moses I will have
[1:54:46] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[1:54:50] will have compassion on whom I will have
[1:54:53] compassion so then it is not of him that
[1:54:57] willeth nor of him that runneth but of
[1:54:59] God that showeth mercy and he goes on to
[1:55:03] speak of Pharaoh I've raised him up for
[1:55:05] this same purpose that I might show my
[1:55:07] power indeed that and that my name might
[1:55:09] be declared throughout all the earth
[1:55:17] because we've been looking out Thursday
[1:55:19] night if we can see this that God
[1:55:24] permits circumstances and things to
[1:55:27] arrive that he might declare his name
[1:55:34] when the waters were bitter there in
[1:55:39] Israel and they came to a troublesome
[1:55:41] time God revealed himself here to be not
[1:55:48] just their provider but he revealed
[1:55:51] himself in an attribute of one of the
[1:55:54] compound redemptive names of Jehovah God
[1:55:59] took those situations even when amalaka
[1:56:02] DeRose God revealed himself unto Israel
[1:56:05] is that right as to hold our banner see
[1:56:08] God revealing he's making himself known
[1:56:11] to you and I he's declaring his name
[1:56:14] oh my therefore hath he mercy on whom he
[1:56:18] will have mercy and whom he will he
[1:56:20] hardeneth what if God willing to show
[1:56:23] his wrath and to make his power known
[1:56:25] endured with much long-suffering the
[1:56:27] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[1:56:28] and that he might make known the riches
[1:56:31] of his glory on the vessels of Mercy
[1:56:35] which he had afore prepared unto glory
[1:56:40] so you have not just become a vessel of
[1:56:44] mercy
[1:56:44] you always were you were prepared for
[1:56:48] that you were prepared of for to receive
[1:56:54] His mercy in this hour that mercy that
[1:56:59] God has reserved behold I will send them
[1:57:07] to you Elijah the Prophet before that
[1:57:10] great and dreadful day of the Lord lest
[1:57:14] I come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:57:19] God's promised visitation of here's
[1:57:22] mercy that he kept but that mercy must
[1:57:26] be ministered to what's needed is that
[1:57:30] steadfast love that has held God to his
[1:57:33] word to his covenant
[1:57:35] now the compassion of God moves down to
[1:57:40] go to work and show his mercy on vessels
[1:57:46] of mercy you and I listen this morning
[1:57:53] prepared as a bedding ground before the
[1:57:56] foundation of the world to receive the
[1:58:00] word that God would send in this hour
[1:58:04] well the rest of the the world can
[1:58:07] reject it and they look and say I don't
[1:58:09] want anything to do with that but for
[1:58:11] you and I it's not about a do's and
[1:58:13] don'ts
[1:58:14] it's Christ it's a life there's a lot
[1:58:17] there is something to ask that all of a
[1:58:20] sudden the darkness that was we were
[1:58:22] encapsulated
[1:58:23] now is broken from around our lives
[1:58:28] that's a mercy of God you see it doesn't
[1:58:32] mean it doesn't matter if it's just
[1:58:33] mercy being held but God just don't hold
[1:58:35] mercy just to hold it
[1:58:37] mercy is held so that from that mercy
[1:58:42] God comes to minister to bring forth
[1:58:46] what he's calling it's all left up to
[1:58:52] him even us whom he hath called not of
[1:58:58] the Jews only but also of the Gentiles
[1:59:06] Moses and Pharaoh they look through the
[1:59:08] same window and once you catch this here
[1:59:11] look look kind of a prophet will use
[1:59:13] those things they look through the same
[1:59:14] window let me say to you this morning
[1:59:18] every one of you from the youngest to
[1:59:20] the oldest there is an window that is
[1:59:22] set before you what do you see when you
[1:59:26] look through this window
[1:59:29] do you see God who is faithful to his
[1:59:33] word to fulfill his promise or do you
[1:59:38] see it as bondage or do you see it as I
[1:59:41] can never live that way how do you see
[1:59:44] it do you see yourself because remember
[1:59:47] this window a window itself can be a
[1:59:49] reflection how do you see yourself when
[1:59:51] you look into this word I'm a pretty
[1:59:54] good person I do that's not what I'm
[1:59:55] asking if you're a pretty good person
[2:00:00] and that's all that's needed then
[2:00:01] Calvary's Calvary was none needed
[2:00:04] brother Samuel that's simple but it's
[2:00:07] true
[2:00:07] the mercy of God is not God coming down
[2:00:11] with blinders on it's God coming to deal
[2:00:16] and to move upon our hearts call us to
[2:00:23] repentance
[2:00:27] yes sir call us to repentance
[2:00:33] my this is where Peter could say in
[2:00:37] first Peter chapter 2 verse 9 you are a
[2:00:41] chosen generation a royal priesthood an
[2:00:45] holy nation a peculiar people that you
[2:00:50] should show forth the praises of him who
[2:00:52] hath called you out of darkness and into
[2:00:57] his marvelous light which in times past
[2:01:01] were not a people but are not the people
[2:01:05] of God which had not obtained mercy but
[2:01:10] have now obtained mercy that obtaining
[2:01:14] was not is not speaking of what we've
[2:01:15] done it's speaking of God's great mercy
[2:01:19] that has been extended to you and hi but
[2:01:25] remember if that mercy is not accepted
[2:01:30] then the only thing that's left is
[2:01:32] judgment and I say it like this here you
[2:01:37] have sometimes we come down to you come
[2:01:43] down into situations for the brown
[2:01:46] you're you know he it makes a statement
[2:01:51] here in the latter part in 63 there in
[2:01:54] July 24th he says sometimes you could
[2:01:58] come down and you see a person that has
[2:02:00] passed away and you think that person
[2:02:06] they never had an opportunity the Rebbe
[2:02:09] said that's not true
[2:02:10] he said because every mortal
[2:02:18] he said there's a voice that deals with
[2:02:21] the heart that would cause them to think
[2:02:25] caused them to consider where are you at
[2:02:30] now see even while the words being
[2:02:33] preached there's a there's a voice
[2:02:37] Marilla said before you you you can look
[2:02:40] at it I could just get out see what is
[2:02:42] that I want you to look at this now look
[2:02:44] on the Spirit of God coming help you
[2:02:46] give give you determine on what would
[2:02:48] want to cause you to get out from this
[2:02:49] present it wouldn't be the Spirit of God
[2:02:53] who's trying to draw you but let me let
[2:02:55] me just share this with you I just I'm
[2:02:58] just sharing this serving God being born
[2:03:05] of the Spirit of God it's not about you
[2:03:08] trying to keep I can't do that I can't
[2:03:14] do that this is too hard you're looking
[2:03:17] at it through the earthly lens you're
[2:03:21] looking at it through your earthly
[2:03:22] strength you're looking at it with
[2:03:24] desires still alive in your life it's
[2:03:29] not about what you can keep the Holy
[2:03:32] Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ
[2:03:37] coming to dwell in and live his life
[2:03:46] through you not you trying to live it or
[2:03:51] I'm gonna try to do this I'm gonna try
[2:03:53] to do this I mean you're saying that we
[2:03:55] shouldn't take the word and we know
[2:03:56] that's not what I'm saying what I'm
[2:03:58] saying it's not your strength
[2:04:02] it's your strength yielded
[2:04:07] and he lives his life through you it
[2:04:12] changes you from within mine that's
[2:04:18] God's mercy
[2:04:20] that's his mercy his mercy if it was not
[2:04:24] mercy if it was justice and judgment he
[2:04:26] could leave you right in the condition
[2:04:27] you're in
[2:04:28] but his mercy sends forth his word to
[2:04:33] minister to our lives
[2:04:35] that's the mercy of God to minister to
[2:04:39] us think about this as we look at this
[2:04:43] here when we've come from here this
[2:04:46] morning in looking at the grace of God
[2:04:49] the scripture says God's goodness here
[2:04:51] in Romans chapter 2 verse 4 I love this
[2:04:54] passage of Scripture the goodness of God
[2:04:57] leadeth thee it's not the evilness of
[2:05:06] God that does what brings conviction
[2:05:13] he deals with where you are and where
[2:05:16] you should be
[2:05:18] listen now remember where we were
[2:05:20] remember remember where we were looking
[2:05:22] at last week where we left off in
[2:05:24] nehemiah chapter 9 where god was
[2:05:27] speaking there through nehemiah where he
[2:05:29] was recounting where God had brought
[2:05:32] Israel and how his pardoning grace had
[2:05:35] been there the multitude of his mercies
[2:05:36] the manifold mercies of God all of this
[2:05:38] had been there when they had fallen away
[2:05:40] thou sent two saviors to deliver them
[2:05:43] and he's talking about God's manifold
[2:05:48] mercies much mercy these very things and
[2:05:53] he says thou sent us that good spirit to
[2:05:56] instruct them what what good does it do
[2:06:00] without having his leadership his mercy
[2:06:03] provides leadership that's why James
[2:06:07] could even say that even going through
[2:06:09] the midst of a test or trial if any lack
[2:06:12] wisdom let him ask God who giveth
[2:06:16] liberally abundantly God makes himself
[2:06:24] known he makes himself clear the same
[2:06:28] God I want you think of this right here
[2:06:30] the same God as he's watched over your
[2:06:36] life what's over my life and this is
[2:06:38] even speaking to someone here this
[2:06:40] morning because I realized as my voice
[2:06:42] all throughout this congregation there
[2:06:44] can be lives that have already been
[2:06:47] sealed away and yet we still stand in
[2:06:49] good need of God's mercy there's other
[2:06:52] lives that have come to the Lord
[2:06:53] but yet have not responded to fully to
[2:06:56] his call we've come to enjoy his
[2:06:59] services and come to enjoy mind the work
[2:07:01] but have you made the step to say Lord I
[2:07:03] want to repent of my sins you don't want
[2:07:08] to just come and feed on the word and
[2:07:10] don't repent you want to receive the
[2:07:13] benefits of the word don't you you don't
[2:07:16] want to have nutrient blockers in your
[2:07:18] life you want to receive the benefits
[2:07:20] you say what is that repentance you
[2:07:22] might say Oh send my order
[2:07:24] then let me ask you the other part
[2:07:26] that's coupled with that have you've
[2:07:28] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:07:31] Jesus Christ that's another part of it
[2:07:34] that's the goodness of God when there
[2:07:37] were people standing there on the day of
[2:07:39] Pentecost what must we do to be saved
[2:07:43] what happened the mercy of God came
[2:07:46] forth with leadership and instruction
[2:07:49] and said repent and be baptized in the
[2:07:52] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:07:54] of your sins and you shall receive the
[2:07:57] gift of the Holy Ghost that is God's
[2:08:00] Word okay if you're sitting here this
[2:08:05] morning and you don't have that life
[2:08:07] within you God's desire is to give it to
[2:08:10] them it's not God was holding back and
[2:08:16] was holding back his desire is to fill
[2:08:19] your life that's his mercy he watches
[2:08:29] over your life watches over my life your
[2:08:33] life my life listen no matter how young
[2:08:35] you are how old you are your life
[2:08:38] there's not a promise of the next moment
[2:08:41] how many young people you read about
[2:08:43] even throughout a a week time their life
[2:08:47] taken away sometimes you read of things
[2:08:50] you think what a freak accident what a a
[2:08:53] moment what a life was snuffed out like
[2:08:56] that it doesn't age doesn't mean
[2:08:58] anything what's important is to respond
[2:09:03] when he's calling me say this to you if
[2:09:06] he's leading and he's directing you
[2:09:08] whether it's in repentance no matter
[2:09:11] what stage it is in your life he is
[2:09:14] faithful to lead you all the way I want
[2:09:17] you to catch this he didn't say that the
[2:09:19] goodness of God pointed you Leah
[2:09:25] wanted to leave he must be present and
[2:09:29] not just one who's just standing by like
[2:09:31] a greeter at Walmart go here how you
[2:09:33] doing
[2:09:34] have a good day no he said I want to go
[2:09:36] with you be with you in you dwelling you
[2:09:40] it has been your life I want to change
[2:09:42] your life I want to clean your life up
[2:09:45] I'll tell you what he changes he changes
[2:09:49] lives yes he does he cleans lives up he
[2:09:55] called tell you I didn't know longer
[2:09:57] about you searching for a dress code
[2:09:58] it's that your desire your heart is to
[2:10:00] please him things begin to fall away
[2:10:04] things begin to move away from your life
[2:10:06] is that right the things begin to come
[2:10:10] away although you know when you look at
[2:10:12] it the makeup begins to fade away all
[2:10:13] the desire to cut the hair of those
[2:10:15] things fade away the earrings drop out
[2:10:17] of the years come on somebody you
[2:10:19] understand those things God put that in
[2:10:21] his word that those things in the Book
[2:10:23] of Jeremiah in the Book of Isaiah God
[2:10:25] considered those things to be rebellion
[2:10:27] against him whoa
[2:10:29] nada no we're going there today but
[2:10:31] we're here that's the mercy of God
[2:10:38] that's not mercy that he would lend you
[2:10:42] and I know what our desire is to reflect
[2:10:44] him that's why the scripture says let
[2:10:46] the woman be clothed in modest apparel
[2:10:50] modest apparel don't mean the latest
[2:10:53] fashion modest the word means free
[2:10:56] flowing garment oh I'm talking about the
[2:11:02] goodness of God here I'm talking about
[2:11:04] his head the mercy of God that's why in
[2:11:10] everything you have to watch where
[2:11:12] you're going you have to watch let me
[2:11:14] tell you something when you go around
[2:11:15] those clothing stores I don't care if
[2:11:17] they play all their brother Sam and they
[2:11:19] play Christian music there's demons on
[2:11:20] them racks and they're just as much
[2:11:23] demons on the men's racks as there is on
[2:11:25] the women's rats now
[2:11:27] because you got all types of people
[2:11:29] designing clothes whoo that's the truth
[2:11:35] that's why it behooves you and I to pray
[2:11:42] it changes a life listen friends I mean
[2:11:46] let me just be very clear I I know I
[2:11:48] told you I'm finishing up I really am I
[2:11:50] can't even get to where I'm getting so I
[2:11:52] won't get to where I'm getting I'll just
[2:11:53] stop to where I want the goodness of God
[2:11:59] leadeth to repentance
[2:12:01] this enough I want you understand this
[2:12:03] right here when the Spirit of God speaks
[2:12:06] out and many times hear about about
[2:12:07] being in the house of God not talking
[2:12:10] about conforming to a law of a church
[2:12:12] when it deals with things within that
[2:12:14] address and how that we conduct
[2:12:16] ourselves it is not about well I'm gonna
[2:12:18] conform to that right there there's
[2:12:20] something that in the word that I think
[2:12:22] God that when God would call our
[2:12:24] attention that we're mindful of those
[2:12:26] things but you know it's more than just
[2:12:28] saying well I'm gonna do it because you
[2:12:29] know brother Sam you brought it up I'm
[2:12:31] gonna do it listen friends these are not
[2:12:33] things that brother Samuel sets around
[2:12:34] and studies on to bring up there are
[2:12:38] things I study on and bring up I might
[2:12:40] see different needs but this is what I'm
[2:12:42] trying to tell you if all they responds
[2:12:44] to is come into the house of God that
[2:12:46] gets old but you need to say Lord is
[2:12:49] there something not right with my life
[2:12:52] is there something that I'm missing to
[2:12:56] where that entry excuse becomes
[2:12:59] preeminent over being in the house of
[2:13:01] God is there something about it in my
[2:13:06] life this is the time of reflection
[2:13:10] because you won't have that later this
[2:13:13] is a time of reflection oh my
[2:13:20] may God help us we're living in a time
[2:13:25] where God's mercy has been has been
[2:13:26] extended to you and I but his spirit
[2:13:29] will not always strive with man a part
[2:13:32] of the richness of God's mercy is how
[2:13:34] God would speak to us again there's a
[2:13:45] term that he uses here in the scriptures
[2:13:47] the word mercies nehemiah uses it David
[2:13:52] uses it and it's the word that deals
[2:13:55] with compassion and God told Israel
[2:14:02] Isaiah 46 he says look at the rest of
[2:14:08] these gods that are crafting men craft
[2:14:11] them up put them here talk to him they
[2:14:18] can't talk back to him and the God is
[2:14:22] dependent upon the man and God told him
[2:14:28] he said but I have I've carried you in
[2:14:35] the womb I have watched over you I have
[2:14:40] stretched my compassion over here and
[2:14:44] God let it be known there shall be a
[2:14:47] return of salvation to Israel not
[2:14:51] because man packing an idol because God
[2:14:55] watching over his word God has watched
[2:15:01] over your life my life to bring us into
[2:15:06] this place of where we are here this
[2:15:08] morning even when we weren't even aware
[2:15:11] of it and we're going around it's bad
[2:15:13] mercy that our life was not snuffed from
[2:15:16] us before we received his Redemption yes
[2:15:22] sir didn't matter if we were sitting in
[2:15:25] a message church we needed Redemption we
[2:15:29] needed a sovereign where
[2:15:31] my sovereign god the compounding Li
[2:15:34] claim on our soul is that Alright he's
[2:15:39] watched over your life he's kept over
[2:15:41] your life but all in the midst of this
[2:15:43] time Wow now we can look back we can
[2:15:47] look to that and say God you like
[2:15:51] Jeremiah could say David could say you
[2:15:53] knew me David could say in Psalms 139
[2:15:57] how wondrous are thy thoughts Hal
[2:16:01] innumerable more than the sands of God
[2:16:05] for before my eye was even in the womb
[2:16:09] and my members were in your book yet
[2:16:11] being unperfect yet there I was God knew
[2:16:15] of you knew of me and he watched over
[2:16:18] your life what's true my life for what
[2:16:20] for this moment for the moment where he
[2:16:24] would bring and make himself known to
[2:16:26] you aren't you glad for that mercy your
[2:16:30] life could have been snuffed out but the
[2:16:32] mercy of God watched over your life you
[2:16:39] might say brother Samuel I never back
[2:16:41] slid back on the world but have you ever
[2:16:42] back slid on his presence have you ever
[2:16:46] a black back slid where you may not have
[2:16:47] forsaken him in coming here and being
[2:16:50] here but have you ever forsook him in
[2:16:52] your attitude oh Jesus but his mercies
[2:17:02] [Applause]
[2:17:04] hallelujah and the Book of Lamentations
[2:17:06] the Prophet said well thy Compassion's
[2:17:10] and night mercies they fail not O God
[2:17:14] they are new every morning Oh My yes we
[2:17:22] need God's mercy yes we need God's mercy
[2:17:25] and we want to be receptive of his mercy
[2:17:30] that's why this morning no matter where
[2:17:32] you're at who you are where you are in
[2:17:34] here even listening to the sound of my
[2:17:36] voice that perhaps would even stream
[2:17:38] this it's important to recognize where
[2:17:40] am I at have I accepted the full
[2:17:43] provision that God has extended in this
[2:17:46] hour if I accepted it listen God desires
[2:17:51] he listen
[2:17:52] God's desire when he leads to repentance
[2:17:54] repentance it's a breaking it's a
[2:17:58] dissolving it's an a boring of those
[2:18:01] things it's a turning from that's the
[2:18:05] grace of God you know it's God's grace
[2:18:07] to even bring you to that place to where
[2:18:09] you desire to read that that's God
[2:18:13] working on your life you said by the
[2:18:15] saying I had that I had that breaking
[2:18:16] forth before I ever entered into this
[2:18:18] church that was the mercy
[2:18:22] because to think if his mercy had not
[2:18:24] moved on you like that you coming in
[2:18:26] here and hearing the word yes oh my I
[2:18:29] don't know I don't think I can do that
[2:18:30] brother Samuel even if even with me
[2:18:33] being one of his own God prepares you to
[2:18:37] receive his mercy and he knows each and
[2:18:43] every one
[2:18:43] so I say here this morning if you
[2:18:46] haven't repented you need to repent if
[2:18:50] you have not been baptized in the name
[2:18:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to be
[2:18:54] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:55] Christ don't just do it because I'm
[2:18:56] saying it I'm giving you a command by
[2:18:59] the word this is what God's waters are
[2:19:02] as the Prophet stood there in the first
[2:19:04] seal stands there in the fifth so he
[2:19:06] says follow his word follow his command
[2:19:08] all the way that's what your desire is
[2:19:11] what you're longing for when you come
[2:19:13] and you worship and you're looking for
[2:19:15] what is it you want not just to come
[2:19:17] here and worship that Living God but you
[2:19:20] want that Living God to go with you to
[2:19:23] where your life it's not just your hands
[2:19:26] that are up but your life has been
[2:19:28] raised up amen
[2:19:35] it's with conviction where the word
[2:19:37] strikes your heart where the word leads
[2:19:38] your life where there's things within
[2:19:40] your life and say Lord I want that depth
[2:19:43] of walk
[2:19:49] you love him this morning power I wonder
[2:19:58] for someone here as every head is bowed
[2:20:00] and every eye is closed I tell you this
[2:20:03] how God is working straight at this
[2:20:05] service here I believe God is mindful as
[2:20:09] he is in every service and I ask you
[2:20:12] this morning is there any here then you
[2:20:16] look at this and you were looking God's
[2:20:18] Word and the Holy Spirit is dealt with
[2:20:20] your heart and you say Lord I need to
[2:20:28] repent move to repentance not just I see
[2:20:43] that knee not just to be acquainted with
[2:20:45] it but I want to be identified with that
[2:20:47] name you see what what woman coming up
[2:20:51] here to be married would say no no no no
[2:20:54] no I I don't I don't want you I don't
[2:20:55] want your name I'll just keep my own but
[2:20:58] that woman coming up here she's coming
[2:21:00] up here because there is a man who
[2:21:03] initiated the covenant and that man has
[2:21:06] entered the room and he initiated that
[2:21:08] covenant and she's coming to take his
[2:21:11] name to bear it's like I wonder this
[2:21:15] morning even just with an uplifted hand
[2:21:19] for those that have not moved into that
[2:21:21] place
[2:21:24] coming Lord I'm surrender anymore
[2:21:29] giving my old
[2:21:32] god bless you
[2:21:35] I wonder
[2:21:38] as the holy spirit just moving
[2:21:40] throughout the congregation maybe you
[2:21:44] raise your hand and say Lord
[2:21:46] I need a deeper experience
[2:21:50] I need an ether experience I want that
[2:21:52] life it means what it is now now that
[2:22:09] you've raised your hand we're gonna pray
[2:22:12] but remember this you've responded not
[2:22:15] to brother Samuel you responded to him
[2:22:20] and remember he's not here pointing he's
[2:22:23] here to lead you so that desire that he
[2:22:27] has stirred up within your heart he's
[2:22:29] here to lead you to where that that
[2:22:33] desire becomes a reality
[2:22:37] he's a faithful God
[2:22:45] or Jesus

[2:23:49] the midst Lord of a service like this
[2:23:52] how that you can take a word and you can
[2:23:57] so personally speak to our lives and
[2:24:02] deal with us in an individual way and
[2:24:07] yet Lord you speak to all of us we want
[2:24:12] to say thank you Lord for your love in
