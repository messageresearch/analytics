========================================

keep on trusting that is working everything for my girl and inside and heaven [Music] I'm gonna make ooh Oh he walks beside me yes walks beside me and heaven the rapture is a [Music] I'm gonna make [Music] wanna make you for you hallelujah amen that's our confession tonight a man I'm gonna make it amen he already made it and that same life that has been deposited in our lives he's already make it he's already he's our forerunner amen and we have the earnest of the Spirit amen we have received the earnest the down posit the down payment the assurance we just had just time here this this morning and early afternoon with the family there of the zealot on family but the claudio's family there and brother and sister keener we were there and then the funeral this morning and just quite a quite a brother quite a brother and a man brother brother Claudio and most of you read the ride out but you know you get to know so many things so many more things about him but one thing that was above all you know of all the achievements you can do in life they had a a whole table that was set out I had every passport on it that he ever had and every stamping and all of the pictures and you know how it is when you go to a funeral those things sometimes those are snapshots moments in time that many others can relive and we can look at it and say mine this and that but to think of all the accomplishments that a person you or I or anyone else could ever have in life if we miss eternal life we've missed everything everything has been missed but eternal life is what really the purpose of the you and I being here in this life there's one purpose and that's to be germanized by the holy spirit and I you know we were looking at that on the table and I mentioned to the people of the VESA on it and when the stamp of the visa the seal it says you can come and go so we don't want to just be believers too leave on because to believe is to receive the passport but when the Holy Ghost has come you then have the seal amen you have the actual embassy of where you're going has recognized your entry and says your entry is guaranteed you have met all qualifications to enter here in that wonderful the Lord Jesus said I am the door and I am the Shepherd of the sheep hold whoever enters in by me and is saved he shall come in and out and find pasture in that wonderful we entered in but then still within our lives we go about our lives but yet the thing that's happened is were changed we're no longer the same and we are feeding feeding from him amen the Lord is so good so mindful that he would pass by our way and we're so grateful to have brother Andrew and sister Mariah here with us tonight and glad that they took the time to come here and and be with us and just bless us tonight with the gift that God has placed there in their life and we want to pull on the gift of God tonight you know you think about it a man can study and he'll study he'll give himself inspiration by the Spirit of God we'll move him in certain ways and channels that can actually take him even from whatever that he might be thinking he's going to preach and then something else will come out of that but then still the man doesn't know how he's going to actually move when it actually comes right here because the Holy Ghost is who takes control anybody can read anybody can read quotes anybody can read scriptures but when the Holy Ghost gets ahold of that word begins to break that word a whole nigh it does something to believers that's him that's him and that's who we want to see tonight and you you just remember this tonight all of us remember this the gift that God has placed in our brother's life was not for brother Andrew it was for us and these gifts how God will come right down and he'll speak right to our needs tonight so if whatever that you have need of a question you have something in your life maybe healing whatever it might be you need the Holy Ghost you put that on the altar of God tonight and say Lord passed by my way Lord take the gift that is within that man's life and speak to my heart let the fire of God come down Lord and minister to me may I walk out of here different than when I came in and you watch him come on the scene man let's just welcome amen brother Andrews he would come and let's sing a song you are great you do miracles so great that is

evening Amen I'm thankful to know tonight that our God is not dead amen we're entering into the Easter season the prophet of God called it the pre Easter season and they're always pointing back at Christmas time to a baby in a manger Easter they're pointing back to a tomb but I'm glad to know tonight he's not in that tomb but he's in the heart of the believers tonight aren't you thankful for that they meant to know that deity is not in heaven but deity is on the earth tonight a man aren't you aren't you thankful to be full of deity amen there's a lot of things we could be full of tonight we could be full of creeds or religions or dogmas or traditions amen but to be full of the Holy Ghost what what greater thing amen to know that the miracle worker is not a million miles away but the miracle worker is only inside of you tonight don't you love the Lord amen god bless you bless you could we just bow our heads together and just humble our spirits this evening in this presence maybe you have a special lead upon your heart you just like the Lord to speak to you tonight let's just approach him and ask him to come Heavenly Father Lord we come to this evening dear God and we are Lord indeed grateful to be called your children or we are thankful that we are on this journey Lord Lord this Christian journey father your prophet has told us we're in a third X to the slaughter Lord we're not on our way to a natural land we're not on our way to a natural kingdom but Lord we're on our way to that great Millennium Lord that great hereafter and father on this journey there are many obstacles Lord there are Lord of many turns in the road father that become Lord so quickly upon us that they're unexpected but Lord we're so thankful to know tonight that you're the same yesterday

that you would come Lords you see the hands that are lifted Lord all across this field and Lord we look to you to not God Lord may you come in this building Lord if there would be one sick among us tonight Lord I pray that the Holy Ghost would heal him if there would be one bound tonight I pray Lord that the Spirit of God would set him free Lord if there would one here tonight they would not have Lord the Holy Ghost of God Lord not just up on their flesh Lord or just in their spirit their God but Lord if they would not have it up on their soul to our Father I pray tonight dear God that the Holy Ghost that filled the Upper Room Lord would fill this building tonight their God may every vessel Lord be filled with the Holy Ghost if there would be one that's had it Lord for a long time and Lord maybe they've become cold or become relaxed sort I pray tonight Lord that you would send a refilling of a Holy Ghost and fire in this building Lord that when this service would be dismissed we could say they're not our hearts burn within us as you come and talk to us along the way and father whatever is accomplished in this meeting tonight will be sure Lord to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory but we ask these things in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believers said hey man god bless you this evening do you love the Lord amen are you happy to be a Christian amen god bless you this evening if you have your Bibles we'll go straight to the word I'm aware it's a midweek service but I assure him thankful for midweek services amen amen in the Bible we'll turn the book of Zachariah chapter number four I know sometimes people think that the Lord really can't move on the midweek but I believe the Lord can move any time he wants to don't you Amen I was with a brother one time I never will forget it brother Sammy I was with the brother one time and it was on a Wednesday night and he said well I got a preach tonight he said so I better go in here and see if I can't find something to say I really don't feel like putting too much effort in he said I'll go see if I can find something to say and I didn't say it out loud but down into my heart I thought I'm glad I don't have to sit through the Hat amen because I don't think the Lord just deserves our all on Sunday I think he deserves her all on the Wednesday or Thursday or a Friday amen any day of the week God is still God you believe that tonight amen gonna Ritchie bless you we certainly appreciate brother Samuel and his friendship and his family and the opportunity to be here tonight and this pray week can be a small blessing to you this evening we want to look here in the book of Zechariah chapter number four and we'll read verse number one down a couple verses here if you don't mind standing with me if you could give me just a little bit more on these monitors I'd appreciate it Zechariah chapter 4 and verse 1 the Bible says and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me what see us thou and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and the seven lamps they're all in seven pipes - the seven lamps now but I said that's lamp stand or seven Church ages which are up on the top thereof and two olive trees he said that's that old and new Testament buy it one up on the right side of the bowl the other up on the left side thereof and I answered inspect to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord and then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel for thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the head stone therefore was shouting crying grace grace unto it moreover the word the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of the house his hands also shall finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord God of hosts hath sent me unto you notice this for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven they they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth we just asked the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you may be seated for just a few moments we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God a man we thank the Lord that the word is still being preached and that there's still power in the ministering of the word of God I won't do tonight by the help of the Lord just for a few moments if I could speak to you upon a thought and if I were toilet I would like to speak to you on overcoming opposition over humming opposition I think of the prophet of God preaching the message to us on how can I overcome and I believe tonight that every one of us are here because we're desiring to be overcomers we're desiring not just to be church members not to just be message believers so much but to be real overcomers for we know that in every age there has been an overcomer no matter how dark the age no matter how long the age how short the AIDS no matter the opposition of the age there has always been an overcomer and I think tonight that every one of us can fellowship upon this thought that no matter if you've been serving the Lord for five years or if you've been serving the Lord for 50 years no matter if you're a preacher if you're a deacon or if you're just a lay member or even if you're just a young person I believe every one of us can say that we are surrounded by opposition I believe there's opposition all around us and I believe tonight that that opposition has not come to defeat us but I believe that opposition has come to make us who God saw us before the foundation of a world I think of how that opposition comes and how that opposition and adversity comes but the beautiful thing about it is we have been anointed amen to overcome the opposition I look here in Romans chapter 7 verse 21 Paul says amen I found in a law that when I would do good amen evil is present with me now balem says there's two laws at work here he said there's the law of sin and then there's the law of death he's sitting on both the laws a men are at work a men of the law of sin and death in our flesh he said but then there's the law of the Spirit which is the spirit of life that works in our heart in the message question answers 59 now the law in sin and death works in your flesh but the law or the spirit of life works in your heart so your heart or your spirit in your heart will make your body obey what it says blue that's exactly right he said Paul said the flesh is always there the flesh says well I'm too tired or I'm unable I'm not sufficient I cannot do it he said like I told my daughter and all their lawyers just a few moments ago or Delores Amen she said what is it that when I go receive the Holy Ghost weather when something makes me feel the way I should feel he said right when I begin to feel good then something comes upon me to stomp me he said I told her well that's the devil see that devil seemed that you were ready to receive it and he said I'll put a little damper on her I'll fan her a little bit you know kind of cool it down he said but oh my that's when you rise they men that's when you rise a mint and claim your god-given rights now Amen do you realize that that's the same spirit that works in the church that's the same devil Amen that comes here on Thursday night that's the same devil that comes here on Sunday morning when the Holy Ghost amen begins to create an atmosphere in this building that all things are possible amen and no matter if you've had a bad day or if you've had a bad week or maybe you've been going through the hardest trial of your life and you come in the house of God and you begin to hear the songs and you begin to raise your hands and and then the burdens begin to lift off of you and then all of a sudden when you begin to feel Liberty come the devil comes and says well I'll put a damper on him but the prophet of God said that's not the time you lay down he said that's the time you rise amen and press through that opposition church I'll tell you we've come to a time where people and then they're no longer rugged Christians amen the least little thing that turns her praise the liesl opposition amen amen it used to be no matter how hard of a day you had you knew that if the devil ain't then tried to stop you is going to the house of God amen but now it's got to where if the kid has a hangnail or if the coffee pot breaks on Sunday morning we stay home and then that's what the devil wants the devil doesn't want this church amen to rise and the power the message of the hour amen but can I get a witness here tonight that says I'm not here they meant by the might of my flesh I'm not here by the power of my spirit but I'm here by the power of the Holy Ghost my to think tonight that there is a power and then inside of the church that we will not lay down and then and just let the devil take her family we won't lay down let the devil take our church we won't lay down and let the devil take our toy but there is a warrior on the inside of us hey we've done been through too many deserts they meant to lay down now we've done cross too many mountains they meant to lay down now there is something in our heart that is declaring there is victory Amen there is victory of Jesus and the devil's not going to cause us to lay down when we feel the moving of the Holy Ghost coming in that's not time to lay down that's time to rise amen and swing your sword like you've never swing it before this a brother ender the opposition is too hard well but Bama said no matter what the opposition looks like he says if you are determined how many Sturman here tonight he said if you are determined amen to find out truth that God will lead you and he will protect you isn't that a beautiful covenant to know that if you are determined amen to find truth how many it's determined you don't just want religion you just know what philosophy you just stole triology you just don't wanna but your intellectual conception but there is a cry only inside of your soul I want reality brother if there is a cry for reality only inside of your heart then there is reality somewhere to be happy the thing tonight church that the problem of God said look Amen at the Queen of the South look at her how she how she heard Amen that somewhere there was a Living God she heard that somewhere it was more than just a tradition then you say man she heard that somewhere it was more than just two gathering of a church but she heard there was a prophet in the land and that prophet had divine inspiration and that prophet was telling ship and he meant with the Living God and the prophet of God said something rose up only inside of her hungry hearts and she begin to cross over the dancer he said it wasn't a three minute walk he said it was a three month walk he said here's another thing he said the sons of Ishmael was out there and they were robbers hey men and they were thieves hey men but there's a beautiful thing there amen they could still hurt amble but they couldn't steal the desire that was on the inside of her hearts they meant to meet the Living God they could steal her jewelry but they couldn't stop the desire and brother we've come to denominational ages but there was a cry only inside of our heart there's a pride age somewhere there's a pride anointing somewhere and the Baptist tried to steal it and the Pentecostal tried to steal it but they couldn't steal that cheap seed that was placed only inside of your heart from before the foundation of the world there was something inside of her that said if I can just get through this there's going to be victory somewhere brother can I tell you that victory wasn't a million miles away that victory was just a few opposition's away and then you say well Andrew what kept her going what kept her going was the fact she knew that if I can just get through this if I can just get in the presence a men of this God I'm hungry for brother can I tell you tonight that same God is in this building right here tonight well brother Andrew I've had a terrible day join the crowd Amen well I got stuck in traffic join the crowd they meant well my battery went dead join the crowd listen there's nothing happening to you that has not already happened to somebody else but there is a promise here that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the opposition and if God be for us who can be against us I've come here to tell the devil tonight Satan take your hands off of God's property we are not here amen to be manhandled by some tradition we are here to find the reality that there is a Living God somewhere my the problem God's I'm kind of a small man he said I've got a small voice he said but I got a great big message listen Church you may have problems you may have situations I may have troubles but we got a great big message see and he said this message has not come from a man this message has come from the Lord he said I've got a lot of opposition from Satan to keep me from bringing it but we'll get here anyhow see that's how the Herman that william branham was to preach this message that no opposition was going to stop him you say well I don't know I've got too many inflections well I got a promise for you and then many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him from them all see many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord is going to deliver you how did that affliction brother can I tell you that's not what Andrew brother said that's not what William Branham said that's what the spirit of prophecy spoke to David some 2000 years ago and said there's going to be a lot of afflictions but there's also going to be a lot of deliverances come on Serge I'll tell you what tonight we're not in the hour of affliction we're in the hour of the levirate when the spirit of deliverance has crossed this land that éclairs hurts we are here and we are here to overcome my to think tonight the problem God said that affliction goes all the way back amen to the Garden of Eden all the way back in the Garden of Eden he said when the serpent came in and he beguiled Eve he said then he began to come in and begin to share his commentary on God's Word he said now watch the spirit of prophecy saying then I'll give you a savior a mentor I'll give you a massage genesis 3:15 and the woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head see and his head shall bruise her heel notice and his head shall bruise her heel to show that there would be an affliction to the church now watch if there's going to be an affliction to the church he did not say that there's just going to be an affliction to the church he said but he also said victory was going to come after be affliction my in the message Redemption completeness enjoy you know when you get the Holy Ghost you attend to a lot of obstacles but many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivers him out of them all see God brings you right up to it he said facing with it so he can show you his power and his goodness don't you see why God brought you to that situation he didn't bring you there to fall into defeat he bringing their to fall into death he brought you there that she would be a vessel that he can manifest his power his goodness in my I think of what Jude said beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful somebody say needful it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that she should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints so he was going to write them about the common salvation but the Spirit of the Lord moved upon him and said no write to them about the need to contend for the faith in this great faith battle he says I've tried to find it I've come some awful obstacles been over amen some rough roads it shows on me I have noticed this but it's been the most blessed thing this is the prophets words it's been the most blessed thing I wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world amen and here is my greatest victory here it's the greatest pleasure I have is when I come up against something and I can't see over it and I can't see around it or I can't see under it I just keep walking towards it believing that God will make a way when I get there can I get a witness here tonight that'll say I've been there I couldn't see my way over it I couldn't see my way around it and I couldn't see my way under but he still Jehovah Jireh and if he led me up on the mountain he's still able to provide me a sacrifice oh come on church you're not a bunch of children of Lucifer you're the sons and daughters of God who is a create who slept that old nothing and created everything my brother don't tell me that there's not a faith in the church there is a real faith in the church don't tell me that we need to become a bunch of cowards and just lay down and say well whatever the devil wants to do let him do I say no there is a power inside of you to back the devil in the corner and to put your foot on his neck and the rise in victory and power brother you say there's no faith in the church well there may not be the kind of faith you want but there is pay in the church you may want the faith of prosperity but that's not the faith God promised you you may want the faith for a bigger job or a bigger house we want some gospel to preach prosperity but he promised at the same faith of Jesus Christ would be in this hint I'm Brian and here we are tonight Church not full of a bunch of main philosophy and a bunch of vanities of man's hot this but I'm preaching to some warriors tonight I'm preaching to some people that hell hates I'm preaching to some people that the devil's got to her picture on his wall because he knows if he can ever destroy you then he'll have a great victory but I want to tell the devil tonight there is nothing in my past there is nothing in my presence there is nothing in my future that will ever separate me from the love of God my name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was one devil before there was one child before there was one Church trouble I had a cheap seat of representation only inside of my soul Satan you are a plus you offend me and the name of Jesus Christ take your hands off of God's property and let him rise in the faith of Jesus Christ there's a real faith in this church you see it's the strange thing that a prophet of God calls even an entire generation to contend for the faith of Jesus Christ seen that word contend means to fight for that Network contend means to actually stand and defend what you believe in now the Prophet said I do not believe in debating he said I do not believe in arguing he said but I do believe in contending he said I do believe in contending he said for that's what Jude told us to do he said contend for the faith of Jesus Christ isn't it something church that we got people who will contend for the things that hurt the church but they won't contend for the things that bless the church well I'm gonna preach I bet you get a preacher in the pulpit and he starts preaching on holiness brother they'll contend with you for two hours well I got a quote and I got a scripture and my momma said it was okay amen but let a preacher get in the pulpit and say this is a new age it's a manifestation of the son of man it's surprise hour it's rat stream faith and people sit back and fold their arms and say well I've heard it explained one time brother we don't need a bunch of contenders for the things of the devil we need somebody who will raise up in the faith of Jesus Christ and will contend forever divine promise brother I'm not talking about a promise that's gonna put you on top of the mountain I'm talking about a promise that's gonna take you beyond the Milky Way I'm talking about a promise it's gonna put you on the streets of gold I'm talking about a promise that's gonna change an 80 year old man into an 18 year old boy I'm talking about a reality Church I'm taking on two things tonight I'm thinking on the purpose of God and I'm thinking on the per the opposition of the devil the purpose of God and the opposition of the devil but do you realize the purpose of God will never be defeated isn't that beautiful that the opposition of the devil is never going to defeat the purpose of God he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now a word is a part expressed God had in his mind what to do but when he expressed it it come into existence it become reality see it was God's Word express to me you take me to record this morning friends that there isn't enough power in all of Hell there isn't enough power in all of Hell that can ever defeat the purpose of Almighty God God will do it anyhow rather if God said he's going to hear you there ain't enough Devils in hell that's gonna stop gone from healing it if God said he would give you the Holy Ghost there ain't enough Devils out of all of Hades that is going to stop the power of God amen from killing somebody where the Holy Ghost Jeremiah 51 29 says and the land shall tremble and shall sorrow Amen for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon to make the land of Babylon desolation without an inhabitant is it that beautiful God said when I get done with Babylon there isn't even going to be a place Amen for the devil to inhabit getting it beautiful when the Spirit Lord spoke to us Aruba bow and said old great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane Amen you realize what he was saying when I get done with your enemy there isn't even going to be a resemblance that there was ever even an enemy in front of you hey Church isn't that powerful word isn't that powerful promise to know that Jesus Christ is not going to be defeated by your enemy oh brother you ever seen a dog get a hold of at all you ever seen an old dog get a hold of a baby doll or something he'll swing that thing around you'll walk on that thing pull it up in the air and catch it when he gets them with it don't even look like a rag doll I come to tell you tonight when Jesus Christ gets done with the devil he ain't even gonna look like a devil because our God it's still a destroyer my god it's pillory school our God is still a healer no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper amen and every tongue that shall rise against the intents thou shall condemn isn't this beautiful this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord amen and the righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord vilandra what is he talking about I'll tell you what he's talking about and we know that by heart no weapon that is formed against thee shall be able to prosper everybody close that aim it but there's another part to that scripture and every tongue that rises against the in judgment thou shalt condemn brother ain't even got time to protect amen every tongue that rises in judgment against thee thou shalt condemn brother can you imagine when your case come before the Lord and the devil said I'm going to condemn them and the devil said I'm going to hold a man that listen friends the devil did his homework the devil made sure that when he walked in the courtroom that morning he meant that he was going to put you away the devil made sure when you got done with that cancer he was going to silence her praise the devil thought for sure when you got through that church trouble that she would never have another ABS 238 experience in the church the devil thought for sure and then when you come to that family situation that he would destroy your family but the devil forgot to read the prophecy I said the devil forgot to read the prophecy what did the prophecy say the prophecy said no weapon he never said the weapon wasn't formed he just said the weapon would prosper he never said the tongue wouldn't rise he just said I will condemn it come on Church and the devil tonight has been condemned by the blood of Jesus Christ you are not upon Slater sin no more you are born again son or daughter but there is an Lamb of God nothing is going to defeat God's eternal purpose vilandra how can you say that because God will never let his heritage be destroyed see for it's his purpose ain't meant to save us number them said why well he said this may be simple but it's us on my heart he said now why would he save us today to lose us tomorrow why would he give us the Holy Ghost amen to lose the Holy Ghost the next day say God is not the author of confusion now watch and he will never let our heritage be destroyed you see Bob and said your heritage is her family see that heritage is your inheritance he said he will never let's say it in other words he will never let your family be destroyed well Andrew you can't say that all but I can because I hear the Prophet say that there was a girl by the name of Rosanna Griffin he said Rosanna Griffin was in a terrible condition he said she was an alcoholic she had been to Alcoholics Anonymous she had been to all kinds of rehabs and nothing I mean nothing could help Rosanna like get over that opposition aim it but she realized only inside of her there was an overcomer laying there even why was she going out there because they overcome her only inside of her new you was born to be more than an alcoholic he was born to be more than a drug peddler he was born to be a daughter of God he was born to be a house on fire where the power of the Holy Ghost who never sinned Rosella Griffin it had been to all kinds of programs and none of them could help her he said then one day she come into my meeting and he said the angel of the Lord come down and he said there she was it's a beautiful testimony you can go here and God called me and he said and there she was in the very back he said this for the Lord begin the deal with her now watch he said while the Spirit of God was dealing with her he said the angel of the Lord picked up something on another girl sitting here on the front row what and he stopped and he said wait a second he said you young girl you've got Amen this in your life and you've got this and you ain't been living it Memorial and you've been packing drugs and all kinds of things omit now watch at the same time that the Spirit of the Lord is moving what's that old sprit of opposition raise up and the prophet of God said there was a man in the back stood up and said that's my daughter up there said sir your line said she's a good girl said your line and the daughter turned around and said that he's telling the truth that he's telling the truth he said now from that testimony Rosella got set free he said that young girl got set free and the opposition of that girl's daddy could not stop two girls from experienced in the transforming power of Jesus Christ rather when God gets ready to save you your mama can't stop him your daddy can't stop him your favorite preacher paint stopping when he gets ready to set you free there is no power inhale there is no power on the earth there is no power in heaven there is no power nowhere that can stop Jesus Christ from fulfilling the perfect will of God about the story cause he's away maker he said why Rose Heller was testifying he said she's been on fire for God for a long time he said she's been running around tests the father been witnessing the God he said no watch he said she's worried about her daddy he said Rosella wants her daddy saved now catch it brother branham is standing in the pulpit testifying about what God did for Rosella and that young girl and he says now Rosella really wants to see her daddy saved he said she really wants to see him on fire with God but he's got no habit he said now rose heaven don't worry just keep praying and while he's speaking he stops and says wait a minute somebody just passed me a note and he reads the note and he says pray for Rose and the Griffins father Rosella didn't know what was going on we and Brandon didn't know what was going on but the same angel of God that put a plane on the ground in Memphis and let Elijah to an insignificant colored woman's house is the same God that come down in that meeting that morning and a prophet of God said I just got a note that Rosanna Griffin's father has been in a terrible accident and right now he's laying under a pile of bricks he bowed his head and he said father in the name of jesus christ he may be laying under a pile of bricks but you can say this soul right now where he's at you brother I'm about to shout you can say this soul right now Riza brother Samuel and I heard that it was on a Sunday morning I was fixing to go to the pulpit breathe and I jumped out of my chair in my study and I said father if you can bring a sinner out from under a pile of rocks you can bring a more son and daughter of God out of the ever complex from under every sickness not from under every Church trouble he's the same yesterday he's the same today he'll be the same tomorrow church all the hydrogen bombs we'll never defeat this church the spirit of the enemy will never defeat this church because we know our enemy we know our adversary the Bible says in first Peter 5:8 be sober and be vigilant because your adversary but devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour you realize what our position means opposition means resistance opposition means a descent that becomes expressed in action or an argument or a group of adversaries or competitors it means a conflict now watch when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in the perfect word just like Jesus did the Word of God is perfect I hate to ask if you put a little bit more on these monitors not appreciated omit the Word of God is perfect you believe that now we're here to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist Satan whole elective God beware study close be careful work out your salvation thank you buddy work out your salvation with fear and trembling and rely upon God and be strong in his might for your adversary is the devil even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but watch watching the prayer and be steadfast for this is the endtime both for true and false vines are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those rappin tears must be bound for the burning now watch see they are joining the World Council of Churches that is the binding so the gathering of the wheat or the garnering of the weeds will come don't you see what the devil's do it that devil is right now bringing an entire group of Protestants to himself and binding them in a World Council of Churches you know what he's doing he thinks he's doing it to destroy you but actually what he's doing is he's making room he's making room for the bride to leave here Oh God he thinks he's actually accomplishing something he thinks he's setting you up he thinks he's putting pressure on you no sir as you've seen the hits don't come and what you've seen in a small measure when that third pull in a profit stood how can overcome any say I feel that third pull moving right now when that third pull and then comes into full effect the devil is gonna have to turn loose because when this bride is gone then judgment comes the tribulation Falls my god have mercy but right now but to spirit somebody say two spirits are at work right now in the framework of the saint church but start to overcome that you may be praise worthy for your Lord and fit to reign and rule with him now watch those two spirits are at work in the framework of the same church right now the same church in the same building here in the same preacher feeling the same opposition you say why do you say this well let's take it this way come to church on Sunday morning we're the same you'll get up preach man preach the house down blow the roof off I mean just preach his heart out somebody's sitting on the same pew to people the same view one other man he can't be trying I mean I mean he's bouncing around and raised in his hands and all glory to God come on preacher preach it forgot about what time it was I mean he's just having church you know and the old other guys sitting next to him and he's mad at a bullfrog eating buckshot I mean that he's he's wishing he'd hurry up maybe his iPad would crash that he would lose a few pages of notes cuz he's ready to go home see they walked out the same church hurt the same preacher brother twins aren't born in two separate households they come out of the same house under the same parents Amen but one of them's got a see table and the other one's got the sin nature of the serpent Cain brother this okay so man they come out then that guy comes out he's floating on the clouds man he's clapping his hands an old happy day and since Jesus watched all my sins away I ain't never felt so good in all my life and old guy comes out and says what are you so happy about he said man that word we just heard he said I was so happy I would when he got really close I thought he'd only been preaching five minutes the other guy said no it was two hours and 10 minutes and 12 seconds see propoganda oh come on Church a prophet of God identified you in a message he said you an Earthbound you're an Earthbound Buzzard come on he said you're an Earthbound Buzzard he said you've lost your identification you've lost three you as or instantly he said it's been a long time since you flew in the unknown Oh treat somebody it's been a long time since you flew in the unknown it's been a long time since you got drunk on the Holy Ghost it's been a long time since you sung and you didn't care what people thought about the note you is hitting it's been a long time since you shouted while the preacher was preaching it's been a long time since your dancing the Spirit of God oh you call me Pentecostal you call me a Holy Roller you call me what you want to but I'll tell you what William Branham called me he called me an eagle Pete called me an eagle brother you sit there and pick around for a dead rabbit if you want to but I see a son of man coming I see the appearing of the Lord I feel the pull from another dimension telling me just come up higher just come up higher come up into a place where you don't care about what people think about you rather I'm just gonna let loose and reach for a minute it was here for a second but when's the last time you got lost to the Holy Ghost when's the last time you forgot about who was leading singing when's the last time you just moved in the Holy Ghost over there during the word age you're exactly right probably gone so we got a church it can write the check but they ain't got no money the bank he said then we got a church full of money but they don't know how to write a check he said if you can ever get the two together if you can ever get the two together I said steady against a brother brother Samuel Herbert let me tell a story he said man the first time I ever preached he said I've been sitting there watching dr. Davis he said man I seen how that guy got up here and got to preaching he said he slung his arm like that he said then he shouted real loud like that he said the whole time I was making notes in my mind to what he did he said man I got up there he said I didn't say nothing but I slung marm he said then I I got up here and said whoa he said man I was doing it real good he said then I come down and sit down next to dr. Davis and he said that was the most rotten job I've ever seen he said man it liked to hurt me he said few days later dr. Davis said I want to see him office at 2 o'clock he said I walked in there brother Samuel he said dr. Davis looked at me and said you're offended aren't me at me aren't you he said to be honest with you I am he said cuz I watched Jenny said I knew how you said it he said I just knew if you idiot through that arm the right way something that now this is for all you people who don't like emotion okay he said I know if I just slung my arm the right way if I just raised my voice and just did it just right he said if I got all the motions down he said it'd be a good service he said Billy that was the worst job I've ever seen he said why do you say that doctor he said cuz I stood in court one day as a lawyer he said I stood there and an old guy got up there and he was trying to defend himself in a divorce case he said he got up there and he said oh she's a terrible eye boo-hoo-hoo he said she well she didn't do this boohoo he said he slept there and blue hood for about 30 minutes he said then all of a sudden somebody else stood up and he said judge are you going to listen to that he said listen dear son it's going to take more than your emotions it's gonna take some law to defeat this case oh I got a double-barrel shotgun right now for everybody that wants to call shouting in this message Pentecostalism for the first time we're not going through the motions with a bunch of empty bubble dancing and a bunch of carrying on but there's people right now in the house of God that are raising their hands and there ain't one instrument playing there shouted a man and there eat one singer singing what's happening Church we've come out from Pentecost we've come into a word anointing and the power they meant to write the check that's come back in the church again and freedom is an ass of God victory this in the house of God may I announce to you he is here and he's not here weak but he's here supremely he's here in power he's here reality this ain't about to empty emotion I'm I'm so sick and tired this nonsense can't worship God no more Oh God gonna preach I said in the meeting the other day man the power of God come down god I got the singing man got to shout and rejoicing got the dancing spirit I couldn't see him behind me but man there was people shouting the rejoicing it's powerful I felt like my body was going bust come out of the church you know what I thought man tear ban there love that I don't know one old guy raised up and said that what nothing but a bunch of rock and roll let me tell you something buddy excuses been around for years and it's an excuse not to worship God it's an excuse to sit there and be a dignified formal church member and worship God come on church amen if you want a bunch of excuses keep row excuses but I'm sorry I didn't come from the lineage Amen of a bunch of non worship and a bunch of dead church services brother I came from a lineage when they crossed the Red Sea Miriam picked up a tambourine and Secret in the shop and she begin to rejoice brother I came from the lineage where my brother David got so inspired when he seen the unseen word tell invisible before his eyes let me begin the worship then he begin to dance mom is you care about what somebody thinks about you this is off notes but I'm gonna preach you care about what somebody thinks about you but here's the difference in me and you okay I don't care no more I don't care no more brother if I shout they're gonna talk and if I don't shout they're gonna talk brother if you preach they're gonna talk and if you don't preach are gonna talk so you know what I'm sick and tired of satisfied a bunch of spiritual babies when the King of Kings and the Lord of lords is in this building and at the very fond of redemption yet he the patriarchs of the Old Testament in the worship brother I read a quote the neighbor of em said that there he thought of Easter called joka worship the very thought of an Easter coming cause joka worship he never laid his eyes on it but the very thought of it testing testing one two testing testing the very fond of it there he fall of his healing I'm on a paraphrase here I just just come to me probably God said you out there Walton healing he said the Bible said that they danced before the Lord he said now right now he said before you ever even get the healing just start dancing [Music] rather in this beautiful before you ever see the miracle manifest itself just start dancing Wilbur then run to you and I'm doing I'm waiting on opposition to go away and then I'm gonna cut a shine brother brother same we'll just as soon as I get out of this trouble I'm gonna back you like I've never backed you before if you won't back to over the word when you're going through the trouble then you won't back the word when you come out of the trouble but if you can raise up and say I'm a worshipper if I'm in trouble I'm a worshipper if I'm out of trouble I'm a praiser if my bills are paid I'm appraiser if I'm seeking in debt come on church this opposition don't control us we control this opposition [Applause] but it's God it's God you better be careful something might break out you're exactly right you're exactly right just just just the other day in the median while I was preaching no music going while the word was going forth brother the Spirit of God sent down to that building and there come a Liberty I mean people was helping me out dancing I was suddenly having to walk around them to keep on preaching there was there was one boy brother his brother same it was one man and his wife and his little kids it I just kept filling pool there something kept pulling me there every time I'd go back to pulpit it would put me right back there finally there's Bri the Lord spoke to him and said brother you are the church you are the church you're not going to be destroyed you are the church and I went to telling people you're the church you're the church you're the church and when I got to him I said brother you're the church that's all I said brother Samuel I mean it was like a lightning bolt hit that boy he took off running around the church he went took off running around the church I mean making laps they told me afterwards they said well then do you turn around but you didn't see it he said that guy ran out in the parking lot and was running around shouting in the power of the Holy Ghost in a message church brother now you really want to make me shout he said by the Ender he's been in this church since in the since the early nineties he said he's never made a move like that he said he's never made a move I got he said and furthermore we never thought he would he said because just a few months ago there was some unclean living took place in the marriage he said and his wife is has been bound by an oppression he said but the Holy Ghost spoke to him the night and he said for the first time he said we thought that would take him out he said but it didn't take him out he just put him in brother you think the opposition's going to take us out no sir it's just going to put us into action you say how can you say this because the glory of the Lord shall be revealed see God is going to reveal his glory and God is going to get the praise look at somebody and say God it's going to reveal his glory God it's going to reveal his glory and God is going to get the praise God it's going to reveal his glory and God it's gonna get the Prince I said God it's gonna reveal his glory and God is gonna get the place well I'm talking about the Shekinah glory I'm talking about the glory amen if you just get in the presence of this boy it'll bring forth life in the Easter she'll the problem of God said that Shekinah glory it was sealed off they said they couldn't go in there he said but on Easter morning it broke the seal [Music] on Easter morning the seal between the Shekinah glory and the inner court was broken he said now brother I love I says this he said now brother I'm paraphrasing here I'm just slinging the sword now child this forgive me Timothy Pruitt was preacher than a decent man ISA I got so tired of every time you close the quote somebody said what year did brother Branham close that Timothy said I finally told him the year he was a prophet works pretty good for me see that's what's happening a bunch of it tree used to be when the preacher preached you just started shouting but now we got to figure out what page and paragraph and color at I had on when he said it said that that Holies of Holies was sealed off he said that's where the Shekinah glory come he's sipping on Easter morning he said that seal was broke and he said man went in there he said now let me tell you how powerful it was in there he said a priest went in there one time and said he got so shook up brother he got so shook up then he dropped the rod in his hand and ran out of there he said when he come back to get it that presence was so powerful I'm trying to behave myself that presence was so powerful that he came back and a dead rod was budding forth buds come on church I caught something there this is okay if a dead rod that was never ordained to bring forth life can get in the presence of the Shekinah glory and can lay there until it brings forth life then what about a redeemed son or daughter of God that ever gets in the presence of the Shekinah glory you as my lord aid amen to be a tinkling cymbal and a sounding brass but she was ordained they meant to be a reproduction of the genes seat of Almighty God brother I'll tell you what we need to do we need to open up the doors and let the King come in who is this key this is a king of glory somebody just Lenny man we don't need to get our prayer young people in the presence of dr. Dobson get him in the presence of the Shekinah glory Rosella griffin laid in those clinics and didn't get no help but in the presence of the Shekinah glory it took an alcoholic and made a witness out of her brother same I'm not a crazy man I'm a believer if the glory of the Lord ever comes in the church it will change everything the glory the Lord come in and something that was not even ordained to bring forth brought forth brother I'm gonna close here I'm just gonna say this you was ordained to overcome now I hope it's okay to take a little liberty here I know there's been a lot of confusion well is there about ages there not is there a broad anointing is there not but let me tell you what the devil wants us to do the devil wants us to sit here and he wants us to rock us to sleep and tell us brother opposition is coming and when opposition comes it's going to perfect a bride brother there's something greater coming when it comes it's gonna perfect about brother persecution is coming I really say well you've heard it preached hope it's okay oh and the pressure comes down from the White House oh that Brides gonna have Church then if it takes the Trump in the White House to cause us to have Church we got a problem oh and Russia does this when opposition comes with a bride we'll go through her perfection and she'll get persecuted and she'll get perfected and she'll come out and go in the rapture brother the proto God said if the Dark Ages did not persecute a church enough to perfect her there's nothing else coming of any greater any greater pressure to bring perfection and he stopped and said how can overcome he says know your sin but then you're gonna run out of times here he said no I'm not he said the bride is not going through tribulation she's going in the rapture but at random how can you say that he said because the blood somebody shout the blood he said because the blood has got enough power to perfect the church brother the blood of Jesus has got enough power to perfect the church so can I tell you tonight church your opposition is not coming he reveals your opposition in the Feast of Trumpets 64 he said the lid came off a hell and two hundred thousand thousand demons was loosed out of the river of Euphrates against the bride he said now there's a two-fold purpose here he said some was released to the Jews he said but watch there was two hundred thousand thousand ecclesiastical spirits that was released against the bride of Jesus Christ he said but at the same time oh I'm coming to a close but at the same time when the releasing of our opposition is coming the releasing of our overcoming power is covered [Applause] what is it says it's the holy ghost that's been bound by these denominational rivers for some 2,000 years but in the evening time under the evening time messenger the holy ghost that's been bound it's gonna start flowing again rather somebody just raise your hands and say flow through me flow through me oh it goes flow through my family flew through my church flew through my pastor flows through my husband flows through my wife flows through my church let the Holy Ghost of God just pull through this building tonight until the overcomer only inside of you is released rather that Holy Ghost is released to give you overcoming power you're gonna overcome this opposition and God is going to get the glory so can I tell you tonight it's okay your opposition is not coming your opposition is a year what opposition's following that dwell for the bride after this comes the body change Abraham and Sarah received the message right after they received the message then came the body change to bring forth the promise I'd tell the devil tonight we are more than conquers there are more than church members there more than just message believers we are more than just profit followers we're more than just husbands you are more than just wives your overcomers brilliant pressures coming but but but this may sound strange but I love pressure because you know what pressure does man I gotta quit it just keeps coming back pressure produces the real you pressure only produces what's laying there you say pretender how can you say that okay there's two boys in the book of Genesis chapter 4 Cain table the Bible says God came down at the time of worship Cain brought his sacrifice Abel brought his sacrifice and they laid him on the altar they laid him on the altar both boys worshiped both boys built altars both boys sent their prayers but God had respect towards Abel's offering but he did not have respect towards Cain's I'm holding I'm sorry it's an it's in the true Easter seal the proto God said see he said where is this Easter seal coming from he said I was down the other day and they were selling these stamps it was started in 1919 you go look it up it was a 501c3 nonprofit organization it was an Easter seal it was a stamp and the pride of God said what they did was they took up money and I identify something there he said they took up money he said to go put this Easter stamp on a or this Easter seal on a card he said to send to somebody who was laying in hospice he Center had tuberculosis or was getting ready to die he said no watch they were putting an Easter steals ant stamp up on them to put them in the grave but the true Easter seal come to put a stamp up on you to bring you out of the grave so that opens the door to show you that the force inside of you is greater than the opposition that surrounds you you see Cain brought his offering and the problem that God said while Cain was putting his pumpkins and his melons and his flowers up on the altar he said Abel was over there with a knife cutting the neck of a lamb and Cain was looking over at him and calling him a Holy Roller opposition was around him but election was laying on the inside of him the opposition of his own brother of his own half-brother could not stop him from worshiping are y'all hearing me don't worry I'm not gonna catch a second wind the opposition around him could not stop him from worship but Cain laughed at him but it didn't stop him came call me my Holy Roller but it didn't stop him and the prophet of God said when God rejected Cain's sacrifice he said Cain got jealous he said there was a spirit of greed he said that spirit has come in in Nashville affairs come in and political affairs come right down to the church affairs he said that spirit of greed raised up that spirit of greed raised up and killed his brother but now watch when God rejected Cain's sacrifice and so I don't have respect towards it when God rejected it God did not place greed in him greed was already in the pressure of not the exact rifice not being accepted moved upon what was laying there and closed it to manifest itself my god brother if the Spirit of the Lord can reject the sacrifice and that pressure be so great on that flesh body that pain would raise up and say I hate you and kill his own brother and the prophet of God said it was a key move he said what is it Cain move when the pressure come he moved out of the presence of God but look at the spiritual side when the pressure come to Abel and said what is your sacrifice and he said it's a bloody lamb it moved Abel into the presence of God and Abel didn't display a spirit of greed because there wasn't a spirit of great lay in there he displayed a face because there was a faithfully in there and I ask you tonight Church what are you going to display what are you going to display when somebody don't shake your hand at church what are you going to display when somebody slides you in the parking lot what are you going to display brother if you're a son of Cain if you're a son of the devil that spirit that was always there is going to raise up whole but if you're a table you'll just stand up on your feet you'll just raise up your hands and say I'm going on with my Jesus just the same they may falsely accuse me you know that song they may scandalize my name come on musicians but I'm going on with Jesus just the same don't you love them tonight why are you here tonight Church are you here tonight sister brother buddy here brother why are you here tonight right here not brother there's a lot of places you could be tonight I like it worship on the Lord and fee don't worry there's a lot of places you can be ignited it's the AIDS of pressure and pressure has to produce manifestation they rose up said well we can't find word with 16 men fell to their death off of a bridge we can't find that we can't find how that a prophet went out there in the mountain and seven angels come over him informed the cloud we think that was a we think that was a jet sir pressure started coming in now don't get mad at me but pressure started coming in and okay said a lot there you want I can't prove it and it just think too pretty to get up quote brother Brandon but he was a false prophet pressure came in and they started manifesting who they were and people's lost families people's lost loved ones people's lost best friends but you stood toe-to-toe with the same pressure why are you here tonight because there was an overcomer laying in there and the pressure only begin to manifest what was only inside of you how many can say tonight Lord I'm going on with you just the same Flandre it's it's it's too hard the pressure is too hard well it's what Cain said and came back to us it will it better take a different approach a dish you know we better today what this blood all over the altar you better take a different approach but Abel being spiritually minded bi-election said it's in my heart and I take it to not Church it's in my heart brother is it in your heart tonight is it in your heart to believe this message is it in your heart to believe this message brother I'll tell you if it ever gets in your heart you don't matter what anybody else does it's there to stay you're loving tonight won't we rest ourselves to our feet did I do well Andrew why do you say they're so strong well the same I was listening to the message Easter seal in 1965 the other day brother brand was preaching and he says says I don't know he says this may be the last Easter message I ever preached he said but let me say it quickening power is in this word quickening power is in this word but 20 minutes later he stopped again he said church I'm 56 years old he said I'm at the heart attack age he said I'm at the age of anything I could go at any time he said I'm there I'm at that time he said but let it be said clicking him power he's in this word right before he comes in that sermon brother right at the end he stops and he screams out that's why I don't care if they slam every door in my face he said that's why I don't care if they closed every pulpit off to me he said I'm gonna stand and declare this is the Holy Ghost gospel brother something raised up on the inside of me the pressure of doors slamming in the prophets face cannot stop him from overcoming opposition you know why because he might have been a small man with a little voice but he had a great big message and you may say by the end you were just a small Church with just a few people but you got a great big message you got a great big message what are you gonna do with it I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna believe it I'm gonna worship it I'm gonna serve it what about it Church we've been ordained to overcome this opposition do you love the Lord this evening how many can say I'm more than a conqueror I'm a
