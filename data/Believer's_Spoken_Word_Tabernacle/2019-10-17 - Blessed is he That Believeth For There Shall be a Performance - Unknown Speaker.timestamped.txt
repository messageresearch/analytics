[28:54] sister hope that passed on they had lost
[28:58] her little daughter and brother brown

[29:02] man pulled up to him and said Billy are
[29:05] you holding on to your religion he said
[29:08] no he said it's hold on to me you know
[29:12] if the reality is tests and trials and
[29:16] things that come our way
[29:17] you know God we know that all of it is
[29:21] an instrument that God uses to mold and
[29:24] shape our character and I'm grateful to
[29:27] God for His mercy I know you are tonight
[29:29] as well to realize that there's
[29:32] something greater on the inside of us
[29:34] that's holding us that's the real peace
[29:38] that's the real hope that's the real
[29:39] patience we have as the saints of God
[29:42] because through it all we know that the
[29:45] life that is within us that same life is
[29:49] undefeatable that life has never been
[29:52] defeated it's never lost one battle Amen
[29:56] hail could not contain it the grave
[29:59] could not hold it and the earth
[30:01] gravitation could not hold it here
[30:04] it was always subject to the world and
[30:07] that same life living inside of your eye
[30:10] I'm gray I'm glad that the reality is
[30:12] greater is He that is in me than he
[30:16] that's in the world aren't you glad

[35:51] faithful so we are just here to
[35:54] encourage our search because that's what
[35:57] the Bible said we should keep doing
[35:59] let's stand and read from the Gospels
[36:03] and look chapter one
[36:09] Luke chapter 1 look chapter work let's
[36:19] start from verse 39
[36:28] shall we hear the word of the Lord he
[36:30] and Mary arose in those days and went
[36:36] into the hill country with haste into a
[36:41] city of Judah and entered into the house
[36:47] of zekkariyas and saluted Elizabeth and
[36:53] it came to pass that when Elizabeth had
[36:57] the salutation of Mary the babe lived in
[37:02] their womb and Elizabeth was filled with
[37:07] the Holy Ghost and she spec out with a
[37:12] loud voice and said blessed are thou
[37:18] among women and blessed is the fruit of
[37:22] thy womb and when is this to me that the
[37:29] mother of my lord should come to me for
[37:33] lo as soon as the voice of that
[37:37] salutation sounded in my mind my ears
[37:41] the babe lived in my womb for joy and
[37:46] blessed is she that believe for there
[37:51] shall be a performance of those things
[37:54] which were told from the Lord amen
[38:01] shall we please be seated
[38:10] and the Gospel of st. John chapter 4
[38:15] verse 48 then said Jesus unto him as
[38:21] said easy signs and wonders he will not
[38:28] believe the nobleman said unto him say
[38:32] come down my child died jesus said unto
[38:38] him go thy way thy son liveth and the
[38:43] man believed the word that Jesus had
[38:46] spoken unto him and he went his way and
[38:50] as it was now going down is his seventh
[38:54] matching and so they say the son liveth
[38:59] then inquire he of them the hour when he
[39:03] began to amend and they said unto him
[39:07] yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
[39:11] left him so the father knew that it was
[39:16] at the same hour in the which Jesus said
[39:21] unto Him thy son liveth and he and his
[39:27] self believed and his whole house amen
[39:32] praise the Lord
[39:34] so once again we are grateful to the
[39:37] Lord for the opportunity as given to us
[39:40] to assemble together amen and he
[39:42] promised a watch worth three were
[39:44] gathered in his name will be dead so
[39:46] without any shadow that we know that the
[39:49] Lord is here and he comes in to minister
[39:53] unto his children and I just want us to
[39:57] encourage ourselves from the scripture
[39:59] that we have read blessed is he that
[40:02] believeth
[40:05] for there shall be a performance of
[40:09] those things which were taught a from
[40:14] the Lord there shall be a performance
[40:19] when God speaks there will be a
[40:23] performance there shall be a performance
[40:29] blessed is she that believeth for there
[40:34] shall be a performance the promise said
[40:40] when God gives a promise to you you
[40:45] don't have to be afraid whether it will
[40:50] come to pass or not he said you don't
[40:52] have to be afraid because God we always
[40:58] fulfill his word to the letter
[41:06] he said when God speaks hallelujah
[41:11] may God help us is that when the law
[41:14] speaks and we are afraid is that it is
[41:19] an insult to God a man was under the
[41:29] blood when a marriage was under the
[41:32] blood and feels afraid that God won't
[41:36] keep his word it is an insult to him
[41:45] when a man is afraid that God would keep
[41:51] his word
[41:51] it is an insult to God it is such our
[41:56] maker if he holds the whole world and
[42:02] the whole universe in his hands
[42:05] what are you afraid of afraid of what
[42:14] when we have so many examples what are
[42:20] we afraid of but no matter are
[42:24] ridiculous
[42:25] it looks like God we fulfill his weight
[42:30] and turn us in the scriptures in the
[42:33] beginning when God said let there be
[42:35] light you should remember the Bible
[42:38] tests are the earth was without form and
[42:40] void it was total darkness
[42:45] it was confusion it was a bad ship and
[42:51] God spoke the word and the power of the
[42:55] spoken word transformed that chaotic
[42:59] condition and made it a Garden of Eden
[43:02] [Music]
[43:05] the darkness fled hallelujah by the
[43:11] spoken word is when God sees God
[43:16] believes is wait sure but don't worry
[43:21] what does he worry no matter the
[43:26] situation happens look like no it
[43:31] doesn't matter to God because it is God
[43:36] and he believes his word and so we have
[43:44] been touched God send in a prophet God
[43:47] send a message and every age and every
[43:50] time is to bring us to that point to
[43:52] believe God not to resist with God not
[43:57] to question God it is not our problem
[44:01] God is going to do it because that is
[44:06] not your business if you promise me then
[44:10] it is your business to see to it that
[44:13] you keep the promise if you said you are
[44:17] going to give me something and or
[44:19] somebody and then what it is up to you
[44:23] to find a way to satisfy to construct to
[44:30] do what your promise it is not my
[44:33] business it's your business so when God
[44:36] gives the promise it is God's business
[44:39] it is not your business it's not my
[44:42] business because God is faithful
[44:49] therefore there shall be a performance
[44:55] remember the scripture told us in the
[44:57] book of Habakkuk is it the vision is for
[45:01] an appointed time he said even establish
[45:05] wait for it because it will speak at the
[45:09] end it will not say he may look like
[45:14] he's failing but it will fail because
[45:16] God is never in hurry we get in hurry
[45:21] and that make us to worry but God is
[45:24] never in hurry and God believes whatever
[45:27] he says and that is rocky does he worry
[45:32] [Applause]
[45:34] and remember that when his face is just
[45:39] behind it when he said let there be
[45:44] light is that if Matt I've taken
[45:46] thousands of years millions of years but
[45:50] that was not his problem him you know me
[45:53] light he never worried about that in in
[45:58] in the beginning the book of Genesis we
[46:00] have got a letter B letter B he does fix
[46:04] once
[46:08] leatherby like leather like car leather
[46:11] what that gather together let this be at
[46:14] the finish his and it does continue
[46:19] agree and I believe what is ice has
[46:28] children of God we are being expected to
[46:32] come to this watch to believe what our
[46:35] fantasies to take him at his word and to
[46:42] step right there and all the edges
[46:45] running I've been trying to do is to
[46:48] bring it to that point of realization
[46:53] believe what I said and like I said to
[46:57] be other people sooner I said stand up
[47:00] my train come on
[47:01] god bless you what's your name no that's
[47:05] not your name that's not your name

[47:17] you could end this thing or that I want
[47:20] you to notice that when he was giving
[47:23] the name James and whatever name he
[47:28] didn't know about it when you give birth
[47:32] to a child and the baby is named that's
[47:36] the baby new but when the baby name is
[47:41] given what do we do we call it James
[47:45] bliss James when it does it will respond

[48:35] what is this sending messages to resist
[48:37] to call this is me that's what we're
[49:12] here for that's what we came to check
[49:14] that's why the word is preached to us
[49:16] because why the works were finished
[49:19] before the foundation of the wife you
[49:23] know when you give another what was
[49:26] finish before you came here the work was
[49:28] finished God has finished his work
[49:30] already
[49:31] he's trying to bring us into it to see
[49:34] this there is nothing you do to eat here
[49:40] so let us finish it and we just accept
[49:43] it
[49:49] our salvation was finished before the
[49:52] foundation of our healing before the
[49:56] foundation of the way all that we need
[49:59] yes provide that before you ever before
[50:04] there was in the creation the laughs was
[50:07] led in the mind of God before the
[50:10] foundation of the world and in fact it
[50:12] is finished it is finished it is
[50:16] finished your healing is finished the
[50:19] passage of elegance is finished
[50:20] salvation is finished the work of
[50:23] redemption is finished these that it is
[50:25] finished and we just read it up he said
[50:28] it is finished he said it is finished
[50:30] they keep looking at it

[51:02] he's the provider and the a forever
[51:05] provided it is just a matter of time for
[51:10] the manifestation of it and the man
[51:16] believes and said blessed is he that
[51:19] believeth for this'll be a performance
[51:22] of the face that a lot of smoking
[51:25] because this is already sector with the
[51:28] Lord brother Branham says even if Jesus
[51:37] Christ our Lord you cou country shall

[51:42] already done it and that we are trying
[51:52] to do point it look at the sister look
[51:55] at the brother he doesn't because there
[51:58] is something about what you look like

[52:05] joke a joke Jacob when he was saying
[52:08] with liver and his father-in-law and he
[52:11] wanted to answer he fits them in a
[52:14] way and they put some sticks before them
[52:17] the colour that he wants to the word he
[52:21] wonders if the colour of the ship what

[52:56] belief and we shall be a performance
[53:09] hallelujah Ragosa let that be
[53:13] he didn't doubt it he believed it he
[53:18] took along he might have taken millions
[53:20] of it that I didn't worry about it that
[53:23] is what he knew they will be obliged to
[53:25] be because it was finished before the
[53:29] foundation other so God is not in hurry
[53:33] he's waited for the manifestation of
[53:36] this word and he knows it will be made
[53:39] manifest hability and if we are sons and
[53:43] daughters of God we have been raised up
[53:46] we have been encouraged to look up to
[53:49] him to order to what he says and it will
[53:54] be made manifest no matter what
[53:58] they said there are not enough powers
[54:02] back of stroke that can stop me that'll

[54:26] he has a purpose he has a reason
[54:33] remember is never in hurry
[54:36] it s s prayer in his own way and of a
[54:40] goddess the prophet of God said even
[54:44] when God said no is an answer to prayer
[54:49] [Music]
[54:50] listen when God says no is that the note
[54:54] of God is as good as his yeses therefore
[55:01] we should be rejoicing in the nurses and

[1:03:07] problem and you don't expect God to baby
[1:03:11] us all the time if we have been taught
[1:03:19] in this creatures whom he loveth he
[1:03:23] chasteneth we have been taught the
[1:03:28] messenger told us if you are longer to

[1:04:29] the devil knew that there was the edge
[1:04:31] of a Jew

[1:26:18] right
[1:26:18] it was all right but it was not where
[1:26:21] God wanted him to be so then we come to
[1:26:25] a place we accomplished and I'll be fi
[1:26:27] but that's not where God want us to be
[1:26:30] so God has to create a situation should
[1:26:35] I just I will return - Brizzy see but
[1:26:40] what God asks for him what God wanted
[1:26:44] him to be it was not there yet so God
[1:26:48] had a situation the heaven-sent was
[1:26:51] against yourself and see if our
[1:26:54] government was against him they had his
[1:26:56] government as a witness
[1:27:01] that yes you try it too you wanted to
[1:27:04] rip me you wanted to live with me and I

[1:27:37] what is all this and go said that is
[1:27:40] that is it how will you understand
[1:27:44] explain it but God was in it all and so
[1:27:50] there are many things that happen around
[1:27:52] us remember is the special the righteous
[1:27:55] our object of the Lord he knows all
[1:27:59] about it
[1:28:00] he knows all about it
[1:28:02] he has not forgotten you know and then
[1:28:07] determine - Brizzy my god knew what it
