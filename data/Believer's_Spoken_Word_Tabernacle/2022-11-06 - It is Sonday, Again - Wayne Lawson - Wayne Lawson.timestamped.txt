[33:22] brother Wayne is is not a stranger to us
[33:25] God has used his ministry around the
[33:28] world to bless the bride and you know
[33:30] what makes it such a blessing is
[33:32] is when a man is surrendered to God and
[33:34] can step out of the way
[33:36] because the ministry is not about the
[33:38] man and the people it's about God
[33:40] speaking to us

[37:33] and when you step into the unveiled
[37:35] presence of God the Bible said it will
[37:38] change you from Glory unto glory and the

[37:58] have church amen to come and enjoy his
[38:01] presence and and his Liberty we want to
[38:05] bring you all greetings from our pastor
[38:06] brother Erickson and the church there
[38:08] true word Tabernacle and all the saints
[38:11] and Amen brother Samuel Browning is a is
[38:14] a superstar down there in that church
[38:17] everyone loves him so much and he has
[38:20] such a testimony among them as I know he
[38:22] does you and I'm bringing you greetings
[38:25] brother Samuel from everybody down there
[38:27] God bless you and uh we certainly want
[38:30] to say that it is an honor and amen to
[38:33] have our family here this morning and
[38:34] get to be here with everyone and I want
[38:37] to take a few minutes this morning in
[38:39] the scripture we've been on a little bit
[38:41] of series at home that want to preach
[38:43] the whole series this morning so but I
[38:45] do want to maybe speak a little
[38:46] something from it something it's been a
[38:48] blessing to our heart I've been studying
[38:51] uh out of the message of the rising of
[38:54] the Sun
[38:55] and something has really struck my heart
[38:57] the way the prophet would teach is he he
[39:00] brings it and he says it's Sunday again
[39:03] and this morning we think of Sunday as a
[39:06] Roman word
[39:07] s-u-n-d-a-y and we it's the first day of
[39:10] the week but in the Bible times there
[39:13] was no such a word as s-u-n-d-a-y it was
[39:16] just the first day of the week but
[39:18] brother Branham says see that I think it
[39:22] was in about 300 A.D that they gave the
[39:25] name Constantine gave the name to Sunday
[39:27] it was a Roman word he said but see in
[39:31] the this age of this time he said Christ
[39:34] has made it Sunday s-o-n-d-a-y
[39:39] that when the son of man has risen Among
[39:42] Us and he's made it the first day of the
[39:45] week again
[39:46] so we want to go to mark 16. and we want
[39:49] to identify a couple of scriptures here
[39:51] Mark 16 and verse 2. uh I think it's a
[39:55] beautiful reading here
[39:57] March 16.
[40:00] verse 2.
[40:05] we'll be reading Romans 8 and 11 also so
[40:09] let's read Mark 16 and verse 2.
[40:13] and very early in the morning
[40:16] the first day of the week see there it
[40:19] is it would in modern times it would
[40:21] read very early in the morning on Sunday
[40:24] but in Bible times it was called the
[40:26] first day of the week they came unto the
[40:29] Sepulcher at the rising of the sun now
[40:32] that's where brother Brandon would
[40:33] gather his title for the message Rising
[40:35] the Sun 1965.
[40:37] but let's go to Romans the eighth
[40:39] chapter in the 11th verse
[40:42] is what brother branham's going to do is
[40:43] he's going to transfer
[40:46] what the resurrection was in the Bible
[40:48] times
[40:50] and he's going to show you that we're
[40:51] living in that same day again
[40:54] in Romans the 8th chapter in the 11th
[40:56] verse
[40:58] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[41:00] Jesus from the dead
[41:02] dwelling you he that raised up Christ
[41:05] from the dead shall also Quicken
[41:09] thank you your mortal bodies by his
[41:12] spirit
[41:13] that dwelleth in you
[41:16] it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[41:19] by his Spirit the dwelleth in you now we
[41:21] can also go to Luke 17 and verse 30.
[41:26] Luke 17 and verse 30. so you got Mark 16
[41:29] and 2.
[41:30] and now we're going to have Luke 17 and
[41:32] 30. but Romans 8 and 11 is the scripture
[41:36] that transfers the resurrection in the
[41:39] days of Jesus
[41:40] to the resurrection that we're living
[41:42] now
[41:43] even thus shall it be in the day when
[41:46] the son of man is revealed
[41:49] even though shall it be in the day so
[41:51] brother Graham calls it the Sunday when
[41:54] the son of man is revealed let's bow our
[41:56] hearts Heavenly Father we thank you this
[41:58] morning for your grace
[42:00] we thank you for your mercy on this
[42:02] Sunday Lord we thank you for the
[42:04] benefits of the sun shining and the
[42:07] health that we feel the life and the
[42:09] worship that's here in the atmosphere
[42:11] Lord of this assembly now Lord Jesus
[42:14] when they went to the tomb they found
[42:17] you and wasn't there any longer but you
[42:20] had Risen Lord and you made yourself
[42:22] known among them now Lord Jesus we have
[42:25] returned to that day Lord when you're no
[42:28] longer in the Tomb but Lord you have
[42:31] risen and you made a promise that you
[42:33] would meet with us and that you would
[42:34] prove your Resurrection now Lord Jesus
[42:37] we thank you for your presence this
[42:39] morning we make you welcome Among Us and
[42:42] Lord we're asking you that you would do
[42:44] the supernatural you would do the
[42:46] amazing Among Us this morning Lord we'll
[42:48] give you all the honor and the glory and
[42:51] the praise we ask it in the name of
[42:53] Jesus Christ amen and amen and may God
[42:57] bless you this morning amen it's Sunday
[43:00] again it's Sunday again amen amen now
[43:05] it's Sunday again speaking of it's the
[43:09] day when the son of man is revealed you
[43:11] know the Bible predicted this day would
[43:13] come Jesus's own words he said as it was
[43:17] in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[43:19] the coming of the son of man when the
[43:21] son of man would be revealed so it was
[43:23] predicted in the Bible that this day
[43:25] would come but we are not predicting the
[43:29] coming of that day we're living in that
[43:31] day we're not just talking about a day
[43:34] that is coming we are living in the very
[43:37] day that the Bible spoke of and what
[43:40] would happen now if we're in the Sunday
[43:42] there is tremendous blessings of living
[43:44] in that day there are tremendous
[43:46] benefits of living in the day when the
[43:49] sun is revealed amen and and now the
[43:51] prophet in the message of the rising of
[43:53] the son here in paragraph 81 he he goes
[43:56] into a certain area and he says I'd like
[43:58] to read a scripture for you and I'd like
[44:00] to turn to another scripture so he read
[44:02] those scriptures I read then he reads
[44:04] the scripture I'd like to read you
[44:06] another scripture I'd like you to turn
[44:08] here and maybe it will help you in
[44:10] Leviticus the 23rd chapter in the 9th to
[44:13] the 11th verse now listen close in
[44:15] levitical law God was speaking to Moses
[44:18] and he was saying these things are types
[44:20] and how we'll stop here for a moment to
[44:22] get into a tide and the Lord spoke unto
[44:25] Moses saying Speak unto the children of
[44:28] Israel and you say unto them when you
[44:32] come into the land which I give you unto
[44:36] the place or the position that I have
[44:38] given to you now you speak to the
[44:40] children of Israel that you when you get
[44:42] to this certain place I promised I'd
[44:44] take you when you get in there in that
[44:46] land speaking natural here typing the
[44:49] spiritual you shall reap the Harvest
[44:52] thereof you received what I told you now
[44:56] what he's saying is is Moses has spoke
[44:58] to the children of Israel and said
[45:00] you're going to go into a certain land
[45:01] and when you get into that land you'll
[45:03] reap the Harvest thereof so brother
[45:06] Bantam says now that's taking a natural
[45:08] saying he said but I'm going to give it
[45:10] to you in a spiritual type that when you
[45:13] get to the place that I told you of that
[45:15] you can reap the Harvest thereof in
[45:18] other words you can have the things that
[45:20] have been spoken concerning that place
[45:22] you will receive the Harvest of the
[45:26] place and the time that you're living
[45:27] and and when he says that of course he
[45:29] says Moses is speaking naturally I'm
[45:33] speaking spiritually so there's a
[45:34] harvest in the season we're living if
[45:37] it's Sunday there's a harvest in the
[45:40] season of Sunday There's Something That
[45:43] We're to receive now what are we
[45:44] harvesting we're harvesting the things
[45:47] that have been spoken concerning the age
[45:50] and the time that we're living in and it
[45:52] belongs to you because it's been
[45:55] promised to you it's not something for
[45:57] another day or another season it's for
[46:00] the day that you're living in now now
[46:02] the prophet will say this to you in
[46:03] adoption series 1960. he said now a man
[46:06] outside of Canaan knows nothing about
[46:08] this he's still wondering he's he's not
[46:11] saying that he's not a good man I don't
[46:13] say that I don't say that the men in
[46:15] Egypt's not a good man but until he's
[46:17] come over into this possession and The
[46:19] Possession see the promise that was
[46:22] given to the church is not a natural
[46:24] land it is a spiritual land it is a
[46:27] spiritual land a spiritual priesthood
[46:29] scene it's a Promised Land but to you
[46:33] and I it's not a natural land it's a
[46:35] spiritual land that's why when Abraham
[46:38] went over into the promises the Bible
[46:41] always speaks of Israel uh the land they
[46:44] call it the promised land now the reason
[46:46] it's called the promised land it's
[46:48] because it's the land God promised to
[46:49] them it's a promised land and so did
[46:53] Paul in the book of Ephesians remember
[46:54] in the first chapter he said after that
[46:57] you've heard the word of Truth you are
[46:59] sealed by the spirit of promise
[47:02] see the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[47:05] Promise it's the promised spirit of God
[47:07] or the promised lamb that God made a
[47:10] promise according that he would give it
[47:12] to us so the same as Abraham went into
[47:15] the natural land so has it been that God
[47:18] would bring the church in a spiritual
[47:20] land and it would be a promised land now
[47:23] of course amen that lamb was made a
[47:25] promise to Abraham then again it was
[47:27] made a promise to Isaac and then again
[47:30] it was made a promise to Moses it never
[47:32] changed but it kept moving up and God
[47:35] kept promising the church amen and even
[47:38] till it come to the time in the Book of
[47:40] Joshua in the sixth chapter that God
[47:43] actually showed Joshua a vision I have
[47:46] given you this land
[47:49] now when that land amen was given to
[47:52] them remember amen that the lamb was
[47:54] given to them but nobody ever actually
[47:57] possessed that land until the Book of
[47:59] Joshua now what that means to you and I
[48:02] is that the book of Ephesians was
[48:04] written in Paul's day but nobody
[48:07] actually possessed what Paul was talking
[48:10] about until this day when he said you're
[48:13] predestinated under the spirit of
[48:14] adoption how many realizes adoption is
[48:17] an end time event amen the fullness of
[48:20] adoption is the change of the body it's
[48:22] the first Thessalonians 4 and First
[48:24] Corinthians 15 if the adoption is a
[48:27] promise to the end time as it is said we
[48:30] are seated in Heavenly places but they
[48:32] was not seated in that position in the
[48:34] days of Paul for the Bible tells us it's
[48:37] an end time promise how many knows
[48:39] brother random said that when Jesus was
[48:41] talking to the sons of thunder their
[48:43] mother come and said let my son set at
[48:45] thy right in the left hand and he said
[48:47] Jesus said it's not mine to give to them
[48:50] but it's been prepared for another
[48:51] people brother man said those people
[48:53] were the Overcomers of the laodicey and
[48:56] age that they would overcome that age
[48:59] and God would give them so Paul saw them
[49:01] in position but they never got the
[49:03] position until God gave the end time
[49:06] message to position the church in the
[49:09] last days he said preacher I don't know
[49:11] well what about what about the devil's
[49:13] position back there in the scripture
[49:15] Satan in second Thessalonians Paul said
[49:18] I see him as God calling himself sitting
[49:21] in the temple of God above all that is
[49:23] called God Amen and Paul Saul brother
[49:26] man said watch this he said in Isaiah 14
[49:29] Isaiah saw that in the heart of the
[49:32] devil he wanted to be above the
[49:35] Vindicated word the sons of God he said
[49:38] but Paul saw him in position in second
[49:41] Thessalonians 2 but see Paul never could
[49:45] announce amen that he was the god of the
[49:47] evil age until the end time age Satan
[49:51] was solemn position in the book of
[49:53] Thessalonians but he took his position
[49:55] in the loudest and age you were Saul in
[49:59] position but now you're taking your
[50:01] position because this is the day of
[50:04] adoption it's Sunday again it's the
[50:07] season when God has Anointed The Bride
[50:10] to go into the place wherein he has
[50:13] promised to go into I say that when
[50:15] Moses died when the prophet left the
[50:18] scene that was when Joshua heard the
[50:21] words you arise and go over this Jordan
[50:24] as long as that Prophet was alive the
[50:27] people could not possess what Moses had
[50:30] talked about but when the prophet passed
[50:32] away then the church began to move into
[50:36] the position which he had told them they
[50:38] never left Moses's words they never
[50:40] aired from what Moses taught but the
[50:43] commission had changed and Joshua was
[50:46] now possessing what was being given he
[50:49] and he said as I was with Moses so shall
[50:51] I be with him well I'll tell you
[50:53] something today the same God that was
[50:55] with a message coming the same God that
[50:58] gave you the promises of the end time
[51:00] message is the same God right here this
[51:03] morning to help you possess the end time
[51:05] message it was God that told us to come
[51:08] to these places it was God that led us
[51:10] into these areas of the word we did not
[51:13] bring ourselves here we did not ask for
[51:15] the season we didn't have the choice of
[51:17] what day we lived in but God who is rich
[51:20] in Merced amen punishing the most wicked
[51:23] of Ages and the most wicked of times but
[51:26] he said there'll be an overcomer in
[51:28] there there'll be a bride in there
[51:30] she'll be without spotter Eco and I will
[51:32] lift her and seat her in a position
[51:35] above all this world and everything will
[51:38] be under her feet come on Church the
[51:41] types are too wonderful all things are
[51:43] under her feet Joshua wheresoever you
[51:46] put your foot shall be your possession
[51:49] whatever God leads you to believe you
[51:51] can have it come on church you've left
[51:54] too much on the table for too long
[51:56] you've lived underprivileged for too
[51:58] long some of you got children you need
[52:01] to claim them this morning you need to
[52:03] put your foot on the Promises of God can
[52:06] I say it better not just your foot on
[52:08] the Promises put your lips on the
[52:10] Promises it's time to start speaking the
[52:14] promises of God and saying they belong
[52:16] to me this is fine I'm going to accept
[52:19] it it's what God's going to give me too
[52:22] long for too long we've allowed Satan to
[52:24] have too much that belongs to us that's
[52:27] right arise therefore and go over this
[52:30] Jordan
[52:31] I believe that was the season we're
[52:33] living arise and
[52:36] Rising we've lived in
[52:39] living home we've walked in other
[52:41] people's promises too long but this time
[52:44] belongs to this bride and it's time to
[52:48] take what belongs to you now I know the
[52:51] season that Joshua came to cross the
[52:54] Jordan was a season of impossibility
[52:56] actually it was a hard time to cross
[52:58] amen it would have been an easier time
[53:01] at other times maybe if the Lord would
[53:03] have waited a few months amen the waters
[53:06] wouldn't have been so raging have you
[53:09] ever went up to a river and it's a nice
[53:11] River but then you go after a big flood
[53:13] or something and the things just rage
[53:15] and it's almost scary amen little ditch
[53:18] outside your house just a little Trinkle
[53:19] of water but you let a lot of rain come
[53:21] and it gets deep and and you can't
[53:24] hardly cross over it a week ago you can
[53:26] just step over it well the Jordan's not
[53:28] a great big river but in the spring of
[53:31] the year comes the latter rain
[53:34] which is the Harvest rain and God was
[53:37] bringing the children of Israel in at
[53:40] Harvest time he was not he was not
[53:43] bringing them in and planting time he
[53:45] was bringing them in in Harvest time you
[53:47] got to realize we are reaping things
[53:50] we've never planted and the Church of
[53:52] the Living God is being brought in at
[53:55] the time of the Harvest we are brought
[53:56] in we are not trying to ring all these
[53:59] things out and figure out what prophet
[54:01] meant and what the prophet didn't mean
[54:02] what truth is and what true faith we
[54:05] have been brought into the season when
[54:07] the seed of this Bible has been brought
[54:10] into the Harvest Time in the Church of
[54:13] the Living God is going to have enough
[54:14] strength to take what God has already
[54:17] brought from the Bible and brought into
[54:19] an Harvest but if you're going to go in
[54:21] and harvest time you're going to have to
[54:22] wage some light of rain you're going to
[54:24] have to live in a latter-range season
[54:26] and it made the Jordan flood in that
[54:30] time that they lived in the waters were
[54:32] flooded it looked like God had lost his
[54:34] had lost his ability to leave because of
[54:37] the Season he's bringing him here the
[54:38] waters are flooding they also say in the
[54:41] same very season that the the Jordan was
[54:44] full because of the snow that was in the
[54:47] mountains of Judea how many he realizes
[54:50] that whenever you put a warm rain on
[54:53] Snowy Mountains you don't only get the
[54:55] rain that's falling you get the snow
[54:57] this melt things were doubling up
[55:00] things were doubling up and they were
[55:03] stealing up the river and everything in
[55:05] them said you can't come into this land
[55:06] he'll never make it in this land but see
[55:09] God had already determined somebody was
[55:12] going to walk it out somebody is going
[55:14] to live this and it was the day the
[55:17] season had come for it to take place and
[55:20] When God says it amen God doesn't have
[55:22] to back up brother he don't have to wait
[55:24] for the seasons to change God can set
[55:27] the season himself God can change the
[55:31] season I don't care the condition if God
[55:34] said go over brother just go over if God
[55:38] said go get it I say just go get it and
[55:41] God will make a way where there is no
[55:43] way y'all know that's right and God told
[55:46] him to go over you know what he did he
[55:48] told them Levites put the word on your
[55:50] shoulders and go over this Jordan and
[55:53] when he told him to put the word see the
[55:55] word goes first now that's the beauty of
[55:58] the age me and you were living in we're
[56:00] not following Miracles and miracles are
[56:02] following us
[56:03] we're not following signs and Gifts
[56:05] that's not what we're doing but they
[56:07] will huddle the True Believer because
[56:10] the believer follows the word I Xtra
[56:12] should not leading by their gifts
[56:14] they're not leading by their imagination
[56:16] they're leading by the word and whatever
[56:19] the word says you can do you can do it
[56:21] it's not what I said it's not what your
[56:23] pastor says it's what the word of God
[56:26] has spoken for your age and the word
[56:29] said go over this land I have given it a
[56:32] possession for you don't you let it
[56:34] depart from the left and to the right
[56:36] and you keep these things on your lips
[56:38] and you you speak these things as you go
[56:41] over this land now God picked an
[56:43] impossible time but God is a god of
[56:46] impossibility
[56:48] and the scripture tells us with a word
[56:51] on their shoulders they took a step into
[56:53] the Jordan and the moment they stepped
[56:55] in the waters parted can you imagine the
[56:58] the supernatural that came at that
[57:00] moment now there are commentators
[57:03] and our historians that say that that
[57:05] was a earth slide up above where they
[57:09] were crossing at the very moment and it
[57:11] was just a good coincidence that things
[57:13] happened well let me tell you I don't
[57:15] believe in coincidences
[57:17] I believe in Divine coincidences I
[57:20] believe God can plan it but it was
[57:22] planned before the foundation of the
[57:24] world and God knew exactly when to tell
[57:26] them to do it the same God that had
[57:29] opened the Red Sea was now opening the
[57:31] Jordans and they went across dry trod
[57:35] the moment they stepped into the water
[57:37] yes it dried up
[57:40] now you're not so powerful if you go
[57:42] back and read the biblical account the
[57:44] Bible says in Joshua 4 that God told
[57:47] them to gather stones out of the river
[57:51] and put them where the where the men of
[57:54] God had stood now they didn't get Rivers
[57:56] off they didn't get Stones off of the
[57:58] bank they didn't go get Stones off of
[58:00] the stone pile over on the bank they
[58:03] took the stones that would normally be
[58:06] way under water and they took stones
[58:10] that had been recovered from a
[58:12] supernatural events that they would have
[58:14] never had if the story wasn't true but
[58:17] every stone that was stacked held its
[58:19] own testimony I came from an impossible
[58:23] situation I came from a time when it
[58:26] didn't look like it could happen but God
[58:28] made it happen anyhow listen that's the
[58:31] kind of God we serve every one of you
[58:33] are here this morning that's a testimony
[58:35] that God can do the impossibilities and
[58:38] they stacked them Stones up because some
[58:40] things you shouldn't forget
[58:42] and God told him take these stones and
[58:45] put them where the feet of them of them
[58:47] men of God stood put them Stones right
[58:49] there with them men stood and they
[58:51] stacked them Stones up in the water see
[58:53] but you all know there were two stacks I
[58:56] I for years I didn't realize that but
[58:58] they passed the two stacks I was
[58:59] studying the scripture and it literally
[59:01] said there was a stack where they stood
[59:03] and there's a stack on the gilgal side
[59:06] and God made two stacks of stones if
[59:09] you're standing on the bank in the
[59:10] middle of high water that was a stack of
[59:13] stones to say Amen there was a time that
[59:15] God dried up this high water and God can
[59:19] do it again but if you were there during
[59:21] a season of drought or a season when the
[59:25] water got low you would see Stone
[59:28] sticking out of the water and somebody
[59:30] would say watch the stone sticking out
[59:32] of the water he said well there was a
[59:33] time that God gathered Stones when the
[59:35] river went dry when the river went dry
[59:38] yes when God dried up there River and
[59:41] Men walked across dry tried that's the
[59:43] way we come into this land and the god
[59:46] that led us in in his Supernatural event
[59:48] also will be a supernatural power to
[59:51] destroy every demon that gets in front
[59:54] of the Church of the Living God he
[59:56] didn't leave us at the Jordan he didn't
[59:58] leave us at the Jordan he did in the
[1:00:01] Supernatural God didn't quit it for
[1:00:03] Jordan that was the god that was leading
[1:00:05] that was the god that was going to
[1:00:07] change circumstances because he remained
[1:00:09] to be God the whole time and they went
[1:00:12] up there I think it's powerful amen it's
[1:00:15] it's if you like to study history it's
[1:00:17] written in history I've actually been to
[1:00:19] that place Chris and I stood right there
[1:00:21] at that place they still baptized people
[1:00:23] there today it's recorded to be the
[1:00:25] place where John the Baptist baptized
[1:00:28] Jesus Christ
[1:00:31] the place where Joshua went over into
[1:00:34] the land type of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:00:37] place that John baptized Jesus and when
[1:00:40] John got ready to baptize Jesus there
[1:00:42] was people standing on the bank and they
[1:00:45] were saying this couldn't be this
[1:00:46] couldn't happen the Pharisees didn't
[1:00:48] like it John the Bible said told them
[1:00:51] don't stand there and say you're of your
[1:00:53] Abraham the father or you're of certain
[1:00:55] class or you're a certain denomination
[1:00:57] he said God's able these Stones
[1:00:59] God's table these Scholars I believe
[1:01:02] John was looking at the same pile of
[1:01:04] stones
[1:01:06] come on it was in the same season that
[1:01:08] he was baptized in Jesus and he said God
[1:01:11] is Heavenly Stones let me tell you this
[1:01:13] God's able Stones arise children under
[1:01:15] Abraham you don't have to come from a
[1:01:17] certain family name you don't have to
[1:01:19] come from a certain class of people come
[1:01:21] on you don't have to have a certain
[1:01:23] education or a certain skin color amen
[1:01:26] there has to be a seed of eternal life
[1:01:28] in you before the foundation of the
[1:01:31] world and the God who is rich in Mercy
[1:01:34] well I feel like amen praising the Lord
[1:01:37] this morning what a God return but an
[1:01:41] hour what a time to believe God's able
[1:01:44] these Stones listen if these men of God
[1:01:46] who God is lifted up in this age won't
[1:01:48] preach this message God will raise up
[1:01:50] for nobody to do it
[1:01:53] come on I know men preached this message
[1:01:55] for years and one day they got to
[1:01:56] thinking it was wrong and God just set
[1:01:58] them aside and went right on and God
[1:02:01] raised up young men to stand right but
[1:02:03] they stood and God's still doing it in
[1:02:05] this age amen you may be having your
[1:02:08] place this morning
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:12] children and Abraham
[1:02:14] I guarantee you God will have a seed
[1:02:18] and he'll keep raising until somebody
[1:02:19] believes
[1:02:21] amen because somebody's going to believe
[1:02:23] it now they were stacked there amen it's
[1:02:25] also written Amen in history now that
[1:02:28] that's the same very place that aligns
[1:02:30] you and Elijah crossed John the Baptist
[1:02:33] likes that place because it's the same
[1:02:35] place that Elijah and Elijah they'll
[1:02:37] crossed in the same place come on Church
[1:02:39] it wasn't a white they all crossed at
[1:02:41] the same place and that's right but the
[1:02:44] bride of Christ crosses is in the realm
[1:02:47] of the supernatural that's where it
[1:02:49] happened that's where it takes place and
[1:02:51] that's where it'll happen again today
[1:02:53] look what happened in Elijah and
[1:02:55] Elijah's time y'all remember when Elijah
[1:02:57] and Elijah went to cross him Elijah
[1:02:59] wanted to cross that River and he just
[1:03:01] took off his coat
[1:03:03] all right and he just struck the water
[1:03:06] and the same God that had opened the
[1:03:09] Jordan in the days of Joshua opened it
[1:03:11] again and Elijah and Elisha walked
[1:03:14] across do I try I imagine Elijah petted
[1:03:17] the Rocks as he walked by amen that same
[1:03:20] God was still alive the same God was
[1:03:23] existing in the Days of Elijah and
[1:03:26] Elisha saw I bet Elijah saw them stones
[1:03:29] and thought my we are living in the same
[1:03:31] day we are living in the same kind of
[1:03:34] day and when they got on the other side
[1:03:36] amen he watched Elijah going to the
[1:03:38] heavens he watched the very reignment of
[1:03:41] Elijah come back to the Earth he watched
[1:03:43] the cloak of a man of God come back on
[1:03:46] the Earth but it returned with a promise
[1:03:48] if you see me go away you'll have a
[1:03:51] double portion of what I have come on
[1:03:54] church and when Elijah saw that Elijah's
[1:03:57] garment come back to the Earth he didn't
[1:03:59] run around pointing at it he didn't run
[1:04:01] around pointing at it say that's that's
[1:04:03] a
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:05] the prophet of God Amen dropping his
[1:04:09] coat back in this age with a message and
[1:04:11] me go around say that's what the prophet
[1:04:13] said that's what the prophet said that's
[1:04:14] what the prophet did that's what the
[1:04:15] prophet did that's what the prophet did
[1:04:17] that's what the but the promise is not
[1:04:19] me pointing about the prophet did the
[1:04:22] promise that I could pick it up come on
[1:04:25] church and when Elijah picked it up he
[1:04:28] started right where Elijah quit come on
[1:04:30] he didn't go through the first two polls
[1:04:32] people's always saying well if you're
[1:04:34] part of the third pool what's your first
[1:04:36] two well that's a devil that's just the
[1:04:38] devil because a bride never was promised
[1:04:40] two pulls amen the first two took place
[1:04:43] in a cave and spoke about vindicating a
[1:04:46] prophet but the third poll was a word
[1:04:48] concerning a bride a 10 Vision amen and
[1:04:52] when Elijah stopped us where Elisha
[1:04:55] started and the bride of Christ were not
[1:04:58] in the first two pearls but brother we
[1:05:00] are a Vindication of the third pool of
[1:05:03] this word and we are not just here
[1:05:06] talking about it we have become the
[1:05:09] Vindication and we're standing here
[1:05:11] wearing the garments and a puppet said
[1:05:13] we could wear I say pick it up this
[1:05:16] morning and strike the water and say
[1:05:18] where is the god of Elijah
[1:05:22] I'm not asking where Elijah is I say
[1:05:24] where's the god
[1:05:26] where's the god of William Branham
[1:05:29] it's here
[1:05:30] Elijah's God is with us today he's not
[1:05:33] on a vacation he's not sleepy he's not
[1:05:36] away he said whatever two or three of
[1:05:38] you together than my name there I will
[1:05:41] be Hallelujah
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:46] brother he saw the same stones
[1:05:49] he saw the same stones
[1:05:52] when Joshua went over when Joshua went
[1:05:54] over that River I'll tell you what
[1:05:57] brother if you don't think God don't
[1:05:59] pre-plan things the Bible records in
[1:06:01] gosh from before 19 the people come out
[1:06:03] upon the Jordan on the 10th day of the
[1:06:06] first month
[1:06:09] that might have been an accident really
[1:06:11] if you read the book of Exodus in the
[1:06:14] 12th chapter you'll see that after 400
[1:06:17] years
[1:06:18] of being bondage in slavery that when
[1:06:22] God sent to Moses unto the people amen
[1:06:25] do you know in the night of their
[1:06:26] Deliverance in the eve of the you know
[1:06:28] what God said unto them in Exodus 12 it
[1:06:31] happened amen this month amen it
[1:06:33] happened in the first month and the
[1:06:36] tenth day of the month Eli or Moses gave
[1:06:40] them the token message that they should
[1:06:42] prepare for a Passover
[1:06:44] it happened in the same season
[1:06:47] it happened in this because God knows to
[1:06:49] see what happened in that season see
[1:06:51] that we're in the fourth month it's it's
[1:06:53] if you get time to study these things
[1:06:55] are beautiful but they were actually
[1:06:56] already in the fourth month would have
[1:06:58] been April Passover Easter time so
[1:07:01] Easter to a Jew is the first month of
[1:07:04] the year
[1:07:05] everybody else starts in January and
[1:07:08] everybody had started maybe in January
[1:07:10] but when Moses talked to God he walked
[1:07:12] in he said this is the first month of
[1:07:14] the year amen that's why when people say
[1:07:17] Passover they also say New Beginning
[1:07:19] because when God speaks to a prophet
[1:07:22] they start over it's a new beginning why
[1:07:26] does the calendar start over when Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ because he's the Passover Lamb
[1:07:31] amen and God started over and Moses and
[1:07:35] leaves telling the children of Israel in
[1:07:37] the 10th day of the first month remember
[1:07:39] what he told them he told him that it
[1:07:40] would be a Passover and God would
[1:07:42] execute judgment upon the gods of Egypt
[1:07:45] if you take time to study it every
[1:07:47] Miracle Moses performed but if you
[1:07:50] really study it you'll find Miracles
[1:07:52] didn't come from Moses they come from
[1:07:55] Aaron where Moses's rod
[1:07:57] hallelujah it's the truth amen and when
[1:08:00] they perform their miracles they
[1:08:02] exercised a miracle over every Egyptian
[1:08:05] deity that was thought to be great among
[1:08:07] them the gods of the Nile the gods of
[1:08:10] the feminine the gods of fatality the
[1:08:12] gods of the of their cattle and God
[1:08:15] exercised the power over every one of
[1:08:17] their cattle every one of their ideas
[1:08:19] every one of their gods
[1:08:21] because he was proven
[1:08:25] proven to get him and things began to
[1:08:27] Dan there but it started with a lamb now
[1:08:30] listen if you want to start over you got
[1:08:31] to start over with lamb
[1:08:34] that's right you can start over but you
[1:08:36] got to have a lamb and it's going to be
[1:08:38] a perfect lamb if you want released from
[1:08:41] your life you're going to have a lamb to
[1:08:42] get released and the Bible said it was a
[1:08:45] new beginning that new beginning had a
[1:08:47] lamb every new beginning has a lamb let
[1:08:50] me say this to you if you like to study
[1:08:52] things this was also the same season
[1:08:54] that Ruth the moabitants entered into
[1:08:57] the Harvest and she met Boaz it was in
[1:09:01] barley harvest the Passover was party
[1:09:04] Harvest New Beginnings are partly
[1:09:06] Harvest your new beginning is in the
[1:09:09] season of harvest when we came into this
[1:09:12] land you are no more a Wanderer you are
[1:09:15] no wonder somebody who was a slave in
[1:09:17] Egypt you are now the children of the
[1:09:20] Living God and God is leading you to
[1:09:22] every promise he made concerning this
[1:09:25] age now you may be sitting here this
[1:09:26] morning saying well brother Wayne I
[1:09:28] don't think that I'm able to do this
[1:09:29] this is a new beginning it's time for
[1:09:31] you to start over the way you think
[1:09:34] start over the way you feel start over
[1:09:36] the way you identify yourself quit
[1:09:39] identifying well whoever that was that
[1:09:42] done those things said those things act
[1:09:44] in those things it's time to start your
[1:09:47] life over again this is Sunday it's time
[1:09:51] to start over again that's a new
[1:09:54] beginning
[1:09:55] brother Samuel I have to say it I don't
[1:09:57] believe in second chances
[1:10:01] God is a god of second chances I don't
[1:10:03] believe that I believe it's got a second
[1:10:05] chance is third chances four chances
[1:10:07] fifth chances six chances seven chances
[1:10:10] eight chances I don't care how long it
[1:10:12] takes if God has called you God will
[1:10:15] change the situation to match what is
[1:10:18] said in his word
[1:10:21] I know the devil's trying to put a
[1:10:23] number on your chances so he can say
[1:10:25] you're out of chances I say the devil's
[1:10:27] too late
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:29] had a chance to Satan has had a chances
[1:10:31] we know the truth now
[1:10:36] Ruth I'm about to start it over
[1:10:39] she she started over at the feet of Boaz
[1:10:43] and so is the Church of the Living God
[1:10:45] started over and this age unto the
[1:10:47] Lamb's Ministry of not just a lamb but
[1:10:50] the life of the Lamb it was a Passover
[1:10:56] Sunday again
[1:10:58] Naomi instructed Ruth you know the story
[1:11:02] and she received her beginning at
[1:11:05] Passover listen it was Rahab the
[1:11:08] harledger
[1:11:09] that has been hid in the Bible this
[1:11:12] entire time
[1:11:13] all of the time Moses and all that
[1:11:16] reading you're doing the children of
[1:11:17] Israel in there amen I don't know how
[1:11:19] old she is exactly but she's old enough
[1:11:21] to have heard of the great Miracles that
[1:11:24] had took place in the crossing of the
[1:11:25] sea and she had been entrenched in her
[1:11:28] lifestyle of prostitution and it really
[1:11:30] wasn't even her fault she was there it's
[1:11:33] just the way she were born and put in
[1:11:35] there by her family now brother man said
[1:11:37] it types you in a denominational system
[1:11:39] or in the filth of Life whatever it was
[1:11:42] you were in but I want to I want you to
[1:11:44] realize that as long as it was under
[1:11:46] Moses's Ministry she never came into
[1:11:49] view that's right
[1:11:50] never was exposed scripturally as long
[1:11:55] as Moses was still there but when Moses
[1:11:57] left the scene and Joshua entered into
[1:12:01] that land he found Rahab in that land oh
[1:12:06] my and where has the bride been found in
[1:12:09] this age you have been found in the
[1:12:11] opening of the word you was found you
[1:12:15] was there it was your season come on
[1:12:17] it's your season to find a bride isn't
[1:12:19] it hell Asia went to the whale to look
[1:12:21] for a woman amen but he found Rebecca in
[1:12:24] the evening light and so has this bride
[1:12:27] been found come on we didn't know
[1:12:28] nothing about a bride we didn't even
[1:12:30] know the pages of this Bible held and in
[1:12:33] time adoption right but now for the
[1:12:36] first time forever at age we'll come out
[1:12:39] of the dark denomination Elizabeth
[1:12:40] resurrection of the power of God his
[1:12:43] soul has been churches and churches and
[1:12:46] brides and Brides but there's got to
[1:12:48] come one
[1:12:49] [Applause]
[1:12:52] so brother Wayne I'll tell you what man
[1:12:55] it's a powerful thing but I don't know
[1:12:56] if we can come out of what we're in let
[1:12:58] me tell you this Rahab couldn't come out
[1:13:00] to that time but then she found her time
[1:13:02] to come out
[1:13:04] Gentiles entered the promise in the time
[1:13:07] of Joshua
[1:13:09] it's Paul in the official
[1:13:14] Church
[1:13:16] and you're found in the book of
[1:13:17] Ephesians after a prophet reveals it in
[1:13:20] the end time listen to this amen it's
[1:13:23] revealed in Joshua amen now now Rahab
[1:13:26] done something in that season she
[1:13:28] received instruction from two men of God
[1:13:30] who told her how to change her
[1:13:32] citizenship all right
[1:13:36] now she heard about the The Exodus had
[1:13:38] happened down there she heard about that
[1:13:40] and she heard about a God that could
[1:13:42] separate Egyptian cattle from Israelite
[1:13:45] cattle she heard about a God who could
[1:13:47] separate Egyptian homes amen from
[1:13:50] Israelite homes she's heard about a God
[1:13:53] that can separate the firstborn of Egypt
[1:13:56] and the firstborn of Israel and she
[1:13:58] wanted instruction how can I get on the
[1:14:01] right side of this separation and those
[1:14:03] men of God else men of God preached the
[1:14:06] token to her amen they said there's a
[1:14:09] sign of the token and if you hang that
[1:14:11] Scarlet thread it'll be a sign unto
[1:14:14] Joshua that you have changed your
[1:14:17] inheritance and you're no longer a
[1:14:20] citizen of Jericho but you're now
[1:14:22] property of the almighty God so when
[1:14:25] Joshua came he was in judgment he was
[1:14:27] Redeemer now I don't have time to preach
[1:14:30] all this but I'll tell you go study a
[1:14:32] goal and in one place they're a judge
[1:14:34] Avenger of blood another place they're
[1:14:35] already gamer and Joshua was both when
[1:14:38] he come to Jordan he was both when he
[1:14:40] come to Jericho he was both an Avenger
[1:14:43] of the blood and he was a redeemer of
[1:14:45] Rahab he destroyed her enemies and gave
[1:14:49] her Liberty I tell you this my God my
[1:14:53] God is still an Avenger every devil
[1:14:55] that's ever touched your life every
[1:14:58] demon that's ever tried to destroy you
[1:15:00] he sent the Holy Ghost to drop down the
[1:15:04] walls that protect those devils and
[1:15:07] cause them to come under the feet of the
[1:15:09] Living God
[1:15:10] I mean now I don't have time to go in
[1:15:13] these types but I'll tell you this amen
[1:15:15] when Joshua come into the Jericho amen
[1:15:17] they shouted after the Red Sea opened
[1:15:21] but when it come to the walls of Jericho
[1:15:24] they didn't shout before they after they
[1:15:27] fell but these men of God started
[1:15:29] shouting before they failed
[1:15:31] showing the Bride of type that that
[1:15:34] would come to confession before it
[1:15:36] becomes a bunch of flourishing and the
[1:15:39] men of God listen what they the prophet
[1:15:41] of God tells us one of the great laws
[1:15:43] that were in the Jubilee was that if you
[1:15:45] were in a walled City you couldn't come
[1:15:47] out
[1:15:49] so if you sold property and it was in a
[1:15:52] walled City when the Jubilee sounded you
[1:15:55] couldn't come out in the Jubilee because
[1:15:56] you were behind a walled city which made
[1:15:59] you a property of that City but when
[1:16:02] Joshua came there was a promise hanging
[1:16:05] on the outside it was on the outside it
[1:16:09] was on the outside of the wall saying
[1:16:11] I'm stuck in here but something 's out
[1:16:14] of here and Joshua knew that he couldn't
[1:16:17] call her out under the Jubilee but the
[1:16:20] God who was rich in Mercy amen had
[1:16:22] Joshua to walk down the walls of Jericho
[1:16:26] to release that daughter of Abraham
[1:16:28] listen they can build all the walls they
[1:16:30] want to around you amen the devil can
[1:16:32] build every kind of complex he wants
[1:16:34] around you and you might not be able to
[1:16:36] come out of it but God has the power to
[1:16:40] tear it down and bring you out of it
[1:16:42] because of something on the outside
[1:16:45] saying God I'm in here and I want out of
[1:16:49] here I take every child of God this
[1:16:51] morning ought to show a sign to God I'm
[1:16:54] trapped maybe if something I don't want
[1:16:55] to be but God don't lead me in this take
[1:16:58] me out of this and he's a God that can
[1:17:01] tear it down this morning I'm talking
[1:17:03] about the supernatural God of Abraham
[1:17:07] that can change lives and hearts he
[1:17:10] remains to be God oh he couldn't take
[1:17:13] her out but he could take it down
[1:17:15] you know why God could do that because
[1:17:17] she was now his property by a token side
[1:17:21] and if you belong to God he can take you
[1:17:24] out of any situation you can get
[1:17:26] yourself into
[1:17:29] It Well by the way you don't know my
[1:17:30] situation we'll talk take it up with
[1:17:32] Jonah then would you
[1:17:35] God can get you out of it
[1:17:38] God can get you out of it you say
[1:17:40] preacher what are you saying I'm saying
[1:17:42] even after a body change Abraham still
[1:17:45] lied
[1:17:48] oh I know the legalist in you that just
[1:17:51] kills you but it's the truth anyhow and
[1:17:54] if you had a body change and Sarah did
[1:17:55] too or the king wouldn't have only on
[1:17:58] his wife but in fear for his life he
[1:18:01] lied to the man come on church amen but
[1:18:05] God knew he was a human
[1:18:10] it's in the Bible the Bible said he
[1:18:12] remembered they were only flesh
[1:18:15] come on church amen now you might as
[1:18:18] well just get real with me for a moment
[1:18:20] here you're not an angel and you never
[1:18:22] were an angel and you're never going to
[1:18:25] be an angel and as long as you've got
[1:18:27] that on your mind the devil's gonna whip
[1:18:29] you around every corner because you're
[1:18:31] going to fail yourself you're going to
[1:18:32] fail your God you're going to fail your
[1:18:34] church because you're a human being and
[1:18:37] you've got to remember I never was an
[1:18:39] angel I'm never going to be an angel but
[1:18:42] I always was a son and God redeemed me
[1:18:45] as a son
[1:18:47] I want to ask you something who's got
[1:18:50] more Authority on the earth a redeemed
[1:18:52] son or an angel in heaven
[1:18:55] oh I redeemed son so if you've got more
[1:18:59] Authority on the earth than an angel in
[1:19:01] heaven the devil is an angel but he's a
[1:19:04] fallen angel and he's failing to hell
[1:19:06] but I know you've got more Authority
[1:19:09] than the devil this morning it's time
[1:19:11] you remember who you are and what God
[1:19:13] puts you on this Earth form
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:18] talking about a people that's been
[1:19:20] annoying to them ordained of God to come
[1:19:23] into this season of time it's Sunday
[1:19:25] again you ought to tell that devil this
[1:19:29] is my day
[1:19:30] his smile
[1:19:33] God called me to this day to worship God
[1:19:36] called me to this day to Rejoice God
[1:19:38] called me to this day to receive the
[1:19:40] benefits of life I will not be robbed
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:47] Rachel what are you talking about I'm
[1:19:48] talking about when God declares you his
[1:19:50] property he has a right
[1:19:53] to clear it of everything that don't
[1:19:55] belong to him
[1:19:57] I just love it I just love how God
[1:20:00] changes things how God could change you
[1:20:03] the other man takes a beautiful thought
[1:20:04] he said when God redeems the Earth he
[1:20:07] said as a new Heaven and a new Earth he
[1:20:09] said oh it doesn't mean an annihilated
[1:20:10] one he said it means god loses it from
[1:20:13] the grip of Satan he said the same way
[1:20:16] he does you and me in our lives he
[1:20:19] reduces it from the grip of Satan now if
[1:20:22] you go into the Bible and you watch The
[1:20:24] Story of Lazarus when Lazarus was in a
[1:20:26] tomb
[1:20:28] but come on Brad when Lazarus was in a
[1:20:31] tune it was the fourth day when Jesus
[1:20:33] the word spoke and resurrected Lazarus
[1:20:35] how many knows that Jesus said I shall
[1:20:37] ReStore in the last days
[1:20:40] number four bugs of death that took the
[1:20:43] tree down and brother man said there was
[1:20:45] four that restored it there's
[1:20:47] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:20:49] of the spirit he said then the word
[1:20:51] itself the word itself that's exactly
[1:20:55] where we are the Pentecostals watched
[1:20:57] look three steps they've all walked
[1:20:59] three steps he said watch that girl
[1:21:01] walking them high heels up three steps
[1:21:03] he said but she couldn't walk the word
[1:21:05] and that's where he fell off was on the
[1:21:07] word but there's a bride that won't fall
[1:21:10] in the last days amen you can't fall
[1:21:13] from the word you are the word
[1:21:17] that's right
[1:21:18] you are what the prophets was talking
[1:21:21] about
[1:21:23] and look at this because you were in a
[1:21:25] tomb somebody thought well hey man
[1:21:27] there's no one sense to trouble the
[1:21:29] master now she he's already dead but
[1:21:31] Jesus said I'll go wake him up
[1:21:36] the vision says he'll wake up on the
[1:21:38] fourth day and you know how he woke him
[1:21:40] up he called his name come on in the
[1:21:42] middle of a graveyard you can have a
[1:21:44] Revival for just one man
[1:21:47] just one man can come out of the Tomb
[1:21:49] showing you there's been churches and
[1:21:52] churches and brides and Brides but
[1:21:54] there's got to be one and he'll call her
[1:21:57] by name she might be in the most wicked
[1:22:00] of all the ages but a Revival will
[1:22:03] happen in that bride because he will
[1:22:05] call your name from the Lamb's Book of
[1:22:06] Life and when he calls your name
[1:22:10] I've often thought about last we're
[1:22:12] sitting down there around the table with
[1:22:13] Abraham been there three days you know
[1:22:18] things
[1:22:21] y'all hear that y'all hear that no no we
[1:22:24] don't hear anything do you hear that no
[1:22:27] I don't hear anything I wouldn't hear
[1:22:29] anything at all it's wait a minute wait
[1:22:30] a minute I know that voice I know that
[1:22:34] voice I've known that but I've heard him
[1:22:36] before hey boys I got a goal I gotta go
[1:22:40] cause up there in the other dimension
[1:22:42] Jesus was saying elizarus
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:45] come forth and Corruption couldn't hold
[1:22:49] him I hope you hear me this morning
[1:22:50] corruption couldn't hold him
[1:22:53] four days a day the Bible said it was
[1:22:55] stinking already corruption had set in
[1:22:58] already death was upon him but listen
[1:23:01] when God speaks for you to come
[1:23:03] regardless of the condition you are in
[1:23:06] God can restore his back to everything
[1:23:09] that you lost he made corruption lose
[1:23:12] its grip upon Lazarus and he raised him
[1:23:17] up the same as he did you
[1:23:20] you were in the tombs of denomination
[1:23:23] and the graves of tradition and the
[1:23:26] unbelief of this world if you wonder if
[1:23:27] I'm telling you the truth read Ephesians
[1:23:29] chapter 2 the Bible said you who were
[1:23:31] dead in sins and trespasses
[1:23:35] right you were dead brother man calls it
[1:23:37] a resurrection a resurrection for the
[1:23:40] bride so she comes out of the Tomb the
[1:23:42] same as Jesus come out of the Tomb in
[1:23:46] three days
[1:23:47] what took a hundred men to put a stone
[1:23:50] to keep him in one Angel broke it and
[1:23:54] moved it out of the way
[1:23:56] it took all those denominations to roll
[1:24:00] a stone over this bride and say she'll
[1:24:04] never rise to that Apostolic Faith again
[1:24:06] but what it took all of them to do God
[1:24:10] sent one Angel Out of Heaven broke the
[1:24:13] seals and rolled back the stone and the
[1:24:15] bride comes out of denomination and
[1:24:18] she's alive brother
[1:24:20] he's alive
[1:24:22] in John the 14th chapter you can read it
[1:24:24] he said because I live you live also
[1:24:27] because I live you live also now you may
[1:24:31] have never heard it this way but go read
[1:24:33] it sometimes paragraph 97 he said I live
[1:24:36] you live also speaking to his wife
[1:24:38] because I live you live what a
[1:24:40] resurrection that was what a
[1:24:42] resurrection this is
[1:24:44] yeah I live you live two lives there I
[1:24:48] live see Jesus raised and ye lived
[1:24:51] you'll raise because I live there'll be
[1:24:54] a resurrection in this bride and at the
[1:24:57] day I'm talking about you will know that
[1:24:59] I'm the father the father me and I in
[1:25:01] you now go read that a little bit and
[1:25:02] see brother Brandon said what happens is
[1:25:04] she materializes the promise she becomes
[1:25:07] Elohim tangible
[1:25:10] once you are resurrected then you're
[1:25:12] transformed and the mortal flesh becomes
[1:25:15] God's flesh your flesh becomes his flesh
[1:25:18] your our eyes become his eyes your hands
[1:25:21] become his hands you are resurrected
[1:25:24] from the dead
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:28] now you said preacher what are you
[1:25:29] saying I'm saying John Amen in the Book
[1:25:31] of John record Lazarus coming from the
[1:25:33] grave he was alive but the Bible also
[1:25:35] records another event it said when he
[1:25:37] came out of the Grave he was bound hand
[1:25:40] and foot
[1:25:42] he was alive but it was all bound up
[1:25:47] Church of the Living God if that ain't a
[1:25:50] story if that ain't a story to preach to
[1:25:52] an end-time people amen they're alive
[1:25:54] brother man said you already resurrected
[1:25:56] come on Church you're not looking for
[1:25:58] the resurrection you're already
[1:26:00] resurrected but they some people had
[1:26:02] become mummified Christians they spent
[1:26:06] four days in the Tomb with that dirty
[1:26:08] stinking gray clothes and they come
[1:26:11] forth and there's new life on the inside
[1:26:13] this new life there's life there amen
[1:26:16] but they still wear them same old
[1:26:19] stinking clothes they had on in that
[1:26:21] tomb hold on come on I'm not talking
[1:26:23] about the clothes on the outside of you
[1:26:25] I'm talking about the ideas I'm talking
[1:26:27] about the traditions and the feelings
[1:26:29] I'm talking about what keeps you tied up
[1:26:33] and the Bible said they were tied up
[1:26:35] hand and foot so in other words I could
[1:26:38] preach a whole sermon here this morning
[1:26:39] called mummified Christians
[1:26:42] and that's something mummified can you
[1:26:44] imagine a Christian That Couldn't raise
[1:26:46] their hands
[1:26:48] can you imagine a Christian that because
[1:26:50] of what they have did and what they come
[1:26:53] out of for some reason the devil has
[1:26:56] bound them that they can't lift their
[1:26:58] hands and worship God I tell you it's
[1:27:00] time at the voice of the word of God
[1:27:03] said loose him and let him go I think
[1:27:07] it's time to lose the church to let Him
[1:27:09] worship again it's time to let him raise
[1:27:11] their hands again I say Satan take your
[1:27:15] filthy dirty hands off of the Church of
[1:27:18] the Living God
[1:27:23] I don't have time to read it but David
[1:27:25] said we ought to praise the Lord
[1:27:26] everything that has breath or to praise
[1:27:28] the Lord but you know why you know why
[1:27:31] that Lazarus couldn't do it because he
[1:27:33] had grave clothes he had it on his hands
[1:27:36] he couldn't lift his hands in Victory he
[1:27:37] couldn't praise the Lord with his hands
[1:27:39] somebody had to untime amen he had bound
[1:27:43] about his feet come on church amen you
[1:27:46] know what I'm talking about amen who
[1:27:48] took dance and out of the church y'all
[1:27:51] help me y'all help me ask me amen
[1:27:53] honestly who took dancing out of the
[1:27:55] church brother man said there was a time
[1:27:57] I was a Critic a real critic of dancing
[1:27:59] he said but God straighten me up on that
[1:28:02] and I saw there was a dance in the world
[1:28:04] and there's a dance in the church come
[1:28:06] on church amen but somebody wrapped up
[1:28:09] the feet of the church and said you
[1:28:11] can't dance you came dancing the Lord
[1:28:13] you can't worship amen but I say we
[1:28:16] ought to take the great clothes off of
[1:28:19] the church
[1:28:20] that they only be able to dance in the
[1:28:23] house of God we ought to be able to wash
[1:28:25] him in the house of God come on church
[1:28:29] we ought to be able to walk in the
[1:28:31] presence of God in the last times you
[1:28:34] know you know Lazarus also had something
[1:28:36] over his face don't you amen that
[1:28:38] covered his mouth where he couldn't amen
[1:28:40] the word he couldn't speak the word he
[1:28:43] couldn't praise God with his lips but I
[1:28:45] say take their grave clothes off this
[1:28:47] morning and rejoice she in the name of
[1:28:50] the Lord
[1:28:51] this is the siege that we live I say
[1:28:54] Satan ought to take his hands off of the
[1:28:56] Church of the Living God
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:00] and all right with it he ain't got no
[1:29:02] right with it he said brother Wayne what
[1:29:04] are you talking about I'm talking about
[1:29:05] when you become God's Property he has a
[1:29:07] right to transform you to the way he
[1:29:11] sees you being look at this prodigal son
[1:29:13] when he left when he left the prodigal
[1:29:16] son left all right but there come a time
[1:29:18] he wanted to come home you know what the
[1:29:21] Bible says about that he said he arose
[1:29:24] he said it here Rose and wanted to
[1:29:27] return home he meant what'd he do he
[1:29:29] raised for my life of sin to return home
[1:29:33] it was a resurrection the same as your
[1:29:35] spiritual resurrection that happens but
[1:29:38] he still had to get home he still had to
[1:29:40] go back to his father but when he arose
[1:29:43] the Bible says this he meant that his
[1:29:45] father saw him coming and said be my boy
[1:29:48] that was dead is alive now
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:29:52] he saw him coming now he didn't see
[1:29:54] somebody else's son
[1:29:55] y'all know what I'm talking about I
[1:29:57] don't know how long he said on that
[1:29:59] porch oh no I don't know how long he was
[1:30:01] gone but he sat on that porch and
[1:30:03] watched that road how long did he watch
[1:30:04] it how long did he sit there waiting day
[1:30:07] after day after day after day and there
[1:30:10] was a lot of people come over that hill
[1:30:12] and there was a lot of men come walking
[1:30:14] down that road but he didn't get up for
[1:30:16] none of them but when he saw his own son
[1:30:20] returning come on church he was alive
[1:30:23] and returning but he had clothes on like
[1:30:27] he was in the world
[1:30:29] come on now come on my Bible tells me
[1:30:31] that the father got up and ran out to
[1:30:34] meet him
[1:30:36] that singer he got inspiration didn't he
[1:30:39] the only time he ever saw God run I tell
[1:30:41] you it's the only time you'll ever see
[1:30:43] my God run it's running to the
[1:30:45] repentance Center that's turned his
[1:30:47] height back to God running to change him
[1:30:50] running you know why he ran he didn't
[1:30:53] only run to greet him he didn't want
[1:30:55] nobody seeing him the way he looked
[1:30:58] well Glory he didn't want nobody to hit
[1:31:02] the house to see what his son looked
[1:31:04] like when he was coming out of the world
[1:31:06] but the Bible said he met him out there
[1:31:08] in the field and brother when he met him
[1:31:11] out there amen amen the Bible said he
[1:31:14] took the best of his shoes and when I
[1:31:16] you know why he took Jews out there
[1:31:18] because slaves in those days didn't wear
[1:31:22] shoes slaves had had lost the effort
[1:31:25] they didn't have the money for shoes and
[1:31:27] you could see a man walking without
[1:31:28] shoes and it was a sign he was somebody
[1:31:30] slave but when that boy got up to return
[1:31:33] home he said in his mind I'll go back
[1:31:36] and be a slave in my father's house but
[1:31:38] he never was a slave to begin with and
[1:31:42] he couldn't come back to being a slave
[1:31:44] you never were a servant you never were
[1:31:47] to begin with you can't go back to being
[1:31:50] God or danger to be a Son of God to
[1:31:54] begin with look at what he did when his
[1:31:56] father met him out there he met him with
[1:31:58] shoes and he put the shoes on his feet
[1:32:00] that if anybody saw him
[1:32:04] ever see him as a slave they would seem
[1:32:07] as a son with the best of the shoes he
[1:32:10] girded his feet but I'm gonna tell you
[1:32:12] something else he did amen the Bible
[1:32:14] said he said bring me the best of the
[1:32:16] robes
[1:32:18] a rich man like that he didn't say give
[1:32:21] me a robe he said bring me the best robe
[1:32:24] we got
[1:32:27] brethren and he met him out there in the
[1:32:30] field
[1:32:31] amen and he took that old filthy racket
[1:32:34] garment he was wearing and he wrapped
[1:32:36] him in his
[1:32:37] room
[1:32:39] oh
[1:32:42] wear something like this
[1:32:46] come on he didn't earn that robe he
[1:32:48] didn't work for that role he didn't
[1:32:50] stand there and put 40 Years of Labor in
[1:32:53] but from the moment he started back to
[1:32:55] his father's house amen he wanted him to
[1:32:58] know you are accepted as a son as though
[1:33:02] you never were in the pit to begin with
[1:33:06] God don't want the world seeing you and
[1:33:08] slopping field
[1:33:11] he took that wrong he took that robe and
[1:33:14] wrapped him he took his own ring and put
[1:33:16] it up on his hand an adopted son was
[1:33:19] returning home a man with his head up a
[1:33:22] man that didn't have to go back home he
[1:33:24] made him worried about what everybody
[1:33:25] was going to think that's what the devil
[1:33:28] does the moment you really want to come
[1:33:29] home and serve God he'll say well what
[1:33:31] about this and what about this and what
[1:33:33] about that and what about this amen and
[1:33:35] it is such a mountain there are many
[1:33:37] people who can never return back to full
[1:33:40] restoration because somebody has said
[1:33:42] you've been gone too long you've done
[1:33:44] too much but listen if you were a son
[1:33:47] amen you always were a son you always
[1:33:50] will be a son I don't care how long you
[1:33:53] were gone God still has a place for you
[1:34:00] foreign
[1:34:01] time I was his property one time you
[1:34:04] were his property but not now
[1:34:07] but not now brother we are right now the
[1:34:10] sons of God now I know I know sometimes
[1:34:13] we get to look in this and we'll say
[1:34:15] well I'll tell you I I don't know about
[1:34:17] all this but you know there's four
[1:34:19] titles to Jesus Christ
[1:34:21] they're four Sun titles Son of God Son
[1:34:23] of David Son of Abraham son of man
[1:34:26] and everyone of those titles give him a
[1:34:28] promise to the Earth to God to heaven to
[1:34:32] the people because he's a son he
[1:34:35] inherits all things as the son of God
[1:34:37] but the devil on the other hand has not
[1:34:41] one title of son
[1:34:43] he is not a son he is the devil a
[1:34:47] Tormentor and the prophet of God said he
[1:34:50] don't own none of it he's a squatter to
[1:34:53] begin with
[1:34:55] amen he said preacher what are you
[1:34:57] talking about let me just say this to
[1:34:59] you I I'm going to run out of time
[1:35:00] before I get there but let me just say
[1:35:02] this to you whoever was living where
[1:35:05] Jericho was when Joshua come to get it
[1:35:07] God said they were squatting on ground
[1:35:10] and belong to them
[1:35:11] right man I don't know how long they've
[1:35:14] been there maybe four thousand years
[1:35:15] maybe they built them walls for 300
[1:35:17] years old but it never was theirs to
[1:35:19] start with
[1:35:20] they were only living on ground that
[1:35:23] nobody was occupying but the moment the
[1:35:25] original owners come to get it they had
[1:35:29] to move God made them move
[1:35:33] now watch the prophet if God tells us
[1:35:35] this he said listen now he said these
[1:35:38] things that God has given the church is
[1:35:40] your legal possession
[1:35:43] they legally Belong To You amen and the
[1:35:46] Devil is a squatter who tries to live
[1:35:49] upon the rights of the church
[1:35:53] now it was some time ago when I was a
[1:35:56] kid brother when I was a kid it was all
[1:35:59] the time
[1:36:00] my dad and one of the neighbors that
[1:36:02] fought over property all the time it was
[1:36:03] a property line but down in Arkansas
[1:36:05] y'all just have to realize that early
[1:36:07] surveyors uh they they I bet they were
[1:36:11] drinking moonshine or something
[1:36:12] because things just didn't it wasn't all
[1:36:15] right you know uh the roads the roads
[1:36:18] that were built in the 70s there and
[1:36:20] some of them cut right across somebody's
[1:36:22] property and one of them went around and
[1:36:23] one of them went around an oak tree and
[1:36:25] I know why it went around the oak tree
[1:36:26] because my grandma said you can't cut
[1:36:27] the oak tree down and the oak tree was
[1:36:29] right on the edge where the road are to
[1:36:31] go and they come to cut it and she set
[1:36:33] it to base up with a shotgun
[1:36:35] so they had to take the road and go
[1:36:37] around it so the property lines are a
[1:36:39] little squibbled right there amen but
[1:36:41] they built the road now but if you go
[1:36:43] down to other area fences built on this
[1:36:44] guy and a little bit on that guy and two
[1:36:46] or three foot here and there and someone
[1:36:47] said well this guy he lived up the hill
[1:36:50] from my dad he lived in the city we
[1:36:51] lived in the county and he was always
[1:36:53] deciding we cleaned up he didn't care
[1:36:55] about this property till we cleaned it
[1:36:57] up my dad hauled a bunch of dirt and he
[1:36:58] was an operator so he cleaned the
[1:36:59] property up real nice and the guy come
[1:37:01] down here one morning build a fence
[1:37:02] right across my dad's front yard
[1:37:05] well now if you know anything about the
[1:37:07] law you can't let that stand
[1:37:09] right so what we what somebody did was
[1:37:11] after dark they hooked a chain to that
[1:37:13] fence and Drug it up the hill
[1:37:16] we didn't steal a fence it ended up the
[1:37:18] man's yard he got all his fence back
[1:37:21] we don't we we can't tell who did that
[1:37:23] yet
[1:37:25] but the fence couldn't stay there
[1:37:27] or we had to have a legal authority to
[1:37:31] move that fence even if it was put up on
[1:37:33] the wrong property
[1:37:35] now now the thing about it is is that
[1:37:37] happened back when I was a kid I mean I
[1:37:39] was 18 year old 17 year old like that
[1:37:41] well now here we are years later 30
[1:37:44] years later amen and the Fellas passed
[1:37:46] away but that same Spirit got in his son
[1:37:49] and his son lives on the property right
[1:37:51] next door to my dad and my dad has
[1:37:52] bought this property and my sister's
[1:37:55] going to move a trailer on it well this
[1:37:57] guy decides that this one property line
[1:38:00] behind where this trailer is going to be
[1:38:02] there's about 10 foot of land between
[1:38:04] her and this road and he don't want her
[1:38:07] accessing that road from that trailer so
[1:38:09] he wouldn't put this big fence right
[1:38:11] between her and this little road and so
[1:38:13] so he did but he actually owns a little
[1:38:15] piece because they put the road in their
[1:38:17] own place so he owns this little piece
[1:38:19] and and I finally asked my dad the other
[1:38:21] day I said this must be the only
[1:38:23] property line in the state of Arkansas
[1:38:24] that actually matters
[1:38:27] because they put it right in the exact
[1:38:30] with the property there's not another
[1:38:32] property line around that area that
[1:38:34] offense is in the right place that one
[1:38:37] that's the only one that matters and I
[1:38:39] told my dad I said well if that guy
[1:38:41] wants to play that way I mean if he
[1:38:42] wants to let's let the lines matter
[1:38:44] let's just let them all matter
[1:38:46] so where you come into my dad's driveway
[1:38:48] you you know it should be just a
[1:38:50] straight drive it's a city street down
[1:38:52] to the edge of the county and you start
[1:38:53] going down this driveway and brother
[1:38:55] Samuel you have to go out around this
[1:38:57] guy's shop
[1:38:59] and you go out like this and then come
[1:39:01] back and then go down to my dad's place
[1:39:02] I always wondered why you had to go
[1:39:05] around like that and I was a kid I said
[1:39:07] well why we always go around that guy's
[1:39:08] shop like that so because it messes the
[1:39:10] driveway up so I I got to looking at a
[1:39:13] plat over all this the guy's shop is
[1:39:15] built right in the middle of my dad's
[1:39:18] driveway I mean literally it's built in
[1:39:20] the middle of the driveway and and so I
[1:39:23] asked my dad I said why don't you just
[1:39:24] get you a lawyer make the guy move the
[1:39:26] shop put all these lines back and end
[1:39:28] all this fussing for once and all and he
[1:39:31] said well son I talked to a lawyer he
[1:39:33] said but if this went uncontested for
[1:39:35] seven years he said there's a squatters
[1:39:37] rights and they now have a right a legal
[1:39:41] right to be there and there's nothing we
[1:39:43] can do about it I said are you kidding
[1:39:45] me he took trespassing too far and now
[1:39:48] we can't kick him off of it he said no
[1:39:50] had it been done years ago he said
[1:39:53] nobody contested it so it's just the way
[1:39:55] it is and I got to thinking about that I
[1:39:57] thought listen now now you got to
[1:39:59] contest these things but I thought I
[1:40:01] wonder if there's a squatter's right for
[1:40:04] the devil but you know what a prophet of
[1:40:06] God said he said there is no squatter
[1:40:09] rights
[1:40:10] he said the Devil is a squatter and he
[1:40:13] has no legal right to anything that
[1:40:17] belongs to you
[1:40:19] I don't care how long he's been there as
[1:40:22] a Son of God you've got a right to
[1:40:25] contest that devil and say get off of my
[1:40:28] property and I'll tell you this God's
[1:40:30] got an agent called the Holy Ghost
[1:40:31] that'll make him get off God sent the
[1:40:34] agent of the resurrected son in this age
[1:40:37] to make that devil get off of your
[1:40:39] property amen I got to look at this and
[1:40:42] the prophet of God said the holy spirit
[1:40:43] is here to make that devil get off of
[1:40:46] your property he's there no matter how
[1:40:48] long it's been he said you actually have
[1:40:51] a right to tell that devil to get up and
[1:40:54] to move off of your property so I I got
[1:40:57] to looking and and you know I I tell you
[1:40:59] I shared this with brother Tim's group
[1:41:01] down there in the e in the in this
[1:41:03] evening uh fall meeting but it's amazing
[1:41:06] there's a Brother David Cross and
[1:41:08] Heather cross is a it's a actual Deacon
[1:41:10] for brother Josh Bennett and I've known
[1:41:12] these people for years and years hunted
[1:41:14] with David I mean we've known him for
[1:41:15] years
[1:41:16] this girl has been suffering with a
[1:41:19] major arthritic condition she's been on
[1:41:21] medication for 15 years I actually
[1:41:24] noticed her hands one day big old knots
[1:41:25] on her Knuckles and on her hands and I
[1:41:28] asked her I said we were eating together
[1:41:29] and I said Heather what's wrong with
[1:41:30] your hands she said brother Wayne that's
[1:41:32] arthritis she said that it's crippling
[1:41:34] she said I have to take all kinds of
[1:41:36] medication I can't hardly get around
[1:41:37] well last year they brought her into the
[1:41:40] meetings and brought her up in the
[1:41:42] prayer line and brother Samuel amen the
[1:41:45] spirit of God came down in that prayer
[1:41:48] line she said I felt a warm feeling come
[1:41:50] over me when we begin to pray for her an
[1:41:53] immediate healing struck that girl's
[1:41:55] body the pain left her the swelling left
[1:41:59] her listen to me 15 years of arthritis
[1:42:03] but the Holy Ghost
[1:42:05] made it move that morning and let me
[1:42:08] tell you something I don't care how long
[1:42:10] the habit's been in your life the Holy
[1:42:12] Ghost is here to say you don't belong
[1:42:14] here in this life say he said well
[1:42:17] somebody said well brother Wayne I've
[1:42:18] been sick for a long time amen it don't
[1:42:20] matter how long you've been sick
[1:42:23] saying this little squatter rights with
[1:42:25] God the prophet of God if you if if
[1:42:27] y'all ever notice the Bible names amount
[1:42:30] of years I never I never knew why
[1:42:32] brother I never I never understood why
[1:42:34] does the Bible say there was a woman of
[1:42:36] an issue of blood for 12 years why does
[1:42:39] it say 12 years amen because I believe
[1:42:42] God wanted you to know she had been
[1:42:44] suffering a long time with that disease
[1:42:46] how many doctors reports were on her
[1:42:49] coffee table how many times has she been
[1:42:52] turned down and said there's nothing
[1:42:54] more we can do for you if you had more
[1:42:57] money we would try but she's out of
[1:42:58] money she's out of hopes she's out of
[1:43:01] efforts but she hears about Jesus and
[1:43:04] the Bible says she went out in the
[1:43:06] street and touched the Hem of His karmic
[1:43:09] and her issue was dried up 12 years and
[1:43:14] it left in an instance because the devil
[1:43:17] was squatting on her health and she had
[1:43:20] a right to call it back again
[1:43:24] 12 years what about a man who 38 years
[1:43:28] later to pull a Bethesda after 38 years
[1:43:31] of sickness in one word Jesus said take
[1:43:35] your bed rise up and walk 38 years and
[1:43:38] God said it's over I'll tell you what I
[1:43:41] I imagine some of you sitting right here
[1:43:43] this morning maybe the devil's told you
[1:43:45] it's been too long
[1:43:48] maybe the devil said it's been too long
[1:43:50] I know I know that the prophet even
[1:43:53] tells us about Georgia Carter was nine
[1:43:55] years in a bed with tuberculosis until
[1:43:59] God calls the prophet to walk in the
[1:44:01] room and say rise up and walk and after
[1:44:04] nine years amen the devil had to give
[1:44:07] the girls Health back to her because
[1:44:09] he's a squatter to begin with it doesn't
[1:44:12] belong to him to begin with listen you
[1:44:15] never did belong to the devil
[1:44:18] maybe you've been maybe you've been in
[1:44:20] something for years and years and you
[1:44:22] said brother Wayne it's been too long
[1:44:23] there's nothing I can do to get out of
[1:44:24] it the devil lied and deceitfully
[1:44:27] deceived you into it in the first place
[1:44:29] or you wouldn't been there to begin with
[1:44:31] he said well I did it willfully did you
[1:44:33] really do it will flee or was you
[1:44:34] deceived I bet you were deceived it's
[1:44:37] kind of like somebody sends you an email
[1:44:39] and says we have a 250 million dollar
[1:44:41] life insurance settlement for you
[1:44:44] because you're rich Uncle removed third
[1:44:45] time diet and you're the closest
[1:44:47] relative and if you just send us 250
[1:44:50] dollars of return fee and a twelve
[1:44:53] hundred dollar uh legal document fees we
[1:44:56] will let you have 250 million dollars
[1:45:00] well if you give them the money you did
[1:45:02] it willfully but you were frauded and
[1:45:04] deceived into doing it
[1:45:07] they deceitfully took it from you
[1:45:09] because you thought you were getting
[1:45:10] something from it but they lied and the
[1:45:12] devil's a liar and he lied to you and
[1:45:15] said if you do this you'll have this if
[1:45:17] you do this you'll have this and he lied
[1:45:19] the whole time he's a fraud he's a liar
[1:45:22] he's a squatter and I say he's got no
[1:45:24] right in the Church of the Living God I
[1:45:27] believe this morning the prophet said we
[1:45:28] are to serve notice on that devil and
[1:45:31] tell him this morning you have no legal
[1:45:34] right in the church you got no legal
[1:45:37] right in my family and I assure thee in
[1:45:40] the name of Jesus Christ you got to
[1:45:42] write for it this morning
[1:45:44] it's time to serve notice on that devil
[1:45:47] and tell him to move off your property
[1:45:50] all right
[1:45:52] won't you stand to your feet with me
[1:45:54] this morning as our musicians come
[1:45:57] I have a right
[1:45:59] you have a right
[1:46:02] to say to that devil
[1:46:05] get off
[1:46:07] my property
[1:46:12] squatters somebody took trespassing a
[1:46:15] step too far
[1:46:19] he come by and visited and set up house
[1:46:22] true but you've got to write this
[1:46:24] morning
[1:46:26] he said brother Wayne it's been a long
[1:46:28] time listen you could tell him to leave
[1:46:30] the devil doesn't have one legal right
[1:46:33] at all
[1:46:36] not one legal right at all
[1:46:40] it's not no claim at all on you
[1:46:43] but if you'll serve notice this morning
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:47] you got a certain notice he said
[1:46:49] preacher what are you saying I'm saying
[1:46:50] it belongs to you
[1:46:53] and if you go to the message Revelation
[1:46:55] chapter 5 I believe it is brother
[1:46:56] Branham explains this real clearly
[1:46:58] and he said from the 40 days
[1:47:01] from the time of the death of Jesus he
[1:47:03] said there were 40 days of dispute
[1:47:06] about the church
[1:47:08] he said but on the 50th day it was a
[1:47:10] jubilee and the Holy Ghost came and
[1:47:13] filled the church
[1:47:16] he said it was a time of the ending of a
[1:47:19] dispute
[1:47:20] he said in recently in 1906 that same
[1:47:23] Holy Ghost fell
[1:47:25] and in 1963 what's this 50 years later
[1:47:30] some people turned down the Jubilee and
[1:47:33] they went back to denomination
[1:47:35] but to the people that accepted the
[1:47:37] Jubilee the seals opened to them and
[1:47:41] gave them an inheritance that belonged
[1:47:43] to you from before the foundation of the
[1:47:46] world
[1:47:48] and this message is calling you to enter
[1:47:51] into that amen and stand here this
[1:47:53] morning and and by and by rights know
[1:47:56] what belongs to you and you can stand
[1:47:58] here this morning and say to the devil
[1:48:00] it belongs to me and I know you're
[1:48:02] possessing it but I got a right to
[1:48:04] contest you and I will not let this go
[1:48:07] uncontested
[1:48:10] I won't do it
[1:48:12] have you ever had something in your life
[1:48:14] and Satan just keeps saying I'm going to
[1:48:15] stay there brother you got to contest it
[1:48:17] that's why brother Ben said you got to
[1:48:18] fight for every inch of the ground
[1:48:20] you're now you're not disputing over who
[1:48:23] it belongs to
[1:48:26] the dispute is over when the seals
[1:48:29] opened
[1:48:30] it was the end of the dispute it belongs
[1:48:33] to you but the devil's possessing it
[1:48:35] and brother Brahm said now you fight for
[1:48:38] every inch of grounds you belongs to you
[1:48:40] you don't fight like you're taking
[1:48:42] something away from him you fight like
[1:48:44] you're taking back what belongs to you
[1:48:47] joy and peace and life
[1:48:50] belongs to you
[1:48:52] listen it's Sunday again
[1:48:57] it's Sunday
[1:48:59] and I believe the Church of the Living
[1:49:00] God is coming the hour of Resurrection I
[1:49:04] wonder this morning
