[44:15] [Music]
[44:21] hey aren't you glad we're gonna let you
[44:26] have your seats here this morning a man
[44:29] just want to certainly greet you in the
[44:32] name of the Lord and so good to be in
[44:34] the house of the Lord with each and
[44:37] every one this morning and so thankful
[44:39] that God has provided for us that we can
[44:42] be here and a reminder I think they
[44:46] mentioned the fellowship dinner here
[44:49] willing right after the service at the
[44:51] North ins Depot and we certainly would
[44:53] love to see everybody there I know it's
[44:57] a sacrifice and it's a sacrifice for
[44:59] everybody but it's just so nice to be
[45:02] able to have a a time where you can sit
[45:04] down and have a meal together and
[45:06] believe it or not the food is not really
[45:09] what I go there for I know I've made
[45:12] different requests from certain ones of
[45:14] you but that's really not live and go
[45:17] there sometimes the the real purpose of
[45:20] it I I like being able to be with the
[45:24] people being able to shake your hand
[45:26] some of you I don't get a chance to talk
[45:29] to you and I you know and be able to
[45:32] spend a little bit of time with you and
[45:34] and the people all together to be able
[45:37] to fellowship with one another I think
[45:40] that's wonderful don't you
[45:43] and I think that's very it's very
[45:45] important the Bible would say when we
[45:48] look at the book of Acts when when the
[45:50] Holy Ghost came among them the Bible
[45:53] would speak of how that they were so
[45:54] moved by the Spirit of God to wear that
[45:57] the things that they did they moved in
[45:58] such unity and harmony to where the
[46:00] Bible says they sold what they had and
[46:03] they distributed it and they had
[46:06] everything in common now and this is
[46:08] what I believe if the Word of God has
[46:11] been restored in this hour to restore us
[46:13] back to that point then these are also
[46:15] the things that brings us back to
[46:17] there's nothing that can bring unity
[46:19] among the people of God like the
[46:23] revelation of Jesus Christ among his
[46:26] people
[46:26] matter of fact this testimony is over
[46:29] and over in the scriptures but I love it
[46:30] and believe it's in the Book of Ezekiel
[46:32] chapter 37 where it speaks of how that
[46:35] God would take the house of Israel that
[46:37] is divided and he said take two sticks
[46:39] and you make them one stick how in the
[46:42] world can you take two sticks or make
[46:43] them one well the same God who said
[46:45] these two shall be one is the same God
[46:48] who does that by the unity of the Holy
[46:50] Spirit coming through his word it's more
[46:54] than what our minds can conceive but I'm
[46:56] so thankful that we have the experience
[46:58] of what it means to be united with God
[47:00] amen and that that love within our
[47:03] hearts it just longs to be where other
[47:05] believers are at to be in fellowship
[47:07] with one another I have a little
[47:09] something that as I'd like to do here
[47:12] this morning I'd like to ask brother
[47:14] Bill and sister Mary to come forward and
[47:17] there's some things that I want to be
[47:19] able to express they are not expecting
[47:21] this and they get on me afterwards it'll
[47:24] be worth it it'll be worth the whippin
[47:26] but I want to do this for all of their
[47:31] labor of love and their sacrifice and
[47:34] and I'm not going to start talking till
[47:36] they get up here
[47:38] but how many just appreciate brother
[47:41] Benno's sister Mary
[48:14] well we want I want to just start in in
[48:19] this year and say like this I feel very
[48:22] much there's more that could be said
[48:24] than what I will say but the thing that
[48:26] I would like to do here this morning is
[48:29] I'd like to celebrate their sacrifice
[48:32] their labor of love where they have and
[48:35] they continue to serve the body of Jesus
[48:37] Christ the scripture says for God is not
[48:40] unrighteous to forget your work and
[48:42] labor of love which ye have showed
[48:45] toward his name in that you have
[48:46] ministered to the Saints and do minister
[48:49] most of us are aware of brother Bill and
[48:53] sister Mary being an instrumental part
[48:55] of this assembly you see him at every
[48:58] event you see him in every service it
[49:01] doesn't matter if it's midweek prayer
[49:03] meeting whatever service it is you see
[49:06] him there we you know we've seen brother
[49:09] bill as he continues to faithfully lead
[49:12] song services and in the early years you
[49:17] know many things that some may not know
[49:18] but for the bill he led in song service
[49:21] in the midweek without any instruments
[49:23] whatsoever so you know that well I could
[49:28] say a lot about that with the musicians
[49:30] right now but he stood and he led within
[49:32] that time and those were in the early
[49:34] years and brother bill would have to you
[49:37] know at times as a song leader there's
[49:39] things that brother Bill had to do that
[49:41] some of our song leaders now have never
[49:43] been faced with where brother bill had
[49:45] to tell people who stood up and thought
[49:47] they had a word for the church sit down
[49:49] and brother bill would have to you know
[49:51] also encourage the he would encourage
[49:53] the people brother bill was always one
[49:55] and you all know these two words that he
[49:57] would say over and over what are those
[50:00] two words go forward and those are
[50:04] things that brother bill would mention
[50:05] and he still mentions here in into this
[50:08] time and we so appreciate brother bill
[50:10] in in leading the songs throughout all
[50:13] the time and as he continues they've
[50:16] been responsible for setting up
[50:18] fellowship dates securing the NORs ins
[50:21] depot a various other
[50:24] used for the fellowship of the Saints
[50:25] since the inception of the church in
[50:28] 1982 they were the ones that responsible
[50:31] for setting up those things whether it
[50:33] was out at new hollow or where if it
[50:35] Rover it might be and now I'm not going
[50:37] to ask the question every one of us have
[50:39] enjoyed it but I feel like that this
[50:41] right here sometimes things take place
[50:43] and we don't know how they take place
[50:45] and and I believe that that's that's
[50:48] important that we would celebrate this
[50:51] you know when we look at it the church
[50:53] even in its early beginnings in the year
[50:55] of 1982 they were one of the first homes
[50:58] among other believers that opened their
[51:00] home for Friday evening tape services
[51:03] and a fellowship gathering for the
[51:05] believers and many of the new converts
[51:08] when we rented the building of the YMCA
[51:11] over there off of Tower Boulevard here
[51:13] in Lorraine and then later moving to the
[51:16] wings of faith it was even within that
[51:18] they faithfully came in with their
[51:21] family very early to set up the church
[51:24] to make sure that everything was ready
[51:26] for each service now if I remind I look
[51:29] at this right here
[51:30] but Marlena I think is a year younger
[51:32] than me or something is that right
[51:34] sister Mary okay so so Marlena was a six
[51:37] year old little girl I would have been a
[51:39] seven year old little boy and brother
[51:41] Dylan sister Mary had had had had three
[51:44] other teenage boys angel Willie and Leo
[51:46] let me tell you something when they
[51:48] would come in now you say how do you
[51:50] know this well because sometimes I
[51:52] stayed a week with them and when when
[51:55] they went when brother bill went to
[51:56] church let me just tell you something
[51:58] Wednesday church started at seven but we
[52:00] got there to the building at like five
[52:02] o'clock
[52:04] let me just tell you this when there
[52:08] were times when right over here that I
[52:09] would drive straight from work and I
[52:11] would come in right over here and come
[52:13] in on a midweek service I'd get here
[52:15] many times at about 3:30 or quarter to 4
[52:17] by 4:30 brother bill was already here
[52:20] for a midweek service not just brother
[52:22] bill but sister Mary also both of them
[52:25] were together and I and I I look at this
[52:29] year they came in and they would come in
[52:31] early to make sure the church was set up
[52:33] to make sure everything was ready for
[52:36] each service don't you appreciate things
[52:38] being ready appreciate that and as the
[52:46] Lord blessed the assembly here with a
[52:48] building where we started to come here
[52:50] and meet in July of 97 and then
[52:52] finalizing everything with this with
[52:55] with with the bank in November of 97
[52:57] they would continue to arrive here early
[53:00] to open the doors of the church and they
[53:02] would ensure that the temperatures were
[53:04] fit for service
[53:11] there's some of them are laughing to
[53:14] kind of know some of the behind on that
[53:15] right there they would they would as a
[53:19] team let me say this they would as a
[53:21] team clean the bathrooms and sweep the
[53:25] floors dust the pews and gather the
[53:28] trash all this was done for 22 years at
[53:33] this building this was done so that by
[53:36] the time the saints of God would begin
[53:38] to come together to worship we could
[53:40] walk in and be able to sit down and make
[53:44] ready for service I'll tell you I don't
[53:47] want you to clap right now where I got
[53:48] more to go but I also appreciate that
[53:53] now I've talked about brother Bill now I
[53:57] won't talk about sister Mary so in this
[54:01] time I guess it's appropriate that I'm
[54:03] talking behind her back right now
[54:07] sister Mary and I have made this known
[54:10] over and over to brother Bill and send
[54:13] it to others sister Mary is truly gifted
[54:16] in her life not just with little
[54:19] children I mean the little children love
[54:22] sister Mary they don't like sister Mary
[54:25] well you might need help sister Mary has
[54:33] truly gifted in her life to organize the
[54:35] various events such as the marriage
[54:37] banquets we've had in the past she had
[54:40] she would had help with she would help
[54:42] she would receive help from those who
[54:45] worked with her but she truly would take
[54:47] the idea and the theme and put it forth
[54:49] an action I remember the first time when
[54:51] the Lord laid on my heart to have a
[54:52] marriage banquet sister Marian said
[54:53] brother Samuel all you have to be
[54:55] responsible for is you pray and find out
[54:57] who God would have come speak for us
[54:59] we've got the rest of it covered and it
[55:02] would order those things and you know
[55:04] sister Mary is a very crafty and honest
[55:07] that that's not a right right word to
[55:08] say here and very we're able to work
[55:11] with crafts well because I don't want to
[55:13] use word you understand what I mean that
[55:15] she can sister Mary can take two ribbons
[55:17] and make a bouquet of flowers out of it
[55:19] is that right amen
[55:24] now you know in one particular vent and
[55:27] I'm gonna say this in one particular
[55:28] vent I've said this one many times but
[55:30] it was a wedding that I had just
[55:32] performed and you know we had performed
[55:36] it and you know here sister Mary she
[55:38] went to the reception as one of the
[55:41] guests of the of the wedding and
[55:43] everyone began to arrive and as
[55:46] everybody begin to arrive it was soon
[55:48] evident that there was no organization
[55:51] and there was at least 200 or more
[55:54] people at this event now I'm gonna call
[55:57] the name because I remember it very well
[55:59] but but here it was because I performed
[56:02] the wedding here it was 200 guests or
[56:04] more and and and they needed to be
[56:06] served and fed and I witness sister Mary
[56:09] walk into the kitchen and those of you
[56:12] worked in the kitchen sister maid you
[56:13] know how she did took the shoes off and
[56:14] she started walking in the kitchen and
[56:16] when she took the shoes off she meant
[56:18] business things are gonna come in order
[56:21] in that in that kitchen amen so I
[56:24] witnessed her walk in that kitchen and
[56:26] she began to give direction where there
[56:28] was chaos after a short period of time
[56:31] tables were organized to place the food
[56:34] on an orderly flow established for the
[56:36] guests to obtain their food as well as
[56:38] for the helpers to replenish the food on
[56:41] the line with a clear direction and flow
[56:43] from and returning to their seats now
[56:46] you can look at that and say that's
[56:47] amazing that's what I thought I sit
[56:49] there in the midst of time and I thought
[56:51] I don't know what's gonna happen here in
[56:53] this situation I was only to perform the
[56:55] wedding I didn't I didn't know about
[56:58] anything else I thought this is already
[56:59] but it was amazing when I seen that and
[57:01] then once everybody was done Sister Mary
[57:05] she picked up you know her items and for
[57:09] her I don't even believe she ate that
[57:10] time I watched brother Bill and her went
[57:13] ahead and left and they went on out
[57:16] without anything being said at all
[57:19] but I think I'm so thankful for that
[57:21] because what we do for the Lord and what
[57:24] brother bill sister may have always
[57:26] represented they have never done it for
[57:28] any acknowledgement or done it for
[57:30] anything at all they've just done it as
[57:33] unto the Lord at the beginning of the
[57:35] special meetings that we would have here
[57:37] in May a few years ago sister Mary would
[57:39] be very instrumental in establishing a
[57:41] menu for the event that way we didn't
[57:43] have a little little bits and pieces
[57:44] brought of food and you run out we had a
[57:46] menu to where we could be able to serve
[57:49] people that were even coming in not only
[57:51] our own but people who are visiting for
[57:54] these special services brother bill
[57:56] would assemble in though with those
[57:58] events brother bill would assemble a
[57:59] crew of brothers to help prepare the
[58:01] venue many times they had to go in and
[58:03] prepare it before we could ever go in
[58:05] there and as well as those that would
[58:07] help to make sure it was cleaned with
[58:09] the gold or the bill would always strive
[58:11] with this the goal let's leave it better
[58:13] than how we found it and this is the
[58:17] thing that you other other parts of it I
[58:19] maybe appreciate when we we go to the
[58:21] Fellowship's and the depot appreciate ya
[58:24] I really do but along with this brother
[58:28] Bill's sister Mary would organize the
[58:30] utensils and the supplies that would be
[58:32] needed to have a fellowship dinner you
[58:35] know fried chickens alright to eat with
[58:36] your fingers but I don't want to eat
[58:38] rice with my fingers I said alright you
[58:41] got to have plates for the food and
[58:43] you've got to have serving I don't want
[58:44] people just reaching in with their
[58:45] fingers and getting everything and so
[58:47] forth you know the same we ought to be
[58:49] able to chew h1 or bubble gum you pray
[58:52] for me because I ain't there yet
[58:54] they would they would they would need to
[58:57] do that the large yellow tubs now I
[58:59] don't know if you've seen them or not
[59:00] but these tubs are big the large yellow
[59:04] tubs that we would see and many of us
[59:06] would help to pack them back into their
[59:08] van along with many of their supplies
[59:10] for the fellowship dinners they would
[59:11] transport to their home after them after
[59:14] it was over they would go in the van and
[59:16] many of us maybe had helped them put him
[59:18] in the van but remember when they got
[59:20] there they took him out of the van they
[59:22] got everything set up then they would
[59:24] take him home and after they would take
[59:26] them home they would thoroughly clean
[59:29] them because
[59:31] singham off just didn't good enough you
[59:33] have to thoroughly clean them and dry
[59:35] and organize the utensils and they would
[59:37] make sure that the supplies such as
[59:39] plates silverware napkins cups and
[59:41] coffee were ready for the next
[59:43] fellowship dinner then they would
[59:45] transport the yellow tubs from their
[59:47] home and other supplies and they would
[59:49] put them right back there in that closet
[59:51] and make ready for the next fellowship
[59:54] dinner now I've got a few scriptures
[59:58] here this is not what I'm preaching by
[1:00:00] the way but this is like a few
[1:00:02] scriptures here Paul would write to the
[1:00:05] Saints in first Corinthians 16 15 and
[1:00:08] say I beseech you brethren you know the
[1:00:10] house of stephanas and it is the
[1:00:13] firstfruits of acacia and they have
[1:00:15] addicted themselves to the ministry of
[1:00:19] the Saints that's powerful
[1:00:22] they addicted themselves to the ministry
[1:00:26] of the Saints eternal life is living for
[1:00:32] others Romans 16:1 all not Paul Paul you
[1:00:38] know but this was meant necessary Paul
[1:00:40] would write of this over and over in the
[1:00:42] scriptures Paul would write at 6 in
[1:00:44] Romans 16:1 Phoebe our sister which is a
[1:00:46] servant of the church which is in
[1:00:48] Orencia that ye receive her in the lord
[1:00:51] has becometh Saints that he assists her
[1:00:54] in whatsoever business she hath need of
[1:00:58] youth for she has been a helper of many
[1:01:01] and of myself also and I thought about
[1:01:03] this this portion in the scripture here
[1:01:06] and it's throughout in every letter that
[1:01:09] Paul would write and I think it's
[1:01:10] fitting for brother bill and sister Mary
[1:01:12] when Paul would write here in verse 3 of
[1:01:16] Romans 16 and it's other places in the
[1:01:18] scripture well greet priscilla and
[1:01:20] aquila my helpers in Jesus Christ and
[1:01:23] Paul would write in another place in 1st
[1:01:25] Corinthians 16 he would write to other
[1:01:27] churches to think about this what it
[1:01:29] would mean to the churches when Paul
[1:01:31] would write and greetings from these
[1:01:32] people too
[1:01:33] Paul would write the churches of LA and
[1:01:36] Asia salute you Aquila and Priscilla
[1:01:38] salutes you much in the Lord I'll tell
[1:01:40] you what when brother Bill and sister
[1:01:42] Mary send their greetings it means a lot
[1:01:44] I'll tell you what means a lot because
[1:01:46] of the life that they live and continue
[1:01:48] to live it means a lot when you'd see
[1:01:51] him at different events when things
[1:01:53] would take place I think of when you
[1:01:55] know we had different needs we're
[1:01:56] different ones that passed on they were
[1:01:58] right there for that and I thought of
[1:02:00] this sister Mary in Romans 16 6 Paul in
[1:02:03] that same greeting
[1:02:04] he said greet Mary who bestowed much
[1:02:07] labor on us when sister Bruce was there
[1:02:12] in the interview with brother Branham I
[1:02:14] always loved this statement sister Bruce
[1:02:16] you know she was she was concerned that
[1:02:18] she might be passing on here brother
[1:02:21] Branham you know among that and we know
[1:02:23] the other question she had but brother
[1:02:24] Branham would would say concerning
[1:02:26] sister Bruce he says sister Bruce I've
[1:02:28] prayed constantly that God wouldn't let
[1:02:31] you die because you're a value to the
[1:02:34] church that's what I want to be said
[1:02:38] about me
[1:02:39] that's what can be said about brother
[1:02:41] Bill sister Mary you're a value to this
[1:02:44] church for the bama dawn and the like
[1:02:54] and sister Bruce in the same interview
[1:02:56] he said she is like sister she is like
[1:02:58] Dorcas of old how that she'd been such a
[1:03:02] blessing and he says Lord and brother
[1:03:03] ben goes in to pray for her and he's
[1:03:05] asking god to heal her in a condition in
[1:03:08] her body
[1:03:09] he says for we need her in the service
[1:03:12] Lord and you know you might you know
[1:03:17] look within this brother bill and sister
[1:03:19] Mary they've come to you know they had
[1:03:20] expressed and some time ago about
[1:03:23] wanting to make you know a transition
[1:03:24] because it's it's what I've mentioned to
[1:03:26] you with the tubs and things like that
[1:03:28] that in itself has been very it's been
[1:03:31] very hard and has time and things has
[1:03:33] went on and so they've made a transition
[1:03:36] within that you know brother bill was
[1:03:38] was praying about it and we really
[1:03:40] hadn't talked about it but then when we
[1:03:42] came together brother bill already had
[1:03:43] somebody on his heart that he had been
[1:03:45] praying about for months I had the same
[1:03:47] one but I asked him who it was first and
[1:03:49] so we like to I'm thankful brother Aaron
[1:03:51] and sister Amanda they have stepped up
[1:03:53] to take on that responsibility
[1:03:55] so I played golf today and now
[1:04:06] as some tokens of our appreciation for
[1:04:09] all that sister Mary and brother bill
[1:04:12] all that you've done for the assembly as
[1:04:14] well as countless others brother bill in
[1:04:16] foreign fields for the bill has been one
[1:04:18] that many times with knowing what's
[1:04:20] going on in the foreign fields as far as
[1:04:22] this offering this needs needs to be
[1:04:24] taken

[1:04:30] house of God somewhere yeah he would be

[1:04:37] this past year he went and when I found
[1:04:39] out he was going different places to

[1:05:13] truly what you have done has been a rule
[1:05:16] sacrifice through the years and what an
[1:05:18] example that is set for us as children
[1:05:21] of God that would so challenge our lives

[1:09:15] even throughout it you know to be able
[1:09:18] to just express your thanks to them just
[1:09:23] how much you appreciate them and loved
[1:09:25] it let's let's look in the Word of God
[1:09:27] this morning I want to look here in a
[1:09:33] place in the word in numbers 15 and
[1:09:38] we'll just see how the Lord would help
[1:09:41] us this morning some things we want to
[1:09:44] just begin to look at and I have kind of
[1:09:48] a lengthy reading of Scripture but I
[1:09:50] think I'll just read a few portions a
[1:09:52] few passages of it and then I'll let you
[1:09:54] two be seated and what can keep on
[1:09:56] reading after that but in numbers 15
[1:09:58] verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:10:03] saying speak unto the children of Israel
[1:10:06] and say unto them when you become into
[1:10:09] the land of your habitations which I
[1:10:13] give unto you and will make an offering
[1:10:18] by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering
[1:10:20] or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in
[1:10:24] a free will offering or in your solemn
[1:10:29] feast to make a sweet savour unto the
[1:10:33] Lord of the herd or of the flock that he
[1:10:38] that offers his offering unto the Lord
[1:10:40] bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of
[1:10:43] flour mingled with the fourth part of
[1:10:45] the hymn of oil and the fourth part of a
[1:10:48] hen of wine or a drink offering shall
[1:10:50] prepare with
[1:10:52] burnt offering or sacrifice for one land
[1:10:56] may God bless you as you're being seated
[1:10:58] bless his word
[1:11:07] maybe for sake of time you could read
[1:11:12] this when you get home because there's
[1:11:15] no way that I'm gonna be able to
[1:11:16] probably even touch a part of it we'll
[1:11:20] see if I can get to where we even this
[1:11:22] morning but where where Moses goes down
[1:11:28] through here is notice the the the
[1:11:32] statement when you become into the land
[1:11:34] in verse 2 of your habitations which I
[1:11:36] given to you and you make a fire and
[1:11:39] make an offering by fire unto the Lord
[1:11:41] and it goes through of the of the
[1:11:44] different offerings the burnt offering
[1:11:46] the peace offering and the freewill
[1:11:48] offering because when we when we look at
[1:11:51] all this in verse 13 he lays everything
[1:11:55] that is to go with it how you to offer
[1:11:56] them meat offering with it the oil that
[1:11:59] is to go with it the wine that's to go
[1:12:01] with it and all of the the necessary
[1:12:04] proportions of which you're to make that
[1:12:06] offering and we we understand that every
[1:12:09] one of these parts it speaks of Jesus
[1:12:14] Christ every one of these parts within
[1:12:17] an offering and verse 13 is where I'd
[1:12:20] like to draw your attention of the same
[1:12:22] chapter and all that are born of the
[1:12:24] country shall do these things after this
[1:12:27] manner in and offering and offering made
[1:12:31] by fire of a sweet savour unto the Lord
[1:12:33] and if a stranger is sojourn with you or
[1:12:37] whosoever be among you in your
[1:12:38] generations and will offer an offering
[1:12:41] made by fire of a sweet savour unto the
[1:12:44] Lord as you do so so he shall do now I
[1:12:48] want you to notice how this is expressed
[1:12:51] regarding these offerings that would to
[1:12:54] offer these offerings with a fire and
[1:12:56] they are a sweet savour unto the Lord
[1:12:59] verse 15 would go on to say this is
[1:13:02] looking at this one ordinance shall be
[1:13:05] both for you of the congregation and
[1:13:08] also for the stranger that's sojourneth
[1:13:11] with you and ordinance forever in your
[1:13:14] generations as ye are so shall the
[1:13:17] stranger be
[1:13:19] before the Lord so God is letting them
[1:13:22] know that these these outlines of had
[1:13:27] the offerings that are to be made when
[1:13:29] you come into the land of the have your
[1:13:31] habitations that I bring you into that
[1:13:34] this same thing applies to you as well
[1:13:38] as to the stranger and in other words
[1:13:41] God said I'm not going to have a
[1:13:42] different word for you then I'm going to
[1:13:44] have for the stranger you see God is
[1:13:46] making known here even the hidden
[1:13:49] mystery of the Gentiles because it's not
[1:13:52] a different word for the Gentiles it's
[1:13:54] the fulfillment of that same word of
[1:13:57] promise and so in verse 16 he would go
[1:14:00] on to say one law and one manner shall
[1:14:03] be for you and for the stranger that
[1:14:06] sojourneth with you now when you look at
[1:14:10] this portion of Scripture
[1:14:11] you-you-you remember the the chapter
[1:14:15] right before this is the chapter where
[1:14:18] that we've seen in that chapter and the
[1:14:22] ones before that is where you had the
[1:14:25] supplies were sent out into the land to
[1:14:27] spout the land to see if it be a good
[1:14:30] land there was no question it was a good
[1:14:32] land but there were ten spies who
[1:14:35] brought back an evil report and there
[1:14:38] were two that brought back a good report
[1:14:41] they they said God is for us and and the
[1:14:45] Lord will be these enemies will be bread
[1:14:48] for us and here they stood in the midst
[1:14:53] of this time and then in the beginning
[1:14:55] of this chapter in verse 15 you find
[1:15:00] that God would take the direction and
[1:15:03] from from chapter 14 where he has
[1:15:07] pardoned according to the intercessory
[1:15:10] Word Spirit of Christ in Moses he has
[1:15:14] pardoned and then God here remember he
[1:15:17] removes those men who brought up the
[1:15:20] evil report God removes them right away
[1:15:23] and then there's others that have joined
[1:15:26] along with
[1:15:27] and God lets them know that you're not
[1:15:29] going to come into the land but I'm
[1:15:30] gonna bring your children into the land
[1:15:32] and so when we see all of this when we
[1:15:36] look at how that God would move here in
[1:15:38] the very beginning verses of the
[1:15:40] scripture and this chapter it is very
[1:15:43] evident that it is the Lord declaring
[1:15:46] that he is and will fulfill his word and
[1:15:50] he's going to continue to fulfill his
[1:15:52] word through his children that believe
[1:15:55] him because he looks upon his children
[1:15:58] like II looked upon Caleb
[1:16:00] he said Caleb my servant had another
[1:16:03] spirit he had followed me fully and to
[1:16:07] him will I bring into this land and this
[1:16:10] is where Paul would say in Romans three
[1:16:13] three four what if some did not believe
[1:16:16] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[1:16:19] God without effect
[1:16:21] god forbid yay let God be true and every
[1:16:25] man alive as it is written that thou
[1:16:28] mightest be justified in thy sayings and
[1:16:30] mightest overcome when thou art judged
[1:16:34] now I want to speak to you on here is
[1:16:37] the offerings in the land of our
[1:16:39] habitation and when we look at these
[1:16:42] offerings that are mentioned here in
[1:16:44] numbers 15 and we think about the last
[1:16:47] few verses that there's not a separate
[1:16:49] statutes and ordinance for those who are
[1:16:51] born in the congregation and then those
[1:16:53] who are strangers but it is for the same
[1:16:56] the statute is the same in the ordinance
[1:16:58] that are the same so as these offerings
[1:17:01] were given in tight to Israel they are
[1:17:04] given to us through the anti-type the
[1:17:08] Lord Jesus Christ himself and so when we
[1:17:11] look at this let's move over to Isaiah
[1:17:13] 56 verse 1 and we find here coming into
[1:17:17] this verse of scripture is prophecy that
[1:17:20] is being worked out and yet is to be
[1:17:22] worked out even towards Israel thus
[1:17:25] saith the Lord keep a judgment and do
[1:17:28] justice for my salvation is near to come
[1:17:32] and my righteousness to be revealed
[1:17:36] blessed is the man that doeth this and
[1:17:39] the son of man that lays hold on it that
[1:17:42] keepeth the sabbath from polluting it
[1:17:44] and keepeth his hand from doing any evil
[1:17:47] verse 3 neither let the son of the
[1:17:50] stranger that had joined himself to the
[1:17:52] Lord speak saying the Lord had utterly
[1:17:55] separated me from his people neither let
[1:17:58] the eunuch say behold I'm a dry tree for
[1:18:02] thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs
[1:18:04] that keep my Sabbath's and choose the
[1:18:07] things that pleased me and take hold of
[1:18:09] my covenant even unto them will I give
[1:18:13] in my house and within my walls a place
[1:18:16] a name better than of sons and daughters
[1:18:19] I will give them an everlasting name
[1:18:22] that they shall not be cut off let me
[1:18:25] just tell you right now we have been
[1:18:28] given his name we have been given his
[1:18:31] name in a marriage ceremony we have been
[1:18:36] brought into the land of habitations
[1:18:38] this land called Beulah this land of the
[1:18:42] invincible Union this land of uniting
[1:18:45] time inside we have come into our land
[1:18:49] of promise where this land can no longer
[1:18:53] be called hepzibah or for Satan but this
[1:18:56] land is called buta for envy the Lord
[1:19:00] the light of his we are given this place
[1:19:04] as his pride it's the hidden choosing of
[1:19:07] Almighty God what Israel has their place
[1:19:10] as his servants and we all are to be
[1:19:13] servants of the Most High God is that
[1:19:15] right but the Bible would recall it and
[1:19:17] it would refer to Israel's two servants
[1:19:19] those who are right there you know has
[1:19:21] attendants that are present and would
[1:19:23] say in revelation 7:3 hurt not the earth
[1:19:26] hurt not the trees hurt not these things
[1:19:28] until my servants have been sealed in
[1:19:31] their forehead so God has not forgotten
[1:19:33] Israel in verse 6 also the sons of the
[1:19:37] stranger that joined themselves to the
[1:19:39] Lord to serve Him and to love the name
[1:19:42] of the Lord to be his servants every one
[1:19:45] that keepeth the sabbath from polluting
[1:19:47] it and taketh hold of my
[1:19:49] covenant even them will not bring to my
[1:19:52] holy mountain and make them joyful in my
[1:19:55] house of prayer hallelujah their burnt
[1:19:58] offerings and their sacrifices shall be
[1:20:01] accepted upon mine altar notice their
[1:20:04] burnt offerings and their sacrifices
[1:20:07] shall be accepted upon mine altar how
[1:20:10] shall we know what is acceptable God
[1:20:13] makes no the acceptable way and the
[1:20:16] acceptable sacrifices it is God's desire
[1:20:20] at work that we would be in fellowship
[1:20:23] with him and we would dwell in the walls
[1:20:26] hallelujah inside of the house of prayer
[1:20:29] inside of the tabernacle of the Most
[1:20:32] High God that we would glare inside of
[1:20:35] Jesus Christ it is God's provision even
[1:20:40] then will I bring to my holy mountain
[1:20:42] and make them joyful in my house of
[1:20:45] prayer their burnt offerings and their
[1:20:48] sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine
[1:20:51] altar for my house shall be called a
[1:20:53] house of prayer for all people
[1:20:56] the Lord God which gathereth the
[1:20:59] outcasts of Israel saith yet will I
[1:21:02] gather others to him besides those that
[1:21:06] are gathered unto Him I'm looking at the
[1:21:09] work of the Lord
[1:21:12] gathering his children unto himself in
[1:21:18] Malachi chapter one here God would speak
[1:21:22] to that of Israel remember they were
[1:21:24] offering offerings but they didn't care
[1:21:26] of how their offerings were being
[1:21:28] offered up they were offering offerings
[1:21:31] that had were MAME lame and blind and
[1:21:33] halt and and here God told him through
[1:21:35] the book of Malachi he said you go take
[1:21:38] what you're offering here and you go try
[1:21:40] to offer that to your boss I mean go try
[1:21:42] to offer that to the to the person in
[1:21:44] your city he let him know if you can
[1:21:47] bring things and offer greater things to
[1:21:49] your boss then you can to me I will not
[1:21:52] accept a sacrifice that is less than
[1:21:55] first place
[1:21:57] are you with me now notice how God would
[1:22:00] come here in Malachi 1 verse 10
[1:22:02] who is there even among you that would
[1:22:04] shut the doors for not neither do you
[1:22:06] Kindle Fire a milder for not I have no
[1:22:09] pleasure in you saith the Lord of hosts
[1:22:11] neither will I'd accept an offering at
[1:22:14] your hand for from the rising of the Sun
[1:22:17] this is talking about us for from the
[1:22:20] rising of the Sun even until the going
[1:22:22] down of the same my name shall be great
[1:22:25] among the Gentiles and in every place
[1:22:29] incense shall be offered unto my name
[1:22:32] and his name is reputation cuddle
[1:23:00] somebody hallelujah when that one Simon
[1:23:03] would hear the woman came into Simon's
[1:23:05] house she was a prostitute and
[1:23:08] everything about her life she came into
[1:23:10] his house and Simon in them dispatched
[1:23:13] her but it was there it was in cases
[1:23:16] like that that his name is made it was
[1:23:20] in situations like that that his name is
[1:23:23] made here his name among us as heathen
[1:23:26] who were found
[1:23:27] we had no promise as Paul said we
[1:23:30] weren't even among the Commonwealth of
[1:23:31] Israel we have we were strangers to the
[1:23:34] covenants but through him by the blood
[1:23:36] of Christ we have been made not
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:43] hallelujah as Rahab was brought in as
[1:23:47] Ruth was brought in as the daughters of
[1:23:52] salafi had were brought in shall pass
[1:23:54] Christ brought us to the Covenant and
[1:23:58] the Commonwealth of Israel Christ has
[1:24:01] brought us you by what by as Union Oh
[1:24:07] glory
[1:24:08] my name is great hallelujah Paul would
[1:24:14] write in Romans 15 15 nevertheless
[1:24:19] brethren I have written the more boldly
[1:24:22] unto you in some sort as putting you in
[1:24:24] mind because of the grace that is given
[1:24:27] to me of God that I should be the
[1:24:30] minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles
[1:24:33] ministering the gospel of God that the
[1:24:37] offering up of the Gentiles might be
[1:24:40] acceptable being sanctified by the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost amen so here we understand that
[1:24:50] how that that the church started there
[1:24:54] on the day of Pentecost and perhaps
[1:24:58] there might be some in your mind and
[1:25:00] maybe even whether you're new or whether
[1:25:02] you're not why do we when we talk about
[1:25:04] the term message it's not something
[1:25:06] outside of the Bible but when we talk
[1:25:10] about the term message we're talking
[1:25:13] about the promises that God made in his
[1:25:16] word for this generation we recognize
[1:25:20] this the promises of God - to you and I
[1:25:24] for this generation this is not just
[1:25:26] another age going by but we are here in
[1:25:30] the time where God is fulfilling not
[1:25:33] just one promise but God is in in now
[1:25:36] to fulfill every promise that he has
[1:25:38] made where all of them down through time
[1:25:41] have looked forward to the fulfillment
[1:25:43] in the sound
[1:25:45] here God on the day of Pentecost
[1:25:48] remember God started that church he
[1:25:51] poured out of his life of himself then
[1:25:54] the church age hadn't even started yet
[1:25:56] and here we find that God he had so
[1:25:59] moved and poured himself into the body
[1:26:02] of believers he it was the revealing of
[1:26:04] the son of man in the body of believers
[1:26:07] in that hour they didn't just have a
[1:26:10] little portion but brother they had the
[1:26:12] fullness of his spirit living through
[1:26:15] their lives is that right
[1:26:17] so much so that when Paul remember
[1:26:20] what's coming against him
[1:26:21] remember when Paul was on his road to
[1:26:23] arrest some more here that same angel of
[1:26:26] light the angel the Lord the same angel
[1:26:29] that met Moses the same angel that was
[1:26:32] sent to John there in Revelations one
[1:26:34] that same angel that came to the Prophet
[1:26:37] that same angel that's not here that
[1:26:40] same Matty angel that same Lord that
[1:26:43] then moving among the people it was the
[1:26:46] same lowered and how that God would move
[1:26:49] down through his word and there was a
[1:26:51] people who were moved there by the holy
[1:26:55] ghost where where Christ himself was
[1:26:57] living fully through their life to where
[1:27:00] on the road there to Damascus remember
[1:27:02] when Paul saw that life brother the
[1:27:05] Bible is clear that that light it out
[1:27:08] shone the brilliancy of the Sun you know
[1:27:10] why because that was the very one
[1:27:13] dwelling in that light that had made the
[1:27:15] SU n it was right there are you with me
[1:27:19] now and Paul asked here in Paul Paul
[1:27:22] knowing that when this happens God's
[1:27:24] going to reveal his name who are you
[1:27:28] lord
[1:27:29] he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutors
[1:27:33] as L write the body of Jesus was already
[1:27:36] seated at the right hand of the Majesty
[1:27:38] on high that ain't talking about God's
[1:27:40] got a right hand in the Sun setting on
[1:27:42] it we recognize better than that the
[1:27:44] Bible said there was one who sat on the
[1:27:46] throne we don't accept those Trinitarian
[1:27:50] doctrines that want to beat the people
[1:27:53] of God down and take from the people
[1:27:55] their inheritance
[1:27:56] and their liberty we don't accept that
[1:27:58] remember the prophet saw that
[1:28:00] Trinitarian doctrine he said it was a
[1:28:02] three-cornered stick and it was beaten
[1:28:04] that woman down but brother let me tell
[1:28:07] you something when the rod of God has
[1:28:10] come with the power of the deity of
[1:28:12] Jesus Christ it will beat her down it
[1:28:15] lifts her up in rapture embrace it
[1:28:18] brings her in position and judgment is
[1:28:21] measured to live the bondage the
[1:28:24] oppression the darkness that she's under
[1:28:26] that she might rise in the newness of
[1:28:31] life Pentecost I'm talking about not a
[1:28:45] Zuza street thank God for what he did
[1:28:48] there but that was not the promise
[1:28:50] restoration are you with me the promise
[1:28:55] restoration was not the gifts the
[1:28:57] promise restoration was that the word
[1:29:00] would return but gifts were to bring the
[1:29:04] people to a place to recognize that he
[1:29:06] steal the supernatural listen God is
[1:29:11] that right gifts are not toys to be
[1:29:14] played with like we saw here on Thursday
[1:29:17] night God sat down God used the gift God
[1:29:20] use the gift part ain't need are you
[1:29:24] with me they're not toys they're not
[1:29:29] things that I've got to have this in the
[1:29:30] service no no we are sufficiently
[1:29:33] impressed with the word in our midst
[1:29:36] gifts are just like the pots and pans in
[1:29:40] your house you don't need the same pot
[1:29:42] to make your grilled cheese that you
[1:29:45] need to be able this pan over here but
[1:29:47] when you need to make spaghetti you need
[1:29:49] that pot is that right we believe it and
[1:29:51] brother let me tell you something Myles
[1:29:53] you can tell by looking at me
[1:29:54] pots and pans are readily available and
[1:29:57] sohave Ulster will hurt my feelings a
[1:29:59] bit at all I've already got my
[1:30:02] sweetheart
[1:30:03] [Laughter]
[1:30:05] will hurt my feelings a bit no sure you
[1:30:09] can tell that we've got plenty you can
[1:30:12] tell that they are available you can
[1:30:14] tell that sister Kim is not just you
[1:30:16] know well we don't have anything we
[1:30:17] don't have anything to cook cook the
[1:30:19] food in you can tell by looking at me
[1:30:20] I'm eating pretty well you can tell that
[1:30:23] there are pots when she needs a pot to
[1:30:25] mentor correct to cook up the potatoes
[1:30:27] it's there when she needs the saucepan
[1:30:29] for the grain we better get off this
[1:30:30] it's there that's the same way that dips
[1:30:34] are in the body they are there for the
[1:30:37] Lord to use in his body
[1:30:43] hallelu for what purpose the edification
[1:30:46] of the body now to return back to that
[1:30:53] place of Pentecost as it was in act
[1:30:57] coming out of the Upper Room and acts
[1:30:59] acts 2 remember Israel went out of this
[1:31:03] land they were taken out of this land
[1:31:05] because they begin to get careless about
[1:31:08] the things of God that begins did you
[1:31:12] know well or the sera sera things just
[1:31:15] became casual like well you know then
[1:31:17] the Lord just loves me and God just
[1:31:19] understands about my needs and the Lord
[1:31:22] knows why then they just begin to become
[1:31:24] relaxed about all of their life they
[1:31:26] didn't even they didn't care and how did
[1:31:29] sin begin to come into their life and so
[1:31:31] God gave them over to a bondage but here
[1:31:35] they are in Babylon under bondage and
[1:31:38] then God here after 70 years would bring
[1:31:42] them back in the land but while they
[1:31:45] were away the land set dormant the land
[1:31:49] just set dormant in the land now why
[1:31:51] won't you understand this God could have
[1:31:54] had it that the land would go on but God
[1:31:56] was letting it be known that you are
[1:31:59] part of this word he's letting Israel
[1:32:02] know I don't got the land just for me
[1:32:05] the land is for you this is for you so
[1:32:14] God will bring them back in the land and
[1:32:16] even in God bringing them back in the
[1:32:18] land would be a type of the Church of
[1:32:21] the Living God in the end time where
[1:32:25] there would be a revealing of a son of
[1:32:28] man there would be a returning back to
[1:32:31] the same original power and glory of
[1:32:35] Pentecost are you with me now and God
[1:32:38] would also make it known in the Book of
[1:32:41] Jeremiah even through they return back
[1:32:44] the first time God would also let it be
[1:32:46] known this is how I'm gonna bring Israel
[1:32:48] back into their land I'm gonna bring
[1:32:51] them back home I'm gonna get him in a
[1:32:53] place and get him ready for my coming
[1:32:58] amen we know a lot of that part I just
[1:33:01] said the last part he's after the bride
[1:33:03] he's taken in a rapture once it's
[1:33:05] finished here with the Gentiles it turns
[1:33:08] to the Jews and those true witnesses
[1:33:10] take her and begin to preach the message
[1:33:12] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[1:33:15] begin to preach there of the true
[1:33:17] atonement and I'm telling you under
[1:33:19] their ministry there is a hundred
[1:33:21] twenty-four thousand that are sealed
[1:33:23] with the same Holy Ghost that you have
[1:33:26] been sealed for and you know what it
[1:33:28] does he had made some ready for his
[1:33:30] corporal
[1:33:30] visitation because at that time God said
[1:33:35] there'll be a fountain Oakland in the
[1:33:36] house of evening for all that is unclean
[1:33:39] they shall be made clean I'm telling you
[1:33:42] right now the fountain is in the house
[1:33:44] of David for us as the Gentiles that we
[1:33:47] can be made clean amen wash from all the
[1:33:53] filth oh my it's a return back to the
[1:33:58] land of Pentecost where Christ is
[1:34:00] dwelling fully in the body believers as
[1:34:02] sons and daughters of God God let it be
[1:34:06] known here in Jeremiah 33 verse 10 thus
[1:34:08] saith the Lord
[1:34:09] again there shall be heard in this place
[1:34:12] talking about the land which ye say
[1:34:14] shall be desolate without man and
[1:34:17] without beasts even in the cities of
[1:34:19] Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
[1:34:20] that are desolate without man and
[1:34:23] without inhabited and without beasts the
[1:34:26] voice of joy and the voice of gladness
[1:34:30] and the voice of the bridegroom and the
[1:34:33] voice of the bride the voice of them
[1:34:35] that shall say praise the Lord of Hosts
[1:34:37] for the Lord is good for his mercy
[1:34:40] endures forever and of them that shall
[1:34:43] bring the sacrifice of praise into the
[1:34:46] house of the Lord for our calls to
[1:34:48] return the captivity of the land as at
[1:34:51] the first saith the Lord and the lujah
[1:34:55] now here we're brought into that place
[1:34:58] as sons and daughters of God first John
[1:35:03] chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of
[1:35:06] love the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:35:08] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:35:12] we were strangers but remember
[1:35:16] everything I've read that could read a
[1:35:18] whole lot more within it but just
[1:35:20] reading what he's inspired for this
[1:35:22] service it was laying there in the Old
[1:35:24] Testament the whole time that God was
[1:35:29] going to visit the Gentiles so I think
[1:35:32] the only thing you can do yeah the best
[1:35:34] thing is accepted and then do what Paul
[1:35:36] said in Romans 16 or Romans 15 he said
[1:35:40] praise the Lord you Gentiles with his
[1:35:43] people praise the Lord for what he has
[1:35:47] done
[1:35:47] you know what you know why you can
[1:35:49] praise because you've been born out the
[1:35:52] Lion of the tribe of Judah and Judah
[1:35:55] means praise you have been born of the
[1:35:58] phrase of Almighty God there is no
[1:36:01] praise in ourselves that is worthy but
[1:36:04] the praise that we bring is the praise
[1:36:06] of his own life and his ala knows I wish
[1:36:13] us twice as big I could shout twice as
[1:36:15] loud hallelu prayer repeat of God
[1:36:22] hallelujah behold what manner of love
[1:36:26] the father has bestowed upon us that we
[1:36:30] should be called the sons of God
[1:36:32] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:36:35] because they knew him not you see what
[1:36:41] are you what church you go well
[1:36:43] organization
[1:36:44] I'm Blanco organization I'm a son of God
[1:36:48] either what what you want one you're
[1:36:52] asking me what this is part of our pure
[1:36:55] language you're asking me what what's
[1:36:58] the son of God this is language that
[1:37:00] belongs to us as the Hebrews of God this
[1:37:06] is language that belongs to us
[1:37:08] language that was lost among the Church
[1:37:11] of the Living God
[1:37:11] you know how was lost he was lost in a
[1:37:14] manner as though well if you pray hard
[1:37:16] enough and if you do this enough and you
[1:37:18] do this enough then you know you'll be a
[1:37:20] son and our God you are always a silent
[1:37:22] dollar bond
[1:37:24] it's not what you did you could make
[1:37:27] yourself worthy he has made us we have
[1:37:33] been accepted in the beloved blob once
[1:37:38] yes we have been baptized into one body
[1:37:41] and that is the all sufficient sacrifice
[1:37:45] it is our Passover Billa beloved now
[1:37:56] somebody say now are we the sons of God
[1:38:01] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:38:04] we know that when he shall appear we
[1:38:08] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:38:12] as he is and every man that hath this
[1:38:19] hope in him purifies himself even as he
[1:38:23] is pure did you catch this every man
[1:38:25] that hath this hope this expectation in
[1:38:28] him purifies himself even as he is pure
[1:38:35] that word purify it means to make pure
[1:38:38] to cleanse to offer to burn as a
[1:38:40] sacrifice now let me just drop this in
[1:38:44] yonkers I'm not going to read it but you
[1:38:46] can read it when you get home in another
[1:38:48] part of the scripture here in numbers 15
[1:38:51] verse 22 through 36 the Lord God comes
[1:38:55] down right after these verses Scripture
[1:38:57] we read he makes a distinction so that
[1:39:00] Israel will know that there is a
[1:39:03] difference between sin that is in
[1:39:07] ignorance ignorance by the congregation
[1:39:10] ignorance by the individual it's
[1:39:13] different than someone who would that
[1:39:15] Bible use that they use the term
[1:39:17] presumptuously or rather they despising
[1:39:20] li I like the man who gathered sticks on
[1:39:22] the Sabbath that he knew better but he
[1:39:26] went ahead and did it anyhow what did he
[1:39:29] do he despised the law of Moses
[1:39:32] and God let it be known for ignorance
[1:39:36] there's a sacrifice come on somebody but
[1:39:41] for somebody who's just walking around
[1:39:42] and I don't care yeah I know what Moses
[1:39:46] said yeah I know what brother Graham
[1:39:48] said yeah I know what the scripture said
[1:39:50] and don't care about it
[1:39:52] that ain't ignorance hello somebody
[1:39:55] because there is mercy for ignorance the
[1:40:00] Bible says in the book of Hebrews that
[1:40:02] he ever liveth to make intercession on
[1:40:04] behalf of our ignorance seeing those who
[1:40:08] are out of the way is that right so you
[1:40:10] see it's different God listen me now God
[1:40:13] is letting them know you think well why
[1:40:14] in the world why wouldn't God put this
[1:40:16] at the beginning of the chapter of
[1:40:18] numbers 15 that's a good question it's
[1:40:21] because when they come into the land
[1:40:23] this is the land of fighting it's a land
[1:40:27] of battles let me just put it like this
[1:40:29] as a prophet would say you can look it
[1:40:31] up on your own because I'm not going to
[1:40:32] read all the quotes to you it's a land
[1:40:34] field there's all traps all around you
[1:40:36] but we're not focused on the traps the
[1:40:39] Devils got traps all around to try to
[1:40:41] beset us is that right now but though
[1:40:43] the banner would tie it up like this and
[1:40:45] say and bring it to you and I just among
[1:40:47] many of the places throughout the
[1:40:48] message he would let us know you've got
[1:40:50] to repent and die daily to live in Jesus
[1:40:54] Christ every day you've got to die every
[1:40:57] day to live in Christ Jesus and you know
[1:41:01] brother Graham would go into you know
[1:41:03] letting it be known how that you know
[1:41:04] just a little joke is told in brother
[1:41:06] Graham would talk about right here he
[1:41:07] said you know I would tell it was joke
[1:41:09] but what he's saying is he said you'd
[1:41:10] better watch it he said because after a
[1:41:12] while he said it believes for another
[1:41:14] joke another joke another joke another
[1:41:15] joke - we're all that person is is
[1:41:17] nothing but jokes come on friends there
[1:41:22] there's times there's certain times I'm
[1:41:23] not going to go through all this there's
[1:41:25] a whole separate message on all this
[1:41:26] right here because I know you've got
[1:41:28] people say oh they'll take this to a
[1:41:30] certain place in a certain limit then
[1:41:31] you've got other people who will take it
[1:41:33] to another place and because he you know
[1:41:35] brother Brandon would have people tell
[1:41:36] him jokes woman you know he's out
[1:41:38] haunting the things like yeah they just
[1:41:39] feel like if they need to live their
[1:41:40] life like that the whole time that is
[1:41:42] error that is you are misusing examples
[1:41:47] that's been given to you but hopefully
[1:41:50] by the grace of God if you've been
[1:41:51] guilty of that you won't be guilty of it
[1:41:53] after today you'll be able to say lord
[1:41:56] help me
[1:41:57] but the RAM says but if you don't watch
[1:41:59] look at the words he uses if you don't
[1:42:01] watch so we have to watch you know David
[1:42:05] will talk about set watches upon my
[1:42:08] mouth is that right
[1:42:10] set watches upon my mouth and brother
[1:42:13] Dan would talk about you know he says
[1:42:15] and the next thing he says just he said
[1:42:17] shun that thing stay away from that then
[1:42:19] brother Ram would bring it on down he
[1:42:20] said you know he said there could be
[1:42:22] somebody come along and he says you know
[1:42:24] somebody could say how did you hear
[1:42:27] about mrs. Dolan and you know and her
[1:42:29] husband and I'll tell you what you know
[1:42:32] this deacon bill ref says here to say I
[1:42:34] don't want to hear it and just walk on
[1:42:38] what my ears are not trashcans my life
[1:42:44] is not a trash bin it's a temple of the
[1:42:48] holy ghost who said you know what I got
[1:42:51] to say is true but is it edifying and
[1:42:54] doesn't minister grace to the here I
[1:42:58] don't want to hear it and just walk home
[1:43:02] but the bread says after a while they'll
[1:43:04] cut it out you see what you're doing you
[1:43:06] doing what the Bible says provoke one
[1:43:08] another unto love and good works
[1:43:10] so I'm brother ramesses the way that you
[1:43:12] fulfilled that scripture you get around
[1:43:14] somebody it talks about somebody
[1:43:15] negative you say something good about
[1:43:16] that person in that presence of that
[1:43:18] individual are you with me so blood Ram
[1:43:21] comes along here he said you know that
[1:43:22] somebody else will say you know brother
[1:43:25] let me tell you what happened I think
[1:43:26] they should get rid of this preacher I
[1:43:27] think you should do that prevents this
[1:43:29] shun that thing and then he says you
[1:43:32] know he said I've seen a little thing of
[1:43:33] three little monkey monkeys you know
[1:43:35] three little monkeys or the bill got me
[1:43:37] one of those things for my office before
[1:43:40] one's got their fingers in their ears
[1:43:42] one's got it upon their eyes and one's
[1:43:46] got well maybe for some it's good
[1:43:51] using two hands everywhere else remember
[1:43:54] brother Brent says I think that's a good
[1:43:56] thing
[1:43:57] hear no evil speak no evil see no evil
[1:44:01] you just keep your mind on Christ and
[1:44:05] look this is very good admonition he
[1:44:08] says now he says now you're never gonna
[1:44:10] be able just to say said you've got to
[1:44:12] watch this you're never gonna get to a
[1:44:14] place you said if you keep on thinking
[1:44:16] that well that your being you'll live
[1:44:17] see you can't live so perfect to you
[1:44:20] don't make a mistake now he's not
[1:44:22] talking about willful sinner
[1:44:23] that ain't mistakes you can't live so
[1:44:26] perfect til you don't make that mistake
[1:44:28] now now don't you think you'll ever get
[1:44:31] that way coz you won't no sir you're not
[1:44:34] sinless but you'll say you'll certainly
[1:44:36] get off the track if you go in that way
[1:44:38] but what a soldier how many soldiers we
[1:44:42] got here now put your hands down for a
[1:44:45] nail we got any cowards here so brother
[1:44:49] Ram would use those two terms to
[1:44:51] describe it over and over the real
[1:44:53] soldier when he's knocked down gets
[1:44:55] backed up again but he said a coward
[1:44:59] when the cowards knocked down he crows
[1:45:01] up back into the water come on somebody
[1:45:07] soldiers get back up again nobody raised
[1:45:12] their hand I ain't preaching the cowards
[1:45:14] I'm preaching the soldiers the graham
[1:45:20] said you get around some man says that
[1:45:25] example you get around somebody doing
[1:45:26] that he says you know he says just shun
[1:45:32] them now he says and then he goes he
[1:45:35] says don't shut him but mark her may
[1:45:38] knows the Bible says mark those are
[1:45:39] called divisions among you how many
[1:45:41] knows that's the truth I know a lot of
[1:45:43] times we don't believe those scriptures
[1:45:44] anymore - somehow or another those
[1:45:46] things are taken out of context or as
[1:45:48] far as where people look at it and they
[1:45:49] have so projected the love of God - the
[1:45:51] love of God as nothing but sappy but
[1:45:53] honey but God's own character is never
[1:45:56] classified as honey
[1:45:57] God will never he told them in Leviticus
[1:46:00] don't you ever offer anything with honey
[1:46:04] come on somebody there's a part within
[1:46:07] it we can't go into that this morning
[1:46:08] but you notice that within this very
[1:46:10] thing notice what brother Bram is saying
[1:46:12] over and over this really struck me in
[1:46:14] this quote he says here they would say
[1:46:15] you know he is saying these things he
[1:46:18] said but don't shun them just mark them
[1:46:21] so how do you mark somebody how do you
[1:46:23] mark somebody this is the examples don't
[1:46:26] pay any attention cause you see what it
[1:46:29] leads to
[1:46:30] he says when they say mmm he said just
[1:46:33] read them say hey how you doing - then
[1:46:35] keep on going there's some people you
[1:46:40] greet and got to keep on going well
[1:46:45] hallelujah his life in us it is the oil
[1:46:51] of that dove life that comes forth it
[1:46:55] brings conviction in our lives and once
[1:46:57] you think of this the closer what we
[1:47:01] just read right here that just referring
[1:47:04] to those passages of scriptures in verse
[1:47:05] 22 through verses 26 36 I do not want
[1:47:09] that to be the focus of our life we tell
[1:47:13] my brother Samuel I don't want I don't
[1:47:14] want it to be a continuum of the focus
[1:47:16] to be a continual sin offering and a
[1:47:18] trespass offering thank God for the
[1:47:20] advocate but we are called to live as
[1:47:23] overcomers come on somebody how am I
[1:47:27] going to have to repent daily you have
[1:47:29] to repent and die daily why the closer
[1:47:31] we live in him the more we see of our
[1:47:36] humanity and the distress of ourselves
[1:47:40] so much that Paul could say I have no
[1:47:43] confidence in this flesh it's to live
[1:47:48] closer to him to where the dells is not
[1:47:53] grieved
[1:47:55] that's the goal of our lives not where
[1:47:59] he can be grieved and he'll come back on
[1:48:01] the trailer got now that's not the focus
[1:48:04] the focus is I want to live
[1:48:06] we'll stay here tonight know if there's
[1:48:11] a nice little thing that bothers him Wow
[1:48:14] I don't want to displease him but I want
[1:48:17] to serve his purpose I don't want to
[1:48:21] just be known as a sin offering and a
[1:48:23] trespass offering Christian I want to be
[1:48:26] known as a Thanksgiving offering a peace
[1:48:28] offering a burnt offering I want to
[1:48:31] offer some offerings that are sweet
[1:48:33] savor in his nostrils brother ramen Emma
[1:48:46] and a message he said shun the thing I
[1:48:49] think that's so important shun the thing
[1:48:50] not the person the only time we're - um
[1:48:53] the person is if the blood has been
[1:48:54] loosed from their life then we're to
[1:48:56] have no fellowship that's the scripture
[1:48:59] but but notice the offerings that are
[1:49:04] mentioned in numbers 15 these are
[1:49:08] offerings than were given in type 2
[1:49:11] Israel
[1:49:12] and they Anna type to us through the
[1:49:15] life of Jesus Christ now I want to draw
[1:49:18] your attention back here just for just a
[1:49:21] few moments this morning and remember in
[1:49:25] verse three the first thing it tells us
[1:49:29] you make an offering by fire unto the
[1:49:32] Lord it's the same fire the same fire
[1:49:36] that wholly consumes the sin offering is
[1:49:41] the same fire that manifests the sweet
[1:49:45] savour of the burn offering of the mill
[1:49:49] offering of the peace offering all of
[1:49:54] that the same fire for that of the it
[1:49:57] manifest and that sweet savour speaks of
[1:50:01] the perfection of Christ's own life
[1:50:11] want you to think about this how that it
[1:50:15] would be offered with every one of these
[1:50:17] offerings the meat offering where that
[1:50:20] Evan which would be a bit of the meal
[1:50:22] offering where every every part of the
[1:50:26] meal of the green it is so ground to
[1:50:29] there's not one part that's bigger than
[1:50:31] another every every part is just the
[1:50:36] same amen he's the same yesterday today
[1:50:40] and forever amen
[1:50:43] everywhere the were to stand for every
[1:50:45] word he met and so they're not to offer
[1:50:48] you know God made it clear don't you
[1:50:50] don't you offer this with leaven or with
[1:50:52] honey and notice every one of these
[1:50:55] offerings on what you just to draw this
[1:50:56] for a few moments every one of these
[1:50:58] offerings that we just read about and
[1:51:02] there's some we didn't read about in
[1:51:04] that chapter but every one of them are
[1:51:06] free will offerings they are not
[1:51:12] offerings that are required or mandated
[1:51:15] they are offered freely from the heart
[1:51:19] of the worshiper they have their feast
[1:51:24] days the solemn feast those are
[1:51:25] appointed times of the Lord that the
[1:51:29] people would make themselves ready to go
[1:51:32] up to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem
[1:51:35] is that right but there are feast what
[1:51:40] we read about right here that they were
[1:51:41] freely offered as the Lord would move in
[1:51:45] the heart of the children of Israel
[1:51:47] being that when they were dwelling in
[1:51:50] the land of their habitations the land
[1:51:55] of our habitations is in heavenly places
[1:51:58] in Christ Jesus
[1:52:01] you understand that no matter where we
[1:52:04] were my place was always to be in Christ
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:10] nobody could take my place number could
[1:52:14] take your place

[1:57:24] the blood cell it is not our perfection
[1:57:28] it is the perfection of Jesus Christ

[1:57:34] that's what Paul would say let us go on
[1:57:38] to perfection we'll keep on baptizing
[1:57:43] people will keep on during this but
[1:57:45] let's go on to perfection I'm just gonna
[1:57:55] stop right here
[1:58:10] in a map I closed it up it's already all
[1:58:13] right there
[1:58:14] it's a free will offering free will
[1:58:19] offering the same Ian works don't say
[1:58:22] it's a view I know that but they show
[1:58:25] the appreciation of what His grace has
[1:58:28] done for me when he tells me watch it
[1:58:36] son watch it right here watch all right
[1:58:38] there
[1:58:38] under watch that right there why because
[1:58:40] I want my life to be an offering unto
[1:58:44] Him when he tells us don't dress like
[1:58:48] that we want to be an offering unto Him
[1:58:50] we are a separated people by the grace
[1:58:56] of God that has come to you and I that
[1:59:00] has transformed our lives the Holy Ghost
[1:59:07] came to quicken the sea to make the
[1:59:10] difference and in our lives
[1:59:12] it's called to be a free offering unto
[1:59:17] you I want to offer the burnt offering
[1:59:22] which would speak of the devotedness of
[1:59:26] his life you know what I want to do your
[1:59:29] will the depth of that goes clear down
[1:59:34] to where things that can absolutely be
[1:59:36] right on the word but the Prophet would
[1:59:38] pick it up and say if our motive and
[1:59:39] objective is wrong it's the same thing
[1:59:41] as it not being the will of God I want
[1:59:44] to offer the peace offering fellowship
[1:59:46] between he and I how I appreciate this
[1:59:48] fellowship because you all know why I
[1:59:52] was empty
[1:59:56] but he came and knocked on my door of my
[2:00:00] heart Lord I believe this message is
[2:00:09] true but am i part of it I've been
[2:00:14] raised in it as a young person but I'm
[2:00:16] not part of it
[2:00:19] lord I don't know I failed many times
[2:00:22] I've made an attempt but alone are you
[2:00:23] still merciful that's your answer
[2:00:28] he's knocking on your door that's your
[2:00:33] answer
[2:00:34] he sends his answer fast personal
[2:00:38] presence you want your answer if it
[2:00:41] steal that ship you want your answer if
[2:00:45] you're a part of him you want your
[2:00:48] answer he's knocking on your hearts door
[2:00:54] halleluh halleluh and opening up that
[2:01:03] door he said out come in
[2:01:07] I'll come in hallelu and I will sup with
[2:01:12] you and you with me what she said we'll
[2:01:16] have peace offerings together we will
[2:01:20] eat up this word amen I will take up
[2:01:24] that word and I will open it to your
[2:01:27] heart
[2:01:29] Thanksgiving offerings unto the Lord
[2:01:38] no wonder David could say I won't enter
[2:01:42] his gates with Thanksgiving in the heart
[2:01:48] I will enter his courts with praise I
[2:01:54] will say this is the day that the Lord
[2:01:59] hath made and I will be glad and rejoice
[2:02:04] it
[2:02:14] how about it this morning throughout
[2:02:16] this congregation you know even when God
[2:02:18] dealing with has dealt with our lives
[2:02:20] you know even in him coming to manifest
[2:02:25] his saving grace he's already done the
[2:02:28] work but you know what it takes our own
[2:02:32] freewill
[2:02:32] let's just say Lord I accept what you
[2:02:38] have done for me I can't get these
[2:02:43] leopard spots off of me
[2:02:45] but I accept the one who has done it for
[2:02:50] me the one who is not in my heart see
[2:02:53] your whole walk our whole walk has been
[2:02:56] birthed on free will and then after God
[2:03:02] moves down it never stops it's still
[2:03:05] voluntary isn't it it's voluntary the
[2:03:10] things that we do it's voluntary
[2:03:13] it's freewill were admonished to do many
[2:03:16] things but yet God does not hold it over
[2:03:18] our head he doesn't want us let's say
[2:03:20] we're in one example he don't want us to
[2:03:22] come to church because all the preacher
[2:03:23] will get mad at us and you know no God
[2:03:25] wants it to be a free will offering
[2:03:27] remember what a free will offering comes
[2:03:29] from it comes from your heart and if you
[2:03:32] can just take your heart and take the
[2:03:34] knock on your heart and just put it in
[2:03:36] his hands
[2:03:36] watch what he can do with your life
[2:03:40] what's what he will continue to do with
[2:03:44] your life
[2:03:45] let's pray Lord Jesus throughout this
[2:03:51] building this morning Lord you have
[2:03:53] spoke and you're continuing to speak
[2:03:56] you've not you've ministered to our

[2:04:28] our themselves to that knock on their
[2:04:30] heart if there's something that's out of

[2:07:26] aware of maybe accidents and different
