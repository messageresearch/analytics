[31:43] how many times or will this uh occur
[31:47] again as far as us when we come back
[31:49] together and then we have to go back to
[31:51] streaming we don't know that uh but one
[31:53] thing that we do know is for certain and
[31:56] that we can set our expectations on and
[31:58] that's is and that is this that if we
[32:02] are not able gather here in person uh
[32:06] within within a short time or in a
[32:08] moment we know one thing for sure we are
[32:10] heading uh to another gathering and that
[32:13] is that is the rapture and that's on and
[32:16] so we just want to be just just mindful
[32:20] of these things and I want to encourage
[32:22] you uh just to continue to to press on
[32:26] uh and looking uh to the Lord in in in
[32:29] every in everything in our daily life
[32:31] this is a time that we uh we live in
[32:34] it's a time that I believe that it's a
[32:37] time for the word uh to live and the
[32:39] word that has been living the word is to
[32:42] live it's a faith uh that is to be a
[32:44] living faith within our life uh in
[32:47] everything that we do is to trust the
[32:49] Lord uh that is that is our solemn trust
[32:53] and this is where all things that we see
[32:55] around us uh we see everything fading
[32:58] there is there is nothing we can put any
[33:00] trust in except that Kingdom that God
[33:03] has established within the hearts of his
[33:06] children by the Holy Ghost that's a
[33:08] kingdom that cannot be shaken that's a
[33:10] kingdom that that's a kingdom that can
[33:12] be trusted because that is his word so
[33:15] we just want to say we love you and we
[33:18] appreciate you and we just look forward
[33:21] to the time as we just continue to
[33:24] evaluate uh everything that is around us
[33:27] and that is present in this hour and we
[33:30] just want to go forward in serving the
[33:32] lord so um uh I think that's that's all

[35:41] behalf of your children in the name of
[35:44] Jesus Christ amen amen as we read in
[35:48] Genesis 22 I want to come back into this
[35:51] place and I just want to encourage you
[35:53] as you're streaming there at home uh to
[35:58] to know that you know brother many times
[36:00] you hear what brother Bram will say uh
[36:03] maybe he says that was not for someone
[36:05] who's here but maybe it's for someone
[36:07] who was out there on the telephone
[36:09] hookup or someone who will be listening
[36:11] or someone who will hear it by tape and
[36:14] how many times we we hear that and to
[36:16] know that God he is mindful so your need
[36:20] and just in in everything just put it
[36:22] before God and let's just let's just
[36:25] join our hearts together and not allow
[36:28] uh any any separation that we might be
[36:31] in person don't don't allow that to
[36:32] hinder us but let's just put our all
[36:34] into this and let's just pull from God
[36:37] this morning in Genesis
[36:40] 22:1 and the Bible says and it came to
[36:43] pass after these things that God did
[36:46] tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham
[36:51] and he said behold here I am and he said
[36:55] take now thy son
[36:58] thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest
[37:02] and get thee into the land of Mariah and
[37:06] offer him there for a burnt offering
[37:08] upon one of the mountains which I will
[37:12] tell thee of and Abraham rose up early
[37:16] in the morning and saddled his ass and
[37:19] took two of his young men with him and
[37:21] Isaac his son and clav the wood for the
[37:24] burnt offering and Rose up and went unto
[37:27] the the place of which God had told him
[37:30] then on the third day Abraham lifted up
[37:33] his eyes and saw the place a far off and
[37:38] Abraham said unto his young men abide ye
[37:42] here with the ass and I and the lad will
[37:46] go Yonder and worship and come again to
[37:51] you may God bless you and bless the
[37:53] reading of his word uh those of that are
[37:57] here is being seated and we as we we
[38:00] look at this this
[38:02] portion uh of of the
[38:05] scripture it's very much so when we see
[38:09] the life and we see what God uh did
[38:14] through Abraham it certainly was a
[38:17] shadow of what God would do through
[38:21] everyone of Abraham's seed and we know
[38:25] that Abraham's seed itself
[38:28] uh was not uh merely it was not pointing
[38:32] to just was not pointing to the Natural
[38:34] seed uh because we see a natural seed in
[38:38] terms of ishmail we see also the natural
[38:42] seed in Isaac that failed but we find
[38:46] that this seed that is spoken of is that
[38:49] Faith seed which would which would come
[38:52] forth as we know to be the Lord Jesus
[38:56] Christ and so so when we look here in in
[39:00] in the scriptures of what God uh has
[39:03] spoke to Abraham and I want to just deal
[39:06] with this part a little bit further this
[39:08] morning on focused in to the program of
[39:11] God and I I certainly believe that this
[39:13] is something it's not just to be in this
[39:16] hour but it is it is that which is to be
[39:19] about a life of a believer that our life
[39:23] is not just something that is to be uh
[39:26] just wonder in about but it is to really
[39:29] be positioned in Jesus Christ and to
[39:32] really be focused on what God's will is
[39:36] in this hour and to know that God uh has
[39:41] has has a word that God has given and
[39:44] God has revealed for this time and for
[39:47] this season and we look here in the
[39:50] scripture in in in Romans 4 and when I I
[39:55] look at this scripture in Romans 4 uh to
[39:59] notice of how that in in this of where
[40:02] the Bible says in verse 21 and Abraham
[40:06] being fully persuaded that what he had
[40:11] promised he was able also to perform now
[40:16] remember in the scriptures that are
[40:18] around this this chapter here uh brother
[40:21] Brandon would write it like would say it
[40:23] like this he says whenever I get gloomy
[40:25] he said this is the chapter I go and I
[40:27] read Because in this chapter we find
[40:31] that in Abraham's life that there was a
[40:34] journey that started but when we begin
[40:37] to read here and I think it's maybe in
[40:39] verse 17 and onward you recognize that
[40:43] this correlates with what is taking
[40:45] place in Genesis 17 when God would
[40:48] reveal himself to uh Abraham as the
[40:52] almighty God elhadi the breasted one the
[40:56] strong one
[40:57] the nourisher the one who makes one
[41:02] fruitful and to see how that you know
[41:05] within this how God would even draw
[41:08] Abraham's attention you remember in
[41:11] Genesis 17 how that God would draw
[41:14] Abraham's attention even as he did here
[41:16] in Genesis 22 he would refer to Isaac as
[41:20] thine only son take thine only son the
[41:23] one whom thou lovest and to remember
[41:27] that you know God had told him your Heir
[41:30] is the one that will come forth from
[41:32] your own loins and remember after even
[41:36] God speaking that we we recognize that
[41:39] you know Sarah got to looking at uh the
[41:43] inabilities that she has and she uh as
[41:47] brother bam re says it she slightly
[41:50] doubted the promise and she said take
[41:53] Hagar and and perhaps God will give me a
[41:56] child by her but we recognize that God
[41:59] doesn't need any help in fulfilling his
[42:02] word God only needs yielded vessels to
[42:07] him and it's God that steps in it's God
[42:10] that fulfills his word as a matter of
[42:13] fact when it comes down to it for even
[42:15] the Christian Life there is not one
[42:18] person that can live the Christian life
[42:21] outside of God himself coming down in
[42:25] that life and then it becomes
[42:27] God in us living out his own word so
[42:32] we're just we become the yielded vessels
[42:34] unto God and this scripture I want you
[42:38] to look at this here in verse 21 it says
[42:40] and being fully persuaded and This this
[42:44] term fully persuaded it means to fill
[42:48] one with any thought a conviction or an
[42:52] inclination or a h to make one certain
[42:55] to persuade or convince one to be
[42:58] persuaded fully convinced or assured to
[43:01] render inclined or bent on and I I want
[43:04] to just say it like this this is not
[43:07] Abraham's thoughts it was not Abraham's
[43:10] thought in the beginning it was God's
[43:13] mind it was God's voice Abraham had
[43:16] received a supernatural call even when
[43:19] Abraham had left that of the ear of
[43:22] childes and received that call Abraham
[43:25] heard God's voice and it was calling him
[43:27] out and he believed what God was saying
[43:31] to him and the Bible says it was imputed
[43:33] unto him for righteousness Abraham was
[43:36] moving along as the voice was speaking
[43:39] to him but as it comes into this this
[43:42] place in Romans 4 this is this is no
[43:46] longer Abraham's Faith but this is God's
[43:51] faith moving in supremely in Abraham's
[43:54] life this is Abraham rece receiving
[43:57] God's own mind God's Own thought so now
[44:01] it's not Abraham's faith that he's
[44:04] walking by but it is God's faith God has
[44:07] been giving Abraham strength all along
[44:10] but now remember Abra God allowed
[44:13] Abraham to come to his end he had fed in
[44:16] ishmail his stream of life was still
[44:18] there in Genesis 16 but God allowed that
[44:22] stream of life to dry up Abraham could
[44:26] no longer father any children he was
[44:29] dead Abra and and Sarah even the
[44:31] deadness of her womb but this is the
[44:34] time where there was deadness now it's
[44:37] time for elhadi the strong one to step
[44:41] on the scene when God allowed Abraham to
[44:44] come to his end then God could step in
[44:47] do you see God can never step into a
[44:50] life until that life is willing to come
[44:53] to its end God does not put his life
[44:56] upon a life life but God allows a life
[44:58] to come to its end that that life it
[45:01] surrenders to him that God might fully
[45:05] bring his life in that it might be said
[45:08] that our life is a reflection of Jesus
[45:13] Christ
[45:15] so Abraham of where he's of where he's
[45:19] at within this time God's faith moving
[45:22] in remember it's in this chapter in
[45:25] chapter 17 that Abraham receives the
[45:29] change of his name he receives he
[45:33] receives uh the the spirit of God and he
[45:37] receives the adoption very quickly in
[45:40] that chapter of Genesis 17 he receives
[45:43] the very part of God's Own Name Elohim
[45:47] and that part of Elohim that latter part
[45:51] god takes part of his name and he places
[45:55] that upon Abram's name so he would be
[45:58] called
[45:59] Abraham he his life is now filled with
[46:03] God's own life his breath his life his
[46:07] nature it's now Abraham because now it
[46:11] will not be uh Abraham trying to father
[46:14] a child it will be God operating through
[46:18] Abraham's life and brother Brandon would
[46:20] say it like this he said it was that God
[46:23] was moving upon Abraham because Abraham
[46:27] would reproduce the faith of Elohim to
[46:30] think when God when in the very
[46:33] beginning his mind what God had in his
[46:36] mind God God already he believed his
[46:39] word God spoke his word God believed his
[46:43] word and his word came to pass and
[46:46] that's the same thing within the life of
[46:48] each and every one down Through the Ages
[46:51] it has not been their faith that has
[46:54] brought the word to pass but it is been
[46:57] God that would draw he would pull upon
[47:00] that part on the inside that was
[47:03] redeemable that was part of that word
[47:05] and the voice of God would sound out let
[47:08] me tell you something to just look at
[47:11] you and me how we were if just looking
[47:14] at us you could have no faith in us but
[47:17] God never had faith in this but God has
[47:20] faith in his word and God has sown his
[47:23] word though laying dead though laying
[47:26] dormant in our life but God has
[47:29] confidence in his word that when he
[47:32] speaks his word and his Spirit Goes
[47:35] Forth to raise that word up in our life
[47:38] God has confidence in
[47:40] himself so Abraham was was was anointed
[47:44] was called of God to
[47:47] reproduce the faith of Elohim you see
[47:53] even within our own lives God has given
[47:56] us of his own name we we do not take our
[48:00] own name but we receive his
[48:04] name and so Abraham in this journey that
[48:08] we look at here in Genesis
[48:11] 22 Abraham had not only seen the
[48:15] supernatural he had experienced the
[48:18] supernatural it's not enough to see it
[48:21] you have to experience
[48:23] it this journey that he's making is not
[48:26] based on what he seen alone you see
[48:30] there are many people that had s even in
[48:33] the meetings of brother random and saw
[48:37] the supernatural but never experienced
[48:40] it I'm not just talking about a healing
[48:43] of their body that's a that is indeed a
[48:46] supernatural work but the supernatural
[48:49] work that I am talking about is why God
[48:53] would make himself visible in his word
[48:56] because he's calling us to an experience
[49:00] by the word that is a supernatural
[49:03] experience and he appears and makes
[49:06] himself known that I am El shat ey your
[49:11] strength alone cannot do it but if
[49:14] you'll just yield to me I will bring my
[49:17] strength into your life and I will raise
[49:20] up my son and daughter on the
[49:23] inside it's God's desire you see just in
[49:27] the days of the Lord Jesus Remember many
[49:30] Saw The Miracles many ate of the Loaves
[49:34] and fish they saw the supernatural but
[49:37] that wasn't enough you have to
[49:39] experience the
[49:40] supernatural they had to go on into the
[49:44] upper room and receive the real baptism
[49:48] of the Holy Ghost it wasn't enough that
[49:51] they walked with him in Luke 24 and saw
[49:54] him step out of the Shadows that had to
[49:57] go to the upper room so you must not
[50:00] only be to be a real witness of the
[50:02] Supernatural is not just what you see or
[50:06] what you feel but there must be a
[50:09] genuine experience on the inside that no
[50:13] man can do no church can do only God can
[50:18] do that work on the
[50:21] inside let me just dwell with
[50:24] that Abraham was in the
[50:27] climax of The
[50:31] Journey he had already
[50:35] experienced a change where it changed
[50:38] them young
[50:39] again remember their bodies were dead as
[50:43] far as they're not able to produce the
[50:47] promise God allowed it to get to that
[50:50] place you know sometimes God has God
[50:52] will allow a life to get to a place to
[50:56] where they know I can't do it and when
[51:00] they're getting to that place and that's
[51:02] the time that God says they're getting
[51:04] ready into the place now where I can
[51:08] really get to a spot that they can be
[51:11] birthed into my kingdom but before that
[51:14] if a person walks and says well I can do
[51:17] this and I'm trying to do this and I can
[51:19] do this then God can't do anything he
[51:22] cannot even make himself his glory known
[51:26] in the real Supernatural transformation
[51:29] of his power you see in Hebrews 11:11
[51:33] the Bible said through faith also
[51:37] Sarah received strength to conceive
[51:42] seed and was delivered of a child when
[51:44] she was past the age I want you to catch
[51:46] this Sarah through faith received
[51:51] strength to conceive seed and she was
[51:54] delivered of a child when she was past
[51:57] age because she judged him
[52:00] faithful who had made the promise let me
[52:02] just say
[52:04] it you know as we read in the scripture
[52:07] when she journeyed down there and abamec
[52:10] beheld her in Genesis
[52:13] 20 he looks upon her she is
[52:17] beautiful she is fair he wants her to be
[52:23] a part of his kingdom she he wants her
[52:27] to be his wife but notice how God even
[52:30] when Abraham stood there and said once
[52:33] again tell them you're my
[52:36] sister even in that moment it shows that
[52:41] the program of God can never be
[52:48] overthrown God's program cannot be
[52:51] dismantled or overthrown his program
[52:55] marches onward
[52:57] you see in this here through faith Sarah
[53:03] herself to remember you know brother
[53:05] Brandon would place it like this in the
[53:08] message believest thou this he said you
[53:12] know he says it was Abraham's faith that
[53:16] produced the miracle in Sarah's womb now
[53:20] the Bible says Sarah herself received
[53:24] strength she had to receive re that
[53:27] strength that Faith had to become her
[53:31] faith it had to become operative in her
[53:35] life now think of this here is Abraham
[53:39] here now to reproduce the faith of
[53:43] Elohim God stepping in to Abraham and
[53:47] Sarah's life and transforming their
[53:50] bodies in order to meet the conditions
[53:54] of what the promise has called for now
[53:57] remember in the Old Testament the the
[54:00] the
[54:01] woman uh could not be saved but only
[54:06] through the circumcision of the
[54:09] man she had to come in in a union
[54:12] because the woman could not be
[54:14] circumcised it was the man that was
[54:16] circumcised so the only way that the
[54:19] woman could come into the Covenant and
[54:21] come into a circumcision she had to be
[54:24] United in a marriage Covenant with her
[54:28] husband and then she was identified
[54:31] under his seal and in the Covenant that
[54:35] is made with that seed so Sarah Sarah
[54:39] here being a type of of the in time
[54:42] bride even in this moment to where that
[54:46] we and ourselves and in the Gentile
[54:48] bride you you and I could never have
[54:51] come into the Covenant Promises of God
[54:54] we were alien aliens of the Commonwealth
[54:58] of Israel we were like Rahab we were
[55:00] like Ruth we were like all of them but
[55:03] there came one who would stand for us
[55:06] and a union with boas brought Rahab in a
[55:10] union with with Simone brought Rahab in
[55:13] hallu it's like the daughters of zad
[55:16] they had no way to get into their
[55:19] inheritance the only way is there had to
[55:21] be a kindred of their father's tribe and
[55:24] they would have to marry him and he
[55:28] would bring them into that Covenant and
[55:31] that's the same way in Jesus Christ we
[55:34] are brought into the Covenant by the
[55:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost this is a
[55:40] circumcision that's not made with hands
[55:43] Paul would lay it so clearly this
[55:45] circumcision remember circumcision was a
[55:48] sign that God placed in the flesh of
[55:52] Abraham as a seal of the righteousness
[55:56] of of his faith so that Sarah herself
[55:59] would be under that same seal that
[56:02] Abraham was sealed by oh my we are under
[56:05] the same seal that God sealed his son we
[56:09] are under the same seal that God has
[56:11] sealed his word in this hour we are
[56:15] sealed with the book we are under the
[56:18] same designation and the Seal of God's
[56:21] own
[56:23] life that same seal
[56:26] and this is this is where as we find
[56:30] under that Union it's God's faith Paul
[56:34] sading
[56:35] through it's God's faith moving through
[56:39] you see it's that same revealed faith of
[56:43] the hour it was Abraham's faith that
[56:45] performed that miracle in Sarah's womb
[56:49] Sarah was United with that
[56:51] faith that same revealed faith of this
[56:54] hour is the the same faith that Jude
[56:59] wrote by admonition contend earnestly
[57:02] for the faith that was delivered to the
[57:05] Saints this is not human Faith this is
[57:08] God's faith coming down because it it
[57:12] would be and it has to be God's faith in
[57:15] order to reproduce the promise this is
[57:17] where Satan he's tried to trample
[57:20] underfoot he's trying to trample it
[57:23] underfoot that same faith that same
[57:27] original outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[57:30] that word that true experience that word
[57:33] birth that new birth all of them being
[57:36] the same he tried to trample it out but
[57:38] you see the faith of the Son of God has
[57:41] prevailed through the Church of the
[57:43] Living God all the way down through the
[57:46] Gentile ages there's been some Believers
[57:49] the scripture denotes them as the
[57:51] Overcomers in that age he that ha an ear
[57:55] let him hear what the spirit said to the
[57:58] church endowed with the ability to hear
[58:01] God's voice not just see the
[58:04] supernatural but become an absolutely
[58:08] Supernatural work themselves of the
[58:11] Living God oh my and to see how God
[58:16] himself even moving in this time it's
[58:19] the same Faith that's present in the
[58:22] bride body of
[58:24] Believers it's that same faith that same
[58:27] faith that Paul would write of we you
[58:30] know referring to it very often and Paul
[58:33] would say the life that I now
[58:37] live I live by the faith of the Son of
[58:42] God not my faith God's
[58:46] faith remember through the scriptures as
[58:48] we looked at it last week when Jesus
[58:50] would say uh daughter thy faith hath
[58:53] made thee whole he would say thy faith
[58:56] has done that and we recognize you have
[58:58] to have faith but for that in order for
[59:02] that come to come to pass he would take
[59:04] now God coming down and recognizing that
[59:08] Faith his brother R would say your faith
[59:10] and my faith together now he said God
[59:13] will step down and his faith is what
[59:16] will bring the miracle to pass and so
[59:20] Paul said it's not the life the life
[59:22] that I now live he lived a different
[59:25] kind of life before
[59:27] and now live by the faith of the Son of
[59:30] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[59:36] so as we read in Romans 4 Abraham being
[59:41] not weak in faith this was not human
[59:43] Faith this was not this was not faith
[59:46] that we see uh faltering in the other
[59:50] chapters and you know here and and
[59:52] moments because God was dealing with
[59:54] Abraham in in each Junction of time but
[59:58] when it came time to reproduce the
[1:00:00] promise it would require God's faith
[1:00:04] supremely
[1:00:06] alone now the Bible says that Abraham as
[1:00:10] we read in our text that Abraham he said
[1:00:13] to his young men abide you here with the
[1:00:16] ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and
[1:00:20] worship and come again to you what faith
[1:00:28] Abraham did not did not know what was
[1:00:31] going to take
[1:00:33] place but he knew one
[1:00:35] thing we're going to go and
[1:00:39] worship and then we're going to come
[1:00:41] back to
[1:00:43] you in other words the form that I have
[1:00:47] Isaac with me now he's going to come
[1:00:49] back in that
[1:00:51] form and Abraham the Bible says in verse
[1:00:54] six he took the wood of the burnt
[1:00:58] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[1:01:01] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:01:03] knife and they went both of them
[1:01:06] together I want you to think of
[1:01:09] this as God would make this known to
[1:01:13] Abraham you know brother randam and
[1:01:15] dramatizing and he said perhaps God
[1:01:17] spoke to Abraham on a Sunday
[1:01:22] afternoon and then Monday came around
[1:01:24] and you know how Mondays can be be
[1:01:26] sometime it's a time that brother B
[1:01:30] tells us he said after what God has in
[1:01:32] all the confidence he's instilled in you
[1:01:35] in that service the enemy wants to come
[1:01:37] and try to knock it out of you so to
[1:01:41] think of the things and and the thoughts
[1:01:43] that would be trying to come in Abraham
[1:01:46] and and all of these things look what
[1:01:48] God God has given you this child look
[1:01:51] what and and and now God is asking you
[1:01:53] to take this child to take this child
[1:01:56] and to offer it up but you see Abraham
[1:02:01] brother R would say it like this and I I
[1:02:03] just believe this he said Abraham could
[1:02:06] look there on that Monday morning and he
[1:02:08] could look at Isaac and he knew what God
[1:02:11] had said and he would look at Isaac and
[1:02:13] he said his heart just going out there
[1:02:16] he said but Abraham would have to turn
[1:02:18] from that and Abraham looked to the word
[1:02:21] of God God took something that was so
[1:02:24] dear promise that he had given him and
[1:02:29] now Abraham here in the midst of that he
[1:02:32] turned his Focus completely to obedience
[1:02:36] to the
[1:02:38] word he made ready one of the opening
[1:02:42] scriptures we read here the Bible says
[1:02:44] that Abraham chopped
[1:02:47] wood I don't know about you but
[1:02:49] sometimes there's things that we have to
[1:02:50] do that you know what it takes a lot of
[1:02:52] motivation to do it
[1:02:57] it's easy when there's certain things
[1:02:58] that's asked that kind of goes along and
[1:03:01] everything's going all
[1:03:03] right long as it don't inconvenience us
[1:03:06] as long as it just you know keeps on
[1:03:08] going a certain way that's all
[1:03:11] right but see Abraham the Bible says he
[1:03:15] prepared the wood when Abraham he
[1:03:18] prepared for this
[1:03:23] journey Abraham could even the wood the
[1:03:26] sacrifice all the knife even the
[1:03:29] sharpening of his knife Abraham did not
[1:03:32] say well if I forget the knife then we
[1:03:34] won't be able to offer him up but he
[1:03:36] took fully he knew what it meant to
[1:03:40] sacrifice and Abraham took everything
[1:03:44] that was required he had offered
[1:03:46] sacrifices upon altar upon this altar
[1:03:50] but this was the final altar of
[1:03:53] Abraham's Christian Journey
[1:03:56] everything had prepared him for this
[1:03:59] moment let me just say this to recognize
[1:04:02] when you and I are standing in the
[1:04:04] blending of Time and Eternity standing
[1:04:07] on the very verge of the change of the
[1:04:10] body they that have went on before us
[1:04:13] the Bible says they without us should
[1:04:16] not be made perfect it's we can't get by
[1:04:20] with anything less we must come through
[1:04:24] every process that that God has laid out
[1:04:27] every word must be word on top of word
[1:04:30] on top of word every line upon top of
[1:04:33] line that right there speaks of a real
[1:04:37] true experience it's not just the letter
[1:04:40] of the word but it's to have the spirit
[1:04:43] of the word and to have that genuine
[1:04:46] birth on the inside that is word on top
[1:04:48] of word line on top of line precepts on
[1:04:52] top of
[1:04:54] precept Abraham
[1:04:57] he made ready for the
[1:05:01] miraculous you see Abraham he was
[1:05:04] already
[1:05:05] prophesying we're going to go
[1:05:07] worship me and the lad we're going up
[1:05:11] there we're going
[1:05:14] alone and we're going to come back down
[1:05:18] here we're coming back down here we're
[1:05:21] going up there we're coming back down
[1:05:24] here he made ready for the miraculous to
[1:05:27] take place you see you got to make ready
[1:05:29] for the
[1:05:31] miraculous it's the people in this hour
[1:05:34] you see God has sent what's necessary in
[1:05:39] order to prepare us for this great
[1:05:43] translation he said in John 14 let not
[1:05:46] your heart be
[1:05:47] troubled if I go away I go away to
[1:05:51] prepare a place for you that where I am
[1:05:55] there you may be also you realize he
[1:05:59] made the necessary preparations for you
[1:06:04] and I that preparation is so that we
[1:06:08] could die and be born again he made
[1:06:14] preparation for us he prepared the way
[1:06:18] he opened the way for you and I it had
[1:06:21] to be a preparation it's just like when
[1:06:23] God remember here coming to to the Earth
[1:06:28] uh into fulfillment of Isaiah 9:6 there
[1:06:32] were scriptures that were laid out that
[1:06:35] the messenger should come first Elias
[1:06:39] shall come all of the scriptures that
[1:06:42] were were set forth and laid out and we
[1:06:45] see it identified in John John's
[1:06:49] Ministry that it was to prepare the way
[1:06:54] it was a message that would all them to
[1:06:56] repentance a message that would remove
[1:06:59] all of the obstacles and the everything
[1:07:02] so that the word might have free course
[1:07:04] so God has sent a necessary
[1:07:08] preparation and this is where I love how
[1:07:10] brother Ram says this in the junction
[1:07:12] time he talks about Noah building an ark
[1:07:14] he says he was not only working a
[1:07:18] miracle but he was preparing for a
[1:07:22] miracle the church today is not only
[1:07:25] only having Miracles but it's preparing
[1:07:29] for a miracle the coming of the Lord
[1:07:31] Jesus Christ and the Rapture of the
[1:07:34] church to be taken up he said give me a
[1:07:38] church
[1:07:39] ready visualized to see signs and to see
[1:07:44] the omnipotent God the great power of
[1:07:47] God moving amongst the people which the
[1:07:51] Rapture will be an easy thing when Jesus
[1:07:54] comes they'll be caught up because they
[1:07:57] believe in such
[1:08:00] Hall you can't believe in a miracle like
[1:08:05] this until you first become a miracle
[1:08:10] amen amen you see Abraham was not only
[1:08:14] seeing the supernatural he had become a
[1:08:18] witness and experience of the
[1:08:21] supernatural he
[1:08:23] knew how God had come and so transformed
[1:08:28] his life you see this is why through the
[1:08:31] revealing of the word signs that take
[1:08:35] place we see God working and God moving
[1:08:39] right here Among Us right in lives and
[1:08:42] you see to also see lives and to know
[1:08:46] see to be visualized is to see the
[1:08:51] supernatural God coming and transforming
[1:08:55] lives
[1:08:56] not making well we're going to make
[1:08:58] better people that is not what God comes
[1:09:00] to do God comes to raise up that dead
[1:09:05] man on the inside that son or daughter
[1:09:08] of God that seed that's been laying
[1:09:11] there dead the whole
[1:09:15] time and to be United with him to become
[1:09:19] a miracle and you know when you become a
[1:09:21] miracle it's not anything you can
[1:09:24] explain it's not anything that you had
[1:09:28] anything to do with it's what you
[1:09:31] surrendered yourself
[1:09:34] to that's the Simplicity of the Gospel
[1:09:38] is a surrender to his
[1:09:43] will the Bible says in 1 John
[1:09:46] 2:27 the anointing which you have
[1:09:50] received of him abideth in you and you
[1:09:53] need not that any man teach you but as
[1:09:55] the same anointing teacheth you all
[1:09:57] things and is truth and is no lie even
[1:10:01] is even as it ha taught you you shall
[1:10:04] abide in him notice the anointing the
[1:10:07] word the
[1:10:09] person that you have received of him
[1:10:12] he's the one that is teaching you he's
[1:10:16] the one that's opening the word he's the
[1:10:20] one that is revealing the program of God
[1:10:24] he's the one that's revealing the
[1:10:26] direction and the leadership in your
[1:10:29] life it's him taking the word and
[1:10:32] unveiling that word notice he goes on to
[1:10:37] say and now little children abide in him
[1:10:40] that when he shall appear we may have
[1:10:43] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[1:10:46] at his coming if you know that he is
[1:10:49] righteous you know that everyone that
[1:10:51] doeth righteousness is born of
[1:10:53] him John
[1:10:55] goes forward to say in 1 John 3:1 behold
[1:11:00] what manner of love the father hath
[1:11:03] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:11:06] called the sons of
[1:11:08] God therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:11:11] because it knew him not beloved now are
[1:11:17] we the sons of God not we're going to be
[1:11:21] we are now the sons of God and it does
[1:11:24] not yet appear
[1:11:25] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:11:29] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[1:11:34] we shall see him as he is because
[1:11:38] remember in in the times when we look at
[1:11:41] with Abraham's life God appeared to
[1:11:44] Abraham many times appeared to him in
[1:11:47] the revealing of his
[1:11:50] word God had visited him there we see in
[1:11:54] a Time
[1:11:56] and MDC as God revealed himself then we
[1:11:59] see over here we see how God would Veil
[1:12:04] himself in that little white light we
[1:12:06] see how that God would step down and
[1:12:08] take the elements of dust in Genesis 18
[1:12:12] and Veil himself and here in each of
[1:12:15] these times it's God appearing according
[1:12:19] to the promise and to recognize that
[1:12:22] it's to
[1:12:23] receive his appearance it's to receive
[1:12:26] God coming in the form of his word and
[1:12:30] making himself known making himself real
[1:12:35] when God Reveals His word that's God's
[1:12:38] voice it's God calling our names it's
[1:12:42] God calling to that son or daughter on
[1:12:45] the inside you realize the scripture
[1:12:47] said that he that I behold I stand at
[1:12:50] the door and knock that's not what it is
[1:12:52] on your heart like that but his knocking
[1:12:55] is his voice that's calling your name
[1:12:59] that's speaking to your life and say
[1:13:01] don't you want to turn your life over
[1:13:03] don't you want to surrender your life
[1:13:05] don't you want to yield your life and
[1:13:07] brother B said and for those who have
[1:13:09] yielded their life that voice on the
[1:13:12] inside re resounds out of your life and
[1:13:15] says aren't you thankful you surrendered
[1:13:18] your life to
[1:13:21] him it's yielding to him you see it's
[1:13:24] making
[1:13:25] ready because in
[1:13:28] order to see him and to be a part of the
[1:13:32] Rapture the change of the
[1:13:35] body that promise there's got to be a
[1:13:40] change a
[1:13:42] transformation a new birth on the inside
[1:13:46] first without the token without the new
[1:13:49] birth there is no
[1:13:52] Rapture it's something much much deeper
[1:13:55] than a good life it's more than a
[1:13:58] righteous
[1:14:00] life it's a holy life produced by the
[1:14:03] holy God by a Holy Faith that moves down
[1:14:08] on the
[1:14:09] inside you see we are assured this is
[1:14:12] where John is writing by inspiration we
[1:14:15] know that we when he shall appear we
[1:14:17] shall be like him because right now we
[1:14:21] have the identification the same same
[1:14:24] experience that he
[1:14:26] had he is our he is our Elijah that
[1:14:30] threw back the robe of his Spirit back
[1:14:34] on us his same life that same spirit and
[1:14:38] and and the same life that lived and was
[1:14:43] reflected God's own life through that
[1:14:45] body through that life through that
[1:14:48] predestinated seed is the same life that
[1:14:51] comes back and reflects God's word and
[1:14:54] that's why the confidence that you and I
[1:14:56] can have we see the works that I do
[1:14:59] shall you do also it is the same life
[1:15:03] reproducing itself in a bride body in
[1:15:06] your life where a transformation has
[1:15:09] taken place it is the
[1:15:12] assurance that my body shall be
[1:15:17] changed Abraham is walking to Mariah
[1:15:21] Mount Mariah with assurance
[1:15:29] verse three and every man that hath this
[1:15:31] hope in
[1:15:33] him purifieth
[1:15:36] himself even as he is
[1:15:41] pure every man that has this hope this
[1:15:45] expectation that faith has set in your
[1:15:49] life every man that hath this hope in
[1:15:52] him purifieth himself even as he is
[1:15:57] pure
[1:15:59] this the wording in the
[1:16:03] scripture is not entailing as though
[1:16:07] this is something that we are doing on
[1:16:10] our
[1:16:11] own but the word term purifieth here it
[1:16:15] deals with the burnt offering it deals
[1:16:18] with an offering up of a life a
[1:16:21] surrendering of the life remember here
[1:16:24] that work that God has done even as he
[1:16:27] is pure even as he surrendered and
[1:16:30] yielded up his life even as he said I
[1:16:33] come not down from heaven to do my own
[1:16:35] will but the will of My Father which
[1:16:36] sent me his life Calvary was not just
[1:16:40] where he became an offering his life was
[1:16:44] an
[1:16:45] offering he surrendered his
[1:16:48] will when they tried to pull upon his
[1:16:52] feelings and his emotions he surrendered
[1:16:56] to the will of
[1:16:59] God this is where it's a purifying life
[1:17:02] a life that is that is offered up a life
[1:17:06] that has been
[1:17:08] raised by the quickening power of God
[1:17:11] into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:17:15] wherein we reflect that our life were're
[1:17:18] a delicate delegate of that New
[1:17:22] Jerusalem just like a represent is We
[1:17:25] Stand we sin from Ohio or the local
[1:17:28] communities and we sin to represent us
[1:17:33] we are we are delegates of that New
[1:17:38] Jerusalem our life the life that we live
[1:17:42] the life that's lived through us that
[1:17:45] life that appears before others it
[1:17:49] reflects our
[1:17:52] destiny how you live and conduct your
[1:17:55] life now shows your
[1:18:06] destiny
[1:18:12] Hallelujah Genesis 22:
[1:18:16] 2 God speaks to
[1:18:19] Abraham and just to move this part in
[1:18:23] here he says take now thy
[1:18:28] son thine only son
[1:18:30] Isaac whom thou
[1:18:34] lovest and go to mount Mariah and offer
[1:18:39] him there for a burnt
[1:18:46] offering Abraham had another
[1:18:50] son
[1:18:53] ishmail is is was also the one that
[1:18:56] remember when God is revealing himself
[1:19:00] as the almighty God in Genesis
[1:19:05] 17 and God and even when he
[1:19:09] says do not call your wife sari anymore
[1:19:14] call her
[1:19:17] Sarah remember Abraham
[1:19:21] himself he laughed and said
[1:19:25] shall
[1:19:27] she shall
[1:19:30] he but you see here in the midst of that
[1:19:34] of Genesis 17 here is where the word is
[1:19:37] going forth here is where God is
[1:19:39] revealing himself as elshad and remember
[1:19:41] in that moment this is where even
[1:19:43] Abraham says oh God that ishmail might
[1:19:46] live before
[1:19:49] you but you
[1:19:51] see even though ishma was also a son
[1:19:57] that Abraham
[1:19:59] fathered and you see in Genesis 17 where
[1:20:02] Abraham is also looking at himself but
[1:20:07] there's a
[1:20:08] transformation that takes place in
[1:20:11] Abraham's
[1:20:13] life Paul by inspiration picks up the
[1:20:18] effect of God revealing himself as the
[1:20:22] almighty God can't you see that the word
[1:20:25] itself sometimes when the word has its
[1:20:27] coming forth you and I can look at
[1:20:29] oursel but the word has a prevailing
[1:20:33] power within it that God's word it will
[1:20:36] not return back to him
[1:20:38] void it was God who moved on the scene
[1:20:42] it was God who brought that forth in
[1:20:45] Abraham's life when Abraham returns back
[1:20:48] into Camp he does not return back
[1:20:51] saying sari but he returns back into his
[1:20:55] Camp saying
[1:20:57] Sarah there's a there's a power within
[1:21:01] the word I I say it like this and we
[1:21:03] just yield to what to the word of God
[1:21:05] don't try to figure it out don't try to
[1:21:08] look and say how's this going to be
[1:21:10] you're a Seed of Abraham just believe
[1:21:12] what God has said he's big enough to
[1:21:15] back it up amen the Bible said he was
[1:21:19] fully persuaded that what he had said he
[1:21:23] was able to perform
[1:21:25] Abraham's Focus was not on what God had
[1:21:29] said so much as he was upon the one who
[1:21:32] said it because just to look at the
[1:21:35] letter alone it kth but the spirit
[1:21:39] giveth
[1:21:41] life oh glory be to God thine only
[1:21:46] son so God had a specific meaning here
[1:21:51] the son of the promised word is who I
[1:21:54] want
[1:21:55] ishmael's already been put out of the
[1:21:57] picture there's already been a
[1:21:59] separation the shock has already pulled
[1:22:02] away from the seed are you with me now
[1:22:06] the Sun that came by the faith of God
[1:22:09] moving down into Abraham's life and gave
[1:22:12] Abraham the necessary germ ishmael's out
[1:22:15] of the picture let me just say ishmail
[1:22:18] was what
[1:22:20] sari is slightly doubting
[1:22:25] just slightly
[1:22:27] doubting and
[1:22:30] ishmail
[1:22:31] ishmail you can never offer to God your
[1:22:36] own creation of
[1:22:39] Holiness well Lord I'm not doing this
[1:22:41] and Lord I do this and Lord I I help out
[1:22:44] I do this at the church or Lord I do
[1:22:46] this for people or I I give food baskets
[1:22:48] or Lord I do this or or I do that you
[1:22:51] can't offer God your creation of
[1:22:55] Holiness or homemade self-made
[1:23:00] righteousness outside of it being God's
[1:23:03] Own righteousness it's
[1:23:05] homemade it must be the creation of
[1:23:08] himself in
[1:23:10] you his spirit that comes on the inside
[1:23:13] to Quicken you see you're not of that
[1:23:16] Bond woman that that that seed that's on
[1:23:18] the
[1:23:19] inside that seed is not of the Bond
[1:23:22] woman
[1:23:24] this first birth the nature that
[1:23:27] controls this first Birth has to
[1:23:31] die God don't want to try to make him
[1:23:34] over God don't want to try to clean him
[1:23:36] up God's not trying to save that old man
[1:23:40] he wants to kill him that he can raise
[1:23:42] up that seed on the
[1:23:44] inside are you with me because anything
[1:23:47] else is an ishmail and God doesn't want
[1:23:50] ishma Ishmael can't go to mount Mariah
[1:23:53] Ishmael can't go in the the Rapture the
[1:23:55] son of the Bond woman will never ever
[1:23:58] take the
[1:24:01] Rapture there's got to be a
[1:24:04] death a new birth a new life you've been
[1:24:08] changing your own Nature has
[1:24:11] died and the new nature of God's own
[1:24:14] life is now flowing through that seed
[1:24:16] word that he swed in you and is raised
[1:24:19] up that's the part let me just say it
[1:24:21] like this that's the part of you that
[1:24:24] that's really
[1:24:25] him the part of you that's really him is
[1:24:28] that seed on the
[1:24:31] inside that's the part that he made the
[1:24:34] Covenant with when God told Abraham I
[1:24:38] will make my co my Covenant is with
[1:24:42] Isaac him will I make my Covenant I'll
[1:24:45] Bless
[1:24:46] ishmail yeah ishma be blessed he'll have
[1:24:49] children he'll do this and he'll do that
[1:24:52] but my Covenant is with Isaac
[1:24:55] this ishmail right here gets a lot of
[1:24:58] blessings this ishma he likes material
[1:25:02] things this Ishmael receives those
[1:25:06] things of material but the real Isaac on
[1:25:10] the
[1:25:11] inside the real blessing that he
[1:25:14] receives is The Blessing of
[1:25:16] Abraham it's the real that's that's the
[1:25:19] that's the real reality the Holy
[1:25:22] Ghost that's that part of the the
[1:25:24] contract the Covenant that comes down
[1:25:28] you see the scripture let me just refer
[1:25:30] you to a few places this is why Paul
[1:25:32] would
[1:25:34] say in the offering up of our life that
[1:25:36] you would present your bodies a Living
[1:25:40] Sacrifice notice how Paul presents this
[1:25:42] in in Romans
[1:25:44] 12 holy acceptable unto God which is
[1:25:48] your reasonable service notice ye
[1:25:50] present your bodies you have control
[1:25:53] over your life
[1:25:56] because
[1:25:58] Christ you have been birthed into him
[1:26:03] it's his spirit in you that's directing
[1:26:06] you as a son and daughter of God you now
[1:26:10] have control it's a spirit of
[1:26:12] righteousness that guides and directs
[1:26:14] and brings this body into
[1:26:17] subjection it's the spirit of Christ
[1:26:20] within us that says no I'm not I'm not
[1:26:23] going to allow ow those thoughts to
[1:26:26] remain I'm not going to how hold those
[1:26:29] feelings I'm not going to it takes a
[1:26:31] discernment it takes the the the
[1:26:33] quickening power of God on the inside
[1:26:36] because this is still the sticky part
[1:26:40] but this is where he says You must
[1:26:42] present that you would present your
[1:26:46] bodies a Living
[1:26:48] Sacrifice not conformed to this
[1:26:52] world but transformed
[1:26:55] by the renewing of your mind now it's
[1:26:56] not talking about the matter here it's
[1:26:59] not even talking about this the just the
[1:27:02] the spirit the human spirit is talking
[1:27:05] about the
[1:27:07] soul the nature a
[1:27:11] transformation that you might
[1:27:14] prove declare show forth what is that
[1:27:17] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:27:20] God you see this is why when when the
[1:27:23] Bible says behold what manner of love he
[1:27:26] hath bestowed upon us to call us the
[1:27:28] sons of God you see God calls you what
[1:27:31] you
[1:27:33] are you can go a long time before you
[1:27:36] recognize it and surrender to it and
[1:27:39] believe what he is
[1:27:40] saying but
[1:27:42] nonetheless it takes one of your own
[1:27:45] kind to tell you who you
[1:27:48] are this is why Paul would say even in
[1:27:52] Romans 15
[1:27:54] verse 16 that I should be the minister
[1:27:56] of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles
[1:27:58] ministering the gospel of God that the
[1:28:00] offering up of the Gentiles might be
[1:28:02] acceptable being Sanctified by the Holy
[1:28:06] Ghost this is the this is the only way
[1:28:09] that the offering up of the Gentiles
[1:28:11] that the Rapture this is the only
[1:28:15] way to be a part of the body of Jesus
[1:28:18] Christ is there was a seed laying there
[1:28:22] within you all along
[1:28:25] and the Holy Spirit seeks you out and
[1:28:30] brings you to
[1:28:35] himself that then through his life you
[1:28:38] might the offering up the giving of your
[1:28:41] life might become acceptable our
[1:28:44] life everything that
[1:28:46] we we could try to do it must be under
[1:28:51] the direction of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:56] this is why Peter would say in 1 Peter
[1:28:58] 2:5 as Lively Stones you build up a
[1:29:01] spiritual House of holy priesthood to
[1:29:03] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:29:07] to God by Jesus
[1:29:10] Christ there's only one only only one
[1:29:13] way only one place of acceptance that's
[1:29:16] in
[1:29:19] him you see Abraham let me just try to
[1:29:22] bring this down to
[1:29:26] close Abraham was
[1:29:29] expecting the
[1:29:33] supernatural
[1:29:35] every every experience that he had had
[1:29:39] led up to this
[1:29:41] time but
[1:29:43] remember he was walking to mount
[1:29:47] Mariah with the
[1:29:49] experience that brought a change in his
[1:29:52] body he was walking to mount
[1:29:55] Mariah with a transformation that had
[1:29:58] come where the promised son of what the
[1:30:02] word had spoke he was walking there with
[1:30:07] this living
[1:30:11] reality you see the Bible
[1:30:15] says in Hebrews
[1:30:20] 11:17 by faith when he was tried he
[1:30:22] offered up Isaac and he that received
[1:30:25] the promises offered up his
[1:30:28] only begotten
[1:30:31] son of whom it was said that in Isaac
[1:30:35] shall thy seed be called
[1:30:38] accounting that God was able to raise
[1:30:41] him up even from the dead from whence
[1:30:43] also he received him in a
[1:30:48] figure he accounted he thought he laid
[1:30:51] it to God's account this is something
[1:30:54] this word accounting here this word
[1:30:57] deals with reality let me read it to you
[1:31:01] it is this this word it means that if I
[1:31:04] reckon that my bank book has $25 in it
[1:31:09] it has $25 in it otherwise I am
[1:31:15] deceiving
[1:31:16] myself this word refers to facts not
[1:31:21] suppositions
[1:31:24] Abraham was
[1:31:26] walking not with an
[1:31:29] imagination he had a living
[1:31:33] experience the supernatural was right
[1:31:36] there with
[1:31:37] him I am the lad will go Yonder and
[1:31:41] worship and we will come
[1:31:44] again this was not an imagination Isaac
[1:31:48] was right
[1:31:50] there Abraham could look at him
[1:31:54] each time no doubt through this journey
[1:31:56] remember it was three
[1:31:59] days no doubt even as the journey would
[1:32:03] go on Abraham the Bible says he
[1:32:06] accounted that God was able to raise him
[1:32:08] from the dead because he had received
[1:32:10] him from the
[1:32:11] dead and so what was he resting
[1:32:14] in what was he resting in notice brother
[1:32:18] Ram would saying like this he said God
[1:32:21] took away even the
[1:32:24] hope that was there that you'll be the
[1:32:27] father of Nations this one in whom that
[1:32:31] God had promised but Abraham said
[1:32:33] brother BR dramatizing it he said
[1:32:36] Abraham saying oh my yeah hope is gone
[1:32:41] but I still have the word I still have
[1:32:44] the word Abraham journeyed to mount
[1:32:47] mariia on the word of the Lord it was
[1:32:51] real to him Abraham how is this going to
[1:32:54] happen I don't
[1:32:55] know how is your body going to be Chang
[1:32:58] I don't know how is the rapture going to
[1:33:01] be I don't know but I know he's already
[1:33:06] spoke it so shall it
[1:33:10] be it was a reality it was what Abraham
[1:33:14] was resting
[1:33:17] in let me just say it like this
[1:33:25] let me just read this to you in closing
[1:33:27] this is out of the patriarch Abraham I
[1:33:30] love this
[1:33:33] quote the BR says after Isaac had come
[1:33:35] on the
[1:33:36] scene we found out we find out that God
[1:33:39] gave him a double
[1:33:42] test after now being 115 years old or 20
[1:33:47] Abraham was he said I want you to take
[1:33:49] this your only son take him up the
[1:33:51] mountain that I will show you and there
[1:33:54] offer him up on this mountain for a
[1:33:56] sacrifice in other words destroy every
[1:34:01] evidence that he had that the promise
[1:34:04] would be
[1:34:05] fulfilled that's taking away all the
[1:34:09] natural
[1:34:11] things God allowed every bit in this and
[1:34:14] this right here reasoning can't even
[1:34:19] stand reasoning has tried to come on
[1:34:22] reasoning brought an ishman
[1:34:26] Sarah even standing there looking at her
[1:34:28] own condition
[1:34:31] reasoned but then it was that faith that
[1:34:35] God had revealed there to Abraham Sarah
[1:34:39] was United with that same faith and that
[1:34:41] faith it transformed her life and in
[1:34:45] this moment journeying to that place all
[1:34:48] natural things
[1:34:50] feeding where where you cannot rest
[1:34:52] there's nothing in the natural that you
[1:34:55] can rest upon let me just tell you
[1:34:58] something this in itself there's already
[1:35:01] been raptures that's been before us
[1:35:04] there was an Enoch he walked with God
[1:35:07] and had a testimony that he pleased
[1:35:10] God Amen there was a an Elijah that was
[1:35:14] translated Jesus was caught up with the
[1:35:17] Old Testament Saints is that right so
[1:35:20] you see there's already been but
[1:35:22] remember there there's not one thing
[1:35:25] that you and I can do to produce this
[1:35:28] Rapture it is solemnly in the hands of
[1:35:31] almighty God and I say in the name of
[1:35:34] the Lord be sure that you are in his
[1:35:39] hands because it is he
[1:35:44] alone that brings forth the
[1:35:49] Rapture it's not a
[1:35:51] church it's not a man
[1:35:55] that whole unfolding of the Rapture is
[1:35:58] even taking place there's a gathering
[1:36:01] that's already went been going on with a
[1:36:04] shout the message that God has sent it's
[1:36:07] been Gathering us in Christ the shout
[1:36:10] the living bread of life get under the
[1:36:12] blood get under it get the token be born
[1:36:16] again living bread of life get in Christ
[1:36:19] get in the chosen place of worship
[1:36:23] takes away all the natural
[1:36:28] things and Abraham
[1:36:31] said I received him as one from the
[1:36:36] dead and I'm fully
[1:36:39] persuaded that he is able to raise him
[1:36:43] up from the dead listen to this that's
[1:36:46] the people now the Seed of Abraham
[1:36:50] because he raised us from the dead
[1:36:54] we were dead in sin and
[1:36:56] trespasses and he who was able to change
[1:36:59] my mind change my thoughts change my
[1:37:02] nature change me all over he can do as
[1:37:05] he pleases whatever he says I believe
[1:37:08] it's the truth and every Seed of Abraham
[1:37:11] believes the same thing so how is the
[1:37:15] Seed of Abraham journeying into the
[1:37:18] promise of God by receiving the promise
[1:37:22] of this hour by receiving the
[1:37:25] transformation in that life the New
[1:37:27] Birth the token where you know I once
[1:37:30] was dead but now I am alive the love of
[1:37:34] the world has fled from my life and it's
[1:37:37] the love of the father that pulsates in
[1:37:39] my life I am not an old creation made
[1:37:43] over it is a new creation in Christ
[1:37:46] Jesus Abraham how are you going to mount
[1:37:50] Mariah I'm going there with my own only
[1:37:54] son your only son yes the one whom God
[1:37:59] has brought forth through my life how
[1:38:02] are you going in the Rapture what is it
[1:38:04] that is going to be raptured it's the
[1:38:06] character that image that is of Christ
[1:38:10] on the inside and that that very
[1:38:13] rapturing of that life then what will
[1:38:15] God do there will be a transformation of
[1:38:19] the atoms of this bodies for those who
[1:38:22] are Li and remain shall not hinder or
[1:38:27] prevent they in that other dimension
[1:38:30] will break forth they have went on they
[1:38:34] have entered into their theophany they
[1:38:36] are there waiting on us they're waiting
[1:38:38] on the finishing up of the climax they
[1:38:42] themselves have went on and made up that
[1:38:44] part of the bride and they are waiting
[1:38:46] they are longing for that time and the
[1:38:48] Earth is groaning and travailing and
[1:38:51] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:38:54] sons of God they will break forth from
[1:38:57] that
[1:39:01] realm and they come and as they
[1:39:04] appear we'll know our changes on its
[1:39:13] way they'll receive their glorified
[1:39:17] body our body will be changed and we'll
[1:39:19] go to meet our theophany
[1:39:24] so how are we journeying how are we
[1:39:30] going I
[1:39:32] wonder as Abraham would
[1:39:36] go and reach
[1:39:39] over grab a hold of
[1:39:42] Isaac how did Abraham encourage
[1:39:47] himself he would look and
[1:39:51] say God you raised him from the
[1:39:54] dead there wasn't an ounce of hope that
[1:39:57] I had Sarah or me there was no
[1:40:02] hope but this this is a miracle he could
[1:40:06] see the miracle in his own body and he
[1:40:10] could see this
[1:40:12] miracle where was his
[1:40:15] encouragement the same way our
[1:40:17] encouragement is in this hour you cannot
[1:40:20] rest or take hope in anything else out
[1:40:23] here you can't even take rest and hope
[1:40:27] and you know with some predictions here
[1:40:29] or there but the real place of our joy
[1:40:32] our Isaac our laughter our
[1:40:35] rejoicing is in the work that God has
[1:40:39] done inside of our
[1:40:41] life that's our real joy that is the joy
[1:40:46] of the believer that's the joy that no
[1:40:49] man can take from us that's a joy that's
[1:40:53] lasting it's real I tell you this
[1:40:57] journey it behooves each and every
[1:41:00] one to check up and be sure be very
[1:41:05] sure and those that are sure what an
[1:41:10] assurance where you have the testimony
[1:41:12] as Paul said the life that I now
[1:41:16] live not I that liveth it's Christ that
[1:41:21] liveth in me
[1:41:24] that's our joy that's our
[1:41:28] rest that is the supernatural work of
[1:41:32] almighty
[1:41:34] God or we have a confidence that our
[1:41:38] future is
[1:41:41] clear
[1:41:42] past there is no more
[1:41:45] past it's been not just cut
[1:41:49] off but that old nature that one that
[1:41:52] used to live here
[1:41:56] is submitted come in to the place to
[1:41:58] where
[1:41:59] God moves to kill him that the man on
[1:42:04] the inside that seed might come
[1:42:09] forth I encourage
[1:42:12] you as we walk in this time in this hour
[1:42:16] this is to be our Focus this is our joy
[1:42:20] this is our strength and if you don't
[1:42:22] have that Joy let me just tell you I
[1:42:24] just I give you a real straight warning
[1:42:26] don't try to present to God an
[1:42:29] ishmail God won't accept it God won't
[1:42:32] accept your works well I do this for you
[1:42:35] Lord or I do that God don't want your
[1:42:39] ishmail the only thing God wants to do
[1:42:41] is kill him so that Isaac can come
[1:42:45] forth because your righteousness my
[1:42:48] righteousness is filthy rags
[1:42:54] any Holiness outside of it being God's
[1:42:57] holy Life coming through God does not
[1:43:00] accept if you're in Journey right now in
[1:43:03] your life and don't just say I'm in
[1:43:06] Journey and you you sit around in the
[1:43:08] same place you've always been setting
[1:43:10] for years you're not in Journey you
[1:43:12] become complacent you become laxed

[1:43:17] to be moving you've got to go on to the
[1:43:20] promise go to that place to where you
[1:43:22] become United with Jesus Christ to where
[1:43:26] now you are united with the circumcision
[1:43:28] of the Holy Ghost to where you're in the
[1:43:31] Covenant with him and every promise in
[1:43:33] him becomes yay and amen this is a place
[1:43:37] that we journey
[1:43:39] journey to know the god that raised
[1:43:44] up changed my life the God who changed
[1:43:48] me I couldn't change myself the God who
[1:43:52] brought the change in my life is the
[1:43:54] same God that will change my body how's
[1:43:57] it going to be I don't know that is not
