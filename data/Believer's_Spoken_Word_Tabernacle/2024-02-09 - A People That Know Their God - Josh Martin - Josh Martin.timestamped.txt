[34:48] your wife because if you have nobody to
[34:50] talk to you can always talk to your wife
[34:52] and so it's it's such a blessing having
[34:54] her travel with me I know it's a
[34:56] sacrifice especially with with two
[34:58] children and and a toddler Ethan is full
[35:00] of energy but it's it's so good to have
[35:03] them with me tonight um Daniel
[35:06] 11:32 the Bible would say and such as do
[35:09] wickedly against the Covenant and shall
[35:11] he corrupt by flatteries but the people
[35:14] that do know their God shall be strong
[35:17] and do exploits are you thankful for
[35:19] that this evening can we B our heads
[35:21] tonight dear heavenly father Lord what
[35:23] an honor it is to come into your house
[35:25] Lord God as we feel your presence
[35:27] Drawing Near to us Lord you promised
[35:29] where two or three are gathered in your
[35:31] name you wouldd be in our midst father
[35:34] and Lord we feel you here tonight father
[35:36] we've made your welcome Lord we we've
[35:38] sang songs of worship Lord to to create
[35:40] an atmosphere for your word to fall in
[35:43] Father Lord as we submit oursel to you I
[35:46] ask that you would speak through this
[35:47] vessel father Lord you placed a gift in
[35:50] my life Lord and I give it back to you
[35:52] father you see the needs that are in
[35:54] this building Lord that can only be met
[35:55] by you father Lord we need the
[35:58] supernatural tonight to walk the aisles
[36:00] and touch the hearts Lord Lord we lay
[36:02] the service into your hands we ask these
[36:04] things in your precious name amen you
[36:07] may be seated tonight and if I had a
[36:09] subject it would be a people that know
[36:11] their God and we know brother brandom
[36:14] would place this scripture at the end
[36:16] time and he would say this here and all
[36:18] that Daniel said about the last days and
[36:21] how that they that know their God will
[36:23] do exploits and just so many scriptures
[36:25] tying in this day
[36:27] that we're living in how that these time
[36:29] that these are evil times deceiving
[36:31] times would be on the earth and just
[36:34] exactly what we're having now fulfills
[36:36] it and they that had been given a chance
[36:39] to seek him but they rejected the very
[36:42] Messiah and today it's the same thing
[36:44] the very same thing we are given the
[36:47] opportunity then brother Brandon would
[36:49] say in in another place Daniel said in
[36:51] that day they run to and fro knowledge
[36:53] shall increase and he said the wise
[36:55] shall know their God and in that day
[36:57] they shall do they shall do great
[36:59] exploits in that day but the wicked will
[37:02] not know the god of Heaven they know him
[37:04] in a form or in a ritual and I think my
[37:07] knowing him in a form or a ritual ain't
[37:10] the realities of God I believe just
[37:12] coming to church is fine but we need to
[37:14] come to a reality and I believe that the
[37:17] message has brought a reality to us
[37:20] where it's no longer just a duty it's no
[37:22] longer just scriptures or quotes but
[37:24] it's a reality that is a on the inside
[37:28] of the Believers and brother Brandon
[37:29] would say and I think today we have much
[37:32] fine preaching many fine ministers able
[37:34] ministers that has brought the word and
[37:36] your pastors and the evangelists and so
[37:39] forth that comes through the city but I
[37:41] think the main thing that I'm trying to
[37:43] bring to you is the reality of the
[37:45] presence of Christ that you might see
[37:48] him and know that it's him by his
[37:51] identified promise for today so we got
[37:54] to identify where he's at we got to
[37:56] identify and how we identify him is by
[37:59] scripture and I believe this message is
[38:02] so backed up by scripture that we can
[38:04] identify him for today not a god of
[38:07] yesterday but a god of today not
[38:09] promises made for yesterday but promises
[38:12] made for today so the Bible would tell
[38:15] us there were two different people and
[38:17] what's going to separate the two people
[38:19] is knowing their God the world has been
[38:22] given a chance to see him but they have
[38:24] rejected him but on the other hand
[38:27] there's a group that's been
[38:28] predestinated not to reject him but to
[38:31] see him so I believe the Bible is
[38:33] talking about a literal people coming in
[38:36] contact with the literal God and
[38:38] Performing literal exploits literal
[38:41] signs and wonders but I don't believe
[38:43] it's a random people but it's a chosen
[38:46] people that has been been predestinated
[38:48] to see the things of God because if you
[38:51] wasn't predestinated to see it you would
[38:53] have rejected it as well you know
[38:55] brother Brandon m the only ones that can
[38:57] see it is the one who was predestinated
[39:00] to see it or otherwise you'll never see
[39:03] it the Jews could not see that being
[39:05] their Messiah and yet they were Scholars
[39:08] theologians men of great renowned
[39:10] scholarship read the Bible that you read
[39:13] now after all it's been made known to us
[39:15] we see a plain that it was the Messiah
[39:18] but they couldn't see it neither can
[39:20] they see it today and that just struck
[39:22] me when I read that that it's obvious
[39:25] that Christ was the Messiah it was God
[39:27] made flesh but without it being revealed
[39:30] they couldn't see it he come to his own
[39:32] and his own received him not oh my but
[39:34] as many that were ordained to eternal
[39:37] life believed oh I believe we're not
[39:39] just here by accident but we've been
[39:41] brought here for a purpose and with
[39:44] something on the inside to identify
[39:47] scripture for this generation and so
[39:50] that's why this people is a
[39:51] predestinated people without being
[39:54] predestinated you'll never identif Iden
[39:56] ify it but being predestinated you can't
[39:59] help but identify it you know and as you
[40:02] look upon the message of the hour many
[40:04] are turning away and saying it's a false
[40:06] prophet a false prophecy a false uh he's
[40:10] a liar and he's a deceiver they can't
[40:12] help but not see it but at the same time
[40:15] we can't help but see it we've been
[40:17] predestinated to see what God has in
[40:20] this generation and brother Brandon
[40:22] would saying notice God when he called
[40:24] Abraham he didn't say Abra
[40:26] if you will do a certain thing I will do
[40:29] a certain thing he said Abraham I have
[40:31] already done it not what you did what I
[40:34] did what God did he said now when he
[40:36] made a covenant with Adam if you'll not
[40:39] touch the tree you'll live forever Adam
[40:41] broke it Moses and them if you keep the
[40:43] Commandments I'll do so so and so if you
[40:46] break the Commandments I'll do so and so
[40:48] when God makes a covenant with man man
[40:51] breaks his Covenant with God but I love
[40:53] this part right here but so that the
[40:55] elected the church the elected people
[40:58] the called out separated group of people
[41:01] which sure to be saved God called them
[41:04] by Grace oh my so it's Grace that we are
[41:07] saved not what we know not what we we
[41:10] can do but we're predestinated called by
[41:13] Grace so that we can't help but see it
[41:16] in this generation everybody is trying
[41:18] to be the people everybody wants to be
[41:21] the people they want to do the
[41:22] supernatural they want to do the they
[41:25] want to live a life but they haven't
[41:26] been called to it everybody claims to be
[41:29] the bride we're the church we're the
[41:31] we're the ones God has called but
[41:33] there's only one group that is the bride
[41:35] of Christ that is the ones that is
[41:37] called by his grace oh Hallelujah the
[41:40] Bible would say you have not chosen me
[41:43] but I have chosen you we didn't choose
[41:46] God but he chose you when you was
[41:48] running from the grace of God he chose
[41:50] you when you was running from the things
[41:52] of God he chose you when you was on a
[41:55] bar store he chose you when you was in
[41:57] pornography he chose you and there's
[42:00] nothing you can do that can outrun the
[42:02] grace of God if you're called for this
[42:05] generation you can outrun the grace of
[42:08] God oh Hallelujah you have not chosen me
[42:12] when there was no desire for my things I
[42:14] chose you when you turned away from the
[42:17] message I still chose you oh and I say
[42:20] if there's doubts concerning this
[42:21] message you're still Chosen and just
[42:24] wait there's a revelation coming for you
[42:26] don't give up on the Revelation if
[42:29] you're elected to it you can't help but
[42:31] see it oh Hallelujah but look at the
[42:35] grace of God when we was unable to
[42:37] choose God he chose us whenever we was
[42:40] unable to go to God he come to us oh
[42:43] Hallelujah you can look at Peter he was
[42:45] unable to choose Christ before the car
[42:48] Crow twice but God still chose him and I
[42:51] think that is so amazing but Christ even
[42:53] told Peter you're going to deny me and
[42:56] he says no Lord I'm not going to deny
[42:58] you I'll stand for you I'll go to the
[43:00] very end I'll stand for you but in the
[43:03] time of pressure the pressure got to him
[43:06] and he denied him he cursed but when
[43:08] Jesus resurrected again he says go tell
[43:11] my disciples don't forget about Peter go
[43:14] tell my disciples and tell Peter the
[43:17] grace is still calling his name oh this
[43:20] evening you might feel like you're in
[43:22] the dumps but Grace is calling your name
[43:24] you might feel like it complete failure
[43:27] but Grace is calling your name saying I
[43:30] haven't forgotten you I haven't forsaken
[43:32] you you might have failed me yesterday
[43:34] but the grace of God is still calling
[43:36] you oh it was Jesus saying Peter I'm I'm
[43:41] I'm being identified by scripture my
[43:44] grace is letting you know I'm here
[43:46] fulfilling scripture oh and it's the
[43:49] grace of God that is telling us in this
[43:52] generation that we're fulfilling
[43:54] scripture oh hallelujah it's only by the
[43:56] grace of God and it is so what amazes me
[44:00] about the scripture the Bible would say
[44:02] in John 15- 16 you have not chosen me
[44:06] but I have chosen you and ordained you
[44:09] that you should go forth and bring forth
[44:11] much fruit and that your fruit should
[44:14] remain and he's letting the letting us
[44:16] know that we're not just going to have
[44:18] fruit today and lose it tomorrow but he
[44:21] ordained us to have fruit and that our
[44:23] fruit should remain and you see the word
[44:26] ordains means to appoint to set so God
[44:30] didn't just choose us just to choose us
[44:33] but he chose us so that we can be
[44:35] appointed with good works oh you see we
[44:38] wasn't just saved to sit on pews we
[44:40] wasn't just saved to be a Christian on
[44:43] Thursday nights and on Sunday mornings
[44:45] but we was appointed to have good works
[44:48] every day of the week we know that we're
[44:50] not saved by our works we're not saved
[44:53] by our actions but if we are saved it's
[44:56] going to produce such a life that we've
[44:59] been predestinated to to fulfill and
[45:02] that your fruit should remain and you
[45:04] notice right after he says that he says
[45:07] though whatsoever you shall ask of my of
[45:10] the father in my name he may give it to
[45:12] you and so he's letting you know that
[45:15] the third pole ain't the only exploits
[45:18] the exploits ain't just you speaking the
[45:20] word but the exploits is you're living
[45:22] the word he's letting you know don't be
[45:24] so worried about the spoken word and
[45:27] that's fine that comes with it don't be
[45:29] trying to do Miracles and do this but
[45:32] live the word first then once there's
[45:34] fruits that is remaining then you're
[45:36] going to ask oh Hallelujah and I say
[45:39] Lord I'm a bright I'm the people that
[45:42] you called for this generation that has
[45:44] a life I have the fruits of the spirit
[45:47] the message ain't just in a book The
[45:49] Message ain't just in a tape but the
[45:51] message has come on the inside and the
[45:54] fruits of the message message is
[45:56] manifesting itself in my life not just
[46:00] today but it's remaining oh when I wake
[46:03] up in a bad mood the fruits remain oh
[46:06] when I wake up on the wrong side of the
[46:07] bed the life of the word is still on the
[46:10] inside and that whatsoever you shall ask
[46:14] oh Hallelujah you should go forth and
[46:16] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[46:19] should remain that whatsoever you shall
[46:21] ask in my name don't be worried about
[46:24] this get the fruits from first then it
[46:27] will produce the word it will produce
[46:29] the spoken word hallelujah and so it's
[46:33] it's Grace that has chose us to live a
[46:35] life not just a life but it chose us to
[46:38] be a Powerhouse oh Hallelujah and you
[46:41] see he he links the two together
[46:44] exploits ain't just a spoken word but
[46:46] exploits is a life many people put the
[46:49] life on the back shelf until Sunday
[46:51] mornings then they pick the life back up
[46:54] and they put it on and they say Lord how
[46:56] come I'm not overcoming how come I my
[46:59] family ain't in Revival you put the
[47:01] fruits on the shelf and trying to put on
[47:04] the supernatural but you need a life
[47:06] first then once the life is on the
[47:09] inside it will produce it Hallelujah sir
[47:12] the Bible is saying in Ephesians 2 and8
[47:15] for by grace are you saved through faith
[47:18] but not of yourself it is the gift of
[47:20] God not of Works L any man shall boast
[47:23] for we are his workmanship created in
[47:26] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[47:29] hath before ordained that we should walk
[47:32] in them walking what brother Josh good
[47:36] works he's saying here it's not works
[47:39] that we're saved but it's because of
[47:41] Grace that we can produce the life it's
[47:44] only the grace of God that we can live a
[47:46] life every day the church World wants to
[47:49] live and overcoming life but there's
[47:51] nothing to produce it but because of
[47:53] Grace We're saved and can produce good
[47:57] works and walk in them oh Hallelujah so
[48:00] we're not just saved by grace to fill up
[48:03] you but we're saved by grace to express
[48:06] the life of God and if we ever get that
[48:08] Revelation we'll look at Christianity in
[48:11] a whole different view Christianity
[48:14] ain't just something that we claim what
[48:16] what what brother brandom say being
[48:18] being a Christian is to be Christlike so
[48:20] we're not just claiming the life of
[48:23] Christianity but the Life of Christ has
[48:25] claimed us to be a workmanship and to
[48:28] perform the works that he has called us
[48:31] to perform the Bible would tell us in
[48:33] First Peter 2 and9 but ye are a chosen
[48:36] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[48:39] nation A peculiar people that you should
[48:42] show forth the Praises of him who ha
[48:45] called you out of Darkness into
[48:47] Marvelous Light and I like how how scofi
[48:50] scoffield puts it he says that you
[48:52] should show forth the Praises of him who
[48:55] had called us and he describes Praises
[48:57] as virtues as excellencies so the one
[49:01] that has called us has called us to
[49:03] express the virtues of God oh Hallelujah
[49:07] the attributes that was once in the mind
[49:10] of God is now being expressed in the
[49:13] people that he has called out of
[49:15] Darkness into marvelous light oh
[49:18] Hallelujah you're one Earth more than
[49:20] just to sit on a Pew you are God's
[49:22] Powerhouse you are God's body upon this
[49:25] Earth you're the expression of the life
[49:28] of God in this generation oh it's no
[49:31] longer a one man Ministry but it's a
[49:33] multi member Ministry upon the Earth the
[49:36] same life that was in Jesus Christ is in
[49:39] the body of Jesus Christ expressing the
[49:43] virtues oh it's the virtues inside of
[49:46] the body but the Brandon would say the
[49:48] True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is
[49:51] likened to pure gold her righteousness
[49:54] is his righteousness her ATT her
[49:57] attributes are his own glorious
[49:59] attributes her identity is found in him
[50:03] what he is she is to reflect oh
[50:06] hallelujah we're just a reflection you
[50:09] know brother brandom talks about the
[50:10] morning dew he says you look at the Dew
[50:12] and it's sparkling and you wonder how is
[50:14] it sparkling it's not the de doing it
[50:17] it's the sun just reflecting it through
[50:20] the de oh Hallelujah and you can ask how
[50:24] come there's a bride on Earth without
[50:26] spot and without wrinkle it's not her
[50:28] ability she's just called by Grace
[50:31] coming under the word of this generation
[50:34] and is expressing the attributes of God
[50:38] oh remember the bubbling brook we have
[50:40] the privilege of seeing it some years
[50:42] back where the brandom talked about the
[50:44] bubbling brook he says you can go by the
[50:46] Brook Any Time of the Season any time of
[50:49] the year and it's always bubbling and
[50:51] you could ask it what makes you bubble
[50:53] is it because the deer drink from you no
[50:55] sir is it because I drink from you no
[50:57] it's not because of you and he would ask
[50:59] it how come you're always so bubbly he
[51:02] says it's not me there's something on
[51:04] the downside that is pushing it up oh
[51:08] hallelujah it's not you trying to
[51:10] perform the Greater Works it's the word
[51:13] inside performing the Greater Works oh
[51:17] come on now the Greater Works wasn't for
[51:19] brother brandom it's for you you are the
[51:21] Greater Works you are the the exploits
[51:25] of
[51:25] in this
[51:27] generation Hallelujah but the brandom
[51:30] continues on to say what he what he is
[51:32] she is to reflect what he has she is to
[51:36] manifest oh what he has she's to
[51:39] manifest so no longer is the Christ
[51:42] manifesting The Works of God but what he
[51:45] had there's another Temple now
[51:47] reflecting it so that means if you get
[51:50] out of step and out of your out of your
[51:52] position who's going to reflect it now
[51:56] oh come on now who's going to reflect
[51:58] the Life of Christ if you don't reflect
[52:00] it what if the moon know decid to not to
[52:03] shine who's going to reflect the light
[52:05] in the dark times but the brandom T
[52:07] types the Bride As the moon he says the
[52:10] moon only reflects what the sun is but
[52:12] if the Earth gets in the way of the Moon
[52:15] and the Sun then it becomes a blackout
[52:18] oh Hallelujah it doesn't mean that the
[52:20] that the son has lost his light it just
[52:23] means the world is in the way oh I'm
[52:25] preaching now and whenever you get in in
[52:28] a discouraging time don't put the
[52:30] worldly things in front of the light of
[52:33] the word when you're discouraged that's
[52:35] the time to get in the message when
[52:37] you're when you're tired that's the time
[52:40] to get in the tapes don't grab oh
[52:42] Hallelujah don't grab worldly pleasures
[52:45] and place it in front of the light
[52:47] because you're going to get darker and
[52:49] darker and darker but I say maybe you're
[52:52] dark this evening but the light of his
[52:54] word is here and preached to pull you
[52:56] out of Darkness so that you can shine
[52:59] forth the virtues of the one who has
[53:02] called you amen
[53:04] hallelujah oh Hallelujah brother Brown
[53:07] would say in that in that same quote
[53:09] there there was found no fault in her
[53:11] she is all glorious within and without
[53:14] from beginning to ending she is the work
[53:17] of her Lord all his works are perfect in
[53:20] fact in her is summed up all the
[53:23] manifested Eternal wisdom and purpose of
[53:26] God he says how can one fathom it how
[53:29] can one understand it though we cannot
[53:32] do that we accept it by faith for God
[53:34] hath spoken it oh we might not
[53:37] understand we might not understand how
[53:39] there's a Rapture but it might be far
[53:42] out there in our mind but we accept it
[53:44] by faith oh brother Brandon would say if
[53:47] we could understand God by reasoning
[53:49] what's what's good and what why do we
[53:50] need Faith but we understand God by
[53:53] faith we understand d The Rapture by
[53:56] faith that's why we needed a message
[53:59] that's why we needed a message we will
[54:02] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[54:05] word the word of God not an opinion not
[54:08] a Doctrine not an idea but the true
[54:10] unadulterated word is to produce a faith
[54:14] that can see the realities of God you
[54:17] know brother brandom says there's no
[54:19] realities without faith oh the only way
[54:22] you can see the realities of the super
[54:25] natural is by faith that's why we needed
[54:28] a message to restore the faith back to
[54:31] the original so that we can rise up and
[54:33] see what God is doing in this generation
[54:36] the Bible would say in in Ephesians 1:4
[54:39] according as Heath chosen Us in him
[54:42] before the foundation of the world that
[54:45] we should be holy and Without Blame
[54:47] before him in love and that just spoke
[54:50] to me he he he didn't just choose this
[54:53] but he chose us to be holy and Without
[54:56] Blame before him any of you ever thought
[54:59] about that he's the allseeing God he
[55:01] sees in every circumstance he sees in
[55:04] every situation he sees in every hidden
[55:06] agenda but because we're called and
[55:09] chosen we stand before him blameless you
[55:12] ever think about that we stand before
[55:15] him holy and Without Blame and I think
[55:18] my goodness W you see the power of your
[55:21] calling because you're called there's no
[55:24] sin to your account because you're
[55:26] called there's no addiction that he can
[55:29] remember you see predestination ain't
[55:31] just a Doctrine predestination a reality
[55:35] that God saw me before the foundation of
[55:38] the world that's why I can stand here
[55:40] today blameless I stand blameless
[55:44] because I'm predestinated I stand filled
[55:47] with the Holy Ghost because I'm
[55:50] predestinated oh predestination now many
[55:52] people take it as a crutch and say
[55:55] because I'm predestinated I can do what
[55:57] I want no sir it's because you're
[55:59] predestinated you're wanting to get away
[56:02] from those
[56:03] things hey if you're using
[56:05] predestination as a crutch you've got
[56:07] your Doctrine all messed up and you
[56:09] might not be predestinated but it's
[56:11] because you're predestinated you say
[56:13] Lord I'm not happy here I'm not happy
[56:16] I'm called for another purpose yes sir
[56:19] oh Hallelujah you realize you're called
[56:21] for another purpose you realize it was
[56:24] the prodical son the Bible says he come
[56:26] to himself you ever notice that he came
[56:29] to himself and said my father's servants
[56:33] have a better than what I have it it
[56:35] wasn't somebody coming and saying hey
[56:37] you're a son he knew he was a son all
[56:39] along but it was hidden under the Fallen
[56:42] nature oh come on now it was hidden
[56:45] under his Fallen state but Grace showed
[56:48] up one day grace showed up one day and
[56:51] brought him to himself and he said my
[56:53] goodness this ain't my condition I'm
[56:55] called to be in I'm called for another
[56:58] purpose I'm called for another identity
[57:01] but because of the Fallen State he put
[57:04] his identity on the back burner but
[57:06] because of Grace he said my father my my
[57:09] father's servants have a better than
[57:11] what I've got it and could you imagine
[57:14] that he's rehearsing he's rehearsing his
[57:16] speech he's coming up okay I'm going to
[57:18] tell my father I'm not worthy to be
[57:20] called your son I'm not worthy to be
[57:22] called your son I'm not worthy let me be
[57:24] a Serv let me be a servant and as he has
[57:27] his head down there's the father there's
[57:29] Grace just waiting on him to come back
[57:33] to where he fell from Hallelujah and
[57:36] what happened he come before the father
[57:38] and said father I'm not worthy to be
[57:41] called your son and he said what did the
[57:43] father say my son who was once dead is
[57:46] alive again slay the fatted calf slay
[57:50] the fatty calf grab the ring put it on
[57:53] put it on his put it on his finger it
[57:55] was Grace expressing itself to a fallen
[57:59] son but you notice what what did that
[58:01] what of the prodical son say he didn't
[58:04] say I'm not worthy to be your son he
[58:06] says I'm not worthy to be called your
[58:08] son and that's what condemnation does
[58:11] condemnation says well you might be a
[58:13] son but you're too far in you're too far
[58:15] in sin to be known as a son I know what
[58:18] I'm talking about now I fought
[58:20] condemnation you know my dad always uses
[58:23] the phrase he says it's the devil that
[58:25] talks you in to robbing the bank then he
[58:27] calls the police on you it's the devil
[58:30] that that brings you down into s brings
[58:33] you down in addictions brings you down
[58:35] and says well now you're too far in
[58:37] there but the grace of God remains yes
[58:40] sir come on now the grace of God is
[58:42] still calling your name if you're
[58:44] willing to come to yourself the prodigal
[58:47] son come to himself even though he spent
[58:50] all of his life savings he he brought
[58:53] disgrace to the family name but he
[58:55] realized that predestinated seed Oh Come
[58:59] From the father man you no matter what
[59:02] you have done buddy you might you might
[59:04] have brought disgrace say you went out
[59:05] and backslid you you turn your life
[59:07] upside down that never takes the seed of
[59:10] your father it never takes it away the
[59:12] seed is going to remain and the only way
[59:15] for you to be satisfied is you to
[59:17] realize that I'm a seed of the father oh
[59:20] come on now I'm called to be in the
[59:22] people to to do exploits and that's what
[59:26] the prodical son realized I'm not called
[59:29] to be begging I'm called to rain I'm not
[59:32] called to serve my master I'm called to
[59:35] stand up in authority and have others
[59:37] serving me amen oh Hallelujah and so
[59:42] this people ain't chosen because of a
[59:45] natural bloodline but because of a
[59:47] spiritual
[59:48] bloodline because you look the Pharisees
[59:51] could trace their bloodline all the way
[59:53] back to Abraham but but then Jesus would
[59:55] say you're of your father the devil so
[59:57] it ain't a natural bloodline that God is
[1:00:00] looking at it's a spiritual bloodline
[1:00:02] because then you have the Samaritan that
[1:00:05] was a prostitute she had a pass she she
[1:00:07] did nothing good to her name but then
[1:00:10] God could looked at that bloodline and
[1:00:12] see it might not be a natural bloodline
[1:00:14] but there's a spiritual bloodline that
[1:00:16] I'm attracted to that I'm coming for oh
[1:00:19] Hallelujah the Bible would tell us in
[1:00:21] Galatians 3:28 there was neither Jew nor
[1:00:24] Greek there was neither Bond nor free
[1:00:26] there was neither male nor female for
[1:00:28] Year all one in Christ Jesus and then be
[1:00:32] if you be Christ then you're Abraham's
[1:00:35] seed and hirs according to the promise
[1:00:38] we're HS so whatever Christ had we have
[1:00:42] oh we don't got separate Powers but
[1:00:44] we're life of his life bone of his bone
[1:00:47] flesh of his flesh life of his life she
[1:00:50] is him not because I'm a Martin not
[1:00:54] because Browning but because there's
[1:00:56] another inheritance there's another
[1:00:58] family that we belong to that is the
[1:01:01] family of God the people not a people
[1:01:05] but the people that know their God oh
[1:01:09] Hallelujah not a people that know
[1:01:10] they're God but the people the he's
[1:01:13] making a claim my people is going to
[1:01:16] know me they're going to identify me and
[1:01:19] produce
[1:01:20] exploits Hallelujah and I believe this
[1:01:23] is the hour that the people is knowing
[1:01:26] their God and I heard brother Samuel he
[1:01:28] was preaching in Uncle Jonathan's I
[1:01:30] think last year or the year before and
[1:01:32] he made a profound statement he says
[1:01:34] we're not living in an hour where
[1:01:35] promises are being made but we're living
[1:01:38] in the hour the promises are being
[1:01:39] fulfilled so we're not living in the
[1:01:42] hour that God is promising there's a
[1:01:44] people but we're living in the hour
[1:01:46] where God is coming in the people we're
[1:01:49] not looking for Elijah the prophet we've
[1:01:51] identified Elijah the prophet we're not
[1:01:53] looking for that for that spotless bride
[1:01:56] we've identified the Spotless bride I am
[1:01:59] her I am she oh Hallelujah but you see
[1:02:03] what is separating the two groups is the
[1:02:06] people that knows their God and so to
[1:02:08] know God you got to see God understand
[1:02:11] God you got to know where he's at if you
[1:02:13] don't know where he's at you're never
[1:02:15] going to find him but you see but the
[1:02:17] Brandon would tell us and so many people
[1:02:19] have different opinions of Christ and as
[1:02:22] I travel in different parts of the
[1:02:23] country and around the world I find that
[1:02:26] so many people have their different
[1:02:28] opinions you'll be surprised to know
[1:02:30] what some of their opinions are some of
[1:02:32] them thinks he's a wonderful teacher he
[1:02:36] says well he was that just exactly many
[1:02:39] thinks he was a great philosopher which
[1:02:41] he was that certainly he was some of
[1:02:43] them think he was a good man he was that
[1:02:46] but see he was more than that and I I
[1:02:49] love this part he says he was all of
[1:02:51] that plus he was all of that plus in
[1:02:54] other words don't be looking at the
[1:02:56] Garment quit looking at the outside and
[1:02:59] look what's on the inside oh come on now
[1:03:03] many people is looking at Malachi 4 and
[1:03:06] fail to see what he brought come on
[1:03:08] brother Malachi 4 was to be a man but
[1:03:10] what he was bringing was Jesus Christ
[1:03:13] the word many people's looking at a
[1:03:16] prophet and Fa to see Christ oh
[1:03:19] Hallelujah but I'm not looking at a
[1:03:21] prophet I'm looking at the word I'm
[1:03:23] looking at Jesus Christ the same
[1:03:26] yesterday today and forever I've
[1:03:29] identified the word in this generation
[1:03:31] so that I can perform exploits hey if
[1:03:35] you want to perform exploits you got to
[1:03:36] know your God that's right you got to
[1:03:38] know him you got to identify him and
[1:03:41] make him your God make this your message
[1:03:44] this ain't this ain't the preacher's
[1:03:46] message it's my message this is my
[1:03:48] inheritance this is my identity this is
[1:03:51] my life oh Hallelujah
[1:03:54] you got to identify it as yours it ain't
[1:03:57] the chickens I don't care about the
[1:03:59] chickens it's me it's mine it's my
[1:04:02] identity we all know the story that you
[1:04:04] have the eagle in the barnyard the
[1:04:06] chickens could care less they was happy
[1:04:09] eating the the slap they was happy
[1:04:11] clucking and walking around but there
[1:04:13] was predestination there was Grace on
[1:04:16] the inside of that of that eagle that
[1:04:18] says my goodness I don't belong here I
[1:04:20] don't belong here and because of Grace
[1:04:23] he looked up and because of Grace a
[1:04:26] scream cried out to him and because of
[1:04:28] Grace he
[1:04:31] responded oh Hallelujah brother brandom
[1:04:34] says it was Eagle to Eagle he come from
[1:04:37] Mama eagle and since he come from it he
[1:04:40] couldn't help but identify it then
[1:04:42] brother brandom says it's word
[1:04:45] responding to word he says it's word
[1:04:47] promised and the word word coming
[1:04:50] together you identifying you've come
[1:04:53] from the word oh Hallelujah you can't
[1:04:56] deny this message even if you wanted to
[1:04:58] it's who you are it's your name it's
[1:05:02] your purpose it's your
[1:05:04] identity oh hallelujah it's Grace coming
[1:05:07] to you and saying you're called for a
[1:05:10] greater
[1:05:11] purpose oh you're not meant to be
[1:05:13] walking in a cycle you're meant to
[1:05:15] perform exploits amen hallelujah but you
[1:05:18] got to come up higher hey too many
[1:05:21] people's happy in the chicken yard come
[1:05:23] on now many too many people is sitting
[1:05:26] in a church but they go back to a
[1:05:28] chicken yard and they're happy there you
[1:05:30] got to get unsatisfied with where you're
[1:05:33] at so that you can know your God in
[1:05:35] order for the chick for the eagle to
[1:05:37] know mama he had to get up on the post
[1:05:40] he had to get on the post then after the
[1:05:42] post he got on the peak of the barn and
[1:05:44] each step he was taking he was getting
[1:05:47] higher and farther away from the
[1:05:49] Barnyard and let me say this you might
[1:05:51] not perform the supernatural WI way but
[1:05:54] each step you're getting closer and
[1:05:57] closer and closer to one day you're
[1:06:00] sitting in Heavenly places with Christ
[1:06:03] Jesus hey brother brandom says that's
[1:06:05] the believer's position is in Heavenly
[1:06:07] places yes sir so in order for the eager
[1:06:10] to get in Heavenly places here to start
[1:06:12] climbing here to climb here to get the
[1:06:15] justification sanctification the Holy
[1:06:18] Ghost and you don't got to stop with the
[1:06:20] Holy Ghost come up a little higher come
[1:06:22] up a little higher word has come and
[1:06:25] revealed itself sir oh
[1:06:28] Hallelujah that that eagle says man I
[1:06:30] don't belong care I'm called for a
[1:06:32] higher calling I've got a greater
[1:06:34] purpose I'm supposed to be eating
[1:06:36] chickens not eating with the chickens
[1:06:39] come on now I'm supposed to be eating
[1:06:41] these guys not walking around with them
[1:06:44] oh man you know but and the Bible says
[1:06:46] you're going to judge the ones that have
[1:06:48] judged you the ones that have spoken
[1:06:51] against you you're going to be the ones
[1:06:53] that judge them oh come on you're not
[1:06:55] supposed to be walking around with them
[1:06:56] being judged but you're going to be the
[1:06:59] judge all right
[1:07:02] hallelujah oh my but we got to stop
[1:07:04] looking at the Garment and look at the
[1:07:07] word brother Brandon we continue on to
[1:07:09] say some of them think he was a prophet
[1:07:11] he was a prophet but he was more than a
[1:07:14] prophet he was what a prophet was plus
[1:07:17] see so what how would we know now if he
[1:07:20] was a teaching of his teachings he was a
[1:07:22] teacher he was a great philosopher but
[1:07:25] the only way we'll ever know him today
[1:07:28] is to identify him today and I believe
[1:07:31] he raised from the dead I believe that
[1:07:33] with all of my heart I believe that he's
[1:07:35] promised here and he's the same
[1:07:37] yesterday today and forever amen he says
[1:07:41] in order to identify him you got to
[1:07:43] realize he's more than a prophet he was
[1:07:45] a philosopher but he's a philosopher
[1:07:47] plus he was a man but he's a man plus
[1:07:51] and let me say this remember when
[1:07:52] Nathaniel seen Jesus it wasn't the
[1:07:55] Garment that Jesus was wearing that
[1:07:57] revealed to Nathaniel that he was the
[1:07:59] Messiah cuz we know what happened he
[1:08:01] performed the Messiah sign and then he
[1:08:04] realized this is the Messiah not by what
[1:08:06] he was wearing but what he was bringing
[1:08:09] yes sir oh come on now too many people
[1:08:12] is looking at a Ministry trying to
[1:08:14] identify Christ you never identify
[1:08:17] Christ in a Ministry come on now you
[1:08:19] can't identify Christ in a gift you got
[1:08:22] to identify Christ
[1:08:24] in the word come on now it wasn't the
[1:08:27] Garment that Jesus was wearing and too
[1:08:30] many people is looking at the garments
[1:08:32] of ministry garments of preachers
[1:08:35] garments of gifted men trying to see the
[1:08:37] world trying to see God and God said no
[1:08:40] it's not the garments it's the word get
[1:08:43] your eyes off of a man and say the word
[1:08:46] get your eyes off of a Ministry and see
[1:08:49] the word know me so that you can do
[1:08:52] exploits you're called for this you're
[1:08:55] chosen for this just identify me
[1:08:58] recognize me oh Hallelujah so
[1:09:01] identifying him is to recognize not on
[1:09:04] pages but in a body you see brother the
[1:09:07] Brandon would say but but what would
[1:09:09] identify him would be the identification
[1:09:12] that the scripture says he would be in
[1:09:14] and that's how we have to identify him
[1:09:17] that's that that's the way he was
[1:09:19] identified then and this is where this
[1:09:21] is where B was pulling the Garment from
[1:09:23] because he wasn't any spectacular man in
[1:09:26] a certain array of dresss he had no
[1:09:29] organization that he boasted from he had
[1:09:31] no credentials from any certain
[1:09:33] Fellowship that he could say I belong to
[1:09:36] the biggest see he had only the works of
[1:09:39] God that was proven and spoken of that
[1:09:42] would identify him that was his
[1:09:46] credentials it wasn't the dress that was
[1:09:49] the credentials it was the word oh my
[1:09:53] and makes some people mad it don't
[1:09:55] matter if it's your favorite preacher
[1:09:57] behind the desk if it's the word coming
[1:09:59] forth that's the credentials too many
[1:10:02] people think we can't see the
[1:10:04] supernatural if so and so ain't
[1:10:06] preaching if we're not at a convention
[1:10:08] if we're not at a youth camp we're not
[1:10:10] going to see the supernatural it don't
[1:10:12] matter who's preaching as long as it's
[1:10:14] the credentials as long as it's the word
[1:10:17] we can see God Mighty in action on a
[1:10:20] Thursday night on a Sunday morning it
[1:10:23] don't matter who's in the dress just
[1:10:25] look for the
[1:10:27] word oh hallelujah look for the
[1:10:31] word because hope this is okay I'm I'm
[1:10:34] going to take a little bit of Liberty
[1:10:36] here brother Brandon preaches a message
[1:10:38] at the voice of God in the last day and
[1:10:40] it's a powerful message he goes through
[1:10:42] many many voices he says there's a a
[1:10:45] voice of politics he says the voice of
[1:10:47] Hollywood and he says those voices have
[1:10:49] more influences than the voice of God
[1:10:52] does has a strong pul than the voice of
[1:10:55] God and then he comes to a a voice of a
[1:10:58] spouse he talks about Adam and Eve then
[1:11:00] he talks about communism but then he
[1:11:02] comes down and talks about a church
[1:11:04] voice and you know and and I was as I
[1:11:07] was listening to that sermon and I was
[1:11:09] thinking my how could that apply to a
[1:11:11] message church and I'm just going to
[1:11:13] take some Liberty here because you can
[1:11:15] look up the denominational churches
[1:11:17] they've got their voices they've got
[1:11:18] their influences and I was thinking how
[1:11:21] could that come into a church and
[1:11:22] something just struck me and I I
[1:11:25] remember as a as a teenager I never
[1:11:27] thought God did anything for me because
[1:11:29] I never went out to the world I'm sure
[1:11:31] you guys can testify I was raised on a
[1:11:33] church pew I sat on the front row every
[1:11:35] service I never went out to the world I
[1:11:38] never drank I've never smoked I I've
[1:11:40] never cussed I've never did any of those
[1:11:42] things and I remember thinking as a as a
[1:11:44] as a child that man God never did
[1:11:46] anything for me and I remember one
[1:11:48] service sitting on the front row we had
[1:11:50] a preacher come through and he says you
[1:11:52] know many people think many young people
[1:11:54] think since they never went out into the
[1:11:56] world they've never drank they've never
[1:11:58] smoked they never did these things that
[1:12:00] God never did anything for him and I'm
[1:12:02] sat there on the front row thinking
[1:12:04] whoa that's me who told him and he says
[1:12:08] not to take away from these other
[1:12:10] testimonies but you've got a greater
[1:12:13] testimony cuz you're in the midst of
[1:12:15] Satan's Eden and yet you're not the fou
[1:12:18] and I was thinking on that and that
[1:12:20] struck me it was a church voice getting
[1:12:22] me to look at other others testimonies
[1:12:25] and denying the testimony that God has
[1:12:28] given me oh come on now cuz the grass is
[1:12:31] always greener on the other side of the
[1:12:33] fence we can be sitting here with the
[1:12:35] powerful testimony I've never drank I've
[1:12:38] never smoked I've never cussed I've
[1:12:40] never did these things and here the
[1:12:42] devil's whispering to me with the church
[1:12:44] voice saying look at so and so this one
[1:12:47] was delivered from drugs that one was
[1:12:49] delivered from smoking and man God's
[1:12:51] never did anything for you that's a
[1:12:53] church voice that tries to attract your
[1:12:56] attention away from the
[1:12:58] supernatural oh come on now then that
[1:13:00] that moves on from just a an individual
[1:13:03] to a body and now we're thinking man if
[1:13:06] we're not in a convention God's not
[1:13:07] going to move if we're not in a special
[1:13:09] meeting God's not going to move it's a
[1:13:11] church voice trying to attract your
[1:13:14] attention away from the Supernatural and
[1:13:17] I say the gift don't bring the
[1:13:19] supernatural the word brings the
[1:13:21] supernatural I said Lord I'm not
[1:13:24] listening to the voices that the devil
[1:13:26] is bringing I'm listening to One voice
[1:13:29] that's the word and what is so
[1:13:31] incredible about the sermon where the
[1:13:33] brandom goes through all of these voices
[1:13:35] then at the end of it he says but my
[1:13:37] sheep know my voice there's all of these
[1:13:40] voices that is plaguing homes plaguing
[1:13:43] minds but my sheep ain't attracted to
[1:13:46] those voices they're attracted to the
[1:13:49] voice the
[1:13:51] words oh
[1:13:54] Hallelujah so don't let us get so
[1:13:57] attracted to a to a garment that we
[1:13:59] don't see the word amen so then brother
[1:14:02] Brandon would say this the scripture is
[1:14:04] what testifies of him so that's what
[1:14:06] identified him was the scripture you
[1:14:09] believe that that's what we'll have to
[1:14:11] identify him today then we will know
[1:14:14] whether we're right or not whether it
[1:14:16] was him he was the same he will do the
[1:14:20] same and then that that struck me as as
[1:14:23] I was reading this brother Samuel
[1:14:25] because once a Believer finds out that
[1:14:27] he's right there's such a confidence you
[1:14:30] know how many's ever been in in an
[1:14:32] argument and you just think that you're
[1:14:33] right you know that you're right you
[1:14:35] know it so you're proving your point
[1:14:37] proving your point and then the other
[1:14:38] person pulls out their phone Googles it
[1:14:41] and you're wrong and then you're like oh
[1:14:43] man you just lose all of your confidence
[1:14:45] then you're second guessing everything
[1:14:47] you believe in cuz you're like man cuz I
[1:14:50] I I thought I was right and that's why
[1:14:52] brother Brandon saying once you identify
[1:14:55] him then you know whether you're right
[1:14:57] or if you're wrong amen there's a
[1:15:00] courage that comes inside of a Believer
[1:15:02] once he identifies that what I believe
[1:15:05] ain't my word it's his word oh come on
[1:15:09] now once a once a young lady realizes
[1:15:11] that wearing a long dress and long hair
[1:15:14] ain't she it ain't trying to be be
[1:15:16] somebody good or special it's a covenant
[1:15:19] that God has with you yes sir it's what
[1:15:22] God has commissioned you to do and put
[1:15:24] Authority behind it you
[1:15:28] know you you you can look at David when
[1:15:31] David come to his brothers at the
[1:15:33] battlefield there was on man of David
[1:15:35] weren't they not say man you just come
[1:15:37] to to be a spectator you just come to do
[1:15:39] this and to do that but in reality the
[1:15:41] father sent him he didn't come by his
[1:15:44] own free will his father sent him
[1:15:47] remember Joseph the brothers of Joseph
[1:15:49] was mad at him because the father sent
[1:15:52] him come on they wasn't doing it by
[1:15:54] their own free will the father sent him
[1:15:57] and let the world get maded at you
[1:15:59] sisters let the world say you're a goody
[1:16:01] tisue you're this you're that you're not
[1:16:04] doing it on your own free will the
[1:16:06] father has told you to do it and I say
[1:16:08] young people let's get some courage
[1:16:11] young adults let's get some courage I've
[1:16:13] identified the word for this day it's
[1:16:16] not my word it's God's word I'm not
[1:16:19] backing up this message God is backing
[1:16:21] up this message oh come on now God the
[1:16:24] father has sent this in this generation
[1:16:27] to do
[1:16:28] exploits Joseph didn't sent himself the
[1:16:31] father sent him and could you imagine
[1:16:33] being Joseph the Father the brothers are
[1:16:36] mad at him Brothers the father sent me I
[1:16:40] did I didn't give me this garment the
[1:16:42] father gave it to me I didn't give me
[1:16:44] myself this Grace the father gave me
[1:16:46] this Grace oh Hallelujah and he's robed
[1:16:50] Us in his word in this generation he's
[1:16:53] poured out his grace upon us let them be
[1:16:56] jealous it's not our fault God called us
[1:16:58] to this oh Hallelujah but there's such a
[1:17:02] confidence that the father has sent us
[1:17:05] and I'm going to I'm going to tell on
[1:17:06] myself now hope this is okay and you
[1:17:09] know and I remember being a young
[1:17:11] preacher and believing things in this
[1:17:13] message you know and I and I believe
[1:17:15] that uh the the mighty Angel come to the
[1:17:17] Earth to the Earthly Angel and give an
[1:17:19] open book you know I've always believed
[1:17:22] that but to be be honest I never could
[1:17:23] find a quote for it and and it's Give me
[1:17:25] liberty here I never could find a quote
[1:17:27] I've looked and I looked and you know
[1:17:29] because I never could find a quote for
[1:17:31] it I would get nervous around guys that
[1:17:34] didn't believe that I would get skittish
[1:17:36] because man I've got nothing backing me
[1:17:38] up you know and then brother Wayne he
[1:17:40] was talking about how he was preaching
[1:17:41] for a minister one time and somebody
[1:17:44] challenged him on it and he quoted a
[1:17:45] quote that brother brandom said about
[1:17:47] that and I thought whoa there's a quote
[1:17:50] for that and it was great hearing him
[1:17:52] talk about the quote but once he sent me
[1:17:55] the quote and I read it for myself it
[1:17:57] was a whole different story and this is
[1:18:00] what brother brandom says in the breach
[1:18:02] between the seven Church ages and the
[1:18:03] seals he says talk about a jubilee talk
[1:18:06] about a time when the lamb walked forth
[1:18:09] he says see the book's even sealed in
[1:18:11] heaven the Mysteries are say is my name
[1:18:13] there I don't know I hope it is but if
[1:18:16] it is it was put there before the
[1:18:18] foundation of the world and then he says
[1:18:20] but the first thing that represented the
[1:18:23] Redemption come the lamb and that the
[1:18:25] lamb that had been slain before the
[1:18:27] foundation of the world and this and
[1:18:29] this is the part right here and he took
[1:18:31] the book Glory opened the book tore off
[1:18:34] the seals sent it down to the Earth to a
[1:18:37] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[1:18:40] and he says there you are and I'm
[1:18:43] telling you brother there is a liberty
[1:18:45] that come over me that it ain't just my
[1:18:48] opinion it's God's word and let me say
[1:18:51] this once you identify by the word for
[1:18:54] this generation there's the faith the
[1:18:56] pulsates there's a pulsation of faith
[1:18:59] that the Rapture ain't my word it's
[1:19:01] God's word the body change ain't my word
[1:19:04] it's God's word Grace ain't M it ain't
[1:19:08] me coming up with Grace it's God's grace
[1:19:11] yes sir once you identify it there's a
[1:19:13] courage because what the devil wants you
[1:19:15] to do is Venture without Authority and
[1:19:18] that's what I was doing all all those
[1:19:20] times was I had no Authority and even
[1:19:22] even though I knew it was right I had no
[1:19:24] Authority behind it and brother Brandon
[1:19:26] preaches a message to presume and he
[1:19:28] says presume is to venture without
[1:19:31] Authority and he says in the time and
[1:19:33] the hour we're living in if a person
[1:19:35] don't know which way to go or what to do
[1:19:38] how to turn you're not walking by faith
[1:19:40] anymore he says you're just guessing
[1:19:42] you're
[1:19:43] presuming and purum is to advance with
[1:19:46] without official Authority so if we
[1:19:48] haven't got the real official authority
[1:19:51] to know what God Said with take place in
[1:19:53] this hour how are we ever going to face
[1:19:56] this hour he says how are we ever going
[1:19:59] to face it if we're just presuming Oh my
[1:20:03] he continues on to say and we've got to
[1:20:05] face that knowing by faith in his word
[1:20:08] that the things that are supposed to
[1:20:10] happen now and the conditions of the
[1:20:12] Nations the condition of the people
[1:20:15] condition of the church and so forth
[1:20:17] we've got to know that and then how to
[1:20:20] walk out and to face it if you don't
[1:20:22] know how to do that uh you're you're
[1:20:25] just what we used to call uh just jump
[1:20:27] just jumping in hoping it will be there
[1:20:29] hoping this hoping that what will it be
[1:20:32] but God wants us not to do that he wants
[1:20:34] us to know he wants us to know and so
[1:20:38] that's why we've got to identify it we
[1:20:40] got to identify without identifying
[1:20:42] brother brandom says we're just jumping
[1:20:44] into it blindly but once we're we put
[1:20:46] the pursuing aside we identify it then
[1:20:50] there's Authority we're walking no KN
[1:20:53] what's happening out there you know you
[1:20:55] know you know what I'm talking about I'm
[1:20:57] a sort of I'm an honory fell you can ask
[1:20:59] my wife and and I I sometimes I like
[1:21:01] pranking people you know and it's always
[1:21:03] aggravating as a prankster whenever
[1:21:06] you're standing behind the door waiting
[1:21:08] to jump out and scare somebody and as
[1:21:10] you're waiting there for 10 minutes 15
[1:21:12] minutes you're waiting for just an
[1:21:13] innocent person to walk an innocent
[1:21:15] bystander just to walk by and then some
[1:21:18] smart Alex says hey Josh's behind the
[1:21:20] door then you're like come on man I've
[1:21:23] been waiting all this time you still try
[1:21:25] to scare him but now they're not walking
[1:21:28] blindly anymore but they know you're
[1:21:30] there then I can jump out and say ra
[1:21:32] better don't scare them because they
[1:21:34] know what's happening oh come on now and
[1:21:37] that's what brother Brandon is saying we
[1:21:39] got to know what we're walking with we
[1:21:42] know the devil's blueprint we know the
[1:21:44] devil's tactics we got to know with the
[1:21:46] Revelation not presuming that it's the
[1:21:49] devil's Playbook but no it's the devil's
[1:21:51] Playbook oh then we're walking now the
[1:21:54] devil can pull out Temptation we said
[1:21:56] not today devil no not today he can
[1:21:59] bring discouragement not today he can
[1:22:02] bring up he can bring up doubts not
[1:22:04] today he can bring up all of these
[1:22:06] critics and naysayers and we say not
[1:22:08] today I've identified it I know before
[1:22:12] the coming of the Lord there's a
[1:22:14] perilous times I know there's many going
[1:22:16] to fall away that's just the sign of the
[1:22:19] end time I know what's taking place and
[1:22:22] man then there's a courage man there's a
[1:22:24] courage no and I might not know what's
[1:22:26] happening tomorrow but I Know Who Holds
[1:22:28] my tomorrow we're no longer walking
[1:22:30] blindly but we're walking with
[1:22:33] courage praise the Lord you know I I I I
[1:22:37] hope this is going to be okay you
[1:22:38] anybody know know of Mark Lowry the
[1:22:40] comedian the singer you know and I
[1:22:42] remember hearing a story he told one
[1:22:44] time he says man I survived the tornado
[1:22:46] and I thought my pick my interest
[1:22:48] because we're we're in Tornado Alley
[1:22:50] Oklahoma and he says you know I got me I
[1:22:52] got out me a house boat and I was on I
[1:22:54] was on this Lake and Tornado Alley and
[1:22:56] man there come a tornado he says the
[1:22:58] boat went rocking back and forth back
[1:23:00] and forth and he says after the tornado
[1:23:03] I was scared to death he says I come
[1:23:05] crawling out of my house boat all the
[1:23:06] boats are on their sides they're they're
[1:23:08] flipped over and he says there are some
[1:23:11] guys there on the dock that says whoopy
[1:23:13] we survived another one and he thought
[1:23:15] what's wrong with these guys he walked
[1:23:17] up to him and says guys why y'all so
[1:23:19] happy he says You must be new here says
[1:23:22] this is tornado H this is Tornado Alley
[1:23:24] this happens all the time and he makes a
[1:23:27] statement he says if I knew I was going
[1:23:29] to survive I would have had a good time
[1:23:31] too he didn't know if he was going to
[1:23:34] survive or not but the other ones knew
[1:23:36] they was going to survive and since they
[1:23:39] knew they had joy in the midst of the
[1:23:41] trial and little church we know we're in
[1:23:44] we're going to reign as kings we're
[1:23:46] going to March over the ashes of the
[1:23:48] wicked we can have joy in the midst of
[1:23:50] the trial we can have joy in the midst
[1:23:53] of the suffering knowing that our future
[1:23:56] is in concrete there's nothing the devil
[1:23:58] can do to keep us from our expected end
[1:24:02] he hasn't given us an unexpected end we
[1:24:05] have an expected end we know what's
[1:24:07] going to happen at the end of the book
[1:24:10] yes sir come on I know my thoughts
[1:24:12] towards you thoughts of Peace not not of
[1:24:15] evil but of good and to give you an
[1:24:17] expected end we know what's we know what
[1:24:20] to expect we know there's a rapture we
[1:24:23] know there's a mar supper of the Lamb if
[1:24:26] we didn't know those things man where
[1:24:27] would our courage be but we've
[1:24:29] identified it and says this people this
[1:24:32] people ain't somebody down the road it's
[1:24:34] me yes sir I'm a part of that
[1:24:37] people hallelujah the brother brandom
[1:24:39] says this in presuming he says it's
[1:24:42] written over in St John I think about
[1:24:44] the 15th chapter if you abide in me my
[1:24:47] word abide in you see the word abides
[1:24:50] see then ask what you will and it'll be
[1:24:52] done because it's not you it's the word
[1:24:55] that's in you and the word is God see
[1:24:57] God in you God is the word in the
[1:25:00] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:25:02] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:25:04] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now
[1:25:06] when the return of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:08] bringing the word in us and it abiding
[1:25:11] in there it's not you that speaks it's
[1:25:14] the word itself coming out so it is the
[1:25:17] word that will perform the work oh
[1:25:21] Hallelujah and that's in Pursuit in he
[1:25:23] says once you not you're no longer
[1:25:24] pursuing and let the word abide and then
[1:25:27] it's not not you speaking the word it's
[1:25:29] not you performing the work is the word
[1:25:33] and I thought my you know you and I was
[1:25:35] as I was thinking on these things I I
[1:25:37] I'm imagine I have a big imagination you
[1:25:39] know so I as I work and things I just I
[1:25:42] my mind just thinks you know and I was
[1:25:44] thinking on this and I thought and I
[1:25:46] thought of me and my wife I thought
[1:25:47] before me and my wife was married she
[1:25:49] had a full-time job she had to pay for
[1:25:51] her own own clothes she had to pay for
[1:25:53] her own food she had have pay for her
[1:25:55] own car she was under her own authority
[1:25:58] she was her own absolute but once she
[1:26:01] come under my authority I become her
[1:26:03] absolute then it was her no longer
[1:26:06] working for herself but now it was my
[1:26:08] job to provide and I thought my goodness
[1:26:11] too many people have a problem with the
[1:26:13] word being the absolute because it's the
[1:26:16] final say but they fail to see that the
[1:26:19] final say is also the ti poost yes sir
[1:26:22] come on now if if you let it be your
[1:26:24] final sa then it becomes your ti poost
[1:26:27] then it's no longer you trying to be
[1:26:29] good enough but you're under the
[1:26:31] authority of the word it's the word's
[1:26:34] responsibility oh hallelujah it's not
[1:26:37] you performing The Works it's the word
[1:26:39] in you coming out and performing The
[1:26:42] Works and so now it's not my wife having
[1:26:45] a job I got to work you know I ain't got
[1:26:48] to work I I'm the one making sure she
[1:26:50] has food I'm the one making making sure
[1:26:52] she's clothed I'm the one making sure
[1:26:54] she's got a nice van I'm the one making
[1:26:57] sure that has an all change it's not her
[1:27:00] it's me she's come under my headship oh
[1:27:03] man if you could ever come under the
[1:27:05] headship of the word you you look up you
[1:27:08] look in Exodus it wasn't Joshua and
[1:27:10] Caleb trying to make sure they had shoes
[1:27:12] on their feet right it wasn't Joshua and
[1:27:14] Caleb bringing Mana Out of Heaven it
[1:27:17] wasn't Joshua and Caleb bringing water
[1:27:19] out of the out of the rock it was them
[1:27:22] following the word then it was the word
[1:27:24] bringing Mana Out of Heaven it was the
[1:27:27] word bringing water out of the rock come
[1:27:29] on now it's not you trying to bring
[1:27:31] forth the peace it's not you trying to
[1:27:33] bring forth the hope it's the word
[1:27:35] coming on the inside bringing a a a hope
[1:27:38] a joy full of full of Glory you're
[1:27:40] you're marching over everything because
[1:27:43] it's no longer you it's the
[1:27:45] word and what what what is so incredible
[1:27:48] about the story I hope this is okay this
[1:27:49] evening you look at Joshua and Caleb
[1:27:52] Caleb Gets all the way to the promised
[1:27:54] land right he gets to the promised land
[1:27:56] and what did he say what did he say
[1:27:59] we're more than able to take the land
[1:28:01] that is Flowing with milk and honey
[1:28:04] where did he get the milk and honey from
[1:28:06] did you ever think about that Moses
[1:28:09] where did Moses get them milk and honey
[1:28:11] from God so you notice that Caleb's
[1:28:14] voice become the same as Moses voice sir
[1:28:17] Caleb's understanding become the same as
[1:28:20] Moses understanding what's the say the
[1:28:22] the spirit and the bride say come it's
[1:28:25] that they've come under the the same
[1:28:27] word they've got the same Authority and
[1:28:29] you notice what God says about Caleb
[1:28:32] Cale God says because Caleb has followed
[1:28:34] me fully who did Caleb follow Moses come
[1:28:39] on now I'm going say the man the word he
[1:28:42] followed the word and the word brought
[1:28:45] him through the Wilderness the word
[1:28:47] brought him through all the Skeptics the
[1:28:49] word brought him through the Red Sea and
[1:28:51] now you notice
[1:28:52] the Bible says and because Caleb hath
[1:28:54] followed me fully his seed shall possess
[1:28:57] the land and that distruct me as a
[1:29:00] father you know our our children have to
[1:29:03] have their own experience but now the
[1:29:05] same Grace I have is the same Grace they
[1:29:08] can experience now it's no longer saying
[1:29:10] Lord please keep my children it's Lord
[1:29:13] I've honored your word you're not going
[1:29:14] to give me Serpent seed and that's what
[1:29:16] Dad has always spoke over us as boys he
[1:29:19] says Lord you never you haven't given me
[1:29:21] Serpent seed every one of my children
[1:29:23] are part of your seed Caleb is in drugs
[1:29:26] Caleb is in a gang Caleb was was out
[1:29:28] partying but D always say Lord you
[1:29:31] haven't given me Serpent seed and
[1:29:33] because Caleb in the Bible followed the
[1:29:35] Lord fully followed me fully his seed
[1:29:39] possessed the land oh I said parents
[1:29:41] let's get some courage about us and not
[1:29:43] follow this half-heartedly but let's let
[1:29:45] us follow it fly so there can be
[1:29:48] exploits I want to be exploits the
[1:29:51] brother brother brother ROM preaches uh
[1:29:52] the exploits of Faith he says it's a
[1:29:55] natural people with the supernatural God
[1:29:57] coming in the natural people help
[1:29:59] performing Supernatural signs that's
[1:30:02] what I want to be I don't want to be a
[1:30:04] dead church member I want to have the
[1:30:06] life of God Amen oh the brother Brandon
[1:30:09] would say this about David and give me a
[1:30:12] few more minutes I'll bring this down to
[1:30:13] a close he says and Little David
[1:30:15] standing there with a little piece of
[1:30:18] leather goat skin sheep skin with two
[1:30:20] pieces of string tied to it
[1:30:23] but it was revealed to him Revelation
[1:30:25] struck him amen he said the god that
[1:30:28] took me out of the PS of the bear that
[1:30:30] took me out of the paws of the lion how
[1:30:33] much more will he deliver the
[1:30:35] uncircumcised Philistine into my hand
[1:30:38] and he says he was standing there with
[1:30:40] Revelation and this just struck me like
[1:30:42] I said I'm constantly thinking what was
[1:30:44] the Revelation that struck him the god
[1:30:47] that kept me but during the bear attack
[1:30:49] yesterday is the same God keeping me
[1:30:51] today and that's what Revelation does
[1:30:54] the same God of yesterday is the god of
[1:30:56] today the same God in the book of Acts
[1:30:59] is the same God today the same God that
[1:31:02] walked on the shores of Galilee is the
[1:31:04] same God walking today but you got to
[1:31:06] identify him and brother Brandon and I
[1:31:08] love how brother Brandon puts this he
[1:31:11] says how much more will he deliver that
[1:31:12] uncircumcised Philistine into my hand he
[1:31:15] says his brothers was more able to do it
[1:31:18] Saw Head and Shoulders above his army
[1:31:21] but you see it wasn't revealed to them
[1:31:24] oh it wasn't revealed to them you might
[1:31:26] not be the be the sharpest knife in the
[1:31:28] cabinet but it's revealed to you you
[1:31:30] might say that one's smarter than I am
[1:31:32] that one's got more money that one's got
[1:31:33] a nicer house that's got better cars but
[1:31:36] it's not revealed to them it's revealed
[1:31:38] to you oh God don't look on the outward
[1:31:41] he looks at the heart he looks at the
[1:31:43] seed oh Hallelujah and he continues on
[1:31:46] to say Amen there it is they believe and
[1:31:48] this is just so profound he says they
[1:31:50] believed it could be done they he's
[1:31:53] talking about David's Brothers they
[1:31:54] belied they could be done they belied
[1:31:57] God could do it but it wasn't revealed
[1:31:59] to them and that D struck me brother
[1:32:01] Samuel they knew God could do it but
[1:32:03] they was afraid that God can do it in
[1:32:06] them you ever catch that there they knew
[1:32:09] God could do it but they didn't have a
[1:32:11] revelation that God can do it in here oh
[1:32:14] my don't ever let us get to that point
[1:32:16] where we believe God can heal the sick
[1:32:18] but can he heal me we believe that God
[1:32:20] can keep children but can he keep my
[1:32:22] children well I believe that God that
[1:32:24] there's there's the bride making a
[1:32:26] Rapture but can I make the Rapture what
[1:32:28] separated David from his brothers was
[1:32:31] it's me it's me and what did Brother
[1:32:34] brandham say your your your confession
[1:32:36] should be if there's only one making the
[1:32:38] Rapture it's me oh that's what
[1:32:40] Revelation does that's what identifying
[1:32:42] the word does this might you might not
[1:32:45] believe it but I believe it it's me and
[1:32:48] he says but it wasn't revealed to them
[1:32:50] but it was revealed to David see there's
[1:32:52] the difference right there if it's
[1:32:55] absolutely revealed to you that God is
[1:32:57] going to heal you you're going to get it
[1:33:00] you're going to get it I don't care
[1:33:01] what's wrong with you what the odds may
[1:33:04] be may be worse than David and Goliath
[1:33:06] but if it's revealed to you and I say
[1:33:09] Amen it's revealed to me the odds of me
[1:33:12] being good enough to be spotless is slim
[1:33:15] but I believe it's going to happen sir
[1:33:17] hey I might not feel I by mistakes I
[1:33:20] have blunders I I a past but because of
[1:33:23] Grace we stand before him
[1:33:25] blameless hlj we stand before him
[1:33:28] blameless give me a few more minutes you
[1:33:30] see recognizing God brings him out of
[1:33:33] yesterday into today I know this is
[1:33:34] simple but you remember the two that
[1:33:36] walked the road to emus we all know the
[1:33:38] story we've heard of that growing up as
[1:33:39] a kid and it just struck me as I was
[1:33:42] listening to that and reading it that
[1:33:44] these two men were walking down the road
[1:33:46] talking about Jesus right man we thought
[1:33:48] he was the Messiah we thought he was the
[1:33:50] deliverer then you notice what happens
[1:33:53] Jesus appears walks up to the ones that
[1:33:56] are talking about him and they couldn't
[1:33:58] see him and something just struck me
[1:34:00] brother Samuel how come they couldn't
[1:34:03] see him because they were putting Jesus
[1:34:05] in yesterday without bringing him into
[1:34:08] today they couldn't see him oh man I
[1:34:11] think that's what D Daniel is talking
[1:34:13] about a people that know their God the
[1:34:15] people that know their God recognize
[1:34:17] their God not a god of yesterday but
[1:34:19] they know him as a god of today
[1:34:22] they've identified him that's the people
[1:34:24] that's going to do
[1:34:26] exploits hey the church the church World
[1:34:29] they they know him in a forum and a
[1:34:30] ritual they know him of yesterday but my
[1:34:33] people's going to know him of today they
[1:34:35] going to know me today oh Hallelujah
[1:34:38] they're going to know me as a God that
[1:34:39] keeps marriages together today they
[1:34:42] going to know me as a as a way maker
[1:34:45] today but bring split homes together
[1:34:48] today not of yesterday but today they
[1:34:51] know me and they're doing
[1:34:53] exploits but brother Brandon would say
[1:34:55] that Jesus was standing right in front
[1:34:57] of him picked up the scripture and was
[1:34:59] going through all of the scriptures
[1:35:01] concerning Kim and brother Brandon makes
[1:35:03] a statement he says preaching the word
[1:35:05] won't bring Revelation you got to
[1:35:07] receive it and you know what the Bible
[1:35:09] says he walks with them it was in the
[1:35:10] evening time and he acted as if he was
[1:35:13] going to walk by them and they the Bible
[1:35:16] says they constrained him said come in
[1:35:18] with us and brother brandom says right
[1:35:20] there they received the word oh there's
[1:35:23] a difference there's a difference in
[1:35:25] looking at the word and receiving the
[1:35:27] word there has to come a time we receive
[1:35:29] it yes sir now there's many people that
[1:35:31] don't like this the only way to receive
[1:35:33] this word is to receive it as your
[1:35:35] absolute that's right the only way to
[1:35:38] look at this message is to look as the
[1:35:39] final say then once you receive it as
[1:35:42] the final say you see it as God revealed
[1:35:45] today yes sir hallelujah it's not a god
[1:35:49] of yesterday it's a god of today
[1:35:52] that's right then how what opened their
[1:35:54] eyes the Bible says as he broke the
[1:35:55] bread their eyes was open what did they
[1:35:58] see then receiving the word open their
[1:36:01] eyes that the same way he broke the
[1:36:03] bread yesterday he's breaking the bread
[1:36:05] today oh man identifying recognizing him
[1:36:09] brought it to a present tense God oh and
[1:36:12] recognizing the Lord today brings it to
[1:36:15] a present tense god brother brandham
[1:36:17] talks about let the musicians come
[1:36:19] brother brandham talks about the Mary
[1:36:22] Magdalene he says as he W as she was
[1:36:24] walking by Simon's house she seen Jesus
[1:36:27] and brother brandom he says this here
[1:36:30] she saw it and recognized his presence
[1:36:32] and what did it do it washed what did it
[1:36:36] release to her forgiveness release to
[1:36:39] her forgiveness of her sins did you did
[1:36:43] you catch that brother brandom says her
[1:36:45] recognizing Jesus released to her her
[1:36:49] forgiveness oh my
[1:36:52] I don't know what you have need of
[1:36:53] tonight but just recogniz him maybe you
[1:36:55] need a renewing in your body maybe you
[1:36:57] need a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:59] recognizing him releases to you what you
[1:37:02] have the most important desire in your
[1:37:05] heart it releases to you but you notice
[1:37:08] you notice that Simon was Simon invited
[1:37:11] him in and this really just spoke to my
[1:37:13] heart that Simon invited him in but
[1:37:16] failed to recognize him and oh man we
[1:37:19] can invite him to church with us we can
[1:37:21] invite him in our homes but if we fail
[1:37:23] to recognize him oh don't let us come to
[1:37:26] church saying Lord come among us but
[1:37:28] when he comes we say oh man the song
[1:37:31] Leader's too long oh man the preacher's
[1:37:33] too hard oh man that's not what I want
[1:37:36] to hear this service you invite him in
[1:37:39] but fail to entertain him that's right
[1:37:41] oh Hallelujah but let's invite him in
[1:37:42] then recognize him because recognizing
[1:37:46] him releases the authority of God
[1:37:49] brother Brandon would say overcome means
[1:37:50] to rec recognized he said overcome means
[1:37:53] to recognize the devil in every one of
[1:37:54] his tricks a lot of people say there's
[1:37:56] no devil it's just a thought don't you
[1:37:59] believe that there's a real devil he's
[1:38:02] just as real as you are anybody a real
[1:38:04] devil you must recognize him as real you
[1:38:07] must know he's a devil the same time you
[1:38:10] recognize him know that he's a devil and
[1:38:13] he's against you he's against you and
[1:38:17] and let me close on this point but the
[1:38:20] brandom says you don't just recognize
[1:38:22] he's a devil you got to recognize he's
[1:38:24] against you and that's what many people
[1:38:25] fail to do is recognize that the spirit
[1:38:28] of backbiting is against them the spirit
[1:38:32] of a critical that critical spirit is
[1:38:34] against them because what happens if you
[1:38:36] don't recognize it it moves on to
[1:38:38] justifying and the definition of
[1:38:40] justifying actions is to prove or show
[1:38:43] that it's reasonable or necessary oh
[1:38:46] don't let me be that way don't let you
[1:38:49] be that way what we felt recognize that
[1:38:51] a critical spirit is of the devil then
[1:38:54] we start justifying him preacher you
[1:38:56] don't know what I've been through you
[1:38:58] don't know what happened here this what
[1:39:00] I'm I might be bitter but I'm rightly so
[1:39:03] because this one didn't me wrong let's
[1:39:05] recognize it let's recognize you can't
[1:39:07] brother brandom says overcoming he
[1:39:09] continues on to say and then to overcome
[1:39:12] he you got to know he's a devil he's
[1:39:14] against you then to overcome recognize
[1:39:17] him know he's a devil you must recognize
[1:39:20] that God in you is greater and mightier
[1:39:23] than he is then the one that is in you
[1:39:26] has already overcome him and by his
[1:39:29] grace oh I just love that by his grace
[1:39:33] you're more than more than a match for
[1:39:34] him amen real overcoming when you
[1:39:38] recognize so we don't just got to
[1:39:40] recognize God but we got to recognize
[1:39:42] the enemies after us let's bow our heads
[1:39:49] tonight dear heavenly father
[1:39:52] father Lord there's a sweet spirit in
[1:39:54] the building tonight
[1:39:56] father Lord we're not just recognizing
[1:39:59] and identifying the word for this
[1:40:01] generation but we're identifying the
[1:40:03] tactics of the
[1:40:04] enemy Lord maybe there's somebody here
[1:40:07] that are struggling with bitterness Lord
[1:40:09] may they identify it so that they can
[1:40:12] overcome Lord may they identify it not
[1:40:15] justify it but identify it Lord as we're
[1:40:19] searching our hearts tonight if there's
[1:40:21] anything that is not of you Lord maybe
[1:40:25] recognize it and say Lord I'm not happy
[1:40:28] with it I don't want that in my life I
[1:40:30] don't want that in my home I don't want
[1:40:31] that in my spirit I don't want that
[1:40:33] among my
[1:40:34] children but I want I want exploits I
[1:40:38] want exploits in my family's life I want
[1:40:40] exploits in my SP my
[1:40:42] spouse but Lord if it takes recognizing
[1:40:46] the spirits of the enemy Lord may we
[1:40:47] recognize it we ask these things in your
[1:40:50] pray precious name amen Jesus overcoming
[1:40:54] is the
[1:40:56] recognize the other day I was I was
[1:41:00] studying on these things and I was in my
[1:41:02] house and I was studying then Ethan my
[1:41:05] little boy he had some rain boots and he
[1:41:07] was right there beside beside where I
[1:41:09] was studying he was crying he had his
[1:41:11] shoes on the wrong feet and he was
[1:41:13] trying to he was stomping his feet
[1:41:15] crying and I looked at him I said Ethan
[1:41:18] your shoes on the wrong feet want me to
[1:41:19] help you no no no it's okay I'm watching
[1:41:23] he's crying he's trying as hardest to
[1:41:25] put this his shoe on his boot but it was
[1:41:28] never going to work because he couldn't
[1:41:31] recognize he was doing it the wrong way
[1:41:34] and something just spoke to me and many
[1:41:36] time we're trying to get Victory but
[1:41:38] fail to recognize we can't overcome
[1:41:42] because we're entertaining bitterness we
[1:41:44] can't overcome because we're
[1:41:46] entertaining backbiting we're justifying
[1:41:48] this we're justifying that and we're
[1:41:51] trying to cram victory in her life and
[1:41:53] God is saying you're doing it wrong
[1:41:56] recognize it you're doing it wrong let
[1:41:58] me help you but Ethan could have
[1:42:01] recognized he was doing it wrong if he
[1:42:03] could have just recognized I was a
[1:42:05] helping hand that can help him and oh
[1:42:09] man maybe you've been trying to get the
[1:42:11] victory just recognize look into your
[1:42:13] heart maybe you've allowed Spirits into
[1:42:16] your home maybe that's the reason why
[1:42:18] you haven't seen your house on fire you
[1:42:20] want to see your homes on fire maybe we
[1:42:22] need to recognize some
[1:42:24] Spirits you want to see rebellious
[1:42:27] children come home maybe we've let some
[1:42:29] Spirits in I was working on my house the
[1:42:32] other day I was doing some
[1:42:34] tile and I don't know if anybody's ever
[1:42:36] done to before but it's very aggravating
[1:42:39] you do the grout and you take a sponge
[1:42:41] and you get a wet sponge and you're
[1:42:43] you're you're cleaning up all the grout
[1:42:45] you dip in a buckle of water you clean
[1:42:47] up the grout and I did my tole over and
[1:42:49] over and over and it was still dirty and
[1:42:52] I thought I was getting aggravated and
[1:42:54] something hit me like I said my mind's
[1:42:56] always going I was dumping out the
[1:42:58] bucket of water and it was dirty and I
[1:43:01] thought my it wasn't the sponge's fault
[1:43:03] it was the environment that he was in
[1:43:05] and I thought my sometimes it ain't the
[1:43:07] children's fault that they're rebellious
[1:43:09] and they they're born with a carnal
[1:43:11] nature but sometimes it's the
[1:43:13] environment we put them in maybe our
[1:43:15] home lives but I had to recognize in
[1:43:18] order for that sponge to get clean and
[1:43:20] clean other things are to empty out the
[1:43:22] environment and maybe we need to
[1:43:24] recognize that our environment's dirty
[1:43:26] you want to see children doing exploits
[1:43:29] maybe we need to recognize that our
[1:43:30] environment's
[1:43:32] dirty can you sing a song

[1:47:26] this
[1:47:27] moment I love how the Lord took and
[1:47:29] brought so many different
[1:47:32] examples down to show us and minister to
[1:47:37] us so many things to show us that the
[1:47:40] real Simplicity of the Gospel it's God
[1:47:45] wanting just to be preeminent present in
[1:47:48] every part of our life
[1:47:51] in every phase of our life it's always
[1:47:53] inviting him into today and I I think of
[1:47:57] that simple simple part of recognizing
[1:48:02] him brother Josh when he mentioned that
[1:48:06] that when they were
[1:48:07] walking before they ever got in to that
[1:48:11] little room with
[1:48:13] them what started it was they invited
[1:48:17] him and when you invite him he's the
[1:48:20] only one that can turn situations that
[1:48:23] look
[1:48:24] hopeless Darkness to light he's the only
[1:48:27] one that can take things that you or I
[1:48:31] could try to solve out in our
[1:48:33] mind and we'll never be able to do it in
[1:48:36] our mind on our own amen but you just
[1:48:40] invite him he's the same one that turned
[1:48:43] the water into wine he's the same one
[1:48:45] that brought the bread the man in the
[1:48:47] wilderness he's the same God who brought
[1:48:49] the water out of the rock it's just that
[1:48:52] simple to believe God for what he has
[1:48:56] said I was reading a little something
[1:48:59] today and it struck me I was it was in
[1:49:00] my devotion and then I went back to it
[1:49:03] afterwards it's just the simple part
[1:49:05] about obedience and when God had told
[1:49:07] Israel there will not be any Mana fall
[1:49:10] on the seventh day but on the sixth day
[1:49:13] there'll be a double
[1:49:14] portion so don't go out on the seventh
[1:49:16] and expect to find any because God drops
[1:49:19] on the sixth enough to carry us through
[1:49:22] the seventh clear to the first day but
[1:49:27] the Bible says there were some who went
[1:49:28] out on the seventh day and the Very
[1:49:31] things that God said is how long will
[1:49:35] this people refuse my
[1:49:39] Commandments you notice how the spirit
[1:49:41] of the Lord turned right around here
[1:49:42] even at the end of it just dealing with
[1:49:44] that of the part of just responding and
[1:49:46] taking the word of God in it just goes
[1:49:49] to show us it's simple
[1:49:53] obedience and just simply obeying just
[1:49:56] taking God at his word don't try to
[1:49:57] figure it out that was said tonight over
[1:49:59] and over just take God at his word
[1:50:03] that's what faith brother Joshua was
[1:50:05] preaching that it's faith we accept
[1:50:08] these things by faith it's not because
[1:50:12] we know it it's not because well I've
[1:50:15] proved it with this scripture I see this
[1:50:16] scripture this scripture this scripture
[1:50:18] this scripture that you could know all
[1:50:19] of that
[1:50:20] and still not accept it by faith but to
[1:50:23] accept it by faith is because he said so
[1:50:27] and I know him that God is not a man
[1:50:30] that he should lie I know every promise
[1:50:33] that God has said I that's a place of
[1:50:36] certainty you know there's no other
[1:50:38] place in this world that you can have
[1:50:39] that kind of certainty there's no word
[1:50:42] of any politician no word of any boss
[1:50:45] I'm not saying there's not good bosses
[1:50:47] but you can't have that kind of
[1:50:48] certainty because somebody above that
[1:50:49] boss can come around and say hey sorry
[1:50:51] we got to do this we got to change this
[1:50:53] around and immediately a guy that might
[1:50:56] have been your buddy or your friend or
[1:50:57] somebody you had a lot of confidence in
[1:50:59] you realize there's a higher word than
[1:51:00] them but there's no higher word no
[1:51:02] higher authority than God himself and
[1:51:06] that's what this message has unfolded to
[1:51:09] you and I it has revealed the Living God
[1:51:13] of his word that we can have a
[1:51:16] confidence no matter what situation no
[1:51:19] matter what the need is he's still the
[1:51:21] almighty God and it just starts with
[1:51:24] just inviting him in just invite him in
[1:51:28] just invite him take the situation
[1:51:30] whatever the need is in your life invite
[1:51:33] God in even the bucket of water that
[1:51:35] brother Joshua was talking about invite
[1:51:37] God in because he's the one that can
[1:51:40] tell you hey get that dirty water out of
[1:51:41] here you know you can I said this to you
[1:51:44] many times my dad you remember many
[1:51:46] times my dad in the last years that he
[1:51:48] was with us I would walk we had a door
[1:51:51] between our offices I would walk over to
[1:51:53] his office and you know my dad he was
[1:51:56] sitting there and he said he was sick he
[1:51:58] was sick and I said Dad what's wrong he
[1:52:02] said Sam he said I'm just I'm sick I
[1:52:05] said well let's pray we would pray and
[1:52:09] it may not have been right then but it
[1:52:11] might have been after I was out here
[1:52:13] ministering a little bit and you
[1:52:15] remember how he would come and sit down
[1:52:16] sometimes he'd come sit down up front
[1:52:17] right
[1:52:18] here God would lift what was going on
[1:52:22] and touch him but it kept on happening
[1:52:24] over and over again and you know what it
[1:52:26] was it was a certain medication he was
[1:52:29] taking that was making him sick now God
[1:52:32] kept on touching him God kept on moving
[1:52:34] for him but eventually we had to get
[1:52:37] down to figure out what's the cause of
[1:52:39] it and I'm glad that we have a god a
[1:52:44] living God Among Us that not only lifts
[1:52:48] lifts our cares when we're in the
[1:52:50] presence of God but he can go down and
[1:52:51] say you're giving too much time here
[1:52:54] you're neglecting here we need to we
[1:52:56] need to get the dirty water out I'm glad
[1:53:01] all it starts with is just inviting him
[1:53:04] I I don't know but no about you but I
[1:53:06] want to invite him I always want to
[1:53:08] invite him I want this word that I've
