around 1984 I went with brother J's Browning to Honduras for the first time and we went out in I would say not in the countryside and browning priest some messages there didn't interpret at that time but but things happen the sisters did cook some forward with their pastors and upset their stomach my brother Bronte was also an upset stomach I mean they were going through a tremendous time well the brother that I was with he forgot to put gas in them and it in the pickup truck we headed back to the church it was about 11 o'clock at night and about five in the morning I woke up with painting with stomach they have ounces outhouses there so I made my way to their outhouse I was there sitting and all sudden somebody wants to get in it was with a browning his stomach was upset so I got out and I went to a place real close to the building I backed up to this building and it was just get to be daylight and there's a young Honduran walking by and I just said hello to him then I'll say this until the day I die all the sudden to my right there came the supernatural being he was all a pillar of fire but do you see the outline of a man and I just looked at that and I and all sudden it was daylight but the brownie was in there and they come running to me to get me from her the brownie the American American some wrong I ran into the house little little adobe house and he told me let tell them to let me go we went on into the capital and he preached a tremendous messages later I kept one day I was talking to brother browning and I say you don't know Ronnie what happened that day I see that supernatural be say brother brawny it burn burn I said bill I told the Lord I asked a little Lord you brought me here to preach to your children I need a healing touch all of a sudden he said there was like somebody for hire walks him quacks over him and he was healed I'll never forget that day I never forget those things that God has done in our lives how could we [Music] so that was an experience that I had and I just kept in my mind to saying you know he is I think one more song about Sango come listening victory of Jesus I was naked day [Music] heard about it [Music] my man and [Music] me with me three Navy [Music] Oh victory that together there's a Patrick um I heard about his baby oven mystic power [Music] victory my sake [Music] and he bought me [Music] I heard about

that sit in snares often take us unaware and our hearts are made to bleed for many thoughtless word or deed when we try to do out there but we're by with the boys [Music] we overcome and will hey man go ahead play one time [Music] Oh [Music] bah bah Oh hallelujah glory be to God you believe that amen we a lot of things we don't understand we don't have to understand it we just have to know in whom we have believed and know that and be persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed against that day amen don't you love the Lord this morning it's so good to see each and every one of you and how you came out on this nice cool brisk morning I guess the one thing we can take positive out of it here you know as God made a way for us to be a church and just trusting that even within this here it makes a way for germs to get killed is that right amen we need that we need that cold weather and you know how I am my wife after the young people had left on Friday evening from the youth meeting there you know it started to snow I don't know what time it was thankfully they had we had kept it in that way they could get on the road and get home but my goodness we when it started snowing I just turned the lights off and I just sit there and from the window I love it I know some of you all don't like that but I love the snow and that's why we're different but didn't if something is so special of the grace of God in our hearts that is the same amen I I just enjoy it now one of the reasons I enjoy the snow and you and most of you know this as well because I lie I don't like the darkness and when you do that when it's snowing it's just lit up it's one thing I miss about the steel mill when they would let those things off the sky was just being lit up you know I remember his boys we could go out and play football right about 11 o'clock at night he was just lit up in the sky you know and I just I like the snow when I look out and I can see the light and things like that so that wasn't very spiritual but I just thought I'd share that but you know there's always a part in that snow you know that we look for and and there's always a need you think of seeds that's been planted even what they call winter wheat it's needs a little thin blanket of snow to be able to cover it because that thin blanket of snow it actually it keeps it warm and then that moisture will settle in there and you know when you look at that snow see it might change your attitude or might change your outlook on snow when you look at that snow it's as white as white as can be and he said though your sins be as scarlet they shall be whiter than snow so God just drops the snow every once in a while brother Joshua I know that didn't happen in the Congo but yet you see it here he drops it every once in a while for you just to remind you your sins that were scarlet they're whiter than amen don't you love the Lord amen he took Joel one day and separated Jobe when Jove thought why is this going on why is this taking place and and God just let him know so wait a minute here step back here who is the one that puts the clouds up there who's the one that watches over the water and the moisture and all of that you know he just he gave job a little bit of a direction in his life brother Carlos to let Jobe know I'm over it all that really brings the rest to a believer donut man just so glad to be in the house of the Lord but the Doug that doesn't count against my time ministering now that was just to kind of relax a little bit and then good to have each and every one of you you know we've posted there about the fellowship dinner and we had cancelled that there on Thursday so Lord willing we'll look at it see how everything looks for February I think the one in February were there and is it wasn't February 16th you know the day before President's Day a man well we're just glad to be here in the house of the Lord let's look here in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 musicians thank you a man see some out there and some of you that's been out with sickness and we just asked the Lord of just just be with them and touch each and every one of you 2nd Timothy chapter 4 verse 6 we want to start right there here this morning and Paul would write like this in second Timothy 4:6 for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand now to think of it the cup Paul comes in in his life in verse seven I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing let's just ask his blessing on the word if you have a need on your heart you want to make known to the Lord and say Lord remember the need NEADS Lord Jesus we we love you lord thank you Lord that you made a way that we can be in the house of God this morning Lord we know that even as is expressed in the Book of Revelations that Lord he that would even read and hear the words of this prophecy is blessed and father we're here this morning Lord this in our hearts is more than just coming to serve a duty Lord it's more than just it being Sunday and here we are Lord our hearts there's a desire within our hearts to draw closer to you Lord we want more of you and we want to give more of ourselves for we realize Lord that in this place Lord you have given us that you would come and meet with this Lord Lord we want to be we want to be changed we believe God than the effect of your word it's a living word the Lord when it moves into our hearts it Lord it becomes an expression in our life that Lord where the word that was on paper it becomes flesh Lord and Lord it moves within our lives when we go back to our homes back to our jobs and everything and you know every test and every trial you know everything behind every hand and you know even everything that we will face Lord and Lord we're depending on you we asked that Lord that you would come and minister to every need minister to every heart Lord and father when we would lord it when the service is commenced Lord may it be God that from our hearts we can say didn't on our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way the Lord you're the one that we need to hear from and Lord we just ask that you Lord would come Lord and speak to us Lord just as you spoke Lord to Adam and Eve in the beginning just as you spoke to Abraham just as you spoke Lord to each and every one of your children Oh God come speak lip to ear to our hearts Lord may the Spirit of Truth Lord just minister to every life in a personal way I pray O God may you just Lord take control completely father of my being and every being that's here Lord we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you as you're being seated as we were looking at Abraham last week and we were dealing with the thought of giving my all and dealing with that from numbers 15 where we are brought into this land and God himself has made a way that we can come in he has delivered us and brought us in as the scripture says in the beginning of the book of Colossians he has delivered us from the kingdom of darkness and we have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son our lives are truly a work of Almighty God and when we we look at the scope of everything across stit and you I think even of last week that as you evaluate and allow the Holy Spirit just to move upon our hearts I certainly believe that how God was speaking to our hearts last week and I believe this is something he continues and it wants to draw from our life and that's to give our all and you know the reality when you look at Abraham's life and you take the scope of Abraham's life from Genesis 11 all the way through Genesis 22 what you find is you find as a life that God has spoke to and that life continues to surrender the surrendering never stops the trust never stops the trust itself just becomes greater and to think of how that God would lay this example out every one of us that are gathered here this morning if God has spoke to your heart every one of us fall somewhere along the way from Genesis 11 through Genesis 22 and to recognize that with within it that every promise that God has made when God has made you and I promise that promise it God's desire is that it would find its mark in our heart not in our mind first yes our mind you know we could receive it here in our mind but it must drop down into the depths of our soul you know brother Brandon would talk about in the message Shalom and he would talk about Judas he said Judas had the light up here but he said the light never got down here when the light when the light or the word has come down here it is something that just so completely expresses itself but yet if we look back into Abraham's life in Genesis 11 though we may not see any movement within Abraham's life as far as God has spoke to him but we don't see any movement out of the earth Cal DS and then the latter part of Genesis 11 here he comes to Iran and yet he still not come into the land or to where God would show him I will show you this land but yet but yet if we can and I believe we to understand this by God's grace before Abraham ever packed one box to leave the earth caddy already in his heart he made a decision Abraham wasn't following anybody else he was following the voice that spoke to his heart so before he ever impacto or they got their house and everything before that ever happening it started in the heart and that's that's exactly where it starts and that's exactly where it continues to unfold is in the heart what we look at every one of us have the desire and the aim that we are called to in this age as Genesis 22 to where God would require of everything of the promise he's given you and I when he gave Abraham Isaac and I and Abraham took Isaac and he went up there and he offered him up he gave all from what God had given him and that's the way that when we look at a life and if I can and I and I pray that it is just is so simple to our hearts and that is that in our lives that let us be sensitive to and and welcome the Lord to say Lord and I want to give my all and that friends that's not something that it's just as though Abraham you know made a quantum leap from Genesis 11 to 22 there were many adversities many misfortunes there were misunderstandings that Abraham himself had in regards to the promise but because the promise was a revelation in his heart revelation holds within it prevailing power it prevailed over every one of the misunderstandings that were there Abraham chose day after day moment after moment to focus out all unbelief and focus on the Living God Abraham didn't know how was going to happen he just simply knew gone made the promise and I'm trusting in him and Abraham's trust did not wane it grew greater to a place to her Abraham was willing to give his all and God knew he would give his long but God wanted it to be displayed this is where what God has sown within our hearts it must come forth there's just so much that just grasp grips my heart within that that that chapter for you for for some years it just things he just meditated you keep coming back to that place because Genesis 22 is is a very when you look at the the prophets ministry it would he would bring us into this place and keep bringing us to Jehovah Jireh keep bringing us to that place why because it is the Lord providing for himself how in the world could you and I live this word without God providing for himself a life think his his word has already been sold within our hearts that seed was already there but how could the sea come forth unless there was quickening power of his life to come to release what's inside of you and I it couldn't happen without God himself and when God makes a promise remember when God makes a promise it is God his word isn't oath it is God binding himself God committing himself and I when you think of it like that God's word that goes out it's God committing himself I say let that same life live inside of me to her I'm committed to that word just as God has been committed to that word nothing else will do nothing else will do Genesis 2010 this is where we're at this is where we're at this is the promise of the rapture this is what the church has long for remember the promise of the coming Sun there's got to be something that that life that can be offered up to God it could not be offered in any other age it was all going to make the whole body of Jesus Christ now it comes into that place for the entire body of Jesus Christ for the fullness of the Holy Spirit to come into the Church of the Living God you realize this is the promise we're in when we're talking about the message of the hour we're talking about the revealing of the Son of Man Christ Himself coming fully into his church Jesus is not going to marry and he will not marry nor take a bride in rapture that's a halfway bride he's coming for a fully mature woman and the maturity is a maturity of that word life inside of you and I that word life that brings the harmony that I can do nothing of myself but what I see the father doing that doeth the son likewise here is Paul you know I then their life after life that we can take within that because that we can show lives that were offered up the scriptures speaker that Hebrews 11 takes the account of every one of them who we would call heroes of faith they offered their lives they sacrificed and they gave why because of him he became their all-in-all Paul makes a statement you know we could very well read this text and have and funerals and to think of it in one way this morning it would be good to preach some funerals it would be good to preach some funerals where lives come to their end you might say brother Samuel I'm not fit to die right now if you're not fit to die you're not fit to live but when you're fit to live in you're fit to die you see within it live it's not just something that we wait to the deathbed but it's where in our lives right now that there is a commitment that is made to the Lord a surrender that is made to God and we're reading here of a life that has come to it's coming to its end when Paul could and I think this is something when we look at these are not just words to us but where Paul could write in this manner I'm now ready to be offered that speaks of a confidence there was a confidence about his life I'm ready to be offered up that word offered up means for my life to be poured out as a drink offering the time of my departure is at hand he goes on as we read here I've fought the good fight so it wasn't something easy what happened in Paul's life it had to be greater than Paul's self-will because there'd be a lot of adversity there'd be a lot of temptations there'd be a lot of things come at him that would shake him to his core there would be there would be engagements that he would have to engage in listen to me the engagements fighting a good fight was not fighting with others it was even the wrestling and overcoming of his own will because our biggest enemy we've got is our own self I fought a good fight think of this these portions of Scripture right here where it is wrote you can read it when you get home Paul is testifying that he says Dimas having loved this present world hath forsaken me Paul had to be he had to be he was moved in a matter think of it Paul was a man look at his life let's just look at him in the natural he was a man that when Paul believes something he believed it now let's just look at that when he believed it he believed it when he was taught he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees Paul near the scripture knew the law knew the prophets he knew all those things and Paul himself he persecuted the Church of the Living God he took him out of their homes they slaughtered and killed him Paul even stood there and he held the coats of those who stoned Stephen behind brother branham metallicy said when he stood there holding those coats he said there was something he saw and he witnessed there in Stephens life he said it never got away from him you see Paul had all the knowledge but he didn't know the Lord he had all the scriptures Ollie he memorized it maybe Paul had the scars on the sunday-school charts but he didn't know the Lord hallelujah that's why he was up swimming and standing against it he didn't know the Lord but this is what I want you to catch remember we said his natural makeup and Paul believed something he believed it are you listening now but when he met that pillar fire on the road to Damascus there was something that went deeper than his natural ability Paul believed what he believed that's true but brother this was divine revelation the Hall was no longer walking just by written word he now was moved by the will of God and that's what calls caused people to call him a heretic that's why he could stand in front of the gripper in the way that's called heresy so worship I the God of my father's you see this is what it is he was worshipping God he was giving his all because God had revealed himself to Paul personally here the will of God was revealed think about it Paul had pressure all around you can read through the book of Acts where Paul would have pressure all around him even where Paul in one point in the scripture was wanting to know do I go should we go into Asia do we go at this time knowing knowing that it was God's will to take the gospel to the Gentiles but Paul did not take things for granted and say we go here we go here and we go here but the Bible says even when he came to a place in his life the Bible said he is seyd and that were to say in the Bible means he tested he tested to see is this God's will and you remember that night the Holy Spirit the angel the Lord he came to him in a dream gave him a dream there you hear a man in the minute garb of Masand Macedonia and speaking in Batman that way Paul would know as the man would speak in a dream come come to us and he would know at this time this is the will of God Paul was a man that when we see it was something greater than his natural ability I've had times or heard people say or when this person believes something they really believe it it's going to take more than your natural ability you'll never endure with just your natural ability I've heard people tell me and even this recently better sender I've never backed down from a challenge I've always been stubborn within that you're bragging on your first birth it is not your first birth nor my first birth that receives any glory hallelujah God will call wise men but not Paul said not many God will choose this is the scripture you know many of the poor and of the weak those who say lord I need your help I can't find my own way even in what I'm praying for do I take this job or do I take that job do I go here do I go there Lord I can't find my own way I need your leadership there's a lot written within this story I have fought a good fight of faith to wear even Dimas Dimas was so troubled the Bible said he loved this present world brother bastard Dimas he said he didn't go out and be in and start running nightclubs brother Brandon would take it you follow me now you know I've preached on this in present stage of my ministry he would even take it and say that he said now Dimas was a spirit-filled man but spirit-filled we're not itself come on friends that's why it's got to go deeper than just on the flesh or just in our mind it's gotta become a revelation when it becomes a revelation there's a uniting that takes place hallelujah neither things present nor things to come can ever separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus my Lord and I am persuaded of that when Dimas would you know a poem do you think Paul didn't know this when he said having loved this present world guerrillas there's worldly thinking in the Bible the same messenger right here Paul he would write in the opening of Romans and speak of how the carnal mind is enmity to the spiritual mind Dimas was mind was how in the world can this man be one that's used to pray for the sick and the sick is healed and he leaves trophies up there sick in Mullane Meletis how could how can he leave somebody who's been so faithful to him how can he leave him sick and this man who has a ministry that everyone would love and he only has one coat what is that worldly thinking worldly thinking reasoning you realize this world the framework the framework of this world the framework of it is not the product of the faith of God this world and you can see how its crumbling it is the product of reasoning reasoning cannot spend the test this is why we need divine revelation and divine revelation stands even when we don't have an answer here but there's an answer there that justice stand that's the power of divine revelation I've fought a good fight he had to over flap you think Dimas wasn't sitting there in the meetings look how brother branham with dramatizes you'd realize friends there's things I preached I've preached right through critical spirits where things have come and has just sent and been critical and you have to you know what you have to do or bypass it pick out somebody who's really feeding on the Word of God and preach to him you have to go beyond because a critical spirit won't receive nothing from God come on somebody and I'll tell you it's it's that serious you think that Paul didn't didn't deal with that criticism that was coming his way here he is preaching divine healing and he packs a physician with him by the name of Luke hmm wow he really believes in the power of God takes his youngins to the doctor when they're sick come on friends but what Dimas what Dimas failed in is because Dimas was looking at it through his own eyes but let's get back to Paul Paul by God's grace overcame that he didn't try to say Themis let's sit down and let me have a conversation with you I will be able to persuade you listen flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God and Jesus said flesh and blood had not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven when it's become a revelation you have heard directly from Almighty God where my pastor said you got to hear directly from God your pastor will be a man of God yielding of God but you've got to hear directly from God for yourself well my husband or my this note you gotta hear personally and Jesus networking jammed up no drop calls on Jesus Network it ain't 3G 4G 4G it's all G it's all God [Applause] yes sir brother ho mile we could really preach on that a little bit man I fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness and then watch this because Paul realized this is revelation what is given to him was has it's given out remember Paul said you are in 2nd Corinthians 3 you are that revelation that's been wrote in our heart Paul remember he was going to say we preach not ourselves preaching self is Satan's Eden I get results and I get this this is why brother Graham said in Satan's Eden he said his messenger Satan's want to establish themselves in the hearts of the people but God's servants want to see Christ established in the heart of the believer hallelujah I fought a good fight man you know these verses of Scripture here I it's almost hard for me to preach from him because this is my daddy I teased him so much I said when you're gonna preach from another text my dad preached from this text so much but you know what he lived it and I wouldn't tease him in a bad way you know I just had ways he and I could just you know kind of tease a little bit here and there but when I look at it as it said which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day look at this confidence this was confidence but it wasn't not confidence as far as within himself when Paul could say I have you know Paul is looking at the grace of God that has brought this to pass in my life and Paul could no you know brother Greg Paul could realize that God would use the agency of man but it didn't need those intellect he just needed Paul to be healed it and when Paul could see that out working of that life in his life that's how Paul had confidence he confidence in the outworking of the life that was within him I have finished my course literature there were no doubt some things were Paul as he would say in the scripture I got to die daily there are some things replied to say that I forgive me is that right but he had to have confidence in the working of that life within his life and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing we're looking for his coming but we're living in his appearing his appearing is where he would reveal and make himself known by the promise of the word that is ordained for this hour are you with me that's his appearing to think how that God would appear and make it real to our hearts this is the promise of the hour you can't have the advent of the coming of the Lord Jesus in his first coming without without that of Isaiah and Malachi 3 the promise that was made for John the Baptist you can't have it without that Advent it's part the Advent goes together that's the same way in this hour behold I will send unto you Elijah the Prophet you can't have the second coming and deny the advent of the Prophet messenger can't do it because listen in order to be ready for his coming we must be prepared that's why we'll take greater than the mind of a man this message is not the intellect of brother Branham this message is the SAP of Holy Spirit from the throne of God so much so in Revelations 18 1 when the Bible says that there was a great angel that came down revelations 18 1 after these say and the earth was lightened with his glory what is that the coming of the Son of Man the visit of the Holy Ghost to the Church of the Living God and when that messenger sounded on earth the prophet said it echoed in heaven he said what it was is that messenger was so inclined with God to when he spoke heaven echoed it heaven one plan takes the message from the throne of God has come down to this earth for an in kind people but you and I might have the same assurance that Paul had I have kept the faith I've run the course and I love his appearing [Music] love his appearing not just I love all the miracles I don't know that all comes with me but it's love his appearing too many times people have just been caught up with the aurora or the all that surrounds the message instead of receiving the message the revelation of it they've been caught up with just that part of signs and wonders and miracles but they never realized a sign only lets you know and point you to something I mean when I Drive down the road and I'm going somewhere I know I got my GPS but I like signs - I like signs when I look at it it says especially if it says you know good eats on this exit here come in and get some of our country cooking Cracker Barrel and you come into that and you know you've got that gravy and biscuits up there and this is 143 B I know I'm there mile markers on the side of the road if it says 156 I can do a little bit of math right then no problem 156 minus 143 that's 13 miles right on up the road think I can make it what is what I'm trying to say signs are not for decorations signs are to point us to a living reality hallelujah how good use that messenger is God's desire to use every one of us as his children he don't need another prophet he just needs lives that just has like the Prophet would say now you know I'm waiting on something I don't know where to take this job or this shot you know I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on him that's the exact pole and then starts to talk I'm just trying to catch your spirit and then the vision breaks it's all an example to us haha well we're gonna get somewhere and even cut off the text no grandma says listen a message absolute brother sister I'm telling you I've said this for years but it becomes more real the titles of these messages are not just titles they are declarations and they are announcements an absolute brother Brandon would pick that up killing showing us through the scriptures we can see it all of those who live down through the scriptures they had an absolute they had something that was greater in them that would cause them to walk this way and not walk this way and brother Adam would say it like this it's one of those messages he would say this he had a purpose in saving me he had a purpose in saving you and I'm determined by his will look at this by his will to do his will the reason he done it I don't know why he done it but not to add to or to take from it revelation 22:19 said don't do it if he's our absolute it cannot be otherwise there is no way for it to be otherwise he's got to be the absolute the last word think of this you know there were millions in sin when I got saved he had a purpose in saving me I'm the oddball amongst the Brethren many times I believe in predestination seeded a serpent bad times in the name of Jesus Christ all these other things the visions the power of Christ returned back and condemning organizations and things I'm the oddball but he had a reason to save me a purpose for doing it he saved me when there was millions of others in sin but he saved me for some reason now sisters how many of you have ever had your husband by you some sort of a kitchen utensil inst apart slow-cooker mr. Marriott sister mercy shaking her head frying pan cast-iron pan maybe something go good with the cornbread just you know I'm talking about some you why would he do that what'd he do would he buy you that just so that it would just be simply hung up on the wall or just set it right there on the counter well we can hang it up over the stove no it was purchased and delivered because he wants you to use that maybe it will help in your meal prep he may not even know what kind of Mills are gonna come out of the crock-pot insta pot or whatever in the world it is he may not know he just knows this is something that gets you no food can be made in and and I like food I know it's a very simple example its carnal but you know what God used Paul to make connections with things so that we could understand God did not save you nor me for no reason there's a purpose he had God didn't just speak to your heart and you're sitting here this morning just just by chance it's no grotzinger god don't work that way there's a reason there's a purpose and it's something to move within our hearts that if God had a purpose in saving me I want to be determined to fulfill that purpose by his will then we look at this they were educated man there were smart men there were theologians there were bishops and doctors and so forth in the field when he saved me but he saved me for some reason in other words there could have been people that had more knowledge of the scripture better educated could pronounce their words better but God didn't save them he saved you God's not interested in highlighting human ability God wants to highlight himself in our lives the dream goes on to say that he keeps on high he had a reason for it and I'm determined to hold that reason no matter what anybody else says I don't disfellowship him don't discredit him but I know what I'm tied to you know what you're tired too he wanted me like this he had me like this I was made like that for a purpose I had to be made up of all these qualities and so forth and all these no accounts so he could dig it out of me and put something in there that was his word and I'm determined I'll know nothing else but Christ sometimes that determination we want to grow but we need to also say stay is simple in determination you ever take like a little kid and here they are you know in the hot chair think I know because I had a few of them there in the hot chair some a little bit more strong wielding others but you have them in a high chair and you give a little something right right they can't chocolate and you're about ready to lay hands you know that what you're giving them they don't want it but there's something that they walked maybe won the spaghetti maybe it's the buttered roll they might have had a taste of it and they liked it hmm then you bring that out determination they saw something that they wanted they were determined to get it a little kid a little baby like that how much more for our lives we know what it means to be in the will of God we know what it means to feel the power of God and the glory of God we know what it means for him to speak to our hearts and that's why with anything else could count we can say because why there's something we have tasted out and the rest of the world has lost its grip [Applause] there's something greater that touches a lie like the captain when they would come into this Harbor many ships wrecked because women would come out on the shore scandal addressed and they would sing and they would lose sight of their course and turn the ship in and they would crash upon the rocks and the only reason those women came out there skandhas Lee dress is to cause the ship carrying the treasure to wreck so that there were those waiting in the rocks that could come and relieve that ship wreck of its treasure they would tie that captain up and plug the years of every one of those shipmates he was to turn and turn him but they had been silenced to that request the man got off the ship to one day and will suddenly heard some other music he turned and he walked to that music was right in a church singing Amazing Grace or whatever the songs were God done something in his life never gonna have to sail that way again are you hearing me they were gonna have to go back to that job go back to the school go back among the family they're gonna have to go that same way when they came up that pathway in that course the makes SP hey captain do we need to tie you up and put the ear said no sir you don't got do that no more he said I'd done her music that's better than more beautiful than that he heard music that wasn't gonna wreck his here our music that would bring him safely home and that's what it is for the night I'm telling you that is the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul would say it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth inside of me let me just refer to a few places Jesus standing in the temple he looks upon over at the Treasury where they would come in and they would deposit and he looks and he points out to the disciples look at this little widow woman she gave two months and Jesus could say she has given more than all the rich let's just put this in layman terms she gave let's say two dollars let's say ten dollars but here the rich they put in a hundred dollars well when we're looking at just the calculations the rich put in more by calculations but Jesus was looking more than just what was given out here he was looking at where was it given from the rich gave more out here but when it came from here she gave more than the rich that's mark 12 Jesus said she gave of her what you understand what that means she could add she could have used that $10 it would have made me made things a little bit more comfortable for her and there's things that you and I can hold back on God not just with money but our time our lives you know I've you know I've I've repented you know have you been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'm not trying to get you to get works up through us through a church I'm talking friends it's got to come to where you don't just stop somewhere you've got to keep going the biggest curse is to get in your mind I've made it that's a curse because we become complacent and the things that you escaped it begins to overtake you and go on here in the scripture showing how Paul had that kind of an attitude where have you been where you had where are you moving are you moving on with the Lord you say why do you say it because I'm telling you the rapture is upon us halfway living in and out and every thought going in a rapture not going interruptions to be living for his coming come on somebody is living for his coming where everybody knows everybody knows you're living for the coming of the Lord she gave her all she didn't hold back in one area it goes deeper because sometimes when you touch on that and you touch on things sometimes you know in your sin are our own carnality instead of recognizing the word as a vision and say oh yeah well that was a great salvation message you missed it you missed it even if last Sunday you thought that was a great salvation that you missed it it wasn't about that God just happened to break over in those areas it was about you and I giving our all not becoming complacent well I know the message you know and I can quote this quote and I know this this and I do this and I do that it's more than that it's where your life is wrapped up in Jesus Christ hallelujah the scripture would say it like this this is challenging to all of our hearts that's it is challenging to all of our hearts this is why Jesus could say don't lay up for yourselves treasures on this earth it decays you can give yourself to such things of this earth wait a few years it'll be on the curve second week of the month if you live in Lorraine what you labor for work for it nothing wrong with you understand it ain't nothing wrong with that of the furniture but it's the part that things that things that people will value and labor for and pour out their lives the puck corners here save here they'll give here how hard we can't go there no no we can't well peace and hot what would you have huh you know well we got to make a payment on this right here so let's do this they will put such value on things of this earth and yet things of their soul they'll take so for granted well I mean you know if we don't go to church I mean you know God understands he's a great big God Jehovah job is gonna come down and provide rapture force you know he's just gonna take us no he's not no he's not I said no it's not no he's not God's not gonna do that they not up for your tread self treasures on this earth but lay up treasures in heaven this is a very scripture that most of us would know you know him from Sunday School where your treasure is house the rest of it go there were your heart be also you ever had somebody and maybe as a coach or somebody they can sit there and look at them or you can look at your kids if you're privileged to have them home school or you can look at other things in their life and say you ain't given your all or the coach or somebody else a put your heart in it put your heart in it you know if that means you put your all in it you put your heart in it you're pouring yourself in it hallelujah this is why when the scripture he would be very clearly there is nothing we brought into this world and we're not gonna take nothing out of it hey man this is why even you know the admonition where even as the Prophet would speak of this in spiritual food and due season and he would mention to you and I regarding what God has done in this hour and he would say I want you to get built up in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour and they just say this is plain as simple as I can say it you need to be listening to the message of the hour you need to be feeding on that word there's no right now of everything that we have at our disposal there's absolutely no excuse we're both Simon I'm reading a book on Finney you need to be giving yourself to the message of the hour Finney is not the messenger for this hour you can read something there on the side but you need to give your all to this it's going to take look at this it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up we want to look like we said we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you've seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it be of God or not accumulate it the messages that God brings right here is the same inspiration that God has given in this out without the message I have nothing to preach there is nothing to preach this Bible this Bible wonderful the Bible is wonderful but without the inspiration of the Holy Ghost in this hour the message of the hour it's a dead letter they've taken the quickening power of God to raise up the body of Jesus Christ that makes this word an absolute think about it you know what I'm talking about churches have sold out they once believed in certain things and then they go to their councils and their councils are split heaven just last year AME Methodist movement African Methodist Church they went to their council our split because they're getting pressure to allow homosexuality in the pulpit and in the church what's doing that cuz they don't have the absolute of the Holy Spirit the Living Word of God what would cause somebody to forsake this work because they don't have the absolute of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about an anointing on a spirit I'm talking about Jesus Christ in the soul huh my voice might be a little bit up and down and strong in that sound this is strong for a counseling session but this is more than just preaching this is more than just preaching friends I'm not here to preach I'm here to deliver what God's put on my heart there's a lot of wonderful things that I shout and sing through the weekend the inspiration and I'll follow these different things goes in the file because we're waiting we're looking for what he is going to say the brem says lucky last year old Elijah if God be God then serve Him if this message is the Living God the promise of the word made alive and serving serving with everything you've got you don't want to be down there like Paul's heaven I wish I would I was opposed not saying I wish he said I have and let me tell you something Paul was also one that would quickly be able to point out to you and I that don't you glorify flesh oh if I could just be like Paul Paul was quick to point out these vessels are earth they're fragile weak vessels it's not the vessel it's the excellency of the power of God's that's drilling behind our flesh so if you say I want to be like thought what you're really saying is I want that same Christ that lived through Paul and Paul was so surrendered to I want to live that kind of a surrender life and if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian hallelujah that's what this message does it reveals Jesus Christ you take this message away and you've got the ideas of a man come on somebody and if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian then I think we ought to let loose of everything yes and cleave to him remember he's the center he's the North Star he is the ultimate he's the absolute I never heard the Underground Railroad it's one of things I like to I like reading about Mother Burley and I were talking about her here the other night all right I said you ever read I said I love it I study a lot on I read a lot about it a lot of houses I know of places all up through Oberlin places in Sandusky I've been in in houses it was a whole thing of what was taking place where there was slaves that was down there in the south come on somebody and there was one who would go down there Harriet Tubman was also known as what Moses there right she would go down in there she would risk her life so that others could be free come on the Bible would say in the book of Acts come on now follow me the Bible says they have hazarded hazarded their lives for the gospel you're not hazard or their lives you might look and say however hazarded my life look at decisions you've made you could have taken decisions that would have made it easier on you decisions that would have comforted you do you but you made decisions on account of the gospel are you in me it speaks back there but I'd identifies that life still comes on think about how they would travel on that of that Underground Railroad they would Pat there was marks they were looking at signs they would fill up on the trees to know the direction they're going they had to use nature nature was giving signs to them you're on the right path deliverance is nigh come on now the earth Kronus and travaileth are you with me now they were looking and how did they know when you study it how did they know even though this house might have been a house that was designated as a safe haven the only way they knew you can come to this house at this time there was a light and not just a light a candle light and the light of the candle would know you're safe you see you see there are seven lamps seven spirits come on for him seven stars and when that revelation comes from there that light that shining it lets you know various safety come on in here there is safety and then you move from that place to the next place to the next place the goal was not over land the goal was not the followed house in Sandusky that was not the goal those were just stations along the way we're not called to a station we are called to the rapture it's the light of the gospel that says their safety here their safety under the blood there's the night that lets you know your past is clear your future is bright when were they watching the whole time Northstar looking at the North Star if the North Star was over here it wasn't the North Star that moved they had drifted so they kept their eyes on the North Star and they just thinking well you know what you know how it if sometimes you get lost some of you've never been out there in the woods a hunting when it turns dark and you can't even see your faith your hand in front of your face and you think I came out just like this this way I came out here never forget I was out there deer hunting in the woods and Wellington one time is out there with Mikey and I came out of the tree man I got done got my climber down and packed it all up and here it was it was dusk and dark and I started walking I said man I know I came in this way I started walking finally Mikey came out there hey you called me Sammy he got that from his grandma hey Sammy he's come up here I said we didn't come that way he said we came this way he said I just went back the way after I dropped you off you see how being in a situation I thought I knew where I was going but thankfully when he was there to call it out to me and I started walking you know what happened I started realizing oh yeah there's that reflective tag on that tree oh there's that oh yeah I recognize the others fence post we had to crawl over there yeah recognize all this now somebody had to call me [Music] the North Star the absolute is the revelation of Jesus Christ don't take your eyes off of it you might start to drift this way a little bit what do I do look at the North Star you see that's what the preaching of the gospel it goes forth to do what does it do it doesn't cover the North Star but sometimes I walk has got off a little bit but the preaching of the gospel it reveals where the North Star is it reveals where we are so that we will are here can be connected with where we need to be coz the North Star it'll lead us home so how do our life comes and awefully are turning this way it's an offering turning this way it's offering up of our will surrendering it to him we owe him everything don't we we owe him everything we owe him all that we are let me read these scriptures in closing Philippians 3:7 here is Paul who we read about what things were gain to me those are counted loss for Christ it shows in a valuing reflecting evaluating applying the token to every situation there's things listen to me that God doesn't want you to have that would be gain to you but whatever becomes gain to you and Christ is diminished that's all it is is gain to you but when it's really a gain in other words again listen to me you want to be as Abraham to be blessed and be a blessing and I've had people ask me about things and they were praying about where to go to church and here you know years ago some things I told him I said look because I never told anybody you come here you got to have that revelation because there'll be things it'll test that revelation you got to have that revelation I said this is the thing you apply it when God called Abraham he said you will be blessed and you will be a blessing because he you're not meant to be as just a place that receives water and there's no outlet but your life is meant to receive do you love the Lord look at this power I'm saying what I think these are scriptures and I look at these scriptures I know you've heard me read from more I look at these scriptures I look at these these are things for our lives to evaluate everything evaluate everything yeh doubtless watch how Paul says I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness see Paul was a recipient of that word than life he was receiving and is it a word is coming it's changing his life so who is it it's the righteousness of God working in his life which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead now this scripture it might sound like Paul's just on the well I want to be part of the resurrection you don't want to just be part of the resurrection because all are going to be resurrected one day Paul is speaking here I'm not I want to be part of that second I want to be part of the first resurrection that's what I'm striving for that's what I'm laying everything on the line do you realize the pulse that I counted but dumb you know the under strict you know what Paul came to the place he didn't put something back there and then keep on sitting down at the dinner table say you know if I've done this I mean this could have been good and I mean that this could if you keep if you if you keep those thoughts and keep dwelling on it eventually what your thoughts are and your words your heart will follow the Bible says if they had been mindful of the country they were taken out of they certainly would have had an opportunity to return but we seek for our country the other William we seek for that country whose builder and maker other days is God Hebrew him how could you say that to lot he didn't say it harshly Abraham was a gentleman you want to go this way we'll go this way you're gonna go this way we're gonna go this way it was the promise the promise he had been holding what was happening it was becoming more preeminent in his life verse 12 I'm not gonna read the whole chapter don't worry I want you to look at these verses but does this is a man by Apostle Paul the messenger of that he's he's been caught up into the third heaven he saw things but the carlo's that says it's not even lawful to be uttered a man that has borne imprisonments beatings he said people that were patting him on the back at one point and now we're ready to stab him come on now people that were cheering him up now they turned against him look what he says not as though I had already attained either were already perfect listen I understand Paul was talking about the perfection of Christ Paul was speaking of that in Hebrews let us go on to perfection yes he's talking about the perfection of the soul there but this perfect right here is Paul was speaking of maturity I want to see this word lived out in me Paul's not saying yeah I've already made it you know how God delivered the revelation that's been delivered through my life I've already made it know this is what he thought of himself it was not self condemnation it was not Paul saying oh I know tell I ain't no good that's pride come on now pride always seeks to cover but Paul is actually speaking something that within his life he has not counted himself but I've already attained to it either were already perfect I would say that Paul was somebody that you would love to have fellowship with because he wasn't a know-it-all even though he he was wrestling so much of the revelation of Jesus Christ but if you would have been around Paul this was a spirit of humility I guarantee you to felt like the bigger person but I follow laughter if that I may have pre him that for that which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I'm seeking to lay hold this is what he's saying but then I want to lay hold on what has laid hold on my life what's gripped my life you know what I'm talking about what's gripped our life you can't explain it you can't explain when God gets ahold of your life you can't explain that hole that's on your life and you somebody can suit challenge you but there's a hole in your life there's an anchor let the Hebrew children when it comes time to scan you scanned God is silent but you stand I'm standing on the Word of God I don't know if he's gonna deliver us but we're gonna be delivered from you O king either way weighing bound wing bound so you can get these kneepads out of here hello we're not bound down we're standing gonna beat up god I want to apprehend what I've been apprehended off brethren verse 13 I count not myself to have apprehended I count not I think not do you realize friends you realize how many times brother Branham would tell us and we find the scriptures your thoughts what you think on creates an atmosphere around you when Paul was hearing the word and receiving from God it was challenging Paul's life it was challenging every part of his life for the date it challenged him in these places to where Paul he did not think in his mind I've got it made I'm the messenger look what's come to through me look what has been declared Paul knew if that word has come forth just like in the beginning when he speaks it's to come forth into manifestation in that wonderful all said I know when he speaks it's to come forth in my life and Paul would not think because what you think creates an atmosphere you see where real humility begins it's not like out here like somebody can be doing this out here and it's either one and all this you can see then you see the people everything could be so pious and this and that but humility comes from a humble heart it's a humble heart to the revealed will of God it comes out we don't count ourselves in our own abilities to be able to do it but lord I give myself but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before me I press you see you've got to have that allow him allow him to clear your past you with me he could is the past and gives you focused on the future I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus oh how you doing I press striving toward the mark he's got his eyes set on the prize and you know what that prize is it's a crown of life eternal life a new body I've got my eyes and they'll say this morning if you don't got your eyes let say God I want to give myself to you and if you can look and look we need the reliable ministering of the word why because there's times where we can get caught up in the cares of life and sometimes we can get caught in our own thinking about things and we can get caught into reasoning on certain trying to reason this out and looking but this is why we need the ministering of the word the Ministry of the word it brings the North Star in view to where when our feet have got off we can look to see what the gospel is to do calls you to see the North Star I've traded God when you've come I pray the God this morning and every service we come into that it's the North Star that you see you may not remember was that brother Samuel was that brother BER dream Berlin was that but who in the world was that was that was that something ruther Richard said when the prayer request was that did you see the North Star was that maybe they know maybe that was one that special song I wonder that ain't important what's important is you saw the North Star everything that is done within a service is for the edification of the body of Jesus Christ I know I've been a little longer today didn't get to know nearly nowhere but that's the thought giving my all we're in a race the finish line is in sight brother Greg all of the witnesses all around us we have the witnesses sometimes on a course when they're running that marathon course they don't have people just standing around but they had people standing at the front everybody's cheering them yeah but when they get near the end there's certain points of that race they got people there saying he staggered not at the promise of God clout of many witnesses [Applause] don't you love the Lord give everything and listen friends this is where we come to bigger beyond this service it comes to a place to let the word the examine our lives like Paul where we're not just feeling comfortable but we're examining our lives Lord as Paul said let every man examine themselves seeing where they be in the faith or not let us examine where is our heart had as a heart got misplaced has a heart got over here as a heart words are heard at for wherever our heart is there were a treasure be also let everything be invested into the kingdom of God sometimes I just don't feel like I have the words and everything of what to say but friends if I could say with everything within me give everything you've got those that are streaming those that are all kind of theirs give everything you've got don't let anything be put ahead of the Lord sometimes you see things where people will give they'll give everything oh I can't miss this shopping trip and they'll go shopping and then they're not even in the house of God where your heart is there your treasure is also this is something to be it's something to check our life but the same way that challenge me good we all need challenged I said we all need challenged we all need a letter everything be examined in that in the Word of God because what Paul said I'm now ready to be offered up let's just pray Oh Lord Jesus father Lord you know from my heart and I believe the hearts of your children Lord they have not gathered to hear a sermon and not gathered to just be preached to no no Lord we've gathered here this morning in order with a real purpose you had a purpose for saving me you had a purpose for saving them Lord we're determined to do your will by you will god I pray this morning may the Holy Spirit if our vision has become scaled over if with hot Lord to where our attention as the Prophet spoke about the bride coming into preview and he noticed that that bride got her eyes on the Church of the world oh how bad they were getting and all that that that wasn't that's not the focus our focus is to be on you Lord there's a lot of things that disappointments and things that come along the way we see things now we see Lord if you tarry they'll be more there'll be others that will depart but that's not our focus there be other circumstances other things that will come about but lord we hear the voice calling us to the North Star get back into life get back into step [Music] Lord Paul said I've run I finished my course Lord were called in this hour there is the finish to finish as runners that are part of a relay race every age has handed off that baton that baton of the word there's been an overlapping in every age and the handing off and Lord here we are in that final stretch and the Scriptures tell us that God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect we feel the responsibility of the message of this hour we're not here to defend it you already did that but it's here Lord God the responsibility just to live it to live it give everything to run with all that's within us father I pray here this morning I know and soldiers every heart everyone Lord knows and I ask that God may the heart that could look and say Lord I need that absolute in my life I need the indwelling of your life I need that change in my life Lord to where as the example about the man who once had to have his mouth gagged and his shipmates their ears blocked he found them a melody that released him Lord this morning may from their heart because Lord that's where it must begin he's right in the heart say Lord my heart I surrender Lord my heart Lord and in the life Lord that they would say Lord take over Lord kill every every sin desire Lord everything Lord that's unlike you everything that would hinder Lord and lay it aside this morning Lord lay it decide I lay it by the afford of the word I lay aside every way every sin that does so easily be sir [Music] Lord God from every heart this morning said it hard I want to be lined with that Northstar your God I want not make straight paths before my feet I want to follow that Northstar with all of my heart when the word comes up I want to be I want to hear that word I want to see the Northstar every service I want to see that Northstar so so out through the week Monday Tuesday Wednesday I'm focused on the North Star first day comes along and if there's an area of my life that's not lined up with the North Star right there it can be lined up with the North Star Oh Lord God to every fiber of our life is so lined with you Lord we need you we need you like the simple example I gave the Prophet himself was talked about that in the message of God he thought he knew which way he was going he himself was a guide in that country and yet here it was he walked around the same area over and over and over and over Lord I believe there's some hearts here this morning the City Lord I'm tired of walking in the same area and all I keep coming back to is a dead deer hanging I want to go on to that place of safety and Lord [Music] ceptin struck the heart of the Prophet and he knew there's a tower appear and there's a line from that tower that line is just above me but if I can find that line that line will take me to where I want to go and so Lord he prayed in humility he forgot all that he knew about being a guide Lord and he prayed and he said loud would you let me sing that line and about that time he said that mist gets separated and he was able to see that line Bennett met miss close back again but he was able to see that line where it was Lord right here this morning as you said in the beginning let there be light Lord God by the unction of the Holy Ghost I say Lord this morning let there be light Oh God they look for a heart that says Lord I'm tired of running around these trees Lord and pretending and acting like I know what I'm doing I'm tired of that and how Lord is the prophet saw it he just raised his hand and he kept walking with his hands in the air and eventually his hand hit that line oh my when it hit that line he grabbed it from that point on there was a hand over his head he might have had to change hands one would get tired but he never let go of that line and he made it to the destination that he wanted to get to Lord hands might be getting tired sometimes the weariness Lord sets in from the trials of this life the testings Lord of this life the father may they just take the other hand reach up and grab that line let the one hand just come down and rest for a little bit but Lord taking that line and keep on walking [Music] father I ask in the name of Jesus Christ for every young person Lord middle-aged old everyone Lord may we keep walking for you are our guide you're our guide Lord you're our guide Lord Jesus we want to give our all in this land of offerings we want to offer our lives daily in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory lord Amen god bless if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to [Music] learn to stay because I can't even walk without you holding I can't even walk without you all day for the mountains and the valleys - I burned down Oh [Music] because without you holding my head whoa I can't Lord without you holding for the mountains [Music] down [Music] because I can't [Music] without you holding my [Music] that's my testimony is that yours Lord I can't even walk without you holding my hand aren't you glad that His grace at all all that we would have to do in that moment is say the Lord help me to see that line help me to see that line sometimes you just kind of feel like you know you ever been driving somewhere and you just you kind of come to a place and you feel like you know what I probably need to stop and ask directions I know sometimes we think we got GPS and that's all there is to it but believe me GPS has put me some places in Cleveland it said you arrived and I did not arrive I was in a place I needed to get out of there in a very hurry quick hurry I realized brother David when I looked around and I was sitting in front

do you get to Lakewood Hospital now you might be sitting here saying the same it that's simple you just turn here turn there you know why you can do that you've been there but somebody had to show you how to get there first but somebody can look at me and say okay here's what you do you're going to go up to this light and go through this and you make there's certain things along the way brother Carlos are able to help me of what to look for aren't you glad there's somebody who's already been there and he's right here with you and I we don't have to take somebody else's directions he's here to lead us and guide us the Spirit of Truth aletan got us into all truth he's been there before he's able to help you in a high aren't you glad for that so where sometimes you just seem like it seemed like that lifeline and that line and you just need to have you cleared as soon as you have it cleared you just he knew it was right there that's the same thing in that a comfort to know when it clears
