look to the word of the Lord tonight we certainly know that we have we each and every one of us have needs you know to realize that God he does come on the scene to meet our needs but he's already met everything that we have need him he's already you know just heard him here this afternoon and he said now be careful this question I'm gonna ask you he said but if he come here tonight he said would he heal you he said be careful with the question and you said no because he already has healed you so his presence is just to raise our faith in a finished work that's that's the whole purpose it's his presence is to raise the our faith aren't you glad for that how many times now you think of how that the Prophet said now if he will tell me something concerning this will it help your faith faith in the finished work isn't that wonderful so precious to us every promise every word of God amen let's just look to the Lord in a word of Prayer tonight you've got a need up on your heart just put it

Lord and move within our lives or God that we would further grow Lord into mature sons and daughters of God help us Lord tonight we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen thank you musicians let's look here in the word in Hebrews chapter 13 and just read a few verses of Scripture then we're gonna let you have your seats in verse 5 of Hebrews 13 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he saith or he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me may God bless you tonight as you're being seated I just want to look here just for a few moments in the words we've been looking at this on trials for some time now I certainly believe that in our lives that we understand that within trials that's how our character is actually molded and it's made with under trial their sufferings there's tests and there's many different ways that a trial or a test can't um can come to us and sometimes within of a trial it's it's not altogether where we would look at things like for example what took place with Joel or even in situations were Paul and some of the disciples and them found themselves in we know that there are also times that when situations would arise within the life of a believer that there is a promise that God has given and as a believer will we stand upon that promise but yet in some is sometimes there are times where it actually comes down to the trying of our faith and it's a time when God is silent and that's what I want to deal with tonight when God is silent because there are times that we understand that that comes to it and there's a trying of our faith at times when God is silent we we all want to hear from God we all want to hear we we want to know when we're in the midst of a situation maybe even when we're praying about something concerning the will of God we want answers and we want we want not necessarily I would say answers but we want to know what what does he think about it what what does he want from this and you know sometimes when we're looking at it you know God our answer us you know in a way that is he knows how to speak to us personally God knows how with each and every one of you how to speak to you to build your faith God God's not gonna ask you or me to walk after somebody else's faith and somebody else telling you you know I brother Joey you need to do this and need to do that I I need to have that inspired to me God may speak to somebody but I need to have that personal witness within my heart and within my life because I can't go back to that person and say hey did you say that God spoke to you because I'm gonna be tried on where I move and whatever I I do I'm gonna be trial so I've got to know that that was personally from God and God knows how to speak to us and that's why brother Branham would tell us when he's asked a question about how do you find the will of God regarding something and brother Bramblett said well he said God deals with me in a certain way maybe by vision and he said I'll pray about something and I wait a little bit and then he said I may feel towards it and then I'll keep praying and then I feel a little bit more towards it and I'll keep praying and and perhaps God will open a vision to him now you remember that brother Branham within even his self he'd got to such a place he wanted everything to be just like this just like this and there's an element to that that's absolutely wonderful we all want to be hitting the mark is that right but then there's a part of it that it can also be we understand even when we get to looking at our natural are not natural makeup sometimes our natural makeup can be the biggest hindrance but yet when it's yielded into the hands of God it can be one of the greatest things because when brother Branham himself he said he was melancholy a melancholy person is a real perfectionist things has got to be hitting in a certain way and that's a wonderful thing but yet as it's surrendered into the hand of God we also understand how their brother Bentham he felt many times even when the the the the message was going forth he himself had actually be started to develop a complex because he felt that the people ought to have believed it he felt they ought to have done this and and they ought to have went went according to it and and he what happened in the way that he thought that it ought to happen and we understand that he was he was he was troubled within that and he was looking for for it for an answer in a direction from God and then you can find how that brother Bannon was praying in his life about how to conduct his meetings you know he's he's seeing how this one's conducting and how this one's conducting it and and the angel of the Lord how he told him he said he just conducted as you feel led you know it really comes down to having confidence in in that God is with me and and that's the thing that when we look here at this scripture we can desire a lot of things but just to be content to know that God has said I'll never leave you nor forsake you there are times that we feel him and oh how we love to feel his presence there's times when we pray and how his presence comes down and it just lifts us up we love those times but you know it's also in the times when we're praying that maybe you don't feel his presence and when you're going about something and it's not like it has in times past that's a time when you're being tested within a situation you're being tested in that moment to be able to stand within that time and said I know he still is here he's never left me he's never forsaken me this is his word I know where I'm standing on his word I know where my heart is that and I can rest within this and and here we are standing with a Content nurse and then we can say the Lord is my helper he is my helper so when you we think of this when God you know is is silent you know sometimes we we can get all nervous when we're not getting an answer in we got speed-dial going our speed texting going or speed speed facebook and go on our speed twitter going or oh i'm not getting an answer just just just wait he's c silent but he's allowing faith to be tested so when we're looking at this you know sometimes we we feel like in a manner that maybe God ought to be answering like this and we we get into those situations and sometimes how God will move in their situations just just moving just like this and then all of a sudden God will pull back and you find you look at your thing man why don't the answers come in just like they were before why isn't this evident God's checking your faith he's testing your faith is your faith in the time or the duration or the schardt and shortness of the answer coming or is your faith in him you understand what I'm saying is our faith in an answer came like this or is our faith in Him this is where how God will actually bring about and display the great qualities that lay within the lives of a believer and he is the great miner and refiner of waters potentials just showing forth as realities in our life now what you just to think of this where brother Branham goes through this and I'm not gonna read from it so I'm not gonna ask him to put on the screen but remember how brother Branham wouldn't we refer to it a couple of weeks ago how that with the stats cliff family when they were praying about you know their little baby and and wanting you know believing that God would raise it up the doctor believe God will raise the baby up but then how that the Lord spoke to the Prophet he said and don't touch that he said don't go over there and the Lord went ahead and he took the little baby home and brother Branham you know the the lady is questioning in her heart she's questioning you know brother Branham we've prayed and nothing took place and and you know and and do we have faith and brother Graham said oh you've got great faith you've got great faith and and and you know what she's looking at it because you see where she's looking at it and she needs help is that faith itself having great faith does not always equate a miracle or God moving in a manner as far as in this case that healing comes within that manner but here her faith is demonstrated not in the raising of the baby but her faith is demonstrated if that in the midst of it that even when God's God Himself said no I'm not gonna heal him I know what's best her faith stood still in God brother Rama says that's real faith blue beretta made his statement right after and then he says anybody that's a big statement anybody can have faith when mountains are moving now there's times for mountains to move there's times when mountains need to move and God stimulates our faith is that right there's times for that but then he said what about it window when the when the mountains aren't moving he said when we're praying you said and everything seems to go backward he said that's when it takes real faith to be able to stand and that's something that that God alone has has placed within us an anchor that holds us in the midst of that time if you can just remember this thought I'm not going to elaborate on it tonight but just remember this thought Paul said in my flesh there is no good thing in the midst of tests in the midst of trial your flesh and your spirit feels the impact but it is not out of our flesh or out of our spirit that God is pulling out believer qualities but God is bringing out the qualities of a believer that dwell within that soul which is that gene which is that germ that has been quickened this earth and frail weakened vessel it displays its weakness in the midst of these times but here how that within the midst of it we realized that with patience as we've been talking on this with patience and the loyalty of our heart that patience itself is not something that is just handed to us this is a great virtue of patience even faith was not handed to us but faith itself is that which is born within our hearts there's got to be something that will stir our faith first of all to believe in God and then God comes down and it moves from just a faith that we have up here to a faith to a living faith that Paul could say the life that I'm not living I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me and so that faith is that is an anchor it's a residence within our life that holds steady in the midst of everything and this is where as the Prophet would tell us that patience itself is the very outcome of faithfulness and he he refers to the book of James where the trying of your faith work as patience and it says let patience have her perfect work that you might be entire perfect and wanting nothing and the Prophet said God hey so highly regards this outworking of our patience and he says it like this he said God's will is for for us is perfection now remember that perfection is not our flesh that perfection is not our spirit but that perfection is our waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development that's a powerful statement this is no character development is not an insta pot meal you can't put it in and all of a sudden it it instantly you know it's like it it comes up overnight the character itself to think about this if I can I can just say it like this character itself holds no retirement plan in this life character itself holds no eventual drawing from Social Security in this life character were here in this life and it's in this life that our character is molded and shaped and when God Himself our purpose has been served that character has been fully developed then he himself who has brought it forth fully delivers that character that gold and brings it home because this life is just for that development so we're never going to come to a place to where we can kick our feet up and say we're done with tests and trials you're Fleshman like that and my flesh would like that we would but the reality of it is when we realize our journey here is just for this purpose to develop christ-like character after we have been born by his Spirit then it's God it moves and directs us through the very process of character development and through this time of character development there's times when God is silent you know I think the worst thing it is you just sit around the room nobody's talking some of you probably in your house has never had that I hadn't called nobody's name but I'm just tell you right now when you hear silence silence sometimes you know you think they can somebody talk you know somebody talk silence itself is one of silence is a time you know if nobody's talking you just come into a room or you just sit there there's a lot of things that can try to go through your mind there's a lot of things that can come during the time of silence it's a time of being tested on what God has given now watch how the Prophet takes us through this in the filler and Philadelphian church age here and we'll just kind of base on this for a few moments tonight he takes us into the scripture at revelations chapter 3 verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth he said what does he mean by the word of his patience and if it takes us to Hebrews 6:4 when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise the RAM says you see the Spirit is speaking about the Word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience so God gives a word of promise but that word of promise is a word of patience God gives that word to a generation God gives that promise and then God allows what looks like my it's coming right away it's going to be fulfilled yet we recognize it is at hand but at hand means that the Living God who isn't present to fulfill that promise there is a maturing of that promise but the maturing of that promise cannot override or go beyond the people who are a danger of that promise but the God who made that promise is the light of that promise and the light of that promise must mature the people because the people are the literal reflection and manifestation of that promise which is of the Living God the light of God lighting up that promise in the hearts of the people so the promise itself this is why the promise itself there is a continual maturing within that promise and as the Bible says even concerning in that time that he will keep thee in the hour of temptation when their pressures and things that even in that time that we're going on and brother Graham said even there will be a time that will come upon the earth he said when people are actually pressured under the very place of you know worshiping and giving themselves over to those beast systems and he says they'll look at it and say well at least I can serve God in these systems he said and they'll be pressured under the hour of temptation but the promise is for us in this hour that those as you are looking to that word of patience you've kept it I will remember the and I will hold thee in the hour of temptation and they're wonderful this is the way God teaches his people patience what's this wife he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience Wow but would become even more impatient with life now what's this would become even more impatient with life it's not just even in your spiritual walk it's with life you'd become impatient with your family impatient with wives husbands and impatient with one another impatient when you go to the grocery store why in the world biases taken so long they have 30 cash registers and to open and they've got ten self serves if you only want to cash registers open just build to something you know what I'm talking about when you look at it if God did it this way I'm going to tell you right now there's every one of us in here like instant prayers we like instant things happening in our lives every one of us but you know what instant things don't always don't always produce character instant things you know God can do something instantly within a service for a heart and alive and here they are is they're walking on with God things will take place right on and then as they begin to mature in the Lord they feel like my you know what's happened to me when I first started serving God it seemed like I prayed and bow the answer came and I prayed about this pal the answer came and my this happened and the answer came you know what's happened Lord if I have I've fallen away from you have I gotten cold no it's just God has been maturing you to a place to realize all of those things that took place were necessary in that time and he will show up like that when it's necessary for us again but you see you cannot equate that as though what God must not be with me God must not be with me hold brother Samuel but what Gideon but apply that in the right context when Gideon said if God be with us where be all the miracles God you get in was standing there in that time after there had been such a space where God himself his presence had not been made manifest among them and God needed to manifest his presence so he had somebody that could ask him to manifest his presence somebody who could look in the word and say if God is the same God who opened the Red Sea where is that God at right now there has to be that two started friends if there wasn't God moving like that in your life in the beginning you need to check up come on somebody God moves in that manner to stir that faith I'll tell you what if you can receive it tonight it'll help you this right here will really help you you know it'll allow you to back the devil up and give him a black eye to where you're not beating letting yourself be browbeat on things we would become even more impatient with life let me show you the truth even more fully set forth Hebrews 11:17 he said by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises the Word of God offered up his only begotten Son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good promises of God that there could not be a trial but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise they'll repeat of God he received that promise and how the Prophet brings around here when we pray over that promise if there's a promise that God has given to you you say you don't know my situation you don't know what I'm going through but I am certain that God has already provided a word for it I am certain that he's still God even over your situation where maybe you can't find a scripture for it but I'm telling you he's still the same God who meets needs he's still the same God you saved my brother Samuel I can't turn this situation God never asked you to try to change somebody else God asks you to stand on his word and hold that word and say god you're God of your word and Lord God I submit myself to you and I'm looking for you to come on the scene I tell you friends sometimes the reason God can't even come on the scene it because our attitude on things we get so impatient we get huffy brother Brent says we pray and we ask him and he don't answer and he said we get disgusted with him who him powerful statements conference with God what happens with that we well you know I you said what brother said no how can that be I don't get disgusted with God let me ask you are you still praying his fervent are you still reading are you still holding on this further or if you left or if you let back on some of that right there you see that's only the enemy to try to come at you and try to discourage you from the promise but remember you're not going to receive strength and encouragement for the promise coming to pass by removing yourself from the very promise giver and the life source of him you've got to keep moving on and standing there and say God made this promise I'm a believer and I'm looking to God to fulfill this I know the simplicity where the Prophet spoke of it regarding Abraham and I think sometimes that we let those little things bypass us where it talks about where the brother branham will dramatize how that Abraham made ready he said go ahead and buy up the diapers go ahead and get the bird out pens go ahead and get these things what was Abraham doing he was making ready for the promise oh god help us but here it says they Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph in 105 verse 19 until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him who Oh glory be to God God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill that can you agree with that he's given us great and exceeding promises this I mean you don't know my situation but I'm not talking about your situation I'm talking about the remedy for your situation I'm not talking about your trial I'm talking about the God who is over all of that he's given us exceeding and great precious promises and not does he just give us promises he fulfills them he's not like you or I where we promised somebody to call somebody I'll call you we'll get together we'll do this and then time and everything else gets in between God is not like that God when he made a promise God will come to his problem matter of fact the Prophet said electus and the patriarch Abraham he said God will bankrupt the heavens to keep one promise to one of his children hallelujah that's God's faithfulness to his word oh my but from the time look at this but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn no know what to receive patients into our souls remember jesus said that receive you patients into your souls possess your souls with patience possess your souls with patients to receive patients into our souls for only in patience do we possess life he says may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this sixth age learned patience we read the history of lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in over impes and haste we don't get any help from the world around us see the atmosphere everything around it totally speaks against this remember the the actual spirit of this age is a spirit that has to that that is battled you didn't battle it before you were moved by it now you battle against it soft easy living and yet what does the what does that soft easy living everything else we find that this age is the age of a heightened neurotic age everything's promised easier and you know those of you know working the more technology they come out with the more people you lose to work with you and the more they demand of you you're not becoming easier they demand more out of you all of the pressures everything that comes along with it every time there's an advancement of the tree of knowledge the pressure continues to mount or glory that's why we need our release in the Tree of Life he is our release of the pressure now we could just spend on that at some time but over impatience and haste my mind you know job job was tried and when LeBron tells us how that the people came to job those those brethren really Bram tells us he said if job himself if it had been just intellectual faith he said joke could arrest it and resorted to his reasoning but they could not move job off of his sacrifice and he said the reason is that he said they could they could talk about all these things and they could put all these things out he said but the difference was with job job had fellowship job had fellowship with God this was not something that had been handed to job junk knew it by personal revelation but this is my absolute this was Christ this is this is God's provided way it was a burnt offering but he had this is what it was it's not you can look at and say well that was a word of a burnt offering but let me tell you something job and any man any ordained believer with faith in the word that's given to them and their have faith in that word to make that word live it'll back the devil up every time I don't care how small the promise might see if it's faith in that promise for God to move it'll back the devil up every single time because it's faith in the Living God who made that promise Alleluia what about us we're not we're not living under a pipe or a shadow we're living in what was spoken about and that has come to pass through Calvary and now living in the finishing of all times over my it ought to be then within our lives to say Lord what you had promised Lord I know that you are fulfilling in Lord even now in my life the Bible tells us don't cast away your confidence it had great recompense of the reward it says you have need of patience then after you have done the will of God that you might receive the promise for a little while and he that shall come will tarry will come and will not tarry God allows tearing don't allow silence it proves faith it proves faith there are scriptures that we've been reading from here for some services at different intervals but out of Romans chapter 5 the Romans chapter 5 it speaks of how that in verse 3 we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us now we look at this and how that you know when we're looking at the tribulations that they come upon the trials the test its tribulations that worketh patience and patience experience and experience oh and to know that all of this there's one great hope that you and I have and that hope is in the coming of the Lord but look at this right now if look at this we've got a hope and expectation and the coming of the Lord that we are a part of his coming by the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he's coming back for his own we have a promise within that and that promise notice it's faith but now through those those tribulations tribulation has brought about patience and patience itself has brought about experience and experience hope it's just like within this room here tonight there is no doubt many that when a maybe a life starts out in their first person or first journeys in their walk your patience might be like this but then after time that patience grows and remember we want to let patience have her perfect work it's God developing God the Bible says he's not gonna put more on you than what you're able to bear he's not interested and drowned in you sinking you he's interested in bringing out what he knows lays within you hallelujah he knows what lays within your life so he's bringing it all about be experiences in your life those experiences are testimonies those testimonies in your life experiences you go through are not just about you they are witnesses and testimonies and works of God that can be expressed and for the edification of the body and them experiences it brings about hope within our life what expectation that here when something itself even would come along and might seem greater than what the last one was but yet there is a hope within it that says I know that God is my helper I know he never left me he never forsake me he's bringing me through this he's gonna see me through this I don't know how what everything I'm gonna have to go through every briar patch and everything else but I know that God is with me and I know God will see me through what is that expectation that's the same kind of expectation for the body change we've got to have that same kind of an expectation daily in our life it's an expectation of the Living God you can't look at yourself you can't look at your neighbor you've gotta look unto Him who is the author and finisher of your faith David said it like this David said in Psalms 119 verse 16 uphold me according unto that word that I may live and let me not be ashamed of my hope hold down me up and I shall be safe and I will have respect under the statutes continually in Psalms 25 verse 1 David said unto the Lord do I lift up my soul o my god I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me yay let them that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed what's transgress without cause you know what David is doing he's following the word the Bible says in James 5:14 if any of you be afflicted let him pray let him pray Lord let me not be ashamed Lord I lift up my soul to you Lord let not my enemies triumph over me Lord glory be to God even to where FF Bosworth said at the very end how he so believed in divine healing and he prayed God would not let him go be in SiC and God took him home anyone sick you see the promises let me not be ashamed hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in ours now we might have certain expectations but there's a deeper expectation that holds us certain things don't turn out maybe the way that we want it to turn out we prayed for here and and and the healing does not come maybe in the timeframe that we're looking for or even in the way come on somebody what about the woman who was prayed for there in the meeting where the presence of God is moving in the services and she went on home to her God had already spoken and here she is making up the beds the next day here she is up there on the hill you know you've heard the story here she is up there testifying and what happens in the midst of that time not only her but her neighbor then what it is has been healed her condition and her neighbor with that that growth that she on all her had fallen off what happened God came on the scene the angel the Lord was passing through the neighborhood to make good on the promise that he had made with her the night before and they no doubt about it she probably walked out of that meeting she didn't feel no different but she has holding on to God's Word and had a hope her brother Samuel I don't want hope I want faith if you've got faith you'll have hope you can't have faith and not have expectation Psalms 27 verse 14 wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord hmm Psalms 37 verse 34 wait on the Lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it no notice verse 39 the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because because because they trust in him not because you're worthy not because I'm worthy but he shall deliver from the wicked he shall say because they we trust in him had nothing to do about your worthiness had nothing to do about my worthiness Romans 8:24 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope if you can see it you're no longer hoping for it for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for it but if we hope for that we see not then we do with patience wait for it no doubt you might have come into this building tonight or any other other times and maybe tonight here you come in this building you might have felt lower and more down than than the padding under this carpet right here tonight you might have felt down and discouraged maybe within yourself but here is something that raised us up within you said if I can only get there to the house of God I believe that God's gonna speak to my heart God's going to minister what is that that's hope and you are saved by hope and how God comes down right by his word and ministers right to your life it's God coming down why because you trust in him you're not trusting in a man you're not trusting in his ability but you're trusting in the Living God to confirm his word and fulfill it that's real hope sometimes you're praying about things brother Graham says you know you pray for it and you know he says sometimes he says he don't answer he might answer in the first five and four if he don't answer in the first five hours he says wait another if he doesn't answer today he'll answer tomorrow the devil said he didn't answer today he'll answer tomorrow he'd be done answering this week he will next week you see what that is that's expectation he will answer you're not going to take that promise away from me if it hadn't happened this hour he's going to answer me next hour if they don't answer me the next hour I'll stand there and say he'll answer me tomorrow if it ain't this week it's gonna be next week if it ain't this month that's gonna be next month if he don't come today he'll be coming tomorrow if he don't come tomorrow he'll be coming the next day but he is coming and I'm going with him he is gonna fulfill that promise and I'm part of that promise he made that promise with me in mind he still answers Psalms wonder Philippines 1:20 according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me for me to live is Christ and to die is gain now what we've just done here for a few moments is taken has the Scriptures themselves it says in Romans 15 for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope you and I have promises and examples that God has so inspired within the hearts and lives of believers who went before us to inspire us and comfort us in the midst of our time brother bream tells about this woman I'm coming to a close here he tells about the woman here the widow of Zarephath you know brother Brenner has a way of dramatizing it he said though no doubt he said here she was biting her lip still they would bleed he said she had been praying and looking to God for God to move in brother Bram said it like this he says you know God has a way of answering prayer he has a way of answering prayer he don't always it isn't always in the same timeline the same timeframe and the same way but he has a way of answering prayer and notice how that she's been praying now the scriptures when we look at it in the script the scriptures don't give a whole a whole lot of background about this woman they just all of a sudden break in when it's time for Elijah to go to her but yet in all of this of what she's been doing she's a believer brother brems says that she is even after the Lord had taken her husband home she had wanted to just stay true there to the vow and he said that you know not not that she had to as far as than that but the brother man says she just wanted to you know stay single and meet her husband and glory and brother Graham said that for weeks he said that Beryl kept going down kept going down kept going down I want you to catch this for a moment she's praying and what she's praying and asking God for the opposite is happening instead have what she's praying for I'm praying for my children but it seems like they're getting farther away things I'm praying about it on the mill bearing didn't it's going down down down come on somebody she was constantly praying and the Prophet said it like this he said it looked like there was no hope in sight nowhere in sight you get that there was no hope in sight nowhere in sight but here she's a believer what she sees she knows it's going down now notice how that you know brother Ram says this is where he said it comes to us that where when you know that you've met God's requirements he said she had met God's requirements she was living separated from the systems of that day she was living a pure and clean life she knew she and met God's requirements and he said this is it seems like you know when you've met all of God's requirements and yet he's still silent he doesn't say anything she's praying and God didn't say just hold on I've got a man coming down here and this is gonna take place it were no longer be hope because why I hope with what you already know she didn't know how the outcome was going to come he said but notice if you know you've met his requirements and you've done all you know to do then faith doesn't waver it just sits still and thinks positive whew sit still and doesn't think positive how'd it hear she was in the midst of it looked like he was silent but he said God sometimes does that to see what kind of a reaction that you're gonna have he talks about how that people will walk across the platform and you know you're prayed for and hands are laid on you and you go on off the platform and you're still dealing with the same symptoms over and over what did the Prophet tell us don't look at your symptoms I'm gonna tell you friends let me tell you how the devil does it you can be prayed for for something you can even sit down and talk with me about something but you've got to have faith that God Himself answers and you've got to stand upon that promise but the moment that you back away from that promise and allows the enemy to move right back in and take that ground and he can stand there you know what he's trying to do he's trying to build in you a complex against the promise that God has ordained for you to where you will actually start drawing back when a minister anointed by the Spirit of God to preach that word there'll be something within you the wrath of a complex are drawn back you don't even know why in the world you're getting all nervous and everything about it who is it it's Satan building a complex but you're gonna realize that promise is met and fulfilled in the promise of faith not what I feel not about what I said it's not about any of my symptoms it's what God has already said hallelujah when he's silent Who am I this is where the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint brother bran puts it down there in the midst of this when you're looking at it you think about even the Hebrew children when they come down let's just take a little detour here you come down to the Hebrew children they themselves did not have an answer from God about the fiery furnace they didn't have one answer but what they did say is we're not going to bow to you they had met every requirement sins was confessed and they were standing there and you know what God in the midst of it was silence but God when he gets ready to move he moves the whole time he was right there they didn't see him but he was there with them he was there with them when they were even brought before the king come on somebody in there what the Lord Jesus told the disciples he told him he said and to us would fear not when you're brought before kings and magistrates and different things don't you take take a thought of what you're gonna say it'll be given to you at that moment why because he is present I'll never leave you nor forsake you the Lord is my helper I will not fear what men can do unto me the whole time brother brems said no doubt Satan was telling them this is your end well both Samuel what would it matter well he wasn't going to turn him away he wasn't going to turn him away from what from what the anchor was with him but the midst of it is Satan doesn't know your destiny oh I wish we could get that tonight that gavel does not know your destiny the devil does not hold your future he's never held your future let me tell you something God is not the one whispering on your soldier shoulder about something of where you're gonna be like the rest them and you're gonna fall away and you're gonna do this and that ain't from God that's from the devil and you know what the devil anointing your flesh just sit there and try to get in on you but remember brother sister that's not God that is the devil that devil does not hold your future discern that spirit and will stand it and cast it away with perfect love in a perfect God who said his word he don't know me don't own that destiny he don't know the outcome of this trial get on your shoulder and say I'll tell you what they're gonna do they're gonna fire you that ain't of God boy I tell you we're just gonna go with it gets on your shoulder and says you know what this is gonna take you out this sickness gonna take you out that ain't of God hallelujah let me tell you something when God leads you it'll produce the same results as it did in Polycarp you with me he's the same God providing supreme grace for the supreme hour you say brother send the handle I know it can you say it again I sure will when Satan comes it produces fear but when God speaks it produces faith and that's one way you're able to discern between the enemy and God Alleluia glory hallelujah [Music] Omaha he seemed to be silent but the joy was no text coming in none brother ray that thread was dead there was no there was no likes on the Facebook post of we're gonna stand we're gonna stand for you nothing he was sad but God was allowing their faith to be demonstrated to be shown in the midst of this time this is the promise having done all to stand stand therefore he said let's jump back to this Widow and let's finish it the RAM talks about this Widow and he said here's what she had said that nevertheless whatever you do Lord I love you just the same and I trust you you say brother Samuel that ain't written in the Bible I believe it you know why we're talking about the qualities of a believer we're talking about the desire within every one of our hearts in our lives let me tell you something reading about this widow of Zarephath we read one little passage it's not even in a whole entire chapter it's a part of a passage but brother Joey her life had been chapters is that her brother Dave her life had been chapters but we don't read about the other chapters but the other chapters no doubt there was molding shaping making even for this moment so don't get this chapter here and say this is who she was all the time as far as they believer yes but she had to be matured there was no doubt she went through other times in her life that no doubt she would not have wanted on display but God chose to select an archive what you and I needed to minister comfort to us notice it said this is enough for me how the brother BAM he enters into this he says it seems strange when a person has done all that they can do and that they have fulfilled every request that God has asked them to do and still he is silent when you have done all that God has requested to do and still he is silent just be sure that you know God and remember faith is silently waiting he's only testing your faith to see what you'll do God does that he says this little woman I like this this little woman know that she had met all these requirements and spiel God was silent it seemed like he didn't even care for her are you with me seemed like he didn't even care for her he didn't care whether she lived or died let me put it like this it would be like you calling me or texting me and I never responded maybe I've done that but she would start wondering I'll text this guy I've called this guy I've text this guy I've called this guy and in the midst of silence what starts working I don't think he loves me as much as he loves the rest of him you know he looks at you a little funny you know sometimes you know how it is I mean he'll go right past you in the vestibule he won't even shake your hand who's leading you to think that way well listen I just feel but who's leading you to feel that way well it seemed like you see what silence will do it seems like he didn't even care for her he didn't care what care whether she lived or died but all the time God was working she didn't know about it but God told her logic he dried up the book reached out his hand and stopped the brook from running and Elijah said Lord why did you stop the brook and he said I've commanded a little woman to feed you he already commanded her and she didn't know it amen you've already been ordained to stand in this hour you've already been ordained to overcome you've already been all day to see through this trial you're ordained to go through this trial this test has not come upon you just out of something strange but God has ordained this very tile this very test and it brings out the quality it brings out what is on the inside let's stand just as he commanded her she didn't even know she did not know but God told her Liza I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you God had to allow everything to work out you know she was tried right when he came they're gonna bake me a cake first that was a trying that was trying she's been praying God increased the mill barrel and now comes putting me first it wasn't Elijah the man this was God speaking through his servant this was the word coming put me first no wonder brother Ram tells us in enticing spirits I love this quote brother brems says you show me a man he said a factory worker you showed me a housewife you show me anyone he said that'll put God first he said in everything I'll show you a person that'll come out on top no matter all the devil can put on them why cuz God is first gods first she didn't know it God's eyes was on her she didn't feel it she didn't even see any results going on but God's eyes was on him that's why I love how I believe it was Ellie who that said the job he withdraws not his eyes from the righteous as he said in the book of Zechariah said his eye he said he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye this is what God thinks about you is what he thinks about me this is what he thinks about his word regret said he might have commanded you a testimony of your healing you may not know it but just hang on he said God might have commanded there to be that over where he said there an angel or something he said we'll come by God promised to answer he said in May and maybe this night before the healing service starts tonight might have been God seen your condition today he might have heard your prayer would just be sure stand there in the midst of it all as you're standing there and God is silent because here's where sins in this kind of a dis trial where he's silent you've taken his word and you're standing there and God is silent be sure it's God and wait wait on the Lord and he will strengthen your heart he is faithful to his word let me tell you something right now I can't read it to you tonight but I believe it's in John chapter 6 when you read it in job chapter 6 when job was going through the midst of that testing of that trial you know what the enemy wanted to do the enemy wanted to take away expectation job said at the beginning of that trial he said I know he said that God he said when I come forth from this I shall be pure as gold but around job six job started talking about what he was hoping for you know what job was hoping for to be taken out of the earth yes sir well brother Samuel that's before Joe got that mighty revelation that I know my Redeemer liveth read on after that chapter you find even after that chapter that job continues on but Joe needed that revelation just like you and I need revelation stimulation to move on job was the one saying all the day I wish that they had been they never would have said a man child was born I wish that I was taken out of this earth but listen friends listen God's desire through this particular trial is to display his glory it would be no Marvel for lives to serve Him for us all of us if everything was going just right it would be no Marvel everybody would want it just for that reason but you see what it is is that even in the midst of the suffering and in the midst of it God Himself just looked to him trust in him say Lord all of my feelings when you feel down when you feel discouraged you feeling that way listen just turn to him be like David what we right here tonight from the word let me not be ashamed Lord let me not be ashamed my hope is in the Lord God my expectation is in you Lord Jesus you're gonna see me through I might have been prayed for five years ago but this is my year I might have been prayed for last week this is my week or brother Samuel that's a hope no that's not a hope so that's expectation Abraham when God made the promise it was 25 years later but hey bruh him the Bible said he grew stronger you answer me this question what part of Abraham grew stronger that ordained part on the inside it's Earl us not that outer man that grew stronger cuz that outer man stood there at the very brink of Genesis 18 and laughed when God said you're gonna bring forth a son through Sarah tell me who grew stronger we would look at that and say he didn't get stronger he grew a weaker no he grew stronger the inside man was growing stronger the outside man was growing weaker and the inside man took control of the outside man that's the same thing happening in me and you it's the same things happening in me and you circumstances and things that go beyond our abilities to try to fix them and control them and everything and God's letting you and I know you can't do nothing about it I got it in control it's like trying to adjust things and it's stripped I can't turn it it's stripped God said but I've got it in control he's silent maybe tonight for some of you some of us he's been silent certain things you're praying about but remember his eyes on you and it's not from a distance he's right there with you he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you he's right there to strengthen you and strengthen me sure brother Samuel sometimes I've got week sometimes law I've wavered sometimes brother Samuel I haven't thought positive he under that but he's also the mediator he's the high priest that is touched by the feeling of your infirmities and here he is by way of his word to encourage you that I'm right here the whole time I've been with you the whole time I'm right here walking with you I'm seeing you through this but lord I haven't got any text from you in a while I'm right here Lord haven't got a call no I'm right here I'm right here right with you let's just pray or Jesus you know Lord our needs award in our lives you know what we have need of you know just how to speak to his Lord you take your word Lord and you minister to our hearts Lord perhaps here tonight I believe in Lord not only here but maybe some that are streaming or well archived even this service somebody Lord God where there are maybe a time right now and they're looking in their praying they yet Lord as it were your seemingly silent Lord

the eyes but Lord they even have that of the the sockets and everything developed and the nerves Lord we could go on and on and how that we had to be connective tissue to the brain and all of that had

Lord God by the very creator himself Lord here tonight perhaps those are streaming Lord there's things that they're holding on to promises Gordon maybe there have been they've been waiting but has there waiting Lord may they take refreshing and comfort Lord and I pray then Lord if their confession seems to have ceased it seems to where that Lord they're not confessing it like they was maybe Lord God rise in a renewing tonight Lord father Lord as we ask you Lord to forgive us Lord for wavering Lord and not thinking positive Lord and father tonight Lord gone where they can renew that confession in you they can have that Lord as knowing that you answer Lord and you answer in your time God made that confession Lord may it move Lord within their hearts Lord may they take that situation may be that not that trial and Lord just laying it there before you and say Lord you are God you are God you are the I am of this need Lord you're the I am of my life and father I give
