your hands lord even when we were unaware of what you'd done for us lord and that we were your children but yet your hand was upon our lives lord dear god and you brought us to yourself lord oh father now we just we thank you lord for your mercy lord we just lord invite you lord as you already hear your presence lord just just so precious and sweet lord in this building lord as your children have gathered and just to think about it lord that this building lord the dry wall and everything else within it it could not create this atmosphere but lord your word says you dwell in the praises of your people lord dear god right here this morning lord there are lives and hearts that you've set at liberty and they've lord invited you to come lord jesus oh god you're the delight of our life you're our joy lord you're our strength you're you're everything you're our all in all lord oh god every title lord everything itself is wrapped up lord in the precious name of the lord jesus christ you're everything to us lord and we just lord jesus just invite you lord hear this morning lord just to come and take the word and just speak to our hearts lord you know the needs that are gathered here this morning and we need you lord they we need to hear from you lord we've not come to hear from a man we've come to hear from you lord so lord i ask that you would help me to get myself out of the way that gift lord that you placed within my life that you'll come down lord and anoint that gift with yourself lord and that you would speak o god father lord according to the living oracles oh god let the lord every part of my being lord and of this congregation lord just be surrendered and submissive lord to your working and as the song that we sang lord flow through me holy spirit may the holy spirit have the right of way here this morning lord for every single need o god for any life that's bound may the liberty of the holy spirit ring out in that heart oh god lord to make them free lord the faith would rise in the promised lord for healing deliverance whatever it is lord we just ask oh god that you'll just come in a very special way and minister personally lord to every heart lord we just invite you lord this congregation lord the people lord your children lord they invite you lord god to their pew lord to their heart lord god i just pray as lord standing here at this pulpit lord i say it once again i invite you here to this pulpit lord god that you'll come and be the speaker here lord god minister to our hearts we pray we love you and we thank you now father in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you this morning amen so good to be in the house of the lord isn't it amen and we want to just go right to the scriptures first john chapter 5 and you want to say it's so good to see brother ray amen and before i seen him i heard him and it wasn't because there's microphones piped back there either but it's just so good to be in the house of the lord amen and good to be gathered with his children this morning and i'm just going to ask you to pray for me i've just kind of been between multiple thoughts and which one do i just take and move within this here and just to go either within each one but just feeling the lord just pressing upon this part of it to just come this way this morning and so i just ask you to be in prayer for me i certainly need his prayer and i trust you always are we you're sitting there and pulling on the word you're praying god guide our brother lord just just lord just just direct him lord in the in the pathways of what we have need of amen so let's look here in first john chapter 5 and verse 4. the scripture says for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god amen if i can read one more scripture first corinthians 12 verse 3 if you don't want to turn there they'll put it up there for you wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost amen so we want to just speak here this morning if god will just help us on mastering circumstances amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as it's being seeded i think that no matter when we take this this thought and as a believer you would recognize even the thought many times in different places of the message of how that brother branham would lay this out over and over of how that faith itself is a master of every circumstance it's to recognize that this is a place that god has called us back to as sons and daughters of god that we would have and walk with a real dominion in this life to have a real authority now that authority is not given to us by church or by a man or anything outside outside of the lord jesus christ that authority comes to us through him and so i want to just look at this here this morning in mastering circumstances because in our lives in our daily journey and then even as god is dealing with the life there are many circumstances many obstacles many things that comes our way and many things that one has to press through and to overcome and so when we look at this sometimes there's circumstances as they come our way that they seem they take us by surprise but not one circumstance has ever taken god by surprise god was not surprised when they came to the red sea god was not surprised when daniel was was placed there in the den of lions god was not surprised when the hebrew children were thrown into the fiery furnace god was not surprised at all the circumstances were were a surprise to those whom it would happen to but in the midst of it there was a mastering of that circumstance and so we want to look at that here just a little just to encourage you in the in the things of the lord here this morning brother branham would say it like this and i want to just just kind of lay this in as a little bit of a background in the in the message perfect faith just taking a few places from there he says perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the lord's revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on just don't ask any questions it's already over and you just keep going it masters all circumstances it says well if you do this and so and so is going to do you see it's already got it mastered what are we talking about faith faith already has it mastered faith believes i love this statement faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow it masters all circumstances so right here alone with just this statement we recognize that faith is not what we can explain but faith is an understanding that god is in control and that god is going to work this out faith is not based on that i know how it's going to happen or every little junction of the moment that's not what faith is faith is looking to a god who made the promise and to know that he cannot fail don't know how he's going to do it but he's going to do it amen so um to master something it means to prevail or to overcome and he said faith and love is relations because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love so faith and love it works together and then he moves into here in another a further part and he says no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith what love is he speaking of the love of god that has come sought you out brought you to himself brought you to a place of surrender to where that now god steps down in a very power of transformation and has changed your life into a new creature in christ jesus you're no longer the same person that you used to be it's not you trying to do something trying to live right it's christ in you that has changed your very appetite and desires your love is to him and to his work and that's the love itself that then moves to govern or invite faith to govern every circumstance that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings faith oh he says then it can't keep from bringing it out just exactly what god promised it would do in galatians 5 6 the bible tells us for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so faith as we just just declared that faith operates by love faith is a confidence but what brings that confidence is the very love of god moving and operating in our life you realize that for any promise and whatever that you would have need of it must be the love of god that would pulsate to you to even be able to move in upon that promise you might be even outside of the economy of god this morning but it takes the love of god to be manifested to you and to recognize of what he already has done for you he already followed you before the foundation of the world and that love when that love can so grip and take a hold of a person's life brother there's a surrendering that takes place there is not such a thing as i'm gonna lay this down quickly those things are cast aside because the love of god it brawls draws upon that heart and brings them into a place of a real union with almighty god and then their faith it operates it works by love now i want you just to think of this here brother brahman says you know he says i've been a christian you know over 20 years i i believe there was a god just as real as that light is on my hand and there's there's power of god in this room tonight to heal every sick person in here open every blinded eye and stop every deaf ear make every lame man leap like a heart save every sinner sanctify and fill with the holy ghost to every believer he's here just as real as he can be now if you can just find the wire that carries the current to you now all down through the ages the believers have believed the promises of god i'm talking about the overcomers but god in this hour he was not going to let there just be a rumor of the supernatural he was not just going to let it be a rumor that would exist because in a rumor you can't have confidence you know it's like there can be a rumor in the workplace hey we hear they're gonna do this or we hear where they're gonna do this and a lot of those things are just nothing but mere rumors rumors are drawn upon other people's hearing of this oh i've seen this and they draw this conclusion but you can't have faith upon a rumor [Applause] but so god in this hour for the church of the living god that you and i were not walking under a rumor of the supernatural but god in himself would make himself known through his provided channel in this hour when god would keep his word he would send a prophet in this hour according to his word and it would declare to us that that other dimension that's right here with us remember elijah did not bring the angels down he only prayed and asked god opened the eyes of geheza that he might see that he is here already and this is why brother brown could say the purpose of my ministry is to declare that he is here and that now listen has just as much as that was within the prophet's ministry to declare that he is here there is a bride that has come under that declaration and has been united with that word and your life declares he is alive and well is the same power same authority everything he is the same your life has become a channel in this hour the word itself has been sown over this generation and this is the crop that the word itself has produced lives that are yielded to the power of almighty god to declare he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah a wire that the current could come to you oh my i love this statement here in the 20 years of research of the bible and talking with the angel of the lord how many can say that he we won that bob jones or whatever more all reading in the bible and talking with the angel of the lord who was it that came there in the room ties service after service when he was studying there for the seals who was it that came in the room the angel of the lord over and over this message is not the thoughts of william branham this message is the thoughts of almighty god that's been expressed in this generation hallelujah no wonder brother bannon could stand there in mighty god unveil before us and he said to think tonight the expressed thoughts of jehovah the message of the hour i'm talking he says and talking with the angel the lord and many things i find here is two things that is love and faith if you love god just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him it'll accompany faith every time and when you love when you when love and faith gets married you ask what you want to and you'll have it you'll see unadulterated love love that's not it's not divided but love that is seated there in the innermost part of that life the love of god has been shed abroad in your heart and there's a there's an unadulterated love it's a love that won't mix it's a love that cannot be broken it's a love that no matter the test or trials or whatever that comes your way there is no pressure no circumstance nothing present nor nothing to come that can ever separate you from the love of god hallelujah and that i'm persuaded of when you know that your heavenly father cannot tell you a lie he's god he can't lie and when you believe him with all your heart and you believe that what you asked for you ask it not for a selfish motive but your right motive behind there is asking it for the glory of god and believe without a shadow of doubt that your father wouldn't lie to you something's going to take place when you get all the cockle burrows out of the way and just look straight there to calvary and believe it with all your heart amen getting all the cocker barrels out of the way getting all the thoughts and everything else let me just say this to you satan will sit right there and try to charge you try to accuse you he'll try to say everything he can but you've got to clear those cocker barrels out of the way you gotta you got to reject it you got to turn it down listen even satan would sit there on a person's shoulder and tell them the holy ghost ain't for you god will never tell anybody that but the holy spirit will always draw his children to himself he's here to energize our faith in him who made the promise whether it's healing deliverance whatever it might be he's here to energize us in his promises oh my get all the cocker bros out of the way sometimes sometimes that's some real work right there getting all the cocker bros out of the way getting all the thoughts and everything else out of the way is that right a lot of things can come around our way in the midst of a circumstance i'm not just talking about what we're saying here but sometimes even what we're saying here there might we can feel different pressures and things coming around us but we're standing there upon that word and we're speaking that word we're standing behind that word we're laying hold upon that word no matter how i feel no matter of what type of darkness might try to come around i don't care how much darkness it can try to come upon light darkness can't put out light it cannot put out light light itself is an overcomer against darkness it doesn't matter all the dark faults and everything else that can come your way let me tell you something you think the enemy's just going to step back when a situation rises you think he's just going to stand back and not try to be there to try to whisper and come around in your way sure he's going to be there to do that but that's an opportunity to stand right there on your god-given ground and say i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day is to stand there upon that word and let the light press back the darkness [Applause] hallelujah let me remind you you were sometimes darkness you weren't just in it we were darkness but there was a part on the inside hallelujah it was a redeemable seed a redeemable wick of almighty god and god himself came by the power of his spirit and he brought light into her life amen and that light itself brother it cannot be put out but that light it begins to press out it presses every bit of darkness out of the life hallelujah you now are light in the lord hallelujah jesus said ye are the light of the world is that right the scripture said yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil he didn't say the dark dark valley that that's somebody's aaron interpretation but it says the valley of the shadow of death in order for there to be a shadow there must be light presence and light is what shows the way that same light that comes there when a saint is crossing from this dimension into that dimension is the same light of god that came and shot you out and brought a real revelation in your heart it's the same light that lit you up and change your whole countenance from that of darkness to now light in the lord so i summarize and put all that together is to cast down every thought of darkness what's every thought of darkness anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of god anything that rises its tongue in judgment against god's word and let me just let you know you and the word are not two separate things there's been a united with jesus christ when the baptism of the holy ghost has come that's the word of god made flesh inside of your life amen that's the standard that god promised in this hour when the enemy comes in like a flood i the lord will rise a standard against it his standard is not outside the body his standard is himself the word inside of the body amen amen amen hallelujah oh glory glory glory oh my i just can't preach for preaching let me lay this in here a little bit you see paul would speak about faith and paul would talk about and he would speak in verse nine you see it's to give the people a perfect confidence the only place faith can rest is in the word of god i love how brother graham says that in third exodus he said faith finds its place in the word of god and it worships in the temple of god's word faith worships there in the temple of god's word it's a place where a promise has been made real to you and you can stand right there in that place and worship god it's finished it's over there might be aches and pains and everything else that's still on doctor's reports but it's finished in the presence of god the holy spirit is the final court of appeal and it is spoken it is finished hallelujah and this is what paul is expressing a confidence where the church of the living god has their faith placed in the word of god and he says in verse 9 to make all men see what is the fellowship the joint participation of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord i don't care how many devils they can line up you can't stop the purpose of god satan tried to burn them up he tried to stop them tried to feed them to lions but you can't stop that life some were delivered and others their testimony as they stood there and fire consumed them the lions ripped them apart but you could not destroy that life brother they had already passed from death unto life they stood there in the midst of that time like polycarp he ain't never done me nothing but good and polycarp himself would stand there and say you don't need to tie me up he said you don't need to do that i will gladly stand right here and as polycarp was walking there there was a voice out of heaven that spoke to polycarp play the man polycarp play the man be of courage in this hour oh god then lost track of you god ain't lost track of you he knows exactly where you are knows exactly what you're going through knows exactly the circumstances the same god that was in control of all the rest of them and watching over and was there to minister to their life is the same god that's watching over your life and to minister to you and me even throughout all of our tests and trials and afflictions he's the same god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness in whom see in him we have boldness and excess and access with confidence by the faith of him this is not my faith it's his faith it's his faith that moves our faith are you with me our faith alone is not enough it'll give out but his faith there is no giving out we could look all the way down through the time in the building of the masterpiece here you have a noah here you have an abraham but the faith of god could not give out the faith of god is there to perform and bring to pass his word even when sarah as we looked at last week she and herself she could not see it within her but she received of the angel's visitation receive strength into her life to be changed and conceive the seed of the word of promise and bring forth isaac who was it it was god's work hallelujah you love him you keep praying and i'll keep preaching in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him this is a real confidence that christ ephesians 3 17 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love galatians 2 20 i am crucified with christ this is where confidence comes from i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh there was a life a different life he lived at one time but the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so this is the faith that jude wrote about under inspiration let us contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints is that right that faith is the love of god it is the real true personal experience of the baptism of the holy ghost being enthroned in the life of the believer this is the faith that we contend for this is the faith that we are born of this is the faith that overcometh the world hallelujah oh my the same faith that was there that god dwell alone and in his mind and god could step and speak his word and when he spoke his word he believed his word his word would come to pass he would bring it to pass that same faith what was once in god's mind is now in the heart of the believer what is it that same faith it's a faith in the word of god that's unadulterated of faith that stands there and says that though in myself i may not feel worthy but i'm not worthy based on my worthiness i am made worthy by the blood of the lamb what are you doing poking holes in those thoughts of darkness [Applause] hallelujah cast them off this is why when brother branham would he would take this fault i'm going to read this here in just a minute but recognizing of how that god would bring through there the water the blood and the spirit all three that are needed even in natural birth it comes but even here in the spiritual birth there must be that of the water the blood and the spirit it all comes together to make a complete birth water alone just just a justified life though it's wonderful to know and to recognize you come to a place of repentance and to recognize the lord jesus christ as your lord and savior and you're convicted of the wrong you're convicted of your life and you realize there is this one the living god that's convicting my life i want to serve him i want to turn my life over to him that's what the preaching of the word or the waters of separation it does it brings the sinner or the individual to a recognition that there is one who can take care of the sin question in your life you're not hopeless you're not without a hope there's a god who can come down and deal with the question in your life hallelujah and the blood comes forth that blood and how that it was applied it's a blood that then cries out that there is a sanctification of that of a power within that blood that can actually break the very hold of sin upon a life of all of the cleansing and taking out all the things of the world and make way for what for the very life of almighty god to come on the inside and that life is nothing less than the seed word may manifest it's nothing less than god himself imparting a part of himself which was that inheritance that belonged to you before the foundation of the world and god himself is not giving you something that doesn't belong to you when you've asked god for the holy ghost you're not asking him for something that doesn't belong to you you're asking him for your inheritance my part in you lord and it's him that inspires you to ask for it hallelujah and then when that happens i know this is a simple one i'm going to read but i'm going to read it anyhow he says then he says he says you get acquainted with god and you'll see his great move in nature you'll see him in the sunsets in the flowers in everywhere you can see him all around you because he's all around you that gives you perfect confidence that you're in love with him i'm just going to preach as it comes there's certain things that you know brother aaron you and i might be out of store and i could look at now i may not tell you but i could look at and think my wife would like that or i could tell you you know what she wouldn't like that she could also tell you right now somebody say oh brother samuel like this now she may not want to hurt your feelings but she know he won't like that i know him is that right right because you know him we know him is that right you're so in love with him to ask brother baby saying in nature you can't help but see god there's things that you see around you god speaks to your heart oh my there's things that here you can get to looking at some things i think about when i was teaching school you know and i'd be teaching there about seed and you know germination and going through that there was a couple times where an amen just slipped loose right in the classroom oh my there were things you know i remember when i would go i had to do a basic art class you know that that everybody had to do kind of for whatever degree they're going into and i would you know that god had just got a hold of my life and man i was i was my drawings and things like that i thought well i ain't much of an artist so i'm just going to paint the things that to me you know that that really inspire me now they believe me there weren't no drawings that anybody would have bid on or nothing like that kindergartners won't even bid on them but i had you know pyramids and capstones and seeds and everything else and when they would ask me now sam what does all of this mean right here and i could stand right there within that art class and begin to speak about coming to maturity a seed that is planted in faith now look i wasn't preaching to them but yet without the scriptures yet i was letting them know certain things this is what it meant to me oh my wasn't it different when god got a hold of your life like brother brown said the birds sing different there's things that stood out differently after god got a hold of your life oh brother it's something about it you're so in love with him like it is to your spouse you would say he like that oh i see god right there i see god right there it's just like you know your spouse and your spouse knows you and say boy they like that man they like this they like that that's because you are in love that gives you perfect confidence that you're in love with him you're you're you're he's in love with you he loved you predestinated you for ordained you before the world begin now don't eat this part right here like a white castle hamburger but just take it in really digest it he loved you predestinated you for ordained you before the foundation before the world began and has brought you here saved you cleansed you up and filled you with the his spirit how could you doubt that gives you a perfect setting of faith you know what any good story has a setting is that right there's a setting where things take place and there's a setting where believers manifest as sons and daughters of god there is a setting there is a place in christ this is where all spiritual blessings are at it's in christ this gives a perfect setting that gives you a perfect setting of faith when you know those things that gives you courage oh my you know where you're standing well what's this perfect setting here of faith here as paul would say in romans 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death to me made free from it is you have been set at liberty you and i were enclosed we were in bondage under that first birth oh there was a desire that was there a desire you know there was things about us that you couldn't fit in there were things and how god would even begin to deal with our life there was a desire that was there on the inside but it was housed in or closed off from actually coming into a full expression with him but because and through and by his redemptive work in our life the surrender the submissive how the spirit of god would move us into that place we are no longer tied to that old man as a matter of fact the old man doesn't live here when there's deliveries of mail and everything else that would want to come to that address you can stand there with a clear assurance there is no condemnation the man that used to do those things and love those things he don't live here no more rts return to satan amen there's no condemnation because when you look back you know when i was back there there's been no continuance on that here is that right you can see it in your own life it's a liberty that's come inside of you it's not well if i can just do this if i can just hold on here no it's a liberty that comes inside here that's what the real baptism of the holy ghost does it brings a liberty in your life a joy with the word of god oh my you see this is why as brother brandon would put it in this way of conquering and he would speak of what conquering itself how faith is a victory and what it means to conquer conqueror means that you have whipped it you have overcome it you've beat it down you put it in handcuffs i got to read some of this here it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means you've overcome it you've whipped it you're greater than it is now brother man asks very simple questions he said what was first a savior or a sinner savior sinner come after but a savior was first so which one's greater a savior what was first healer or sickness healer so which one's greater healer is that right so then how that god himself will manifest himself to the believer through the believer that he is the greater one he's greater than sin he's greater than sickness he's greater than disease because he was before all things and by him all things consists that ah who are we talking about we're talking about the lord jesus christ is that right and him dwelling within that life he is before all things he is the eternal one is that right and that eternal life in you works in you because the seed of god was laying within you the whole time as part of the eternal oh my brother brown would say it like this i'm just trying to get somewhere he said when you know that jesus died for your sins and you've accepted him as your savior and you've got the holy ghost and by his stripes you were healed if you know that truth that truth alone makes you free amen no need of prayer it's not praying it's just believing believing the truth now i'm going to read all this quote sometimes we have to pray to bring that truth to our hearts that truth alone makes you free but sometimes we have to pray to bring that faith close to our hearts is that right because sometimes i'm sorry i know not everybody's an angel but just to understand that there's sometimes we get a little weak sometimes we need a little encouragement sometimes we need to hear a testimony sometimes we need to hear of what god did for somebody else sometimes we need to hear those things brother and let me just say not just sometimes we need to talk of all of his doings we need to lift him up and exalt him that he's still god in the midst of his people he's still god in the calf of his children sometimes our faith needs strengthened amen glory be to god oh my so i'm gonna preach here this sometimes we have to pray we have to pray to bring that truth to our hearts but god gives us every inch of material that there is of the kingdom of god to work with i got to go back on this sometimes we have to pray to bring that truth to our hearts what truth that truth alone makes you free brother you're not coming back to a it's not something of a different truth but every time where faith is pulsating in your heart it's coming back to that truth alone and that truth is what has made you free amen sometimes you get to looking out here or you're looking at this but remember your authority isn't out here looking at this but your authority is looking away to jesus and he's not far off but he's right there dwelling inside of your life amen no man speaketh by the spirit called jesus accursed but only amanda called jesus the lord by the holy ghost he's the lord of my life he's the ruler in my life he's supreme deity in my life he's in control in my life he is the chief influence in my life he is my life oh my brother samuel what are you doing i'm rehearsing that truth alone that has made me free hallelujah glory be to god if you know that truth oh my i don't seem like i can get out of this one sometimes we have to pray to bring that truth to our hearts but god gives us every inch of material that there is of the kingdom of god to work with aren't you glad for that to bring faith to the people gifts signs wonders everything to do it but when he does it it's a finished work when he does it to you and you believe it and accept it then your healing is that's all just all there is to it you have to believe the word of god in luke 17 5 here the the apostles as they speak to the lord jesus they said increase our faith that word increase right there you know to me i appreciate how they had enough humility to say you know what increase our faith amen i want to have enough humility you see because the enemy is always busy trying to tell you you don't have no faith you don't have enough faith you don't have this and you don't have that but i want to be able just to stand there and say lord increase my faith oh my you see the real revelation of this truth does not make us arrogant does not make us puffed up does not make us in a place to where man i've got everything all together no it puts us in a place to realize we are nothing without him we can do nothing without him and sometimes god will permit circumstances to come our life we will pray we'll pray write request after request and it seems like nothing is moving at all but it's a trying that's going on a trying of our faith a trying in the midst of that time will we stand on that promise or will we back up from it amen hallelujah increase our faith that means to add that means to bring together in company and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you now you didn't say you had to have big faith right you didn't make faith it's needed it can be a the faith just of a grain of a mustard seed how many of you ever seen a grain of mustard seed well if you haven't you i don't got one here but it's very tiny it's very tiny it's one of those things that you've got you know sometimes other things you got to be careful even in your touch of it that it don't get just stuck to your finger it's that small it's very small but that all that's needed he said is a faith of the grain of the size of a mustard seed that doesn't mean we can puny faith what it means is it's faith that won't mix with nothing else it won't mix with nothing else i don't care if all of the explanations of everything that the devil would like to run down all of his reasonings but this faith won't unite with reasonings of the enemy oh my so here increase our faith notice how jude would write this here in jude 1. he said beloved building up yourselves on your most holy face so strengthening ourselves praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life brother brown picks it up here in desperations father god our whole life is wrapped in that the token it's for you and you are our life there's some here lord that even holds this token that i spoke of they possess that token and yet they're sick i want to speak tonight on giving them courage to encourage them to take that god-given rights they have a right to defeat that devil he is already defeated and he's just bluffing them i'm claiming them father oh my he said help me lord that you would get in the word that lord as you get in the word and give them faith for the glory of god you've heard this quote many times spirit spiritual food and new season brother brown would address the congregation we're getting ready to have a healing service tonight and he said what we want you to do you need to be built up in the faith of this hour the of the holy oracles of almighty god the faith not of a different hour the faith of this hour that what god has promised in this hour this is the faith of the living god that's been delivered to the church of god in this hour to be built up in this faith is that right now notice how he would make this statement he would say so now he says because it's going to take more faith than ever before it's going to take rapturing faith in all things i want you said you to believe in all you have seen heard the word you have been preached the signs and wonders that you've seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it be god or not now let me pause here for a minute sometimes when we get into the mopeses it's because we stop thinking about all and accumulating all that god has done let me just tell you something this message you are a part of it amen god said behold i send unto you you elijah the prophet three people in that verse i send elijah unto you what was elijah's ministry to bring him back to the altar of god to call him back to the true atonement to call him back to a perfect vindication that he steal the same living god and he still answers by fire god did that for me and you [Music] and now the same fire that came upon the word that same fire is burning in your life accumulate if you let a liar talk to you he'll keep feeding your lies he'll point out everything hold every wrong he'll point out everything about it all your mistakes and you keep listening to them you keep taking it in keep taking it in there's an accumulation it starts going on is that right then you've got to get that channel blown out well brother brown called it a flu in another message is that right see it's to stand there not upon we're not standing on our righteousness we're standing in his righteousness it's not my righteousness it's not my goodness it's not your goodness we have not brought ourselves in he has brought us in hallelujah let me say this this morning he is the living god that if you're outside of the economy of god all you have to do is release your thoughts and relinquish the things of the world and say god i die to it right here lord i cast it aside right here lord i want to be united with you lord jesus you don't got to go through purgatory this is purgatory right now the word comes with power and authority to cleanse you it ain't there just to point fingers at you the word is to cause you to look away to jesus there is a cleansing flow that can change your nature it'll master that circumstance of sin it'll overcome sin in your life i can't help but think brother brown stood there and christ the mystery he said now i'm going to read luke 24 he said but i'm going to take the entire bible for my text it's accumulation this is an open book in this hour the lamb has taken the book is revealing listen these aren't just bible stories back here it's revealing the very the very scarlet cord of redemption all the way through when we read about ruth we're not just reading about some woman who was a morbidite we see our own selves in there we were born under a curse as well come on now there was no way for us to enter into the congregation of the lord but he hath made us accept it in the belevan we needed a kinsmen and god himself came down and became our kinsmen our boaz to bring us into the covenant of promise so when they could look at ruth in the field they could look at ruth while she was there what are you doing here i got a right to be here what authority do you got to be here because i came back with naomi and bo has you have a problem with me being in this field go talk to the lord of the harvest he's the one who told me to stay here hallelujah [Applause] he told me to stay here he told me to keep eating he told me to rest right here he told me to dwell right here you see this is where the power of abiding under the word and feeding on the word not just listening to it but taking it in it'll bring change it'll bring faith in your life to reach out for the promises of god you're a moabite you don't belong here but he said i should be here he told me to stay here then there's then there's the uniting that takes place it doesn't matter what they want to say at that point in time her reproach has been removed when she's been united with boha's brother her reproach has been removed let me tell you something you don't have a reproach on your life if you've been born of the spirit of god and you can look back in your life and you know there's come a change in your life just tell that old devil to shut up there's not a reproach on your life you are the redeemed of the lord you've got a right to be here in this field you've got a right to enjoy this word you've got a right to live victorious in this hour john had the glorious vision there on the isle of patmos he receives the revelation of jesus christ john why are you here on the isle of patmos well i don't want to take too much time but well john is tell me what everything's like no how about i just tell you why i'm here i'm here by a divine appointment you realize there's nothing that can come your way unless god first permits it john could stand there in a perfect peace listen to me now in the midst of the trial something that took years in joseph's life to come about before he could stand there and tell his brethren what you meant for evil god meant for good but this is because of that life that now he's not just under that life but john is dwelling in that life you think they're wanting thoughts and things of darkness to come around when you realize that you did what is in your bosom could set lives free it could change situations how many times you talk to people in the world and they can come or you see people in the workplace and if you think if they would just open if they would just receive if they would just take it and you don't got to preach a whole sermon to them but if they would just receive the lord jesus christ if they would just receive what god has placed into your bosom you know that's the answer you'd be able to tell them you don't need a psychiatrist you don't need this you don't need that you don't need this you need to meet the lord jesus now i'm not against doctors you know that but you understand what i'm saying if they just can come to that place here is john on the isle of patmos for the word of god and the testimony of the lord jesus christ now that revelation that he receives is a revelation of the mighty conqueror can i read these scriptures here i think it's fitting here he reveals himself to john i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty revelations 1 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me and said fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death what's he doing revealing himself as the mighty conqueror and what is john seeing the mighty conqueror oh my to really see him as the mighty conqueror brother when you catch a hold of that your troubles vanish it doesn't mean circumstances go away it doesn't mean the troubles just go away but it means looking at it because you're looking at it not through the eyes of a mortal or intellectual faith but you're looking at it through the eyes of the faith of almighty god and you see the circumstance it's already been conquered revelations 21 verse 5 and he that set on the throne behold he said behold i make all things new aren't you glad for that aren't you glad he just didn't put a little bit of rubber cement on you let me add this on here no god comes with a complete transformation i make all things new churches they might make things this way that way but he makes all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is of a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son now to overcome that means there's got to be tests anybody like tess don't raise your hand nobody likes tests you don't even like tests in school do you i mean i didn't either i mean i never look forward to that boy man i can't wait for this test and none of us look forward to the tests or trials boy lord i can't wait lord when's my next trial something wrong there i'm wrong there because you don't have to ask for them they are appointed by god it's not an accident god don't get the wrong test with the wrong person and oh my goodness i got the wrong results here no it's it's made up god knows how we're made up god knows how we're made up and remember what the test is all about the test itself is that the faith might declare itself in the midst of our life because as far as the humanity part even that of the spirit those things themselves can fade right away it takes where times that you and i get strong and it allowed the tester trial the fiery trial allows the strength that part in our life to get melted down that's why paul said for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter right for what reason that his life might be made manifest in our life so there's got to be a test that comes our way can i have just a few more moments there must be a there must be tests that come our way so tess brother brown would say like this he says the test themselves he says it's it's this is the greatest thing that ever happened to you how many of you are thinking about tests like that this sounds like some of those things you need to cut out and put on the refrigerator or put it on your phone or your your you know your screen when it comes up it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you what is the test because the test itself is what displays a child of god everyone that cometh to god must be tested and tried all along the way even when god makes a call upon a person's life there's testing that comes on they'll have to maybe go through mockery and ridicule will they stand the test when oh i don't know if i can do that in front of you know my husband my wife or children or whatever they are tested there's many things that that comes their way that are tested to see are they going to go on that's the same thing that happened with the children of israel they were they came to test after test after test but those tests were nothing more than proving grounds are you hearing me if the tests were not you and i look at oh my look how many complain that god or in the time of gideon oh my look how many went running back home you're looking at the wrong thing look how many remained the test wasn't about that we focus on how many people depart come on now the test is not about that the test is is that which remains gideon started out with a big ol army man he well lord i mean i'm a little bit under undersized but you know what i i just i'm thankful lord i know that you're with us and god lets him know cut it down right here you know what he's doing mastering circumstances but god is helping get in is that right everything now you can look at and say oh he don't oh my i don't need that fleece i don't need that sheep well david didn't need to lay down a fleece for god either but it didn't make david no greater than gideon god knows how to work with ev each and every one of us the experiences remember our experiences from the baptism of the holy ghost to every experience in our life is predestinated by the hand of almighty god god knows how to deal with this guy god knows how to deal with you he knows how to minister to our lives is that right god knows that because he he don't have to do it that way but his love towards you and i to do what to bring us up in the place that place of truth where that truth alone makes us free finally he gets down there and says all right i want you bring them to the water hole get in they get them down there and every one of them that bowed down he said send them home lord there's 300 now lord lord there's only 300. look at all of them walking away lord look at all of them turning back lord look at all of them leaving but he said gideon you can't focus on that focus on those that i've given you sometimes we focus on the wrong thing come on friends it isn't an all-believe it's those that stay listen that was believers the whole time the 300 was in there the whole time are you with me bring it down to your life there's a lot of things that's fled away from your life but in the midst of every test and every trial after test after test after trial after trial what's left standing a real believer through every test through every trial and it's that believer that god takes and whips the devil with [Music] hallelujah god reducing it down this is why paul paul could write fight the good fight of faith fight it oppositions all around you and against you circumstances are against you but fight the good fight of faith it's a battle as soon as god begins to deal with the heart it's a battle the enemy wants to start setting in listen to me young people you want to know why the devil has his eyes set on you and would like to get you twisted up and target him with all sorts of things because he knows if that life is turned over to god and god has paid a personal interest in your life he knows if he can just get it tied up in somewhere that's why all hell comes against you because god himself is for you god has something for your life you say brother samuel it seems like everything is coming against me that's because even though you can't see it but god has his eye on your life there's something back down through there that god has his hand upon your life and the devil can't touch that life what should i do i just surrender it to god and say god you that's had your hand upon my life this whole time i just surrender it to you lord it's a battle there's circumstances around you know the devil can get on a person's shoulder and say oh my look at you you're bound with this you got this in your life you're wrapped up with this you're wrapped up with this look at you there ain't no way that you can serve god well certainly you can't serve god with all that in your life but there's a god right here that can set you free he can make you free he can cut you free in your life it ain't about your abilities to do it it's about a living god he's already overcome there's not a devil big enough you say that's a pretty bold challenge i'm saying it because our lord jesus christ has already declared it that's reigning supreme in my heart there's not a devil big enough there's not a sickness big enough there is no demon out of hell that can stand before the living lord jesus christ he could stand throughout this building right here of lies that god has set free are you with me we're not talking about god came and made us good people he came and released the sheep that was on the inside the sheep that was caught [Laughter] but the enemy was right there and trying to pound over a condemnation and bring that about but it's a bad you know what that bad is it's a cry for help and the shepherd himself is the one who responds to that call a sheep can't get itself out of those circumstances but the shepherd is the one who comes to where the sheep is at and loosens the sheep from the barrel patch of sin my my god is preaching personal here fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where unto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses think about jonah i know you've heard this i want you to watch how jonah responded jonah 2 1. i could just run through it but i don't want to run through this the bible says then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly let's just be honest what's the last thing you feel like doing sometimes when there is a test or trial or something that comes your way and sometimes things can come around and try to put pressure let me tell you something this is where we need to resort to to pray and prayer don't mean in the midst of that time oh i got to get away i got to get shut away in a prayer closet no it means just even right then you start praying you just start praying in your heart lord you're in control lord you're in control lord god thou art the almighty what are you doing you're fellowshipping with him with the revelation of jesus christ that's there burning in your heart and i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice for thou hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compass me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple circumstances i'm cast out of your sight yet yet in the midst of these circumstances i will look again to thy holy temple don't matter if i got seaweed all over me don't matter the smell of the whale's vomit don't matter all the waves the water going over me it doesn't matter that this isn't the perfect ideal circumstance to have a meeting with god but i'm here i'm his child i'm just going to invite him right here yet i will look [Applause] the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed the roundabout the weeds were wrapped about my head i went down to the bottoms of the mountains and the earth with her bars was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption oh lord my god when my soul fainteth within me i remembered the lord that truth alone makes you free and when my soul fainted that this must be it i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple they that observe focus on lying vanities forsake their own mercy what were the lying vanities they weren't mythful thoughts if god doesn't intercede this is it he's in a situation nobody's ever been in before all right are you with me nobody's ever been in this before jonah himself does not have a scripture to go back on he does not have something that he can go back on and say oh this person you know they were ate by a well or they were obeyed by something like this and and god brought them through but what he did have is if any of my people if they be in trouble at any time in the land they didn't even have to be in the land of israel but in the land where they are and be thank themselves and humble themselves and call on my name then i will hear from heaven he had confidence i'm going to preach a little bit that devil could have come there and told jonah and said you know what wasn't that a man by the name of solomon you know what happened to solomon at the end don't you i wonder if everything he said was wrong oh boy we're getting down now i wonder i wonder wasn't he the son of david wasn't weren't those parts look at their lives but you see jonah was a believer like abraham he was able to recognize god he was able to recognize not the fallibility of a man but the infallible god that operated through solomon's life are you with me it wasn't solomon that gave himself that gift it was god who placed that gift for his people and it was a channel that god would come down and speak to his people and minister to their needs and jonah's confidence was in the living god it was a revelation to his hearts his heart these are not the words of solomon these are the words of almighty god and you know what that was that's an absolute it's a revelation that paul said it in the midst of that hour when everything every lying vanity was around every circumstance was all against him but in the midst of it faith poked right through the circumstance faith said they're nothing but lying vanities he never said oh no there's there's no seaweed no there was seaweed right but he didn't let the circumstances stop him you see faith brother branham words it like this faith knows no age limit nor circumstances it doesn't matter how old you are oh you know these kind of things come with age but you're a child of god you we don't have to sign for things and live with things just because of age faith knows no age limit it knows no circumstance are you with me let's look at another young man by the name of caleb oh my i know he grow older but yet he was still young his his heart oh my it was tender before god and when it came over to crossing into the land remember there were those who stood there at that time and said we're not able to do it the giants are bigger oh my you don't understand what this is all about but they were focusing on all of the circumstances that told them you can't take it but they messed up they should have been focusing on the god who brought them out the god who sent him a message a prophet with a pillar fire and spoke to them he didn't deliver him with the mighty a mighty hand of another army it was the mighty hand of jehovah amen and then all through all through where the lamb's blood all the way through then the wilderness the parting of the red sea the man of falling the quail everything along the way it should have been a place that their focus became so wrapped up on god you see what should have happened an accumulation of all that god had done to consider god that brought me this far will safely take me on and caleb told him he said when i was on the other side before we ever got in the land i brought back word again as it was in my heart glory to moses i was not speaking something back that i wasn't a part of or there wasn't a part of me i was declaring what had gripped my heart are you with me if thou believest in thy heart yes let me come back to joan our close look for jonah in the midst of this verse 9 but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving jonah does that mean after you've come out of the belly of the well does that mean that after everything is good to go and everything is no it's right while i was having to like picking a hair out of your mouth or something taking that seaweed and moving all around me i will offer up to him a sacrifice of praise jonah in these conditions he's worthy that's why it's a sacrifice of phrase a voice of thanksgiving for he has redeemed me and i will pay that that i have out salvation is of the lord and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited jonah up on the dry land that fish had got enough it got enough oh there was a worship going on down there he was having a time brother to think of it the very presence of god had come right down there where jonah was and finally here it come to that place that fish said it's enough but it was under the leading of god it couldn't have happened any sooner it had to be even when all of those from nineveh different ones would be there to witness it and he would walk out of the belly of a well amen oh my god aren't you grateful that the lord jesus christ has walked right out of the pages of the word aren't you glad that he got up on that easter morning aren't you glad that even after churches and everything else have wanted to put him back away and seal him away keep his presence away from the church of the living god and just make it nothing more but form enrichment tradition aren't you glad that he rose again according to his word and he manifests himself in glory and power it's a master over every circumstance faith in your life is a master over every circumstance even the faith of god that's pulsating to your life maybe you're without the holy ghost maybe you haven't even surrendered your heart to god but the faith of god god's love can be pulsating to your heart to do what surrender what's he doing he's bringing your confidence in him who is the word so that when you come for a promise you're not coming on well i wonder if it's so or not he makes a personal visit to your heart he's the one that inspires faith listen the holy ghost does not come to a person's life without faith it comes it comes because faith has begun to move in that heart and that heart is desiring more and desiring god more than anything else in that life what's it doing it's inspiring faith that that promise is for me no matter how many devils try to sit on the shoulder and say you'll never happen it'll never be for you it'll never but see what faith does faith rest upon that word to say god made a promise it belongs to me it's the same way it is with healing in your body it's the same way it is with deliverance it's the same way it's god pulsating to your heart to come and to stand upon that word it's a mastering of circumstances a lot of bleak circumstances can be about and can be around your life but like abraham you can stand right there and though every circumstance around you his body was getting weaker older who against hope believed in hope being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform god's bring speaks to abraham i'm done abraham lovest thou me lord i love you take isaac thine only son and come and offer him unto me look what abraham says right here in genesis 22 he speaks out to those that's accompanying around you stay here with the asses i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again what was it faith mastered the circumstance but god told him to offer him up but abraham's faith said god made a promise that through this seed this seed had be a father of many nations and so god accounted abraham accounted god able to raise him from the dead well was it faith produced by divine love daddy we've got the wood we've got everything where's the sacrifice that daddy my son god will provide for himself a sacrifice faith mastered the circumstance it was faith said i don't know how he's going to do it but he's going to do it i don't know how that all these the atoms on my body will be changed but he's going to do it i don't know how it's all going to happen but i know he's going to do it what are you going to do i'm going to keep eating keep feeding i'm going to keep in the midst of testing trials and asking god god give me grace for this test and trial lord help me lord god the lord i can be molded more and more into a place lord give me grace lord in the midst of the tests and trials with situations that arise to look to you that no matter the circumstance greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world you see it's fellowshipping lord jesus i pray lord the words lord you've laid on my heart lord to speak here lord you know that for months where this outlined lord the most part where it's laid lord even dear god not even even considering it lord even of yesterday thanking lord in a different channel different places lord we've been studying having lord two other outlines dear god i first of all want to say i

fellowship with you there's many things i could look at and say oh lord oh this that's such a blessing and to take it away tuck it away over here not knowing sometimes lord when maybe to bring this or bring that but lord i can't do it without you you've led us lord to this moment in this service as i sit back there lord god even looking over [Music] these things lord and just praying you're god hearing lord how that brother brian he would just lord just yield to you and that song after song after song would just speak lord god of this moment lord i want to take this time and say thank you

say thank you lord thank you lord god for the things that you've laid on our hearts through the week maybe scriptures we've read across messages we've listened to lord thoughts lord god that have been

as the pastor know lord different needs of healing in their body or maybe their spirit lord lord lord some in their soul but father my prayer is unto you and lord jesus says you've come right down here this morning and you've spoke to our hearts to encourage every person that's gathered here lord god this morning even those that lord god will be gathered by way of the internet or archive this this service lord that father the circumstances that lord god that they might be facing [Music] circumstances that's in their life lord jesus i pray this morning lord may their lord their heart just reach right out to you lord lord jesus those that lord their life has has been so touched by you you're the joy of their life lord they're walking in that place with you lord there is no condemnation lord god the light is burning lord jesus lord though the winds might blow but it's not a light that man has lit it's the shekinah light of almighty god and lord jesus there's circumstances lord they can gather around circumstances things that can come lord in their spirit or in their body lives like the prophet mentioned that they're in the message desperation they've got the token but lord satan has come and afflicted him with a sickness maybe he's afflicted with something lord god and lord jesus would want to whisper that well this is age related or this is that but lord jesus i pray this morning lord you're god that you'll just move right up next to him right as you have been in this service may you just speak to their hearts lord father this truth alone that makes us free lord oh god the lord jesus whether it would be lord of laying on of hands whether it would be lord god right there in their seat lord you know father but this is one thing that must be no matter lord where they're at is lord god that it would come right back to that truth that truth alone that makes them free may lord god i pray you just would cause the lord cause their faith to rise in you lord jesus it's you faith is the wire that releases the flow lord god right now may they lord jesus under the authority of your word renounce every fear every doubt every devil lord that would raise its tongue in judgment against him lord god i pray heavenly father that you would move lord right now may they lord jesus i pray take lord god your word and lord jesus that lord from their heart as they would place it upon their lips lord god may they speak to this mountain lord god lord jesus like jonah was in the belly of the well as abraham walked even when he walked up mount moriah as caleb stood there lord god and joshua that day lord jesus as daniel stood there when daniel knew they had laid a trap for him your prophet tells us lord that daniel knew that they had laid a trap for him he said but david or daniel in humility not arrogantly but in humility he prayed because he was being tested on the word would he still look away to thy holy temple and pray lord jesus i believe i'm speaking to believers and i believe i'm one of them that lord jesus we're not here arrogantly lord jesus we know there's traps there's things that's all around but there's a test and that test is whether we're going to stand on the word [Music] lord jesus may we lord as paul would say having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth oh lord god every part of the armor the helmet of salvation lord god to know that i am his the breastplate of righteousness to know that it's his love that burns in my heart i do only those things that please him that's my desire our feet to be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace having on that lord god shield of faith whereby we might quench every fiery dart of the enemy and the sword of the spirit and praying without ceasing lord jesus i ask this morning lord for these different needs that are gathered here lord lord jesus you don't come by and inspire our hearts and speak to us lord just to take up our time there's needs right here this morning lord now i pray father may this be a moment lord of mastery glory lord god where circumstances are mastered lord faith rises lord god in you who made the promise lord i pray dear god whether to be young middle-aged old whatever they might be lord if there's one here that doesn't know you they've never surrendered their heart fully to you lord i pray god may they do that just now may this be lord a moment lord god where they will cast down the enemy's lies that they will turn down those lies and all of the circumstances he wants to put around them of why that they really can't be a full-born son or daughter of god i pray right now lord god lord jesus may they cast that down lord god knowing that that's only the enemy lord as a scarecrow lord that would want to try and stop him lord and to try to hinder him lord but may the lord god just turn loose and say lord jesus take me lord god to where you're drawing me to lord god take me lord god to love that pool that i feel lord upon my soul lord god lord jesus i can't let go of these circumstances i can't overcome them in my own self but lord you've already overcome them lord oh lord jesus i
