[35:22] Lord
[35:24] amen he's certainly worthy of all of our
[35:27] praise
[35:28] amen amen uh I was
[35:32] thinking uh I was thinking what brother
[35:35] brandham read read some time ago and he
[35:39] says
[35:40] um he said you wonder what it what makes
[35:44] those people act that way he said there
[35:47] must be something that comes down that
[35:50] excites that
[35:53] nerve and he said it's the spirit of God
[35:56] that comes down that excites that nerve
[35:59] when you get to thinking about what he's
[36:02] done for
[36:03] you where he's brought you
[36:08] from you
[36:11] know brother Bram will go on to say in
[36:13] another place he said we don't build
[36:15] upon emotion he said but when God's done
[36:19] something for
[36:20] you it'll
[36:22] follow according to how we're made up
[36:25] right according to how we're made up
[36:27] amen how we're made up but I'll tell you
[36:30] what God is so good isn't he he he's so
[36:34] good he's so worthy all of our
[36:36] praise amen so good to be together
[36:39] tonight in his presence
[36:41] and so we just want to just approach the
[36:45] word of the Lord tonight and just ask
[36:49] the Lord just to come and speak to our
[36:51] hearts that's what that's what we need
[36:53] we we need to hear from him tonight we
[36:56] have needs in our Liv lives and God is
[36:59] certainly mindful of that so let's just
[37:02] let's just approach the throne of God
[37:04] here this evening
[37:06] together Heavenly
[37:09] Father how we so thank you Lord for your
[37:12] mercies once
[37:15] again Lord
[37:18] Jesus what a privilege it is Lord that
[37:22] that we have to serve you
[37:25] Lord oh God it's not not something that
[37:28] we have to
[37:30] do but Lord It's the very desire from
[37:33] our hearts
[37:36] Lord You're The One Lord you made a way
[37:40] that that desire could be
[37:42] expressed thank you Jesus and through
[37:45] that way that was made Lord for us as we
[37:47] have by Your Grace been LED and brought
[37:51] into that way you're the same one Lord
[37:55] that makes a way that that desire
[37:58] oh God it's the very thing Lord in our
[38:01] lives that directs us moment after
[38:03] moment with one desire to please you
[38:08] Lord as David said this is our
[38:12] confidence this one thing have I
[38:16] desired and I will seek after that I may
[38:19] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[38:22] days of my life to behold his Beauty and
[38:27] to inquire at his Temple Lord Jesus this
[38:31] is this is our desire Lord You're
[38:34] Everything To Us Lord you are all in all
[38:39] now Lord as we these moments have been
[38:42] set aside Lord and all the sacrifice and
[38:47] all that is went in Lord for us to be
[38:50] here it certainly Lord is nothing
[38:52] comparable to the sacrifice that you
[38:54] have made for us but tonight Lord we ask
[38:57] that you would give us
[38:59] strength Lord God even to be able to
[39:01] step aside for a few moments Lord from
[39:04] the cares of life and the tiredness and
[39:07] weariness Lord that maybe Lord that
[39:10] would be around us we ask that God that
[39:12] you would just come in a special way now
[39:15] and speak to our hearts Lord I pray
[39:19] heavenly father if there's anything Lord
[39:21] that we have said or done Lord we ask
[39:24] that you would forgive us Lord we
[39:26] pray Lord God May the word of God just
[39:29] move in Upon Us in a special way change
[39:32] us Lord I pray May our hearts be changed
[39:35] May our minds Lord our thoughts oh God
[39:38] every bit of us Lord I pray help us Lord
[39:42] tonight we love you and we thank you
[39:44] Lord we commit this service and all that
[39:47] would be said or done Lord to your glory
[39:49] now in the name of Jesus Christ
[39:54] amen amen I'm going to ask you if you
[39:58] would to turn with me to two places of
[40:00] scripture
[40:04] tonight and uh Proverbs chapter 16 and
[40:08] verse
[40:16] 32 you have to forgive us we um the
[40:20] program we use
[40:22] the I told you before brother Brian
[40:24] created all that for us that where I can
[40:27] submit my notes and you know how things
[40:30] go with
[40:30] technology and uh just let us know that
[40:34] the certificate I don't understand all
[40:36] that but anyway how brother Brian always
[40:38] has to go back and rework that on that
[40:41] program that he's created so um I think
[40:44] it'll be all right we can just follow in
[40:46] a few places here in the
[40:48] scripture in Proverbs
[40:52] 16:32 the scripture says he that is slow
[40:57] to anger is better than the
[41:01] mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit
[41:05] than he that taketh a city so think
[41:09] about that it's one thing for a person
[41:12] to take a city to conquer it but it's
[41:16] another thing to rule
[41:19] it and this is where Solomon is writing
[41:22] this by inspiration you know it's like
[41:25] this once ground has been taken you see
[41:28] this in the Old Testament where Israel
[41:31] would take a take ground take land in
[41:35] the promised land but every bit of
[41:38] ground that they took they had to defend
[41:41] it so every promise that God gives us
[41:45] that Satan's never going to back back
[41:47] down as though he's not going to contest
[41:49] it we always have to stand there in
[41:53] defense and ruling over that in our
[41:56] lives so let's go to Proverbs
[42:00] 25:28 it's very much like like the
[42:04] scripture we just
[42:09] read it says he in Proverbs
[42:13] 2528 he that hath no rule over his own
[42:18] spirit is like a city that is broken
[42:22] down and Without
[42:25] Walls amen that we want to have rule
[42:28] over our own
[42:29] spirit amen and we know that it's what
[42:32] the Holy Spirit comes to equip us to do
[42:35] so that God comes to bring us to a place
[42:38] to where that remember how brother Bram
[42:40] would give that that um statement that
[42:42] was made over and over well brother Bram
[42:45] I can't help it you know the devil just
[42:46] made me do it brother Bram said no the
[42:49] devil didn't make you do it you just
[42:52] went out to him so the thing that we
[42:55] want to do is we definitely want to have
[42:58] those walls built up and God's given us
[43:01] the wall where we're to be fortified
[43:03] behind and that's the word of God that's
[43:06] our place that's our walls that's our
[43:08] strength that's our fortification amen
[43:10] may God bless you and bless the reading
[43:12] of the word as you're being seated I'd
[43:14] like to just continue to speak a little
[43:16] bit more tonight on this thought on
[43:20] framing
[43:22] reality framing
[43:24] reality and uh lot of things that can
[43:28] kind of Escape us and as we kind of
[43:30] looked a little bit last week and we
[43:32] took a certain approach last week and I
[43:35] um not going to go that same angle uh
[43:38] tonight but um really looking at where
[43:41] God has called us to um govern in our
[43:45] own lives and where that the Lord would
[43:49] would ask you and I and require of us
[43:51] really a lot of our Victory depends on
[43:54] of us living from the victory that God
[43:57] God has brought in our lives and then
[43:59] continuing to feed on the right things
[44:03] those are things that we realize that
[44:04] becomes our responsibility to the things
[44:07] that we would feed upon we eat upon we
[44:10] dwell upon we all know that that
[44:12] whatever you feed on or you dwell on
[44:15] will create an atmosphere around you and
[44:18] so these are things that comes down to
[44:19] it so important in our lives where God
[44:22] has entrusted us as a son or daughter of
[44:25] God and so when we look at that there's
[44:27] a lot of things that we can come in
[44:29] contact with my thought on framing
[44:31] reality that there's a lot of things
[44:33] that can present themselves to be real
[44:36] there's a lot of things of conclusions
[44:38] of things we've saw or heard where we've
[44:41] taken those things and drawn conclusions
[44:44] upon them and yet it was not true
[44:49] whatsoever the conclusions that we've
[44:51] drawn now there's a part of us that's
[44:54] made in that way God's made us in that
[44:56] way not that we would be defeated but we
[44:58] want to be under his control I think of
[45:02] how that the prophet over and over as I
[45:05] was just going back through and studying
[45:06] some different parts U just in addition
[45:09] to this and he's talking to different
[45:11] ones that would come across the platform
[45:13] and he would say you're a deep thinker
[45:16] and your whole problem throughout life
[45:18] has been your makeup now God's not going
[45:20] to change our makeup but he says this
[45:23] this is what's led to the conditions in
[45:26] your body the pep ulcer and all these
[45:28] different things and then he'll go
[45:30] through and he'll say quit quit studying
[45:31] so hard you always plan things out and
[45:33] it never happens according to how you're
[45:35] planning it on and on brother bam goes
[45:37] through this now now to me these things
[45:39] are very important this is where the
[45:41] spirit of God would would direct us and
[45:43] and then brother bam will come around in
[45:45] a few different places when he speaks of
[45:47] a deep thinker and he'll say I see
[45:49] you're a deep thinker you really take
[45:50] things to heart he said that's a that's
[45:52] a real good quality now you think of it
[45:55] that in one place to be a deep thinker
[45:57] and to cross Bridges and to plan is that
[46:01] that's a very negative thing can be a
[46:03] very negative thing I mean it's not
[46:04] wrong to be a planner but how many of us
[46:07] have planned things out and it didn't
[46:08] happen anywhere close to the way we had
[46:10] it planned out May maybe thought
[46:12] something was going to happen in a
[46:14] certain way you sat down in a meeting
[46:16] with your boss and man you've it's kept
[46:18] you up all night and you're thinking why
[46:20] is he wanting to meet with me at this
[46:22] time and and here you are you've got all
[46:24] of this formulated that he's going to
[46:26] say this this is going to be my defense
[46:29] and this and then when you get in the
[46:31] office it's nothing like that
[46:34] whatsoever and you're almost at a place
[46:36] you're like man I'm glad that it wasn't
[46:39] that way but do weot oftentimes learn
[46:42] our lessons no when pressures come and
[46:44] nervousness and and sometimes the weary
[46:47] and pressures of life and Satan knows
[46:49] how to come at us like we were looking
[46:51] at last week to try to get us in that
[46:53] place and we'll get so caught up in that
[46:56] but yet knowing that there is a place
[46:59] that God brings you and I to that we
[47:02] that we can live with a real Dominion in
[47:05] our life to where that when the prophet
[47:07] could say in one place about a deep
[47:09] thinker quit planning things quit
[47:11] Building Bridges quit thinking that way
[47:13] quit trying to figure out how God's
[47:15] going to heal you just know that he died
[47:17] for your healing and then on another
[47:19] place you can say wow what a wonderful
[47:22] quality to have you take things to heart
[47:24] you're very sincere what's the
[47:25] difference it's where it comes down to
[47:28] when God is the one who's controlling in
[47:32] our lives see God doesn't come down like
[47:34] we looked at sister Bruce last week and
[47:37] all of those things that God brought out
[47:38] and this is how you're made up Sister
[47:40] Bruce and you get somebody on your heart
[47:42] God puts somebody on your heart to pray
[47:43] for him and you can't you can't stop
[47:45] until you do it well Satan sees that
[47:48] same property and he'll just keep adding
[47:49] things and adding things till eventually
[47:52] you're questioning your own experience
[47:54] you're questioning of where you are
[47:56] where do you stand with God and he can
[47:58] all of those things now the thing that
[48:00] the Holy Spirit never did he never came
[48:02] down and told sister Bruce I'm going to
[48:04] change your makeup your temperament how
[48:06] you're made up but what God comes down
[48:08] to do I'm so glad that he uncovers in
[48:11] that way uncovers that so that you and I
[48:14] can stand there with a real
[48:16] understanding in our life with the
[48:18] Dominion of knowing how that we're made
[48:21] up and that none of those other things
[48:23] no matter even how real that seems God
[48:27] on the scene and we understand then what
[48:31] really is
[48:33] reality there's a lot of things like I
[48:35] said when we could sit in that boss's
[48:37] office that wasn't reality what was end
[48:39] up being said was but we can put all
[48:42] those things together and you know
[48:44] there's things that God will work and
[48:46] he'll operate through that but notice in
[48:49] Nehemiah chapter 2 and I want to just
[48:51] read two vers of scripture Nehemiah 2
[48:53] and verse 17 and this is when Israel has
[48:57] come back into the land uh from which uh
[49:00] God has brought them out of Babylon
[49:02] remember they came in two different
[49:03] groups first it was Ezra that was uh
[49:06] that that came um he comes Ezra comes
[49:09] after there's a group that comes then
[49:11] Ezra comes and then Nehemiah comes and
[49:14] the first group that comes remember
[49:16] they're stirred up and and they
[49:18] establish the Altar and then remember
[49:20] after the enemy battling them battling
[49:22] them for 15 years they lost sight of the
[49:26] purpose that God had brought him back in
[49:27] the land and remember how the enemy
[49:30] attacked him it railed on them with
[49:31] words and the Bible said to frustrate
[49:34] the purpose in other words break the
[49:36] purpose and so as the enemy kept coming
[49:38] with those accusations then we see how
[49:40] God turns that around and then they move
[49:44] back into the purpose and that was to
[49:47] bring back or to erect the Temple of the
[49:50] Living God now before it can ever the
[49:52] temple can ever be erected it has to
[49:54] first start with an altar that's the
[49:55] same way it is in our life our our life
[49:58] our heart must become an altar a place
[50:01] of sacrifice a place of surrender in
[50:03] order for God to build his own his own
[50:06] dwelling place within us and so we we
[50:09] see that when that Temple was built yet
[50:12] the walls of Jerusalem were still torn
[50:15] down the gates were in a mess and you
[50:18] see it just goes to show God doesn't
[50:20] build you and I from the outside in he
[50:23] builds Us From the Inside Out healing
[50:26] does not take place from the outside in
[50:29] it takes place from the inside out and
[50:31] that includes physical healing spiritual
[50:34] healing emotional healing it starts from
[50:36] the inside and works to the outside so
[50:40] when we recognize that has Nehemiah
[50:43] comes back and he comes back with a
[50:45] burden that God has put a burden on his
[50:48] heart it's the time for this to be done
[50:51] it's a time for it to be taken care of
[50:53] and that's the same way that God works
[50:54] with you and I in our lives if God let
[50:57] you and I know when he first got a hold
[51:00] of our life of everything that he was
[51:03] going to accomplish and work out and all
[51:06] of the molding of character in our life
[51:08] through tests and trials and showed us
[51:10] the expanse of that it would overwhelm
[51:12] us at the work that was going to take
[51:16] place in our life we would say how will
[51:19] how will that ever be but you see what
[51:22] God does he doesn't busy himself with
[51:25] letting you and I know all of the A to Z
[51:28] he just brings us to the reality you are
[51:30] my child you've always been my son
[51:33] you've always been my daughter and the
[51:36] spirit of God calls you into that place
[51:38] of submission and makes it real to you
[51:41] and then it's you and I surrendering and
[51:44] submitting to his leading on and on and
[51:48] on to one of these days the final moment
[51:51] of surrender will be the change of the
[51:53] body so notice how that when Nehemiah
[51:57] comes back here he he comes under that
[52:00] burden and God places a burden on his
[52:02] heart to go back to Jerusalem because
[52:04] the walls are are torn down now he says
[52:08] in verse 17 and he goes out to survey it
[52:11] he says you see the distress that we are
[52:13] in how Jerusalem lith waste and the
[52:17] gates thereof are burned with fire come
[52:20] and let us build up the wall of
[52:22] Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach
[52:25] then I told told them of the hand of my
[52:28] God which was up good upon me as also
[52:31] the king's words that he had spoken unto
[52:34] me and they said let us rise up and
[52:38] build so they strengthen their hands for
[52:41] this good work now I I'm going to ask
[52:43] you what was it that caused them to
[52:47] strengthen their hands it was not their
[52:50] Earthly strength when you trace back
[52:53] down to the scriptures the Bible would
[52:55] even say for those Who Rose up to build
[52:58] the Temple of the Lord after being
[53:00] silent for 15 years the Bible says they
[53:03] strengthen their hands to do the work of
[53:06] the Lord and it says the prophets were
[53:09] with them helping them how were the
[53:13] prophets helping them they were speaking
[53:15] to them the word of God their purpose
[53:19] was what was being sat before them and
[53:23] that's where God wants to continually
[53:25] set before you and I is what our purpose
[53:29] is and yet Satan always wants to get us
[53:31] caught down here to looking at things
[53:34] just in the Earthly this Earth and all
[53:37] of the things with it is not my purpose
[53:40] it's not your purpose our purpose is to
[53:43] serve God by his Spirit through his word
[53:48] that's our purpose and then through that
[53:50] it sets everything else in the Earth or
[53:53] allows us to set everything else in its
[53:56] proper order so this where it comes down
[54:01] where all of this is taking place with
[54:03] Nehemiah I want you to notice that as as
[54:06] we were saying the altar was raised
[54:07] first then the temple it was dedicated
[54:10] then Nehemiah returns as we've read and
[54:13] he builds up the walls and Gates and
[54:15] nehemiah's title is a governor that's
[54:18] what he's entitled as he's not a prophet
[54:21] he's not a priest he comes and he is
[54:24] brought into a position as Governor now
[54:27] let me say this to you the scripture
[54:30] tells us that when we have been
[54:32] quickened by the spirit of God it raises
[54:35] up what God has ordained us to be we are
[54:39] Kings and Priests unto our God but
[54:43] there's always that discernment on when
[54:46] do I stand as a priest and when do I
[54:48] operate as a king when do I move as a
[54:51] priest when do I move as a governor when
[54:54] do I operate in those channels and yet
[54:56] we know that it's always of a priest
[54:58] it's always sacrifices unto the Lord
[55:01] It's praying for one another it's you
[55:03] know lifting one another up in prayer
[55:05] it's worshiping the Lord through
[55:07] everything we do our whole life is to be
[55:09] a worship is to be a sweet smelling
[55:11] Savor to him and as a king or a ruler as
[55:15] a governor we have been entrusted that
[55:19] the sin that once ruled us we now rule
[55:23] it we've been entrusted with with this
[55:26] responsibility and let me just say this
[55:28] to you God has not handed you and I a
[55:32] task that is too big for you and I as a
[55:34] son and daughter of God it's too big for
[55:37] you or I in the natural as far as just
[55:40] in our being but remember we're not
[55:42] fighting a flesh and blood Warfare this
[55:45] is a spiritual warfare against spiritual
[55:49] wickedness evil spirits in high places
[55:52] so it's got to be something greater and
[55:55] that is Christ Christ himself veiled in
[55:58] Sons and Daughters of God when we're no
[56:01] longer led by our thoughts and our
[56:04] thinking because look let's just be
[56:06] honest it's our thinking that has got us
[56:08] into trouble it was man surrendering
[56:12] their thinking that led to the fall in
[56:15] the
[56:17] beginning so we need his
[56:22] leadership
[56:24] so brother brand speaks of this in the
[56:26] message the
[56:28] Messiah
[56:30] and speaks of how that within this he's
[56:35] talking about when a person is born
[56:38] again he says the light that comes into
[56:41] him is about like this little white
[56:44] button on my shirt so you got a button
[56:48] on your shirt you can look at it that's
[56:50] about the size of the light as it comes
[56:53] into the
[56:54] man comes into into the inner part of
[56:57] man brother BR says a man is made up in
[57:01] the system of
[57:03] Tabernacles I want you Brianna will you
[57:05] switch over here to that let me just
[57:08] display these I want to just I want to
[57:11] just do this very briefly this my my
[57:14] objective within this T tonight just as
[57:17] this has come and as I I know we may
[57:20] have the connection but I want you to
[57:22] just to be as though we haven't uh maybe
[57:24] heard it but yet just to set it forth in
[57:26] that way that this is when God had them
[57:30] make the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[57:33] God had Moses make this after what he
[57:36] saw in
[57:38] heaven and it was Moses who was caught
[57:40] up in the cloud re in that vision and
[57:44] then communicated what he saw in that
[57:47] vision and and this this is it was
[57:50] speaking of God's dwelling place but it
[57:53] was speaking of something that God was
[57:55] Desiring ing to do God's desire was to
[57:59] dwell in
[58:02] man he walked in man in the beginning
[58:07] they had that Perfect Image in them in
[58:11] the Garden of Eden they were separated
[58:15] from that through the fall so now God
[58:18] this Tabernacle it was also speaking not
[58:22] only of you and I but then how that God
[58:25] himself would come down and pay the
[58:28] price of redemption in order to bring
[58:32] himself back into man and man back into
[58:36] the economy of God he's the one he's the
[58:39] way and so now with this Tabernacle
[58:42] there's there's three courts to it we
[58:45] have the outer Court I let me see if I
[58:47] get this going here we have the outer
[58:48] court right here this is this would be
[58:51] your flesh your body see all of this
[58:55] here is all part of that there's an
[58:56] altar there right then we have here the
[59:01] the the inner court or the holy place
[59:03] and I'll show a cross-section in a
[59:05] minute that's your spirit here you have
[59:08] five pillars right we have five inlets
[59:12] of the spirit conscience memory reason
[59:15] affection all of those are there and
[59:18] then in the holiest of holies back here
[59:21] that's the soul so we have Body Spirit
[59:24] soul
[59:26] now God's desire remember it was his
[59:29] life that light that came down and
[59:32] actually gave the full direction for
[59:34] this it was his light coming down the
[59:36] shikina light that came down and settled
[59:39] upon the mercy seat and that's what the
[59:43] holy spirit is in the new birth to a
[59:46] Believer it's not a light like what can
[59:50] be in the Holy place where it can be
[59:54] blown out
[59:57] let me just show this here see this is
[1:00:00] now looking down upon that if this is
[1:00:02] okay everybody okay with this okay so
[1:00:05] once again here's that outer Court we're
[1:00:07] looking down on it now this is the first
[1:00:09] altar altar of incense and then the the
[1:00:11] mercc in here was the seven golden
[1:00:14] candlesticks those are opening to show
[1:00:16] the way but remember this in here could
[1:00:19] be blown
[1:00:20] out and would have to be relit there's
[1:00:23] times your spirit and my spirit
[1:00:27] where it's been blown
[1:00:29] out but what's important is is to have
[1:00:32] God's light the shikina light because it
[1:00:36] can never be blown out once once once
[1:00:39] God has sealed a man he's
[1:00:41] sealed right it can be things in here
[1:00:44] that we can permit sometimes sometimes
[1:00:46] through pressures of life or
[1:00:48] circumstances of Life grief or whatever
[1:00:51] can be so overwhelming but yet the same
[1:00:54] God who is here to like this is the same
[1:00:57] God that gives you and I the strength
[1:01:00] and the direction from where this was
[1:01:02] lit it's lit from this same fire that
[1:01:05] comes down from God you know man didn't
[1:01:07] Kindle that fire on out there in the
[1:01:09] Brazen altar God's brought that fire
[1:01:12] down and then from that fire it was
[1:01:15] transferred in here it was showing the
[1:01:17] same fire that came down in Jesus Christ
[1:01:21] is the same fire that was poured out on
[1:01:23] the day of Pentecost amen if that spirit
[1:01:26] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:01:28] dwell in you it shall also Quicken your
[1:01:30] mortal body The Works that I do shall
[1:01:33] you do also so it's the same fire now
[1:01:36] this is where that the Holy Spirit
[1:01:38] calling to us that even when there's
[1:01:41] times of things that's come here very
[1:01:44] deep or very great or weariness like we
[1:01:46] looked at last week and all of those
[1:01:48] things but there's still the fire of God
[1:01:51] that can move down and this can be relit
[1:01:54] Hallelujah
[1:01:56] remember David never lost his salvation
[1:02:00] right he lost the joy of
[1:02:02] it is that right he said restore to me
[1:02:06] the joy of thy salvation amen right so
[1:02:12] now we're seeing that of how that even
[1:02:15] in that now this might be a little
[1:02:17] blurry but I want you just to focus on
[1:02:19] this it comes down to this point here
[1:02:22] that this is exactly here we are and
[1:02:25] here he we have the body the outer we
[1:02:27] have the spirit that's tied tied to the
[1:02:30] mind and then you have the soul all of
[1:02:32] these things are true the body five
[1:02:35] senses see hear taste feel smell
[1:02:39] sometimes those things through those
[1:02:41] five senses on the natural uh you know
[1:02:44] you can maybe smell something or hear
[1:02:46] something and then we take it in and we
[1:02:48] draw a conclusion right and you've drawn
[1:02:50] a conclusion maybe of what your wife has
[1:02:52] cooked for dinner and you get in there
[1:02:53] and realize that's not the con
[1:02:55] conclusion that I had drawn you got a
[1:02:58] choice you get an attitude I mean or be
[1:03:00] disappointed about it and say hey can we
[1:03:02] change the menu but it's you or I that's
[1:03:04] drawn that
[1:03:06] conclusion right we got to be careful
[1:03:09] how we use those
[1:03:10] senses same thing in here then see that
[1:03:13] where did that come from well things we
[1:03:14] were smelling and we were seeing and so
[1:03:16] forth then we can come into the spirit
[1:03:19] and this in the spirit realm which is
[1:03:21] attached there to the mind that's
[1:03:23] imagination conscience affection
[1:03:26] reasoning memory so many deep things
[1:03:29] within this right here because how even
[1:03:32] God comes down into the Soul by his
[1:03:34] spirit and and brings a complete change
[1:03:37] to our nature and then from here
[1:03:40] remember brother brah says go down to
[1:03:42] the inside and get the inside cleared
[1:03:46] out remember how brother Bram says that
[1:03:47] in greatest B fought over and over he'll
[1:03:50] speak of that because then when we're
[1:03:52] coming from the inside out that's who we
[1:03:54] really are that's the one who's been put
[1:03:57] in charge that's a Son of God that's
[1:03:59] come under the authority that God
[1:04:02] intended for him to have then we can
[1:04:05] begin to approach out here in the spirit
[1:04:07] cuz sometimes even out in the spirit
[1:04:10] even here let's say in the conscience
[1:04:12] sometimes we've had the wrong thinking
[1:04:14] about
[1:04:16] things we've had scriptures we've had
[1:04:19] quotes and we've had it in such a way as
[1:04:22] conscience it's formed it over and we've
[1:04:23] had it in such a way that if we don't do
[1:04:25] do this oh Lord I'm not I'm not
[1:04:28] Victorious Lord I'm I'm not and you know
[1:04:30] what it had nothing to do with Satan
[1:04:32] defeating us it's because there's
[1:04:34] something that's there in our conscience
[1:04:35] but you know what you or I would not
[1:04:37] even know where to go or how do I go
[1:04:39] within this because your conscience is
[1:04:41] shaped by the teaching you're
[1:04:44] under and so God will come down and by
[1:04:47] his word you see God doesn't say stop
[1:04:50] thinking that but God comes down by his
[1:04:52] word listen to me everything he does is
[1:04:56] by his word Am So What comes forth is
[1:04:59] the product of himself that he's seeing
[1:05:03] our his through every facet of our life
[1:05:08] this is why that when you go back here
[1:05:10] and you look even in the Tabernacle
[1:05:12] every one of these colors there is even
[1:05:15] in the veil back here it's the same
[1:05:18] colors as where is right here in the
[1:05:20] hanging and what's on the gate the same
[1:05:23] color so it shows it becomes CR
[1:05:26] through every facet of our life that's
[1:05:30] what God's desire is to do is and from
[1:05:32] our soul it comes out into our spirit
[1:05:35] and then into our
[1:05:37] flesh I'll tell you when he got a hold
[1:05:40] of me maybe I can't speak for anybody
[1:05:42] else he had his work cut out for
[1:05:44] him but you know what he didn't look at
[1:05:47] all that he only he had confidence in in
[1:05:50] his word he had confidence in that part
[1:05:53] of himself that who you and I really are
[1:05:56] that that would continue to submit and
[1:05:59] to yield because the new birth does not
[1:06:02] bring us automatically into the
[1:06:05] conformed image of Christ the new birth
[1:06:08] brings us to the place to where now we
[1:06:10] have received his life in US it has
[1:06:13] birthed us into the kingdom now we
[1:06:15] become as children that are conformed to
[1:06:19] His Image
[1:06:21] amen transformed
[1:06:25] amen you love
[1:06:29] him so let me just refer to I'll leave
[1:06:32] this up there is that all right I'm just
[1:06:34] going to refer to the places here of the
[1:06:36] message of the Messiah remember BR said
[1:06:38] when that light has come in there it's
[1:06:41] about the size of a button and he says
[1:06:43] and you know the only way he said that
[1:06:45] God can get in there he says now watch
[1:06:48] this God will not even push your on you
[1:06:51] or
[1:06:52] I ain't that
[1:06:54] tremendous he RS you and I right he
[1:06:57] don't he don't God God let me just tell
[1:06:59] you something God has never been about
[1:07:01] the business of trying to scare you or I
[1:07:04] the only thing that becomes fearful is
[1:07:06] we is if when thing when we recognize or
[1:07:08] could see in our life hey I'm not where
[1:07:10] I need to be with God but God never even
[1:07:14] brings that to scare us into him it just
[1:07:17] becomes the alert of where is my soul is
[1:07:20] it in him or
[1:07:23] outside right right we know how that we
[1:07:26] need the Holy Spirit just standing there
[1:07:28] always at the door of Mercy brother BR
[1:07:30] says when God comes into the man into
[1:07:32] the heart he said when a man is
[1:07:34] converted it's just like a little white
[1:07:36] button that starts in his heart now
[1:07:40] watch this if he can let that Spirit
[1:07:42] grow and take out all the roots of
[1:07:45] bitterness and press God's way through
[1:07:49] him again he can come back in the same
[1:07:52] condition that he was when he was in the
[1:07:54] Garden of Eden and he refers to mark
[1:07:57] 11:24 if you say to this mountain be
[1:08:00] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:08:02] believe what you have said will come to
[1:08:03] pass you can have what you've said that
[1:08:06] puts man right back Supreme again it
[1:08:10] puts him right back in the condition why
[1:08:13] because your words have have become
[1:08:17] God's words God's words have become your
[1:08:20] words because as God as our life is
[1:08:23] yielded it dismantles all all of the
[1:08:25] roots of
[1:08:27] bitterness now friends I think we're
[1:08:29] here to be honest tonight as we come to
[1:08:32] the presence of God we we are looking to
[1:08:35] the Lord that God in every facet of my
[1:08:38] life I want to please you that's the
[1:08:40] desire that we have I want the Holy
[1:08:43] Spirit to search me
[1:08:45] out I want to be I want to be searched
[1:08:47] out right now and you know even within
[1:08:50] that we you know always want to be
[1:08:52] careful and I just kind of put this as a
[1:08:54] footnote because in with all of us we
[1:08:56] want to open ourselves to that place to
[1:08:58] say Lord search me out and you know
[1:09:00] sometimes the enemy can get on that and
[1:09:02] almost drag people clar out here and
[1:09:04] into where they's looking at where
[1:09:05] they're doubting their own experience or
[1:09:07] not but just need to open to the Lord
[1:09:09] and say Lord I close my mind to my
[1:09:12] thoughts I'm open to your thoughts
[1:09:15] because it's your thoughts the word is
[1:09:17] what has life in it and so if your if
[1:09:20] your word comes and my thoughts are
[1:09:22] wrong I lay aside my thoughts if your
[1:09:25] word comes and my thoughts are correct
[1:09:27] then I take it because it's your word
[1:09:30] but outside of that it's your word we
[1:09:32] are setting at the Judgment seat where
[1:09:34] the word of God is going forth to bring
[1:09:37] judgment in our lives I want judgment
[1:09:40] right now I want judgment in my heart
[1:09:42] right now I want Judgment of my thoughts
[1:09:45] and my intentions I want it right now I
[1:09:47] don't want to stand there on that day
[1:09:49] before the white Throne judgment and say
[1:09:51] I'm here because I neglected the
[1:09:53] Judgment of the word but I want to take
[1:09:56] the Judgment of the word where there is
[1:09:57] a blood that is speaking better
[1:10:01] things thank you
[1:10:04] Jesus Hallelujah I want to say God grow
[1:10:07] in me Lord root out all roots of
[1:10:11] bitterness and all the roots and things
[1:10:13] through my life that maybe I'm not even
[1:10:15] aware of of complexes that could be so
[1:10:18] deep that maybe from childhood or things
[1:10:21] that's been accumulated over the time
[1:10:23] you might say why didn't God take care
[1:10:25] of that first remember he heals from the
[1:10:27] inside
[1:10:29] out there's things he brings you an i to
[1:10:33] at certain times just like he gave the
[1:10:35] burden to them to return at that time
[1:10:38] under Cyrus then the burden came for
[1:10:40] Ezra to return then the burden came for
[1:10:43] Nehemiah God gives a burden Upon Our
[1:10:45] Hearts of when it's
[1:10:51] time Hallelujah now brother BR refers to
[1:10:53] this and he says we're made up of light
[1:10:59] meters we have that we tell we have
[1:11:02] x-rays you know those x-rays they
[1:11:04] capture light from our
[1:11:07] bodies and I know we have to you know
[1:11:11] anymore it's almost like they want to
[1:11:13] extract every bit from you in an x-ray
[1:11:16] in an
[1:11:17] x-ray um and they're only doing their
[1:11:20] you know what they think is right to do
[1:11:22] but it recognize it comes from our own
[1:11:24] light
[1:11:26] the prophet lays that out and he says
[1:11:29] then if that Cosmic light this Cosmic
[1:11:32] light in our bodies could be
[1:11:35] pushed to a place to where it's not
[1:11:38] Cosmic light but Eternal Light God could
[1:11:42] dwell supremely to do our thinking do
[1:11:45] our walking do our talking then it's no
[1:11:49] longer the man it's God and the man now
[1:11:52] I don't know about you there's times on
[1:11:55] those x-rays they can show things that
[1:11:57] are not a good
[1:12:00] report is that right there's times you
[1:12:03] could see things that says this is what
[1:12:06] it is the light meters put it off this
[1:12:09] is what's in the body maybe a growth
[1:12:11] maybe a broken bone something that's
[1:12:14] abnormal right and then afterwards they
[1:12:18] take an exray and it's gone how many
[1:12:21] have we seen healing of
[1:12:23] cancer now let me ask you what was it
[1:12:26] that stepped in and changed what the
[1:12:30] machine caught it was shakina light that
[1:12:33] came down and gave order to this Cosmic
[1:12:38] light a before and after picture let me
[1:12:42] ask you what is it that came into your
[1:12:45] life your life my life we were sometimes
[1:12:49] Darkness there was a before picture we
[1:12:52] were we were walking underneath the
[1:12:54] principality of air we could not get to
[1:12:56] a place of overcoming but then God's
[1:12:59] light
[1:13:00] came and when his light came it changes
[1:13:04] the story there's a before and an after
[1:13:08] well this is what I was but this is what
[1:13:10] I am and what I am was hidden there the
[1:13:13] whole time what made the difference
[1:13:16] Shina light came in God's light God's
[1:13:19] presence God's
[1:13:21] word let there be
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:27] hallah then it's God dwelling
[1:13:31] supremely I like how brother bam goes on
[1:13:33] to say it he says now he's got light
[1:13:36] eternal life is the light of God that
[1:13:38] dwells in the man this is key if he will
[1:13:42] yield to the spirit more he becomes the
[1:13:46] more he becomes unman Sinner likee and
[1:13:51] becomes more Godlike the more he can
[1:13:54] yield to the Spirit the more he becomes
[1:13:57] unman sinner like and more
[1:14:01] Godlike well what must I do yield
[1:14:04] because remember that light it'll press
[1:14:06] its way through as we yield to the
[1:14:09] spirit of God God drops a burden upon
[1:14:11] our heart and there's things to be
[1:14:13] attended to in our life like brother
[1:14:15] brand I thinking when he's standing on
[1:14:16] the platform in one of those quotes on
[1:14:18] the deep thinker he said sir he says
[1:14:20] you've you've been a deep thinker always
[1:14:23] planning things and Crossing Bridges
[1:14:25] just before you ever get to it he said
[1:14:27] that's this is what led you to the place
[1:14:29] he said where you're at right now he
[1:14:30] said now you've had people tell you just
[1:14:33] get beside yourself and stop thinking
[1:14:35] that way and and don't do that no more
[1:14:38] he said but this time it's
[1:14:41] different Hallelujah his time it's
[1:14:44] different he said because he's here and
[1:14:47] he's the one that is saying stop
[1:14:49] thinking that way and he said you're
[1:14:51] going off of here a well man
[1:14:56] you see what a difference Just In God's
[1:14:58] Presence you do you understand that's
[1:15:00] why Satan fights even when we're coming
[1:15:02] to the house of God and even when we get
[1:15:05] here the battle doesn't end when we get
[1:15:07] here Satan is battling because just a
[1:15:11] moment in his presence can change a
[1:15:14] situation it can change an Outlook what
[1:15:17] is it it's his light his presence his
[1:15:20] word coming
[1:15:22] forth Hallelujah oh God that's what I
[1:15:26] want to yield I want to yield Amen to
[1:15:28] his presence you were sometimes Darkness
[1:15:32] but now are you light in the world we
[1:15:34] just weren't in darkness we were
[1:15:36] Darkness right that's what we were we
[1:15:40] were Darkness void of light void of what
[1:15:45] God had intended for you and I to be but
[1:15:47] then he came and sought us out he knew
[1:15:50] what was over our life when the word
[1:15:52] spoke like it did in Genesis 1 do you
[1:15:55] know Genesis 1 is a story of redemption
[1:15:58] of our own life it's the word that came
[1:16:02] by and spoke to the atmospheres that was
[1:16:05] over our life a spirit of unbelief a
[1:16:08] spirit that wants to keep us in bondage
[1:16:10] but the word spoke and said let there be
[1:16:13] light it wasn't speaking to the Earth he
[1:16:15] was addressing the atmosphere and that's
[1:16:18] what the Holy Spirit comes to do for a
[1:16:21] soul that is Desiring to serve God the
[1:16:24] spirit of God will come down and the
[1:16:26] word will Cast Away that spirit that
[1:16:29] that man or that daughter can be saved
[1:16:33] oh my there's nothing as great as the
[1:16:35] power of the spoken
[1:16:38] word
[1:16:40] hallelujah oh my that we might prove
[1:16:44] what is that
[1:16:45] acceptable acceptable way of the
[1:16:49] lord I want you to look at this here I
[1:16:52] don't know if this one will
[1:16:55] yeah I really like this one same thing
[1:16:59] remember
[1:17:01] Body
[1:17:02] Spirit
[1:17:05] Soul these are all these
[1:17:08] influences I'm sure we can't maybe we
[1:17:11] can't relate to that contentions malice
[1:17:14] Pride lust Envy no notice trying trying
[1:17:18] to trying to move in Satan doesn't take
[1:17:22] his hands off and say
[1:17:26] Desiring to serve the Lord and God's
[1:17:28] done a work in their life no remember
[1:17:30] you wasn't in a battle before that's
[1:17:32] right you're in a battle
[1:17:34] now true but but the prophet said but
[1:17:38] remember you've got greater is he that's
[1:17:41] in you than he that's in the
[1:17:44] world Amen that's why the importance of
[1:17:48] it we'll get to this in a little bit
[1:17:49] it's always important to Live From the
[1:17:52] Inside Out don't live from the outside
[1:17:54] in
[1:17:56] Satan listen Satan makes suggestions
[1:17:58] from the outside in but God will always
[1:18:02] come with his word from the inside
[1:18:08] out the prophet said it just like this
[1:18:10] he said I want you to think of these
[1:18:12] things going around there Fame honor
[1:18:16] want trials
[1:18:19] stress sure
[1:18:22] we B says the devil and greatest B ever
[1:18:25] fought he'll try to come right back if
[1:18:27] he can get in there at all he's got your
[1:18:30] army routed right then you you know what
[1:18:32] it means for an army to be routed they
[1:18:35] are
[1:18:36] running in
[1:18:38] disarray that way that now they can just
[1:18:40] start picking them off singling them out
[1:18:42] picking them off here picking them off
[1:18:43] there picking them off there you know it
[1:18:46] was Joshua under the under the guidance
[1:18:49] of the Lord that came against uh uh the
[1:18:53] enemy in the land
[1:18:55] and remember that all of a sudden the
[1:18:57] sun started to go down and Joshua said
[1:19:00] Son you stand still why did he say that
[1:19:03] he didn't even take a thought did he
[1:19:05] have ability he was standing on the word
[1:19:08] and he knew what the word had called for
[1:19:10] him to do that when a battle starts
[1:19:12] don't you stop don't you let up one iota
[1:19:15] I don't care if it seems like darkness
[1:19:17] is coming in no matter what kind of
[1:19:19] pressure Comes Your Way speak to that
[1:19:23] storm
[1:19:25] son stand
[1:19:26] still Satan get back out of
[1:19:31] here and the Bible said they routed the
[1:19:34] enemy the enemy was just running in
[1:19:36] disarray there wasn't no order to them
[1:19:40] that's what Satan wants to try to do is
[1:19:42] break the order in our
[1:19:47] life that's why brother branam makes a
[1:19:49] simple statement he says all of your
[1:19:52] senses he said these right here see
[1:19:55] smell hear taste and
[1:19:56] feel he said don't believe them if
[1:20:00] they're not according to the word that's
[1:20:03] right well I heard so and so say this
[1:20:06] you might have heard so and so say that
[1:20:09] and they might have been exactly wrong
[1:20:11] but but your hearing right here it still
[1:20:14] doesn't line up with the word of God you
[1:20:15] say Lord I'm not going to allow that to
[1:20:17] enter into my spirit where I hold
[1:20:20] something against what somebody said or
[1:20:22] I heard them say I refuse to do I refuse
[1:20:25] to make one of the altars a place that
[1:20:29] other things are received outside of the
[1:20:32] blood is that right there's three altars
[1:20:35] the body the spirit and the
[1:20:37] Soul right and each the way all of them
[1:20:41] are to be let me go back here the way
[1:20:44] that they are remember are reconciled
[1:20:46] it's the
[1:20:47] atonement the atonement the one day of
[1:20:50] atonement that's speaking of the blood
[1:20:51] of Christ that blood was to unite here
[1:20:55] and come upon this Altar and here upon
[1:20:57] The Mercy Seat it brings it's an
[1:21:00] atonement at one M it brings a uniting
[1:21:07] together for one purpose now watch this
[1:21:10] is what I'm saying that when we look at
[1:21:12] this it always our altar we don't want
[1:21:15] to have anything on our altar but the
[1:21:17] blood of Jesus Christ you said brother
[1:21:20] Samuel what do you say if there's a
[1:21:21] thought against my brother against my
[1:21:23] sister anything that hinders me from
[1:21:26] looking at Christ in death I forsake
[1:21:28] that because it must be the blood of
[1:21:31] Christ upon the altar because the blood
[1:21:34] of Jesus Christ is all about the harmony
[1:21:38] with the
[1:21:39] word hallelujah even if it's about your
[1:21:42] boss even if it's because we're not
[1:21:43] we're not given in any privilege to say
[1:21:46] anything is acceptable to be Holden in
[1:21:50] any situation is that
[1:21:53] right no notice this if your if your
[1:21:57] affection doesn't agree with the word
[1:21:59] get rid of it you blow a flu right
[1:22:03] quick you know it's like somebody going
[1:22:05] into the house and thinking man this got
[1:22:07] a nice wood burning stove got a nice one
[1:22:10] man you better check make sure that
[1:22:12] chimney is
[1:22:14] open better make sure it's been cleaned
[1:22:16] out cuz if not this Smoke's coming back
[1:22:19] down at you in the
[1:22:21] house right it it ain't going to work
[1:22:23] you got to make sure it's cleaned out
[1:22:24] out and that's the thing that the word
[1:22:27] of God does it comes to clean us out it
[1:22:30] comes to clean us out it comes to purge
[1:22:33] us there's nothing that can Purge like
[1:22:36] the word of God going forth in its
[1:22:38] Purity it is the washing of Water by the
[1:22:42] word he says we must he said or else
[1:22:45] you'll blow a flu right quick anything
[1:22:47] disagrees with the word get away from it
[1:22:48] anything with what's on the inside get
[1:22:52] rid of it oh I then brother BR said what
[1:22:56] do you got you got a solar system you
[1:22:58] got everything is cleaned out well what
[1:23:00] does a solar system all those Stars
[1:23:01] every Star has a
[1:23:03] name I I don't know all of them but God
[1:23:06] does right I I mean I can try to find
[1:23:08] constellations I I'm pretty good on the
[1:23:10] Big Dipper Little Dipper and outside of
[1:23:12] that I'm just taking your word for it I
[1:23:14] I can't I I've just never been that good
[1:23:16] at seeing them sometimes that phone app
[1:23:17] that we've had been very nice where you
[1:23:19] can hold it up there and see that but
[1:23:20] you know job spoke of those
[1:23:22] constellations
[1:23:24] Micah spoke of those constellations is
[1:23:26] that right because God wrote his first
[1:23:28] Bible in the heavens right even God
[1:23:31] testified of the seven Church ages and
[1:23:32] all those things that are there but
[1:23:34] notice so God desires that a solar
[1:23:37] system everything would stand with the
[1:23:40] real clearness within it that everything
[1:23:43] is expressing his
[1:23:45] handiwork that's God's desire even to we
[1:23:48] he says the devil can't poke a doubt in
[1:23:50] there nowhere he can come around and say
[1:23:53] you don't feel any better but your
[1:23:55] conscience has even gone to that the flu
[1:23:57] is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the
[1:24:00] outlet blows a whistle glory to God it
[1:24:02] shines out just as clean and clear for
[1:24:05] the word of God to work through the
[1:24:07] power of God that's the main
[1:24:11] thing and Satan knows that as
[1:24:15] well remember he came and he worked in
[1:24:18] the beginning and begin to work through
[1:24:22] what Eve was seeing here
[1:24:25] and it entered there into her mind he
[1:24:30] dismantled that gate of reasoning which
[1:24:32] is a gate of judgment he dismantled that
[1:24:34] to say yay has God really said he's he's
[1:24:38] diminishing the word through
[1:24:41] reasoning see anything that diminishes
[1:24:43] the
[1:24:44] word that's not
[1:24:47] God God's word is always it's exalted
[1:24:50] and when it's exalted it exalts you with
[1:24:52] it because you're part of the word right
[1:24:54] it exalts the word of God in your life
[1:24:56] it exalt your life is surrendering to it
[1:24:58] it's being exalted but you see then he
[1:25:00] came in from reasoning and then it went
[1:25:02] over to imagination and all this began
[1:25:04] to go in her mind and all of those
[1:25:06] things and then the fall came all
[1:25:09] because one let down and let that come
[1:25:12] back in I I tell you we've got we have a
[1:25:15] responsibility before us can you say
[1:25:17] Amen oh God we've got a responsibility
[1:25:19] listen friends mind battles you're never
[1:25:21] going to get away from mind battles you
[1:25:22] you have them but I want you to remember
[1:25:24] remember you're not at Oddball for
[1:25:25] having mind
[1:25:26] battles right there's provision that's
[1:25:28] been made you you just got to come back
[1:25:30] down and know the ground of where you're
[1:25:32] standing and you stand there right
[1:25:33] against the enemy and and stand there at
[1:25:36] all times and and making sure Lord let
[1:25:38] everything be cleared out and and
[1:25:40] cleaned out in my life Lord everything
[1:25:42] don't don't hold anything you see
[1:25:44] because if you hold something it can
[1:25:46] become a Haven remember the Bible said
[1:25:48] pulling down strongholds it said give no
[1:25:51] place to the devil strongholds is a
[1:25:54] place where there's a stronghold not in
[1:25:56] the soul in the spirit no place to the
[1:25:59] devil in the book of Ephesians that
[1:26:01] place means a retreat a castle a a
[1:26:04] powerful place where Satan can act from
[1:26:06] don't give him any of those places it's
[1:26:10] like you know how it is and you know you
[1:26:12] tell your kids and things in the house
[1:26:14] hey hey hey hey I mean it's like what we
[1:26:16] have we have the dog food out in the
[1:26:17] garage hey hey man I I you know if I
[1:26:19] walk out there and I find a piece of dog
[1:26:21] I don't want that they got to you got to
[1:26:23] be careful what you're doing why because
[1:26:25] I don't want other things in this house
[1:26:29] right right I don't want other things in
[1:26:31] this house we've already had to you know
[1:26:34] you have to deal with something like
[1:26:35] that that comes in the in the garage of
[1:26:37] mouse or what I don't want nothing that
[1:26:38] close to my house so what it is I'm
[1:26:41] leave I'm not going to leave things down
[1:26:43] that would attract it and that's the
[1:26:45] same thing in our lives is Lord you may
[1:26:48] not know I may not see it may not even
[1:26:50] be known to us right now but Lord if
[1:26:53] there's anything in me that's an
[1:26:54] attracted for the wrong thing that's
[1:26:57] causing things to get hung up Lord show
[1:26:59] it to me Lord that my life all of that
[1:27:02] can be so cleaned out to where the enemy
[1:27:05] doesn't have anything that's a hold that
[1:27:07] he can start building
[1:27:12] on this is where the scripture
[1:27:14] says in Genesis 6 and I want you to go
[1:27:18] look at this scripture here with me just
[1:27:20] a minute this is God looking upon man
[1:27:23] when
[1:27:24] the time of Noah and this time of
[1:27:26] Destruction was
[1:27:28] coming and God saw that the wickedness
[1:27:30] of man was very great in the earth and
[1:27:33] that every
[1:27:35] imagination of the thoughts of his
[1:27:38] Hearts was only evil continually and I
[1:27:41] want you to notice that imagination of
[1:27:45] the
[1:27:46] thoughts the thoughts had come in but
[1:27:49] imagination is where
[1:27:52] framework begins to
[1:27:54] put those thoughts
[1:27:57] together this is and begins to just move
[1:28:00] into a place where it's not just a
[1:28:01] thought but then the Mind begins to go
[1:28:04] and frame these purposes
[1:28:07] together think of
[1:28:10] this before the foundation of the
[1:28:13] world the lamb was slain in the mind of
[1:28:17] God Amen in job 42 job was taken
[1:28:22] back and and and when looking at his
[1:28:25] circumstance he says where were you when
[1:28:28] I laid the foundations of this when the
[1:28:32] morning Stars shouted for Joy right
[1:28:36] where were
[1:28:37] you see it takes him back it was in
[1:28:40] God's mind but listen God in his mind it
[1:28:43] wasn't God's imagination but it was
[1:28:45] God's word it was faith and see this is
[1:28:49] where that Satan would like to try to
[1:28:51] trap in the imagination and God works by
[1:28:57] faith faith creates a vision that is
[1:29:00] contrary to even what imagination or
[1:29:03] reasoning or conscience or anything else
[1:29:05] could say but Faith makes way Faith
[1:29:08] itself is more
[1:29:10] real because an imagination is not
[1:29:15] real there's a difference
[1:29:19] amen right there's a big difference so
[1:29:22] now this imagination this word
[1:29:24] imagination means a framing of a purpose
[1:29:27] or a
[1:29:28] framework it's an imagination it's a a
[1:29:31] devising so it's it's putting and
[1:29:33] Gathering these thoughts together and
[1:29:35] putting them together and this is why
[1:29:37] when brother Bram is talking about those
[1:29:39] altars within within man and within the
[1:29:43] courts you have those altars and he says
[1:29:46] in this in this here in the Holy place
[1:29:49] he said think about in your life with
[1:29:51] those memories conscience uh and and
[1:29:54] reasons and and Imagination let me just
[1:29:56] stop here for a
[1:29:59] moment uh give me back to this to my
[1:30:01] slide please
[1:30:05] so so when you look at this here how
[1:30:09] many of you have good memories of loved
[1:30:12] ones it's in the gate of memory God has
[1:30:15] that in the
[1:30:17] vault but there can also be other
[1:30:19] memories in
[1:30:21] there right there can be memories in
[1:30:24] there that you see this is why
[1:30:26] everything not only we want everything
[1:30:28] under the blood but there's also things
[1:30:29] that we can have remembrances of of this
[1:30:32] or of that and and this one said this or
[1:30:35] this and then we can hold
[1:30:36] that and it becomes a
[1:30:39] hindrance it becomes a hindrance not not
[1:30:42] to the other person to what God wants to
[1:30:45] do in our
[1:30:47] lives you see listen God the blood of
[1:30:50] Jesus Christ will not do away with the
[1:30:52] memory but it'll take the sting out of
[1:30:55] it it'll take the effect out of it from
[1:30:58] controlling Our Lives to where one time
[1:31:02] you might not be able to look at this
[1:31:03] person but when the blood has come in
[1:31:06] there when the blood has been invited in
[1:31:08] there we no longer look at an individual
[1:31:11] or person with disdain but we recognize
[1:31:14] that we are all standing on the same
[1:31:16] plane in need of God's grace and we're
[1:31:19] not standing there in our memory and you
[1:31:23] know how Satan would like to bring
[1:31:24] things
[1:31:25] up things can
[1:31:28] Flash just in a moment's
[1:31:31] notice
[1:31:33] am right this is why we need the help of
[1:31:38] the Lord in our lives B says you just
[1:31:41] don't sit down and imagine these things
[1:31:43] what are you doing he said you don't do
[1:31:44] it in your flesh your senses don't
[1:31:46] imagine it's an inner court inside of
[1:31:49] you that begins to imagine
[1:31:57] so
[1:31:58] God God gave us those five Earthly
[1:32:00] senses as we said to contact see smell
[1:32:04] see smell hear those that's the contact
[1:32:06] this home right and then those spiritual
[1:32:11] senses they they have their part in an
[1:32:14] aid in our life but but never are any of
[1:32:17] these senses ever given to be the
[1:32:20] Principal guiding Factor amen
[1:32:24] sometimes we've heard something I'm just
[1:32:27] you giv examples you could hear
[1:32:28] something man think we got it all put
[1:32:31] together and you go run and say I heard
[1:32:33] this and this and
[1:32:36] this and what you heard was not this and
[1:32:40] this and this what we heard was what as
[1:32:43] we
[1:32:44] perceived and then it was put together
[1:32:47] by our
[1:32:51] imagination see this is oh oh Lord how
[1:32:54] this is how we always need we need his
[1:32:56] leadership you know there's so many
[1:32:59] directions and instructions of you know
[1:33:02] like the Bible says be swift to hear
[1:33:05] slow to speak is that right it speaks to
[1:33:10] us in these ways those are not just well
[1:33:12] those are Elementary things those are
[1:33:14] Sunday school things no those are things
[1:33:15] that pertain to us as children of God
[1:33:18] that that Christ might there might be an
[1:33:21] advancement in our life not of us but of
[1:33:24] him so this is where you know before
[1:33:27] anything I this is where we need to take
[1:33:29] it I I think of how brother Trevor said
[1:33:31] that when he was here a few years ago
[1:33:33] and he preached that wonderful message
[1:33:35] you know on and prayer and God's desire
[1:33:38] for communion I love what he said there
[1:33:39] on that midweek service he says if Eve
[1:33:42] would have just stopped when everything
[1:33:44] you're the reasoning sounds okay sounds
[1:33:48] like it might be all right even it
[1:33:50] within my imagination of my you know how
[1:33:53] wonderful would be but but but
[1:33:56] but let's talk to my
[1:34:00] husband let's talk to him wait till he
[1:34:03] gets home and let's see what he has to
[1:34:05] say about
[1:34:07] it if he would have just waited till
[1:34:10] then there wouldn't have been no fall
[1:34:12] right Hallelujah this is where you and I
[1:34:15] fail many times is because we don't
[1:34:18] bring it to the Lord in prayer we can go
[1:34:21] up on our reasonings go up our feelings
[1:34:24] and our imagin well I I just know it has
[1:34:26] to be this way and it's not God's
[1:34:28] leading that's why the prophet said many
[1:34:31] times he said we have Impressions
[1:34:34] instead of divine
[1:34:37] leadings and there's a big
[1:34:40] difference is that
[1:34:42] right so we know that this here these
[1:34:44] are things listen friends these are
[1:34:46] always things we want to we want to
[1:34:48] always in our life we never get too big
[1:34:50] that God let everything be examined by
[1:34:52] you Lord want everything in harmony with
[1:34:55] his word now I want you to think of this
[1:34:58] in this Spirit realm right here this
[1:35:02] Spirit realm right here this is a high
[1:35:05] maintenance area I mean this area you
[1:35:07] got to keep it
[1:35:08] fed you know please take a bath all
[1:35:13] those other things you know keep it
[1:35:15] dressed the right way but this this is a
[1:35:18] high maintenance area right the Bible
[1:35:21] said that the spirit of man is as a
[1:35:25] candle and a candle can be blown out it
[1:35:29] can get
[1:35:30] weary you see in this place right here
[1:35:32] let me go back here in this place right
[1:35:35] here this is where I'm talking about
[1:35:37] that Spirit you see right there the wind
[1:35:40] can come in this maintenance daily in
[1:35:44] the morning they had to trim the Wicks
[1:35:48] on that lamp otherwise it smokes up they
[1:35:52] had to also fill it with
[1:35:55] oil they also and not only within the
[1:35:58] feeling then on the Sabbath day the
[1:36:01] priest took the showbread they ate what
[1:36:04] had laid before the before God and then
[1:36:07] replaced it with showbread you know what
[1:36:10] all of this speaks of the showbread
[1:36:13] itself it speaks of when we look at
[1:36:15] these things that our lives would be
[1:36:18] unclouded the showbread itself is that
[1:36:21] our purpose is constantly for us and our
[1:36:24] lives are constantly given to a spirit
[1:36:28] of Revival Hallelujah that's why the
[1:36:31] prophet said stay in the spirit of
[1:36:34] Revival he said we must it's a constant
[1:36:38] refilling it's a refilling of the spirit
[1:36:40] of God but when there's a refilling it
[1:36:42] also brings a
[1:36:44] cleansing it brings healing in our
[1:36:46] spirit it's when we don't have a
[1:36:48] refilling is where we get brittle we get
[1:36:51] sticky we get contener we start leaning
[1:36:54] more into that rail that's a sign we
[1:36:57] need a fresh refilling oh God help us
[1:37:00] not to wait till those signs are there
[1:37:03] but every day Lord It's a time for a
[1:37:06] fresh refilling amen a time to give
[1:37:09] myself to the word the showbread is set
[1:37:12] before me it's that which is looking
[1:37:14] into the purpose that God has for my
[1:37:21] life let me finish with this quote here
[1:37:27] tonight questions and answers part four
[1:37:29] brother brandham has asked a
[1:37:31] question regarding Romans
[1:37:34] 7:
[1:37:36] 14-8 and he's asked the
[1:37:39] question help me to understand this we
[1:37:42] know that the law is spiritual but I am
[1:37:44] carnal sold under sin for that which I I
[1:37:48] would
[1:37:49] do I do not for what I would that I I
[1:37:52] would not but what I hate that I do if
[1:37:55] then I do that which I would not I
[1:37:57] consent to the law that it's good now
[1:37:59] then it is no more I that doeth it but
[1:38:01] sin that dwelleth in me brother BR said
[1:38:03] let me polish this up for you a little
[1:38:05] bit see that's what a prophet comes to
[1:38:07] do he's a Divine interpreter of the
[1:38:11] word let me polish it up for you in me
[1:38:16] is two persons one wants to do
[1:38:20] right and the other wants me to do wrong
[1:38:24] every time I start to do right wrong
[1:38:27] hinders me he says you are an outward
[1:38:30] man which is controlled by these uh
[1:38:34] senses you're an inward man controlled
[1:38:37] by one sense which is Faith and this
[1:38:40] Faith disagrees with all of these outer
[1:38:43] senses and these outer senses they if
[1:38:46] they don't agree with faith he says as
[1:38:49] long as those senses agree with faith
[1:38:52] wonderful but when those senses disagree
[1:38:55] with faith leave it
[1:38:58] alone you know what that is that's the
[1:39:01] bird and you and I have come under the
[1:39:03] atonement for our soul so the desire by
[1:39:07] the Holy Ghost is that everything would
[1:39:09] be in agreeance listen we're not even
[1:39:12] happy with ourselves and in our life if
[1:39:15] we allow other things to come
[1:39:17] in you allow a thought to come in
[1:39:19] against somebody else you're not happy
[1:39:21] your your peace has been removed
[1:39:24] it's there in your soul but something
[1:39:26] has come to disturb that but you and I
[1:39:28] are the ones who are in control of
[1:39:31] that what we allow to come in he that
[1:39:35] ruleth his spirit is greater than he
[1:39:37] that taketh it amen a
[1:39:46] city we don't even act the way that we
[1:39:49] should be AC we should be acting
[1:39:51] brotherly we should be acting sisterly
[1:39:54] even with the boss on our job that you
[1:39:57] might say he's so ungodly but he's a
[1:40:00] soul that's right he a soul that little
[1:40:03] woman who was uh uh that little
[1:40:06] Israelite daughter that was down there
[1:40:08] in non's house she had a
[1:40:10] testimony a testimony that when time
[1:40:12] came she could speak up and say I know
[1:40:14] where there's a prophet that can deal
[1:40:16] with this disease in your
[1:40:18] life she had a life a testimony that was
[1:40:22] lived that when time for God to utter
[1:40:25] through her it could be
[1:40:29] accepted you see our life the Bible said
[1:40:31] every gift make room for itself Our
[1:40:34] lives our testimony makes word for what
[1:40:37] comes
[1:40:42] here but you see if we don't we find
[1:40:45] ourselves when those things come we find
[1:40:48] ourselves
[1:40:49] avoiding dodging why is that why is that
[1:40:55] it's because something's
[1:40:57] registered in
[1:40:59] here and it's taken there's a Brokenness
[1:41:03] from the purpose that God has called us
[1:41:05] to do and if Satan can just get
[1:41:08] that he can just sit back and say I got
[1:41:11] it I got
[1:41:13] it you see everything it's truth all the
[1:41:16] way
[1:41:17] through I'm I'm I'm winding this down
[1:41:19] here let can I just finish this
[1:41:21] quote this is just some real instruction
[1:41:24] brother brah says these this is why we
[1:41:25] have all the troubles we have he said
[1:41:28] we're carnal and that part must perish
[1:41:31] but inside we're a spirit man that's a
[1:41:34] soul inside and that's faith in God's
[1:41:36] word I just want you to listen to this
[1:41:39] then we bring our outside body under
[1:41:43] subjection to the word by Faith by
[1:41:47] accepting what God Said see we bring it
[1:41:51] in subjection by faith then what does
[1:41:53] that look like brother Brandon what does
[1:41:55] that look like bringing my outside body
[1:41:58] in subjection by Faith by accepting what
[1:42:02] he
[1:42:03] said not trying to figure it out not
[1:42:06] trying to reason it out not trying to
[1:42:09] sort it out not passing it back through
[1:42:11] memory well I remember this and I not
[1:42:13] passing it through there but letting the
[1:42:15] word come down and clear it all out and
[1:42:18] accept what the word says by faith and
[1:42:22] it brings
[1:42:24] the body in
[1:42:30] subjection now let me display this
[1:42:34] everybody knows what this is
[1:42:37] right I'm still on the same quote I
[1:42:39] ain't finished the go yet I'm getting
[1:42:41] there I'm getting there everybody knows
[1:42:42] what these are right brother Aaron you
[1:42:44] know what these are don't
[1:42:46] you sometimes you got to pick these off
[1:42:48] for hunting clothes you've been in
[1:42:49] places sometimes you got to pick them
[1:42:51] off your dogs
[1:42:53] right burst and they hurt yes those
[1:42:56] things you just can't and a just like
[1:42:59] this right here you got to pick them off
[1:43:02] I prefer to have a glove so they don't
[1:43:03] stick in my
[1:43:05] fingers that's how bad they are but you
[1:43:08] know what this is this is our first
[1:43:12] nature
[1:43:14] sticky easy to get caught on things
[1:43:18] doesn't take hardly any effort it just
[1:43:19] gets stuck sometimes in our minds we can
[1:43:22] just get stuck
[1:43:24] sometimes in our spirit we could just
[1:43:25] get stuck on something you ever had mom
[1:43:28] or dad say hey hey hey you sound like a
[1:43:29] broken record you get stuck you get
[1:43:32] stuck on one thing we think Oh Glory to
[1:43:35] God I've forgiven I'm beyond that few
[1:43:38] days by all of a sudden the same event
[1:43:41] comes up years pass the same event comes
[1:43:44] up and it's told with the same
[1:43:49] feeling from when it originally happened
[1:43:54] see that's where I thank God that
[1:43:56] there's a there's a real place of
[1:43:59] forgiveness I thank God for that friends
[1:44:01] if not what kind of mess would I be in
[1:44:04] what kind of mess would you be in
[1:44:05] there's a place listen there's a place
[1:44:07] where no doctor can get to amen I'm not
[1:44:11] against I'm not against medicine I'm not
[1:44:13] against psychiatrist I'm not against
[1:44:14] psychologist but let me tell you
[1:44:16] something there's a place that they
[1:44:18] can't get to they can sit there have you
[1:44:20] lay on a couch and try to diagnose it
[1:44:23] but it'll never change you but there's a
[1:44:25] God that can not only reveal what the
[1:44:28] problem is but come down there with a
[1:44:31] cleansing
[1:44:32] power to separate and break the hold of
[1:44:36] that complex Upon Our Life That's The
[1:44:39] Mighty God that's the Lord Jesus that I
[1:44:41] introduce to you tonight Hallelujah
[1:44:44] because you can never pass through the
[1:44:46] blood of Jesus Christ and come out with
[1:44:47] a
[1:44:49] complex I'm glad he still frees and
[1:44:51] delivers aren't you I'm so glad of that
[1:44:55] we could just call brother brandom up if
[1:44:57] we could brother brandom are you
[1:44:58] thankful that God still delivers of
[1:45:00] complexes he could tell you just by
[1:45:03] listening to the services I'm grateful
[1:45:06] for God's grace that delivers from
[1:45:14] complexes BM said how can I take a cuab
[1:45:18] bur and make a grain of wheat out of it
[1:45:21] impossible
[1:45:24] but when the inside of that
[1:45:27] cucker that cuab been opened up been
[1:45:31] opened up and the Very life on the
[1:45:34] inside of it which is the Nature has
[1:45:36] been changed and replaced with wheat
[1:45:40] nature and then closed back up so what's
[1:45:44] on the inside of this cockabur you
[1:45:47] realize this cockoo right here it gets
[1:45:49] stuck on our clothes you know what
[1:45:50] that's for those prickers are to carry
[1:45:53] to other places so it can bloom so it
[1:45:55] just don't stay in one area of your life
[1:45:57] won't just stay in your life it'll go
[1:45:59] your family it could spread through the
[1:46:00] church it's meant to be a carrier but if
[1:46:04] the inside of that has been transmitted
[1:46:07] to wheat life when that dies it will not
[1:46:11] produce another cockabur it will come
[1:46:13] forth wheat because what is on the
[1:46:17] inside is what will come forth that's
[1:46:20] what the new birth does for you and I it
[1:46:23] takes away that Cucka nature on the
[1:46:26] inside and it's transmitted with wheat
[1:46:29] life and when this goes by the way of
[1:46:31] the Grave what's going to come up not a
[1:46:33] cucko bar but a
[1:46:36] [Applause]
[1:46:40] wheat brother BR said the life of that
[1:46:42] cuabo has been taken out but the nature
[1:46:45] of that cuabo is still sticky see on the
[1:46:47] outside it's it's still
[1:46:50] sticky I mean can even you know that
[1:46:52] stickiness could even make a
[1:46:55] question I wonder if he's really got
[1:46:57] wheat on the
[1:46:58] inside how do you why why do you think
[1:47:00] because it seems like he's kind of
[1:47:02] sticky seems like he gets stuck in
[1:47:04] certain things and and he feel remember
[1:47:06] God has all kinds in his
[1:47:10] kingdom right Prophet tells us things
[1:47:12] that ought to be he has some that are
[1:47:14] kind some that are fine some that are
[1:47:17] dogmatic some that are this he said but
[1:47:19] they're all in his kingdom
[1:47:23] right it just so happens we only like
[1:47:24] certain kinds of
[1:47:27] prickers
[1:47:29] right now I didn't say love I said like
[1:47:32] now watch this it will be until this new
[1:47:35] life has been fully developed out of the
[1:47:36] ground and raised up again that Cabell
[1:47:40] is still sticky it's got the nature on
[1:47:42] the inside of it of a wheat but as long
[1:47:44] as you're in this life you're going to
[1:47:46] be sticky and have a carnal nature
[1:47:49] that's going to bother you as long as
[1:47:50] you live might as well say it'll bother
[1:47:53] others
[1:47:54] too cuz I'm sure my carnal sticky part
[1:47:57] has bothered my wife I'm sure it's
[1:48:00] probably bothered my
[1:48:02] wife don't you say it's bothered you
[1:48:05] either I'm close to you right now
[1:48:08] buddy right sometimes we getting a
[1:48:10] little
[1:48:11] sticky he's almost got
[1:48:15] a but the inside of you you're born
[1:48:17] again when you raised up you'll be in
[1:48:20] the likeness of Christ and all sin will
[1:48:21] be gone from you
[1:48:23] brother Ram jumps to the very end of
[1:48:25] this quote all that's within that answer
[1:48:27] to Romans 7 of polishing it
[1:48:29] up a chief an Indian chief had received
[1:48:32] the Holy Ghost and he said to that Chief
[1:48:35] how you getting along he said pretty
[1:48:37] good and pretty
[1:48:39] bad what do you mean well since me
[1:48:41] received the Holy Ghost watch what he
[1:48:43] says there's been two dogs in me one of
[1:48:45] them is a black dog and one's a white
[1:48:48] dog they argue all the time isn't that
[1:48:51] amazing
[1:48:53] you by the holy spirit in your life you
[1:48:55] are in God's rest but there's an arguing
[1:48:59] going on not with God's word but there's
[1:49:01] an arguing between those two
[1:49:03] dogs right I don't know maybe they're
[1:49:06] Chihuahua I don't
[1:49:09] know one of them a a black dog and one
[1:49:11] of them a white dog they argue all the
[1:49:14] time they growl and fight at one another
[1:49:19] the white dog wants me to do good and
[1:49:20] the black dog wants me to do bad well
[1:49:22] Chief which one wins the fight that
[1:49:25] depends on which one Chief feeds the
[1:49:30] most right he says I that's a good
[1:49:33] answer that just depends on the Waring
[1:49:36] of the body that's in you it depends on
[1:49:38] which one you cater to which nature you
[1:49:41] cater to the carnal nature after the
[1:49:43] things of the world or the spiritual
[1:49:45] nature after the things of God that's
[1:49:49] what does it
[1:49:52] I say Lord if there's one thing for sure
[1:49:56] I want one of them dogs to be as big as
[1:49:58] a Rottweiler but I don't want the black
[1:49:59] one it might look funny to have a white
[1:50:02] Rottweiler but I'll take I I I want
[1:50:03] something that's big but you know what's
[1:50:06] going to make it big is what we feed
[1:50:09] it but I want that other one that black
[1:50:11] dog I want that to be so small notice
[1:50:13] it's not going to be something I get rid
[1:50:15] of but it's what I feed and you know
[1:50:20] sometimes the feeding
[1:50:23] of the black dog is actually neglecting
[1:50:26] the white dog right right and this is
[1:50:29] where our strength comes from I know
[1:50:33] these are things these are very simple
[1:50:36] things the Lord but it frames reality
[1:50:40] that we're not helpless we're not
[1:50:43] hopeless when there's things that we
[1:50:45] feel like man I feel like I've been
[1:50:47] blindsided I'm going to say Lord help me
[1:50:50] to understand the battle
[1:50:53] like David Lord teach My Hands to War
[1:50:59] show me Lord how I'm to fight this
[1:51:02] battle how do I move within this place
[1:51:05] in my life CU God has not called you and
[1:51:07] I into this place that we would stand
[1:51:10] helpless and
[1:51:12] defeated with Christ in your life you're
[1:51:16] more than a match for the
[1:51:19] enemy when he told Gideon Gideon saw
[1:51:21] only Gideon saw only the impossibilities
[1:51:25] of himself Gideon saw only what he knew
[1:51:28] about himself up to that point but what
[1:51:31] God saw in Gideon is what he always knew
[1:51:33] was there and it only would take a
[1:51:35] moment in his presence and through
[1:51:38] encouragements that Gideon would receive
[1:51:40] the courage from
[1:51:43] God and he said you'll Smite him as one
[1:51:47] man you and God are the majority doesn't
[1:51:51] matter what everything else though a
[1:51:53] host should en Camp round about me in
[1:51:55] this one thing will I be
[1:51:58] confident and I think that's the thing
[1:52:00] where we stand here in this place
[1:52:02] tonight Lord be the center of my
[1:52:06] life be the center of my
[1:52:10] life I think as the spirit of God just
[1:52:13] moving down just to free us and like
[1:52:15] brother BR says in one place he said the
[1:52:17] same God that brought you here in this
[1:52:22] building building he said receive the
[1:52:25] word and let it
[1:52:26] penetrate into your life and let it free
[1:52:30] you that's why we come to the house of
[1:52:33] God is that the word of God I want the
[1:52:35] word to penetrate I want it I want to
[1:52:38] absorb but I want it to soak down if
[1:52:40] there's if there's anything that's
[1:52:42] unlike him I'm depending on him to
[1:52:43] uncover that now and when he does I I
[1:52:46] want to stand like like like it was when
[1:52:48] Moses said who's on the Lord's Side let
[1:52:49] him come and Stand By Me amen amen then
[1:52:53] that's when I Rise and say I'll stand on
[1:52:55] the side of the
[1:52:56] word God give us that kind of a Grace
[1:52:59] that no matter what our feelings no
[1:53:00] matter what it is remember what God's
[1:53:02] really trying to do is separate
[1:53:05] us from our Own Worst
[1:53:08] Enemy which is our
[1:53:10] self oh what victory what Liberty there
[1:53:13] is can you say Amen to that when there's
[1:53:16] things when the Holy Spirit things have
[1:53:17] been cleared out in our life man I tell
[1:53:19] you just it's liberating with the spirit
[1:53:21] of God as he comes down and so
[1:53:23] refreshing in his presence as the word
[1:53:26] would come down into our life and it
[1:53:28] frees us it equips us it strengthens us
[1:53:32] and it does for us what no one else can
[1:53:36] do you love him amen God bless you
[1:53:39] tonight amen let's just
[1:53:49] stand Hallelujah I tell tonight even as
[1:53:53] we just stand in his presence and right
[1:53:55] before we go to prayer and maybe as they
[1:53:57] play something a little softly we can
[1:53:59] just say
[1:54:03] Lord let every part of my life be
[1:54:06] reconciled to your
[1:54:08] will you just say tonight maybe in your
[1:54:11] life tonight you say
[1:54:15] Lord I want your
[1:54:17] life on The Mercy Seat of my life I want
[1:54:20] your life I want the blood Lord what was
[1:54:24] there I want that Lord to be applied I
[1:54:26] want to surrender my all and Lord that
[1:54:30] everything is it one with you maybe
[1:54:33] you've experienced
[1:54:35] disappointment my we we've all been
[1:54:38] through things and I I wouldn't even try
[1:54:40] to measure what I've been through to
[1:54:42] somebody else we we can't I could look
[1:54:45] at what God's brought me through and
[1:54:48] look at what the Lord's brought you
[1:54:49] through and I could just say my M mine's
[1:54:51] in no comparison
[1:54:54] every time I hear brother brandham or
[1:54:55] hear Paul the things that they went
[1:54:57] through I think my what do I have to
[1:54:59] complain about but you know through it
[1:55:02] all there's times where my spirit's been
[1:55:06] blown out my spirit's B
[1:55:10] weak where just not my soul because you
[1:55:14] can't blow that shakina out when that
[1:55:15] Seal's been there is still a desire Lord
[1:55:18] my desire is to please you to serve you
[1:55:20] but just seems like maybe
[1:55:22] disappointments grief other things can
[1:55:25] come our way and yet through that the
[1:55:28] holy spirit will teach us he'll he'll
[1:55:30] help us and he'll minister to us and
[1:55:32] he'll bring healing in our lives of
[1:55:34] things that might be so deep that we
[1:55:37] don't even know how to even articulate
[1:55:39] or to bring before him but just say
[1:55:43] Lord I want your word to penetrate every
[1:55:47] area of my life Lord like you laid the
[1:55:50] burden on the children of Israel to come
[1:55:52] out of Babylon Ezra to return at his
[1:55:55] time then Nehemiah
[1:55:57] Lord I want to rest in the burden that
[1:56:00] the word is leading me to
[1:56:04] Lord heavenly father
[1:56:07] Hall you know Lord Jesus as we stand
[1:56:10] here
[1:56:11] tonight the needs and desires that we
[1:56:14] would have on our
[1:56:16] hearts Lord we
[1:56:18] certainly are so thankful Lord for the
[1:56:22] the
[1:56:23] Redemption that has been brought to us
[1:56:27] Lord we're thankful father for the blood
[1:56:30] that's made
[1:56:31] away for the spirit of God that Lord
[1:56:35] would move down begin to draw us Lord
[1:56:38] through every
[1:56:40] area and come to that place Lord of
[1:56:43] rest in our soul which brings us into
[1:56:48] rest Lord to realize that through it
[1:56:52] we desire Lord that you would
[1:56:55] just so push your
[1:56:58] way Lord towar that these Cosmic light
[1:57:04] meters it's pushed to the
[1:57:07] place to where it's used
[1:57:10] supremely Lord to where that as we start
[1:57:13] out in our walk with you well Lord we're
[1:57:18] children and there's some things Lord
[1:57:20] that we think as a child we understand
[1:57:23] as a child in some ways Lord it'd be
[1:57:27] good for us to recall back to that place
[1:57:30] of just taking you at your word but
[1:57:33] sometimes Lord through the complexities
[1:57:35] of
[1:57:36] life through trials through tests
[1:57:38] through things that we've come into lord
[1:57:41] it's never been you but Lord God the
[1:57:45] whereare that Lord in areas of our life
[1:57:48] to where
[1:57:49] that sometimes Lord maybe we find where
[1:57:52] things are getting hung
[1:57:54] up Lord Jesus your desire is that your
[1:57:58] word would be able to flow freely
[1:58:01] through our
[1:58:02] lives now
[1:58:05] Lord I'm not trusting the X-ray machine
[1:58:09] of a man that could only show the
[1:58:11] Natural Things
[1:58:13] Lord but I'm trusting Lord in that great
[1:58:16] spiritual
[1:58:18] MRI that Lord as we come under the word
[1:58:22] like your Prophet spoke of entering into
[1:58:24] that little room Lord as we come under
[1:58:27] that of the word oh God I want the word
[1:58:30] to examine my life
[1:58:32] Lord examine my life Lord if there's
[1:58:35] anything that's that's unlike you that's
[1:58:37] displeasing to you things that Lord
[1:58:42] that you know that am Desiring in my
[1:58:46] life my brothers and sisters standing
[1:58:49] here is Lord I we stand with that same
[1:58:52] desire Lord I I don't want channels and
[1:58:54] things Lord that to stay there I don't
[1:58:58] want things to stay in a memory of
[1:59:01] haunt or reasoning or
[1:59:06] imagination oh

[1:59:29] us there's no one Lord that can do for
[1:59:32] us what you can do
[1:59:35] Lord what I think of those examples of
[1:59:38] sister

[1:59:41] those different ones that I read about
[1:59:44] Lord known with that characteristic as a
[1:59:47] deep
[1:59:48] thinker and the things Lord that would
[1:59:51] so have an effect upon their
[1:59:55] lives but God you would come with
[1:59:58] healing virtue Lord to not only touch
[2:00:01] Lord those ulcer conditions not only to
[2:00:06] heal them Lord in their nerves
