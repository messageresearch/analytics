know when it comes like that whether that we have like this we just as we the brothers we try to look over it and try to evaluate the situations and things and you're aware of that we just ask that you some of you that live from for a distance and places like that just you that you would just make the decision that what you feel comfortable with there's i know there's different means to be able to determine what the roads are like and things like that so we just want to just we're thankful to be here and we're thankful to be in the presence of god amen there's some requests that also that we wanted to make known here that were printed out and we as we prepare to go into the word ask the lord's blessing on the word we just want to remember these requests it was one request as please pray for the families living in states you're experiencing power outages without having heat in their homes some areas do not have water so some of you may have relatives or different ones who are actually affected by some of those things and i seen a short clip today that was of texas and just kind of looking at that and you know this is the first this is the first that has hit texas like this and you know with the it's been a blackout you know brother bannon will pick that up in the message the rapture and he keeps referring back to that even in the message shalom you'll go into it and he speaks of it in the message the rapture he said all these blackouts that we're having he said it's a sign of the end you begin to go through some of them we don't always hear about but when i started just to study a little bit on blackouts some months ago and look at that you'll find at times that in california a lot of times it doesn't make its way to us but a lot of things in california they've suffered from these blackouts and different things but you know it's a sign it's a spiritual sign even though it comes in the natural but it's a sign of the blackness the darkness that's upon this world and what's upon this nation they wanted to invest in a lot of alternative forms of power are you with me that's that's really that that's a lot of the culprit they haven't taken care of a grid now just listen they haven't taken care of a grid and now they've got to go back and reevaluate because everything that has been said this will take care of it this will take care of it it's the same way with the church they didn't take care of the necessary grid it ties you back into into the realms of deity they by alternative forms of power but you see there's a real power it's the same power of acts 2 4 amen will be endued with power from on high amen it's still the same sending station it doesn't create a blackout it creates a light show you who were darkness now are you light in the lord amen praise god for his mercy his light our light has come amen the glory of god has risen upon us it's the same original power amen i don't mean to go off on that but i just just looking at a lot of those things but we want to pray for different ones because they're experiencing things that you know that i i can't imagine it either being without power you know and without water and those things also want to pray uh i've just waited to hear back from brother shane as well sister lily she got stranded down there in texas she had went to visit her family so i think brother sean is that still on she was supposed to land this evening okay so we just want to just to keep that in prayer i don't know exactly where that's out i want to do that as well i want to also keep brother ray hernandez in prayer as well with the whole process of his shoulder those three areas that are torn he really needs god to intervene on his behalf so we want to remember him in prayer there's a need for tomorrow that he moves into um also sister linda cavilla she requests prayer for a family salvation and a request also that she has in her heart so let's just stand if we could and we'll just ask the lord's blessing on the word as well as to take every one of these requests before god in prayer heavenly father lord as we come before you we are our just so so thankful the lord to have that reality that is so lord burn so deep in our hearts that you're our high priest the one who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities we just are so grateful lord as we would come lord to you in this moment lord there are needs of our different brothers and sisters lord i think of the different ones in these states more called different ones lord of humanity lord that even lord is suffering lord some of the lord even the clips today lord that i saw within that lord oh god i just pray lord for your mercy lord jesus dear god i ask for your mercy even for that storm lord that's to sweep a little below us lord in the state of ohio lord or actually into some of those lord more southern states out to the east coast god be merciful i pray lord lord we know it's nothing to you god to turn and redirect that lord what they're speaking about with the ice the lord that it would be relieved oh god i pray lord may you just intervene watch over sister lily oh god as she's on her way back home lord i pray we ask the lord as well for lord brother ray hernandez his need lord you know the special request o god and we just ask for your mercy lord for our brother lord this evening we pray god in remembering sister linda cavillo lord this request and i know that god the desire to see lord her children lord saved and filled with the holy ghost lord there's many that lord right here as well as our lord god on the on the the internet waves lord that's their desire as well lord is to see lord oh god our children lord just completely lord under the blood of jesus christ sealed in there lord by the holy spirit of promise lord we just send the holy spirit out lord that you will deal with their life oh god and begin to move upon their heart leading them lord to a place of complete surrendering you lord we ask that god for that special request as well as the need and the special request upon the hearts of your children tonight lord may you minister to that request lord minister to our needs tonight lord lord let me just be hidden behind the cross may you come lord and say what needs to be said tonight lord speak to us in a very a very personal way father lord we love you and we thank you lord we just ask your blessing on the remaining part of this service in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you let's turn to first corinthians 13 verse 4. thank you musicians i meant to say the other week i thought about it and i come out here and i a lot of times i'm just i'm one trap mind i it's not laying in front of me it doesn't get sad but um just thinking about it a couple of weeks ago was that brother bill sanchez leading songs here on on sunday and i thought when i heard him leading songs i said praise be to god amen because how the lord had had delivered our brother from that affliction even what he's dealt with in his in his lungs and sometimes some of the uh residual effects but we just think we thank the lord so much amen amen we thank god for that i just was so thankful i sat back there in the office and it was so good to hear brother bill's voice amen coming across again amen so first corinthians chapter 13 verse 4 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not and charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated amen like to welcome a visitor here tonight god bless you we want to look here at at the scriptures here just uh just a little bit more here this this evening and some of these parts within it you know it's always when we approach you know any part within god's word it it in reality when we follow the leading of the holy spirit you never come to an end you come to a part and then you can circle right back and circle and it keeps moving it because it's the same once it's tied into him he's the theme of the entire bible and so when we we look at this in the scripture and i want to just deal a little bit more tonight on this part of it that charity advanteth not itself and that it deals with where it's not boastful it's not vainglorious and we realize that that is it the working of charity is the love of god it's the holy spirit that what we have received by that of the new birth there's nothing that you and i can glory in that we've done but it's it's simply been the work of almighty god we we've had we have we've yielded to his working but even to yield to his working that's the grace of god as well and so when we we begin to look at it and to think that if we see this that in even in our lives he's the theme of everything about our life then there is nothing that we in ourselves can brag on in any way of what we have done or what we could do because even in the life of god once we have been born of the spirit of god john would write it in this way in first john 5 whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory even our faith so that once that a life has passed from death unto life then it comes into the place of an overcomer and it's overcoming a life that's working in you even when the lord jesus as they he was placed in the grave through his death and his burial but that quickening spirit that life it went on and it moved down and we know the what took place there the sins were deposited in health and then he he raised back up on that easter morning he spoiled principalities and all powers he loosed the seals of death what was a mystery to man and what held man as a fear the fear of death he broke the seal of that to begin to reveal and unfold to man what it was what with this life now what is that next life how how what comes after this and and who is it that will that can break that seal who is it that can make that known and on that easter morning then it was through his working that took a group of believers that was so saddened because of what they thought they saw the supernatural saw the reality but things did not turn out in the way that they thought they ought to but when he came to them he began to unfold the word that re that was pertaining to him scripture that had to be fulfilled and when he begin to reveal to them that place in the word and then it comes to that moment that now he reveals himself in that little that place with them where they invited him in their hearts the bible says did not our hearts burn while he spoke to us along the way they recognized him as the fulfillment of the word you see he just didn't want them to know that i'm the same jesus that walked with you he wanted them to know that what was against you the debt i have come to settle that debt i have fulfilled the scriptures of what was spoken of the shepherd of the redeemer of the savior of the deliverer he wanted to make sure that they could see that in the scripture this is what he was and see that's the same way that god works today his characteristics never change his natures never change he's the same god as the scripture said i'm god and i change not he's the same yesterday today and forever if he ever healed a man before he heals him tonight if he ever delivered before he delivers tonight if he ever saved before he saves tonight if he ever filled with the holy ghost he still feels with the holy ghost the word is what reveals him to be the same in power in glory and nature so within this when we when we can see this this reality that within the vaunting itself uh or the boasting or any uh how the word would be used of bragging there's nothing that in ourselves that we can brag on i want to just maybe cut in here in a in a scripture and to look how paul all through the gospel you find all through the gospel it is it is everywhere that the glory belongs to almighty god and it never ever should be you see this is where this is our desire is that he's the one who's glorified in our midst we don't want when people come to church or they remember uh this or they remember something else what we want them to remember is is that there was something here who knew me there's one here who's dealing with my life there's something here that's calling me that's greater than my ability to even comprehend there's one that's here it's god that's what we that's our desire hallelujah i really don't care if a person remembers if it was me speaking or somebody else that has that doesn't make any difference what matters is is our needs we have received our needs met in jesus christ that's what's important see paul would write of this of the god who is rich in mercy and he said it like this familiar scripture but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and have raised us up together made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now paul is speaking this here and declaring not only to those who have experienced this reality but he's letting know let it be known to everyone even a son or daughter of god that hasn't experienced that reality he's sounding a trumpet to them to let them know what you have need of has already been provided and god didn't even ask you amen he already provided it hallelujah that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus so through the word he makes known this reality to you and i through the anointed word he it expresses to you and i it calls upon us that redemption has come we are included in it and now it's for us to receive that redemption notice what paul says in verse 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith now we know there is a faith there there that even the seal of the holy ghost is god coming to seal our faith but how could you and i even have faith except god comes and would even stir our faith up the bible says how shall they how shall they know how shall they hear except one be sent to declare these glad tidings of peace and the glad tidings of peace are our god rage [Music] there's nothing greater there's nothing too hard our god rings notice and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god faith that is gifted to you and i it's grace it's grace it's god working the whole time and remember as we've been looking here on sundays it is the faith of god moving down to receive himself into the temple not made with hands so you and i cannot even take glory and say well i received him that's why brother graham said over and over in the earlier part of the message then he comes in future homes and he says i don't think he said you should say i received the holy ghost you should say the holy ghost received me because it's god's work notice and that not of yourselves it's the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast so when god does a it takes all boasting away from us you see the real work of charity of the love of god there's nothing that we can boast of ourselves for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so you see in reality we hear this over and over but it's true we weren't seeking for god he was seeking for us it's true you can say well i i had a longing but who put that longing there you didn't i didn't god put it there [Music] it's gone to begin to drop on it why is it that the things of the world could never satisfy because it it was god working in your life those things were never meant to satisfy you there's only one place of real satisfaction and that's in jesus christ thank god that we couldn't fit in anywhere else hallelujah well it might have hurt us a little bit why we couldn't fit in here or couldn't fit in there but god that was god's mercy to you and i his mercy to send a word to you and i when we were in need of the mercy of god we were without help and god's mercy comes and deals with our condition yeah he points out our sin the holy spirit comes and he brings conviction but he lets you and i know i am your answer i am the remedy to your problem i am what you have need of i am that bauman gilead i am your all-sufficient one i am your health shadow he reveals himself as the almighty god and the god that's got everything covered for your life hallelujah this is why when you look even at david when saul was rejected god speaks through samuel and says the lord to saul he hath rejected thee from being king over israel and hath given the kingdom unto thy neighbor hallelujah saul was still king but the kingdom is god's power that's the power of god god removed rent that was rent from saul for his disobedience in him exalting himself instead of operating in humility so now with david think of where david here is david here he is he's out there tending sheep you look out there i don't look like too much of the king that looks more like a peasant you know somebody just keep in shape but god sent samuel down there to jesse's house with that horn of oil this wasn't a vial saul got anointed with violence come on now but david got anointed with the horn hallelujah there was no looking back after this anointing the vows has eyes that cause the eyes to look back as though something's after you but when the horn has been that oil has been poured out there ain't nothing to look back to your past has been done away with glory be to god it isn't if it's gonna get me one day no sir it's already been done away with by the blood of jesus christ you're anointed by the horn of his strength looks at all the brethren that's there looks at jesse now remember samuel looked at different ones and he thought for sure by stature see god would allow these things to be shown to you and i because it's just a part about us sometimes we want to choose i don't care how spiritual we are there's a part about us that we can still be inclined to look at things like this would make a good fit but god was showing in that hour a type of the lord jesus the lord jesus the bible says there was no beauty that we should desire him he was despised and rejected of men is that right it would not have been a way that he came and god chose to come in that way you and i would not there would not have been well we'll choose to come this way we would have probably chose it to where there would have been no black mark there would have been nothing that anybody could have said but god chose it in that way to hide himself from the wise and prudent god chose it to reveal his glory and here's samuel himself he looks upon the outside and he's getting ready to anoint the different ones you know brother brahm tells us he said it's something about people that we will judge people by either what they wear what they drive or on and on and on and on but we realize we are not to judge people by that there could be somebody who can be ever so boisterous and somebody else who's not as boisterous it doesn't mean that the one who's more boisterous is more spiritual the one who's more boisterous might just have a bigger mouth the one who is actually more quiet might actually be the more spiritual one is that right so we recognize that that within these things it isn't about the things that sometimes that you and i would look at it's in god's choosing and what god looks at so david did not choose himself to be a king but it was god who chose him to be a king and in the presence of the brethren he was anointed king of israel now brother branham would say it like this and he relates it to you and i he said if you're a christian he said how many of you are here christians tonight he said you're not a christian by your desire you're a christian by god's desire oh glory hallelujah none you can't boast of this well it was my desire no no no that desire belonged to god it was god who put that desire within you that's where the longing was within your life it was god that would begin to move over your heart and begin to stir up the desire and longing that he put within you this is why as god elected you then from election he calls you and now once he calls you he anoints you with the holy spirit a promise you heed to the cause but even in heeding to the call we can't glory in that in ourselves we can say lord you gave me grace you helped me to overcome my own rebellious ways you helped me lord god you're the one who began to open it to me the way i would look at the word i looked at it as a law i looked at it as do's and don'ts but lord then you came and you began to deal with my heart and turn my heart around to her and i realized this is god's love and his care for my life it's god drawing me it's god speaking to my heart and see what's happening you're heeding the call and he who's you right into his presence to where you're surrendered and at that time he takes out the anointing oil and anoints you with the holy ghost and you're positionally placed and the only thing that you can say and i can say is to god be the glory it is god that has brought me safe this far it's god that'll take me the rest of the way home oh my you see how what a powerful thing the real experience of the holy ghost the new birth is in a life it's our resting it's our joy it's our delight it's the basis of all operations in our life it's the strength when we feel down we come back to that ground that's given to us that we are sons and daughters of god and we know that we have passed from death unto life brother with that revelation in our life the gates of hell cannot prevail against that glorious revelation hallelujah so we're not a christian by our own desire but it's god's desire oh glory now when we look at this look in first corinthians chapter one let's just skip to verse 26 paul would write for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty and not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise isn't it amazing god calls noah to build an ark you think god would have got an engineer right you think god would have had you know a team of engineers and myself and you know zach we were we were looking at this little thing where this guy was you know talking about you know and somebody was you know kind of debating him or whatever more and talking about the ark and the one man said well you know and no i know i might have had other guys that were engineers i said here's a man i said he's standing they're not going to move him from the word i said but because i said what they failed to understand is the supernatural element god did not call noah because noah was qualified god does not call the qualified he calls the unqualified and then those that he calls that's unqualified he qualifies them how does god qualify but they recognize they can do nothing without him when they recognize i can't do this lord i need you and god says that's exactly what i was looking for because the wise would try to figure it out noble would try to you know figure it out but god calls that which has is of that the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god had chosen the weak things of the world to confine the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things that are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence brother iran would pick this scripture up over and over and say thus he said even the very flesh of our lord jesus christ could not glory in the presence of god as he stood here on earth he said it is not me that doeth the works it is the father that doeth that dwelleth in me the son john 5 19 can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing constantly he was bragging on the father who was in him glory be to god but of him notice how paul brings us all of this but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption god has made him unto us he is our wisdom he is our redemption he is our sanctification he is the oil on the inside that when the world would want to try to encroach there is an oil a sanctifier on the inside by that inward desire that it washes away the very pools and holes of the world it washes it away he is our redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord oh glory be to god think of this how paul would write this in hebrews 11 34. he speaks of how that out of this of the great heroes of faith in hebrews 11 and this phrase i'm just going to take out of the scripture out of weakness were made strong amen brother brown would say it like this he said here's something to console us here's something to encourage us out of weakness and humility god chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of god with his church we'll stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothings that's achievement by the love of god that's god's achievement what to realize that i can do nothing without him that's god's achievement it's an achievement how god brings us into that place brother brown would go on to like it in his way he says isn't it a strange thing that god likens you and i to sheep rabbits can run you know different ones have certain attributes about them but a sheep is helpless a sheep is in need of a shepherd is that right and you see that brother ram says a sheep stands helpless that's the way god wants us realize that we're totally insufficient let me just do a pause right here that doesn't mean that doesn't mean walking around i ain't good for nothing i that ain't that ain't it right there you're hindering god you're not even resting and relaxing you you're just you're beating down on yourself you're joining in and the devil hey listen the devil tries to do that enough but to realize you're totally insufficient how is that it's to recognize i can't do this but lord i'll surrender it to you i surrender it to you the weakness there are weaknesses the weakness the need within our life when we go through tests when we go through trials when we go through things in our life the weakness notice god does all of that as paul said we are killed all the day long that the life might be made manifest in our mortal body look at the grace of god god knows that we're still strong he knows that there's things that must come our way to keep us beat down to keep us down i'm not talking about in a negative attitude i'm talking about god allows things to come our way to remind us i'm the one who's in control in your life i'm the one who's got this in control and he brings it around that we realize lord i need you in every step and every stage of my life that's god's grace given to you and i to keep us humble realize that we are totally insufficient then god takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person it's one thing for us to recognize our weaknesses but it's another thing to submit them to god to realize that with the weaknesses now we're talking we're not talking about sin here paul we're not talking about sin we're talking about weaknesses situations things that come about that that brings about the reality of our need like paul could say it like this paul would say here he is he said that the excellency may be of the power of god and not of us god hath placed this treasure in earthen vessels vessels that are fragile you know i don't like the i know they still sell them now but it ain't like a lot of the flower pots and things that they they used to have you know when i was growing up the only thing really that mom had everything was fragile it was it might be some ceramic or decorative thing but it was it was fragile if you dropped it the wrong way or set it down it broke it wasn't like the fiberglass and plastic god never intended you to be a fiberglass or plastic christian hallelujah the holy ghost does not come to you by the new birth and all of a sudden transform you to where you now become a fiberglass christian no you can still experience the weakness within your spirit and within your flesh but in your soul you've got the strength of almighty god you've got the same deity that stood back there in the beginning and said let there be it is such a marvel and a paradox that here you have that very portion of the power of deity of god and yet here you walk in the frailty of humanity where you can get down where you can experience sickness where you can experience different feelings and emotions but there is a power on the inside of us if we can just yield that weakness to god and say lord be glorified in this lord lead me through it lord receive the glory because through it it's how god will mold our character now notice how jeremiah will pick this up of what we are reading there in corinthians in jeremiah chapter 9 verse 23 thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me glory be to god that i am the lord oh my my my my my which exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth we are witnesses of god what god has done what he's doing right now in the earth we are witnesses of the loving kindness the mercy of god we are witnesses of the judgment of god we are witnesses of the righteousness of almighty god it's not that we glory in ourselves we glory in him for in these things i delight saith the lord now notice how paul would pick this up in galatians 6 14 god forbid that i should glory save him the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i'm to the world now you'll find paul over and over very much like david would in the psalms you'll find over and over where paul would even write in the scriptures and he would speak even to timothy regarding a faithful saying that is with with that is to be spoken again and again of how that god how he came down in christ to save sinners and paul said of whom i am the chiefest now paul didn't say that bragging on that man i was worse than all of you all no no no man i could do this and do that no no that's wrong kind of bragging you're not testifying on god you're testifying on what you used to do boy i could drink this or i could do that there ain't nothing about god in that that's you but when you can testify and say god took a life he took a life i think my brother bill said it i stood right there in honduras that day and dad my dad brother browning was standing there and we were he was waiting to preach that night we were waiting on the workers to come in from the fields and we sat there i don't know three four hours you know how it was church is supposed to start at this time didn't start can't postponing postponing postponement postponing and right there the spirit of the lord began to move and and brother browning he looked over and he looked at myself looked at brother heard and he looked at brother bill he said i want all three of you tonight i want you to get up and you all start and you testify of what god has delivered you from he said once once that's come i'll come behind it and i'll preach that night i'll never forget when brother bill stood up brother bill he was the third one in line before before brother browning stood there i never forget the lines that brother bill said brother bill said i knew a man once i knew a man once oh man he laid it out what kind of a vile man that was but he let it be known it was the grace and mercy of almighty god and when the word came behind that there was a little girl a little one about this tall here she was in prostitution nobody knew it god set her free [Applause] hallelujah it was a testimony the spirit of god picked that up in that community they were they were drinking and the things that were going on but god let it be known i'm your answer [Music] hallelujah this is where paul could go on he would write about that bragging and he would talk about this in romans and he would talk about how we joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement you know i referred to this one last week just in in closing or brother brown you know he got where this he kept on bringing this up where this one woman she came and she said you know very good tonight brother brandon she said but i got one problem with you he said what's that you break too much on jesus that's a sad thing that what who what the organization she belonged to didn't believe he was divine didn't believe in the real deity of jesus christ this was god's example of what sons and daughters of god were to be hallelujah he said the works that i do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do for i kill to my father he let it be known that what you have saw here is an innate initiation there's gonna be a continuation of this same lie you brag too much on jesus let me just read a few little places here brother brown says i couldn't brag on him too much no matter what i'd ever say i still can't brag enough on him i can't find the words to speak to exalt him high enough i can't find gifts anywhere to declare him he's beyond that if it wasn't for sake of time i'd play a little clip he's my king but i won't do it all that time notice brother ram goes on another place he says oh you can never say too much bragging about our lord jesus christ because he's worthy of all praise david picks it up in psalms 89 verse 15 blessed is the people that know the joyful sound do you know the joyful sound the sound that was declared you're free you're free you're free you can return back to your inheritance you can come back home it's a joyful sound laboring and slaving away but the sound goes forth it's a joyful sound it doesn't say wait another day wait another moment it says throw it down right now and start heading home they shall walk o lord in the light of thy countenance in thy presence in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favor our horn our strength shall be exalted for the lord is our defense and the holy one of israel is our king you know david went through a lot of tight places the songs are all experiences a lot of tests a lot of trials but in the midst of it david could find that god is present he's worthy of all praise don't you think about this when he faced off against goliath the spirit of the lord was upon him to where he did not hear it in the way that others heard it david heard it this guy is challenging god he's trying to tear down his excellency and david said i'm going to stand for god i'm going to stand up for god in this time i know what he is so i'm going to stand for him in this hour and the goliath was out there just boasting and boasting and boasting but that day i like how brother braham says it that day somebody came in the camp he made the wrong boast with the wrong person that day oh my there could be sickness there can be things that can come your way and a lot of other things and the enemy can try to boast he can try to stand there and say a lot of things but to a son and daughter of god there is a reality in your heart that burns that's greater than every boast of the enemy he might have afflicted your body but god said i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases by his stripes i am healed david looked around and said all right who's going to shut his mouth [Applause] i'm tired of hearing his mouth run david what are you talking about he's running down my king he's talking about my god david didn't look at himself that that that by statute of stature he could match up but what did he say he came rejoicing in the name of the lord rejoicing isn't always where you just say oh praise the lord jesus there is a rejoicing to that but there is a rejoicing in his name which is his character which is his word and you can rejoice like david rejoiced and david said you come to me in the name of science you come to me in the name of theology but i am coming to you in the name of the lord you see this is why we can never brag on him enough all right brother brown said i ain't got much more to talk about than just to brag on him he's my life he's my peace he's my joy he's my rest he's my comfort he's everything oh my god whatever your need is yes when they have need of water you let them know i'm your provider [Applause] hallelujah god takes situations and god will allow us to be led into situations and the enemy will say aha i got him but that's when god will reveal a characteristic of his name as he revealed it all the way down through the old testament and he revealed himself as jehovah jireh as jehovah rapha as jehovah shalom as jehovah nisi of jehovah's canoe he reveals himself in the midst of a crisis and a situation he remind reveals himself that i am god in this situation amen oh hallelujah oh my psalms 3 oh i love this here was david here he is lord how are they increased that trouble me now remember david's being run from the throne by absalom many are they that rise up against me he's been spit on in everything many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in god that's just like the devil ain't no help for you this was listen to me this was a man whom god had anointed and god had used this human instrumentality to take down the boastings of the enemy and yet the enemy would stand there and say there's no help for his soul in god but here's how he responded but thou o lord are a shield for me hallelujah i might have been run out of places that i reside come on now i might be removed from my comforts from where you know everything going on but thou o lord on my shield my glory and the lifter up of my head i tell you the only way for you and i even to be able to lift our head up and to have joy in the midst of this time it's because the lord is our shield the lord is our glory the lord is our strength hallelujah brother brown takes this example like this he talks about he says imagine he said if you were giving you know you had an invitation to go to the president's house the president and he said eisenhower sent an invitation for you to come to a wedding banquet of his son and he said now if that was so he said you'd brag about it he said you should it's a great honor of course nowadays it would be posting it i just want to post this to thank the lord how many followers you got 50. you got a hundred i post it on your site because i want to give i want to give thanks to the lord but in reality brother brown bring in the context of it you'd brag on it and he said you should that'd be an honor it would be an honor what would make it an honor who it is that's invited you because it hadn't been like publishers clearinghouse send you out a bunch of junk mail this was a direct invitation with your name on it there ain't no question of well let me see here i don't know if i invited you or not nope this invitation by the president for the sun's banquet it had your name on it there ain't no mistake they knew exactly where to deliver it to and brother brahms said how about it he said we've been called to the wedding supper of the lamb hallelujah he said now he said people say all the time those people that are filled with the holy ghost they brag too much he said we've got something to brag about we've got some southern term we've got something to crow about there is something that's real that's taken a hold of our life he's changed us he's opened our life he transformed our lives we have something to brag about and he said now if you looked at that invitation and you looked at him and said oh my goodness to go to the president's house how could i do that i don't even have clothes worthy enough to wear he said if the president and sent you that invitation then he will surely provide the garments that's needed for you to show up how much more has god provided for you and i the wedding garment the garment that is needed of the baptism of the holy ghost that you and i might come home and to be there for that wedding supper i'll tell you what it's something worthy really to brag about it's worth talking about it's worth testifying about amen it's worth talking about is that right and that's what brother brown says he says don't make any difference what your past life has been when you've got an invitation to come you're ready to come if you've been bad you've been a streetwalker been a gambler been a drunkard been a murderer no matter what you've been if god gives you the invitation knocking at your heart he will take care of the rest of it hallelujah oh my we could just move through different scriptures let me just go to psalm 62 here with this psalm 62 verse 5 verse 6 verse 5. my soul wait now only upon god for my expectation is from him these are the scriptures read from the message shalom he only is my rock sorry cnn sorry fox news sorry [Music] sorry doctor whoever he is my rock everything else is shifting sales come on somebody he is my rock he's my revelation that's personal he's my revelation in the midst of storms and tests he is my standard glory be to god he is on whom my life my experience is built upon he only he only now my bank account he only is my rock and my salvation this is the seed of abraham he is my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god brother branham would say oh he said i can't brag too much on my first birthday the ghoster talks about his ancestors that him doesn't mean that maybe there's not some good traits but the reality of it is that's all that it could be but there's a whole lot of bad that first birth you can't brag on it sometimes you can look at it boy i'm a i'm a good at this or i'm good at that i'm you're bragging on that first birth i'm good at this i'm good at that you can have talents and skills and things in your life but don't forget who gave them to you well brother samuel i went to school for this who gave you the ability to learn and to desire right you understand what i'm talking about i mean there's some things that i could no doubt i could do but after i got done you know somebody did it that didn't know what they're doing that's okay whether you say man or not it's the truth there's some things that yeah i can do and do it to kind of cut costs it takes me a little bit longer i mean i don't have all the skills for that and then there's others who've got those skills can look right at it and it's just like like butter and bread but there's not one of us can take glory in even the abilities and the skills that we have even our strengths become hindrances if they're not surrendered and submitted to god my that's why brother brahm said i can't brag on my first birth but i can brag on my second birth what he took me from what he brought me from you might look back down through your ancestors and not to look down on them but you realize if not for the grace of god simple if not for the grace of god where would i be where would i be if he hadn't come looking for me where would i be if he didn't start to pull on that desire that he placed within me where would i be if it didn't start to stir up a hunger and a thirst for right where would i be let me close on this scripture tonight and we'll just end here psalms 34. i will bless the lord you know the background of it it's a time where david's running again people are against him they're after his life so brother brian this isn't like something where david shows up to service that night man he's been on a mountaintop he's looking around said you valley dwellers get up here on the mountaintop with me no no most of david his psalms are wrote when david was also in the valley in test notice while david would write this i will bless the lord sometimes when times are good at all times at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul all of this shall make her boast in the lord notice how david places the soul her boast [Music] bride womb life my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together magnify let us render powerful praise let us surrender praise to his name we're living in the hour where he has revealed himself where redemptive claims the book in revelations 5 has been taken that book being unfolded the book of redemption worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive riches glory honor power worthy is the lamb the one who has made it possible the same one who's worked all the way down through the church ages that same joshua has come back in the form of his word to bring us fully into our inheritance worthy is the lamb i don't know what you might be going through what you might be facing even questions or decisions or whatever but i do know this i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall be continually in my mouth that doesn't mean that you know in the midst of you get a bill that shows up you're not expecting that you stand in the middle of the kitchen and start doing a praise break every praise is to no you might be singing near my god to thee but when it but when it comes when it comes you see this isn't something psalms 34 is not a turn on and turn off type thing this is not a once in a while once in a while up and down in and out that's not what psalms 34 is this is a life that's living from his own life a life that's walking in his presence and when situations arise it can affect us it can hit us it might seem to hit a square between the eyes it might even take the breath out of you but you can say god is faithful i don't know how but he's faithful it ain't my business to know how he's faithful he knew this was coming he knew this was he knew this was approaching he knew this test he knew this trial and i'm going to stand there and declare he's faithful his praise shall be continually in my mouth kind of hard for the devil to dwell around that isn't it oh my listen i know tonight i'm talking to believers those are even streaming i'm talking to believers we're not talking something of fantasy this ain't walt disney this ain't something you put on and start up and turn off and everything else no this is reality this is this is reality this is where in the midst of times and situations tests and trials good times bad times as brother bill sings that song all the time god is good all the time he is not just when it's good for us he's good all the time may god help us that we can boast brag on him in the midst of trials in the midst of tests in the midst of situations and even as we're going about our daily life may we take even those simple times that brother brown says you can worship god by walking up to the person in the grocery store and saying and the lord blessed us with a beautiful day and wait and see if there's an open door there oh my don't you love him amen don't you just want to spend your whole life just bragging on him bragging on him bragging on what he's done for you might say well samuel i i don't feel maybe all that far along but brag on what he's done for you testify of it don't look down you might don't then listen don't compare yourself with nobody else you let the word you compare yourself with the word and you know in your heart when the word deals with your heart there is a part that within you say yes lord let it be lord be it unto me brag on him for he is faithful let's pray heavenly father lord we love you tonight we just appreciate you what a privilege it is lord to be able to brag on you lord to be able lord to speak of you you're the theme of our lives lord you're the theme of everything that we would say or do lord as paul would write for christ who is our life lord is when a person would read a book after they get done reading that book there's been a plot where there's been a problem or problems arise but then there's a solution the solving that's all part of that plot but when the book is all finished there is an overall theme within that story that theme within that story lord many times can be summed up sometimes in just a sense sometimes lord in just a few so lord the very theme of our life when it comes back to it gets you of all of the tests and trials [Music] lord god of your molding the shaping of our character the work of redemption in our life the lord god you would deal with our hearts you would pull upon the desire that you sowed within us the lord we would heed to your call lord no matter what it is that we could be facing or what we're going through and lord when it comes down just to our daily walk with you lord jesus may we remember lord that we have not made ourselves what we are you have made us jesus it's you lord god as we read here in this scripture we are your workmanship created in christ jesus ordained unto good works lord we we want to yield [Music] we know lord god it's not us it's just lord that your grace lord god extended to us lord that we would yield to that call and heeding to it in full surrender and lord god you poured out that anointing of the holy ghost upon our life so lord when we look over the course of all of our life there's nothing that we can brag on we don't want to brag on ourselves lord lord help us because there's parts as you showed us lord even where the prophet samuel went and he went with that anointing oil to pick out the one whom you had ordained to be king instead of saul he looked at the stature looked at the height looked at all that lord god he was ready to pour that anointing oil on even the first one the eldest of jesse's sons even that the prophet samuel would say surely this is the anointing of the lord lord to show that even at times the things that we could think we could look at showing that lord how paul would write to us do not be desirous of vainglory how paul would write let not anything be done with strife and vainglory lord jesus keep it from this lord keep lord that boast and that bragging lord of ourselves or anything lord god whether it's about our church or about anything else lord let us your god keep it away from us [Music] help us the lord jesus and may our lives lord god it'd be a reflection of you and everything we pray help us oh god how we need you lord from father mother husband wife lord pastor deacon trustee no matter lord god no matter no matter lord where our calling is the lord jesus help us help us lord to be vessels help us not to despise weakness but help us lord in the midst of that to yield to you lord that you can mold us shape us and make your strength and your glory to be known we love you and we praise you tonight father minister lord to the hearts of your children if there's one here without that glory in their life lord may they receive them or tonight may they just yield lord god to you and may you lord come with a complete transformation lord we love you and we
