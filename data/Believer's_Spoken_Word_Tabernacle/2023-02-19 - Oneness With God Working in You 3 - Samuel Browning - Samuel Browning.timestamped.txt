[41:46] but it's the thought
[41:48] that you come
[41:50] to express Lord
[41:52] [Music]
[41:53] so Lord I just give myself to you Lord
[41:57] foreign
[41:58] and this congregation for the glory of
[42:00] God
[42:02] in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:05] amen and amen
[42:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:09] [Music]
[42:11] Amen in the good to be in the house of
[42:14] the Lord
[42:17] I want to invite you to the scriptures
[42:19] in John chapter 17 and
[42:21] just want to
[42:23] remind you of the fellowship dinner here
[42:26] after the service it's there at the
[42:28] Heritage Presbyterian Church there where
[42:30] we've I I don't want to say where we had
[42:32] the last one but it's where we've had
[42:34] most of them here it's right there
[42:36] across from the McDonald's and right by
[42:39] 58 most of you know where it's at if you
[42:41] don't the address I believe might be in
[42:44] the restroom if it's not on the bulletin
[42:46] board if it's not just see one of the
[42:48] deacons or someone and they can get it
[42:50] to you if you're not familiar or to
[42:52] follow someone there certainly looking
[42:55] forward to that little time for us to be
[42:56] able to come together and just to have a
[42:59] little bit of Fellowship together amen
[43:01] that's always good amen so also as we
[43:05] turn there I want to just uh ask you to
[43:08] keep in mind and remember here brother
[43:11] Joshua and sister Sharon brother Joshua
[43:13] he flew to Congo there on on Wednesday
[43:17] and
[43:18] um then um
[43:20] he and I he called me and we were uh
[43:23] over a video over what's happened so
[43:28] he's got a question why I wasn't there
[43:31] so
[43:32] being the brother that he is he turned
[43:35] it to me and I had to speak to the
[43:38] pastor
[43:39] but uh no they they just wanted to greet
[43:43] us and um
[43:44] so you know we certainly would love to
[43:47] have been able to go and just to support
[43:48] our brother and um you know and to see
[43:51] the Saints I would love to see the
[43:53] children of God and there's always been
[43:55] something in my heart very special for
[43:58] Africa and that was something from the
[44:00] very beginning when God got a hold of my
[44:02] life I can't explain it I know I've not
[44:04] been there a lot but it's just something
[44:06] God put very special in my heart and I
[44:08] just love all of God's children but
[44:10] we're just not able to go amen each and
[44:13] each and every place and you know we
[44:15] just want to go where God wants us to be
[44:18] and as we're there in the scripture
[44:20] brother Tom Sproles from uh down there
[44:23] in Bluffton he he texts me here on on
[44:26] Monday I believe it was Monday morning
[44:28] and he he asked me if I would share this
[44:30] testimony and I'm not going to read the
[44:32] full thing but it's just just a brief
[44:34] I'm going to hit just some of the
[44:35] highlights but as a brother Tom he's
[44:39] he's one that lost his
[44:42] son in a car accident at the end of June
[44:45] so they already had the two others that
[44:47] passed away and then right after I was
[44:49] there at the end of June spoke that
[44:51] Sunday morning and then that that
[44:53] afternoon as his son was in a car
[44:55] accident and uh he he passed away and
[45:00] um so brother brother Tom was was there
[45:03] within the service and
[45:05] um this is just he asked me to
[45:07] communicate this because he wanted me to
[45:09] tell it to you all he said thank you for
[45:11] yielding yourself he said I cried
[45:13] through the whole service and I was
[45:15] praying God let him call me out if you
[45:18] still hear my prayer
[45:20] every thought in my head he covered and
[45:24] after prayer a great sadness and
[45:27] depression lifted from me and he said I
[45:30] stopped by my boy's grave and it's the
[45:32] first time I didn't cry
[45:34] I have a peace and a smile that I'll see
[45:37] him again and he said I had a deep sleep
[45:39] Sunday night the first real good deep
[45:42] sleep in over seven months
[45:47] and there's more that you know they just
[45:49] had a situation there even in brother
[45:51] Tom's Family where his granddaughter was
[45:53] ran over by a semi
[45:55] uh just five weeks ago so now it's
[45:58] almost six weeks ago she said seven
[45:59] surgeries crushed pelvis two broken hips
[46:02] and the broken femurs his mom was in the
[46:06] hospital was septic and
[46:07] um then there's the other needs that's
[46:09] there with his um daughter-in-law and so
[46:12] forth but you know with all that
[46:15] situation brother Thomas he was just
[46:17] communicating with me he was praying and
[46:20] he was looking to God and the and what
[46:22] he put before God is Lord if you still
[46:24] hear my prayer let him call my name in
[46:27] the service and the Holy Spirit there
[46:29] were those that were there that here and
[46:30] right in the right in the midst of of
[46:32] ministering the Holy Spirit called him
[46:34] out right in that service last weekend
[46:36] and and then in the prayer line how God
[46:39] just lifted there that depression and
[46:42] all that he had had been with because it
[46:45] would be something where depression can
[46:48] come in very easily is that right but
[46:50] I'm glad that we serve the Living God
[46:54] I'm glad we're not without hope we're
[46:57] not without a help
[46:59] he never said sickness he never said
[47:01] things wouldn't come but he says when it
[47:03] does I will lift him from you
[47:06] and I'm grateful for that we've got a
[47:08] real absolute and a real anchor Amen in
[47:11] the Lord so we just wanted to share that
[47:14] with you brother brother Tom's request
[47:16] and he had asked that I would do that so
[47:18] we've done that to an extent we want to
[47:22] look here and I want to read just a few
[47:24] verses of scripture this morning amen
[47:26] good to have brother William back and
[47:27] good to see I think it was uh as uh
[47:31] different ones that are here and maybe
[47:33] I'm missing some that uh so if you
[47:36] haven't been here in a few weeks welcome
[47:37] back
[47:43] if you're a visitor oh no I go here well
[47:45] if welcome back
[47:48] God richly bless you we're good it's so
[47:50] good to be together isn't it amen and
[47:52] verse 20 neither pray I for these alone
[47:56] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[47:59] me through their word
[48:01] that they all may be one as thou father
[48:06] aren't in me and I in thee that they
[48:11] also may be one in us that the world may
[48:15] believe that thou has sent me
[48:17] and the glory which thou gave us me
[48:21] I have given them
[48:23] that they may be one even as we are one
[48:27] I want you to notice the glory you gave
[48:30] me
[48:31] now what did the glory
[48:33] what was that Glory that came to him it
[48:37] was the glory of God
[48:38] and what did the glory of God do the
[48:41] glory of God manifested the Son of God
[48:43] revealing the glory of God
[48:46] I know it's kind of a play on words but
[48:48] that's exactly how the prophet said it
[48:49] it was the god of Glory revealed in the
[48:52] Son of God displaying the glory of God
[48:54] so what is the glory it's it's God's own
[48:57] life that is a coming and it's unfolding
[49:00] in that that that ordained and that
[49:04] predestinated life that of the Son of
[49:06] God so that same Glory I have given them
[49:09] that they may be one even as We Are One
[49:13] i in them now he goes to lay this out I
[49:17] in them and thou in me that they may be
[49:21] made perfect in one that the world may
[49:24] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[49:27] me as thou has loved them amen may God
[49:30] bless you bless the reading of the word
[49:32] as you're being seated
[49:34] I want to continue that thought on the
[49:36] Oneness with God working within you and
[49:39] I'm just going to refer to a few places
[49:42] once again here this morning as we try
[49:44] to launch back into the thought here
[49:46] within this of the Oneness with God
[49:50] and Jesus brother REM says Jesus prayed
[49:53] that the church and he would be one like
[49:57] he and the father were one
[50:01] that the church we as members of the
[50:04] body of Christ would be one together
[50:06] just like he and the father are one
[50:12] and at that day we would know that he
[50:14] was in the father
[50:16] fathering him and he and us that
[50:19] together we were one what a union a
[50:23] Oneness that would be to see God in his
[50:27] church now I want you to catch this this
[50:29] Oneness is to see God in his church
[50:36] not that we have the physical
[50:40] uh
[50:42] characteristics that the Lord Jesus had
[50:45] you know brother Brian goes through that
[50:47] wearing the long Palestinian robe out of
[50:50] the beard it's not the outward image
[50:54] that God came to express God took the
[50:58] form of man in order to redeem man
[51:03] is that right and so the image that God
[51:07] is bringing back to you and I and to
[51:10] bring forth in our lives is his own
[51:13] image his own likeness
[51:17] in a many membered body
[51:21] all looking different different
[51:23] nationalities
[51:25] different likes
[51:28] right but remember said I like cherry
[51:30] pie my brother likes apple
[51:33] I like both
[51:35] right
[51:37] but see different but yet
[51:41] the Same by the indwelling of his holy
[51:44] spirit
[51:46] that's true Oneness
[51:49] so what a union a Oneness that would be
[51:52] to see God in his church till every
[51:55] member is just perfectly in harmony with
[51:59] each other
[52:01] and God
[52:02] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[52:05] for and that's when his prayer will be
[52:08] answered that we will be one
[52:11] and it is the only grounds of Fellowship
[52:14] that God has ever laid down for himself
[52:17] and his church is the Oneness of himself
[52:22] in the people that's the only grounds of
[52:26] fellowship and the only way that you can
[52:28] have those grounds is by a union to be
[52:31] United with him forever so that Oneness
[52:35] is himself in his church
[52:41] not a collection of ideas
[52:44] not a Doctrine
[52:47] but himself
[52:52] this is God's Oneness now notice our
[52:54] brother Bram steps into this and I've
[52:56] we've read from these this as well
[52:58] before this is God's Oneness this is
[53:00] like the cliff notes to it all this is
[53:02] God's Oneness when the spirit that you
[53:06] God agrees with this word
[53:10] and Manifest this word and makes this
[53:13] word power to act the same way it did
[53:17] there now the Holy Spirit comes Upon Our
[53:20] Lives to work to bring us into agreement
[53:24] with the word but it's not to stop there
[53:28] because we can agree this is the truth
[53:31] right but it's it's something that's
[53:34] deeper than us looking at truth as far
[53:37] as intellectually accepting it or by the
[53:40] mind but it's to recognize it's more
[53:43] than a Bank Of Truth it is the person of
[53:47] Truth himself
[53:49] because truth is not a Doctrine truth is
[53:53] not an idea truth is not an ism truth is
[53:57] the person of Jesus Christ revealed
[54:02] he said I am the truth the way and the
[54:07] life
[54:08] so now it it starts with an agreement
[54:10] because it can't go any further there
[54:13] has to be first an agreeance in the word
[54:16] and not only is that coming to the new
[54:18] birth but it also is the word working in
[54:21] our life of where it's us agreeing with
[54:24] the word amen so be it Lord and inviting
[54:28] him and it manifests this is what the
[54:31] spirit of God does within our life it
[54:33] manifests this word and it makes this
[54:36] word power to act the same way it did
[54:40] there
[54:42] so the Holy Spirit him coming into our
[54:45] lives what does he come for because
[54:48] think of it there's a lot of rain
[54:49] there's a lot of sun that can hit upon
[54:51] the Earth but the Sun never came to warm
[54:54] the Earth
[54:55] it never came in the rain just to fall
[54:58] upon the dirt but it's what is inside of
[55:02] that dirt
[55:03] it's the seed that's that's what that's
[55:06] what the light and that's what the water
[55:07] is for is for that seed that's in there
[55:11] so this is where it comes down the Holy
[55:14] Spirit comes for the seed that is there
[55:18] within the body of Believers that are
[55:21] laying down through time that's what the
[55:24] word has come for this is why down
[55:27] through the seven Gentile Church ages it
[55:30] has been the Seven Stars in his right
[55:33] hand meaning Authority and power of the
[55:36] godhead reflecting Jesus Christ as the
[55:39] mighty conqueror the triumphant one amen
[55:42] the one who paid the all-sufficient
[55:44] price our Kinsmen it's reflecting that
[55:48] light into the Church of the Living God
[55:51] that he is the way it's reflecting the
[55:54] trueness Beyond man's ideas and
[55:57] conceptions it reflects and it draws
[56:00] back to a place what God desires and
[56:03] that is a true relationship with his
[56:07] children
[56:09] that's God's desire
[56:11] so he manifests this word and he makes
[56:14] this word power to act the same way it
[56:17] did there and brother Bram goes on to
[56:19] say let's say it together Oneness with
[56:22] God is to have God's spirit in you
[56:25] agreeing with the word all the word the
[56:28] whole word and to make it manifested in
[56:31] power
[56:33] now in Hebrew or Ephesians 3 20 it says
[56:37] now unto him that is able to do
[56:40] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[56:44] ask or think according to the power that
[56:47] worketh in US
[56:49] unto him be glory in the church by Jesus
[56:53] Christ throughout all ages world without
[56:56] in amen
[56:58] so unto him so almighty God so to think
[57:03] of it at all because it's all God at
[57:06] work Jesus was not a separate person
[57:08] from God
[57:09] but it was God come down himself to
[57:13] satisfy his own requirements
[57:17] right so when he came he did not come
[57:20] apart from the word but he became
[57:22] himself the word was now made flesh for
[57:27] what purpose for Redemption so when the
[57:29] word is made flesh it is for Redemption
[57:33] because even when that word is being
[57:35] made flesh it is an announcement to the
[57:38] children of God Redemption is on
[57:42] reconciliation is on restoration is here
[57:49] it's on to him be glory in the church by
[57:53] Jesus Christ so this is how that glory
[57:56] is coming down into the church now
[57:58] Colossians chapter 1 verse 17 and he is
[58:03] before all things and by him all things
[58:06] consist and he is the head of the body
[58:10] the church who is the beginning the
[58:13] firstborn from the dead that in all
[58:16] things he might have the preeminence for
[58:20] it pleased the father that in him should
[58:23] all fullness dwell
[58:26] and having made peace through the blood
[58:28] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[58:32] things unto himself by him I say whether
[58:36] they be things in Earth or things in
[58:40] heaven
[58:41] I want you just just settle this here he
[58:44] paid the way for complete reconciliation
[58:52] where you and I are at right now
[58:56] if you have been born again of the
[58:58] spirit of God you have experienced a
[59:01] reconciliation with God's Own nature in
[59:05] you and there's a yearning there's a
[59:08] drawing there's a desire for more of God
[59:11] wordy what is that desire it's a desire
[59:14] to be clothed upon with that Tabernacle
[59:18] that is from heaven
[59:20] see the yearning when a person has been
[59:23] filled with the spirit of God it's a
[59:25] yearning for more of God
[59:28] that's what affects and influences the
[59:31] decisions in our life and as we walk
[59:34] more with God we begin to learn from our
[59:39] mistakes we begin to as a child of God
[59:42] we begin to grow and learn to realize
[59:45] that every decision is to be weighed
[59:48] carefully not by my feelings not by My
[59:52] reasonings but by the word of almighty
[59:56] God
[59:59] is that right
[1:00:03] now that reconciliation it leads to
[1:00:07] heaven but notice verse 21 and you now
[1:00:11] watch how Paul was writing this and you
[1:00:13] that were sometime alienated and enemies
[1:00:17] in your own mind in your mind by Wicked
[1:00:20] works now he's not talking about this
[1:00:22] matter up here but he's talking about
[1:00:25] that nature that soul that was there we
[1:00:29] were alienated from God
[1:00:32] even man could walk in the presence of
[1:00:35] God but remember when he would offer up
[1:00:37] the sacrifice he went right back out
[1:00:40] having the same desire in him
[1:00:45] are you hearing me why because that
[1:00:47] blood could not take away and dismiss
[1:00:51] what was against it and really deal with
[1:00:54] sin nature it only covered it so that
[1:00:57] man could come in the prince of God
[1:01:00] it spoke there was going to come a
[1:01:03] perfect covering where there would be a
[1:01:06] perfect cleansing bringing a perfect
[1:01:08] Deliverance that man could walk as a Son
[1:01:11] of God again with full Authority by
[1:01:15] freedom from the innermost in his life
[1:01:18] and you that were sometimes alienated
[1:01:22] and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works
[1:01:26] yet now hath he reconciled
[1:01:31] see this is tremendous it ain't
[1:01:33] something he's doing right now
[1:01:35] he is making known I've already made the
[1:01:40] way
[1:01:42] I've already made the way of the way he
[1:01:44] has been opened up
[1:01:47] hallelujah it's already you know I've
[1:01:50] got all this against me he's already
[1:01:52] paid the price
[1:01:54] what do I do stop letting the devil lie
[1:01:56] to you
[1:01:58] amen throw it down cast it down I don't
[1:02:01] care what it is throw it down
[1:02:04] I don't care what happened to this throw
[1:02:06] it down
[1:02:08] are you hearing me now
[1:02:11] in the body known as yet now hath he
[1:02:14] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:02:16] through death to present you holy and
[1:02:21] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:02:24] sight
[1:02:25] who's the you
[1:02:28] that's the real you
[1:02:30] that's the Son and Daughter of God
[1:02:32] that's what real repentance is it's
[1:02:35] repenting for allowing that old nature
[1:02:37] to have its place in our life
[1:02:40] are you hearing me well brother Samuel I
[1:02:43] never did it but repentance is repenting
[1:02:46] for allowing that old nature to have
[1:02:49] dominion in our life forgive me Lord for
[1:02:52] my sins
[1:02:54] what is it it's a worth of
[1:02:56] reconciliation let me tell you something
[1:02:58] when you've got God on your side all of
[1:03:02] Heaven is behind you
[1:03:05] if you can just respond to that word go
[1:03:08] beyond your feelings press beyond the
[1:03:10] barrier
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:13] Allelujah
[1:03:15] what is it it's a word of reconciliation
[1:03:20] to present you
[1:03:22] holy and unblameable and unreprovable in
[1:03:27] his sight
[1:03:29] if you continue in the faith grounded
[1:03:32] and settled and be not moved away from
[1:03:35] the hope of the Gospel see verse 23
[1:03:38] only manifest the work of Calvary in the
[1:03:43] innermost part of an individual's life
[1:03:45] are you with me because listen a child
[1:03:48] of God an elect an elect child of God
[1:03:50] listen they might backslide they might
[1:03:53] get away but you can never get away from
[1:03:55] God a matter of fact if you belong to
[1:03:57] God just heard the prophet again this
[1:03:58] week he said you backslide you'll be the
[1:04:01] most miserable person there is
[1:04:03] thank you Jesus
[1:04:06] make every backslider miserable God take
[1:04:10] peace from them when their hands on the
[1:04:12] pillow Rob them from peace Lord God let
[1:04:15] them find no peace outside of you
[1:04:18] brother Samuel you are not prayed that
[1:04:20] way I ought to pray that way because the
[1:04:23] value of that Soul one soul is worth
[1:04:26] more than ten thousand worlds
[1:04:29] I'd rather have their peace taken from
[1:04:32] them here than they miss the real peace
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:39] Hallelujah
[1:04:42] so to continue in the faith that that
[1:04:45] only becomes a manifestation of what is
[1:04:48] working that has come about in that life
[1:04:50] so God came down to re-establish a
[1:04:54] Oneness between God and man so I want to
[1:04:56] read here once again from the message
[1:04:58] Oneness and these are some points that I
[1:05:00] just feel upon my heart to really read
[1:05:02] in just to kind of drag my feet a little
[1:05:04] bit on here we could preach it but I
[1:05:06] want to just I want to lay these things
[1:05:07] in
[1:05:08] notice he says the expressed image come
[1:05:11] Jesus the immaculate one the lovely one
[1:05:15] oh I love that the fairest of ten
[1:05:18] thousand the lily of the valley the rose
[1:05:20] of Sharon oh the Morning Star what is he
[1:05:23] what did he come for oh he says to
[1:05:26] re-establish Oneness between God and man
[1:05:31] so it was all it was established there
[1:05:33] in the beginning but what broke that
[1:05:36] Union
[1:05:38] what broken is doubt the word of God
[1:05:43] doubting the word and that's why brother
[1:05:45] random over and over in this message he
[1:05:47] says when you doubt the word or you get
[1:05:50] away from the word you've broken your
[1:05:52] fellowship
[1:05:54] we could preach that all on all levels
[1:05:58] when you get away from the word
[1:06:02] I'm not just talking about the word as
[1:06:04] far as letter remember the word is the
[1:06:08] very character and nature of Jesus
[1:06:10] Christ
[1:06:12] when you get away from that right there
[1:06:14] Fellowship is broken
[1:06:16] and if you're a child of God and the
[1:06:18] Holy Spirit is there he's going to
[1:06:20] correct you
[1:06:22] you know why because he loves you
[1:06:25] his desire is to do for you and to work
[1:06:28] through your life
[1:06:31] Oh Glory now notice this he says all
[1:06:34] their towers of Babel
[1:06:37] and all their other things back there
[1:06:39] didn't work all their fruits of the
[1:06:41] gardens and everything else displease
[1:06:44] God what was all of that
[1:06:47] well that was all efforts of man
[1:06:50] that was all efforts of man remember
[1:06:52] Linda Brown says it so simply when Cain
[1:06:54] came before God he came with Adam's idea
[1:06:57] right he came with Adam's idea
[1:07:00] but Abel did not come with his own idea
[1:07:05] Abel came
[1:07:07] with God's revelation of himself
[1:07:13] so God came down and was conceived in
[1:07:16] the womb of a Woman by his own self and
[1:07:18] made himself a body and become Emmanuel
[1:07:21] God With Us now I know we're very
[1:07:24] familiar with this week a minute as
[1:07:26] listening to the message we can quote
[1:07:28] that and say you know Mary had nothing
[1:07:31] to do with it God didn't even borrow an
[1:07:33] egg and and you know his both sperm and
[1:07:36] egg of God because this was a tabernacle
[1:07:38] it could not be any kind of Mary we're
[1:07:40] very much versed within that but to
[1:07:42] think of the Simplicity of how that when
[1:07:45] we see that that God so placed his word
[1:07:48] to where there was nobody else that
[1:07:51] could fulfill this word outside of God
[1:07:54] himself
[1:07:55] and when God gives a promise he's
[1:07:58] obligating himself and what God makes it
[1:08:00] in such a way man could try at it man
[1:08:03] can probe at it but there's no way for
[1:08:05] man to achieve that promise but God made
[1:08:09] the promise and he made it in such a way
[1:08:11] that it'll take nothing less than deity
[1:08:16] so they had nothing to do with the woman
[1:08:18] God borrowed their womb
[1:08:22] let me say this clearly your new birth
[1:08:25] my New Birth has nothing to do with you
[1:08:28] or a man it has everything to do with
[1:08:32] God
[1:08:33] the best works that we could give God it
[1:08:36] will never stand in his presence why
[1:08:38] because he doesn't see himself he still
[1:08:41] sees you and I but when we can accept
[1:08:43] the provided way then it is God not
[1:08:47] seeing us not our works but he sees
[1:08:50] himself on display
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:56] what do I have to do accept it
[1:08:59] accept it
[1:09:03] well I've got to clean this up you can't
[1:09:05] clean your life up for nothing okay
[1:09:10] you're like a leopard with spots on the
[1:09:13] more you lick them the more they stand
[1:09:15] out
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:17] what must I do let the Holy Spirit move
[1:09:21] in there let the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:23] go to work
[1:09:26] I tell you what I do I start moving into
[1:09:28] that bloodstream I'd say yes Lord be it
[1:09:31] unto me Lord according to Thy Word
[1:09:34] that's what I'd start doing because
[1:09:36] remember the angel of his presence is
[1:09:39] troubling the hottest oh my the angel of
[1:09:43] his presence is what brought back the
[1:09:45] Red Sea it's the angel of his presence
[1:09:47] that came down at the pool of Bethesda
[1:09:50] it's the same angel of his presence
[1:09:52] that's right here this morning he's
[1:09:54] troubling the waters he's opening the
[1:09:57] word why so that you can have healing
[1:10:00] foreign
[1:10:03] Jew look at this he wasn't Jew nor
[1:10:07] Gentile but God
[1:10:10] he wasn't Jew
[1:10:13] are you hearing me
[1:10:15] he wasn't Gentile he was God
[1:10:20] that's pretty powerful isn't it
[1:10:22] there's a lot of different nationalities
[1:10:24] sitting right here this morning
[1:10:26] ethnicities however politically correct
[1:10:28] you want to make it put the spin you
[1:10:30] want to put on it but it still comes
[1:10:33] down into Jesus Christ coming in flesh
[1:10:37] I think like old Charles Johnson would
[1:10:39] sing that song Charles Johnson and the
[1:10:41] revivers he got there and he said you
[1:10:43] know they're talking about a black
[1:10:44] church and a Mexican church and a this
[1:10:46] church and of that church he said how
[1:10:48] many complexions do the Holy Ghost come
[1:10:50] in
[1:10:52] [Applause]
[1:10:54] it's God in a mini-membered body
[1:10:59] he never came to highlight a race he
[1:11:02] came to establish a new race a god race
[1:11:08] Hallelujah
[1:11:09] because the race that was already here
[1:11:12] was polluted but God came down
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] people that's going to be called by my
[1:11:18] name they'll be born in my spirit they
[1:11:21] will bear my image
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:26] glory be to God in the highest
[1:11:29] and the Gentiles was just as much to him
[1:11:32] at any time only he tried to separate a
[1:11:34] Jew for a nation so notice how God what
[1:11:36] he was doing with the Jews he God was
[1:11:38] trying to separate you you find this
[1:11:40] principle all the way down brother Brown
[1:11:42] keeps working with this in the message
[1:11:43] Oneness how that Satan if you haven't
[1:11:47] listened to the message Oneness go back
[1:11:49] and listen to it if you've listened to
[1:11:50] it go back and listen to it if you
[1:11:52] listen to it go back and listen to it
[1:11:53] you get what I'm saying because when you
[1:11:56] recognize within this Satan his tactic
[1:11:59] against the New Birth has always bring
[1:12:02] been to bring a conglomeration of a
[1:12:06] collective effort or coming under one
[1:12:08] canopy but he does it outside of God's
[1:12:12] provided way and every time God comes
[1:12:15] down time and time again he'll bring a
[1:12:18] word he destroyed the Tower of Babel
[1:12:21] scattered the people for what purpose
[1:12:23] that he might deal with man individually
[1:12:28] On and On Through the scriptures here
[1:12:30] they would want to jump come together
[1:12:32] and God would come and bring a word that
[1:12:35] would bring separation for what purpose
[1:12:37] that God might deal individually
[1:12:40] with his people
[1:12:42] because the new birth is an individual
[1:12:45] experience
[1:12:46] are you hearing me now
[1:12:48] oh look you say that he he tried to do
[1:12:51] everything to get it back and the only
[1:12:52] way he can re-establish it was come back
[1:12:54] to an individual like he was at the
[1:12:57] beginning
[1:12:58] that's the way it is today to an
[1:12:59] individual not to a denomination not to
[1:13:02] an organization not to a group of people
[1:13:04] but to an individual to re-establish
[1:13:07] Oneness between God and man
[1:13:11] so the way God works in it building up
[1:13:14] his body is with individuals that are
[1:13:18] united with him and as we're United with
[1:13:20] him we are a part of the body of Jesus
[1:13:25] Christ
[1:13:26] right we're not a part of the body of
[1:13:28] Jesus Christ because we believe the
[1:13:30] message
[1:13:31] I'm gonna preacher now we're not a part
[1:13:34] of the body of Jesus Christ because we
[1:13:36] believe God sent a prophet
[1:13:39] come on I can give you quotes on it now
[1:13:42] but we are a part of the body of Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ because we have accepted the
[1:13:47] message we have acted upon that message
[1:13:49] and that message is Jesus Christ in
[1:13:53] flesh once again in your flesh
[1:13:57] that's the message anything outside of
[1:14:01] the Holy Ghost in you is not the message
[1:14:04] the message is Christ in you
[1:14:10] not on you in you
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:19] he paid the debt of sin
[1:14:23] now in order to get this Oneness here
[1:14:26] between God and man
[1:14:28] Jesus could not do it as long as he was
[1:14:30] here in a body of Flesh
[1:14:33] he had to become the complete sin
[1:14:35] offering to take away the guilt of the
[1:14:37] believer
[1:14:38] take it away so that the Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] could come into man and make man and God
[1:14:42] won us again
[1:14:45] let me just say this to you don't
[1:14:48] wrestle with your guilt
[1:14:52] are you hearing me now
[1:14:54] if we got to drop that down in first
[1:14:56] gear we'll do it and drive today
[1:14:58] don't wrestle with your guilt there's
[1:15:01] already been a blood that's been shed
[1:15:03] you don't have to wrestle with it any
[1:15:06] longer
[1:15:07] you just have to accept what he's
[1:15:10] already done how do I accept it lay your
[1:15:13] life down
[1:15:15] I lay it all down lord
[1:15:20] but the same I'm not worthy none of us
[1:15:22] were
[1:15:25] you could take the most righteous person
[1:15:27] in the world they weren't worthy and the
[1:15:31] righteousness could never make them
[1:15:33] Worthy
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:37] um
[1:15:39] Hallelujah there had to be something to
[1:15:41] re-establish
[1:15:43] and what could it be
[1:15:45] he said God's commandment is fulfilled
[1:15:47] could an angel fulfill it he has no
[1:15:49] blood
[1:15:51] could God have fulfilled it he had no
[1:15:54] blood
[1:15:56] but God did fulfill it is that right but
[1:15:58] notice could God he's talking about as a
[1:16:00] spirit God he is a spirit
[1:16:03] is that right and God became so here
[1:16:07] Spirit God became flesh and blood in
[1:16:12] order that he could pay the debt
[1:16:14] correctly and take away sin because
[1:16:17] that's the only way
[1:16:20] what was the only way that God become
[1:16:24] flesh and pay the debt so if that's the
[1:16:28] only way that sin could be taken away is
[1:16:30] by God becoming flesh and paying the
[1:16:33] debt then the only way that that debt
[1:16:36] paid can be fully realized and acted
[1:16:39] upon it'll take the same God who paid
[1:16:41] the debt who got up on the Easter
[1:16:44] morning for that same God to now be made
[1:16:47] manifest in your life and then that is a
[1:16:51] declaration this is the way
[1:16:57] Oh Glory
[1:16:59] that produces a total separation so the
[1:17:02] new birth itself is the achievement of
[1:17:04] almighty God now notice Colossians 1 18
[1:17:06] we pulled from he is the head of the
[1:17:08] body of the church who is the beginning
[1:17:10] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:17:12] things he might have the preeminence
[1:17:16] now when you realize this
[1:17:18] brother Brian will continue to lay the
[1:17:20] sin and Christ the mystery that's
[1:17:21] another good message to get into and
[1:17:24] just to marinate on brother Samuel that
[1:17:26] message is three hours and 45 minutes
[1:17:28] long I know but ain't nobody said you
[1:17:30] got to sit down and listen to the whole
[1:17:32] thing at once
[1:17:34] right
[1:17:35] I mean you just take take and take some
[1:17:37] at a time
[1:17:39] take some at a time
[1:17:41] is that all right take some out of time
[1:17:44] come on
[1:17:45] I know I'm talking some people some good
[1:17:47] snackers in here
[1:17:50] we graze and then we live a little bit
[1:17:52] of this well I don't eat much well let's
[1:17:53] put it all together then let's put all
[1:17:55] the I don't eat much nibble here nibble
[1:17:57] there nibble hear a nibble there must
[1:17:58] have a lot of mice in the house or
[1:17:59] something
[1:18:02] is that right oh Glory how do we get on
[1:18:05] that but notice that we might have the
[1:18:08] preeminent that he might have the
[1:18:10] preeminence now notice but before as
[1:18:13] brother Brown works with this in the
[1:18:14] message it's key he talks about the
[1:18:17] threefold manifestation of God before
[1:18:20] preeminence could ever come which would
[1:18:22] be himself coming in to his church
[1:18:25] before that could ever be it would have
[1:18:28] to be the blood is said where God has
[1:18:31] revealed himself for who he is because
[1:18:35] you see when God manifests himself it's
[1:18:38] more than somebody's testimony about it
[1:18:41] it's more than you rehearsing somebody
[1:18:43] else's word it's more than quoting a
[1:18:46] word what you have seen is the Living
[1:18:49] God made manifest before you and when
[1:18:52] you see that you let let you know that's
[1:18:55] what God has for me
[1:18:57] that's why when God reveals himself like
[1:19:00] he did through the ministry of Malachi 4
[1:19:03] it wasn't a show
[1:19:06] you say what was that it was the glory
[1:19:08] of God that was coming down and
[1:19:11] unfolding the word of God by the promise
[1:19:14] of God by the spirit of God and what did
[1:19:16] it do to the believer to you and I as a
[1:19:19] Believer it gets our attention
[1:19:22] to the rest they still talk about it
[1:19:26] oh what breaks Supernatural was done and
[1:19:29] brother asked me we're going to go out
[1:19:30] and we're going to do this and we're
[1:19:31] going to do that and we're going to do
[1:19:32] that look at them talk about him in
[1:19:35] their conferences sitting there with
[1:19:36] women with bobbed hair and you know
[1:19:38] earrings on they could ride him like a
[1:19:40] horse
[1:19:42] no Holiness whatsoever but what they
[1:19:44] want is the power and the manifestation
[1:19:48] but that Glory was not for that to turn
[1:19:51] the world Upside Down That Glory came to
[1:19:54] release and reveal Sons and Daughters of
[1:19:57] God once again that same Glory that was
[1:20:01] poured out that same message that would
[1:20:03] be spoken would now come and live in a
[1:20:06] many-membered body
[1:20:09] so he must reveal himself
[1:20:12] first
[1:20:14] that's why I believe in the Holy Ghost I
[1:20:17] normally believe because I'm born of it
[1:20:19] but I believe it's the absolute
[1:20:20] necessity of the hour
[1:20:22] I believe his presence is the absolute
[1:20:25] necessity Among Us
[1:20:32] why what was this preeminence that he
[1:20:34] might live in people and I'm just going
[1:20:36] to refer a few places pulling these out
[1:20:38] of Christ the mystery till he could have
[1:20:41] the preeminence to express himself
[1:20:43] through them now notice to express
[1:20:47] himself
[1:20:48] through them
[1:20:51] so it's God expressing himself
[1:20:54] through individuals
[1:20:58] but the individual can look different
[1:21:01] makeups but it's the same almighty God
[1:21:05] the same nature
[1:21:07] that's on display
[1:21:10] is that right
[1:21:11] now notice here it would be him revealed
[1:21:15] and expressed now I want you to notice
[1:21:17] this it would be that revealing of
[1:21:19] himself among the people that would
[1:21:21] actually make himself known or opening
[1:21:24] up the way now God has expressed this
[1:21:26] solemn desire to indwell man once again
[1:21:29] because remember man is his place of
[1:21:32] rest remember when Solomon here it was
[1:21:34] spoken by inspiration of how but God you
[1:21:37] know you built me a house but what house
[1:21:39] is or what house will you build me what
[1:21:41] house can you build me that I can come
[1:21:43] and dwell in but it showed that God even
[1:21:46] in the types that he showed that God
[1:21:48] himself would not only prepare his
[1:21:51] dwelling place in order to redeem you
[1:21:53] and I but through that Dwelling Place
[1:21:55] when God would become man remember it
[1:21:58] was a reconciling of God and man it was
[1:22:00] God on display and through that God
[1:22:03] would Express through that life of the
[1:22:05] Lord Jesus of what he intended every son
[1:22:08] and daughter of God to be to where that
[1:22:11] God God through him by the new birth
[1:22:13] would actually come back to his rightful
[1:22:15] position within the very heart of man in
[1:22:19] that controls in that control tower that
[1:22:21] has been God's desire all along
[1:22:25] so you saw me if you say well do the
[1:22:27] same y'all now I'm tired of hearing
[1:22:29] preaching on the new birth then
[1:22:30] something's wrong
[1:22:32] because the new birth what it does it's
[1:22:34] bringing God right back to his rightful
[1:22:36] position and when you recognize that in
[1:22:39] your life you recognize your source of
[1:22:41] authority your headquarters your your
[1:22:44] place of operation that everything in
[1:22:47] your life is to be based upon would be
[1:22:49] those sacred Sands of God's grace in
[1:22:52] your life if you can accept it when the
[1:22:55] New Birth has come into your life your
[1:22:57] soul has become a watered Garden of Eden
[1:23:01] it has become a choice of God's control
[1:23:04] tower where God and His man is pride is
[1:23:07] United together the rest of this Earth
[1:23:09] that's outside of the gates but it's
[1:23:12] brought subject to the god of Glory
[1:23:14] who's residing once again in his garden
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:21] foreign
[1:23:22] notice this in here Genesis 3 14 and the
[1:23:26] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[1:23:28] thou Hast done this now I want you to
[1:23:30] watch this
[1:23:31] he's speaking to the serpent the upright
[1:23:36] Beast
[1:23:37] all right
[1:23:38] Thou Art cursed above all cattle above
[1:23:42] every beast of the field upon by belly
[1:23:45] shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat
[1:23:49] all the days of thy life
[1:23:52] why because he yielded himself to the
[1:23:55] wrong inspiration
[1:23:57] is that right
[1:23:58] it had been okay but he yielded himself
[1:24:00] to the wrong inspiration and became a
[1:24:04] Channel of death
[1:24:06] movie could preach Thursday night
[1:24:08] service right there
[1:24:09] but notice verse 15.
[1:24:11] and I will put enmity between thee and
[1:24:15] the woman
[1:24:17] and between thy seed and her seat so now
[1:24:19] he's no more addressing the serpent the
[1:24:23] upright Beast he's addressing Satan
[1:24:28] that nature
[1:24:29] I will put enmity between thee and the
[1:24:33] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:24:37] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:24:41] bruise his heel
[1:24:44] so this seed that would come because you
[1:24:46] realize the woman doesn't have a seed is
[1:24:48] that right
[1:24:49] but you know so God had to give her a
[1:24:52] seed but God giving a seed remember it
[1:24:55] was God himself now supplying that egg
[1:24:58] and that sperm it was God himself
[1:25:00] creating a tabernacle for himself to
[1:25:03] dwell in and like brother man said he
[1:25:05] said once God gives it to her it now is
[1:25:08] her seed oh my you see once God has
[1:25:11] given you the Holy Ghost it belongs to
[1:25:13] you now and you belong to it amen it's
[1:25:17] who you really are and it's that which
[1:25:19] you're trying to lay a hold on it's just
[1:25:21] it's so precious and it's I want to know
[1:25:23] more about him I I want to see more I
[1:25:26] want to know you know why you finally
[1:25:28] glory be to God in the eyes you have
[1:25:30] finally been reunited and acquainted
[1:25:33] with who you really are
[1:25:35] you are always a son and daughter of God
[1:25:40] but now you've been reunited with
[1:25:42] another nature your name in the Lamb's
[1:25:45] Book of Life
[1:25:47] and the Holy Ghost has come to tie you
[1:25:50] in to where the Bible you're carrying
[1:25:53] and you are not two different people but
[1:25:56] this you and the world have become one
[1:26:01] it's an expression then out of our life
[1:26:08] and it's for this First John 3 8. he
[1:26:11] that commit a sin
[1:26:13] that word committeth is Habitual is of
[1:26:17] the devil for the devil sinneth from the
[1:26:20] beginning
[1:26:21] but notice here's the Habit breaker for
[1:26:24] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:26:26] manifested
[1:26:28] why
[1:26:30] why was the son of God manifested
[1:26:33] say it again
[1:26:35] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:26:38] devil
[1:26:40] so as he was manifest it came to do what
[1:26:43] crushed and bruised the head
[1:26:47] right he paid the price he was
[1:26:49] manifested to take care of the sin
[1:26:53] question are you hearing me now
[1:26:55] but he made a way through that
[1:26:57] manifestation that he could be
[1:26:59] manifested in your life to destroy the
[1:27:02] works of the devil that's what the Holy
[1:27:05] Ghost does when it comes in by the new
[1:27:07] prayer it destroys the works of the
[1:27:11] devil
[1:27:13] are you hearing me it's not just an
[1:27:16] anointing that comes on you and you
[1:27:18] leave out a church and you're the same
[1:27:19] person but it's an anointing that comes
[1:27:22] and it brings a transformation on the
[1:27:25] inside you're the same at church you're
[1:27:27] the same out of church you're the same
[1:27:29] in your home why you're a genuine
[1:27:31] article of God
[1:27:37] laughs
[1:27:38] Hallelujah
[1:27:40] that's why it takes a manifestation of
[1:27:42] God that's why this message produces
[1:27:45] nothing less
[1:27:47] are you hearing me it's the
[1:27:49] manifestation of almighty god notice in
[1:27:52] Romans 11 26 and so all Israel shall be
[1:27:55] saved watch how this is worded as it is
[1:27:58] written there shall come out of Zion
[1:28:00] the deliverer
[1:28:03] out of who out of Zion who's Ryan the
[1:28:06] bride
[1:28:08] is that right
[1:28:10] amen glory be to God think about it Ruth
[1:28:14] hands it back over to the Jews and what
[1:28:17] notice what design what this one this
[1:28:20] deliverer coming out of Zion will do
[1:28:22] remember when the bride is taken away in
[1:28:24] Rapture then he moves to do what deal
[1:28:26] with 144 000.
[1:28:29] not not the whole not all of Israel will
[1:28:32] be saved only that which is of the elect
[1:28:34] in the 144 000. is that right now notice
[1:28:37] when he comes Zion he will come and has
[1:28:41] shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob
[1:28:45] for this is my Covenant unto them when I
[1:28:50] shall take away their sins
[1:28:52] now notice when I so his coming comes to
[1:28:57] deal with sin
[1:29:00] when I shall come
[1:29:03] not a thought not an idea but when I
[1:29:07] the person shall take away their sins so
[1:29:10] his Mis revealing of himself what does
[1:29:13] it do it pulls upon the elect to
[1:29:16] recognize what belongs to him that's why
[1:29:20] to the elect the elect is not just
[1:29:21] running around Oh Glory to God what a
[1:29:24] healing Revival oh my this and oh my
[1:29:26] that look listen the bride she has all
[1:29:29] those things
[1:29:30] all right
[1:29:31] but that's not the focus of the hour the
[1:29:35] message of the hour it'd be awesome to
[1:29:37] study if you just go in and type I'd
[1:29:39] love to preach it sometime that's the
[1:29:41] message and you recognize within that
[1:29:44] the real message is getting under the
[1:29:47] blood of Jesus Christ you can know every
[1:29:50] quote you can know every vernacular and
[1:29:53] still not have the Holy Ghost
[1:29:57] brother Samuel that's awful hard you'll
[1:30:00] thank me someday for it
[1:30:03] foreign
[1:30:05] but you see if you don't have something
[1:30:07] in you that wants to align with the word
[1:30:08] you'll find somewhere where you can line
[1:30:10] up to as much as you want to be
[1:30:15] is that right
[1:30:16] see God's not in the business I'm making
[1:30:18] people bribe that's not bride he don't
[1:30:20] even make bride bride bride manifests
[1:30:22] that she's bride under what his presence
[1:30:25] the unfolding of himself
[1:30:30] are you hearing me I think it's
[1:30:31] wonderful to witness but I think we go
[1:30:33] to a different level if you're trying to
[1:30:35] pull people trying to pull them try to
[1:30:37] tug on them try to pull over them just
[1:30:38] be an example because you might be
[1:30:40] pulling and tugging on something that
[1:30:43] doesn't belong
[1:30:45] yeah
[1:30:46] are you hearing me remember in all of
[1:30:49] your pulling and talking it won't be you
[1:30:51] saying glory to God my wife made it
[1:30:53] because why because I pulled on her I
[1:30:55] tugged on her I put her down I shamed
[1:30:57] her I rebuked her I did this I did that
[1:31:00] I did that and God said well my Lord I
[1:31:03] wouldn't even have to go to Calvary if
[1:31:04] you did all that
[1:31:08] what's the greatest witness listen now
[1:31:11] what's the greatest witness the Son of
[1:31:14] God was manifested that he might destroy
[1:31:18] the works of the devil there is no
[1:31:22] greater power and witness than the
[1:31:26] manifestation of the glory of God in
[1:31:29] your life
[1:31:30] and His glory comes down and it helps us
[1:31:33] shut our mouth when we need to shut it
[1:31:35] preach with me now I'm already on to
[1:31:37] other parts now but we better come back
[1:31:39] to today the glory of God moving in our
[1:31:41] life a Oneness with the working of his
[1:31:44] holy spirit so notice I want you to look
[1:31:46] at this in Jeremiah 31 33 but this shall
[1:31:49] be the Covenant many places we could
[1:31:52] pull in the scripture but I want you to
[1:31:53] look at this one real close this shall
[1:31:55] be the Covenant that I will make with
[1:31:57] the house of Israel after those days
[1:32:00] saith the Lord I will put my law in
[1:32:02] their inner parts now think about this
[1:32:04] he's not just speaking this to Israel
[1:32:07] remember Paul would pick this up and
[1:32:09] apply it to us as New Testament
[1:32:11] Believers that it's God placing his word
[1:32:15] into our lives so let me read this I
[1:32:18] will put my law into their inward parts
[1:32:22] and write it in their hearts and I will
[1:32:27] be their God
[1:32:31] oh my that word I will be there Elohim
[1:32:36] will be the source of where all
[1:32:39] Direction comes from their life
[1:32:41] I will be the one that energizes death I
[1:32:44] will be the one that directs their life
[1:32:46] I'm the same one that directed Abraham's
[1:32:49] life where Abraham reproduced my faith
[1:32:52] so will my faith be reproduced through
[1:32:56] my body of Believers through a people
[1:32:58] that are Outcast rejected and despise
[1:33:01] that they themselves even have trouble
[1:33:04] looking and having confidence in their
[1:33:06] own selves but there is the grace of God
[1:33:09] that helps you and I to override our own
[1:33:12] will and submit it to him why that the
[1:33:15] faith of Elohim might be reproduced in
[1:33:18] our lives because we are not here
[1:33:21] because of our faith
[1:33:23] oh my faith my faith my faith your faith
[1:33:26] and my faith is no count without his
[1:33:28] faith
[1:33:29] [Applause]
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:31] is that right
[1:33:33] yeah now think of this they shall be
[1:33:35] unto me
[1:33:37] my people
[1:33:39] and they shall teach no more every man
[1:33:42] his neighbor and every man his brother
[1:33:44] saying know the Lord for they shall all
[1:33:48] know me
[1:33:50] I like this this is out of Isaiah 2 Paul
[1:33:52] refers to it but from the least of them
[1:33:55] unto the greatest of them saith the Lord
[1:33:58] so don't matter what stature
[1:34:01] no matter what stature from the least to
[1:34:04] the greatest
[1:34:05] no matter who it is
[1:34:07] they all shall know me in the same way
[1:34:11] for I will forgive their iniquity and I
[1:34:16] will remember their sin no more
[1:34:21] now how do I think about this because
[1:34:23] you and I brother William
[1:34:25] not that I have anything in my mind I
[1:34:27] can't recall anything but let's just say
[1:34:29] you wronged me sometime all right or I
[1:34:31] wronged you however way you want to put
[1:34:32] it
[1:34:33] in my mind I have to receive the grace
[1:34:36] of God to overcome that
[1:34:39] right I have to receive the grace of God
[1:34:42] I'm going to have to pray quite a bit
[1:34:44] that don't happen that don't mean that I
[1:34:46] don't have the Holy Ghost I might have
[1:34:47] to really pray uh I'm gonna say God help
[1:34:50] me and you know I'm looking at
[1:34:52] everything but notice in with still
[1:34:54] within it all there's things sometimes
[1:34:56] that things could come back in my memory
[1:34:59] of brother William did this
[1:35:02] right
[1:35:03] there's things no matter how you and I
[1:35:05] forgive one another but you know I do
[1:35:07] believe this woman heart there is a
[1:35:09] forgiveness that where it can take the
[1:35:11] actual pain out you say how can you
[1:35:13] preach that because I'm a man that
[1:35:14] preaches by experience I'm not one who
[1:35:17] preaches by reading the word I'm a guy
[1:35:19] I'm one who knows the power of almighty
[1:35:23] God I am not asking you to do something
[1:35:25] that I haven't already experienced in my
[1:35:28] own life
[1:35:30] and sometimes the experiences are maybe
[1:35:32] even easier than what people have
[1:35:34] because I have to look at a whole group
[1:35:36] of people
[1:35:38] sometimes even in other localities where
[1:35:40] I'm at
[1:35:42] are you hearing me
[1:35:45] but this is what I'm saying
[1:35:47] God looks at me he looks at you when we
[1:35:51] have really when there has been that
[1:35:54] creation on the inside
[1:35:56] he says I don't even know
[1:35:59] you ever sinned
[1:36:01] how can that be
[1:36:04] it's got to be there's somebody
[1:36:06] different on the inside
[1:36:10] that's what the new birth does oh my you
[1:36:13] and I sometimes can look back in our
[1:36:14] lives and we struggle because what in
[1:36:17] our memories in our human Spirit we
[1:36:19] remember our failures we remember our
[1:36:22] Falls we remember our shortcomings but
[1:36:25] God is in looking on the Flesh on the
[1:36:27] spirit he's looking at the soul
[1:36:31] Hallelujah
[1:36:34] and he says your sin and iniquities I
[1:36:37] remember no more
[1:36:40] it ain't God sitting there saying I want
[1:36:42] to forget I want to forget I want to
[1:36:43] forget I want to forget I want to forget
[1:36:44] I want to forget I want to forget no
[1:36:49] it's a new creation
[1:36:52] who is it it's the same one that spoke
[1:36:56] through the whole through the prophet
[1:36:57] and said you never sinned in the first
[1:37:01] place
[1:37:06] I'll tell you that runs deeper than your
[1:37:08] nationalities
[1:37:09] that runs deeper than you know whatever
[1:37:11] that I am European this or you're this
[1:37:13] or you're that it runs deeper than my
[1:37:16] family tree it runs deeper than well I
[1:37:19] wasn't born the right way or or this
[1:37:20] happened it runs deeper than that
[1:37:24] I think of how that brother Jim Ed's
[1:37:26] wife sister Dalton she battled with that
[1:37:30] part about you know being born as an
[1:37:33] illegitimate child she dealt with that
[1:37:35] and and battled with them with a
[1:37:37] scripture and brother random I've got
[1:37:38] the picture of the handwritten note and
[1:37:40] brother Brandon wrote to Sister you
[1:37:41] heard him address in the message anyhow
[1:37:43] but he wrote to Sister Dalton because
[1:37:45] someone had brought it to brother Brown
[1:37:46] I'm in an interview and he wrote on that
[1:37:48] letter he said sister Dalton he said
[1:37:51] don't you worry about that anymore he
[1:37:53] said because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:56] it corrects it all
[1:38:01] Hallelujah
[1:38:03] that is the power of the blood of Jesus
[1:38:07] Christ
[1:38:08] [Applause]
[1:38:15] thank God for that Fountain that's open
[1:38:17] aren't you
[1:38:20] let me just try to move here just a
[1:38:21] moment here just a little bit further
[1:38:25] in the message why people are so tossed
[1:38:28] about
[1:38:31] trying to get down this quote for weeks
[1:38:33] now
[1:38:34] but I don't mean I'm going to go all the
[1:38:35] way through it
[1:38:37] but I'm talking about in the old times
[1:38:39] remember this is one of those messages
[1:38:41] why are people so tossed about a hidden
[1:38:43] life hidden life with Christ why some
[1:38:45] people can't live a Christian Life why
[1:38:47] things are up and down this is a bank of
[1:38:49] those messages just like that where
[1:38:51] brother Graham is dealing with it where
[1:38:52] people will come just to the outer court
[1:38:54] or they'll come just to the inner corn
[1:38:55] but never going all the way to a real
[1:38:58] christ-centered life
[1:39:01] now he says Ezekiel in the old times
[1:39:02] when the laws were put into the
[1:39:04] Tabernacle in the ark and he said
[1:39:06] Ezekiel you know he spoke of another
[1:39:07] time and he said there's two classes of
[1:39:09] people today them same classes that's
[1:39:12] trying to do something
[1:39:14] to save themselves each one says I'll go
[1:39:18] to church every Sunday
[1:39:20] it's very good I want to be religious
[1:39:22] that's very good that's still under a
[1:39:26] law
[1:39:27] but then the other by going to church
[1:39:30] and being good is not something
[1:39:34] that you do yourself
[1:39:36] it's something in you doing it for you
[1:39:39] the holy spirit in your heart
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:45] aren't you glad you got something
[1:39:46] greater on the inside when that old
[1:39:48] flesh says hey you know what
[1:39:49] take it easy tonight
[1:39:51] just sit back man and turn it on and you
[1:39:54] can just you'd be right a partaker
[1:39:57] oh boy we're getting right down there
[1:39:58] aren't we
[1:39:59] but see there's something about it it
[1:40:01] says no I've got a part
[1:40:04] it ain't just about me I've got a part
[1:40:06] maybe my a man's my lick of fire uniting
[1:40:10] with the rest of the body brings more of
[1:40:12] the godhead bodily present that's a
[1:40:15] direct quote so maybe me being there
[1:40:18] come on now could actually it'll invite
[1:40:21] the prince of God and somebody that
[1:40:23] needs Born Again somebody that needs
[1:40:25] delivered somebody that needs heal I am
[1:40:28] a part of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:40:35] oh
[1:40:38] God
[1:40:40] now notice this these people that live
[1:40:43] inside here now what he's talking about
[1:40:44] is inside the holies of holies they're
[1:40:46] always fed up that don't mean you know
[1:40:49] sometimes we say it especially
[1:40:50] Southerners I'm fed up well fed up don't
[1:40:52] mean you're full it means you're just
[1:40:54] I'm aggravated and what that means is is
[1:40:56] aggravate don't altogether mean mad it
[1:40:58] just means I'm just a little bit
[1:40:59] flustered and FL we go on and on and on
[1:41:01] you know it just has to keep going
[1:41:02] explaining that I think most you get it
[1:41:05] here but that don't mean fed up that's
[1:41:07] not what he's talking about he's talking
[1:41:09] about where the Manna itself a man of
[1:41:12] being a type of the Holy Ghost because
[1:41:14] at that manner only when it fell out
[1:41:16] here they had to go gather it and when
[1:41:18] they gathered it remember they had to
[1:41:20] consume it because if they didn't it
[1:41:22] would develop maggots
[1:41:24] now think of it where did that Manna
[1:41:26] come from that developed maggots
[1:41:28] Out of Heaven from God
[1:41:31] well why did it develop maggots because
[1:41:33] it wasn't in the right place
[1:41:35] but when the Manna was gathered and put
[1:41:38] in that golden Homer and been taken into
[1:41:40] the holiest of holies it didn't matter
[1:41:42] how many days went by it was still just
[1:41:46] as fresh as when it fell in the
[1:41:50] beginning
[1:41:52] why because it was the place where the
[1:41:55] Manna was at
[1:41:57] the Mana can fall on the flesh it'll
[1:42:00] become maggot eaten after so many times
[1:42:02] it can fall on the spirit I'm talking
[1:42:05] about the man of the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:07] it'll become maggot eaten why because
[1:42:09] it's not in the right place there is a
[1:42:12] place of preservation and that
[1:42:15] preservation is God's provided Homer
[1:42:17] where God has provided that seed on the
[1:42:20] inside that could Tabernacle deity and
[1:42:23] it's just as fresh it's just as powerful
[1:42:26] oh people say oh today brother Samuel
[1:42:28] there's all kinds of things going on in
[1:42:29] the world today and sin is so much worse
[1:42:31] but let me tell you something the devil
[1:42:34] has not gotten more power than God and
[1:42:37] God don't need another message
[1:42:41] this message has full power full
[1:42:44] Authority and full Glory we don't need
[1:42:47] another way we just need God's provided
[1:42:51] way
[1:42:51] [Applause]
[1:42:57] once it gets in there you see the
[1:42:59] Revival don't run out
[1:43:03] don't matter test don't matter trial
[1:43:05] don't matter if it's gloomy outside
[1:43:06] don't matter if that the lights go out
[1:43:10] in your spirit there's a Shekinah on the
[1:43:12] inside
[1:43:14] no matter how much the wind blows
[1:43:16] you can't blow out Shekinah because
[1:43:19] that's God it's God's own life and you
[1:43:22] say This Little Light of Mine I'm going
[1:43:24] to let it shine it's not a life that you
[1:43:26] live it's God that lived that life the
[1:43:28] same God that Lit the light on the altar
[1:43:29] is the same God that Lit the light in
[1:43:31] your soul it's the same fire of God that
[1:43:34] you're burning by you say brother Samuel
[1:43:35] how powerful is that I'll tell you how
[1:43:37] powerful it is when they came to drag
[1:43:39] Elijah out they sent 50 and what
[1:43:42] happened fire came out and consumed they
[1:43:44] sent another 50. fire came out and
[1:43:47] consuming the devil said come on out
[1:43:49] here come on out in Egypt and the token
[1:43:51] issues fire out get out of here devil
[1:43:55] I don't want nothing to do
[1:43:59] with Egypt
[1:44:06] oh it's getting cold oh
[1:44:09] I got a fire burning on the inside of me
[1:44:14] it's a Holy Fire
[1:44:17] it's your kind of Fire
[1:44:19] oh glory be to God as I go to keep
[1:44:21] feeding on that word and I'm seeing
[1:44:23] myself I'm seeing more and more of him
[1:44:25] what is it doing it's creating there a
[1:44:28] Dynamo on the inside oh brother Sammy
[1:44:30] it's getting so cold the trials against
[1:44:31] all what are you feeding on right I said
[1:44:35] what are you feeding on you must have
[1:44:37] junk wood you need to get some real wood
[1:44:41] you need to be feeding on the right
[1:44:43] kinds of Faith you can't expect to live
[1:44:45] a Victorious Life and feeding yourself
[1:44:47] on news and all the other sorts of junk
[1:44:50] you'll never live Victorious because the
[1:44:52] son of man don't care about Fox News the
[1:44:55] son of man don't care about ESPN the son
[1:44:58] of man only cares about the word
[1:45:02] and asking God oh help me Lord give me
[1:45:06] strength and you sucking down all sorts
[1:45:08] of things and praying and asking God for
[1:45:10] strength shame on you
[1:45:13] I said shame on you we have access to a
[1:45:17] full course meal
[1:45:20] Hallelujah Lord have mercy
[1:45:24] some things just kind of trickle out
[1:45:26] don't you if you think about it enough
[1:45:28] but God knows what he's doing don't
[1:45:31] say house on me help me Lord
[1:45:33] hey friends that the thing's very very
[1:45:35] simple very simple it can be a diet it
[1:45:37] can be things that maybe he isn't even
[1:45:39] named out right here but if you feel
[1:45:41] your life with all other sorts of things
[1:45:43] and don't give the word of God
[1:45:45] preeminence in time how do you expect to
[1:45:47] get any closer to God
[1:45:49] man
[1:45:52] let me finish on this
[1:45:55] the heart
[1:45:58] is the Abode of God next paragraph there
[1:46:01] the heart is the Abode of God and in the
[1:46:03] Old Testament God dwelt In His glory
[1:46:06] over the ark hard is the ark and God
[1:46:08] dwells not in the head in the heart
[1:46:10] God's not known by theology God's known
[1:46:13] by not known by mental conception God's
[1:46:16] known by an old-fashioned Sanctified
[1:46:18] born-again experience that's in the
[1:46:19] human heart
[1:46:20] yet men and women will live a good life
[1:46:22] love God by mental conception
[1:46:27] but the real hiding place is in the
[1:46:28] heart hid with Christ
[1:46:34] love God by mental care how do you know
[1:46:35] it's a mental conception because it's
[1:46:36] never expressed out here
[1:46:39] love God by mental because that oh no
[1:46:41] tell me I love God well then the love of
[1:46:43] God expresses itself
[1:46:46] because I just say it from my own life
[1:46:48] the love of God when it was expressed to
[1:46:49] me and what it did in my life it didn't
[1:46:51] leave me where he found me
[1:46:54] my mental capacity wore out a long time
[1:46:57] ago there's been a lot of things
[1:46:59] mentally as far as I said I don't think
[1:47:02] I can take another step
[1:47:04] but the love of God
[1:47:06] moves me
[1:47:09] are you hearing me now
[1:47:12] now let me end with this one
[1:47:14] because that's the real hiding place
[1:47:16] when Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:47:19] comes into
[1:47:21] your heart
[1:47:22] he is in you
[1:47:25] with your temperament
[1:47:29] oh Lord I want to be like brother
[1:47:31] so-and-so no God made you how he wanted
[1:47:34] you to be
[1:47:36] that don't include maybe all the scars
[1:47:38] and everything else but all of the hurts
[1:47:40] and everything else it's an opportunity
[1:47:42] for Jehovah Rapha to manifest his
[1:47:45] strength through your life
[1:47:47] because the testimony through your life
[1:47:49] will become a witness and a testimony to
[1:47:51] somebody else but he is in you with your
[1:47:55] temperament
[1:47:56] your temperament is your makeup is your
[1:47:58] disposition
[1:48:00] right
[1:48:01] it's just like him you took me and my
[1:48:02] brother joy and myself we're we're no
[1:48:04] doubt no doubt probably different within
[1:48:06] our temperament brother William and I
[1:48:08] and on and on we can go brother Shane
[1:48:09] and I we can go on and on no doubt we're
[1:48:11] different in our temperament so you know
[1:48:13] what that means that God never meant and
[1:48:16] said Samuel I want you to make shame
[1:48:18] like your temperament nor did he say
[1:48:19] Shane I want you to make Samuel like
[1:48:21] your temper because that guy's an odd
[1:48:22] dude man you need to know you see what
[1:48:24] we're doing we're fighting the wrong
[1:48:27] thing
[1:48:28] that's right
[1:48:30] so where's the real war at
[1:48:34] right here that God would have a group
[1:48:37] of people in a many-membered body
[1:48:39] different temperaments
[1:48:43] and no doubt if we said everybody bring
[1:48:45] pie to the fellowship one bring
[1:48:47] chocolate pie one bring this one bring
[1:48:49] that what are you bringing
[1:48:51] well I just thought everybody would like
[1:48:53] that I wonder why you thought everybody
[1:48:54] would like that
[1:48:56] because that happens to be your favorite
[1:49:01] well I'm going to bring French silk
[1:49:03] because I think everybody would like
[1:49:04] that
[1:49:07] let me tell you what everybody would
[1:49:08] like it's apple pie
[1:49:13] that thick with crust on both sides
[1:49:19] that's me
[1:49:21] you understand that's me that ain't the
[1:49:23] Holy Ghost that's me
[1:49:26] but notice Let me just let me Paul let
[1:49:28] me close with this when the Holy Spirit
[1:49:30] he comes into your heart
[1:49:33] he is in you with your temperament
[1:49:37] he's living his own life
[1:49:41] through his own will
[1:49:43] through you
[1:49:46] let me go down the next next quote there
[1:49:48] sister Brianna same message so yielded
[1:49:51] you are
[1:49:56] pink he thinks the kind of thoughts
[1:50:01] he would think
[1:50:02] through you
[1:50:05] how many has ever had to say Lord
[1:50:06] forgive me
[1:50:09] I've had some thoughts go through Lord
[1:50:11] forgive me where does that rise from he
[1:50:13] that's within you
[1:50:15] right it arises from he that's within
[1:50:18] you have you ever spoke some words that
[1:50:20] you said you know what Lord God forgive
[1:50:22] me for speaking those words why because
[1:50:24] Christ in you says those are not the
[1:50:26] words that I speak
[1:50:29] are you with me
[1:50:31] yeah right so there's there's another
[1:50:32] there's another control on the inside
[1:50:33] there's someone who's greater than well
[1:50:36] my daddy was like this and we were
[1:50:38] always like this and we were far
[1:50:40] how about stop bragging on that first
[1:50:42] birth
[1:50:44] and receive the new birth
[1:50:47] how about resting and leaning
[1:50:51] on understanding
[1:50:55] that's true I can't help certain traits
[1:50:58] but I do not intend to rest on them
[1:51:01] but the same you are Browning but my
[1:51:03] first identity is a son of God
[1:51:06] Browning is not my first identity
[1:51:10] a Son of God that just happened to live
[1:51:13] in a body that has it has the surname of
[1:51:16] Browning for what for God to manifest
[1:51:18] his glory through my life that he's an
[1:51:21] overcomer through every stream that's in
[1:51:23] the Browning family
[1:51:26] well you mean the brownings have strains
[1:51:28] just like you do
[1:51:31] dirty laundry just like you do thoughts
[1:51:34] just like you do
[1:51:40] he knows the kind of works he would do
[1:51:44] through you
[1:51:46] you are yielded and resting home what a
[1:51:48] beautiful picture a consecrated
[1:51:50] Christian yielded Christ working through
[1:51:53] you
[1:51:54] I know I keep asking for more can I read
[1:51:56] one scripture familiar scripture you
[1:51:58] know I love this scripture right here
[1:51:59] but watch how Paul words this in
[1:52:01] Galatians 2 20. we're familiar with this
[1:52:04] I
[1:52:05] am crucified
[1:52:08] with Christ
[1:52:12] nevertheless
[1:52:14] I live
[1:52:16] yet not I
[1:52:19] so there's a part of Paul that is
[1:52:24] crucified with Christ
[1:52:27] yielded
[1:52:29] dead to sin
[1:52:31] yet they can still look and say that's
[1:52:33] Paul remember some of them knew him as
[1:52:35] Saul of Tarsus
[1:52:37] remember even after his conversion they
[1:52:39] didn't want to give him a chance
[1:52:42] I know about this guy I remember this
[1:52:43] guy oh man I ran around where this guy
[1:52:45] was I knew what he was stay away from
[1:52:47] him he's a bad guy
[1:52:51] right
[1:52:55] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:52:58] but nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:53:02] Christ
[1:53:03] liveth
[1:53:05] in me
[1:53:07] and the life which I now live in the
[1:53:11] flesh in an incredible how Paul writes
[1:53:13] of himself as different from the flesh
[1:53:18] you know why because he recognizes
[1:53:21] Who I Really Am
[1:53:23] I'm a son and daughter of God
[1:53:27] Paul had all that upbringing all that
[1:53:29] teaching all that all those things but
[1:53:31] that's not who I really am
[1:53:34] because Paul could never gain dominion
[1:53:36] over himself
[1:53:39] by just that knowledge
[1:53:41] but the Dominion came through the
[1:53:44] revealing of the Son of God in his life
[1:53:48] the life which I now live in the flesh I
[1:53:51] live by the faith of the Son of God Who
[1:53:56] Loved Me and gave himself
[1:53:59] for me
[1:54:01] don't you love him
[1:54:03] just ran to skip on down to that and why
[1:54:05] we're not tossed about in paragraph 18
[1:54:07] too
[1:54:09] for to me is Christ for for me to live
[1:54:12] as Christ and to die is gain not me that
[1:54:14] liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in
[1:54:16] me Christ Living
[1:54:19] in the individual soul surrendered
[1:54:23] Christ speaks
[1:54:25] through the lips thanks through the mind
[1:54:29] sees through the eye read this next one
[1:54:32] with me
[1:54:33] acts through the temperament
[1:54:37] he doesn't step over it
[1:54:40] he acts through it
[1:54:44] Paul Andrew James Peter
[1:54:49] we're all different
[1:54:52] is that right
[1:54:54] but it was the same God manifested
[1:54:58] in their lives
[1:55:00] they didn't look alike they all didn't
[1:55:02] have the same even the way that maybe
[1:55:05] they would speak they would Minister
[1:55:07] they didn't have the same likes about
[1:55:09] things but there's one thing about it
[1:55:11] the nature of God in them
[1:55:15] projected the word through their life
[1:55:20] might have been a different color of
[1:55:22] garment but it still was a life that
[1:55:24] lined up with the word of God
[1:55:27] it's him
[1:55:29] acting through
[1:55:31] your temperament
[1:55:32] acting through my temperament
[1:55:35] but what's important is
[1:55:37] it's him it's got to be him
[1:55:42] and that requires the Paradox of the
[1:55:44] Holy Ghost
[1:55:46] the sparrow hits
[1:55:50] Hallelujah
[1:55:52] hallelujah how many want to be
[1:55:54] remembered in prayer this morning
[1:55:57] Heavenly Father
[1:56:00] Lord you know each of our needs
[1:56:04] Lord you come and you speak
[1:56:07] to us in such a personal way and
[1:56:10] you minister to our lives and to our
[1:56:12] needs Lord
[1:56:14] father
[1:56:15] I pray Lord here this morning Lord not
[1:56:17] only for those that's gathered those
[1:56:19] that will stream and hear it by way Lord
[1:56:22] archive I pray for each one Lord
[1:56:25] that God made Lord every heart and every
[1:56:28] life may they recognize the Lord if
[1:56:30] they've not come into that place Lord of
[1:56:32] a real
[1:56:33] real experience with you I pray that God
[1:56:35] that may they press on Lord may they
[1:56:38] press into that may they seek until that
[1:56:41] word Lord is made flesh in their life to
[1:56:44] where that there is a satisfying on the
[1:56:46] inside may they not look for Lord great
[1:56:49] Dynamic displays but may they surrender
[1:56:52] their heart Lord just in prayer and Lord
[1:56:54] just even in this moment just turning it
[1:56:57] Lord all over to you father may they
[1:57:00] seek for you Lord oh God to where every
[1:57:03] every part of the life Lord is now Lord
[1:57:06] in subjection Lord to where that that of
[1:57:09] the life of God on the inside there has
[1:57:11] been a transformation Lord that has
[1:57:13] taken place may may Lord God take a hold
[1:57:16] of that to realize that just as God was
[1:57:19] manifest in Christ just as God was has
[1:57:22] been manifested once again in the end
[1:57:25] time lord through the message of the
[1:57:27] hour that same God desires to manifest
[1:57:29] himself through their life Lord God in a
[1:57:32] very personal a way that he would be
[1:57:34] Jesus Christ on this plane and I pray
[1:57:37] Heavenly Father
[1:57:39] Lord God you know even behind perhaps
[1:57:41] some of those hands there's that request
[1:57:43] and Lord God
[1:57:45] no doubt Lord behind hands there's that
[1:57:47] desire as well this Lord
[1:57:49] help me Lord I pray
[1:57:51] God as a yielded vessel Lord
[1:57:54] the Lord where it's not me
[1:57:56] it's not me trying to act out but oh
[1:57:59] that the mind of Christ
[1:58:02] but have the preeminence in my life
[1:58:05] to let me Lord God yield
[1:58:07] of yielding myself to you Lord
[1:58:11] I find it Lord as I've studied you know
[1:58:13] Lord and looked at many of the things to
[1:58:15] where that God even your Prophet would
[1:58:17] call things out by the spirit of God and
[1:58:20] would reveal some of the very conditions
[1:58:22] and medical conditions in people's lives
[1:58:24] things they were dealing with and he
[1:58:27] would say your whole trouble
[1:58:29] has been your makeup
[1:58:31] your temperament
[1:58:33] Lord God it was not that you were going
[1:58:36] to come down and change their
[1:58:37] temperament
[1:58:39] but father to see how that Lord that
[1:58:42] that had been placed in their life
[1:58:44] certain things that was as it's to be
[1:58:46] yielded to you but Lord God it could
[1:58:48] work against him Lord
[1:58:51] Lord when it's not surrendered in the
[1:58:53] right way into the right hands
[1:58:56] help us Lord I pray father
[1:58:58] help us Lord God we just desire that
[1:59:01] Lord with all of our hearts Lord
[1:59:03] oh God that through our minds Lord God
[1:59:06] that it's your thoughts Lord
[1:59:08] father as we can identify many times
[1:59:10] Lord where we have to look and say oh
[1:59:12] Lord Jesus forgive me Lord for those
[1:59:15] them thoughts passing through words Lord
[1:59:18] that's been spoken
[1:59:19] but oh how thankful we are that God
[1:59:21] there is one on the Judgment seat of our
[1:59:24] heart Lord God
[1:59:25] thankful to where our sins
[1:59:29] are taken daily Lord
[1:59:31] Moment by moment Lord God
[1:59:34] father we thank you Lord for your mercy
[1:59:37] Lord
[1:59:38] thank you for the victory that Lord that
[1:59:40] you bring into our lives that dear God
[1:59:42] we're not just identified by a church
[1:59:44] we're not identified Lord God by what we
[1:59:47] subscribe to but Lord the greatest
[1:59:49] identification is by your presence in
[1:59:52] our lives the Lord as Sons and Daughters
[1:59:54] of God help us Lord to get out of the
[1:59:57] way as your Prophet could say it over
[1:59:59] and over through the message
[2:00:02] that if I can only get William Branham
[2:00:04] out of the way
[2:00:05] Jesus can have a good time
[2:00:08] he would say it again if I can only get
[2:00:10] William Branham out of the way he's my
[2:00:13] worst enemy
[2:00:14] then he said God can have his way
[2:00:17] Lord Jesus that's a daily Moment by
[2:00:22] moment walk for us as believers
[2:00:26] Lord
[2:00:27] we want it to be you acting through US
[2:00:29] Lord
[2:00:31] help us Lord I pray father
[2:00:34] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:00:36] amen
[2:00:38] don't you love him
[2:00:42] Hallelujah
[2:00:46] I think it becomes even more powerful
[2:00:48] that statement
[2:00:50] that the Lord spoke to her brother
[2:00:52] Trevor
[2:00:53] when he said he called out remember it
[2:00:55] was whoever's name you want to put in
[2:00:57] there
[2:00:57] but he said Jesus wants to be let's just
[2:01:00] say Paul
[2:01:02] but he wants to be Paul the way Jesus
[2:01:06] would be Paul Jesus wants to be Ryan but
[2:01:09] he wants to be rhymed the way Jesus
[2:01:11] would be Ryan
[2:01:14] now you know
[2:01:17] we can try to we can look at a drama you
[2:01:20] can look at it look at a script
[2:01:23] you know sometimes it'll tell you in
[2:01:24] little italicized words when you're
[2:01:26] doing a drama to maybe speak boldly or
[2:01:29] to or the front it'll tell you what you
[2:01:31] need to do here in order to actually
[2:01:34] project that
[2:01:37] but you know what God comes to do
[2:01:41] is he comes to live
[2:01:43] that part of the drama through you and I
