worship Lord to submit our lives Lord God you had come by your presence Lord just take your word Lord that we know and believe and are sure it is the inspired infallible Word of God we ask that Lord that you'll just come Lord here this morning a father grant Lord that these precious words and promises Lord Oh God that down through the ages many have received strength Lord from these verses of Scripture Oh father you've inspired Lord released inspiration for them in that moment that they would be able to stand Lord sometimes in their darkest hours Lord there were places in the word Lord that you inspired to them Lord they were ordained to that Lord God father we just pray and ask Lord that you would come by here this morning Lord for every need for every heart Lord for every request Lord for every life Lord and I pray O God that may your word just be so inspired and quickened Lord to us Lord may we be quickened to it O God Lord Jesus we pray this morning Lord as we lift up Lord

God may you be clearly set forth Lord evident Lord father before each of our hearts and lives Lord once again this morning Lord we know Lord God that you are the answer for every need for every situation Lord Oh God may our thoughts may our hearts be open more sensitive Lord your leadership with we thank you lord we ask it in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll turn with me to Psalms 118 [Music] we're just going to begin reading at verse 19 open to me the gate of righteousness I will go in I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou has heard me and I'll become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous I'd like to just take a little thought here just title it raised up ready for rapture raised up and ready for wrap may God bless you bless the word as you're being seated just want to just speak to here just a few moments before I go into the text here I want to say that I wanted to be able to somebody you knew with the trip that I just had here up in Connecticut and that trip that that kind of came up after there'd been some other meetings that I had already got led on my heart to go ahead and take and the the burden within that particular taking that and going there in Connecticut they the I wanted to make known so that you you are a part when if I'm not here I'm going somewhere else I'm counting on your prayers when when when I'm out the ministry and the Lord certainly knows my heart if all I did was stay at home I would be a happy man but the the burden was there where the pastor that was there with that assembly left a message and walked away from it and so the the burden there's ministry that has been going in there and we just had on a heart just to pray for him and then I was received a call about coming up and ministering to them and so we went there this the past weekend and just to minister to them and I bring this to you if you just would keep them in prayer they are there praying that the Lord would send a pastor to them I know they have a few brothers that they're praying about and there were things that I was able to set down and some of the ways I took when I ministered felt let on my heart even an opening there on the first night just to kind of speak to them on where do we go from here and to really be focused where to be focused on and I had i titled a message the focus of the hour and dealt with how that the enemy and bring distractions to you that can trouble you and want to remove from you the focus of the hour and I I just have placed it to him like this I said you know you know me with examples of food I said it's like this if I invite you to my house you know I'm gonna have my wife cook something that I like I'm not gonna invite you and have her cook something that I don't like I said so if I invite you to my house and you decide not to come oh well I'm gonna eat anyhow that just means it more from me and and I say that in the manner it's sad to wear when there are lives and hearts that if for them they have made their choice and they go in their way but the thing that I was leading dealing with the Spirit of God is don't allow any bitterness to set in in your heart don't be focused on on that on the person who left or those who's left don't even focus on what's been said they focused on the objective and that is the rapture that's the coming of the Lord remain focused on that because you know the thing is is that we walk on with the Lord and and we are in times that truly are our times that show forth of maturity in the hour we're living in where all seeds are truly coming to maturity and within this hour where we see things that are are coming about it's only also how we witness that God steps forth in the hour and make this word even that much more real and so you know I I mentioned them I said you know we don't dislike anybody we don't hate anybody but if a person chooses and this is the pathway that they choose to go they can go ahead and go that way we walk on with the Lord and that's the focus of the hour is to stay focused and don't become distracted by accusations don't become distracted even to where your attitude your objective your mind your spirit anything is affected let your focus be on Jesus Christ and the focus with being upon him is letting this word be so thoroughly applied in our lives each and every day and so the people were really encouraged with that and then we we just spoke on another thought there on on Sunday morning when I dealt with the progenitor of the seed and dealt with the seed life and how that it's the image of the Father and how that it is the fathering of of children and how that we indeed are the children of God and that you know I was basing with things when brother Branham wouldn't be on the curtain of time he said are these all Brennan and what did they what did the angel the Lord say no these are your conference you know it's not you we weren't we haven't been earthly father it's been our Heavenly Father come through the word that has brought birth in our lives so we bear the reflection and image of Jesus Christ and so we dealt with those with those things and of the assurance and just the boldness which Paul spake to adhere and walk in what God had given him so we were dealing with a lot of those things and you know what's wonderful how the Word of God just keeps open and they're wonderful even in the meth ings sometimes that you you don't even realize or you're in the midst of it and things are being spoken even then and gods dealing with things even then that it's just the it continues to open the picture doesn't become more fragmented the picture becomes more clear because the the message is not just just parts and pieces is it's a person and so it's an entire picture and you know for just to have one part of the puzzle is not to have the puzzle is to have just one part and you're only seeing one person you're only seeing one perspective one part but it's to have the entirety of it and what's most important is is having him who is the picture because he'll guide everything that needs to come together things sometimes look like shades come together all this red shade looks like this comes for this tree here and then you get it up there those those pieces aren't fitting the shades we might have seen it with your eye but God knows exactly where every piece goes and that's the that's the comfort that we have in the Lord so I just I just ask that you would just continue to keep them in prayer and I wanted to share that with you because I didn't get a chance to mention it to all some knew for some time that I was going there just a minister to them and to that need that's there and so just keep those brothers and sisters in prayer if you would there from Connecticut let's look here into the word I love the word of God don't you it's more rich and more precious with each and every every everyday in every moment David here when we look in the scripture these the Psalms here David speaks of the gates of righteousness in the very first verse and he says I will go in to them this in verse 20 this gate of the Lord so we know that even when we look in terms of gates within the scripture that gates are are meant to give access but it's not if if gates themselves are just simply without restriction then they're not much of a gate they're more decorative and we know that that the Word of God is not decorative but the Word of God there is truly a provided way that we can walk in and we can come in to God's desired place for our lives and it has to be him to minister that place for us otherwise we're looking at how what angle how do I come in to enter this place and we see that even in the Tabernacle in the wilderness there was but one gate there was but one doorway you you just couldn't come in in any other way when you think of it a person could a person have climbed over the wall they could have but it was not God's way God has a way and what it is is that it's not if God doesn't leave it up to us to try to find out what is that way but God's desire and this shows God's heart and his desire is he wants our fellowship so deeply that not only has he made away but he comes down to show us that way and not just show us that way but comes down to guide us in that way that's showing God's heart and God's desires so David is speaking here that this gate of the righteousness now he's asking open this gate of right gates of righteousness unto me so there's a desire and if David is speaking in this manner and we believe with all of our heart this is the Spirit of Christ in David because these scriptures are in truly the inspired Word of God this is not David's thinking when we're reading of these things here in the scriptures we realize that it is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and if David is speaking open to me the gates of righteousness even to have that request that desire there's something within David that is longing to be in that place and so because there's something within him longing to be in that place he has received something in his life that he could even say open to me he's not approaching something without confidence he has a confidence that those gates of righteousness aren't too open for him but like anything in the economy of God it comes where God deals with our hearts everything that is there for us but it's up to us to take what God has given to us you make it you have to make it your own recognize that yet of all the course of a service when the presence of God comes by with his word when that word is being made a lot no matter how the amount of people that are gathered there when you sense that in your heart you take that very personal that's God confirming his promise for me in my life and you can just at that time say Lord open to me Lord God open to me Lord Jesus so here David is is walking truly in this in this time there's his revelation that has struck in David's heart that he's longing for an entrance into this place and if you notice as we're saying the gates are are given for access for privilege that even when we recognize it clear back in the scripture that Israel all of Israel knew of the appropriate sacrifices they knew of those things but God gave out in his word before they ever came into the land God let it be known there are going to be a distinct place where I'm going to place my name and God said that where he's placed his name that you are to seek after this habitation my dwelling place and it's in that gate where you are to worship where you are to offer the Passover lamb were you to be identified in all of Israel worse to come to that place and a designated time of the year now we also know that undoubtedly that there were some who did not see the significance of worshipping in that place they offered the lamb they had the same if we can say substance that others had it wasn't in them you I hope you understand I'm saying you could not look down on them and say oh you know why aren't you doing this the whole economy of God is that you know if that is not in the heart of an individual no matter how frustrated you are no matter how much you look at and say they ought to be like this be careful be careful that you're not just looking at something and it's taking you away from worship because remember your strength to help them depends on your unity with Christ Abraham would have had no power to release a lot unless he was first separated from lot that's a message on its own he's trying to help family but you have to be yielded and United with Christ in all areas Tyrus before you can help your family the right a separated life it releases the authority and power of God in your life because you're able and not tied down and hindered by things you're free and if you're free then you're able to minister freedom you're able to stand and minister a word of reconciliation is that right so the gate but there were there were those and and and you know even in the whole of Israel think of how many think of how many when the Lord Jesus was here was going to Jerusalem because it moved from Shiloh to Jerusalem showing that those cities listen to me now those cities on the earth they were not the D what God Himself had in his mind as the final resting place they were only places that were temporarily where God had designated and they would speak of the very food nosov Almighty God they're right we've seen that with Shiloh corruptions that's in Jerusalem were corruption sets in but in Christ there is no corruption that's why I real true experience with God there's no corruption in a true experience of God because Christ can not corrupt Christ has no yes because he had no beginning the gate where he chose to place his name many as the Prophet tells us were coming to worship in Jerusalem many were coming to have the Passover he said but only a few we're having it with him notice how it changed so quickly there were many who were who were looking and and and looking throughout the time and through the ages but notice how it narrowed down to such a small minority when he came in his fullness when the transition was coming it narrowed down why it's a headstone time it's a Keystone time it's capstone time all through the Old Testament there are two too precious promises that they were looking for they were looking for the coming of the Messiah in Redemption and they were looking for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost because they knew it was a witness to them that live the life of them that Redeemer his life coming to us that speaks that we are in the redemption that we are identified and so it was a witness and in their lives not something that fathers had explained but whom God had revealed to them that this life and who they really were same way in this in the time that even we're living in we see it down through the the the New Testament where it is spoken that Paul would even have the sounding out as that first messenger Peter look at all of them that are born by the Spirit of God the the resonating call within their heart is for the second coming of the Lord that's what the believers down through time live for Miss a like this it's because of the of the climax of the first coming which is the seal of the Holy Ghost it threw them into a place to where they were looking for the second coming of the Lord the Prophet tells us they went down to the grave running and when they're raised back up they come right back up running they didn't they they didn't come to a place of retirement and I can say spiritually I don't want to trouble some of you that are retired they never retired spiritually they kept pressing that that was the goal that was the desire that's what kept him going when there when when every text and trial would come their way it was that within them that's maquette them moving on brother and sister that's the reality within our lives because you realize the second coming is not something out here the second coming is in you yes sir it's God Himself coming that has claimed you and His Word is calling you out of this world his second coming is a claiming it second coming is coming to redeem what he had purchased is that right it's which it's what they live for they're like it's saying like this very plainly it's what made them tick it's what caused them to say they've make this choice about a job or that choice about a job you see you see what I'm saying it was there because this Paul said Christ who is our life it's what means what it's what we what motivated because he was the absolute of their life that's what they're living for that's what we've always got to be mindful that's why the word listen friends it's very important that we're staying in the word and you're staying in prayer it's important that were under live ministry it's important because the Spirit of God comes back and the Holy Ghost comes back brings discernment and we're not what it's not the new message for the RAM said say what I say it's the same holy ghost that game that word inspired it it brings it down to where you can look at it and you would say my goodness it says don't brother random was living here it's not brother branham it is he which once were chance and which is to come is the same angel the Lord the same mighty angel that is here amen the church is not devoid of angels the church is not devoid of the angel of the Lord the age of the Lord is still here hey he is the man that had clothed in fine linen he is the son of man the Word made flesh he is a sealing angel hallelujah hallelujah what a comfort we have in this hour glory be to God hallelujah so in David his speaks to this and I saved the clothes in our lives you know God knew we were gonna live in this time he knew this he knew the conditions of this age God knew it and God has provided that even by virtue of the seed that is within you which is the housing of his own life but that seed when it's quickened by his quickening power it raises up that is greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world [Applause] that's why John never had to write out a list of sin he never had to write out a list of thing whosoever is born of God overcometh the world even our faith notice David said open to me the gates of righteousness I want to mention here this this point very to me a very tremendous statement the brother branham makes in Makassar dick the great prince and king he said there's three elements that a man follows first is humanistic second is divine revelation third a vision that's thus saith the Lord many times we are down in here and never climb into this if you're not down in there cast your hopes through that veil up here - thus saith the Lord now notice cast your hopes through that veil up here - thus saith the Lord here's David standing here open to me the gates of righteousness what's David doing he's casting he's casting his hopes through that veil appear - thus saith the Lord hopes not a bad thing as long as it has the leadership of faith faith and hope a husband and wife I'm not gonna preach on that today it's wonderful it's a if it's united correctly they're right faith is a big burly guy hope is a timid you both say you don't know my wife [Laughter] but what has to join the two together love right that's a separate message though you don't see the vision though the revelation doesn't come but when you're praying for you say I just wish I could believe that doesn't make any difference how won't you listen his council cast your anchor down there and call it so anyhow but saying I would believe it God revealed it to me though you don't see the vision though the revelation doesn't come though when you're praying for you say I just wished I could believe that doesn't make any difference you know if this is this is a prophetic eye that's separating you from you hey man it is letting you know that your mind is not your strength that I am your strength I have confirmed the wire to you you know you're one of my children so what do you do cast your hopes cast your hopes through the veil there and say God has said it the devil can say hadn't been revealed to you yet well you haven't seen a vision about it yet but God said it hallelujah and the Prophet tells us in the message perfect faith he said when God he said even a vision that can speak he said but what God has said here is more sure than the vision because the vision cannot speak contrary to the word amen what does it do what's the whole ministry is to put faith in the word that God keeps his word and to claim that word for our own hallelujah signs and wonders in the ministry all those things are but none even when God will pass far away a miracle and things are done in your life what is that to do just take your life faith sometimes we need a jumpstart well said no I don't when they come up here and pray for you get that line clogged off of you it's shorting out everything when the end we need that for them I'm not talking about an up-and-down life I'm not talking about a life without victory you know better than that I'm talking about to where the Word of God when it's coming down and moving in our life there are times where the Spirit of God we need that alignment in our lives Paul said I want die daily part of our recharging is dining daily some of you get that one tomorrow but watch this the Scriptures notice how in the book of Hebrews it speaks to the believers Penant identifies as Pilgrims and strangers they were aware of this city if you're a pilgrim and a stranger it speaks that you're not a resident of that place where you are my brother can attest to this right brother Bill's over the different ones they said you go to some of the places that checkpoints and them in airports and things like that and they said and they can tell you things in I can tell you from America why Bill Simmons because you're white or whatever more more white people than just in America you know hey you know the reason they say that because you walk proud now don't take it wrong I'm not gonna start crawling how I'm not talking about false humility but you see it's something that they can kind of tell it's just like this you know sometimes when you're over we lived over in Sandusky and you'd see people coming down the road from a distance I don't know their face I can't see him I don't know if they're from here or not but I start seeing and walking around with backpacks I know foreigner because we don't walk around with backpacks here and carrying bags around behind us and walking into malls and doing shopping but bags behind us like this suitcases I know they're either European or from some other country I know that just by looking I don't have to ask them I know their manner gives them away that's why the token is not what we talked about the token is to be on display at all times the Bible didn't say they called themselves Christians it says that's what they were called first at Antioch if it was their life is that right so pilgrims and strangers it's that life that has moved into them to where Abraham and the rest were walking and among here within this life but God moves upon the hearts and they recognize this is not the world that I am of so they begin to move in separation from that world this is where the scripture says in Hebrews 11:10 for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God this was not speaking of an earthly City Abraham met the king and priest of this city that's what through Abraham into a place of looking for the city Abraham listen now Abraham spiritual he's not looking for something upon this earth it is something that he's moved that he's looking beyond this earthly realm but he recognizes after meeting God in this manner he recognized that he can come and appear at any moment he recognizes there's a place that's more real than this place and he's looking for it his life declares he's looking for something you know you come in your house your wife your husband or somebody you know what you looking for you waiting for I can't find this sir I can't find that honey you know where my keys are at honey you know where this honey you know I'm looking there's something that you now belongs to you you're looking for it there was something that registered in Abraham's heart this same something registered in every son and daughter of Abraham and this same thing registers in the heart of every son and daughter of Abraham this day a city notice a city a city looking for a city because when he revealed himself notice how Paul takes this let me let me just read this real quick this is it beautiful I love this Hebrews chapter 7 verse 1 you see it's evident if we look from Genesis 14 then we go to Hebrews 7 it's evident it's not an earthly Salem or Jerusalem but it's another it's that which is true notice how Paul brings this verse 1 for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all-first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace notice how Paul notice look at these eyes that are looking in here he establishes first he's known as king of righteousness this is Ali's non-first yet in the scripture it does not say a rightness as king of Salem back in Genesis 14 18 but a prophetic eye recognizes this is he who is righteousness he will never have father mother beginning or ending of days this is not self-made righteousness this is not somebody who's made them self righteous this is he who is righteous altogether amen he reveals himself that he is the very righteousness of God and it's imperative first being right so first interpreted as being team of righteousness he's not a product of he is the very fountain of righteousness he's the very faction of life he's not a product of PC is the very fountain he is king of Salem he is king of peace you can't have peace without having righteousness is that right there is no peace without righteousness but when you receive the righteousness of God or and let me say the righteousness of God when you've recognized it and it moves to receive you into it by the Holy Ghost then you have peace and who do you have reigning in your life the king of righteousness and the king of peace because he gave something to Abraham what Abraham needed bread and wine is that right he steps forward after the great battle of Calvary and his giving of his own substance he's so nice on the return from the battle and he's imparting this he's giving it to Abraham I tell you that I love this person it's hard for me to just not move on I love this place and Scripture I love all Scripture I I feel like you know when you read in psalm 118 I was reading a little part where Martin Luther said I love all the scripture he said but this song right here Psalms 118 has been my greatest encouragement when I've been locked up he said when Kings and everything else have stood against me I have Rick came back and read this scripture found comfort from the Word of God we look at this here with Melchizedek he's revealing himself before Abraham gets back home and he's letting it this is very clear it is not I he's not the king of just a bit actually Jerusalem but it is the king of love that Jerusalem which the Scriptures speak to us it's that holy city of God that New Jerusalem all those others were it was in type and shadow and prefigure and and truly here God will move down even in that time and dwelling coming upon that part of land but remember it is that holy city that New Jerusalem and within that city there are delegates that already know a delegate to a city on a council or whatever more is an elected position is that right you just can't walk in you better not walk into your local council mean and say hi by the way I've gotten a secret agenda here they'll escort you out is that right where's your wedding garment where's your token who gave you the authority well I'm part of the city but there's a way to come in the votes were already cast on our behalf we were already elected chosen for deigned and God God has brought us into this place listen now by the Spirit of God dwelling in our lives it brings us to a place to where we live now as if we were there we live now as if we were already in that city why because it's the character of that life that so changes it Orient's our lives to where it sets the order in us to match the order of that city now watch how that this great parallel of the resurrection and coming into the place of looking at the fault now raised up and ready for rapture resurrection precedes the rapture and we realized that the resurrection precedes the rapture let's look at her here just a little bit in Matthew 27 verse 51 this is the place that the Prophet would would read from here and the message the rapture I'm not going to read the entirety of it but I'll just refer to just these three first three verses and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake in the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose I'll tell you that that word slept has become more precious to me it has it's become more precious to me day after day after day it just it stands out just like a billboard in the midst of the Scriptures sleeping they're resting they're waiting they're enjoying themselves right now but they are waiting they're arresting they're not dead they're just sleeping Oh Maude hmm and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many you see didn't notice it didn't say when they came out of the graves they went all over Israel and said they went into the holy city in that day they were living and walking in the place that God ordained for them to be in so when it came time for the resurrection supporting their life death does not change you buddy with me that doesn't change you when they were raised up out of the grave they went right into the holy a blue-ray then they knew where to go I want you to see how that the Spirit of God because we're not just we don't look at this book as the Bible as a book just of history it's a book of prophecy we know that the events that are laid out there clearly idiots of prophesy and it's the same spirit of God that makes real what he has prophesied and he confirms to you and I that when I portrayed this or when I spoke this you were in my thinking the parallel right here this resurrection that we've been dealing with for months this time it's a parallel of the rapture Jesus here after descending down taking the sin depositing coming back up he comes and is upon the earth for 40 days there right but he's only with his elect for 40 days it's all right it's a parallel the rapture because he was buried and raised first there right many scriptures come to your mind in your heart as a Bible reader he's the firstfruits of all those that slept when he came sleeping time was over glory be to God hard to keep still here they were resting in the promise they were sleeping they were resting in the promise when they laid down their lives they were resting in the promise even though to them may be the clarity I'm now gonna say one reveal because we know it was revealed by faith how can it be how can it be without revelation and then faith it has to be that part that is revealed to them that is necessary for the hour they're living in because God reveals what's necessary and needed for the hour we're living in and what he reveals is himself his life so that it is him receiving glory unto himself because it's him that's doing the work is that right he gives you an either strength to stand in the hour where we're to stand the Hebrew children this is an example we read they could have lived in the realm of humanistic but there was not revealed to them what God was going to do in the furnace they did see a vision now listen to me what if their faith now I want you to think of this very clearly what if their faith was only only based on Lord you're gonna have to reveal to me what's gonna happen in this fiery furnace first of all we've got it wrong you don't have to do in it he don't owe us nothing no you're gonna have to show me a vision maybe God wants us to walk by hey trusting him you know what I'm talking about sometimes there's been things in your life that's just been as clear as the mayonnaise on a bologna sandwich and then there's other times when there's things has just not been clear at all and you almost have what I trust Lord and you know it's you know I don't want to say fear but you're in a place because you realize how great it is to be in God's wheel how important it is to be in the will of God do you realize that can you End us and put you in desperation what is that that's not unbelief that you sing Lord I want my steps to claim your Lord I want you to be pleased you are your consideration is of him of his work and not of your wants so we were looking at this here the Hebrew children they come instead they come and say listen we don't know if God's gonna deliver us or not we don't know if our God's gonna deliver how can you stand with faith they were standing in who they knew God was to them and who they were having done all to stand stand when I stand on stand on who God has said you are well you don't know how to stand like shamrock Shangaan didn't know exactly what to do but he reached back and he realized I'm a son of Abraham he felt that covenant it's like when Samson was talh think about it all of the demons that were gathered around him and said you can't rise up you can't be restored you can't have this but Samson he got to sensing that those locks had broke back out oh my head come into that place and he said Lord just once more he called for a land not a big growth something of theology he called for simplicity what was the lad it was a tight there even of the lamb leading the dad leading moving into that place of the pillars the right they cast their hopes in the vaillar the simplicity of a life to walk back into that I listen friends I'll tell you very clearly I would love to have every single time that everything is such a clear revelation that lays out every part and you can sitting there well yeah I'm gonna go here today but God's already told me what's gonna happen so we're gonna go ahead and go through with it you know we would lack such faith in such trust you know what we'd end up doing well I know how this is gonna come out anyhow I wonder what brother so-and-so is doing whereas when we don't know the exact outcome sometimes our hearts thought comes in it Lord you're my feet about that time then you get a text I'm praying for you brother yeah thank you think I need that prayer right now well we're at a time of Prayer well let's get back here the Scripture speaks of the victorious March home but I want to just I'm gonna skip those scriptures we'll get to those the next time I want to go right into the message the rapture brother ram takes us here he says if you read in Matthew 18 16 there is three that bear record first John 5:7 so forth three is always a witness it's a verification something that's right it's three witnesses bear in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now notice we've had three witnesses three is a witness now we have already had three raptures in the Old Testament did you know that as a witness watch Enoch was one Elijah was the other one and Jesus was the other one Jesus being the Keystone now he bear record he was the keystone between the old and new Testament because he had to first die and then rapture he died come to life and walked around here with us and then was raptured up because he was the keystone that tied the two together after his resurrection and rapture notice Jesus had a resurrection and after his resurrection he was raptured after he didn't prove that the Old Testament there we all know that Enoch was translated we know Elijah was taken in by world and then right in a chariot of fire and Jesus died buried rose up and lived here on earth then was raptured to Keystone let me read that one more time whew I love it when he comes by like that I might have had it highlighted here but he came by with some different ink and Jesus died buried and rose up and lived here on earth and Dan was raptured up the Keystone that is the hole of a life of a believer we must die to ourselves he was seen except the seat fall in the ground and die in luck and Barrett hit Vytas alone but as his death base died its buried but once it's better he can be raised up again and when he was raised up he walked around here on earth in a resurrected condition and you who were once dead in sin and trespasses half he quickened resurrected not this yet yes this gets it at the rapture but right now on the inside it's gotta be a resurrection it's gotta be raised up so you're ready for rapture what's Jesus doing hey the wife is a reflection of the husband he's given the reflection of his wife the works that I do shall she do also hallelujah oh my oh he goes on to say he says one rapture is past three has happened in the Old Testament of them prepared who the word of the Lord come to the word of the Lord came to Enoch the word of the Lord came to Elijah his prophet the word of the Lord was Jesus notice the word of the Lord was coming to them but he came a time when the word of the Lord Himself came personally not just a part but the fullness of who he was and when he came in his fullness that is a keystone that is a time of transition that is transitioning from all to the new that is a time of transition exodus out of the church age and into the bride age it's a time of transition exodus out of this world who is the key he is the key the key he who the builders have said it not all along God exalted and he hath made the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes black Peter said he to us this capstone this headstock is most precious oh yes sir we're not just talking about a thought he is most precious because he has ransomed us can I go on watching the Old Testament them Old Testament Saints now when this rapture first taken place his loud voice awakened the Old Testament Saints just exactly like the loud voice it waken Lazarus the loud voice awakened the libram goes into first Thessalonians chapter 4 let me continue to read here the Old Testament Saints has gone into his presence paradise is done away Abraham's bosom those who were waiting and resting in the promise that were walking under the same inspiration that God had given to Abraham it wasn't because that they were flesh of Abraham because remember Esau could look back and say Abraham is my great-great grandfather so it wasn't my flesh paul establish it's not children of the flesh that are the promise but it's the children of the promise so when God was speaking the word to Abraham it was God's promise God's thought God's provision and noticed this they were waiting they'll just keep that in mind here they are they're waiting they're resting they're waiting in Paradise they've been offering up the lamb they are resting with a perfect confidence that he's coming and the Old Testament Saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and give up the ghost because why the sacrifice the perpetuation of their sins that they had waited on believing that perfect lamb was coming they had offered the sacrifice the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with the loud voice and the Old Testament Saints awoke watch the shout and the voiceover hear the same thing at his coming yielded up the ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect and paradise emptied out and the Old Testament Saints came to the earth again and walked around on earth and entered in with him at his rapture so on Calvary the scriptures as it speaks to us in Matthew 27 I believe it's verse 45 we needed yielded up the ghost he cried with a loud voice it is finished they who were there in paradise they heard that voice when the sender was at the natural voice I don't know but I do know this and can stand very firm on this what they did here was the spiritual voice of God issuing out at the fulfillment of the word hey man that was that voice that they heard there was something they knew this is the fulfillment it's like when you're inviting somebody to your house you hear a card pull up and you look out and you go yes you come to the window oh no it's nothing you go sit back down you don't stay here another car neighbors you're doing that because you're expecting one when that when his voice when it sounded up but lost his voice hitless that was the fulfillment of prophecy I'm telling you he closed them all to get up and begin to look through the door I don't know how they all seen through but they all seen through you're just like they had their place in the world they knew exactly where to be standing because why they knew this is the fulfillment one they had waited on one they had long gone they were gathered around said hey we're getting out of here today it's time to go it's time to leave hey man Daniel said there he is there's that rock Ezekiel today is the wheel in the middle of whale day he was identified what he was to them and that day he still was to them and so much more amen glory be to God that voice raised something up within them and the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout he had descended with a shaft a message hey man is not listen it's not a natural voice it's God's voice there is to me we could hear the natural voice and not hear God's voice but it's hearing God's voice and God's voice that's his voice his spirit that still has it speaking what does it do it assembles his children not to agree not to a dogma not to a personality not to a church he'd assembled his children unto himself this is the scripture in the dispensation of the fullness of times he shall gather all things together unto himself both things are in heaven and things are in earth this is a time full reconciliation there right not just reconciling here on earth but it's reconciling and bringing all things together he who is the supreme sacrifice who shed his blood who gave his life for ransom who laid down his life for his wife has been collecting his thoughts down through the ages and the shout has gone forth shout together the people unto himself it gathers you that voice it draws you out of barriers that were set up in denominations is that right what was it it was something you heard that had a greater hold and meaning to you a stronger tie then no matter how long you had been your parents and generations being in a certain church or a certain thing it was something that had a greater call because there was a genealogy that you're a part of that goes way deeper that was before there was angels star the smaller so here as a people raised up the Lord Himself is not a part this is the Lord Himself he who went to minister behind the veil has come out to declare in this our full justification to declare that what was him behind the veil and you were hearing the tingling tingling but now he worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive riches glory honor and power who is it that is declaring that you you and me are declaring that we are witnesses in that he is the astronaut that we are seated in is that right so they without us should not be made perfect they couldn't go anywhere without us because I'm a part I'm a part you're a part is that right it couldn't go but now when that word has that word is having its way in our life remember as the Prophet speaks to us power residing and moving into the bride of Jesus Christ that'll draw those what is that that's that voice but it's not me or you going out to the grave and saying rise up it's the sounding of prophecy in us it's walking in that word just as him he when that word was fulfilled it resonated down through there and they knew this is the time this is the time this is the moment all right so we know this to be this Holy Ghost the Prophet makes it very clear and the rising in the Sun he says this coming of the Holy Ghost is the abstract to the title deed this is not just a portion this is the Lord Himself this is not just a dip this is the very the fullness of God coming down moving right among us what's he doing he himself does lean out his word down through the ages he's not come with just aim one revelation one mystery this is the tang of all loose ends unto himself hey man he is assembling all things unto himself he men and the Holy Spirit coming down in the abstract they mend the form of the world what does it do it's taking away every claim and every hole that the enemy ever had upon your life hey man that's the coming of the Holy Ghost it's breaking away every claim what does it do so Satan no longer has a voice he no longer has the voice in revelations finds no voice what was he is he speak this mighty angel as a lion what's his pride hey man and we know his voice there already been a god hallelujah it's an abstract there's nothing can rise against this title in a previous age Satan could arose and said you can't go cuz you got my water baptism they're right Satan had things he could he could enforce and say the titles not fully cleaned and cleaned and cleared but the Holy Ghost coming 30 years the deed making it real making it live restoring what was lost clearing out things that we're you know people look at me they could argue dis bait and presume and flats and whatever more but the Holy Spirit Himself the fullness we're not in this debating when I'm in this fussing that's not how God works God comes down and he personally vindicates with his presence he comes down and confirms his word and makes it real and alive by projecting it and moving in our lives amen were not under theology this is the very presence of the Living God that's changing you and I creating within us a faith to move we call this the earnest the right the Scriptures speak this is the earnest and the earnest is your assurance yes sir it's not you putting down downpayment God gave you the downpayment God said this is the deposit to let you know that where you are from and when you know where you're from you know where you're going hallelujah what's he doing he's more removing all the obstacles how is he removing all the obstacles by showing you who you are that's how God deals with sin by revealing himself to you and revealing who you are that's how he deals with sin they men by his presence it's person coming and dealing in our lives moving in our lives revealing himself personally upon this revelation of who he is I'll build my church and the gates of hell this is that lively hope that Peter spoke of he hath begotten us into a lively hope is that right oh my that's why Paul could say if this same spirit that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal body identifying this scripture that that is and was for you this is why when you have received the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost has received you you have been raised up and you're ready for rapture like to walk me all aboard there's no big eyes a little use from we're all the same class refreshments are coming down the cabin though they be to God hallelujah Oman in who is this Melchizedek let me read this in closing all he says you women you claiming you got the Holy Ghost and going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the Spirit of God and you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be so certainly it can be he's not a filthy spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or quickened hallelujah made alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question who and what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started hey man raised up ready for rapture it was one subject to sin and mire and corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heaven not turn to a church that's wonderful friends if you're realizing God's dealing with your life and you're coming here send him the word but remember I'm telling you this in the name of the Lord that it's not right so ready you have got to move in and come under the blood Amen it's got to be where your life is hidden away in under the blood and listen that's the call of the hour get under the blood it's not enough to know about the message it's not enough to know it's the truth you have got to become one with it and don't set your sights or nobody else you set your sights on Jesus Christ that's right if you're living your life by looking at somebody else they do this so I might be able to do this you need to be turned heavenly people are not your example Jesus Christ here's our example cuz you get going one way and you think well so-and-so doing this it might be alright God might have dealt with their heart and they're no longer doing some of those things and you're continuing on as though it's been approved whoa pastored back turned heavenly turned heavenly that's what the Holy Ghost does in you he turns you heavenly oh ha Trump does this whole Trump does this whole trim the burning the Trump I'm waiting on [Applause] I'm looking for a Trump that has a pure and holy sound a trunk that has meaning and significance to my life a trumpet that brings about a real transformation and change of the very sales of my body that's the kind of change I'm looking for not change in my pocket but a heartbeat of God I'm telling your friends to get focused on these things of the earth you will be left behind just because you come here and you said in this church is not a sign it's not sealed in that you're going in the rapture you're going in the rapture is you first must be raised up I'll tell you this right here there ain't a man in here they ain't a woman in here they ain't nobody even the prophet of God standing here even Jesus Christ himself cannot put it in your heart you've got to welcome it you've got to see that it's more than life but if you're content with the church life that's all you ever be I'm saying this to you this morning because I love you you're not going in a rapture unless you've been raised up and the only way you can be raised up is you first got to realize you need to die amen and when you die you're buried then you can be raised up and when you're raised up then you're ready for the rapture you're no longer walking with the old man but you are new man and new creation in Christ Jesus all your motives objectives ambitions have been changed to love him you understand I'm not talking about a concept of him remember as Pilgrims and strangers our lives show the token the seal shows coming and going when the blood has been applied the Prophet said just to have the blood in the basin it has to be applied when it's applied it brings about change and the change that it brings about it changes this inner man it turns it heavenly it raises you up can I have just about five more minutes I want out I want to just drop something here now that's the Ernest oh my let me just read that whole statement again it was once subject to sin in mire and corruption I don't care how many times I hear brother Brown saying this and even in the Easter seal I still have a shout and fit little say no I didn't go out in the world but you were still subject to sin your first birth but you know you received that new life on the inside that kicks against that first birth first birth wants to pull you this way or this thing wants the cut no no now that's I don't wanna miss one but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture it's the earnest so when the devil tells you you're not one of them you can just pull it out and say I already got the ticket I've already been checked in at the gate and I'm not getting off this airplane I'm seated you know it isn't an airplane you get an airplane everybody goes you sit down like this but you go to get in the spaceship you know sit down like this you sit down and your seats are like this what is it you turn heavenly your face and where you're going man [Applause] make sure the form of God has buckled on glory be to God and the devil tries the whisper hey there's been explosions there's been explosions there's been others have tried to go this way and the captain's on there saying don't pay attention my word is tried and true you're sealed in and he's sealed out you raised up ready for rapture let's talk about that millennium you'll notice in the back of your guide there are many things that's been provided for you to tell you things that are to be [Music] notice it goes on here when we're looking at this in the Easter sea I'm closing I'm closing brother Doug I'm closing brother Doug picks on me we love you brother Doug here on the Easter seal the Prophet he makes a statement in paragraph 97 he says the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the Holy Spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the Grace and knowledge of God you are baptized into the Holy Spirit now as the Pentecostal church baptized into the Holy Spirit it's begin growing limbs has died they was pruning them off but the tree is still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection it's true in in our lives things that we once thought what as they do as God continues to reveal himself and he's quickening that word to us it's pruned away through the tests and trials it's coming what's the test in job it's just pruning it's removing what's he removing he's removing the part of us that's really not us they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers the word keeps quickening as you come to the first limb second limb third limb on up it just keeps quickening the spirit of God keeps quickening to you the earnest in you the earnest in me raised up ready for rapture he's continuing to quicken his word to us I hope this doesn't stumble you he wouldn't matter if God if it was another hundred years this word is gonna keep quickening I don't believe gonna be another hundred years and I'm what I'm what I'm saying within it the word it keeps quickening the message the scriptures the Bible is not like an accumulation of facts I can remember this chapter I can remember this verse I can remember this quote there's a lot of quotes there's a lot of quotes I can react and remember I can I can state them how brother branham the fluctuations words but I can hear it in my mind but that doesn't mean anything it's not about memory it's not about what we can remember because listen friends it's not like accumulation of knowledge it's where God is revealing and making himself real to us and you'll find that God can come right back around and perhaps even the same scripture the same quote he can read it again in another service you know come back around and it'll speak right to your need right at that moment why it's him the author who's quickening the word to our hearts so we're raised up and ready for rapture if you're not raised up this morning you have an opportunity you do don't don't don't despise it don't despise it don't say well you know I seem like every time I'm coming there preaching on me if you're feeling that God if you're feeling that tug on your heart that's God try desiring to draw you to himself what do I do surrender to that don't be afraid of it surrender to him and let him do and welcome him in allow him to click in the word letting keep quickening word let him keep moving within your life don't say well once I get rid of this and I get rid no no let let him let him he is the fountain that's open in the house of David it's him that is the dissolver of all doubts he settles all things it's him in your life and in my life let him do the work but it's it's like this if you know if if you don't send your kid to school sorry for all the boys and girls going to school if you don't send them to school how can they learn you have to keep submitting yourself to the Lord you put on a message when you're at home you're riding in the car you're praying pray after those things seek after read in the scriptures listen enemy says they don't make any sense to you your mind your mind says he's not making any sense to you listen as you're reading those are not just man's words that's God's Word and God comes to confirm his word in your life so what am I doing is I'm feeding on ever the same it's like maybe not being understanding I'm not listen don't pay attention to that place that's an earthly voice that's a voice of trying to somehow get you to think as though that it has to be understood in an earthly way that's not how we know God God is spiritually revealed and discerned and that same God as he speaks to you as you you as you give yourself why would why are you giving yourself to him because you know he who made the promise to give the promise after he raised and he was ascending up the scriptures tell us in the Book of Luke the last verses in the Book of Luke the scripture says as he was ascending up you know when he was ascending up the disciples didn't see the Old Testament Saints going with him it was a secret going but what they did they ran into the city the Bible said were filled with joy they didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet but they had they had that it's like the quarter in the hand they knew he who gave the promise that I go before you he told us where to go and then they had a faith and confidence he fulfills his word that's why he would not just come out to him and say look I'm Jesus I'm Jesus he revealed himself to them by his showing that what I have said I will perform and the same God who speaks to your heart he's the same God would perform his word listen friends I say this for from the depths of my heart you don't want to settle for just a church life you want Christ to
