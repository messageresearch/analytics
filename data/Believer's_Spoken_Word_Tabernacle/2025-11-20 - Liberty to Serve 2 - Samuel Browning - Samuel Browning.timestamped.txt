[34:40] strength to us, Lord? Lord, as we've

[34:55] minds, Lord, would be tired, be weary,

[34:59] Lord. Oh God, that we might, Lord Jesus,
[35:03] just Lord, be able to give, Lord, of

[36:10] know what it is but Lord there's nothing
[36:12] that Lord that the name of Jesus Christ
[36:16] is not greater Lord than that situation.
[36:19] So we place Lord the name of Jesus
[36:21] Christ above every need Lord God. Oh
[36:26] grant it Lord in the name of Jesus
[36:28] Christ. Lord.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For our families, for Lord,

[36:37] Lord God, we place the name of Jesus
[36:40] Christ. [music]
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord, we pray.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; In Jesus precious name.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Thank you, Lord. Oh,
[36:52] don't you just love him?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? [music]
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How precious it is just to
[37:02] be in his presence.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord, for your mercy.
[37:11] Amen.
[37:14] Hallelujah.
[37:18] Amen. We just want to just invite you
[37:20] here into the scripture here this
[37:22] evening.
[37:24] Amen. Let's turn to Galatians chapter 5.
[37:27] So, thank you for Amen.
[37:30] song service here tonight, the worship.
[37:32] Amen. And what a wonderful atmosphere.
[37:35] And Amen. I just so appreciate seeing
[37:38] each one of you. And Amen. God bless you
[37:40] for your sacrifice. And because it
[37:43] certainly is a [clears throat]
[37:46] it's not very much compared to what he
[37:47] did, but yet there's many times that in
[37:51] our lives it it is a sacrifice. But I
[37:53] know that it can go without a show of
[37:55] hands. There's never been one sacrifice
[37:58] that we've ever made for the things of
[38:01] God. But what the dividends have been so
[38:04] much greater.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; And uh so many times how we the
[38:10] sacrifice is actually just really a lot
[38:13] of times going beyond our feelings and
[38:14] circumstances. But you know what?
[38:16] There's no better place than we could be
[38:18] &gt;&gt; than to be in the house of God
[38:20] &gt;&gt; and be with brothers and sisters of like
[38:22] precious faith.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to the Lord here in prayer
[38:27] tonight. And uh we're not in prayer but
[38:29] right into the scriptures in Galatians
[38:31] 5. And I want to just read these few
[38:34] verses. For brethren, ye have been
[38:37] called unto liberty.
[38:40] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[38:44] the flesh, but by love serve one
[38:48] another. For all the law is fulfilled in
[38:52] one word, even in this, thou shalt love
[38:55] thy neighbor as thyself.
[38:59] But if ye bite and devour one another,
[39:02] take heed that you be not consumed one
[39:05] of another. And this I say then, walk in
[39:09] the spirit, and you shall not fulfill
[39:13] the lust of the flesh. For the flesh
[39:17] lusteth against the spirit, and the
[39:19] spirit against the flesh, and these are
[39:22] contrary the one to the other, so that
[39:25] you cannot do the things that you would.
[39:29] But if you be led of the spirit,
[39:32] &gt;&gt; you're not under the law. Amen. May God
[39:36] bless you and bless the reading of the
[39:38] word as you're being seated. I'd like to
[39:40] just um
[39:42] continue to speak on this thought on
[39:44] liberty to serve. And we want to just
[39:49] look back here and with this of liberty
[39:52] and that is before us. And I want to
[39:55] just go through a few scriptures here
[39:57] tonight and and looking at that of just
[40:00] liberty and then getting into our
[40:03] scripture here. Paul says, "Now the Lord
[40:07] is that spirit. And where the spirit of
[40:10] the Lord is, there is liberty." Now, I
[40:16] certainly believe that there is a place
[40:18] we want the house of God to be a place
[40:22] of liberty, a place that where that
[40:25] lives can experience the very liberating
[40:28] power of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:32] But we recognize that within that the
[40:34] whole objective is for what I just
[40:36] mentioned that hearts would be able to
[40:38] really experience in their own personal
[40:41] life a real liberty. Not just something
[40:44] that lifts off of us when we come
[40:47] together because many times as we can
[40:49] get in the presence of God and the
[40:51] presence of one another. And we all
[40:54] understand this as as children of God
[40:56] that things can lift from off of our
[40:58] life. clouds can be broken back. And yet
[41:01] we also realize as the prophet would
[41:04] tell us that many times that there's
[41:06] things that even lives can enjoy the
[41:09] liberty or the joy that would be
[41:11] present. Brother Bram tells us even
[41:13] where we could enjoy even the word as
[41:16] it's being given. But if if it doesn't
[41:19] go down to the inner man, then that's
[41:22] really not the liberty that God wants
[41:24] for us. So the real the gospel is to
[41:27] bring about a real liberty that sons and
[41:29] daughters of God might be made manifest.
[41:32] So as he said, where the spirit of the
[41:34] Lord is, there is liberty. And I
[41:37] certainly believe that that's for that's
[41:39] for in our soul. But we all with open
[41:42] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[41:45] of the Lord are changed into the same
[41:48] image from glory to glory even as by the
[41:53] spirit of the Lord. And that that word
[41:57] liberty that is used there true liberty
[42:00] is living as we ought to and not as we
[42:05] please.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; That's real liberty. That's that's the
[42:08] real defining of the word that Paul
[42:10] would use there. And Jesus would say it
[42:12] like this to the Jews which believed on
[42:15] him. If you continue in my word, then
[42:19] you are my disciples indeed. So they had
[42:22] believed on him. But to continue on and
[42:25] you shall know the truth and the truth
[42:28] shall make you free. So to know is is
[42:33] relationship with him. They answered and
[42:36] said, "We be Abraham's seed, and we were
[42:38] never in bondage to any man. And how
[42:40] sayest thou, ye shall be made free?"
[42:43] Jesus answered them and said unto them,
[42:45] "Whosoever committh sin, or is a
[42:47] practitioner from that of the desire, is
[42:50] the servant of sin, and the servant
[42:53] abideth not in the house forever, but
[42:56] the son abideth forever. If the son
[42:59] therefore shall make you free, you shall
[43:02] be free indeed. Now to think how Jesus
[43:06] would write this and we we quote this um
[43:09] you know very uh much and and I I think
[43:11] we understand what we're saying when
[43:13] they say well the truth shall set you
[43:14] free. And you look at this word make,
[43:17] it's a creation. Because in in what God
[43:20] comes to do is not just simply clean up
[43:23] the man and then just, you know, just
[43:25] simply just step inside, but God wants
[43:28] to completely bring a transformation in
[43:31] that to where the old man dies. The old
[43:35] ways die, the old nature dies. There's a
[43:39] complete surrender to where now the very
[43:42] seed of God, Christ's own life, come and
[43:45] unites with that seed of God that's on
[43:48] the inside. And then that's where it
[43:51] brings forth a new creation. And so when
[43:54] we look at this this freedom that God
[43:57] would bring, only God can bring this.
[43:59] And God is the one who leads us and
[44:02] draws us into this place of a real
[44:05] freedom. Paul would write of this in
[44:07] Galatians 5:1. Standf fast, therefore,
[44:10] in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
[44:13] made us free. So Paul's letting them
[44:15] know this this is a a battle that you
[44:18] are engaged in there. Even as he was
[44:21] writing to the Galatian church, there
[44:23] was them of of false brethren, Judaizers
[44:26] that were coming in that were, you know,
[44:29] not dis they were disanoling the very
[44:31] full work of Christ. This is why the
[44:34] prophet would say he's in the church age
[44:36] book. I love how he says it. He says
[44:38] that salvation is not Jesus plus works.
[44:41] It is Jesus and Jesus alone.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; He said because if you truly experience
[44:47] salvation then works will follow.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; So then you can't help because it's what
[44:54] begins to come out of your life. No more
[44:56] than a than a you have to tell a sheep
[44:58] to produce wool. You don't have to do
[45:00] that. It comes out of their life. And so
[45:03] God, that's exactly what the Holy Spirit
[45:06] comes to do is to release a son and
[45:09] daughter of God that is there on the
[45:11] inside. Now when you think of this with
[45:14] this liberty as we were reading here in
[45:16] the scripture we we understand that a
[45:18] liberty that God would bring to our life
[45:21] and when Paul would write of this in the
[45:24] book of Galatians that we've been called
[45:26] unto liberty only use not liberty for an
[45:30] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[45:33] one another. Let me just say it like
[45:35] this. There is no desire within a
[45:39] bornagain believer's life for the world.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Now I didn't say the flesh but yet at
[45:46] the same time it is whatever is there on
[45:49] the throne of our heart. When when that
[45:51] has passed away from our life there is
[45:54] no longer a desire for the things of the
[45:57] world. As a matter of fact it would
[45:59] actually haunt you. There's no doubt
[46:02] throughout this room that many of you
[46:03] probably from what God has brought you
[46:06] out of or even of things that you never
[46:08] had even experienced in your own life
[46:10] and you have a dream or a nightmare that
[46:13] you are uh in a situation or doing
[46:17] something that maybe God brought you out
[46:19] of or something you never was in and
[46:21] then you wake up and you're trying to
[46:23] actually think and come to yourself
[46:25] because it seems so real and it grips
[46:28] you and say, "Oh God, I I trust Lord
[46:31] that that's not been something Lord and
[46:34] and you're trying to come to yourself.
[46:36] Why? Because within your heart the
[46:40] desire alone is to please God.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; He's he's become the very love of your
[46:46] life. There is no longer a hold for the
[46:50] things of the world. Brother Brandham
[46:51] would say it like this. Let me just
[46:53] preface this quote that I'll display. He
[46:55] speaks of how that there is no other
[46:57] mediator between God and man. and we're
[47:00] freely pardoned and forgiven. God don't
[47:02] even know we ever sinned. Our sins were
[47:04] put in the sea of forgetfulness, never
[47:06] to be remembered no more. We can't do
[47:09] that in ourselves. We are finite. He's
[47:12] infinite and and our finite. We can
[47:15] still remember because we're not big
[47:17] enough. But he is so great that he even
[47:19] forgets that we ever did sin. We are
[47:22] sons and daughters in his presence. And
[47:25] all things that he was, we are. He
[47:28] become my sin that I might become his
[47:31] righteousness. He become your sin. He
[47:34] might be that you might become his
[47:35] righteousness. See, God can't see no sin
[47:38] in you as long as your confession is in
[47:41] Jesus Christ. And brother Ram goes on to
[47:44] say, "Someone some time ago said, if I
[47:47] believed a thing like that, would I ever
[47:50] turn the steam on? I'd paint the town
[47:53] red. I'd go to every dance hall. I'd get
[47:55] so drunk and everything else because and
[47:58] brother Bram says why you're already
[48:01] secured in Christ. What difference does
[48:04] it make? See, the desire would no longer
[48:08] be there.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; It it it wouldn't matter because in
[48:12] reality, I can do what I want to do.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And all things Paul said, are lawful
[48:19] unto me,
[48:20] &gt;&gt; right? I'm not I'm not held by, oh, I I
[48:23] I I I can't do this. But it is a love
[48:26] affair. I don't want to do those things.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do those things. The
[48:31] things that that I that I used to do, I
[48:34] HAVE NO DESIRE TO DO THOSE THINGS. AND
[48:36] IT ISN'T JUST NOT DOING THOSE THINGS OF
[48:38] THAT of the attributes of unbelief. But
[48:41] the the very thing that THE WORD OF GOD
[48:43] HAS BECOME MY DELIGHT. NOW, I'M NOT
[48:45] TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY DELIGHT, THAT
[48:47] IS JUST THE PRINT to study the print.
[48:50] THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[48:52] I'm talking about also hearing the word
[48:55] of God and the desire to submit to the
[48:58] very person of Jesus Christ, his
[49:01] character. So this is where there comes
[49:04] a real liberty within our lives. So when
[49:07] we see this, brother Ramy goes on to say
[49:09] that shows you haven't got it. If the
[49:13] love of God ever struck your heart in
[49:15] the tenderness of Jesus Christ, you
[49:17] would be so in love with him, the world
[49:20] would be dead as your sin. That's how
[49:23] you know you have the Holy Spirit. Not
[49:25] because you could scream, shout, speak
[49:28] in tongues, whatever it is, but when sin
[49:31] becomes dead and you're alive in Jesus
[49:34] Christ. Oh, love of God, how rich, how
[49:37] pure.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham many different
[49:40] times would talk about the dove and the
[49:42] crow and how that both of them Noah
[49:46] released both of them out the window of
[49:50] the ark. The crow was able to go and
[49:53] light down and feed and feed and feed.
[49:57] But the dove could not feed on
[49:59] dedicarion.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; You know why? It wasn't just well
[50:02] because it's not the pallet. She does
[50:04] not have anything within her to be able
[50:08] to digest that.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Brother B said when that dove would
[50:11] light down and he dramatizes it. If she
[50:13] would light down upon something and
[50:16] maybe to light down oo she just it backs
[50:18] right away from it. It it's something
[50:20] about it she's not meant to digest that
[50:23] because even a dove as you with having
[50:26] the spirit of God in your life. There's
[50:29] things where you no doubt have lit down
[50:31] upon things. But when the spirit of God
[50:34] is in your life, you cannot remain
[50:36] there.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHY? THE SPIRIT OF GOD, the life
[50:40] of God is a keeper. It's an anchor. It's
[50:43] a hold. It's a seal. You can't lay light
[50:46] light down upon it because it is
[50:49] something within you that is not built
[50:51] to digest that. This is why brother Ram
[50:55] says, "I don't care how long you've been
[50:57] in church. If you get turned loose in
[51:00] the world and you can still go out and
[51:02] do the things you once did and enjoy it,
[51:04] it shows you've never come to God. It
[51:08] doesn't matter if a person's been in
[51:09] church 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, and
[51:12] I'm talking about right around the
[51:13] message. If they're able to go out and
[51:15] do the things that they once did, and
[51:18] there's no problem with it whatsoever,
[51:20] they're able to go right out.
[51:21] Something's wrong. They never came to
[51:23] God. Might have come to justification.
[51:26] Might have even come to sanctification.
[51:28] But I want you to remember
[51:29] sanctification is a very dangerous place
[51:32] to stay because the Bible tells us when
[51:35] the unclean spirit is gone out. It it is
[51:38] not cast out. The prophet said it's not
[51:40] cast out. It goes out on its own accord
[51:44] &gt;&gt; and it goes out and it walks. And then
[51:46] if that vessel is never filled, it
[51:49] returns back to that house with seven
[51:51] other devils. And the scripture says the
[51:54] last estate of that man is worse than
[51:57] the first. The prophet tells us what
[51:59] makes it the worst is it becomes a
[52:01] religious spirit.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; NOT GOING BACK OUT in the world and
[52:05] necessarily doing this and doing that,
[52:07] but it becomes even religious. And yet
[52:10] it all of those things that once dwelt
[52:13] there made it do this and made it do
[52:15] that can return right back. This is why
[52:17] that just staying within sanctification
[52:20] is dangerous. You must go on to the new
[52:24] birth.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The prophet said in
[52:28] future home if we stay, he said there
[52:30] will be those that have come just in
[52:32] justification and sanctification and
[52:34] will wind up in hell because they
[52:37] rejected the Holy Ghost.
[52:39] You know what the Holy Spirit is? It's
[52:41] liberty. DO WE NOT experience liberty
[52:43] with justification? We do. We experience
[52:46] a measure of it. We experience a measure
[52:49] of liberty with sanctification where the
[52:51] want to is taken out of our life. But
[52:54] the real depth of liberty is where that
[52:56] of the Holy Spirit COMES INTO OUR LIFE
[52:59] AND fully in the measure to release a
[53:02] son and daughter of God TO WHERE THE
[53:04] VERY DESIRE OF THE WORLD HAS PASSED AWAY
[53:08] AND it is Christ and the life has been
[53:11] changed because the nature on the inside
[53:15] has been changed.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what we live by is that's
[53:18] what we go by. We don't live by, oh, I
[53:21] felt this, or I remember when this
[53:23] experience happened to me. We don't, YOU
[53:24] CAN'T LIVE BY THAT. That's not the word.
[53:26] You, your experience must come back to
[53:30] the word. That's real liberty. Heavens
[53:33] and earth will pass away, but my word
[53:35] shall never fail. Now notice when we
[53:39] look at this here in the scripture
[53:41] because even you know sister Bruce when
[53:43] brother Brandham interviewed her and he
[53:44] picks this up in the masterpiece that he
[53:46] walks out and preaches right after the
[53:48] interview. Brother Brandham I have so
[53:50] many things that I know that's wrong and
[53:53] yet a real godly woman.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Now we understand sister Bruce went
[53:57] running out on the streets.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; We understand what kind of a life that
[54:02] she was living. Brother Ram said a real
[54:04] godly woman. But yet there is THINGS
[54:07] ABOUT HER LIFE NOW watch this that she's
[54:10] looking at. I know there's a little bit
[54:12] of a a um a a dispensation and a time in
[54:16] there because even in the tabernacle
[54:18] there were those thinking in ' 65 a year
[54:21] later. Oh brother, why don't brother
[54:22] Brandham preach on the Holy Ghost? And
[54:23] brother Brandham said I am preaching on
[54:26] the Holy Ghost. Satan's Eden 1965. He
[54:28] said here's what it is. It's the person
[54:30] of Christ in you that's quickened to
[54:33] every word for this age. AND HE SAID,
[54:35] "DON'T WATCH IT IN DEMONSTRATION.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Watch it in action."
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Because it can demonstrate in the house
[54:42] of God, but it's how it's lived out
[54:44] here.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; That's what matters. Because there's all
[54:47] sorts of things that that can
[54:48] demonstrations and where the spirit of
[54:50] God can get on it. BUT WHEN THE SPIRIT
[54:52] OF GOD has really CHANGED THAT LIFE, IT
[54:54] changes that nature to such a place to
[54:57] where that life actually becomes a
[54:59] submissive servant to the word of God.
[55:02] Praise the Lord.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram, it says, Brother
[55:04] Brandham, I have so many things that I
[55:06] know that's wrong and a real godly
[55:09] woman. But I said, look, sister, you
[55:11] don't look at yourself. You just what
[55:13] your desire is and what you try to do.
[55:16] If you really love the Lord, you try to
[55:19] serve him with all your heart and then
[55:21] all your mistakes is hid in the blood of
[55:24] the Lord Jesus.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; He made a way.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You try TO SERVE HIM
[55:31] WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; OH MY. WITH everything within you,
[55:35] you're desiring. Yet there's things that
[55:37] we can see even within our life as we're
[55:40] submitting to the Lord. Not making
[55:42] excuses for it. If we And that's a
[55:44] different thing. If we're making
[55:45] excuses, we're in trouble right there.
[55:47] But to understand how we can submit
[55:49] these things to the Lord and really
[55:52] place it there before God and say, "God,
[55:54] help me." It's incredible as you walk ON
[55:56] WITH GOD. THERE'S things that you will
[55:58] actually as a believer when even you've
[56:01] been born of the spirit of God, you
[56:03] begin to see things in your life. You'll
[56:05] see things that God has now brought you
[56:07] to a point of reckoning in your life
[56:09] that is actually character molding time.
[56:13] It's things where God is molding us and
[56:16] shaping us. As a matter of fact, uh you
[56:18] know, I'll just say it from my own
[56:19] heart. I have not I have not found out
[56:22] of my own life that since God has
[56:24] changed my life and working with my life
[56:26] that I feel like in some way that I am a
[56:29] bigger person or whatever now as a
[56:32] matter of fact I feel more incapable in
[56:35] my own self THAN I EVER DID. I'LL TELL
[56:38] YOU I REMEMBER WHEN GOD FIRST you know
[56:40] everything dropped to be a pastor I that
[56:43] scared me to death. Let me just tell you
[56:45] something. Even here right now, after 23
[56:48] YEARS LATER, I STILL I FEEL MORE
[56:51] INCAPABLE of doing WHAT HE'S ASKED ME TO
[56:54] DO than I ever have.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not just saying that. I I'm saying
[57:00] beyond re in reality, THERE'S THINGS
[57:03] THAT GOD will even begin to look and
[57:05] bring us TO IN OUR LIFE. AND YOU KNOW,
[57:07] GOD COULD HAVE SO FLOODED ALL THIS RIGHT
[57:09] AT THE BEGINNING, BUT GOD IS BRINGING US
[57:12] TO A PLACE THE CLOSER THAT WE GET.
[57:14] REMEMBER, these are not just quotes.
[57:16] These are not just statements. THESE ARE
[57:18] NOT JUST SHOUTING STATEMENTS, but
[57:20] they're more as the bride nears him, she
[57:24] becomes more like him.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; SO THOSE DEAL WITH WITH CHARACTER, DEALS
[57:31] WITH HIS LIFE BEING ON display the
[57:34] closer we get to HIM. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T
[57:35] BE GETTING CLOSER TO him and becoming
[57:38] more obstinate, more stubborn, uh, you
[57:41] know, and we that just can't be that
[57:43] because it shows we're not actually
[57:45] getting closer, we're actually getting
[57:47] further from where we need to be. Right.
[57:50] Right.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; So now when you see this grace itself,
[57:55] remember as we were looking at this last
[57:57] week that how that even within this that
[57:59] grace itself is what God has done for
[58:03] you and works is what you and I do in
[58:06] appreciation.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram says, "If I never
[58:10] preached another service, I'm saved."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; If brother Ryan NEVER LED SONGS AGAIN,
[58:16] HE'S SAVED.
[58:19] THAT is even an extra even beyond and I
[58:23] don't want to just limit it to preaching
[58:25] or singing but I'm talking about beyond
[58:28] our life. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM
[58:29] SAYS I WANT TO DO SOMETHING BEYOND MY
[58:32] DUTY.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; He said my duty is to preach funerals.
[58:35] My duty IS TO BUT I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
[58:38] BEYOND
[58:39] &gt;&gt; my duty. Right?
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That's something that burns within our
[58:44] hearts for for the the kingdom of
[58:46] Christ, for the kingdom of God. And so
[58:49] it's an appreciation of the grace that's
[58:52] been showed to us. Brother Ram would say
[58:53] it like this and you know in that same
[58:55] quote out of the Hebrew series regarding
[58:57] Sister Mey as his wife. He said,
[58:59] "Acepting her as my wife, that's what
[59:02] love done for her. But what she does is
[59:05] in appreciation of that she's a nice
[59:07] woman, stays home, takes care of the
[59:09] children, and lives a good true life.
[59:11] That's not because we're not married. We
[59:13] are married. But she does that in
[59:16] appreciations. If she running downtown
[59:18] every day, took in every tent store, up
[59:20] and down the streets, never washed the
[59:22] dishes or anything. We are still
[59:24] married. When I took my vow, that
[59:26] settles it. She's my wife. As long as
[59:28] there's life in us, she's my wife.
[59:30] That's her vow. But what appreciation
[59:33] she does for that. She stays home, takes
[59:35] care of the children, and tries to be a
[59:37] real wife. He said, "Now I could run out
[59:39] and be gone all the time gading about
[59:40] over the country. Let her have starve or
[59:42] anything else and let the children go
[59:44] without something to eat. We're still
[59:46] married. If she even divorces me, still
[59:48] married. Long as there's life in my
[59:50] body, I took that vow till death we
[59:52] separate, we're still married. But yet,
[59:54] I would make a poor excuse of a husband
[59:57] and she'd make a poor excuse as a wife.
[59:59] So if we love one another, we stick
[1:00:03] together and pull the load
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Then we don't do it because well, we're
[1:00:10] not married. And it's NOT JUST, WELL,
[1:00:12] WE'RE MARRIED, BUT IT IS OUT OF THAT OF
[1:00:14] being married and that love that brings
[1:00:17] forth the works or an appreciation for
[1:00:21] what has been done. And so we understand
[1:00:24] that even within all that my how Satan
[1:00:27] would love and would love to attack that
[1:00:29] and and love to try to draw about
[1:00:32] feelings and even as seasons of life
[1:00:34] will change even how we minister to one
[1:00:37] another as husband and wife. There's
[1:00:39] things that will will change and we
[1:00:41] realize how we must be sensitive. It's
[1:00:43] just like in the needs in this hour that
[1:00:45] we're in. It's ways that God, remember
[1:00:48] the prophet would be so clear to state
[1:00:50] it like this, THAT GOD NEVER CHANGES HIS
[1:00:53] NATURE, BUT HE SAID GOD BECOMES TO THAT
[1:00:57] generation in order to make himself
[1:01:00] known to those people.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS where you and I are at. He
[1:01:05] knows even how to reach even as we look
[1:01:07] at with the young people and things. So
[1:01:09] we're not trying to apply models from
[1:01:12] you know 10 even 15 20 years ago but
[1:01:15] we're looking to the wisdom of God. How
[1:01:17] do we catch even right now with THE
[1:01:20] DIVINE NATURE OF GOD? HOW DO WE how do
[1:01:22] we become to this generation? So God had
[1:01:26] a reason for saving me a purpose and I
[1:01:30] am to fulfill that purpose.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice, watch how brother
[1:01:36] Brandham or not brother Brandham, but
[1:01:38] watch how the amplified will will will
[1:01:41] go into this here on this scripture we
[1:01:43] read for our text. He said, "For you,
[1:01:46] brethren, were indeed called to freedom.
[1:01:49] Only do not let your freedom be an
[1:01:52] incentive to your flesh, an opportunity
[1:01:56] or excuse for selfishness."
[1:02:01] Got quiet.
[1:02:04] But through love you should serve one
[1:02:08] another.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; So you mean that a person can be called
[1:02:13] to liberty
[1:02:15] and be totally free and liberated in
[1:02:19] their soul as a son and daughter of God.
[1:02:23] But liberty could be used the wrong way.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Could there be a misuse? could to be a
[1:02:30] misperception
[1:02:32] of applying this. I'm free. I'm free. I
[1:02:37] don't I don't have to obey nobody. I'm
[1:02:40] free. Now, listen. Let me just say it
[1:02:42] like this. If a person truly is at
[1:02:45] liberty in their soul, they will heed
[1:02:49] the leadership
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:52] THEY BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST on the
[1:02:55] inside will recognize his word at all
[1:02:58] times.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; That that is a real real sign of where
[1:03:03] the spirit of God would move down within
[1:03:06] a life. And yet there's things within
[1:03:08] our lives that let me just give you this
[1:03:11] example. The prophet walks in to his
[1:03:13] house. You're familiar with this. And
[1:03:15] here, you know, people have been back
[1:03:16] and forth through the house all day.
[1:03:18] Brother Bram dramatized it in different
[1:03:20] times of how there was people walking
[1:03:21] through. I got a word from the Lord.
[1:03:23] Yay. I say I got a word from the Lord
[1:03:24] for you and if you don't listen to me,
[1:03:26] God's going to take the airplane out of
[1:03:27] the air and all all kinds of nonsense.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; And like brother Ram said, he said,
[1:03:31] "Look, God speaks to me. If he's got a
[1:03:33] word,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; I'm on speaking terms with him.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; He'll let me know."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; But you THINK ALL OF THIS WAS GOING
[1:03:39] THROUGH THE HOUSE DEALING WITH, YOU SEE
[1:03:40] WHAT IS IT? SPIRITS, dealing with
[1:03:42] nervous spirits, all those things was in
[1:03:44] the den room. ALL THE AND THE HOUSE WAS
[1:03:46] JUST SUCH AN UPHEAVAL. And here, you
[1:03:48] know, Sister Meaty trying, you know, had
[1:03:50] even got dinner on yet. And my, you
[1:03:52] know, you can know what that is as a
[1:03:54] husband. Your your wife will say, "I
[1:03:55] don't even know what I'm going to do for
[1:03:56] dinner tonight." I mean, peanut butter
[1:03:59] and jelly could seem like a stretch. you
[1:04:01] know baloney could seem BECAUSE
[1:04:02] SOMETIMES IT'S JUST EVEN THE CARES OF
[1:04:04] LIFE AND EVEN has times change I mean
[1:04:07] with with the the children change
[1:04:09] pressures change hormones change A LOT
[1:04:12] OF THINGS CHANGE TO WHERE ALL OF A
[1:04:14] SUDDEN THAT be might BE ABLE TO HANDLE
[1:04:16] THIS MUCH PRESSURE AND YET NOW in this
[1:04:18] season of life we can handle about this
[1:04:20] much pressure
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; and yet God understands and God
[1:04:27] ministers to us and God helps us even as
[1:04:31] husbands to be able to minister to our
[1:04:33] wives in those times of need.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Even even as brothers, you go through
[1:04:38] seasons and changes of life as well. But
[1:04:41] brother Brandham, I love how he says it
[1:04:42] like this. He says, when all this was
[1:04:44] going on, all the turmoil, he said, I
[1:04:47] was tired.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He says this, I was tired. He said, 'But
[1:04:52] I asked, Lord, what would you have me be
[1:04:57] in this moment?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; So, he just didn't walk in there and
[1:05:02] say, "Hey, come on. This is enough. You
[1:05:03] I mean, YOU ALL KNOW YOU know this is a
[1:05:05] bunch of nonsense. You know this is
[1:05:07] nothing but devils that was going
[1:05:08] through here and demons and things like
[1:05:10] that." No, no, no, no. The way remember
[1:05:13] the atmosphere, it isn't that the devils
[1:05:15] and the demons and all the But you got
[1:05:17] to change. Remember the prophet said,
[1:05:19] "Change the atmosphere.
[1:05:22] AND SO AS A SON OF GOD, BROTHER RAM
[1:05:24] SAID, YOU KNOW, HE SAID, I took that. He
[1:05:26] said, these were my children. This was
[1:05:30] my wife. This is a man who has a
[1:05:32] relationship WITH GOD WHO'S STANDING
[1:05:34] RIGHT there in his home and taking
[1:05:36] dominion over the atmosphere. And he
[1:05:39] puts on an apron. And what God has led
[1:05:42] him to do in that situation, he's
[1:05:45] praying for her while he's washing
[1:05:46] dishes. He's talking to her ABOUT A
[1:05:48] DRESS DOWN THERE. NONE OF THESE things
[1:05:50] in themselves seem spiritual, but he HAS
[1:05:54] ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME A CONDUIT FOR
[1:05:58] THE PEACE OF GOD TO MOVE DOWN IN his
[1:06:02] home. DID HE HAVE TO DO THAT? NO.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He could have had an occasion to the
[1:06:08] flesh and said, "I'm out of here.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I've been the one in there all day
[1:06:13] long." All right.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; You see, IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE HAVE
[1:06:16] ALL OF THIS LIST OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN
[1:06:19] DOING all day long. And I I certainly
[1:06:20] believe there needs to be we have to
[1:06:23] understand one another. And
[1:06:25] understanding one another doesn't mean
[1:06:27] your way or the other person's way.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Understanding means where we sit down,
[1:06:33] as the prophet said IN ' 64, TALK TO ONE
[1:06:36] ANOTHER. TRY TO UNDERSTAND one another.
[1:06:39] You can't you can't understand when this
[1:06:41] is going.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go. IF THIS IS FLAPPING,
[1:06:44] THERE'S NO UNDERSTANDING GOING.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; But in order to understand, we've got to
[1:06:53] have this and this has got to be
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN REALITY, I know this is very
[1:06:58] simple, but just so that we have to have
[1:07:00] this on record cuz the world doesn't
[1:07:02] understand this. In the beginning, God
[1:07:05] made them male and female.
[1:07:09] He made them different in the WAY THAT
[1:07:11] THEY LOOK AT THINGS AND THEY THINK ABOUT
[1:07:13] THINGS. My Lord, I remember when my wife
[1:07:16] and I FIRST GOT MARRIED, I mean, I wish
[1:07:18] that revelation would have been right
[1:07:20] there all along to understand that. BUT
[1:07:23] YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD had to take A DUMMY
[1:07:25] LIKE ME AND BRING ME THROUGH SOME of
[1:07:27] those channels to say, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:07:28] SHUT up a minute and just listen to
[1:07:32] her."
[1:07:33] I know some of you wives are like,
[1:07:35] "That's going to be the NEXT YOUTUBE
[1:07:37] SHORT RIGHT THERE." SURE IS THE WORLD.
[1:07:39] [cheering]
[1:07:40] [applause]
[1:07:40] But I'm not finished. I'M NOT FINISHED.
[1:07:44] THERE'S ANOTHER SHORT [laughter]
[1:07:46] AND IT MIGHT be longer.
[1:07:49] BUT IT WAS ALSO FOR HER then to be able
[1:07:52] to hear my heart and then to be able to
[1:07:57] talk through these things, try to come
[1:07:59] to a place of understanding. And so it
[1:08:02] takes like a giving and a giving and a
[1:08:04] working together because you can never
[1:08:06] work together when it's all one-sided.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; See, unity, as we've been dealing with
[1:08:11] this for weeks, unity is not that
[1:08:14] everybody sees it according to how you
[1:08:17] see it.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; But unity is is where WE BEGIN TO TRY TO
[1:08:21] ENTER IN ON HOW MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE IS
[1:08:23] SEEING IT. AND I'LL BE HONEST with you,
[1:08:25] when brother says that quote, I usually
[1:08:27] I usually kind of chuckle at that when
[1:08:28] I've done the marriage banquetss and
[1:08:30] things like that. in here. I think it
[1:08:31] might have been just last year, the year
[1:08:33] before. I did three marriage banquetss
[1:08:35] within one year. And I look at that and
[1:08:37] this year must be the youth thing. I
[1:08:38] don't know. But you know, when you look
[1:08:40] at it, I I I think of it each time when
[1:08:42] brother Ram SAYS, "TALK TO HER,
[1:08:43] UNDERSTAND HER." AND I AND I TOLD I've
[1:08:45] said it like this. I SAID,
[1:08:46] "UNDERSTANDING DOES NOT MEAN THAT it
[1:08:49] makes sense to me."
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're expecting that,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; you got the wrong objective.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; But understanding is listening. There
[1:09:00] you go.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; It's being able to listen and to hear
[1:09:05] and to be able to work through that.
[1:09:06] Now, Brother Brand didn't have to do
[1:09:08] that. You know, IN REALITY, YOU AND I
[1:09:10] DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. NOW, LISTEN,
[1:09:11] FRIENDS. LISTEN. I understand that
[1:09:13] there's things that within our life that
[1:09:15] sometimes our background, our molding,
[1:09:17] our shaping. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT
[1:09:19] WE WERE NOT EVEN INSTRUCTED IN. There
[1:09:21] are certain things that even as I'm
[1:09:23] sitting down with those that maybe are
[1:09:25] coming to that place of engagement and
[1:09:27] they do that and I've done this over the
[1:09:28] years. I'll sit down and I have I have a
[1:09:30] criteria of things THAT I WILL SIT DOWN
[1:09:33] and go through with them. There's like
[1:09:34] 10 particular bullet POINTS THAT I'LL
[1:09:36] WORK through with them on how to
[1:09:38] minister to one another within marriage
[1:09:41] and the real secret within that and how
[1:09:44] to come along with that. You say what
[1:09:46] what's that from? That's from
[1:09:48] experience. And to BE ABLE TO COME
[1:09:50] THROUGH THAT and to work through those
[1:09:52] things in order to take away the
[1:09:54] mystery, the confusion and to be able to
[1:09:57] look at those things that IT IS MARRIAGE
[1:10:00] ITSELF IS A MINISTRY ONE TO ANOTHER. DO
[1:10:03] YOU REALIZE CHRIST, our bridegroom, our
[1:10:06] husband, he notices and takes knowledge
[1:10:09] that we are the weaker vessel
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and he ministers to our needs according
[1:10:15] to the WEAKER VESSEL. HE SUBJECTS
[1:10:17] HIMSELF OVER and over and over again TO
[1:10:21] MINISTER TO YOU AND I. HE TAKES INTO
[1:10:23] ACCOUNT THE PRAYERS that are offered up
[1:10:26] and the things that we're praying about
[1:10:28] and he is bringing our attention to in
[1:10:30] our life and he ministers to these
[1:10:32] things and these needs IN OUR LIFE. DOES
[1:10:34] HE HAVE TO DO THAT? LISTEN, JESUS
[1:10:37] HIMSELF COULD SAY, "I AM NOT FOOLING
[1:10:39] WITH NONE OF THAT TRIVIAL STUFF. I'M
[1:10:42] JUST GOING TO SPEAK ON AND PREACH THE
[1:10:44] DEEP MYSTERIES.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; He could do that.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; But the mysteries were meant to be lived
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; in simplicity.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, just to speak
[1:10:59] and to preach mysteries, the devil can
[1:11:01] run wild. But when it gets down to
[1:11:04] application in our lives,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; when it gets down to where it begins to
[1:11:10] expose and to draw out to where the
[1:11:12] rubber meets the road and the character,
[1:11:14] YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGE, AS
[1:11:16] I SAID BEFORE, THE REAL HARDSHIP AMONG
[1:11:18] WHEN OUR LIVES AS BELIEVERS IS NOT WITH
[1:11:21] THE DOCTRINE, BUT THE REAL the real
[1:11:24] where it comes TO DEATH IS DYING TO
[1:11:27] OURSELVES AND the very character of
[1:11:29] Jesus Christ being molded and shaped in
[1:11:33] our lives.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; That's where the real challenge is.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Now, think of this an opportunity or
[1:11:40] excuse for selfishness. The prophet
[1:11:42] could have done that as we said. So,
[1:11:44] there actually could be a misuse or a
[1:11:47] misrepresentation of liberty. Let's look
[1:11:50] at another portion in the word. Paul,
[1:11:52] Paul, Paul or Peter would write, "Submit
[1:11:54] yourselves to every ordinance of man for
[1:11:57] the Lord's sake, whether it be to the
[1:12:00] king as supreme, or unto governors as
[1:12:04] unto them that are sent by him for the
[1:12:07] punishment of evildoers and for the
[1:12:09] praise of them that do well." Peter knew
[1:12:12] that whoever's in power, they didn't get
[1:12:15] there on their own. Right.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; God allows GOD ALLOWS THIS ONE TO COME
[1:12:19] INTO POWER AND TAKES this one down.
[1:12:22] Don't matter if it's voting, rig voting,
[1:12:24] whatever it is.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; It don't matter. God is going to be and
[1:12:28] whom God as Daniel wrote is who it is to
[1:12:31] be.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; SO NOW WITHIN this Peter is the same one
[1:12:35] who also wrote when they said who should
[1:12:38] we obey man or God? Same man who spoke
[1:12:44] that in the book of Acts. BUT NOW NOTICE
[1:12:46] AS THIS application as it would come
[1:12:49] down because it's a different scenario.
[1:12:50] This is why WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO APPLY
[1:12:53] the word and to apply the correct word
[1:12:56] to the right situation.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; For so is the will of God that with
[1:13:00] welloing you may put to silence the
[1:13:03] ignorance of foolish men. as free and
[1:13:07] not using your liberty for a cloak of
[1:13:11] maliciousness,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; but as the servants of God, honor all
[1:13:17] men, love the brotherhood, fear God,
[1:13:20] honor the king. Isn't that incredible?
[1:13:23] As free, we are free.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD WHEN THAT HE WHO THE son
[1:13:29] hath made free is free indeed. Right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; SO NOW PAUL PETER WOULD WRITE THIS that
[1:13:36] as free and not using your liberty as a
[1:13:41] cloak of maliciousness but as THE
[1:13:44] SERVANTS OF GOD. SO AS PETER IS WRITING
[1:13:46] THIS that there can be a seeded malice
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; that can actually then conveniently use
[1:13:56] the word of God to say I don't have to
[1:14:00] obey that.
[1:14:03] Are you hearing me?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; See, it's dealing with motive and
[1:14:07] objective. And see the spirit of God
[1:14:10] dealing with this right here because
[1:14:11] Paul Peter is writing Paul to do there
[1:14:14] were those who were servants still. They
[1:14:16] had masters and and these things were
[1:14:18] TAKING PLACE. SO NOW THEY, you know,
[1:14:20] Peter is reminding them, you do not, you
[1:14:24] do not use your liberty as a cloak of
[1:14:26] malicees. Like I've always had something
[1:14:29] against that brother. Really? Since
[1:14:30] when? Well, since seventh period high
[1:14:33] school.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised sometimes the things
[1:14:40] that that that that get carried for
[1:14:43] years
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; instead of relinguish them. WHAT GOOD
[1:14:46] HAS IT DONE TO CARRY ANYTHING? WELL,
[1:14:48] THEY THEY SAID THIS YEARS AGO. THEY SAID
[1:14:51] THIS AND THE PERSON HAS NO IDEA. AND
[1:14:54] EVEN IF THEY DO, [screaming]
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; it's not hindering them.
[1:15:00] It's hindering you
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; and it's actually causing you to act out
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; and it's a power that's there. You see,
[1:15:10] this is why the spirit of God brings us
[1:15:11] to certain things to deal with things in
[1:15:14] our life. Well, I'm free. I, you know,
[1:15:16] I'm free. I don't have to listen to any
[1:15:17] man. No man's going to tell me what to
[1:15:19] do. WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE MAN. It should
[1:15:21] be the word that we're hearing. And the
[1:15:23] word is more than the letter. The word
[1:15:25] is THE VERY PERSON AND character of
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ. CUZ THERE CAN EVEN BE
[1:15:30] SITUATIONS that we can look at that it
[1:15:32] may not BE A SCRIPTURE JUMPING OUT OR OR
[1:15:35] A QUOTE RIGHT AWAY, BUT there is a way
[1:15:37] that WE ARE TO APPROACH every situation,
[1:15:40] and that is with the character of
[1:15:42] Christ.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Servants, be subject to your masters
[1:15:48] with all fear. Not only to the good and
[1:15:51] gentle, that's the easy ones, but to the
[1:15:53] froward as well. Right.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; So you mean to the bosses that are
[1:15:58] forward, be good and gentle,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. For this is thankworthy if a man
[1:16:06] for conscience toward God endure grief
[1:16:10] suffering wrongfully.
[1:16:12] Now that doesn't mean walking by that
[1:16:14] boss
[1:16:16] or brother.
[1:16:23] That's using liberty for an occasion to
[1:16:26] the flesh.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; I know it's very simple,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; but yet at the very at the very
[1:16:30] principles of things of well I I have a
[1:16:33] right for this. And remember the prophet
[1:16:34] takes us lamb and the dove. He takes us
[1:16:36] through all of this. We have rights. But
[1:16:39] remember what he said. When we think we
[1:16:42] have a right, the dove takes its flight.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Even in our action, it's when we think
[1:16:50] the dove takes its flight. That's so
[1:16:52] good.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; So then when we look at this here, for
[1:16:55] what glory is it when you be buffeted
[1:16:57] for your faults, you shall take it
[1:16:59] patiently? I mean, when you've done
[1:17:01] wrong and the boss says something,
[1:17:02] you're like, "Ah, sorry about that, man.
[1:17:04] I I messed up." But if you do well and
[1:17:07] suffer for it, you take it patiently.
[1:17:10] This is acceptable with God. For even
[1:17:14] here unto you were you called, because
[1:17:16] Christ also suffered for us, leaving us
[1:17:20] an example, who did no sin, NEITHER WAS
[1:17:24] GUILE found in his mouth.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT HE WAS saying here
[1:17:31] was what was here.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; This is the very same thing FROM ABOVE.
[1:17:36] NOW YOU know when we look at this in the
[1:17:39] scriptures here, this is why even when
[1:17:42] you consider brother Brandham, he comes
[1:17:43] to this uh the place where he had hunted
[1:17:46] squirrels before and he led that infidel
[1:17:49] to the Lord. How many remember that?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; And he takes him, you know, about the
[1:17:53] apple tree. Brother Brandham pulls in
[1:17:56] there cuz the man passed away about a
[1:17:58] year after that brother Brandham was
[1:17:59] able to lead him to the Lord. and they
[1:18:01] pull in there and because brother
[1:18:03] Brandon had been up there being able to
[1:18:04] do some work and things like that and so
[1:18:06] there was a way to get around so he
[1:18:08] didn't have to drive through the field.
[1:18:09] He had drove that way the previous time
[1:18:11] when he was there and and here comes out
[1:18:14] this this little lady this little sister
[1:18:16] which was the husband's wife and she
[1:18:18] comes out and is raking him over the
[1:18:21] coals.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; She was giving him what FOR YOU YOUNG
[1:18:24] PEOPLE JUST THINK YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
[1:18:27] you want to do. you think you can run us
[1:18:29] old people over? And brother Brown was
[1:18:31] trying to tell her, he said, "Sister,"
[1:18:32] he said, "I I I I didn't mean anything
[1:18:35] by it. I'm sorry. I I I I maybe I should
[1:18:37] have just come when your husband was
[1:18:38] around. I I I because he's the one that
[1:18:41] I I've talked to and I Well, you just
[1:18:43] think you can do whatever and you have
[1:18:45] no rights to be on this land. And he
[1:18:47] said, "But but your husband, he he
[1:18:49] actually he's the one that gave me
[1:18:50] rights." And she SAID, "WELL, YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:52] COMING UP THIS LAND." HE SAID, "BUT IF I
[1:18:53] DRIVE IN THE FIELD over there," he said,
[1:18:56] "the car's going to get stuck." Boy, she
[1:18:59] would just going on and on as Brother
[1:19:01] Ram ties it and and goes into it and
[1:19:03] talks about it and finally says, "I'm
[1:19:05] just a minister." He said, "I I'm
[1:19:06] sorry." He said, "That I've that I that
[1:19:08] I've done this." He said, "I'm ashamed
[1:19:10] of myself." He said, "I I'm sorry I
[1:19:12] DISTURBED YOU. I WOULDN'T have done it
[1:19:14] for nothing in the world. And all you
[1:19:16] young people just think you can run
[1:19:18] right over us." And he said, 'N no doubt
[1:19:20] there's been many that's done that in
[1:19:21] this neighborhood, but sister, we're
[1:19:23] Christians. I and I'm just I don't live
[1:19:25] here. I'm just working here. She said,
[1:19:28] you're a reverend. He said, "Yes,
[1:19:30] ma'am." "What' you say your name was?"
[1:19:33] "My name is Brandham." "Are you brother
[1:19:36] Brandham?" "Yes,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; forgive me." Brother Brandham says her
[1:19:40] chin start quivering.
[1:19:43] She said, "Forgive me. I'm a backsliden
[1:19:46] Methodist. I'm ashamed of the way I
[1:19:49] acted. God bless you, sister. Go back to
[1:19:52] church. Won't you serve the Lord Jesus?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam SAID, "SEE, IF YOU JUMPED
[1:19:58] OUT THERE AND STARTED FUSSING AT HER
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; AND TELLING HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE A RIGHT
[1:20:04] AND SO FORTH," he said, "See, just a few
[1:20:06] words of love went down to the heart."
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Let's get people
[1:20:11] inside the veil."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That's how we conquer, he says, is by
[1:20:15] love. SO JUST A FEW WORDS of love.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam did not take an occasion to
[1:20:24] the flesh.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; This is where the scripture deals with
[1:20:27] the conformity to the image of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ. For whom he did forno he also
[1:20:33] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:20:36] image of his son that he might be the
[1:20:38] firstborn among many brethren. And to
[1:20:42] THINK THIS IS WHAT this conforming is
[1:20:44] not not something this very word it's
[1:20:47] not something that is just what is on
[1:20:49] the outside or the outward form but it
[1:20:52] actually deals with the substance of
[1:20:55] character and the only thing that can
[1:20:57] produce this character is the very life
[1:21:01] of Jesus Christ that comes by the new
[1:21:04] birth and the prophet says it's a mess
[1:21:07] anyway it comes but what kind of life
[1:21:09] does it produce? It produces servant
[1:21:12] life to humble yourself and deny
[1:21:15] yourself. That's the kind OF LIFE. IT
[1:21:19] MAKES A SERVANT out of you. It takes the
[1:21:21] starch out of you. It makes an image
[1:21:24] molding a new life, a new creation. OH,
[1:21:26] YOU MIGHT BE ALL MESSED UP WHEN YOU GET
[1:21:28] UP, but you're born again. And no matter
[1:21:31] where you are, it makes a new life. It
[1:21:34] brings a new image life. IT MAKES A
[1:21:37] SERVANT OUT OF YOU. you want to serve
[1:21:40] them.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted us to serve one another.
[1:21:44] Love one another as we serve one
[1:21:46] another. We serve him.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram goes on to tell us the
[1:21:50] very next quote. He said, "It's only the
[1:21:53] sick that demand attention."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Those that he says that as they would
[1:21:59] constantly needing attention and you
[1:22:02] know uh making a show and going about
[1:22:04] things, he said they need attention.
[1:22:06] They need the attention of the spirit of
[1:22:09] Christ by way of the new birth.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; See, THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN us will not
[1:22:17] cause a scene.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; This is where it produces a real a real
[1:22:30] servant life in our lives. Now, I want
[1:22:33] you to think of this particular thing
[1:22:35] right here. this scripture.
[1:22:37] Look not every man on his own things
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; or we could say be selfabsorbed
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; but every man also on the things of
[1:22:51] others. Now sometimes I understand even
[1:22:55] in the natural parts of life a person
[1:22:59] could be in this kind of a frame and yet
[1:23:02] not even be spiritfilled. They just have
[1:23:04] a tendency to I want to help this. I
[1:23:06] want to help this. I want to do this.
[1:23:08] But this is talking about with the life
[1:23:11] of Christ on the inside. It's talking
[1:23:13] about more than helping just somebody
[1:23:15] build a shed. But however, maybe you're
[1:23:17] helping build that shed to be able to
[1:23:19] have fellowship and to help that brother
[1:23:21] along. Maybe you're helping to do
[1:23:23] something in order to win them to
[1:23:25] Christ. But yet within this, it's not to
[1:23:28] be self-absorbed. And yet sometimes
[1:23:30] depending on how that our makeup is and
[1:23:32] the way things could go, we can become
[1:23:34] so self-absorbed. And like the picture
[1:23:36] depicts it right there very clearly.
[1:23:38] Here you have the young man on one side
[1:23:40] and he's in his own world.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Totally oblivious to a person having a
[1:23:47] troubled world.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:23:55] You know, brother Brandham brings this
[1:23:56] into this place of how that Jesus never
[1:23:58] lived for himself.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; He lived for others. And brother
[1:24:05] Brandham deals with this on that day on
[1:24:07] Calvary and how that eternal life itself
[1:24:12] is living for others. Right
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; now when we understand this this is we
[1:24:19] we understand and I I don't think I
[1:24:21] would have to say this but this is
[1:24:23] deeper than just giving fruit baskets to
[1:24:26] somebody
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; it's deeper than just you know going and
[1:24:31] you know shoveling somebody's driveway.
[1:24:33] ALL THOSE THINGS ARE ARE GOOD AND I'M
[1:24:35] NOT dismissing those. But what we're
[1:24:38] saying is is that it's not works that
[1:24:42] gain us entrance or I've done this or I
[1:24:46] I've helped out here. That's not it.
[1:24:49] Remember, brother Ram tells us in the
[1:24:50] adoption series, he said the hybrid can
[1:24:54] outwork the thoroughbred any day.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT ABOUT outworking
[1:25:02] this eternal life of living for others.
[1:25:05] It yes is ministering to others with and
[1:25:09] under the leadership of eternal life.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; It's seeing value. It's living beyond
[1:25:16] our self. Living beyond just, you know,
[1:25:18] well, I punched in and I've I fulfilled
[1:25:20] my duty and punched in and we punch out.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; SO NOW LOOK AT THIS. YOU KNOW, BROTHER
[1:25:27] BRANDON brings this out, you know,
[1:25:28] because he goes into this depth of this.
[1:25:31] He says, "Now you know that living for
[1:25:32] others," he said, "when you receive that
[1:25:35] eternal life, that day in your life, you
[1:25:37] don't live for yourself no more. You
[1:25:38] live for others." He said, "Someone
[1:25:40] asked me, he said, "How can you stand to
[1:25:42] let anybody call you such bad names? You
[1:25:45] don't live for yourself. You live for
[1:25:47] others that you might redeem that man.
[1:25:51] You become sons." And he said, "The
[1:25:54] trouble of it is THE CHURCH HAS FORGOT
[1:25:56] they were sons. You're a son. You're
[1:25:58] taking Christ's place. You're a son. So
[1:26:01] don't live for yourself, live for
[1:26:05] others.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; See the life that we live, the the
[1:26:09] consistency. Let me tell you, even when
[1:26:12] among your family,
[1:26:14] remember brother tells us in the token,
[1:26:16] he said, "Let them see it in you. It
[1:26:19] it'll take an effect. Let them see it in
[1:26:22] you. It will take an effect."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Right? It's seeing that life that that
[1:26:29] life on display, that consistency. It
[1:26:32] doesn't matter. Let me just say this to
[1:26:34] you. We in ourselves, I I believe that
[1:26:37] we can so go through and and I believe
[1:26:40] friends in studying the word of God, BUT
[1:26:43] THERE'S GOT TO BE a life that's on
[1:26:47] display. Right.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE GREATEST IMPACT and
[1:26:52] influence on the lives of our family on
[1:26:55] OUR CHILDREN IS THE DISPLAY of token
[1:26:58] life.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; NOT HOW MANY QUOTES WE KNOW YET. I
[1:27:02] BELIEVE IN GIVING OURSELVES TO THE WORD.
[1:27:04] IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MANY SCRIPTURES WE
[1:27:06] KNOW YET. I BELIEVE IN GETTING INTO THE
[1:27:09] WORD OF GOD. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:27:12] LIFE THAT'S THERE BECAUSE THE LETTER
[1:27:14] [screaming] KLETH BUT THE SPIRIT GIVETH
[1:27:17] LIFE. AMEN.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN A MAN IS AT REST, LISTEN TO
[1:27:21] ME. WHEN A MAN IS AT REST WITH GOD, HE
[1:27:24] DOES NOT RELY upon anything
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; but the Lord.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT WORKING TO TRY TO PROVE
[1:27:34] HIMSELF. OH MY, I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T done
[1:27:36] this in a while and I got to I got to
[1:27:38] lay hands on this one or I got to I got
[1:27:39] to go preach this or I got to GO DO
[1:27:41] THIS. HE'S NOT RESTING ON ANY OF THOSE
[1:27:43] WORKS. I'M TALKING ABOUT A MAN THAT IS
[1:27:45] AT REST IS IN A POSITION TO BE ONE FOR A
[1:27:49] CHANNEL OF ATMOSPHERE change to come in
[1:27:52] his life
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; IN HIS HOME TO INFLUENCE OTHERS CUZ
[1:27:56] YOU'RE AT REST in your life and in your
[1:27:59] walk. That's a relationship with God.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That is so good. Beautiful.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; That's what God's called us to. That's
[1:28:07] why for every every husband, every every
[1:28:09] every man is to be at a rest in his life
[1:28:13] and his walk and standing because as the
[1:28:15] children even come along, they're going
[1:28:17] to go through brother Bram had it right
[1:28:19] in his own home. HE SAID THEY FIRST HAVE
[1:28:21] THOSE ADOLESCENT YEARS.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And he said it like this in THE
[1:28:24] BEGINNING OF INDICTMENT. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:28:26] suffer with them.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. Suffer with not kill them. Suffer
[1:28:33] with them.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:35] BUT YOU HAVE TO IN DOING THAT BECAUSE
[1:28:37] WHY? IT'S A SEASON.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S A TIME. IT'S A NURTURING. IT'S A
[1:28:43] WALKING WITH THEM. IT'S A COMING AND
[1:28:45] KEEPING THEM IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND
[1:28:48] LETTING CHRIST BE THE CENTER THERE even
[1:28:50] in your life and in your home. NOW,
[1:28:52] BROTHER BRANDHAM GOES ON TO SAY IT like
[1:28:53] this. He says, "WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[1:28:55] I can live for this brother cuz he sure
[1:28:58] is a nice man. Yeah,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT AIN'T IT.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; LIVE FOR THAT MAN who hates you.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; For that person would kill you if they
[1:29:11] could.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's what they did to him. They killed
[1:29:15] him and he died that he might save them.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You mean God would would
[1:29:22] would would call us to that. That's what
[1:29:25] the spirit of Christ will produce in our
[1:29:27] lives. Yes.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; This is not what we have to produce.
[1:29:30] This is what the spirit of Christ calls
[1:29:32] us to.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; It's something that he brings us to this
[1:29:35] place of death to self to where the
[1:29:39] reflection becomes in our heart. What
[1:29:41] more could I have done? What more could
[1:29:43] I do? Lord, help me to try to understand
[1:29:45] cuz a brother or sister even the
[1:29:47] responses sometimes that can be coming.
[1:29:49] It's not even really what's wrong.
[1:29:53] It's things that's underneath. Right?
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; It's things that's underneath the
[1:29:57] clouds.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; But notice brother Ram says Christ
[1:30:02] himself so completely surrendered his
[1:30:05] life to God. He gave himself as a public
[1:30:09] servant to the people. He gave his life
[1:30:12] freely. He didn't have to do it. He
[1:30:14] didn't He didn't begrudgingly do it. He
[1:30:16] didn't say, "Now you, brethren, you
[1:30:18] ought to think a whole lot of me because
[1:30:20] I come to die for you."
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; He never said a word about it. He died
[1:30:24] anyhow because it was God in him and
[1:30:27] it's God in you. It's God in me that
[1:30:29] makes us look at others.
[1:30:35] It's God in us.
[1:30:37] Let me just run through a few scriptures
[1:30:39] here.
[1:30:41] The scripture tells us in the in there
[1:30:44] right down to the bottom verse 10 of
[1:30:45] Galatians 6. As we therefore
[1:30:49] have opportunity,
[1:30:51] let us good do good unto all men,
[1:30:54] especially
[1:30:56] unto them who are of the household of
[1:31:00] faith.
[1:31:02] Paul would go on and write in Hebrews
[1:31:04] 6:10, "God is not unrighteous to forget
[1:31:07] your work and labor of love, which you
[1:31:11] have showed toward his name, in that you
[1:31:15] ministered to the saints
[1:31:18] and do minister."
[1:31:23] I would say that here we are in this
[1:31:25] hour, if there was ever an age and ever
[1:31:28] a time that would have to battle being
[1:31:31] self-absorbed.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say this to you.
[1:31:37] Moses became selfabsorbed
[1:31:41] in the work of the Lord and he neglected
[1:31:45] to circumcise
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; his child.
[1:31:51] So a person can be I'm so absorbed
[1:31:53] within the things of God and their
[1:31:56] family is left.
[1:32:01] Their family is just well where have you
[1:32:03] been? Their family is left. Well, I've
[1:32:05] been doing the work of the Lord.
[1:32:08] I think from my wife. What about of the
[1:32:10] times that many times I can I can get
[1:32:12] maybe a call will come in here or a
[1:32:13] text. Brother Sam, you do got you have a
[1:32:15] few moments, you know, I'm I'm closing
[1:32:17] out of here and I'm I'm departing at a
[1:32:19] certain time and I I I can call at that
[1:32:20] time or or this and sometimes calling
[1:32:22] and then leaving all the way out of
[1:32:24] here. And I'm not begrudging this. I
[1:32:26] want you to understand something. But
[1:32:28] even when that has happened, the thing
[1:32:29] that I want to do, because a lot of
[1:32:31] times for our dinner, it's usually late
[1:32:33] and I can let her know, honey, just go
[1:32:35] ahead, y'all go ahead and eat. Put mine
[1:32:37] in the microwave. She knows then what's
[1:32:41] taking place.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER SAMUEL, DO YOU HAVE TO
[1:32:46] DO THAT?" NO. But neither do I want her
[1:32:48] worrying.
[1:32:50] Neither do I want the rest of of the
[1:32:52] evening to be in that place where a
[1:32:55] tenseness or what not that she's ever
[1:32:56] going to get mad at me and throw
[1:32:58] tomatoes and whatever more.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S
[1:33:02] A CARE.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST SIMPLE CARE. IT'S NOT BECOMING
[1:33:07] SO ABSORBED. BUT LISTEN, WHAT IF my
[1:33:11] security
[1:33:13] was my ministry?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Here we go. What if all that I was
[1:33:21] was my ministry?
[1:33:26] What a sad thing that would be.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; That'd be like having a nice looking
[1:33:31] suit. It's actually no character on the
[1:33:35] inside of it then.
[1:33:38] But but if IT'S SO SELF-ABSORBED BECAUSE
[1:33:41] THIS IS WHAT A PERSON is basing
[1:33:44] everything on. This is THIS IS WHAT THEY
[1:33:46] ARE. THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. LISTEN, MY
[1:33:47] GIFT is not who I am. I am not Oh, I
[1:33:51] know some been different ones. Oh,
[1:33:52] brother Samuel a minister and THIS AND
[1:33:54] THAT. I'M NOT. THAT'S NOT ME. MY GIFT IS
[1:33:57] NOT ME.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; If my gift is me, that is shallow
[1:34:02] Christianity.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT KNOWN BY OUR GIFT
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; OR GIFTS IN OUR LIFE, SINGING, WHATEVER.
[1:34:12] WHAT WE ARE KNOWN BY IS THE SPIRIT OF
[1:34:15] CHRIST IN OUR LIFE AND OUR REST IS IN HE
[1:34:19] has made me free.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And then we become channels
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; that he can move through. Because if
[1:34:28] crisis arise and I'm not having a good
[1:34:31] day, things aren't going just exactly
[1:34:34] right and I feel like things are in
[1:34:35] haywire. I want to ask you to raise your
[1:34:37] hand. But everybody has those kind of
[1:34:38] days where you feel like everything's
[1:34:40] just been a a haven, man, just coming
[1:34:42] from all all sides and all angles. But
[1:34:45] yet here you are called to come in as a
[1:34:47] priest into your home. Here you are as a
[1:34:50] as a sister, as a brother, and you come
[1:34:53] in. Here you are sitting right here
[1:34:54] tonight, even even in this place and and
[1:34:58] in the house of God and all of the
[1:35:00] battles and things of life and where all
[1:35:02] of this HAS COME TO. AND YET YOU HAVE A
[1:35:05] CHOICE RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. YOU HAD A
[1:35:08] CHOICE THAT YOU COULD SAY, YOU KNOW
[1:35:09] WHAT? I have worked all day.
[1:35:13] I think I'll just sit home and stream.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; I'm so tired.
[1:35:23] I think I'll just
[1:35:26] I need to sit in the lazy boy and listen
[1:35:28] to brother Samuel.
[1:35:31] But what if we needed your amen right
[1:35:34] here?
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; SEE IT ACTUALLY COMING TO THE HOUSE OF
[1:35:38] GOD. THE PROPHET SAYS, "YOU bring your
[1:35:41] strength
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; AND YOU STRENGTHEN OTHERS."
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; PAUL WROTE IT JUST LIKE THIS WHEN HE
[1:35:48] SAID in the scriptures, I'm just going
[1:35:50] to skip on down here. Paul wrote it
[1:35:52] within this manner when he said to you
[1:35:55] and I that let us consider one another
[1:35:58] to provoke unto love and to good works.
[1:36:02] DO YOU REALIZE JUST THE CON JUST THE
[1:36:04] CONSTANCY? I'm not begging for a crowd
[1:36:06] to preach to.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I preach to crowds. What I'm ministering
[1:36:11] to is sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. I'M
[1:36:13] TRYING I'M TRYING WITH EVERYTHING WITHIN
[1:36:16] ME TO GIVE MYSELF TO GOD THAT WE CAN GET
[1:36:19] READY TO GET OUT OF HERE. AND LET ME
[1:36:21] TELL YOU, YOU'VE GOT TO BE WANTING TO
[1:36:22] GET OUT OF HERE. GOD AIN'T GOING TO COME
[1:36:24] TO YOUR HOME, PULL YOU OUT OF YOUR HOME,
[1:36:25] AND TAKE YOU INTO RAPTURE.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN YOUR
[1:36:30] HEART THAT YOU LONG AND ARE LIVING FOR
[1:36:33] HIS COMING.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; AND PART OF THAT IS A SACRIFICE THAT WE
[1:36:38] make in assembling ourselves together.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God don't come and hog tie us out and
[1:36:44] bring us all in here together, BUT THIS
[1:36:47] IS A SACRIFICE RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. A
[1:36:49] SACRIFICE THAT IS made to come to the
[1:36:52] house of God. And then even when YOU GET
[1:36:53] HERE, IT'S A sacrifice to go beyond how
[1:36:56] YOU FEEL. IT'S A SACRIFICE TO raise your
[1:36:58] hands. IT'S A SACRIFICE. YES. SOMETIMES
[1:37:01] IT JUST, MAN, IT'S SO EASY. IT'S LIKE
[1:37:03] THE SONG LEADER. HE GETS UP AND SAYS
[1:37:05] ONLY. AND BOOM, MAN. IT JUST EXPLODES
[1:37:08] LIKE THAT. THAT WAS NOT THE PIANO. THAT
[1:37:10] WAS NOT THE SONG LEADER. IT'S JUST YOU
[1:37:13] CAME EXPECTING.
[1:37:15] AND THEN THERE'S OTHER TIMES THERE MIGHT
[1:37:17] BE THIS ONE DOWN AND THIS ONE, YOU KNOW,
[1:37:19] IS UP AND THIS ONE'S DOWN. BUT WHAT DO
[1:37:21] WE DO? WE COME TOGETHER AND THOSE THAT
[1:37:24] ARE UP, WE COME TO UNITE OUR FAITH
[1:37:27] TOGETHER AND STRENGTH THAT CHRIST
[1:37:29] HIMSELF MIGHT COME AND MINISTER to our
[1:37:32] needs.
[1:37:33] I wonder,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; if we walk away from a service, well,
[1:37:40] that was just for, you know,
[1:37:44] justification.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You might want to pay attention
[1:37:50] because you might need justification.
[1:37:53] Right.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And then again, there's also times WHERE
[1:37:56] GOD WILL DEAL WITH THINGS within a
[1:37:59] service THAT NECESSARILY MAYBE THE BULK
[1:38:02] OF THAT SERVICE was not even for maybe
[1:38:04] the bulk of that congregation THAT'S
[1:38:06] THERE. AND GOD MIGHT HAVE focused on
[1:38:08] just one need within that congregation.
[1:38:11] Can you all get behind that and say,
[1:38:12] "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO USE
[1:38:14] THIS FOR AN occasion to the flesh to
[1:38:16] JUST SIT HERE AND FALL ASLEEP AND LET MY
[1:38:18] MIND JUST WANDER. BUT I'M GOING TO GET
[1:38:20] IN AND I'M GOING TO PULL ON THE GIFT OF
[1:38:22] GOD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE BORN
[1:38:24] AGAIN. I KNOW WHERE GOD TOOK ME FROM. I
[1:38:26] KNOW THE LIBERTY THAT HE'S BROUGHT IN MY
[1:38:28] LIFE. AND IF THERE'S ONE SITTING HERE
[1:38:30] TONIGHT OR TOMORROW MORNING OR WHENEVER
[1:38:32] THAT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THAT, BOY, I
[1:38:34] WANT THEM TO EXPERIENCE WHAT I'VE
[1:38:36] EXPERIENCED. BE A PART OF SOMETHING
[1:38:39] BIGGER THAN YOUR OWN LITTLE WORLD.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:43] AMEN.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; OUT ON ME. HELP ME, LORD JESUS.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; No wonder. No wonder. Let me close on
[1:38:59] this point here. It just moved down
[1:39:01] through many of these. Paul would write
[1:39:04] about how that even in his own life
[1:39:07] of how that he said, "I've offered upon
[1:39:10] the sacrifice and service of your
[1:39:12] faith."
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; His whole life was spent
[1:39:17] to help somebody else along the way.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Paul would also write, "We are helpers
[1:39:24] of your joy." We're helping your joy.
[1:39:28] How many you remember in the scripture
[1:39:29] in the book of acts Dorcas
[1:39:32] Tabatha
[1:39:34] same person brother actually refers to
[1:39:38] sister Bruce as the Dorcas of old
[1:39:42] and Dorcas she made these coats
[1:39:46] all of these things for people
[1:39:49] you don't know Dorcas as Dorcas I tell
[1:39:51] you what Dorcas was Dorcas was the one
[1:39:54] when everybody fellowshipped she had the
[1:39:56] for that's not what Dorcas was known as.
[1:39:59] DORCAS, I TELL YOU WHAT, SHE WAS SUCH A
[1:40:01] SPIRITUAL WOMAN, SHE COULD TIE THINGS
[1:40:03] TOGETHER BACK AND FORTH. That's not what
[1:40:05] it says.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; But you know what Dorcas did? She
[1:40:09] recognized her part in the body.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Her part, it was something that moved in
[1:40:15] her heart to do things for others. You
[1:40:18] know, friends, I think what would be
[1:40:19] such a blessing is if we didn't have to
[1:40:21] ask, but even we could say, "What can I
[1:40:25] do?"
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; What can I do?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; What can I do to help? I've had my I've
[1:40:30] had my own boys come to me here. They
[1:40:31] they see me saying, "Dad, what can I
[1:40:33] help to make it easier on you?
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Is there something I can do for you,
[1:40:36] Dad? There's something I can I can I can
[1:40:38] take? Is there something that that that
[1:40:40] can be done?" Now, I'm just saying,
[1:40:42] can't we just ask God that, Lord? Is
[1:40:44] there something that's beyond just my
[1:40:46] own little
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; sphere?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Is there something more that I can do?
[1:40:54] It may not be something that would seem
[1:40:56] so spiritual, but yet if it has to do
[1:40:59] for the body of Christ,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; even when it comes to making sure
[1:41:03] sidewalks are cleared,
[1:41:06] I come over here at at times and well,
[1:41:08] I'm over here through the week. I come
[1:41:10] on here at different times. See, see the
[1:41:12] brother just going right there, right on
[1:41:15] the right on the lawnmower, taking care
[1:41:16] of the different things.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Just just simple simple things. Simple
[1:41:20] things. But you know what? I'm glad the
[1:41:22] grass is cut,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it is. I'm glad that, you know,
[1:41:27] things get get taken care of. I'm glad
[1:41:28] of that.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for those things. I know
[1:41:32] they're not really spiritual,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; but they still have a great impact. But
[1:41:36] and that's not for everybody, you know,
[1:41:37] showing up with shovels because we don't
[1:41:39] want to be a bunch of state workers
[1:41:40] where we're all leaning on shovels
[1:41:42] either, you [laughter] know. So, we
[1:41:43] don't want to, you know, you have to get
[1:41:45] a West Virginia driver's license to do
[1:41:46] that. But, you know, you you you you
[1:41:48] want to be able to say, Lord, what would
[1:41:50] you have me do?
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID PAUL SAY? LORD, what would you
[1:41:53] have me do?
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And I want to do something beyond my
[1:41:56] duty.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; We want to do something beyond our duty.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:42:05] My my thank you, father.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[1:42:14] Lord Jesus.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:42:21] help us, Lord.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, I I don't want to take
[1:42:26] even a moment that this would pass
[1:42:30] pass me by, pass this congregation by,
[1:42:34] Lord.
[1:42:36] But to ask you, Lord God, for your
[1:42:38] mercy. I there's many things, Lord, that
[1:42:41] even you've drawn my attention to, Lord,
[1:42:43] even over the time. and things that Lord
[1:42:45] that even that I hadn't even considered
[1:42:50] and looked at.
[1:42:52] But Father, you've not only drawn my
[1:42:54] attention to me. You've drawn it to my
[1:42:57] attention, but how you've corrected me.
[1:42:58] And I'm so grateful for that, Lord.
[1:43:01] Oh God, how it it always just saddens my
[1:43:04] heart when I can see, Lord, that some
[1:43:08] way along that I failed you. I've let
[1:43:11] you down.
[1:43:13] And how how could that be?
[1:43:16] But I thank Lord of the Scriptures where
[1:43:18] you always always take it. For what
[1:43:21] you've done unto the least of these,
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; my brethren, you've done it unto me,
[1:43:28] Lord. Help us, every one of us. Lord,
[1:43:30] we're living in an age. We are living in
[1:43:33] an age that is is self-absorbed.
[1:43:36] We're living in an age, Lord, that Lord
[1:43:40] God, we see everything is about me and
[1:43:43] self and I. This this is an anointing we
[1:43:46] realize that's around us. But Father,
[1:43:51] we've received a kingdom that cannot be
[1:43:53] moved.
[1:43:55] So I pray Lord that you would you would
[1:43:58] help us Lord tonight. There's no way
[1:44:00] Lord that even Lord in a service like
[1:44:03] this that we could even go through many
[1:44:07] different examples and things Lord I
[1:44:09] have many Lord much more laying here
[1:44:11] before me but yet Father I know we only
[1:44:14] have so much time. So Lord, I'm asking
[1:44:17] that you would so help us Lord to take
[1:44:20] take in the word and to really to ask
[1:44:23] you Lord help me what you're what you're
[1:44:25] speaking about. Lord I servant life and
[1:44:28] Lord I that's my heart's desire. Help me
[1:44:31] Lord. How can I be a help
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; to your people Lord? How can I Lord be a
[1:44:36] help to my brothers and to my sisters
[1:44:39] Lord Jesus may you Lord lead me and
[1:44:42] guide me. Lord God, help us, Lord. I
[1:44:44] pray in our lives, Lord, with even in
[1:44:47] our homes, Lord, as husbands and wives
[1:44:51] and Lord God, with our children, Lord,
[1:44:54] among our young people, Lord, help us,
[1:44:56] Father. I thank dear God, that
[1:45:00] Lord Jesus, even as we're standing right
[1:45:02] here,
[1:45:05] there's many, Lord, that have went on
[1:45:08] went on home to be with you,
[1:45:11] Lord God. Even some of the very
[1:45:13] beginnings of this assembly as they
[1:45:16] labored
[1:45:18] many Lord God as they even opened their
[1:45:21] homes they did the things that Lord that
[1:45:23] you led them to do in that time
[1:45:26] and Father how that you Lord so worked
[1:45:30] through that Lord God to minister to
[1:45:32] others to disciple along the way
[1:45:37] Lord sometimes with discipling
[1:45:41] a new believer.
[1:45:45] It's something, Lord, that's not always
[1:45:48] something that's overnight. As a matter
[1:45:50] of fact,
[1:45:52] when we can think back to our own life
[1:45:55] and every one of our lives are so
[1:45:56] different,
[1:45:58] but to remember Lord that there were
[1:46:00] hearts who took us under their wings
[1:46:06] and they would just just speak about
[1:46:09] speak about you.
[1:46:13] Cuz there's many things, Lord, sometimes
[1:46:15] in terminology that even new converts do
[1:46:18] not understand.
[1:46:21] But Lord God, they've understood the
[1:46:24] presence of God that has so dealt with
[1:46:26] their life to bring conviction.
[1:46:30] Help us, Lord, in our lives
[1:46:34] that Lord,
[1:46:36] we can bring Jesus on the scene.
[1:46:40] Lord God to be a help Lord to someone
[1:46:43] else along the way maybe Lord as a
[1:46:46] brother Lord to a brother a family to a
[1:46:50] family to be an encouragement Lord help
[1:46:52] us and Lord when I read that as your
[1:46:55] prophet said I was tired when he talked
[1:46:58] about that situation going on in his
[1:47:00] home my I don't know how many times Lord
[1:47:04] I preached from that quote
[1:47:07] but it was last year about August when I
[1:47:09] was getting ready for a banquet
[1:47:11] And I was reading back over that quote
[1:47:12] and my goodness, it's like it jumped off
[1:47:14] the page at me. I already had it right
[1:47:16] in my outline, but that jumped right off
[1:47:19] the page. I was tired.
[1:47:22] He was wore out. But the question, I
[1:47:25] love the question. Lord, what would you
[1:47:27] have me be
[1:47:29] in this moment?
[1:47:34] Oh God, help us.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; We want to know, Lord, that's how we
[1:47:39] look to you. What would you have us be
[1:47:41] in this moment,
[1:47:43] Lord God? We have, Lord, the jobs. We
[1:47:45] have all these things that we have to
[1:47:47] attend to. My goodness, it seems like,
[1:47:49] Lord, sometimes it's just things just
[1:47:51] pouring in left and right.
[1:47:55] But God, help us.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Would you help us, Lord?
[1:48:01] Give us the strength that we need. Lord,
[1:48:03] help us as we have opportunity. Lord,
[1:48:06] help us to be able to minister
[1:48:09] to one another. For who is my neighbor?
[1:48:12] One that I see in need. Maybe they're in
[1:48:16] need of a kind word and encouragement.
[1:48:20] If we could do that toward all men and
[1:48:23] especially as Paul said to those of the
[1:48:24] household of faith, help us, Lord.
[1:48:28] This is the kind of this is the kind of
[1:48:31] people that we want to be.
[1:48:34] those Lord, like the prophet said,
[1:48:38] we can't wait to get in here and
[1:48:39] fellowship with our brothers and
[1:48:40] sisters.
[1:48:42] Oh, I know, Lord. We're every one of us,
[1:48:45] Lord, we're there's pockets of us that's
[1:48:47] alike, pockets that's different, and
[1:48:49] everything else, but you didn't want us
[1:48:51] to all be alike.
[1:48:53] But father, it's through all of this
[1:48:55] that you
[1:48:58] manifest
[1:49:00] your glory,
[1:49:02] showing the love of God that it the love
[1:49:04] of God in our [music] heart.
[1:49:09] The love for the brotherhood is greater,
[1:49:14] is greater than oursel.
[1:49:18] Help us, Lord.
[1:49:20] Lord Jesus,
[1:49:22] I've got my hands up, Lord. I ask you,
[1:49:25] Lord, God, help me, Lord. Lord, for
[1:49:28] truly, Lord God, when we would look at
[1:49:31] this an occasion to the flesh, an
[1:49:34] opportunity sometimes, Lord, just even
[1:49:37] in ourselves, Lord God, we may not even
[1:49:39] see it in that way. But here tonight,
[1:49:42] help us, Lord.
[1:49:45] Help us. May we not, Lord, give love
[1:49:47] based on who deserves it. Because if
[1:49:50] that was the case,
[1:49:52] we'd have never got it because we never
[1:49:55] deserved it. But Lord Jesus, many times,
[1:49:59] Lord God, I know that projecting of
[1:50:02] love, we can look and say, "Well, this
[1:50:04] this this life needs change. They need
[1:50:06] this and they need that. But let's
[1:50:08] project the love of God. Let's speak to
[1:50:10] them in love.
[1:50:12] Get them in the place and the prince of
[1:50:13] God where God can do something for them.
[1:50:16] Cuz if there's anything to ever be done
[1:50:17] in their life, it'll take God to do it.
[1:50:20] Help us, Lord. [music]
[1:50:24] Forgive us, Lord. Forgive me.
[1:50:27] Forgive us, Lord. I pray
[1:50:30] of these, Lord, and times, Lord, where
[1:50:32] we have fallen short. But help us to be
[1:50:35] sensitive.
[1:50:37] Help us to be mindful.
[1:50:40] We love you and we thank you
[1:50:43] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:49] Go ahead.
[1:50:55] Little [singing] is much.
[1:50:57] If God is in it,
[1:51:01] labor [singing]
[1:51:02] not
[1:51:03] for wealth, for fame.

[1:54:15] gods only care.
