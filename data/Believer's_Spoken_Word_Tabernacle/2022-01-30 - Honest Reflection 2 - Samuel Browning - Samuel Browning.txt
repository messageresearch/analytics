it's a joy just to stand here and just to to bring the word of the lord as god would lay it up on our hearts and um i'm getting like a crackling in here it's it's it's probably not you but where's benjamin we're back in my office and inside of there i don't want to hand him and i want to stutter give me get the lapel underneath in that cabinet put some new batteries let's go with this one right here it seems like you know but uh i'm just not one of those guys that feels real comfortable with that and i'll do it if it's if it's better on my monitors i've done it some places i've preached because it's better on the monitors but i'm still getting that think it's this speaker my goodness hey well we're not going to let the enemy take away from this if i got to preach without a pa system i'll do it today if i have to come down there and preach we'll do it amen i can use it now [Laughter] quick play the music so we we can move chairs right now i know you probably think brother samuel while you put your coat back on you're going to take it off a little bit well i'm a little i always get a little cold i can't help it i'm cold at first when i start to get the engine warmed up a little bit here so let's read in haggai chapter one verse one and don't worry i'm there's no sickness or whatever more i just get come out of my office at home and i come out of there and i walk out of the office i say oh my goodness man i feel cold everybody feeling good amen let's just let's look here into the word of the lord and just want to say i appreciate the song service and brother bill was singing that song i knew better than even try it i know the song but you know it's one thing to know the song and for me to try to go through it but i love the words to that song and and i just appreciate them you know just just trying to move that along and um let's just let's look here at haggai chapter one and i'm just going to read two verses of scripture then we'll let you be seated in haggai 1 1 it says in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first year of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shatil governor of judah and to joshua the son of joseph the high priest saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not come the time that the lord's house should be built amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want you to notice how the scriptures lord jesus so lord jesus as we stand here god united with our brother lord you see father that the lord just exactly what the lord has been through here more even more with your surgery how would you have brought them through such grace and such strength the lord the father who we lord stand here o god is a people of god lord when it comes to taking our promised land sometimes lord we need help one from another lord so we stand right here together lord uniting our faith together lord for you say lord if two or three can agree is touching any one thing it shall be done not satan in the name of jesus christ you that would want to bring this weariness i charge you in the name of the lord jesus christ and i rebuke you you must take your hands off and flee in the name of the lord jesus christ and lord i ask that god that you would move lord to give such strength the lord a consolation o god in this moment i pray father for lord you are our peace and lord we speak peace in the name of jesus christ so satan hold your peace in the name of jesus christ [Applause] i want to just say as we look at this here in the scripture i want to god will help us to continue with this thought on honest reflections these are really some these are familiar passages probably to most of us and even as bible readers i've you know that those of you here over the years sometimes i've ministered a series out of this whole part about the restoration and the restoring back into the land where israel had went into captivity and then they were promised by god that he would visit him after 70 years and i just just you know last week we we took the thought on this of honest reflections and begin to deal with how that daniel knowing the time was drawing nigh was about at the 68 year mark and he he could read in the book but you know it's something about it that it goes much deeper than just us reading something begins to stir us in that time you know there's things that you and i can't explain sometimes as a believers things just start to stir you to start to move you and that's the thing that if you'll think in this moment where brother branham will take us of how the israel is moved by natural national forces back into the homeland but he says it is the spirit of the living god who puts the people in the bride so we know that national forces will have to get that has to get israel back in there and that that's been going on but once they get back in there it's going to take it'll take the coming of the holy ghost and god will come in that message of the true atonement through moses and elijah to point them to that of the true atonement and that they might be sealed away that 144 thousand but i want to just as a draw to this here and this was really the a part of it how god was just pressing on my heart here just a few weeks ago and sometimes you know you just don't know how uh you just the thought just drops and how everything begins to come together but i want to draw this this here in haggai 1. this is after the people have already come into the land and i'm going to give you a timeline here in just a moment but i want you to notice in verse 1 and verse 2 that here is haggai the prophet and haggai is not coming with a new message but haggai is being moved by the spirit of god in this moment because the people are saying that the time is not come the time that the lord's house should be built and to think this is a discernment this is why we must have the living word of god the word of god the letter is wonderful but without the spirit of god the letter killeth right amen jesus could stand before the pharisees in that hour the religious and say search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that are testifying of me and we know that when the word comes the word comes it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart every time you can read clear from the very beginning uh you know even as the spirit of god will take us clear back to the fall that took and took place in heaven and then coming down into the garden and on and on we find that the word of god every time that god begins to bring his word in that season it is god that word comes and brings discernment and that discernment is necessary and the only people that are going to be a partaker of that discernment and really receive it are those whom the word is actually intended for many will hear it brother brown would say it like this it's broadcast to many but there are those that's ordained to life and not that they in themselves or we in ourselves were perfect but we needed the discernment of the spirit of god to break those conditions that was from around us it wouldn't matter if you were in you know in a church and thank god wherever you had your start at and you know you start for the lord there's a start but there's a hunger within your life that only god himself could satisfy you are ordained not just to be uh fellowshipping around god as your savior becoming your savior but you are ordained to be a part of that mystical body of jesus christ by the holy spirit placing you in his bright body amen so you are ordained for that we didn't make ourselves that but to find that we needed the discernment of the spirit of god to break the darkness that was around our life we had darkness around our life like it speaks in genesis 1. yet there was seed on the inside that had been planted by god but there's only one thing that can bring that seed to life there had to be the right atmosphere the right conditions and it takes the word of god god said let there be light and there was light so the word itself is light and the light is the word the very first light there was was not sunlight it was shekinah light it was god's own life because it's by his life that he has brought the order to all of these things that that seed might come out and express itself for what god intended it to be so that discernment is necessary to come down and to discern the very thoughts of our heart i want the living word of god to discern the thoughts of my heart because there's there's purposes i have purposes you have there's things that we have that we are deliberating about and we want we want to know god what do you say about this what do you think about this lord and so when we're looking at honest reflections we know that as we were kind of looking at that last week in that of a mirror where you look into a mirror and you you you know you what you see is setting before you and you and we have to take an account of that the word of god is a mirror and as we were looking at that last week that a mirror itself without light in the mirror does no good you can make out certain things like brother brown could say there's been enough light to join a church there's been enough light you know for this there's been he said but in the evening time there was promise i will send the light in the evening time where it's you know gray and dismal and dark and divided opinions but in this hour he said i will send the light and that light is his word is himself is his power god didn't send us theology this message is not theology amen amen this message is the power of god unto salvation god has restored what was lost from the church of the living god let me tell you we're living in an hour where the word has come in this hour that god has taken us beyond where the ephesian age was because the ephesian age was already a fallen woman god has taken us back to that of pentecost where christ himself became veiled in a body of believers the bride amen but the church ages all they were there was a hidden mystery in god all of that to take out a people for his namesake he's been building his body just like what the sight of adam was opened and out of that came forth that body he's been building it now how does he build it he builds it by his word amen oh my so notice here the people the word comes to discern and says thus speaketh the lord of hosts my my mind well we could really preach on that one the lord of hosts this is we we are we are in the company of the lord of hosts we are in the company of an innumerable mount of angels hallelujah if gathered around the lord of hosts is with us you lord hallelujah this people say now i want you to notice the timeline if we can go into this here the timeline i think i put that in there just so i can uh go through it with with you as a people just i don't hope it's not so scrunched together next slide please um here we have the the people return back is it is it upward okay there we go i look at the look at the uh at the asterisks if you don't mind look at the asterisks here and i've put up the i've put up the dates i don't want to stand in front of you here's where 537 bc they returned from babylon this is the first group remember god said after 70 years are accomplished i will restore it amen amen right jeremiah 29. now notice here when this is done they come back in 537 here within the second year of their return the foundation of the temple is begun and then it stopped by opposition now when they first came back into the land they came in and they the first thing they did was they set up the altar in its place you've got to know where the altar is you've got to know where the offering is you've got to get to the true sacrifice if there's going to be any building or the foundation laid at all you got to get through the right sacrifice is that right this is why when they come back the first things first is get to the altar so it is an exalting that's why this end time message it does not exalt a man's idea it exalts jesus christ amen in a finished work in the spirit of god it's god coming to take his word and exalt that before the people raise the standard of the word up you realize the raising of the standard is christ himself coming in his body and he first comes in that way through him by the veil of a prophet and it's manifest before the people that this is not the theology of a man these are not the thoughts of a man as clearly as brother branham put it in mighty god unveiled before us 1964 he said to think of the message of the hour the expressed thoughts of jehovah amen see it's going it's calling us back where did where where when the condition was in israel where did elijah bring them back to he brought them back to mount carmel he's there's got to be a repairing of the altar if we're to receive the promises there is no promises outside of jesus christ but inside of jesus christ if we can see him the resurrected christ the mighty conqueror and we can come into that place of being identified with him that everything that you and i have need of is in him and he is in you come back to the altar first now here's what they did when they came into the land they begin to build as far as the altar then from the altar they had to lay the foundation and when you think of that foundation that foundation paul could say i have laid the foundation where no other man can lay and that's the foundation is what jesus christ so it takes that of the altar to bring the foundation stone or the foundation reality into our life where we're not by our faith any longer but now we're living by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me is that right that's why brother branham could say in god's chosen place of worship he said that foundation stone that he placed in you from before the foundation of the world what's the foundation stone it's the seed now when the spirit of god comes to quicken and raise it up that's your foundation everything that he builds upon the tabernacle he builds it upon himself so his his working in our life is not built upon our work that's right it's word added to word add it to word add it to word added toward it's his working in our lives oh my now notice here so they come back in in 5 35 the this temple has begun but it's stopped by opposition that's what i'm going to deal with right here hallelujah then in 5 20 is when the rebuilding of the temple resumed now watch this from 5 20 to 5 16 is only four years when they got going again only four years and the temple's done but notice between these two right here 535 to 520 15 years past and nothing was being done nothing was being done now i want to speak a little bit honest reflection and i'm not going to be in a hurry but i'm not going to hold you along either because i don't want to i'm not interested in cramming stuff in i don't want to do that but the question really should arise in our hearts why would this people say the time has not come you see god had anointed isaiah to speak of cyrus and this time coming see everything lines up god had spoken concerning cyrus my servant he called him mine anointed yes he sure did he was going to be used by god cyrus was not even a believer but he was going to be used by god amen amen is that right that's right and he would be you so you know here you would have the 70 years here where this expiring and god was going to restore them back into the land but here you find as well cyrus is raised up by the hand of god and cyrus speaks to the people of god and he lets them know i've received a commandment of the lord to build the house at jerusalem now he wasn't going to be the one to build it but there were people who were right there in that time who were ordained by god to build the house of the lord amen when that word was spoken let me tell you when that word was spoken there were people and names in the mind of god that were to be a part of that word to be fulfilled amen they may not have been on the who's whose list they may not have even been the choice of others in that hour they may not even have been the choice of their own choosing to go back and build the house of the lord but what was greater is they were in god's choosing amen and when the spirit of god began to speak through these individuals cyrus the bible says the spirit of god stirred up the elders stirred up these different ones you see the word alone it must come with the unction of the holy spirit and when god sends that word he's got hearts that he in turn intends to stir up amen he's got hearts that are going to be stirred up with a real vision it's going to be a vision that comes from the mind of god now comes into the heart of the individual it comes into that life to where it's something that moves you and i beyond even our own thinking and our own doubts it's it's greater it's a prevailing power on the inside praise the lord and they would say the time has not come now the bible says where they the people say remember the word discerns the hearts like it came to abraham and sarah's tent it discerned what sarah was laughing in her heart she wasn't giggling out loud she was in her heart so the word because you see has a man thinketh in his heart so is he yes amen is that right we can be defeated by how we think in our heart see god that's why the word comes to not only turn the heart but the word comes to deal with the heart yes amen right sure does the word has to deal and we need that we need that every service and we need that daily in our lives and i say god help us to invite that help us that we can be people that i don't just want some kind of a mirror that just you know it's always pat and samuel on the back and well you're just such a great guy and you're predestinated you're not going to miss it and you're not going to we're not talking about putting doubt out but i want i i have confidence that i am a child of god born of the spirit of god i've come from the mind of god i'm going back to the mind of god i'm going back to god i've got a confidence that i know lord all that i need i need from you lord you have every faith that i have need of i'm not interested in staying here i want to get out of here amen i'm not interested i believe you can join with me i'm not interested in living a mediocre christian life i'm interested in being on fire for god amen amen amen we're not called to be survivors amen we're called and anointed to be overcomers this time the time has not come so you know it was things coming out maybe they had conversations in their homes and you know and actions and things came about if you were to ask these people no doubt if you were to pull them aside and ask them and say do you believe the temple's to be rebuilt they'd probably tell you yes well it's going to be rebuilt but when you would narrow it down to say are you the people are you the people that's going to build the temple you'd probably find some halting that's good i think i want you to think now deep they didn't start in a halted way they started with the altar coming back and putting the altar upon the bible says upon his feet yes amen she's coming to the altar and putting that altar upon his feet his you see what it is is that everything underneath his feet is conquered everything is coming back to that that's why even in revelations 10 the mighty angel descended now put his foot upon the land upon the sea the powers that are not just not talking about natural land you're talking about spiritual powers it's talking about political power ecclesiastical power demon power right amen but it's all under the feet of the mighty angel amen and the mighty angel is the fullness of jesus christ the son of man in bright bodies and we're in christ oh you've heard this said many times i might be the skin on the bottom of his feet but every devil is under my foot are you hearing me glory be to god in the highest oh my now notice this you see there was also you remember a time in the scriptures because this is not new where things could arise and and people could say certain things in the time when israel was coming into the land of promise moses had spies sent out and when he sent them spies out they went out and ten of them begin to look at what they saw before them and they saw the opposition all they could talk about was how big the giants are right if you had coffee with them all they were going to talk about is how big the giant was on their life come on friends we need to stop talking the devil's language many of us how god has cleaned up our language and taken all of the cursing and swearing out but sometimes we get to talking negative and the prophet tells us when you go to talking negative you're talking the devil's language we are not called to talk the devil's language the bible says let the weak say i am [Applause] amen it's time to speak what god has declared in your life don't let the devil silence that up the seal's been broken the seal's been taken off of your life don't let him try to stomp it up you stand there and say what the word has said about you you take your side with the word you confess what the word is saying you say brother samuel sometimes i don't feel like it it's not about our feelings sometimes the greatest opposition that you and i have is our own feelings our own feelings our own thoughts our own about ourselves what we know but let me tell you something there's one who knows the real you on the inside and he knows really about you that saved god that placed that part of himself on the inside he's energizing that inner man with strength from himself to rise [Applause] hallelujah come on now brother graham said the biggest enemy that i've got is william branham when i can get him out of the way you say brother samuel how could he say that honest reflection brother branham knew his biggest interest it wasn't nothing out there actually his biggest enemy was not the devil remember the conquering is conquering this flesh bringing it in subjection by the spirit of the living god amen oh my i'll tell you i say god help that to become more real to us i mean continually quickened in our lives because we i know i'm talking to believers here this morning that you realize and i realize that there's things that god will come and speak to us in a service like this and then it could be months down the road or weeks down the road some other time down the road and here we are we might be facing something going through something or whatever is before us and we need a fresh word from the lord it might be the same thing that he inspired before but it ain't old manna it's the spirit of god inspiring his word to what you and i have need of and we can say thank you lord thank you father for pointing out the jawbone of the ass thank you lord for showing me the ox gold because that word when it's inspired upon by the spirit of god it might be one scripture it might be two words jesus swept but with the spirit of god in a strong hand of faith it's more than a match for the devil amen [Music] caleb told him he said look here look what caleb did the bible said caleb stealed the people before moses amen it's very important he steals them before moses because caleb realized his authority was coming from god who had come through the prophet are you hearing me now a manner is a people in the land in the last days called the bride of jesus christ amen walking in authority under the word that god has given to you and i in this hour he steal them in the presence of moses let me tell you something the only way god has provided in this hour the word that will address and meet and defeat every giant amen are you hearing me god has addressed it already in this age i don't it doesn't matter what it is that's standing up in your life god has provided the word in this hour to address every demon out of hell every child every complex every sin all glory be to god he has already declared and manifested himself caleb steal the people before moses outside of this message you're defeated amen come on friends you cannot separate the message from the bible that's a comment i don't know where that error is coming from but it ain't coming from the throne of god this message come on now standing there in the message of grace out in sportsman's holler and the prophet setting right there where the squirrels are coming forth and here the spirit of god would begin to move upon the prophet's life and begin to reveal to him speak this and speak but remember he made himself known to him that jehovah of the old is jesus of the news amen come on friends we've got to be able to look beyond the veil and recognize who it is that's speaking if you knew who's speaking out to thee hallelujah so where do we bring them we bring it before the word of god moses is god's vindicated prophet this word that god has vindicated in this hour amen we bring the people before the vindicated word amen come on friends it's a word that god has vindicated himself let us go up at once and possess it you know what caleb was telling i'm not here to debate it i believe it amen i'm ready to act on it i'm not here to try to convince everybody else because i'm not going to convince nobody right amen come on now i'm talking about traps of the devil amen for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up they said well i don't think we're able to we're not able to do it now the word was discerning what was in their heart amen and we know that in this case i'm going to move on from here but just to take that as an example it was opposition that arose up that caused the people to pull back from the promise of god opposition arose now what we're dealing with here in the book of haggai here 15 years has passed now you know sometimes when we look at things sometimes we see things out here and we see this going on you know uh maybe sometimes on a plant you can see a plant well it's got wilted leaves or maybe the blossoms are not where they need to be and sometimes we we can look out there and you can look at what you see on outwardly but that really ain't the problem that's only a manifesting of a problem that's deeper so you see it this is where discernment must come in because it's not looking just on the surface but it must come there must be discernment honest reflection that which will bring in our lives to look deep into the problem to the real reason what you say what are you saying to the same i'm talking about where the people said now the time has not come this is not the time that we're to build the house of the lord now if you'd asked them 15 years ago you probably couldn't have got them to sit down man they were just i tell you what i'm one of them i'm one of hey can you pass me that brick over one of them hey can you pass me hey praise the lord i mean they were going around the circle laying that brick down the foundation right right but now there's none of that there's not there's no joy because you really can't have true joy outside of the will of god amen the real joy because joy comes from the lord amen the joy of the lord is my strength right so now let's look here just for a few moments let's look at the source of the problem in ezra chapter four verse one as this goes into this of where we were reading from hegel let's now look into the source of the problem some 15 years before that the bible says when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel then came they to zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your god as you do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of the shard and king of ashur which brought us up thither now here they are and what they've just said in verse two they're liars now i'm going to tell you this is where it comes into this time the ephesian age we have here have been restored god restoring us back to that of pentecost but i want to remember god had a great commendation for those in the ephesian age because there in that ephesian age they could stand there and somebody could try to take and say well you know paul wronged here and paul did this and there were those who stood there in that day and they flipped them straight in the face and said you're not saying what paul said amen come on friends you know what they were doing it wasn't that they were lovers of paul they loved paul they loved and respected the position that god had placed him in that they had a love for the word of god that had united and delivered their souls and they recognized that message that god had brought to them that that had given them life and it was jesus christ amen so there was a deviation they stood right there the bible says thou hast tried them who said they were apostles you know what apostles means one who is sent brother branham picks it up in scriptural signs of the time he said what we have going on is unauthorized agents how are we authorized we are authorized by the baptism of the holy ghost amen and the baptism of the holy ghost is the word of the living god on the inside of you and i it's the standard that god promised in this hour when the enemy comes in like a flood i the lord will raise a standard against the enemy how does he raise the standard he makes his word real what can be any more real than the living word of god coming and calling you out and changing your life and moving to the inside it's a standard that stands right there against the enemy lord but these guys were liars here look how they come hey let us help let us build with you let us you know we're not careful with that where's the christian attitude in this come on friends this is why we need discernment of spirit because there's things sometimes that with that right there we could take a litany of scripture and say where's the christian spirit here where's this listen there's discernment of spirit taking place right here you know what's giving them discernment what's giving zerubbabel in them discernment the word that they're feeding on amen the bible tells us that strong meat belonging to them that are full age who have their senses exercised to deserve good from evil these men know that i mean who wouldn't want help that i mean what where they're in right now there's no walls up they've only laid down the foundation who wouldn't want help i'll tell you right now if i was doing a job at my house and one of these brothers came by and said brother samuel can i help you depending on their skills i could say sure man come on over and help me right i got more paint brushes right i mean who wouldn't want help right yes paul even would tell the church of the living god in philippians and other places to help them even they were sisters who were helping the church of the living god and as far as you know caring and things like that and paul would open a chapter i believe in chapter four in philippians he would speak again you know menace give to them because they are helping the body who wouldn't want to be helped sometimes the help that comes as help is not really help praise the lord one now we can go this in a natural there's some people you've had over to help you you wish you hadn't called them see in the natural it kind of helps right there's some things that usually you know hey brother god bless you i'll see you on thursday honest confession [Laughter] but seriously though these were individuals they didn't worship the only true and living god they worship idols too you see where they were standing is we don't want no mixture in here we want to stand with the pure purpose and word of god that's been revealed to us i'm telling you there was discernment that they had in that hour discernment notice jerubalau and jeshua the the rest of the chief the fathers of israel said unto them you have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us i'm telling you god doesn't need a lot right god don't need numbers he needs surrendered hearts brother madam tells us over and over and we see it scripturally all the way down through the scriptures it wasn't a big army that gideon god used it was one man surrendered to the hand of god and there was just a hundreds of soldiers that was there following that word i'm telling you they beat back the midian that's why because they were under the anointing of the spirit of almighty god and that's why god could say through his prophet that you take one man on fire for god it'll do more for the church than having ten revivals come on oh i say god let that revival strike in me lord rekindle the fire lord in my life rekindling more reigniting lord and my life about a young person you can say god let the holy ghost fall in my life let my life become a revival i'm living very tired so this discernment of spirit the bible said discern we must belove it it's a try every spirit brother brown would take us back behind that because sometimes and you look at the word honest sometimes there's what you call honest mistakes that right right we've all make them right honest mistakes but discerning the spirit that's behind it because sometimes the spirit that can be motivating does not mean that the person themselves is wrong but they're under a wrong motivation all right and that's what's got to be called out and revealed all right are you hearing me in the wrong spirit right because why you because the love of god in your heart don't want to see them go over the fall that's right are you hearing me now you understand i'm not talking about going out and calling everybody up and correcting everybody and this and that and we're the ones right and you're the ones right brother brown identified that clearly because he in an honest reflection put it before his own life and to you and i in word made flesh india trip he said i had got a selfish critical spirit about me i can follow a man like this honest reflections are you with me now ezra 4 4 then the people of the land now maybe we'll draw it right up here then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah weakened and troubled them in building and hired counselors remember we're getting at the calls why were they saying the time income at the same time this is the background and they hired counselors against them these are the same people that said hey let us help you they discerned that and they withstood it remember there's two parts brother braham said to discern that lukewarm formal spirit that wants to come and try to take away and discredit to the word of god amen you discern it and then withstand it amen where do we receive the strength to withstand that comes from god himself the first withstanding of it is is tune that out right there all right i tune it out right there hire counselors against them to frustrate their purpose i want you to catch this to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of of uh of persia this this this whole phrase of even before hired counselors it means to conspire satan sent some spies in jude said there were men who crept in unawares men of corrupt minds are you with me they crept in turning the grace of god into lasciviousness is that right right it's also paul said how can two walk together unless they be agreed amen amen unless they be agreed we're going the same way hallelujah is that all right amen like you can stand like joshua as a husband and has a father stand as a pastor as for me and my house we're going to serve the lord we're going to believe this message we're going to preach this message we're going to live this message we're going to be this message and we're going in a rapture [Applause] hallelujah amen and they hired counselors to conspire against them you know brother brandon tells us when you just to think of this in the message here brother adam would tell us in in um christ the mystery of god revealed how satan won't let you stay a big happy group of people then he also tells us in humble thyself he said i want you to remember he said satan will try to get among you he said he's got every gun trained against you right he said he'll call somebody to rise up and do something that's wrong or you think that's wrong he said but remember you ask god to stay with sweetness in your heart and you pray for that individual amen is that right right it's between them and god whether they turn around or not is that right we understand that there are stands that we have to take on the word of god now i want you to look at this here to frustrate their purpose this word frustrate means to break it to come to an end the motive and the objective of these counselors coming in was to break their purpose in other words stop the work if we can just get the work stopped you mean you don't want them to go back to babylon no if we can just get them to where they're so discouraged that they stopped laboring i'm good with that you mean you don't matter if they just come to church no long as they just they're they're not real fervent i'm all right with that come on friends we're talking about honest reflection you mean you're all right if they just say they believe the message i'm all right with that right you mean you're okay if they're not hot yeah i mean they don't even have to be cold they can be lukewarm i'm all right with that why because the purpose of god is not being fulfilled through the lives of these people all right so satan conspired let me tell you something satan studies each of our lives and and listen this guy works overtime you might think you've had to work some 12 well he works more than 12. i might think i've studied some all-nighters he does more than that i know the bible speaks of our lord he neither slumbers nor sleeps but the enemy is continually scheming and working in our life let me say this he knows our makeup he knows how we're made up he knows what pushes our buttons come on friends the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul it gives you victory it gives you authority but you've got to reign over that outer man and recognize him he is your biggest enemy your opposition that's right that's true amen think of this to break the purpose to cause it to come to an end sometimes the way these counselors come in now these guys didn't come in all together you know like you know like a parade hey we're here to upset the apple cart we're here to disrupt everything we're here to turn it all over we're here to stop everything going on your life satan comes in clothed in innocence that's right that's right he started his ride on a white horse innocency james picks that up when it deals with uh sin and lust and desires and then eventually it's crowned he deals with the four horse riders there we see that in our own life must discern it in our own homes must discern it right here in the church yes because th that that the horse riders there of revelation remember the cover has been taken off of satan satan's desire is to make the church of the living god lukewarm cold and powerless i don't know about you i am not settling for just being a part of a church i'm not settling for just rallying around and saying we believe a message i believe in this hour i'm a part of this message this message was sent to be manifested and take upon flesh in this hour amen and that's why because of that pull in our life it's more than us just saying that but our saying of that it causes us to get before the word and ask god's church my heart lord search me out real good god help me to have an honest reflection help me when the word exposes something help me to say amen to the word even if it takes the heart off of me if i'm not where i should be lord let me say amen to the word and in fact the word to change me oh my this is why i want you to listen to this quote i'm i'm not going to be too much longer here christ the mystery of god revealed i don't have this but i want you just to listen brother bran says this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride matthew 16 you're aware of that hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it and that's her stand amen amen that's my stand amen is this revelation of jesus christ this mystery of god that has been revealed this mystery of god the true baptism of the holy ghost this word living behind badger skins this is our stand amen amen our stand is not church membership our stand is not just agreeing around god sent a prophet well i believe every word our stand is upon the revelation of that mystery burning in the hearts and lives of god's children is that where you stand as a father is that where you stand as a husband is that where you stand as a mama where you're not just gonna settle for well you know they're going along with things they're doing the commandments just right it ought to burn in your heart and if it doesn't maybe you need a burning bush experience you need the power of god in your life maybe you need it rekindled in your life because what is needed is a real experience with god where the word becomes flesh and it's a stand amen against everything amen the enemy wants to rise up you've got a strength to stand against it praise the lord i want you to understand this here when i preach it i'm looking at the mirror too brother john when i'm studying and god's dropping things all through the week and then things as things are putting together little by little there's examinations going on in my life i'm not looking these are not just wealth let me find something to preach no i want my life examined and i just wanted to examine many times i have to crawl right out of my desk chair get right down on the floor many times even right there in praying beforehand and the spirit of god begins to strike upon certain things i want to see and know him more amen amen understand i'm not a sinner you're not a sinner but we want to know him more amen amen amen amen i want more of him so god help me show me more more of me needs to be emptied out right notice what brother brahman says this i want you to think of this counselors that have been hired it goes on to say in christ the mystery says why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you now i want you to notice what he's saying all hell was against it are you hearing me now the first part of the quote all hell's against it but now when it comes down he says you let so many things get it out of me you know it shows hell has no power unless we give it to him what are you saying brother sam well you can't stop the thoughts from coming in right but you can load up the double barrel and scene you can't stop them from coming but you can stand against it discerning against it discerning them counselors that want to come and say hey we're here to help you we're here to make things so much easier for you and your family we're here to do this we're here but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job and we got to work right right the bible says no man don't work you don't eat you let you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and hungry hallelujah it's god trying to reveal it to you see the revelation the last day is here now friends i'm a great believer in this just how the holy spirit would take his word and you've witnessed it over the years not just here not just from myself but from every gifted man of god you look and when i look at this right here of what is stated here within the message i don't just apply this quote and say oh once we're born again now nothing's going to get it out of us no i look at this quote right here as this is a continual standing that we must take hell is against this revelation hell really don't want your job but if hell can do it it'll cause your job to take away from this revelation come on friends i'm not going to say hell don't want your children but the real objective is hell will try to use those things to come against this mystery we are not ignorant of satan's devices that don't mean we throw our children to the curb absolutely not but we we we moving this way come with me and serve almighty god amen god is the first in our life god is the theme of our home everything revolves around him amen amen what is doing that is the stand of the mystery of god in the heart of the believer when hale wants to approach the doors of our children the doors of our home we stand on that mystery of a living reality called applying the token with love and confidence and says satan you can't have them well if you don't let them do this you can't have them amen you can't have them it's the stand of the revelation because that revelation is prevailing power shane wants to try to get authority over you he wants to try to get power over you amen come on friends the devil's not a dummy oh brother samuel i'm a pretty smart guy he's smarter than you and he's smarter than me matter of fact we can put all of our brains together and he's still smarter than us come on friends well i know the word he knows the word too as a matter of fact he believes that jesus christ is the son of god but he trembles but the difference between the devil and me the difference between the devil and you is i believe it and i have received the holy ghost i'm not just talking about a letter i know who i am i know and whom i have believed that i am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against today i'm telling this would be a good quote to cut out and put on your refrigerator put on your phone when you when your phone you look at your phone how the hell wants to make its approach against your life as a young person hell wants to make its approach against your life satan ain't interested in you he's not interested in bettering your life right you're right that's right he don't have nothing to offer you the only thing he wants to paint something out here like a mirage of oh i've got this to offer you and oh my you can you can have this and you can have that and remember all he has to offer is mirages it leaves lives hungry empty scarred bound with sin amen that ain't love that's somebody who hates you if i came down this aisle right now and grabbed you and put you in a cage and wouldn't do nothing for you you would say that guy don't love me why would you say it because of the way i'm treating you let me tell you something the devil he treats you so bad and yet you would want to serve him what about a loving god whether he don't put you in a prison you were following the reason but this god come down to set you free you might say i need passions i've got in my life he's a god that'll give you victory over your passions and give your strength on the inside that you have authority and dominion over them greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world hallelujah glory be to god i tell you right now i'd open up my heart and i'll just make ready and say lord jesus fill me full of the holy ghost lord god i lay everything aside i lay it all down lord god fill me lord with the purpose of the living god hallelujah praise the name of the lord but we let so many things ah i'm just going to wrap it up here this morning i think this just feels field we let so many things get in the way we let so many things right things just you don't come out right away it just suddenly comes in brother brown put it down in the ephesian age how things can come in so subtly he said one time the things you didn't used to read now you're reading things you used to didn't watch now you watch them oh he said you used to love those meetings where the spirit of god was falling see what's happened innocently things has come in let me tell you something you or me neither one are called to make deals with the devil all right that's good we ain't making no deals with him amen pharaoh wanted to keep the children behind y'all go ahead i mean you guys want to serve god go ahead you all can be real fervent but moses standing there ah to me that's more than moses amen heart right that's the heart of god amen amen that stood right there and said we ain't going this exodus is forever amen amen my children may not be aware of it right now their understanding may not be there right now but you can't have them amen amen you can't have them devil amen let me just put the devil on notice because i put him on notice many times you can't have our young people look sammy you pray that i pray that absolutely cause i know that he can hear that but it ain't my voice it's the voice of the resurrection on the inside you can't have them amen oh they might be influenced by this and influenced by that but satan you can't have them turn the most in the name of jesus christ amen but i've got confidence in that i know the power you know the power of the of prayer and speaking the word of god brother he goes out there beyond these realms it begins to elect satan and announce to him no matter what you've tried to put before us no matter what types of things you tried to discourage us i'm looking at a promise made by a god who cannot fail he cannot fail his word can't fail and i'm united with that word so i take his word above my feelings i deny what my eyes see and i believe what my heart says is the truth i say amen to the word of god hallelujah praise the lord i think sometimes it seems so innocent the rem reads us in here a job wife husband children we have cares of the world we do i mean there's a lot of things the tax season's coming up sorry you're like i thought it was this will be encouraging i mean who who rejoices about that who rejoices about when the insurance comes due or i got to pay insurance and that now the amount of bills you got to pay that month is more than what you there's cares of life we have to do and even in the cares of the of the life that we have paul would write of it even what takes place within a family cares of this world remember paul would write we do we're to use the world without music but i think the greatest thing that we can we can do within this is say lord order my steps and let me stay close to you amen let me stay close to you can you give me the last two scriptures there and then i'm just going to read them last two scriptures who's got the slides for me ezra 4 23 when the copy of our sexy's letter was read before ream and shemshine described in their companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power you know what they came against them with false accusations yeah that's right that's right i want you to i'm not going i'm stopping here but the false accusations had nothing to do with the orders they had originally received the false accusations had only to do with things that these guys were contriving and trying to pull out things against them in jerusalem as a rebellious city and this it had nothing to do with the original order of the word it had nothing to do with the original order of the word see what it shows to you and i our strength comes from the original order of the word from that of being restored back to the real word of god amen by the holy spirit so that everything in our life is under his control under his influence they came up and made him deceased by force and by power and i thought i thought these were these were the people of god i thought they were moved by the power of god they were but somewhere along the line their hands were weakened and they got weakened and weakened kind of like samson when samson thought at one point you know he he just man i'll be able to rise up the next time and just throw these philistines on man i'll be able to what was samson doing he was relying on a past experience a past reputation but it's what we are now that matters amen amen it's what we are now that matters and here they were they had become weakened then the bible says in verse 24 then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem imagine things that was being laboring they were working my i mean it was just such a thrill in the midst of god fulfilling his word was a thrill i mean they actually look forward to getting up in the morning getting started with their day going through them you know this is what god has called us they were so occupied with what god had called them to do they still sowed their crops they still ate but that wasn't their focus their focus was of what god had called them to do all right that's right that's good that's our victory right there and satan knows if i can get their focus away from and the priorities changed i'll weaken them devil don't you don't you care i mean go do they got to go back out in the world no no as long as they get cooled down as long as it's just it's kind of going around long what do you mean well you know kind of like where everything kind of becomes just like a like a club oh that don't bother you no because let me remind you and i we are a temple of the holy ghost amen we are built up spiritually as a habitation of god through the spirit there's to be added to our lives growing up in the stature of a perfect man spirit of god moving down in our life this is where we say god now is the time now is the time right now the mirror the mirror shows the mouth i have memories of when we had hair but we have memories right brother brian all got right all right brother rocco we got memories brother ritchie right everybody please don't call me we got memories but when i look in the mirror i got pictures but the mirror's not a picture the mirror shows what's going on right now [Applause] let's pray lord jesus father i know lord that you have you've you've taken this lord and directed and that's that's lord i my desire i'm not here to i'm just here to obey you just to follow father as we are together together lord myself with the congregation we are the sheep of your pasture lord and father we realize lord that without your mercies we could not have honest reflections what i pray

maybe from your heart from your life this morning maybe it's been a span of time but whatever whatever that span would be but if there's just in your heart you can say lord i need strength lord this morning maybe you've been weakened with the cares of the life not that you're a sinner you're an unbeliever for many no doubt you had an experience with god but things that can come about where you find yourself not as fervent as you used to be and you would ask the lord father help me lord jesus amen god bless you help me lord god may my hands be strengthened lord god help me lord to discern when hell would want to try to come against through job children husband wife whatever help me to just to discern that because it can come in so innocently help me lord god help us lord lord jesus i
