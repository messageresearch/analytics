us this morning amen you believe that my there's a spirit in our lives it's greater than the trials that we go through and the situations that the mountains that seems so tall Amen even when we were in sin and in darkness and we weren't looking for him yet he was holding us a man surely goodness and mercy have followed us all the days of our life amen there's something that's held us when we weren't keeping ourselves Amen well I'm a witness to that I don't know about you all but I wasn't born born again a man I had to get born again so there's lots of things in my life I'm not real proud of that as a sinner when I was away from God remember he was keeping me all that time even when I wasn't when I wasn't a Christian yet I was a son of God he knew me he knew you before the foundation of the world and he's a great Shepherd and Bishop of your soul is that right he won't suffer you to fall into the snare of the enemy this morning I believe he's faithful a man god bless you good to be with you this morning if you have your Bibles we're looking to the scripture 2nd Timothy and the third chapter good to see each one that could make it and we just pray the Lord would bless you in a special way you know I just just think God's so good amen I couldn't tell it all if I had the time the whole world could contain it and that's just in my life and in your lives and to think about all that God has done what a great God we serve and I don't believe he's done yet with us I believe the best is yet to come do you believe that amen praise the Lord second Timothy the third chapter and we're gonna start in the fourteenth verse a familiar portion of scripture this morning and hopefully if you read your Bible it says here in the fourteenth verse 2nd Timothy chapter 3 says but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has to be assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make the wise into salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness why do you see this worth that you know there's a purpose behind it why that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen let's just bow our heads for word of Prayer this morning Lord were thankful as we bow our heads and our hearts before your throne this morning to know that you've given an inspired word the the the the Greek it means it's been breathed by God that you've spoken father to your apostles and prophets and times of old that they could take and to write down these inspired words they were not the words of their own thinking or their own ability but like that pen in their hand they were used by you father - - just to give the will of God that your children might be able to read and to understand that they might be thoroughly furnished unto all good works and Lord you've preserved this inspired Word through persecutions and afflictions and dark ages and through the test of trying it you've you've preserved an inspired Word and you've even given us a translation that we could learn and to have this morning and father I'm thankful that you would preserve this inspired Word but Lord I'm just as aware this morning that you have the Word of God made flesh this morning in your children that are here and you've preserved them through their lives and through trials and situations and even when their forebears and their ancestors were in danger you spared their life that your children might be made manifest this morning and just as you've protected the scripture in these words from certain destruction and from the hands of men so to have you preserved your children you've brought us here this morning that we might hear this revealed word that we might hear the message of the hour and have an understanding of what you have for your children that would be profitable for us that you might be blessed in our myths that you might fight your people father now knowing these things we just want to commit this service our lives and our hearts into your hands this morning that you would come in a special way and that your spirit have preeminence in our hearts and in this service that we might have eyes to see ears to hear hearts to receive all that you would have for us father we don't want to miss one thing this morning that you have for your children and the cares of this world and the distractions and the vanity made they'd all be cast aside this morning me may the Holy Spirit sweep in with a mighty fire and an unction to drive up darkness or to drive out confused and in doubts and move mightily and your children father Fuger leave you've got a great purpose in each one that have gathered this morning and we believe that you come because you keep all your appointments we actually bless this word now and your children and moving the service father may you just find a place in our hearts that's been made ready that you might come and move in a special way and father that all that said and done may you receive great glory and honor in our myths for the ask it in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the bride says Amen god bless as you see that amen I want to speak about a simple maybe kind of a thought or direction from this scripture the inspiration of God as I said it means it's been breathed upon her God breed the word inspiration she only occurs twice in the Bible and I'll read the other one here in a little bit but it actually occurs twice in the Bible but as we know the idea of inspiration is all through the Bible the whole thing's inspired amen praise the Lord so it's the whole thing's inspired that's my brother Brent could say when you read the Bible if you don't see Christ and every scripture go back and read it again so Christ is revealing himself from the entire body of the Word of God he's revealed himself in this day the seals have been open and it's like a new book to us can you imagine you look at maybe a Hebrew scholar and some of them you know you can read your Scofield if you have a Scofield some of them look at the book of Esther and they dispute whether it should even be in the Bible why is what is the purpose of it it doesn't even mention the name of God in it and yeah to the Christian when this book is open to you and it's become a new book you realizes the tender hand of Jehovah the entire time even though his name might not be mentioned specifically yet you see the nature or the life of God in the entire story when you see Esther and you see her tribulation what she's going through you realize it's talking about Christ in a bride and how she would be used amen she was born for such a time as this so you see the hand of God in every scripture even in the disappointments and the failures and the discouragement these men and women in the Bible go through yet it was the hand of God trying to show the people something showing them Christ in his people amen and so the whole Bible the Bible tells us that prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man but holy men of God wasn't the man that was holy or the mountain that was holy was the God in I mean men holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so they were inspired by this spirit a man I'm thankful this morning to be able to preach to you I'm grateful to be here again you know this is uh this is one of the finest groups I get to preach to just be real honest with you and and you have that you have that welcoming spirit that brother man talks about but a Christian supposed to have that and I like it because you all come here and many you come early to pray amen and even I this in my notes and then they come back so we're gonna pray this more he's a lord well I knew I was inspired I know about the rest you what you think about it but I was inspired I was just thinking about this idea we come together because the Prophet said to come together and the pray the different officers come together the musicians come together and they begin to pray before the servicing you come in here in your last side the way to the world and your distractions and your cares and you begin maybe a half-hour whatever you come and early you begin to seek the Lord amen and yeah and you're not just doing it hopefully because the Prophet said to do it so I better do it but you doing it because you have a recognition that you'll be creating an atmosphere it's create an expectation that God could come by inspiration and so we're looking for the inspiration because listen I've been to churches I'm just bureau honest with you I've been the message churches well they all show up five minutes before service starts well praise the Lord well that's not you hopefully so she fits I guess they come in five mins for service starts everything together and I'll tell you from my experience now such as my experience it's the word so brother Graham says but from my own experience it makes a difference in the service the attitude that you come in with and if you prayed if you seek the Lord the atmosphere that you're setting makes a difference whether you realize it I realize it anyway I had a man come to me one time and he'd been in the brown tabernacle when he was young he said well you know sometimes brother Ram came to service maybe even later maybe five minutes for service started he said I said well that's true probably because at the hospital praying for the sick or visiting somebody at home not because he hit the snooze button five times and then that wasn't why I look stupid he was God hey man I know why he showed up late it wasn't because he was too tired to get up and show up and pray that's not what he was doing a member he understood is that right and this way he's telling the people not being a hypocrite but he's telling that people when you come together and you seek the Lord and you create an atmosphere and expectation of the inspiration of God is going to come down to the service and he'll take the preacher claw off as notes you know walk right into your living room and walk right into your personal life when you maybe you weren't even expecting it and he'll come and speak to you he'll read your mail I'll let you know where you're at in life now you know where you're at Amen people come up with a prayer London brother Brent oh my their address and their past they knew all that there was a new information to them but there was a recognition that God was speaking through that man that God knew about them and God was mindful of them and you've come with the same now listen we're not up here this more for me to have a discernment line but the same God still gives inspiration through the ministry through his people he still speaks today and if you believe that that's why you dad and you come together amen amen so I'm like I said I've been a witness of it let me say this I've been places you know I think about these prophets like I talk about these men of old they didn't always have a great group of people like you to preach to that most the times the people's ever preached to one to kill him her psalm in half or stone them or whatever else and fortunately that's not been my experience most of the time now I've been overseas before I had did actually have to have armed guards come protect me one time that's a whole nother situation listen I've been places where the church had to inspect the water ball before it drink because they poison preachers where I was at not send it to compare myself to these men of all but listen these men they they they had to preach the people that didn't want to hear it most of the time a man and we're so blessed just even unnatural to have a place like this in this country where the doors are still open to come and seek his face and hear this word of God were right blessed this morning to be able to do this and I'm very blessed to stand before you and not a bunch of people in the world that when an ass against me with their teeth and take up stones amen praise the Lord well anyway and the reason I say this is these people that these prophets would come and speak to these people and they would say things that would make them unpopular and they would say things that would cause maybe the people to even want to kill them and why would they do that why would they go listen nobody in the right mind says you know I'm gonna go to a big group of people that are looking to kill me and I'm gonna make him more mad by telling that this will be God and there's stiff-necked and their uncircumcised well why did they do that it wasn't because they wanted to do it but they found that there was a spirit that inspired them something constrain them in their life beyond their own ability even the Prophet Jeremiah he was discouraged one time as a preacher preachers get discouraged too and he was discouraged one time as a preacher he said you know I'm not gonna administer a preaching this name or make mention of his name anymore he said I don't want anything to do with him every time I stand up and open my mouth that people come against it they criticize it they were throw me into jail they call me all kinds of names but he finds what he tried to restrain it he tried to hold it back he said I was like a fire shut up in my bones and they begin to smolder and they begin to burn his life and nobody tried to hold back the less he could control it and finally he begin to speak in the name of the Lord he said I can't help myself there's something on the inside it's moving me maybe popular but I'm in the hand of Almighty God and the Holy Ghost movin hallelujah I want you to send the Spirit of God in that mansion and these prophets it's so move them brother rest until he acted out the very life that was in that they would go and march through the streets with yokes of iron on and laid on their side for days here's a man by the name of Moses training the wisdom of the Egyptians and the people honed their hearts and made a golden calf and then he finds himself standing in the gap pleading before God to God do not forsake this people if you do this the Egyptians will say you are not able to deliver this people don't remember your promise don't remember your promise to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob is it God if you would not deliver them then take me home on Paul said his brother were blinded for our sakes is that I could wish myself accursed that they might have him in somebody listen that's not a man that's not a man and a man says you know what forget them people I preached in him and they won't listen and they don't care about anything about God I must you know what they got what they deserved but there is something on the inside that man there was something on the inside of Moses brother is Christ it Moses and that spirit seized upon their lives to Christ some of their own thinking but getting down in their lives you think about Moses the type of Christ to deliver you they want Joseph in a prison for 13 years a perfect type of Christ these men weren't thinking to themselves man now what do I have to do today to be a type of Christ I'll make sure to do this on this day these men were not biologists but something had come upon their lives they constrain the house and they begin to move by the Holy Spirit hey man listen if God could do that in their life through the blood of bulls and goats then what about a born-again word washed sanctified believer filled with the Holy Ghost whose nature has been changed to the nature of God what can he do in your life can you break the chains of sin he can throw off the oppression it's in there not so easily beset us he's more than able help somebody he is more that he can do it for you to him and he's not a respecter of persons hey man but they were so anointed by that spirit they begin to act that Miliband says this and looking from Jesus he says every prophet every divine men that come from the presence of God always worked under certain inspirations which was directed by God he says ministers tonight preached under inspiration directed by God seers tonight work under the inspiration of visions directed by God I can do nothing he said except the father shows me and whatever the father shows me I go do it you think about this because I got said you got a man like Moses his natural education the wisdom of Egypt did not deliver those people and the wisdom of media was unable to deliver those people hey man the wisdom of Egypt did not teach him to stand the gaff and intercede for her people and acid praise the Lord somebody there was something in his life that was great a hurry man that they didn't even know think about them how many times you do something in your life as a Christian he said what was I thinking and nothing was ever talked about this as many times you feel inspired to do something and you go do it and you begin to question what was I thinking he says time you may think you did exactly what you should not have done he said but if you'll be patient and you watch it was God the whole time so don't you say a little something that no time I see your foot in your mouth hey man I'm talking about the inspiration to God you'll move you do something maybe it's just something maybe you don't even realize it you say certain something to somewhere they come back that was just what I needed nobody mouths what I was gone brother sister nobody knows what I was struggling with but God did something just sent me a little card ooh you send a little something to me to church and let make something to me it's not inspiration if you're believer that's more than gold or silver or popularity so now it means for your soul oh yeah praise the Lord I believe today the bride of Jesus Christ has gathered many places around this country many places in the world many of you gathered here this morning under the inspiration of God amen praise the Lord now we didn't gather here just because there's a man's ideal hopefully we're just to socialize but we gathered here not to hear some lecture because I'm not a good lecture well you probably already feel like what's he doing and then not to hear a lecture on some thought or whatever is what we believe that this word of God is inspired that's why you're here the Lord said to assemble yourselves together we believe that the word is inspired is that right see you've gathered together under the inspiration listen the inspiration is no longer just on the page hey man I'm bringing you somewhere now the inspiration that was on this page is no longer just on the page but it couldn't find a place it drop down into your heart and something begin to stir inside of you like these men and women vocal so now I'm gonna gather myself together let us go into the house of the Lord I'll enter his gates with Thanksgiving I don't courts with praise mommy told her cuz daddy told you but there's something you're like now the inspiration has found a residence that's why you pray before service that's why you do these things you haven't understanding I want that same inspiration that was in the prophets meetings that same inspiration pen this Bible I mean in my own life listen 1990 probably some percent of the time Bible tells you what to do but there's things in your life if I don't say well you know and when you go home this way go a certain way that you wouldn't normally go to avoid a car rack or go work at a certain job even though it looks bad good work the Bible don't tell you those things but the God that I wrote this Bible inspired these men could inspire you with the same inspiration with the same power before tell things to discern things amen my mom has you've been in his presence see when you when you've been in his presence if you've ever been in his presence you know what it's like to be there you know it's octiline and you know it's like when you're in his presence to receive that inspiration is that right listen the program said we put too much stress on the mechanics he says a nothing on the dynamic hey man he said no nervous is anything wrong within the Canon there's nothing wrong with mechanic but we leave it on the page and we don't talk about that now listen the dynamics more than just speaking in tongues promise I'm shouting and dancing that's good that's fine the time that makes you do that but it's the very life behind it that will make this word live in your life cuz listen I'll be honest with you I can't make this live in my life and neither can you but there's a god that can live inside of you and make this word less he can make us work do the things he said it would do he said these signs shall follow them that believe is that right you're not producing it did not manufacture it follows you because the God that is supernatural he's a supernatural God in the supernatural things and your lives is supernatural because you're born again of the spirit that's that dynamic whether we said it throws this mortal body into subjection what to his word hallelujah the balance is listen here you hear 1956 he says if our nature becomes converted from the things of the world to the nature of the Holy Spirit God will take his stand he will abide on us now watch what he says this is really important and what she cats this he's has inspired believers taking the inspired Word and men inspired believers raise your hand inspired believers got some inspired believers this morning inspired believers not just make believers not just carnal believers inspired believers taking the inspired word those two together brings the results it brings the word to life it's how much the world little my life get inspired and then get inspired listen this Bible does not need to be inspired any more than already is this Bible this Word of God is as inspired as it's ever gonna get but the question is today not is the Bible inspired but are you inspired it's the inspiration in our life because if the inspiration is in your life inspired believers take the inspired Word and that's what brings the results say I'm suffering with addiction but I got sickness get inspired the inspiration will take you out of that situation and put you in the promised land of God look as you can take a grain of corn and laid on a desk I'm a golden desk he says no matter how else polished it might be 14 carats it will never produce any more corn no matter how pretty the desk is how genuine gold is it's laying on or how real how Germa ties the corn is the cores got to on rich fertile dirt to bring forth the results hey man notice the problems not the seed hey man you go back and read the Bible the problem the parable of the seed sir the problem is not the seed the promise where did you plant it you planted much a formal denomination and man's ideas in your own thinking a bunch of formalism or do you plant it in the promise and then you put it in a pretty desperate supreme destiny ground it's prepared ground do you put it in that predestinated ground and allow it to grow hey man look you didn't water you didn't plant octave increase he gives his spirit and gives inspiration and you begin the water with prayer and you begin to water with praise and you watch it take on a life of its own something you couldn't do within yourself do I witness somebody man adopted things in your life you could not do but what was it God spoke to you one day he dealt with your heart and you become inspired if God can do it for that man if God can do for that sister if God can do it for them God can do it for me it's not a respecter of persons huh that inspiration amuses stir on the inside of you and then begins to be willing up inside of you like a well of water something on the inside working on the outside a man listen I think it's fair to say this morning let me say this inspiration is the lifeline of the church hey man say why don't you say what cuz the profit Center preached about a lifeline he says when you think this is the third Exodus is when you think you can set a church and order more by your intellect better than the Holy Ghost is you've taken the life line out of the framework hey man you understand what I'm saying we can read this Bible we can study these quotes and we could put everything together just so amen praise the Lord somebody mother bear said you got to watch out for education cuz I'll leave you to this the demon of education I'm not setting us in education but if you're not careful it'll either the demon of education he says Italy to me I know all well you think you know everything that many people I hate to say it this way but I met many people that think they can set the church in order a lot better by their own intellect than what the Holy Ghost can do but when you've done that you've taken to their last line out of the church brother Rams head the very things not given to preserve them from death your lifeline is right say guys on the water and he's dropping need a preserver well you don't wanna jump in there with him and pull you under so you put it on a line and you throw it out there can you imagine a man grab an almond saying you'll love this rope I don't like the color no I don't like what's made I'll write oh you know I don't like this lad about I'm gonna cut it off that's the very thing that's saving his life and this inspiration of God the moving of the Spirit in the church so I'm gonna help me out hairy man the moving of the Spirit I'm just I'm at the letter now the letter will kill but the spirit that wrote this letter gives life if you if you take that spin out so you know I've got a better idea you've cut off the lifeline of the church hey man what about you take it right out of the framework so I want you think about this if you're believer whether you're a husband a wife a minister whatever is if you're a Christian you need the inspiration of God amen brother that said you can't read this Bible like it's a newspaper and then this is not a bunch of data about God and historical facts and events that took place it's more than 90 men if you read it like a newspaper that's all it'll ever be to you it'll be old news it may not always be something that happened and not something that's happening a man it always been news it'll never be prophetic you'll never take root in your life and then it'll be like a newspaper you listen it's no different than me paying you a picture of fire this morning I can get up here and tell you stories about the Prophet and that's fine that's good and father I can tell you stories about the Prophet I can tell you stories in the Bible about a Smith Rock and a pillar of fire and as long as they're just stories to you that's all they'll ever be and I can paint the prettiest picture of a fire maybe the best picture you've ever seen but when you are in the cult today they want to keep you on what you need is to come down here the doctor and get a couple sticks and start rubbing them together and say you know I've heard about fire I've talked about fire but I gotta have some fire for myself I don't forget a couple rocks and strike them together I gotta have something to keep me warm when I go on the church today I need that speaks to me not just in this building what a shame that some of us only hear from God on Sunday what a reproach Amen somebody that something must only hear from God once a week you won't hear from that all the time maybe that are the sons of God their letter the spirit the Bible says God is leaving us he's taking us somewhere hey man praise the Lord we come here with that somebody paints a picture of fire we become art critics hey man you ever see this guy walk through having the museum there well I like this guy's use of color more on this guy's pastel yada yadi whatever anymore and we put on our tricks well I like how this preacher preaches better well he's more exciting well he's less sweaty well he's boring intellectual well he's less formal and we've become art critics and we begin to look at what how a man preaches instead of what is being said what is the inspiration I don't care if the guy can't preach his way out of a paper bag but can you cast the inspiration of God behind it and then yeah we got a lot of painters let's stand the pulp and the paint a picture man but I don't want to paint you a picture this morning mostly because I'm not good at painting remember what I want you to do is realize that the same fire that elect these men up lippies went up in this Bible when they wanted his sheep skins and in deserts and they received their dead to life again and they quenched the violence of fire and shut the mouths of lions these people whom the scripture says the world was not worthy it wasn't them but the God that was with them and the girl that's in you these people today you gather here listen the world's not worthy in here the world's not worthy of your testimony the world's not worthy of the grace that God is giving you because emergency think about that now you say you know ain't no good right word that God kept me nothing mean God says nah you're my child the world's not worthy of you they're not worthy of you listen something is taking residence in your life there's an inspiration a man more than a picture to us or a photo ID the identification has to live in I say man the RAM says this several places in the message where we this of the ark 1955 they said there's three elements that people live in he says first is the humanistic the second is divine revelation he said the third is vision he's an eye like in prayer when you pray for anyone in the humanistic we say well I hope you'll get well I'm hoping I'm believing with you trying to use all the faith that I can't says that's Humana he's but the second is divine revelation when something is revealed to you you know in your heart listen that killer come from God and then I can get up here and preach but like God can give you the inspiration of it behind this to show you what is being revealed to you a man hey man he says you know your heart it's going to happen yeah there's nothing but the revelation he said the Third's of vision it's the set the Lord it's when it becomes positive he said that's perfectly positive really man when he's telling this he tells a story many of you probably familiar with this story but he was at home one day reading his Bible that's a good place to get inspiration by the way she didn't know where to go here's a holiday written his body's reading the book of Genesis about the story of Joseph that I talked about a few moments ago and how he was rejected about his brother and how he'd been in prison and how he become to the hand the right hand of Pharaoh and all these things and he was just so inspired by this type of crime what a great man he was and brother Mendel's in his prayer closet and he begins to pray a little your place to get inspiration and while he's there and I listened while he's in that closet God because to speak to him you're gonna have a son amen you're gonna have a son and names gonna be Joseph uh-huh listen we have the benefit of knowing that happened a man this man didn't nobody know the voice of God he knew that God could foretell these things he'd sent happen time and time again and while he was praying God said you're gonna have a son and his name is gonna be Johnson hey man well he goes along for a couple months assume he's pregnant and they're all excited and she is birth to a girl well now here come the gainsayers calling what they do today whoa brother Brad so this could happen didn't happen well maybe didn't happen yet well you said you're gonna have a boy he said a man call him up one day on the phone said you said that you're gonna have a Joseph did you mean Josephine Omar they've done the same thing today oh well yes said we're gonna have a Joseph yes invincible right but I don't see it I see a bunch of be not discouraged people go to church they never gonna be any better than they are now they're never gonna be any more messed up than they are now y'all can't use them people God can't touch them people don't use that message are you sure you didn't mean Josephine the been said the man eventually died actually buddy Megan said this he said when he said that I said listen he said I was gonna have a son because there was gonna be Joseph he didn't say this one and I find it curious what brother man says he says I could have had six more girls beside that think about it seven girls seven church ages looking for the prom God's gonna rock let's ponder wanna look at this church age look at this ministry look at Luther look at Wesley look where they want God said he was gonna come for a holy back God said he's gonna have a perfect Church and I ain't seen it don't matter how many girls go by her church changes go by God's gonna have a promise son hey man it don't matter huh if I have six more God said I'm gonna have a son his name's gonna be Joseph my well time begins to past little bit like I said I think it's significant hey Manny went to the doctor one day with sister median the doctor he told him he said the doctor came up said rubber and I'm gonna tie those tubes now how I said he said don't you do it I said now watch what the doctor says well maybe you'll get married again trying to help him out that's what Hagar did well maybe you'll have another wife and have it nope I'm gonna have a why my wife this wife's gonna have a son and his name's gonna be Joseph hey man listen you brother brems like you look at Abraham actually Abraham tried to bring the promise to pass without the full inspiration he knew is gonna have a child but God said no you're gonna have a little Sarah but he didn't wait on the inspiration and when he did it away and producing Ishmael that produces a carnal believer they produce a child of bondage is that right I'm gonna bring him come on the scene preaching about a revival of the Pentecostal stock that's this healing ministry that's what this is that's the impersonation and we see into that second Paul impersonation after impersonation that was not the promised bride but this bride miss Bryant come on to the opening of suits this the bride he was talking about I said I'm not gonna he said I'm not gonna call you Church I call you bride so you understand there's a difference there's a difference between you and the rest of the world this is not the imitation this is not imprecision this is that which was promised under Revelation chapter 10 1730 all these other scriptures this is the promised bride I pray this morning God could mother ma'am says this the doctor said well you have to get married and have that boy said I'm gonna have it by her God said so that's what he said God said so listen he says I couldn't read it out of the Bible but it was wrote in my heart by revelation my faith God said so I'm pretty I can write on your heart this morning by inspiration the tablets are your heart not so stony that God can't write on them anymore this is my little jam my second daughter prays learn storytime my little daughter I was at work one day at the factory that I used to work at and I had went to the fact that I was praying that's not man that I don't know let me just have a third child no what am I gonna do I can't provide for this child I kidding this what's gonna happen and God begin to speak to me when I was working didn't know my wife is actually pregnant already Here I am threatening word what am I gonna do well I didn't start as you can see and God spoke to me when I was working you can pray it work - he spoke to me that day at work and said you're gonna have a daughter you're gonna have another your wife's print you're gonna have another daughter I said so I like home and I told my wife said honey you're pregnant that's backwards from how it usually works hidden it home at or she's pregnant she went into this she was pregnant so say this listen because the time goes by and she get rid of help sundown the family's trying to guess but it's gonna be a boy or it's gonna be a girl and wants to be with the same boy I said what God told me it's a girl the nurse asked me said what do you think I said I don't think anything God told me was gonna be a girl okay whatever guess what I was a girl take that now my parents I love my parents God blessed my my parents I love them for all they've done for me but they're all about they're one of these couples they like boys more than girls and I'm telling at the dinner table here a couple days later how we're gonna have another girl in this snap and they're talking well maybe it was a boy maybe it was an action at me they could have looked it up son wrong said yeah that's possible and I think there's my mom five said well we could pray there would be a boy instead and I stood up at that table I said well God has taught me I'm gonna have a daughter you know what should you never bother me about it again well she's back there you want to shake her hand he said why you tell that story listen that wasn't wrote in my Bible it wasn't wrote on my heart that day when people didn't know what to think about and they thought was goofy it's funny I'm here now listen am i talking about eating a bunch of chill and get yourself worked up like some people I'm talking when you're neutral for God and you can lay there and let God speak to you he can speak by inspiration here in your heart and he'll drag it out here [Applause] that our life is a Christian we should always let that word be written those stuffs right up here amen let's not just memorize it let's let it be written in our arms the grandma said this is the reason the Pharisees missed the promised Messiah it's the same thing happen to Noah's day they missed it through the whole Bible why because it comes a different way than they expected see they had their own expectation amen are you with me they had their own expectation instead of the inspiration of God they thought it had to come a certain kind of away I'm gonna bring it down now it's gonna be just so in such a way I'm gonna have just such a thing in my homework just the right kind of a job or the right kind of a pastor deacon I want to be just so and so if they don't sing the songs I like every service if they don't paint the gifts the walls a certain color we gotta have it just so you see you some ridiculous listen the Pharisees the Sadducees they saw the word manifest before them and they rejected it not because they were ignorant but because it didn't come the way that they wanted they come through a little five-foot what four or five foot six looking Jewish man looking maybe 50 years old the age of 30 hey man well this is the carpenter song from gal from Nazareth can any good thing come out of Nazareth then come the way they're warned so they begin to say I can't be we reject it we reject this this this this can't be this Messiah see God always comes a different way than we expect but I want you to say something their problem was not just that God come a different way than expected because God's done many things in my life and I thank God he's done many things in my life I didn't expect it that way but I think God it happened that way can I get a witness a man caused amazing love so I don't know how girls gonna work that out and he did a completely different way than my fly and what happened I said praise God that was so much better than what I had in mind you know what I'm talking about listen the problem was not all together then it come a different way the problem was it come a different way and they rejected it they didn't like the way it come they said oh no not that way you're hard you can have this you can you can have the kitchen you can have the living room but stay out of my bedroom stay off my search history on the computer stay out of my personal life you stay on my job you sound my relationship with my kids you can have everything else but stay out of this part oh no you ain't coming in here I'll let you have this part but this is for me and don't you dare try to change the way I want to be done well tell you what my pastor is preaching hear it on Sunday and he started to bring a little correction in the church and he said you know you gotta be careful he correct people because I clam up on you I thought God bless my pastor cuz these aren't dating to do that and it's such a shame because like you said some people you correct them once you never see them at church again oh they want the word to be preached just don't amen what we left it's like I was taught my wife that I said people love it when your preacher gets in here you're preaching in sinners alright then Bob had just balls and they're learning with their shorts on this and that and then you preach my their sin and their backbiting in the gossip and this is all that pastor ain't got no business telling me what do money preacher hunt lions oh that man got no business coming to my bed now well the man's not doing it you just don't like the way God's doing it come on now somebody I tell you when you please message people Oh hallelujah where are we is message people get such thin skin so we can't be corrected anymore well the Bible says is profitable for correction listen that's not for the world because they won't receive it listen there's only one people who would even receive correction it's got to be us so if it come to say God it's from a guy well none of us like being corrected you know we talk kids this is good we tell our kids you know what you better have to sit where we're gonna correct you they don't like being corrected and then we grow up and we say you know what I don't like been corrected either differences they got to deal with and I don't I'll leave Church I won't listen to tapes no more come on somebody we we spent so much time telling our kids they need to receive correction I mean they act a certain way and behave a certain way and then we grew up and do the things we tell them not to do and then we wonder why we're not blessed and we wonder why they think we're a hypocrite well daddy told me I should receive correction but he gets up seven anytime somebody preaches up and down his aisle hey well hallelujah mommy says that we should receive correction we should soften our hearts but they get like a big old pump fish any time you preach my lamb listen I'm not here to preach about everybody but it's the idea we don't receive it because we don't like the way it comes that's why they won't receive it they wanted a messiah would come and pat him on the back it's a good sound Pharisees waiting to putting them people in order waiting to stick them over your thumb under bars that's great it says ridiculous with the dead the Bible says they had the key knowledge listen the people they didn't know what to do but these men had the key of knowledge and that was they not entering themselves they hindered those who that's powerfully mana they didn't like they didn't like the veil it was behind listen sometimes we don't like the veil that's sometimes you're the veil that you don't even like well there's a tough one for you sometimes you say God God what are you to do the situation God would he send somebody do something you're the one oh not me no I can't do it ah I can't speak well and my brother Aaron's coming and let somebody else do it no you're the one no but I got a pulse and I got failures and I'm too short I'm too tall and I'm too fat and I'm too skinny I'm too loud I'm not really one I'm sending somebody down you're not sometimes your own nails are you stumble at got begin to lay something your heart and God begins to stir in your heart you say no not me Lord it can't be me don't send me to preach don't send me pop that person don't let me pray for that sick one oh yes you're going like that mama coming to meet one time there's I'm almost the blue baby you know this story and they're there before the meeting and the spirit begin to deal with her Bob didn't tell her she had to do that with the spirit begin to inspire her go print that little blue baby over there she didn't wanna do it like some of us but God be gonna deal with that much more it's like a fire shut up in her bones I finally said you know what just from her a did she wasn't that good that's true so just from my own conscience sake I'll go pray for this child cuz I know brother I'll pray for the baby later anyway she says listen I just I feel impressed to pray for your baby can I pray sure you can pray for the baby you know the store brother I've caused the baby up process this baby's already been healed but mama prayed the baby was heals okay listen inspiration did something in her life she didn't think she was qualified I can't use me hook I can use listen if I can use a donkey here better than the donkey I hope you are God can you listen to God if God yeah if he if he closed the grass let's cut down tomorrow if he's feeding the swallows that's the nesting mark and she was more than many sparrows here we're more than a donkey you morning you're a child of God listen your song a daughter of God this morning God can use you to do whatever he wants you feel him - his inspiration I'll tell you what praise the Lord knocking see see it's not just the inspiration it's how we receive it and you can tell you can tell them you say this you can tell what kind of inspiration you're under by how you receive inspiration see those men were inspired those Pharisees were inspired by they're inspired on a Hell by their daddy the devil they weren't inspired by God hey man so you can total kind of inspiration your honor listen if you're bored of the word you cook with the word you don't respond to the word you won't reject it because you're under the right inspiration you're born of an incorruptible seed even the Word of God amen so you watch that somebody responds the word especially that rubs in the wrong way and I'll tell you what kind of inspiration there you get some people some time I can't say well you know preacher I'm I know more about it than you do I'm a couple yeah well I'm not a preacher well you might you might know way more about me and that don't even mean you're saved you say what you mean rather the Bible says you can understand all mysteries not even have charity the Bible says that knowledge puffeth up but love edifies when somebody comes along her own idea or their own revelation or their own doctrine and it puffs them up over the people you know where their inspiration come from he say what do you mean you look at Moses Amen that speak face-to-face with God and the Bible says he was the meekest man in the whole earth you that I'm messing you're a problem this day he was not some great man that promoted himself all others he says a great man makes you feel great so if you're really inspired by God it's not gonna cause you to push everyone else down there cause you to lift him up cuz love edifies but knowledge puffs up hey man well praise the Lord yet some of these people they sit there and they cross their arms a preacher you can't tell me anything I don't already know you can't do anything to help me and you know what they're right I can't do anything to help them and probably God can't either because of their attitude hey man God can't even well you don't have any business talking like that who's talking who's talking man see it's well I'll tell you what I was talking something about this I said it's quite a revelation to me as a young Christian when I realized that God can talk to me through somebody else besides my favorite preacher what a revelation y'all could use someone else like my Fairbridge he talked to me yeah I can use anybody oh yeah you don't have to use the preacher you like he's only not like hopefully you don't have that problem not today boy duck here the RAM says in my commission he says when the angel or moves down it becomes an a voice of God to you he says if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I thought that might that might have been resented but I am God's voice you notice they resented it here's a man a prophet you stand in the pulpit saying when this angel comes down with this inspiration of God comes oh I'm God's voice to you he says now I felt that some of you resent that but it's true anyhow listen William Brandon's the seventh angel whether you like it or not you're lacking in a reject me it doesn't change who he is buddy you're mine but he don't change who he is in front of God that's God's voice to you he said that time was under inspiration yeah [Applause] he said that was under inspiration I'm God's voice too he said he said I felt bad about the first time but it repeated it to a medium subsidy I didn't really feel bad not saying that within God don't say it again tell that spirit that resents that it's true anyhow say it again and that's my heart through my this message when the enemy comes in and tells me these thing you know this is just a bunch of makeup this must work up this is your imagination and this is a bunch of fanatics and say no am I saying again what the Prophet said let's say if the Lord this message is Christ it come from God it's for me I'm not standing here today carrying about my dreams I'm not more shook up I'm more settled than I've ever been when other preachers and other Christians they're fallible and they don't know so I believe this should I believe that little prophets I believe it now more today than I ever had in the whole line he says this on the platform and the Holy Spirit is speaking and he's speaking through Maura lips he always does that now I believe these are ministers behind me says and brethren you never preached a sermon in your life well I don't know I'm sweating so hard you never preach the sermon your life he says the Holy Spirit preached through you a sermon hey man that's right seaweed up preach the Holy Spirit does the speaking oh we might write something out and read it but that isn't preaching preaching is when the inspiration comes its preached by inspiration and the Holy Spirit gives the out chin he says now we can read something and it just doesn't matter amen we'll have you ever read your Bible like a newspaper probably have one I didn't read the scripture and maybe you've read the same script maybe we're at the same chord a hundred title brother call me you're just earlier this week he said you know I I've written out he used to do the messages put him in the books he helped do that this brother took the tape and typed it up put on monkey said I typed this quote years ago and didn't realize it was there until the other day hey mo so good I'm a preach on it I typed this out years ago I've heard it maybe a dozen time probably more but just the other day something struck and it stood out to me that's what we need not just the readers to memorize it but let something take ahold of that and preach to us you say I'm not a preacher let it live us zooming through us if you can't preach the sermon we have a sermon I've such an inspiring live in Christ to gunk and preach out of your life no doubt these men that wrote the Bible you think about Isaiah version shot conceive he probably scratched his head what in the world did I just say oh man I hope they don't write that one down oh that was God amen oh my we can read something that just doesn't matter but when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of it and takes it out to the people then something takes a hold hey man and that's the Holy Spirit that's not your pastor preaching that's the Holy Spirit preaching in your pastor out to you giving the message hey man so see it's the veil like I said back that can be the pastor preaching or that can be the Holy Spirit in the pastor preaching it all depends on what inspiration you're under amen well listen I was I've been I was in the service one time I've been a lot like this but I was in a service one time there's a young man I think maybe he's just newly married and he was preaching and this young man you know this 20 CPU I say young I'm not that old myself 36 but uh this young man is preaching about marriage and children raising raising children well you know what happens some of the old people in church they they shut down on him candy don't know nothing about what's he saying I met you laughs cuz you know I'm talking MA oh here we go he thinks he's an expert on marriage now he's gonna preach to us about marriage I'm too married 50 years whatever I've been married a hundred years what's he gonna tell me a lot it well he ain't gonna tell you nothin hey man no more than Paul Paulette married law what's he preaching marriage in Devon for Paul one here now about Paul didn't know nothin now I know I know there's some young guys there there's got some bravado and they think they know I'm not talking about that guy I'm not talking I got it thinks he knows it all he's some young kid I'm talking about we just assume some people assume that here oh hey God can't speak to me about my marriage to that person they don't know anything about it maybe that's why they're qualified I don't I appreciate marriage advice but I'd rather have it come from God than one of you and that maybe that quote sometimes that qualifies him to speak about it cuz he don't know if this inspiration comes from praise the Lord somebody I love you are their hope that's okay say God can't speak to me to that person Oh God amen and they shut down and listen you say that's ridiculous that's what Paul told Timothy all right he said Timothy don't let any man despise your use you know people say here that God can use you too hey man it's not just for old fogies like me God can use young people God could use a Timothy he said Timothy don't let man despise your youth now why would he say that unless somebody was gonna do it listen Timothy was called just like Paul he was cold as RIT was a son of God he was ordained he had a ministry hey man while he was saying what the messenger said listen we keep hearing preach marriage divorce and I'm not gonna do that today that's your pastors job all right touch that with a ten-foot pole if I get married something out of marriage once a brother man said he don't have a business saying that it's what the Prophet said it's what the messenger said That's not me that's not even him that's God speaking to you a man somebody he said don't let men despise you why because that's what they do say well praise the Lord brother that's a good example give you another one hey man this happened in the Bible one time in the book of Job well I'd say what job's still in the ash heap this is time a decision brother Rams head you know Joe was out there one day he'd been smitten and he lost his children and all this stuff you know the story and here come through his friend from church good old buddy so the good old boys from church come and then these were not young man these were the wise these are the a understood something about God and they tighten up their belts now let's say these men were sincere sincere could be they sat there with this man for seven days but at the end of that begin to speak to John hey man a woman gets up and said well job you know the reason you're sick is it's because there's sin in the camp now let's see you could take your quote and verify that come on somebody Norma there's sin in the camp if you're sick and there's a sick person in the church there's sense somewhere in the church and there's obviously a secret sitting in your life job obviously you've sinned somewhere and that's why you're like this now that quotes true and that's a possibility but that wasn't his case he meant some money come on now so no can say well you know what brother Brennan's head that's the right mental attitude toward any promise of God we're working to pass she you must just have the wrong attitude you must not have faith that's why you're sick now listen that quotes true and that's right but that wasn't his problem are you with me never know and you know the troubleshooter I like all troubleshooting they're trying to shoot trouble so they're shooting Joe he come up there said well Joel Bava says if you can't forgive you can't be forgiven so clearly you're in this situations as haha here in this situation because there's unforgiveness in your life joke and if you just forgive that person you have a nought against God would heal you now it's true they don't forgive us can cause you trouble is that right that's true that scriptures too but that wasn't jokes problem see when you take these scriptures we can make it support our idea amen well so so obviously you know because they didn't shake my hand Church that's why they got in a car wreck this week well so so you know they you know they they made fun of me so that's why that's what we do say we know all this this looks like that and then but the problem was they lack the inspiration to follow it hey man see what we need to know what we need this morning is not just more learning because we can learn so much sometimes till we lean on our own understanding and these men begin to lean on their own understanding well I saw this happen one time so this must be it but that wasn't it was it my mom we could talk about inspiration for hours so this is why it's the difference between life and death hey man so finally this young guy his young guy shows up named Ally her brother Brent is a representative of Christ he talked about his name breaking it down the Hebrew Ally who shows up a representative Christ and he's just something young kid some young preacher you don't know he's talking about I'm not puffing myself this isn't a promotional pitch this young guy gets up here he says you know I waited till these old guys were done because wisdom should speak in the number of days should you have a voice she said oh I read to you here he said this the Bible says in job 3:2 then was rat kindled the wrath of Allah who the son of bark held the booze I though of the kinder Ramius job in his wrath kit was and against Jo was his wrath killed because he just him saw justify himself rather than God also against his three friends was his wrath killed because they had found no answer and had condemned Joe hey man now Allah who had waited till Joe had spoken because they were elder than he and when Elijah saw that there was no answering off these men then his wrath was kindled in a line of the son of bark held the booze I'd answered and said I am young and you are very old I don't know if that was a dig or not I'm young you're very old ladies mad wherefore I was afraid and Durst not show you my opinion but there is a spirit in man hey man here's the other inspiration and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding and then don't you notice this the reason they lacked understanding is because they didn't wait for the inspiration inspiration gives the understanding here they thought German messed up they thought job and found and here God is bragging on the man the whole time and then are you're going through some things maybe you're in a situation you say why my don't lose them maybe you've got some of jobless friends trying to give you counsel listen they're trying to be helpful they're trying to help out but we have to have the inspiration that gives us the understanding what to say and what not to say hey man praise the Lord you believe that it's just great man it's pretty good right here great men are not always wise neither do the age understand judgment listen it don't matter if you're eight years old or 80 you can look up to a man see that's the he's the best preacher in the message well he'll make a mistake somewhere too I've made mistakes I'm not that one but I'm saying I've made mistakes you make mistakes and then if we're not careful we lift up a man hey man we're no longer looking at the inspiration we're looking at a personality or certain way we do things and maybe the pastor jerks had a certain weight we all jerk our head a certain way so brother Ram said that we give each other spirits listen even a great man is not immune to this it don't matter what you've been a Christian for five minutes or 50 years you're not immune to what job's friends did you're not immune to the idea of leaning on your understanding even great men are not always wise a man think about that what we think is great God thinks his foolish is that right prophet says this an investment 63 he says no man has a right to preach the gospel until secretly on the back on the backside of the desert he stood on the ground with him and God alone is there's no intellectual being in the world could explain it away from you no city must be knowing something and meeting God once you've met God there's no one that can explain that away from you and then he says that's right you were there you know it happened no matter how much they can explain it but wait something happened you know it did you saw with your eyes you talked to it he says and it talked back to you hold on somebody listen this is it talk back to you see you know it's big and you become a part of that listen hey I can't speak for all you that's why I'm here this morning that's why I preached this message and I believe this word of God I know what it did for me didn't talk about psychology he can talk about fanaticism you can sell these things I know where I was maybe you heard my testimony I think I was here a couple times go hey man listen let me say this way it amazes me how somebody can send a message search for years and they grow up and they'll walk out and tell them to come even atheists or something like that don't even believe that don't exist and you know what I say I don't see you up there too much I'm gonna have such a life before my family and before my church but if they decide they don't want to serve God and they want to walk out god forbid and do whatever they want let them never deny there was a God in their home hey man say brother man when he was tempted his little girl died said the devil knew he couldn't tell me God didn't exist I'd seen did too much already listen you can criticize this message you can say it's a bunch of nonsense but I've seen gone through too much of my life to disbelieve now if I were the backside that'd be me back saying but I know that God is real I know what he's done I know he's done for me this message is more than doctrine or just a bunch of words on tank it's a person of Jesus Christ Christ is spoken to me I owe my life even naturally I'll owe my life literally to this God that spoke to me hey man my testimony was hearing in my life and then listen what I should have passed God come to me how can I deny that God is still Savior he's still revealer I've been sick of money and let me testify God is still a healer I'm not just preaching because I read it somewhere it's a reality of my it's a reality your love there's no gods a healer because you do are sick and got delivered you hear killer Bob we're gon set you free when you were in sin and darkness separated from God Oh hallelujah and you weren't looking for God and you were running from God yet God come running for you what do you want away the enemy yeah I was pullin /do up out of the stair up yes I know I spoke to him and he spoke back to me listen that newspaper never didn't speak to me that painted fire could never speak to you if you ever got burn and wash and you meet that same guy huh he'll speak back to you hallelujah listen God's always speaking but do we take the time to listen hey man listen that's not good time I've heard God speaking my life hopefully you hear God speak all the time listen I was praying I was a young Christian I think I'm crazy that's all right helps anything about Paul listen I've prayed before I was as a young Christian I was praying in my room at 4:00 in the morning one time and I saw that same pillar of fire I didn't even know what it really wasn't time to hurt brother BAM talked about it I didn't know this must be an amber colored light no I didn't know I wasn't even I wasn't that smart it has to be smart to be visited by God Moses didn't know either at the time but a same God visited me you say brother you you sound like you're crazy much learning has made you mad but let me assure you this morning I speak the words of truth and soberness you say why are you saying this because that same pillar of fire is here today That's not me promote me that's me telling you as a child of God that same God is here with you a woman coming one time when I was them I was preaching somewhere I was done preaching she can't said when you were preacher I said she said I saw a man stand by you on the platform I said thank God for it I've never seen him do that but I believed it because I wouldn't be up here if I thought I was by myself I wouldn't want to do it you say what are you getting at brother I believe y'all bought that same guy with you this morning I'll be that same girl followed you that's not just me that's for the believer with the ends of the Lord and kept us round the back then that fear him and delivers them is that right he's going off the deep end he's lost his mind yeah and I found the mind of Christ it's so beautiful and so beautiful and so some of you you'll find the mind of Christ he's not just a God of history man praise the Lord listen listen if the Queen of Sheba if the Queen of Sheba would hear about a gift of wisdom in the life of Solomon and she traveled halfway around the world to meet this man with this gift listen that Old Stone had never talked to her the idol she'd worshipped her whole life she prayed day after day to that stone and it never did talk back she had her idols they never did speak to her but she found something she found something there Jerusalem there's a God in that man that speech Oh hallelujah listen he said that's a great thing and she would travel halfway around the world don't witness that gift but let me tell you this woman there's a greater than Solomon the team That's not me it's the Lord Jesus Christ you didn't have to travel halfway around the world this morning you just had to get up out of bed and come and prepare your heart didn't go to him he come to you oh my see I said cuz I want you to recognize who's here who's here not what we're doing who's here this morning he's here the Prophet said my ministry is just a little different than a pastor of teachers in my ministry is to declare he is here now listen if you don't recognize his here you'll walk right out of the same trouble you had when you come in the building here if Moses saw that burning hood said you know what I got too much going on down here in the real world you go up see that pill they would have been in the same condition that the day after that and the day after that listen no get so sidetracked that you miss what God's doing there's an attraction on the mountain if you go up and see this God he'll speak back to you my my you say brother you sound like you're not brother Alex he's a terrible preacher preaches we're out of a paper bag well that might be true but I'll tell you one thing I know in whom I have believed and I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and I'm persuaded I'm persuaded he's able to keep that but I've committed unto Him until that day he meant he didn't have to be the most eloquent speaker you don't have to be a preacher or a deacon you could just be a son of God a dollar god there's nothing greater than that doesn't this play preaches that I am the sons of God I don't do them no good hey man to be called a son or daughter of God to have God living on the inside of the end hey man that's what I want you to recognize this morning this inspiration is no longer just in this Bible today but he wrote it in my heart I couldn't read here where he told me to come and preach here today but he wrote something in my heart all them years ago they brought me here today he loved me when I was unlovable he saved me when I was unsinkable and tell me that his arm is not like shorter than a swatch short they can't save anymore don't tell me is there's growing heavy and then he can't hit anymore I know he's the same I praise the Lord I turn my back and then when I turned my back on his grace his mercy time after time after time yet he never took me he never forgot about me he said he's engraved in the palm of my hands that buried blood I shut camera he's written into my DNA that blood testifies that's one of my children that bloods testified for you you're one of his children he can't forget you a suckling mother can forget her child but God can't forget about you my my I think about all the times in my life I give him last place but he never given me last place he didn't say you know what you done messed up this time you know I thought you were done before but you really blew it this time when you come back I'm gonna make you take a servant's place no no he never said you take a servant's place but he was watching the whole time or I come cuffing off the dusty lane kicking my feet kind of figure out what am I gonna tell daddy how am I gonna come back to him he come running to me he said slay the fatted calf sandals on his feet my ring on his finger this is my son he was dead but now he's alive hallelujah huh he'll not give me a service place but he's called your bad news table don't settle for the pig pen don't settle for being a servant I want you to sit at my table I want you to land my right Road I want you to be my child why would you settle for something less I've given you so much more oh but daddy you don't know where I've been it's alright I'll clean you up oh my dad and I waits there that's all right I got more oh but daddy huh but daddy I rejected you I took you for granted and I rejected and I walked away from you I know son but I didn't reject you I didn't forget you I've been praying this whole time you know it's a great thing that we can pray for another but you know what Jesus prayed for me before I was even born when he was in that garden he begin to pray he said I pray not only for these but for those that believe on Sun Olney through the word that they would speak he prayed for me before I was a speck of dust that was a thought in the mind of God and he took a picture of me he saw me sinless he saw me roaring to us I didn't know I was the son of God in the world I didn't know what it meant to be Daniel John I've heard an Eagle scream I thought we just stop pecking on the ground it ain't a bunch of seed but when I saw that eagle in the sky screaming his cries and inspired me hey maybe I can fly like that too I would have never thought it was the inspiration come my way and I saw son of God I saw a wave chief lifting up the bumper things in there and it inspired me I can fly like that eagle I'm not a chicken and there was a chicken I didn't know what was different about me but I saw something today they look like what I was looking for and it inspired me to rise up a little chicken yard out of the Pigpen but I wasn't raised in a Christian home I'd seen churches that walk by all the churches on my recorder but there's nothing there that I could respond when this message come flying by my way something stirred in my heart and begin inspire me this is what the Bible talks about it's something begin to stir my heart tell you what these gainsayers they can come make fun of this and they can talk about all they want let them produce the life and then maybe I'll listen to them show me another life that lines up like this show me another witness to the Messiah like we've had and then maybe I'll even listen to you there's nothing like it you see come up with the rhythm yeah I'm talking about me too and talk about you they cannot give me what this Bible promised there's no righteousness there there's no power over come a psychologist their own idea but this message listen that eagle flies because it's sustained by an invisible power he's not flapping his wings and jumping so hard there's a power that's lifting him up to places he can't go by himself that's what I saw Oh hallelujah the inspirations in me I pray there's somebody here knows I'm talking about this morning inspired believers take the inspired word the band says this well house will you build me 1965 he says I appreciate men that will follow the leading of Christ regardless of the cost that costs them though the whole world may be your very best friends think that you're wrong but is it wrong to you as long as you feel there's something behind it it's God moving you it's never wrong it always pan out right hey man it's God moving you know pain out right go work out you know that hope you're inspired this morning when I say that to see yourself as part of it I was in a brother there's a brother in Defiant for their antique wrestling I've known him since I first got saved and the first time I went I think was 2000 2012 I believe it was I went over to Uganda the first time I had meetings overseas I come back and I print off a report and had some pictures and stuff and I don't have time to tell you about all the miracles but God was he opens blind man's eyes and raised up a lame woman and just all these different miracles and I had some pictures one of the brothers have taken and I shared that and you know and he put it up in his office now in his office here about a year ago and I notice he had put it up and I'm reading the story and the testimony man that's really good didn't realize it's talking about me [Laughter] amen and then I flip it over and I see my picture with the next page like oh oh I was there it was really inspiring but it was even more inspired when I was it was talking about me I said what are you getting at brother it's one thing for you to say man that's a real good thought what a good service but what a power thought it's nothing when your eyes I'm talking about you I'm talking about you I'm not talking about me it's human time huh when I talk about all these great things that God does I'm not talking me as a man talk about you as a believer that's one thing to see a vision but something to see yourself in the vision I thought man whoever this walnut golf just used them in a mighty way I saw it I thought now that can't be no I thought that about myself I'm reading the paper but that can't be see what we do oh I believe that God heals the sick just don't nothing can do it for me I'll believe it dog him deliver just don't know if it can do it for me oh I've watched people in church get blessed I've seen God do mighty things in people's life but I don't know if he can do it for me and that's where we missed our blessing hey man listen if I had gotten up here this morning as the musicians come let's add gotten up here this morning and I take my text I'll just read few quotes my I talk like this to you oh and I just kind of let you for a little bit you would have been disappointed amen I said no we come to hear inspired preaching we want we want to hear the message of the hour we want something with with some power in it some life in it maybe you've been to that dead old formal thing like that Queen of Sheba you don't want to go back said I've seen enough of idols I've seen enough I love religion I don't nothing do with it if I got up here and I preached without an inspiration this morning you'd have been disappointed you two walked out said man I hope he never comes back maybe some of you feel that way anyway hoping huh Judah said I would you would be so disappointed if you come here just hurt me just talk to you for a while there's no inspiration behind it amen you'd have been so upset if I just did that just come here and just kind of spread stuff to you amen because you had an expectation the inspiration of God would speak you say yeah that's good that's fine and you're right to do that but what I want to ask you is this how many of you were inspired this morning you would be disappointed if I wasn't but where are you at what was the last time you let God just deal with you you just laid in the presence of God and and let him begin to deal with your heart and speak to you and give you something you didn't just make up in your mind or just give you your own opinions a different voice hey man where's the Lord somebody was last time he just laid in the prends of God and he he spoke to you something define your own ability defied your own reasoning defied your own thinking because like I said God's always speaking but so many times we get discouraged in life God's trying to speak to us and we're we're busy trying to hold everything together and we're trying to fix fix our lives I put all the broken pieces back we're trying so hard and then maybe you're sick and body and you've run over here and you've done this and you're seeking an answer and you've tried everything you can stop trying for a second I start listening to God and then maybe you're going through the trial of your life and you've prayed and you ask people to pray and you've studied you ask the pastor you've done everything that you can do I want you to stop for just a moment amen where you're at right now we should stop for a moment and say God I want you to speak to me I've been so busy looking for the answer and you've been trying to give it to me this whole time [Music] and then stop for a moment said God speak to me moving me prevail upon me take preeminence in my life amen president Laura listen this is the time there's an altar open this morning it's not the time to shoot got a text message it's not the time to send them a postcard it's time to call conference with God and get down Sagada I'm clearing my schedule for the date I hear from you god I have a need in my life I've got something I need to hear from you I've studied I've looked at it but I need something more I need that inspiration and then I don't leave we get such a big hurry I'm not trying to tell you what to do with let's call it conference with God let's say God I I need to hear from you today if I gotta lay here and there's a pile of bones and you come so big and I've got to hear from God today I'm tired listen if you I'm tired maybe you sound I'm tired of living this life free of inspiration listen that's why we're get in a rut because this becomes going to church to us this becomes doing our duty just just doing whatever Amen we we lose that the unction the inspiration behind it we need it today it's our lifeline to refresh us do you believe that huh let's seek his face while he can be found a man brother go ahead and sing
