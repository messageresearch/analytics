[42:20] hallelujah every word of god is yea and
[42:23] a man in him
[42:25] every word of god is sure
[42:29] god said i'm not a man that i would lie
[42:32] or have to repent
[42:35] everything that god has spoken
[42:38] he fulfills it
[42:41] and whatever the need is tonight we've
[42:44] all gathered here

[43:04] for our hearts and our lives to be
[43:07] refreshed

[43:11] in this journey
[43:13] for lives and hearts to be touched
[43:15] for god to move in a special way
[43:19] i believe this meeting
[43:20] it was not just something that we came
[43:23] up with
[43:24] i believe it was arranged before the
[43:26] foundation of the world
[43:28] and it's just god giving us grace to
[43:30] come under that influence
[43:32] that this all the parts would come
[43:34] together
[43:36] and i say god
[43:37] just like where the glasses had to be
[43:39] and the handkerchief in that vision for
[43:41] it to be fulfilled
[43:43] let every part of me be right where it
[43:45] ought to be
[43:46] that the word can be fulfilled
[43:48] for every need that's right here among
[43:50] us
[43:51] god is greater
[43:54] than your need
[43:56] as a matter of fact before you ever had
[43:58] that need

[44:03] before there was ever a sin or a sinner
[44:06] he was already the savior

[1:01:09] branham said he said if jesus christ was
[1:01:12] standing here tonight
[1:01:14] in flesh right now he could no more heal
[1:01:17] you
[1:01:19] he's already done it
[1:01:21] he's already done it
[1:01:23] you were by his stripes you were healed
[1:01:26] now listen where he put it
[1:01:29] he put it in your lap
[1:01:32] he put it in my lap
[1:01:35] if we don't get what we wanted it ain't
[1:01:36] god's fault
[1:01:38] god put it in your lap
[1:01:40] put it in my lap
[1:01:42] listen the centurion soldier
[1:01:45] i'm gonna take a few before i get to the
[1:01:47] centurion soldier
[1:01:49] he was not a believer
[1:01:52] he was a centurion soldier
[1:01:54] he was sent there to watch jesus
[1:01:57] because jesus had a big crowd following
[1:01:59] him all the time
[1:02:01] so the romans wanted to make sure that
[1:02:03] he didn't do no insurrection
[1:02:06] y'all heard that word beforehand
[1:02:08] all right so they had it there
[1:02:10] and he was watching
[1:02:12] and while he was at jesus service he saw
[1:02:15] as he spoke the word
[1:02:17] things would happen he healed the sick
[1:02:19] he was casting out devils and this
[1:02:21] century because you know when when you
[1:02:23] when you uh what they call that a
[1:02:25] security guard which i'll call those
[1:02:27] agents that he'd be around for around
[1:02:28] the president or secret service so he
[1:02:31] was a secret service guy
[1:02:33] so he actually kept his eyes on what
[1:02:36] jesus was doing
[1:02:38] and so when people would come he would
[1:02:40] just say speak the word and the person
[1:02:42] would be healed he'll say something and
[1:02:45] whatever he said it came to pass now
[1:02:48] this secret servant agent which is a
[1:02:50] centurion soldier was not a believer
[1:02:53] but he paid close attention to what
[1:02:56] jesus was doing
[1:02:58] i hope you pay close attention to what
[1:03:00] jesus is doing in this day glory
[1:03:05] and while he was on duty he got a report
[1:03:08] that one of his servants where he at the
[1:03:11] house got sick was about to die and he
[1:03:13] came running to the centurion told him
[1:03:16] said look your servant that you love
[1:03:18] he's at the point of death he's about to
[1:03:19] die lord and the servant said listen
[1:03:22] he got up he went to jesus
[1:03:24] he says lord
[1:03:26] my servant is at the point of death he
[1:03:28] didn't say come heal him
[1:03:30] he said can you heal him
[1:03:35] he said jesus now jesus said i will come
[1:03:39] and i go to your house because the
[1:03:40] servant wants that to meet like a lot of
[1:03:42] people they don't be at the meeting but
[1:03:43] they want to be healed but i want to
[1:03:45] tell you you're on live screen girl if
[1:03:47] you have faith you can be healed too
[1:03:49] glory because god is not limited after
[1:03:52] this service is going to be three weeks
[1:03:53] later god's still going to be doing what
[1:03:55] he did in his service
[1:03:57] he will still be doing it
[1:03:59] three weeks later
[1:04:01] the angel of the lord would be going
[1:04:02] around taking care of business
[1:04:04] and so when the centurion said he says
[1:04:06] uh jesus said i'll cover him he said oh
[1:04:09] no
[1:04:10] oh no i've been affected by i've been
[1:04:12] watching it
[1:04:13] all right let church say amen can i say
[1:04:16] something i ain't been affected by the
[1:04:18] gospel in the message i ain't been
[1:04:20] affected by what's going on i've been
[1:04:22] affected by the prophecy
[1:04:24] and that word you need lord he said
[1:04:26] jesus said i'll come he said no you
[1:04:28] don't have to come i've been watching
[1:04:30] you a long time speak the word only
[1:04:33] and my servant will be made whole
[1:04:36] in other words he was affected by jesus
[1:04:38] christ as the word was going out he knew
[1:04:41] that if that word could create the
[1:04:42] heavens created earth it couldn't say
[1:04:44] what it what it do it will come to pass
[1:04:47] he said you don't have to come to my
[1:04:49] house
[1:04:50] hallelujah why because what he was
[1:04:52] affected some people are affected by the
[1:04:54] negative things of the message no you
[1:04:56] must be affected by the positive
[1:04:59] supernatural part of this message
[1:05:01] because it will produce christ
[1:05:04] already
[1:05:06] god they thought that was over
[1:05:10] lord jesus said i had to find this kind
[1:05:12] of faith
[1:05:13] no not one my own people
[1:05:16] oh it seemed like it was over
[1:05:19] and then they came and told them said
[1:05:20] listen your servant was a men
[1:05:22] he was healed
[1:05:24] we say oh praise the lord that's it he
[1:05:26] said what time was it
[1:05:28] what time was why because he know the
[1:05:31] word is accurate it's dust said the lord
[1:05:34] the vision got to be right the hat got
[1:05:37] to be in the right place the word has to
[1:05:38] be built and if it's right it will come
[1:05:41] to pass exactly like god said it would
[1:05:46] he says about the ninth hour
[1:05:48] he said that's exactly time you spoke to
[1:05:50] me
[1:05:51] listen
[1:05:53] they asked john
[1:05:54] who are you
[1:05:56] are you in luther's message he said no
[1:06:08] are you that prophet
[1:06:10] muhammed he wanted to be that prophet
[1:06:12] but he wasn't that prophet
[1:06:15] are you uh who are you
[1:06:17] see if you don't know who you are
[1:06:19] you don't know where you're going
[1:06:22] and you don't know where you come from
[1:06:25] what difference it make if you lost

[1:06:29] you got to know where you're going you
[1:06:31] come from god and you got to know that
[1:06:34] you're going back to god
[1:06:37] hallelujah
[1:06:38] jesus said what if you see me ascend up
[1:06:41] in which i came
[1:06:43] and they looked at him said listen we
[1:06:44] know his daddy his mama mary and joseph
[1:06:48] said what is he talking about and
[1:06:49] setting it up is he going to kill
[1:06:51] himself see they never understood his
[1:06:54] message
[1:06:55] and i want to tell you make sure you
[1:06:57] understand your message it is a
[1:06:59] supernatural message and inside i don't
[1:07:02] care if it don't look like it's going to
[1:07:03] work but if god said it going god will
[1:07:06] make it work everything for the good to
[1:07:09] them that love the lord who are the call
[1:07:11] according to his purpose
[1:07:15] glory
[1:07:17] [Music]

[1:07:22] memphis tennessee
[1:07:25] how to he was getting ready going back
[1:07:27] home
[1:07:28] and the plane
[1:07:29] you know god diverted the plane
[1:07:32] but something he said was really
[1:07:33] distracting to me he said that he says
[1:07:36] she said
[1:07:38] i am like that sugar night woman
[1:07:40] but if i'm like the schumannite woman
[1:07:43] then where's the elijah
[1:07:45] in other words god can't be wrong god
[1:07:48] can't lie
[1:07:49] god cannot be wrong i'm in the same
[1:07:51] shape as she is then where's elijah and
[1:07:55] god in his soviet grace were to make
[1:07:57] sure my word take faith
[1:08:00] i can't lie
[1:08:01] elijah is on his way
[1:08:04] and guess what he's going to louisville
[1:08:06] kentucky but i'm going to change him out
[1:08:08] i got somebody that's been affected by
[1:08:10] the prophecy
[1:08:11] and i want them to know gloria that my
[1:08:14] word will not go out boy and he turned
[1:08:17] the plane around you know what memphis
[1:08:18] tennessee at
[1:08:20] y'all close to louisville kentucky
[1:08:22] right you know what meant is that
[1:08:24] memphis is way down on the other side
[1:08:26] over there
[1:08:27] it ain't nowhere near where you all at
[1:08:31] glory
[1:08:34] and what god had a plane landing way
[1:08:36] down there go ahead it'll be easy could
[1:08:38] have landed in cleveland
[1:08:40] he could have landed in dayton this was
[1:08:42] closer
[1:08:44] but what was it god wanted no listen
[1:08:46] he's jehovah gyra
[1:08:49] god will provide for himself
[1:08:52] and he took it all the way down to
[1:08:54] memphis tennessee and got up and he
[1:08:56] knows something how many like to be led
[1:08:57] by the spirit
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:08:59] you know i found my traveling you know
[1:09:02] most people when they led by the spirit
[1:09:04] they always led to do something that
[1:09:05] they wanted led to go to another church
[1:09:07] they led to go to this list but they'll
[1:09:09] be led to take god at his word sometimes
[1:09:12] all y'all got quiet oh man good they
[1:09:14] that are led by the spirit of god they
[1:09:16] are the sons of god
[1:09:18] god will lead you and guide you to all
[1:09:20] the truth i say i'll leave that lord i
[1:09:22] told glory
[1:09:25] glory
[1:09:27] and when he got down there
[1:09:29] she had already seen the vision
[1:09:31] god had already spoke to her she got up
[1:09:33] she was praying he's got what people
[1:09:35] don't hardly do no more they pray five
[1:09:38] or ten minutes and popcorn prayer got up
[1:09:40] to lord i hope you do it lord
[1:09:42] now let me down to sleep
[1:09:44] i pray the lord my soul to keep
[1:09:47] if i should die before i wake
[1:09:49] and sometimes they don't even finish
[1:09:50] that they get up they're going to work
[1:09:54] what we need glory is the old-fashioned
[1:09:57] holy ghost revival where people take the
[1:09:59] time with god take their time to listen
[1:10:01] i know we're busy but it's just like
[1:10:03] pharaoh when when god's word came
[1:10:05] pharaoh put more and more and more and
[1:10:08] more work on the people while to try to
[1:10:11] keep them away
[1:10:12] try to keep them away from god glory but
[1:10:14] you gotta
[1:10:15] listen you gotta take your time you
[1:10:18] gotta take what you need you gotta take
[1:10:20] your prayer time you gotta take your
[1:10:22] read your bible i don't care how many
[1:10:25] jobs you got you gotta say listen this
[1:10:27] is my portion lord gave this to me and
[1:10:30] glory
[1:10:31] how many know salvation is free
[1:10:34] come without money without price you
[1:10:36] don't have to pay nothing for it all you
[1:10:38] got to do is go in there and get what
[1:10:39] you want out of it
[1:10:42] it's free don't cost you nothing
[1:10:46] remember
[1:10:47] when got down there
[1:10:49] god told her that
[1:10:50] he's going to send him he didn't say
[1:10:52] he's going to send elijah
[1:10:54] he's going to send somebody by
[1:10:56] but he described to him what he looked
[1:10:58] like
[1:10:59] what he had on
[1:11:01] what he would be
[1:11:03] carrying
[1:11:06] glory

[1:20:41] listen he kept that promise
[1:20:43] he stayed to it
[1:20:44] didn't god have a work for him
[1:20:47] glory god used him in such a mighty way
[1:20:50] why because the prophet made an effort
[1:20:53] to listen glory i'm not going to let
[1:20:54] nothing affect my body because what the
[1:20:56] holy ghost want to use
[1:20:59] [Applause]
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:04] and it had such an effect in his life
[1:21:06] when he got 16 years old he tried to
[1:21:08] smoke a cigarette they thought he was a
[1:21:12] he's a you telling young people
[1:21:13] that well i don't want to wear them you
[1:21:16] know all the other kids they can wear
[1:21:18] pants and we look funny you ought to
[1:21:20] look funny
[1:21:24] realize we are oddballs
[1:21:26] you may not realize it or not but you
[1:21:28] can lead all the world all you want to
[1:21:30] but the world thank you generalized
[1:21:31] christians they thank you in the oddball
[1:21:35] [Applause]
[1:21:38] praise god
[1:21:39] the super church
[1:21:41] you got to let the word
[1:21:43] have the effect on you
[1:21:46] it's your prophecy
[1:21:49] listen i'm just going to take a couple
[1:21:51] more and we're going to get to let
[1:21:53] church say man i'm on but i want to get
[1:21:56] to the impact of the point
[1:21:59] because a lot of us we let we be
[1:22:01] affected you know sometimes in church
[1:22:03] we deal with we let individuals affect
[1:22:06] us that's right
[1:22:08] sister so-and-so gave him 50 so i ain't
[1:22:11] got to do all that because she don't do
[1:22:13] all that
[1:22:14] brother sword so he he comes once at six
[1:22:17] at once two or three times a week
[1:22:20] don't you say nothing to me if i don't
[1:22:21] come up two times a week
[1:22:26] but people they let things like that
[1:22:28] okay oh don't get quiet let me can i
[1:22:30] preach
[1:22:31] brother branham said every church has a
[1:22:33] spirit
[1:22:35] glory my church had one your church and
[1:22:38] you got to feel like what's going on but
[1:22:40] what you need we want the holy spirit we
[1:22:43] want god holy spirit inside of us
[1:22:46] regardless of what the church do what
[1:22:48] individuals do we want to do what the
[1:22:50] holy ghost want
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] we want to be affected
[1:22:55] by the holy spirit
[1:22:57] glory because the life that you now live
[1:23:00] you live it by the revelation of the son
[1:23:02] of god
[1:23:04] glory jesus says who do men say how the
[1:23:06] son of man am yeah psalm says john the
[1:23:09] baptist or
[1:23:11] or elijah's or one of the prophets
[1:23:15] but jesus said who do you say that i am
[1:23:20] praise the lord
[1:23:22] he's a dad of the christ
[1:23:24] the son of the living god he said
[1:23:25] blessed are you simon jones amen i'd
[1:23:29] like to say it like this even i didn't
[1:23:31] reveal it to you
[1:23:35] flesh and blood has not revealed it
[1:23:37] jesus was standing there he could have
[1:23:38] said peter thank you you know i showed
[1:23:40] you what that is
[1:23:42] no no no and the pentecostal brother
[1:23:44] brown said they had it wrong they said
[1:23:46] it was upon the rock it was fun jesus
[1:23:48] christ he said it was not
[1:23:50] it wasn't built upon jesus christ
[1:23:52] it was built upon the revelation of
[1:23:55] jesus christ
[1:23:57] and he said peter glory upon this
[1:23:59] revelation i'll build my church and the
[1:24:02] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:24:04] it in other words it's built upon god
[1:24:06] revealing to you what he want done with
[1:24:09] the word
[1:24:11] glory hallelujah
[1:24:14] it's not built upon any individual
[1:24:15] organization
[1:24:17] it's built upon
[1:24:19] the revelation
[1:24:21] god come by glory hey listen god come by
[1:24:24] could be a a drunk alcoholic come out
[1:24:26] you say he ain't no could be a bomb on
[1:24:28] the street you say i don't know if he'll
[1:24:30] ever make it next time you look around
[1:24:31] he's the son of god
[1:24:34] why because god have mercy on who we
[1:24:38] will we look at things one way but god
[1:24:40] always he has the power to transform
[1:24:44] and it don't make no difference how bad
[1:24:46] a person is what day life is when god
[1:24:49] has a revelation and he can decide to
[1:24:51] reveal to them who he is
[1:24:53] god nothing can separate
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:24:59] that's the glory
[1:25:02] brother branham says this here
[1:25:04] when the healing
[1:25:06] he says
[1:25:07] in mark 16 16 says these signs shall
[1:25:11] follow them that believe
[1:25:13] in my name
[1:25:16] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:25:17] they shall recover
[1:25:19] period

[1:25:52] about them i love makai people don't
[1:25:54] like makai
[1:25:56] makai is one of those prophets that
[1:25:58] you know seemed like
[1:26:00] glory
[1:26:00] anyway
[1:26:01] makai
[1:26:03] you know think about it
[1:26:06] he was affected by
[1:26:08] elijah's prophecy
[1:26:11] sometimes when you're affected by the
[1:26:13] prophecy
[1:26:14] it ain't good
[1:26:17] it wasn't good
[1:26:18] but elijah told
[1:26:20] told uh uh he prophesied that
[1:26:24] the dogs would uh
[1:26:26] you know elijah uh eat uh what's his
[1:26:28] name ahab
[1:26:30] nigga's blood and jezreel
[1:26:33] and god got ready to fulfill that
[1:26:36] and when he got ready he was two brother
[1:26:38] he called jehoshaphat and ahab
[1:26:41] and jehoshaphat was a believer
[1:26:44] he's supposed to know better
[1:26:47] but i'm just going to say this here
[1:26:49] he was not reading the spoken word
[1:26:53] but micaiah was reading the spoken word
[1:26:56] so jehoshaphat we all brothers
[1:26:59] ain't nothing wrong with it god love us
[1:27:01] all
[1:27:02] but
[1:27:03] was reading what the prophet said elijah
[1:27:06] had said what was going to happen so
[1:27:09] when they ahab got ready to go to war
[1:27:12] he was affected by the prophecy
[1:27:15] he was not affected by the feelings of
[1:27:17] how they get all we so close together
[1:27:20] ahab and jehoshaphat he wasn't the fact
[1:27:22] that what was removing him what was
[1:27:24] moving him was can i say it brother
[1:27:27] branham's message
[1:27:28] [Applause]

[1:35:12] right in other words he was a liar and a
[1:35:14] hypocrite and a bad person but yet he
[1:35:17] know that mackay was just being what
[1:35:20] they call that in court being coerced to

[1:41:21] you
[1:41:22] what i'm gonna do
[1:41:24] i'll disguise myself
[1:41:26] you put on your king role
[1:41:29] that's what he did
[1:41:30] he he actually had jehoshaphat to dress
[1:41:34] up like a king and he dressed up like an
[1:41:36] ordinary person
[1:41:38] why because what he was so scared of the
[1:41:40] prophecy because he know god if god said
[1:41:43] it does set the lord it was going to
[1:41:45] come to pass
[1:41:46] and they got glory they was out there
[1:41:48] fighting the battle fight the battle and
[1:41:50] everybody and the king of syria

[1:41:56] king of israel kill him
[1:41:58] i don't care what you do god had already
[1:42:00] a date for for
[1:42:02] ahab to be killed
[1:42:04] all the evil stuff he'd done
[1:42:06] and they would just fight and fight
[1:42:07] fight and joseph was running for his
[1:42:09] life oh lord please help me lord they
[1:42:11] thought jehoshaphat was they have
[1:42:14] that's why don't be no false
[1:42:15] impersonators
[1:42:17] you might not know who you're
[1:42:18] impersonating
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:21] glory
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:25] you wanna you wanna be real you want to
[1:42:28] be real and all of a sudden go and they
[1:42:30] said a man just took an arrow at a
[1:42:33] he just shot the arrow
[1:42:35] gloria and ahab was going under the
[1:42:37] arrow traveled right there and hit ahab
[1:42:40] right when it's in his side and he went
[1:42:42] over there his arm hurt i'm hurt
[1:42:45] and he went over the jerry parker's
[1:42:47] chariot there and he bled to death
[1:42:49] according to the elijah's prophecy
[1:42:53] hallelujah
[1:42:54] nobody could be that accurate
[1:42:56] listen brother bradley i can see between
[1:42:58] here in the camp there ain't no silver
[1:43:00] tip grizzly nowhere
[1:43:02] he said i don't care he's jehovah gyra
[1:43:05] he can put one there of course all of a
[1:43:08] sudden
[1:43:09] and he saw that brothers at him shooting
[1:43:11] shoot him he said no i shot him with one
[1:43:13] shot and he fell at my feet
[1:43:15] what it was because god is concerned
[1:43:18] about his word
[1:43:20] and god watching over his word to the
[1:43:22] haitians
[1:43:28] dramatized sometimes they were down
[1:43:30] there crying in the boat oh lord help us
[1:43:32] to care about me perish he said jesus
[1:43:35] got up
[1:43:36] he walked on top of the boat put his
[1:43:38] foot up onto him he said he looked at
[1:43:40] the storm he said peace
[1:43:43] i want to have you finish reading it he
[1:43:45] said he turned around and went back and
[1:43:46] laid down what it was he was absolutely
[1:43:49] sure that the storm had to obey his
[1:43:51] voice
[1:43:52] and you have to be absolutely sure that
[1:43:54] when you get your healing god heal you
[1:43:56] whatever just go back lay down and
[1:43:58] forget about it
[1:44:00] they say i'm healed
[1:44:01] i'm healed
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:10] when you start
[1:44:11] dreaming and start thinking when is it
[1:44:13] right and the devil reads it through it
[1:44:16] reason is one of our worst enemies
[1:44:19] that's that's for every christian
[1:44:21] because you're built like that how many
[1:44:22] know the greatest battle ever falls
[1:44:24] it's in the mind
[1:44:26] lord you have to fight you you think you
[1:44:28] fight somebody else but actually you
[1:44:30] fight your own mind
[1:44:32] thank you brother bradley said in that
[1:44:33] message said this he says
[1:44:35] if you could get on one accord in one
[1:44:38] mind it's a great valuable fault
[1:44:39] something like that he says every person
[1:44:42] could be healed
[1:44:44] something on that order okay
[1:44:48] and and if you get on one mind on the
[1:44:50] court you come up with you can be healed
[1:44:52] not because i say it
[1:44:54] because the word promised you
[1:44:57] praise god
[1:44:59] gloria
[1:45:01] let me give you a few testimonies and
[1:45:02] i'm gonna
[1:45:03] get ready we have a prayer line this is
[1:45:05] just for me we have a lot of things bro

[1:45:15] i've seen the effects
[1:45:17] of this message

[1:45:42] are you listening god could have had him
[1:45:44] out there and you couldn't even see it

[2:05:34] church and one day i was preaching
[2:05:38] and as i was preaching i was holding a
[2:05:39] pulpit like this
[2:05:41] and something pushed me over so i moved
[2:05:43] over i know what it was and the spirit
[2:05:45] of god just sent it down like a dove and
[2:05:47] just pushed over and somebody in church
[2:05:49] took a picture and i realized they took
[2:05:51] a picture they saw a light and the light
[2:05:53] was the spirit of the dove
