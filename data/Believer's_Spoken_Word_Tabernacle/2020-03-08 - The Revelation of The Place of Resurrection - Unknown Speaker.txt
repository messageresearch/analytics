I appreciate having a brother Giri and sister Mina here and Jessica and liddy here with us yeah I appreciate them being here and so Lord willing maybe you know we don't want to put too much pressure on brother Jerry but maybe some of you can kind of get him off to the side twist his arm a little bit because we certainly we I didn't want to I left it up to him and I understand as you would too but the Lord willing we'll be able to get a chance to hear from him here and just so appreciate brother Jerry and you know I don't say this because he's my brother when I grow up I want to preach like him so you pray for me he can he can get it done in a little few minutes and sometimes I have to work or maybe sweat a little bit more so I need more wisdom on that right there the Lord to help me but I really appreciate his ministry that's I've seen the blessing here I've seen the effects of it when we've been together overseas together and I just so appreciate our brother so we want to turn into the word of the Lord this morning and I'm just going to just express some things it's just on my heart out of Genesis 23 and perhaps some of the direction I'll go it's not it's not going to be anything and of course I would never want anything to be new or strange or different we we want to be right in step with the Lord and I just believe that God has a way of taking things and unfolding it to our hearts and ministering to to the time and where we're at so we want to look here in Genesis 23 and I'm going to read a few verses of Scripture then I'll let you have your seats this morning in Genesis 23 verse 1 and Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of Sarah and Sarah died in her Jeff Arbor the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her and Abraham stood up from before his dead and speaking to the sons of Heth I want you to notice that word half it means terror he stood in the presence of terror and said I am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a burying-place with you that I may bury my dead out of sight may the Lord bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just want to speak perhaps for a few moments on yeah that right there the revelation of the place of resurrection we find we know that through the Scriptures the scriptures themselves it's all the the Bible is a complete as every scripture is given by inspiration of God it all comes together with one complete goal and one desired achievement that God would achieve and we find that in many of the lives here there were types and shadows that were laid out that would speak of redemption that would speak of the working of the Lord in Redemption and we we want to just look at this for a moment but I just want to pause here for a minute there are many places in the scripture and when we we find here in in in the Bible we find here a situation or we find what has or what has come about is sarah has passed on and Abraham in verse 2 he has come to mourn and to weep for her and you realize that you know you the mourning and the weeping that Abraham was even displaying here was because of such a love that he had for Sarah I want just not to take this just lightly we we know that brother Branham would continue to refer to Abraham and Sarah as sweethearts of the Bible and to know that within this of sweethearts in all the scriptures would refer in 1st Peter chapter 3 and I'm not going to read all of those scriptures but it would refer to how that that even Sarah in her approach to Abraham and even as it would speak of how that even those in verse 5 it would talk about even how that the holy women of all who trusted in God they adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement in reality is to understand that as a son and son of Abraham as a daughter of Abraham is that which is born of that same royal seed life remember it was Isaac himself Isaac was the the Promised One of Nathaniel good to see you man I didn't even recognize you probably cuz you got the same haircut I do pardon me but you know Isaac was the one in whom God said I will establish my covenant and we recognized that Isaac it was a type of of Christ and we see that within it you know when we look at this there's so much within it I'm not going to preach a family service here but you and you look at how that Sarah in Genesis 18 she would call Abraham Lord this was not it was made clear in the scriptures here that Abraham was not called Lord by Sarah because Sarah was afraid of Abraham the Scriptures have already declared that Abraham himself when it would even give and Express how that the the adorning should be that of a quiet and a meek spirit it should be the hidden man of the heart which is in which is not corruptible and we know that that would speak of the hidden man of it being Christ within the life of a believer we also realized that even within any marriage that within any marriage there the husband himself cannot come and begin he could but he won't work he can't demand and say well I'm head of the house or I'm this or that but remember leadership itself is to lead is to take is to take the reins by God's Word and be an example and to lead and and and let the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit just be so present in your life to think when I look at this how that Sarah herself she was not calling Abraham Lord out of fear but even there in Genesis 18 and you look when we look at that in Genesis 18 and you think about down through the previous scriptures Abraham and Sarah were on a journey together even though Sarah was not mentioned at first within that of the promise her name called out but yet she was identified with in there and God would later unfold that in in that time in Genesis 17 and when he would change Abraham's name to Abraham and he would change sorry i's name to Sarah and he or she would call him Lord and I want you to consider this she did not call Abraham Lord because Abraham had been a mistake free husband because let's remember he's one he's the one that told he's the one that told her you tell him that you know we're not husband and wife I don't want to get killed but there had to be we can go on and on down through that there had to be such a unity that was brought about of forgiveness but remember you can't have forgiveness without having love love is what brings about forgiveness love itself is what produces faith and faith is itself is based on forgiveness so it had to be something of a reality that was cultivated there in their home did they see one another's mistakes they did but you see through all the tests through all the trials through all the mistakes through all that was seen as Sarah herself she never removed herself from that leadership that God had placed her because one thing that I cannot believe that we can agree on she knew that Abraham had contact with God and when Abraham was wrong Abraham was willing to say forgive me I'm wrong this is what God has said that bring that brings a strength it brings a peace it brings a confidence and so to find that where this was such a love affair that was between Abraham and Sarah to where has we a broken here on the scriptures of where that Abraham himself would find a burying-place Sarah here he was in the land of Canaan but he there was a there was a burden upon his heart that I must find a burying-place an appropriate bearing place for Sarah and so when we look at this the Bible goes on to tell us in Genesis 23 verse 16 it says Abraham harkened under ephraim and abram way to a from the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants and the field of a front which was in Machpelah which was before Mamre the field and the cave which was there in all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders roundabouts were made sure unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth before all the dannion at the gate of his City and after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan and the field and the cave that is there and were made sure unto abraham for a position of a burying-place by the sons of Heth now in in scriptures before that abraham had requested a a Sepulcher a tomb a burial place remember if Ron here when Abraham had had had had by unction Abraham chose this of a front and he's narrowed it down I want this place right here this is where I want our dead to be buried and remember in here in the scriptures that if Ron was going to give it to Abraham for free you can have it you don't need to pay it you don't need to pay us for anything but Abraham himself he refused for it just to be given to him but he said that there must be a price that was made Abraham did not try to barter the price it was not going to be just halfway just a little bit but it will had to be what is the full required price what's the value of this and this is where Efron would let it be known four hundred shekels of silver this was in the presence in the audience of the sons of Heth and here within that moment this purchase was made the money was weighed it was determined that this money it was not just silver coins that maybe didn't have the appropriate weight but every one of these shekels had the appropriate weight let me just tell you something this was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ when Satan himself because this earth does not belong to Satan he's a squatter on this earth it belongs to Almighty God and the sons of God and when the devil took him up in Matthew Fortis would just refer to their he made and he dried to draw him into many different temptations if you fall down and worship me I'll give you all the kingdoms of this world and he said get behind me Satan hallelujah amen for thou shalt worship the Lord thy god in him alone shall worship he knew he knew by promise of the word that he would fall heir to every one of these kingdoms in the Millennium he was looking at it by that of sight and then to understand that it had to be an appropriate weight it could not be a man that was born in sin shaped in iniquity there had to come one where God would make a body God himself by that of creation God would create a body that God would be able to step down and pay the price for it could not be something that wasn't that was without the density of God's character the four hundred shekels it had to come with the very essence of this character it would be weighed in the scriptures in a just balance and it would be found that indeed this was the necessary prize and we read that in Isaiah 53 we find that price was made it was to restore what was lost in the fall to buy back the earth belong to God to buy it back we find that the scripture would go on to say in Genesis 25 we would find that where it would speak in in in in verse 8 of Genesis 25 then Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age and old men and full of years he served this purpose and was gathered to his people he goes on to speak of how that Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the Cave of Machpelah he goes on in verse 10 and says this was the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth there was Abraham buried and Sarah his wife we will find that I'm not going to read all the scriptures here that are before me but to understand that in each one of these times when it came time and Jacob's passing here they are outside of the land of promise this was the land of promise this was that where it was it was made known this is the land of promise and noticed that within and how God had revealed to Abraham that he would you know give unto his seed for a possession you know for an inheritance Jacob has outside of the land Israel's outside of the land down in Egypt and Jacob passes on but before Jacob passes Oum he under inspiration let's known to each of the tribes of Israel revealing the characteristic that was within them and also their position in the land and then within it all he would give them a commandment and said maybe I want you to go bury me in that same cave that same field where Abraham and Sarah are buried I want you to said because it is there where Isaac and Rebecca are buried it is there where I buried Leah you see he is making sure that they are going to take him to this place don't leave me in Egypt don't you bury me here in Egypt when Joseph tan would come as it would be a root of their and how that you know Joseph and the rest of of his brethren they would take they would leave Egypt and take Jacob and they would bury him there him in that Sepulcher that was there that Abraham description would always refer to it that Abraham bought and purchased he would go on Genesis and speak of Joseph of how that Joseph when he was that was at the point of dying you see because here on this earth we have no continuing City there is a purpose that God has intended for you and I had to serve it was the same thing with Abraham and Sarah there was a purpose for them to serve and we find that Joseph here he was recognizing that the time of my departure is at hand he would say unto his brother and behold I die but he made them he made them aware he said when God the God who God will surely visit you you see there was a promise that they were living by that God is going to visit you when God visits God doesn't leave you where he finds you his visit comes with a purpose and this is what Joseph is recalling the promise that was made real to Abraham it was made real to Isaac it was made real to Jacob but what had been eight promise are you listening now what had been a promise it was now a time this is no longer the and the time of a promise to come we are living in the promise in the time for the fulfillment when all the rest of the ages have looked forward to we are living in a meant to be able to declare that this is the hour this is the time this is the season and Joseph would let them know that my bones don't you leave them here you take them with you when God visits you and the Bible would record of how that Moses it would speak and express it in the book of Exodus of how that Moses took the bones of Joseph and would not leave it within that place and then it goes on in the book of Joshua and speaks of how that they are buried they bury their taking that of Joseph and they buried there in that same place of where Abraham had had made the purchase now when we look at this here there's a scripture I want to read in Deuteronomy 29:29 a little scripture but it means a lot it says the secret things belonging to the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us when God reveals his word remember revelation is sovereignly given it's not because that were any better remember God let him know and Deuteronomy 4 he said the Lord had not done this yeah you know in a manner because that you would be just for special people but he said God has kept his promise that he made unto your father's we are enjoying the revelation and even where we are sitting on the threshold of the rapture even right now the rapture which we are dwelling within even now this is the promise that God had made unto the father's these secret things their secret you can't pry them out we can't pry em out these are things that God in His sovereignty will divinely reveal and I just say it to you like this even when it comes to needs in your life and even maybe you're sitting here saying I don't see all this clearly III lord I need you to speak to me have an open heart and say Lord will you come and reveal this word me Lord reveal this message to me Lord I want it to be something that is a part of me and I'm a part of it I see what you are in the lives of letters and I want that same reality inside of me there's a witness right there that you can lay hold on and the devil he tries to tell you it's not for you God will never tell you that that's a lie from Satan hallelujah God does not work that way but there's something tugging in your heart a hunger that's in your heart that says lurid and desiring Lord for this that you and make yourself known as the brother is say it's revelation then I would say like this in humility nor reveal yourself to me [Applause] Jesus Jesus cannot refuse a heart of humility he'll come where he's invited he even came to Simon's house Simon invited him to make mockery every but listen our hearts are not inviting him to make mockery of him our hearts are inviting him because we're longing for him and we know love Jesus reveal yourself to me Lord reveal your life to me in me and through me Lord I wash your feet Lord I'll kiss the son I'll make him welcome hallelujah I welcome you in my life Lord whatever you want Lord Jesus no that's simple but that's just as simple the Lord is the devil wants to make it complicated but it ain't it's all about surrender but those things which are revealed belong and to us and to our children forever once it's revealed it can't be unrevealed once you see it you can't unsee it because this has been a sovereign divine connection where God has revealed to you revelation is not knowledge revelation is even that which you cannot explain but it's something that resonates in your heart just say it is the truth it's more real to us than anything else around us it prevails it prevails beyond our emotions it prevails beyond any stop that's contrary it prevails over complexes it prevails above every DNA of every natural tree this revelation pass prevalent power Alleluia it is a spring that is within you that is bubbling up it's a bubble and it's a bubble and it's a bubble and in my soul hallelujah there was a question there was a there's a prophet by the name of joke oldest book in the Bible joke would look and joke would see botany life he would see that there was there was there was a desire within job what happens to man yet when job is asking these questions there is that and I can't go all the way in it but yet when job is asking these questions and Joel 14 yet you will find where job is making a declaration all the town would assigned me in the grave until that wrath be passed he knew there was judgment and he knew there was something within him that knew oh there was something within him that would even cause him to pray and ask for the revelation Lord I don't know how to explain this hunger in my heart the Lord Jesus will you reveal and unfold this which is in my life hide me until thy wrath be passed he knew there was a safety place in there there was a place of refuge job how can you explain if something tells me because how do you know that job I don't know it here but there is a revelation that when I'm offering this burnt offering this offering is standing in my stand it's in my stead that I'm offering this it is my atonement it is my strength it is my Passover all the days of my life he said I wait you've got an appointed time you will call our answer Joel knew when he calls I'm gonna I'm gonna hear him you know why cuz he already had heard him he had already heard his voice if any man hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches he already had an ear he was in tune with God death does not break that signal Alleluia death does not break that signal death only brings that life into the presence of the one who has sent that signal and guarded and guided and directed that life for the days of my life I will wait till my change that word means the change of my garments shall come okay here Joe would look I see a tree cut down but yet the root the root abides it'll come forth I see the flower you see how God notice as a prophet it's directed to know that God would even hide a mystery even in that of nature oh ma we're in the time of spring you begin to look around you start feeling spring in the air you start seeing flowers come up you're looking for little buds to come up on the tree what was it it was that light that was on the tree it went into the ground it was hidden away in the winter and then the intensity of the Sun as it begins to come around it will actually cause that life to come back up into that tree what the life they went in the ground it will come back up what is it it is a resurrection [Applause] and here's job pardon me I just got a little bit warm but here's Joe Joe 19 familiar scripture these aren't words that Jill desired to have old that these were printed in a book Oh glory verse 25 of Joel 19 for I know that my Redeemer liveth I know you're never because there was there was that reality that had taken hold upon jobs life that are already taken ahold of his life and Joel said I know my Redeemer liveth you see this right here you can take that scripture and breach the Godhead because Jesus is not a separate person in man our Redeemer remember to redeem means to buy back bring back what belongs to you we always belong to God we come from God we go back to God and God came down in a body of flesh he came down under the anointing of Redeemer in order to redeem you and I back and jump said I know my redeemer liveth look wonder what he said and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth hallelujah and though look at this and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though our reins be consumed within me Jobe knew my Redeemer liveth he knew there was - it was revealed to him there is going to be a resurrection there is one that is going to stand between that of a holy God and a sinful man God himself would come down and God would span that breach between that of a sinful man and a holy God and he would span that breach for you and I that vent through the release of that life the chasm that was within our lives he would come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and remove the chasm that was between us and God it would be the abstract to the title deed it would be that which would Tyus he was that which yokes us to the word it's that which unites us are you with me this is why when it came to Syria he came and he put on VH that of life though he came what was he doing it was that of the life that would come one who was able to span the breach one who was able to do what they could not do Jove had this revelation he had it and this is where Abraham had this revelation you see it was made known to them that's why Abraham you wasn't gonna give him just anyway you ain't gonna give it to him I'm gonna buy it and not just buy anywhere I want this place right here because why it was revealed this is the place of resurrection they were in that same channel that job was in God remember we can go on and on with this God look here's Abraham election here's Jacob grace right here if we have Abraham which is which is election we have Isaac which is love we have Jacob which is Grace and brother BAM will say over and over he said anybody read the life of Jacob no you gotta believe in grace then we have Joseph's perfection what do we have the pedestal we have that foundation of which the body would be built upon the masterpiece and each one of them notice they were moved by inspiration and unction there was a spiritual insight by revelation it was that same revelation that Abel would have think of it Abel and Cain would both go to worship but Cain would take fruits and Abel would take that of one of the firstlings of the flock who told able to take what he took it was God who spoke to Abel remember Cain was only doing what he heard preached it was not revelation but you see even though their daddy and Mama because look if Adam and Eve had told them anything differ look what it would have exposed about Adam and Eve but there was something within Abel there was a long and there was a longing in both of them to worship but with enable there was a longing to get back to life there was a long he didn't put that longing in there and unit put that in your life you might have tried to satisfy with a lot of other things but that terms can only be quenched by the lord himself you can't satisfy that first with the things of the world it only leaves you empty it only brings death but pad of God when you begin to satisfy that first on the inside and say Lord Jesus seal me Lord God Lord speak to my heart Lord leave me but I'll tell you you begin to be led from death unto life you led to a place of victory in your life people did not do this Abraham did not do it Joe they did not make it happen it was sovereignly given it was a mystery that was in their life and the only way a mystery becomes clear it's got to come where God will come personally and he will teach that to you and I your life and my life he came back to like the Tabernacle in the wilderness a man can unpack my life but the Lord Jesus I don't know Kassadin he unpacks our life and unfolds the secret of the mystery of our life he's the one Michael that revealed to my heart this is why I couldn't fit in with the world he's the reason little Aaron that's the reason it was always something about it in my life why was I different I tried to fit in I tried to fit in Mathew but there was something about it I just couldn't fit in you know what that was it was the mystery that was hidden there in your life [Applause] hallelujah didn't know what it was I tried to escape it I did everything it looked like going the opposite way I didn't know what was going on but one day one day he began to speak to my life and say you're different you're not like the rest what was he doing he was calling us and to himself and you can never be the same you can never be the same you have been changed he has come and brought deliverance and it keeps on unpack in your life this is where the candlesticks goes this is who you know married this he keeps on unpacking in your life because after all your life is what set aside as a life of service unto the Lord don't you loving they this revelation it struck their hearts there's a resurrection in that resurrection it's not in Egypt it's not just anywhere it's in Palestine that was of that was God's revelation to them now remember this is the literal will transfer over here into the spell that was a type of the spiritual but remember that was a clear revelation you could have tried to brother William put pressure on earth you don't need to go and bury him down there why don't run you gotta bear it down here why you got to do this for why do you have to do that let me preach this a moment you know Abraham bought that place right you'll read in the book of Acts chapter 7 and then you also read it in a place there in the book of Genesis you read to where he would actually display how it had changed hands and here Jacob would come with a price you know why it cost there is a price that every one of us must pay he made a way for you and I but the price that you and I have to pay is not with money it's with our lives he's here one road in the Bible there one road in here that that was my rope but it was a between the lines they were prophets and it was revealed to them that the first fruits was going to come out of Palestine now let's look here after Lord Jesus when he came he said in John 6:38 I'm come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that see if the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day but the sender I don't know how I'm gonna do it isn't about how you're going to do it this is him keeping his word what do I do lift up your eyes look to Mount Moriah all of everything else is going around lift up your eyes for it is there that God made it comes confirmation of that covenant it is the Lord Himself that provides the strength that you and I have need of for the body change that is already resting in our bosom he is Jehovah Jireh it's not us making something happen it's a quickening quickening quickening quickening the Prophet said we keep quickening and keep growing up until we grow up in him in rapture so what do I do by the same to keep looking in the word God deals with your hearts on things so thank you Lord it mold me shape me keep on keep on just letting God work because it's him that's working the Lord will perfect that which concerns me here came Jesus to the tomb of Lazarus and remember when Jesus came he wept Lazarus was his friend he stayed in their homes many times you with me maybe they had Friday night tape meeting so me I'll catch it on that one it moved him he wept Martha you know when she came Jesus told her said in verse 23 my brother shall rise again and Martha said I know he shall rise again in the resurrection in the last day see she believes in the resurrection but Jesus was coming to announce right there that I am the resurrection and the life he was announcing the very one that racism in the resurrection he has come down I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me not only in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this you ever think of this for a moment maybe I'm odd but Lazarus he goes by the way of the grave there's others brother just wait waiting in paradise Lazarus goes into paradise and remember here they are sitting around brother ray their fellowship you know any secrets on ma'amed I know I saw I know what I saw I saw the will in the middle of will they're all sitting around fellowship and here comes Lazarus right among Lazarus said hey you know what he's on earth now [Applause] let's rest made an announcement in Paradise the one that you saw you've been waiting on he's on earth now Alleluia man they probably had a praise break going all in Paradise town their every praise is to uh I mean you know because what was that they were ready they had been looking for this and the announcement came Lazarus said the one that you've been waiting on is on earth Lazarus said why we're here we're getting ready gonna be at any moment let's just fellowship a little bit Lazarus didn't know he was gonna be there for a little bit and he got called back out of there oh brother you think about what kind of a stir was going on in Paradise I'm telling you they were not around with their feet propped up sure they were resting but brother has their time itself was drawing nigh no doubt when that announcement came it stirred him up I mean they had to be stirred up like bees in a hive because this is what they had been waiting on this has what this is what had caused them to act the way they acted and talk the way they talk and move from here to there it this is the one [Music] and no Lazarus didn't write no book series been there and back he had a testimony though he said in John 14 let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also how many looking for that and whither I go you know and the way you know Thomas said Lord we know not whither thou goest how can we how can we know the way Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me all the recognize that after what was needed to be done with the depositing paying the penalty of sin and the unloading of sin has our scapegoat then we found that the Lord Jesus himself he taking their of the keys of death and hail from offer of Satan and now he moves into paradise and he begins to gather all of them and as they themselves already had a testimony now here he comes and when he comes brother Drake everyone could say that's the one that I saw Abraham said that's the one that came to a Sarah this is the lon Ezekiel said that's the one I saw and he led captivity captive the price had been prayed the ransom had come a messenger had delivered the ransom and the Bible says in Matthew 27 52 and the graves were opened loose and many bodies of the saints which slept arose oh yeah and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many he came out first they followed him now notice the Bible would go out remember has it said here and many of the bodies of the saints not all many there were many that had been buried in Palestine but not all of them were buried with Revelation not all were buried with this revelation in their heart but many could say this is where we as a Israel or as a Jew this is where we're to be buried and you know even how it speaks and as a ax and how that you know it just become a common thing and where we just bury here this is where were this is where were to be buried and he wasn't anything that was personal but you see what job it was personal I know my redeemer literally it was personal with Abraham it was personal with Sarah it was personal with all of the patriarchs down through there and this is why the scripture would say in the book of Hebrews these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off there's many that's went by the way of the grave but they were aware that the promise of the rapture is in this hour they see them they seen it back eyes of faith and were look witnesses were persuaded of them when you're persuaded nobody can talk you out of it I'm not talking about a natural argument I'm not talking about up here I'm talking about where you are fairly persuaded by the love of God in your heart to where you yourself are no longer depending on your own righteousness but you are depending solidly on the righteousness of Almighty God and to know that my life is hidden in him they were persuaded and embrace them took them next to their bosom their life revolved around this others didn't understand well I can't should go here well why can't you go there why can't you do this why can't you just you know and I'm not even talking about sin but it was something to them that said this is what God has revealed to me and so every decision when it came to a job when you would go on and on they embraced these promises and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth this same reality Paul would write child that this glorious reality the purpose and the grace that was given to us before the world began which was in Christ Jesus Paul would write in second Timothy 1:10 but now is made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel where until I'm appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles God had brought it to light God has showed it all think about it they put up a seal on that tomb and said go make it sure they were trying to make that tomb sure as though he couldn't race he was not going to raise by his own strength come on it was that same quickening power they meant God living behind that veil of flesh it broke the seal a man-made seal it was man selling out that brought death in the beginning we understand that of the garden I don't need to go through that with a woman I've been here with the man but notice with that seal that was there he it had been a mystery it had been all their lifetime ever I can say like this and Hebrews 2 subject to the fear of death in other words the sons of Heth the sons of terror terror was all around but one would stand in the midst of terror and say I'll purchase this one was willing to go right in the myth of the terror of the heart of the arrows and was able to stand there and say I will purchase a bearing place hallelujah that we might have peace here's our peace he stood in the midst hallelujah for you and I and he has brought this him mortality and life to light through the gospel the seal the Roman seal was broken that message that had been sealed up was unsealed he broke the seals to reveal that secret of life after death he was the answer the one that was made known to Joel Abraham and on and on he was that very one he trapped openly over principalities he led captivity captive they he led them up after his resurrection they came out and they followed him in a procession of triumph and victory Paul would write he was the firstfruits you know the firstfruits are the one that come to maturity first the firstfruits were always that that God would have among the children of Israel to identify the firstfruits that the first church would always be identifiable and what the firstfruits himself ought to be that which has taken and offered unto the Lord it's that which is to be brought in the house of the Lord and the firstfruits come on now you see it God's just the firstfruits now firstfruits all those things that ties in tithing and those things like that listen God just don't ask you and me to pay ties he's a tithe payer he takes her tithes of all the earth come on now he takes the tithes of our life what's the tide of our life our soul the firstfruits call there is a time there is that which is brought into the house of the Lord lives that our surrender remember what does the tide do it comes to sustain the work of the ministry and the tithing of the Lord where God would call our hearts and our lives to him so that his life might be preeminent in our lives and fully minister as coworkers and redemption Oh glory be to God firstfruits he Christ became the firstfruits of them that slept remember Enoch was raptured Elijah was raptured neither one of them tasted death they went in rapture but here came Jesus the Keystone the Keystone he died rose again and win in rapture the man it was the Keystone that passed together the old and the New Testament and the Keystone is that part in the triumphal arch that joins both side of the arch together and it was showing and declaring that the blood that had been shed in pipe and then this over here here is the Keystone here is the very one that joins it all together they that were dead he raised they had died in in Waiting died in the faith looking afar off mmm I got a read description I keep coming around this thing and he Hosea 13 14 this not only pertains to Israel this pertains this was an announcement by the Lord Jesus himself and Hosea 13 14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave I will redeem them from death Oh death I will be pipe legs Oh grave I will be vile destruction meta doctrine the person that's why he could say there then revelations one wouldn't even make himself known to John John said I fell at his feet had dead and what did he do he came to minister to John he said I am he that was dead and I'm alive forevermore I have the keys nobody could say they were dead than alive people could say I'm alive and now passed on but normally this one said this is the key stone he was he wasn't purchasing a burying-place paradise done away with he was making a place for you and I that we could come in into that for a resurrection if we go by the way of the grave he made the way for him that place is where the rapture will take place hallelujah this is why the scripture would say notice how distinct it is and and please bear with me just a few moments here in revelations 14 13 I heard a voice from heaven saying write blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth yeh says the Lord they that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow him in Revelation 20 verse 5 and the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years what a promise that's given through and by our Lord Jesus he purchased the burying place for you and I that you and I could be buried in him [Applause] that is why that we are buried in the baptism we are buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins we are showing that we are identifying in his death and when you come up we are declaring but I'm no longer the same man that went down I'm identifying in a newness of life and then he comes and does what no man can do and that is baptize you into the body that's what the Holy Ghost does if that passes you into the place of Resurrection and rapture this is why Paul would would would would would express even that in his own life he said I want to be found in him in Philippians 3:9 not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him you see these words if you just take them if there's something that you seemed like in your mind and you say I don't understand that just take the words that even being said right here and just pray Lord I want to know you I want to know you I want to know you that's all it takes then I may know him and the power is resurrection the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto which the word unto their means out of the resurrection of the Dead see there is the promise of the first resurrection there is the promise because the Bible go on to declare in many places Daniel 12 John 5 on and on even in the book of Revelation in different places where there will be a resurrection of all together but you want to be identified in that first resurrection he provided a place for you and I that we could come to oh my this is what Paul would go on in that chapter you know he would talk about his life he wasn't living you know living as though I got it made already Paul seen many things God had already quicken his life but with that what it did for Paul said I want to know him more I want to apprehend that with just later hold on my life Paul would say not as though have we're perfect not as though I had already attained this one thing I do as Paul would write I want to be after he I want to apprehend that which I'm apprehended of this is why the scriptures I know from the your scripture to us this is why the Bible has it would write in first first Thessalonians 4:13 I would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope we're sorrowing will miss them here in this lifetime but we've got a promise mother duck brother bill mama brother herb I forget anybody else you forgive me for brother Claudio and sister Dolores we've got that promise we are in expectation not that you're going to have to do this but if I were you one thing would be would be one thing you start getting used to looking at a picture between 18 and 25 [Applause] remember just as the word is being revealed to you it has been revealed to you when they appear brother you know it it'll be revealed to you you'll recognize them you'll know I'm brother Richard you might not have seen them on their 18th birthday but you'll know hallelujah just as sure as we know this bearing place that is sovereignly being revealed by God Himself hallelujah that picture brother Bill of Sister Mary and God's photo album it's not a picture of sickness it's not a picture of sorrow it's not a picture where her feet are this way everything is in perfection the same God but you have served the Lord you've been grace of the heirs of life together you'll walk together down those streets of gold just as Abraham and Sarah from the Dove just as you and sister Betsy you will walk together for they better dead in Christ shall rise first there'll be a fellowship upon the earth of about forty days hallelujah mama you got a plumber with dad finally have to preach I've run we've got an appointment here there's an expectation they're sleeping as far as has it's turned in the scripture but they're more alive than we are they're not eating it's sleeping over there right in hell they're waiting to come back and take home glorified bodies glorified bodies because it is not a body that was made by man it was made by the glory of God hey man when we even as we step even right now in our soul its clarifying Jesus when we step from here into that other into that other body it's the way that's been made it's glorifying Jesus when we when we when we return to take a bit glorified body it's glorifying Jesus what is it it is called that he is manifesting the glory of Jesus Christ now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or say unto Him be glory in the church forever without end amen the Lord himself shall descend with a shout these were scriptures in previous these were scriptures that they've been waiting on but now is the hour where the Lord Himself has made his descent we're still waiting on the corporal body but the Lord Himself the fullness of the Spirit the word here he is descending in a shout a message that has gone out just like that message got a hold of Abraham that message got a hold of Isaac that message got a hold of Jacob you might look and say that was their daddy telling him that their daddy might have told him that because what had been revealed now belong to them and their children but they required God to make it a personal revelation in their heart but it wasn't their daddy's revelation it became their personal revelation and with the voice of the Archangel all he does offer me what has coming down the voice of the Archangel calling them from the graves but saying is everybody gonna raise at this time only the elect those who died in the faith those who hold in that revelation thank God for others that are saved and under don't understand me I just don't want to go that down going in that route but think about this here is the grace of Almighty God that would come into that moment and here they would hear the voice of God you ever think of that the voice of the Archangel hit ain't Jesus going Jesus never went down there and said all right everybody raise up it was the fulfillment of the word in his life it unlocked it unlocked they without us cannot be made perfect it's a fulfillment of that word listen it was a prophecy a word that's being fulfilled and sounded out through our lives has an effect very simple I know but that has an effect in your home that word sounding out it has effect it brings leadership in the home it brings stability in the home it brings love courage and ability in the hall then we which are alive and remain notice then the Trump of God shall sound gather together for the wedding supper we meet him in the air Alleluia now we meet him in the air here we are and fellowshipping with one another praise God brother you made it praise God sister you made it praise God you know to think of how this was going on and then after that time remember brother Brent said he gives us that time of about 40 days he said because we knows that if he would come before that time you I would be too busy looking at who made it and who didn't he said he wants all asked to be on him so he allows us that time to gather around and that's exactly I'm telling you you talk about these little times like this like the Bible says in the book of Thessalonians our gathering unto Him these are only foretaste of the glory of Almighty God what it does for us now to look around and see somebody and say praise God good to see in church this morning soldier good to see in church this morning think about it home that wraps your morning when we are standing there we'll be looking at one another and say praise God we made it by the grace of Almighty God hey man for my looking at were looking for one another so thankful for one another rather we made it by the grace of Almighty God and then the trumpet sounds and we behold him he wants full attention he's got everything prepared he's got the for a rotten meeting place he's already provided the garment already provided the ring he's already provided everything that we have need of a man he opened up that place so we can meet him in the expanse between the heavens and the earth he opened up that place that we could come right back home oh my to think of it now let me just bring it down I said a few more minutes I'll let you know when I get started on those moments but to recognize no no no comments about that brother Doug will when we understand this right here that that within Palestine it was speaking day had a revelation there was going to be that literally and there was a resurrection that was there but that was speaking of the type as we've been speaking of this those that are dead in Christ those that sleep in Christ those are sleep in Jesus will God bring with him all of these promises were speaking of a provided place for you and I inside of Jesus Christ and in there it really there might be one down in Africa there might be one out in the bush in Ghana there might be one that's way down on the south tip of South Africa there'd be one there in Costa Rica you know you're not talking about has they all spread out but remember there is one place for us to be gathered there is one place of Resurrection and one place of rapture and that is in Jesus Christ hey man hey man in that one place and I want you to hear these words the Prophet would say it just like this and questions answer 64 he said I'm saying this to you in the name of a profit in the name of a profit the resurrection and rapture will be general all over the entire world no matter where you're at when that hour comes you'll be caught up to meet him there's nothing going to stop you no matter where you are oh what promises we have and you recognize wow I don't know what happened here wire it up and not for blast-off but we have this promise in our bosom Paul would say the earnest in other place he would say we have the firstfruits of the Spirit we're waiting for the redemption of the body because remember the atonement was a dual atonement it was the atonement to pay the sin debt for our soul and it was also to pay for the redemption of the body I love that the sinner of the King James Bible is Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name who forgiveth all thine iniquities first part of the atonement come on now and who healeth all than diseases [Music] amen hey man it begins with the healing of the soul this body can still get sick but the earnest has already come on the inside you say what's that earnest well that earnest sometimes alone
