========================================

and this but are you a lamb because a lamb doesn't love to root in dirt and mud notice the dove takes its flight the Holy Spirit leaves and many times you wonder why we can't have the peace that we used to have there's something took the devil away let me tell you something it's not the other person's fault sometimes we live in such a day and age and a civilization that you wonder sometimes are there any grown-ups anymore it's just like the time where Cain well well Lord no you lay so much on me but I can't even bear it ain't so-and-so's fault if peace leaves your life you don't know my co-worker you don't know my wife you don't know my husband it's not their fault it's you've got an access to a source it's your choice whether peace leads you or not you can live in this world and not be of this world do not allow the enemy to sell you short we're either Sons and Daughters of God and we've got a jurisdiction and an authority and we've got an authority over our own mind I've got an authority over my spirit come on Church and even the greatest thing that no man have been able to entertain and that's our big fat mouth our tongues sorry maybe you got a little fat mouth notice this time remember I'm saying no wonder we can't have the type of meetings that we used to have you got to come back to being sheep and the devs sitting on the roost Hallelujah glory to God you know that's why I tell you it all to be such a place that things that oh so and so made me do it oh this made me do it the no nobody made you do anything remember both of them said you cannot say the devil made me do it he said all you're saying is you weren't sealed in because if you're sealed in he can't get to you come on Church but we're living in a day it's easy to blame somebody else so you mean somebody else's spirit is greater than the spirit of God in you that's if you've got the spirit of God hello help me preach now oh brother Samuel that's hard but it'll help us remain useful he's still the Dove and notice said you can't snort and fuss and Grumble and back bite and everything else and expect him to stay there he won't do it because he's not natured that way let me just move on from here in First Peter chapter 3 verse 8 finally be all of One mind that's a challenge now that being all in one mind it doesn't mean that we're all going to be thinking the same way we all have our preferences on worship all have our preferences on Ministry have our preferences on all these other things you know why because the Holy Ghost does not change the preferences or our inclinations he only sits down in the middle of it are you hearing me but what does this mean to be of one of mine does that mean that brother Bill and I have got to think exactly alike that is not what it's saying it is saying the same thing it did in Acts 2 before the holy ghost ever came they were in one mind and one Accord and you know what that brace means one mind one Accord there in the book of Acts it means a variety of different notes that have surrendered their notation into that of a music sheet in order to make a harmonious flaw if I got up here and started planking the same note on the piano you say get down man there ain't no song being played there you sound worse than a preschooler up there trying to plan something out you want something that's got notes highs and lows it's a Melody is that right that's how it is in a body so notice in order for God to move to be of one mind now what does that mean I've gotten my Little Goat my note might be a sixteenth you might be an eighth yours might be a hole yours might be a quarter but let's surrender it it's already a part of the music sheet of God I don't want to take it back I don't want to take it back under my own rights I want to surrender it bet this Symphony can go on having compassion one of Another Love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for raring railing but contrast blessing in other words evil comes we come right back with evil how can I do you on that one you're gonna post it on me like that I'll show you I put a post on you and we ain't talking about basketball either oh yeah because it's got to a place it in face to face anymore it's just somebody has a disagreement they just make their laundry known on Facebook and Instagram I'm gonna tell you what you need to do with that dirty laundry because sooner or later if you don't get that dirty laundry cleaned and get whatever it is that's causing you to be a continual dispenser of dirty laundry if you don't get that cleaned out it will stand against you at the day of judgment because the Bible says my Bible says blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the child of God my mama knowing that ye are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing now notice how Peter is giving this to the individual that this is an entrustment in our lives that we would make sure that the inner man is clear nothing is built up because you know what build up equals build up equals blow up like a pressure cooker you know that's one thing that scared me about pressure cookers you know we didn't we didn't have it for a while we did have a pressure cooker we never used it we had a pressure cooker I thought my wife and I well you know we had a pressure cooker but finally when the instant pot came along and we got the instant pot well that's a pressure cooker I guess it's a little bit more safe than the other ones because I heard all kinds of stories about pressure cookers and them things just blowing up and potatoes going everywhere and all I thought Lord I don't want nothing like that going off so you know what I I will fix potato some other way it might be really good in the pressure cooker you fix them I'll eat them but I didn't want that thing blowing up I know it tenderizes meat real good but we'll just stick with the instant pot right now but how many knows that there is a little valve on that pressure cooker that all of a sudden when it says instapot it might take 10 minutes to cook your meal but it takes a whole lot of time to build up the pressure for a little bit of time of cooking and then you've got to wait for that sometimes when I ask my wife honey is it almost ready because by that time it's been hours since I've eaten you know and there's some of that angry strip coming up in there is it almost ready and you know she says just hold pot papa bear and all of a sudden all you hear is it seems like that goes on and on and on oh friends we have a release valve in Jesus Christ it's not just for a moment or two but we can release the pressure in him so we don't blow up on everybody else [Applause] for he that will love life how many of you love life I do I do and see good days how many like seeing good days I mean I love the beautiful weather we've just had the past few days at sunshine and things like that but I'm just talking about more than just beautiful days I'm talking about good days now here's the secret to it let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile once again how many we love life love good days this is the recipe right here let him verse 11 is skew evil that that word Askew means to depart from it it doesn't necessarily mean that you turn and walk the opposite way but evil itself can be coming towards you being projected towards you but don't turn around and project the same thing back let them depart from Evil rescue it and do good let him seek peace and ensue it I love peace I love peace as a husband I love peace as a father I love peace in my home I tell you it bothers me I know it bothers my wife too that if we've had some intense discussion I don't like that to stay there I don't like that I'm not telling you that to build my I just don't like it you know why because I know one thing for sure no matter what it is it's displeasing to the Lord and he he gave me that home I want him to be in that home because without him it nothing else matters so that's why I always apologize first I'm just tease how's that for humility but I don't I like pieces of pasture I love peace why Amber the same you love peace well you can say well that's in your makeup to be peaceful but there's something deep deeper than my makeup it's the peace of God in my life that's what it is in your life we love peace as a Christian you love peace even at times in order to have peace it means sometimes not even saying something that you might know something about why I'm pursuing peace and I go just a little bit further watch out brother Branham he picks this up and he's in this quote he's talking about this real Display of Power talking about how they put a rag these what I just read to you in First Peter they're how they put the rag on his head beat him tell us who hit you tell us who hit you if you're the Son of God pulling hairs from his beard spitting on him on him and yet he opened not his mouth and reviled back now that may not be them pulling your beard hair because you may not have beard hair or you may not have hair like me but sometimes it's pulling our chains pulling on the buttons or pushing them come on now if those buttons didn't work we would doubt whether the remote worked or not in our life but think of this watch how brother Brown puts this out what was it a paragraph there from from that time how could Satan sit that man be God in the message from that time a man that could take the challenge of a priest I don't know who's back there run it for me please a man that could take the challenge of a priest and let a drunken Soldier spit in his face today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming returning good for evil that's real power now he didn't talk about real powders real power because we're all sometimes maybe more of us some of us are better powders enough if things go our way everybody knows and if it's not everybody knows it it's silent treatment how's it doing it's okay this is real power every one of us will sign up for the power of when I lay my hands on them and I prayed for them oh brother Samuel What miracles but what a miracle to be overcome our own will to bring this man in subjection when evil evil are you hearing me that you can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God power how many want God's power that's what I want God power Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not I love you here have this thank you Maniacs can break chains we don't want that kind of power we don't want that kind of power but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not because of a religious duty but from his heart I mean he knows the love of God displays convicting power can I have just five more minutes okay go ahead you can time me on it Paul refers to the scriptures in the Book of Romans read them out of proverbs Proverbs 25 21 if thine enemy you know their name be hungry give them bread to eat not the stale moldy thrown out bread not the bread that you wouldn't well I'll give this to the dogs no give them the bread that you would give them bread to eat and if he'd be thirsty give him water to drink for Thou shalt he calls a fire upon his head now this this whole phrase is not being vindictive I'm going to give you bread and I'm going to burn you up I'm gonna roast you here you want some water you want some bread pick it and by doing so you'll keep coals of fire on their head of eat it drink it and enjoy it no you know what I'm saying is the truth you know what I'm saying is the truth here that's why all that nervous laughter is going on for Thou shalt eat coals of fire upon his head and oh I love this part and the Lord ciao reward be who gets rewarded they receive nourishment strength you know why they're making the noise they're making because they're hungry brother Branham said the person who makes the most noise means they're a sick person and they need to be attended to by the doctor and what they need is a good attention with the Holy Ghost so what should I do live so that the Holy Spirit can be there for their lives that they can say that's what I want and the Lord shall reward thee oh my my my my my my notice I I told you five minutes I've only been two minutes here I can tell so Mr Patsy you didn't have your timer going anyhow notice this remember what Paul said at the end here in Romans 12 21 Paul referred to those scriptures out of proverbs he said be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good foreign I refer to this one here and I am going to close how many remember the the infidel the brother Branham led to the Lord remember up there with the apple tree and he remembered that remember that story I got to listen this and I've listened to this throughout the times of years and I'd Ponder on it you know and I just never went back and picked it up but I thought he I think he's talking about that that particular wife of that man that he had led to the Lord and he was but the brand will tell it in two different couple different places but he talks about how he went back up there squirrel hunting because remember you've been given permission to go up there and squirrel hunt and so brother Brandon went up there and he's coming back to the car after hunting him and maybe brother Woods was with him that time he didn't he didn't say here but she comes out on the porch and she just starts in on brother Branham reverse she is just like you young people think you can walk all over us older people think you can do this I know what you was going to do you drive through this property you tear it up and brother Brandon he's dramatizing it in that way she's going through that way and she's going and brother Brahm is standing there and he's dramatizing he's telling I said ma'am sisters that I no he said that's not something we came to he said but if you look over there he says if I drive through that area you're telling me to drive through our car is going to get stuck we can't make it through that field but remember said she just kept on going on kept on going on kept brother Graham says he began to talk to her she kept on you know with this and saying these things and going in you know she was troubled I mean you know look she was an older person she was also troubled and everything but look how she had jumped to that conclusion all just jumping and we're going to fire away right now but once his brother Brian started talking to her and she realized she said my husband he said yes sister he said I got permission he said we have permission from your husband he said is he still living He said all of a sudden her lips started quivering she said oh you're not brother Branham are you and she said brother Brandon she said I want you to know he died singing the Praises of God he went on home to be with the Lord and this is what she said if I can read this and why people are so tossed about she said forgive me her lips started quivering she started crying she said I'm a backslidden Methodist I'm ashamed of the way I acted the way I did and I said God bless you Sister go back to church won't you serve the Lord Jesus now watch this counsel brother Ram said see if you had jumped out there and started fussing at her telling her you did have a right and so forth you see what you'd have done but just a few words of love goes on down to the heart I don't want to be a fuss bucket who was saying I got rights now remember remember brother Brandon knew he had rights he had that signed right but what was he doing not rendering evil he did not enter in Under The Same Spirit that he was being attacked but he stayed veiled in the presence of God let me just say this that's not only for the prophet that's for you and I brother Brandon didn't that was not told for you and either we would say oh brother Branham no God was letting you and I see this is what a Son of God was able to do you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you have the same god-given Authority and ability aren't you grateful for that to know I say Lord I want I want to surrender to that inward man I want to surrender to that inward man yes rights but I don't want my rights because my rights if I will go after my rights it'll grieve you away from me so help me in the midst of this time help me Lord help me to stay here in the midst of this time Samuel this didn't have to happen or that didn't I know that I spent countless times sometimes even with those that I got in my classroom if this would have only been sorted out the right way I wouldn't have got them but God knows I needed some of them and you heard me tell the story years ago I don't know 18 years ago or whatever and the Holy Spirit I begin to pray about it sitting there and you would think a little little person could hide I loved I love those kids so you know you you love doing things you love teaching them you love seeing them grow you love but then things that are coming at you and coming desk and cursing at you and things that are coming your way and I looked at it and you know what I had become bitter and the Holy Spirit I never forget it Monday morning getting ready to go back after Thanksgiving break he said you better release that bitterness out of your life it'll affect everybody now one that had become so grown and mounted up but I'm thankful to God that it was able to be identified what it was because think about it not only would it affect in my marriage it affected my home it affected the church it affected everybody around me I don't want that God help me I've got to place you and I've got a place where we can go to there is a fountain open in the House of David Glory there's a place open that we can go we can bathe we can clean we can let off the pressure in him and say Lord you understand let me close here prayer God help me help us Lord help me help every one of us help me Lord to move into that place help me Lord to operate to live in that place you know brother Randy he talks about many other places I've got to go into but one of the things that continues to come over and over and over is standing in prayer and I think our brother ran them two different places that I have founded here within the message familiar quotes to as many of us we've referred to when brother Brown talks about when something has happened somebody's done you wrong somebody's done the evil or something brother Brian says when you can take them to the throne of God and stand shoulder to shoulder with them before the presence of God not face to face no but shoulder to shoulder this is my brother oh my brother Samuel they don't deserve to be brought in the prince of God you are I have not deserved to be brought into Prince of God but here to be useful a useful moment to live for somebody else that's the kind of life I want to live or it may not be we may not walk on Waters we may not you know may never speak in tongues or you may never do this but you know what I want to be a useful life because when it's all said and done I want to know that my life has been useful has been helpful along the way helpful in a manner maybe it's keeping something to myself maybe it's overlooking it's going Beyond something I want to be a useful life God knows that we need him you love him tonight God bless you tonight may he help us that's my prayer may he help us this is a tall task but I'm grateful there is one in US greater is he that is in US it's a tall task but greater is he that's within us remember if I could just give my hand if this is the way he's directing me if I'll just lean into him he'll guide me in that's overcoming now that might not be the overcoming that you ever give up and give a testimony about you know brother William I'm going to give a testimony to the glory of God I had some bad thoughts about you but to the rest of the church I want to say God gave me those Grace to overcome those thoughts against you no those are not the kind of things that we will do you see so much of the overcoming that goes on in our life will never ever testify about it but it's just as glorious because it makes a way for those things that God wants to be testified of amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you for your mercy Lord tonight I thank you Lord for helping us here Lord and looking over some of these things Lord your God even as you begin to direct me Lord some time ago and not knowing Lord when we would enter into this of a useful life if this would be a certain Avenue but Lord as I think of it knowing that in our lives there is a battle that is Raging a battle that is on and Lord I believe I'm talking to Children Of God tonight as myself that want to remain useful not for our Glory but Lord as long as I'm here upon this Earth I don't want to go off in a corner I don't want to go off and get in the toolbox and say I ain't letting nobody put their hands on me again I don't want Lord I Want To Live every moment for your glory Lord to think of it clear up to the last moments on the cross there was a usefulness when there were two mouth actors and one was their mocking and the other turned and said Lord remember me when you come in to your glory to Paradise remember me remember me and that life that would remain useful Lord even while all of the accusations was still going on well you were nailed to the cross Thou shalt be with me this day in paradise even to the last moment Lord that's the kind of lives Lord that we want to live we don't know our last moments we don't know the longevity of our life but now we are here we believe there's a purpose that we're to serve For Your Glory and we want to remain useful Lord would you help us every one of us I Lord I've got my hands up my heart up the Lord help us Lord Satan with love to Lord pack things in and bring in encroachment in our life Lord God like plaque would build up on the Lord the inner walls the lord of the arteries leading to the Heart Lord so Lord God With the Enemy Lord love to cause build up to come in our life Lord build up and build up and build up to where we're no longer able Lord God to handle the flow to know he no longer able Lord God to be a real useful Channel Lord our usefulness is not that we have to stand in front not that we even have to be noticed but to what you have ordained us for sometimes the Lord maybe you've ordained our life to witness to one person maybe our life has been for that person on the job may be Lord for a spouse maybe for a loved one we don't know because you don't base things upon numbers as though that everybody's got to have so many we're all gifted differently Lord even sitting right here in this assembly there's my brothers and sisters and I thank you for the gifts there are Lord God so many in this assembly that Lord God there's so many people that lives just like such a it's such a natural thing for them just flowing and witnessing the Lord I thank you for that Lord we have oh Lord God I'm so thankful for everyone in the body of Jesus Christ every part every part is so necessary it is just as essential Lord as the next part help us Lord I pray we want to remain useful help us Lord that when we're in the midst of a battle help us that Lord God may we lord Jesus go to that Fountain of Life Lord that place as it were where we can bathe Lord God lack of a purification Lord God where we can Lord God allow the washing of Water by the word Lord to cleanse us the Lord there's sometimes Lord things that we pick up that we do not mean to pick up things that we hear we do not mean to hear Lord and Lord how we need that washing of Water by the word we're thankful God that there is that place of water lord Jesus where there is a running water lord God like you had Moses to place there in the Tabernacle Lord where it would be they could turn that spigot Lord there underneath that Lutron Lord and that water would come out and they could wash their hands they could wash their feet so they could be able to worship Lord we are so thankful tonight Lord that there is a place we can go and Lord as I read how your Prophet will tell us Lord he will speak of many of these things and I can see Lord God that even in his life he is instructing us and speaking to us by experience in his life Lord so much to where there are things that he would even make a statement Lord in the beginning of super sense and said if you don't feel that way that you ought to just stay a little bit longer in prayer until that cleansing and that sweetening till you get the feeling the way you're ought to feel oh God I'm grateful there's a place Lord God that father where we lord God can bathe Lord Jesus to where father that all of those things of life that would like to stick and cling but I'm grateful I'm grateful that there is no Gall in the Dove the dove does not have the ability to digest the world but there is an oil inside of that dove that that Dove can put that oil out and Lord it'll go over her wings his wings it'll go over and what does it do it cleans all the stuff that's got into the feathers help us Lord May Lord the Holy Spirit as we would just yield of ourselves right now yield every thought could you just say Lord God help me right now I want to just make a journey right in to the inward Throne Room Lord oh God that that oil of God would just move forth Lord through my life Lord God as a cleansing Lord to wash away Lord as that oil would move all of the debris out of my feathers all of those rights all of those thoughts all of those feelings God let the oil of God overflow Lord Jesus granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen how many love him I may feel challenged amen well I'm challenged but I'm grateful I'm grateful to the Lord I'm grateful he's mindful of us aren't you man I I'm so I'm so grateful for that amen could we just stand and let's just amen let's just worship him just a few moments now you all been so good been so attentive and I just I know I can just feel the pull and how the Lord is just so minister to our hearts tonight and my goodness I I know one thing for sure I'm going to be different I know I'm going to be better God knows what I have need of aren't you glad yeah I'm talking about I'm glad he knows what I'm aren't you glad he knows what you need I'm glad about that all I have to do is say yes Lord be it unto me I don't want to retain my rights I want his rights go ahead brother Brian lead us in a song please amen [Music] change [Applause] [Music] my way every day with love [Music] let me let me go all the while with the song and the smile oh fill my way every day with love I don't know if you've ever heard this or not but brother Billy Paul was asked you know brother Billy Paul brother Brown's son oldest son he was asked a question what was it in seeing meeting and seeing healing after healing and seeing the things not just on the platform but you know sometimes in the home what was it what was it that was so amazing what was the most amazing thing you'd saw and this is Brother Billy Paul's testimony he said you know he said I saw a lot of things he said but to me what was the most amazing thing is is how I watched brother Branham in how he treated his friends and his enemies he said because he didn't treat them any different he said the way he treated people you'd have never known who his enemy was and who his friend was now I've Got Confidence in this right here I don't believe that God put that out there for us to say guess what you can have no I've Got Confidence that the same Holy Ghost and what it did and what it produced through that life that was a wheat that came to maturity there's more in the field remember whatever has been don't don't look back well oh brother Samuel I'm already struck off the barrel right there no begin fresh right here tonight you can't do nothing about the past the devil would love to trap you in the past but what about right here tonight where the grace of God has come to you and I to recognize that that's a Godly thing it's not godly to mistreat somebody or if they do something wrong to you I'm going to let them know that they did something that's not godly but it's Godly to forgive I think of one philosopher said it this way I know it seen a message uh you know a message preacher I know it's in a quote but it's a good statement here about forgiveness to air is human to forgive is divine I like that statement I like that statement to air is human but to forgive is divine I want to be divine don't you amen now here
