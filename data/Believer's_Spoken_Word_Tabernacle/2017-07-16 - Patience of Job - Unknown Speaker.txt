Hallelujah you stand with me if you would Lord we ask God that you know in the needs of the people Lord that you will guide us Lord to be able to speak to those needs and be a help and encouragement and uplifting to the people I pray in Jesus Christ's name am turn with me in your Bibles to James chapter 5 I want to read from verses 7 to 18 what I'd like to speak on today is the patience of Job be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh Grudge not against one against another that means complain that's what it says in the scoffield complain not one against the other Brethren lest she be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and tender of Mercy but Above All Things my brethren swear not neither by Heaven neither by Earth neither by any other oath but let your yay be yay and your nay nay lest you fall into condemnation is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any marry let him sing Psalms is there any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with the oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you be may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heavens gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit you may be seated job we all know the story of Job And how that in one day such catastrophes fell job he lost all that he had he said job the savans fell and took away all the donkeys in The Oxen and they said the that the calans fell and took away all the camels and when they did they killed all the servants each time a man comes said I alone am am left to come and tell you this news and it said as one would get finished speaking the other would come and it was just one thing right after another you ever been there yes where it seems like it just one thing right after another you get you you get one thing that you maybe you get through that and then there's something else and you and sometimes you look and you say can I get a break yes I'd like to catch my breath yep but we're in a race and you ain't got time to stop and catch your breath brother random said quoting from Hebrews 12 he said lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset you and run this race with patience so we're in a race there's no there's no time to to stop there's no time to fall off to the side we're drawing nearer to the end we've seen times in in the past where maybe someone would fall away from the race for a while and then God would speak to him and bring them back but we're drawing near a time when there isn't no more time left for playing around it's time to get down to business with God Amen there's no more time to to fall to the Wayside I remember when I was in the army we had uh we had a run that we did every Friday and uh our platoon Sergeant called it tour of the town and it it was a tour of the Town believe me we ran 10 miles every Friday and there was individuals and it was always the same individuals that they'd make it down the first Hill and when we left the base they'd fall out and while we were completing the Run they walked back up the hill took a shower and got ready for the next formation but it's it's he that endureth to the end this is time for enduring there's there's no time for fooling around and I thank God that he's been merciful yeah was I myself at one time fell from the race but God was merciful and he's been merciful to many of you here thank God for that Hallelujah but now it's time to run it with patience stay with it stay the course finish the race because we're drawing near to the end here was job he was a a prophet anointed of God the only thing job knew knew to do when all these things beel him was to stay with the word and that's the only thing we can do stay with the word job his neighbors came to him said job you know you done done wrong you know you've secretly sinned that's why all these things look look what's all happened to you you you know you've lost everything you had and now you're sitting on an ash Heap covered with boils scraping the boils off you're miserable Joe you've done something wrong but job said no I have not sinned for I have stayed under the Blood of My Sacrifice amen Satan is there to accuse you and say maybe it's something you've done wrong that's why you're going through this trial or that or this suffering but you're under the blood of your sacrifice amen amen If any man sin we've got an advocate with the father amen we know that as the Bible says if any man say sin not then he's a liar we all are human we're subject to mistakes and being human we got to remember that not only are we human but the person next to us is human also amen that's why the scripture says complain not against one another you know that's something that can C if it catches on in the church it's very de it would be very devastating to your services when you got one complaining against another then what happens is they invite a spirit and that Spirit comes in and it finds fault with with everything that other individual does but what we need to do is take a look in the mirror and realize that as God is longsuffering with us the Bible instructs us we're to be longsuffering with one another realize that one another is human instead of complaining pray for one another amen CU I'll tell you something if I'm the elect of God then you're not going to go without me so if I need prayer you better pray for me amen you can say the same if you're the elect of God then this church Ain't Leaving Without You So they better be praying for you we need to pray one for another amen we need to have love brother maram said there were come a time to where the only real love left would be among the people of God that love needs to be displayed that's not filial love that is AG goo love perfect love the angel of the Lord told Brother Brenham no one would go there without it nothing enters without perfect love we need to have that love for one another the Bible says love would cover a multitude of sin why job said pre Adventure my children have sinned I'll offer a sacrifice for them job did all that he know to do we do all we know to do you see a brother or sister in Fault pray for him ask God to intervene sometimes we get in situations where we may feel like like somebody wronged us well this isn't the I'll get back at them thing and it's not to go around telling somebody else I'll tell you what they've done to me I'll tell you what I'm sick of it say brother you ain't never heard nobody say that I beg your pardon but instead we should be praying one for the other that's where strength in your group lies having that Godly love and praying one for another intervening in each one's behalf job said he had not Sinn because because he was coming God's appointed way under the shed Blood Brother R says this in a message of Fellowship then God's obligated to a man who will stand like that let him go right down to the last person even to his wife come out and said job why don't you curse God and die just think his own wife turned against him and because someone will turn against us and think that we're funny and odd all of God's people are funny and odd to the world sure they are you are peculiar people a royal priesthood offering sacrifices to God the fruits of your lips giving praise to his name when these things after they came and told job all these things that had befell his family and his possessions the Bible says that job Rose and rent his manle and shaved his head and fell down upon the the ground and worshiped that job wasn't going by his feelings he wasn't letting his emotions govern him cuz if he had let his emotions govern him he wouldn't have fell down to worship cuz I we have a love for our children and here every one of his children had passed away in a moment's time you think that didn't stir his emotions sure it did but job didn't act out of his emotions he had acted out of his soul what he knew and he worshiped God in the face of all the things that have befell him this is for an example to us and job said naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord have taken away blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says in all this job sinned not nor charged God foolishly when we have a loved one that is sealed into the body of Christ and when God takes them it doesn't matter how he takes them there is you know people say well maybe to die without suffering well that's comforting to us but death is death and if it would befall one of us that is here this morning that it would be God's will for us to go on before the resurrection then it doesn't matter how that death comes for us we'll leave just the same but we've got that promise of the Resurrection amen I thank God for that amen amen death brother Braham says is just a carriage God hooks up a horse to it and drags you into Glory it's just as this one song says it's just a doorway to that other Shore we don't fear it but when God takes one of ours it's not a time to charge God it's not a time to question God why did you take them why did you take them in the way you took them suicide is a horrible thing and it's something that among all deaths that it's one that we hope that none of our loved ones goes by that way but it's still death some that have suffered from losing their love on that way they say the suffering is harder it's only because of what's in your mind I know from experience I brother randam says in one place he said that a person who was born again filled with the Holy Ghost could get a tormenting devil and he said could cause them to go completely insane he said but that didn't touch their soul he said it could cause them to go completely insane and even take their life but that doesn't touch their soul it's not a death we'd want to see anyone go by but it's still death brother M said God's always faithful when we're coming God's provided way job never charged God foolishly that's where I was we're not to charge God foolishly in a moment I'll get to something where we'll talk about the love of God and how you know God loves you or not as I've had people in the face of of a death of a loved one question well does God love us that isn't how you tell whether God loves you or not I'll get to that in a moment in the message of Fellowship brother R said God's always faithful when we're coming God's provided way job said I've made my confession I have burned the offering that's exactly what God required he worshiped God under the shed blood and all of a sudden then the spirit Came Upon the prophet and the Thunders roared and the Lightnings flashed now he had had what we call job's comforters brother B also called them his neighbors we could call them his Brethren from the church and they came to him and they thought they were coming to help him but instead they were trying to find somewhere some fault something that would tell them why God had done this to job brother bam says that's a mistake every son that cometh to God will be tried and that was what was happening to joob but job says once that you know job waited until impatiently until job didn't have a Bible job knew God by Revelation by Vision he didn't have a Bible to go to like we have and so job waited patiently through all of this he endured it and in the end God came and brought a revelation to job and he said I know that my redeemer liveth Hallelujah and though the skin worms may devour this body yet in my flesh shall I see God and not another but I shall see God we need to wait patiently until God reveals and God will show you many times when you're going through being tried going through a time of suffering you don't know why you're suffering you don't know why this has come on you you don't know why it's befallen you job didn't know that Satan had come before almighty God and and God he didn't know that God had been bragging on [Applause] him so all these things Begin to Fall him because God was bragging on him and Satan said back that up brother R said Satan took a notion I I believe there's times when he's tooken oce in our lives but he said you got a hedge around him said lift that hedge and I'll cause him to curse your name job didn't know all these things that happened he didn't understand that that had been what had happened until later when God revealed it to him when it was all said and done and that's the way it is when we're going through a time of suffering we don't know why that we're suffering but friends it's don't think it's because you've done something wrong if you done something wrong believe me it'll end up coming across the pulpit you don't have to worry about that God has a way of exposing our lives from from the pull pit in such a way we think everybody sitting around us knows exactly that he was talking about us that's just God's way so God's not going to bring some suffering on you when you are under the shed blood doing all you can to live for God he's not going to bring suffering on because you're doing something wrong but he allows suffering to come because it's through suffering that we are made perfect and we must with patience endure it until the end then God will show us why we went through that now there may be things I don't know I've thought there may be things that I won't know the why until we get on the other side pardon me I preached a funeral one time of a six- week old child was just 6 weeks old it had been abused until the abuse killed it and I had to preach his funeral and I said every life to every life there's a purpose and the prophet said that you don't leave here until that purpose has been fulfilled and I said what could have been the purpose of a child just six weeks old well I can tell you this it gave that that man and that woman an opportunity to do right or do wrong and I'll tell you they'll be judged by God for what they did Brother Ram said it doesn't matter if the child is born from the meanest parents in the city he said when babies die they go to heaven had someone challenge me on that one one time and I don't know why they challenged me brother Brown said it you believe brother brown or you don't but they challenged me on it they didn't believe that they said what if that baby's serpent seed I said isn't that something no serpent seed babies ever die well that's the way I'd look at it because brother random said all babies to die go to heaven so that's simple I just believe what he said that's good and that was the Comfort I gave to the grandparents of that young child and I preach it like that even though that the mother of that child who had had been involved in doing these things was sitting right there at the funeral I still preach it that way sometimes that's got me into trouble because I preach what God puts on my heart regardless of who's sitting there I'll say what God tells me to say let the chips fall where they may right theam says and I've heard but now I see he says and now this man being a prophet he had access to God's grace but job didn't have a bible to read the Bible wasn't wrote then he actually access to God was by Revelation and by Vision that was before the Bible was written and now we find out take some of his life when God blessed him and made him a great man while even everybody respected him even to his wisdom had become so great his inspiration from God had Vindicated him to be God's servant so plainly until the people come from everywhere to hear him and then Satan began to accuse that man that's the way he does every inspire servant of God Satan's always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right he's the accuser of the Brethren and he's there to accuse every servant of God so don't don't think your case is uh odd or peculiar you're not the only one facing sometimes we think that the thing we're facing no one else has ever faced it that's not true to to think that we got a priest were thinking very small with a small mind because there's a great big world out there and I'm here to tell testify that God's got children all around the world not just here in this name I tell you what I can't wait until that day when we can fellowship and be able to speak and understand one another now a few of us maybe are bilingual and can understand some now but you don't know every language in the world but you'll build a fellowship with brothers and sisters from all around this world and you won't have to worry about because we'll all be speaking the same language hallelujah hallelujah only reason we speak different languages because somebody got a notion to build a tower one time now we find out his life and trials and his great faith the Bible even says have you not read of the patience of Job Faith Waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled amen Faith Waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled it says in the message of Fellowship said now notice job righteous man godly man everything against him one day Satan took an otion that's what I mentioned to you earlier Satan took a notion to make him deny God and when he did no matter what was going on how much he was persecuted how much he was called that he was on the wrong path job stayed pat on the word I like that he said pre Aventure my children have sin I'll offer a sacrifice for them now the only thing that man knew was the burnt offering that was God's requirement many people think sometimes because disaster happens to a Christian old he got off the will of God they left the church they went out sometimes that's not right because God chastens every son that comes to him he cleanses him purges him and tries him to see if he will stand he tries us to see if we'll stand as I said said on Wednesday night he already knows we're going to he just wants to watch us do it he God was proud of job recall how he said it in the scripture he said have you considered my servant job there is none like him in all the land that was Papa God sticking his chest out there really proud of his [Music] son God's proud of you I look out across this congregation and I see individuals that I've KN seems like my whole life see brother Crest there and his wife known him since I was just a little fella sorry brother Crest I just I just aged you I've known Brother Ray since I was 18 years old I look out and I see brother Bobby I I see all these different ones brother Cruz different ones the mirandas Gomez I've known since I was real young sister Linda God's proud of you you've endured yes Lord there's been many that walked with us that has fell away but you have endured what is that that's the patience of Job when I first announced the title I'm sure you thought my how could I ever measure up to that the patience of Job you have don't feel sad if I didn't call it your name I'm sorry but you've endured brother R says and glorified Jesus said job noted for his endurance holding out in the face of opposition his neighbors coming around saying see you got some sickness now you're you've sinned secretly no I haven't I've confessed all my sin made a burnt offering I've I haven't sinned secretly oh yes you have you've sinned secretly but God was dealing with a saint here here God was dealing with the saint here when you see these times of sufferings tribulations persecutions come on you what is it God is dealing with a saint every son that cometh to God must first be child raised things go contrary and any that cannot bear those things are illegitimate children and not the children of God if a man ever saw him in his heart knowing Jesus raised for his justification accepted the same on the basis of the blood and the word put trials upon him nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus Remember that true this isn't anything that it is not speaking that you've been set separated from God's love those who he called he is Justified and those he's Justified he's already glorified listen to this in the presence of God when you accept Christ as your savior there's a chair set for you at the wedding supper is't that wonderful when you accept him as your savior there's a there waiting on you at the wedding supper I'll tell you what that that make anyone want to shout there's a chair there you know when you go to a wedding and they've got the reception set up and it's kind of formal they'll have a name card on each seat and youve got that means you've got an assigned seat there's a there's a chair with your name name on it Brother David hallu why God placed it there it's reserved for you Hallelujah I love that when I was studying he said amen I like that stick your feet under the table with the wedding supper and eat the supper with the lamb hallelujah hallelujah amen now we couldn't speak on this subject without touching on another individual and that's Abraham Abraham endured long you know come a time when Abraham told lot you we've got to separate you choose lot chose the Lush land he chose the rich land but Abraham was left with the barren land the poor land oh but there was one day as Abraham had endured that there was three men that come to visit him and notice how Abraham Abraham knew they were more than just men true where one was almighty God and the other two were Angels Hallelujah and Abraham went before him and said if I have found favor in thy sight turn in and eat with me let me fix you some bread let me let me kill a lamb let me make something for you to eat sit down in fellowship with me if I found favor with you think about that oh my Mighty God sat down to have fellowship with this one Hallelujah because why he was enduring and he had not yet received the promise had not been fulfilled yet but he was still enduring oh maybe perhaps he went in quickly told Sarah look we got some very special visitors hallah we need to make you need to make up a real good meal for them we're going to eat they're going to stay with us a little while maybe he went out and killed one of the animals to dress the meat for them to eat Sarah went over to the meal barrel and began to make some bread for him and some other things and they sat down to eat and the one almighty God God at his back to the door of the tent and he said where's Sarah say she's in attent behind you he said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you shall have a son hallelujah oh Hallelujah friends we've had an appearing of almighty God in our midst that as a prophet stood with the back to the congregation and called individuals out told them who they were where they were from brother randam then after doing that says is that not the same God that appeared to [Applause] Abraham Hallelujah I want to read Revelations chapter 2 verse 9-1 I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty I Know Thy Works thy tribulation and poverty but thou are rich and I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of these things which Thou shalt suffer uer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches he that overcome shall not be hurt of the second death God didn't tell them they weren't going to die he told him that some of them were going to be offered up but he said for them to endure it he said I know you have tribulations but did he take the tribulations from them no he said I know of your sufferings but did he stop the sufferings no did he prevent their lives from being taken no but he said if they would endure amen be faithful unto death that they wouldn't have to fear the second death what's the second death it's after the resurrection when all are come up before the white Throne judgment to be judged and those that are not found worthy suffer the second death Eternal separation from God I brother B says this in the submer church age in church age book I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wondered if God really loves them how can God be just in and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that's what they asked in Malachi the burden of the word of the Lord to to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayeth the Lord yet we say you say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage to waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought God's love meant no suffering they thought that the love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election amen it's not whether you suffer or don't suffer it's not how good things go for you or how bad things go for you it's not how much possessions you have for you can lose it all it's not worldly Goods that you've been blessed with but it's election that's God's proof of his love to you he has called you he has chose you Hallelujah why because God knew when the choice would be put to you God knew what you would choose and therefore by forn knowledge he could predestinate you he says through Paul quotes this again from melachi Paul does and says Jacob have I loved but Esau have have I hated before either boy was born the Bible says that the election of God might stand sure the proof of his love is election that no matter what happens his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God had chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in US us amen he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered then he quotes Hebrews 58-9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering how's our character going to be perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left a church a measure of suffering listen that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection we can count it glorious in the midst of our suffering we can worship like job did in the midst of our suffering why because we know that as it perfected the character of Jesus so shall it perfect our character this is character perfecting time we live in a world of Sorrow we live in a world of pain of hurt not just God's people it is a world of Sorrow this world has nothing to offer us but it is a time of perfecting our character because friends once the Rapture takes place and we're caught up to the marriage supper of the Lamb there's no more perfecting of character it must be done by then that's true the millennium is not about building your character it's got to already be there that's right because in the Millennium you'll be rulers now is the time why did he did he want this brother Brenham ask then he quotes from James 1 2-4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers Temptations knowing this that the Trine of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and tire and wanting nothing brother Ram said job went down in the harness he was enduring job didn't sit down job was enduring he said Abraham went down in the harness you know what you y'all know what that means went down in the harness they were working they were serving they were busy about God's business they were enduring said Isaac went down in the harness Joseph went down in the harness that's the way we're going to go we're not going to have time for a breather as I said early on I can remember going through some hard trials that I thought were hard at the time when I first went down to Pastor in Dixon and I thought it was so hard I felt like I was going to break and I remember praying and said God I can you let up a little bit give me a chance to catch my breath well that didn't happen and the next one got harder and the next one got harder but the thing about it was is the next one got harder the one in the past looked like well that wasn't so hard after all what happened there was a growth there was a growth there was a building of and perfecting of character that's the way it is with you you can look back see things you've went through that at the time seem devastating some of you face diseases of death and it was devastating but you can where you stand now look back at that and see how God brought you through it and you said that wasn't so bad but then you face something else what's happening that's him perfecting your character he's building it you're growing you're making progress yeah like a one statement I heard down the South said said uh they were under a certain pastorship that turned out later to not even end up believing the message it said they drove down a Stak and 10 years later they were still standing by it meaning they hadn't made any progress but we're making progress that's why that the ones behind us we've growing through that and we look back and we say what I'm going through now is harder than that guess what the next one's going to be harder than that but there's coming a day just like job said I'm know my redeemer liveth hallelujah amen and there's coming a day that I'm going to see God hallelujah and not another for me but I myself Shall Behold Him Joseph went down in the harness remember what Joseph said he said don't bury me here Joseph had a revelation that had been passed down through the family Abraham was was the first in that family to catch the Revelation and Abraham went and asked to buy a certain place lot of land a cave to where he would bury Sarah there when Abraham died Isaac took Abraham and buried him there when Isaac died they took Isaac and buried him there Jacob also told him don't bury me here and they still had the liberty of at that time to take Jacob and go bury him in the same place that Sarah Abraham and Isaac had been buried the prophet said it was the same place job had been buried and they had each got the Revelation that job had Hallelujah I know my redeemer liveth and there is a Beyond this life there is a Resurrection coming and I will be part of that Resurrection Joseph don't bury me down here bear me up here with my fathers bear me the way they were buried the word the plane they was buried in the place they were buried in that's the same thing for me that's the reason I want to be buried in the name of Jesus I want to be buried in the name of Jesus the prophet said for those that are in Christ will God bring with him when he comes hallelujah praise the Lord buried in the name of Jesus I'll tell you something friends it's important what name you're buried under it's important how you're buried whether random said somebody said to me oh it doesn't make a difference he said yeah yes it does it does make a difference buried in the name of Jesus I've shared with you recent trial that my family had went through one of the young girls we' adopted accused my son of some things my son Nathaniel because and this is what she ended up telling the guardian that the court appointed to her and she also told the lawyer the co accorded to her she said I lie because I wanted to wear pants and makeup and cut my hair and they wouldn't let me I want to be like the other kids at school and she told him she lied we went through a trial for that for a whole year the trial in it for me was it was my son and I didn't want his name smeared by some lie and for what a purpose but God has a way and they finally decided in the court they would send my son to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and it's it's called a psychosexual evaluation and there's some pretty uh personal questions and things they ask and he went and endured that and at the end the psychiatrist said there's no way possible he could have done the things he was accused of he said it's not in him I thought if she just said she lied that'd be the end of it but it wasn't God wanted proof and before that happened my wife and I talk what were we going to do with her after this was all said and done that psychiatrist told my son said don't ever get around her again in your life and we had my wife and I we we treated her well even through that year that she lived with we never treated her wrong we never treated her evil we treated her good that Christmas she got gifts just like everybody else even though my son and half my family couldn't be there for that Christmas but I knew the family was never going to be mended as long as she was with us and we thought of different things what we might do put her in the boarding school or do different things we were thinking what how were we going to do this somehow we had to reunite the family and we prayed and ask God for guidance and then she ran away from home was involved in the theft of two cars total out one of the cars and was with three other uh teenagers and they then by this time realized the law was going to be evident so they were on their way to Fleet to to the Carolinas we didn't know what had happened we didn't know I didn't know until about 10:30 that morning the school called me and said your daughter wasn't at school and so we I called my wife we begin to search find out where was she finally realized there was nothing else she had ran away so we reported it that way to the officer that the officer told us by doing that that we wouldn't be liable for anything she did and so anyway the police found her brought her back home it was about 3:00 in the morning when they got her back home and you know she had on makeup and pants and all this and she comes in no it wasn't pants maybe it was pants or shorts something I can't remember now I looked at her and said you got school in the morning go get cleaned up and go to bed the only thing that we said to her about it was now you're going to have to go and appear in court and so when the date come that we had to take her to court the same prosecuting attorney that had been in the case of my son was the same prosecuting attorney that was there for her case and the prosecutor got up and said due to the things that she suffered she thought she should be took into State's custody and evaluated so they took her from us that day and put her in State's custody once she got into state custody she told him she didn't want to come back to us we had to go through this whole thing with children's services and I tell you what I pray for anyone that goes through that if you're ever going through it get word to me somehow I'll be in prayer for you but I sat there and told her from the first day I said well I don't want her back she's in your custody now out I'm fine with that she don't want to be back anyhow if you bring her back she's just going to run away again and I wanted my family reunited and I looked at it and I told my wife I said this is the hand of God we were looking for what was the answer I said but God had the answer in the middle of April this year we went before the judge and signed find away our perennial rights and they put her up for adoption that's what her wishes was that's what she wanted they told us that the family that she had been placed with was already considering adopting her God knew what he was doing we couldn't see it at the start of all we couldn't see how it was going to come out it looked like it would be impossible but God did it in such a way that it cleared my son completely and then she got her wish and then my family was reunited and we were able to have a Christmas together we hadn't been able to have birthdays together Christmases fourth of July's Memorial days Labor Days no holidays it was a blessing to have the family back together again but my point is God knew what he was doing and he knew how to do it I tried to intervene a couple of different times didn't do no good and then I finally said Lord there's nothing I can do if there was I'd do it but God took care of it I don't care what you're going through you may look at it and say I don't see why or the how or what someone told me once when their brother had died from suicide they said what good could come from this the same individual that said that later gave his life to God I don't know what good will come from the things we go through but I know that all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord that are the called if you're the called You're the loved if you're the chosen you're the loved if you're elected you're loved don't try to worry your minds with figuring out how it's going to be what you need to do all you need to do is just stand fast God will take care of it he knows the beginning from the End Amen God bless you brother Brian
