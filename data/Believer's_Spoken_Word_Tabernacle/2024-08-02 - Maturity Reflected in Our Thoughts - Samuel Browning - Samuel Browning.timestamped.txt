[34:48] so appreciated just the ministering of
[34:50] the word that was here just such such
[34:53] quality and of services that the Lord
[34:55] had given us and we certainly want to
[34:57] remember brother neran sister Mina as

[35:01] would just watch over them I that rain I
[35:03] don't know if anybody had to come in

[36:14] myself and two other brothers cancelled

[36:18] country just simply because of of
[36:20] sickness but it's nothing to be alarmed
[36:22] about but it's just something that we
[36:24] realize that here we are we're in the
[36:25] middle of summer and you're you know
[36:28] you're dealing with these things and so
[36:30] um we just want to remember uh brother

[36:37] that and thank you musicians amen and
[36:41] amen so appreciate that and man what a
[36:43] wonderful atmosphere to walk into uh I
[36:46] just you just sense the atmosphere you
[36:48] know that's that's back there and I I
[36:50] mentioned I felt kind of bad I mentioned
[36:52] a few weeks ago I was I was glad you
[36:54] know I welcomed Paul back up here
[36:55] because it had been a month because
[36:58] of just being able to get back and sing
[37:00] and and things like that but I wanted to
[37:02] say in the meantime I so appreciated
[37:05] brother Brian just standing right there
[37:06] just faithful just service after service
[37:09] and when he was counting on Paul leading
[37:10] and Paul had to call him up and say
[37:12] uncle Brian you got to take it tonight
[37:14] you got to take it on Sunday and so I
[37:16] appreciate that and then my goodness
[37:19] wasn't that uh wasn't that special to
[37:21] have uh one of the veterans back in
[37:24] leading songs there the other time I
[37:26] tell you what that was that was a real
[37:28] treat real treat I tell you what uh you
[37:32] know a lot of times I'll say with a lot
[37:34] of the song leaders and I don't mean to
[37:35] keep you standing but uh you know at
[37:37] times I told with Brother Bill and I
[37:39] talked with the S other song leaders I
[37:41] said at times I said I need you to we
[37:43] need to just have some times because
[37:45] some of the song leaders I said they've
[37:47] never experienced the things that you've
[37:49] experienced they brother Bill LED songs
[37:51] without any music and a lot of things
[37:53] when the church was just a beginning and
[37:56] but you know you appreciate that that
[37:58] faithfulness and through it all and and
[38:00] so it just is um we so appreciate that
[38:03] sometimes words is just not enough but
[38:05] we we love you brother Bill amen so
[38:08] appreciate you Amen to me nobody can
[38:11] sing hymns like brother Bill nobody
[38:14] nobody I love the other brothers and
[38:16] song leaders but brother Bill just he
[38:17] he's with that of the hymns and I love
[38:20] when he sings that North silver no gold
[38:22] don't you love
[38:24] that oh I love that song uh let's just
[38:27] look into the word I could talk to you
[38:29] all night but uh let's look here into
[38:31] the word in verse 13 and uh probably
[38:33] praying that I don't preach all night
[38:36] verse 13 of job
[38:38] 23 uh job says but he is in one mind I
[38:42] want you to notice these words we've
[38:44] we've we started out with some of this
[38:46] uh thought within this and I want you to
[38:48] notice what what what job is speaking
[38:51] here he says but he is in one mind and
[38:55] who can turn him and what his soul
[38:58] desireth even that he doeth for he
[39:02] performeth the thing that is appointed
[39:05] for me and many such things are with him
[39:09] therefore am I troubled at his presence
[39:12] when I consider I am afraid of him for
[39:16] God maketh my heart soft and the
[39:19] almighty troubleth me because I was not
[39:23] cut off before the darkness neither hath
[39:26] he covered the darkness from my face
[39:30] amen may God bless you and bless the
[39:31] reading of the word as you're being
[39:34] seated you know we had been looking for
[39:38] a few services on that uh the beginning
[39:41] there of of of of job and dealing with
[39:44] that one with uh fear and knowing that
[39:47] worry and fear are very related um you
[39:50] know brother branam takes us there in
[39:53] the message I have heard but now I see
[39:55] and um that message you know I've quoted
[39:58] from there a lot that's where a lot of
[40:00] it where when I look of through the Book
[40:02] of Job and looking at that through that
[40:05] message um you see that it was it was
[40:08] job not getting an answer from God as to
[40:10] what was going on and that was that was
[40:12] worrying him the prophet said and
[40:15] brother Braham says when you get in that
[40:16] kind of a fix you're in a bad shape
[40:19] because that's just exactly where the
[40:21] enemy wants to get us to push us to
[40:23] where something moves from a concern to
[40:25] a worry but I I look at this in the
[40:28] scripture you and I are privileged in
[40:30] this hour that uh since the coming of
[40:34] the Holy Spirit and then to stand in the
[40:36] hour that we are living in and uh like
[40:39] brother Jerry was referring to that
[40:41] scripture on Sunday and that we are
[40:44] looking through a glass Darkly but then
[40:47] we shall see face to face and we
[40:49] recognize that it's things that God is
[40:51] continuing to open our understanding and
[40:54] I'll say it this way he wants to
[40:56] continue to open our understanding
[40:59] because when as our understanding is
[41:02] opened it it brings us stability within
[41:05] our lives it's things that we can see
[41:08] and to understand doesn't mean that we
[41:10] know all the inner workings but it's to
[41:12] it's to see what God's desire is and
[41:15] God's purpose and to really see
[41:17] ourselves as God sees us and to also see
[41:21] ourselves in the light that in
[41:23] everything we can do nothing without him
[41:27] and so when job is looking at at all of
[41:30] this in the scriptures remember that
[41:34] that Revelation as far as what would
[41:36] become of man after man would die that
[41:39] had not broke forth yet and job uh when
[41:43] he said for the thing which I greatly
[41:45] feared has come upon me job looked at
[41:47] the situation that he was in and
[41:49] remember he said it was like that of a
[41:51] tree that was cut down wherein that I
[41:55] don't see any hope I see no recover y I
[41:57] see nothing coming out of this but yet
[42:00] God in the midst of it all was actually
[42:04] going to bring one of the most glorious
[42:06] Revelations to job's life and a
[42:09] revelation that would be a very glorious
[42:11] Revelation in the middle of the book and
[42:14] at the end of the book and that would be
[42:17] I know my redeemer liveth because when
[42:21] you watch how brother Brandon will take
[42:23] that that in the scripture that's job 19
[42:26] but if you watch watch how brother
[42:27] Brandon will apply that scripture he
[42:30] will tie that scripture in to a final
[42:33] conclusion of when God takes job Clear
[42:36] back before the foundation of the world
[42:39] and so we see it in this way that it's
[42:42] God revealing himself from Genesis to
[42:44] Revelation it's God showing us that as
[42:47] he's come in the volume of the book he's
[42:50] also the same God at the end time he is
[42:54] Our Redeemer revealed and manifest in
[42:57] this end time as a matter of fact that's
[42:59] the real that's the comfort and security
[43:02] of the believer in this hour not this
[43:04] world when you even get your mind on the
[43:07] things that you see and you hear that
[43:09] can be very troubling if that's what
[43:12] you're looking to but oh I'm glad that
[43:14] there's something that's beyond what we
[43:17] see around us I'm grateful that there is
[43:19] a hope that lith within us and that's
[43:23] the hope we give reason for the hope
[43:25] that lies within us this is why I do
[43:27] this this is why the decision I make
[43:29] this is why I forsake this this is why I
[43:32] turn this way is because the coming of
[43:35] the lord The Rapture means more to me
[43:38] than anything
[43:41] else it's it's not when it comes to
[43:43] being weighed in the balance there's
[43:45] nothing that compares to that so when
[43:48] we're looking at this here in the
[43:50] scripture I want to just I want to just
[43:52] take this approach with us tonight I
[43:54] want to build towards something that
[43:56] perhaps we'll get into next week but I
[43:58] want to deal with this part on it and
[44:00] this is maturity being reflected in our
[44:03] thoughts maturity being reflected in our
[44:07] thoughts because many times the things
[44:10] that we we look at throughout life and
[44:12] the way that sometimes that we can even
[44:15] interpret situations interpret things of
[44:18] others or what someone you know says or
[44:21] maybe even how they look or or something
[44:23] and what I mean by look not just how
[44:25] they look in appearance but sometimes
[44:27] actions and things you know we can
[44:29] interpret it in a certain way it's just
[44:30] like Satan could come right here well
[44:33] I'm standing ministering and he would
[44:35] like to tell me so and so this does
[44:37] disagrees this and so and so this say
[44:40] you know why to try to get things off
[44:42] track and this is why that even when
[44:44] brother BR I think he preaches one of
[44:46] the messages on blind bmus he said Satan
[44:48] wore me out in the hotel room telling me
[44:52] that the people aren't going to get this
[44:54] thought tonight so sometimes our
[44:57] perceptions are are are are a lot of
[45:00] times can be based upon previous things
[45:03] that we've encountered or seen or
[45:06] experienced and this is why that even
[45:09] after the New Birth has come this is why
[45:11] that the word comes to first of all give
[45:14] us a Dominion that we might be able to
[45:18] release and submit our lives that the
[45:21] word might wash us this is why there
[45:24] must be a renewing of our mind and this
[45:27] is where God comes to change even our
[45:30] perceptions on things to where that we
[45:33] can see it the way God sees it and this
[45:36] is where we need the help of almighty
[45:39] God and so we want to take the word
[45:41] that's what I want to take I believe
[45:43] that's what you want to take I I want to
[45:45] take just like what I think brother
[45:47] Jerry preached on that first service
[45:49] when you take a thinking man's filter
[45:51] and you apply it across the board it
[45:54] doesn't stop with just the change of our
[45:57] nature that thinking man's filter is the
[46:00] word and we filter everything through
[46:04] the word of God if it can't make it
[46:06] through the word of God I don't want it
[46:09] that includes my attitudes that includes
[46:12] my thoughts that includes anything I
[46:15] want to filter it through the word
[46:16] because whatever is filtered through the
[46:19] word the end result the only thing that
[46:22] can pass through the word is the spirit
[46:24] of God because that is the word and
[46:27] that's what this is this is why that
[46:28] when that that is presented to you and I
[46:31] it's the benefit for our lives as a
[46:33] Believer to realize the source that we
[46:36] have of the m and the maturing that it
[46:39] would become reflected in our thoughts
[46:41] as it passes through the word now I want
[46:43] you to think of this here out of three
[46:45] kinds of Believers I've referred to this
[46:48] quote many times but it's it's a very
[46:50] much a key what brother Bram says
[46:53] concerning job as long as Satan can make
[46:57] him believe that his sickness was his
[47:00] God doing it he had job whipped now let
[47:04] me just just put this in context even
[47:07] though he is believing that it's God
[47:10] doing it Satan is handing this to him
[47:13] but it doesn't change one fact that he's
[47:16] still a Son of
[47:17] God it doesn't change one thing that he
[47:21] still has a revelation from God that he
[47:24] knows where he's standing see you know
[47:27] what that tells me that you or I there's
[47:29] times where we can be wrong in our
[47:34] thinking and it shows that even though
[47:36] we've got a revelation that is
[47:38] prevailing in our heart but if we allow
[47:42] thoughts to come into our mind and take
[47:45] those thoughts it can actually stifle
[47:48] the Revelation from moving and
[47:50] prevailing in our lives this is why that
[47:52] when we have all of we see that with
[47:54] Revelation there's nothing it's trueth
[47:56] as the prophet said as great and
[47:59] prevailing as Revelation that's absolute
[48:01] truth Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll
[48:04] build my church but this is why that
[48:07] even within that we need to let the word
[48:10] oh God let the word have the right away
[48:13] in my life Lord I want the word to have
[48:15] the right away I don't want to I don't
[48:17] want to compare it with other things I
[48:19] want the word to have the right away
[48:21] notice he said as long as Satan can make
[48:23] him believe that his sickness was his
[48:25] God doing it he had job whipped it
[48:28] wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing
[48:31] it and he said the same thing today
[48:33] he'll try to tell you these trials and
[48:37] things is your God trying to put
[48:39] punishment upon you it isn't no sir it's
[48:42] Satan doing it God permitting it that's
[48:46] key it's Satan doing it but God
[48:48] permitting it and listen he's not the
[48:51] author of confusion God is the god of
[48:54] purpose notice and why is he doing it to
[48:57] temper you to temper you to make you see
[49:00] if you are tied to this earth notice
[49:03] it's not to make God see it's not even
[49:05] to make the devil see it's for you and I
[49:08] to see that what really matters in my
[49:10] life is coming out under a test or under
[49:13] a trial yeah that's what's really coming
[49:16] out that's what the test is comes to do
[49:19] it comes to mold you and I to shape you
[49:22] and I as we surrender but it comes to
[49:24] let you know there's something great
[49:26] Gater than you there's something greater
[49:29] than your resiliency it's the purpose of
[49:32] God in your heart and in your
[49:36] life oh my it's to temper you now those
[49:39] of you that work and have worked at the
[49:41] steel mill or other places you know what
[49:43] tempering is tempering itself is so that
[49:46] that metal can be used in a later time
[49:51] and the way it's done is is they heat it
[49:53] up to the point right Where It's At The
[49:57] Fringe of melting yeah and then they'll
[50:00] cool it down oh yeah they keep doing
[50:03] that because what that does is it it
[50:05] allows that then to become a usable
[50:09] source that steel that metal that iron
[50:12] it allows it to become usable and this
[50:15] is how that God molds and shapes us
[50:18] he'll take us to the very degree before
[50:21] melting before we would melt and then
[50:24] God comes right around and lets us just
[50:27] cool right off and have what's he doing
[50:29] it's hardening and making us and
[50:32] building an elasticity something to
[50:34] where we're able to be molded and shaped
[50:37] for his
[50:39] purpose absolutely I don't know about
[50:41] you but I probably would say Lord just
[50:44] less than mine
[50:47] 20° because listen your flesh and my
[50:50] flesh it it doesn't it doesn't see this
[50:53] and it doesn't matter like even what's
[50:54] being preached tonight you know who's
[50:56] really rejoicing in in us not your flesh
[50:58] not my flesh it's that inner man on the
[51:00] inside that's
[51:02] rejoicing because it's that inner man
[51:05] that's a part of the word of God you see
[51:07] friends that's why even the coming of
[51:09] the Holy Ghost the coming of the Holy
[51:11] Spirit yeah I can anoint our flesh yes
[51:13] it can anoint our spirit but it didn't
[51:15] come to anoint our flesh and spirit it
[51:17] came to Quicken that seed on the inside
[51:21] and bring forth a real new
[51:23] birth that's what it came to do
[51:25] Hallelujah
[51:28] yes sir so to temper us and I want to go
[51:32] right into Romans chapter 5 and notice
[51:35] how Paul would would refer to this in
[51:37] Romans 5 and he would
[51:39] say that being justified by faith we
[51:42] have peace with God through our Lord
[51:45] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[51:48] by faith into this grace wherein we
[51:51] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[51:55] of God this is our expect ation the
[51:57] glory of God from Glory unto Glory until
[52:02] the very change is that right and not
[52:05] only so but we glory in tribulations
[52:10] also I know we can look at that
[52:12] scripture that doesn't mean in verse
[52:15] three and I hope you understand I'm just
[52:16] going to use an illustration that
[52:18] doesn't mean that necessarily we're
[52:19] running around the church or or you know
[52:22] we're we're you know doing cartwheels
[52:24] but what it means is that the glory in
[52:26] tribulation is where we remain
[52:29] worshiping the
[52:32] Lord in the midst of it all I don't
[52:35] understand it even in your mind or in
[52:37] your spirit there might be a weariness
[52:40] but we're presenting ourselves before
[52:43] him that's a maturing being reflected in
[52:46] our thoughts in other words God's not
[52:48] against me he's for me amen he sought me
[52:52] out Hallelujah I didn't find the message
[52:54] the message found me right
[52:57] I didn't reveal myself to to the Lord
[52:59] Jesus he came and sought me out he
[53:02] revealed himself to me I didn't clean my
[53:05] life up he came and cleaned me
[53:09] up I didn't take away the desires in my
[53:12] life he came he took those desires
[53:16] away and this is why that this is where
[53:19] that you and I are able to come to and
[53:21] glory and tribulations in that we're
[53:24] worshiping we're worshiping and
[53:26] worshiping doesn't altogether mean it
[53:28] has has all that everything is always
[53:30] out here but there's a worship to know
[53:32] that in the midst of it I don't know
[53:34] what's taking place I don't know what
[53:36] but I know one thing that God is at
[53:38] work that's it and let me just say this
[53:41] to you that even when things come our
[53:43] way the natural tendency for a Believer
[53:46] is for us to look and say is there
[53:48] something wrong am I somewhere off the
[53:51] path have I wondered and let me just say
[53:53] this as you begin to look in that way
[53:55] and your heart is open for that if there
[53:58] is some place that we're off the way
[54:01] he's faithful to lead us back on the
[54:04] wayen is that right when you ask for a
[54:07] for a piece of bread he don't give you a
[54:09] stone so God doesn't hold from you
[54:12] whatever it is that if you and I need to
[54:14] make restitutions he doesn't keep it
[54:16] from us remember he is the one that
[54:20] desired the relationship and fellowship
[54:23] with you and I the Bible said when we
[54:26] were
[54:27] unlovable yet sinners Christ died for us
[54:32] in this was the love of God manifested
[54:35] to
[54:36] us so this is how we're living based on
[54:40] what he has done for us and in
[54:43] US knowing that tribulation
[54:47] worketh
[54:49] patience it worketh patience yes it and
[54:52] patience this is dealing with endur
[54:54] endurance this is that temper ing it it
[54:57] it just it's a tempering there's things
[54:59] that God knows what you and I are able
[55:02] to handle right now if he terries he
[55:06] knows what we would be able to handle if
[55:09] he terries a month from now a year from
[55:12] now he's he's molding and he's shaping
[55:15] and he's preparing he's working on our
[55:18] life because when this is all said and
[55:19] done the very thing we take with us is
[55:22] our
[55:23] character that that's what goes in the
[55:25] Rapture is is the character notice and
[55:28] patience experience and experience hope
[55:31] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[55:34] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[55:38] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[55:41] so God's love the love of God that is
[55:44] the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the
[55:47] word of God this is the love of God and
[55:50] that is shed abroad in our hearts God's
[55:53] own life his love this is where you and
[55:56] I that our expectation we're not ashamed
[55:59] that I know and I'm resting in whom I
[56:03] and know in whom I have believed I
[56:05] believe he's able to keep me he's able
[56:09] Jude said to keep me from
[56:12] falling is that right right so this this
[56:16] element here where job himself job has
[56:19] the prophet would describe it like this
[56:21] and you know I've read i' I've pulled
[56:23] out many scriptures here over the over
[56:25] the times we've looked at this portion
[56:27] of it to show you that even where job's
[56:30] thinking in this that throughout he he
[56:34] completely believes that it's God doing
[56:37] it but you see God doesn't bother to
[56:40] step in God's Not you know biting his
[56:42] fingernails and worried about it oh my
[56:44] goodness I got to make sure all this is
[56:46] straightened out God doesn't you know
[56:48] what you know what God what God had
[56:49] confidence in God had confidence in the
[56:52] fellowship that he had with job
[56:57] he knew job that is so good he knew him
[56:59] he knew him before he ever set foot as
[57:02] far as in a physical body upon this
[57:04] earth that is why that God took him
[57:07] where were you before the foundation of
[57:10] the
[57:10] [Music]
[57:12] world this is where God when he begins
[57:15] to speak and deal with this but as as we
[57:17] look at this and seeing these portions
[57:20] in the word job had a grip on God by
[57:23] divine revelation praise to I love that
[57:26] I love how the prophet says that in that
[57:28] way you know it it it brings it down
[57:31] when as we're looking at it because
[57:34] sometimes we uh you know we can look at
[57:37] things as though that everything that we
[57:39] do or say and everything within
[57:41] ourselves that we have to be perfect
[57:43] it's not our Perfection our Perfection
[57:46] is in him and him
[57:48] alone that's what job was standing on
[57:51] the entire
[57:53] time now watch this in re Romans 8 I'm I
[57:56] know these are familiar scriptures but
[57:57] I'm just trying to lay something cuz I'm
[57:59] going somewhere in verse 35 Paul said
[58:02] who shall separate us from the love of
[58:05] Christ now notice Paul could have said
[58:08] what but he didn't he said
[58:10] who who shall tribulation shall distress
[58:16] persecution famine nakedness Pearl or
[58:20] sword as it's written for thy sake we
[58:25] are killed all all the day long we are
[58:27] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[58:31] in all these things we are more than
[58:34] conquerors through him that loved us I
[58:38] want to read this out of the Amplified
[58:40] it's the same meaning it just saves me
[58:41] from posting the meaning yet amid all
[58:44] these things we are more than conquerors
[58:46] and this is what that phrase means gain
[58:50] a surpassing victory through him who
[58:53] loved us what do you mean more than
[58:56] coners a gaining of surpassing Victory a
[58:59] surpassing victory means an exceeding a
[59:02] greater than well what what is it what
[59:05] what can be greater than it's where
[59:07] God's own life is having the right away
[59:11] and prevailing above
[59:13] self it's
[59:16] surpassing this is why that we we to
[59:19] move from Victory unto Victory this is
[59:22] why that the real Victory is the victory
[59:25] over our greatest enemy which is
[59:28] ourself sometimes we when we come into
[59:31] the test or the trial or our perception
[59:33] on something we're looking out here but
[59:36] remember Faith itself is made to be a
[59:40] master of every circumstance it's not so
[59:43] much us trying to control this out here
[59:46] it begins with faith controlling this
[59:49] guy right here Faith down in the engine
[59:53] room that controls and takes control of
[59:56] our thoughts that is so good it takes
[59:59] control because listen when you and I
[1:00:02] are in control as far as where faith has
[1:00:05] the rideway then in that situation
[1:00:08] that's supreme power in
[1:00:10] control that's Sue it doesn't matter
[1:00:13] what all that's going on around here you
[1:00:15] and I have come under the control of the
[1:00:17] holy spirit this is why Satan's battle
[1:00:21] over and over is to draw us out into
[1:00:25] those other realms
[1:00:34] Paul said for I am persuaded that
[1:00:37] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:00:40] principalities nor powers nor things to
[1:00:42] come nor nor things present nor things
[1:00:45] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:00:47] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:00:50] us from the love of God which is in
[1:00:53] Christ Jesus our lord amen so that no
[1:00:56] matter no Paul said no matter what would
[1:00:59] come now you know within all of that the
[1:01:02] Bible tells us of how the seed is swn in
[1:01:05] four different types of ground remember
[1:01:08] the seed is the word the word is the
[1:01:11] same but what is the difference is the
[1:01:13] ground that it's swn in is that right
[1:01:17] and that ground we're talking about is
[1:01:19] what is there that's able to hold to
[1:01:23] house the word of God true that's that's
[1:01:27] what it is it's where the word coming to
[1:01:29] that rightful place and then what the
[1:01:32] scripture calls it good ground the
[1:01:34] prophet called that
[1:01:36] preprepared ground God has he Jehovah
[1:01:40] Gyra he has provided that ground for
[1:01:43] himself to come in and for it to Blossom
[1:01:46] in our lives so when we see this this is
[1:01:50] where that even this is in one Avenue of
[1:01:52] our thinking that how that you know um
[1:01:55] when we're looking at it brother Brandon
[1:01:57] would take this and in this hour and he
[1:01:59] would say that how that God was not
[1:02:02] rebuking job he was only purging him and
[1:02:05] he said you know a lot of times the
[1:02:07] trouble of it is we think sometimes
[1:02:10] God's angry with us but he's only trying
[1:02:13] to purge us sir now let me just say this
[1:02:16] to you I want to say this very clearly I
[1:02:19] think it's a blessing for us to come to
[1:02:22] a place where we can we will examine and
[1:02:26] allowing Our Lives to be
[1:02:28] examined we're living in a time in an
[1:02:30] age where there's things that I I tell
[1:02:33] you I I just you just see it where where
[1:02:36] self-reflection is not really
[1:02:38] present that's right it's it's just it's
[1:02:41] always looking and everything else is
[1:02:43] around and and like I said if we compare
[1:02:45] ourselves our own life to ladyo and
[1:02:49] Christianity we can look pretty good but
[1:02:52] that's not what we're to compare
[1:02:53] ourselves to we're not even compare
[1:02:56] ourselves to uh you know the next person
[1:02:59] we are to compare ourselves with the
[1:03:01] word of
[1:03:02] God this is what this is where we're at
[1:03:05] this is the seriousness of the hour this
[1:03:08] is what leads us to surpassing victory
[1:03:11] in our lives yes Lord is that part of it
[1:03:14] that takes some of the greatest courage
[1:03:16] is to be able to look face to face in
[1:03:18] the word and say Lord I'm wrong the word
[1:03:21] is right and know that there's Grace at
[1:03:24] that moment given to Our Lives to
[1:03:29] rise thinking our thinking sometimes and
[1:03:31] this is why that our thinking sometimes
[1:03:34] it can affect our yielding it can just
[1:03:37] cause where our yielding we get down and
[1:03:40] and we'll just in our thoughts but I
[1:03:42] believe that's where the spirit of God
[1:03:44] is is wanting and trying to bring a m
[1:03:47] through the maturity in our life that it
[1:03:49] would be reflected in our thoughts in
[1:03:53] other words we're not going the same
[1:03:56] Pathways we're not traveling the same
[1:03:58] Avenues we've always
[1:04:01] traveled but God is giving us a a Grace
[1:04:04] and this hour through the washing of
[1:04:06] Water by the word there's a maturing
[1:04:09] that's to be going on in our lives this
[1:04:12] is why the scripture says in 1
[1:04:14] Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I
[1:04:17] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:04:20] I thought as a child but when I became a
[1:04:24] man I put put away childish
[1:04:27] things let me tell you something if it
[1:04:29] was not for the grace of God working in
[1:04:33] our lives let me just say this you and I
[1:04:35] would remain as
[1:04:39] children if not if a father doesn't
[1:04:42] initiate and begin to work on those
[1:04:45] things for for for young men coming into
[1:04:48] manhood and even you know a mother
[1:04:50] working with a young lady if those
[1:04:52] things are not initiated it things just
[1:04:54] continue to go and you know we we can't
[1:04:57] things are not on autopilot right this
[1:05:00] is why there's got to be an initiation
[1:05:02] this is why I'm just going to speak
[1:05:04] maybe this is more like a family part of
[1:05:06] it but it's very true I find that for
[1:05:08] even in myself right now there's more
[1:05:11] time that even as they've gotten older
[1:05:13] there's even more time more investing
[1:05:16] right now I'm not saying that
[1:05:18] begrudgingly I'm just saying that I
[1:05:20] realized there's more time that's
[1:05:22] invested right now brother Samuel
[1:05:24] they're 18 or they're 15 or they're 21
[1:05:27] that doesn't mean the hands come off
[1:05:29] it's a time that's still there to guide
[1:05:31] us think about God working in our life
[1:05:35] think about it God has never taken his
[1:05:37] hands off of our life he's not put his
[1:05:41] church on autopilot he said I will be
[1:05:44] there I'll be with you even in you to
[1:05:47] the end of the age I'll lead and guide
[1:05:49] you into all
[1:05:51] things sure the relationship as it
[1:05:54] changes and God is stepping to bring
[1:05:57] decisions our way that he won't make for
[1:05:59] us is that right it begin like when they
[1:06:02] called Rebecca asked the damsel inquired
[1:06:05] her mouth just like the the young man
[1:06:07] who was healed his eyes was healed his
[1:06:10] parents said ask him he's of age God
[1:06:13] brings us when the prophet was going to
[1:06:15] go and go off in the mountains uh
[1:06:17] because of the complex God didn't tell
[1:06:19] him you're not doing that God just told
[1:06:21] him said that's what you want to do okay
[1:06:23] so that's what you want to do let me
[1:06:25] just show you this is how it's going to
[1:06:26] be your wife's going to leave you and
[1:06:28] this but it's your
[1:06:29] decision whatever you choose you know
[1:06:32] what that's showing that's showing a
[1:06:34] place where the word is bringing us to a
[1:06:36] place of maturity you say how do I know
[1:06:39] I'm coming to that place of maturity
[1:06:41] there's decisions that's put before you
[1:06:43] and
[1:06:44] I and that's why Satan battles in the
[1:06:48] mind because in the mind is where
[1:06:50] decisions are
[1:06:53] made amen I thought as a child but see
[1:06:57] God comes to initiate and comes to bring
[1:07:00] us up to that we would grow in his grace
[1:07:04] in in the in the saman church age I
[1:07:06] think I have that scripture there
[1:07:08] Brianna H when we look at in the in the
[1:07:10] saman age where it refers to I think
[1:07:12] it's Revelations 29 or 19 where God
[1:07:16] stands there remember in the midst of
[1:07:18] the seven uh golden candlesticks and he
[1:07:20] says to this age I Know Thy poverty but
[1:07:23] thou are rich I know
[1:07:26] I know I'm
[1:07:29] aware brother Jerry quoted that quote
[1:07:31] and I I love that quote so much where
[1:07:34] it's as as it mentions of where that so
[1:07:38] much of of the way that it's presented
[1:07:41] as though that God himself came and
[1:07:43] saved you and I and then he took then he
[1:07:46] became
[1:07:47] disinterested in
[1:07:49] humanity it's not true God is even now
[1:07:52] the prophet said even now governing in
[1:07:54] the affair
[1:07:56] of men he is both the Creator and
[1:08:00] sustainer this is why he's walking in
[1:08:03] the midst of the seven golden
[1:08:05] Candlestick he is our life
[1:08:08] Source he is our life he is our all and
[1:08:12] all and here he is walking in the midst
[1:08:15] of it and he says I
[1:08:17] know that's good and the prophet says it
[1:08:20] like this he says there it is again he's
[1:08:24] walking up and down in the midst of his
[1:08:26] church like a father he is looking down
[1:08:30] upon his
[1:08:32] family he is the head of his
[1:08:36] household he is the provider he is the
[1:08:39] protector yet he looks on at their at
[1:08:42] their poverty I want you to think of
[1:08:45] this watch these words oh how the
[1:08:49] untutored believer stumbles at
[1:08:52] this how can God bear to to look upon
[1:08:56] his own in a time of need and not just
[1:08:59] stop at all not just give in and lavish
[1:09:02] everything material upon
[1:09:05] them remember brother Bram says if you
[1:09:08] do that with your children the end
[1:09:11] result brother Brown would say the end
[1:09:13] result is you know when they get married
[1:09:15] they'll make hell on
[1:09:17] Earth because they're used to getting
[1:09:19] their way they've been trained in that
[1:09:21] way they've been taught that way but you
[1:09:24] see father hood is where God is a father
[1:09:28] and there's times to where God is
[1:09:29] looking at our lives and he doesn't come
[1:09:32] right down and say uh Richie do this do
[1:09:34] this don't do this do that but he can
[1:09:36] look and he knows within your life in my
[1:09:39] life he knows my weaknesses he knows
[1:09:41] your weaknesses he knows the areas that
[1:09:43] we need to be strengthened and you know
[1:09:45] what he'll do he is there interceding on
[1:09:49] our behalf the whole time it's not that
[1:09:52] he's giving in to Lavish us but he wants
[1:09:55] to see his word come to fruition in our
[1:09:58] life and the only way that can happen is
[1:10:01] when we yield and
[1:10:04] surrender absolutely that's the only way
[1:10:08] and so as a father he'll pray it's like
[1:10:11] for myself let me just bring it down the
[1:10:13] natural there's things that I can see I
[1:10:14] can see not only when I look at the
[1:10:16] strengths and I can see strength but
[1:10:18] when I know the weaknesses and where
[1:10:20] each of them are at those are the things
[1:10:23] that we're not setting down to have
[1:10:25] hammer out those weaknesses those are
[1:10:27] where I stand as a priest and pray God
[1:10:32] strengthen Paul in this area Lord Lord
[1:10:34] help Benjamin in this area Lord Lord
[1:10:37] work with Zachary Lord give him strength
[1:10:39] in this area why God knows what you and
[1:10:42] I have need of and if that is something
[1:10:45] that would move and where we stand as an
[1:10:47] Earthly parent how much greater is our
[1:10:49] Heavenly
[1:10:51] parent he knows what you and I have need
[1:10:53] of and yet he doesn't just
[1:10:56] move right in and just hand it to
[1:10:58] us right he guides us he brings us to a
[1:11:02] place of submission Hey listen there's
[1:11:05] things right now you and I can truly say
[1:11:07] when we look at it in the word of God
[1:11:09] and how things that God deals with our
[1:11:11] life there's ways I'll tell you there's
[1:11:12] things right now here tonight that I see
[1:11:14] much differently than what I seen in the
[1:11:17] past oh yes there's much things even
[1:11:20] right now of my Approach on some things
[1:11:22] it's much different than even in my
[1:11:24] thoughts and other things from the
[1:11:25] past I don't think I'm the only one but
[1:11:28] if I am so be it but I I will say it in
[1:11:31] this way right here it's God working on
[1:11:33] our lives even when we and I can't allog
[1:11:36] together see it what if God just set us
[1:11:38] down and hammered on us on our
[1:11:41] weaknesses we would you know what that's
[1:11:44] why Paul said fathers do not make your
[1:11:47] children angry lest they be
[1:11:51] discouraged is that right see God knows
[1:11:54] and this is where where brother BR says
[1:11:56] here is where you have to believe again
[1:11:58] in the love and goodness and wisdom of
[1:12:00] God this is needful I say Lord help us
[1:12:04] Lord help us Lord Jesus amen I I want to
[1:12:08] be I want to that's how I want to be I
[1:12:10] want to trust in that I want to look to
[1:12:12] him when it comes down with family with
[1:12:15] the church with all those things looking
[1:12:16] to him God knows what he's
[1:12:19] doing he knows what he's doing this is
[1:12:22] why when Paul would would would speak of
[1:12:24] of of the ministering spirits that are
[1:12:27] sent forth to minister to The Heirs of
[1:12:30] Salvation this is why that as we come
[1:12:32] together and we gather like this listen
[1:12:35] friends I believe it's important to get
[1:12:37] into the message of the hour I I believe
[1:12:39] I believe you ought to be getting into
[1:12:41] the message of the hour listening to the
[1:12:43] tapes listening to the message and and
[1:12:45] just just you know don't try to figure
[1:12:47] everything out just just get into it and
[1:12:49] say Lord just reveal yourself to me Lord
[1:12:53] I I I want to I want to fall deeper in
[1:12:56] Love with You Lord getting in I believe
[1:12:58] in Reading getting into the word of God
[1:13:01] I believe in praying and not not to
[1:13:03] where that we become like spiritual
[1:13:05] monks but to where that it's a
[1:13:07] relationship we're not robots right are
[1:13:10] you hearing me well we're not robots
[1:13:13] within this but this is why that we come
[1:13:15] together for the live ministering of the
[1:13:18] word because you know there's one thing
[1:13:20] with the live ministering of the word is
[1:13:23] you can't push stop and you can't push
[1:13:26] pause and you can't push
[1:13:28] play God's going to roll right down the
[1:13:31] Avenues that we need
[1:13:34] strengthen that's where God's going to
[1:13:36] come and he's going to speak to our
[1:13:38] lives and our hearts is that right now I
[1:13:41] believe in being in tune with that that
[1:13:43] we can be listening to the word I
[1:13:45] believe that we can receive correction
[1:13:47] and direction from that but this is why
[1:13:50] when God sent the ministerial offices in
[1:13:52] the church the Bible said that he had
[1:13:55] given in verse 11 some Apostles some
[1:13:57] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[1:13:59] and teachers for what reason the
[1:14:01] perfecting of the
[1:14:03] Saints now this Perfection this is not
[1:14:06] the Perfection that that that comes
[1:14:08] because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:10] this is the Perfection that deals with
[1:14:13] afterwards the complete Furnishing and
[1:14:17] making up in our lives right it's God
[1:14:20] working with us from start to finish
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:26] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:14:28] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[1:14:31] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:14:34] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[1:14:38] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:14:40] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:14:42] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:14:46] to and fro carried about with every wind
[1:14:48] of Doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:14:50] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:14:53] waight to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:14:56] and love may grow up into him in all
[1:14:59] things which is the head even Christ
[1:15:02] hallah see God a God that comes through
[1:15:05] his word it's a promoting of maturity
[1:15:10] that's but what matters and the effect
[1:15:13] of that is how that we and whether we
[1:15:17] will receive it or not that's so good
[1:15:20] because that word's going to it comes to
[1:15:22] stir us up that's so good
[1:15:25] yeah let me just say this right here
[1:15:27] your character is not molded in here no
[1:15:31] this is the preaching of the word this
[1:15:33] is the area where the of the kitchen
[1:15:35] this is where the food is being served
[1:15:37] this is the place where the word's
[1:15:39] coming coming coming forth but the word
[1:15:41] is there to exort you and I it's there
[1:15:45] to edify it's there to remind you and I
[1:15:47] who we are and it's there to point out
[1:15:50] as the prophet said our shortcomings our
[1:15:53] weak places and to to bring us in
[1:15:56] remembrance of this is who you are a son
[1:15:59] and daughter of
[1:16:00] God this is why that no matter what
[1:16:03] situation we we we are so thankful for
[1:16:06] that Revelation breaking forth that now
[1:16:09] are we the sons of God but that also
[1:16:11] holds true when we're offended we're
[1:16:14] still Sons and Daughters of
[1:16:16] God when s things happen that don't go
[1:16:19] our way we're still Sons and Daughters
[1:16:21] of God we don't want to fall
[1:16:23] back you want to come back into previous
[1:16:26] Trails no amen one God Lord help me that
[1:16:30] there's a maturing in my thinking that
[1:16:33] that maturing in our thinking does not
[1:16:35] mean that the thoughts won't cross your
[1:16:38] path but it's just you being able as a
[1:16:41] Son of God Discerning those things as
[1:16:44] they come that it's not going to stay in
[1:16:46] this ground yeah that's good sir that's
[1:16:49] what it comes down to it sure does so
[1:16:52] this is where we want the word we want
[1:16:54] the word to have preeminence don't we
[1:16:56] yes we want it to have first place in
[1:16:58] our lives this is why the prophet when
[1:17:00] he was said you got to get everything
[1:17:02] else out and he said in in paragraph 87
[1:17:06] of greatest B fought I want you to watch
[1:17:07] how he says this here he says he says he
[1:17:11] here he says if it's covered over and
[1:17:13] you say well these conscience and senses
[1:17:15] and so forth that don't have anything to
[1:17:17] do with it brother Bram certainly it
[1:17:19] does but if you let the word come in and
[1:17:22] cover it over with conscience then it
[1:17:25] can't grow it'll be a deformed
[1:17:28] word so receiving the word in but don't
[1:17:33] compare the word to your conscience in
[1:17:36] other words conscience can be previous
[1:17:38] teaching previous
[1:17:40] beliefs are you hearing me even the
[1:17:43] reasonings about things well but it
[1:17:45] comes down to we want the word to have
[1:17:48] preeminence and we're not comparing it
[1:17:50] with our conscience the word is our
[1:17:53] absolute
[1:17:55] amen that's where that's where every let
[1:17:58] all let every other word every other
[1:18:00] word Every Man's word be alive let God's
[1:18:02] word be truth we don't want to cover it
[1:18:05] over so now it becomes that
[1:18:08] responsibility when we look at it
[1:18:10] brother B says if we don't if he covers
[1:18:12] it over he said like that blade of corn
[1:18:14] it'll grow
[1:18:16] crooked because something is hindering
[1:18:18] it and he says you know he goes on in
[1:18:21] paragraph 89 he says that's what's a
[1:18:22] matter with a Pentecostal faith today
[1:18:25] we've let too many things hinder it the
[1:18:27] faith we've been taught the Holy Spirit
[1:18:29] that's been living in us we've let too
[1:18:31] many things looking at somebody else and
[1:18:35] the devil is always trying to point you
[1:18:38] to somebody's failure but he tries to
[1:18:41] keep you away from the real testimony
[1:18:44] that's genuine there's a lot that could
[1:18:47] be said and said there Satan is the
[1:18:49] author of smoking
[1:18:52] mirrors he's the author of dogging Pony
[1:18:55] shows he's the author to get our
[1:18:57] attention off where it needs to be it
[1:19:01] caus our attention to be put up on like
[1:19:03] the prophet said somebody else's
[1:19:04] failures he calls our attention listen
[1:19:07] Satan doesn't even mind to divert the
[1:19:10] people's attention to where they elevate
[1:19:13] a man to oh this got to be this man and
[1:19:17] oh we got to hear this man why it's
[1:19:19] still taking the attention off of the
[1:19:21] real thing and that attention is the
[1:19:24] real testimony God wants to bring forth
[1:19:27] in our
[1:19:28] life God doesn't want us rling around a
[1:19:31] man he wants us to Rally around the true
[1:19:34] gift of the Holy Ghost amen that's what
[1:19:38] God has revealed in this
[1:19:41] hour oh my aren't you thankful to the
[1:19:44] Lord this is why the prophet goes on to
[1:19:46] say in in paragraph 91 of that message I
[1:19:49] love that message greatest battor fought
[1:19:52] I love that message it not only deals
[1:19:53] with that getting down in the soul the
[1:19:55] conversion but it deals with everyday
[1:19:59] life it deals with how that we stand
[1:20:02] victorious in our lives brother BR said
[1:20:05] it must be accepted in the mind then
[1:20:07] it's believed with the heart then the
[1:20:09] word of God becomes a reality then every
[1:20:12] sense of soul and body is scoured out
[1:20:15] with the Holy Spirit then your sense of
[1:20:17] God your conscience of God everything
[1:20:20] that's Godly flows through you there's
[1:20:22] not a doubt anywhere there's nothing
[1:20:25] can rise
[1:20:26] up and what he's what he's letting us
[1:20:28] know here where there's nothing that can
[1:20:30] rise up that once that New Birth has
[1:20:34] come into your life by the baptism of
[1:20:37] the Holy Spirit there is nothing that
[1:20:40] can rise and take that place in our life
[1:20:44] of
[1:20:46] authority but you and I you and I have
[1:20:50] as Paul would speak to us and admonish
[1:20:52] us to remember that let not sin
[1:20:56] therefore rign in your mortal body that
[1:20:59] is so good don't let things dwell kill
[1:21:02] it bring it in and bring it and try it
[1:21:05] by the word and it's not according to
[1:21:07] the word of God you say how do I know
[1:21:09] it's not according to the word of God
[1:21:10] just don't try it by the letter try it
[1:21:13] by the motive and objective that's in
[1:21:16] your heart that's very good are you
[1:21:19] hearing me cuz we can have maybe things
[1:21:21] WR down on the letter but our motive and
[1:21:24] objective can be wrong is that right now
[1:21:28] this is let me let me bring let me bring
[1:21:30] this down here in Romans 8:13 this is
[1:21:32] where Paul said if ye live after the
[1:21:34] flesh you shall die but if you through
[1:21:37] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[1:21:40] body you shall also live mortify means
[1:21:44] caused to be put to
[1:21:46] death now watch the same word is where
[1:21:49] we read in the beginning of Romans 8:36
[1:21:52] the same word mortify for thy sake we
[1:21:54] are killed all the day long for whose
[1:21:58] sake his sake for his sake that he might
[1:22:02] be manifest in our life that the word
[1:22:06] might be manifest he leads us to a place
[1:22:09] of full surrender he leads us to that
[1:22:12] place oh my 1 Peter 3:18 bu for Christ
[1:22:17] also once suffered for sins the just for
[1:22:19] the unjust that he might bring us to God
[1:22:22] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:22:25] quickened by the spirit how was he put
[1:22:28] to Death In the Flesh he didn't go to
[1:22:32] Calvary
[1:22:33] kicking
[1:22:35] screaming but he submitted his will to
[1:22:40] the will of God thank you Father thank
[1:22:42] you Jesus remember he knew what awaited
[1:22:46] him that's why that he prayed three
[1:22:50] times are you hearing me tonight he he
[1:22:53] entered in to your your suffering my S
[1:22:56] he entered in to know what it means to
[1:23:00] obey the word of God listen friends I
[1:23:03] don't mind telling you I think we can
[1:23:04] Fellowship on this there's certain
[1:23:06] things that God has spoke to our heart
[1:23:08] and he could call us to obey and then
[1:23:11] there's times in our life when tests and
[1:23:13] trials and offenses and everything come
[1:23:15] that's when obedience is a
[1:23:19] sacrifice that's because it causes us to
[1:23:22] sacrifice our own will
[1:23:25] our own thoughts our own feelings sir
[1:23:29] anybody with me tonight he calls us to
[1:23:32] do that place so it's being led and this
[1:23:35] is why that when as we come down here
[1:23:38] the scripture said for as many as are
[1:23:40] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:23:43] sons of God for we've not received the
[1:23:45] spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:23:47] you've received the spirit of adoption
[1:23:50] that which will produce full sunship
[1:23:54] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[1:23:57] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[1:24:00] that we are the children of God Amen
[1:24:03] there's a there's a Unity there's
[1:24:05] nothing that when that when we can stand
[1:24:07] upon that right there and in that place
[1:24:10] there's nothing that the word of God
[1:24:13] could say that there would be a
[1:24:15] disagreement in the spirit that's within
[1:24:19] me are you hearing me yes sir because
[1:24:22] remember the spirit and the word are not
[1:24:24] two separate things no they are
[1:24:27] one they are one that's right there
[1:24:30] might be things that I don't understand
[1:24:32] there might be things that when my flesh
[1:24:34] but there's something there that says
[1:24:36] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:24:40] done is that right there's a strength
[1:24:43] that prevails within us oh my I'm trying
[1:24:47] to bring this down here 2 Corinthians 10
[1:24:50] 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:24:54] do not war after the flesh for the
[1:24:57] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:25:00] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:25:04] down of
[1:25:06] strongholds amen that's what that's what
[1:25:08] we want we want strongholds to be pulled
[1:25:11] down areas that have been that look even
[1:25:15] within our lives where the holy spirit
[1:25:17] will come and deal within our lives that
[1:25:19] there are things that God comes around
[1:25:22] and says we need to deal with this
[1:25:24] strong you know what a stronghold is
[1:25:26] it's something that's preventing
[1:25:28] advancement from an army coming to a
[1:25:31] city and God comes and he deals with
[1:25:35] strongholds things that have been built
[1:25:37] up and sometimes we didn't even realize
[1:25:38] how has this been built up but God comes
[1:25:41] and as we will submit our life to him
[1:25:44] it's God who comes and he tears down
[1:25:48] those strongholds as a matter of fact
[1:25:49] pulling them down pulling them down that
[1:25:53] song we just sung there's no wall he
[1:25:55] won't tear
[1:25:56] down n none he won't break down coming
[1:25:59] after me and you know you know all it
[1:26:02] takes is to say yes Lord to agree with
[1:26:06] the word of God and when you agree with
[1:26:08] the word of God the word of God comes
[1:26:10] down we accept it we believe it and then
[1:26:13] the word itself will go and it will take
[1:26:16] care of that stronghold it has within it
[1:26:21] power yeah Power damous power like they
[1:26:26] break down those beaver dams out west
[1:26:28] when they want to clog up the water from
[1:26:31] traveling in certain places and those
[1:26:33] those rangers know hey water's not
[1:26:35] traveling like it should be let's go
[1:26:37] Upstream they don't look at what they
[1:26:39] see here let's go upstream and let's see
[1:26:43] what's hindering the flow of water
[1:26:45] you've got to go back to whatever is
[1:26:48] hindering it and the Holy Spirit knows
[1:26:51] exactly where to go in our lives to any
[1:26:54] anything that's hindering the flow of
[1:26:56] the Holy Spirit as a Believer and I'm
[1:26:59] glad that God has some Dynamite he knows
[1:27:02] how to strategically place and position
[1:27:06] in our
[1:27:07] lives and I want to say Lord put it
[1:27:10] there put it here put it there wherever
[1:27:12] Lord you see I don't want I don't want
[1:27:14] anything left of it I want it gone
[1:27:17] Lord I want it gone amen you know
[1:27:21] sometimes when they're putting that
[1:27:22] Dynamite they got to drill a little bit
[1:27:24] and then they'll put it there in the
[1:27:26] hole then they got to drill over here a
[1:27:28] little bit put in the hole you know what
[1:27:29] they're getting it in the places so that
[1:27:32] the thing the area is
[1:27:34] moved God knows just how to position in
[1:27:37] our
[1:27:38] lives sometimes he'll take a series of
[1:27:40] services and
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:43] he'll then he'll send in then he'll send
[1:27:45] in another
[1:27:47] brother then he'll send in another one
[1:27:49] you know God loves to surprise us yes
[1:27:53] God God you know God isn't intimidated
[1:27:55] by our Humanity our Humanity can still
[1:27:57] be there and God you know what he just
[1:27:59] goes right he goes right beyond that
[1:28:00] what are you what are you saying by that
[1:28:02] I'm saying God will bring in other
[1:28:03] Ministries it's a different looking Veil
[1:28:06] but it's the same God and God's working
[1:28:08] in the same way in our lives and you
[1:28:10] know what it does and here we sometimes
[1:28:12] you know we we might be a little bit
[1:28:13] more open or a little bit more loose and
[1:28:15] God's
[1:28:16] just and he's putting them sticks of
[1:28:18] dynamite and all of it is his
[1:28:22] working that's what I love about about
[1:28:24] it I love him for that don't you oh I
[1:28:27] just those little things like that just
[1:28:29] to me it's a great big thing it just
[1:28:30] makes me love him makes me love him so
[1:28:32] much more casting down
[1:28:35] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:28:38] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:28:40] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:28:43] thought now I want you to notice this
[1:28:44] let me just close on this casting down
[1:28:47] imaginations right and every High thing
[1:28:51] that exalted itself against the
[1:28:52] knowledge of God nothing nothing is to
[1:28:54] be raised above the
[1:28:58] word
[1:29:00] nothing and bring every captivity
[1:29:03] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:29:05] The Obedience of Christ and having in a
[1:29:07] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[1:29:10] when your obedience is fulfilled now I
[1:29:13] want you to watch this how brother Bram
[1:29:15] places this here in the message
[1:29:16] inspiration I'm I'm closing in the
[1:29:18] message inspiration brother Bram says it
[1:29:20] like this because I want you to think
[1:29:22] casting down reasonings brother BR says
[1:29:25] each one of you had experiences where
[1:29:28] you would think and somebody will say it
[1:29:30] can't happen it won't be but something
[1:29:34] right down in your soul that tells you
[1:29:37] it's going to be yes sir it don't make
[1:29:40] any difference what anybody else says or
[1:29:42] how unreasonable it seems to be you seem
[1:29:45] to know that it's going to be that way
[1:29:48] it's because your soul has testified and
[1:29:52] reasonings has been cast down as the
[1:29:55] Bible said they should be casting down
[1:29:59] reasonings you see the power of agreeing
[1:30:01] with the word of God so be it Lord and
[1:30:04] receiving the word of God and not trying
[1:30:06] to compare it to anything else but
[1:30:09] receive the word of God the word of God
[1:30:11] it will displace and cast out
[1:30:14] reasonings watch this an uncertain sound
[1:30:16] I'll give you a couple examples here in
[1:30:18] a minute watch this again brother Ram
[1:30:19] says All Of You' had this at times when
[1:30:22] you would think I don't know whether it
[1:30:24] could happen or not and all at once
[1:30:28] something just tells you it's going to
[1:30:30] happen regardless of what anybody else
[1:30:32] says you know it's going to happen he
[1:30:35] said we've all had them experiences
[1:30:37] that's now watch this watch very
[1:30:38] carefully that's when your heart's
[1:30:41] thinking see there's a difference when
[1:30:42] your heart's thinking and then we're
[1:30:44] using this to think
[1:30:46] with is that right notice he says that's
[1:30:49] when your heart's thinking as a man
[1:30:51] thinketh in his heart see he said the
[1:30:52] Mind reasons but the heart don't reason
[1:30:55] it just believes amen that's when the
[1:30:58] heart is thinking that's what God comes
[1:31:01] by his word the ministering of his word
[1:31:04] is to bring his word in our life and
[1:31:08] it'll change our thoughts I I think we
[1:31:10] can all Fellowship on this there's times
[1:31:12] we've set right here I won't just say
[1:31:14] times but I can't tell you how many
[1:31:16] times sitting right here and the Holy
[1:31:17] Spirit has come and it's been a
[1:31:19] discernment of my thoughts and with the
[1:31:22] discernment of my thoughts there's been
[1:31:24] a change that you just you realize man
[1:31:27] this is speaking directly to
[1:31:30] me I'm not talking about you I'm talking
[1:31:32] about me right now when I've sat right
[1:31:34] here and said this is speaking directly
[1:31:36] to me and you know what I needed that I
[1:31:39] I wasn't catching it maybe in a certain
[1:31:41] way and God will come right down and you
[1:31:43] realize hey this is exactly where I am
[1:31:47] this is exactly what I've needed and
[1:31:50] what happens as soon as you receive it
[1:31:53] and submit to it it's a casting down of
[1:31:55] reasonings yes it so the casting down of
[1:31:58] reasoning isn't like our mental exercise
[1:32:01] it's receiving the word of God it's
[1:32:04] presenting ourselves in a place to where
[1:32:07] the word of God can drop into our
[1:32:09] hearts remember brother Bram said job
[1:32:11] had a way of being able to get himself
[1:32:15] out of the way and inspiration to come
[1:32:19] you know the little shinomi woman
[1:32:20] brother BR uses this
[1:32:22] example where when she got after her
[1:32:26] little son had passed and had that heat
[1:32:29] stroke but when she got there before the
[1:32:32] prophet and here when they asked how is
[1:32:36] it with you and your house she said all
[1:32:41] is
[1:32:42] well right there reasonings was cast
[1:32:45] down imaginations was cast down right
[1:32:49] she didn't know how everything was going
[1:32:51] to happen she didn't know everything
[1:32:52] that was going to take place but right
[1:32:54] there she had an assurance this is the
[1:32:57] word of the Lord for me Glory right and
[1:33:02] right there she cast down
[1:33:05] reasonings when Bud brother Brown
[1:33:07] remember the vision brother Brown had of
[1:33:09] the Caribou than the vision brother Bram
[1:33:11] had about killing that Silver Tip
[1:33:13] Grizzly remember that yeah and here but
[1:33:15] I like how brother Bram tells it in
[1:33:17] wisdom versus faith when God gave him
[1:33:19] that vision of what was going to take
[1:33:20] place on that hunting trip and see God
[1:33:24] had it in such a way bud being a guide
[1:33:27] in that part of the country he told
[1:33:29] brother brandham brother Bram I ain't
[1:33:31] never seen Grizzlies here I Ain never
[1:33:34] seen them here you say you know if you
[1:33:37] listen if we're not careful you get to
[1:33:39] look at things and you're thinking well
[1:33:41] what does that testimony have to do with
[1:33:42] my life there's a lot of things that you
[1:33:45] might not see in your life but God sees
[1:33:50] in your life God knows what he's placed
[1:33:53] in your life life he knows the vision of
[1:33:56] your life and of my life come on now
[1:34:00] what good could come out of this what
[1:34:02] good could come out of their life God
[1:34:03] knows what he's placed in your life
[1:34:06] Hallelujah and here bud said brother
[1:34:09] Bram is talking about it how Bud said
[1:34:11] and he looked over what brother Brown
[1:34:12] was going to shoot him with that right
[1:34:14] there was troubling too yeah yeah that
[1:34:16] gun yeah that gun wasn't fitting that
[1:34:19] caliber was not fitting to shoot a
[1:34:21] Grizzly with right all right it'd be
[1:34:24] like trying to shoot it'd be the
[1:34:25] equivalency almost of trying to shoot a
[1:34:27] deer with a pellet
[1:34:30] gun I'm not you know I I don't have the
[1:34:33] exact caliber but Bud was a bud being a
[1:34:35] guide back there professional he's
[1:34:37] looking at everything and that's the gun
[1:34:40] that's what it is and then and then Bud
[1:34:43] told him continue to say never seen one
[1:34:45] out here brother Bram even throughout
[1:34:47] brother Bram are are you sure that are
[1:34:50] are you sure about with this and brother
[1:34:52] Ram said Bud you're not doubting are
[1:34:55] you you're not doubting are you but no
[1:34:57] brother BR I you know I I love that I
[1:35:00] love those stories in there and he's
[1:35:02] looking over there and but said no no no
[1:35:04] I'm not he said butd he said I kind of
[1:35:06] believe you are he said but he he told
[1:35:08] me he said he was going to come down
[1:35:10] like this and and he says this is the
[1:35:12] way he says and I'd get him right there
[1:35:13] between the eyes and he would fall right
[1:35:15] here and he said and butd just kept on
[1:35:17] going and brother BR says it like this
[1:35:19] he said what was taking place he said
[1:35:22] God had revealed it I believed it and he
[1:35:26] said when that has happened you cast
[1:35:29] down all reasonings and all
[1:35:33] circumstances that's why it's so
[1:35:35] important for a vision of the word
[1:35:38] that's why it's important friends that's
[1:35:40] why the word of God when it's coming it
[1:35:42] brings Clarity in our walk with God it
[1:35:46] brings Clarity of a vision that's before
[1:35:49] us yes sir and then brother bram's there
[1:35:52] aiming
[1:35:53] he's waiting on brother Bram to shoot
[1:35:56] it finally when brother brandham when he
[1:35:59] shoots it where he saw the vision tell
[1:36:02] him to shoot it and you know the bear
[1:36:05] brother Bud said I didn't know it was
[1:36:07] going to end up in my
[1:36:10] lap but you see God had already
[1:36:14] spoken and I wanted to say this to you
[1:36:17] we seen through the life of the
[1:36:20] Prophet what God is bringing you and I
[1:36:24] to oh yes oh yes you know it's one thing
[1:36:27] God could have just told us but God also
[1:36:30] showed us I'm not lifting up brother
[1:36:31] brandom you understand that what I'm
[1:36:34] trying to tell you is and and I where I
[1:36:36] stand the same quality of the holy
[1:36:39] spirit that was within him is the same
[1:36:42] one in you and me and what it produced
[1:36:45] there it's producing in our lives to
[1:36:49] where to be able to stand there where
[1:36:51] there doesn't seem to be anything
[1:36:54] but to stand there and say God's word is
[1:36:57] true that when tests and trials like we
[1:37:00] job as we just wrap that up in that
[1:37:02] point where job stands there and job is
[1:37:05] standing we're privileged let me say
[1:37:08] this to you we are privileged to stand
[1:37:11] in a place where you and I look at it
[1:37:14] right now to have an understanding that
[1:37:17] when test or trials comes it's not
[1:37:21] God that's doing it he's permitting it
[1:37:25] to mold us to shape us to temper us to
[1:37:30] make us see whether or not we're really
[1:37:33] tied to this
[1:37:35] earth and you know what sometimes
[1:37:37] there's things that maybe God it can
[1:37:39] show up a little bit in our lives and we
[1:37:41] realize Lord I want to be tied tighter
[1:37:43] to
[1:37:44] you I want to be tied tighter to you
[1:37:46] than anything of this world see we we
[1:37:49] don't we don't ever want to get to a
[1:37:50] place where we're too big and say well
[1:37:52] I'm I'm I'm not I'm not tied down with
[1:37:54] the Earth but there's always more of a
[1:37:56] loosening Lord I I want to be tied more
[1:37:58] I I want Lord not that the thoughts
[1:38:00] won't come through but I want to mature
[1:38:02] I want my life I want to just continue
[1:38:04] to mature and where our thoughts and
[1:38:08] that maturity that you know God is with
[1:38:10] us God is in control I don't know what's
[1:38:13] taking place I don't know all that's I
[1:38:15] don't know all that's going on but I
[1:38:17] know that God is in
[1:38:20] control I know God is in control and you
[1:38:23] know what
[1:38:24] I know that I'm a part of this Rapture
[1:38:27] and this Rapture is a part of
[1:38:29] me I may not know all the inet between
[1:38:32] here and there but I know one thing he
[1:38:34] has given his word and his word is
[1:38:37] sufficient to see me through and if
[1:38:40] we'll take in that word just just taking
[1:38:42] in that word oh God I want to just be an
[1:38:44] absorbant to that word I want to pass my
[1:38:46] thoughts I want to pass all of my life
[1:38:48] through that word Lord that where we
[1:38:50] stand within it there's a maturing in in
[1:38:53] our
[1:38:54] thinking when we're not we're not
[1:38:56] entertaining some things as we used to
[1:38:58] entertain it before I believe the grace
[1:39:01] of God comes to give us victory in every
[1:39:04] area of our life I tell you we're
[1:39:06] friends we're a privileged people but
[1:39:08] the Privileges we don't want to let the
[1:39:10] moment pass Us by either Lord I want to
[1:39:13] I just want to I want to draw from you
[1:39:15] Lord I want my want I want to
[1:39:19] grow I want to continue to grow I want
[1:39:22] to continue to mature I want everything
[1:39:24] all that he asked that's what I want to
[1:39:26] do but Lord even in my own life that
[1:39:29] there's a mastering of every
[1:39:30] circumstance don't you love him amen
[1:39:34] let's just let's pray
[1:39:35] together Heavenly Father Lord we just
[1:39:39] want to say thank you amen this evening
[1:39:42] Lord yes Father this is Lord truly the
[1:39:47] desire that Lord I know that Lord not
[1:39:51] only in my heart but I can say with all
[1:39:53] of our hearts Lord It's your desire for
[1:39:56] our lives Lord that as even in that
[1:39:58] maturing Lord as Sons and Daughters of
[1:40:00] God that Lord it moves Lord to where
[1:40:04] even in our thinking and realizing Lord
[1:40:08] that that that Battleground Lord that no
[1:40:11] man's land lord even as brother Jerry
[1:40:14] Lord you would guide him through Lord
[1:40:16] three different Services Lord where he
[1:40:18] was ministering here Lord just there
[1:40:20] were just parts of it Lord just
[1:40:22] continuing to move through within there
[1:40:25] and how that God that you encourage us
[1:40:28] Lord that we can see who we are see who
[1:40:31] you've called us to be Lord and father
[1:40:35] you've not asked us Lord that it would
[1:40:38] be us doing it but you've asked Lord and
[1:40:41] it's for us to yield to you sometimes
[1:40:44] Lord in our thoughts about things we can
[1:40:46] get so tied up Lord I think Lord even
[1:40:50] sometimes when we'd come Lord even maybe
[1:40:52] for a procedure surgery or some sort of
[1:40:56] thing Lord sometimes Lord we can get so
[1:40:59] tense and I think about that Lord of
[1:41:02] just even in our thinking sometimes Lord
[1:41:04] with other things that take place around
[1:41:07] us and Lord It's always it's where the
[1:41:10] enemy Lord wants to come and try to Lord
[1:41:14] hinder the yielding in our lives to you
[1:41:18] true
[1:41:20] Lord help us Lord to yield more to you
[1:41:24] Lord I think of how the prophet when you
[1:41:27] spoke to him and
[1:41:28] said you must be more sincere right and
[1:41:33] his response to you was Lord forgive me
[1:41:36] for my insincerity help me help me to be
