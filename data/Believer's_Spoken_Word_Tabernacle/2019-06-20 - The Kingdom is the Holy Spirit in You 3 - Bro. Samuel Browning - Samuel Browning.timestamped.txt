[33:15] Lives Lord I pray tonight we believe it
[33:18] Lord God as your children Lord that we
[33:20] are standing Lord redeemed by the blood

[33:47] Lord for your grace and mercy Lord that
[33:51] has come to our hearts Lord be with each
[33:53] and every request that has rolled here
[33:55] tonight Lord each one that was lifted up
[33:58] before your throne Lord different ones
[34:00] of your children Lord that are not here
[34:02] tonight Lord many that are sick in their
[34:04] body Lord and we'd pray Heavenly Father
[34:06] even for those Lord that would be
[34:08] working tonight that you would remember
[34:10] Lord
[34:11] each one of them Lord God we pray
[34:13] knowing that Lord that their hearts
[34:15] desire truly Lord is to be in the house
[34:17] of God may you just Lord have your way
[34:20] now we pray Lord help the man part to
[34:22] step to the side that you might come
[34:25] Lord and speak Lord through our hearts
[34:27] what we have need of we love you and we
[34:29] thank you now Lord in the name of Jesus
[34:32] Christ
[34:33] amen and amen amen you love him tonight
[34:39] Amen if you would turn with me to John
[34:42] chapter three and so good to be in the
[34:45] house of the Lord
[34:49] Lord willing of Gerald administering
[34:52] Forrest so good to have he and sister
[34:54] mean on your with us Lydia
[34:57] [Applause]
[35:03] certainly would much rather hear him
[35:05] than me
[35:08] and but the reason that I just felt to
[35:12] go ahead and just take even at the
[35:13] service of other jury thing I think the
[35:15] Lord for him being here
[35:17] we'll be ministering here force next
[35:19] week and then the following week when we
[35:20] leave out to go to believers youth camp
[35:24] there in to to minister in that camp
[35:28] I just got to look at my phone I've been
[35:30] this if I don't speak in this week
[35:32] there'll be multiple weeks three weeks
[35:34] or so before I would get a chance to
[35:36] stand back in the pulpit and it
[35:38] certainly isn't like I have to stand
[35:40] here but I also know that sheep get a
[35:43] little antsy so we we want to just you
[35:47] just just be in prayer for us I just
[35:51] want to say tonight some of you were not
[35:53] at the prayer meeting but certainly
[35:55] appreciate your prayers when we were
[35:57] there with indeed the services that we
[36:00] had in New Mexico and the Lord just
[36:02] richly moved among us in a very special
[36:05] way
[36:06] amen many hearts and lives were just so
[36:09] touched
[36:09] amen by it by the Holy Spirit it was
[36:13] things that you know you stand in
[36:15] amazement of how that God starts
[36:17] something and even in times were you
[36:20] know it was just something to wear one
[36:21] minister he would finish and then God
[36:24] had it where the next one would just
[36:25] come right along and you know you don't
[36:27] talk to one another about those things
[36:29] it's just God orchestrated that's
[36:33] wonderful in it we're not under the the
[36:36] Dominion of a man were under the
[36:38] leadership of the Holy Ghost and so I
[36:40] just so appreciate that with all my
[36:42] heart I even in myself I was getting
[36:44] ready to go in some certain directions
[36:46] and I thought nah when I got done
[36:47] speaking I thought man I just couldn't
[36:49] get to that point you know and I was
[36:52] wanting to work with that point knowing
[36:54] the prayer line was coming that night
[36:55] and I and you know when i brother joel
[36:58] came up in the office and he said my
[37:01] goodness he said you had to stop at this
[37:03] point and i began to talk to him and he
[37:05] said this is exactly what
[37:07] had in my notes so needless to say I
[37:10] felt really you know relieved you know
[37:12] of the Lord because and and you know
[37:14] what God really moved there everything I
[37:17] tell you what there were many hearts
[37:19] that lives that were set free many that
[37:23] were delivered with right there in those
[37:24] service many that were filled with the
[37:26] Holy Ghost and souls that were were
[37:29] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so
[37:31] we just thank God that God is still
[37:33] moving amen so here in in John chapter
[37:37] three I'm just gonna read a few verses
[37:39] and we'll let you be seated tonight I
[37:41] don't want to take too long but in John
[37:44] chapter 3 verse 3 jesus answered and
[37:48] said unto them unto Him verily verily I
[37:50] say unto you except a man be born again
[37:53] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[37:57] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[38:01] born when he is old he can't can he
[38:04] enter the second time into his mother's
[38:06] womb and be born and you and I both know
[38:10] even if you could go back to your youth
[38:13] you still would end up where you are
[38:16] that's why the body changes not just
[38:18] taking us back to young people there's
[38:20] got to be a complete change amen all the
[38:24] buttons about our life have got to be
[38:25] removed the buttons that everybody can
[38:28] push those buttons have got to be gone
[38:30] and their fingers that push our buttons
[38:33] will be gone also over there so we don't
[38:35] want to just go back to being young
[38:37] people that ain't the answer we must be
[38:39] born again and when we're born again
[38:42] then that leads us there to where this
[38:44] body will be born again Oh glory be to
[38:48] God amen verse 5 jesus answered verily
[38:51] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[38:54] born of water and of the spirit he
[38:58] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[39:01] verse 6 that which is born of the flesh
[39:04] is flesh and that which is born of the
[39:08] Spirit is spirit and Marvel not that I
[39:11] said unto thee you must be
[39:13] born again that's the truth and not you
[39:18] you should consider it but you must be
[39:21] born again the wind bloweth where it
[39:25] listeth thou hearest the sound thereof
[39:28] but canst not tell whence it cometh and
[39:31] whither it goeth and soul is every one
[39:34] that is born of the Spirit amen may God
[39:38] bless you bless his word as you're being
[39:40] seated
[39:44] I want to just continue the thought
[39:46] where we were looking at a couple weeks
[39:48] ago well we've been looking on this on
[39:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[39:54] the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you
[39:58] and I just continue to look at that
[40:01] thought a little bit more tonight if the
[40:03] Lord will help us on that of the kingdom
[40:06] within us and to recognize that a
[40:08] kingdom itself it is truly that of of a
[40:12] domain and it's that of a Dominion and
[40:15] where that we stand as sons and
[40:19] daughters of God to be brought into this
[40:21] kingdom by the king himself and that he
[40:25] indeed is is the the ruler and the
[40:29] director of our lives and brother
[40:31] Branham you know because we we look in
[40:34] this hour and the scripture that we that
[40:36] we can look at Jesus when he said except
[40:40] a man be born of water and of the spirit
[40:42] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[40:45] and we recognized that it must be that
[40:49] it must be by the word and by the Spirit
[40:51] coming together by the very person of
[40:55] the Lord Jesus Christ making himself
[40:57] known and there there is no way that
[41:01] we're here when the Lord Jesus is is his
[41:04] ministering dystiny además there was
[41:06] nothing within the power of man for a
[41:09] man to be able to birth himself or to
[41:12] bring this about there's not one thing
[41:14] and I once you just kind of hang on to
[41:16] that tonight and let it be like an
[41:17] underlying theme that there was nothing
[41:19] that man could do to bring this about
[41:22] yet there was a longing that was within
[41:25] man even after that Adam fell from where
[41:28] he was and to recognize that where God
[41:31] restores us is not just to back where
[41:34] Adam was but it goes beyond that because
[41:36] wherever Adam was Adam could fall from
[41:39] it but where God takes us back to there
[41:42] is no falling from that and you see what
[41:45] God's desire is to do is to let the nail
[41:48] be driven in such a place within our
[41:50] life to where it dismantles any fear of
[41:53] ever falling away any fear because we're
[41:57] is fear faith cannot operate and God
[42:00] desires that we would operate by the
[42:03] faith and the authority of his work and
[42:06] he is working that is now within our
[42:09] life and so when we look at this Jesus
[42:11] let it be such a clear prescription that
[42:15] is here that when we look at it within
[42:17] this this day and they think of it not
[42:20] just within this day but it has been the
[42:22] very ploy and plot of Satan down through
[42:25] time ever since even the coming of the
[42:28] Holy Ghost it has been Satan's desire to
[42:30] somehow dismantle and take the power of
[42:33] the Living God away from the church
[42:35] Satan did was not worried or did he care
[42:38] how much theology or how right that the
[42:42] church would be in their doctrine but he
[42:44] did not want them to receive the very
[42:46] person of Jesus Christ
[42:48] because when you receive that of the
[42:50] person of Jesus Christ
[42:52] or should I say he receives us then it
[42:55] is his power working in us that makes
[42:58] that word alive and makes it a reality
[43:01] within our lives so Satan has always
[43:04] sought to take away from the very
[43:06] working of what Calvary of what the
[43:09] resurrection of what the whole working
[43:11] of the Lord Jesus would bring us to and
[43:13] that would be that of the new birth and
[43:15] bring us to a life to where Christ would
[43:17] live on the inside of us you think about
[43:20] how in the beginning when Adam went his
[43:22] way and and how that the fall had taken
[43:25] place it Adam himself was under the
[43:27] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[43:29] if you think about it God never spoke to
[43:32] the flesh man Adam and said let him have
[43:34] dominion over the flesh of the sea and
[43:37] fowls of the air but he spoke to the
[43:39] spirit man Adam that man who was created
[43:42] in his own image
[43:44] because it was not the spirit man that
[43:46] would have dominion but it was the
[43:48] Dominion of the spirit man that would be
[43:50] manifest in the flesh body that he was
[43:53] wrapped in soul was God's desire to
[43:55] bring you and I back to that place of
[43:57] Dominion and authority to where there
[44:00] would not be any fear that would
[44:02] dominate the church or the people of the
[44:05] Living God but they would be operating
[44:07] in a true faith and a
[44:09] that God himself would impart into the
[44:12] lives and hearts of the believer
[44:14] so it would be solidly a work of God
[44:16] himself and that's why then when we look
[44:19] at it in this time that we're living in
[44:21] Paul would say that you know not another
[44:24] Jesus that it cannot be another Jesus
[44:27] and we see another Jesus has been
[44:30] constantly presented it's been something
[44:33] because if Satan can get people to
[44:35] believe in another Jesus then they do
[44:38] not receive the Lord Jesus and receiving
[44:41] all that he is because what he was he
[44:44] still is today and so if he can somehow
[44:48] separate them and sever them from that
[44:51] word then remember the Spirit of God it
[44:53] travels with the word and so this is
[44:56] where Paul would would let it be clear
[44:58] to you and I that it's not another Jesus
[45:01] but Paul himself would be burdened by
[45:03] the Spirit of God that to see that the
[45:06] Lord Jesus Christ who is our atonement
[45:08] who is our Passover who is our
[45:11] all-in-all you see Paul takes it to a
[45:13] place to where there's nothing then
[45:15] showing you and I clearly man could do
[45:18] nothing on his own but God has provided
[45:20] a way that you and I might come to what
[45:24] God has desired for our lives in it is
[45:28] not even us that can justify ourselves
[45:29] you and I cannot say to fire ourselves
[45:32] you and I cannot seal ourselves it is
[45:35] God and his sovereign working alone and
[45:39] that's why our faith rest on the power
[45:41] of God and what God has done in our
[45:45] lives
[45:49] glory be to God this is where that when
[45:53] we look at it so often you know you find
[45:57] so many times the where that of the new
[46:01] birth being born again filled with the
[46:04] Holy Ghost these it has M so much of
[46:07] what the reality has been substituted
[46:10] for handshakes substituted for so many
[46:14] things now we don't have to just look
[46:17] out there that's come right in around
[46:18] our message ranks there have been so
[46:21] much that's been substituted for the
[46:23] real reality of the Living God
[46:28] you see when brother Brandon would speak
[46:30] about the true evidence is receiving the
[46:32] word it's not just about agreeing with
[46:35] it it's not just about that you can look
[46:38] at it and say it's the truth
[46:40] but it's where the very person of truth
[46:43] he comes into your life and he declares
[46:46] through your life what you say has been
[46:48] revealed is now vindicated in your life
[46:51] by the power of the Living God are you
[46:55] in so many times then eNOS it has come
[46:58] to a place where it's been diminished to
[47:00] look at and say well I just believe the
[47:02] message or I just believe God send a
[47:03] prophet that devil believes all those
[47:05] things the devil can talk all those
[47:08] things but the one thing the devil never
[47:11] could do he could never get the Holy
[47:13] Ghost Judas could not get the Holy Ghost
[47:16] that one one of them disciples could
[47:18] hold a candle to Judas in the
[47:20] ministering of the word but remember
[47:22] Judas never went off to get the Holy
[47:25] Ghost Oh glory so it comes down to where
[47:31] the Prophet would speak to us improving
[47:34] his word and I've been reading this
[47:35] quote to you but he speaks to us and
[47:38] sells out of these scripture Siri says
[47:40] the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you so
[47:44] you have to understand what this is in
[47:48] you and the only way you'll understand
[47:51] it is compare what it makes you do with
[47:55] what the Bible said it would make you do
[47:59] you see this where if you can look at
[48:02] this clearly without me taking a lot of
[48:04] time the devil could try to say a lot of
[48:07] things to you he could try to say you're
[48:10] all worked up it could try to get you to
[48:14] a place to where you get to looking at
[48:16] yourself instead of your sacrifice he
[48:20] can get you to a place to where here you
[48:22] are you're looking at all of your
[48:24] mistakes and your failures and if he
[48:26] gets you to looking at that you're
[48:27] looking at the wrong thing but brother
[48:30] when you can recognize that there has
[48:32] come about a change and a desire in your
[48:35] life and you did not produce that change
[48:37] but for living God produced that change
[48:40] whether however it was that it came to
[48:43] you brother when he comes he is a person
[48:46] and when he sets up there's a change
[48:49] that takes place in your life are you
[48:53] with me and let me just let's just put
[48:56] all traditions to sign you don't have to
[48:58] be in a church come on somebody you
[49:02] don't have to be in a church God will
[49:04] meet you right there when you meet him
[49:07] in the conditions of his world they met
[49:13] God can meet you right at your house for
[49:15] some of you no doubt that's where it did
[49:17] take place you see what it is you stand
[49:20] on is recognizing what has come into you
[49:23] that makes you live the way you do
[49:31] hallelujah the kingdom is the Holy
[49:34] Spirit in you huh he's the person then
[49:38] you say amen to that
[49:39] he's the person within you he says now
[49:44] the only way you understand it is
[49:46] compare what it makes you do with what
[49:49] the Bible said it would make you man
[49:52] that's a loaded statement interval
[49:53] journey it's loaded compared what it
[49:56] makes you do you used to do one thing
[50:00] but now you don't do that you do this
[50:03] and nobody makes you do this you do it
[50:06] from a surrendered heart
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:10] something's changed then your problems
[50:17] solved and then he is that holy spirit
[50:21] now remember Jesus in John 18:36 Jesus
[50:27] said when it's standing before Pilate My
[50:29] Kingdom is not of this world if my
[50:34] kingdom were of this world then would my
[50:37] servants fight that I should not be
[50:40] delivered to the Jews but now is my
[50:45] kingdom not from thence
[50:48] I know it's not from fence but it's
[50:50] coming you had now we understand when we
[50:55] as we look at this that the kingdom is
[50:58] the Holy Spirit within you and to
[50:59] recognize that the Holy Spirit we we see
[51:03] that that it's not a third person it's
[51:06] not the mascot boy it's a living God the
[51:09] same God who was above us with us now in
[51:13] us remember you and I look at our maybe
[51:17] would touch us on Sunday you and I look
[51:19] at what our inheritance and our rights
[51:22] but let us remember that God has an
[51:25] inheritance and God's inheritance and
[51:27] rights is that he would live and
[51:30] manifest his life in through the life of
[51:34] a believer
[51:35] we are God's inheritance so to look at
[51:39] this that my kingdom is not of this
[51:41] world the kingdom is the person of Jesus
[51:44] Christ
[51:45] remember when Saul remember when the
[51:48] kingdom was departed from Saul Saul
[51:50] still had the title he had a title but
[51:53] the kingdom was no longer with him
[51:55] because the kingdom is that of the
[51:58] anointing of that of the very person of
[52:01] Jesus Christ
[52:02] that had been anointing Saul's life but
[52:04] saw himself he rejected the Word of God
[52:07] and so God removed the kingdom from him
[52:11] and gain the throne of the heart I can't
[52:16] get into that tonight with David but to
[52:18] recognize it was in David that that he
[52:21] became king over Israel again David
[52:26] brought the Lord back in power in Israel
[52:29] through a surrender life he came back to
[52:32] that of the throne oh my that's the same
[52:36] way in our lives
[52:37] oh my now notice you know the kingdom
[52:42] here it's not of this earth so it's not
[52:44] of a man's thinking not of a man's doing
[52:47] it's in our hearts it's a spiritual
[52:50] Kingdom that were born into and the Holy
[52:52] Spirit God's kingdom moving in the man
[52:54] and governing and controlling him that's
[52:58] the kingdom now I want you to look at
[53:01] this in cloth
[53:01] one of the Lord let's look at this here
[53:06] in Colossians 1 chapter 12 I don't know
[53:12] how much of this thought I can get read
[53:13] but we'll just read just a little bit of
[53:15] it here Colossians 1 and verse 12 giving
[53:22] thanks unto the Father which hath made
[53:27] us meet to be partakers of the
[53:32] inheritance of the Saints in light
[53:36] he had made us meet
[53:39] that word meet means to be qualified we
[53:44] could not be qualified to receive life
[53:47] without him there is no way you know
[53:52] this is why when it comes down to it
[53:54] when we look at the very prescription of
[53:58] the word repent and be baptized in the
[54:00] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[54:01] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you
[54:06] can't earn the Holy Ghost
[54:08] you can't merit the Holy Ghost it's not
[54:11] a reward the Holy Ghost is the gift of
[54:14] God where God Himself gives it not
[54:18] because you earned it
[54:20] because if you feel like you earned it
[54:22] and that's the reason you have it you'll
[54:24] live defeat and when you don't feel
[54:26] right but if you recognize that you were
[54:29] not received and the gift was not given
[54:32] because that you are perfect but the
[54:35] gift is given because God can look down
[54:37] into the depth of your heart and he
[54:40] knows you believe every word and he
[54:44] comes down and he seals that heart
[54:51] you see when it's one we we have been
[54:54] received of him brother I'm telling you
[54:58] you recognized there was nothing you did
[55:01] to merit this you walk with the humility
[55:06] of heart not with your nose up in the
[55:08] air where you were drowned out there
[55:09] today come on you rap walk with the
[55:13] humility of heart because you know that
[55:15] there has been one that has ministered
[55:17] to you and acceptance and you have been
[55:21] accepted in the beloved you wonder how
[55:27] am I going to get looser this you know
[55:29] when God deals with the person even for
[55:31] you and I to be qualified God calls a
[55:35] heart and that heart may have all sorts
[55:37] of habits about its life that's still
[55:40] hanging on there and it's holding it but
[55:42] notice he moves down there and he is our
[55:45] sanctification
[55:46] he's the sanctified he's the one who
[55:49] cleanses he's the one who burns out
[55:51] every desire of the world they met and
[55:55] once he gets everything burned out then
[55:57] he steps down on the inside and rather
[56:00] that's why the scripture said we are his
[56:03] workmanship hallelujah he meant he had
[56:12] made us qualified you knew makes us
[56:14] qualified for the rapture he does when
[56:18] it comes down to that day or to that
[56:20] moment he's the one he's our qualifier
[56:23] for the rapture
[56:25] they meant that token in our life is the
[56:28] qualifier
[56:31] glory be to God whoo look at this in
[56:35] verse 13 who hath delivered us from the
[56:39] power of darkness not a lot not a person
[56:45] delivers come on somebody not a belief a
[56:50] person delivers us Amen a spiritual
[56:54] power of the Living God who hath
[56:57] delivered us this is why Jesus would
[57:04] pick it up there within the scriptures
[57:07] and Luke and in Matthew and to think of
[57:09] how the scriptures would even put it
[57:11] speaking of a strength a greater power
[57:13] coming he would speak even concerning
[57:16] that of Jacob and speaking of the angel
[57:18] the strong one redeemed to Jacob and
[57:22] brother that's the same way within our
[57:25] life there was a lot of things that was
[57:27] strong that was holding off a bondage
[57:30] that we were in but there came a
[57:31] stronger one and the stronger one what
[57:34] did he do he spoiled battle house he
[57:37] spoiled the goods he stripped that one
[57:40] that had rule and authority and power
[57:43] over our life he dismantled that and he
[57:46] moves to the inside and then you know
[57:49] what he tells you you're my witness
[57:52] you go tell what I've done for you you
[57:55] be my witness
[57:57] you're my witness there of the power of
[57:59] God hallelujah
[58:03] Moses can't take your place Jonah can't
[58:07] take your place
[58:08] Elijah can't take your place you've got
[58:11] your place to announce that God is still
[58:14] the same yesterday today and forever
[58:17] his power is still the same we're not
[58:23] serving a historical God but the god of
[58:27] history is the ever-present I am it will
[58:32] have never helped Israel or built their
[58:35] faith if Moses would have went down
[58:37] there in talking to them about a
[58:39] historical God but they had to let him
[58:42] know the god of history then made a
[58:45] promise is the same God now that's
[58:49] fulfilling what was a promise look to
[58:52] the future he is the I am the present
[58:55] God hallelujah blessed be the name of
[59:05] the Lord who hath delivered us from the
[59:09] power of darkness and hath translated us
[59:15] into the kingdom of his dear son the
[59:23] domain the Dominion remember Jesus could
[59:28] say he was in this world but I'm not of
[59:31] it he was walking in two worlds at the
[59:35] same time all right here he was that he
[59:40] recognized the because Satan presented
[59:42] to him all the kingdoms of this world
[59:44] but here it was the kingdom of God and
[59:47] here God was coming back into power
[59:51] remember here how that the Lord Jesus
[59:53] being a type of David here it is moving
[59:56] back into power and and to see how that
[1:00:00] we're the Bible says that he has
[1:00:02] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:00:05] dear son under that domain under that of
[1:00:08] the leadership of the Holy Spirit now
[1:00:12] we're going to look at this here
[1:00:13] remember the Bible when we look at it in
[1:00:16] this verse of scripture I don't have
[1:00:17] time to read all these scriptures here
[1:00:19] but you know what Paul takes and he Lee
[1:00:22] he goes through right here in the book
[1:00:24] of Colossians he brings it up over in
[1:00:26] the book of Corinthians chapter 5 and he
[1:00:29] lets it be known even in Romans 5 you
[1:00:31] and I have been reconciled back to God
[1:00:35] God didn't need reconciled we did got
[1:00:40] one lost we were are you with me
[1:00:44] so God he is alone is the one who made
[1:00:48] the payment for you and I I wish I could
[1:00:52] preach this how I feel you know I was
[1:00:56] witnessing here not too long ago through
[1:00:58] a man you know he had been a Navy
[1:01:01] veteran and first of all you know when I
[1:01:03] always find that out I always think I'm
[1:01:04] thank you for your service sir I
[1:01:06] appreciate what you did for us and I
[1:01:08] begin to talk to him and you know he
[1:01:10] said at one time I served the Lord I
[1:01:11] said well well what happened he said
[1:01:14] well he said you know I got you know
[1:01:16] some certain things begin to be tangled
[1:01:18] up and so forth and I said well wouldn't
[1:01:21] you like to return wouldn't you like to
[1:01:23] come back to him he said well you know
[1:01:25] he said I just got he said there's some
[1:01:27] things right now I got to take care of
[1:01:29] and you know about that time just the
[1:01:31] spirit of grace moving in I looked
[1:01:33] across the tables we sit there in that
[1:01:35] cafeteria
[1:01:36] I said sir there's nothing you could do
[1:01:38] to make yourself acceptable unto God
[1:01:42] I said you're looking at things in your
[1:01:44] life but it seems like is bound with
[1:01:46] this and I gotta get this right and I
[1:01:48] gotta get that right I said if you could
[1:01:50] get it right you wouldn't me the Lord
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ you wouldn't need his power
[1:01:56] but I'm telling you right now I said the
[1:01:59] one that I represent
[1:02:00] I said he's here right now he can
[1:02:03] release you from every Dominion that's
[1:02:05] about your life I tell you the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost come we begin to speak that of
[1:02:11] redemption brother the Spirit of God
[1:02:13] moved right down in that cafeteria and
[1:02:16] that man began to weep and he said I
[1:02:18] said you're ready right now he said I'm
[1:02:20] ready I'm ready
[1:02:24] you know the word delivered by the
[1:02:27] spirit got his eyes off himself and put
[1:02:33] it on the atonement I've just said as
[1:02:36] plain as I know how if my eyes are on me
[1:02:39] boy I'm in trouble
[1:02:41] if your eyes are on you you're in
[1:02:44] trouble
[1:02:45] that's why if the eyes can ever and
[1:02:48] they're placed on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:50] brother let me tell you keep your eyes
[1:02:53] on Jesus I hope I can get to where I
[1:02:58] want to get to you know Jesus here he
[1:03:06] would express this through through Paul
[1:03:09] where Paul you know what speak in
[1:03:11] Hebrews 12 and Paul would speak
[1:03:14] wherefore we receiving in verse 28
[1:03:17] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:03:19] moved you remember Paul has went through
[1:03:23] in this chapter and he's laid out
[1:03:25] there's a difference you and I have not
[1:03:27] been called to mount Sonia that was law
[1:03:32] bondage come on now condemnation the law
[1:03:37] pointed out the transgression all the
[1:03:40] law did was make us aware we need
[1:03:44] somebody greater to come and deliver us
[1:03:47] from the law not somebody who strips the
[1:03:52] long way and said bellowing no-account
[1:03:54] we need the law giver himself that he
[1:03:59] himself the very nature the very life
[1:04:02] that he would come and write that law by
[1:04:05] his nature upon our hearts
[1:04:10] and Paul is establishing this in Hebrews
[1:04:13] 12 that you and I are not called to that
[1:04:16] we are called to Mount Zion we are
[1:04:19] called to that of in company of an
[1:04:21] innumerable amount of angels we are
[1:04:24] called to that of the Church of the
[1:04:26] firstborn that Mount Zion which is a
[1:04:29] heavenly Jerusalem
[1:04:30] do you realize what Zion is Zion is the
[1:04:34] stronghold that David took first before
[1:04:35] taking Jerusalem Zion is also called
[1:04:39] Jerusalem and you realize that even
[1:04:41] right now the manifestation of that life
[1:04:44] within you and I its announcement to
[1:04:46] hell in this hour that he's coming into
[1:04:49] power he had taken Zion brother he's
[1:04:54] going to take Jerusalem this gospel is
[1:04:58] fixed and deterred from the Gentiles to
[1:05:00] the Jews
[1:05:04] Oh glory we receive a kingdom which
[1:05:08] cannot be moved let us have grace
[1:05:10] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:05:16] reverence and godly fear so this grace
[1:05:22] being received it also is grace how we
[1:05:26] receive a kingdom and that kingdom it's
[1:05:29] accompanied with grace not disgrace it
[1:05:34] brings about the desire to serve Him
[1:05:38] reverently it's within our life that we
[1:05:42] want to please him he's like a person
[1:05:48] said well you know I got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:49] and nothing bothers me and just as the
[1:05:51] Prophet said you better go back to the
[1:05:53] altar because you didn't get it hey man
[1:05:56] when you have it you've got a life
[1:05:58] that's living on the inside brother and
[1:06:00] the very that brother Manny that says
[1:06:02] and it's true you know even the very
[1:06:04] thought of sin will haunt you is that
[1:06:10] right you see we're not talking about an
[1:06:13] idea we're talking about the person of
[1:06:16] Jesus Christ
[1:06:17] this is why Paul would pick it up here
[1:06:19] and for in Romans 14:17
[1:06:21] for the kingdom of God is not meat and
[1:06:24] drink
[1:06:26] but righteousness and peace and joy in
[1:06:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:32] Paul there's a lot with you dinner with
[1:06:35] that but I just want to make this lay
[1:06:36] that down its righteousness peace and
[1:06:38] joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:06:41] first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom
[1:06:45] of God is not in word but in power
[1:06:51] y'all his power Paul said our gospel
[1:06:55] come not in word only but with power and
[1:06:59] demonstration now remember here's the
[1:07:03] Lord Jesus has asked the question in
[1:07:05] Matthew 22 29 you know here well here
[1:07:08] was one you know one who had you know
[1:07:10] it's had seven husbands and whose wife
[1:07:12] was she be in the resurrection and jesus
[1:07:14] answered him and said you do err not
[1:07:16] knowing the Scriptures they didn't know
[1:07:20] the scriptures yet they knew but they
[1:07:22] didn't know him nor the power of God so
[1:07:30] you see it even shows you and I that
[1:07:33] even even before the coming of the Holy
[1:07:36] Ghost listen we see it in the Old
[1:07:38] Testament the power of God was already
[1:07:41] there moving upon the children of God
[1:07:43] are you with me we can look at Zechariah
[1:07:46] John Elizabeth on and on but even all
[1:07:49] the way down in through the Old
[1:07:50] Testament it was the Spirit of God hey
[1:07:52] let's look at this look at Simeon who
[1:07:54] was it that called Simeon then you're
[1:07:57] not gonna die until you have seen the
[1:07:59] Lord's Christ you see here was a
[1:08:02] scripture that Simeon had been looking
[1:08:05] for that it would be fulfilled and the
[1:08:08] Holy Ghost came to him the Bible says
[1:08:10] and revealed this unto him and when it
[1:08:13] revealed it unto him brother what he had
[1:08:16] been looking for now became a
[1:08:18] present-day expectation in his life or
[1:08:22] what was a promise now Simeon could say
[1:08:25] I am going to see that promise fulfilled
[1:08:28] in my life I wonder how many down days
[1:08:33] Simeon had no doubt he had some down
[1:08:35] days but brother he had a promise he
[1:08:39] could come back to and rehearse that
[1:08:41] promise even to himself
[1:08:44] come on now you talk to yourself and you
[1:08:46] say a lot of stuff you shouldn't say to
[1:08:48] yourself come on now a lot of things go
[1:08:56] I can't believe you did this or I can't
[1:08:58] believe you said this I can't how about
[1:08:59] how about taking the promise that is
[1:09:01] given to you and then recite that
[1:09:04] promise let that promise be proclaimed
[1:09:06] the Bible said let the redeemed say so
[1:09:22] just had a little father my dad but I'm
[1:09:24] going mark chapter nine verse one here
[1:09:31] jesus said unto them verily I say unto
[1:09:33] you that there be some of them that
[1:09:36] stand here which shall not taste of
[1:09:39] death till they see the kingdom of God
[1:09:42] come with power now remember you realize
[1:09:49] not just speaking of where the coming
[1:09:52] would be at the setting up in that of
[1:09:56] the millennium and then carrying on in
[1:09:58] to the future home but he is speaking
[1:10:00] here that before that millennium can
[1:10:03] ever come remember the Millennium is the
[1:10:05] honeymoon right so then there has to be
[1:10:08] the kingdom of God must come in power
[1:10:10] first of all within the hearts of his
[1:10:14] redeemed children
[1:10:17] so here we understand you know the fact
[1:10:19] like the Bible says that from this right
[1:10:21] here there were many who went aside and
[1:10:23] started to say things about John well
[1:10:25] John's not gonna you know John's gonna
[1:10:27] live too you know to see his coming and
[1:10:29] there begin to be a saying but Jesus was
[1:10:31] talking about his coming but he's
[1:10:33] talking about the coming of the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost
[1:10:37] remember the disciples and we looked at
[1:10:40] this here
[1:10:41] the disciples were even looking when
[1:10:43] they asked the Lord Jesus in acts 1 will
[1:10:47] you at this time restore the kingdom
[1:10:48] unto Israel they were asking as we said
[1:10:52] a millennial question will you do it at
[1:10:55] this time but you see Jesus let her know
[1:10:59] it's not for you to know not not not for
[1:11:02] you to know the times and the seasons
[1:11:05] there but but he let him know that that
[1:11:08] it is that he had the father have put
[1:11:10] this in his own power but he let them
[1:11:12] know you shall receive power after the
[1:11:16] Holy Ghost has come upon you is that
[1:11:19] right so remember they were looking at
[1:11:21] the Lord Jesus as one who would have an
[1:11:24] earthly Kingdom
[1:11:27] but it was a spiritual Kingdom it was a
[1:11:31] spiritual Kingdom it would lead to that
[1:11:35] of a natural let's look at this in
[1:11:36] Revelations 1 verse 3 oh my in
[1:11:41] revelations 1 verse 3 blessed is he that
[1:11:45] readeth and they that hear the words of
[1:11:47] this prophecy and keep those things
[1:11:48] which are written therein for the time
[1:11:50] is at hand John to the seven churches
[1:11:53] which are in Asia great unto you and
[1:11:56] peace from him which is and which was
[1:11:59] and which is to come and from the seven
[1:12:02] spirits which are before his throne and
[1:12:06] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[1:12:09] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:12:12] Dead and the Prince of the kings of the
[1:12:15] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[1:12:19] us from our sins in his own blood
[1:12:27] hmm he loosed us completely with his own
[1:12:33] blood the life that was within that
[1:12:36] blood noticed that blood it had to be a
[1:12:39] perfect blood it could not be a blood of
[1:12:43] a sinful man this is why God came down
[1:12:46] and he created a virgin born body that
[1:12:51] he might come and redeem you and by shed
[1:12:54] the blood the price for you and I that
[1:12:58] we might come back to him it had to be a
[1:13:01] perfect blood and the life that was
[1:13:05] within that blood now coming upon the
[1:13:08] worshiper and bringing the worshiper
[1:13:11] into that blood cell brother it makes
[1:13:14] you and I free let me just say it like
[1:13:20] this a person could have the desire in
[1:13:22] their heart and never commit it but
[1:13:25] they're still guilty but when the desire
[1:13:28] has been removed that is loosening that
[1:13:33] is washing that is a separation you
[1:13:38] understand
[1:13:40] I don't want to go so much you know it
[1:13:44] can have a pool there can be pools here
[1:13:46] but brother when there is something on
[1:13:48] the inside that says I don't want to go
[1:13:51] that way
[1:13:52] that's not my desire rather there's been
[1:13:55] a change
[1:13:56] come on the inside and let me tell you
[1:13:58] something to change on the inside will
[1:14:01] lead this body to a change hallelujah
[1:14:06] it'll lead it there to such a change to
[1:14:09] where when we walk in the Millennium
[1:14:11] Satan is bound with the chain of
[1:14:14] circumstance Alleluia and that has
[1:14:21] already entered in our lives through him
[1:14:24] by the new birth in that of the soul his
[1:14:27] power is broken amen the sin that once
[1:14:32] ruled us we now rule it and one time we
[1:14:39] were beneath it but now through him by
[1:14:41] the grace of God we have been lifted
[1:14:44] above it Oh glory be to God in the
[1:14:50] highest and washed us from our sins in
[1:14:55] his own blood boy I want to preach so
[1:15:01] many other things right now but he'll
[1:15:04] have to wait and he has made us kings
[1:15:07] and priests unto God his father to him
[1:15:12] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:15] I want you to notice a part in the
[1:15:17] scripture
[1:15:19] he hath made us Lutheran picks that up
[1:15:25] and he says there are certain truths
[1:15:27] that need to be emphasized and he said
[1:15:32] this is one of them he hath made us we
[1:15:39] could not make ourselves but he hath
[1:15:45] made us he is our justification
[1:15:48] 1st Corinthians 1:30 he is our
[1:15:51] sanctification amen and there first and
[1:15:55] there in Colossians 3 he is our life
[1:15:59] right so now to see here we are king
[1:16:04] spiritual Kings well when we are going
[1:16:06] to be Kings upon the earth with him when
[1:16:09] he sits on his throne but now are we
[1:16:12] spiritual kings and we reign over a
[1:16:15] spiritual Kingdom
[1:16:19] we are are at war there's a war that's
[1:16:25] going on a man as Paul said we wrestle
[1:16:29] not with flesh and blood but with
[1:16:31] principalities against spiritual
[1:16:34] wickedness rulers in high places I want
[1:16:38] you to understand this right here that
[1:16:40] those powers and rulers that we are
[1:16:43] wrestling against brother they can
[1:16:45] outmaneuver us as far as our flesh but
[1:16:49] when we have been born of the Spirit of
[1:16:51] God we have within us the very God who
[1:16:55] even created the devil they men the very
[1:17:00] God who created all of the angels where
[1:17:04] in some of those who are now demons they
[1:17:08] failed that God inside of you and I is
[1:17:12] the very one who created all of them
[1:17:16] they're known as fallen angels known as
[1:17:19] demon spirits and brother to think that
[1:17:22] the Lord Jesus Christ when he rose the
[1:17:24] Bible said he triumphed over every
[1:17:27] principality over every power brother he
[1:17:31] made a way back there into the throne of
[1:17:34] glory back to the me tutorial see and he
[1:17:37] sent back the Holy Ghost into the church
[1:17:40] and he said the works that I do shall
[1:17:42] you do also our King is seated in power
[1:17:53] and they just say it like this when the
[1:17:57] Bible says in he Ephesians 6 let me drop
[1:18:00] this because it'd be a few weeks for our
[1:18:01] speak on a Thursday night
[1:18:02] I've got a few but let me just drop this
[1:18:05] you realize the Bible says we wrestle
[1:18:07] not
[1:18:09] is that right I got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:13] nothing bothers me well then you didn't
[1:18:17] get it the Bible says we wrestle not
[1:18:23] stand up for a minute I would you
[1:18:27] exactly up here but it would get carried
[1:18:28] away now it's just standing right here
[1:18:31] there ain't no wrestling going on right
[1:18:34] but if I take him like this and I'll get
[1:18:37] my arms around him and start grappling
[1:18:39] with him brother there's some wrestling
[1:18:41] going on sorry about getting you wet
[1:18:43] there's some wrestling going on
[1:18:46] you see we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:18:49] blood against principalities against
[1:18:54] spiritual wickedness but this is where
[1:18:57] the Prophet would speak to us like this
[1:18:59] he said there's got to be a hidden power
[1:19:02] on the inside that when the devil tries
[1:19:05] to get a toehold you know what a toehold
[1:19:08] is it's where the enemy wants to get you
[1:19:10] in a submission technique to where you
[1:19:12] tap out and say you got me there's got
[1:19:15] to be a hidden power on the inside and
[1:19:19] that hidden power is not our strength
[1:19:21] that hidden power is the strength of the
[1:19:24] Holy Ghost in the believer and God as we
[1:19:30] walk within this world we are constantly
[1:19:33] there is a wrestling that is going on
[1:19:36] it's not our desire there's a wrestling
[1:19:39] that's going on but greater is he that
[1:19:41] is in you a hidden power
[1:19:53] some y'all look at me strange tonight
[1:19:57] but you know what I'm talking about you
[1:20:01] can almost get everything in your mind
[1:20:03] the devil can present so many things to
[1:20:06] you in your mind and in your mind you
[1:20:10] don't even look fit but all the sudden
[1:20:14] there's a hidden power a hidden power
[1:20:19] that's right there
[1:20:20] brother he ain't in pretty shorts he
[1:20:22] ain't all decorated out but brother this
[1:20:24] one is in power in your life and I'm
[1:20:27] telling you that kingdom cannot be
[1:20:30] overthrown I don't care how low you feel
[1:20:34] sometimes the King of glory is reigning
[1:20:38] in your life the devil can say all he
[1:20:43] wants to say he can try everything but
[1:20:46] there's a hidden power and you know what
[1:20:48] God will allow the tests the trials the
[1:20:51] wrestling matches want just to show his
[1:20:54] glory
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:21:02] it's like a guy you know going to a
[1:21:05] boxing match who you plan on fight
[1:21:06] fighting
[1:21:06] I'm planning to find nobody you gotta
[1:21:12] fight this guy in the ring oh no no I
[1:21:14] just come out here to look at the part I
[1:21:15] look real good oh you got him out here
[1:21:18] to fight and you became a Christian God
[1:21:24] made a pool upon your life and we've not
[1:21:27] entered a picnic
[1:21:31] we're in a battleground a battlefield
[1:21:36] some days you got a battle every inch of
[1:21:39] the way
[1:21:41] sometimes there's weeks
[1:21:43] you got a battle every inch of the way
[1:21:46] but I'm asking you who is it in you that
[1:21:50] keeps you born and who is it in you that
[1:21:53] keeps you expecting and looking its
[1:21:56] Christ in you I'm afraid of a man or a
[1:22:05] person that says well I did this and I
[1:22:07] did that and I did this let me tell you
[1:22:09] something any strategy that we have it's
[1:22:11] because of the grace of God that has
[1:22:13] made known to us something in our lives
[1:22:18] you say brother Simon you're putting
[1:22:21] that awful high on Christ I can't put
[1:22:22] that high like that he already ascended
[1:22:24] on high he's the one like David said he
[1:22:29] teaches my hands to war
[1:22:34] well glory hallelujah for by one man's
[1:22:40] look how Paul would bring this
[1:22:42] enrollments for by one man's offense
[1:22:45] Romans 5:17 death reigned by one much
[1:22:50] more they which receive abundance of
[1:22:54] grace and of the gift of righteousness
[1:22:57] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[1:23:04] let me just say to you like this even
[1:23:07] for a person that could even come to
[1:23:10] receive the Lord Jesus Christ as their
[1:23:13] Lord and Savior they've got access to
[1:23:14] power are you with me they've got access
[1:23:18] to power it's not like well I just
[1:23:20] received the Lord Jesus Christ brother
[1:23:22] you've got to realize you've been
[1:23:23] justified if you don't recognize you've
[1:23:27] been justified
[1:23:28] you can never ascend to where you need
[1:23:31] to be this is why Paul through the book
[1:23:34] of Romans Paul establishes it in the
[1:23:37] book of Romans that it is all in Jesus
[1:23:41] Christ
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:46] amen you can never get anywhere by us
[1:23:51] pointing ourselves to ourselves well
[1:23:57] we're trying to get somewhere amen the
[1:24:02] Bible tells us here let me just kind of
[1:24:04] move through some of this in second
[1:24:07] Corinthians 13:4 let me just skip
[1:24:08] through some of these here for though he
[1:24:10] was crucified through weakness yet he
[1:24:14] liveth by the power of God
[1:24:17] we also are weak in him but we shall
[1:24:22] live with him by the power of God toward
[1:24:26] you Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is
[1:24:30] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:24:33] all that we could ask or think
[1:24:37] I'll just say Lord help me not to limit
[1:24:42] you in my asking and my thinking help me
[1:24:47] Lord whether there's nothing that's
[1:24:52] off-limits with God hey man he wants us
[1:24:56] to ask him bro drama tell us over and
[1:24:58] over he said God wants us to ask him for
[1:25:01] big things
[1:25:02] I don't know how many of you were still
[1:25:07] in here when brother Joe sprint was
[1:25:10] hearing him robber one went through when
[1:25:12] we went to go to that eat that meal
[1:25:15] after uh Saturday morning service her
[1:25:18] brother humors
[1:25:18] well Joe's friend told the story and
[1:25:22] here it was here was a man who was a
[1:25:24] golfer you know here he was he was at a
[1:25:27] golf club and he golfed with this king
[1:25:29] those kings of one of those countries

[1:25:47] said well you know he said I I like golf
[1:25:49] clubs and things like that and he said
[1:25:51] okay he said you know he said let that
[1:25:55] be fine you know so here what happens is
[1:25:58] is that there was some time that passed
[1:26:00] by there came a knock on the door and
[1:26:03] when the knock came on the door here
[1:26:06] what showed up here was a letter now the
[1:26:11] man himself was expecting like a golf
[1:26:14] club that would you know gold and it
[1:26:17] would have you know some name engraved
[1:26:19] on it but instead he didn't have a golf
[1:26:22] club like that but he had the deed to a
[1:26:25] golf club brother he had a whole resort
[1:26:28] and the whole thing about it is is that
[1:26:31] though he only asked for a golf club and
[1:26:34] that was his thinking it shows that a
[1:26:37] king doesn't think like that but a king
[1:26:40] gives you according to how he thinks
[1:26:44] let this mind be in you that was in
[1:26:48] Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery
[1:26:51] to be equal with God ask God for big
[1:26:55] things
[1:26:57] amen expect big things I say I believe
[1:27:02] that with all my heart I ask God lot let
[1:27:05] us be filled with the Holy Ghost let
[1:27:08] there be a refilling of the Spirit of
[1:27:11] God you said this is Thursday he's gone
[1:27:13] of Sunday got a Monday got a Tuesday got
[1:27:16] a Wednesday he's God asking for big
[1:27:22] things hallelujah amen we're not talking
[1:27:29] to somebody else this is our father
[1:27:33] jesus said if we being evil know how to
[1:27:36] give good gifts
[1:27:37] how much more Heavenly Father glory be
[1:27:44] to God in the house
[1:27:47] he's able to look at that he's able to
[1:27:51] do abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:27:54] think according to the power that
[1:27:58] worketh in us unto Him be glory in the
[1:28:02] church black Christ Jesus through all
[1:28:05] ages world without end amen the Bible
[1:28:11] tells the cedar humming just move ahead
[1:28:13] here real quick it says in Revelations 5
[1:28:17] speaking of the hour even that we're
[1:28:20] living in
[1:28:22] they're worthy is the lamb that was
[1:28:26] slain has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:28:30] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[1:28:32] and people and nation and has made us
[1:28:37] unto our God kings and priests and we
[1:28:41] shall reign on the earth now if you look
[1:28:48] over in revelations 15 3 this is talking
[1:28:50] about these are talking about the
[1:28:52] tribulation Saints that will stand there
[1:28:54] in Revelations 15 3 but the Bible says
[1:28:59] it like this and I saw as it were a sea
[1:29:02] of glass mingled with fire and them that
[1:29:07] had gotten the victory over the Beast
[1:29:09] and over his image and over his mark and
[1:29:11] over the number of his name stand on the
[1:29:14] sea of glass having the harps of God and
[1:29:17] they sing the song of Moses the servant
[1:29:21] of God and the song of the lamb saying
[1:29:24] great and marvellous are thy works Lord
[1:29:28] God Almighty just and true are thy ways
[1:29:33] thou king of saints who shall not fear
[1:29:37] thee O Lord and glorify thy name
[1:29:41] you see they come to that revelation
[1:29:43] that we are partakers of now the name of
[1:29:48] the Lord Jesus Christ partakers of that
[1:29:51] life a point I want to draw out of there
[1:29:55] thou king of saints think about it he
[1:30:01] hath made us Saints amen
[1:30:06] sanctified ones one that have been set
[1:30:09] apart by him ones that he has redeemed
[1:30:13] ones that he has brought to himself man
[1:30:22] he is our King right now can you say
[1:30:24] amen to that
[1:30:25] amen he will come forth in power and
[1:30:28] glory he will take his authority to
[1:30:30] reign as a king he is coming king of the
[1:30:32] earth of course that does not say he has
[1:30:35] not now King for he is our King king of
[1:30:38] the Saints right now in a spiritual
[1:30:41] Kingdom
[1:30:43] you ever wonder why sometimes you get
[1:30:46] people at work and other places and you
[1:30:50] wonder why they look at you or act
[1:30:53] towards you in a certain way now if
[1:30:57] you're the one that's causing it don't
[1:30:59] you be calling that the Holy Ghost doing
[1:31:00] it in you are you with me I mean you
[1:31:05] can't be a stick in the mud and I'll
[1:31:06] tell you what the devil's all matter no
[1:31:08] that's you being a stick in the mud
[1:31:09] don't you big green don't you be calling
[1:31:12] the Holy Ghost being a stick in the mud
[1:31:13] the Bible said he that hath friends must
[1:31:16] show himself friendly with brother
[1:31:22] Samuel I can't be friendly the Bible
[1:31:24] tells us in the book of Hebrews I
[1:31:26] believe it is it says that doing well
[1:31:28] heaping coals of fire upon their head
[1:31:32] come on now hey man you've got a
[1:31:35] strength within you that raises you
[1:31:38] above the get even oh yeah the devil can
[1:31:42] come at your flesh and say get even with
[1:31:44] him but you know that thought can go
[1:31:46] through it'll sound just like your voice
[1:31:48] it'll go through but there's a king on
[1:31:50] the inside that raises the plate Aaron
[1:31:52] says no vengeance is mine sayeth the
[1:31:55] Lord I will repent aren't you glad
[1:32:01] there's one more pound on the inside and
[1:32:04] aren't you glad that even when you have
[1:32:07] slipped up there's one who convicts you
[1:32:09] and there's one who manifests to you and
[1:32:13] say I'm gonna overcome through you I'll
[1:32:16] manifest my overcoming power through
[1:32:18] your life and you know what it's
[1:32:20] something beyond our intellect that just
[1:32:23] simply says so be it more I believe it
[1:32:28] you with me
[1:32:31] you watch him working in you what you
[1:32:37] never dreamed possible
[1:32:38] Oh my wish I could keep you here all
[1:32:47] night but I'm not going to just part of
[1:32:50] it
[1:32:55] let me just skip down here
[1:32:57] let me just skip down let me just skip
[1:33:00] to this right here
[1:33:03] Jesus let us know remember even in
[1:33:06] Matthew 6 of how more to pray thy
[1:33:09] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[1:33:13] even as it is in heaven
[1:33:15] it's praying that Kingdom Come
[1:33:21] and Jesus would say in that prayer for
[1:33:23] us as we recognize I don't let's just
[1:33:27] turn there I got to read this part right
[1:33:29] here cuz I my memories not real good on
[1:33:30] that one right it's alright but I just I
[1:33:33] just want to read it
[1:33:39] sometimes you know it is when you you
[1:33:41] preaching I wish my memory was as it was
[1:33:43] when I was praying in meditation
[1:33:49] well now let me find words that here
[1:33:53] Matthew six okay here it is verse ten or
[1:33:58] no verse nine after this manner
[1:34:00] therefore pray ye our Father which art
[1:34:02] in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:34:03] that kingdom come that will be done in
[1:34:06] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:34:09] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[1:34:12] debts as we forgive our debtors and lead
[1:34:15] us not into temptation but deliver us
[1:34:19] from evil for thine is the kingdom and
[1:34:23] the power and the glory forever amen
[1:34:27] amen it's to ascribe to him who he is
[1:34:34] thine is the kingdom the power and the
[1:34:37] glory no matter what I'm facing fine is
[1:34:41] the kingdom then is the power dying is
[1:34:45] the glory this is why Jesus could say
[1:34:50] seek ye the kingdom of God now I know
[1:34:53] many times we look at things like this
[1:34:54] and would say well praise God I've
[1:34:56] already made it but in Jesus didn't put
[1:34:59] it that way
[1:34:59] he didn't say once you're into the
[1:35:02] kingdom of God where you can just sit
[1:35:03] out but he says keep seeking keep asking
[1:35:09] for the kingdom of God brother Branham
[1:35:11] picks it up in the message desperation
[1:35:13] he says you keep applying that token and
[1:35:17] you keep seeking and pressing into the
[1:35:21] kingdom you know there's not a promise
[1:35:24] that comes easy every promise itself
[1:35:27] that God makes known to you the devil is
[1:35:30] going to be there to try to contest it
[1:35:33] he's there too trying to contest it but
[1:35:35] brother this is where that you have to
[1:35:37] come back to and you remember there that
[1:35:40] he is your propitiation he wants to try
[1:35:44] to pour bring up your past I don't care
[1:35:47] if it's your past from just an hour and
[1:35:48] a half ago if you have repented and put
[1:35:51] that under the blood then there is no
[1:35:53] pass for him to put in your face
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:36:00] hallelujah that's the strength of the
[1:36:03] blood of Jesus Christ you don't got to
[1:36:07] crawl on your hands and knees amen you
[1:36:10] just submit your heart to God and all
[1:36:17] these things will be added to you fear
[1:36:22] not little flock for it your father's
[1:36:23] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:36:27] no wonder Paul could say I'm ending here
[1:36:32] don't nobody keep track of how many
[1:36:34] times I said that now no Aaron you
[1:36:39] better not be doing that either buddy
[1:36:43] notice what Paul says
[1:36:48] he says not as though I had already
[1:36:51] attained Philippians 3:12 either we're
[1:36:54] already perfect I follow after if that
[1:36:59] I'm a upper hand that for which also I'm
[1:37:01] apprehended of Christ Jesus rather and I
[1:37:05] count not myself to have apprehended but
[1:37:08] this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:37:11] things which are behind and reaching
[1:37:13] forth unto those things which are before
[1:37:22] don't let the devil keep you in the past
[1:37:26] you let your past be in the past come on
[1:37:31] now let the black put it in the past
[1:37:34] Amen forgetting those things which are
[1:37:37] behind me I gotta say this as it comes
[1:37:41] to me there was a little woman a little
[1:37:43] little woman here she was in the south
[1:37:45] and you know here she was she brought
[1:37:48] general robert e lee she said said
[1:37:50] general said here she's this true story
[1:37:52] generously said here she said i want you
[1:37:54] to come by this tree he's sitting there
[1:37:56] looking at this tree and she goes
[1:37:58] through how i heard you know her husband
[1:38:00] and different ones were killed and all
[1:38:02] this stuff happened and everything like
[1:38:03] that and this one did this to her and
[1:38:05] this one did that and this tree was a
[1:38:07] reminder
[1:38:09] she brought generally to see this
[1:38:12] she said what should I do cut it down
[1:38:16] and burn it don't keep going back to
[1:38:21] that tree and rehashing everything cut
[1:38:24] it down and Burnett forgetting those
[1:38:30] things which are behind me
[1:38:39] gloria i press toward the mark for the
[1:38:44] prize of the high calling of God in
[1:38:46] Christ Jesus let me give you another one
[1:38:49] before we parachute out of here lap four
[1:38:53] in Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we also
[1:38:56] are compassed about with so great a
[1:38:58] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:39:01] every weight and the sin which doth so
[1:39:06] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:39:09] patience the race that is set before us
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] Paul is talking to some sons and
[1:39:18] daughters of God who have access to be
[1:39:22] able to lay aside weights things that
[1:39:26] are slowing you down
[1:39:27] things that are hindering you let us lay
[1:39:30] aside every weight
[1:39:35] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[1:39:40] surround us entrap us let us lay it
[1:39:44] aside
[1:39:45] you know how oh how can you say that how
[1:39:47] can you point to us and say you lay it
[1:39:50] aside here's the key verse 2 looking
[1:39:53] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:39:58] our faith
[1:40:01] that's how looking unto Jesus he is our
[1:40:07] strength
[1:40:08] he is the kingdom hey man the kingdom
[1:40:14] within us looking unto Jesus let us look
[1:40:21] to him
[1:40:24] let us stand a man upon his promises of
[1:40:28] the standards tonight
[1:40:35] as the musicians would come and I want
[1:40:37] to sing that song it's already done it's
[1:40:41] already done the battle is over it's
[1:40:44] already done the battle has already been
[1:40:48] won
[1:40:53] you know
[1:40:55] God is faithful in our lives
[1:41:02] he comes in his sets he sets us free he
[1:41:07] loosens us by his own blood
[1:41:12] places himself on the inside there's a
[1:41:16] desire on the inside to live pleasing to
[1:41:20] him there's things about your life about
[1:41:25] my life no matter how much you wanted to
[1:41:28] stop you couldn't stop but then he came
[1:41:37] now I want you to think about this and
[1:41:39] just meditate on this when Saul was
[1:41:44] anointed king of Israel everybody knew
[1:41:47] it when David was anointed it was a
[1:41:51] secret anointing nobody knew when David
[1:41:56] got anointed except his own family you
[1:42:01] with me
[1:42:01] but it became manifest in his life that
[1:42:05] even others could say he's the king he's
[1:42:11] the king something changed
[1:42:16] daven never went around and said hey I'm
[1:42:18] the king now he didn't have to say I'm
[1:42:20] the king now the kingdom have moved into
[1:42:25] his life there was a change that when
[1:42:30] you look at your life in my life
[1:42:32] you can't explain a reality that takes
[1:42:35] place that where Christ is seated on the
[1:42:39] throne of our heart it's no longer you
[1:42:42] know all I have to do this I've got to
[1:42:45] do this right it's I no longer want to
[1:42:49] do that at all I want to live for him my
[1:42:54] desire is to please him
[1:42:58] change has taken place a paradigm of
[1:43:02] birth has taken place and then to think
[1:43:06] now think of this here that same God
[1:43:09] living on the inside of you and I he
[1:43:12] have made us kings and priests and to
[1:43:16] think that from within our lives
[1:43:18] now that the Holy Spirit here we are
[1:43:21] we're tied in there to the medet Oriole
[1:43:24] seat he already interceded for you and I
[1:43:27] that that life that we could be received
[1:43:30] that you and I can even receive eternal
[1:43:33] life are you with me he already made a
[1:43:36] way but now that same Holy Spirit within
[1:43:39] you and I here we are we're tied into
[1:43:44] that representation
[1:43:47] we're tied in to his life under that
[1:43:50] blood cell and he's there to intercede
[1:43:54] on our behalf to think about it
[1:44:00] the Bible says in first John 2:1 we have
[1:44:04] an advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[1:44:07] the righteous we have one that when we
[1:44:11] can go before the throne brother David
[1:44:12] we can say Lord Jesus forgive me and
[1:44:15] there's one who's standing there on our
[1:44:18] behalf and said Father forgive them they
[1:44:20] didn't mean to do that why because the
[1:44:23] inside has changed amen the nature's not
[1:44:28] the same anymore there's one who's
[1:44:30] standing there on the inside there's a
[1:44:33] blood that's representing you and I know
[1:44:37] we wrestle you might have come out of a
[1:44:41] wrestling match today let me just tell
[1:44:43] you something I know I said I was
[1:44:45] quitting sometimes you you take times
[1:44:48] and you feel like why in the world am I
[1:44:50] going through this wrestling right now
[1:44:52] why am I going through this mind battle
[1:44:55] right now why is just coming at me right
[1:44:57] now I'll tell you why because Satan
[1:44:59] knows there's an oncoming blessing
[1:45:03] that's why Satan wants to get you
[1:45:05] discouraged he wants to try to give that
[1:45:08] battle and try to bring fear my brother
[1:45:10] you have not been made to be subject to
[1:45:13] fear you weren't delivered by fear are
[1:45:17] you hearing me tonight you weren't
[1:45:19] brought to the Lord by fear

[1:45:28] God keeping you and I hallelujah we're
[1:45:34] standing there we're standing there
[1:45:37] though that wrestling wrestling there's
[1:45:42] a hidden power
[1:45:43] there's something that you know greater
[1:45:46] is he that is in you than he that's in
[1:45:50] the world
[1:45:55] drawing me to God hallelu Oh blessed be

[1:52:29] what do you want what do you want he
[1:52:32] said I want them to perform this surgery
[1:52:34] this week so they agreed and prayed now
[1:52:39] they wanted to call him there on Monday
[1:52:40] and Monday they were persistent about
[1:52:42] sending him home but there came a call
[1:52:45] through and they reversed that decision
[1:52:47] and said we're going to do the surgery
[1:52:50] on Wednesday amen God is in control
[1:53:00] Oh God
[1:53:06] I'll tell you you know brother Tom was
[1:53:09] standing there for the time you know
[1:53:10] there's a Donner role but the Tom said
[1:53:12] you know he said the whole thing he said
[1:53:13] I told him you got to start speaking

[1:53:24] children
[1:53:25] remember the sons and daughters of God
[1:53:27] it's time to claim what belongs to us

[1:53:36] went up there and we get up there early
[1:53:38] on on Wednesday morning just went up
[1:53:39] there just to pray you know with the
[1:53:41] sister and the report had come back out
[1:53:44] of how that God moved down on the scene
[1:53:48] and how that everything itself I don't
[1:53:52] let me have maybe I have it on a
[1:53:53] different part here on my phone of how
[1:53:55] that God moved right down there on the
[1:53:57] scene and they took off of that heart
[1:53:59] muscle they took off
[1:54:02] after two hours of surgery they took off
[1:54:06] about 34 grams off of her heart they
[1:54:10] scraped off that heartless and this
[1:54:13] morning she was setting up in the chair
[1:54:16] already now just for the critics enough
[1:54:26] that there'd be anybody here but I
[1:54:28] remind you of what the Prophet told us
[1:54:30] to God performs miracles through
[1:54:34] surgeries if still a miracle working God
[1:54:41] amen just two hours right after the
[1:54:44] surgery they pulled the tubes out for
[1:54:46] the breathing and here this morning she
[1:54:48] was setting up in the chair so let's
[1:54:49] just continue remember sister Melissa
[1:54:51] strolls remember her in prayer amen that
[1:54:54] God would just just continue to finish
[1:54:57] the work with a speedy recovery amen
