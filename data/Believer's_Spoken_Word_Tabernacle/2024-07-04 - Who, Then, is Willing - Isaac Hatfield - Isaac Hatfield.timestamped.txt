[35:10] palace is not for man but for the Lord

[35:35] because I have set my affection to the
[35:38] house of my God I have of mine own
[35:40] proper good of gold and silver which I
[35:43] have given to the house of my God over
[35:45] and above all that I prepared for the
[35:47] Holy House even 3,000 talents of gold of
[35:50] the gold of ofer and 7,000 talents of
[35:53] refined silver to Overlay the walls of

[36:02] made by the hands of artificers and who
[36:04] then is willing to consecrate his
[36:06] service this day onto the Lord then the
[36:09] chief of the fathers and princes of the
[36:11] tribes of Israel and the captains of
[36:13] thousands and of hundreds with the
[36:15] rulers of the king's work offered
[36:17] willingly and gave for the service of
[36:19] the house of God of gold 5,000 talents
[36:22] and 10,000 drams and a silver 10,000
[36:25] talents and a brass 18,000 Talent and

[36:33] them to The Treasure of the house of the
[36:35] Lord by the hand of jeel the ganite then
[36:38] the people rejoiced for that they
[36:40] offered willingly because with perfect
[36:42] heart they offered willingly to the Lord
[36:44] and David the king also rejoiced with
[36:46] great joy amen if we could just bow our
[36:49] heads for a word of prayer whatever need
[36:52] you have on your heart tonight just lift
[36:53] it up before the Lord I believe he's
[36:56] more than able father we come into your
[36:58] presence once again tonight Lord and we
[37:01] just lay everything at your feet father
[37:04] Lord every every ambition Lord every
[37:07] Lord everything of our own selves Lord
[37:09] every weight of the of the week father
[37:12] Lord we just want to lay it aside for a
[37:14] moment Lord and concentrate on you for
[37:16] Lord I believe you're greater Lord than
[37:19] anything that we're going through so we
[37:21] seek your face tonight Lord that that
[37:23] you would come on the scene once again
[37:25] and speak to the hearts of your children
[37:27] Lord Lord we lord as Lord your servant
[37:30] Lord we want to get out of the way
[37:32] father Lord that you might speak through
[37:34] our lips but father I pray Lord that
[37:36] everyone in the audience tonight would
[37:37] just step aside Lord that they might
[37:39] receive what you have for them Lord
[37:41] Jesus we commit this service in your
[37:43] hands we offer it to you in the name of
[37:45] Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your
[37:49] seats tonight if we just take a thought
[37:51] out of that as a text for a few moments
[37:54] we want to preach on who then is willing
[37:57] who then is willing and and as they're
[37:59] dedicating this Temple for
[38:02] Solomon um Solomon they're beginning to
[38:04] build this Temple and they make a place
[38:06] in the dedication of the temple for the
[38:09] people to offer willingly uh uh things
[38:12] of gold and things that they might offer
[38:14] towards the building of the Tabernacle
[38:16] so so there was a place given in in in
[38:19] this ceremony that people could make a
[38:22] willing offering and that wasn't just
[38:24] for the this Tabernacle but in the book
[38:26] of Exodus in the Tabernacle that was
[38:29] being built in the days of Moses it was
[38:31] also given the same the same uh uh
[38:34] window of opportunity in Exodus 35 it
[38:37] says take ye from among you an offering
[38:39] unto the Lord whosoever is of a willing
[38:41] heart let him bring it an offering of
[38:44] the Lord gold and silver and brass and
[38:46] so there was given an opportunity for
[38:48] the people to give and and it wasn't a
[38:51] demand but it was a just that whosoever
[38:54] is of a willing whosoever spirit makes
[38:56] them willing
[38:58] come and give an offering unto the Lord
[39:01] and and the Bible teaches us that he
[39:03] that he he that uh SWS sparingly shall
[39:06] reap sparingly and he that SWS
[39:08] bountifully shall reap bountifully and
[39:10] and the Bible says every man according
[39:12] as he purposeth in his heart so let him
[39:15] give not grudgingly or of necessity for
[39:18] God loveth a cheerful Giver am me and I
[39:20] believe that's why we're here tonight
[39:22] brother Aaron not because that we have
[39:23] to be here not I I I I trust that none
[39:26] of us have come here grudgingly or or
[39:28] just of necessity or just to fulfill a
[39:31] duty and and if you did then I'm glad
[39:34] that you're here but there there there
[39:35] can come from your heart a love for the
[39:38] Lord and that that'll get you into the
[39:40] house of God and it it may not always be
[39:42] easy sometimes it may take a lot of
[39:44] effort but there's something in your
[39:45] heart that when you could make an excuse
[39:47] to stay home yet you don't do it and you
[39:50] come to the house of God because there's
[39:51] something in your heart that's willing
[39:53] and hungers to be in the presence of God
[39:56] and even Brandon in the beginning of his
[39:58] ministry he he he he he was so against
[40:01] money in a way that even he wouldn't
[40:03] take up an offering many times in the
[40:05] meetings but he come to the place where
[40:07] he realized that this was something that
[40:09] God ordained that this was actually a
[40:11] part of worship to give the people an
[40:14] opportunity to make an offering
[40:16] willingly from their heart amen and and
[40:19] so they ask the question who then is
[40:21] willing who is ready who who is eager
[40:24] who is prepared to do something for the
[40:26] Lord and and as Christians the first
[40:28] thing I think we want to do when we're
[40:29] trying to find uh uh uh make a plan or
[40:33] make a decision uh we want to find out
[40:35] is the Lord willing amen and that's was
[40:37] instructed to us in scripture in the
[40:39] Book of James was was that life is but a
[40:42] vapor you know uh when we close out a
[40:45] service we might say Lord will and we'll
[40:47] see you on Sunday morning because we
[40:48] don't know what tomorrow holds we don't
[40:50] know what the the next day holds uh uh
[40:53] it's so fickle and we just you never
[40:56] know and even brother Brandon as he
[40:57] would plan meetings would would be
[40:59] careful to set a schedule uh out because
[41:02] he he didn't know that the angel of the
[41:03] Lord might direct him to go a certain
[41:05] way or or lead him to a different place
[41:07] and so he would say that if if the
[41:09] Lord's willing we'll do this and and
[41:11] we'll do
[41:12] that and and if it would happen that we
[41:15] couldn't do it then we'll just trust
[41:17] that the Lord wasn't willing for it to
[41:19] happen amen is that right as Believers
[41:21] that that we don't get all tore up when
[41:23] something doesn't go the way we thought
[41:25] it would because we have confidence that
[41:28] God's hand is leading our lives that
[41:30] he's in control of the universe that
[41:33] he's in control of Our Lives that all
[41:35] things work together for good amen to
[41:37] them that love God to them who are the
[41:40] called according to his purpose amen
[41:42] when God closes the door we don't get
[41:44] all tore up we say thank you Lord that
[41:46] you're in control of my life and you
[41:48] know what's better for me than I know
[41:50] and your thoughts are higher than my
[41:51] thoughts and your ways are higher than
[41:53] my ways and so I'll Trust You Lord
[41:55] Brother Brandon would even say that that
[41:57] uh I think it was it was pretty amazing
[41:59] he said if I knew that I was wrong and
[42:02] God had chose me to be wrong I would
[42:04] want to stay wrong because that I want
[42:06] to do his will I love him till I want
[42:08] his will to be done he said now that's a
[42:11] big statement but I hope you get it in
[42:12] the spirit I said it I want to do his
[42:14] will and he find out that his NOS are
[42:17] better than his yeses amen if he says no
[42:21] that that would be better than a yes if
[42:23] that was his will because that would
[42:25] that would be what his intention was for
[42:27] your life amen so we want his will but
[42:31] but we're thankful that brother Brandon
[42:32] would teach us that even if you ever get
[42:35] in his permissive will that God has a
[42:37] permissive will that he can even allow
[42:39] that to work out for his perfect will in
[42:41] your life and that we don't have to
[42:43] worry if we ever make a mistake if we
[42:45] ever do something wrong God is able to
[42:47] work it together for our good amen and
[42:50] allow his will to be accomplished in our
[42:52] life but but but you might have to pay
[42:54] for it it may be difficult like like
[42:57] when brother Brandon was in South Africa
[42:59] I think it's one of the best examples
[43:01] that he got mixed up with a bunch of
[43:03] preachers over there and and the Lord
[43:04] had given them a vision of what to do
[43:06] and I believe it was to stay in
[43:07] Johannesburg but but here these other
[43:10] preachers were wanting to follow a
[43:11] certain itenerary and and brother
[43:13] Brandon was all tore up about it and he
[43:16] said well you know God does have a
[43:18] permissive will and and those preachers
[43:20] jumped on that and said yeah ask him
[43:21] about that go ask the Lord about that
[43:23] permissive will and so brother brandom
[43:26] tore up but they decided to go that way
[43:28] and he said all right but we're in his
[43:29] permissive will and they they ran into
[43:31] all kinds of trouble and brother Brandon
[43:34] actually contracted in amoeba and was
[43:36] sick uh because it was the permissive
[43:38] will and and probably God blessed in
[43:41] those meetings probably there was
[43:43] healings that took place but I'm
[43:44] thankful that God has a perfect will and
[43:47] I don't believe that God just permitted
[43:49] us to gather together tonight but I
[43:51] believe God has ordained us to be here I
[43:53] believe it's God's will for us to be in
[43:55] the house of the Lord tonight I I
[43:57] believe God's ordained it I believe he's
[43:59] he he he's pre-planned it amen and and
[44:02] it's his desire amen I believe on on a
[44:05] on a Thursday night to come and dwell
[44:08] with his people and pour out his spirit
[44:10] in our
[44:11] midst oh but we want to know H how to
[44:13] find God's will Amen brother Paul I I
[44:16] think especially as young people and you
[44:18] come to those Crossroads of life you're
[44:19] wondering how do I find God's will for
[44:22] my life how do I know that I'm I'm in
[44:24] God's Will and brother BR said I thank
[44:27] that that one of the best ways to find
[44:29] out God's will is through prayer me and
[44:33] he said that him and his own personal
[44:36] life as a prophet God dealt with him
[44:38] through visions and so many times he
[44:40] would wait on a vision but he would say
[44:42] uh uh uh but but the one of the best
[44:44] ways that he knew to find God's will was
[44:46] through prayer he said just get neutral
[44:48] before the Lord and just and just let
[44:50] yourself be neutral and whatever you're
[44:52] seeking the Lord about you just commit
[44:54] it to the Lord in prayer and then you
[44:56] know that whichever way you begin to
[44:58] lean and you just begin to lean that way
[45:00] and you just trust it to the Lord and
[45:02] whatever way you begin to lean you trust
[45:04] that that's his will you know that
[45:06] you've done the best you can and that
[45:07] you're operating in the will of God and
[45:10] so you move forward and you say Lord I'm
[45:12] in your will and then he said you would
[45:13] check your motives and objectives and
[45:15] and as long as you don't have any
[45:17] selfish motives or or objectives because
[45:19] brother Brandon would say that even if
[45:21] it is the will of God and you have a
[45:23] selfish motive he said that's just the
[45:25] same as it not being his will
[45:27] so you but but if you ever get it all
[45:29] lined up then brother you know it's
[45:31] God's will you know you're operating in
[45:34] his will and you can move forward with
[45:36] confidence because that's the first
[45:38] thing we want to do tonight am mean
[45:40] coming into a meeting like this we want
[45:42] to know brother what what is God's will
[45:44] for my life what is God's will for this
[45:46] meeting and you want to find God's Will
[45:49] and so you begin to say Lord what what
[45:51] is your will and brother brandom in in
[45:53] the prayer lines many times people would
[45:54] come through and he would say have you
[45:56] prayed up
[45:57] do you believe it's God's will to heal
[45:59] you and they would say yes then okay
[46:01] there's nothing left to do but cast that
[46:02] thing off of you because he brother
[46:04] Brandon would begin to teach us
[46:06] something he said if you ever
[46:07] positionally Place yourselves in the
[46:09] will of God then it's over and me if you
[46:12] could ever that's a quote in great
[46:15] warrior David he said if we can
[46:16] positionally place ourselves in his will
[46:19] it's over because uh there was a couple
[46:21] one time that came to brother brandham
[46:24] and Billy Paul was uh told Brother
[46:26] brandham there's a couple here they've
[46:27] got a baby with a crippled leg and
[46:30] they're wanting you to pray for it and
[46:31] they believe that if you pray for it
[46:32] brother Shane that the baby would get
[46:34] healed and so they brought the baby to
[46:36] brother brandom and they said brother
[46:38] brandom we believe that if you pray for
[46:40] our baby that that once you do it's
[46:42] going to be healed and brother Brandon
[46:44] said do you require a vision and they
[46:46] said no we don't and so he laid his
[46:48] hands on the baby and prayed for it and
[46:51] they went their way and brother Brandon
[46:53] went his way and the next day they come
[46:54] back and said brother Brandon
[46:56] something's wrong the baby's leg hasn't
[46:58] come down yet something's wrong maybe
[47:00] you should see a vision and brother BR
[47:02] said there ain't nothing wrong the only
[47:05] thing that's the matter is your faith
[47:07] amen there's nothing wrong with God
[47:09] there's nothing wrong with his word and
[47:11] so the mother spoke out only one thing
[47:13] brother brandom do you believe it's
[47:15] God's will for my baby to be healed and
[47:17] he said yes I believe it's God's Will
[47:20] and a few days later they wrote back the
[47:22] baby is healed its leg is normal because
[47:25] if you can ever play Place yourselves in
[47:27] God's will it'll bring a perseverance in
[47:30] your life amen that if God ever promised
[47:33] something and you ever decide and you
[47:35] ever God ever reveals to you that it's
[47:37] his will to do something then there's
[47:39] not enough devils in hell to stop you
[47:41] there's not enough critics to stop you
[47:43] there's not enough tormenting spirits to
[47:45] stop you because you know and you're
[47:47] persuaded that you are in the will of
[47:50] God Amen that that's that's what we want
[47:53] to do tonight is find out if if it's his
[47:56] will and and brother brandham gave us
[47:57] another way that we might know his will
[48:00] and he said not everyone that saith unto
[48:02] me uh this is scripture now in the Book
[48:04] of Matthew Lord Lord shall enter into
[48:06] the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth
[48:09] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[48:12] and brother brandom said his will is his
[48:15] word amen so he's given us ways to find
[48:17] his will he's given us prayer and he's
[48:20] given us his word Amen brother brand
[48:22] preached a sermon trying to do God's
[48:24] service without being in his will and
[48:27] and he said if you want to do God a
[48:28] service correctly there's five must that
[48:31] you must do to know that you're doing
[48:33] God a service correctly he said it must
[48:34] be according to his word it must be
[48:36] according to his time and his program it
[48:39] must be by the person he has chose to
[48:41] give it and to do it and it must come
[48:43] first to the prophets anden he's showing
[48:46] us that there is a way that you can do
[48:47] God a service correctly and know that
[48:50] you're in the will of God Amen in the
[48:52] book of First John it said this is the
[48:54] confidence that we have in him that if
[48:56] we ask anything according to his will he
[48:59] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[49:01] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[49:04] have the petitions that we desired of
[49:06] him and brother Bram said now we ask
[49:08] what is the will of God he said there is
[49:11] only one way to know his will and that
[49:13] is by the word of God can you say amen
[49:17] and then he goes to Lamentations 3:37
[49:20] and says who is he that saith and it
[49:22] cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth
[49:24] it not and he says there it is if it
[49:27] isn't in the word you can't have it so
[49:30] we can't ask unless it's in the word and
[49:32] we can't petition or ask unless it is in
[49:35] his name but the Bible said asking it
[49:37] shall be given unto you seeking it you
[49:40] shall find knocking it shall be opened
[49:42] unto you said if you abide in me and my
[49:44] word abide in you then you can ask what
[49:46] you will and it shall be given unto you
[49:49] if you say how do how do I know that I'm
[49:52] praying according to his will but if
[49:55] it's in his word and his word word is
[49:57] his will for your life and and so you
[49:59] know as a Believer if it if it's a
[50:02] promise given to this age and it's in
[50:04] the word then you have a right to ask uh
[50:07] for for any promise am mean you have a
[50:09] right to claim any Redemptive blessing
[50:12] and it shall be given unto you amen I
[50:15] don't know about you but I'd say there's
[50:16] probably some needs in here tonight and
[50:19] probably every one of us have burdens on
[50:20] our heart and you come before the Lord
[50:24] and you can come boldly Before the
[50:26] Throne of of God and ask believing that
[50:28] you shall have it because it's according
[50:30] to his word oh and his will is his word
[50:33] brother Brandon he preached a whole
[50:35] message called inspiration and me and if
[50:37] it's been a while since you've listened
[50:39] to it I I I recommend going and listen
[50:41] to it and and and he's preaching this
[50:44] message and and he's using this
[50:46] scripture ask the father anything in my
[50:48] name and I'll do it he said it isn't our
[50:50] faith in our prayer then it's just our
[50:52] faith in doing what he said do ask the
[50:55] father in my name and you shall have it
[50:57] it'll be given whatsoever you ask the
[50:59] father in my name you shall have he said
[51:01] just makes us wonderful to think that
[51:04] that our kind heavenly father in his
[51:06] kindness has G us this privilege of
[51:08] having what we would want or desire as
[51:11] long as it's in his will of course and
[51:14] we know when it's his will if it's
[51:16] according to his word here he was
[51:18] talking about this shunamite woman that
[51:21] was was making a place in her home for
[51:24] Elijah to come by and he was telling us
[51:27] that it was inspiration that led her to
[51:29] do that but but but it wasn't just
[51:32] enough that inspiration would come but
[51:34] she followed that inspiration amen amen
[51:38] and that's what we want to do is be
[51:39] obedient when you have inspiration
[51:41] strike am me brother said the thing is
[51:44] we don't want to be fanatics but if it's
[51:46] according to the word then you should
[51:48] respond to that inspiration amen if
[51:51] inspiration would sweep through this
[51:53] building tonight and inspire you to give
[51:56] more yourself to the Lord or inspire you
[51:59] to have a closer walk with the Lord amen
[52:01] then we just believe that the devil
[52:03] would never inspire you to do that but
[52:06] that's inspiration coming from the
[52:07] Throne of God because if it's according
[52:10] to the word it's inspiration and if it's
[52:12] true inspiration it'll be according to
[52:14] the word amen but there was a a
[52:16] shunamite woman who would follow that
[52:19] inspiration and make a place for the
[52:21] prophet and there would come a time that
[52:23] I I believe I believe it's the shunamite
[52:26] woman he's is telling the story about
[52:27] how there would come a time where she
[52:29] would have to lay her baby in that place
[52:31] that it might be healed an inspiration L
[52:34] her to do that amen but but but she was
[52:37] willing Amen to follow the inspiration
[52:40] of the Lord oh and we know that sons of
[52:44] God are led by the spirit of God and and
[52:46] and anything that's clean and righteous
[52:48] that that God would lead you to do it's
[52:50] according to his word amen and so when
[52:53] God leads you Amen to a to go and pray
[52:57] for somebody or or God leads you to to
[53:00] maybe read a certain scripture and you
[53:02] do it and it's a direct answer maybe
[53:04] just something that you had in your
[53:06] heart amen have you ever had that happen
[53:08] amen God lead you to pray for somebody
[53:10] and they let you know later that that
[53:12] that that you prayed exactly what they
[53:14] were going through or or different
[53:16] things where God sends inspiration amen
[53:19] and we know it's his will because it's
[53:21] according to his word oh you might be
[53:23] laughed at you might you might be
[53:25] considered fanatic IAL amen but but but
[53:28] it it would be uh uh it would um be um
[53:32] right of us it would it would be
[53:34] behooving of us as Believers to follow
[53:37] the channel of inspiration that God
[53:39] sends down amen because there's T times
[53:43] brother Paul where where you have
[53:45] something in your heart you know God's
[53:46] leading you to do something and you
[53:48] can't hardly get away from it you might
[53:50] try you might try to reason it away but
[53:53] you can't get away from it and then you
[53:55] know that it must be God leading you to
[53:57] do something man but then there's other
[53:59] times where where where you maybe desire
[54:02] to do something and you want to reason
[54:04] that it's okay but there's something
[54:06] really in your heart that's telling you
[54:08] that it's not okay and you can reason it
[54:10] in your head as much as you want to that
[54:13] this is the will of God but yet there's
[54:14] something in your heart saying checking
[54:16] you saying that ain't right that that
[54:18] that just isn't quite right amen so if
[54:20] you have a question about something then
[54:22] you should watch that because it may be
[54:24] that that's not the right thing that may
[54:25] be that that's not God's will for you
[54:28] anden because we're we're here all as
[54:30] Believers this evening we're not coming
[54:32] in here tonight wondering if it's God's
[54:34] will for our sisters to cut their hair
[54:36] we're not coming in here tonight
[54:38] wondering if it's God's will for our
[54:39] brothers to dress decent and have a good
[54:42] attitude and and do the right thing
[54:44] we're not wondering that because we
[54:46] already have been given a word which
[54:49] tells us that those things are wrong am
[54:51] mean we don't question those things any
[54:53] longer because we know they're wrong
[54:56] amen God has sent us a prophet in this
[54:58] hour are you thankful that we might know
[55:01] the will of God for our lives that we
[55:03] might have God's perfect will for our
[55:06] lives that we don't have to question
[55:07] anymore amen if we've been baptized
[55:10] right we have the answer we have God's
[55:12] will we don't have to question uh uh
[55:15] maybe if our church is in order because
[55:18] God sent us a prophet and and showed us
[55:20] the proper order and so we don't have to
[55:22] question these things uh we don't have
[55:24] to question If a woman should wear gar
[55:26] pertaining to a man we already have an
[55:28] answer and so we know God's will for our
[55:30] lives and we walk in that will and mean
[55:33] we have scripture after scripture we
[55:35] know it's his will it's not his will for
[55:38] any of his his sheep to be sick it's not
[55:42] brother the Bible said that God is not
[55:44] willing that any should perish am me we
[55:47] know he's not willing because he put it
[55:49] in his word and we know that he said in
[55:53] the Bible bless the Lord oh my soul
[55:55] forget not all his benefits who
[55:57] forgiveth all thine iniquities and
[55:59] health all thy diseases brother brandom
[56:01] said he is here to heal tonight why
[56:04] would he heal some and leave others go
[56:07] see it's not God's will for any of you
[56:09] to go unhealed it's not God's will for
[56:12] any of you to go unsaved and mean that
[56:14] struck me when I read that quote the
[56:16] other day he is here to heal tonight
[56:20] ammen how many believe that he is here
[56:22] to heal tonight amen how many believe
[56:24] that he is here to save tonight
[56:27] amen because many times if we're not
[56:29] careful we'll come to the house of God
[56:32] and it'll become common to us if we're
[56:34] not careful it'll just become tradition
[56:36] to us that we're just here to because
[56:39] it's Thursday night but here brother
[56:41] brandom saying he is here to heal
[56:43] tonight anden we know he's here brother
[56:45] Aaron because he said wherever two or
[56:47] three are gathered in in my name there I
[56:49] will be in the midst of them but I don't
[56:51] believe he come to church tonight just
[56:53] to sit on a Pew in the corner I believe
[56:55] he come with a purpose and intention
[56:58] that every promise in his word belongs
[57:00] to us that we have a right this night
[57:03] anden I don't believe in just uh I don't
[57:05] believe that we should come on Thursday
[57:06] nights just to have a protracted meeting
[57:09] and mean or just to sit on the Pew I
[57:11] believe we should come expecting that
[57:13] the angel of the Lord accompanies the
[57:15] message and he is here in the building
[57:17] tonight to meet every need of his
[57:19] believing children amen and I believe he
[57:22] has a purpose I believe he's come with
[57:24] an intention I believe that all things
[57:26] are possible to them that believe I
[57:29] believe that that that he's the same God
[57:31] that was in the meetings with brother
[57:32] Brandon has stepped into this building
[57:35] tonight and is more than able to speak
[57:37] lip to ear with the situation that
[57:40] you're going through he's more than able
[57:42] right now to send an Angel by the way of
[57:44] your loved one and begin to brood over
[57:46] their heart amen I believe that it's
[57:48] more than the preacher that stands
[57:50] behind the desk if you could recognize
[57:52] that there is an unseen God who is in
[57:55] the midst of of his children and he
[57:57] cares about you he cares about what
[57:59] you're going through he cares about the
[58:01] burdens on your heart amen and he's here
[58:04] with a purpose to to to meet every
[58:07] promise that he said amen and you have a
[58:09] right amen if God has ever healed
[58:11] somebody and God has ever delivered
[58:13] somebody you have a right as a believing
[58:15] child to come upon the same basis and
[58:19] believe that God will do the same for
[58:20] you because he's the same yesterday
[58:23] today and
[58:24] forever oh brother br and when he was
[58:26] here he encountered many critics and
[58:30] different things and and one thing that
[58:31] he ran into was people would say that
[58:34] they belied that it was God's will for
[58:36] them to suffer or that it was God's will
[58:38] for for them to be blind and brother
[58:40] brandom said how could that be then
[58:42] Christ defeated his own purpose when he
[58:45] came on the earth and healed so many
[58:47] that he came in contact with he said God
[58:50] wouldn't run his program like that amen
[58:52] that that he would that it would be his
[58:54] will for you to suffer and he would come
[58:56] and heal his believing children and me
[58:59] and he began to he began to expose this
[59:02] thing and show that that it was a lack
[59:04] of faith among the people amen and one
[59:08] brother Brandon preached a message a
[59:09] trial and me and he would have different
[59:11] ones come up and and he he he would have
[59:14] he called it Mr unbelief would come up
[59:16] and he would say well my symptoms are
[59:18] just as bad as ever and and he would
[59:20] have Mr skeptic come up and say well I
[59:23] never had results so God is unjust and
[59:26] here would come Mr impatient and say
[59:28] it's been 25 years and I've tested it
[59:30] and it's not true amen but but but but
[59:33] here they were instead of just admitting
[59:36] that they didn't have enough Faith to
[59:38] believe the word of God they would say
[59:40] that that that the that God is onjust or
[59:43] his word is untrue when the problem
[59:45] wasn't the word it was their faith and
[59:47] here brother Brandon
[59:50] saying it would be easier maybe for
[59:52] somebody to say that it's God's will for
[59:54] them to suffer than to just say that
[59:57] that they didn't have enough Faith amen
[1:00:00] and but but what it is the devil
[1:00:02] sometimes may try to put you in a trap
[1:00:04] and make you think that you're that it's
[1:00:06] God's will for you to suffer amen but
[1:00:08] but but but brother BR here was showing
[1:00:10] us that it's not God's will it's God's
[1:00:13] will to heal it's God's will to save
[1:00:15] many are the afflictions of the
[1:00:17] righteous but the Lord shall deliver
[1:00:19] them out of them all and mean there he
[1:00:21] was in Finland and there that dead boy
[1:00:24] was raised and here brother bandam says
[1:00:26] first do you find the will of God then
[1:00:27] do it and he said but say it ain't God's
[1:00:29] will in every he said it is God's will
[1:00:33] we done seen it done I've seen it done
[1:00:35] about five different times and I know
[1:00:37] it's true because the Bible said heal
[1:00:39] the sick cleanse the lepers raise the
[1:00:41] Dead cast out Devils freely have
[1:00:44] received freely gived and so we just
[1:00:46] believe that it's God's Will and mean we
[1:00:48] just believe that that that it's God's
[1:00:50] will for us to be here tonight am
[1:00:53] because he said uh to assemble the more
[1:00:56] e even the more so as you see the day
[1:00:58] approaching and me we believe it's God's
[1:01:00] will for the preacher to stand here
[1:01:02] because he commissioned us to go and
[1:01:04] preach the gospel amen so we believe
[1:01:06] we're operating in God's will tonight we
[1:01:09] believe it's God's will to heal the sick
[1:01:11] we believe it's God's will in this
[1:01:13] meeting Amen to set the captive free and
[1:01:16] loose the bound heart we believe it's
[1:01:19] God's will because he's already given us
[1:01:21] his word and me I believe that we can
[1:01:23] know God's will for our lives take the
[1:01:26] devil back to God's blueprint and say no
[1:01:28] devil it is not God's will for me to
[1:01:30] suffer it's your will and I'm tired of
[1:01:33] operating in your will devil but I want
[1:01:35] to come back to the will of God come
[1:01:38] back to the promises of God come back to
[1:01:40] God's absolute amen and let that devil
[1:01:43] die and say Satan you are finished amen
[1:01:46] I believe that it's God's will for me to
[1:01:49] live in Victory tonight I believe it's
[1:01:51] God's will for me to have my joy back I
[1:01:54] believe it's God's will for me to have
[1:01:55] my peace back I believe it's God's will
[1:01:58] for me to have my children I believe
[1:02:00] it's God's will for the love of God to
[1:02:03] wash away all the all the malice in my
[1:02:06] heart against my brother and my sister I
[1:02:09] believe it's God's will for me to walk
[1:02:11] free from condemnation because he said
[1:02:13] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:02:15] are in Christ Jesus who walk not after
[1:02:18] the flesh but after the spirit amen I
[1:02:20] believe it's God's will that if you
[1:02:22] repent and be baptized for the remission
[1:02:25] of sins you shall receive the gift of
[1:02:27] the Holy Ghost he said I've not given
[1:02:30] you the spirit of fear but of power and
[1:02:33] of love and of a sound mind and me you
[1:02:36] don't have to live in torment anyone any
[1:02:38] longer thinking that it's God's will for
[1:02:41] you to live under a spirit of fear his
[1:02:44] word says I've not given you the spirit
[1:02:46] of fear but I've given you the spirit of
[1:02:48] love and perfect love will cast out all
[1:02:51] fear amen come back to the will of God
[1:02:55] oh it's a lying vanity man that would
[1:02:58] try to trap you brother brandom said
[1:03:00] today we're living why do we worry why
[1:03:03] do we wonder this is in why Christ speak
[1:03:05] 59 why do you wait speak and go forward
[1:03:08] don't cry out say oh Lord is it your
[1:03:11] will to heal today he said sure it's
[1:03:13] your will thus sayith the lord it's his
[1:03:15] will he said can I receive the Holy
[1:03:17] Ghost today is the days of Miracles past
[1:03:20] certainly the days of Miracles is here
[1:03:22] forever the holy spirit is here he said
[1:03:25] does men speak with tongues today the
[1:03:27] Bible said so these signs shall follow
[1:03:29] them that believe and here he is going
[1:03:31] through saying don't cry speak the word
[1:03:35] oh he said if there's sin in your life
[1:03:38] another quote here get it out he said if
[1:03:41] there's condemnation get it out if
[1:03:43] there's doubt get it out until you can
[1:03:45] see perfectly that it's God's will it's
[1:03:48] God's plan and you're included in that
[1:03:50] then say sickness in the name of Jesus
[1:03:54] Christ get away from me and remember you
[1:03:56] might not feel any better for a week oh
[1:03:59] that's an important thing to remember
[1:04:01] but as soon as you said that word
[1:04:03] something happened Oh Glory God has to
[1:04:07] keep his word that sickness shakes and
[1:04:09] begins to turn loose he will go if
[1:04:12] you'll just believe it and don't doubt
[1:04:14] and mean and and I'm just uh crazy
[1:04:17] enough to believe that if God put it in
[1:04:19] his word then it must be his will amen
[1:04:22] there stood Joshua and Caleb on the edge
[1:04:25] of the promised land amen but God had
[1:04:28] already promised them that it was theirs
[1:04:30] it may have took hundreds of years to
[1:04:32] get there but there they were and they
[1:04:34] knew that it was God's will for them to
[1:04:36] take it because he had already given
[1:04:38] them the promise that their seed would
[1:04:40] possess the land Hallelujah and as the
[1:04:43] Seed of Abraham tonight amen if all the
[1:04:45] others say there's too many Giants in
[1:04:47] the land I say but it's God's will for
[1:04:50] me to possess it it's God's will for me
[1:04:52] to possess every inch of this land I
[1:04:54] don't care about that Giants it's God's
[1:04:57] will it's God's will for me to destroy
[1:04:59] every Giant and take back what God has
[1:05:02] given me and me I don't believe we have
[1:05:04] to knck down to the devil and let him
[1:05:06] Rob us of our joy I believe there can
[1:05:08] come a shamgar anointing on your life
[1:05:11] that says this is my land this is my
[1:05:13] family and I'm tired of the devil
[1:05:16] robbing me of what God has promised to
[1:05:19] me oh Hallelujah I said it's the will of
[1:05:23] God Amen and and now now we know that
[1:05:27] sometimes God allows things we know that
[1:05:29] sometimes God allows sickness amen and
[1:05:31] so don't don't don't think that we don't
[1:05:33] believe that because God may allow
[1:05:36] somebody to get in a hospital bed to to
[1:05:38] to to bring them back to the Lord and
[1:05:41] mean and me he's the Good Shepherd he
[1:05:43] knows better than we do and me you know
[1:05:46] he allowed that boy to be blind that the
[1:05:48] works of God might be made manifest in
[1:05:51] him but but I don't believe it was God's
[1:05:53] will for him to stay blind I believe God
[1:05:56] allowed it for season but I believe he
[1:05:58] was he was fixing to bring a testimony
[1:06:00] to his life and me God may allow babies
[1:06:03] to go to go to heaven at a young age but
[1:06:06] but maybe they would have grown up and
[1:06:08] not serve the Lord I mean he knows
[1:06:11] better than we do his ways are higher
[1:06:13] than our ways and so sometimes he allows
[1:06:16] things but I don't believe it's his will
[1:06:18] for you to to stay you know every son
[1:06:20] that cometh to God must be tested and
[1:06:22] tried and mean Paul had to go through
[1:06:24] afflictions and God allowed things but I
[1:06:27] believe amen that it's God's will for
[1:06:29] his children to be to be
[1:06:31] healed I believe it's God's will for his
[1:06:34] children to be delivered he may allow
[1:06:37] things he may let you go through trials
[1:06:40] but I believe he doesn't desire you to
[1:06:43] stay in that condition forever but I
[1:06:45] believe he's only using it to work
[1:06:48] according to his purpose for your life
[1:06:50] amen but what the devil I believe many
[1:06:53] times will try to do is try to get you
[1:06:54] to stay in that condition thinking that
[1:06:57] it's God's will but and many times what
[1:06:59] he'll try to do is get you to look at
[1:07:01] the other person amen that that you say
[1:07:04] well so and so got this sickness and
[1:07:06] they died but what's that got to do with
[1:07:08] you amen the Christian walk is between
[1:07:11] you and the Lorden and maybe God's will
[1:07:14] for somebody else is different maybe
[1:07:16] maybe then God's will not that his word
[1:07:18] changes but but maybe God would have
[1:07:20] somebody to go through a certain thing
[1:07:22] but but but but but come back to his
[1:07:24] word amen and the Christian walk is
[1:07:27] between you and the Lord if this whole
[1:07:29] church were to Fall Away brother Shane
[1:07:31] that has nothing to do with you amen
[1:07:34] because it's God I believe it's God's
[1:07:35] will for me to stand fast I believe it's
[1:07:38] God's will for me to to make a Rapture
[1:07:40] amen so if the whole church falls away I
[1:07:43] don't believe that changes God's will
[1:07:44] for my life I believe I understand that
[1:07:47] it's his will for me to walk in perfect
[1:07:49] Liberty amen and he'll try to get you
[1:07:52] and say well I I danced in the spirit
[1:07:55] with this person and now theyve fallen
[1:07:57] away but but but but don't ever let that
[1:07:59] channel of memory don't ever let the
[1:08:02] devil use that channel say oh so and so
[1:08:04] trusted God and they failed but what's
[1:08:07] that got to do with you I mean you're
[1:08:09] his believing child you're you're the
[1:08:11] one that's coming upon the basis of his
[1:08:13] word and how many times would brother
[1:08:15] brandom say if I prayed for 10,000 today
[1:08:18] and they all died and mean that wouldn't
[1:08:20] hinder his faith but he would come back
[1:08:22] the next day praying just the same
[1:08:25] because God put it in his word it's his
[1:08:27] will amen that that that that that the
[1:08:30] many afflictions oh that his children
[1:08:32] would be set free he said I'm the Lord
[1:08:34] who Health all thy diseases oh it's the
[1:08:38] devil amen many times it try to get you
[1:08:41] to think that it's not for you you see
[1:08:43] because I believe we're all believers
[1:08:45] and so we know that God's A Healer we
[1:08:47] know that God's a deliverer but I'll try
[1:08:49] to come and whisper in ear that it's not
[1:08:51] for you and all of a sudden you start
[1:08:53] dropping down under a heaven burden oh
[1:08:56] it's not for me here brother brandom
[1:08:58] says it makes it hard he said if you're
[1:09:01] unbelieving it's the spirit of the devil
[1:09:03] anointing that person pulling right down
[1:09:05] like that with this belief he said and I
[1:09:07] can feel that and tell it but he said it
[1:09:09] makes it hard but if a person is really
[1:09:12] believing they're pulling in the spirit
[1:09:14] of God he said cuz it's the word of God
[1:09:17] we all know that and if the devil can
[1:09:19] just put a question mark across there
[1:09:22] he's got you but when you erase that
[1:09:24] question mark and say
[1:09:25] it that's every bit true and it's for me
[1:09:28] then you're pulling from God Amen Satan
[1:09:31] will try to put a question mark in your
[1:09:33] mind make you maybe wonder if it's God's
[1:09:35] will for you to be healed if it's God's
[1:09:37] will for you to be delivered in this
[1:09:39] service but what do you do you say it's
[1:09:42] every bit true and it's for me amen why
[1:09:45] don't you just say that tonight it's
[1:09:46] every bit true and it's for me amen and
[1:09:49] you may not feel a difference right away
[1:09:51] but you just keep saying it anden if you
[1:09:53] have to say it all service if you have
[1:09:56] to say it when you get home in bed
[1:09:57] tonight you just keep saying it until
[1:10:00] that cloud leaves your life and you
[1:10:02] really believe it that it's for you it's
[1:10:05] for me amen that every promise is for me
[1:10:08] that the Holy Ghost is for me amen if
[1:10:12] God put it in his word then I believe
[1:10:14] it's for me amen it's every bit true
[1:10:17] amen and it's for me amen because it's
[1:10:19] his word amen and then the devil will
[1:10:21] try to come by brother Brian and say
[1:10:24] okay it's for you you but but but it'll
[1:10:26] probably be way down the road sometime
[1:10:29] amen what a lie of the devil amen but
[1:10:32] today is the day of salvation the Bible
[1:10:34] said now is the accepted time now is the
[1:10:37] day of salvation behold now are we the
[1:10:40] sons of God Amen when now who we what
[1:10:45] are we the sons of God hallelujah now we
[1:10:49] are the sons of God because if you can
[1:10:52] ever positionally Place yourself in his
[1:10:55] will then it's over amen so what do you
[1:10:58] do you position yourself I am a Son of
[1:11:01] God I have a right to every redemp of
[1:11:03] blessing it's his will for me to live an
[1:11:05] overcoming life it's his will for me to
[1:11:08] live an adopted life and now I'm a Son
[1:11:11] of God and you don't have to let the
[1:11:13] devil kick you around like a football oh
[1:11:15] and every day is up and down and in and
[1:11:17] out and mean you can come back to a
[1:11:20] stability and say no devil you don't
[1:11:23] have control over me anymore I'm a Son
[1:11:25] of God amen amen many times people fail
[1:11:29] to see the hour they're living in amen
[1:11:32] but many times God is doing things all
[1:11:34] around
[1:11:35] us and and and if we would just
[1:11:38] recognize it amen then we wouldn't have
[1:11:40] to look back to a day gone by and say I
[1:11:43] wish I could have lived in that day I
[1:11:45] believe if we could really recognize the
[1:11:48] presence of God in this hour then we
[1:11:50] wouldn't look back to another day I
[1:11:52] believe we would live in the moment that
[1:11:55] he is the same God yesterday today and
[1:11:58] forever and he is still the same God
[1:12:02] he's just as much God as he was in
[1:12:04] brother bram's life just as much God as
[1:12:07] he was in Paul's life and I believe oh
[1:12:10] if we could recognized his presence we'd
[1:12:13] realize what a privileged people we were
[1:12:15] to be living in this hour where we're
[1:12:17] seated together in Heavenly places in
[1:12:19] Christ Jesus Oh but it's Satan Satan
[1:12:23] would try to rob you when God has given
[1:12:25] us a whole bookful of divine promises
[1:12:28] and Satan there trying to convince you
[1:12:31] that that that that you don't that you
[1:12:33] don't deserve it or that that that you
[1:12:35] you're not good enough for it or that it
[1:12:37] doesn't belong to you but I believe that
[1:12:40] you belong in your position sister Addy
[1:12:43] I believe that God has positioned a
[1:12:45] bride in Heavenly places I believe God
[1:12:48] has a positioned a bride that's joint HS
[1:12:52] in the kingdom and I believe you belong
[1:12:55] there you belong in that position and
[1:12:58] there Comes A Time in your life where
[1:13:00] you may have strayed from your position
[1:13:02] but I believe you can come back to your
[1:13:04] position in the will of God I believe
[1:13:07] you can come back brother to what you
[1:13:09] were always meant to be and mean I
[1:13:11] believe I was a Son of God before the
[1:13:14] foundation of the world I don't believe
[1:13:16] I just became a son I believe I always
[1:13:18] was a son oh and I may have strayed for
[1:13:21] a moment but there come a time in my
[1:13:23] life where the Lord begin to lead me
[1:13:26] back to my position that I could
[1:13:28] recognize that I am a Son of God and I
[1:13:32] always was an eagle I never belonged in
[1:13:35] that chicken cage I never belonged in
[1:13:38] that chicken yard amen come back to your
[1:13:41] position in the heavenlies with the Lord
[1:13:44] Jesus come back to where you soar above
[1:13:47] all of those anxieties and all of those
[1:13:50] depressions come back to your position
[1:13:53] Amen brother Brandon would say that a
[1:13:55] halfway life is one of the most
[1:13:57] miserable places a Christian can live
[1:14:00] amen and if you're miserable tonight you
[1:14:02] can identify that maybe you've only
[1:14:05] given yourself partly to the Lorden but
[1:14:08] I don't believe you belong there I
[1:14:10] believe it's just a present condition
[1:14:12] you find yourself in but come back to
[1:14:14] your position of an overcoming life oh
[1:14:18] where the joy of the Lord floods your
[1:14:21] heart day in and day out we're serving
[1:14:24] the lord becomes the most glorious thing
[1:14:26] to you oh brother I I I I I I enjoy
[1:14:31] sports and I really do but it's nothing
[1:14:34] like serving the lord it's nothing like
[1:14:36] feeling the presence of the Lord it's
[1:14:38] nothing like that sweeping anointing
[1:14:41] that wipes away all your fears and all
[1:14:43] your worries there is a liberty that you
[1:14:46] can come back to your position oh do you
[1:14:49] hear Mother Eagle calling you oh she's
[1:14:52] flying over saying you're my son
[1:14:55] you're my daughter and you don't belong
[1:14:58] there you always belonged in the
[1:15:00] heavenlies oh you say I'm almost scared
[1:15:03] brother Isaac to really let loose and
[1:15:05] enjoy my salvation amen maybe you should
[1:15:08] be scared that maybe you should Reserve
[1:15:11] yourself if you're at if you're at your
[1:15:13] friend's house or if you're at
[1:15:15] somebody's house that you don't really
[1:15:16] know sometimes you you you don't help
[1:15:18] yourself the way you would at home amen
[1:15:21] but when you realize that you're home
[1:15:23] and this message is home and you can
[1:15:25] make yourself at home and mean you say
[1:15:27] I'm scared that the door is going to
[1:15:29] close in my face oh and God's going to
[1:15:32] lock me out one day but brother this is
[1:15:34] your home and mean we have the keys to
[1:15:37] the house this is it's not an accident
[1:15:39] that you wound up in this message it's
[1:15:42] not an accident that you find yourself
[1:15:44] seated in Heavenly places it was God's
[1:15:47] position for you before the foundation
[1:15:50] of the world and I believe it's God's
[1:15:52] will for me to enjoy my salvation I
[1:15:54] don't I believe it's God's will for us
[1:15:56] to come to church tonight with our heads
[1:15:58] hung down weary and weighted down and
[1:16:01] depressed I believe it's God's will for
[1:16:03] you to be happy I believe it's God's
[1:16:05] will to lift up your head lift up the
[1:16:07] feeble knees and praise the Lord who's
[1:16:10] the god of every impossible situation oh
[1:16:13] I believe he wrote in his word to praise
[1:16:16] him let everything that have breath
[1:16:18] praise the Lord and me say is it God's
[1:16:20] will for me to worship him in the midst
[1:16:22] of trial he put it in his word word let
[1:16:25] everything that have breath praise the
[1:16:28] Lord Praise Him in the dance praise him
[1:16:30] on the stringed instruments praise the
[1:16:33] Lord oh and brother we know that works
[1:16:37] is Faith expressed you see uh Paul
[1:16:41] talked about how be justified by faith
[1:16:43] and there in James talked about being
[1:16:45] justified by works but sometimes your
[1:16:49] Works express your faith because God
[1:16:51] sees your faith but everyone around you
[1:16:54] might not see your faith so that works
[1:16:56] expresses that Faith so that your
[1:16:58] neighbor might see your faith anden and
[1:17:01] sometimes you come to the house of God
[1:17:04] and it's not an expression of your
[1:17:05] feelings sometimes it's an expression of
[1:17:08] your faith because you may not feel like
[1:17:10] coming and me you're tired you're weary
[1:17:13] but you come to the house of God as an
[1:17:15] expression that I'm a Son of God and
[1:17:18] this is where I belong amen and
[1:17:20] sometimes I believe that your praise
[1:17:23] isn't an expression of your feelings but
[1:17:26] your worship at times may just be an
[1:17:28] expression of your faith that even when
[1:17:30] you don't feel it am mean you Worship
[1:17:33] the Lord amen even when you don't
[1:17:35] understand everything oh you say Lord
[1:17:37] you're worthy of it all Lord you're
[1:17:40] worthy of all the glory and all the
[1:17:42] honor Lord you're in control oh come
[1:17:46] back to your position
[1:17:48] amen you see when you're at home you
[1:17:51] make yourself at home and as an eagle of
[1:17:54] God this message is Eagle food this is
[1:17:57] your food I mean this isn't my this
[1:18:00] isn't my neighbor's food this is my food
[1:18:03] and I have a right to enjoy my food I
[1:18:06] have a right to feed on this message I
[1:18:08] have a right to believe that God is
[1:18:11] going to reveal himself to
[1:18:13] me you say I feel like a trespasser
[1:18:15] brother Isaac this is your position this
[1:18:19] this is your home this is your food am
[1:18:22] mean so that's why you should hunt for
[1:18:24] your position
[1:18:25] because if you can ever make your
[1:18:26] calling an election sure you you shall
[1:18:28] never fall is that what the scripture
[1:18:31] taught us and so hunt for your position
[1:18:33] amen but when you ever realize what your
[1:18:35] position is then you realize Satan's
[1:18:38] position because if you realize that
[1:18:40] your position is in Christ and every
[1:18:42] devil is under his feet then you realize
[1:18:45] Satan's position is under your feet Oh
[1:18:48] Glory depression is under your feet
[1:18:51] anxiety is under your feet amen worry is
[1:18:55] under your feet and you can positionally
[1:18:57] place yourself in the will of God and
[1:18:59] then it's over anden it's finished it's
[1:19:02] settled oh and then Hold Your Position
[1:19:05] praise the Lord amen what we're trying
[1:19:08] to do is bring out that God is willing
[1:19:11] amen but brother brandom said as we turn
[1:19:12] a corner here for a few moments I'm
[1:19:15] trusting to God that this will be a
[1:19:17] mighty and a great meeting and I believe
[1:19:19] it will it can be God is willing for it
[1:19:22] to be if we're willing to make an effort
[1:19:24] for it to be we must put our shoulders
[1:19:26] together and we must put not only our
[1:19:29] shoulders together but our hearts
[1:19:30] together we must worship and pray and
[1:19:32] call our neighbors and get the sick and
[1:19:35] The Afflicted out here and talk among
[1:19:36] each other have prayer meetings around
[1:19:39] in our neighborhood and get everyone
[1:19:40] here we can and another message
[1:19:42] expectations he said a meeting can only
[1:19:44] be whatever the people will make it now
[1:19:47] God is willing if we are willing can you
[1:19:51] say Amen but we have our part to play
[1:19:54] each indiv idual has our part to play I
[1:19:56] can no more make a Revival out of it or
[1:19:59] a meeting than nothing and no one
[1:20:01] individual amen are you listening or no
[1:20:04] just two or three of you it'll take all
[1:20:06] of us together working together through
[1:20:09] the Lord Jesus Christ to see something
[1:20:12] accomplished here in this city while
[1:20:14] we're gathered together for the kingdom
[1:20:15] of God's sake amen so I mean you're
[1:20:18] needed tonight
[1:20:20] amen you say if you want the Lord to
[1:20:23] pour out amen and mean when they were
[1:20:25] all in the upper room I believe they
[1:20:27] were all gathered together in one mind
[1:20:29] one Accord and I believe God was willing
[1:20:32] but I believe there was
[1:20:34] 120 Apostles and disciples that were
[1:20:37] willing as well and brother brand said
[1:20:39] God is willing when we are ready he said
[1:20:43] I believe that God is willing and
[1:20:45] wanting to take his people and show
[1:20:48] himself if he can only get a man or a
[1:20:51] woman a boy or a girl to lay down their
[1:20:53] own thoughts and become a prisoner to
[1:20:55] him and believe him amen amen God is
[1:21:00] willing now he saying are you willing
[1:21:04] who then is willing amen this work is
[1:21:07] for the Lord this is not for some man
[1:21:10] this is the work of God this is the
[1:21:12] kingdom of God and and when Elijah was
[1:21:14] out there on the mountain amen God had
[1:21:17] some crows I believe it was bringing
[1:21:19] food to him and supplying what he had
[1:21:21] need of is that right brother Aaron uh
[1:21:23] brother Brian amen but but but but
[1:21:25] Elijah didn't just get that and say I
[1:21:27] wonder what this is all about and lay it
[1:21:29] to the side and say I don't care what
[1:21:31] those crows bring I'm not going to eat
[1:21:32] it but Elijah said oh praise God that's
[1:21:35] pretty good and he just enjoyed it and
[1:21:38] then brother Brandon would say people
[1:21:40] criticizing uh worship and and people
[1:21:43] criticizing the joy of the believer and
[1:21:45] and brother Brandon would begin to
[1:21:46] compare it to that and say I don't
[1:21:49] understand maybe where it comes from but
[1:21:50] all I know that God sends it and I just
[1:21:53] enjoy it amen so you see he cares to
[1:21:56] send it but but you got to care to
[1:21:59] receive it and there Elijah cared enough
[1:22:01] to receive it amen but there's a people
[1:22:04] amen who say if God cares to send it
[1:22:06] then I care enough to receive it amen he
[1:22:09] said behold I sent unto you Elijah the
[1:22:12] prophet amen but if God cared enough to
[1:22:14] send Elijah he had a bride that was
[1:22:17] identified in that word you that said I
[1:22:19] will care enough to receive my message I
[1:22:23] will care enough if God sends a message
[1:22:25] I care enough to receive it amen if
[1:22:28] God's willing to send a sweeping
[1:22:29] anointing through this building tonight
[1:22:32] I believe he's got some believing of
[1:22:34] children that say God if you're willing
[1:22:36] to send it I'm willing to receive it
[1:22:39] Lord if you're willing to send my
[1:22:41] victory tonight I'm willing to receive
[1:22:43] it am mean you see brother Brandon was
[1:22:45] in the meeting he said my sister came up
[1:22:47] to me he said he said bill I was so
[1:22:49] happy while you were preaching that I
[1:22:51] felt like I could raise up and jump
[1:22:53] through the wall and brother friend said
[1:22:55] raise up and jump and she said but when
[1:22:57] you went to doing that she said the
[1:22:59] people began shouting and then I just
[1:23:01] felt like I was a little old nothing
[1:23:03] brother bam said that's the devil that's
[1:23:05] Satan when he come in to do that I said
[1:23:08] you should have raised up anyhow we are
[1:23:10] priest to God making spiritual sacrifice
[1:23:13] the fruits of our lips giving praise to
[1:23:16] his name amen God cared enough to send
[1:23:20] that by her way but there she was
[1:23:22] thinking well I'm just a little old
[1:23:24] nothing or or I don't know and may be
[1:23:27] worried about responding anden but God
[1:23:29] sent it for a purpose and I believe he's
[1:23:32] here in this meeting for a purpose but
[1:23:34] there's a people to respond am me we're
[1:23:37] not Fanatics we're responding to the
[1:23:40] word we're responding to his will anden
[1:23:43] if God sends an anointing we care enough
[1:23:45] to receive it we care enough to step out
[1:23:48] it and say Lord You're the Healer you're
[1:23:51] the deliverer Lord I receive it like
[1:23:53] Mary you say it's nothing uh uh be it
[1:23:56] unto me according to your word like hady
[1:23:58] right said it's nothing but the truth
[1:24:01] and mean when that inspiration struck
[1:24:03] you they responded and mean it's when
[1:24:06] inspiration strikes your heart and mean
[1:24:08] there comes a response out from your
[1:24:10] being oh that says Amen to the word of
[1:24:14] God oh and you may not see the answer
[1:24:16] right away am mean you might sometimes
[1:24:19] break out in a service uh the anointing
[1:24:21] is so strong amen you may dance all over
[1:24:24] this building and you think my surely
[1:24:27] the Lord has visited me and then Monday
[1:24:29] hit hits and you think my I was just
[1:24:31] being an emotional uh wreck but but but
[1:24:34] but rebuke that thing amen when God
[1:24:36] sends it and you receive it hold on to
[1:24:39] it until the answer comes oh like
[1:24:43] Abraham it may have took 25 years but
[1:24:45] when inspiration strikes oh stay right
[1:24:48] there oh that inspiration will take us
[1:24:51] through oh God is true to his word amen
[1:24:54] if there's a deep calling in your heart
[1:24:57] there's a deep to respond amen somebody
[1:25:00] that'll let him be Lord you see the door
[1:25:03] handle to the door when he said behold I
[1:25:06] stand at the door and knock the handle
[1:25:08] was on the inside amen but there's a
[1:25:11] people amen that will let him in amen I
[1:25:14] believe that later seeing age amen he
[1:25:17] was standing on the outside but I
[1:25:19] believe there's a bride who has leted
[1:25:21] him in and they have not just let him
[1:25:23] into the house house but they've let him
[1:25:25] into every closet and they've let him be
[1:25:28] the Lord total lordship total
[1:25:31] preeminence Hallelujah like the Bible
[1:25:33] says let this mind be in you which was
[1:25:36] also in Christ Jesus a people a a
[1:25:39] prisoner people who will let the mind of
[1:25:42] Christ come in and push out every other
[1:25:45] thought every other reasoning every
[1:25:47] other idea amen because it it's he has
[1:25:52] already done his part is that right
[1:25:55] amen and and when he said uh brother
[1:25:57] brand I was just listening to today
[1:25:59] brother brand was preaching about I
[1:26:00] believe it was the message lamb and Dove
[1:26:02] and he was preaching about how those
[1:26:04] Pentecostal women would let their
[1:26:06] daughters get out there and mow the yard
[1:26:08] and things like that and so you see uh
[1:26:11] you see it took a letting I mean it took
[1:26:14] somebody to let it now if that's in the
[1:26:17] negative how somebody could let down the
[1:26:19] bars how a mother or father could let
[1:26:22] down the bars and let s creep in and and
[1:26:25] how it started with somebody that was
[1:26:28] just willing to let it happen and sin
[1:26:30] creeped in and took over and would lead
[1:26:33] them far away from the word of God what
[1:26:35] about in the positive where there's a
[1:26:37] bride who's willing to let God be God oh
[1:26:43] like on Mount carel when Elijah was
[1:26:45] there put the sacrifice together
[1:26:48] according to the vision of the Lord but
[1:26:50] when that fire fell and consumed the
[1:26:52] sacrifice brother BR tell tells us about
[1:26:54] how that 7,000 rang out let God be God
[1:26:59] you see that whole Mountain saw that he
[1:27:02] was God that whole Mountain was a
[1:27:04] witness to the power of God but there
[1:27:06] was a 7,000 that said let God be God am
[1:27:10] me a people that are willing to lay down
[1:27:13] their own desires lay down their own
[1:27:16] will and let God be God oh it's a
[1:27:19] prisoner people you see uh you see um
[1:27:23] brother uh brand would tell us about how
[1:27:25] Jesus already had a conference in the
[1:27:27] Garden of Gethsemane and there he
[1:27:30] already made his decision amen he said
[1:27:33] you're going to have to suffer you're
[1:27:35] going to have to wear a crown of thorns
[1:27:37] you're going to have to pay the price
[1:27:39] you're going to have to go through uh uh
[1:27:41] some great things but he made his
[1:27:44] decision there that he would do it amen
[1:27:46] for a people for a bride but but now the
[1:27:50] decision is on
[1:27:51] us Amen brother brandom said
[1:27:54] he said there he made the decisions made
[1:27:57] what is it not my will but thine be done
[1:28:00] and now he said what's your answer to
[1:28:02] his p and you know what's your answer
[1:28:06] will you serve the Lord what's your
[1:28:09] decision he said what's your answer to
[1:28:11] his ply come unto me all you that labor
[1:28:14] and heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:28:17] amen are you willing oh to throw away
[1:28:19] that old yoke of bondage and take on the
[1:28:23] Yoke that is is easy the burdens that
[1:28:26] are light oh and and place yourself in
[1:28:29] his will because he can't heal you
[1:28:32] against your will and he can't save you
[1:28:35] against your will is that right anden so
[1:28:38] brother BR said in a message a prisoner
[1:28:41] that I I don't care if my organization
[1:28:43] turns me out I'm still going to stay
[1:28:45] with that word I'm going to do it my
[1:28:48] will is God's Will and God's will is my
[1:28:51] will I'm going to be a prisoner to Jesus
[1:28:53] Christ
[1:28:54] Christ it's God in you willing his will
[1:28:59] amen it's a uniting of
[1:29:02] Wills amen that that that uh uh that we
[1:29:07] you know brother Brandon would say that
[1:29:09] there in South Africa right there was a
[1:29:12] bunch of preachers who were willing to
[1:29:14] take the permissive will but there was a
[1:29:17] prophet who said I don't like to operate
[1:29:20] in his permissive will but I like to
[1:29:22] operate in his perfect will amen oh are
[1:29:25] you thankful amen there there's a bunch
[1:29:27] of people maybe still today that that
[1:29:30] are perfectly happy to operate in the
[1:29:32] permissive will amen and God can send a
[1:29:36] message amen and they can just maybe
[1:29:38] pick and choose and whatever God permits
[1:29:41] them to do they're happy to walk in what
[1:29:43] God permits but there is a bride I
[1:29:46] believe who desires the perfect will of
[1:29:49] God and I believe brother Paul we have
[1:29:52] his perfect word I believe that there's
[1:29:54] the people who are willing to walk in
[1:29:57] his perfect will amen no matter how hard
[1:30:00] it is no matter what you have to give up
[1:30:02] to do it oh you may lose friends you may
[1:30:05] have to forsake houses and lands and
[1:30:08] families but there's something in you
[1:30:10] saying Lord I want to be your prisoner I
[1:30:13] want to walk in your perfect will amen
[1:30:15] not my will but thine be done you see
[1:30:19] that's the problem so many times is
[1:30:21] self-will amen but but aren't you
[1:30:24] thankful that God knew what you would
[1:30:27] choose you see there he was uh Jesus in
[1:30:31] The Garden of Gethsemane right we'll go
[1:30:33] back there there he was he was already
[1:30:36] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:30:39] the world but in that Garden he said he
[1:30:43] said Lord if you be willing let this cup
[1:30:46] pass up from me but then he said
[1:30:49] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:30:51] done he say I I had have a lot of plans
[1:30:55] for my life brother Isaac but
[1:30:57] nevertheless say I've got a lot I've got
[1:31:00] my future already planned out but
[1:31:02] nevertheless say I believe it's God's
[1:31:04] will for me to to do this and to do that
[1:31:07] because maybe I'd make a little bit more
[1:31:09] money or be it'd be easier but
[1:31:11] nevertheless amen there because he was
[1:31:14] the lamb he he was the lamb being led to
[1:31:17] the slaughter amen and there's the
[1:31:19] nature of a lamb Amen to give up its
[1:31:23] rights Amen brother Brandon preached the
[1:31:25] message lamb and Dove he said it's my
[1:31:28] right but there he would say but are you
[1:31:30] willing to give up your rights Amen to
[1:31:33] be a lamb you say oh I've got a right
[1:31:37] brother Isaac to be angry at this
[1:31:39] brother they did me wrong they
[1:31:41] absolutely did me wrong but are you
[1:31:44] willing to give up your rights amen for
[1:31:47] the sake of the Gospel are you willing
[1:31:50] to give he said I've got a right they
[1:31:52] have and you may have a right to be mad
[1:31:54] you might really have a right to hold a
[1:31:57] grudge against that brother or sister
[1:31:59] and your natural rights but are you
[1:32:01] willing to give up your rights and
[1:32:03] humble yourselves and say I'm sorry Lord
[1:32:06] that I've let bitterness creep into my
[1:32:08] heart and but I'm going to lay aside my
[1:32:10] churchianity I'm going to lay aside my
[1:32:13] own self-will and say Lord I'm sorry I'm
[1:32:16] sorry for what I've done I'm sorry Lord
[1:32:19] that uh brother I'm sorry if I offended
[1:32:22] you sister I'm sorry
[1:32:24] amen it's a dying out to your rights to
[1:32:27] come back to the will of God Amen you

[1:32:32] I've held in my heart that's hindering
[1:32:34] you from moving Lord forgive me I'm
[1:32:36] sorry I'm willing to say that I've been
[1:32:39] wrong amen do don't we all come to those
[1:32:41] points amen don't we all amen maybe if
[1:32:44] you're like me it's daily or multiple
[1:32:47] times a day you come to that point Lord
[1:32:49] I'm so sorry I made a mistake but if
[1:32:52] Paul had to Die daily and Paul was a
[1:32:54] prisoner what about a bride amen we may
[1:32:58] have to Die daily but for the sake of
[1:33:00] the will of God we're willing to say
[1:33:03] we're sorry we're willing to say to our
[1:33:05] brother we're willing to say to our
[1:33:07] sister brother Brandon tells about a
[1:33:09] sister and man he's talking about I
[1:33:11] believe she was in a car accident and
[1:33:13] they said do you want to sue for damages
[1:33:15] and say my no damn there's already been
[1:33:17] enough damage I want repair oh it's
[1:33:21] pretty pretty pretty pretty good analogy
[1:33:23] amen because there had already been
[1:33:25] enough damage so what was the point to
[1:33:27] sue for damages she said we need some
[1:33:30] repair and maybe that's sometimes the
[1:33:32] way we come to in our Christian walk and
[1:33:34] mean you get a little bit fired up about
[1:33:37] something and you say I've got a right
[1:33:39] to sue for damages they've actually
[1:33:41] they've absolutely done me wrong and
[1:33:43] they were liable it was their fault mean
[1:33:46] but hasn't there been enough damage amen
[1:33:48] but wouldn't it be better that there
[1:33:49] would come some repair oh oh help
[1:33:54] Lord let us die out to our self will and
[1:33:58] we want repair we want this thing to
[1:34:00] move forward we want the Lord to have
[1:34:02] his way in our meetings we want brother
[1:34:04] Samuel to be able to get up on Sunday

[1:34:49] other cheek I'm willing Lord to get on
[1:34:52] my knees and pray for my brother and my
[1:34:54] sister I feel right now like calling

[1:35:03] bit differently when I get up well Glory
[1:35:06] we come to have church tonight amen it
[1:35:09] it may take death oh but isn't it worth
[1:35:12] it to be in the will of the Lord amen
[1:35:15] you see Samson one time he got himself
[1:35:18] into some trouble he got mixed up with
[1:35:20] the wrong thing amen but he was ready
[1:35:23] raised up to destroy those
[1:35:25] Philistines and he come to the place
[1:35:28] where he was willing to
[1:35:30] die oh to get back to get back to the
[1:35:34] blessings of God he was willing to die
[1:35:38] Amen to get
[1:35:40] back you may have got mixed up in the
[1:35:42] wrong thing and feel like you're so far
[1:35:43] from the will of God me but just like
[1:35:46] Samson maybe you come to that place you
[1:35:48] feel like you're at the end of your road
[1:35:50] you say Lord I'm willing to die to get
[1:35:54] back oh I'm willing to die Lord I've had
[1:35:58] enough but Lord I believe you raised me
[1:36:00] up to kill this thing I believe you've
[1:36:03] raised me up to overcome this devil and
[1:36:06] Lord I don't believe I'm so far gone
[1:36:08] that I can't get back to your will but
[1:36:10] Lord I just want to say I'm sorry Lord I
[1:36:14] just want to say forgive me amen as the

[1:36:30] work of the Lord amen and sometimes if
[1:36:32] you get your focus right you start
[1:36:34] looking at the carinal amen it gets a
[1:36:36] little bit easier maybe to hold on to
[1:36:38] that funny feeling but if you ever just
[1:36:41] say Lord remind me what this is all
[1:36:45] about Lord bring to my remebrance who
[1:36:49] I'm working for yeah I I'm not working
[1:36:52] just for my brother we're working
[1:36:54] together but we're working for the this
[1:36:56] is for the Lord amen who then is willing
[1:36:59] amen who then is willing to consecrate
[1:37:02] his
[1:37:03] service amen amen I believe there's a
[1:37:06] bride that says Lord I'm willing Lord
[1:37:11] I'm willing to lay it all down you see
[1:37:14] he he'll take second place he'll take
[1:37:17] third place and mean that's what makes
[1:37:19] him Lord he'll take fourth place but I
[1:37:21] believe he deserves first place
[1:37:24] and how many times amen even in in my
[1:37:27] own life I haven't always put him in
[1:37:29] first place but say Lord forgive me Lord
[1:37:33] I I I want to put you back where you
[1:37:35] belong in my prayer Life In My
[1:37:39] Worship and coming to the house of God
[1:37:41] lord I want to put you back where you
[1:37:44] belong Lord I want to be in my position
[1:37:48] but Lord I want you in your position
[1:37:50] amen maybe every head bowed every eye
[1:37:52] closed
[1:37:55] Lord I want to be in my position as an
[1:37:58] overcomer I want to be in my position
[1:38:02] and Lord I want you to be in your
[1:38:03] position I want you to have first place
[1:38:06] in this church I want you to have first
[1:38:09] place in my life you see I don't have
[1:38:12] much to offer him brother Isaac but you
[1:38:14] see there was a time where a widow woman
[1:38:16] came to an offering plate and and the
[1:38:19] Bible says many that were Rich cast in
[1:38:22] much but there came a certain poor Widow
[1:38:24] and she threw in only two mites which
[1:38:26] make a farthing in the Bible would say
[1:38:28] that he called onto him his disciples
[1:38:30] and said unto them verily I say unto you
[1:38:33] this poor Widow hath cast more in than
[1:38:37] all they which have cast into the
[1:38:39] treasury for all they did cast in of
[1:38:41] their abundance but she of her want did
[1:38:45] cast in all that she had even all her
[1:38:48] living you say I don't have much brother
[1:38:51] Isaac but you know something
[1:38:53] no matter how little you have if you
[1:38:56] give it all you've given more than the
[1:39:00] majority of people will ever give
[1:39:03] because many casting of their abundance
[1:39:06] but there's a little bride I believe
[1:39:09] that no matter how much little she feels
[1:39:11] like she has she just gives it all and
[1:39:15] and you see brother Brandon would
[1:39:16] explained to us that God seen what was
[1:39:19] down the road for that widow woman he
[1:39:21] didn't stop her he knew there was a home
[1:39:23] prepared for her in glory and me and he
[1:39:26] even compared her to Haddy Wright who
[1:39:29] was given some money into an offering
[1:39:31] one time I believe for it was for a
[1:39:32] church fund and brother Brandon was
[1:39:34] going to pay her
[1:39:35] back but the Lord stopped him and and
[1:39:40] showed that there was a blessing laying
[1:39:42] for her down the road she was going to
[1:39:45] get her
[1:39:46] children and you say it hurts to forsake
[1:39:50] all it hurts to give up everything oh
[1:39:54] but Eye Has Not Seen ear hasn't even
[1:39:57] heard what God has in store amen I
[1:40:01] believe that if you forsake Hall like
[1:40:03] Rebecca and mean I believe she followed
[1:40:06] inspiration one time and and she went to
[1:40:09] be with Isaac she watered his camels and
[1:40:12] mean what led her to do that there was
[1:40:14] an angel that had gone before and
[1:40:16] prepared her heart I believe and and she
[1:40:19] she she she followed the
[1:40:21] inspiration amen and and what if she
[1:40:23] wouldn't have followed it she would have
[1:40:25] maybe stayed in that same condition her
[1:40:27] whole life but now she knew what it was
[1:40:29] like to be Isaac's bride anden say well
[1:40:33] I got to give up so much to serve the
[1:40:35] Lord but what about what you gain and
[1:40:38] mean I believe if you really give
[1:40:39] yourself to this message it'll take you
[1:40:41] places you never imagined you could go
[1:40:44] amen take you places in the in the power
[1:40:47] of God you never even imagined give you
[1:40:49] joy and peace you never even imagined in
[1:40:51] one day oh and ation will strike anden
[1:40:55] and our bodies will be changed and it'll
[1:40:57] take you into a a future home into a
[1:41:00] marriage supper me brother brandom said
[1:41:03] amen that that he said the time has come
[1:41:05] know him in the power of his
[1:41:06] resurrection know that my inspiration
[1:41:09] that's been leading me am me class to
[1:41:11] fanatic and whatever more it's brought
[1:41:13] me to the line it's brought me to the
[1:41:15] paying off place he said mothers you old
