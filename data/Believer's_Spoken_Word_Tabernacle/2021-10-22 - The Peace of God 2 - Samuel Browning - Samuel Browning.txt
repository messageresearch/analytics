chapter 6 and i want to say we just so appreciate your prayers and it's just good to be back home and just had just some wonderful meetings and services there um i was with a brother um leon van aard he's from south africa and he's pastoring a group there and the lord just arranged it from when we were together in byc and then that's where we went we spoke their two services and then there was another brother that when i heard that i was coming down he asked if i would come over and speak the sunday evening service there so we we went there as well and then lord just really just moved in a very wonderful way on hearts and lives so i just appreciate your prayers because it was all all the working of the lord it's just wonderful when you see hearts just that god coming and god ministering to lives and the hearts just responding amen to want to just have that reality in their life and a renewing amen and healing so we just thank god for his mercy amen so i wanted just to pass along their greetings to you and just say thank you for your prayers let's look here in the scriptures in numbers 2 and number 6 and verse 22 and just at the close of last thursday just this scripture as i was standing here these scriptures just pressed so deeply upon my heart and i'd like to just begin here remember we were referring to we were reading out of that last scripture of psalms 23 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever and you realize that that scripture when it speaks of it it's it's surely goodness and mercy is in pursuit of my life so not only is god going before us but the same god is also coming right behind us as well we are we are enclosed and enshrouded in the blood of jesus christ and i'm thankful for that amen so we want to just read here in verse 22. and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and unto his son saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel saying unto them the lord bless thee and keep thee the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated as we're speaking here on on the love of god i want to just say i don't know tonight if we'll be able to finish this this thought on the peace of god but as it relates here from that portion of scripture we've been looking at that love charity itself does not behave itself unseemly and i would say tonight it's just like in in in everything in our life that we are many times the way the of the victory in our life really depends on what we're really tapped into and what we're really drawing from because we understand that when when our lives when has been touched by god and we've been born of the spirit of god that's the victory of calvary that's the victory as john would write even our faith that overcometh the world and to realize that in our lives as believers i think that as we walk on with the lord we we realize more and more we see our shortcomings we know our weaknesses very well and we are constantly we're looking to the lord that god would continue to give us grace and it's things that we want to continue to grow and we realize that many times there's things about now how god is placed within our lives it's it's up for us and god entrusts us to keep our lives in a place to where it's enriched and under the effect and the influence of the holy spirit in our life and you know when we look at this here in in in number six i want you to notice the order and just thinking of this of even in a home in many places where it could apply that the bible says the lord spake to moses and then moses was to speak this to aaron and to his sons and this was to be spoken this blessing upon the children of israel and to think of how you know when you think of how that uh the presence of god would move down and to recognize even uh the time that we're living and we realize that there's no there's no true reality outside of the holy spirit there's no true reality outside of god's word being made real and being made known when the holy spirit gets a hold of the word and he begins to speak to our life it's it's just a it's a divine connection between us and god as god begins to deal with us and you can sit here in a service and uh and you realize it's as though that you it's just you and god alone and god's just speaking right down to where you're at it's like he's calling your address out and and what's great about that is when our heart can just respond and say yes lord that's me lord i i want to identify with that lord be it unto me that's submitting to the word and allowing the word to have preeminence allowing the word to take the lead and the direction in our life and and that's exactly what god was even speaking here to moses and i think of that scripture in the book of psalms when it says how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity and david would write this by inspiration he says it's like that of that precious oil that was poured out upon the head of aaron and it ran down his beard it ran down his garments you see what started with the head moved down in the body and what what greater union and showing that there's no unity really outside of the holy spirit man can have unity but it's not a true unity but the holy spirit is what brings a real unity and a real harmony because there's a power the love of god that lays within that of the holy spirit to unify him and god was giving that of a direction there of how that this unifying it would symbolize that of christ and the bride it would be a symbolizing of the message that would go forth for every age it would be a symbolizing of how that every local assembly is to be and god's desire for every marriage and every home because it almost it there has to be a source and it takes god himself god is the one who releases of his life into the church of the living god and it's that life that brings that unity and you think of how that every time when we look at the peace of god you you you read every letter that's paul would be moved by the spirit of god or peter and you read some of the very first words that are mentioned to the saints of god and it would start out with grace and peace be multiplied unto you in how that john would stand there on the isle of patmos and here john would come with that very same announcement grace and peace uh be unto you from he which was which is which is to come from the seven spirits that are before the throne and from jesus christ the faithful witness from the dead so it's all coming down that the peace of god there's one place for real peace and that's from god it's not a peace that the world itself gives and so when we we look at this here in psalms 29 verse 11 just to think of how that david would write this by inspiration because all through the old testament god prophesied that there was going to be peace that would be coming to that even of israel and god also made known that there was that of a peace that was coming that would be a peace upon earth and we recognize that god every promise that god has made it's up to god to fulfill it now to think how god would place this here i'm just going to read this scripture in psalms 29 11 the lord will give strength unto his people and the lord will bless his people with peace i don't think there's anything greater than peace the peace of god is the is the greatest blessing that a mortal could ever have is to know that their soul and their life is at peace with god you can face anything that the devil could try to throw your way because you've got a peace you're tapped into a peace that as paul would write that passes all understanding meaning that it doesn't even make sense to your understanding of how that you can have such a peace in the midst of a circumstance like this but god is the one who gives peace to you and i i'll tell you if there ever was a time and an hour then we need peace it's right now there's always where satan is always as an agent to try to take peace and disrupt peace from the children of god to try to take peace from the family try to take peace from a marriage try to take peace from a believer you realize that even when a sickness comes and you might have had a report and then you've got to wait for these results to come in you realize what happens is a spirit of torment that tries to get in there and tries to do what trying to remove peace from your life and what if this has come out and what if this comes about satan is always against the peace of god because the peace of god is is that which it invites and it's god's presence moving within the life of a child of god but satan is always always against peace when you think about how brother adam tells us that even among those nations and he talks about how that there's a demon power there that is controlling each nation and brother says they can't even get along with one another and they'll get stirred up with one another and fighting one another satan's kingdom is not a kingdom of peace satan's kingdom is a kingdom of hatred he don't want to present itself as love and you know and then all these words you know that are nothing but lies when it wants to put it out of tolerance i remember when i first started going into i was in teaching and two years before i graduated and i had to take a a class and and i i didn't like that class at all some of the stuff that they wanted to bring out and everything they wanted to put this word was the word that they wanted to push is the word tolerance you know that's a word that the roman catholic system when they went into every nation and they wanted to try to blend unity among religions that is a word that they use from eons ago is tolerance but in reality satan ain't tolerant of nothing there is no tolerance it's simply that's my way or the highway and then we recognize if this is not the peace that god calls for you see even when there's nations that try to gain peace and you know brother brown tells us she said you don't gain peace by trying to buy out friends that's that's not real peace you you've got to keep shelling out but a real but but this of a real peace it's something that comes from god and god alone i want you to look here in isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 here isaiah writes of the promise and he says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace what a title that the lord jesus this title as the prince of peace of the increase look at this of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establishment with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this so this peace that isaiah was privileged by the spirit of god to begin to prophesy of this peace this was a peace that would would be brought to the earth by the prince of peace himself by god himself condescending and taking upon an earthly an earthly veil that he himself prepared for himself to come down and bring this peace to earth because there were lives on earth that were in need of peace lives like you and i that here to come years later would be desiring the very peace of almighty god and you know when you think about it brother brian mentioned it when he was here uh within leading the song service of how desires and things that that people would have and what it is it's a craving it's a longing for peace it's a longing for satisfaction but there's only one can satisfy that thirst that god put in you and that is god himself where god alone is the one who brings peace into a life oh my and of that peace as it says here in verse seven there there is no end to that peace look at the ministry of john the baptist here this the advent of peace coming upon the earth the bible says in luke 1 79 here was concerning john to give light to them that set in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace now i want you to lock in on this now because bringing this down to where it will go in our lunch box notice god's word coming on the scene his revealed word of what it was going to do it was to uh to guide us into the way of peace notice in luke chapter 2 verse 14 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men brother braham said in the message shalom he says he said listen he said when this full bible has been thoroughly vindicated then will come in eternal shalom and eternal peace he come and said he was peace on earth good will towards man but the world didn't receive it he was peace to everyone that come to him for peace that's a big thing he was peace to everybody that would come to him for peace you can't find one one place in the scripture where there were those when they would come to the lord jesus for peace whether it's you know the woman with the issue of blood whether it was you know the the man that we know by the maniac of gadara when that cry was gone out across the sea anyone who came to him for that of peace and received that peace that he gave their lives were set at peace but there were those who stood right face to face with him and they rejected the peace of almighty god as it stood right there in their midst whether it was the courier that went to invite him to simon's house or any of the pharisees they rejected the very peace of almighty god but there were those who received it he was peace to everyone that come to him for peace oh my this is the kind of testimony that we want to be is that right is that what's the kind of testimony to be peace for anybody who would come to us is that right peace on earth good will to men he was the peace at that new year beginning that new day of god for why he was the vindicated light of that day but there's more word to be vindicated he's got to vindicate more word and when the last word is vindicated rather then death is swallowed up in victory and the dead in christ shall rise shall rise the millennium will set in and it will be one great peace shalom let's live for that day brother and sister for that one great shalom so how do we live for that for that eternal shalom is to first have that eternal shalom within our lives to where we ourselves are drawing from that eternal shalom that eternal peace that then our lives are regarded as lives of peace think about this when the lord jesus would speak about the holy ghost and the coming of the comforter he would say it in this manner in verse 27 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give unto you now think about it the peace i leave with you you know they were troubled when he was crucified but when he appeared there to them after his resurrection and began to gather them from mary magdalene to those on the road to emmaus and then appeared then he was invited in and he broke the bread as he did before and then he was with them there for that space of about 40 days brother and sister he was leaving his peace with them they were gathered there to the word you see god was vindicating the word and he was there as as an agent as the vessel that identified god was vindicating his word and that brought peace to them as believers so much so that the bible says in the book of luke that they went to the upper room rejoicing this was before the holy ghost come why because they realized the promise was certain you see this is why god as he comes to work with a life before any promise can ever come to pass in our life it god comes to settle us in a place remember faith brother brown would describe it like this faith is a settled something and so what brings that settling is the very peace of almighty god there's nothing that will bring peace in a situation outside of the word of god being vindicated and made real in our life it brings a settledness it brings a peace it brings where you and i as brother bran told us regarding over and over with abraham abraham could go ahead and ask sarah how are you feeling any different today no i don't feel no different but he could rejoice why he had the peace of god by the faith of god that when the situation that anything that would be contrary he was abiding in the peace of almighty god oh my he was there in his home he brought peace right into that situation think about it that even in a situation that was a situation of even uh you know when we look at it that he says my peace i give to you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid now you know it don't take it don't take a rocket scientist to know that the world paul wrote about this how that the world would say peace and safety he said and then come a sudden destruction because the world doesn't hold the announcement for peace amen that's only that's that's in god's that's in god's economy because satan is not the author of peace think of how the world will do my goodness i mean you just see the i mean some of the foolishness you know that even that even when you look at it even now and you try to look at things i mean you know it's just like how things are just so you know bombarding one to another with even some of the recent things they put out there and and you know go do this and go do that and well if you do this you know we're gonna put this out there in an article and you you got things on all sorts of things even when it's dealing with the virus and things like that that's present and you see there are things that it'll put out something to try to settle people haven't done that a lot lately but then they'll try and then they'll come something else along and try to stir them up why that's a piece that the world gives but the peace that comes from god is a peace that passes all understanding it doesn't matter what kind of report is being aired you've got peace it isn't because of you or me it's because of god [Applause] not because of what this world has to offer you know whether they find a cure or whatever more for covet but the believer you've got peace you've got peace within your life to to know that god is in control and satan's desire is to try to disrupt that peace and and try to hinder that and try to block that but brother and sister we think about it just like gideon when god spoke to gideon this is where god reveals himself as jehovah shalom is right there with gideon and gideon was in a situation he was afraid are you hearing me now we're just going to run with it he was afraid and he was out there threshing wheat behind so he couldn't be seen because the medianites had been showing up and taken the wheat every time they would wait until they got right about time for that harvest to come in and here they came right on time let me tell you something we know this as believers the devil knows exactly how to try to come and bring trouble and to try to trouble our mind try to trouble the whole satan knows about it but as a believer we're not ignorant of satan's devices come on friends this is why we need the discernment of the holy spirit in this hour god has not left us god has not left us in a place to where we're wandering and going about and running here and running there but god has prepared and he continues to build the faith of the believer in this hour that no matter what circumstances come about our faith is in the living god my faith is not in my age my faith is not in my substance my faith is in the living god he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you that's where the believer's faith is resting in the living god glory be to god john here gideon had a meeting with god and god come down and begin to speak to him the things that the prophet who had been speaking about now the angel of the lord followed the message of the prophet and begin to take that message and begin to come to those and say you are the ones that the prophet was speaking about if i can paraphrase it in that way and gideon was looking me yeah you sure you got the right address a mighty man of valor but god wasn't looking at a scaredy-cat what god was recognizing if you go by yourself you'll always be afraid you'll be afraid of this you'll be afraid of that you'll be afraid of this this will come up you'll be afraid but god said a mighty man of valor is where that man becomes surrendered he becomes glory be to god he becomes so settled and with such a confidence in the living god that is vindicating himself right there before him that gideon surrendered his life and now gideon would go forth as a mighty man of valor because he met the man of valor himself the living god the strength of the living god so it wasn't gideon's great dna it was a mighty god that gideon met that gave him strength and courage and peace to wage war on the midianites i think no nothing can give peace like god right you can go to all the shopping trips you want it'll never give peace it'll give you a big bill but it'll never give you peace is that right now notice this not that's the world giveth but this is this piece give i you in john 16 33 these things have i spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace that's the only place of peace is in the lord jesus he's identifying that this place now see he's going to go away to prepare he's going to go away he must go away in order to open up the pathway that the disciples and every believer might come into this place of peace glory be to god oh my now notice in the world you shall have what oh but be of good cheer i've overcome the world so coming in him is where we have peace in him but in the world we have tribulation you can have you have peace within your life once the life of god has come in by the baptism of the holy ghost you have peace in your life but out here in the rest of the world there can be chaos going on all around you you can have afflictions you can have doctors reports you can have all sorts of things that are going around but yet down within the midst of your soul there is a peace that passes all understanding to where how is this going to come out i don't know but god is going to bring me through this as a matter of fact i'm going to go ahead and confess he is a high priest in my profession god is working it out right now i may not see it but that don't mean that the east wind ain't blowing i'm standing right here i'm going to speak to my mountain i'm going to speak to that adversary and let the resurrection wind of almighty god come down and open up a wave what does that in a believer it's the peace of almighty god that passes all understanding oh my we're not free of trouble we're not free of these things god never promised or you won't get cancer or this won't come you know people sometimes they live their lives you and i've both seen it people that live their lives trying to avoid things are you with me i mean you get people that men they want to avoid i don't want you know i don't want my family having cancer so i they they can't eat any ketchup that's got high fructose corn syrup ain't no look there ain't nothing wrong with it but when some things become a religion then the question becomes are we living by faith are we living by fear amen [Music] is that right how many times we're praying the bible says that let nothing be received but through prayer and thanksgiving let it be sanctified is that right hey listen we've depended on god this far i ain't about to stop trusting in him he's brought me safe this far he'll take us the rest of the way amen it ain't the time to back up and start wandering and start looking around sometimes the things that we call wisdom and things that's promoted as wisdom it ain't wisdom it's fear that's trying to work but never is a child of god to be motivated by fear we are to be occupied with the peace of almighty god we got a trouble all around us but in him we have peace this is why paul could write regarding this life he says in romans 8 6 to for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace our nature has been changed this minded is where our very desire that pulsates from our life is life and peace that there's for a real for a believer there's nothing that you can stand to come between you and god it ain't about do's and don'ts the desire within your heart is i want to please him i love him i don't do it because i can't do it i could do it but i don't want to do those things i want to do those things that please him amen it's spiritually minded our lives have been changed it's a desire that god has quickened and raised up to be spiritually minded his life and peace notice paul would write in ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 for he is our peace amen right so our peace is a person the person of the lord jesus christ when he send my peace i leave with you he left them his word and his word is his promise his word is his seal his word his commitment and god honors his word oh my if you could just take the promise of god tonight no matter what the promise is and begin to take that promise and begin to draw from the living god and say god this is a promise you made and maybe i'm not in the shape to receive it right now but i'm going to draw from el shaddai till my life is so lined up and in a place lord god that matches for the fulfillment of that word to take place why because he's a god and he will not lie he always confirms every single word he is our peace hallelujah new news channel is our peace good lord the cdc ain't our peace either come on friends they change their mind as much as you change your mind about what you order in a restaurant and then you say you know i wish i'd got this stick around the wind changed i'm not disregarding any faith i'm trying to say he alone is our peace we've got to have a source of peace come on now some people draw their peace from their bank account but panting a lasting peace that's a temporal material faith i'm talking about one who's a friend that's sticking closer than a brother i'm talking about he is our peace think about what he did who hath made both one hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace oh my right there at the river jordan peace was being sounded out peace was already been declared at the birth but now god had united with his word in redemption you realize every one of us were already represented there in christ is that right when the word became flesh we were a part of the word always and when the word was made flesh brother them said we were transferred from the loins of god's mind to the lords of jesus you want to know how a believer will act with the word what about levi and abraham levi paid ties to melchizedek while he was in the loins of abraham you want to know how the bridal act the bride will act the same way as the groove because the bride was there in class the whole time hallelujah glory to god i felt like preaching but i gotta stay here thank you father man i'll tell you i feel like running all over the building praise god but you know i have to kind of behave myself and preacher you all do sitting here going wow brother sam's getting a good blessing in me but that excites me he made peace we desire there was a longing there would be a longing for us but he made peace by becoming me by becoming you he made peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nine now you might look at it you know think about you know when we recognize when the preaching of the peace of god has come to our life god comes and brings correction don't he but you see the peace of god is not that that pats us on the back it's not that that tells us how good we are because what it is that's been going on in our life is a war when a person let me just let me preach now is this coming as a person has a seed of god on the inside there's a desire to serve god is that right but that old nature is still there it's influenced by all the things of the world but it's only it's only by god that can bring a real release to that inner man to where that desire becomes a full living reality because before that there's a war internally that's going on i'm talking about in the soul but there's only one that can settle that war in the soul you'll have the battle in the mind are you with me now we got a war like brother branson says war constantly with this thing right here is that right but in the soul there the war itself where the battle is in the soul he came that that battle might be dissolved and that victory might come to that life and what happens when there's a victory there's a peace treaty that's me brother the peace of the world those things can come and go this nation can be at peace with this nation and then after a period of time no longer peace but not so with god and a believer all the peace of god is so real it's so sure it's so great it's a seal of the living god that even the enemy cannot break that peace the enemy wants to try to take it away but even in the midst of the storm there is still peace in the life of the believer i say greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world [Applause] hallelujah he came and preached peace to us he brought us the goodness of god led us to repentance is that right he brought he brought us to a place because there was a longing in our life to have real peace now i want you to think of this here in isaiah 52 how beautiful upon the mountains or the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth i want you to think how god would so place this because you find paul picks this up and referencing you know of the gentiles and then we also know this promise they'll be that to the to the jews when the those two witnesses step out and they will be themselves publishers of peace they will be preaching the same baptism of the holy ghost they'll be preaching let me just put it like this they'll be preaching the same message that we are preaching because the message that we have received is that of the fullness to call us back to the true atonement call us beyond traditions and isms of man and and self-sacrificing here or this and that but it calls us back to a complete rest in the perfect atonement about perfect blood that brings a perfect peace within a life [Applause] think about this the feet you know the feet can be looked at when one of the most unbecoming parts of the body remember paul said there are uncomely parts i mean think about it right sometimes some of the most expensive clothing items we we adorn is to cover our ugly feet is that right don't worry you're young they get older well we won't go there but you know it's uncommonly parts that paul talked about think about it we beautify but how god was writing this here that there's nothing more beautiful than feet that have been adorned with the peace of almighty god in other words our life where we go and where we go and where we live from the peace of god it is there with us and the peace of god when we leave the peace of god is to be right there as well is that right when we go into a place we don't go into a place and leave it worse than when we got there is that right to think to the beauty of our lives the beauty of our lives as believers is the peace of god that we've experienced in our lives by the holy ghost it's taken an uncomely part of our life and beautified it with his own life because he is our peace there's no greater beauty in our life than to be adorned with the peace of almighty god with christ himself so you know what that makes us that makes us publishers of peace we've been commissioned to be publishers of peace [Music] oh my it don't mean you printing books it means our lives our lives that are going to publish peace lives that that witness of the peace of god that we've received lives that cultivate peace notice you see even when the dove descended there from from the heavens when they were open and it descended down there at the river jordan there was a a proclamation that was going on because the dove itself is a symbol of peace anywhere you go any nation the dove is a symbol of peace oh my to think of this matthew 5 9 let's try to draw here just for a few moments blessed are the troublemakers stinksters i don't know what version of the bible that is blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god you know brother bahamut when he talks about this of a of a life being a peacemaker he says you know he says within a man who is is in that place i don't care what the world says and what you say about him you try to make him mad he won't get mad i don't care how much you talk about him he won't pay no attention to it he'll go on because he's got a blessing in there he'll pray for you you might do anything in the world he'll never pay no attention to it he won't back bite his neighbors and go around and stir up trouble he'll be a peacemaker he'll do everything he can for he's a child of god and blessed is that man amen amen you know sometimes stirring up trouble is just simply repeating things that you ought not to repeat you see a tail bearer is one that just keeps on carrying something but you know there's sometimes there's things that can come to you that you want to let your life be the ending of it then i'm not going to pass this on i'm not going to be a conduit that keeps this thing going on because even if it is true we also have the way to evaluate even if it's true what will it cause this person or what could it cause this person is that right i mean you know i think back to brother ram tells us this in a and one of the message to be certain of god that comes to my mind right now there was a sister you know brother branham had told a uh a joke and you know that brothers were around well then one of the brothers repeated it wasn't nothing bad at all but it was the perception of that sister and what she had and that sister was so offended now watch how brother branham approached it in the pulpit he said you know what he said i'm sorry that that happened to that sister that she would even to feel that way why because we are peacemakers a real child of god is a peacemaker is that right there's times that we have to make a stand but you know the real the real heart's desire within a child of god is to be a peacemaker this is what it means it means to to pacific which means that word means peaceful in character or intent loving peace yes amen no you know sometimes we look at peace i want you to look at peace here how how paul writes of this of peace peace is powerful i mean look what it's done in our lives now look how paul would write about this here because god himself is the author of peace if i was in need of peace i'd want to go to the author of it is that right now that god noticed hebrews 13 20 now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant you catch that the god of peace that brought from the dead our lord jesus what brought him the god of peace amen working according to the word remember the bible tells us how the lord jesus was raised from the dead according to the spirit by the spirit of holiness he was raised from the dead according to the word of almighty god when he stood there and he said destroy this temple and in tune and in three days i'll raise it up again it was speaking by the peace of almighty god it was the peace of god which is the harmony of god operating through his son think about what this does in our life look at verse 21 this really excites me it'll make you perfect in every good work that means complete to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen i'm grateful for the god of peace that's maturing my life is i can look to him he makes me complete there's a maturing that's going on by the god of peace because as he's dealing with my life he's not dealing with samuel you must do this and you got to do this but no the atmosphere his desire is is that i myself would come in harmony and unity with himself all he has to do is reveal himself and then within my heart my life what does it do it submits itself last the wife would to the husband and say be it unto me lord jesus according to your word that's the god of peace working in harmony notice in first thessalonians 5 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you holy aren't you glad for that amen amen like that song the brother blind would sing lord keep me sanctified that right continue to keep me clean we've got a place where we can continue to be washed by the water of the word is that right we to have a place to be washed so who would do this the very god of peace so what washes us is the word of god but remember brother tells us in invisible union he said if you won't stand under the word then you can't be washed but if you'll be washed by the word allow the word to wash you then it's coming in harmony with the word and it's the god of peace that is sanctifying us holy oh my notice in romans 16 20 and the god of peace oh i love that shall bruise satan under your feet shortly the god of peace the god he works in harmony with his word and with his believers let me just try to bring something down here in first corinthians 14 33 i want you to just to think of this here the bible says in first corinthians 14 33 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace god is the author of that confusion itself is not just something that's outward confusion can be even something as it's inward we're in your spirit it's all tore up it's all vexed let me just say this every one of us have been there enough times to where you know in your spirit your spirit's not right to even be getting ready to say what you're getting ready to say or even in a situation whether it's with the boss whether it's with somebody else you say what should i do this has to be said but remember you want the god of peace you want the god of peace to to have it in control because there's things that has to be said and you and we have to be honest with god and say god i need you lord god to give me peace within this situation and pray until you have a peace and a settledness in your heart in your spirit because god's not the author of confusion he's the author of peace now james in james 3 he writes about this wisdom that goes back and forth earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom james said in james 3 verse 16 where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work well samuel i don't want it to be there blessed are the peacemakers somebody's got to be the peacemaker hello somebody again god ain't saying blessed are the peacemakers and and brother richie's sitting there saying i'll tell you what i wish brother samuel get his mind made up and get his act together man i'm just tired of this envy and strife and everything else no no he he's a peacemaker if he is born of the peace of god come on somebody then the same god lives in him that silenced the wind and the sea that same god lives inside of you don't let the devil try to sell short the deity is not in heaven the deity's in you [Music] [Applause] you were made to control the elements of this earth you were made as a son and daughter of god believing behold what matter of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god that ain't a title all right that's a relationship with power and authority that's been given to us through and by our lord jesus christ he is our peace [Applause] and we have a dominion over that devil he's nothing but a bluff he's a liar amen he wants to try to take peace from a child of god try to take peace from a situation and put peace if something out there peace ain't out there peace is in you my peace i leave with you my peace i give to you so you're a publisher of peace if your feet are shot oh my but the wisdom that's from above is first pure then peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy that's a big difference from earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom let's just let's go right here to this next verse oh my this is lord jesus help us and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace yes god has entrusted us to be sowers of righteousness now look it's not a question we could go right around here and say there's some seeds that i've sown that i'd like to take back but yet you can't take those seeds back here's what you can do you can sow seeds that'll counteract the effect of the bad seeds you you can spend your whole you can spend your whole time of saying well i wish i hadn't said this or i wish i hadn't done this or i would or you can go to him who is our peace and say lord jesus i was wrong right here is where peace has got to start right now if peace is going to start anywhere my home piece has got to start right here if peace is going to start on my job peace has got to start right here i can't be looking at outside things because there's nothing of the world can bring me peace but peace begins within us eventually the bible says that this earth will be filled with the peace of the lord in the millennium is that right amen and those who occupy it are those who delight themselves in the abundance of peace i believe with all my heart i'm speaking to children of god tonight amen that you love peace you desire peace but remember you are called to make peace to make peace doesn't mean that you go along with the world but neither does it mean that you have rough edges that rubs the world are you with me amen just like let's say you had a job let's say you had a boss on the job and that boss and pick whatever denomination you want to pick well let's just say that he's uh associated around the message but he don't believe in ministers let's just bring it up here now you can go to that man and all the time you can tell him you need to be in the church you need to be going to church you need every time eventually he's going to avoid you brother samuel what should i do let him see what you have is better and greater than what he's got you be an advertisement for the living god i'm not you understand we're not saying at times that there ain't things that has to be said are you with me but if you're all the time running somebody down you're not making peace is that right when jesus said look let's just balance this out around here in the scripture i would just we'll just bring this out here when jesus said think not that i'm come into earth to bring peace but i come to bring a sword well that sounds contradictory doesn't it he said i'm come to set a man at variance his own foes shall be there of his household whoo but you see what was the difference it would not be that you have people that are fighting one another but it would be the change of our nature that he himself waged war on the prince of this world to deliver you and i from that from that inward that war that was going on right there that the peace of god can come on our life to where you and i can live in this world and yet not be a part of it amen that's the peace of god to know that it's not me that's doing it it's not i that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that's doing the work that that's a peace in our life to know that it's not me it's christ who liveth in me it's a strength it's a peace within our life it'd just be like within you know in life you say you know you know maybe you say well you want you know your wife i wish she would clean house better i well there may be some things you wish you'd do better too but if you but every time if you see her is you know what honey i wish you'd be i wish you'd you know be a better house cleaner like so and so i wish you'd do it like this i wish you'd do it like that that ain't making peace i don't know how in the world that ain't making peace all that's doing is bringing contention are you with me the bible says they that compare themselves among themselves are fools not wives is that right you see this is where you and i are called blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the child of god let our lives be that of where the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace think about it on your job think about it wherever you go in your home or wherever it's at no matter what the situation is what allows the seed to go forth is a life that's lived in peace it don't mean you're going to their oh we got this uh you know halloween party coming up or we got this thanksgiving gathering or this you know christmas party oh my i got to go to the christmas party to make peace with them no that's not what we're saying what we're saying is is that within it that our lives are peaceable our lives are not contentious we can stand for principle without being contentious whoo this is what the peace of god does in our life yes it's that it might be that which would draw it withdrawal the peace is sown that fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace i want to be a peacemaker i want to be a peacemaker there's a lot of times when there's situations whether it's in your home whether it's within the church the objective is is that god might have free course just as much as god would hold me accountable to it for the church god holds every one of you accountable in your homes and and everything else even in your jobs and situation god holds us accountable to those things to be agents of peace i say god help us amen but let me tell you something greater is he that's in you amen greater is he that's in you and i'm so glad we can go to him in prayer and say lord i need more yes amen i need more amen oh my as i stood in the office here you know this afternoon and praying i said god i need more i need more of you lord i want more of the love of god i want more lord in my life lord jesus i want more of you oh god amen that that that peace and give me the wisdom lord continue to give me the understanding lord that in everything that we are truly operating blessed are the peacemakers you think of how the lord jesus this is something sometimes that many times that maybe you've noticed it maybe you haven't you know a lot of times they pressed on him with questions they came and they the bible says they pressed on him vehemently to try to catch him they it seemed like you would think well wouldn't sweet jesus want to answer their questions but you see the lord jesus even in knowing it that even in times of being a peacemaker there's times where you know what to avoid is that right you know what to avoid even sometimes when there's you know people that can come around whether it's on your job or even in situations that sometimes can arise in your home and you realize and you might say uh-oh that right there is like a hole i'm not stepping in that yes all right it isn't your brother and your sister it in your husband and in your wife recognize it for who it is it's the enemy and you stand as a son and daughter of god as a peacemaker oh my you love him good to be back home god is so good he is our peace no matter what the situation i i think god i know god has been really laying this very clear for our lives that no matter what the situation is remember who you are remember the authority that god has invested in your life you are a son and daughter of god situations don't control you you control them you say brother samuel but you know i don't want to be ashore you're not a shawl don't don't let the devil misinterpret that every time the squirrels came into existence there was a need all right sister meaty had that cancer that was in need brother branham was up in the mountains and the storm there was a need when they stood before the red sea there was a need so the word itself is operating in times of need so what must i do speak to that storm speak to that situation speak to that and say lord and if there's any you know before you speak to it just say lord let everything be cleared out and then just come and just speak to that mountain because once you speak to the rock then you can speak to the mountain amen because all those oppositions they tell that just to try as hindrance but remember what god has ordained you to be and that's what you are sons and daughters of god so when you step foot whether it's in your home or in your job if god has given you that job or even in your home you step foot within that and you say lord i claim every inch of ground of what you've given and ordained for the glory of god in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you are son and daughter of god amen let's bow our hands father lord you are so merciful and you are so mindful lord lord jesus as we look here oh god in your word we see father even in times lord in our lives god where we've fallen short lord but oh lord how we are just lord desiring just to be oh god right in harmony with you lord i pray tonight that oh god if there's any any part of our life that lord would be out of harmony with you god i pray may that be settled real real quickly tonight lord oh god anything lord jesus that would be lord out from under the blood may it be settled very quickly lord father if there's a life that's here tonight or streaming that lord that doesn't know that peace of god that peace lord you're speaking of lord here tonight [Music] lord you are [Music] our peace it's you father it's an attribute that's who you are so lord i pray tonight god that may lord just take hold of that of that promise and be be honest there before you and say god i want my life filled with that peace lord god i want that peace lord jesus granted lord i pray father tonight may you move lord to that heart move to that life in a very special way may they just take a whole lord of that promise of god with an assurance to know that father every promise you've made is ye and amen it's

that would so permeate lord from my heart lord through every chamber of my life oh god let the peace of god flow in my life oh god i don't want to be just that it's known among people but this is my desire to be a real peacemaker child of god who goes about lord to make peace give us the wisdom lord that we have need of lord when when we're supposed to say something and then give us lord god of that grace that may our lives just so cultivate [Music] cultivate a life of peace lord paul would write of that in many places in the scripture we didn't even get to tonight but a life that cultivates peace oh lord there's no one like you no one like you lord jesus may we draw from you lord who is our peace oh granite lord for every need tonight lord whether it's a doctor's report whether it's a home a marriage or a lost loved one a lord a son and daughter whatever it is may we draw from you tonight oh god oh god to draw strength lord god just the peace of almighty god grant it lord oh in the
