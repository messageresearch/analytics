once again this morning and just as we get ready just to turn our hearts to the word of the lord um just some things that i just want to remind you of the upcoming meetings there in in at the end of may here uh brother andrew glover will be with us and there's some things that we're trying to get arranged there with that and so you know i'm not i mentioned to you before i wanted to make it clear i'm not going to turn anybody away at the door i'm not going to do that matter of fact i've already i've just been in meetings where uh just where i was at even last weekend where everybody's just we're close together we had a fellowship dinner and everything else so i'm not going to turn anybody away at the door so if you want to invite someone we're doing we do all we can and so there may be young people that'll come from other churches and things like that and um so we just just want to make you aware of that and then there's lord willing brother alexander mcgoulas will be standing in here for me next weekend and we'll be over there at the dedication meetings i think you've seen it's posted uh brother paul lafontaine and they asked that we would just announce it again uh there for the weekend so we'll be there and then the lord willing the sunday after that um a brother that some of you met perhaps especially the young people have but he's never been in here but i've just had really good fellowship with the brother here for for a few years brother ronnie long will be with us on the last sunday of of this month as well and so we just i just want to be in prayer for that and i want to just draw amen we want to draw upon the word of the lord and so we we just want to turn our attentions to our attention to the lord and to his word so glad to be here aren't you i so appreciated the special amen that was sung i always appreciate the specials and so we just let's let's just if we could let's stand and and uh i'm sure that you have need or a needs on your heart let's just look to god who's more than more than able and more than willing to meet these eyes heavenly father lord as we come before you this morning lord we have need lord of you lord jesus we stand here lord and we ask that lord that you would come we just your god believe your presence is here and you just want lord to invite the word invite you just to move in a very special way in our lives i pray that lord that you know what you've laid on my heart and what's been laying i just ask that you'll just you'll come lord say what needs to be said take us as vessels lord because we i not only need you lord to speak through me i need you to hear through me we need that together as a congregation boy so father for every need it's upon the hearts of your children we just want to put a lord right right there before you on the throne of god lord you're a high priest that is touched by the very feeling of our infirmities lord may you just move lord for it's your strength that we have we ask these things for the glory of god in jesus precious name amen amen first john chapter 4 verse 17 and we're just going to read just a few verses of scripture and then i'm just going to let you have your seats and i just want to encourage you her brother carlos give them a testimony any time and i know you know this as as children of god but any time there's testimony and there's and we see victory that's not the time to start up to pull back from praying that's a time to move forward even more in prayer and the enemies on the run keep him on the run so you just even if you say well i pray in the morning but he asked sister irma different needs will come to your heart throughout just right there even while you're walking you're driving maybe you're carrying a tool up just lord jesus just touch my sister lord just because we're certainly a body and we are thankful to the lord for his mercy i want to just read these three verses scripture herein is our love made perfect or brought to a completion that we may have a boldness which is a free and fearless confidence a cheerful courage and assurance that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world we're a reflection here of what he is there he ascended on high seated at the right hand in authority and power that reflection has come back into our life wherein now is manifested of power and authority over sin this transformation there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like to speak to you this morning for a few moments on perfect love perfect confidence brother branham as he would look around and he would you know take experiences that he himself had from wildlife and other other things he would he would notice and howl that seeing god within nature and he would he would be able to direct that god would would help him to see it what some things that was taking place even in the body of jesus christ and among the people of god and he would speak of the greatest hindrance that was actually in the church and he said that's fear everywhere is fear but perfect love casts out fear he says the reason you're fearful is because the right temperance of love has never entered yet but when there's real love all fear passes away when you really love the lord you see he says love love has no fear love cast out fear and what makes fear is a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it'll cast away that fear now i want you just to stay with me here just a little bit as i'm laying this in is not saying that fear won't come but perfect love will cast it away so we want to just deal with that a little bit he says it but if you love it cast away that fear and that's the way that god wants his church not so many as charter members he wants members that's loyal loves believes and has confidence in him and you know when you look at it he would always take this brother man would take this approach and i think it's a very fitting example that we look at and he would deal with how he says what if it when i was going overseas that he said i got my wife and i begin to just lay down certain rules and say and i go away you better not be flirting with any other man you better not be you know having any other man around the house you better not be doing this and then she would come around with the same response and say well let me just give you a few words of advice you better not be around any other woman when you're overseas you better not be eating dinner with them you bet that in itself would not be love that's fear that's a lack of confidence are you with me brother brown brings it down he says i'm afraid that that's what's come into the church is that of a ritualistic legalism because you see the reality when we we get to dealing with it you know when the right love is we've looked at this for a little bit when when the right temperance of love comes in and that could be between husband and wife and and brother brown will use this example in perfect faith music standing in the gap in other places to where that he says even if my wife if i knew that i would if i did something wrong she would forgive me he said i love her and i wouldn't want to do anything to hurt her that's how that's they're in a filial love but when the that in the agape love when the love of god has come into our heart we're not serving god out of fear i want you to keep this in mind the fear of the lord is clean it's not a slavish fear you're not living this life because if i do that god's going to get on my case he's going to punish me that right temperance of love is still not there yet because though when the love of god has come into your life you can do whatever you want but if his love is there you don't want to do wrong you want to please him he's he's the desire that's that's there of your life and this is why when we when we see this how that god would speak through paul because remember god gave israel the law but remember it's still even of all the sacrifices that they could offer of the blood but yet it can never deal with the conscience the soul the nature the remembrance of it was always there but god made a promise and when god makes a promise that's god committing himself by his word to his people there's there's no there's no other commitment that god has to you and i then as god would give us his word when god gives his word he's obligating himself and this is why when the scripture paul would pick it up in romans and he would write that not the hearers of the law are just before god but it's the doers of the law and he says for when the gentiles in verse 14 which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves see god coming in and he he deals with the nature and he changes the nature so that the law and our nature are not contrary but now by the new birth that nature within us is god's own nature it's god's own life it's a son and daughter of god that's expressed it's not something different from the word it is the word now expressed in our life so it's by nature see the very writing of the word is there it's the nature of the word in our life as he says which show the work of the law written in their hearts and their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or excusing one another there's things that you can speak of in your own life that maybe there's things that can take place around you and yet within you there's a reality that holds you and says i won't i'm not going that direction i don't know about that i'm not going that way it can be family or whoever it is there's a standard not outside of you it's a standard of the word inside of you that even when you don't understand things sometimes this is why you can stand as the prophet of god and he would stand there and he says now i'm going to turn off the tapes on the first seal he says i always wondered why i was against that organizational system he says now i know why he could see the innocency and how it would so progress and there's things brother and sister that you or i may not be able to put our finger on but there's just something about it there that says i'm not going to go that way i it may not be nothing wrong with it that way but i'm not going to go that way i want to just be pleasing to the lord amen first john 5 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments i want you to understand this keeping of his commandments is not us walking around with them and reciting it's when a need arises it's even when his word as it goes forth there's a reference to that word there's an observing of that word when you've got a need in your life you keep his commandments i'm the lord that healeth all thine diseases and his commandments are not grievous they're not burdens and they're not like oh why do we have to do this and why do we have to no the love of god when the love of god has entered into our life it's not grievous to serve the lord it's not grievous when his word comes forth and his word is dealing it's not grievous because it's who we are it's part of our nature this is why second corinthians 5 14 for the love of god constrainteth us as i i i it's a love slave it constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not live henceforth unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again see this is what the love of god it does it brings us to a place we're no longer living for ourselves and if we should even start in a direction maybe you've got a right to something or or what have you but the love of god will will bring conviction in your life because in that part the love of god will never abide with selfishness or or that and i tell you great is the love of god it prevails as we read some weeks ago floods cannot drown it there's nothing that can compare to the love of god paul said charity never it hasn't failed in your life look what it's produced in your life when people would have gave up on you when you gave up on you god didn't give up on you his love was projected kept on being projected and grace steps in to produce what love has called for charity never fail heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away hallelujah glory be to god as the black brother testified he said i'd rather be standing on god's word than standing in heaven are you with me and he quoted that scripture and brother branham would pick it up he quoted he said because the word says heaven ever shall pass away but my word shall never pass away i'd rather be standing in the word than standing in praise the heaven i tell you brother you know brother ben says when the love of god comes into your heart into your life it drives out it casts out unbelief you see remember as brother bram says as you believe you become love the love of god bring projected as you're just taking that word in not just to hear ever but just absorbing saying amen lord be it unto me it drives out all the unbelief it draws drives out to things of the world and that's why you don't have to worry when the love of god comes in you're not worried about smoking you're not worried about drinking you're not worried about others other things why because the love of god has come in it has cast out unbelief it's cast out fear you're not walking around will i fail him next week you know there's a greater substance inside of you that is holding you and you're aware of it greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world hallelujah he comes in you no longer you know it's a your whole affection is upon him you're no longer walking around well they're narrow-minded and oh they don't believe this and they don't believe that you need to let the right temperance of love come in then his word is no longer grievous it's no longer why do we have to do this or why listen don't take that in one way of scolding yet i could be scolding you but look at it that there's a greater love for your life you don't have to it's not walking around by what the church teaches this and brother brown you know brother samuel says this it's got to go deeper than that what we're speaking of there's correction that has to come i have to correct my children if i love them but god's correction lets you and i know he loves us and there is a deeper life a deeper walk for you and i it's deeper than you keeping the word it must become god in you keeping his word see love love cast out fear amen now let me just work with this just a moment here the scripture says if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things to be able to look behind and say well this if the same things are being done then you can't have confidence so there's a place that we resolve we draw our confidence from that knowing that where we are standing with god in our heart that there's been a passing from death unto life and beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god if it condemn us not let me just say it like this if there's something that's in the way the enemy's always going to try to stand there when it comes time to obtain promises and he's going to rattle off all your failures but the scripture says beloved i write unto you you sin not if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous you see we've got a place where we're standing that we know within ourselves then yes there can be mistakes but yet the love affair in our heart there's not a desire to do wrong the desire is to please him don't confuse temptation with desire are you hearing me don't confuse temptation with desire temptation can be a pull a thought and everything and temptation when it comes it'll seem like it's your voice it's not your voice you say how do i know it's not my voice because your voice is a genuine voice of the word that before that will just sweep you away but there's something there on the inside that resists that that's the real voice of god temptation is not desire they're two separate things satan comes to try to tempt pool i want you to think of this here whatsoever we've got confidence that whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight it's one thing to be pleasing on one another's side but this is a whole different ball game being pleasing in his sight you see it's his life pulsating within us brother and sister when that life is that life has moved into us he observing the life of himself he sees himself on display in your life that's how he can stand there as a faithful high priest and inner seed and he could say father they didn't mean to do it why because your nature has been changed romans 8 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit notice you're not catering the the desire within you is not towards the flesh the desire is toward the spirit romans 8 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yeah rather that's risen again who is even at the right hand of god who maketh intercession for us brother branham would take the people in the message desperation i can fill it he said upon your minds how do i know when this token's been applied look what you were and what are you there's evidence look look look what you wear and what you are look what you were before this token was applied to your life what your desires were before and now what your desires are then you know it goes on to say 64 questions and answers he says one of the one of the best signs i know that you're filled with the spirit you're so in love with christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth he says your life's full of joy everything's different from what it used to be i didn't say it's what you want it to be yet but it's different from what it used to be [Applause] so when we see this here god's approval i want to just just deal with this part of it the perfect love perfect confidence god's approval of us there's only one there's only one place of god's approval and that is in the beloved brother brown would say it like this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval and i want to ask you sometimes sometimes there's still battles with this oh this is going wrong this is going wrong oh i must i tell you i must have lived such a terrible life and i wait a minute are you talking about things before the blood how can you talk about things before the blood's been applied are you with me you see there are things stormy clouds why do you say that because when the blood has been applied the past has been dealt with your present is certain and so is your future god is not one who hangs things over our head and said i'm gonna make you pay for this the rest of your life that's a spirit of torment rebuke him cast him down he has no place you can't live in the past and go forward with god cloudy skies are no sign of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had before us for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know oh i like that we shall know because he said so so already in his word he's already declared his love to us in his word and manifested that he did love us you see somebody could try to mess with you and say well that's wrotten in the word but that promise ain't for you but here's where you can put it right back in the devil's face and say it's not only been written but the love has been manifested to me hallelujah and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass i got quiet but it's all right if you just say it just keep his word say lord help me if i'm not at that point yet help me to get to that place to conduct myself with joy now you know joy joy ain't flipping out here you know where it's just based on how things are rising and falling you know what real joy is the joy of the lord is my strength you know what that's based on it's based on the fullness of his joy his life his love the holy ghost inside of you that's the real joy of the lord because all around us we'll face disappointments we'll face cloudy skies we'll face a lot of things but the joy of the lord is that i know in whom i have believed and i am persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against the day that's the joy of the lord are you with me hallelujah let me read this in romans 5 1. notice therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god we've got something to look forward to the devil ain't got nothing to look forward to the only thing he's got is a lake of fire hallelujah glory be to god but notice how paul will pick this up and not only so that's big words that is not our only glory like boy i tell you i can't wait till i get out here one of these days oh i just can't wait man when you're not reading the end of the story here we're not only glorying in the expectation of the change of our bodies of the resurrection of the dead in christ we're not just glorying that we have an assurance that right there i'm part of that i'm part of that rapture because that rapture is in me i've been cut away from the things of the world but that's not the only glory we glory in tribulations also if you just say lord jesus i'm going to take a big swig of the holy ghost and swallow that one down [Applause] hey you might as well be honest with him i'd rather be honest with him i'd rather stand there and say lord i'm not to that place to that level yet but i believe that lord that's what i'm looking for in my life god's not after pretenders he's after those who are honest before him he can move for those who are honest but we glory and tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us simply put we are aware even though we may not sign up for it we know that tribulation it's working endurance the tests and trials that he permits to come our way it's god molding us he's shaping our character and as we as that character is being molded and shaped listen to me the same expectation you have in the coming of the lord is the same expectation when you're going through the midst of a test or trial that you can stand there and say i don't know how it's all going to unfold i don't know how it's all going to come out but i am expecting god to move on the scene i'm not running around and jumping and saying look at this tribulation glory to god no the glory is that there's a love of god in my heart but i know he's with me he said he'd never leave me nor forsake me so i know regards of my feelings or how i feel that's what his word said and i've got his word inside of me and i'm expecting god to show up i'm expecting god to lead me through this test hallelujah and there might not be a time where you've got his hands it might be him packing you along but regardless he's got us hallelujah this is why paul would say that christ his prayer was that christ would dwell in our hearts by faith that we would be rooted and grounded in love that that's the good soil in love to draw because for a plant a plant a plant draws its nutrients not from its leaves it draws the nutrients from the ground is that right it's what's in the ground that it draws from when when when storms come about when there's times of drought there's got to be a source there's got to be roots that found water when there's dryness above when this feels dryness there's got to be an anchor that deep down in there that says i'm tapped into water oh we might feel weak and we're discouraged but deep down there's a source we're tapped into greater is he that is in you that he that's in the world it's a level god that steps forward in that moment hallelujah god let me just say it to you god has already spoken over your life god has already spoken in your life surely the lord will do nothing but what he reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets and the lion hath moroid who will fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy let me just bring it down to our life god has already spoken by the seal of his presence what could the devil take away or add to that what are you saying i'm talking about a finished work by a god who finishes what he starts hallelujah there's something to remember something to remember remember god he wanted israel to remember he wanted israel to remember i brought you out of egypt i sought out places for you to put your tents i did all this brother said it like this in perfect faith when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in that muck of mud he said as i talked about this morning god come to us oh i come to god no you didn't god came to you god sought you you never saw god no man can come to me except the father draws him first and god came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love see when we're not this is where we're putting the real evidence on what he has done he came to where you were and he brought you out oh there was a mighty hold upon your life that first nature that pharaoh that scoffed at the word that pharaoh that thought he had it but there was a mighty one who came into your life a mighty one who begin to overthrow doubt and unbelief and fear and begin to dismantle holes who is that that's a god who loves you and that ought to create a perfect love look what she was look what you are i'm talking about evidences now look what's your word look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word amen i think there's times we need to rehearse the word come on now the devil does enough rehearsing they're trying to whoop around and try to beat try to put different things and and you know that devil he knows he can come and try to quote the word and try to tie you up he'll try to put condemnation on your life are you hearing me this morning but you let god get a hold of you see he can't overthrow the work of god in your life but he's trying to hinder it he's trying to hinder the confidence because if you can have confidence in what god has made you what he's done in your life and you know you're walking and stepped with him there in a devil can stand before you are you hearing me this ain't pie in the sky this is thus saith the lord he caught me i like this to me this is something we need to break forth in a testimony service this is what needs to be said he caught me when i was nothing i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand he caught me he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when you was unlovable he changed you the brother said just like the colored sister when she said i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be but that i know i'm not what i used to be she knowed she had come somewhere something happened that's the measuring stick on the inside are you with me that's a standard that you live by on the inside that you know that you've been brought from somewhere he changed you oh my you see he's seen something in you seen something in me look at the people he said that's unsaved today millions and he said but nobody can take your place you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you oh he says and then won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith [Music] god loves you you love god you love one another that brings faith now every situation we face we need faith is that right when the faith of god has moved inside of our life it brings the change the transformation the new birth and we need faith for every situation no matter what it is it comes up it's not that you don't have faith but sometimes we're looking and you know what is your praying about things in the lord do i go this direction do i go that direction or something arises and you're facing it and there ain't no going around it right there ain't no saying you know what i'll turn it off and come back you know and resume the next time no there's things in life you just don't you can't shut it off this ain't a game you got to face it is that right that's many things what's wrong with this generation they i just turn it off i just reset it i just get a passcode you know you can't get around it life situations you've got to face it head-on is that right sometimes let's just be honest well let me just preach a little bit here let's just take a couple examples here's a man by the name of sham guard we're there in one scripture yeah one scripture it doesn't even go into details about shamkar but the prophet of god in this age could go back and he could deal with deal with shamgar's life shamgar was a man who they raised their crops and here they get them to a place of harvest time and sham guard could look out there and say my this is gonna be enough food to sustain our family here for the for the winter boy we're gonna this this is gonna be good you see because every time when it would come to that place of harvest philistines would show up and they wanted to take all the labor that had been put in there brother brahm talks about how satan would want to try to come into a church he said even he said even in your life he said when a promise has been given you and he says you're standing there and the devil come and whisper and say look at you you're you're still not well yet you're still not healed yet yeah but you see shamgar in this day not you know for years years he had taken that weapon are you with me but he didn't have to take that weapon something started changing he started looking at that crop thinking about his family and about that time he's looking around and he hears the the philistines come marching in and he looks at himself how can i do this i'm not a warrior i don't even know how to fight with spears and and this and that and there's 600 of them coming but you see listen to me at that moment brother bram said god moved in you know why because he began to faint not in terms of defeat it came to a spot where he said not today his thoughts begin to change and notice he could not move himself to where he needed to be but he began to think in a manner of considering himself considering his family and about that time god moved in shamgar got angry let me tell you something you need to get angry with the devil if there's one old booger we need to cancel you need to cancel him are you hearing me sam god made a statement not today he began to think i know i don't know how to fight i know i don't know how to do this but something begin to move within him this is what belongs to us and he said i am a seed of abraham i've got a covenant i'm a circumcised child of god and they are uncircumcised oh notice how god begin to move and the thoughts begin to flood in on his life and he stands there and takes an ox goad and he beats 600 philistines you know why god begin to move he could have had all sorts no doubt condemnation around same on you you're not a very good daddy not a very good husband you're not this you're not fat but about that time it was something moving within him not today not today let me just tell the devil not today not today [Applause] there's a lot why john could write whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen perfect faith because we know we can't have faith without love but perfect faith and i want you to listen you there are some of you that are sitting here you've heard these statements for years but it's time it's time we need to apply prayer of faith is a master of all circumstances i'm gonna tell you there's circumstances that have come about in our life maybe in your life you never would have dreamed you'd be facing that's true but let me tell you something you're not alone perfect faith is a master of every circumstance perfect faith don't make circumstances go away are you hearing me it don't make them go away you don't make it well i spoke to and it didn't go away perfect faith is not making circumstances going away perfect faith brings a prevailing and an overcoming to master something means to prevail and to overcome jesus faced circumstances over and over this was not the lamb of god going to calvary circumstance free all the fullness of the godhead bodily within him no circumstances around him quite the contrary circumstances were always around demons of sickness demons of torment demons that would get in the weather try to drown him come on now demons that would come around try to get among his brethren all of these things he was faced with circumstances he stood in the face of death had to face that circumstance but here's what faith faith we know is a revelation is that right when that revelation's in our heart we're standing on that i don't know how god's gonna do it maybe there's times that god will reveal this is going to come out this way you're going to do this you're going to do that and there's other times it doesn't hey you say that scripture come on the hebrew children king we don't know if our god's going to deliver us out of this furnace but we know one thing wing bound he's going to deliver us out of your hands that's faith faith let me just say something faith mastering a circumstance um the stats gives stats family over in germany remember when they had the baby they sent over the plane brother brown we got a plane to come pack you over here and we want you to come pray for our child brother prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and the lord said don't touch it this is my hand right sister statscliff i love this personal thing she wrote to brother branham branham she said i must have not had real faith because my baby died he said oh no quite the contrary he said showing that you had real faith that even when god didn't answer it the way you wanted you stood solid faith doesn't mean that we get all the answers the way we want them that ain't faith but faith stands on his word wipe the contrary you've got great faith because you stood on his word that no matter what like joke yay though he slay me i will serve him perfect love perfect confidence faith believes that god will work it out this a mighty big statement i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow oh it masters every circumstance god told israel like this let me just let me just i'm bringing this down here it masters overcomes all circumstances there's got to be circumstances that arise that are brought under the governing of love are you with me circumstances can come fear could try to set in i'm not talking about fear in your soul of who you belong to i'm talking about circumstances can arise situations and they come before you fear has torment fear can try to dominate fear can try to drive you to do things that you'll do it that it isn't even it isn't even right with his word it's out of fear and fear brings worry uncertainty a lack of confidence let me just tell you something our confidence is not in our ourselves is in the lord in deuteronomy 7 17 if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them thou shalt not be afraid but thou shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all of egypt you see how he's combating fear remember where he brought you from he brought you from there look where he's brought you to this is how you stand in the face of fear and say food devil get back the great temptations which thine eyes saw signs wonders the mighty hand the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid you're afraid of it yeah bigger than you never faced this far but that's what i want to remember i want you to face it but i want you to face it with i'm the god who brought you out i dismantled the hold of sin that was upon your life i've changed your nature i'm the god who did that all you did was surrender to my word and i performed my word i'm the same god and i'll act the same way in this time god said i'll send the hornet that wasn't a bunch of bees going in there either it wasn't somebody in a big old yellow suit going in the hornet is the angel of the lord are you with me that's the hornet the angel the lord that would go in there and bring a sting upon their life and fear fear would take a hold of them because they were witnessing what the mighty god was doing through his people jesus said i'm coming down jesus said when he stood here perfect confidence in the word destroyed this temple three days i'll raise it back up comes close coming now getting close to the time of the crucifixion he says john 12 27 now is my soul troubled what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came my hand unto this uh on to this hour father glorified thy name then there came a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again now into the garden hebrews 5 7 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared the son of god feared now he wasn't fearing who he was are you with me this is the joy that we draw from to conduct in the midst of trials but what he feared was what he knew about the crucifixion it's just like something can come your way you got cancer or this has come about fear could come in oh you know this could be oh your life may never be the same this might happen this might well you might be in a wheelchair you know your back you know how it is you know how this could fear can come in but here's how he overcame fear nevertheless not my will thy will it's to draw from the joy of the lord that you know who you are facing circumstances facing circumstances remember samuel in order to master this i've got to know faith is not knowing faith is just something that brother greg it just drops and you can't explain it somebody say how do you know that i don't know it just it's just something just it just tells me i i don't know how to explain it it's just it's there i don't know how it just it's dropped from here to there oh aren't you thankful amen when situations arise we can stand there and look to god and you know you might be driving down the road and you've been praying and all of a sudden it just breathing i don't know how to explain that and yet you're still in the midst of a situation boy it's like the answer is already arrived but in the meantime we stand upon his word he cannot fail we keep his commandments you see this is why brother brown said you know when he talked about when when when greece jumps you know you're frying your eggs and the grease comes out and he says it it hits your skin he said it ain't the grief that burns you it's the fear [Music] hey the waves couldn't take peter down all right man my phone responding to me i found this on the web oh you did did you [Laughter] i'm talking about in god's word right now amen the waves didn't take peter down it was his fear listen to me he had substance faith but brother braham says that he began to lose substance when he started looking at the waves what should i do look to the one whom you said lord didn't he come and he said come i'm sorry the carlos he didn't explain well you know this is this is a molecular structure that nah he started walking but when he started looking at the at the wave starting to consider fear got in but you know what he did one thing that was so awesome lord help me let's not sing and jesus came over and stretched down his hands and picked him up you see this is where david said psalms 56 3 what time i am afraid i will trust in thee what time i am afraid i will trust in thee psalm 62 8 out of the message shalom trust in him at all times you people pour your heart out before him god is a refuge for us see if we can stand there and just take god at his word brother ram says it like this just say i love you lord i know you're going to answer because you promised me you would i just know you're going to do it and it takes away all fear so the devil wants to tell you well if you were a real good christian fear wouldn't come you've got authority to back him up fear has torment you've got authority to back him up fear we can experience fear out here in this realm but we know where we're standing with god and that perfect love gives us perfect confidence to stand there and say i don't know how you're going to do it lord but i know you're working anybody know what i'm talking about when you had to stand there with things and it seems like opposition is passed it's just piling up against you but you could stand there and say i don't know how but i know this is your word and i'm gonna stay right here on this world [Applause] hallelujah let's stand brother brown was going through something in his life brother brown got into a place and he says this is going from the second pool into the third pool he got to a place where he said he was afraid afraid of failure i think that's very fitting because you see where the time where he was at and that's the same thing that god made known to joshua as i was with moses i'll be with you also be strong and have a good courage don't be afraid don't be dismayed and brother joy bilabram talks about walking by a radio and a preacher was on there preaching about the resurrection brother brown as he's walking by there he says i notice he said something began to strike me the minister was quoting things from general patton and he began to quote it he says and general patton was telling them he says send me more men sent him another group of men those men were dying and general patton told him said i need more men but you keep losing he said i've told you i want men and don't send me cowards i need men that are ready to die for this cause not men when they hear a bullet they take off running are you hearing me bullets are flying all around we're not in a picnic we're in a battleground there's more by the bullets that started flying well over a year ago there's bullets all around is the time to stand on his word then he said something brother bram said something spoke to my heart and he said i remembered also something that president eisenhower said he talked about he said when he would put that bullet in the gun he said in that bullet he said i'd go to fire it it didn't go off i took it out put another bullet in yeah it didn't go off i took it out i put another bullet in brother braham said see he said that's what it is he said i don't know how god's gonna do it but i'm gonna stand on his word i'm gonna keep plugging bullet after bullet keep praying prayer after prayer keep standing on the word i'm gonna keep putting bullet after bully i don't know how he's gonna do it but i'm gonna stand here on his word [Music] heavenly father lord we thank you for
