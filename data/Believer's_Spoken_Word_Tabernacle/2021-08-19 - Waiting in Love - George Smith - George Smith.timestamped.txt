[31:00] that holds us
[31:01] that's greater than any
[31:03] any bit of our natural strength
[31:06] even when our strength comes to the end
[31:07] of its way
[31:09] god's strength never reaches an end
[31:12] this is when he told paul
[31:14] my grace
[31:15] is sufficient
[31:17] amen and we're we are we are witnesses
[31:20] of that tonight throughout this building
[31:22] here tonight there's not one that hasn't
[31:25] been through a test or in a test or in a
[31:27] trial but god's grace
[31:29] has been with you
[31:31] and god's grace is still here with you
[31:34] amen and if there's one that doesn't
[31:35] know that strength he's here tonight
[31:38] it's not an idea
[31:39] it's not a quote it's not a scripture
[31:42] it's a person
[31:43] it becomes an anchor that no matter what
[31:45] is going on around no matter how great
[31:48] the winds blow or the storm gets
[31:50] he's the same yesterday today and
[31:52] forever
[31:53] you can only aren't you glad you can
[31:54] count on jesus
[31:56] he's still the same he's never changed
[31:58] time changes but he's never changed
[32:01] amen
[32:02] we just want to just invite brother
[32:04] george and just so thankful to have
[32:06] brother george smith here with us and
[32:08] thankful for brother george friendship
[32:10] and
[32:11] and just the times that we've been able
[32:14] to have together
[32:15] and uh just appreciate brother george's
[32:17] stand
[32:18] and it's just it's just it's constant
[32:21] it's steady and you know sometimes as
[32:24] you know for myself it it's a little bit
[32:26] it's been a little bit accumulating
[32:28] meeting different ones that have
[32:30] been right there you know with brother
[32:32] branham and i've i've always
[32:34] well i've learned to really appreciate
[32:36] that
[32:37] and you know sometimes as i've said to
[32:39] people and they say well you really
[32:40] don't need that or whatever but it's not
[32:42] that i needed it
[32:44] but it's something about it that i i
[32:46] certainly enjoy hearing
[32:48] the things because what you see is
[32:50] there's some even some insight
[32:53] and the life that was there and i
[32:54] believe that that same life i i see and
[32:57] witness that right here it's in the
[32:59] bride of jesus christ
[33:01] and just the little things you know that
[33:02] you hear and it just means it to me it
[33:05] means a lot to me you know the the
[33:07] testimonies and things that are shared
[33:09] it means a whole lot to me
[33:11] and i believe it means a lot to all of
[33:13] us
[33:14] and we're just thankful
[33:16] for the grace of god in this hour
[33:19] thankful that god not only that god sent
[33:21] a message in this hour but that god
[33:25] anointed us to be able to hear it
[33:29] and that we would have a heart
[33:30] that would become a place
[33:32] that god
[33:34] could make his abode in our life
[33:36] what does all that boil down to grace
[33:40] not one thing
[33:41] that we have done
[33:43] it's what we've yielded to
[33:45] it's all the grace of god aren't you
[33:47] thankful for that tonight
[33:49] the same grace it'll take us all the way
[33:51] through
[33:52] amen let's just sing tonight

[33:56] way we want him just to take his liberty
[33:59] here tonight brother george it's good to
[34:00] have you here
[34:02] amen we're really glad to have you

[34:44] now
[34:46] i'm
[34:48] [Music]
[34:56] [Applause]
[35:00] [Music]
[35:11] [Music]
[35:20] [Applause]
[35:20] [Music]
[35:27] [Music]
[35:28] we've
[35:30] known last days
[35:36] [Music]
[35:52] amen and amen
[35:54] so good to be in the house of the lord
[35:56] tonight
[35:58] that'll be all the music i'm not going
[35:59] to try to sing
[36:03] we're going to be sitting for a while so
[36:04] we're going to be standing for a little
[36:05] bit first
[36:08] i'm not a three-hour preacher don't get
[36:10] worried but i speak fast and you got to
[36:13] listen fast
[36:15] but
[36:17] it's good to be here last time i was
[36:18] here was very cold weather
[36:20] and the pastor just reminded me it was
[36:23] 2018.
[36:24] a lot of things have happened since then
[36:27] but uh
[36:28] he was telling me much too bad some of
[36:30] the people are out look empty seats
[36:32] never bother me
[36:33] i'm worried
[36:35] about y'all getting something to take
[36:36] home
[36:37] that you would get something that would
[36:39] amount to
[36:41] life
[36:42] take you to the next sunday to next
[36:43] whatever
[36:44] so if you have your bible we want to
[36:46] turn into the book of luke
[36:48] chapter 8
[36:50] and we're going to
[36:52] read a few verses here
[36:55] in luke chapter 8 we've got uh the storm
[36:58] on the sea of galilee now they call it a
[37:00] sea but we've got bigger lakes right out
[37:02] you know close by here it's a lake
[37:04] that's eight by 13 miles
[37:07] and um
[37:09] jesus calmed the sea verses 22-25
[37:13] and then in verses 26-39 he he dealt
[37:16] with that one man who would cross the
[37:18] sea
[37:19] prayed for one man the man was delivered
[37:22] and
[37:23] the spirit in the man said
[37:26] oh
[37:26] send us into those pigs
[37:28] so there's 2 000 pigs over there and
[37:31] these spirits go into those pigs and it
[37:33] drove them crazy and they all went into
[37:35] the steve galley and drowned
[37:36] and the people were mad because you know
[37:38] the pigs were gone but anyway we're down
[37:41] into verse 38
[37:43] of chapter 8 of luke
[37:45] where it says
[37:46] um
[37:48] wait a minute here
[37:51] yeah uh now the man out of whom the
[37:53] devils were departed besought him that
[37:54] he might
[37:56] go with him they want to go with him but
[37:57] jesus sent him away saying return to
[37:59] your own people your house show what
[38:01] great things god has done and he went
[38:03] his way and published throughout the
[38:05] whole city what great things god had
[38:07] done and it came to pass when jesus was
[38:10] returned to where he started out from
[38:13] the people gladly received him for they
[38:15] were all waiting for him
[38:18] now that's the historical part
[38:20] if we look over to chapter 12
[38:23] of luke
[38:26] chapter 12
[38:28] and
[38:30] verse 39
[38:33] see if we can get our bearings here
[38:36] uh
[38:37] 39 and this know that if the good man of
[38:40] the house had known what hour the thief
[38:42] would come
[38:43] he would have watched and not have
[38:45] suffered his house to be broken into but
[38:48] be therefore ready also for the son of
[38:51] man cometh at the hour when you think
[38:54] not
[38:55] so
[38:57] our consolation
[38:58] is over in second thessalonians
[39:01] yeah glad everybody brought their bible
[39:05] let's see ii thessalonians
[39:08] and um
[39:11] that's right here
[39:12] chapter
[39:13] three
[39:15] ii
[39:16] second thessalonians chapter three verse
[39:19] one finally brethren pray for us that
[39:21] the word of the lord may have free
[39:22] course
[39:23] and be glorified even as it is with you
[39:26] and that we may be delivered from
[39:28] unreasonable and wicked men
[39:30] for all men have not the faith
[39:32] surprise surprise clear back there they
[39:34] weren't all christians right
[39:37] okay verse 3
[39:39] but the lord is faithful who shall
[39:41] establish you and keep you from evil and
[39:43] we have confidence in the lord touching
[39:45] you that ye both do and will do the
[39:48] things which are commanded you and the
[39:50] lord direct your hearts into the love of
[39:52] god
[39:53] into the patient waiting for christ
[39:57] so the holy spirit is what brought you
[39:59] here today you thought you just had a
[40:00] good idea we'll go over and see brother
[40:02] samuels if he's still following the
[40:03] message and all that no you came because
[40:05] god brought you
[40:06] you know
[40:07] and uh it really wasn't your choice and
[40:10] so you're waiting today for jesus to say
[40:13] something to you
[40:15] see brother brahm says that the
[40:16] minister's job is to make christ real to
[40:19] the people
[40:20] anybody can get up here and read anybody
[40:22] can quote it but is it real to you this
[40:24] is something that is real
[40:27] so he only comes to those that are
[40:28] waiting for him
[40:30] so today we're going to speak on a title
[40:32] waiting
[40:33] in love
[40:35] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[40:36] for your grace we thank you lord that
[40:38] you've brought us each one from our
[40:40] different places into this beautiful
[40:42] little church we thank you for brother
[40:44] samuel we thank you for the people here
[40:46] we thank you lord for the welcoming
[40:47] spirit we feel and we just pray that you
[40:50] would bless your word
[40:51] may it be real to each person may each
[40:53] one take something home with them that
[40:55] would help them
[40:56] we love you we thank you we pray that
[40:58] you bless your people in the other
[40:59] countries protect them and help us lord
[41:02] in jesus name amen
[41:04] you may be seated
[41:07] now the preacher says over in
[41:09] ecclesiastes 1 to everything there is a
[41:12] season
[41:13] so there's a time for each thing
[41:16] each one of you came to the knowledge of
[41:18] the gospel at a certain time
[41:20] it wouldn't work the week before
[41:22] and some put it off and they got a
[41:24] second chance and some
[41:25] just walked away
[41:27] but there's this everything there's a
[41:28] season and a time for every purpose
[41:30] under heaven a time or a season for
[41:33] every detail
[41:35] okay
[41:36] time for every purpose under heaven and
[41:38] that covers everything
[41:40] these words are not in the bible for
[41:42] just no reason see every detail of your
[41:45] individual life right here in 2021
[41:48] and tomorrow in every moment from here
[41:51] to the resurrection and beyond
[41:53] everything
[41:54] but yesterday's gone you already forgot
[41:56] what you had for supper last night it's
[41:58] like the water in the river it's gone
[42:01] and we don't have any guarantee of
[42:02] tomorrow
[42:03] you don't know that you'll wake up
[42:04] tomorrow but we're here now
[42:06] so we're going to pay attention we're
[42:08] going to see what god has for us right
[42:10] now
[42:10] so it's every detail every thought all
[42:13] your fears he knows what the solutions
[42:16] are
[42:17] solomon also wrote there's nothing new
[42:19] under the sun
[42:21] now we think that we live in such an
[42:22] enlightened age because you know we all
[42:23] have a cell phone and we got a forty
[42:26] thousand dollar car and you know we got
[42:28] a wife we got all these
[42:29] wonderful blessings
[42:31] but guess what
[42:32] god is coming for individual people all
[42:34] this is going to burn you see
[42:36] and so it all goes to nothing so i'm
[42:39] only here to remind you i'm not an
[42:41] entertainer believe it or not
[42:43] i'm just a true witness of a very mighty
[42:45] message
[42:46] and we're here to help you to look in
[42:48] the mirror now the mirror is god's word
[42:51] this mirror doesn't need your help to
[42:53] clean it off the word is clean that's
[42:56] right amen now the ultimate
[42:59] uh alternative is like the man in rome
[43:02] he said well this old we need a new
[43:03] bible
[43:04] well you don't even know that you don't
[43:06] know the one you have what do you need a
[43:07] new one for
[43:08] you know we have the word of god so our
[43:11] job is to hold it at the right angle so
[43:13] that you can see yourself
[43:14] you see see what's lacking because we're
[43:17] all trying to get out of here everybody
[43:18] wants to go to heaven they just don't
[43:20] want to go today you know
[43:21] and so
[43:23] um
[43:23] we always are seeking balance now yes i
[43:26] brought my favorite tool
[43:29] see first we checked the pulpit that's
[43:31] exactly right
[43:32] okay
[43:36] did the amish make this for you
[43:39] but um if you notice the cross down here
[43:42] it's got a short a short piece and a
[43:44] long piece everybody can see that right
[43:46] okay the long piece is your prayer life
[43:50] as you keep your prayer life lined up
[43:53] and you see you're not you're not on the
[43:55] side you're not going that way you're
[43:56] going straight to heaven
[43:58] so as you keep your prayer life straight
[44:01] god will take care of the horizontal
[44:03] but you must keep in balance okay
[44:07] and so uh i just want to mention the
[44:10] fact i don't i'm not going to go into a
[44:11] lot of details but you know my wife uh
[44:14] passed on a long time ago
[44:16] and we had the
[44:17] the funeral in december of 06
[44:20] okay
[44:21] so i was you know pretty much devastated
[44:24] i didn't think it'd be this way but you
[44:25] know a few weeks before she passed we
[44:28] had a call from a little sister over
[44:29] here in west virginia and she said now
[44:32] uh you know this is the only second time
[44:34] this happened in my life but i was
[44:35] getting up from lunch today and there
[44:36] was a vision right there across the
[44:38] table
[44:39] and she said there was brother and
[44:40] preaching all these people preaching
[44:42] faith and there was a prayer line and
[44:44] all this was lined up
[44:46] and out of nowhere all of a sudden he
[44:47] says in your little sister thank you for
[44:49] praying praying for my sister my
[44:51] daughter rebecca
[44:53] and tell george not to worry
[44:54] everything's going to be okay
[44:56] well
[44:57] when you hear your name from eternity
[44:59] you begin to pay attention
[45:01] so i figured okay this isn't going to be
[45:02] the way i want it but god's in control
[45:05] you know the word says be still
[45:07] i'm god i got it all figured out don't
[45:08] need your opinions i'm god
[45:11] and we learn that the hard way a lot of
[45:12] times
[45:13] so
[45:14] after the funeral i remember praying and
[45:17] i asked god now look please keep me busy
[45:21] and keep me focused on the resurrection
[45:24] and keep me balanced
[45:25] and so he's done his part i've failed my
[45:28] own self a lot of times but he's doing
[45:30] his part so we're thankful
[45:32] so our focus today is waiting that's
[45:35] patience on the famous chart you know
[45:37] and it's a bit of a foreign concept to
[45:40] uh
[45:41] us that live in this instant
[45:43] world i got a friend north carolina he
[45:45] loves the um starbucks coffee
[45:49] but if there's three people in line he's
[45:50] not gonna wait no he wants it now he'll
[45:53] go across the street and pay a dollar
[45:55] for for mcdonald's uh instead of waiting
[45:57] in line
[45:58] well wait a minute
[45:59] we've got to have patience you know
[46:02] and so
[46:03] as believers that are plugged into god's
[46:06] economy and his perfect timing amen
[46:10] we are in fact waiting for the
[46:12] redemption of these bodies
[46:14] and the full salvation of our soul now
[46:17] it's well it's foreign to some people
[46:19] but you see we're saved by grace through
[46:21] faith in the atonement of christ
[46:24] we make that first step here at the
[46:25] altar
[46:26] and the atonement that was made at
[46:28] calvary but we're waiting for the
[46:30] completion or the closing
[46:33] we're in progress okay we're not yet
[46:35] perfect i hate to tell you
[46:37] you know all you guys are in love and
[46:39] newly married it's
[46:42] not perfect yet we're only forgiven
[46:44] okay
[46:46] so david wrote over here in psalm 62
[46:48] you'll find it real quick here
[46:51] he wrote here in psalm 62 and verse 5
[46:54] my soul
[46:59] is this on
[47:02] does she'll use this one
[47:04] yes or no
[47:06] okay we'll try not to scare you too bad
[47:09] uh psalm 62 5 my soul wait thou only
[47:12] upon god
[47:13] for my expectation is from him
[47:16] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[47:18] is my defense
[47:20] i shall be not be moved
[47:22] and god is my salvation
[47:24] and my glory
[47:25] the rock of my strength and my refuge is
[47:28] in god
[47:29] trust in him at all times ye people pour
[47:31] out your heart before god before him god
[47:34] is our refuge for us
[47:37] so
[47:38] our only hope in security is in god it's
[47:41] not in how much you got in the bank and
[47:43] what your name is and who your daddy was
[47:44] and all that no no matter who your
[47:45] pastor is you gotta face god
[47:47] individually okay
[47:49] romans 13 11 says and knowing the time
[47:53] that now is high time to awake out of
[47:55] sleep
[47:56] and now for now our salvation is nearer
[47:59] than when we believed
[48:01] right so it's coming it's yet to be
[48:02] completed we're in progress
[48:04] and while we wait we're not wondering
[48:06] we're not guessing but we're busy and
[48:08] we're getting ready
[48:10] and once you you know it's not that
[48:12] you're ready and you stay right there no
[48:14] you're constantly getting ready
[48:16] says in first peter chapter 1
[48:19] that the trial of your faith
[48:21] and then we have a parenthesis being
[48:22] much more precious than gold that
[48:24] perisheth though it be tried in fire
[48:27] okay that's qualifier so
[48:29] that the trial of your faith might be
[48:31] found unto praise and honor and glory
[48:34] at the appearing of jesus christ whom
[48:36] having not seen you love
[48:38] and him
[48:40] in whom though now you see him not yet
[48:42] believing you rejoice with joy
[48:44] unspeakable and full of glory that's
[48:46] what we can sing that's what we can pray
[48:47] and rejoice
[48:49] receiving the end of your faith even the
[48:51] salvation of your souls
[48:53] so
[48:54] just give you those few verses
[48:56] to let you know that you haven't arrived
[48:58] yet you're in progress
[49:00] you know the devil's on the sides trying
[49:01] to get our attention romans 8 23 we
[49:04] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[49:06] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[49:09] of our body
[49:10] for we are saved by hope
[49:13] but hope that is seen is not hope for
[49:16] what a man seeth why does he had hope
[49:17] for it
[49:18] but if we hope for that which we see not
[49:20] then we do with patience wait for it so
[49:23] we're waiting patiently we're waiting in
[49:25] love
[49:26] now some people aren't waiting in love
[49:28] they're waiting with a big stick to
[49:29] smash anybody that doesn't see it there
[49:31] narrow way
[49:33] i'm sure you probably don't have anybody
[49:34] up here in ohio like that but where i
[49:36] come from there are people with very
[49:38] very narrow
[49:39] vision you know
[49:41] and anybody didn't qualify now that's
[49:43] what we're seeing in afghanistan right
[49:44] now those people which are the sons of
[49:47] who
[49:48] ismail
[49:49] they have no patience
[49:51] it's my way or no way
[49:54] they're burning women in the street
[49:56] it's crazy okay so everything of value
[49:59] you must wait for it
[50:01] as a child it was always weight
[50:04] i don't see too many children here but
[50:05] you know what i'm talking about
[50:07] and so they would say well no no not now
[50:09] later later son later when you get older
[50:12] and waiting for a trip was always a
[50:13] challenge
[50:15] you remember that
[50:16] and then as young adults with very
[50:19] little experience
[50:21] but with lots of opinions
[50:24] we tried to offer advice to our mother
[50:26] you ever tried that you ever tried it
[50:28] didn't work did it no no
[50:32] no it was a big mistake because she'd
[50:34] always say wait till you have children
[50:38] and you know i always remember my
[50:39] mother-in-law sister branham
[50:41] she uh used to say because you know she
[50:43] was married in in 41
[50:46] and then didn't have a baby until she's
[50:48] you know in 1946
[50:49] and
[50:50] caesarean and all these problems
[50:53] and she said um
[50:55] i wouldn't i wouldn't
[50:56] she said i wouldn't give you i wouldn't
[50:58] take a million dollars for that child
[51:00] but i wouldn't give you a nickel for
[51:01] another one
[51:05] and so my dad you know he was he wasn't
[51:07] patient i'll be first to admit but he
[51:10] said god always answers my prayers he's
[51:12] either yes or no or wait a while
[51:16] so there was always an answer you know
[51:17] so this christian life doesn't take us
[51:19] to perfection in this flesh now we take
[51:22] supplements and we try to stay away from
[51:23] the good stuff but you know we're not
[51:25] going to attain perfection
[51:27] we just don't want to you know
[51:29] we want to go into the into the morgue
[51:31] in a wheelchair you know but
[51:35] if that is what you're expecting
[51:36] perfection in this flesh well it's
[51:38] you're in for a big surprise
[51:40] these bodies are time dated yes sir yeah
[51:43] you know that's right so we live daily
[51:45] among sinners we live in a dark world
[51:47] totally immersed in sin and corruption
[51:49] after you notice that
[51:50] people say they don't want to come to
[51:51] church there's all those hypocrites
[51:52] sitting on the other bench
[51:53] well then stay out of walmart because
[51:55] full of them over there
[51:59] so we do not conform to their ways or
[52:01] their desires we're only looking looking
[52:03] around here if we start looking around
[52:05] we'll get nervous but the scripture says
[52:07] in luke 21 28 when these things start to
[52:09] happen look up
[52:11] you can't fix this i don't care who you
[52:13] are look up you know
[52:15] so
[52:16] that is why a believer with the holy
[52:18] spirit anointing his soul can walk right
[52:21] through dark laodicea it doesn't matter
[52:23] what they dress like no matter what
[52:24] happens you can walk right through
[52:26] without damage without becoming a
[52:28] casualty without looking like laodicea
[52:31] but if you
[52:32] if you only have the genuine anointing
[52:35] of god's spirit on your flesh
[52:38] and or your spirit
[52:39] while the music is playing for example
[52:42] you'll fail miserably end up in the hot
[52:44] place guaranteed
[52:46] so you must have the holy spirit baptism
[52:48] on your soul sealed securely until the
[52:51] day of redemption
[52:53] and when we get to that day of
[52:54] redemption
[52:55] hey
[52:56] we don't you don't have to figure any
[52:58] more out
[52:59] i got friends they're so worried about
[53:01] what's going to happen after the
[53:01] resurrection
[53:03] and they're so worried about that
[53:04] they're not paying attention right now
[53:06] so they're missing it all
[53:07] just take care of right now
[53:09] because you don't know that's only for
[53:11] those people that arrive
[53:12] now this is here to keep me you know
[53:15] focused
[53:16] and lets you know that we're trying to
[53:18] stay balanced but if i happen to see
[53:19] anybody
[53:21] dozing off
[53:23] see we have it's a double purpose
[53:29] because see you can only see one person
[53:31] but i can see all of you
[53:33] so we live here we use the benefits of
[53:35] uh the tools of liticia and not only
[53:38] survive but we're destined to become
[53:41] more than conquerors amen okay
[53:43] victorious laodicea believers
[53:46] when we cross over if they happen to
[53:48] hand out t-shirts it's not going to say
[53:50] survivor it's going to say
[53:52] more than conquerors we're beyond that
[53:54] you know overcomers
[53:56] you know in a boxing match there's two
[53:58] people
[54:00] only one gets the big belt in the check
[54:02] and all that right okay so he's the
[54:03] winner he's the overcomer but when he
[54:05] gives that check to his wife
[54:07] she's more than overcomer
[54:11] so
[54:13] let's see let's move along here um so we
[54:16] live in darklio to see it we all agree
[54:18] to that it's miserable a lot of ways but
[54:21] brother brandon even talked about that
[54:23] you see um when he was preaching
[54:26] in the caribbean in 1959
[54:30] there was some americans with him and
[54:32] one of them said that he had
[54:34] had a four-hour interview with brother
[54:36] branham and so uh during this
[54:39] time that they were talking he asked
[54:41] brother random why do you mention 1977
[54:44] which was 18 years ahead and
[54:48] why are you even asking a dumb question
[54:50] you might not live that long you know
[54:52] but uh brother brahm said well because
[54:54] when i was looking through this through
[54:56] the stream of time
[54:58] of course you're seeing numbers he said
[54:59] by the time i got to 1977 it was so dark
[55:02] that i didn't see how any believer could
[55:04] live in that darkness
[55:06] that's speaking in 1959
[55:09] but now we're over here
[55:11] what
[55:12] 44 years later
[55:14] it's real dark see
[55:16] but the redeemed are waiting in love
[55:20] many are waiting to hear the gospel for
[55:21] the first time
[55:23] yeah that's hard to believe because we
[55:24] got it on the radio we got a tv we've
[55:26] got every place
[55:28] you know we've got several versions of
[55:29] brother brown's messaging on our phone
[55:31] you see right now everything brother
[55:34] brahms said
[55:36] in several languages and the entire king
[55:38] james bible is on every phone on the
[55:41] planet
[55:42] so there's no lack of word
[55:44] it's a matter of taking it in so you can
[55:46] go through the grocery store i don't
[55:48] care how good a cook you are but you go
[55:49] through the grocery store and if you
[55:51] don't partake of it
[55:53] you can read all the labels yeah this
[55:55] will do that that you can do all that
[55:56] and die right there in the grocery store
[55:58] because you didn't partake of it and we
[56:00] got people sitting in churches kind of
[56:01] the same way
[56:02] so many people are hearing are waiting
[56:04] to hear the gospel for the first time
[56:07] in fact we got a missionary going over
[56:08] to
[56:09] egypt this week to carry the gospel to
[56:11] get something for those people
[56:13] so through radio through the internet
[56:15] it's reaching people that we can't reach
[56:18] you see
[56:19] now in the ministry of jesus christ
[56:21] um he didn't
[56:23] we don't read about the nicest people in
[56:24] society do we
[56:26] we read about people we wouldn't even
[56:27] let in the door this church
[56:30] i know it's rough but
[56:32] of course they got to find it first but
[56:35] no we
[56:37] we got to be careful
[56:38] who and how we talk to people just let
[56:41] your light shine you see
[56:43] many hundreds of of dangerous drug
[56:45] people have heard the gospel and have
[56:47] been baptized and a lot of them died
[56:49] before the sun came up the next day
[56:51] because they knew too much and they
[56:52] can't let them go
[56:53] that's happening in mexico especially
[56:56] but they're playing this message on
[56:58] their own network it's it's going out
[57:00] over the waves because the guy at the
[57:02] top he wants it heard
[57:05] so the book of acts is not finished it's
[57:07] being written right now you see and you
[57:10] are a part of it thank you for your help
[57:12] now many people in the scriptures had to
[57:14] wait
[57:15] i know it's hard to believe but there
[57:16] was old simeon for example in luke
[57:18] chapter 2. he was waiting for the
[57:20] consolation of israel
[57:22] he was old he lived right next door to
[57:23] the church and so god told him you're
[57:25] not going to die until you see the
[57:27] consolation and only he knew what sign
[57:29] he was looking for
[57:30] he didn't tell anybody he knew what he
[57:32] was looking for and so he he didn't know
[57:34] how long he didn't know if it was next
[57:35] week or next year
[57:37] when he sees a certain thing then he
[57:39] knew that he would be
[57:40] moving on so he would go out maybe they
[57:43] have a certain day of the week i don't
[57:44] know but they'd go out there and he
[57:46] would see all those women with those
[57:47] little babies
[57:49] no nothing today and go back to bed but
[57:51] one day he goes out and he saw a sign
[57:54] what god showed him to look for it and
[57:56] god deals with each one of us
[57:57] individually
[57:59] he's not going to put a cloud over the
[58:00] sky you know and say certain things it's
[58:02] individual and so only only uh he and
[58:05] mary and joseph knew what was happening
[58:08] so he goes up to mary said can i hold a
[58:10] child sure
[58:12] because they think they were on the same
[58:13] page
[58:15] he raised the baby said now you let thy
[58:16] servant depart in peace my eyes have
[58:18] seen what do you see a crying baby
[58:21] but that was the promise of the age you
[58:23] see
[58:24] and so um he was one of a very few back
[58:27] then that recognized the anointed
[58:29] messiah
[58:30] the value of what god was doing in
[58:32] present tense
[58:33] anybody can look back and and see you
[58:35] know the book of acts and all these
[58:36] things that it was real where is it
[58:39] today
[58:40] we got the scripture that we repeat all
[58:41] the time jesus christ saying yesterday
[58:43] today
[58:45] and forever so we argue about what
[58:47] happened there we argue about what's
[58:48] going to happen tomorrow where is he
[58:50] today don't worry about those things
[58:52] now
[58:54] so
[58:55] that's what happened in israel back then
[58:57] when you know jesus was born what about
[59:00] israel today well as you know they're in
[59:02] the homeland fulfillment of scripture
[59:04] they're waiting for the messiah and
[59:06] they're crying out for for redemption
[59:08] god has it all
[59:10] under control
[59:12] so in our scripture in luke chapter 8
[59:14] verse 40 long in there also in mark 5
[59:18] there was a lady
[59:20] up on the hillside and like brother
[59:22] brown paints the picture she was in her
[59:23] rocker she was knitting and she saw this
[59:25] little crowd gathering down at the
[59:26] harbor
[59:27] and at this point she had been sick for
[59:30] many years
[59:32] 12 years i believe
[59:34] and so she'd spent all her money doctors
[59:36] couldn't help her couldn't figure it out
[59:38] kind of like today
[59:39] and nothing
[59:41] for no relief agonizing waiting for her
[59:43] healing but she was up there and she saw
[59:46] this little boat come along
[59:48] and jesus was coming back from gudera
[59:50] which is the other side of you know the
[59:52] eight miles
[59:54] and so um
[59:55] uh she thought she'd go down and see
[59:57] what's going on
[59:59] and she started hearing whispers oh
[1:00:01] jesus
[1:00:02] jesus is here
[1:00:03] i've heard about him i saw him you know
[1:00:05] reflected in some other people but here
[1:00:07] he is
[1:00:08] and she
[1:00:09] she had in her mind if i can just touch
[1:00:12] the hem of his garment just just touch
[1:00:13] that i'll be fine
[1:00:15] so she made her way through the crowd
[1:00:18] all these people
[1:00:19] and she touched his garment somewhere
[1:00:21] and then she backed off and went over
[1:00:22] and sat down
[1:00:23] and then jesus said
[1:00:25] uh wait a minute here somebody touch me
[1:00:28] and guess
[1:00:29] who was there big mouth peter
[1:00:32] oh please lord look at this crowd what
[1:00:34] are you talking about
[1:00:35] peter
[1:00:36] take a seat i know what i'm talking
[1:00:38] about and so he looked and he deserved
[1:00:40] it was you and she was healed
[1:00:43] and so
[1:00:45] um we have also in luke 19 where jesus
[1:00:48] was walking through jericho and you've
[1:00:50] heard brother tell it many times he's
[1:00:52] walking through jericho and everybody
[1:00:54] wants to touch him and the disciples
[1:00:56] said now stand back stand back monster's
[1:00:58] tired so he's coming through and walking
[1:01:00] slowly
[1:01:01] and there was a man there that was
[1:01:03] waiting
[1:01:04] and his name was zacchaeus
[1:01:06] now zacchaeus you know thanks mommy give
[1:01:08] him to give him that name with that z
[1:01:10] you know
[1:01:11] so only not only was he short but he was
[1:01:13] always the last guy in line
[1:01:16] had a problem you know
[1:01:18] so
[1:01:19] he thought i'll get a good look at this
[1:01:21] guy i'll decide if he's you know a
[1:01:24] proper man if he's profit or whatever
[1:01:26] and so he and his wife rebecca owned a
[1:01:28] restaurant and jesus was coming through
[1:01:31] town so here's that kiosk up in the tree
[1:01:33] and he's looking down on him looking
[1:01:35] watch him come along and jesus stopped
[1:01:38] right under the tree
[1:01:40] hey zacchaeus come on down going to your
[1:01:42] house for lunch
[1:01:43] and so he went to this house for lunch
[1:01:45] and they had they had a meal
[1:01:48] and so zacchaeus was convinced he was
[1:01:50] converted now he was a tax collector
[1:01:52] okay he was the worst kind of person
[1:01:54] just like today
[1:01:55] and uh and so he says now if i've if
[1:01:58] i've heard anybody he knew who he'd hurt
[1:02:00] he had records what's his if business
[1:02:03] if i if i've done anything well i'll pay
[1:02:04] them four times and all that
[1:02:06] they know they're wrong you know
[1:02:08] there was another man that was waiting
[1:02:09] when jesus got through with lunch he's
[1:02:11] leaving
[1:02:12] um he's leaving
[1:02:14] with jericho
[1:02:16] and now back then they didn't have any
[1:02:17] planes everything everybody walked so
[1:02:19] they had walls around the cities
[1:02:22] and that was their security now uh this
[1:02:24] man
[1:02:25] bartimaeus he was blind okay probably
[1:02:28] born blind we don't know but he was
[1:02:30] sitting in the shade of the wall the sun
[1:02:33] goes out so he's in the shade
[1:02:34] and um
[1:02:36] and they didn't have german shepherd
[1:02:37] dogs so they trained this this lamb to
[1:02:40] take him over there and bring it back to
[1:02:42] the house you know so there he is
[1:02:44] begging for money there's all this noise
[1:02:46] going on
[1:02:47] and you'll find that mark chapter 10
[1:02:49] and so he's um
[1:02:51] he's he's hearing this noise and he
[1:02:53] asked his buddy what's all this noise
[1:02:54] about well is that so-called prophet
[1:02:56] jesus jesus is here why didn't you tell
[1:02:58] me
[1:02:59] and so he starts crying out son of david
[1:03:01] have mercy now there's 200 people or
[1:03:03] more and
[1:03:04] several yards away jesus probably didn't
[1:03:06] hear him but he contacted his spirit
[1:03:09] and he turned back and he healed him so
[1:03:11] this crowd is growing as they're leaving
[1:03:13] jericho and they're going up to
[1:03:14] jerusalem and when you read in the bible
[1:03:17] they went up to jerusalem because
[1:03:19] jerusalem's at 2 400 feet above sea
[1:03:20] level and jericho is uh about 500 more
[1:03:24] feet below sea level or a thousand feet
[1:03:27] so up to jerusalem uh they
[1:03:30] they climb 3600 feet in 24 miles up if
[1:03:34] you come from the coast it's also up
[1:03:36] and so
[1:03:37] the crowd's growing they're all headed
[1:03:39] for for jerusalem and so they stopped at
[1:03:41] a certain place
[1:03:43] and um
[1:03:45] jesus sent his disciples said you know a
[1:03:47] couple of steps now go over that other
[1:03:48] village and you're going to find a
[1:03:49] donkey over there
[1:03:51] and the donkey has a baby a white baby
[1:03:54] you know a foal
[1:03:56] now bring them over here if anybody says
[1:03:57] anything just tell them master has need
[1:03:59] now he didn't just make this up no
[1:04:02] 500 years before that
[1:04:05] there was a prophet in zechariah 9 9
[1:04:07] says rejoice daughter of jerusalem thy
[1:04:09] king cometh to thee
[1:04:11] yeah
[1:04:12] he's just he has salvation he's lowly
[1:04:15] that means he's humble
[1:04:17] and he's writing
[1:04:19] on a cadillac
[1:04:21] a white truck no riding on a coat
[1:04:24] just a young you know young donkey
[1:04:28] small insignificant donkey now in those
[1:04:31] 500 years see that was spoken back there
[1:04:34] when 500 years that's like from from the
[1:04:36] time martin luther until today
[1:04:38] a lot of things can happen in 500 years
[1:04:40] so some people heard this this um
[1:04:43] this prophecy they read it and so you
[1:04:46] know this farmer has a little white
[1:04:48] donkey all of a sudden
[1:04:49] well that's the one praise god this is
[1:04:51] the one well five miles away another one
[1:04:53] had a donkey and so there was a lot of
[1:04:56] argument there was a lot of
[1:04:57] interpretations
[1:04:59] imagine that but there's only one
[1:05:00] fulfillment so after that happened
[1:05:03] it's finished
[1:05:05] well this crowd is on the way to the
[1:05:07] temple okay
[1:05:08] screaming from psalm 118
[1:05:11] hosanna well now we say hosanna and in
[1:05:14] their language hostile now
[1:05:16] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:05:18] the lord they're all excited man this is
[1:05:19] the man and so forth now the romans
[1:05:22] they're the police they're watching
[1:05:23] they're supposed to be keeping order
[1:05:25] and
[1:05:26] they had no revelation
[1:05:28] and there was the pharisees now the
[1:05:30] pharisees knew their bible perfectly
[1:05:32] without an ipad right they
[1:05:34] read it they memorized it they knew what
[1:05:37] it said
[1:05:38] and to them this guy did not fulfill the
[1:05:40] scripture
[1:05:41] okay so they were waiting but they
[1:05:43] weren't waiting in love they're waiting
[1:05:45] in arrogance
[1:05:46] they were good at that
[1:05:49] waiting for an opportunity to belittle
[1:05:50] jesus
[1:05:51] the manifested word of the hour and show
[1:05:54] their bad attitude you know
[1:05:56] and so even over there in luke 19
[1:05:59] uh where this all is uh is uh written
[1:06:02] uh they jumped out in front of the
[1:06:03] parade you know master rebuked these
[1:06:06] people
[1:06:07] calm them down a bunch of fanatics what
[1:06:09] they're saying about you you know that
[1:06:11] you're not that person
[1:06:12] well he knew that he was but see they
[1:06:14] had no revelation
[1:06:16] now they knew their words the prophet's
[1:06:18] words perfectly and to their limited
[1:06:20] understanding this man didn't fit the
[1:06:23] description
[1:06:24] because they've been taught a certain
[1:06:26] way
[1:06:27] just like all of our relatives that are
[1:06:29] taught a certain way
[1:06:30] they can't accept the
[1:06:33] you know the the message of the bible
[1:06:36] somehow they imagine that that matthew
[1:06:38] 28 19 is right and that peter just kind
[1:06:41] of flubbed here in acts chapter 2 and
[1:06:43] all the rest of them all the way through
[1:06:44] acts
[1:06:45] well wait a minute what does the bible
[1:06:47] say
[1:06:48] and these are these are high standing
[1:06:50] baptists and all of them you know no
[1:06:52] revelation to so their limited
[1:06:54] understanding back then this man jesus
[1:06:56] didn't fit the description that they had
[1:06:58] learned in school
[1:06:59] they were legalists afraid that somebody
[1:07:01] was going to be happy in church
[1:07:03] scared to death that the prophet's words
[1:07:05] might be manifested and bloom out into
[1:07:07] present tense that's what they couldn't
[1:07:09] handle see
[1:07:10] and so today here we are in 2021 and all
[1:07:13] of us that are over 50 we never thought
[1:07:15] we'd see this day but here we are
[1:07:17] still walking around so we have any
[1:07:19] number of people today ready to listen
[1:07:22] and they can quote it word for word but
[1:07:24] scared to death of any fulfillment of
[1:07:26] the prophetic word
[1:07:29] they cannot say this day this scripture
[1:07:31] is fulfilled you see
[1:07:33] and um
[1:07:34] and so
[1:07:35] for a person to stand in the pope and
[1:07:37] say this is that they can't take it you
[1:07:39] see it's exactly what brother brahm
[1:07:41] talked about so jesus was waiting also
[1:07:44] he was waiting for his opportunity and
[1:07:46] he said to these uh religious scholars
[1:07:48] and boys i can make them be quiet
[1:07:50] they'll be quiet but do y'all see these
[1:07:52] rocks here
[1:07:53] if i tell them to be quiet all these
[1:07:55] rocks are gonna start screaming at the
[1:07:56] same thing
[1:07:58] and guess what the rocks are still there
[1:08:00] yeah
[1:08:01] so friends we walk by faith not by sight
[1:08:04] we don't want
[1:08:05] we're not going through this thing by
[1:08:06] what we can see
[1:08:08] it looks
[1:08:08] terrible i mean in the last 18 months
[1:08:11] the the number of suicides has gone up
[1:08:13] and all these problems because one
[1:08:15] little italian guy said we've got to do
[1:08:17] this i'm going to do that and do the
[1:08:19] other it's nonsense
[1:08:21] yes people are dying but they could have
[1:08:23] solved this a long time ago
[1:08:25] okay
[1:08:26] so
[1:08:27] we walk by faith and god does encourage
[1:08:30] us from time to time by letting us see
[1:08:32] some evidence he does answer our prayers
[1:08:35] yes
[1:08:36] no or wait a while
[1:08:39] our only desire is to please god with
[1:08:41] our thoughts our words and our deeds
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:44] and we're directed by his word and by
[1:08:46] his spirit
[1:08:48] brother abraham says you will have
[1:08:49] difficulty with this flesh until the day
[1:08:51] he calls you home oh man
[1:08:53] i thought pills was going to solve
[1:08:54] everything
[1:08:57] sorry
[1:08:58] but by grace
[1:09:00] by the grace of god every believer will
[1:09:02] overcome okay
[1:09:04] so how are we going to overcome this
[1:09:06] dark world is falling apart
[1:09:09] scripture says and they overcame him the
[1:09:11] evil one by the blood of the lamb and by
[1:09:14] the word of their testimony
[1:09:16] everybody's got a testimony
[1:09:18] that combined with the blood that's how
[1:09:20] we overcome you see
[1:09:22] that's in your testimony it's what you
[1:09:24] manifest
[1:09:26] so just what are you reflecting here in
[1:09:28] dark laodicea
[1:09:30] what exactly are you feeding on
[1:09:34] did you take time from tv to come to
[1:09:35] church well it's going to take a lot
[1:09:37] more in church to solve your problem you
[1:09:39] see
[1:09:40] are you balanced john 4 23 is where
[1:09:43] jesus met the woman at the well and
[1:09:45] brother bram mentions it's just battery
[1:09:47] tape
[1:09:48] and
[1:09:49] you know she thought she had it together
[1:09:51] but he said look honey you all don't
[1:09:53] know what you're talking about salvation
[1:09:54] is of the jews but god is looking for
[1:09:56] those that will worship him in spirit
[1:09:58] and in truth
[1:10:00] we can have a lot of spirit
[1:10:03] you know and beat those drones until
[1:10:04] they fall apart
[1:10:06] with no truth you're not going to work
[1:10:08] you can have all kinds of truth and have
[1:10:10] the doctrine perfect and no spirit
[1:10:12] you're still out you got to be balanced
[1:10:16] okay
[1:10:17] so what do your children see in you you
[1:10:19] know children record everything
[1:10:22] yeah from about the
[1:10:23] you know six months they should start
[1:10:25] recording it all you know
[1:10:26] and um
[1:10:28] what does your wife see in you she's the
[1:10:30] one that knows you best uh what does
[1:10:32] your unconverted neighbor see in you
[1:10:35] see we're on display all the time
[1:10:38] you know
[1:10:39] um
[1:10:40] the
[1:10:40] there was a man in the catholic church
[1:10:42] by the name of francis of assists
[1:10:45] if
[1:10:45] any of you was raised catholic you
[1:10:47] probably remember that name well brother
[1:10:48] brown said he was a preacher of the
[1:10:51] gospel preacher
[1:10:52] and
[1:10:53] he said one day 900 years ago he said
[1:10:57] preach always
[1:10:59] use words when necessary
[1:11:01] well how do we do that
[1:11:02] well brother brown said it very simply
[1:11:04] live your message
[1:11:07] your neighbors aren't interested in what
[1:11:09] william branham said that is the least
[1:11:10] of their problems they're watching you
[1:11:13] they're watching to see if your life
[1:11:14] matches what you say because today we
[1:11:17] all got this cell phone so blah blah
[1:11:19] blah blah and eventually that doesn't
[1:11:21] balance out without what we're doing
[1:11:23] it's got to come in balance right here
[1:11:26] so just live your message
[1:11:28] then if there's something in them they
[1:11:30] will ask yes why do you have long hair
[1:11:33] why do you do this why do you do that
[1:11:35] and then we can point him to the word
[1:11:37] you can't bring him to the pastor every
[1:11:38] time you got to know that you've been
[1:11:40] here more than six months you've got to
[1:11:41] have something on the mall
[1:11:42] so if you live your message they will
[1:11:45] ask questions
[1:11:46] now in second peter chapter one we have
[1:11:49] also a more sure word of prophecy under
[1:11:51] which you do well that you take heed in
[1:11:52] other words you must do it as unto a
[1:11:55] light that shineth in a dark place until
[1:11:57] the day star arrives in your hearts so
[1:12:00] we got to stay balanced we got to stay
[1:12:02] ready
[1:12:03] we've got to stay in step with the beat
[1:12:05] the rhythm of the pure gospel of jesus
[1:12:08] christ
[1:12:10] and you must maintain the vertical
[1:12:11] connection okay
[1:12:14] now in this message where's it at 65 uh
[1:12:17] where is it february 17 to 65. okay this
[1:12:19] is very important
[1:12:21] now i was you know i've lived through
[1:12:23] all of this
[1:12:24] and back then brother branham had made
[1:12:26] uh
[1:12:27] he had a lot of questions about marriage
[1:12:28] and divorce because some people was
[1:12:30] messed up so he kept promising okay so
[1:12:32] now he's going to be in jeffersonville
[1:12:34] february of 65
[1:12:36] and
[1:12:37] he's got four messages that he's going
[1:12:39] to preach and then sunday morning he's
[1:12:40] going to be marriage and divorce so
[1:12:42] everybody's there
[1:12:43] well he drove by himself kids were in
[1:12:45] school you know everything so he drove
[1:12:48] all the way back there now when brother
[1:12:50] and drove by himself
[1:12:52] sometimes
[1:12:53] there's no lie
[1:12:54] sometimes he would get his notepad out
[1:12:57] and he'd start writing put his glasses
[1:12:59] on and the car was going by itself
[1:13:01] turn whatever yeah that happened so
[1:13:04] anyway he gets there
[1:13:05] uh i think he drove straight through
[1:13:08] so he got there some sometime wednesday
[1:13:10] morning church is gonna be thursday
[1:13:11] friday thursday friday saturday and
[1:13:13] sunday so he gets the early wednesday
[1:13:16] and um he's you know cleaned up and he
[1:13:19] says well i can't just stay up the house
[1:13:20] all those people down there at church so
[1:13:22] he goes down thinking he'll you know
[1:13:24] just have some fellowship well brother
[1:13:25] neville saw him come in
[1:13:28] brother bill
[1:13:29] up here
[1:13:30] well he doesn't have anything
[1:13:32] he just came down to have fellowship and
[1:13:34] that's when he preached this great
[1:13:36] message a man running from the presence
[1:13:38] of the lord
[1:13:39] so
[1:13:40] he says i i believe we have truth
[1:13:43] i'm satisfied of that and i believe the
[1:13:45] wheat absolutely the shuck is pulling
[1:13:47] away from it clear back there that was
[1:13:49] that was starting to happen see
[1:13:51] so we don't have to wonder we don't have
[1:13:53] to question if this is true or not it is
[1:13:56] true it's scripture
[1:13:58] it's not like my friends in salt lake
[1:13:59] city that have to you know massage it
[1:14:02] and kind of add some things to it no we
[1:14:04] believe the scriptures
[1:14:06] you see
[1:14:07] god says so and he's admit he's
[1:14:09] vindicated and he's still vindicating it
[1:14:12] there's people being baptized every day
[1:14:15] in africa and in brazil in these places
[1:14:18] and it's it's happening even after all
[1:14:20] these years this doesn't depend on
[1:14:22] brother branham being here
[1:14:23] we have god's word it's opened it up to
[1:14:26] us you see
[1:14:27] so god continues to vindicate the truth
[1:14:30] in many countries many languages
[1:14:33] so we should respect this ministry and
[1:14:35] not lean to our own understanding
[1:14:38] and try to figure it out and correct all
[1:14:40] the things we don't like
[1:14:41] no we don't have time for that stuff no
[1:14:44] um
[1:14:45] the scripture says in in psalm 46 10 be
[1:14:48] still i'm god
[1:14:50] got it all in control
[1:14:52] just follow you know so we got to stay
[1:14:55] in balance to avoid extremes
[1:14:58] yes brother brown says it took the
[1:15:00] catholics two thousand years to get
[1:15:01] where they are today
[1:15:03] and took pentecostal people 50 years to
[1:15:05] get to the same place
[1:15:08] now all you mathematicians know that
[1:15:11] brother rem's been gone 55 years
[1:15:15] it puts us in a pretty bad shape
[1:15:17] we got idolatry amongst us you know
[1:15:20] and so
[1:15:22] um we're in worse conditions sometimes
[1:15:24] and it's not the fault of the matter of
[1:15:26] the messenger it's because we've got
[1:15:28] unbalanced teaching
[1:15:30] unbalanced preaching a lot of noise and
[1:15:32] no
[1:15:33] substance
[1:15:35] so imagine building this church without
[1:15:37] a level you got to have one of these no
[1:15:39] matter what you're doing right you know
[1:15:41] these nice cars you got out here you
[1:15:42] take them to the tire shop and they put
[1:15:44] on the machine and they take a 50 cent
[1:15:46] piece of lead and they tack it on a
[1:15:48] certain place now you got a smooth ride
[1:15:50] so if you go taking it off it's going to
[1:15:52] be trouble so we got to have balance
[1:15:54] okay
[1:15:55] um
[1:15:58] so i've traveled to many countries and i
[1:16:00] was looking the other day in 2010 which
[1:16:03] was a long time ago but i visited 18
[1:16:05] countries
[1:16:06] i can't go anywhere right now
[1:16:08] so god has me coming up here and i'll be
[1:16:10] back
[1:16:11] promise me back on a sunday i promise
[1:16:14] but um
[1:16:15] so i've been in a lot of places okay
[1:16:17] i've seen extremes i've seen where
[1:16:20] candles are part of some people's
[1:16:22] worship
[1:16:24] that are following this message there's
[1:16:26] people in south america right now that
[1:16:28] have candles in front of william
[1:16:29] branham's picture
[1:16:31] they didn't
[1:16:32] change they just changed pictures you
[1:16:33] know
[1:16:34] yeah
[1:16:36] so
[1:16:36] um how do good people arrive at extremes
[1:16:40] by not saying what paul said that's
[1:16:42] right we got we got paul's words over
[1:16:44] here in
[1:16:45] in galatians 1 8 where he says
[1:16:48] he's in starting in verse 6 i'm marvel
[1:16:50] that you're so soon removed from him
[1:16:53] that called you into grace of christ and
[1:16:55] to another gospel amen
[1:16:58] semicolon which is not another
[1:17:01] but there be some among you and we got
[1:17:03] them today that trouble you and would
[1:17:06] pervert the gospel of christ
[1:17:09] but if i come back next week or even if
[1:17:11] an angel comes down
[1:17:13] okay
[1:17:14] and preaches something different than
[1:17:15] what i've already given you by
[1:17:17] revelation he's accursed
[1:17:20] but see we're so uh forgiving and we
[1:17:23] don't want to hurt anybody's feelings so
[1:17:25] if if somebody comes in this church and
[1:17:27] starts you know
[1:17:29] saying that william brandwell really
[1:17:30] wasn't a messenger and starts putting
[1:17:32] doubt you throw him out right but they
[1:17:35] can come in another guy can come in and
[1:17:36] start making it bigger than it really is
[1:17:38] and we accept that you know it's got to
[1:17:40] be balanced
[1:17:42] you see
[1:17:43] and so therefore they cannot
[1:17:45] ever produce the fruit of the word they
[1:17:48] can only produce fruit of their leaders
[1:17:50] opinions and unbalanced explanations
[1:17:53] now god is not nervous he's got a
[1:17:55] schedule everything's working out
[1:17:57] perfectly
[1:18:00] ephesians 4 11 through 16 is one
[1:18:02] sentence we're not going to read it
[1:18:03] today but you can check it out later
[1:18:05] so these ministries that god has put
[1:18:06] into the church they're god ordained god
[1:18:09] placed and god vindicated and they work
[1:18:12] in harmony okay they're walking in step
[1:18:15] with the messenger of the age under the
[1:18:17] same anointing
[1:18:18] that way uh it's it's important that you
[1:18:21] listen to what the messenger said
[1:18:23] that way you know something's going
[1:18:26] in the right way or not so the solution
[1:18:28] is back to the sure word of prophecy
[1:18:31] the original
[1:18:32] proverbs 3 5 lean not to your own
[1:18:34] understanding because it will fail every
[1:18:36] time
[1:18:37] so extremes are very dangerous we've got
[1:18:40] to stay in tune we've got to stay in
[1:18:42] step with god's program this entire
[1:18:44] package of 1200 tapes that we have we
[1:18:46] call the message it's only the vehicle
[1:18:48] that brings us back to the open book
[1:18:50] the message doesn't stand over here by
[1:18:52] itself and only us is going to go to
[1:18:54] heaven
[1:18:54] god's got people everywhere and he
[1:18:56] doesn't need our opinion about it you
[1:18:58] know
[1:18:59] so may god help us
[1:19:03] in the message great servant moses 1955
[1:19:06] and as moses went with the judgment
[1:19:08] stick before him
[1:19:10] that same stick tonight to the church is
[1:19:12] jesus christ if those egyptians could
[1:19:14] ever got that little simple stick out of
[1:19:16] moses hands they would have had him
[1:19:18] whipped
[1:19:19] and when the devil
[1:19:21] can ever get the deity out of the name
[1:19:23] of jesus christ he's got the church whip
[1:19:26] and that's why we have powerless groups
[1:19:28] of people everywhere
[1:19:30] that because they've taken the deity out
[1:19:32] of jesus christ and put it in this
[1:19:33] organization and this man somewhere else
[1:19:36] god's not pleased
[1:19:38] and god doesn't judge you know
[1:19:40] every saturday no he lets it go see
[1:19:42] god's got a lot more patience than we do
[1:19:44] right it's up to me i had to wipe the
[1:19:46] whole thing off a long time ago but god
[1:19:48] has patience he lets things go on and on
[1:19:51] and on and he's watching how people
[1:19:53] react to the whole thing see
[1:19:56] so
[1:19:57] there were forces in the days of william
[1:19:59] branham and their forces today
[1:20:01] to separate the deity out of christ
[1:20:04] it only causes confusion causes doubt
[1:20:07] and takes the people away from jesus
[1:20:08] christ and they mislocate the deity into
[1:20:11] a person a ministry or group
[1:20:14] and god is not pleased our god doesn't
[1:20:16] share his glory with anybody
[1:20:18] no god doesn't share his glory even
[1:20:21] brother branham after years of ministry
[1:20:23] and who knows how many thousands of
[1:20:24] people been healed all these great
[1:20:26] mysteries been revealed
[1:20:27] he would say now if god will come and
[1:20:30] bless us tonight
[1:20:32] he didn't have a push button ministry
[1:20:33] because he said so no he was he was
[1:20:36] humble
[1:20:37] so we're we've lived long enough now to
[1:20:39] see the results of some of these
[1:20:41] misguided ministries and failure is
[1:20:43] right ahead
[1:20:45] we do have one example and now this is
[1:20:48] extreme
[1:20:49] but uh we're dealing with reality and so
[1:20:51] over in the in the congo in africa
[1:20:54] there's a lot of people over there a lot
[1:20:56] of so-called believers you talk about
[1:20:58] church you know 15 000 people were you
[1:21:00] gonna have a percentage of believers
[1:21:02] make believers and unbelievers it's just
[1:21:04] that way
[1:21:05] and so there was a man that uh he was
[1:21:08] you know supposedly a believer and he
[1:21:10] got so
[1:21:13] sidetracked and so anointed in the wrong
[1:21:15] direction that he was preaching to a
[1:21:17] bunch of people under a tree one day
[1:21:19] and so he um
[1:21:21] he said now
[1:21:23] william branham is god's prophet and
[1:21:25] he's higher than jesus christ you know
[1:21:27] it is much more important than jesus
[1:21:29] christ and so he took the huffman's head
[1:21:31] of you know the picture he ripped it and
[1:21:33] he stepped on it he said i'm not telling
[1:21:35] the truth my god strike me dead and
[1:21:37] right now he died
[1:21:39] i mean there's he's pot he's dead so
[1:21:42] they
[1:21:43] they saw wow this is real so they got
[1:21:45] him loaded up on a bicycle or something
[1:21:47] they're going to take him over to his
[1:21:48] village to bury him
[1:21:50] the worms were already eating him they
[1:21:52] had to bury him on the way
[1:21:54] you don't mess with god
[1:21:58] isaiah 40 31
[1:22:00] speaks to us about waiting
[1:22:03] they that wait now that's not everybody
[1:22:05] but those that wait on the lord shall
[1:22:06] renew their strength they shall mount up
[1:22:08] with wings as eagles they shall run and
[1:22:10] not be weary they'll walk and not faint
[1:22:14] so one of god's favorite methods of
[1:22:16] preparing
[1:22:18] us for something great is to send us
[1:22:20] into the shadows to wait okay but that
[1:22:23] doesn't mean that you're doomed to
[1:22:25] terminal darkness
[1:22:27] take heart from this british author his
[1:22:29] name is james stalker he said waiting is
[1:22:32] a common instrument of providential
[1:22:34] discipline
[1:22:35] for those
[1:22:37] to whom exceptional work has been
[1:22:39] appointed
[1:22:40] we shall come up with that but it's true
[1:22:43] now the book of esther for example for
[1:22:45] example in the old testament
[1:22:47] you need to read it this week it's a
[1:22:49] great love story
[1:22:50] about god's providential care how he
[1:22:52] cared for his people okay
[1:22:55] he he does care for his own all ages
[1:22:58] everywhere
[1:22:59] and it's the only book in the bible
[1:23:00] where god's not even mentioned
[1:23:02] you know
[1:23:03] i think one other book but god's not
[1:23:05] mentioned in this book
[1:23:06] and
[1:23:07] there's not one mention of it in the in
[1:23:09] the new testament esther was just
[1:23:10] another
[1:23:11] jewish girl got taken away prisoner
[1:23:15] to persia which is iran today
[1:23:18] but by god's choice things worked around
[1:23:20] she became queen okay
[1:23:22] and god blessed her to deliver the
[1:23:24] jewish people
[1:23:26] um from destruction
[1:23:28] showing that god is always in control
[1:23:30] i know some of this looks disjointed to
[1:23:32] you but you can chew on it next week
[1:23:33] you'll find out that god's footed
[1:23:34] together
[1:23:35] so she was another believer that waited
[1:23:38] in chapter 4 verse 16 she came to her
[1:23:40] hour of decision okay
[1:23:42] and there seems to be a blank space in
[1:23:45] the three days
[1:23:46] from verse 17 to chapter five uh verse
[1:23:50] one nothing's recorded of the drama
[1:23:52] nothing's happening it was during this
[1:23:54] time that she was fasting
[1:23:57] and she was praying and she was seeking
[1:23:59] the mind of jehovah getting ready for no
[1:24:01] doubt
[1:24:02] and reading these words of prophet
[1:24:04] isaiah from 300 years earlier in chapter
[1:24:06] 41 where it says fear thou not
[1:24:09] i am with thee be not dismayed i am thy
[1:24:12] god i will strengthen the yea i will
[1:24:14] help thee i will uphold thee with the
[1:24:16] right hand of my righteousness
[1:24:18] verse 11 behold all they that are
[1:24:21] incensed against thee
[1:24:23] shall be ashamed and confounded they
[1:24:25] shall be as nothing and they that strive
[1:24:27] with thee shall perish
[1:24:29] so she found her identification in the
[1:24:32] word
[1:24:33] not in somebody's ideas you see so when
[1:24:36] the believer in our age that we live in
[1:24:39] is in tune with the spirit of god that
[1:24:41] believer can identify with the portion
[1:24:44] that applies and you will see how god
[1:24:46] will make it come alive in your life
[1:24:48] in your particular circumstances it
[1:24:50] works okay
[1:24:52] as you as an individual so you may be
[1:24:55] going through some dark days you might
[1:24:56] be going through whatever trial you know
[1:24:58] we all have problems and um it would
[1:25:00] seem that nothing's happening
[1:25:03] but it's during those times that you
[1:25:05] need balance you gotta get it straight
[1:25:07] you see reading god's word and you and
[1:25:11] every individual can create your own
[1:25:13] personal
[1:25:14] private atmosphere
[1:25:17] i've been on planes people doing all
[1:25:19] kinds of things but i'm over here
[1:25:20] concentrating on the word just to create
[1:25:22] my own atmosphere you know
[1:25:24] it's that time when you need to pull
[1:25:25] back i'm not rushing into this uncertain
[1:25:28] situation no
[1:25:29] i have no direction can't find my way i
[1:25:32] believe i'll just wait and see what god
[1:25:34] directs and what he says
[1:25:36] now rarely does he going to give you a
[1:25:38] cloud formation over your house it's
[1:25:40] probably not going to happen
[1:25:41] and you're looking for something over
[1:25:43] here and you're just really striving
[1:25:45] where is that thing and then for some
[1:25:46] reason you got to look oh here it is
[1:25:48] right here
[1:25:49] happens every time
[1:25:50] you know
[1:25:51] so all you had to do was wait now let's
[1:25:54] see what brother adam says here in the
[1:25:56] god of this evil age
[1:25:57] which was
[1:25:59] the first of august of 1965. now if you
[1:26:02] notice but you know every so many years
[1:26:04] the same
[1:26:05] dates follow the same days and 2021 is
[1:26:09] the same days as 1965.
[1:26:11] so we had august the first sunday we'll
[1:26:13] have august 1st sunday back there
[1:26:15] he says here she the bride is part of
[1:26:18] the groom
[1:26:20] true to him in every point waiting for
[1:26:22] the wedding supper waiting for the
[1:26:24] wedding the uniting not at that
[1:26:26] communical council but in the sky at the
[1:26:28] wedding supper she has been given and
[1:26:30] has been revealed to her the seven seal
[1:26:32] mysteries of the bible
[1:26:34] okay um
[1:26:36] she sees the folly of the deceiver so
[1:26:39] she's watching both angles she sees the
[1:26:41] the truth she sees the deceiver okay
[1:26:44] um so very close to the truth
[1:26:47] almost deceives the elected she sees it
[1:26:50] she um she sees the two opposing spirits
[1:26:53] that work in this simple age can you see
[1:26:54] it each very religious
[1:26:57] we have cain and abel those spirits
[1:26:59] again coming to their heads to full
[1:27:00] manifestation
[1:27:02] still the same as they started
[1:27:04] so there's no change they're just
[1:27:05] maturing you see
[1:27:07] one worshiping by beauty by knowledge
[1:27:10] education science ethics
[1:27:13] all sounds great and let's go for it
[1:27:16] the other one
[1:27:17] by faith of the revelation of the word
[1:27:19] of god oh that's better
[1:27:22] that means you know that you know and he
[1:27:24] said both of them are standing in this
[1:27:26] building this morning
[1:27:28] i was there that sunday he baptized me
[1:27:30] the next day now
[1:27:33] so just because people come to church
[1:27:35] and make some kind of sacrifice and give
[1:27:37] tithes and offerings that's
[1:27:39] normal but how many are living the
[1:27:41] gospel
[1:27:43] the other one by the faith of the
[1:27:45] revelation of the word of god that's
[1:27:47] right this one is a prostitute the bible
[1:27:49] says she's the mother of harlots
[1:27:51] and they all come together and that kind
[1:27:54] of a woman is a woman that's untrue to
[1:27:55] her husband and claiming christ as her
[1:27:58] husband and belonging to a denomination
[1:28:00] such nonsense saying we belong to christ
[1:28:03] okay
[1:28:03] world's full of them but in obedience
[1:28:06] this little faith woman that lives by
[1:28:08] faith the bride a person here over there
[1:28:11] somewhere else some other denomination
[1:28:12] wherever she is she believes the word of
[1:28:15] god
[1:28:16] she's obedient waiting in love for the
[1:28:18] promise of the age to be confirmed
[1:28:22] now if you're waiting for something to
[1:28:23] be confirmed you've got to know what
[1:28:25] that is
[1:28:27] okay
[1:28:28] you can't just be sitting on the porch
[1:28:29] waiting for the check no you gotta gotta
[1:28:31] know what it's all about
[1:28:33] she is watching for it she is part of
[1:28:35] that word and she's watching for her
[1:28:37] life to manifest that word
[1:28:39] that's what she's watching for don't
[1:28:41] worry about everybody else myself
[1:28:44] so
[1:28:46] she's not looking for flaws in others
[1:28:47] she's not looking for doctrinal
[1:28:49] differences qualifying everybody by my
[1:28:51] limited understanding
[1:28:53] you know
[1:28:54] i mean i don't know why all this stuff
[1:28:56] in afghanistan i'm not in charge i don't
[1:28:59] understand what they're doing i just
[1:29:00] know that we're going to leave soon
[1:29:02] you know they're polishing up the plane
[1:29:04] they're fueling the plane it's about
[1:29:05] ready to leave
[1:29:06] but you got to get ready
[1:29:08] so if anything is out of order just wait
[1:29:12] god will bring the correction at the
[1:29:14] right time and with the right spirit
[1:29:16] we usually make a big mess out of it if
[1:29:18] we try to correct stuff you know
[1:29:19] so he says she's watching for her life
[1:29:22] to manifest that word so she has to know
[1:29:25] the word so that she'll know when it's
[1:29:26] manifested so we belong in the word
[1:29:30] they asked brother brandon you know 60
[1:29:31] years ago how can i be a better
[1:29:33] christian see people like a set of rules
[1:29:35] do this this you're in no read your word
[1:29:38] your bible and pray oh we already knew
[1:29:41] that well then do it
[1:29:43] you know
[1:29:46] so she's not out slamming everybody you
[1:29:47] know correcting everybody she's waiting
[1:29:50] in love for the promise of the age to be
[1:29:52] confirmed
[1:29:53] watching for her life to manifest that
[1:29:56] word
[1:29:57] so
[1:29:59] may god help us
[1:30:01] now after all this
[1:30:03] traveling and everything
[1:30:04] life i've lived i found this one thing
[1:30:07] to be true illustrious preaching does
[1:30:09] not always translate into victorious
[1:30:11] living
[1:30:13] i know preachers man they can preach the
[1:30:15] house down but then you go from here to
[1:30:17] the hotel and somebody pulls out they're
[1:30:19] ready to shoot him
[1:30:20] wait a minute
[1:30:21] what happened
[1:30:24] no
[1:30:24] brother branham
[1:30:26] lived what he preached
[1:30:28] now he was you know he was no pushover
[1:30:31] but i wasn't attracted to this message
[1:30:33] by the miracles and oh wow that's
[1:30:35] wonderful no
[1:30:37] i was attracted because here's a man
[1:30:38] that was living the word of god i'd
[1:30:41] already read my bible i knew what it
[1:30:43] said in some places you know i didn't
[1:30:45] know it all but i knew the spirit of the
[1:30:47] bible it's like brother bram says he he
[1:30:49] read about uh oh is it um
[1:30:51] uh
[1:30:52] tarzan and he want to be like tarzan you
[1:30:54] know i live in trees well i i'd read my
[1:30:57] bible i knew what the spirit of the
[1:30:58] bible was and now here's a man that's
[1:31:00] living that spirit you know
[1:31:03] so
[1:31:04] um william branham didn't uh waste any
[1:31:06] time
[1:31:07] pounding and slamming all those that
[1:31:09] didn't
[1:31:10] believe it just like he did
[1:31:12] if he was only going to go out and visit
[1:31:13] those who believed it like him he'd have
[1:31:15] never left the corner
[1:31:17] but people wanted to see the miracles
[1:31:18] they want to see the gift and he went
[1:31:20] and preached the truth so
[1:31:22] can you see yourself in this word that's
[1:31:25] the question for today you know can we
[1:31:27] see ourself in the mirror of the word
[1:31:29] god gives you the peace that goes way
[1:31:31] beyond all the things you can understand
[1:31:34] way beyond the religious fanaticism the
[1:31:36] legalism the peace of god is in harmony
[1:31:39] with the spirit of the scriptures
[1:31:42] the bible says in romans 8 28 all things
[1:31:44] work together not just sitting here but
[1:31:47] out there tomorrow all things work
[1:31:49] together for good to them that love god
[1:31:51] and to them that are called according to
[1:31:53] his purpose two requirements so don't
[1:31:55] waste your time or the pastor's time
[1:31:58] trying to figure things out
[1:31:59] it doesn't work
[1:32:01] no just relax
[1:32:03] wait in love for the manifestation of
[1:32:05] the promise in your life and while you
[1:32:08] wait prayer is very important
[1:32:10] we're almost done
[1:32:12] in a message jesus christ the same in
[1:32:14] chicago the devils tremble when the
[1:32:16] weakest of saints goes to their knees
[1:32:18] what a power and a privilege has been
[1:32:19] given to the church of the living god
[1:32:21] when you follow your knees in prayer
[1:32:23] even the devils tremble
[1:32:26] and the devil knows when it's just from
[1:32:28] the teeth out
[1:32:29] he can tell if it's real or not you know
[1:32:31] so brother brown had to wait he had to
[1:32:33] be obedient he had to walk by faith
[1:32:35] every day
[1:32:36] when he was getting ready to preach the
[1:32:38] seven seals you know they rebuilt the
[1:32:39] church remodeled it and so he's back
[1:32:42] there and he talks about that but anyway
[1:32:44] when he's on the way to the pulpit for
[1:32:45] the first service
[1:32:47] he came by billy's office he said
[1:32:48] ability you need to pray for dad
[1:32:50] i don't have any idea what we tell these
[1:32:52] people
[1:32:54] he's already invited them all they're
[1:32:55] all there great expectation but he had
[1:32:57] to walk by faith you see
[1:33:00] in the message the new ministry of 1959
[1:33:03] that you might know that the sovereign
[1:33:05] grace reigns with god did you know that
[1:33:07] those two boys and sister had his two
[1:33:09] boys that woman's children that were
[1:33:10] saved god knew that before the
[1:33:12] foundation of the world and their names
[1:33:14] were actually put on the lamb's book of
[1:33:16] life before the foundation of the world
[1:33:18] and your children and you it was all
[1:33:19] done back there you see
[1:33:21] the bible says that and it only had to
[1:33:23] work down to this minute in other words
[1:33:25] there's a time for things to manifest
[1:33:27] you see
[1:33:29] and um
[1:33:31] and so god he says did you know that god
[1:33:32] knew we would be standing here 10
[1:33:34] million years before the world was
[1:33:35] founded
[1:33:37] did you know that he knew we'd be
[1:33:39] standing here the infinite sea of god
[1:33:41] that's opposite of being finite
[1:33:45] of god knew every fly every gnat
[1:33:48] so every mosquito every cockroach
[1:33:50] everything you know how many times they
[1:33:52] would bat their eyes
[1:33:53] and how much towel that would produce
[1:33:56] excuse me just a minute
[1:34:00] well i might get this off
[1:34:03] help
[1:34:09] thank you
[1:34:11] yeah so god knew all these things right
[1:34:17] before the world was formed he knew all
[1:34:19] that how many cockroaches how many times
[1:34:21] they would bat their eyes
[1:34:25] he says here
[1:34:26] well if if he knows that
[1:34:29] then why are you preaching that's part
[1:34:31] of god's program preaching is his
[1:34:34] program
[1:34:37] so
[1:34:38] if you listen close enough you'll find
[1:34:40] that all your
[1:34:42] problems are solved within brother
[1:34:44] brown's message
[1:34:45] he covers it all
[1:34:46] so he says preaching is his program when
[1:34:48] he looked on the apostles and he looked
[1:34:50] upon the harvest he said you know the
[1:34:52] harvest is right but the laborers are
[1:34:54] few
[1:34:55] pray to the lord of the harvest and he
[1:34:56] will send laborers into his harvest
[1:34:59] he says why would they have to pray to
[1:35:01] the lord of the harvest to send laborers
[1:35:04] into his harvest if the lord of the
[1:35:05] harvest was standing there knowing how
[1:35:07] it would be done
[1:35:08] great question
[1:35:10] he says god has so arranged it all that
[1:35:13] his program cannot move without you and
[1:35:15] me
[1:35:18] and as long as we're not doing what god
[1:35:19] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:35:22] program
[1:35:23] but when the church moves by the
[1:35:24] anointing of the holy ghost then we're
[1:35:26] in god's will doing this program
[1:35:29] very simple
[1:35:30] so
[1:35:32] you know many times we rehearsed the
[1:35:33] story of abraham and sarah right and
[1:35:36] they were they were living down in
[1:35:38] hebron
[1:35:39] and there's a big oak tree there
[1:35:41] remember all that
[1:35:42] the tree's still there they got records
[1:35:44] of 5 000 years of that tree
[1:35:46] when i was there in 84 they still had
[1:35:48] green leaves on it
[1:35:49] so
[1:35:52] they waited in love
[1:35:54] not knowing it would be 25 years it
[1:35:57] thought it'd be next month
[1:35:58] he kept asking you know all that
[1:36:00] so they returned back young for one
[1:36:02] purpose
[1:36:04] that the word of god would be fulfilled
[1:36:07] god can do anything so he says over here
[1:36:11] in this one message he showed in abraham
[1:36:13] and sarah what he's going to do to you
[1:36:15] and your wife one of these days turn you
[1:36:17] back
[1:36:18] young again
[1:36:19] we are the seed of we are the seed of
[1:36:21] abraham on our road to the promise
[1:36:24] now mine's already turned back she's
[1:36:26] waiting for me
[1:36:28] i got to behave because i want to go
[1:36:31] so um there's a friend of mine had a
[1:36:33] dream about three years ago
[1:36:36] now when rebecca was very sick
[1:36:38] i'll just put this in here we got time
[1:36:40] right
[1:36:46] um
[1:36:47] she wasn't just anybody this is somebody
[1:36:49] lived with william brennan for 19 years
[1:36:51] she knew what faith was it's all
[1:36:52] miracles and so forth
[1:36:54] and then she got stuck with me
[1:36:56] but um
[1:36:57] so when she's real sick i said now now
[1:37:00] honey god can
[1:37:01] heal you make you brand new in the next
[1:37:02] 10 minutes you know that but if he
[1:37:05] chooses to take you which we have no you
[1:37:07] know
[1:37:08] we have no uh
[1:37:10] promise of any kind but if he chooses to
[1:37:12] take you
[1:37:13] then find your dad and wait for me there
[1:37:16] well as turned out that's what happened
[1:37:18] and so then just about two years ago
[1:37:21] um
[1:37:22] this uh brother had a dream he called me
[1:37:24] he was talking about it now
[1:37:26] he only speaks spanish
[1:37:28] and we're talking but in the dream he
[1:37:30] says i was in heaven
[1:37:32] and so in heaven he's he's talking to
[1:37:34] william random this is his dream
[1:37:36] and so they're talking and um and so one
[1:37:39] of the questions that he he asked he
[1:37:42] said brother brown uh down there where i
[1:37:44] live a lot of people say you've got to
[1:37:45] come back and do all these things
[1:37:47] he got real stern he said look i have
[1:37:50] said everything i have to say
[1:37:52] but if i was to come back you know the
[1:37:53] way they want i'd have to take a few
[1:37:55] people to the woodshed
[1:37:58] and you didn't mention my name okay
[1:38:03] so
[1:38:04] so he's talking to him and he notices
[1:38:06] this young girl is standing on you know
[1:38:08] they're hooked onto his arm
[1:38:11] he looked real close ah that's rebecca
[1:38:13] of course and so she gives him a big
[1:38:15] smile and she said tell george i'm
[1:38:17] waiting right where he told me
[1:38:19] so it is real
[1:38:23] well
[1:38:24] let's see if we can finish up here real
[1:38:26] quick
[1:38:26] um
[1:38:30] you know that in the one message in 1963
[1:38:33] some greeks had seen a reflection of
[1:38:35] jesus and some of the believers
[1:38:37] but they want to see the real man
[1:38:38] you know if they see you on the on the
[1:38:40] street someplace yeah but where do you
[1:38:41] go to church we want to we'll have what
[1:38:43] you have so they wanted to see him and
[1:38:45] brother brown says some greeks had heard
[1:38:48] now they wanted to see jesus
[1:38:50] they had heard now they wanted to see
[1:38:52] him they didn't want to see a lecturer
[1:38:53] you know all the boards perfectly some
[1:38:56] pulpit clown now why would he use this
[1:38:58] term back in 63
[1:38:59] because there are such
[1:39:02] not some entertainer they want to see
[1:39:04] him jesus christ
[1:39:06] he says god doesn't send entertainers he
[1:39:08] sends preachers to preach his word
[1:39:10] it's all through the message
[1:39:12] so we have the example of the
[1:39:15] of the uh executive of the armor meat
[1:39:17] company remember
[1:39:18] so this guy
[1:39:20] you know he finally decided he wanted a
[1:39:21] wife want to settle down and so his
[1:39:24] company owned some ranches out west and
[1:39:26] so he goes out west looking for a bride
[1:39:28] well they heard he was coming so they
[1:39:30] fixed up the place you know and when he
[1:39:31] got there well they've had all the
[1:39:32] amazon stuff coming it looks just like
[1:39:33] it was back home
[1:39:35] big deal
[1:39:36] and so they had entertainment and
[1:39:37] everything well he'd left all that
[1:39:39] behind but he was looking for something
[1:39:41] genuine
[1:39:43] now if you go to cracker barrel
[1:39:46] and you look at the pictures real
[1:39:47] closely
[1:39:49] they didn't marry the women back then
[1:39:51] because they were
[1:39:52] beautiful they married him because they
[1:39:54] could work
[1:39:57] i mean it's just facts
[1:39:59] and so
[1:40:00] and so this
[1:40:04] thank you guys thank you
[1:40:06] um this this guy was looking for a real
[1:40:10] a real worker somebody that he could
[1:40:11] depend on you know
[1:40:14] and so he'd been through all this stuff
[1:40:15] so on the last day they're putting on
[1:40:16] the big party and uh he noticed this one
[1:40:19] girl he hadn't seen all week
[1:40:21] and she was carrying out the water
[1:40:23] because they didn't have faucets you
[1:40:24] know you bring it in and take it out
[1:40:27] and so um he followed her out and you
[1:40:29] know the whole story right he goes out
[1:40:31] there
[1:40:32] and he says do you know why i'm here you
[1:40:34] know who i am yeah we know you are
[1:40:35] you're looking for a wife yeah he says
[1:40:37] i've seen all your your relatives in
[1:40:39] there but god has spoken to me and says
[1:40:41] you're the one no but i just got this
[1:40:43] one dress and i don't have any shoes and
[1:40:44] i've got this calluses and i've got
[1:40:46] problems
[1:40:47] god told me you're the one well just
[1:40:49] like brother samuel did one day he
[1:40:50] convinced her you know that she's the
[1:40:52] one
[1:40:53] and so
[1:40:54] he made her a promise i'll be back one
[1:40:57] year from today
[1:40:59] august 20 right
[1:41:01] there's a 19.
[1:41:05] yeah so august 19 i'll be back
[1:41:07] and um
[1:41:09] and all she had to do was get ready
[1:41:10] right she had to wait and get ready and
[1:41:13] she waited in love
[1:41:15] and she suffered ridicule and
[1:41:17] persecution because guess what he left
[1:41:19] and so the next day she had to get up
[1:41:21] early set the table get the croissants
[1:41:23] ready get the tea and everything and and
[1:41:24] then she disappeared because the cousins
[1:41:27] they were too fancy they couldn't get
[1:41:28] their fingernails dirty or anything so
[1:41:30] they're having their tea did he ask you
[1:41:32] did he ask you he didn't ask anybody
[1:41:34] what a bummer well where's that ugly
[1:41:36] cousin of ours well they're looking for
[1:41:37] her well she's back there in her room
[1:41:39] what are you doing
[1:41:41] well hey tell you all but he said i'm
[1:41:42] the one ah it's not possible
[1:41:46] it is possible that's why i'm working on
[1:41:47] this dress
[1:41:48] and so she she worked on her dress now
[1:41:51] the ridicule she got wasn't from the
[1:41:53] people of the next ranch or the people
[1:41:54] in town it was under her own roof the
[1:41:57] same house you see drank the same water
[1:41:59] and everything
[1:42:01] so she
[1:42:02] continued to get ready you know doing
[1:42:04] all the work and so forth
[1:42:06] and
[1:42:07] so then she's marking the calendar now
[1:42:09] they didn't believe so they weren't
[1:42:10] marker no calendar but she was marking
[1:42:12] the counter because she believed
[1:42:13] and
[1:42:14] nothing could convince her otherwise
[1:42:16] they tried
[1:42:17] nothing could separate her from the love
[1:42:19] of the one that made her the promise she
[1:42:21] had his word there was no phone there
[1:42:23] was no email she had his word
[1:42:27] it was worth something
[1:42:28] and he says one year from today i'll be
[1:42:30] back get ready
[1:42:32] so as time goes on
[1:42:34] you know
[1:42:35] the day's coming i see she had to wash
[1:42:37] watch what she ate because they didn't
[1:42:38] have stretch material back then
[1:42:40] she's making this dress you know
[1:42:43] and so she um
[1:42:45] she knew the day was coming boy the
[1:42:46] calendar's
[1:42:47] not gonna lie
[1:42:49] and um
[1:42:50] so sure enough
[1:42:52] she heard the buck board coming she
[1:42:54] heard the horses coming now when you
[1:42:55] live in the country you know how it used
[1:42:56] to be if somebody's coming bar all
[1:42:59] stretching their neck out see who it is
[1:43:01] well she already knew who it was she
[1:43:03] didn't have to stretch her neck out she
[1:43:04] got the last part of the dress ready and
[1:43:06] everything and the buck board stopped
[1:43:08] out there and they all started wow he
[1:43:11] did come back
[1:43:12] and we're not ready
[1:43:15] but she showed up in her dress
[1:43:16] out of the way girls
[1:43:19] she got the bunker board
[1:43:20] took off and they never saw her again
[1:43:23] and that's about what's going to happen
[1:43:25] to us
[1:43:26] so may god bless you
[1:43:27] and we will come back some other time to
[1:43:30] finish this
[1:43:31] thank you brother samuel
[1:43:34] i'll take this
[1:43:42] let's do it
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] you know it's uh
[1:43:57] patience is one thing that
[1:44:00] we can all we all need more of
[1:44:03] and
[1:44:04] you know as the lord jesus you find over
[1:44:07] and over in
[1:44:08] in lives and things that's all the way
[1:44:10] through the scripture
[1:44:12] even when god would speak to joseph
[1:44:14] and joseph
[1:44:16] it had a dream vision many things
[1:44:18] unfolded but it only happened
[1:44:21] at god's appointed time
[1:44:24] but it just shows that even with
[1:44:25] everything that god has promised us and
[1:44:28] you know
[1:44:30] it brings us to this place that
[1:44:32] as brother brahman says if there was
[1:44:33] something that came contrary to the word
[1:44:37] we stay with the word
[1:44:39] and i think brother george he he spoke
[1:44:41] and mentioned that tonight and as paul
[1:44:43] went through that in galatians 1.
[1:44:45] brother brahm says if the vision tells
[1:44:47] you something
[1:44:48] he said you can believe that he said
[1:44:50] this word
[1:44:51] has made us promises
[1:44:53] and so to see that within it these are
[1:44:56] promises that even that god has made to
[1:44:59] us remember when it came to i think it's
[1:45:01] in
[1:45:02] hebrews 6
[1:45:03] it says you have need of patience
[1:45:06] after
[1:45:08] you've done the will of god
[1:45:10] there's many times the things that we we
[1:45:12] don't receive first of all we have to
[1:45:14] evaluate have we done the will of god
[1:45:17] have we
[1:45:18] you know when the bible says if there be
[1:45:20] any sick among you let them call for the
[1:45:23] elders of church
[1:45:24] if they if there be any sin let them
[1:45:27] confess it let all that be put aside and
[1:45:30] then pray the prayer of faith anointing
[1:45:33] them with oil all those things in order
[1:45:36] god will never skip the order
[1:45:40] is that right the bible says he gives
[1:45:42] the holy ghost to them
[1:45:44] that belief
[1:45:46] amen that obey him so you see within all
[1:45:50] these things the patience we look at
[1:45:51] every one of the
[1:45:53] the characters that god
[1:45:55] spoke to us tonight in every one of them
[1:45:58] there's things that even when you look
[1:46:00] back in their life as abraham and the
[1:46:02] rest of them i think god even made it
[1:46:04] very clear to us tonight
[1:46:06] they were no different as james would
[1:46:08] write they were men of of subject to
[1:46:11] like passion such as we are
[1:46:13] but here's the thing
[1:46:15] they looked with expectation
[1:46:19] if something didn't happen today
[1:46:22] they were waiting for it tomorrow
[1:46:25] that's when it's a reality to where if
[1:46:28] it doesn't happen today we're waiting
[1:46:30] tomorrow brother brahms said it like
[1:46:32] this i think it in 1964 the message look
[1:46:35] he said abraham didn't look at all the
[1:46:39] misunderstandings
[1:46:40] of the promise
[1:46:42] he looked to the one who made the
[1:46:44] promise
[1:46:46] we have a lot of misunderstandings
[1:46:48] there's things that look there's a lot
[1:46:49] of things that even sometimes we're
[1:46:51] praying about things and it doesn't come
[1:46:53] out the way that we would desire it to
[1:46:55] come out but everything itself we know
[1:46:59] god's will cannot be overrode
[1:47:03] and the greatest thing that can place us
[1:47:05] into that place of waiting is to have
[1:47:08] the life of christ inside of us
[1:47:11] then what is that it's not us looking
[1:47:13] for him but it's christ inside of us
[1:47:16] looking for himself
[1:47:18] so for every junction of time of things
[1:47:20] that to me this is it's just tremendous
[1:47:23] because then what are we looking for
[1:47:25] we're not looking through our own lens
[1:47:27] we're looking through christ
[1:47:30] is that right he's the i that god has
[1:47:32] sent to guide the church so then no
[1:47:34] matter what comes about as brother
[1:47:36] george was saying
[1:47:37] if we're we are lined up vertically then
[1:47:40] all the horizontal things all the things
[1:47:42] that come if you you know you look on a
[1:47:44] tombstone and you see a tombstone you
[1:47:47] see this date where or this year when
[1:47:49] they were born or this date
[1:47:51] and then this date and in between they
[1:47:54] put a little dash
[1:47:56] it's all is a little dash
[1:47:58] but in that dash is life
[1:48:01] there's events
[1:48:03] this print this person if you looked
[1:48:04] around on different tombstones if they
[1:48:06] could have all the timeline wrote out
[1:48:08] you this one this happened at this time
[1:48:10] and this one happened at this time and
[1:48:12] you could look and say well this one
[1:48:14] you know maybe they got their first job
[1:48:16] at this age and this one got their first
[1:48:17] job at this age this one got married at
[1:48:19] this age this one got but you see all of
[1:48:21] our lives
[1:48:23] it's in god's hands
[1:48:25] and in that dash that's why being in
[1:48:28] connection with god
[1:48:30] and him being in our life then we can
[1:48:32] look and what we're looking for is we
[1:48:35] want to stay in step with him
[1:48:37] i want to stay instead i don't want to
[1:48:39] miss him
[1:48:40] even in the job that i take or the job
[1:48:42] that we say no to we don't want to miss
[1:48:45] god
[1:48:47] that's what matters more to us as
[1:48:48] believers more than anything else is i
[1:48:51] don't want to come out of line i want to
[1:48:53] stay right in line
[1:48:55] in a place to where god can speak to me
[1:48:58] move and deal with my life because what
[1:49:02] means more
[1:49:03] than everything of this earth
[1:49:05] and that's his coming
[1:49:08] it's him
[1:49:09] and not just waiting for that moment but
[1:49:12] even in this time right now
[1:49:14] it's a joy
[1:49:15] to walk
[1:49:17] in his presence it's a joy to know it
[1:49:20] it's a peace
[1:49:21] that you can know i'm in god's will
[1:49:25] i'm just waiting
[1:49:26] i'm waiting and i'm looking
[1:49:29] you know how god brought it tonight
[1:49:31] there's also another scripture i love
[1:49:33] brother george was going through those
[1:49:36] the very last scripture
[1:49:39] in first corinthians 15 which is my
[1:49:42] goodness a chapter you know when you
[1:49:44] think of the very change
[1:49:46] when this
[1:49:47] mortality shall put on immortality the
[1:49:50] very last
[1:49:51] scripture
[1:49:53] that while waiting for this
[1:49:55] paul wrote and said see that you abound
[1:50:00] in the work of the lord
[1:50:02] it's everything just it's god lining
[1:50:05] everything up and brother branham i'm
[1:50:06] just just hearing it again here today
[1:50:08] and as brother brahem is going through
[1:50:10] that and god and simplicity in the
[1:50:12] breach and he's saying remember he
[1:50:14] brings us back that he said you can't
[1:50:16] remember he said about the handkerchief
[1:50:17] if it's got to be here so and so has to
[1:50:20] put it there they have to do that
[1:50:22] but it's god
[1:50:24] it's god overseeing it
[1:50:27] and i say god let me just be simple
[1:50:30] enough
[1:50:31] to the parts and the places just to be
[1:50:33] open and yielded to you
[1:50:36] because when it's all said and done you
[1:50:38] or i can't say my i yielded to that no
[1:50:40] it was god's grace
[1:50:42] that
[1:50:43] ministered to us that we could yield
[1:50:47] there's nothing that we can glory in
[1:50:50] but what a place to be waiting in christ
[1:50:54] it's a place of rest it's a place that
[1:50:56] we can
[1:50:57] it's solid ground
[1:50:59] it's a place we have a great expectation
[1:51:01] it's a place in christ and if we're just
[1:51:03] locked in with him you can't miss what
[1:51:06] god has for you
[1:51:08] you can't miss it
[1:51:10] if you're locked into christ
[1:51:13] amen
[1:51:14] hallelujah
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:21] let's just sing this let's just just let
[1:51:24] the rain of the holy spirit just water

[1:51:28] in the love of god
