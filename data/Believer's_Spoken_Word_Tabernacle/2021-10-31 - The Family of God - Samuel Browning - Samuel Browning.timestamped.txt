[30:16] we've got to present a gift to them
[30:19] everyone knows october is pastor
[30:22] appreciation month
[30:24] and
[30:25] we just want to present something to
[30:26] them
[30:29] i'd like to read a little scripture here
[30:31] first if that's okay
[30:35] in luke 10 30 it says jesus answering
[30:37] said a certain man went down from
[30:39] jerusalem to jericho
[30:41] and fell among thieves
[30:44] which stripped him of his raiment and
[30:46] wounded him
[30:47] and departed leaving him half dead
[30:51] by chance they there came down a certain
[30:54] priest that way and when he saw him he
[30:56] passed by on the other side
[30:58] and likewise at levite when he was at
[31:01] the place
[31:02] came and looked on him and passed
[31:04] on by the other side
[31:06] but a certain samaritan his journey came
[31:09] where he was
[31:10] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[31:12] him
[31:13] and he went down and bound up his wounds
[31:16] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[31:18] his own breast beast and brought him in
[31:22] into the inn and took care of him
[31:25] and on the morrow when he departed he
[31:27] took out two pence
[31:29] and gave him to the host
[31:31] and he said unto him take care of him
[31:34] and whatsoever
[31:35] whatsoever thou spend us more when i
[31:38] come again i will repay thee
[31:41] and
[31:43] many times i read over that that parable
[31:47] and i always just noticed the samaritan
[31:50] and we know the samaritan is jesus our
[31:53] savior you know he's the one that picked
[31:55] us up
[31:56] but i'm just grateful to know that he
[31:58] didn't just pick me up dust me off and
[32:00] just give me
[32:01] his holy spirit and his wine his
[32:03] revelation of who he was he didn't just
[32:06] leave me on the road and just leave me
[32:07] there
[32:08] he was jehovah gyra
[32:10] and he took him to a caregiver took the
[32:12] man to a caregiver to take care of him
[32:15] until he was strong enough
[32:17] until he was strong enough to go on his
[32:18] way to on his journey
[32:20] and brother branham said
[32:23] you know jesus found a man
[32:25] at one time in a parable
[32:27] on the road to jericho from jerusalem
[32:30] it showed that he was backsliding he was
[32:32] going from up on high going down low he
[32:35] was backsliding he he met him on the
[32:38] road an enemy had beaten him robbed him
[32:41] and left him dead and physically alive
[32:44] spiritually dead so on
[32:46] the priests and the levites and so forth
[32:48] passed by him
[32:49] but the good samaritan as jesus taught
[32:51] him
[32:52] taught it came picked him up poured oil
[32:55] and wine and take him to the end now
[32:58] there now there's the place i want to
[33:00] get to you he taken him to the end
[33:03] and said to the caretaker take care of
[33:05] him
[33:06] give him
[33:08] he gave him a couple pennies or whatever
[33:09] it was to pay his way and said now if he
[33:13] needs any more just go ahead and take
[33:15] care of him i'll make it right when i
[33:17] come now you shepherds god gave you the
[33:20] spirit and the word to take care of
[33:22] these wounded ones that's been brought
[33:24] in if you need any more he'll take care
[33:26] of when he comes just so feed my sheep
[33:29] and i believe god has given me a
[33:32] caretaker like brother samuel
[33:35] [Applause]
[33:43] and i just look back at my life you know
[33:45] just um when i first gave my heart to
[33:47] the lord
[33:48] i was just thinking and um
[33:51] you know brother samuel didn't really
[33:52] know me but he knew i loved to play
[33:54] basketball you know he knew i played in
[33:56] college and when i first came to the
[33:59] youth meetings uh
[34:01] he he took it upon himself
[34:03] to
[34:05] read
[34:06] about basketball in the newspaper just
[34:08] so he would be able to converse with me
[34:10] have that relationship with me first
[34:12] he's he's done many things i've had many
[34:15] phone calls with him
[34:18] many times i remember sister kim i could
[34:20] hear bringing him uh and food because he
[34:22] missed dinner that night you know with
[34:24] his family he's made countless sacrifice
[34:27] uh sacrifices for me and i'm sure he's
[34:30] made many sacrifices for you all and i
[34:32] just want to thank god for our pastor
[34:35] and his um godly wife that supports him
[34:38] you know she does many things behind the
[34:40] scenes she's prayed for me i'm sure
[34:42] countless times and all of us youth
[34:44] and
[34:45] we just want to say thank you brother
[34:46] samuel and we gave you um
[34:50] one night stay at a um in amish country
[34:53] and uh and a gift card to a restaurant
[34:56] that ate last night so it's pretty good

[35:06] appreciate you and
[35:08] thank you and god bless you
[35:09] [Applause]
[35:28] thank you
[35:35] i'm not on yet okay
[35:37] well i just want to say thank you and i
[35:40] i to me it's just a
[35:48] it just was when the lord got a hold of
[35:50] my life it was the greatest thing that
[35:51] he ever did for me
[35:53] i didn't ask for anything more i was
[35:55] happy
[35:56] with just setting setting and just
[35:58] worshiping i
[36:00] most of you knew that when god first got
[36:02] a hold of my life i just enjoyed i just
[36:04] enjoyed serving the lord
[36:07] and uh
[36:08] but god
[36:09] god had other other plans for other
[36:12] things to be done
[36:14] and to me it's whatever he asked me to
[36:16] do
[36:17] it's an honor
[36:19] i i owe him my whole life
[36:21] and it's just a real honor to i tell you
[36:23] i'm just being honest with you i love
[36:26] pastoring
[36:27] and i love you
[36:29] i love you and there you know there's
[36:31] times that we as a we're we're a family
[36:34] and i think about that many times in in
[36:36] our in my own family there's a lot of it
[36:39] that
[36:40] i can really understand even more when
[36:42] brother banham
[36:43] as he goes into the scriptures and we
[36:45] see
[36:46] many of the qualifications that are set
[36:48] forth for a pastor and one of those
[36:50] things
[36:52] is also with a family and to see that
[36:55] it's very that that in itself becomes
[36:57] very evident because there's a lot of
[36:59] things and i can tell you it hasn't
[37:00] stopped learning you see it more and
[37:03] more and more
[37:05] and the one thing i just asked god for
[37:06] is lord help me to be more of a servant
[37:09] i want to be more of a servant because
[37:12] the desire within every of all my heart
[37:14] is i want to see every one of you
[37:17] on the other side
[37:22] that's i want to spend eternity with you
[37:24] because it's it's just
[37:26] it's wonderful
[37:27] walking here in this life together
[37:30] it's just awesome to see the word of god
[37:32] just coming there's no greater joy in my
[37:34] heart than to see the people of god just
[37:37] just electrified by the word of god and
[37:40] their lives just just just taking on
[37:42] that word and just becoming that word
[37:45] just to see christ himself being
[37:47] revealed in your life there's no greater
[37:49] joy that i have
[37:51] than to see that that right there
[37:53] and i'm just so thankful that god's
[37:55] brought us together
[37:56] i'm glad for the grace of god and god
[37:59] knows how our paths are to cross and
[38:01] and you know this very well as as well
[38:04] as i do as you know within it we
[38:07] sometimes there's things that we
[38:09] can look sometimes at one another we
[38:11] don't understand things altogether but
[38:14] we trust we trust the lord and sometimes
[38:16] we disappoint one another
[38:18] but that's because but within all of
[38:20] that we still come to that place to say
[38:22] lord
[38:23] i am trusting in you lord jesus and i'm
[38:26] so grateful for that aren't you
[38:28] amen i'm grateful for the grace of god
[38:30] that right here among us and i just want
[38:33] to say thank you for brother brian for
[38:35] those kind words and i know that that's
[38:37] you know on behalf of the whole
[38:38] congregation and i just asked you to
[38:40] continue to pray for me and may god
[38:42] continue to help me
[38:44] to be a faithful innkeeper
[38:47] amen
[38:48] i we have a presentation here brother
[38:50] shane will go ahead and come
[38:55] and that's where i thought brother brian
[38:56] i thought wow some brother brian already
[38:58] knows that there's brother shane's got a
[39:00] presentation here as a
[39:01] trustees to present this i thought wow
[39:03] this is he's already told me brother
[39:05] samuel i'm going to get you out a few
[39:06] minutes early
[39:09] but uh we brother shane's going to
[39:13] just give a presentation here in just a
[39:15] moment it's just some work that
[39:18] lord willing a project that we're
[39:20] wanting to move into here
[39:22] um
[39:23] on behalf the trustees and with the for
[39:26] the congregation i believe it's
[39:27] something you really
[39:29] um
[39:30] you really look uh
[39:32] really be thankful for so
[39:35] you've got you're ready to go okay
[39:39] hello all right god bless you church
[39:42] tough to follow that wow
[39:44] um
[39:45] but yeah uh brother richie brother aaron
[39:48] and myself have uh some exciting news a
[39:50] project to share with you uh
[39:53] i've simplified it with pictures and
[39:54] dimensions so you can understand it best
[39:57] if you do have any questions you can see
[39:59] me or the other trustees at the
[40:01] fellowship or call us email us whatever
[40:04] works best so
[40:07] so the project is going to consist of
[40:09] five phases uh phase one will be the
[40:12] northwest side including the playground
[40:14] walkway which will start this year that
[40:16] is actually where brother samuel parks
[40:18] so maybe we can consider that a
[40:20] part of the pastor
[40:23] a new appreciation
[40:24] pad
[40:26] but uh
[40:27] phase two will be the front walkway
[40:29] that'll consist of all the way down from
[40:31] this point all the way down to where he
[40:33] parks
[40:34] which will start lord willing in spring
[40:36] of 2022 phase three will be the entrance
[40:39] ramp which is now wood
[40:41] which i'll explain that uh which will
[40:43] start in spring summer of 2020 phase
[40:46] four will be a new front porch
[40:48] uh
[40:49] again you know probably more summer 2022
[40:53] phase five will be a metal roof
[40:55] extension covering the front porch and
[40:58] also the entrance ram
[41:01] so phase one where brother samuel parks
[41:04] right now is an existing 16 by 29 foot
[41:07] concrete pad if you've ever gone back
[41:09] there you can kind of see here it's
[41:12] it's kind of a hazard right now for the
[41:14] children it's all broken up
[41:16] i know i think there were some questions
[41:19] insurance had about it but
[41:22] anyway so right now will be a new pad
[41:26] and again these steps consist of taking
[41:28] all this out it's not just like oh you
[41:30] can dump concrete done deal so there's
[41:33] you know a lot of steps to this but uh
[41:36] and also
[41:37] where this
[41:38] kind of wood guide path will be a four
[41:42] foot wide concrete
[41:43] 36 feet long
[41:46] coming to the playground so that will
[41:48] take place this year
[41:51] phase two will be uh
[41:54] right now i think this is ten foot this
[41:56] will be reduced because later i'll get
[41:58] on to the
[42:00] front porch being extended but it will
[42:02] be a five foot
[42:03] concrete walkway and like i said it will
[42:06] go
[42:07] from this corner of the church all the
[42:09] way down to the corner five feet wide
[42:12] and then
[42:13] uh with the concrete the
[42:18] uh handicap ramp
[42:20] um
[42:21] and again these these steps consist of
[42:24] breaking all this up cutting it all out
[42:26] removing it so it's a it's a pretty
[42:28] in-depth process
[42:31] phase three will be the new concrete
[42:33] ramp which i'll just show you the
[42:35] pictures of this these are the styles
[42:36] that we're we're thinking of here this
[42:39] is not a concrete example but
[42:41] so this type of railing with this this
[42:44] be pretty close to this as far as the
[42:46] concrete ramp so it will be
[42:48] four feet wide
[42:50] where the wood is now and it'll be 27
[42:53] feet long
[42:55] and i'll show you this picture again
[42:58] and there will be
[42:59] this is just a close-up of the style of
[43:01] the railing that will go down the ramp
[43:04] here
[43:07] so phase three will be the new
[43:10] front porch uh this will come out 10
[43:12] feet
[43:13] and it'll be 14 foot long and there will
[43:15] be steps on the left and the right side
[43:19] the reason why we couldn't do it in the
[43:20] front is probably because a car will
[43:22] park here
[43:23] so you know can't nobody will be able to
[43:25] get in but
[43:26] so we steps here to the left and to the
[43:28] right picture
[43:31] of that
[43:33] this is kind of an example but again you
[43:36] have to ignore the front steps these
[43:38] will be on this side so on the left and
[43:41] right side
[43:42] would be the walkway this is another
[43:44] example this is a small version again
[43:46] this art will not be this small but
[43:49] just so you can kind of picture it just
[43:51] get the image
[43:52] and these will be the steps that will
[43:54] come up from the left and the right side
[43:56] of the ramp
[43:59] so
[44:00] phase four will be the overhang to cover
[44:04] the new concrete ramp
[44:06] it's a 12 inch overhang the style will
[44:08] match
[44:09] as close as we can to the style of the
[44:11] roof the metal roof that is on it this
[44:13] is kind of a if you ever go to fast food
[44:16] they kind of have these overhangs
[44:18] obviously it'll be much it'll be 12
[44:19] inches and it'll match the current
[44:23] as close as we can to the to move
[44:26] and
[44:26] this is
[44:28] uh so the so you can see kind of here
[44:30] the steps
[44:32] on the left and the right side and then
[44:34] the roof will come all the way out you
[44:36] know so there won't be
[44:37] you know we won't get rained on once you
[44:39] hit the front porch
[44:41] and they're snowing on
[44:43] and also
[44:44] the ramp here so
[44:48] so yeah that's the slides uh
[44:50] let me go back here to the timeline
[44:53] we do plan on taking special offerings
[44:56] the second sunday of every month
[44:58] starting in november
[45:01] and
[45:03] again you know if there's any questions
[45:05] uh feel free to see me brother richard
[45:07] brother aaron and we'd love to to chat
[45:10] and
[45:11] yeah this is exciting you know to
[45:13] refresh the church and just like we do
[45:14] our homes you know and
[45:16] to make it look beautiful so god bless
[45:18] you
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:29] i guess i think that's a problem can
[45:31] agree that that's something that is very
[45:33] important
[45:35] you know one thing that
[45:38] that's made this
[45:39] that's me
[45:42] i didn't want to be over there clearing
[45:44] my throat and brother shane was talking
[45:47] but
[45:49] you know i just always i i just
[45:51] i believe we look at things like this i
[45:54] i look at the house of god
[45:56] and i look at it as a reflection
[45:58] of what we even think about the lord
[45:59] jesus
[46:01] and i that's why you know i i look at
[46:04] things and i'd rather do something i
[46:06] wanted to you want it to look nice you
[46:08] want it to look presentable
[46:10] because
[46:12] nothing that we could ever do could ever
[46:14] compare to him but i believe that
[46:15] everything that we can do
[46:17] it speaks a lot of what we think of the
[46:20] lord jesus
[46:22] amen and i just believe in doing that
[46:24] and
[46:25] so we the brothers brother richie's one
[46:28] of the drawings there you've seen
[46:30] and brother richie put together so many
[46:32] drawings
[46:33] brother richie can i tell you the
[46:35] drawings that he came up with he handed
[46:37] me a handed all of us a whole folder
[46:39] back in june and the drawings that
[46:41] brother richie has done it
[46:43] it might seem a little hard to see but
[46:45] you know out there on that pad
[46:48] i never really even thought about it
[46:49] until one time i think brother carlos
[46:51] brought it to my attention
[46:53] and that because brother carlos and i
[46:55] won't call the brother's name that he
[46:56] lost off of the top of the porch out
[46:59] there in the wheelchair
[47:01] because there's no turn there's no place
[47:02] to turn around when they come out with a
[47:04] wheelchair or something and you know how
[47:06] it is out there right now you have to
[47:07] watch and be careful who's understanding
[47:09] out there so
[47:10] um just as the lord has provided that we
[47:12] were able to have a four year where you
[47:15] know we can come out and
[47:17] you know be able to greet one another
[47:19] and i think that's exactly how that'll
[47:21] be there so you won't have to worry
[47:22] about with room and being able to turn
[47:24] around and having a roof over that as
[47:26] well as the
[47:29] the ramp because we've needed we've
[47:31] needed the ramp and some of the things
[47:33] out there and i'll just say it this way
[47:35] some of the things that we've had out
[47:36] there has just been temporary fixes and
[47:39] sometimes temporary turns in one year to
[47:41] a year three year
[47:42] and you know everyone's there's a lot of
[47:45] a busyness and a lot of things that goes
[47:47] on and we're just like anybody else all
[47:49] of us are we have to really try to get
[47:51] things honed in and plan things out
[47:53] and talk about it but i think the
[47:56] brothers have done just a wonderful job
[47:58] and
[48:00] brother shane when we were looking at
[48:01] that the other night on across a
[48:04] group meeting a call across the internet
[48:06] with the brothers and
[48:07] my i just told him i said well i know
[48:09] i'm going to have to make my powerpoints
[48:10] from now on
[48:14] but he just did just just a
[48:16] wonderful job with that i know brother
[48:18] aaron sister man that they weren't able
[48:19] to be here today
[48:21] just some circumstances there and uh i
[48:24] just asked that uh you know there's a
[48:26] lot that even with the brother aaron
[48:27] that has some of that background and
[48:29] some of the things with the concrete so
[48:31] there's a lot that will the brothers
[48:32] will continue to keep you up to date on
[48:35] all of those things that are taking
[48:36] place and throughout
[48:38] so
[48:41] we love the lord
[48:44] and i want to just remind you if you
[48:46] want to change positions and just stand
[48:48] with me here just for a few moments and
[48:50] we'll just read the word of the lord and
[48:52] we'll go to prayer
[49:02] durian remind you this after the service

[52:56] in the name of jesus christ
[52:59] amen
[53:00] amen deuteronomy 16
[53:03] and verse 1
[53:05] observe
[53:07] the month
[53:08] of abel
[53:09] and keep the passover unto the lord thy
[53:12] god
[53:13] for in the month of abib the lord thy
[53:15] god brought thee forth out of egypt by
[53:18] night
[53:19] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[53:22] passover unto the lord thy god of the
[53:24] flock
[53:25] and the herd
[53:27] in the place which the lord
[53:29] shall choose to place his
[53:32] name
[53:33] there
[53:35] thou shalt eat no leavened bread with
[53:38] him
[53:39] seven days shalt thou eat unleavened
[53:41] bread therewith even the bread of
[53:44] affliction for thou camest forth out of
[53:46] the land of egypt in haste that thou
[53:49] mayest observe
[53:51] mayest remember the day when thou camest
[53:53] forth out of the land of egypt all the
[53:55] days of thy life
[53:58] there shall be no leavened bread seen
[54:00] with thee
[54:01] in all thy coast seven days
[54:04] neither shall there anything of the
[54:07] flesh which thou sacrifices the first
[54:09] day of even
[54:11] remain all night unto the morning
[54:13] thou mayest not sacrifice the passover
[54:17] within any of thy gates
[54:20] which the lord thy god giveth thee
[54:23] but at the place which the lord thy god
[54:26] shall choose to place his name in
[54:28] there thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[54:32] and even at the going down of the sun
[54:35] at the season that thou camest forth out
[54:38] of egypt and thou shalt roast it and eat
[54:41] it in the place which the lord thy god
[54:44] shall choose
[54:45] thou shalt turn in the morning
[54:48] and go on
[54:49] to thy tents
[54:51] six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread
[54:53] and on the seventh day
[54:55] shall be a solemn assembly to the lord
[54:57] thy god
[54:58] thou shalt do no work
[55:00] therein
[55:02] amen i'd like to just speak to you or at
[55:04] least start into it
[55:07] on the family of god
[55:09] may god bless you bless the reading of
[55:11] the words you're being seated
[55:15] when we
[55:16] we draw from
[55:19] the scriptures here we we can clearly
[55:21] see there's only one place
[55:24] that god
[55:25] will recognize
[55:28] and receive worship and that's in
[55:31] his chosen place
[55:33] so it's god's choosing
[55:35] and where god makes known his choice and
[55:38] i want you to remember in the scriptures
[55:40] we've you've seen the parallel
[55:43] down through the scriptures because
[55:45] it is within
[55:47] mankind
[55:48] to worship
[55:50] is driven to worship remember brother
[55:51] branham would talk about even how things
[55:53] certain things were and he went and he
[55:55] was talking about in places where he had
[55:57] been in africa and certain things they
[55:59] were worshiping and you you find that
[56:02] that worship itself there's always been
[56:05] that of a parallel and there's been uh
[56:08] you know a person that even can say well
[56:10] i'm not religious but they're still a
[56:12] worshiper
[56:13] you know you can worship your job
[56:16] you could worship your husband you could
[56:18] worship your you you could just worship
[56:20] your career yes
[56:22] and yet what it is is that's a there's a
[56:25] there's a desire to worship
[56:28] and there's there's only god placed that
[56:30] desire within you to worship that desire
[56:33] is there and there there is a place
[56:36] where you are able to really
[56:39] worship and worship the living god
[56:42] and so when we see it's like cane when
[56:45] you look at cain
[56:47] think of how that cain when he when he
[56:50] brought his his his sacrifice here abel
[56:53] brings his cain brings his
[56:56] the difference between them
[56:58] is that we find that cain is bringing
[57:01] fruit of the field and he wasn't slack
[57:03] he wasn't you know he wasn't just lazy
[57:06] about he brought the best fruits
[57:09] but abel what he brought was what god
[57:12] had revealed to him
[57:14] and abel was walking by that revelation
[57:17] and they come into that place of worship
[57:20] and so what abel had had received from
[57:24] god as a revelation god himself came and
[57:27] vindicated
[57:29] that revelation that that came from him
[57:32] you see god will always confirm his word
[57:36] god does not leave it up to a church or
[57:39] a person to confirm the word
[57:41] as a matter of fact even for your life
[57:44] or my life god does not leave it in our
[57:47] hands to confirm or to prove that we are
[57:50] christians but it is god himself who
[57:53] comes down in the life of a believer and
[57:57] it's god's own life
[57:59] moving through us that declares us to be
[58:03] a christian
[58:04] so this is why it's more than anything
[58:07] that we could ever say out of our mouth
[58:09] it's what comes out of our life that
[58:11] actually is a declaration because as we
[58:14] look for months you have a voice it's
[58:17] god's voice when the holy ghost has come
[58:19] it's a voice of god that sounds out
[58:22] through our life to others that i'm a
[58:24] christian
[58:25] i'm a believer and it's in everything
[58:28] that we do and we say
[58:30] so we come back to here and we look at
[58:31] cain and we look at we see abel and
[58:34] remember paul would pick this up because
[58:37] when cain came to worship when god you
[58:40] know god dealt with cain about uh you
[58:43] know when cain's countenance was fallen
[58:45] and and he asked cain why why is your
[58:48] countenance falling now it may not have
[58:49] been anything out here
[58:52] but it was a countenance within to where
[58:54] here it was just fallen within but you
[58:57] see the word is a discerner
[59:00] and he knew his countenance was fallen
[59:03] and he finally begins to point cain to a
[59:06] place he says if thou if thou doest well
[59:10] shalt thou also be accepted
[59:12] and he says if thou doest not then send
[59:14] life at the door
[59:16] so its unbelief so cain himself god god
[59:20] even came down and god pointed out what
[59:23] cain already knew this was the perfect
[59:26] will of god
[59:28] it was vindicated by god himself
[59:32] and cain knew that but cain was not able
[59:36] to come to that depth of humility to
[59:40] surrender his life to them and that's
[59:42] all god asked for us to do is the
[59:45] surrendering of our life and that's the
[59:46] continuum of even our walk as a believer
[59:49] is a continual surrender of our life as
[59:51] paul said i die daily
[59:54] paul picks this up here i believe it's
[59:56] in the book of colossians and he speaks
[59:58] of how you have people then you have
[1:00:01] individuals that now after the holy
[1:00:03] ghost has come you have different ones
[1:00:05] that are you know they're intruding into
[1:00:08] worship of angels and it's all
[1:00:10] they're going into this and going into
[1:00:12] that and and and paul begins to express
[1:00:15] then he identifies that the things that
[1:00:18] they're doing
[1:00:19] is a satisfying of the flesh in other
[1:00:21] words they are feeling appeased by the
[1:00:25] things that they're doing even what they
[1:00:27] would a lot to of this is a supernatural
[1:00:29] but paul identifies it by the spirit of
[1:00:32] god he calls it will worship it's not
[1:00:36] the will of god it's man's will wherein
[1:00:39] man is willing to worship
[1:00:42] but not coming according to god's will
[1:00:46] of worship
[1:00:48] you see this is where when we come into
[1:00:50] it cain he offered and he went according
[1:00:53] to his own understanding
[1:00:55] and yet after even after what god had
[1:00:58] revealed and confirmed and this is where
[1:01:01] jesus would speak to the pharisees or to
[1:01:04] the religious in that day a scripture
[1:01:06] you're very familiar with when they
[1:01:08] themselves were standing there you
[1:01:11] couldn't put a finger on their life but
[1:01:13] jesus is identifying and he says in vain
[1:01:16] you do worship me now i want you to
[1:01:18] think of this they were worshiping him
[1:01:21] but in
[1:01:22] vain
[1:01:24] they weren't they were not partakers of
[1:01:27] the effect
[1:01:29] that god would even release in that hour
[1:01:31] let me just let me just allow the holy
[1:01:33] spirit to just take this for a moment
[1:01:36] you realize you could say we could look
[1:01:38] and say well the holy ghost had not been
[1:01:40] given yet that is true as far as an
[1:01:42] indwelling by the new birth but the holy
[1:01:45] ghost was already here all the way
[1:01:48] that's what had been dealing with
[1:01:49] abraham that's what had been dealing
[1:01:51] with on the same holy spirit this is the
[1:01:54] same holy ghost that that david could
[1:01:56] write take not thy holy spirit from me
[1:02:00] it's the same spirit of god that all of
[1:02:02] them through the old testament have
[1:02:04] relied upon it was the same unction that
[1:02:07] they received that made a difference
[1:02:09] when they offered the lamb they weren't
[1:02:12] just offering in ritual like well we got
[1:02:15] to go do this and and moses you know
[1:02:17] yeah moses said we got to offer yeah we
[1:02:18] got to go up to the feast at this time
[1:02:20] and and sometimes it wasn't even let me
[1:02:22] just say it sometimes it wasn't even so
[1:02:24] much the drudgery of like oh yeah i got
[1:02:26] to go to the feast and yeah we have to
[1:02:28] offer this up but sometimes it was
[1:02:30] simply that it what happened is there
[1:02:32] was no connection no conviction with the
[1:02:35] worshiper no sincerity with the offering
[1:02:38] of their sacrifice and this is why god
[1:02:41] would say in the book of isaiah who has
[1:02:43] called you who has caused you to tread
[1:02:46] my courts and offer up these sacrifices
[1:02:50] he says and he calls them not his feasts
[1:02:52] he said your feasts because there was no
[1:02:55] connection there was no conviction in
[1:02:57] their life it was no more than
[1:02:59] ceremonialism it was things they were
[1:03:01] just going through a routine let me just
[1:03:04] say this satan does not care how much
[1:03:07] that a person you could come to church
[1:03:09] how much a person could know about the
[1:03:11] message have saint doesn't care about
[1:03:13] that if you just stay in a ceremonial
[1:03:15] place that doesn't bother him one bit
[1:03:18] matter of fact you'll stand right beside
[1:03:19] you and say let's go let's take on this
[1:03:21] ceremony let's go to this feast but it's
[1:03:24] when your life when there you release
[1:03:27] yourself to the hunger that's on the
[1:03:29] inside then i want god i want to know
[1:03:32] more of god i need more of god in my
[1:03:35] life every one of us have a desire and
[1:03:38] should have for more of god and we want
[1:03:41] to see more of himself being revealed
[1:03:44] and revealed in our own life it's a
[1:03:46] desire that pulsates in our heart
[1:03:50] because we don't want to live lives of
[1:03:52] vanity when we come to the house of god
[1:03:54] then we walk away empty let me just say
[1:03:57] this let's just take the heart off the
[1:03:59] devil right now because satan's desire
[1:04:02] within it is that we would live vain
[1:04:04] lives that are empty but god's desire is
[1:04:07] that we would live lives that are filled
[1:04:10] with the fullness of god we would live
[1:04:12] it to the full potential and that's why
[1:04:14] god speaks to us in a service whether
[1:04:17] he's calling a heart and a life and
[1:04:19] surrender to him or he's dealing with
[1:04:21] others that those of us that are
[1:04:23] dwelling there behind the veil god is
[1:04:25] still reminding us that your life the
[1:04:28] whole of your life don't allow the enemy
[1:04:30] to encroach on it but give and surrender
[1:04:33] your all to me let me be the fullness of
[1:04:36] your life let me be your satisfaction in
[1:04:39] everything let me be your resource let
[1:04:41] me be your tower your culvert let me be
[1:04:44] your rock let me be your shield and god
[1:04:46] would speak to us in this moment because
[1:04:49] our lives are to produce
[1:04:53] i fruit produce this fruit
[1:04:56] much as i can i can try it i can't do it
[1:05:00] but he can
[1:05:01] and see the greatest enemy that we have
[1:05:04] is our own selves
[1:05:06] if we can get ourselves out of the way
[1:05:09] this is where the battle the battle
[1:05:11] really lays and this is why when jesus
[1:05:13] said in vain you do worship me teaching
[1:05:16] for doctrine the commandments of men
[1:05:20] so
[1:05:21] they couldn't let me just say this here
[1:05:23] was the religious people in that hour
[1:05:26] reading the prophecies
[1:05:28] they were there going up to the feast in
[1:05:30] jerusalem
[1:05:31] but yet
[1:05:32] they weren't worshiping
[1:05:35] in the name or in the place where god
[1:05:38] had revealed his name what you think of
[1:05:40] that they're going to jerusalem for the
[1:05:43] feast and when we look at the scripture
[1:05:45] well god said to go where he placed his
[1:05:46] name but that's got to be a personal
[1:05:48] revelation to you
[1:05:51] you see when it's when it's revealed it
[1:05:53] brings conviction in your life
[1:05:56] it brings things that you consider your
[1:05:58] footsteps you consider your life because
[1:06:01] why you recognize that the god that
[1:06:03] we're speaking about isn't a mysticism
[1:06:06] it's a god who is present he's right
[1:06:08] here and not out here but a god who's
[1:06:11] living right here inside behind this
[1:06:13] veil and you watch your steps you order
[1:06:16] your steps
[1:06:17] and you take from the spirit of god that
[1:06:19] if you start getting out of out of step
[1:06:21] the spirit of god can speak to your life
[1:06:23] and call you back in step because you're
[1:06:26] in tune with his voice and your desire
[1:06:29] is to please him
[1:06:31] you see simeon here's simeon here's anna
[1:06:35] uh you know even simon's father
[1:06:38] they they were moved upon by the spirit
[1:06:40] of god i want you to think
[1:06:42] simeon right down in the temple
[1:06:44] what was the difference between simeon
[1:06:47] and the rest of them the holy spirit
[1:06:51] the bible says the spirit of god
[1:06:52] revealed to him
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] that he should not die until he would
[1:06:58] see the lord's christ
[1:07:00] simeon was in such you see this wasn't
[1:07:02] something if i could say it in this way
[1:07:04] something of a fly by night but simeon
[1:07:07] himself was already moved by the spirit
[1:07:09] of god but it came for a junction there
[1:07:12] and notice simeon's life was not a vain
[1:07:15] life
[1:07:18] i'm just going to follow him right now
[1:07:21] when the enemy let me just say this for
[1:07:23] each and every one of us in here there
[1:07:25] are times that you can look at and just
[1:07:27] focus in right now on what he's saying
[1:07:29] there's times that you can look in your
[1:07:31] life and things seem so overwhelming to
[1:07:34] your life and you begin to look and say
[1:07:36] well it seems like things are in vain it
[1:07:38] seems like my prayers aren't being
[1:07:40] answered it seems like this is taking
[1:07:42] place let me say this to you just
[1:07:44] because god hasn't answered the prayer
[1:07:46] the way you wanted it does not mean that
[1:07:49] he has an answer and because he hasn't
[1:07:51] come through and turned the situation
[1:07:53] around doesn't mean that he doesn't love
[1:07:56] you doesn't mean that he doesn't care
[1:07:58] doesn't mean that your life is in vain
[1:08:00] you stand as a believer on the word
[1:08:03] because part of the fruit of the
[1:08:05] believer is patience
[1:08:08] and patience possess ye your souls
[1:08:12] and patience says god has said it i'm
[1:08:14] gonna stand right here ain't the devil
[1:08:17] gonna move me off of this promise this
[1:08:19] is my promise
[1:08:21] no matter what comes i'm gonna stand
[1:08:24] there you say what's taking place it's
[1:08:26] manifesting that's not a vain life
[1:08:28] that's a lie where the fruit of almighty
[1:08:31] god is issuing out of your life in
[1:08:34] situations like that
[1:08:36] hey it's not hard and hard to have
[1:08:38] patience when you don't need them
[1:08:42] i mean when you're the next guy up in
[1:08:44] line and man everything's going just
[1:08:45] right you know mcdonald's is really
[1:08:47] following the fast food mar you know
[1:08:50] man it's not hard
[1:08:52] but see patience is where
[1:08:54] when we're tried sometimes
[1:08:57] is that right
[1:08:59] we're situations sometimes where it
[1:09:00] seemed like the doctor didn't get this
[1:09:02] or this or that and things aren't going
[1:09:04] and what do i do stand still in that
[1:09:06] time
[1:09:07] just stand still and say god down god
[1:09:10] alone
[1:09:12] you're above every situation
[1:09:14] you know what's taking place i might
[1:09:16] seem like my world is upside down but on
[1:09:18] the inside
[1:09:20] there's an anchor there's a hole on the
[1:09:23] inside it's not a vain life
[1:09:28] rebuke that devil
[1:09:30] in the name of jesus christ and just
[1:09:32] put him under your foot
[1:09:34] that's where he's at already just put
[1:09:36] him under your foot
[1:09:41] oh my because a vain life is a life
[1:09:44] where remember the pharisees there was
[1:09:46] nothing but ceremonialism but for a real
[1:09:48] life of a believer oh it's not a
[1:09:50] ceremony
[1:09:52] we love him amen
[1:09:54] oh brother samuel do we fail yeah we
[1:09:56] fail but but his grace is sufficient
[1:09:59] he gives us strength even to rise back
[1:10:02] up and even when we're a struggle there
[1:10:05] that's moving on and our feelings are
[1:10:07] this way or our feelings are this way
[1:10:09] but down on the inside there is
[1:10:11] something greater than a feeling it is
[1:10:14] the word of the living god
[1:10:16] that's down on the inside our lives are
[1:10:19] not lived in vain
[1:10:22] hallelujah
[1:10:25] this is where jesus you know remember he
[1:10:27] would speak
[1:10:28] when he's speaking about
[1:10:30] where
[1:10:32] when he come to the woman of the well we
[1:10:34] were looking at that a little bit last
[1:10:35] week how you had a person that had such
[1:10:37] a
[1:10:38] a thirst and a desire
[1:10:41] and satan likes to try to pervert
[1:10:44] true desires
[1:10:47] that's good right that's what he tries
[1:10:49] to do
[1:10:50] because just as you know when brother
[1:10:51] braham covers that in 65 and the message
[1:10:53] stirs to me friends listen this message
[1:10:56] that god has sent this isn't building up
[1:10:58] a man this is god
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:01] i mean if you can really take it and
[1:11:03] take that word and feed on it
[1:11:05] it loosens it dismisses and dismantles
[1:11:09] the whole of the enemy because we're not
[1:11:12] reading listen to me we're not reading
[1:11:14] or preaching this bible through a school
[1:11:17] of theology
[1:11:20] i know we get accused of following a man
[1:11:23] but let's just bring this to the table
[1:11:24] right now we get accused of following a
[1:11:27] man but where is it at where all of a
[1:11:30] sudden you can go to them and say well a
[1:11:32] woman shouldn't cut her hair or god
[1:11:34] still sends prophets and you start going
[1:11:36] in the scriptures with them and they'll
[1:11:37] say well you know what
[1:11:39] you know that the council said god that
[1:11:41] no longer applies so who's following a
[1:11:44] man
[1:11:45] you're following the word of a man and
[1:11:48] the bible said whosoever added or taken
[1:11:50] away his part will be taken out of the
[1:11:52] book of life we're not following a man
[1:11:55] we're following the pillar of fire
[1:11:57] brother this is not the interpretation
[1:12:00] of a man this is the interpretation of
[1:12:03] almighty god and god has stamped himself
[1:12:07] on this message
[1:12:10] hallelujah
[1:12:12] god himself has come down night after
[1:12:15] night after night and said amen
[1:12:19] [Applause]
[1:12:23] and your life is a testimony that this
[1:12:26] message is not the message of a man
[1:12:30] because a man can't produce that in your
[1:12:32] life
[1:12:34] a man can give you orders a man can give
[1:12:37] you creeds a man can give you doctrine
[1:12:39] but a man can never reproduce that life
[1:12:43] of jesus christ
[1:12:46] but god himself
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:50] she had a real desire
[1:12:53] and this is why
[1:12:55] brother brown would talk about different
[1:12:57] you know desires this right a desire you
[1:12:59] know for said young people you know and
[1:13:02] so forth to be married you know he said
[1:13:04] to be to have love to be loved he said
[1:13:07] it's natural
[1:13:08] for a woman to want to look beautiful
[1:13:11] right see that god put that there satan
[1:13:13] didn't
[1:13:19] i'd love to preach that sometimes god
[1:13:21] had given me and dealing with that how
[1:13:23] we look at godly beauty versus satan's
[1:13:24] beauty
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:28] satan does it in a manner to take away
[1:13:31] from what's real
[1:13:35] when brother branham points that out
[1:13:37] under the inspiration it says satan is
[1:13:39] her designer he's not talking about a
[1:13:42] real true woman of god
[1:13:44] he's speaking about how that they have
[1:13:47] been he has been yielded to the enemy
[1:13:49] and through perversion things and
[1:13:51] whether it's been stripped off or other
[1:13:53] things that's been used and now that's
[1:13:55] not god's desire but god's design is for
[1:13:58] a lady to be a real lady as a matter of
[1:14:01] fact let me tell you something sisters
[1:14:03] god has chosen you to display the bride
[1:14:07] of jesus christ he god has chosen even
[1:14:10] in your life even in your lives to be
[1:14:13] such a display of his choosing of his
[1:14:16] pride spiritually that we are all a part
[1:14:19] of but god has chosen that
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] praise god oh blessed be his name amen
[1:14:28] remember jesus said
[1:14:30] he said the hour's coming
[1:14:32] and it now is when the true worshipers
[1:14:35] will worship the father in spirit
[1:14:38] and in truth
[1:14:40] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:14:42] him this is why
[1:14:44] the word the lord jesus was standing
[1:14:47] there
[1:14:47] at that well of samaria because the
[1:14:49] father was seeking true worship
[1:14:53] seems like maybe he would have went down
[1:14:55] to the temple
[1:14:57] but he's seeking true worship
[1:15:02] he ain't looking at what her life is
[1:15:03] right now
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:06] he's looking beneath what is all the
[1:15:09] darkness and the mass of confusion all
[1:15:11] it takes is one moment in his presence
[1:15:15] and he will dismiss every darkness every
[1:15:18] doubt every every hole that's been
[1:15:21] upon her life that has tried to hold her
[1:15:24] down
[1:15:25] satan is trying to ruin her life
[1:15:33] but let's just put the devil on notice
[1:15:35] you can't destroy
[1:15:37] a seed of god
[1:15:40] you can't destroy the word of god
[1:15:44] there'll not be one word that'll fail
[1:15:48] i'm talking about you yeah i'm talking
[1:15:50] about me
[1:15:52] hallelujah this is why then in our lives
[1:15:55] think about the little woman that 90
[1:15:57] years old was led to the lord and was
[1:15:59] pointed out in that vision she was 90
[1:16:00] years old when you let her to the lord i
[1:16:02] don't care what kind of diseases came
[1:16:03] her way
[1:16:05] i don't care what kind of car accidents
[1:16:06] i don't care what came her way
[1:16:08] she might have we don't know her whole
[1:16:10] background we don't know all the
[1:16:11] heartaches but we know being 90 years
[1:16:13] old she made quite a journey we don't
[1:16:15] know how many times that the devil might
[1:16:17] have wanted to try to take her life but
[1:16:19] he couldn't get to her until that
[1:16:22] uniting had taken place within her life
[1:16:27] maybe she got hardened with things of
[1:16:29] life but you see no matter the hardening
[1:16:32] of things of life in the presence of
[1:16:34] almighty god and god begins to move on
[1:16:37] that heart you're not experiencing an
[1:16:39] angry god you're experiencing the
[1:16:42] tenderness and the mercy of a loving god
[1:16:45] that's there to set you free
[1:16:48] my my my mind
[1:16:51] god is a spirit and they that worship
[1:16:53] him
[1:16:54] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:16:56] and that woman when she said i know that
[1:16:58] messiah cometh and when he has come
[1:17:00] he'll tell us
[1:17:01] all these things
[1:17:03] i that speak to thee
[1:17:05] and he
[1:17:06] so this manifestation
[1:17:09] and i want to speak about that because
[1:17:12] this
[1:17:13] where i chose to place my name
[1:17:15] hallelujah
[1:17:17] now think of that
[1:17:18] god had many titles
[1:17:21] god would reveal himself
[1:17:24] and men under many different titles and
[1:17:26] and you know even how solomon would
[1:17:28] write by inspiration those were titles
[1:17:30] of how god had manifested himself to
[1:17:32] solomon this wasn't solomon just saying
[1:17:34] let me see let me get some good words
[1:17:36] here let me see if i can just write a
[1:17:38] song now and rhyme this to rhyme that no
[1:17:40] no no no this was inspiration this was
[1:17:43] personal he's the
[1:17:44] lily of the valley amen
[1:17:47] we're talking about personal
[1:17:50] these are experiences of who he has
[1:17:53] become to them aren't you glad that you
[1:17:55] can say he is redeemer he is my
[1:17:58] deliverer he is my savior those are all
[1:18:00] titles but those are titles attributes
[1:18:03] that he has manifested himself
[1:18:07] to you
[1:18:12] different titles jehovah jireh we see
[1:18:14] there in genesis 22
[1:18:18] jehovah
[1:18:20] jehovah shalom there with gideon and i
[1:18:22] wanted to say it in this way
[1:18:25] because here in his name when he says i
[1:18:27] will choose to place my name there then
[1:18:30] it will be a manifestation
[1:18:32] of his
[1:18:34] name
[1:18:35] and that manifestation of his name
[1:18:38] is the revealing of his word
[1:18:41] by his presence
[1:18:44] in other words let me just say the very
[1:18:46] spirit of god
[1:18:47] every time that he comes he comes with a
[1:18:49] purpose
[1:18:50] for every visitation through the
[1:18:53] scripture to fulfill the promise that he
[1:18:56] the spirit of god has made for a certain
[1:18:58] time for a certain group of people the
[1:19:01] holy spirit does not come in a service
[1:19:05] just
[1:19:06] to make us feel good
[1:19:10] the holy ghost in this hour has not come
[1:19:13] in a manner just to
[1:19:16] you know to boy i tell you what what a
[1:19:18] blessing it's it's a there's a purpose
[1:19:21] that god has come because remember
[1:19:24] without the holy ghost
[1:19:26] this is the mechanics without the
[1:19:28] dynamics of the holy ghost it'll stay
[1:19:31] right there
[1:19:33] but it takes the dynamics the breath of
[1:19:36] god to come upon that word and begin to
[1:19:40] breathe upon that word and as god is
[1:19:43] breathing on that word that's the same
[1:19:45] god that through that word being spoken
[1:19:48] under divine inspiration it is god
[1:19:51] declaring this is the hour this is the
[1:19:54] season and there is word in every life
[1:19:58] and the breath of god is the one that
[1:20:00] breathes upon our life to draw us from
[1:20:03] the world to inspire that word to our
[1:20:05] lives
[1:20:08] god comes for a visitation
[1:20:12] many have missed his visitation
[1:20:14] down through
[1:20:17] the time
[1:20:19] you know
[1:20:21] ben you know how to well you know i i i
[1:20:23] felt the holy spirit but god come for
[1:20:25] our purpose just like when he came to
[1:20:27] visit before before uh abraham's tent
[1:20:31] door it was for a purpose
[1:20:33] when god came to abram and spoke to him
[1:20:36] when he was there in the in the earth
[1:20:38] calde he came because there's a purpose
[1:20:41] yes
[1:20:42] that purpose wasn't all fulfilled nor
[1:20:45] was it all unfolded at that moment
[1:20:50] but it was the holy spirit that came
[1:20:53] to bring about and move us into the
[1:20:56] purpose of almighty god
[1:20:58] see this is where when jesus would say
[1:21:01] it like this in luke 21 verse 8
[1:21:04] he said take heed that you be not
[1:21:06] deceived
[1:21:07] for many shall come
[1:21:10] in my name
[1:21:12] saying
[1:21:13] i am christ
[1:21:15] and the time draweth near
[1:21:18] go you not therefore
[1:21:20] after them
[1:21:22] now he's announcing right there because
[1:21:23] remember be even before
[1:21:26] uh god became flesh
[1:21:29] remember there were those who rose up
[1:21:30] beforehand and leading people off in the
[1:21:32] desert
[1:21:33] right the scriptures did show us that
[1:21:36] and that's satan all while the reason
[1:21:38] satan's doing that is to try to dilute
[1:21:42] and take away from the promise of the
[1:21:44] word because he knows he can't defeat
[1:21:46] that word
[1:21:47] he knows he can't stop that word
[1:21:49] so what he tries to do is build unbelief
[1:21:52] in that word
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:55] let me just let's just bring it on down
[1:21:57] home i don't care how close it could
[1:21:58] have been let's bring it back to the
[1:22:00] days of the lord jesus before he ever
[1:22:02] walked here on earth there might have
[1:22:03] been some that their families went on
[1:22:05] out in the desert and they drank that
[1:22:07] kool-aid
[1:22:09] are you with me they might have had your
[1:22:11] mom and dad had the kool-aid stains all
[1:22:12] over their mouth and everything else if
[1:22:14] i'm the christ and following all this
[1:22:16] and so forth but there was there might
[1:22:17] have been young people that was sitting
[1:22:19] there and saying man alive i can't
[1:22:21] believe this i don't want nothing to do
[1:22:23] with this i don't want anything to do
[1:22:24] with that but yet down on the inside
[1:22:27] even though this could be said here you
[1:22:29] can't get away from what the word that
[1:22:31] god has already placed there within that
[1:22:34] life and though the darkness though the
[1:22:36] hardness though the complexes could be
[1:22:38] built up it will never stop god from
[1:22:41] getting one of his children he might
[1:22:44] have to soften him he might have to
[1:22:46] break it down but he'll never you'll
[1:22:48] never stop god from getting one of his
[1:22:50] children you say brother samuel why
[1:22:52] would that be said in that way well i
[1:22:54] believe he just said that to let you
[1:22:56] know that there's no circumstance
[1:22:58] greater than the word himself
[1:23:02] so if you were looking at a child or a
[1:23:04] loved one or whatever you say my
[1:23:05] goodness that's a big circumstance but
[1:23:08] it's not bigger than god
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:13] you can't wall it up high enough
[1:23:15] you can't make the walls thick enough
[1:23:17] come on now i'm not talking about your
[1:23:19] strength i'm talking about the mighty
[1:23:21] god
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:25] mom
[1:23:28] so notice he said many will come
[1:23:31] in my name
[1:23:33] and they'll say i'm christ
[1:23:35] and he said the time's drawing near
[1:23:38] so it was drawing near
[1:23:40] to where it would be the outpouring of
[1:23:42] the holy ghost
[1:23:43] that was going to come
[1:23:48] now
[1:23:51] in first john chapter 4
[1:23:54] here john would write
[1:23:56] beloved
[1:23:57] believe not
[1:23:59] every spirit
[1:24:01] but try the spirits whether they are god
[1:24:05] notice what is to try the spirits
[1:24:11] i got dryness there don't want anybody
[1:24:12] to get
[1:24:15] you can't sneeze nowadays
[1:24:19] he's coughing
[1:24:20] believe it or not they're still sinus
[1:24:22] infections and i don't have one but
[1:24:28] i'll tell you what you you tell you i'll
[1:24:30] tell you a thing i mean how the enemy is
[1:24:32] so working nowadays with things but you
[1:24:34] know you've been in stores and other
[1:24:35] things right now and you hear people
[1:24:36] sneezing one or more in restaurants and
[1:24:39] i'm just so glad that you don't see
[1:24:40] people looking around like
[1:24:46] and we're saying friends we're not
[1:24:47] saying that things aren't real right but
[1:24:49] we're trusting in the lord right
[1:24:52] because never before when we would come
[1:24:54] to the house of god or anywhere else did
[1:24:56] were we concerned or somebody sneezes
[1:24:58] right
[1:24:58] well i don't know how we're on this
[1:25:00] or coffin
[1:25:05] i don't know how many times i've had
[1:25:07] i've just cough drops i have a lot of
[1:25:08] times with culture how many times i've
[1:25:10] had cough drops just to try to do what
[1:25:11] just to try so nothing is unsettled with
[1:25:13] people and so there's nothing let it
[1:25:16] coat my throat because my wife said
[1:25:17] since she said since the time i met you
[1:25:19] you had a cough
[1:25:25] who beloved believe not every spirit but
[1:25:28] try the spirits whether they are of god
[1:25:30] because many false prophets
[1:25:33] are gone out into the world hereby know
[1:25:36] you the spirit of god every spirit that
[1:25:38] confesseth that jesus christ has come in
[1:25:40] the flesh is of god now notice these
[1:25:43] words
[1:25:43] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[1:25:47] christ is come not
[1:25:49] did come right right
[1:25:52] are you hearing me now is present tense
[1:25:55] come
[1:25:57] in the flesh is a god
[1:26:00] and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:26:03] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[1:26:06] is not of god this is that spirit of
[1:26:09] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[1:26:11] it should come and even now already is
[1:26:14] it in the world
[1:26:16] so satan
[1:26:18] is his uh approach is in deception
[1:26:23] and if not for the abiding of the word
[1:26:26] i'm talking about before the holy ghost
[1:26:28] even come
[1:26:29] if not for the abiding of the word we
[1:26:32] would be swallowed right up in all of
[1:26:35] those things as well
[1:26:37] so we can't take any cred boy i studied
[1:26:39] this and i did this and i did that and i
[1:26:42] well why didn't you i mean why i mean
[1:26:44] why why did he have to go to calvary why
[1:26:45] did he have to send back the holy ghost
[1:26:49] it ain't what we did
[1:26:51] let me just tell you something before my
[1:26:54] dad ever came across this message god
[1:26:57] the holy spirit began to deal with his
[1:26:59] heart about things in the scriptures
[1:27:02] that he was seeing right there
[1:27:04] in the church of god
[1:27:07] things that he was seeing that he
[1:27:08] started to see on water baptism
[1:27:13] but there wasn't nothing there to
[1:27:14] confirm that
[1:27:16] but you see there was things already a
[1:27:18] hunger that was being stirred up where
[1:27:20] did that hunger come from to lead him
[1:27:23] into the scriptures to begin to say my
[1:27:26] i'm seeing this and tracing this over
[1:27:28] here and tracing this over here but you
[1:27:31] know how my dad i i didn't know about
[1:27:33] this for some time but dad standing
[1:27:35] there in west virginia he said the
[1:27:37] spirit of god spoke to him and said at
[1:27:39] the end of that train track that runs
[1:27:41] behind your house it'll direct you to
[1:27:44] the place where the truth is dad didn't
[1:27:46] know it till he was baptized down in
[1:27:48] jeffersonville that very train track
[1:27:51] goes right into jeffersonville
[1:27:58] i'm telling you god's in control
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:01] you might be looking at your children
[1:28:03] wondering about your children wondering
[1:28:05] about your loved ones but don't hang
[1:28:06] your head down you've got a great thing
[1:28:09] god he sought you out he came after you
[1:28:12] he did a work in your life have
[1:28:14] confidence that the same god who sucks
[1:28:17] you out and did a work in your life that
[1:28:19] same god will do it for them as well
[1:28:25] hereby know me the spirit of god every
[1:28:27] spirit that confesses that even jesus
[1:28:30] is come in the flesh is of god
[1:28:32] it's speaking of the word made flesh
[1:28:35] the real true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:39] where the word becomes flesh are you
[1:28:40] hearing me you see i wasn't just talking
[1:28:43] about when we talk about antichrist
[1:28:45] you realize it wasn't just those who
[1:28:47] were just passing away and saying well
[1:28:49] we don't believe in the spirit
[1:28:51] but now it comes down what does what is
[1:28:52] the purpose the purpose of the coming of
[1:28:54] the holy spirit is to confirm that place
[1:28:58] of worship
[1:29:00] so that the believers in that hour might
[1:29:03] recognize the place of acceptance that
[1:29:06] they might be drawn and come into that
[1:29:09] place where there's no condemnation god
[1:29:12] has reserved that responsibility to
[1:29:15] himself to confirm his word to his
[1:29:18] children
[1:29:19] and god calls us into this place
[1:29:24] that's why
[1:29:26] our lives
[1:29:27] it the the real
[1:29:29] baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:29:31] quickening of that word that makes that
[1:29:34] word live
[1:29:35] in our life
[1:29:37] where our heart beats for god
[1:29:42] you see this coming of the antichrist
[1:29:45] spirit in that
[1:29:47] even there of the holy ghost remember
[1:29:48] here it came brother brown would bring
[1:29:50] this out the dove
[1:29:53] and the crow there in in in the raven in
[1:29:55] noah's ark you had the two run to
[1:29:57] parallel
[1:29:58] and moses and balaam right yeah right
[1:30:02] i mean balaam come under anointing
[1:30:05] is that right yes
[1:30:07] he came under anointing even things that
[1:30:09] were spoken through balaam
[1:30:12] they were true yeah right i'm talking
[1:30:14] about prophecies a star shall arise up
[1:30:16] out of jacob
[1:30:18] that took discernment of the spirit of
[1:30:20] god to be able to know
[1:30:22] that even within that because you
[1:30:24] remember while the wise men came and
[1:30:26] found the lord jesus it's because there
[1:30:28] had been a prophet down in babylon
[1:30:30] by the name of daniel that had taken
[1:30:32] them back in the scriptures and showed
[1:30:33] them that this is god's word and god
[1:30:36] will always keep his word
[1:30:38] and so those wise men were coming there
[1:30:41] on the word of a prophet that had been
[1:30:44] issued in in prophecy and here they were
[1:30:47] in position
[1:30:50] so the antichrist and the holy spirit
[1:30:52] running side by side brother ramsay just
[1:30:55] about the time i don't have this on the
[1:30:57] board just about the time that the holy
[1:30:58] spirit fell the antichrist spirit fell
[1:31:01] and he says notice he says
[1:31:04] it's just about in the last days when
[1:31:05] the antichrist is showing his colors
[1:31:07] inside the sixth seal coming up through
[1:31:09] these politics and things just about the
[1:31:11] time the antichrist moves himself fully
[1:31:13] on the scene god moves himself fully on
[1:31:16] to redeem his own it just runs right
[1:31:18] together all the time cain and abel
[1:31:21] judas and jesus and so forth so here we
[1:31:24] come into a play
[1:31:25] remember the bible
[1:31:27] has spoken to us
[1:31:29] in the scriptures regarding this name
[1:31:32] and notice here in the scripture let me
[1:31:34] just try to lay this part in
[1:31:36] here when jesus had said in john 15 26
[1:31:39] when the comforter has come
[1:31:41] whom i will send unto you from the
[1:31:43] father even the spirit of truth which
[1:31:45] proceedeth from the father he shall
[1:31:47] testify
[1:31:49] of me
[1:31:52] see what the holy spirit does it comes
[1:31:54] to confirm
[1:31:55] the
[1:31:56] word it becomes a testimony of a witness
[1:32:01] of the lord jesus christ and ye also
[1:32:03] shall bear witness
[1:32:05] because ye have been with me
[1:32:07] from the beginning john 16 13
[1:32:10] when he
[1:32:11] the spirit of truth is come
[1:32:13] he will guide you into all truth
[1:32:16] amen i'm dealing with evidence right now
[1:32:19] of the holy ghost he will guide you into
[1:32:21] all truth
[1:32:23] he shall not speak of himself in other
[1:32:25] words he doesn't draw attention to the
[1:32:28] vessel
[1:32:30] his attention is strictly in revealing
[1:32:34] himself through that life
[1:32:38] so it becomes a son or a daughter of god
[1:32:40] on display by the life of god but
[1:32:43] whatsoever he shall hear
[1:32:46] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:32:49] things to come
[1:32:51] so here not only they're present to
[1:32:53] guide us he's not only there present
[1:32:56] that it opens and opens our ears to hear
[1:33:00] what he is saying
[1:33:02] and he is a spokesman through our life
[1:33:04] but he also shows us things to come yes
[1:33:07] amen now i wish i could really preach on
[1:33:09] that one right now is this coming
[1:33:12] think about that you see not only do we
[1:33:14] need leadership
[1:33:16] into the truth right
[1:33:18] but god also and when we talk about show
[1:33:20] us things to come we're not just talking
[1:33:22] about prophecy
[1:33:24] right
[1:33:25] you realize everything that's taking
[1:33:26] place in the world right now is driven
[1:33:28] by prophecy all right
[1:33:29] not the president it's not the vatican
[1:33:31] it's not it's prophecy
[1:33:33] that's what's driving everything amen
[1:33:36] is that right
[1:33:38] but even on our own individual lives
[1:33:41] we need him to show us things to come in
[1:33:44] other words when there's times we're
[1:33:46] getting ready to make decisions we need
[1:33:49] him to uncover if you go this way
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:54] amen
[1:33:56] but it's your decision
[1:33:57] we need him because he's the one he's a
[1:34:00] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:34:02] the heart i'm so glad
[1:34:05] that in our lives god help us to stay in
[1:34:07] that place to even when we feel like
[1:34:09] i've made in my mind i feel pretty sure
[1:34:11] about this but let us always remain
[1:34:14] sensitive to say lord amen you got the
[1:34:18] last word on this
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:21] that's right i might have good vibes
[1:34:22] about this or good feelings about this
[1:34:24] or i might feel all about this or
[1:34:26] whatever more come on i'm preaching
[1:34:27] right down to where the rubber hits the
[1:34:29] road right now this is one of the
[1:34:31] purposes of the coming of the holy ghost
[1:34:33] it ain't there so oh my we're walking on
[1:34:36] the clouds and everything else and i
[1:34:37] think of how brother browning used to
[1:34:39] put it you're so heavenly minded you're
[1:34:40] no earthly good
[1:34:43] come on now the bible says thy will be
[1:34:46] done but then that that will as he said
[1:34:49] in prayer he said thy will that is in
[1:34:51] heaven that it would be done in earth in
[1:34:54] earth
[1:34:56] that heaven would be reflected in earth
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:01] leave my life let it be influenced that
[1:35:04] divine connection there where the holy
[1:35:06] spirit has come and standing there
[1:35:09] there's no more chasm but he has filled
[1:35:11] the breach and we are tied back in to
[1:35:14] our theophany our representation before
[1:35:17] the throne of god just as much as a
[1:35:19] delegate of this area we would think
[1:35:22] would represent us down in washington dc
[1:35:25] and you vote for him and it's one person
[1:35:27] standing on your behalf let me tell you
[1:35:29] what the holy ghost it's one who's
[1:35:31] always stood for you and now the holy
[1:35:34] spirit himself he comes back to find you
[1:35:37] and bring you back to yourself and
[1:35:39] connect you back into your true
[1:35:42] representation
[1:35:44] we are seated
[1:35:46] in heavenly places
[1:35:50] delegates
[1:35:52] delegates
[1:35:55] of that heavenly jerusalem
[1:35:58] of the throne of god
[1:36:00] i feel like i'm all over the place here
[1:36:09] i hope that cake comes out good
[1:36:14] he'll lean and guide us into all truth
[1:36:16] we need all of that amen
[1:36:18] amen aren't you glad for that
[1:36:20] how he guides us in our lives and says
[1:36:24] more unfolds for us and we walk in it
[1:36:26] every one of us can every one of us can
[1:36:28] testify to this point there's things
[1:36:30] that god has dealt with our lives and we
[1:36:32] look back on and said god
[1:36:35] oh my i see it in a way now that my that
[1:36:38] that that's kind of been all along and
[1:36:40] yet god comes now and he deals with our
[1:36:42] heart in such a place and such a measure
[1:36:45] why it's a honing time it's honing in on
[1:36:49] things on our life the greatest thing
[1:36:52] compliment we can do is to just look to
[1:36:54] the lord and say lord wash me cleanse me
[1:36:57] lord and let that part of the word so
[1:37:00] live through me lord as i die to myself
[1:37:03] let him guide us into all truth
[1:37:08] i'm not talking about sinless perfection
[1:37:10] in the flesh i'm talking about guiding
[1:37:12] us into all truth
[1:37:15] amen
[1:37:17] john 5 43 well i'm trying to get
[1:37:19] somewhere here a little bit
[1:37:22] john 5 43
[1:37:24] i am come
[1:37:26] in my father's name
[1:37:29] and you receive me not here he is
[1:37:31] standing before the pharisees
[1:37:33] now they knew all the titles
[1:37:36] they they knew about
[1:37:38] i mean they could take you to a place
[1:37:39] with
[1:37:40] they could probably take you on a tour
[1:37:41] of mount sinai and say well he he stood
[1:37:44] about right here
[1:37:45] they could go through all those things
[1:37:47] they knew brother graham tells us in
[1:37:48] spoken words original seed they knew the
[1:37:51] history
[1:37:52] of the god of moses
[1:37:54] but they didn't know the god
[1:37:57] of moses
[1:37:59] and here he stands before them i am come
[1:38:03] in my father's name
[1:38:06] now let's just let's just let me just
[1:38:08] have just a few moments and i'm just
[1:38:09] going to parachute out of here
[1:38:12] that name so to think of it the name of
[1:38:14] the father is jesus
[1:38:18] i'm just reading quotes here i don't
[1:38:19] have it there but i'm just going to
[1:38:20] refer to it the name of the father is
[1:38:22] jesus because jesus said so i carry my
[1:38:26] father's
[1:38:27] name
[1:38:33] you see even though even how the
[1:38:35] prophets would call him
[1:38:36] jesus you know
[1:38:38] even before his birth the prophets call
[1:38:40] him his name will be called emmanuel god
[1:38:43] with us his name's is not emmanuel but
[1:38:46] it would be called emmanuel god with us
[1:38:50] it was god who was manifested in the
[1:38:52] flesh now to think about this god placed
[1:38:55] his
[1:38:56] name in a man
[1:39:00] is that right not a church
[1:39:02] not a denomination not a creed but a man
[1:39:05] he chose to place his name in jesus
[1:39:08] christ he became the place of god's
[1:39:11] worship where you worship him
[1:39:15] think about how jesus said in john 17
[1:39:18] 6
[1:39:19] i have manifested thy name
[1:39:23] unto the men which thou gavest me out of
[1:39:27] the world
[1:39:29] now there are many parts to that name
[1:39:30] remember
[1:39:31] moses
[1:39:33] was hidden in the rock and god caused
[1:39:36] his glory to pass by and there he
[1:39:39] proclaimed the name of the lord and the
[1:39:42] name of the lord it was not just not
[1:39:45] saying out jesus jesus but the name that
[1:39:48] was being proclaimed was god's own
[1:39:52] life all of the different attributes and
[1:39:56] characteristics of that name so the name
[1:39:59] itself when we say the name is jesus the
[1:40:02] name of the father is jesus god
[1:40:05] condescended he had to take on a human
[1:40:08] name in redemption but it was god's own
[1:40:12] life that is the name that's why in a
[1:40:15] service when the presence of god and the
[1:40:18] spirit of god is moving right here among
[1:40:21] his children we can say jesus is here
[1:40:25] it's not the corporal body but it's the
[1:40:27] same jesus that lived in that corporal
[1:40:30] body it's the same jesus that's
[1:40:32] vindicating that this is my place of
[1:40:36] worship not talking about a building but
[1:40:38] he's talking about the word that he has
[1:40:42] given for this hour
[1:40:46] he confirms it he manifests his name so
[1:40:49] his name
[1:40:50] reveals the place of acceptance his name
[1:40:53] reveals the place of his choosing his
[1:40:56] name being manifest reveals the place
[1:40:59] that he intends every worshiper to dwell
[1:41:02] amen notice brother graham said there's
[1:41:05] so many infallible proofs
[1:41:07] that jesus is the place
[1:41:10] he is the gate
[1:41:12] he is the name
[1:41:14] and the only provided way
[1:41:16] that god has for man
[1:41:19] to meet in worship
[1:41:20] i'm reading this one to you i've got
[1:41:22] that on the screen
[1:41:24] he is the way
[1:41:26] the truth the life the gate the door
[1:41:29] the alpha omega the beginning and the
[1:41:31] ending rosa sharon the lily of the
[1:41:33] valley the morning star the alpha omega
[1:41:36] he is all
[1:41:38] the whole thing
[1:41:39] put together amen he is both root and
[1:41:42] offspring of david the bride and morning
[1:41:44] star in him
[1:41:47] dwells the fullness of the godhead
[1:41:49] bodily
[1:41:50] where we
[1:41:52] in there are sons and daughters to god
[1:41:56] in god's
[1:41:58] godhead where we in there are sons and
[1:42:03] daughters of god
[1:42:05] praise the lord in god's
[1:42:08] godhead
[1:42:10] so when the fullness of the godhead
[1:42:12] bollywood that is the word itself god
[1:42:16] himself
[1:42:17] this is where our identity
[1:42:20] lays is in him amen
[1:42:24] oh glory be to god
[1:42:25] notice this and his sons and daughters
[1:42:28] were in the family
[1:42:30] if you're in there
[1:42:32] now think about this brother rabbit goes
[1:42:34] on he says now this this great place he
[1:42:36] said how do we get into this place if
[1:42:39] jesus is the place he is the name of god
[1:42:42] he's the place of god's worship he's the
[1:42:45] only door to the sheepfold and we want
[1:42:47] to find out how we get into him now
[1:42:51] think about this when you come into him
[1:42:53] you become family
[1:42:57] when you become family you begin to
[1:42:59] manifest
[1:43:01] that family name
[1:43:04] i mean you know it doesn't matter what
[1:43:06] family you know you
[1:43:08] you look back in the surname the family
[1:43:10] name and
[1:43:11] just like for my own self there's
[1:43:13] certain things that i can see certain
[1:43:15] characteristics of
[1:43:16] you know
[1:43:17] from my parents and in in the children
[1:43:19] and see certain things that have come
[1:43:21] out why because the name you need to
[1:43:24] name browning just having the last name
[1:43:26] browning just having the last name
[1:43:28] browning will not do it
[1:43:30] are you hearing me
[1:43:31] it it has to it's more that last name
[1:43:34] browning that's why somebody could look
[1:43:36] and say hey you look like a brownie
[1:43:38] because they're thick don't mean they're
[1:43:40] browning
[1:43:43] but you see somebody can look at
[1:43:45] something and they're looking say hey
[1:43:47] are you are you so and soar are you a
[1:43:49] sanchez or are you in this or are you a
[1:43:52] gomez and they'll start looking are you
[1:43:53] a keener and they'll start looking at
[1:43:55] certain things around there and pointing
[1:43:57] out why there's certain characteristics
[1:43:59] there are certain things that are
[1:44:00] carried on through that family that
[1:44:02] sometimes it's from way back if that's
[1:44:05] how it is in the natural how much
[1:44:07] greater is it in the spiritual
[1:44:10] amen
[1:44:12] we were always sons and daughters of god
[1:44:17] but it took the quickening power
[1:44:20] of the holy ghost the living god coming
[1:44:24] in his word to bring a real
[1:44:28] experience in our life that moves us
[1:44:32] from death unto life
[1:44:36] and we become family
[1:44:38] praise the lord
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:43] have mercy
[1:44:46] ephesians 3 14 for this cause i bound my
[1:44:49] name my knees unto the father of our
[1:44:51] lord jesus christ of whom the whole
[1:44:53] family in heaven and earth is named
[1:44:57] christ
[1:44:58] tell me what are you saying i'm saying
[1:45:00] if peter
[1:45:01] were to come down here this morning he
[1:45:03] wouldn't be ashamed all right
[1:45:06] brother branham could walk around not
[1:45:07] just into this church but we could
[1:45:09] fellowship together because we're in the
[1:45:11] same family
[1:45:13] but you don't get we don't get in a
[1:45:14] family buy you know my dad never asked
[1:45:16] me one day and said hey hey bud would
[1:45:18] you like to be a brownie i never joined
[1:45:21] it
[1:45:22] i know these are simple simple little
[1:45:24] things that's been all the way through
[1:45:25] the message we never joined it
[1:45:28] we never came to a spot to where
[1:45:29] eventually you know what this makes
[1:45:30] sense
[1:45:32] good theology just makes sense you know
[1:45:34] what i think i'll do that i think i'll i
[1:45:36] think that's what i'll do
[1:45:38] it's not we didn't join it
[1:45:42] it's not a joining it's a birth
[1:45:45] and a birth is a transformation yes amen
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:50] a birth is a death of the old man
[1:45:52] because before there can ever be a birth
[1:45:55] there's got to be a death
[1:45:58] to where that even though we in our
[1:46:01] lives might be part of that natural tree
[1:46:04] like here i am i'm still a brownie but
[1:46:06] you see there's a greater tree that we
[1:46:09] are a part of that the spirit of god has
[1:46:12] come upon our lives to bring to life
[1:46:16] that seed that was on the inside there
[1:46:19] was a desire to serve god
[1:46:21] but there was obstacles in the way but
[1:46:24] he
[1:46:24] came when he came let me just tell you
[1:46:27] something when he come he don't just
[1:46:29] start ripping obstacles out of the way
[1:46:31] he makes himself known to you and i it's
[1:46:34] such a love affair that there ain't a
[1:46:37] wall big enough to hold you back
[1:46:41] are you hearing me
[1:46:42] it wasn't a wall big enough to hold you
[1:46:44] back because the love of god is there to
[1:46:47] tear it down god won't rip things out of
[1:46:50] our hands he won't rip sin out of our
[1:46:53] life but he comes with a manifestation
[1:46:56] of his name and when he does it draws us
[1:46:59] to see
[1:47:01] i want you jesus
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] goodbye and you
[1:47:06] recognize lose
[1:47:08] of these things that are holding you
[1:47:10] back
[1:47:12] oh my let me let me finish on this part
[1:47:14] here
[1:47:16] how do we get in here
[1:47:18] the bible said by one spirit
[1:47:21] we're all baptized into one body
[1:47:23] that's first corinthians 12.
[1:47:26] now
[1:47:27] we can baptize
[1:47:29] people in here
[1:47:31] right and somebody has to
[1:47:33] completely just we have to tell them you
[1:47:35] know the cross and you know the hands
[1:47:37] and here we'll let you down and we'll
[1:47:38] bring you back up that's all our
[1:47:39] strength
[1:47:40] but we're fulfilling the word right
[1:47:42] but there's not a man
[1:47:44] that can baptize you
[1:47:46] into jesus christ
[1:47:49] you know sometimes you know i
[1:47:50] had a deacon or i had the deacons you
[1:47:52] know because sometimes that helped me
[1:47:53] out i'm weak after a service and things
[1:47:56] like that and that helps me out when
[1:47:57] they come up here and they baptize
[1:47:59] because i sometimes don't have hardly
[1:48:00] the strength and i'm concerned about
[1:48:02] maybe dropping somebody but to think
[1:48:04] about it jesus don't ever have somebody
[1:48:06] baptized for him
[1:48:09] he is the baptizer
[1:48:12] he's always present when it comes to
[1:48:13] being inducted into the body he's the
[1:48:16] one that baptizes us into the spirit
[1:48:20] this is the house of god
[1:48:22] this is the word of god this because a
[1:48:24] person can be baptized in water here and
[1:48:26] thank god that they would recognize
[1:48:28] repent of their sins but that's
[1:48:30] acknowledging an acceptance
[1:48:32] that's an asking for pardon
[1:48:36] are you hearing me
[1:48:37] but you see they can be baptized here
[1:48:40] and never go on to really
[1:48:43] receive the real overcoming life
[1:48:46] they can go right out you know in the
[1:48:48] world and everything else and maybe not
[1:48:49] go in the world but just sit on a church
[1:48:51] view
[1:48:52] are you hearing me
[1:48:54] but you see whenever that life becomes
[1:48:56] baptized into the holy
[1:48:58] ghost then
[1:49:01] it's no longer that person who's doing
[1:49:04] the living
[1:49:05] there is a reality that has struck that
[1:49:08] life on the inside they're no longer the
[1:49:10] same person
[1:49:11] their life is lived
[1:49:14] for the lord jesus christ
[1:49:17] it's just like let me just try to wrap
[1:49:19] this part of it up in this manner
[1:49:21] it's just like if you come to my house
[1:49:25] there's certain things we do in my house
[1:49:28] eating's one of them
[1:49:30] we do that pretty good
[1:49:34] but there's certain things the way
[1:49:35] things operate in our house
[1:49:37] you're welcome to come but this is how
[1:49:39] it's going to operate in our house
[1:49:42] there's an order
[1:49:43] in our family
[1:49:45] and there's an order in the family of
[1:49:49] god amen right right
[1:49:51] is that right like brother brahms said
[1:49:53] he said bran he said in our home we live
[1:49:56] like branhams
[1:49:59] right i mean who do you live like in
[1:50:01] your home
[1:50:03] hopefully you live like yourself right
[1:50:05] right hopefully you live like yourself
[1:50:08] there's an order in your home
[1:50:10] that you live by
[1:50:13] then so we're not shook in we're not
[1:50:14] joined in we're baptized in now watch
[1:50:17] this in paragraph 96 how long does it
[1:50:20] last when you get in there
[1:50:22] until you misbehave yourself
[1:50:25] ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy
[1:50:28] spirit of god whereby you are sealed
[1:50:30] unto the day of your redemption amen
[1:50:32] there's a possibility of grieving
[1:50:35] but inside
[1:50:36] inside the house of god
[1:50:38] the desire
[1:50:40] has been changed
[1:50:44] are you hearing me amen and there's
[1:50:45] things that we do have to say
[1:50:48] forgive me lord
[1:50:50] you know why because our desire even
[1:50:53] when we stood there and god brought
[1:50:55] conviction into our heart you know what
[1:50:56] i repent you know what real repentance
[1:50:58] is about is for recognizing not just
[1:51:01] that i'm a son and daughter of god but
[1:51:03] i've allowed that old nature to rule
[1:51:05] over my life
[1:51:08] and there's a greater one who's calling
[1:51:10] to me and i can yield to him
[1:51:15] how long does it last till you get in
[1:51:16] there until you misbehave yourself we're
[1:51:18] talking about real security by life of
[1:51:22] his presence
[1:51:24] brother said argue with him not me he
[1:51:26] said he said you're sealed until the day
[1:51:28] of your redemption until the day that
[1:51:29] jesus comes for you so you're not
[1:51:32] yourself let me just let me here wrap it
[1:51:34] up i know you keep hearing me say it but
[1:51:35] i really mean it you're not then
[1:51:37] yourself you're a new creature
[1:51:39] for the greek there means a new
[1:51:41] creation
[1:51:43] you've been re-created
[1:51:46] again
[1:51:48] all right
[1:51:49] the power of god comes upon you and you
[1:51:52] become created a new creature
[1:51:55] which
[1:51:56] brings the whole physical being
[1:51:59] spiritual being in everything
[1:52:01] in subject to the word of god amen not
[1:52:05] no other way
[1:52:07] amen
[1:52:08] you know for you and i when we stand
[1:52:10] here in our natural
[1:52:11] families
[1:52:13] it was
[1:52:14] a man and a woman who come together
[1:52:17] whether it's through hell holy wedlock
[1:52:18] or
[1:52:20] but and then needless to say
[1:52:22] there's a law
[1:52:23] of god right
[1:52:26] that
[1:52:26] when that of that life and that egg that
[1:52:29] that seed that comes together
[1:52:31] it's going there's going to be an
[1:52:32] offspring yeah so there had to be male
[1:52:35] and female
[1:52:37] is that right
[1:52:39] you have to think about it in our lives
[1:52:42] that seed of god
[1:52:44] was always there hallelujah
[1:52:47] was always there
[1:52:48] that representation of the word amen
[1:52:51] representation a part of the godhead
[1:52:54] lay within our life
[1:52:56] is that right remember when jesus came
[1:52:58] and said who do men say i am some say
[1:53:00] thou art jeremiah
[1:53:02] some say thou art some say they are this
[1:53:04] sometimes what is it each one of them
[1:53:06] were representing parts
[1:53:08] of the godhead right right
[1:53:10] to where when the the fullness of the
[1:53:12] godhead bodily was made manifest
[1:53:15] all of those colors that had been
[1:53:17] emitted down through those ages was now
[1:53:20] summed up in the person of jesus christ
[1:53:23] as he stood there in the fullness
[1:53:26] of his body
[1:53:29] is that right
[1:53:31] so now
[1:53:32] when we look at it this coming down in
[1:53:34] our lives
[1:53:36] the hour and the time that you and i are
[1:53:38] living in
[1:53:39] here within our life always a seed of
[1:53:41] god
[1:53:42] even of the things
[1:53:44] oh my i we we do we have no glory in
[1:53:47] that it's nothing but shame for things
[1:53:49] of the past
[1:53:50] of the where our lives were at
[1:53:53] but down beneath there was a seed down
[1:53:55] the whole time
[1:53:57] there was things that you can never
[1:53:59] satisfy
[1:54:01] we tried to try to satisfy that thirst
[1:54:05] but you couldn't quench it in any of the
[1:54:07] things of the world
[1:54:09] but it was that part that laid there
[1:54:12] but it needed the quickening power
[1:54:15] of god
[1:54:17] to come down
[1:54:20] this is why brother branham moved by the
[1:54:22] spirit of god would tell that eagle
[1:54:24] story over and over and especially in
[1:54:27] the last year of 1965 he almost used it
[1:54:30] every single service
[1:54:32] you know what that shows
[1:54:34] the eagle himself knew there was
[1:54:36] something different
[1:54:38] about me
[1:54:41] wanted to fit in
[1:54:43] something different he didn't know
[1:54:47] but mama eagle
[1:54:50] knew
[1:54:51] there was
[1:54:53] one of her children
[1:54:54] that was out there amen
[1:54:57] and she
[1:54:58] came
[1:54:59] and found him
[1:55:01] how did she find him not by earthly
[1:55:03] walkings
[1:55:05] she was flying into heaven
[1:55:09] amen
[1:55:10] hallelujah her eyesight from the heavens
[1:55:13] caught him that was on the ground and it
[1:55:15] was not an earthly scream from a
[1:55:17] seminary that caught his attention it
[1:55:20] was a heavenly voice
[1:55:23] it was a voice that was so inclined with
[1:55:25] heaven that heaven itself echoed back
[1:55:28] that message
[1:55:32] hallelujah a heavenly voice that reached
[1:55:35] down to you and i what did it do it
[1:55:37] causes our eyes not to look around right
[1:55:39] here not to look around at the dirt but
[1:55:42] to look up that's what the real true
[1:55:45] manifestation of jesus christ the name
[1:55:48] of god does it causes you to look away
[1:55:52] to jesus look beyond your circumstances
[1:55:55] look beyond the things of this earth
[1:55:58] because you are not a creature of time
[1:56:01] you are a creature of eternity
[1:56:04] you are never here just as a mere mortal
[1:56:07] upon this earth you are always a son and
[1:56:10] daughter of god amen
[1:56:13] and truly
[1:56:14] god has orchestrated many things
[1:56:17] to get you and i to where we are even
[1:56:19] right now this is why god would not even
[1:56:22] allow certain relationships to go on
[1:56:26] are you hearing me
[1:56:27] certain people you thought this or i'll
[1:56:29] go this way or i'll marry this one or
[1:56:31] i'll do this or i'll do that and how god
[1:56:33] himself has had everything in control
[1:56:36] even the best plans that we have we had
[1:56:39] certain plans of our future but god had
[1:56:42] different plans all along
[1:56:46] we didn't know it but his plans were out
[1:56:48] of this world
[1:56:52] i'm grateful for that if we can look
[1:56:54] back and see the hand of god upon our
[1:56:56] lives like that what about right now
[1:56:59] you can recognize the same god who came
[1:57:01] and sought us out brought us to himself
[1:57:03] that same god who would make
[1:57:06] himself known
[1:57:09] in the promise of his word
[1:57:11] for this day amen
[1:57:14] joy we're not just here gathered in a
[1:57:16] church just to be a church
[1:57:19] amen
[1:57:20] we've not gathered around this message
[1:57:22] because
[1:57:24] we're a bunch of rebels
[1:57:27] no
[1:57:29] that's a
[1:57:30] god calling to us as his children
[1:57:33] we've seen not just in the past but we
[1:57:36] see him making himself known not just
[1:57:39] here
[1:57:40] but in our own life
[1:57:44] and you know what that vindicates
[1:57:46] that life his life within us as it
[1:57:49] vindicates that we're in that place of
[1:57:51] worship
[1:57:54] we're in that place of worship
[1:57:57] we just stop this in clothing it's very
[1:57:59] very simple i know that
[1:58:02] very simple you if you won't have
[1:58:04] different examples you pray say god give
[1:58:05] him better examples
[1:58:08] but you know i like garlic
[1:58:11] and i know some of the rest of you do
[1:58:13] too
[1:58:16] but here's what my dad he came in my
[1:58:17] house
[1:58:19] and when my wife and i we really started
[1:58:21] cooking with garlic
[1:58:22] my dad would come in there and he said
[1:58:26] he'd pick up one of the boys he picked
[1:58:27] them up he said
[1:58:30] yeah you smell like your house
[1:58:34] your mom's been cooking with garlic
[1:58:35] again
[1:58:39] you see there was even some there was
[1:58:41] when i say that that seemed like a very
[1:58:42] carnal thing but you see that
[1:58:45] he knew
[1:58:46] that was an aroma in our home
[1:58:48] right now i went all the time because i
[1:58:50] you know you mostly nobody say i like
[1:58:52] candles that smell like cinnamon rolls
[1:58:54] and apple pies
[1:58:55] my wife sends me to pick out the candles
[1:59:02] richie he knew there was something about
[1:59:03] it
[1:59:04] this is from your house
[1:59:07] there's a certain smell or something
[1:59:09] but see it's even it's greater than that
[1:59:11] in the house of god
[1:59:13] your life my life declares
[1:59:17] where we're dwelling in the house of god
[1:59:19] by the way that we conduct our lives
[1:59:22] by even the things and the priorities
[1:59:25] and the life and the thing that we live
[1:59:26] you see friends it's one thing for us to
[1:59:28] say well i love the lord but realizing
[1:59:30] in saying we love the lord we realize it
[1:59:32] can't just be something that's up here
[1:59:34] and have just a thought of it but love
[1:59:36] the lord is something that should come
[1:59:38] out of our life
[1:59:40] that's what declares that we're in the
[1:59:41] house of god
[1:59:43] it's our life being lived according to
[1:59:46] the word because once we've been
[1:59:47] recreated
[1:59:48] it took that
[1:59:50] of god coming to his word and recreating
[1:59:52] we're a new creation
[1:59:54] it's no longer you or me trying to oh
[1:59:57] i'm going to try to live a christian
[1:59:58] life
[2:00:00] it's not that it's a supernatural god
[2:00:03] coming in a supernatural way
[2:00:05] doing a supernatural act in our life and
[2:00:07] you know the only thing that i had to do
[2:00:09] is just
[2:00:10] surrender that's all i had to do was
[2:00:13] surrender
[2:00:14] it's just yield to him and he come and
[2:00:16] done it
[2:00:17] how many witnesses that that's the truth
[2:00:19] you're just surrendered
[2:00:20] he just surrendered
[2:00:22] and matter of fact even when things are
[2:00:23] taking place you're not even aware of
[2:00:25] what's going on
[2:00:26] it's just my goodness things are just
[2:00:28] happening and how how things are just
[2:00:30] moving things are being turned around
[2:00:31] and you look back and you look back over
[2:00:33] your walk in your life and you say my
[2:00:35] goodness how god has been moving even up
[2:00:37] to this place at this point
[2:00:39] it's supernatural how god moves us
[2:00:42] the family of god
[2:00:45] we were always sons and daughters of god
[2:00:47] i
[2:00:47] we can't get to where i wanted to get to
[2:00:49] but
[2:00:50] as we've been recreated
[2:00:53] in him
[2:00:54] then our lives declare
[2:00:56] where we
[2:00:58] are dwelling
[2:00:59] in the house
[2:01:01] of god
[2:01:03] the way our life is lived just as much
[2:01:05] as the manifestation of his name can
[2:01:08] declare this is where my worship is at
[2:01:11] that's the same way his name is life
[2:01:14] dwelling in our lives and we in him it
[2:01:17] declares
[2:01:18] we are in him
[2:01:20] and he
[2:01:21] is in us
[2:01:22] so it's not it's not about what we say
[2:01:25] it's what he says
[2:01:27] he comes and vindicates it in our
[2:01:29] actions in our talkings and our doings
[2:01:34] vindicates it in our repentance
[2:01:38] the house of god
[2:01:40] asparagus

[2:05:57] lord we're thankful for the grace of god
[2:06:00] that's helped us to see not just the

[2:06:11] not that lord your expectation of us is
[2:06:14] all that you get everything just right

[2:07:07] god
[2:07:08] we want to be solely solely
[2:07:12] under your influence
[2:07:14] because lord you've not asked us to live
[2:07:17] life like somebody else
[2:07:19] you've not asked us to emulate someone
[2:07:21] else's life
[2:07:24] but you've got a purpose
[2:07:26] for our lives
[2:07:29] so many times lord we can look
[2:07:31] and look far off to something here or
[2:07:33] something there and mild we look at this
[2:07:37] and we fail to ask you lord
[2:07:42] where i am
[2:07:43] what's the purpose

[2:08:24] congregation here it didn't dawn on me
[2:08:26] lord to even some some weeks ago
[2:08:30] and i looked back lord
[2:08:32] i thought my goodness
[2:08:34] when all this
[2:08:35] i know there were certain cases of this
[2:08:37] covid that was already here in fall of
[2:08:39] 2019 we didn't know about it
[2:08:41] even the people that were around in this
[2:08:43] community lord when i talked with
[2:08:44] different nurses and different ones in
[2:08:46] this community
[2:08:48] certain things that they said they saw
[2:08:51] they didn't know what it was it wasn't
[2:08:52] tested positive or flu or anything else
[2:08:55] but they believed that it was already
[2:08:56] here back then
[2:08:58] we didn't know about that lord we had
[2:08:59] lord god it was something lord sure we
[2:09:01] could read about it i read about it in
[2:09:03] the first part of january 2020 but i had
[2:09:05] no idea didn't the lord didn't didn't
[2:09:07] really look lord look at anything at
[2:09:09] that time none of us did
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:12] but i think lord god from the fall of
[2:09:14] 2019
[2:09:16] through a portion of 2020 not me
[2:09:19] but you lord yes
[2:09:22] we never lord as i wanted to speak and
[2:09:24] minister on those stages and steps in
[2:09:26] the journey of a believer how that
[2:09:28] you're with us lord every part through
[2:09:30] our life you guide us lord through the
[2:09:32] red sea you take us to the waters of
[2:09:33] mara then you take us to the lord the
[2:09:35] palms of elim for refreshment lord then
[2:09:38] you bring us soul god into times of
[2:09:40] wells oh god
[2:09:41] but lord jesus here we were
[2:09:44] at the waters of mara
[2:09:48] to recognize the simplicity
[2:09:52] where you would open moses's eyes
[2:09:55] to a tree
[2:09:57] a bush
[2:10:00] brother branham would call it lord of
[2:10:02] that simple
[2:10:03] bush
[2:10:04] that would represent faith
[2:10:07] hyssop
[2:10:09] and speak of how that was cut down
[2:10:12] and thrown into the water
[2:10:14] and it was through
[2:10:16] you lord
[2:10:18] that the water became sweet
[2:10:21] lord jesus
[2:10:23] man can't know that
[2:10:25] the father even through this testing
[2:10:27] times and trials
[2:10:30] sure lord god there's been a lot of
[2:10:31] things around us fear has tried to come
[2:10:34] paul himself said i have fears within
[2:10:36] and without
[2:10:37] a lot of things lord there's been
[2:10:38] unsettledness even at times as i've
[2:10:41] prayed with different ones
[2:10:42] lord when they felt pressure about the
[2:10:44] vaccine or other things that's come
[2:10:46] their way
[2:10:48] lord jesus there's things that lord that
[2:10:51] some have faced lord
[2:10:53] where they dealt lord god throughout not
[2:10:55] just not lord not here
[2:10:58] not just here but throughout lord god
