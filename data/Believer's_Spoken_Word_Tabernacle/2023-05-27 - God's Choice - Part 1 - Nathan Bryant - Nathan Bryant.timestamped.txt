[36:24] he made a way
[36:27] we're just sold them so thankful to be
[36:29] gathered here tonight and for the
[36:32] different visitors that's come and
[36:34] ministering brothers and it just always
[36:36] means so much to us
[36:39] so much to have your brother Jonathan
[36:41] brother Paul the different ones are here
[36:44] God bless you amen we certainly are just
[36:47] just delighted most of all that the Lord
[36:50] Jesus is here
[36:52] because without him it would
[36:55] be just a gathering of people
[36:57] but where he is he promised he would
[37:00] gather
[37:01] in the midst of two or three that are
[37:04] gathered together in his name and I
[37:06] believe we're gathered in his name
[37:10] amen we've not we've not gathered by our
[37:12] own accord our own Works our own will
[37:15] but it surrendered hearts and lives to
[37:17] the will of God
[37:19] where would we be tonight if his grace
[37:20] had not found us
[37:23] oh my God
[37:26] I just uh just want to just say tonight
[37:29] it's just so good to to be here
[37:32] and uh maybe if you could just turn
[37:34] around and shake hands with one another
[37:36] greet one another in Christian love and
[37:39] we'll let you just have your seats just
[37:41] for a few moments
[37:51] praise the Lord
[37:57] [Music]
[37:58] brother Paul
[38:00] will you come and just sing just seeing
[38:02] something that's on your heart
[38:07] brother Nathan you'll be able to come
[38:09] when brother Paul is singing but I'm
[38:11] gonna
[38:12] it just um
[38:15] just some things you know as you come
[38:16] into a meeting and you know there's
[38:18] always a part of expectation and you
[38:20] look at and how brother Branham gave so
[38:23] many directions of things of even how we
[38:25] come into a meeting
[38:27] you know he spoke about how that
[38:29] sometimes he said our meetings are
[38:31] perceived as being odd or strange and he
[38:34] says
[38:35] the only thing we do he said is we just
[38:37] come and present ourselves
[38:40] we don't try to figure anything out or
[38:42] try to make anything happen that's the
[38:45] beauty of it we don't have to make
[38:46] anything happen all we have to do is
[38:49] surrender to him he's already made a way
[38:52] and we just want him to come and just
[38:55] pass by our way because just one word
[38:57] from him is all that's needed
[39:00] and I just kept this this this quote and
[39:03] brother Ben will say it many different
[39:04] times and I just kept looking and these
[39:06] just kept bubbling up in my heart
[39:08] throughout the week and just thinking of
[39:10] how when brother Branham would admonish
[39:12] Us in the scriptures even he would take
[39:14] that scripture you have not because you
[39:17] ask not and you ask not because you
[39:19] believe not
[39:21] he said he wants us to ask and believe
[39:23] that our Joys would be full
[39:26] he wants you to ask abundantly ask for
[39:29] big things
[39:31] don't limit your faith to some little
[39:33] Mustard Seed and get out here on some
[39:35] other kind of faith and but move out in
[39:37] big things big things is just as easy to
[39:40] receive as little things
[39:43] so whatever the need is whatever the
[39:45] obstacle the opposition let me just tell
[39:48] you tonight Satan's a liar
[39:51] and if he's standing there and trying to
[39:53] put up a front on ground that God has
[39:55] given to you just take the side with the
[39:58] word as the word exposes him just stand
[40:00] on the side of the word and you watch
[40:02] the word dismantle every argument and
[40:04] every tongue and every discrepancy
[40:06] that's tried to be raised and you take
[40:09] what belongs to you
[40:11] [Music]
[40:13] the big things is just as easy to
[40:15] receive as little things and he says
[40:17] could you imagine talking about
[40:19] exhausting God's love and power and
[40:21] beneficiaries for you and then he talks
[40:23] about a little fishy being in the middle
[40:25] of the ocean I love this simplicity he
[40:28] said well you know could you imagine
[40:29] that little fishy saying wait a minute I
[40:31] better consider this I I better drink
[40:33] this water sparingly because it might
[40:35] run out
[40:36] brother Brahman says that could be done
[40:39] more easily
[40:41] than you could ask too much of God
[40:45] it's more possible for a fish to drink
[40:47] up the ocean it's more possible than for
[40:51] you to exhaust
[40:53] almighty God
[40:56] I say Amen
[40:59] we've come here to draw on the Fountain
[41:01] of Life and this the fountain that is
[41:04] open in the House of David he's here
[41:06] amen for whatever the need is he's here
[41:08] to minister attorneys let's just draw
[41:10] and I don't matter what it is just ask
[41:13] God for big things put it on your heart
[41:15] and as God comes right through the
[41:17] ministering of the word just say I take
[41:19] it Lord if something strikes your heart
[41:21] just make it right right there and go on
[41:23] and receive the blessings of God Amen

[41:52] our brother in his ministry and we just
[41:55] want to pull on the gift of God whatever
[41:56] whatever vessel God uses we want to
[42:00] recognize him because that's what's
[42:01] important is to recognize him God has a
[42:05] many different variety of many different
[42:06] bouquet but we just want to recognize
[42:08] him blue flowers red flowers yellow
[42:12] flowers but it's all flowers we just

[51:45] that's that's good
[51:47] now brother Paul
[51:49] I appreciate you coming and being here
[51:50] in the service and I I remember meeting
[51:53] him when I was a little boy but these
[51:55] two brothers over here
[51:56] the first time I met them
[51:59] was byc 2019 and the way we met each
[52:04] other was we all three kind of met in a
[52:09] prayer line there was a sister that was
[52:11] having a demonic manifestation there and
[52:13] all three of us got to her and began to
[52:16] pray for her and you you get to know
[52:17] Brothers pretty quick that way
[52:20] Tried by fire and so
[52:22] certainly appreciated amen their their
[52:26] faith in that time and and appreciate
[52:29] you getting to know these brothers
[52:30] better brother Samuel's been and
[52:32] ministered for us and this was been a
[52:34] blessing and appreciate these Pastor
[52:36] Brothers I'm thankful for pastors that
[52:38] are standing for the word of this age
[52:41] amen
[52:42] we need them
[52:45] so I I was cutting my grass a few days
[52:49] ago and listening to a tape as I was as
[52:52] I was going around cutting the grass
[52:53] with my push more and the Lord just uh
[52:56] brother man said something in a quote
[52:59] there and the Lord just dropped a title
[53:00] down into my heart when he said that and
[53:02] so we want to look at this tonight with
[53:04] the help of the Lord I don't say this to
[53:07] be humble I say it sincerely I feel like
[53:09] I should be out here tonight listening
[53:11] to one of these brothers Minister but I
[53:15] know the Lord does all things well even
[53:16] if we don't understand sometimes and and
[53:19] I know what it's like to to be a
[53:22] preacher and to pour yourself out
[53:24] sometimes it's nice to sit and hear
[53:25] another brother preach and and to fill
[53:28] up so I pray that God will get me into
[53:29] the channel to say something that will
[53:31] not just encourage the laity but it'll
[53:33] encourage the minister Brothers tonight
[53:34] as well I believe we all need
[53:35] encouragement this hour
[53:38] first Samuel chapter 16 and verse 6 if
[53:41] you want to turn with me tonight we want
[53:43] to read a couple verses there and then
[53:45] I'll just read a short quote tonight and
[53:49] we'll go to the Lord in prayer
[53:51] first Samuel chapter 16 and verse 6.
[53:56] and there were many from back home that
[53:59] wanted me to greet you but I'm afraid if
[54:01] I begin to tell you all the ones that
[54:03] said to greet you'll forget somebody so
[54:05] just greetings from the home Church
[54:07] and the Believers there first Samuel
[54:09] chapter 16 and verse 6 and it came to
[54:12] pass
[54:13] when they were come
[54:15] that he looked on eliab and said surely
[54:19] the Lord's anointed is before him
[54:23] now I want you to remember this is a
[54:25] Vindicated prophet of God
[54:28] and he looks and he says surely this is
[54:30] the king
[54:31] but the Lord said unto Samuel
[54:34] look not on his countenance
[54:37] or on the height of his stature
[54:40] because I have refused him
[54:43] for the Lord seeth not
[54:46] as man seeth
[54:48] for man Lucas on the outward appearance
[54:54] but the Lord looketh on the hearts
[54:58] brother Ben says in a sermon the
[55:00] second-handed robe in 1956 he says
[55:02] sometimes man's choice is a lot
[55:05] different than God's choice
[55:08] and we want to look at that tonight with
[55:10] the help of the Lord God's choice let's
[55:13] bow our heads together
[55:15] Lord Jesus
[55:16] truly we are so thankful
[55:19] Lord to be in a service like this where
[55:22] Believers of like Precious Faith or are
[55:25] gathered together
[55:27] and Lord we're so thankful for Lord the
[55:31] the leading Lord that she placed on
[55:33] brother Samuel's heart to have these
[55:35] meetings and Lord and and for the the
[55:38] home church here the Believers but Lord
[55:41] we're also so thankful to see other
[55:42] brothers that'll come out and and
[55:44] fellowship Lord and in this age when so
[55:47] many are drawing lines in the sand to
[55:50] see Brothers draw circles bigger Lord it
[55:52] blesses my heart and Lord truly I
[55:55] believe that was the nature that you had
[55:57] when you were here and Lord the nature
[56:00] when you sent a prophet in our age his
[56:02] nature was to draw the circle bigger for
[56:04] fellowship with other brothers and so
[56:06] we're so thankful to see that being made
[56:09] manifest today and other brothers that
[56:11] are faithful to follow the leading of
[56:14] the Holy Spirit and I just pray that
[56:16] this service tonight Lord would be an
[56:18] encouragement to each one Lord I Have
[56:22] Nothing in myself to bring that would be
[56:25] able to encourage someone in the battles
[56:27] the trials the pressures that they're
[56:30] facing tonight but Lord I I'm not
[56:33] depending on my ability tonight so Lord
[56:36] when you're depending on you to show up
[56:38] father we know that if you show up that
[56:40] you do all things well Lord that you can
[56:43] encourage the discourage that you can
[56:45] mend the Brokenhearted that Lord you can
[56:48] save the lost and fill the empty and
[56:51] heal the sick so so Lord I'm thankful
[56:53] that we're not depending on the Flesh of
[56:55] a man tonight but we're depending on
[56:57] Jesus Christ
[56:59] Lord in the power of your Resurrection
[57:02] because truly whatever need there is
[57:04] tonight father you're you're more than
[57:07] able
[57:09] so we pray Lord tonight that every need
[57:11] would Supply I pray that you get the
[57:13] human instrumentality out of the way
[57:15] where you can speak something Lord and
[57:17] get me in a channel Lord where your Holy
[57:20] Spirit can just go up and down the
[57:22] aisles and speak to hearts and encourage
[57:25] those that need it tonight may we go
[57:28] from here closer to you and
[57:30] stronger Lord than when we came in
[57:33] Father we'll give you the glory for it
[57:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[57:38] the church said
[57:39] amen God bless you richly you can be
[57:42] seated tonight
[57:49] I believe it was David said
[57:52] it's blessed that Brothers dwell
[57:54] together in unity
[57:57] and in the scripture reading tonight as
[57:59] we looked at
[58:00] David
[58:02] we found that Samuel yet being a prophet
[58:07] he did like many of us do and sometimes
[58:10] we do that outwardly and we look at
[58:13] somebody else and we judge them by their
[58:16] stature by their appearance or we judge
[58:19] them by what we've heard about them or
[58:22] what we know of them and I I want to
[58:26] look at some Bible characters tonight
[58:28] and and I hope that the Lord will would
[58:31] just drop this into our heart that if we
[58:33] had been choosing
[58:35] most of the people that God chose if
[58:37] we'll be honest with ourselves that's
[58:39] not who we would have chose
[58:43] and so when we look at it you know it's
[58:46] easy for us to look back there in the
[58:48] description say oh I know God called
[58:49] this one and God called that one but
[58:51] let's be honest with ourselves tonight
[58:52] and and place ourself back there and
[58:56] realize if we had been there and we had
[58:58] been able to see you know many times we
[59:00] read through the Bible and we read of
[59:01] the faith of Abraham and we read of many
[59:03] mighty works and and Supernatural things
[59:06] that happened at Abraham's life and we
[59:08] read through it and we read through
[59:10] about 30 years of Abraham's life in
[59:12] about two chapters and we think oh my
[59:13] his wife was so filled with the
[59:15] Supernatural and God just doing
[59:17] everything for him all the time but
[59:19] there were stages in Abraham's life in
[59:21] Daniel's life and Moses's life where
[59:24] there wasn't the supernatural being done
[59:26] every day and where maybe the voice of
[59:28] God was not just constantly with them
[59:30] and maybe they'd pray and seek and say
[59:32] God why why are you silent I have a need
[59:35] I have a I have a desire I have I have a
[59:38] problem and and they went through
[59:40] mountains and valleys just like we do
[59:42] they went through times but the random
[59:44] would say it this way he said God
[59:45] doesn't show His prophets everything he
[59:47] just shows them what he wants to show
[59:49] them and so even in brother bantam's
[59:51] life there would be things that maybe
[59:52] God wouldn't give him understanding of
[59:54] for years and he would wonder why this
[59:57] God and why that why did you have that
[59:59] why because he was a human being like
[1:00:01] you and I and he had ups and downs the
[1:00:04] Bible said that Elijah was a man of like
[1:00:06] passions just like us and we're not
[1:00:09] careful when we read the Bible or we
[1:00:11] read the message we put these characters
[1:00:14] in a category that really makes it not
[1:00:17] only unfair to them but it makes it
[1:00:19] unfair to us because we don't take the
[1:00:22] human part into accountability and then
[1:00:24] when our human weakness begins to get us
[1:00:26] in trouble we feel like a failure and we
[1:00:29] fail to remember the human parts of
[1:00:31] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Daniel
[1:00:34] and David and different ones that they
[1:00:36] had their ups and downs and and they had
[1:00:39] their problems and if you had been there
[1:00:40] and been able to see many of these men
[1:00:43] in their day-to-day a life and their
[1:00:45] mistakes and and their faults and their
[1:00:48] Humanity we would have struggled with
[1:00:50] them just like we struggle with our
[1:00:52] brothers and sisters today because
[1:00:54] brother M said God takes his man but not
[1:00:56] his Spirit Satan takes his man but not
[1:00:58] his spirit so history repeats itself and
[1:01:01] whatever your attitude is today brother
[1:01:03] random said that's what's your attitude
[1:01:04] would have been back then so Samuel yet
[1:01:08] a Vindicated Prophet yet he's still a
[1:01:10] human being he still has feelings he
[1:01:12] still has emotions he still has his own
[1:01:14] uh personality his own ideas and he goes
[1:01:18] and God hasn't told him who's going to
[1:01:19] be king he just says go down to Jesse's
[1:01:22] house and I'm going to have you anoint a
[1:01:23] man as king and so he goes down in the
[1:01:26] first son that comes out the eldest son
[1:01:28] of Jesse he's tall he's about Saul's
[1:01:30] height and he looks like he'd be a great
[1:01:33] strong man looks like the crown with
[1:01:34] video looks like the uh Almighty the the
[1:01:36] cloak would fit him and looks like he'd
[1:01:38] be so kingly he says this is the man
[1:01:41] that God has chosen why because that's
[1:01:43] who Samuel would have chose and God said
[1:01:45] no no no Samuel how wrong you are this
[1:01:49] is not a man after my own heart and he
[1:01:51] goes through all the brothers and they
[1:01:53] found out that the man that God had
[1:01:55] called his daddy didn't even cross his
[1:01:57] mind to call him and invite him to the
[1:01:59] anointing party
[1:02:01] left him on the back side of the desert
[1:02:03] with the seat no way is it going to be
[1:02:05] David all right
[1:02:07] didn't even think to call him and Samuel
[1:02:10] says hey if you got one more he said oh
[1:02:11] I do he's just a little scrawny guy down
[1:02:13] here with the Sheep he said well we
[1:02:15] won't even sit down and eat until you
[1:02:17] call him and bring him here and he
[1:02:19] brings him and God says this is a man
[1:02:21] after my own heart
[1:02:23] and he was God's choice
[1:02:26] but looking in the natural it wouldn't
[1:02:28] have been we'll be honest with ourselves
[1:02:30] it wouldn't have been our choice for
[1:02:31] King but it was God's choice
[1:02:34] amen and if you had looked at certain
[1:02:36] stages in David's life if you would have
[1:02:38] known David as a giant slayer you would
[1:02:42] have probably picked David and said oh
[1:02:44] my that's wonderful I can get behind a
[1:02:46] man like this but what about when David
[1:02:48] commits adultery with the woman and then
[1:02:51] not only does that but he goes around
[1:02:53] and he allows a man to be sent to his
[1:02:56] imminent death to try and cover it up
[1:02:59] what would we thought of about David
[1:03:00] then
[1:03:02] what would we have still felt like oh
[1:03:04] well Mike David is the man after God's
[1:03:06] Own Heart we would have struggled let's
[1:03:07] just be honest we're human beings every
[1:03:10] one of us we would have struggled with
[1:03:12] this how can that be the anointed of God
[1:03:14] how can that be a man after God's Own
[1:03:17] Heart but God was looking Beyond David's
[1:03:20] mistakes God was looking beyond the
[1:03:23] Flesh of David and I'm not here to
[1:03:26] glorify sin tonight I hope you don't get
[1:03:28] me wrong I'm not here to make Grace a
[1:03:30] disgrace I'm here to tell you you can't
[1:03:33] change God's mind about you
[1:03:37] oh
[1:03:39] God didn't let David get away with his
[1:03:41] sins and just say it's okay you're
[1:03:43] predestinated honey you just go on and
[1:03:46] do whatever you want the sword never
[1:03:48] left his home he paid for it the rest of
[1:03:51] his life but it did not change God's
[1:03:53] mind about David
[1:03:55] God had already made up his mind about
[1:03:58] David and he said I have chosen David
[1:04:01] yeah he had called him he had elected
[1:04:04] him and I want to say tonight you can
[1:04:06] mess up your life here on Earth you can
[1:04:08] ruin my people many times they get ahead
[1:04:11] of God and they get in a marriage
[1:04:12] situation and it becomes a terrible
[1:04:15] thing for him brother Bannon said and
[1:04:16] choosing him but right there in 1965 a
[1:04:19] man should pray earnestly for he could
[1:04:21] ruin his entire life he didn't just say
[1:04:23] that so that preachers could memorize a
[1:04:26] nice quote that he was serious about it
[1:04:28] you can ruin man or woman either one
[1:04:30] I've seen him ruin their entire life and
[1:04:33] live in misery because of a poor choice
[1:04:36] but that didn't change God's mind about
[1:04:38] them amen
[1:04:40] even around the message hey there has
[1:04:43] been people that have wondered for
[1:04:45] centuries about this topic of marriage
[1:04:47] and divorce and brother Branham would
[1:04:49] come and preach it and show us what the
[1:04:51] true revelation of it was and yet people
[1:04:53] still struggle with it why because we're
[1:04:55] human beings and it's still a problem
[1:04:58] and yet we find that there's people
[1:05:00] right in the message and marriage and
[1:05:01] divorce situations and some people get
[1:05:04] so legalistic they'll disfellowship them
[1:05:06] and they'll push them away from church
[1:05:08] hey when a man's down and he's made a
[1:05:10] mistake that's the man that needs to be
[1:05:11] in church I had a brother tell me
[1:05:14] recently he might be listening tonight
[1:05:16] bro I know he's making some Life Choices
[1:05:18] that is a pastor as a Christian I
[1:05:21] absolutely disagree with and he said
[1:05:23] brother Nathan I'm probably people are
[1:05:24] probably saying things about me and
[1:05:26] giving you such a hard way to go I said
[1:05:28] he said well I guess I should just maybe
[1:05:30] leave the church I said don't you do it
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:33] [Music]
[1:05:35] I say this tonight not to not to
[1:05:38] belittle him I love him with all my
[1:05:40] heart Martin and I would only say it
[1:05:42] because if he were here tonight and
[1:05:43] could share his testimony with you he
[1:05:45] would share it but my dad threw a
[1:05:47] portion of my childhood my dad had been
[1:05:49] going through some physical things and
[1:05:51] and the devil beating him up mentally
[1:05:53] and he was trying to work and having
[1:05:55] some physical battles and things and and
[1:05:57] he began to backslide and begin to
[1:05:59] depend on things besides God to try to
[1:06:02] get him through and he went through a
[1:06:03] lot of trouble and a lot of Trials but I
[1:06:05] thank God back home there brother
[1:06:07] Collins wasn't an idiot he knew there
[1:06:09] were some things going on but he didn't
[1:06:11] ever push my dad away he didn't ever
[1:06:13] call him out over the pulpit and run him
[1:06:15] down but he kept calling him brother and
[1:06:17] kept making him welcome and one day God
[1:06:20] got a hold of Dad and turned him around
[1:06:21] and he's never been the same since I
[1:06:24] thank God for people that are
[1:06:26] long-suffering when somebody's down they
[1:06:29] don't need you to push him down further
[1:06:31] they need you to help him and say hey I
[1:06:34] don't agree with your choice I don't
[1:06:36] agree with your sin but I want to let
[1:06:38] you know I haven't gave up on you stay
[1:06:40] there that I'm praying for you that I
[1:06:44] know that his grace is sufficient for
[1:06:46] wherever you're at in your life tonight
[1:06:49] we're going to look at some characters
[1:06:50] in The Bible if I can ever get to it
[1:06:52] brother Samuel we're going to look at
[1:06:54] some that if we had been there we might
[1:06:56] have had a problem can you imagine some
[1:06:58] of the message churches that have gotten
[1:07:00] so legalistic can you imagine the woman
[1:07:02] at the well coming and saying I'd like
[1:07:04] to attend your church and they said now
[1:07:06] wait a minute you've been married and
[1:07:08] divorced and married and divorced and
[1:07:10] married and divorced and married and
[1:07:11] divorced and married and divorced and
[1:07:13] the one you're living with now that you
[1:07:15] said isn't even your husband she said oh
[1:07:16] that's true and I've had a lot of
[1:07:18] mistakes in my life's been all scrupled
[1:07:20] up and I went through all these stages
[1:07:22] with these six different men but then I
[1:07:24] met the seventh man
[1:07:26] and it changed my life I'm not the way I
[1:07:30] used to be now we could point back at
[1:07:32] our past and constantly throw that in
[1:07:34] her faith or we can recognize that Jesus
[1:07:37] had needs to play that Samaria brother
[1:07:40] Baron would look at it and say there was
[1:07:42] a predestinated seed there well if we
[1:07:44] had been picking we probably wouldn't
[1:07:46] have picked her as a predestinated seed
[1:07:50] well Blue Devil
[1:07:52] well we wouldn't have picked her with
[1:07:55] that one caught in the very Act of
[1:07:57] adultery would we have welcomed her into
[1:07:59] our church the next service but she was
[1:08:01] it wasn't a rumor on Facebook it wasn't
[1:08:04] something somebody had criticized her
[1:08:06] about on Twitter they caught her in the
[1:08:08] very act and they bring her to Jesus my
[1:08:10] question has always been where is the
[1:08:12] man right hold on right if they caught
[1:08:14] her in the very act there hadn't been a
[1:08:16] man there too but maybe he was the high
[1:08:18] priest son or or maybe he was the mayor
[1:08:20] of the city's son or maybe he was one of
[1:08:22] the Deacon's sons and they kind of hid
[1:08:25] that under the rug but she didn't have
[1:08:27] quite the reputation that he did so they
[1:08:29] bring her up to Jesus and said she's
[1:08:31] been caught in the very act what is
[1:08:33] Moses's law say about it
[1:08:36] and they thought they were going to get
[1:08:38] Jesus in a trap but the law had been
[1:08:41] made flesh the word had been made flesh
[1:08:45] and was dwelling among them and they
[1:08:48] thought that the law would just send her
[1:08:49] away to judgment but when the law was
[1:08:51] made flesh when the word became flesh it
[1:08:54] wasn't didn't just come in a legalistic
[1:08:55] package that it was packaged in a Grace
[1:08:58] package
[1:09:00] amen and he said this is what the law
[1:09:02] said but I came to redeem you I came to
[1:09:05] save that which was lost and he came to
[1:09:08] do what the law couldn't do
[1:09:12] amen hallelujah and he just Stoops down
[1:09:14] and he doesn't even answer them can you
[1:09:16] imagine what some of us pastors would
[1:09:17] have went through if somebody would have
[1:09:19] emailed us a question or had come up at
[1:09:22] church and said look there's a situation
[1:09:23] we want an answer on it and we just
[1:09:25] ignored him and began to write in the
[1:09:26] sand
[1:09:27] yes
[1:09:29] so well he didn't even take time to
[1:09:31] answer my question
[1:09:33] but I wonder what Jesus began to write
[1:09:35] in the sand whatever it was who began to
[1:09:37] get their attention
[1:09:38] and they begin to look down and maybe he
[1:09:40] was writing Hypocrites a liar Thief
[1:09:44] different things in the city oh my well
[1:09:46] we better just walk away because he
[1:09:47] might call us out and from the oldest to
[1:09:49] the youngest they begin to walk off he
[1:09:51] said whoever is without sin Let Him cast
[1:09:54] the first stone
[1:09:56] and I want you to notice maybe you
[1:09:58] recognized it before but the only one
[1:10:00] that had the ability the only one that
[1:10:02] was was without sin and could have
[1:10:05] picked up a stone and stoned her he
[1:10:07] looks around he says wear thine accuser
[1:10:09] she said I have none
[1:10:12] what's up
[1:10:14] I have none he said neither do I accuse
[1:10:18] you now he didn't say now just go on and
[1:10:20] live any lifestyle you want and God just
[1:10:23] loves you and he said go and sin no more
[1:10:26] unless the worst thing come upon you
[1:10:28] amen he was not sugar coating sin he was
[1:10:31] letting us know when we make a mistake
[1:10:33] he's there to provide a way back
[1:10:37] when the prodigal son got as far out
[1:10:39] there as he did his father wasn't
[1:10:41] sitting there waiting to say I told you
[1:10:43] so
[1:10:45] but he was waiting there with open arms
[1:10:47] to welcome him back
[1:10:50] well that's a good lesson a lot of us
[1:10:51] message parents isn't it
[1:10:53] wasn't waiting at the door to say I told
[1:10:56] you so I told you this would happen he
[1:10:58] was waiting there with our Open Arms to
[1:11:00] welcome back you know if we ever really
[1:11:02] take a good enough look at our life and
[1:11:04] realize how much we needed a savior how
[1:11:06] much we needed the blood of Jesus how
[1:11:08] much we needed a redeemer maybe you
[1:11:10] didn't go out and sin as far as me or
[1:11:12] maybe you went way further than me but I
[1:11:14] don't care we had a sister that one time
[1:11:16] in a Bible study when I was growing up
[1:11:17] as a young man she had moved into the
[1:11:20] area and we began to talk about some
[1:11:21] things in the Bible study and she began
[1:11:23] to tell us how that she had been so
[1:11:25] convicted because once upon a time she
[1:11:27] looked over at somebody's School paper
[1:11:29] and wrote off of their paper and she had
[1:11:31] been so convicted by the I thought
[1:11:33] brother Paul if that was all that I had
[1:11:36] to be convicted about I'd be the
[1:11:37] happiest person God if that was what the
[1:11:42] devil beat me up about I looked over on
[1:11:43] somebody's paper Once Upon a Time in
[1:11:45] school I was a homeschooler I didn't
[1:11:47] have anybody's paper to look over at
[1:11:53] but I thought my if that would have been
[1:11:55] my testimony but you know what she
[1:11:57] needed just as much of the blood of
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ as I did
[1:12:01] amen amen his grace is sufficient
[1:12:04] and so no matter how far you've gone he
[1:12:07] Grace has provided a way back tonight
[1:12:11] you say oh brother Nathan I've send away
[1:12:13] my day of Grace go and search some
[1:12:15] quotes on what brother random says about
[1:12:16] that he said they're different people
[1:12:17] come up in the prayer line and he said
[1:12:19] oh you think you've sent away your day
[1:12:21] of Grace he said do you love Jesus Oh
[1:12:23] yes brother abandonment he said if you
[1:12:24] if you would send away your day of Grace
[1:12:26] she wouldn't want nothing to do with
[1:12:28] Jesus
[1:12:31] comes and lies us and tells us all but
[1:12:33] you did this and you did that you know
[1:12:36] all these mistakes and all your Humanity
[1:12:38] but look I didn't choose me he chose me
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:47] when God chose David there was people
[1:12:49] that could have criticized all they want
[1:12:51] all we had to do if we'd have been there
[1:12:52] would say look God did not choose this
[1:12:54] man Jesse did not choose this man Samuel
[1:12:57] did not choose this man Samuel in fact a
[1:12:59] Vindicated Prophet tried to choose his
[1:13:01] brother but God chose this man
[1:13:06] my people have a problem today you know
[1:13:08] with the Vindicated Prophet they find
[1:13:10] all kinds of criticisms and all kinds of
[1:13:12] fault and I say hey if you've got a
[1:13:14] problem with brother random being
[1:13:15] Malachi 4 then don't don't take it up
[1:13:17] with brother Brandon don't take it up
[1:13:19] with me take it up with the one that
[1:13:20] chose him amen
[1:13:24] if you got a problem with it talk to
[1:13:26] talk to the Lord when you get over there
[1:13:28] if you make it over there
[1:13:29] talk to him say why on Earth did you
[1:13:31] choose this man it was so hard for me
[1:13:33] well I thank God he chose a humble
[1:13:35] Kentucky
[1:13:36] amen somebody I could understand and it
[1:13:39] would make it simple for me that I could
[1:13:41] be able to receive it remember the the
[1:13:42] Bible said that Jesus when he came the
[1:13:46] Common People heard him gladly I hope
[1:13:48] we're just common folks tonight I I'm
[1:13:50] not some great something I just want to
[1:13:52] be God just help me to be simple God
[1:13:54] don't help me to make myself something
[1:13:56] that I'm not but Gideon when God would
[1:13:59] choose him in Judges chapter 6 verse 12
[1:14:01] it says the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:14:03] unto him and said unto him the Lord is
[1:14:05] with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:14:09] now this is what the angels of the Lord
[1:14:11] said about Gideon but Gideon looks at it
[1:14:14] and he says in verse 15 oh my Lord
[1:14:17] wherewith shall I save Israel behold my
[1:14:20] family is poor in Manasseh and I am the
[1:14:23] least in my father's house so the angel
[1:14:26] says he's a mighty man of Valor but he
[1:14:29] says my family is the least and I'm the
[1:14:31] least of the least
[1:14:33] amen now what we want to look at tonight
[1:14:35] with the help of the Lord is that
[1:14:37] there's a there's a fine line here and
[1:14:39] we want to be on the right side of that
[1:14:41] line we want to be right on the line we
[1:14:43] don't want to be way out here way over
[1:14:45] there because if you're not careful the
[1:14:47] devil will get you to be so
[1:14:49] self-deprecating that well I'm just
[1:14:51] nothing and I'm Just a Nobody and I I'm
[1:14:55] just a failure and I well to a certain
[1:14:57] extent amen that's true I am too but we
[1:15:01] fail to realize when we're looking at
[1:15:03] the picture uh you know I've told our
[1:15:05] church before there's a brother from our
[1:15:06] church brother Jonathan houch and and
[1:15:08] he's he's pretty good at corn toss when
[1:15:10] we go and and we begin to play my he'll
[1:15:12] just drill them right in that hole one
[1:15:14] two three boom and and so when we we
[1:15:16] have a little pitching fellowship or
[1:15:18] something like that I try to get on his
[1:15:20] team and we win a lot we're we're
[1:15:22] undefeated at some of these pigeons and
[1:15:24] things and and it's not because I'm good
[1:15:27] it's because of whose team I'm on Amen
[1:15:30] and anything that I've accomplished in
[1:15:32] life anything that God has blessed that
[1:15:34] I have done it was not because of me it
[1:15:37] was not because I was worthy it was not
[1:15:39] because of my intelligence it was not
[1:15:41] because of my knowledge or my ability to
[1:15:44] memorize or anything like that it was
[1:15:46] because of whose team I was on
[1:15:51] yes I'd have been scared to death
[1:15:53] whether Jonathan in that prayer line if
[1:15:55] it had just been me and brother Jonathan
[1:15:57] and brother Samuel praying for that
[1:15:59] sister
[1:16:00] no way you could have got me down there
[1:16:03] amen right
[1:16:05] hey if I remember Ryan brother Jonathan
[1:16:07] was on one arm and I was on the other
[1:16:09] arm and my wife was on a leg trying to
[1:16:11] hold her skirt down brother Samuel was
[1:16:13] on another leg and I had my free hand
[1:16:15] holding her forehead so she wouldn't
[1:16:16] bite us because she was trying to bite
[1:16:19] us you don't want to go up against
[1:16:20] something like that if it's just you
[1:16:23] but when it's you and Jesus that's a
[1:16:25] different story
[1:16:26] David would have been crazy to go up
[1:16:29] against Goliath if it was just him but
[1:16:32] see he had Jehovah on his side amen and
[1:16:35] it wasn't what David could do it was
[1:16:38] what Jehovah could do through David
[1:16:40] brother random would have been crazy to
[1:16:42] go and stand there before the religions
[1:16:44] of the world and say can any of you heal
[1:16:46] this blind man yeah he would have been
[1:16:49] crazy if that had just been the thoughts
[1:16:51] of a Kentucky hillbilly but it wasn't
[1:16:53] just a Kentuckian that went over to
[1:16:55] Africa and India in these different
[1:16:57] places but it was that God was on his
[1:17:00] side I want to remind you tonight yes
[1:17:02] and ourselves were inadequate we're
[1:17:04] insufficient we're unworthy but don't
[1:17:06] forget who's on your side
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:10] don't forget who's in the boat with you
[1:17:14] Exodus chapter 3 verse 11 and Moses said
[1:17:17] unto God who am I that I should go unto
[1:17:20] pharaoh
[1:17:21] and then I should bring forth the
[1:17:23] children of Israel out of Egypt and he
[1:17:24] said certainly I will be with thee
[1:17:28] amen what a difference
[1:17:30] see Moses could look back at all his
[1:17:32] failures we looked at it recently in our
[1:17:34] church and and how that Moses brother
[1:17:37] Madam said that Moses's mother had told
[1:17:39] him he was a deliverer and he had heard
[1:17:41] that his whole life but Moses wasn't
[1:17:43] sure
[1:17:44] and so when it came time to be put to
[1:17:47] the test he thought well I'll try this
[1:17:49] out and he did it on his own and he
[1:17:51] kills one Egyptian and he runs up on the
[1:17:53] backside of the desert a failure
[1:17:56] he runs out defeated he runs out labeled
[1:18:00] as a murderer right right how many is
[1:18:02] going to follow that guy
[1:18:06] oh bless God I'd have followed Moses up
[1:18:09] I was there okay so all you know about
[1:18:11] him is that he murdered an Egyptian and
[1:18:13] ran for 40 years on the backside of the
[1:18:15] desert and then he comes back and this
[1:18:16] murderer is going to be your deliverer
[1:18:20] your attitude today would be what your
[1:18:22] attitude was back then
[1:18:26] and he comes back God begins to deal
[1:18:29] with them on the backside of the desert
[1:18:30] there and it's not just the people that
[1:18:32] are having a hard time with this Moses
[1:18:34] is having a hard time he has all kinds
[1:18:36] of excuses for God Exodus chapter 4
[1:18:38] verse 10 and Moses said unto the Lord oh
[1:18:40] my Lord I'm not eloquent neither
[1:18:42] heretofore nor since thou has spoken
[1:18:44] unto thy servant but I'm of slow speech
[1:18:47] and of a slow tongue and the Lord said
[1:18:49] unto him who hath made man's mouth
[1:18:52] for whom maketh the dumb or death or the
[1:18:55] sing or the blind have not I the Lord
[1:18:58] now therefore go and I will be with thy
[1:19:01] mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say
[1:19:06] amen if I didn't feel like I had the
[1:19:07] same promise from God there's no way I'd
[1:19:09] get behind a Pulpit
[1:19:12] I'd be scared to death to stand before a
[1:19:15] congregation like this I wouldn't have
[1:19:16] anything to say I wouldn't know where to
[1:19:18] turn or what to do but I'm trusting him
[1:19:20] that when I come out here that he's
[1:19:22] going to be with my mouth that he's
[1:19:24] going to give me what to say that it's
[1:19:26] not going to be my thoughts or my
[1:19:28] opinion but he's going to Quicken it to
[1:19:29] me and God tells Moses look you've got
[1:19:32] all these excuses but I'm going with you
[1:19:35] and I'm going to be with you I'm the one
[1:19:37] that created man's mouth don't you think
[1:19:39] I can help you but oh my just like us he
[1:19:41] had all kinds of excuses and if we're
[1:19:43] not careful the devil will come in and
[1:19:46] he'll try to get us to compare one
[1:19:47] another
[1:19:48] with one another
[1:19:54] well brother so and so you know he's
[1:19:57] he's not the preacher that so-and-so is
[1:19:59] and brother so and so he's not the
[1:20:01] singer that brother so and so is and
[1:20:03] sister so and so she's not the musician
[1:20:06] that this one is and we begin to compare
[1:20:08] ourselves like the world right
[1:20:13] try to rank one another
[1:20:16] man I can't be any of these brothers and
[1:20:20] they can't be me
[1:20:22] brother random said I could not take
[1:20:23] Billy Graham's place he wasn't just
[1:20:25] being humble he he couldn't God didn't
[1:20:27] call him to that and he said and I doubt
[1:20:29] very much if he could take mine
[1:20:31] why because God makes us individuals
[1:20:34] and God calls us to a specific thing God
[1:20:37] God did not call me to take the place of
[1:20:40] brother Branham God called brother
[1:20:41] Branham to do his part and he did it
[1:20:43] well I'm not here to take his place I'm
[1:20:45] not here to correct anything that he
[1:20:46] didn't correct I'm just here to point
[1:20:48] you back and tell you what he said
[1:20:50] amen I'm not here to take Brother Paul's
[1:20:52] Place or brother Samuels or brother
[1:20:54] Jonathan's they're not here to take mine
[1:20:55] God called us each with a unique gift
[1:20:58] and a unique personality and a unique
[1:21:00] Ministry and if we're not careful we
[1:21:01] begin to compare well this brother's a
[1:21:03] little different than that brother and
[1:21:04] and I don't know if he's really called
[1:21:06] well why because his personality is
[1:21:08] different his his style is different his
[1:21:10] delivery the way he studies we've got
[1:21:12] you know nobody would ever thought it
[1:21:14] could have been possible in
[1:21:15] Jeffersonville Indiana but right now
[1:21:16] we've got 14 preachers at our church
[1:21:20] and there's not one of us that's the
[1:21:22] same there's not one of us that studies
[1:21:24] the same there's not one of us that
[1:21:26] preaches the same we got one brother at
[1:21:28] our church brother it's it look early
[1:21:29] he'll come out and his notes are about
[1:21:31] like this
[1:21:33] a sticky note and I have one little
[1:21:36] quote written out and one scripture
[1:21:38] reference and maybe a symbol or
[1:21:40] something that he knows what it means
[1:21:41] but and that's his notes and he'll
[1:21:43] preach just as long as I do and hey I've
[1:21:46] done that once or twice but that's not
[1:21:47] how I study and that's not how I preach
[1:21:50] and I can't be him and he can't be me
[1:21:58] we got brothers that are fireballs and
[1:22:00] we've got brothers that are teachers and
[1:22:02] they don't maybe raise their voices much
[1:22:04] they don't maybe get as loud but you
[1:22:06] know what they're preaching the same
[1:22:07] word
[1:22:09] they're preaching the same word maybe
[1:22:11] their delivery is different maybe their
[1:22:12] style is different but I look what is
[1:22:14] the motive behind it and what is being
[1:22:16] produced by it
[1:22:19] if we're just here to get our name on a
[1:22:21] billboard somewhere and say well there's
[1:22:23] Nathan Bryant's name and lights and oh
[1:22:25] he's over here at this revival and over
[1:22:27] at that Revival oh look how much
[1:22:29] offerings he brought in look how many
[1:22:31] people he backed the building with the
[1:22:32] motive and the objective is wrong but if
[1:22:35] it's about lost souls
[1:22:38] yeah
[1:22:39] I think many times about the lady there
[1:22:42] when brother Bantam talked about it she
[1:22:44] says she was a wash woman
[1:22:46] and a lot of times you know around the
[1:22:48] message we got a lot of mouth
[1:22:50] chauvinistic pigs I think is the word we
[1:22:52] call them
[1:22:54] that they don't think women have any
[1:22:55] place at all you know except maybe to
[1:22:57] sit over in a corner and wash the dishes
[1:22:59] and feed the babies
[1:23:01] you should go listen to Patmos Vision
[1:23:03] when brother Brandon begins to preach
[1:23:06] the church ages and before he starts on
[1:23:07] the Patmos Vision they ask him this
[1:23:09] question brother banham would it be okay
[1:23:11] for sisters to do this or do that he
[1:23:13] says that she can speak in tongues she
[1:23:15] can interpret she can prophesy she can
[1:23:18] sing she can do all these things she can
[1:23:20] testify only not to take a Pulpit and
[1:23:23] preach because she can't assert
[1:23:25] authority over somebody
[1:23:27] amen that's right I know we struggle
[1:23:30] with that because you know we've tried
[1:23:32] to make our own traditions instead of
[1:23:33] staying with what he actually said
[1:23:35] but God I preached a whole series back
[1:23:38] at home on on a woman's place and how
[1:23:41] that God uses women and and he's he's
[1:23:44] not going to use her outside of what his
[1:23:47] word says for her he's not going to use
[1:23:50] her to be the head of her home and to
[1:23:52] wear the pants in the family that's
[1:23:54] contrary to his work he's not going to
[1:23:56] use her to be a preacher that's contrary
[1:23:58] to his word unless she's preaching to
[1:24:00] her children and then brother Branham
[1:24:01] called her the Fifth Gospel
[1:24:04] didn't call his brothers The Fifth
[1:24:06] Gospel but called mother The Fifth
[1:24:08] Gospel
[1:24:11] God chose it that way
[1:24:14] God ordained it that way yes sir we get
[1:24:18] a jealous Spirit if we're not careful
[1:24:19] around the message and you know some
[1:24:21] ministers get to a spot where they feel
[1:24:23] like if they don't have such a
[1:24:24] supernatural super duper Dynamic
[1:24:27] Ministry that that they can try to
[1:24:29] replicate brother banham's Ministry that
[1:24:31] they've just lost out or if they can't
[1:24:33] come up with something new to hold the
[1:24:34] attention of the people that they might
[1:24:36] lose somebody to somebody else or things
[1:24:38] like that I I don't understand we have a
[1:24:41] perfect word
[1:24:43] we have an infallible Bible
[1:24:46] we have a Vindicated message that that
[1:24:48] restored us back to truth I'm happy
[1:24:51] about it I'm not jealous about brother
[1:24:53] Brandon's position I'm thankful for it
[1:24:55] I'm not jealous of these other pastors
[1:24:58] this is not a competition amen it's not
[1:25:01] a competition to see how many dollars we
[1:25:04] can get in the bank account or how many
[1:25:05] people we can pack in the view of
[1:25:07] somebody from my church goes to one of
[1:25:09] brother Jonathan's meetings and gets the
[1:25:11] Holy Ghost I don't say oh God why didn't
[1:25:13] you give him the holy ghost in my
[1:25:14] service well I I guess I got to tell
[1:25:16] people not to go visit other churches
[1:25:18] because people's going to think oh my
[1:25:20] well I got the Holy Ghost over here and
[1:25:21] I didn't get it back at home I'm
[1:25:23] rejoicing thank God they're not the holy
[1:25:26] ghosts
[1:25:29] they don't want a selfish emotive amen
[1:25:33] and many times the sisters begin to be a
[1:25:36] little jealous of that headship if you
[1:25:38] really have a true husband that is
[1:25:41] really walking in the admonition of God
[1:25:43] and is a real head you should not be
[1:25:45] jealous of that pressure that he's under
[1:25:47] you should be thankful that you have the
[1:25:49] right kind of head to fall under
[1:25:51] and as a pastors hey I saw a picture of
[1:25:54] brother Samuel in his office before I
[1:25:56] came out he you know he used to have
[1:25:58] hair
[1:26:02] you know when I started pastoring I
[1:26:05] didn't have one white hair in my head
[1:26:10] people think we worked three hours a
[1:26:12] week you know one hour Sunday morning
[1:26:13] one hour Sunday night and one hour on
[1:26:15] Wednesday night oh that's all it was I'd
[1:26:17] Rejoice I'd say thank you Lord but they
[1:26:20] don't see the toil they don't see the
[1:26:22] burden the pressure of praying over
[1:26:24] situations the decisions that we have to
[1:26:27] make for the body of Christ that we're
[1:26:29] ministering to there locally and
[1:26:31] studying and praying God what should I
[1:26:33] preach who should I have in God what
[1:26:36] should I do about this what should I do
[1:26:37] about that and then things like Cove had
[1:26:39] come up and and you're never going to
[1:26:40] make everybody happy because either you
[1:26:42] didn't open early enough or you open too
[1:26:44] soon or or you were too restrictive or
[1:26:46] you weren't restrictive enough why
[1:26:48] because we're all human beings and we
[1:26:50] all have opinions and people leave
[1:26:52] churches over things like that to me
[1:26:55] that's like leaving over the thermostat
[1:26:56] well the Deacon said at one degree
[1:26:58] cooler than I liked and bless God I'll
[1:27:01] stay home where I can control my own
[1:27:03] thermostat hey there has to be an
[1:27:04] absolute on the thermostat
[1:27:07] hola
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:13] if we let everybody be the absolute or
[1:27:16] the thermostat my the that little knob
[1:27:18] would be broke off before the first
[1:27:19] service sister so and so and say I'm
[1:27:22] having a hot flash crank her down
[1:27:24] and some little old sister over there
[1:27:26] said oh I'm about to freeze to death
[1:27:27] brother Nathan so we have to have an
[1:27:30] absolute on the thermostat
[1:27:32] and if it's too cold then hey remember
[1:27:34] that the next Service and bring a
[1:27:36] blanket or bring a sweater
[1:27:39] don't let those things keep you out of
[1:27:41] church well brother so-and-so went back
[1:27:43] to church too soon and I didn't think it
[1:27:46] was safe to go back so I'm going to
[1:27:47] leave church well didn't you think maybe
[1:27:48] you could stream a month or two until
[1:27:50] you felt it was safe and and then go
[1:27:52] back to church
[1:27:53] no we don't think logically because we
[1:27:56] get these worldly spirits on this and it
[1:27:58] has to be our way or the highway and we
[1:28:00] can't come under Godly headship whether
[1:28:02] it be in the home or in the church but
[1:28:04] listen if you've got the right kind of
[1:28:06] head these brothers are not flying by
[1:28:08] the seat of their pants they're praying
[1:28:10] and seeking God what should I do and we
[1:28:13] should respect those gifts
[1:28:15] amen we shouldn't put them up on a
[1:28:17] pedestal and make them our absolute well
[1:28:19] brother brother Samuel bought a silver
[1:28:20] car so now all the church is going to
[1:28:22] buy a silver car no brother Samuel's not
[1:28:24] my absolute but he's a god-called man
[1:28:26] that I should honor and respect to the
[1:28:28] highest that I can respect that office
[1:28:32] I don't have to be a mini me as brother
[1:28:35] Samuel and he doesn't have to be a mini
[1:28:36] me of me amen amen he doesn't well
[1:28:39] brother Nathan holds his tie like this
[1:28:40] when he preaches so I'll do that you
[1:28:42] know I've seen so many carnal
[1:28:44] impersonations around the message that a
[1:28:46] lot of times you can watch somebody
[1:28:47] preach and realize who they've been
[1:28:48] watching uh the way they walk or the way
[1:28:50] they handle themselves or things like
[1:28:52] that or the way they do their voice and
[1:28:53] their mannerisms and things like that I
[1:28:55] don't want to be a replica of somebody
[1:28:57] else I just want to be what Jesus made
[1:28:59] me amen
[1:29:01] amen that's right amen goodness gracious
[1:29:04] I guess it's going to be God's choice
[1:29:06] part two tomorrow because we're not
[1:29:07] we're not getting very far
[1:29:09] home
[1:29:13] and so brother Banner would say this
[1:29:15] little lost woman here she was just a
[1:29:18] wash woman she wasn't the pastor she
[1:29:21] wasn't some great Governor king or
[1:29:24] priest but she has a burden on her heart
[1:29:26] to see Revival in her City and she goes
[1:29:30] and she begins to save up money that
[1:29:32] she's washed on a not in a she didn't
[1:29:34] have a double deck or automatic washing
[1:29:37] machine but an old scrap board that
[1:29:39] she's washed on and toiled over and she
[1:29:41] saves her nickels and dimes and she
[1:29:43] rinsed not a Crystal Cathedral but she
[1:29:46] rents a livery stable and she gets an
[1:29:49] old broom and it must not have had
[1:29:51] janitors and deacons and trustees so she
[1:29:54] gets the room and she's not going to
[1:29:55] just wait on somebody else to do it she
[1:29:57] gets the brim and begins to sweep out
[1:29:59] the Livery stable and they didn't must
[1:30:01] not have had a missionary fund so they
[1:30:03] didn't have anybody to print the tracks
[1:30:04] but you know what she didn't wait on
[1:30:06] somebody else to do it she goes out and
[1:30:08] begins to print some tracks about the
[1:30:10] service and they must not have had a lot
[1:30:12] of witnesses there in the church so she
[1:30:14] wasn't going to wait on well I'll wait
[1:30:15] on the pastor I'll wait on this one but
[1:30:17] she goes out and she begins to pass them
[1:30:19] out herself and and she begins to handle
[1:30:21] the people on the street most people
[1:30:22] just threw him down and walked over him
[1:30:24] and one little boy that couldn't read
[1:30:25] said what does that say
[1:30:27] yeah and she told him
[1:30:29] and she had a circuit writer preacher
[1:30:31] come in and saved up enough money to
[1:30:34] give him an offering and he comes in he
[1:30:36] preaches and they didn't have a packed
[1:30:38] house
[1:30:39] it was her and the little boy that she
[1:30:42] had passed the track to and told him
[1:30:43] what it said and the circuit writer
[1:30:45] preached her I wonder how many message
[1:30:47] churches would have said well I guess
[1:30:49] this revival is a dud I guess this
[1:30:53] revival was just a failure
[1:30:55] well you know what we'll just have a
[1:30:57] prayer and read a Psalm and dismiss and
[1:30:58] go home but no the preacher preached
[1:31:00] just as hard as if there had been 5 000
[1:31:02] people there and even though there was
[1:31:04] only one little boy that Soul came to
[1:31:06] the Altar and he got saved and brother
[1:31:08] Adam said that was Dwight Moody and he
[1:31:10] led a million souls to God Amen
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:17] I wonder if that little lady ever
[1:31:19] recognized who that little boy was
[1:31:22] she may have never recognized the fruits
[1:31:25] of her labor until she
[1:31:28] until she's many things in this life
[1:31:29] that maybe we have labored and we have
[1:31:32] tried we've prayed for people and we've
[1:31:34] witnessed and we've handed people books
[1:31:36] and things like that and maybe we don't
[1:31:37] see a lot of results but I believe we'll
[1:31:39] get over there I read a quote to our
[1:31:40] church recently brother Benham said when
[1:31:42] we get over there there's going to be
[1:31:43] some people that you'll be surprised was
[1:31:45] there
[1:31:47] what a wonderful quote
[1:31:52] somebody said well brother so-and-so's
[1:31:54] there I don't even want to be there what
[1:31:56] a stupid statement to me
[1:32:02] whoever Jesus wants to let be there I'm
[1:32:04] okay with it just as long as he lets me
[1:32:06] be there
[1:32:07] if he'll just grant me eternal life I'll
[1:32:10] say thank you Lord
[1:32:12] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:32:14] we're going to look at several quotes
[1:32:15] from this sermon I was listening to it
[1:32:17] on the on the drive here and brother
[1:32:19] Benham says he's talking about Moses
[1:32:21] here he says all your weaknesses
[1:32:23] wouldn't match Moses
[1:32:25] Moses had a great big list of things to
[1:32:28] tell God I I got this weakness and that
[1:32:30] weakness and this excuse and that she's
[1:32:31] at all your weaknesses wouldn't match
[1:32:33] Moses says he says again but the very
[1:32:36] thing that we make excuses by our
[1:32:39] weaknesses God uses that very thing to
[1:32:43] tackle the job with
[1:32:46] the very things that we think well God I
[1:32:48] I'm not very talented or I don't have
[1:32:51] the ability I'm not the speaker that
[1:32:52] brother so-and-so is I'm not the
[1:32:54] preacher that brother son says I could
[1:32:56] never teach like brother so and so well
[1:32:57] God didn't call you to be brothers so
[1:32:59] and so God didn't call you to be sister
[1:33:01] so and so he called you to be you
[1:33:03] because he wants to reach somebody
[1:33:06] through you at your job right your
[1:33:08] family reunion or at your school that
[1:33:10] maybe us pastors would never even come
[1:33:12] in contact with but he's placed you for
[1:33:15] such a time as this he's called you and
[1:33:19] the devil will point you to every
[1:33:20] failure in your life every mistake every
[1:33:22] human weakness and he'll say see you can
[1:33:25] never do anything and you think that
[1:33:27] you're the first person that's ever
[1:33:28] thought anything like that you think
[1:33:30] you're the first person that Satan has
[1:33:32] ever bombarded you think that us pastors
[1:33:34] that Satan doesn't come and bombard us
[1:33:36] and try to give us uh oh what's the word
[1:33:39] I'm looking for uh with the uh
[1:33:42] there's a psychological word for it they
[1:33:45] uh
[1:33:48] I'll remember it in a moment an imposter
[1:33:51] syndrome
[1:33:54] hey a lot of us pastors fight with that
[1:33:57] an imposter syndrome that surely God how
[1:34:00] could you call me
[1:34:02] how could you use me
[1:34:04] because see we know who we are
[1:34:09] right
[1:34:10] if I could put up here every thought
[1:34:13] that I've had for the last 20 years
[1:34:16] and every time I've had to ask God to
[1:34:17] forgive me or my wife or my children or
[1:34:20] somebody from my church and I put all
[1:34:22] those things up here you'd probably walk
[1:34:24] out of here without a lot of confidence
[1:34:25] in me
[1:34:27] and you know what if we did the same
[1:34:28] thing to you I'd walk out without a lot
[1:34:30] of confidence in you
[1:34:32] because we're human beings
[1:34:35] we're human beings
[1:34:37] and sometimes even in our in our human
[1:34:40] weakness Even in our Humanity the things
[1:34:44] that that we know about ourselves oh god
[1:34:46] brother Brandon said it this way he said
[1:34:48] every one of us has a Punch coming to us
[1:34:50] right and maybe your punch is so
[1:34:53] different than mine that I'd look and
[1:34:54] say why on Earth does that bother you
[1:34:55] that don't even bother me at all
[1:34:58] and maybe you look at me and say well
[1:34:59] your punch is even more ridiculous than
[1:35:01] mine that's never been a problem for me
[1:35:03] but each one of us has a Punch coming
[1:35:05] and brother Adam said that's that place
[1:35:07] that you have to keep covered up
[1:35:10] amen now he didn't mean to hide it and
[1:35:12] keep it a secret sin he's saying cover
[1:35:14] it up in prayer stay prayed through know
[1:35:17] who you are and be honest with yourself
[1:35:19] and be honest with God and take that
[1:35:22] thing to God In Prayer not just once in
[1:35:23] an altar but Paul said I died daily amen
[1:35:27] if Paul had to Die daily way back there
[1:35:30] 2 000 years ago what must we do in 2023
[1:35:34] how often should we stay prayed up and
[1:35:36] say God the Lord you know what my desire
[1:35:39] My Heart Is but I'm human and I'm flesh
[1:35:42] and hey news alert this flesh never got
[1:35:45] the Holy Ghost
[1:35:48] this flesh still drags us down
[1:35:52] I've heard Brothers preach it almost
[1:35:54] well once you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:35:56] bless God you'll never do anything
[1:35:57] you'll never make a mistake I think my
[1:35:59] goodness they must have got a different
[1:36:00] Holy Ghost than me brother Paul
[1:36:03] must have got a different Holy Ghost
[1:36:04] than brother Branham
[1:36:08] brother Branham said hey
[1:36:10] he said I've had the Holy Ghost for
[1:36:11] years and he said I keep a cross in my
[1:36:14] car
[1:36:16] that cross wasn't there so people in the
[1:36:18] Walmart parking lot would know he was a
[1:36:20] Christian
[1:36:22] he said that cross was there because he
[1:36:25] was a red-blooded male and there was
[1:36:27] Flesh on display everywhere and instead
[1:36:29] of turning his head and watching that he
[1:36:31] would look to the cross
[1:36:33] that's right well if getting the holy
[1:36:35] ghost means that you're never tempted
[1:36:36] again or you don't ever have any more
[1:36:37] human weakness and that you're flashing
[1:36:39] got it and you never never can ever sin
[1:36:41] again then why on Earth would he hang
[1:36:43] that cross there
[1:36:46] right because he was a human being
[1:36:49] and he was honest about it
[1:36:51] he was honest with it hey if message
[1:36:54] preachers if we would all be as
[1:36:55] transparent as brother Brandon was about
[1:36:57] things I wonder how full our churches
[1:36:58] would be
[1:36:59] when he'd get up and talk about telling
[1:37:02] a little white lie to his lawyer there
[1:37:04] and said he was about to lose his mind
[1:37:06] and he said all mine said just tell him
[1:37:08] I'm not here and ran outside well we
[1:37:10] would have we would have just my let's
[1:37:13] be honest if it had been us now if it
[1:37:14] had been somebody else we said all the
[1:37:16] sister so-and-so I can't believe she'd
[1:37:17] do that but it put yourself in his shoes
[1:37:19] and we would have said well I wasn't
[1:37:21] there Brother Sam it wasn't a lie but
[1:37:25] the angel of the Lord said you lied
[1:37:28] so no matter how much we want to
[1:37:29] whitewash it the angel lord said you
[1:37:31] lied and now you're going to pray for
[1:37:32] this baby he said just wait here I got
[1:37:34] to go make something right and he went
[1:37:36] and he told the man and the man said
[1:37:38] brother Brandon I got more confidence in
[1:37:39] you now than I ever did
[1:37:42] and brother Brandon didn't have to get
[1:37:44] up and tell the Tabernacle that
[1:37:47] but I'm thankful that it is
[1:37:49] because I'm human too and there's times
[1:37:52] that the devil might I'm so glad that
[1:37:54] God didn't whitewash the Bible there's
[1:37:56] things in the Bible that might there's
[1:37:58] some there's some verses in the Bible we
[1:38:00] don't teach in Sunday school all right
[1:38:05] but they're there
[1:38:08] and they're there for people like you
[1:38:09] and me that I'm glad God didn't
[1:38:12] whitewash David since I'm glad we don't
[1:38:14] only have Hebrews chapter 11. right
[1:38:17] to read about the heroes of the Bible or
[1:38:19] we think dear Lord how can I ever match
[1:38:23] up to that right
[1:38:24] I heard brother Branham this on the on
[1:38:26] the tape the other day he said now he
[1:38:28] said when when Paul goes to write
[1:38:30] Hebrews chapter 11 about the heroes of
[1:38:32] the faith and he talks about Abraham he
[1:38:34] said he says that he staggered not the
[1:38:36] promise of God through I believe he says
[1:38:38] makes it sound like he never had ups and
[1:38:40] downs and things but he said we all know
[1:38:41] that he was a man and he made mistakes
[1:38:43] and he had bad days and good days hey
[1:38:46] Abraham I told her brother a while back
[1:38:48] he was having some questions about the
[1:38:51] message and and he he said Abraham
[1:38:53] didn't lie and I thought well I wonder
[1:38:56] if he asked abimelech if he would have
[1:38:57] thought if Abraham lied or not
[1:39:00] I wonder if you asked Pharaoh if he
[1:39:02] would have thought Abraham lied or not
[1:39:11] right yeah this thing's not going to
[1:39:13] leave your house
[1:39:16] that's hard for us to wrap our mind
[1:39:17] around but why because it was God's
[1:39:19] choice amen
[1:39:22] amen the very thing that we make excuses
[1:39:24] by our weakness God uses that very thing
[1:39:27] to tackle the job with see he waits for
[1:39:31] us to get to that condition so that he
[1:39:33] can use us
[1:39:36] well I wasn't going here in my mind but
[1:39:39] I'm glad that God God takes control
[1:39:41] instead of me but
[1:39:42] you know there's been things in my life
[1:39:46] not just pre-holy ghost
[1:39:48] not just pre-pastor life
[1:39:51] but there have been mistakes in my life
[1:39:55] that were absolutely mistakes
[1:39:58] absolutely things that I had to go back
[1:40:00] around tell somebody I'm sorry I
[1:40:02] shouldn't have done this you pray for me
[1:40:04] you forgive me
[1:40:05] things that were mistakes and I have
[1:40:09] seen God take those and even use those
[1:40:12] for his glory
[1:40:13] email now we can't explain that and I
[1:40:16] don't say that to make Grace a disgrace
[1:40:18] I don't say that to say go out and sin
[1:40:19] but brother bam said God has a way of
[1:40:21] even taking his permissive will and
[1:40:23] turning it around to his perfect will
[1:40:26] amen and sometimes there are things that
[1:40:27] we go through there there are people
[1:40:28] that go through sickness and you know
[1:40:31] it's easy for us as minister of others
[1:40:33] let's be honest it's easy for me to
[1:40:35] stand here I I've prayed for sisters and
[1:40:37] brothers that if God didn't move on the
[1:40:40] scene they weren't going to be with us
[1:40:41] very very long and seeing God come on
[1:40:43] the scene and heal cancer see God take
[1:40:45] away tumors see God heal people that had
[1:40:49] crooked spines and then go back and have
[1:40:51] an x-ray and their spine be straight and
[1:40:52] it's not hard for me to have faith for
[1:40:54] that I've seen God move I've seen the
[1:40:56] power of his resurrection I've seen the
[1:40:59] products of what this message has
[1:41:01] restored us back to I'm not ashamed of
[1:41:03] that and I'm thankful for that but when
[1:41:05] I'm sick
[1:41:07] right
[1:41:08] sometimes that's harder for me to have
[1:41:10] faith for myself
[1:41:14] don't just put that on yourself or me
[1:41:15] brother Ben said hey they give's not for
[1:41:17] me when brother Billy Paul was there at
[1:41:19] the accident and brother Branham laying
[1:41:21] out through the windshield on the hood
[1:41:24] near death and he said Daddy all you
[1:41:27] have to do is pray and God would touch
[1:41:30] it he said he just turned his head from
[1:41:31] me
[1:41:33] because the gift wasn't for him right
[1:41:36] and yet that same man he said what's
[1:41:39] wrong
[1:41:40] he said sister random wasn't breathing
[1:41:42] he said take my hand and put her over on
[1:41:44] her here he is halfway through the
[1:41:46] windshield and he takes that hand and
[1:41:48] lays it over on a woman that's not
[1:41:49] breathing and she begins to breathe
[1:41:52] that shouldn't stumble his friends
[1:41:54] there was a man a lot worse off than
[1:41:56] brother Branham that he was already his
[1:41:58] bones his skin had begun to Decay off of
[1:42:00] his body and they were in the middle of
[1:42:02] a battle and they said hey uh we just we
[1:42:05] ain't got time to bury this guy that got
[1:42:06] killed in battle and they threw him in
[1:42:08] there on Elijah's bones and he jumped
[1:42:10] back out
[1:42:12] sir
[1:42:15] no I don't worship the bones of brother
[1:42:18] random don't get scared but I believe
[1:42:20] that that Jesus is still a Healer
[1:42:24] when my um family my grandmother had
[1:42:27] been in in some of other Brandon's
[1:42:29] meetings and had seen some of the
[1:42:31] Miracles and things my Dad's cousin was
[1:42:33] healed of a great big growth on her neck
[1:42:37] and it's on tape there at the acting
[1:42:39] meetings at the Acton campground in
[1:42:40] Kentucky there and and she was standing
[1:42:42] back by a pole and brother said lady
[1:42:44] there with the pole by the pole with
[1:42:45] that growth on your neck you're healed
[1:42:47] and it was it was instantly healed and
[1:42:48] my dad had an ant that was healed of TB
[1:42:50] in brother abandon's meetings and and
[1:42:52] they had been in some of brother man's
[1:42:54] meetings and they would look to him like
[1:42:55] we would look at Jack Cole or Oral
[1:42:57] Roberts or somebody like that in the
[1:42:58] healing Revival they didn't know
[1:43:00] anything about a message or God sent in
[1:43:02] a man to call out a bride or anything
[1:43:03] like that and years later
[1:43:05] they would begin to recognize it and as
[1:43:08] as my dad and my uncles begin to read
[1:43:10] the books and listen to the tapes and
[1:43:12] begin to receive the message they had
[1:43:14] been in some of the Pentecostal uh
[1:43:16] fellowships and and followed some of the
[1:43:18] Pentecostal preachers that were very
[1:43:19] Dynamic and and they they went to a
[1:43:21] man's church for a while and every time
[1:43:23] they'd go he'd preach on these people
[1:43:26] living on Dead Man's Bones
[1:43:28] and he made the mistake of inviting my
[1:43:30] uncle to preach one last time for him
[1:43:32] and he preached on Elisha there when
[1:43:34] that man got thrown in he said I guess
[1:43:36] for the rest of his life they said well
[1:43:37] there goes that man that's living on
[1:43:38] dead men's bones
[1:43:44] our human weakness
[1:43:46] our human inability
[1:43:51] we would look at a man like Jonah
[1:43:54] who God called him to do something
[1:43:57] and Jonah it looks like did the exact
[1:44:00] opposite of what God called him to do
[1:44:02] Jonah instead of going and he just keeps
[1:44:04] going down he goes down uh to Joppa and
[1:44:07] then he goes down into the ship and then
[1:44:09] he goes down into the fish's mouth and
[1:44:12] then the fish takes him down to the
[1:44:14] bottom of the sea he just he's like a
[1:44:15] lot of us his trajectory is just
[1:44:17] downward downward downward downward and
[1:44:19] yet in all of that and here he is
[1:44:21] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:44:22] and yet brother random takes up for him
[1:44:24] and says a lot of people say Jonah was a
[1:44:26] backslid or it says say that Jonah was
[1:44:28] backslid rather but he said I'm going to
[1:44:30] take up for Jonah I don't believe he was
[1:44:32] backslid
[1:44:33] right well that depends on how you look
[1:44:35] at it
[1:44:37] one way it sort of looked like he was in
[1:44:39] another way he was God's choice to
[1:44:41] Nineveh
[1:44:42] and God had a GPS before there was ever
[1:44:46] sister Siri or sister Google God had a
[1:44:50] GPS that was so designed that when they
[1:44:53] threw this Prophet overboard right there
[1:44:56] at the right place at the right time
[1:44:57] there was a special design fish that
[1:45:00] swallowed Jonah
[1:45:03] and it looked like he'd been making just
[1:45:04] bad choice after a bad choice and being
[1:45:07] selfish and God said I've got you right
[1:45:09] where I want you Jonah
[1:45:11] amen maybe we got some Jonas here
[1:45:14] tonight or maybe listening in online hey
[1:45:16] you might think you're running from God
[1:45:17] you can't run
[1:45:19] he's got you right where he wants you
[1:45:23] maybe he knows what it takes to get you
[1:45:25] into conditions where you're humble
[1:45:27] enough for him to actually get through
[1:45:29] to you maybe he'll have to find you on a
[1:45:31] bar stool or maybe he'll have to find
[1:45:33] you in the gutter somewhere maybe he'll
[1:45:35] have to find you in a hospital bed near
[1:45:38] death but he knows exactly where he's
[1:45:40] going to find you and he knows what your
[1:45:42] condition is going to be and he's
[1:45:43] already just like he was Adam when Adam
[1:45:45] and Eve fell in the garden God didn't
[1:45:47] run through the garden ring in his hands
[1:45:49] saying oh let's have a conference and
[1:45:50] get the angels together and come up with
[1:45:52] a plan of redemption there was already A
[1:45:54] Plan of Redemption in place before the
[1:45:57] foundation of the world
[1:45:59] before Adam had been created there was
[1:46:01] already A Plan of Redemption knowing
[1:46:03] that Adam would fall and then we get
[1:46:05] worried and say well I don't know
[1:46:06] brother Samuel I feel like God just
[1:46:08] doesn't care sometimes God cared about
[1:46:11] you and your circumstance before you
[1:46:13] were ever a thought into your
[1:46:14] great-great-grandfather's mind
[1:46:17] God knew about you he knew where you'd
[1:46:19] be sitting tonight yes he knew your
[1:46:21] circumstance amen
[1:46:24] he knew your weaknesses he knew your
[1:46:26] inability he knew your humanity and he
[1:46:28] chose you anyhow through all of that
[1:46:32] I don't serve the kind of God that would
[1:46:34] say David's a man after my own heart and
[1:46:36] then David would make a bunch of
[1:46:37] mistakes and he'd say Angels bring the
[1:46:39] erasers I got to change that
[1:46:42] amen he knew what David's choices would
[1:46:45] be when he said that and David's choices
[1:46:47] didn't change God's mind about David and
[1:46:50] I want to say tonight there is nothing
[1:46:51] you can do to change God's mind about
[1:46:53] you
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:46:56] you can change your circumstances down
[1:46:59] here on Earth and make a mess of things
[1:47:01] but you cannot change God's mind about
[1:47:03] you
[1:47:04] I asked some brothers a while back
[1:47:06] I said if he came at my worst
[1:47:10] wouldn't worry sometimes oh Lord what
[1:47:12] the Rapture might come in the morning I
[1:47:14] I will hey that's good we should be
[1:47:16] under conviction we should stay prayed
[1:47:18] up that's wonderful but if he came at my
[1:47:20] worst
[1:47:22] would it change my election
[1:47:27] what about a man named Mr Ramsey that
[1:47:30] brother random talks about that was a
[1:47:31] backslidden preacher yes and he said I
[1:47:34] don't I don't serve him no more
[1:47:36] and he went out and got some alcohol had
[1:47:38] a had African-American boy go across the
[1:47:41] river and buy him alcohol because they
[1:47:43] wouldn't sell alcohol on Sundays in
[1:47:44] Indiana bring it back over the river to
[1:47:46] him and brother random said and God took
[1:47:50] him home
[1:47:53] makes it easy for us to preach some
[1:47:55] funerals doesn't it
[1:47:57] because we don't know what their outcome
[1:47:58] is that's right but we know that he's a
[1:48:01] gracious God who's gracious efficient
[1:48:04] I'm so thankful I've seen some people
[1:48:06] that don't have the hope that we do that
[1:48:09] at funerals and things mine it's hard
[1:48:11] for us to lose 11 but when you've got
[1:48:12] the hope of the Resurrection it's a
[1:48:13] different story then when you have no
[1:48:15] hope that if you don't believe there's a
[1:48:17] God or or an eternity or or a theophany
[1:48:20] or anything like that it's a it's a
[1:48:22] different loss than it is for a Believer
[1:48:23] who says I'll see him again someday
[1:48:26] and he says God took brother Ramsey home
[1:48:29] because he wouldn't let him bring
[1:48:31] reproach to his name
[1:48:33] didn't change God's mind about Mr Ramsey
[1:48:36] but changed his departure date
[1:48:39] took him to a premature grave
[1:48:46] when God makes a choice God doesn't have
[1:48:48] to come around and say oh I made a
[1:48:50] mistake my
[1:48:53] man you see some people
[1:48:55] they run from God and run from God and
[1:48:57] then maybe God get a hold of him and
[1:48:59] maybe then come back to church and get
[1:49:00] baptized and then all of a sudden a car
[1:49:02] wrecker something take them just snuff
[1:49:04] them out and you think oh God here they
[1:49:06] were finally serving you God knows what
[1:49:09] he's doing that's right amen he knows
[1:49:11] when to take people that's right he
[1:49:13] knows what he's doing God's ways are
[1:49:15] higher than our ways his thoughts are
[1:49:17] greater than our thoughts
[1:49:18] and we look sometimes just at the
[1:49:21] temporary effect and and we think oh God
[1:49:24] how could you allow this and how could
[1:49:25] you allow that and we we look at the
[1:49:27] moment whether it be a tragedy or or a
[1:49:30] sin in our life we allow the devil
[1:49:32] sometimes to get out of magnifying glass
[1:49:34] and he goes back to the worst moment in
[1:49:36] our life
[1:49:37] our worst mistake
[1:49:40] look what she did right there you
[1:49:42] remember that moment in time you think
[1:49:45] he didn't do that to Saint Paul
[1:49:46] when he stood there he said hey you want
[1:49:49] to get a bigger Rock and hit that man in
[1:49:50] the head let me hold your coat for you
[1:49:53] here you want to get one yeah yeah you
[1:49:55] want to get a uh a rock and hit that man
[1:49:57] let me hold you you want to get one let
[1:49:58] me hold your coat
[1:50:00] and he went around and held their coats
[1:50:03] so that they could hit a man in the head
[1:50:04] with rocks that was trying to tell him
[1:50:06] about a savior
[1:50:09] you think he didn't wake up in a cold
[1:50:10] sweat sometimes at night and think oh
[1:50:12] Lord how could I do it
[1:50:14] didn't change God's mind about Paul
[1:50:18] but the devil loves to point us back to
[1:50:20] those times remember when you did this
[1:50:23] and remember when you did that
[1:50:24] and so he keeps taking us back to those
[1:50:26] things sometimes and then we go and say
[1:50:28] God oh God please forgive me that and
[1:50:31] God says what are you talking about yeah
[1:50:34] yeah I don't have any idea what you're
[1:50:35] talking about
[1:50:36] but the devil keeps bringing it up oh
[1:50:38] he's sure he's the accuser of the
[1:50:40] brother but if you sincerely ask God to
[1:50:43] forgive you and made that right brother
[1:50:45] Adam said he's cast that in the sea of
[1:50:47] forgetfulness and he said it's like that
[1:50:49] that ink that you drop into a tub full
[1:50:51] of Clorox bleach and all of a sudden it
[1:50:53] disappears go and find that drop of ink
[1:50:55] somewhere he said Justified means as
[1:50:58] though you never did it in the first
[1:51:00] place
[1:51:02] oh and the devil loves to point us back
[1:51:04] to those things but you know I know some
[1:51:07] of us here are older old enough to
[1:51:08] remember cassette tapes I know a lot of
[1:51:10] us aren't but uh but there was a man
[1:51:13] from Jeffersonville by the name of Tom
[1:51:14] Cannell and he had a good speaking voice
[1:51:16] and and when they begin to take the
[1:51:18] tapes from the reel to reels and put
[1:51:19] them on cassettes some of the cassettes
[1:51:21] you know they maybe only have a portion
[1:51:22] of the service and and so when you turn
[1:51:24] on that cassette tape this voice would
[1:51:26] come on he'd say the tape that you're
[1:51:28] about to hear is incomplete
[1:51:30] every attempt has been made to find the
[1:51:32] missing portion of this tape and any
[1:51:34] effort you could give to you know to
[1:51:36] help us find that would be appreciated
[1:51:37] well I don't know exactly how it'll be
[1:51:40] but brother Brandon said when we get
[1:51:41] over there the angels will put up our
[1:51:42] life story
[1:51:44] on the screen
[1:51:46] that was pre-powerpoint but
[1:51:48] he said they're going to put it up on
[1:51:50] the screen
[1:51:51] and I don't know exactly what it'll be
[1:51:53] if it'll be an angel or who but when
[1:51:54] they put up my film on the screen
[1:51:55] brother Jonathan there's gonna have to
[1:51:57] be somebody that's going to come up and
[1:51:58] say now we just want to clarify the tape
[1:52:01] that you're about to see is incomplete
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:11] we searched through all of heaven we
[1:52:13] search through Earth we searched
[1:52:15] underneath the Earth in fact we went
[1:52:17] down to Hell and searched through there
[1:52:18] but we haven't been able to find this
[1:52:20] missing portion I'm so glad that's how
[1:52:22] my tape will play
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:29] not because of what I did but because of
[1:52:31] what Jesus Christ did for me
[1:52:39] I can't get much further but let me
[1:52:42] let me give you a sample of apparently
[1:52:43] what will be tomorrow morning's service
[1:52:46] this is actually the the hand of the
[1:52:48] Lord because in my mind you know you
[1:52:50] should pay attention to Flyers when a
[1:52:51] pastor sends a mouse
[1:52:54] I I thought I was preaching Saturday
[1:52:56] night and Sunday morning but apparently
[1:52:57] I'm preaching Sunday Saturday morning
[1:52:59] and Sunday morning and I'd only studied
[1:53:01] enough for Friday night so now we have
[1:53:04] enough material for Saturday morning I
[1:53:05] don't have to go study till four in the
[1:53:07] morning so thank you Jesus
[1:53:11] but let me give you just a little
[1:53:12] preview of what maybe we'll look at
[1:53:13] tomorrow with the help of the Lord Acts
[1:53:15] chapter 1 and verse 21
[1:53:17] there had been a man named Judas who
[1:53:20] Jesus
[1:53:21] had chosen
[1:53:23] knowing what the man's outcome would be
[1:53:28] Jesus was not shocked when Judas
[1:53:30] betrayed him
[1:53:31] he knew all along who Judas would be you
[1:53:33] talk about the character of Christ to be
[1:53:36] able to treat Judas in such a way that
[1:53:39] when it comes down to communion and foot
[1:53:41] washing at the Last Supper there and he
[1:53:44] says one of you will betray me they
[1:53:46] didn't all look down and say uh-huh
[1:53:48] I know who it is
[1:53:51] he didn't take Judas on the last three
[1:53:53] fishing trips
[1:53:54] he's been treating him a little
[1:53:55] different at the restaurants and all
[1:53:57] right I know when Judas has come to me
[1:53:59] with the question he's just totally
[1:54:00] ignored him and
[1:54:02] he treated Judas so much like the rest
[1:54:05] of them that instead of pointing at
[1:54:06] Judas they said is it I Lord
[1:54:08] is it me right and he knew what this
[1:54:11] man's in would be
[1:54:13] people try to look at men like oh if he
[1:54:16] was the Messiah he would have gave us a
[1:54:18] heads up about Judas
[1:54:20] right he couldn't
[1:54:22] it was part of the plan of God that
[1:54:25] Judas had to play his part right yes so
[1:54:28] that you and I could be saved and I'm
[1:54:30] thankful he didn't call me to play
[1:54:32] judas's part but somebody had to play
[1:54:35] that part just as certain as they
[1:54:38] pierced my hands and my feet when David
[1:54:40] would get under the anointing and say
[1:54:41] that just as certain as that had to be
[1:54:43] fulfilled so did the scripture that said
[1:54:45] my own familiar friend has betrayed me
[1:54:48] that scripture somebody had to fulfill
[1:54:50] it hey there's scriptures in the end
[1:54:51] time that people are going to have to
[1:54:53] fulfill right there's some of them that
[1:54:55] I don't want to there's scriptures about
[1:54:56] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[1:54:58] teeth and and being cast into the uh the
[1:55:01] the the the Lake of Fire I don't want to
[1:55:03] fulfill those scriptures but somebody's
[1:55:05] going to fulfill that but let's not stop
[1:55:07] there there's also somebody that's going
[1:55:08] to fulfill a bride has made herself
[1:55:11] ready
[1:55:11] [Applause]
[1:55:14] somebody is going to fulfill that yes
[1:55:18] and so Judas had to fulfill these
[1:55:20] scriptures
[1:55:21] and so now
[1:55:23] the disciples in Acts chapter 1 they're
[1:55:25] in the upper room pre-holy ghost
[1:55:29] you can make a lot of mistakes pre-holy
[1:55:31] ghost that if you'd have just waited on
[1:55:32] the Holy Ghost you wouldn't have made
[1:55:34] those decisions you'd have prayed more
[1:55:36] and been led by the Holy Ghost and and
[1:55:38] so they're up there in the upper room
[1:55:39] and they look around there's only 11 of
[1:55:42] us now
[1:55:43] and the scripture said that another man
[1:55:45] would take his bishoprics so we're going
[1:55:48] to have a little election here and
[1:55:50] we're going to bring some politics into
[1:55:52] the church and
[1:55:53] listen how they do it if this isn't
[1:55:55] political Acts chapter 1 verse 21
[1:55:57] wherefore of these men which have
[1:56:00] companyed with us all the time that the
[1:56:03] Lord Jesus went in and out among us
[1:56:04] another as one of the good old boys
[1:56:06] that's been with us the whole time
[1:56:09] beginning from the baptism of John you
[1:56:12] know he's got to go way back in message
[1:56:14] history
[1:56:16] these are their stipulations for picking
[1:56:18] the replacement for Judas beginning from
[1:56:20] the baptism of John under that same day
[1:56:23] that he was taken up from us must one be
[1:56:26] ordained to be a witness with this with
[1:56:28] us of his resurrection this was their
[1:56:31] choice
[1:56:33] this was their stipulation for making
[1:56:36] the choice and they narrowed it down to
[1:56:37] two men that fit these qualifications
[1:56:40] that men that didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:56:42] decided that needed to be made and so
[1:56:44] they they have an election they cast
[1:56:46] slots in verse 26 says and they gave
[1:56:49] forth their lots and the lot fell upon
[1:56:51] Matthias and he was numbered with the 11
[1:56:53] Apostles and brother Randleman saying
[1:56:55] and he never did anything that's
[1:56:56] recorded in the scriptures
[1:56:59] that was man's choice
[1:57:02] let's look at God's choice
[1:57:04] Acts chapter 3 8 verse 3 ask for Saul he
[1:57:09] made Havoc of the church
[1:57:11] entering into every house
[1:57:14] and hailing men and women
[1:57:16] committed them to prison
[1:57:19] that's God's choice
[1:57:24] God says that's the one I choose
[1:57:27] but but Lord he don't go back to the
[1:57:29] baptism of John
[1:57:31] and Lord he wasn't with him with us all
[1:57:33] the time and he didn't hear
[1:57:35] anything and and he doesn't fit our
[1:57:37] stipulations I don't remember asking you
[1:57:41] if it was okay if he was my choice
[1:57:46] let's be honest with ourselves if it had
[1:57:48] been us choosing we would have never
[1:57:50] picked this man we wouldn't even
[1:57:52] probably picked him to witness to we
[1:57:54] wouldn't have picked him to hand a
[1:57:56] message book to
[1:57:57] we would have been afraid he was going
[1:57:59] to put us in jail
[1:58:01] don't witness to that guy he put my
[1:58:03] grandma in jail over here
[1:58:05] in fact when he began to minister and
[1:58:07] had an experience all of the disciples
[1:58:09] were afraid to go around him because of
[1:58:12] the things that he had done and the
[1:58:13] persecution of the church and finally
[1:58:14] Barnabas goes down the sense in a
[1:58:16] meeting he says hey this guy's the real
[1:58:19] deal then somebody's got to hold it Paul
[1:58:21] something has changed him from what he
[1:58:23] used to be
[1:58:24] know but would we have had Grace for a
[1:58:27] man like Paul
[1:58:29] persecuting the church unto death
[1:58:32] consenting unto the death of Stephen
[1:58:36] standing there on his coach going down
[1:58:37] with letters from the Sanhedrin to put
[1:58:41] people that call on the name of Jesus in
[1:58:44] prison but a light struck him down amen
[1:58:47] and something got a hold of this man's
[1:58:49] life and he realized the very one that
[1:58:52] that I'm persecuting is the one that did
[1:58:56] something so Supernatural that it
[1:58:58] actually blinded his eyes and the rest
[1:59:00] of the men with him couldn't even see
[1:59:01] the light
[1:59:05] my
[1:59:07] something so Supernatural that changed
[1:59:10] him for the rest of his life and he goes
[1:59:12] on the back side of the desert there and
[1:59:14] begins to study the word because his
[1:59:16] whole life he's been a Pharisee of the
[1:59:18] Pharisees a Hebrew of the Hebrews and
[1:59:20] he's had this religious spirit and he
[1:59:22] was so sure he was right and he was
[1:59:24] using the very quotes of Moses to
[1:59:27] support his Doctrine
[1:59:29] and then when God deals with his heart
[1:59:31] he realizes I've been persecuting the
[1:59:33] very thing that the word spoke of
[1:59:36] and we give up on people around the
[1:59:38] message well they believe it a little
[1:59:39] different than me brother Samuel their
[1:59:41] preference is a little different than
[1:59:43] mine on how to have a worship service
[1:59:45] you know some of their some of their
[1:59:46] musical preferences and some of their
[1:59:48] song Choices and some of the ministers
[1:59:50] they have in to preach for them and
[1:59:52] their style of preaching and and it's a
[1:59:54] little different than mine I don't know
[1:59:55] about that guy he you know he leans a
[1:59:57] little bit this way on this Doctrine or
[1:59:59] he fellowships with brother so and so
[2:00:00] over here and and you know birds of a
[2:00:02] feather and all that uh brother sent me
[2:00:04] a quote today from the fifth seal you
[2:00:06] know brother bam does make that
[2:00:07] statement he said his mother used to
[2:00:08] tell him birds of a feather flock
[2:00:10] together but he said a born a born-again
[2:00:13] son or daughter of God won't use that to
[2:00:15] disfellowship somebody
[2:00:23] brother Ram said he had a man on the
[2:00:24] platform that was baptized wrong
[2:00:27] imagine if we had a preacher in the
[2:00:29] building tonight and brother Sammy said
[2:00:30] I'm gonna put him up here on the
[2:00:31] platform he preaches titles but we
[2:00:34] believe he's a good brother
[2:00:36] all right might they'd probably be an
[2:00:37] election on Wednesday
[2:00:40] brother Samuel had this brother he was
[2:00:42] not even baptizing right on the platform
[2:00:43] and we're gonna vote him out
[2:00:45] brother Graham said that denomination
[2:00:48] that was supporting him came and said
[2:00:49] brother Brandon you got a man on the
[2:00:50] pulpit that was baptized wrong we're
[2:00:52] going to draw a circle and draw you out
[2:00:55] and he didn't rain fire and brimstone
[2:00:57] down out of heaven and call God he pulls
[2:00:59] on their head say don't you realize
[2:01:00] you're just an old serpent seed don't
[2:01:01] you know who I am don't you know what
[2:01:03] God's called me to do he said that's
[2:01:04] okay I'll just draw a bigger Circle
[2:01:06] draw you right back in all right all
[2:01:08] right we've lost that attitude somewhere
[2:01:11] around the message
[2:01:13] Jesus said when when John stood there
[2:01:16] the disciple of Love post holy ghost
[2:01:18] pre-holy ghost didn't wasn't a very
[2:01:20] loving guy trying to call fire down out
[2:01:23] of heaven and consume people and oh yeah
[2:01:26] and John comes to Jesus he said hey we
[2:01:28] saw a guy casting out devils in your
[2:01:30] name but he don't belong to our group so
[2:01:32] we we told him we forbid him brother
[2:01:35] random said what it was is that Jesus
[2:01:37] had called them to do the job and this
[2:01:40] man was actually getting it done yeah
[2:01:42] and they were jealous
[2:01:46] Spirits don't die
[2:01:50] said you're not of us so we condemned
[2:01:52] him Jesus said hey whoa if he's not
[2:01:55] against us he's for us
[2:01:58] somehow around the message we've flipped
[2:02:00] that verse and we say if he's not for us
[2:02:01] he's against us
[2:02:03] but that's the opposite of what Jesus
[2:02:05] said that's right if you don't see it
[2:02:07] just like me if you don't do it just
[2:02:08] like me
[2:02:14] I'll I'll just be honest if God had said
[2:02:17] hey you picked the seven Church age
[2:02:19] Messengers it would not look like it
[2:02:21] looks like looks like
[2:02:23] it would not look the same
[2:02:26] it's easy for us in retrospect to look
[2:02:29] back and say oh I would have picked
[2:02:31] brother Branham
[2:02:32] but let's look at brother random before
[2:02:34] brother Brandon was brother Branham
[2:02:37] bantamweight boxer
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:40] come from a moonshining family not a
[2:02:43] religious background
[2:02:46] comes to Arkansas got a coat that's got
[2:02:49] a hole in it he's got to cover up with
[2:02:50] his hand got an old model T4 that he's
[2:02:53] knocked the door out of trying to beat
[2:02:55] it with his knee to keep himself awake
[2:02:57] would we have looked and said that's the
[2:03:00] church age messenger for laodicea
[2:03:02] is that who we would have chose
[2:03:04] but that's God's choice
[2:03:07] when we have looked at Paul and said
[2:03:08] that's the guy that's the first church
[2:03:12] age messenger we would have probably
[2:03:14] said stay as far away from that guy I
[2:03:15] mean I know he he acts like he believes
[2:03:17] right now but who knows he might flip it
[2:03:19] anytime he might turn on us and
[2:03:22] I know what it used to be oh yeah the
[2:03:25] devil loves to point back to that I know
[2:03:28] what a lot of people used to be I know
[2:03:29] what I used to be
[2:03:31] but I don't want to look back in the
[2:03:32] mirror at what they used to be look at
[2:03:34] what God has done
[2:03:36] look at what God has done
[2:03:40] so it's not our choice
[2:03:42] I know a lot of brothers they seem to
[2:03:44] preach around the message like they've
[2:03:45] got a spreadsheet of who's elect and
[2:03:47] who's not elect
[2:03:49] but God hasn't shared that spreadsheet
[2:03:51] with me
[2:03:54] so brother Graham said a lack doesn't
[2:03:55] persecute elect so how are we going to
[2:03:57] do it I guess I better not persecute
[2:03:58] anybody just to be safe
[2:04:01] because if I'd have been back there I
[2:04:03] sure wouldn't have thought that Paul was
[2:04:04] elect
[2:04:06] not when he was still Saul you couldn't
[2:04:08] have convinced me no I thought not that
[2:04:10] guy he looked by his by their fruits you
[2:04:12] shall know them that's true but we got
[2:04:14] to give people time sometimes and be
[2:04:16] long-suffering brother Ram says in the
[2:04:18] church age book there he said sometimes
[2:04:20] it takes the Son of God a long time to
[2:04:22] realize that he's a son of God
[2:04:27] amen praise the Lord we've got to stop
[2:04:30] somewhere so I guess here's a good spot
[2:04:35] sometimes it takes the Son of God a long
[2:04:38] time
[2:04:39] to realize he's the son of God
[2:04:43] you know Paul said that he blasphemed
[2:04:50] we would have admit right away we would
[2:04:52] have wrote Paul out well Jesus said if
[2:04:54] you blaspheme that's the imparnable sin
[2:04:55] but but read the next sentence but I did
[2:04:57] it through ignorance
[2:04:59] he did it through ignorance yeah
[2:05:02] brother Brandon said there was a man
[2:05:06] wrote him a letter
[2:05:09] dean of a Lutheran College
[2:05:11] said I went out to see what God was
[2:05:13] doing in the meeting he said what did I
[2:05:15] find nothing but a polished up
[2:05:17] soothsayer
[2:05:19] let's be honest if we didn't have the
[2:05:21] rest of that quote we would just write
[2:05:22] that man off and say no chance
[2:05:25] no way
[2:05:27] brother Branham Ronnie Mac called him
[2:05:29] brother
[2:05:30] went and met with him and fellowship to
[2:05:32] a thing yes sir and begin to talk to him
[2:05:34] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:05:36] that Dean and all those men there and
[2:05:38] the faculty turned their chairs around
[2:05:39] brother Benham said and received the
[2:05:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:44] our legalistic figuring out wouldn't
[2:05:46] allow that but I'm glad God doesn't just
[2:05:49] make me in charge of the choosing
[2:05:53] I had a brother that's been coming to
[2:05:55] our church for a while
[2:05:57] he came to me one day and said
[2:06:00] he said I had a Pharisee theology
[2:06:04] he said but the woman at the well really
[2:06:06] messed up my Pharisee theology
[2:06:11] you see if we're not careful
[2:06:13] we take on those same spirits that was
[2:06:15] back there and we begin to look at it
[2:06:17] well wear this and where that we're a
[2:06:20] message believer we belong to this we
[2:06:21] belong to that we fellowship with this
[2:06:23] group of brothers we believe these
[2:06:24] doctrines we that that's wonderful
[2:06:26] that's not what saves you
[2:06:29] I believe in going to church I believe
[2:06:31] in paying tithes I believe in reading my
[2:06:33] Bible I believe in listening to tapes
[2:06:35] none of those things saved me that's
[2:06:37] right
[2:06:38] I believe those are things that a safe
[2:06:39] person will want to do
[2:06:42] right but going to church I heard a man
[2:06:44] say it doesn't make you a Christian any
[2:06:46] more than standing in a garage makes you
[2:06:48] an automobile
[2:06:49] it's not the works that we do that we
[2:06:52] can work ourselves into something and
[2:06:54] have a checklist if it was then Jesus
[2:06:57] died in vain
[2:07:00] if he could have gave me a checklist and
[2:07:02] said just do all of this do this this by
[2:07:04] the Pharisees would have loved that oh I
[2:07:06] can do that but when he said there's
[2:07:08] nothing that you can do you've got to
[2:07:10] accept what I did they said oh wait a
[2:07:12] minute no
[2:07:13] seems so simple
[2:07:15] right but they wanted something they
[2:07:17] could do in it and if we're not careful
[2:07:19] we get to that spot where we think that
[2:07:20] it's something that we did in this that
[2:07:22] we were good enough or that we were
[2:07:24] smart enough or that we studied our way
[2:07:26] into this you cannot educate your way
[2:07:28] into the Holy Ghost
[2:07:31] you can't read enough quotes or listen
[2:07:33] to enough tapes or read your Bible
[2:07:34] enough
[2:07:35] this isn't Paul said he said this wasn't
[2:07:38] given to me by Flesh and Blood I didn't
[2:07:41] know man gave it to me but by the
[2:07:43] revelation of the Holy Spirit
[2:07:46] and so if it's him that gave it to us
[2:07:48] and it was a free gift then what can I
[2:07:50] say but thank you God for your grace
[2:07:53] how can I look down at somebody else and
[2:07:55] say well they don't see it like I see it
[2:07:57] well all I can say is thank God for eyes
[2:07:59] to see and here's to hear
[2:08:04] we've been looking at Judas there at
[2:08:06] church for about the last five Wednesday
[2:08:08] nights four or five Wednesday nights and
[2:08:10] I read it quote Wednesday night brother
[2:08:12] Brandon said
[2:08:13] Jesus gave Judas every opportunity the
[2:08:17] same opportunities
[2:08:19] that he gave the other disciples
[2:08:23] and then I read a quote at the end of
[2:08:25] service where he said
[2:08:27] he said now
[2:08:29] he's talking about Judas and and pharaoh
[2:08:31] and he said the the direction they went
[2:08:34] he said so if you've got the slightest
[2:08:35] spark in your heart
[2:08:38] to want to serve God
[2:08:40] then you ought to be the happiest person
[2:08:42] on the face of the Earth and you ought
[2:08:45] to serve him with everything that you've
[2:08:46] got
[2:08:49] so it it made me it reminded me I
[2:08:53] wouldn't say it made me think because
[2:08:54] it's thoughts that we should have
[2:08:56] already but it reminded me
[2:09:01] we need to have Grace for people
[2:09:04] we need to have our hand out to people
[2:09:08] there's people that
[2:09:10] they make decisions they make choices
[2:09:12] that I I don't agree with I can't I
[2:09:15] can't support
[2:09:18] but I also don't want to just write them
[2:09:20] off and say
[2:09:22] no they'll never make it right
[2:09:25] they'll never be a Christian they'll
[2:09:26] never be a believer
[2:09:28] because it's not my choice that's right
[2:09:30] it's God's choice
[2:09:33] I'll share something with you
[2:09:35] this is just a personal testimony this
[2:09:38] isn't on tape so you you can take it
[2:09:40] with a grain of salt but I thought it
[2:09:41] spoke to Brother branham's character and
[2:09:43] went along with what's on tape
[2:09:45] I don't I think it's okay for me to
[2:09:48] share it but
[2:09:50] a few years ago we were at a Longhorn
[2:09:52] Restaurant eating and
[2:09:54] Brother Joseph Branham and his wife's
[2:09:56] sister Valerie were there we ran into
[2:09:58] him and I got to talking to him in the
[2:09:59] parking lot he began to tell me about
[2:10:02] brother branham's Vision book there that
[2:10:03] brother Brandon would write down
[2:10:05] different visions and things and he said
[2:10:06] he had been reading in the vision book
[2:10:08] that morning brother made a statement
[2:10:10] about I don't remember if it was Lee or
[2:10:11] a gene but it was one of the two it was
[2:10:13] way back in the early 50s when he first
[2:10:15] met them God had given him a vision and
[2:10:18] he said he will turn against me but I
[2:10:21] must remain silent
[2:10:24] can you imagine what character that took
[2:10:26] yeah
[2:10:28] to still treat those Brothers the same
[2:10:29] knowing that
[2:10:31] it's hard enough for us to treat people
[2:10:33] many times when we know we don't know
[2:10:36] but we just think well they didn't shake
[2:10:37] my hand Sunday morning and they kind of
[2:10:39] they kind of you know we had a
[2:10:42] conversation the other day and the way
[2:10:43] they treated me I I don't know I think
[2:10:46] they may have something against me and
[2:10:47] we let the devil kind of put a thought
[2:10:49] in our mind and we begin to build up a
[2:10:50] little bitterness and build a complex
[2:10:52] around that but can you imagine standing
[2:10:54] there knowing brother bam said there'd
[2:10:55] be brothers put his their arms around
[2:10:57] him say oh brother Brandon we love you
[2:10:58] and he said and I know that they don't
[2:11:01] but he didn't stand there and expose him
[2:11:03] say brother so and so you don't love me
[2:11:05] I know what you said about me in the
[2:11:06] room the other day he the character that
[2:11:08] God placed in his life to be able to
[2:11:10] stand there and still love that person
[2:11:12] anyhow
[2:11:14] amen
[2:11:15] yes makes me want to spend some more
[2:11:18] time in prayer say Lord
[2:11:20] I need that perfect love
[2:11:24] I need I need brother Graham said that
[2:11:26] when he went beyond the current time
[2:11:27] there he said nothing
[2:11:29] could enter there
[2:11:31] but perfect love
[2:11:33] he said lay aside everything else and
[2:11:35] get perfect love and many times we lay
[2:11:37] aside everything else and we run after a
[2:11:38] Doctrine or we run after a personality
[2:11:41] or we run after a group or this or that
[2:11:44] or something exciting to us or something
[2:11:46] that we can identify ourselves around
[2:11:48] but he said lay aside everything yes and
[2:11:51] get perfect love
[2:11:53] I need more of it I don't know about you
[2:11:55] I need I need more of the love of Jesus
[2:11:58] Christ in my life
[2:12:01] I was sharing with brother Samuel last
[2:12:03] night I won't share the whole dream
[2:12:04] because of time and just because it's
[2:12:06] not necessary but
[2:12:08] I was sharing brother Samuel a dream
[2:12:10] that happened right before
[2:12:12] we had that experience in a prayer line
[2:12:14] together he and I brother brother
[2:12:15] Jonathan and
[2:12:18] in the dream there was some there was a
[2:12:20] demonic power that was coming against me
[2:12:22] in the dream and I pled the blood of
[2:12:24] Jesus Christ against it and in the dream
[2:12:26] it stopped that they weren't able to
[2:12:28] harm me because I'd pled the blood of
[2:12:31] Jesus Christ but it wasn't helping them
[2:12:32] it was just protecting me
[2:12:34] and the dream I prayed and I said God
[2:12:37] let that person experience your love in
[2:12:40] a way that they've never experienced it
[2:12:42] and they just crumpled to the floor in
[2:12:44] the dream
[2:12:46] we need more of that amen not by power
[2:12:50] not by might but by my spirit saith the
[2:12:52] Lord
[2:12:54] if I can't look at a brother and brother
[2:12:56] Graham said if I can't bitterly disagree
[2:12:58] with him and still love him he said that
[2:13:00] I need to be adult
[2:13:03] we can we can ask God when we get over
[2:13:05] there God why did you choose this one
[2:13:07] and why did you choose that one but I'm
[2:13:08] not going to stand like the Pharisees in
[2:13:10] the doorway and try to Bar somebody from
[2:13:12] getting into heaven I want to open the
[2:13:14] door of Grace just as wide as I can
[2:13:16] for anybody that can get in
[2:13:19] let's bow our heads together
[2:13:24] I've been trying to stop for a while but
[2:13:25] maybe that was for somebody that needed
[2:13:27] to hear it
[2:13:28] Lord Jesus
[2:13:31] Lord I'm so thankful for your grace
[2:13:36] Lord I needed it so desperately
[2:13:39] where would I be without your grace
[2:13:43] and so Lord there's nothing that I can
[2:13:45] bring and say look at what I did or look
[2:13:47] at what I said or look at what I've
[2:13:49] accomplished lord it's just been you
[2:13:53] every one of us as Minister Brothers if
[2:13:55] we'll be honest with ourselves any any
[2:13:57] good thing of Eternal value that's been
[2:14:00] done through our Ministries has just
[2:14:02] been when we had enough sense to get out
[2:14:04] of the way and let you work
[2:14:06] lets you move and lets you speak
[2:14:10] as brother Bannon would say he wasn't
[2:14:12] the son of man he was just the one
[2:14:14] standing near when he spoke
[2:14:18] God help us to get into a channel
[2:14:21] to where it can be so much of Jesus
[2:14:23] Christ
[2:14:24] to where it's not the human
[2:14:25] instrumentality that gets the glory it's
[2:14:28] not the vessel
[2:14:30] but all we can do is just say it wasn't
[2:14:32] me
[2:14:34] I just let him borrow my lips or my
[2:14:37] hands or my feet whatever I could loan
[2:14:39] him that he could use and he could work
[2:14:41] through
[2:14:43] it takes you Lord
[2:14:45] heavenly father I pray for every brother
[2:14:47] Lord every congregation represented here
[2:14:51] Lord these Pastor brothers that Lord I
[2:14:54] know how busy being a pastor can be in
[2:14:57] the pressures and the time that goes
[2:15:00] into it praying for our congregations
[2:15:01] and studying and counseling and
[2:15:04] different things and for them to take
[2:15:06] time out of their week to drive up to
[2:15:08] these meetings and be a part of it and
[2:15:10] pull on the gift that you've placed in
[2:15:12] my life Lord I appreciate it I pray that
[2:15:14] you bless each brother represented here
[2:15:16] each Minister bless their congregations
[2:15:20] Lord bless their Ministries use them in
[2:15:22] a mighty way
[2:15:24] Lord may it never be a competition
[2:15:26] between any of us Lord but may it just
[2:15:28] be about lost souls about helping
[2:15:31] somebody
[2:15:32] and if one of my brothers can reach
[2:15:34] somebody that I could never reach Lord
[2:15:36] may it never be a pride thing of of all
[2:15:38] I'm jealous that they could help that
[2:15:40] person but may I Rejoice with them
[2:15:43] and Lord if you can use me to reach
[2:15:44] somebody that they couldn't reach Lord
[2:15:46] may we just Rejoice together that
[2:15:48] somebody was able to yield to the holy
[2:15:50] spirit in a way where that person could
[2:15:52] be helped
[2:15:53] Lord for the lay members Lord may we not
[2:15:56] just look at one another and Lord it's
[2:15:58] so easy for us to look as as Samuel did
[2:16:01] at the outward appearance and and judge
[2:16:03] somebody and and just look and see their
[2:16:06] circumstance or their condition but we
[2:16:08] don't know what lays behind there all
[2:16:10] the hurts and the heartaches and the
[2:16:12] broken roads that they've walked Lord
[2:16:14] and and all the lies behind that maybe
[2:16:18] decisions that we wouldn't agree with
[2:16:19] but Lord not knowing maybe all that
[2:16:22] transpired to compel them and and get
[2:16:24] them into a place where in desperation
[2:16:26] maybe they made the wrong decision but
[2:16:28] but God we're not their judge and jury
[2:16:31] Lord may we stand there like you did
[2:16:34] with the woman caught in the very act
[2:16:35] and extend grace and mercy and say hey I
[2:16:39] can't I can't agree with your decision
[2:16:40] but I know I know there's a way back
[2:16:43] I know there's Grace for you I'm not
[2:16:46] here to be your judge I'm not here to
[2:16:48] push you away from church or put you
[2:16:50] away from the message or try to
[2:16:52] unchristianize you I'm just here to
[2:16:54] remind you his grace is sufficient
[2:16:57] amen
[2:16:59] help us Jesus
[2:17:02] draw us closer to you I pray father
[2:17:05] give us more of that love Lord and more
[2:17:07] long-suffering
[2:17:09] help us Jesus help us to draw the circle
[2:17:12] bigger instead of trying to get it down
[2:17:14] to where it's just our for and know more
[2:17:15] but father may we have a handout to help
[2:17:18] somebody
[2:17:19] to be an encouragement to somebody
[2:17:22] Lord even if they never see everything
[2:17:24] exactly the way we do Lord that's that's
[2:17:26] not what the what it's all about Lord
[2:17:28] here your Prophet told us there and
[2:17:31] in a sermon he said when God gave us the
[2:17:35] Holy Ghost in our own peculiarities he
[2:17:37] proved that he's ignoring our Doctrine
[2:17:39] and yet many times we divide over such
[2:17:42] Minor Details of doctrines and things
[2:17:45] Lord and try to separate and divide
[2:17:48] Brotherhood and fellowship Lord help us
[2:17:51] Lord I know we we have to stand for the
[2:17:54] truth and stand for what's right but
[2:17:56] Lord we can still do that and put our
[2:17:58] arm around a brother and draw the circle
[2:17:59] bigger Lord his brother Brandon would
[2:18:01] say there when he first got saved and he
[2:18:03] became a Baptist preacher he thought if
[2:18:05] he wasn't Baptist you're just out
[2:18:07] but then he began to realize that the
[2:18:09] blanket stretched a little further
[2:18:11] to cover other brothers Lord may that be
[2:18:13] our attitude
[2:18:16] Lord may we extend the hand of
[2:18:18] fellowship and the arm of Grace Lord to
[2:18:20] anyone that will receive it
[2:18:23] Lord may we pray for those the Lord may
[2:18:25] be ones that have made made choices that
[2:18:27] we totally disagree with but Lord
[2:18:29] instead of taking them to social media
[2:18:31] and running them down or or trying to
[2:18:33] run them down a church Lord may we take
[2:18:35] them to our prayer closet and pray for
[2:18:37] their needs pray for their soul pray
[2:18:40] that you'd move in their life pray that
[2:18:42] you'd turn that circumstance around
[2:18:44] help us not to get an old critical
[2:18:46] judgmental Spirit Lord like the
[2:18:48] Pharisees had but may we have that love
[2:18:51] and compassion and grace and mercy like
[2:18:53] you did Lord I know I needed it so if I
[2:18:56] need it Lord help me to extend it to
[2:18:58] someone else
[2:19:00] help us father be with the rest of the
[2:19:02] services this weekend Lord be with these
[2:19:04] other brothers their services on Sunday
[2:19:06] Lord may you bless them with the great
[2:19:08] outpouring of your presence

[2:19:14] Jesus Christ's name
[2:19:18] and all you love the Lord tonight
[2:19:21] brother Paul I know we put you on the
[2:19:23] spot tonight but I I was feeling led to
[2:19:26] sing that song I Feel the pool but I
[2:19:27] can't sing it with him sitting there so
[2:19:28] could you come and sing that for us
[2:19:30] brother
[2:19:32] I thank God for it
[2:19:35] for men of God that God's anointed to
[2:19:37] write songs like this it's a great
[2:19:39] blessing to the bride
[2:19:42] amen
[2:19:49] can you imagine David there
[2:19:52] in the Sin with Bathsheba and he goes
[2:19:54] and he begins to pray and ask God
[2:20:00] he says restore unto me the joy of my
[2:20:02] salvation
[2:20:06] take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[2:20:09] and this is a prayer of a man who just
[2:20:11] made the biggest mistake of his life
[2:20:14] fell flat on his face spiritually
[2:20:18] and God thought so much of that prayer
[2:20:21] that he put it in the Bible
[2:20:24] it's been such an encouragement to us
[2:20:26] sometimes songs and things are written
[2:20:28] out of out of great trials and valleys
[2:20:31] and things but
[2:20:34] but I'm thankful that men of God yield
[2:20:36] their gifts whether it be preaching or
[2:20:37] songwriting or singing or playing an
[2:20:39] instrument or being a witness whatever
[2:20:40] it be I thank God for any person that'll

[2:29:57] goodness what's taking place

[2:30:03] him

[2:30:06] reach out his hand to us
[2:30:09] the way that that meal reach out his
[2:30:11] hand all we have to do is rise and take
[2:30:14] it
[2:30:15] because when God reaches out his hand to
[2:30:18] us
[2:30:19] it brings us right back into Fellowship
[2:30:22] the right way
[2:30:24] is that right it's not just something
[2:30:26] where God just comes and he doesn't Pat
[2:30:29] sin on the back but there is a right
[2:30:31] approach
[2:30:32] big man but you know why God does that
[2:30:34] because his love and his care God wants
[2:30:38] to do something for you and I to
[2:30:41] establish us
[2:30:42] aren't you glad about that I'm glad when
[2:30:45] I go to the doctor he just don't look at
[2:30:46] me and tell me what I want to hear yeah
[2:30:49] sometimes they might look at you and say
[2:30:52] and when they do that
[2:30:55] you know something's coming
[2:30:57] but I'm glad they just don't pat you on
[2:30:59] the back I'm glad they tell you the
[2:31:00] things you need to hear but for what
[2:31:02] that is that's a hand stretched out
[2:31:04] but I'll tell you what we can take
[2:31:06] confidence in the hand of God
[2:31:09] because it is the very God of truth and
[2:31:13] the Bible said what a promise we have of
[2:31:15] them who will bless themselves in the
[2:31:17] god of the amen the god of the truth
[2:31:19] amen don't you love him tonight amen
[2:31:23] well
[2:31:25] Brother Paul's congregation they hear
[2:31:27] him sing this a lot I know but
[2:31:30] we're gonna have you sing it here
[2:31:31] because what a song to be sung tonight
[2:31:34] and we are God's choice
[2:31:37] and you know I think of what brother
[2:31:39] John and sister Loretta used to sing
[2:31:40] that old song from I think the Lanny
[2:31:42] wood Trio and that was he didn't bring
[2:31:44] me this far to leave me but I think it's
[2:31:48] something to be mindful of he promised
[2:31:50] to hold my hand
[2:31:52] amen all the way through amen he
[2:31:56] promised to hold
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:31:59] he promised to help please
[2:32:24] standing on his promises
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:44] [Music]
[2:32:55] [Music]
[2:32:58] standing up promises
[2:33:07] [Music]
[2:33:14] Hallelujah
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:36] tonight
[2:33:37] my way
[2:33:39] let my feet
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:34:09] [Music]
[2:34:41] is
[2:34:42] [Music]
[2:34:55] Hallelujah
[2:35:08] [Applause]
[2:35:09] leave me to the other side his promises
[2:35:14] alive
[2:35:18] [Music]
[2:35:20] living it is
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:45] [Applause]
[2:35:57] standing on his promise
[2:36:02] [Music]
[2:36:28] Hallelujah glory be to God
[2:36:32] amen and the church said
[2:36:35] amen and amen
[2:36:37] amen glory be to God
[2:36:40] my
[2:36:42] as many things that I would like to we
[2:36:44] could say but I'm not going I'm not
[2:36:45] gonna God has said of all the needs to
[2:36:47] be said and if I start saying things
[2:36:49] it'll probably get in his notes
[2:36:52] I just had a good time
[2:36:55] to me this is down home cooking
[2:36:59] you know there's a lot of advertisements
[2:37:01] about that many times but it ain't down
[2:37:02] home cooking it's pre-packaged
[2:37:06] this one pre-packaged
[2:37:09] it was down home cooking
[2:37:12] may God comes right down into all the
[2:37:14] channels and areas of our life
[2:37:16] I really I mean there's so many
[2:37:19] different points and I'm not going to
[2:37:20] break my promise of what I just said
[2:37:23] and I love that
[2:37:25] pulling out of the scripture Jonah going
[2:37:28] down and down and down
[2:37:32] you know God was leading him that way
[2:37:37] it looked contrary
[2:37:39] to the will of God
[2:37:41] but seeing here is where God's will
[2:37:43] takes place
[2:37:45] and God was leading Jonah to a place
[2:37:49] where he would face full responsibility
[2:37:53] and that full responsibility
[2:37:55] was looking at himself and saying I
[2:37:58] can't do what you've called me to do
[2:38:01] but I want to surrender all that I have
[2:38:04] to you that the omnipotent God can use
[2:38:09] me the way he sees fit to use me
[2:38:12] that's the responsibility in this hour
[2:38:16] we've come face to face with the Living
[2:38:18] God
[2:38:19] and just like Moses just like the rest
[2:38:21] Lord
[2:38:22] I cannot do anything without you
[2:38:26] how the Lord spoke tonight you know we
[2:38:28] we can we can go clear to another side
[2:38:30] we compare ourselves we can look at all
[2:38:32] of our weaknesses but you know all those
[2:38:34] weaknesses God knew all of those would
[2:38:37] be there there weren't mistakes there
[2:38:38] wasn't oh if this would have happened
[2:38:40] different if it no
[2:38:42] we didn't get to choose on the human
[2:38:43] grab bag of life
[2:38:46] it's not a value meal where you can
[2:38:48] change pickles no pickles mustard
[2:38:50] ketchup you don't extra onions this is
[2:38:52] not that way but God knew all those
[2:38:54] weaknesses
[2:38:55] but when we can surrender those
[2:38:57] weaknesses not just make excuses But
[2:38:59] realize in his presence God doesn't do
[2:39:02] that to embarrass us
[2:39:04] he does it that we might surrender and
[2:39:08] then brother Ram said he pours himself
[2:39:10] in
[2:39:12] and uses himself through those channels
[2:39:16] I tell you God knows what he's doing
[2:39:19] because when I would look at me I
[2:39:21] wouldn't have picked me
[2:39:25] I'm just telling the truth
[2:39:27] but you know what I like about that I
[2:39:30] can't put me out
[2:39:32] you didn't pick me you can't put me out
[2:39:35] and there ain't a devil big enough
[2:39:38] can put me out of the plan of God
[2:39:42] so good
[2:39:44] good God is so good amen you love the
[2:39:47] Lord tonight
[2:39:48] I tell you right God has come right down
[2:39:50] and spoke there's enough there's enough
[2:39:52] ammunition tonight not only just back
[2:39:54] the devil up in the corner but you need
[2:39:55] to go ahead in these boxes ears a little
[2:39:57] bit you didn't get him back down the
[2:40:00] size of what he really is I take this
[2:40:01] word and you're home with you tonight
[2:40:04] and just bring him right back down to
[2:40:06] size
