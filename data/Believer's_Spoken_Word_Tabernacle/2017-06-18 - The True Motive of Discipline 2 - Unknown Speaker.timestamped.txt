[34:05] like to have it updated some of you I
[34:07] know that are not on the email list uh
[34:11] different ones in order to the notes
[34:14] that you see here uh those are sent out
[34:17] some of you write down your notes and
[34:19] things like that and that's wonderful as
[34:21] well but it's just always there for you
[34:23] so that you have that you can always
[34:24] pull it down what's what is displayed up
[34:26] here here right off of the email the
[34:28] copy and um so that that paper when you
[34:32] when you have that just have it
[34:35] completed just return it uh there to the
[34:37] library you can even hand it to one of
[34:39] the deacons or so forth but it's right
[34:41] out there in the prayer request table if
[34:42] you will um just do that would that be
[34:46] okay now we're not going we're not
[34:49] telemarketers we're not going to put you
[34:51] on a list and call you for we're not
[34:54] doing that okay so
[34:57] Amen brother
[35:25] Malachi
[36:55] e
[37:08] amen let's stand and go right into the
[37:10] word if we
[37:18] could let's go to Second
[37:21] Corinthians chapter
[37:23] 7 verse
[37:25] 12
[37:41] the scripture we're getting ready to
[37:42] read it's kind of like at the end of
[37:46] things that we will I want to continue
[37:49] to work with here this
[37:51] morning but this is a result that
[37:55] Paul has witnessed in the lives of the
[38:00] people in that how that they have
[38:04] received
[38:06] correction and see the fruits of it of
[38:09] how that it has worked in their lives
[38:12] remember when Paul himself when he when
[38:14] Paul is writing this letter this is
[38:16] what's very important when Paul deals
[38:19] with the things that he has written and
[38:21] how he has addressed the church he's
[38:24] addressed it as father in the gospel
[38:28] that's very significant that's just not
[38:29] a title it shows that there in order for
[38:32] True correction to come there must be
[38:36] relationship if there's no relationship
[38:39] then all correction is is
[38:41] government are you with me so there must
[38:44] be that relationship so those words are
[38:46] not just words that are loose there when
[38:47] Paul would write concerning being a a
[38:50] father to them in the gospel and we'll
[38:53] look at some things how Paul will
[38:54] address this in verse 12 of second
[38:56] Corinthians 7 let's look at how Paul is
[38:59] writing this is the result of of the
[39:03] discipline and the correction that has
[39:04] been received wherefore though I wrote
[39:07] unto you I did it not for his cause that
[39:11] had done the wrong remember the the the
[39:14] young man who was living with his uh uh
[39:18] stepmother I believe it was he was
[39:20] living with with her and thou how that
[39:24] it was to where Paul had admonished the
[39:26] church church we were reading last week
[39:29] to address that situation and to attend
[39:32] to it Paul is letting what Paul is
[39:36] making known here is the motive that's
[39:39] been behind the discipline all
[39:42] along so he says not for his cause that
[39:45] had done the wrong so Paul's Focus was
[39:47] not just upon the wrong nor for his
[39:50] cause that suffered wrong but that our
[39:53] care for you in the sight of God might
[39:56] might appear unto
[39:58] you wow so you mean love if I have love
[40:02] and all the love is is Teddy
[40:04] Bears and chocolates and it doesn't
[40:07] balance with the other part with
[40:08] correction that's right that that's not
[40:10] real love no you're only manifesting a
[40:13] portion or a part of Love see it's got
[40:17] to be a balance there's a David said thy
[40:19] rod and thy staff they comfort me not
[40:21] just the rod but the staff as well so
[40:25] there's two parts Hearts within it so
[40:28] therefore he goes on to say in verse 13
[40:30] therefore we were comforted in your
[40:33] comfort yay and exceedingly the more
[40:36] joyed we for the joy of Titus because
[40:41] his Spirit was refreshed by you all for
[40:45] if I have boasted anything to him of you
[40:48] I am not ashamed but as we spake all
[40:52] things to you in truth even so our
[40:55] boasting which I I made before Titus is
[40:58] found a truth wow so Paul was actually
[41:02] bragging on
[41:04] him y'all with
[41:06] me Paul was actually bragging on the
[41:09] people yeah he didn't hate
[41:11] them correction he didn't dislike them
[41:14] what's he bragging about he's not
[41:16] bragging uh just about them but about
[41:19] how that they have responded to the word
[41:22] of the Lord that's Paul's Comfort that's
[41:25] his comfort that's what he's saying I've
[41:27] boasted to Titus of you all and you know
[41:29] what what I said to Titus he saw and
[41:32] what he saw refreshed him and when he
[41:34] was so refreshed he came back to me and
[41:37] I was
[41:39] refreshed and his inward affection is
[41:41] more abundant toward you whilst he
[41:45] rememberthe of you all how with fear and
[41:48] trembling ye received him I Rejoice
[41:51] therefore that I have confidence in you
[41:54] in all things amen may God bless the
[41:58] reading of his word as you're being
[42:12] seated I want to just in in looking at
[42:15] this
[42:17] here there's a part
[42:20] that when we're when we're looking at
[42:23] it here within the in the
[42:27] scriptures there are are things that as
[42:31] we're going through it I want you to
[42:33] understand something very clearly and
[42:35] I'm speaking to you as your pastor this
[42:37] morning I want you to understand very
[42:40] clearly that even the course of how that
[42:43] the Lord took us last week through the
[42:46] word and even where we are at this
[42:49] week we are not on a sid track we are
[42:53] not on a side note we're right in line
[42:57] we've been looking at we've been looking
[42:59] at motives if those of you whove been
[43:02] paying attention to the Thursday
[43:04] services and the Sunday Services most of
[43:06] those things that I'm drawing from is
[43:09] where the spirit of the Lord just from
[43:11] about a month and a half ago begin
[43:12] quickening to my heart the message that
[43:14] the prophet preached called Hebrews
[43:16] chapter 7 part one and all things that
[43:18] I've been dealing with on the midweek as
[43:20] well as in here that's where the spirit
[43:22] of God has so inspired those things with
[43:24] motives I say that not to approve it but
[43:27] I say it in a manner so that you can see
[43:30] that when God when we're looking at
[43:31] discipline and we're looking at these
[43:33] things that we understand is how the
[43:36] Lord was taking us last week is that
[43:39] when the Bible speaks to us in the Book
[43:41] of Proverbs and it says that foolishness
[43:43] is bound in the heart of the child and
[43:45] the rod driveth it far from him so the
[43:49] rod is the instrument to remove the
[43:51] foolishness that's Bound in the heart
[43:53] that foolishness is is is there there
[43:56] and it must be removed that's a
[43:58] principle all of these parts that God
[44:00] gives to us even as parents and in other
[44:03] parts God does never he never says
[44:07] anything whereby that he's just saying
[44:10] it if he says it it must be a part of
[44:12] who he is and it must be identified in
[44:16] his characteristics meaning that it's
[44:19] not just something he's telling me to do
[44:21] and he doesn't do it himself you
[44:24] understand he is his word so this the
[44:29] the the Bible itself is not just
[44:30] something we look at as a instruction
[44:33] manual it's the Living God who comes
[44:37] down and this is not just a book of
[44:40] History it is a book of
[44:43] Prophecy because it is the same spirit
[44:46] of God who has moved down Through the
[44:48] Ages that brings the word to a live and
[44:51] a living reality I want you to think of
[44:54] this very closely because when you when
[44:56] we're looking at these things that some
[44:58] things I just want to lay in and really
[44:59] just kind of further teach on on these
[45:02] parts of it in that true M the true
[45:05] motive of discipline is that there is a
[45:08] real real responsibility that we must
[45:12] understand as a body of Believers but
[45:16] also as
[45:19] parents as a
[45:22] pastor grandparents and so forth all
[45:25] across the board
[45:27] the the the reality is is that you know
[45:30] when we look at these scriptures that I
[45:32] want to move back into in just a
[45:34] moment nothing within God's word is to
[45:38] be taken
[45:39] lightly nor is it to be applied
[45:46] lightly we don't apply things simply
[45:48] because it's black and
[45:50] white we must apply it with the love of
[45:53] God by the leadership of the Holy Holy
[45:56] Spirit if not then it becomes the
[46:00] government of
[46:02] Christianity you understand the prophet
[46:04] said we do not make converts out of the
[46:06] government of Christianity what is it by
[46:08] the New Birth the change of
[46:11] heart so when we're looking at it it's
[46:14] God God's desire is not that you or me
[46:18] would walk down walk around in a sense
[46:21] of trepidation like God's going to get
[46:23] me God's going to get me when you walk
[46:26] in that manner you won't do
[46:29] nothing that's why God had to address
[46:32] Joshua in chapter 1 he didn't want him
[46:34] walk around in fear when God said fear
[46:36] not it wasn't so much of the inhabitants
[46:38] of the land it was your own inabilities
[46:42] I want you to know Joshua I know your
[46:45] inabilities but I'm not called you based
[46:48] on your abilities I've called you
[46:51] because I placed that gift within you
[46:53] where you won't trust in your abilities
[46:55] you'll trust in my
[46:59] leadership it would make sense for God
[47:01] when he is wanting a purpose for us we
[47:03] look at in the carinal it would make
[47:05] sense that God would call someone in the
[47:07] days of Noah that was a master ship
[47:09] Builder he didn't call someone who was a
[47:12] master ship Builder he called a
[47:17] farmer Hallelujah it wasn't because of
[47:20] his skills that's why Peter said you
[47:22] don't speak according to your
[47:24] ability speak according to the ability
[47:28] and that whereby is by the Holy Ghost
[47:30] sent down from heaven to minister the
[47:35] word so when we're looking at these
[47:38] parts in the word of God God doesn't
[47:42] want walking around in a in a fear of
[47:44] trepidation but God's desire is a fear
[47:48] and a holy fear which is a
[47:52] reverence it's a reverence that's what
[47:55] God desires
[47:56] ties is
[47:58] reverence so when we look at this it all
[48:01] it applies across the board when we're
[48:03] looking at it I'm going to work with
[48:04] some things here at first that are
[48:06] dealing with things that even of how
[48:08] that we work as parents even as a pastor
[48:11] as a
[48:12] church one thing that you find and I was
[48:14] ending up with this last week that we
[48:16] find in God's word in the very first
[48:19] chapter of the
[48:21] Bible God has boundaries
[48:27] discipline without boundaries is not
[48:29] discipline it's called
[48:33] confusion so boundaries must also be
[48:40] consistent so you know what to
[48:43] expect see see Satan wants to mess with
[48:47] boundaries God set boundaries in the
[48:50] Garden of
[48:51] Eden but Satan came in through the
[48:55] vehicle the tool of the
[48:57] serpent he wasn't slithering in a tree
[49:00] the Bible said he was a serpent a most
[49:03] subtle Beast not serpent beast of the
[49:07] field and he was able to
[49:10] speak what did he do he took the
[49:13] boundaries that God had said in the word
[49:15] and he said the boundaries don't apply
[49:17] surely God will
[49:19] not what did it do it brought confusion
[49:23] and confusion itself here she gives in
[49:27] boundaries God has always set his
[49:30] boundaries are clear his boundaries are
[49:33] his word his boundaries are him because
[49:35] we're not baptized into a church 1
[49:38] Corinthians 12 says by one Spirit we are
[49:40] baptized into one
[49:44] body
[49:46] Hallelujah So within that we are in his
[49:50] house it's under his administration
[49:52] under his direction we are his
[49:54] responsibility
[49:57] so he has set the boundaries and I'll
[49:59] tell you this boundaries themselves
[50:01] understand boundaries are not something
[50:02] that you just look at and say oh oh you
[50:05] know like it's electric fence or
[50:07] something boundaries are
[50:11] security job said he set a hedge around
[50:14] about
[50:15] me the Bible says in the in the book of
[50:18] uh in the book I believe it's zechar a
[50:20] wall of fire around me that's
[50:24] boundaries Hallelujah boundaries are a
[50:28] comfort
[50:30] amen God cared so much about boundaries
[50:33] he said I said the Moon the Moon will
[50:35] watch over the
[50:36] boundaries the sea can only go so far
[50:39] what happens when the sea or something's
[50:40] troubled and it goes beyond the
[50:42] boundaries chaos
[50:45] destruction God has set the boundaries
[50:47] what causes that what is the typhoons
[50:49] all those things results of does God
[50:51] permit it God permits it but it is of
[50:54] Satan are you with me God all listen God
[50:57] is over he permits those things
[50:59] judgments and all those things to come
[51:01] but if but in in the new Heaven and new
[51:03] earth when we go into the Millennium and
[51:04] then the new Heaven and new earth there
[51:06] will be no
[51:10] storms yes sir because remember he had
[51:13] Justified baptized this Earth in Noah's
[51:16] day he dropped his blood at Calvary to
[51:19] sanctify it and then it's to receive his
[51:22] baptism of fire the Holy Ghost where he
[51:24] will sat down upon
[51:26] it and just as he did in your
[51:29] soul and what happens when he does that
[51:31] in your soul there's no more storms no
[51:33] more typhoons in your
[51:36] soul
[51:38] Hallelujah why because the seal is there
[51:41] the seal is God's boundaries that God
[51:43] has set there you cannot come over this
[51:45] bloodline you cannot cross the token you
[51:48] cannot cross the bloodline that's God's
[51:51] strength so boundaries consistent
[51:54] boundaries and they must be consistent
[51:57] it's just like you know what we
[51:58] understand with consistency I I I I I if
[52:01] this is a standard that has been placed
[52:03] within your home and the standard you
[52:05] hold to it and and whe whatever it might
[52:08] be that that you would you would call
[52:09] out maybe they know it's it you know
[52:12] crying and putting themselves in the
[52:13] floor whatever more if they get
[52:15] corrected on that on Monday and they do
[52:16] it on Tuesday guess what Tuesday
[52:18] correction again why it's driving it out
[52:21] of the
[52:23] heart you understand
[52:26] it's
[52:31] consistency we might be here three hours
[52:33] a
[52:34] day is that all
[52:37] right I'm not going to keep
[52:39] you but I want you to see listen friends
[52:43] sometimes we're not aware you we're not
[52:45] maybe as aware as we ought to be that
[52:47] this that the prince of power of the air
[52:48] it's it tampers with all of these
[52:51] principles to where you have things that
[52:54] and and and and I I don't mean anything
[52:56] any disregards to any parents or anyone
[52:58] whether it's streaming or whatever more
[53:00] but the reality is is that that is a
[53:02] common principle on
[53:03] consistency but you can see how the
[53:06] things within this world in this earth
[53:08] the way things have come to and got to a
[53:10] place it's like parents don't know what
[53:11] to
[53:13] do what do I do what do I do why is this
[53:17] taking place why is that going on there
[53:18] is a balance because remember it's not
[53:22] it's not to bring fear to where when you
[53:24] walk in the room oh gosh is he coming oh
[53:27] no okay let's go ahead and keep acting
[53:28] the way we're
[53:29] acting you know how I was in school they
[53:32] got to look out you know at the doorway
[53:34] some of y'all you know what I'm talking
[53:35] about you got to look out at the doorway
[53:37] and then the rest of everybody else is
[53:38] doing their thing but then when all of a
[53:40] here it comes and you can hear it coming
[53:41] down the hallway I mean I don't know how
[53:44] many times I can hear it coming down the
[53:45] hallway you can hear
[53:49] it sometimes i' have to stand outside my
[53:51] door and chuckle oh God help me help me
[53:53] Lord Jesus before I walk in there I know
[53:55] what you're
[54:01] doing God does it because you know why
[54:03] that's why listen Christianity just by
[54:06] taking the government of the principles
[54:08] and the laws of Christianity without a
[54:10] birth it only makes you a good person
[54:12] when it's Church
[54:15] time you can only stay as good as long
[54:18] as you adhere to the laws but once you
[54:20] had a new birth and it's written on the
[54:23] inside then you not walking by an
[54:26] outside government you're walking by an
[54:28] internal
[54:30] governance that's why Paul said our
[54:32] conversation that word conversation is
[54:35] our conduct our constitution of the
[54:37] Commonwealth is in
[54:39] heaven that's why Jesus can say now you
[54:41] see the son of man yet here he is and
[54:43] yet he's ascended up here he is on Earth
[54:45] you're walking in heaven when you have
[54:47] been quickened you're seated in Heavenly
[54:49] places and yet walking here on Earth and
[54:52] you're under the administration of the
[54:54] Holy Ghost in your life it don't matter
[54:56] where you go you're a Christian
[54:57] everywhere you go the token shows
[55:00] wherever you
[55:02] go I'm talking about the seal the
[55:05] blood so when we see it the principle of
[55:10] the scripture there's there principles
[55:12] in Scripture that deal with hate now
[55:16] when we look at the term
[55:19] hate uh when we we're thinking of it in
[55:22] terms of scripture when when here when
[55:25] God is speaking in the Book of Malachi
[55:27] Paul picks it up in the Book of Romans
[55:29] when he says uh Jacob have I loved Esau
[55:32] have I hated you would look at it and
[55:34] you say how can God hate but it's not
[55:39] the kind of hate that you think of
[55:40] that's associated with Satan that term
[55:44] hate is L
[55:47] less are you with me God detests sin are
[55:52] you with me now let's be clear here God
[55:54] hates hates sin but he loves The
[55:58] Sinner are you with me the word hate is
[56:04] lovess so let me read the scripture to
[56:06] you and I I I've got a but I've got a
[56:08] question first of all I want you to
[56:09] think about the
[56:11] question is it possible for a parent or
[56:14] parents to hate their
[56:19] children I know some of you look at me
[56:21] like man you tricking me I'm asking you
[56:23] a question I'm ask you a question I'm
[56:25] asking you a question not to trick you
[56:27] I'm ask you a question to think because
[56:28] I'm getting ready to say
[56:30] something or rather is it possible for a
[56:34] parent or parents to love in a lesser
[56:36] way than they
[56:39] should Proverbs
[56:41] 1324 he that spareth his
[56:45] Rod what's it say hateth his
[56:50] son now this isn't my word this is God's
[56:53] word
[56:56] so is it possible for a parent or so
[56:59] forth that they could have a lesser love
[57:01] or in terms of how God says it hate
[57:03] their children sure this is according to
[57:06] God's word y'all believe this
[57:08] right some of y'all got deer in the
[57:10] headlights and I know this is teaching I
[57:12] know I know I'm teaching but I I want us
[57:14] to look and I want us to look into the
[57:15] depth of not just looking uh just in the
[57:18] scope of church or parent pastor but
[57:21] look into the depths of our
[57:23] life but he that loveth him chasteneth
[57:27] him be
[57:31] times if every time you're with me or
[57:34] I'm with you I'm correcting you guess
[57:37] what you ain't going to want to be with
[57:39] me very long that's
[57:43] right and all the parents said help me
[57:47] Jesus those that have the teenagers help
[57:49] me
[57:51] Jesus you
[57:53] understand
[57:56] some of you that a little bit older you
[57:58] reserving that laugh you're like been
[58:01] there amen because what I what we're
[58:04] looking at discipline itself when we're
[58:06] talking about the rod it isn't always
[58:08] the belt the strap whatever it isn't it
[58:10] isn't always that discipline
[58:13] itself is a Living
[58:16] Image there can be things that are seen
[58:20] by the image and character of how you
[58:23] even conduct yourself and handle
[58:25] yourself that others can
[58:27] see that's why Paul could tell the the
[58:30] the older men speak to the younger men
[58:32] being sober minded in other things he
[58:34] told the older sisters they they were to
[58:36] speak to the younger sisters about
[58:37] certain things virtues and so forth he
[58:40] dealt with those things like that it
[58:42] chastening be times as as as often that
[58:45] is
[58:51] needed let me ask you this is it
[58:53] possible that that a parents love
[58:56] pastor's love a Church's love could be
[59:03] selfish is
[59:08] it Samuel love how could love be selfish
[59:13] when everything is about
[59:16] you
[59:18] abely Pastor says I'm not going to
[59:20] correct because I want them to keep
[59:23] coming wow wow I'm not going to do this
[59:26] because they might leave the
[59:29] church that's selfish
[59:32] love listen let me let me let me explain
[59:34] this friends everything that must be
[59:36] done must be done by the leadership of
[59:38] the Holy
[59:40] Spirit
[59:41] everything if if your application of the
[59:44] word is just simply letter you'll
[59:46] kill you'll kill it's got to be under
[59:50] his
[59:51] leadership because why the whole
[59:54] emphasis is is a that love from within
[59:57] to do what create an
[59:59] atmosphere are you with me the word
[1:00:02] spoken in the beginning in Genesis 1
[1:00:04] didn't create more Darkness it dismissed
[1:00:07] the darkness so the word had an
[1:00:09] atmosphere in it of love it was the word
[1:00:12] that was needed but it created an
[1:00:13] atmosphere and brought
[1:00:15] separation so when we're looking at it
[1:00:18] sure I mean you know if if I want my
[1:00:21] boys man I want my boys to always think
[1:00:23] hi me but see you're you're fa to
[1:00:25] recognize that they think high of you or
[1:00:27] your girls or whomever they think high
[1:00:29] of you if you stay true to them they
[1:00:32] know when they're wrong and you don't
[1:00:34] tell them when they're
[1:00:35] wrong they know when they're wrong and
[1:00:38] you don't correct
[1:00:42] them it brings
[1:00:45] confusion when something goes wrong in
[1:00:47] school and all of a sudden you're
[1:00:48] running up to the principal's office and
[1:00:50] you're ready to rake somebody over the
[1:00:51] coals I'm right down where you're living
[1:00:54] right
[1:00:55] you're taking their word for it and
[1:00:57] you're ready to go to
[1:00:59] judgment first of all you don't even
[1:01:01] understand the
[1:01:03] situation but before that you haven't
[1:01:05] even
[1:01:06] prayed because you're going in there
[1:01:08] failing to represent Jesus Christ in the
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:15] way you have to be mindful of all of
[1:01:18] these things listen friends listen all
[1:01:20] of us have been around I taught with
[1:01:21] different things I taught with different
[1:01:22] needs taught with Ser so forth even in
[1:01:24] the teaching of the school the examples
[1:01:26] I used for I used there were situations
[1:01:28] of things that you know I I I've seen
[1:01:31] wrong I understand that but it doesn't
[1:01:32] make all wrong right you understand it
[1:01:35] doesn't make all wrong this is where we
[1:01:37] need discernment if there's things that
[1:01:39] you have from your past where there's
[1:01:41] things that as far as discipline was
[1:01:43] taken to such a place to where you're
[1:01:45] like I'm not going there with
[1:01:48] spanking I'll just deal with the
[1:01:50] Tantrums and
[1:01:51] timeouts what you need to do listen is
[1:01:55] ask the Lord say Lord give me the
[1:01:57] discernment and help me Teach Me
[1:02:00] Lord because he's given his word he'll
[1:02:03] teach you right and I don't believe that
[1:02:05] ought to ever be something that stops
[1:02:09] right my my my so love itself it's like
[1:02:15] you have the have the boy in the middle
[1:02:17] of the street how many times the prophet
[1:02:18] give you that example the person
[1:02:19] standing in the middle of the street
[1:02:20] what do you run out there and say now
[1:02:22] darling you love daddy right you do
[1:02:25] right you're going to love Daddy after
[1:02:26] this pow they're
[1:02:30] gone but you go and pull them out of the
[1:02:32] middle of the street why do you do that
[1:02:35] why would you why would you grab them by
[1:02:36] the arm and pulling that way because you
[1:02:39] love
[1:02:40] them you love their
[1:02:44] life why would you see a boat headed to
[1:02:47] toward the Falls do you just say be
[1:02:49] careful you got your life jackets on
[1:02:50] it's a it's a it's a bad
[1:02:53] fall this isn't a right to CER point
[1:02:55] this is
[1:03:00] reality friend let me say this to you
[1:03:02] and I say this just from my heart I tell
[1:03:04] you right now with parenting and
[1:03:07] everything else it's one I don't want to
[1:03:09] say just hardest jobs but I'll say it's
[1:03:11] one of those you stay on your knees and
[1:03:13] I don't mean that in a bad way I'm
[1:03:14] saying you're dealing with hearts and
[1:03:16] lives that God has
[1:03:18] entrusted to your
[1:03:22] responsibility when God gave the plans
[1:03:24] to Noah Noah was
[1:03:27] responsible to pray over those plans
[1:03:30] I've said this before if you think Noah
[1:03:32] just for one moment if you think Noah
[1:03:35] just simply just walked out there with
[1:03:36] the pattern the plan said oh this goes
[1:03:38] here this goes here and we get this here
[1:03:39] we get this here you miss it how many
[1:03:42] times that Noah had to get down on his
[1:03:43] knees and pray so I don't read that in
[1:03:46] the scripture but he's a man God
[1:03:48] revealed himself to a
[1:03:51] man and he's trying he's looking to God
[1:03:54] to find direction yes how many times he
[1:03:57] had to move and asking God God how do I
[1:03:59] make this turn how do I make this corner
[1:04:01] how do I approach this see he had he had
[1:04:04] the pattern in front of him but he's
[1:04:05] looking to the one who gave the pattern
[1:04:07] to bring him in those places and
[1:04:08] Junctions of
[1:04:11] time so when we look at it look how many
[1:04:13] times that Paul would write in letters
[1:04:16] to the different
[1:04:17] churches when Paul would write to those
[1:04:20] churches whether it's
[1:04:22] Galatians thessalonica
[1:04:26] Corinth the Philippi all of those
[1:04:28] churches there are things that if in any
[1:04:31] way if you begin to compare those
[1:04:34] churches in any manner as saying they no
[1:04:36] way I go to the church of Corinth I go
[1:04:38] to the church of Ephesians yes sir the
[1:04:40] Ephesians were deeper they were so deep
[1:04:43] they didn't even know how to treat their
[1:04:44] wives
[1:04:46] woo
[1:04:48] woo come on
[1:04:50] somebody they don't get hung up with
[1:04:52] some one quote balance out the whole
[1:04:56] thing there was none of those churches
[1:04:58] that were
[1:05:01] perfect but in every one of them God
[1:05:04] loved them and God had a man on the
[1:05:07] scene who had a desire with God's love
[1:05:10] fervently burning in his heart for those
[1:05:15] people you had people that came into the
[1:05:17] church of Corinth they didn't care about
[1:05:19] nobody they wanted to try to bring
[1:05:21] Conformity to their own ways
[1:05:24] bringing disturbances in the church so
[1:05:26] Paul come right back in on election and
[1:05:28] laid it right out and let them know
[1:05:31] you're not justified by works you're
[1:05:34] justified by faith in
[1:05:36] Christ are you with me now if that is
[1:05:39] the reality what Paul is dealing with is
[1:05:41] that that faith will manifest itself in
[1:05:44] Godly works are you with me Ephesians
[1:05:46] 2:9 we are his workmanship created in
[1:05:49] Christ Jesus ordained under good works
[1:05:52] that's something that we're doing and
[1:05:53] forming out
[1:05:54] God already had placed it and swn it by
[1:05:57] election and under his presence it comes
[1:05:59] out what he's already placed there we're
[1:06:01] seeing a time where where where where
[1:06:03] plants are coming up the trees are
[1:06:05] blossoming the the apple trees have
[1:06:06] already had their blossoms and so forth
[1:06:08] and pretty soon they're going to have
[1:06:10] the apples which I'll be using for
[1:06:13] crisp but all of that every Apple that
[1:06:16] comes off that tree was in the little
[1:06:19] seed every leaf was in that
[1:06:23] seed
[1:06:24] what happened it had to come into the
[1:06:26] right atmosphere had to come into the
[1:06:28] ground have the right care and what does
[1:06:30] it do it is able to release what was
[1:06:34] already in
[1:06:37] it glory be to God that's what the
[1:06:39] presence of God does to a real child of
[1:06:42] God it releases who you really
[1:06:46] are amen it's unveiled who you really
[1:06:49] are and you begin to recognize I'm a son
[1:06:52] and daughter of God
[1:06:55] I'm not the Son and Daughter of whatever
[1:06:56] your parents name is I'm a Son of God
[1:06:58] I'm a daughter of
[1:07:03] God
[1:07:05] but without a word that comes forth to
[1:07:08] bring
[1:07:10] correction you keep
[1:07:13] going God in every generation when he
[1:07:17] sent his word his word has come with
[1:07:20] correction do all receive that word no
[1:07:24] many look at the word and say that's
[1:07:28] overboard Paul was just a woman hater or
[1:07:31] this and that it doesn't matter how you
[1:07:32] dress it doesn't matter with hair it
[1:07:34] doesn't M it
[1:07:36] doesn't the Bible says wh soever adds
[1:07:39] one word or taketh one away that isn't
[1:07:42] just cutting and pasting out the
[1:07:43] scriptures that's to that's to increase
[1:07:45] or deemphasize
[1:07:49] anything Hallelujah every word is yay
[1:07:52] and amen
[1:07:55] is that
[1:07:56] right so then when we look at it God
[1:08:00] sends a word of Correction why this is
[1:08:02] his discipline
[1:08:04] book but if God just doesn't give us a
[1:08:06] book and say okay you you'll be a good
[1:08:08] boy you'll be a good girl he's faithful
[1:08:12] because discipline is not being
[1:08:14] disconnected discipline is
[1:08:20] relationship you remember in the kingdom
[1:08:22] when David uh had to flee from Absalon
[1:08:26] you remember that yes and you remember
[1:08:29] how that that Absalon began to take
[1:08:31] counsel with the fitell remember that
[1:08:34] David zuk comes with David and David
[1:08:36] sends zuk he said go on back you go on
[1:08:39] back he said among there he said and he
[1:08:41] said perhaps he said that Absalon will
[1:08:43] hear
[1:08:45] you how in the world could David be
[1:08:48] confident in this because there
[1:08:50] evidently was a relationship that David
[1:08:53] did have with AB
[1:08:54] Absalon he knew him come on somebody he
[1:08:58] knew him or else he would have kept
[1:09:00] seducing his camp but he said go on back
[1:09:02] to him and it was the
[1:09:03] councel of zuk under the leading of the
[1:09:07] Lord that brought the defeat and brought
[1:09:10] David back
[1:09:11] in what was that it was a relationship
[1:09:14] David knew his child you understand
[1:09:17] that's why it's just like you know when
[1:09:19] you see things that take place within a
[1:09:21] church and and and I've learned I'll say
[1:09:24] I've learned I've learned to keep my
[1:09:25] mouth just shut when I look at other
[1:09:28] churches and look at other things like
[1:09:29] that cuz you know why it's not my
[1:09:30] problem that's right first of all I
[1:09:33] don't know those
[1:09:34] people but some you might have went and
[1:09:36] preached I don't that don't mean I know
[1:09:39] them God knows
[1:09:41] them so what I'm just saying within it
[1:09:44] is that I've recognized you know what it
[1:09:46] don't need my
[1:09:48] opinion here's people can look at things
[1:09:50] with this church or another church and
[1:09:52] say you know you should have done this
[1:09:54] you should have done that but do you
[1:09:56] know the hearts of the
[1:09:58] people see as the shepherd I know your
[1:10:01] hearts oh I know
[1:10:06] you that don't mean I'm going to be
[1:10:08] light on
[1:10:12] you but you understand it's like walking
[1:10:14] into a midst like when I went other
[1:10:16] places and I'm I'm there in a midst of
[1:10:18] other young people besides our young
[1:10:19] people I don't know those young people I
[1:10:22] might see certain things but I don't
[1:10:24] know their heart behind it what's going
[1:10:25] on I don't know so I have to wait and it
[1:10:29] might not even be something I say it
[1:10:31] might just be something if God's dealing
[1:10:32] with my heart God's telling me you be an
[1:10:33] image right now you with me it isn't
[1:10:36] only something you need to say it's be
[1:10:38] an image because if what you're saying
[1:10:39] you're not an image too it's
[1:10:43] hypocritical it must be image a durable
[1:10:46] substance behind it is that right what
[1:10:50] brings a reality within this word that
[1:10:52] God has sent is a life that is behind
[1:10:54] it it's a spirit that is behind it a
[1:10:57] real true Spirit of Christ that
[1:10:59] correction notice here in the scriptures
[1:11:02] uh where where it speaks in Proverbs
[1:11:04] 29:15 the rod and reproof give
[1:11:10] wisdom my belt has no wisdom in
[1:11:13] it Rod however you want it it has no
[1:11:16] wisdom how does it give wisdom there
[1:11:19] must be wisdom behind it
[1:11:25] that's why how does the word when the
[1:11:27] word is coming and there's correction
[1:11:29] coming how does the word bring wisdom
[1:11:32] into a person's life first we have to
[1:11:34] receive it but there must be wisdom in
[1:11:36] the administering of
[1:11:39] it
[1:11:42] wisdom wisdom for what wisdom so that
[1:11:45] the way is corrected and straightened
[1:11:47] out is that
[1:11:49] right I mean I don't know about you I
[1:11:51] don't want to keep getting whooped on
[1:11:52] the same thing yall I want to I don't
[1:11:55] want to I don't want it to be like where
[1:11:57] you show up the school and say come on I
[1:11:58] didn't know I know where you're going
[1:11:59] let's get on into this room right in
[1:12:00] here we'll go ahead and whoop you for
[1:12:01] the Day get started boy I don't want to
[1:12:04] get I don't want to keep getting whooped
[1:12:05] for the same thing why that's not
[1:12:07] glorious to my
[1:12:09] father what is Glory is that what he is
[1:12:12] doing it now comes out in my
[1:12:19] life it giveth wisdom look at this in
[1:12:21] verse 15 a Child Left to himself
[1:12:25] bringeth his mother to
[1:12:28] shame a Child Left to himself yes they
[1:12:33] don't come
[1:12:34] pre-programmed y'all know that right
[1:12:36] that's right I mean your phones might
[1:12:38] come programmed but your children
[1:12:40] don't and even as children of God having
[1:12:43] the seed of God within us and the spirit
[1:12:46] of God coming and quickened our lives it
[1:12:48] isn't that it's just
[1:12:51] automatic that's why you say well all
[1:12:53] the virtues are in me when I'm born of
[1:12:55] the spirit of God I'm brother Samuel I
[1:12:57] am a statue of a perfect man correction
[1:13:00] you're coming to
[1:13:04] it otherwise as the prophet said after
[1:13:07] you're born again you must these things
[1:13:10] must be born in you of the spirit of God
[1:13:12] otherwise you are adding peacock
[1:13:15] feathers you're putting feathers in so
[1:13:18] what must it be the nourishing the
[1:13:20] tutorship of the Holy Spirit as our
[1:13:23] brother prayed in the opening prayer
[1:13:25] Lord You Are The Potter we are the
[1:13:28] clay it's his molding it's his shaping
[1:13:31] it's his working in our
[1:13:34] lives so we need that's why Peter said
[1:13:37] as I was referring to those virtues
[1:13:39] that's why Peter could say in in 1 Peter
[1:13:41] chapter 2 I believe where it's at Peter
[1:13:43] could say while I am with
[1:13:45] you it is needful for me to stir up your
[1:13:49] pure Mind by way of remembrance that
[1:13:52] these things would abound in
[1:13:54] you so you mean just because I know it
[1:13:57] is not enough no remember the word is
[1:13:59] not just word that's being spoken when
[1:14:02] God speaks it's the spirit of God taking
[1:14:05] that word and it's God himself bringing
[1:14:09] release just as Genesis you recognize
[1:14:12] that each every service and the times
[1:14:14] the Junctions of times that we sat in
[1:14:16] it's the same holy spirit is saying let
[1:14:19] there be let there be let there be let
[1:14:21] there be it isn't things that all of a
[1:14:24] sudden just come come wow right after
[1:14:26] that service right there it is no what
[1:14:28] does he do a word of Correction shows
[1:14:30] you where you are and me and it shows us
[1:14:33] where we need to be but all of the all
[1:14:36] of the results of where we need to be
[1:14:38] relies on our heart whether it will
[1:14:40] receive
[1:14:41] it and our hearts receive it brother I
[1:14:44] have that virtue in me yes but you have
[1:14:46] to let go and let it come
[1:14:48] out let God bring it out of
[1:14:52] you amen yes
[1:14:55] sir a Child Left to himself you see this
[1:14:57] is where look in the in the Book of
[1:14:59] Revelations chapter
[1:15:02] 3 the Bible says concerning this time
[1:15:05] this
[1:15:07] age Jesus said behold I stand at the
[1:15:09] door and I
[1:15:11] knock If any man will hear my voice let
[1:15:15] him open the
[1:15:16] door I will come in unto
[1:15:20] him and I will s with him and he with
[1:15:26] me you say how could he s with me he's
[1:15:29] partaking of the word that he's already
[1:15:37] soon but he's knocking knocking is
[1:15:41] individually he's put out of his
[1:15:44] church listen friends having the Bible
[1:15:47] having some somebody just take a text
[1:15:49] out of the Bible doesn't mean that
[1:15:50] Christ is in the
[1:15:52] church is he preeminent is he welcome
[1:15:56] because he is the
[1:15:58] word he is the all of
[1:16:02] it is that right without
[1:16:06] him this is where it's at a Child Left
[1:16:09] to himself look where things are I ask
[1:16:11] you look where things are there are
[1:16:14] things that churches would never have
[1:16:16] dreamed of allowing and
[1:16:18] permitting but look at them now proven
[1:16:21] the homosexual agender approving all
[1:16:24] these other things making excuses you
[1:16:26] know why they don't have access to the
[1:16:29] power of the
[1:16:31] atonement that's why they have to find a
[1:16:33] way to compromise with
[1:16:36] sin because they don't have access to
[1:16:38] the blood hallah the way they view the
[1:16:42] blood is like cover me and I can keep on
[1:16:44] living the way I'm living that's not a
[1:16:47] blood
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:50] covering the blood has the life and and
[1:16:53] the blood as Paul said speaketh better
[1:16:58] things this blood has a
[1:17:01] voice this Blood Revelations 1 it is a
[1:17:05] blood that brings a perfect
[1:17:09] loosening where you are no longer
[1:17:12] identified with who you are you are
[1:17:14] identified with who God knew you to
[1:17:19] be so you're no longer bound you are God
[1:17:23] God's free man God's free woman born of
[1:17:25] his Spirit born in the house of his
[1:17:30] word and he corrects us his
[1:17:34] children well don't don't stop rejoicing
[1:17:36] you ought to make that Rejoice even more
[1:17:39] as many as I
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:45] love Now understand if every time you
[1:17:49] came to
[1:17:50] church that was the that was was the
[1:17:53] thing every time where
[1:17:55] it's there's no
[1:17:57] growth that's why the prophet tells us
[1:17:59] in the adoption series they said you
[1:18:00] legalist Brothers keep the people tore
[1:18:03] up that's where he said after the
[1:18:05] preaching you need teaching to come in
[1:18:07] and stabilize the
[1:18:09] people God doesn't want you tore up I
[1:18:12] don't know about God Wants You
[1:18:15] stabilized and I'm glad that not only
[1:18:18] that that that he has done it that he's
[1:18:19] doing it that he will do it I'm grateful
[1:18:21] because if God takes me off the seat
[1:18:23] tomorrow it'll
[1:18:24] continue because it's his
[1:18:29] work amen don't you love
[1:18:37] himo well out of a 15 o steak we got
[1:18:39] about 12 ounces

[1:19:04] we focus is on that word correct you
[1:19:06] miss it thy son
[1:19:11] relationship
[1:19:13] relationship he corrects his own is that
[1:19:16] right in Proverbs and Hebrews 12 those
[1:19:19] who refuse it God says they're not mine
[1:19:22] cuz his children will refuse his they
[1:19:24] they his children receive his correction
[1:19:27] right they come out of confusion and
[1:19:29] what is it his children we as children
[1:19:31] we begin to hear the word ooo it's
[1:19:33] cutting o o that cuts but what is it
[1:19:37] boundaries oh my what is it it brings
[1:19:41] strength it brings security as God
[1:19:43] himself is coming and is Mindful and
[1:19:45] he's steading up and let you you and I
[1:19:47] know my boundaries have never
[1:19:50] changed
[1:19:51] hallu
[1:19:53] so relationship and he shall give thee
[1:19:56] rest correct th son and he shall give
[1:19:58] thee
[1:19:59] rest what's that mean brother Samuel
[1:20:02] well correcting then when it comes to
[1:20:04] other places you don't have to be on on
[1:20:07] edge I wonder if he's going to act I
[1:20:09] want oh Lord oh my we we oh my we better
[1:20:12] not go I I tell you I I don't know you
[1:20:15] don't have rest
[1:20:17] right that right you know I've said this
[1:20:20] before and and I I don't mean this
[1:20:22] anything to be funny but it's a truth
[1:20:25] you if they walk on the couches at
[1:20:28] home what do you think they're going to
[1:20:30] do on a church
[1:20:33] pew oh no they ought to know that's the
[1:20:35] house of God no that's your
[1:20:38] responsibility because see what's
[1:20:39] happening is your boundaries are not
[1:20:42] consistent well brother s that's just
[1:20:44] the couch who blessed you with
[1:20:48] it who's is
[1:20:51] that oh my God has allowed you to have
[1:20:57] it so you to honor the Lord in every
[1:21:01] thing but's see you want to have don't
[1:21:03] you want to have
[1:21:04] rest it's like how brother B tells us he
[1:21:07] said that every once in a while he said
[1:21:08] that the pastor has to hold down you
[1:21:10] know the the the the children he said
[1:21:12] like like a father a good father has to
[1:21:14] hold it down what it means to hold it
[1:21:15] down you want to get away come on
[1:21:17] friends no one of you line up and say I
[1:21:19] take it's a
[1:21:20] pinkin we didn't even do that when we
[1:21:22] growing up now you may not you may maybe
[1:21:25] didn't run cuz you knew you want to get
[1:21:26] away but the reality of it is is that
[1:21:29] you weren't lining up for it and saying
[1:21:30] please give me a whipping I need a
[1:21:32] spanking I need privileges removed you
[1:21:36] weren't because there was wisdom that
[1:21:39] knew what wisdom you
[1:21:41] needed the wisdom that was needed was
[1:21:44] not the spanking it was the wisdom that
[1:21:47] came through from the father the mother
[1:21:49] seeing the condition that if I don't get
[1:21:51] this corrected this this is what he end
[1:21:53] up being or she'll end up being later on
[1:21:54] down the line why because true
[1:21:57] discipline is with a vision the
[1:22:01] subject's amendment is in mind it's not
[1:22:04] just temporary look God is disciplining
[1:22:06] you and I why because we are to dwell in
[1:22:10] the future
[1:22:12] home and the Order of the home is the
[1:22:15] order of the family who dwells in it so
[1:22:18] God says they're my
[1:22:19] responsibility these are my youngs
[1:22:23] I'll correct
[1:22:26] them I know your flesh and my flesh we
[1:22:30] don't like correction but this on the
[1:22:31] inside says Thank You
[1:22:34] Lord thank you
[1:22:36] Lord is that right so here that
[1:22:40] relationship is gaining that heart and
[1:22:43] it's gaining the heart now listen to me
[1:22:45] now it's gaining the heart but in
[1:22:47] gaining the heart it's gaining favor but
[1:22:50] it's favor without compromise
[1:22:55] the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 2 that
[1:22:58] he took upon himself Flesh and Blood
[1:23:03] because why the children we the children
[1:23:05] were partakers of it his condensation
[1:23:08] and becoming one of us to redeem us
[1:23:11] through the shedding of his blood but
[1:23:13] that he also might be a merciful and
[1:23:15] faithful high
[1:23:17] priest are you with me so it's not
[1:23:19] things where you're coming to him and
[1:23:21] saying Lord you know I this is I'm
[1:23:24] tempted or Lord forgive me Lord in this
[1:23:26] or Lord he doesn't
[1:23:28] say that's not how he
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:31] moves he knows what fear is all about
[1:23:35] Hebrews 5:7 he was heard with strong
[1:23:38] tears and crying in that he
[1:23:40] feared he knows what it is when the
[1:23:44] flesh doesn't want to yield but the
[1:23:47] inner man says I want
[1:23:49] to he prayed three times father if it's
[1:23:52] possible possible let this cup pass from
[1:23:57] me Lord why don't you answer all my
[1:23:59] prayers aren't you thankful those
[1:24:01] prayers weren't
[1:24:04] answered sometimes he doesn't answer the
[1:24:07] prayers it depends on where it's coming
[1:24:09] from where it's going to right but he
[1:24:12] had a full
[1:24:14] experience this is how God this is why
[1:24:17] the prophet could say than 18-year-old
[1:24:19] thoughts well sometimes that's hard not
[1:24:23] because you're so old it's it's hard
[1:24:25] because you have to try to think back
[1:24:27] how was that thinking you can't think of
[1:24:29] it as terms of a mature person who is 50
[1:24:32] 48 whatever and and 30 something and
[1:24:34] looking back on and saying come on can't
[1:24:37] no
[1:24:39] no it's working to bring that coming
[1:24:41] back to relate to all that just like all
[1:24:43] the things that you know they go through
[1:24:45] within their teenagers little things
[1:24:46] that embarrass them that you know you
[1:24:48] now I mean you don't care you come to
[1:24:50] church with ketchup stain on your shirt
[1:24:51] you don't bother
[1:24:53] you you understand now some of you won't
[1:24:57] you'll get there
[1:25:00] someday but you understand what I'm
[1:25:02] saying there's things that that mattered
[1:25:04] to you
[1:25:06] before yes it's being considered of that
[1:25:11] now it takes God this is not this is not
[1:25:14] something we just read and okay no no it
[1:25:16] takes the Lord it takes a lot of prayer
[1:25:18] this is like Noah Lord help me on the
[1:25:19] ark takes a lot of prayer so all of how
[1:25:23] that the Lord moves when all this you
[1:25:25] see this is where that even when we're
[1:25:28] looking at applying the scripture we
[1:25:31] must apply the word in
[1:25:34] faith we must now just a few
[1:25:42] moments in looking at how that
[1:25:44] God directs our
[1:25:47] attention with these things that even
[1:25:49] when we look at in Matthew chapter 18 if
[1:25:51] I can go go back to that just for a
[1:25:53] moment and let me just refer to a few
[1:25:55] points because where I want to move to
[1:25:57] is go into what Paul himself gives ad
[1:26:00] admonition to the people of God which is
[1:26:03] a part of discipline even in a home
[1:26:06] Church on and on it's all part of
[1:26:11] it Paul deals with this I for sake of
[1:26:13] time I'm just going to reference it
[1:26:15] it'll be in the notes but if you want to
[1:26:17] look at it in in your Bibles while I'm
[1:26:19] going through it you can it's Matthew
[1:26:20] 18:15 I know it's on the screen but I
[1:26:22] don't want to read every word this is
[1:26:25] dealing with discipline in the
[1:26:28] church if there's a brother that had
[1:26:30] trespassed against
[1:26:32] thee the Bible says you wait on him to
[1:26:36] text you and arrange a
[1:26:42] meeting it didn't say
[1:26:44] that if your brother has trespassed
[1:26:46] against you you go to
[1:26:50] him are you with me
[1:26:53] you go to
[1:26:56] him this with with with not moving
[1:27:00] within that it allows cancer to start
[1:27:05] growing one cancer breeds another cancer
[1:27:08] breeds another cancer and eventually
[1:27:10] people are wondering and saying wonder
[1:27:12] where the spirit of God is wonder where
[1:27:14] the Holy Ghost is wonder where the Lord
[1:27:16] is it's our
[1:27:19] responsibility you with me I've got the
[1:27:21] quotes I've just going to read them
[1:27:23] because I just want to refer to
[1:27:25] it so it's it's necessary and and here's
[1:27:28] the other part it's necessary when the
[1:27:31] Lord Jesus is looking at this here and
[1:27:33] giving this direction to the
[1:27:36] church that as he goes through it he
[1:27:39] says if he hear thee thou H has gained
[1:27:42] thy
[1:27:43] brother well wasn't he my brother before
[1:27:46] he was but that thing that was done was
[1:27:49] serving as a
[1:27:51] separation
[1:27:54] I hope I'm speaking to people that have
[1:27:55] heart of reconciliation this
[1:27:58] morning I hope you're understanding me
[1:28:01] Ephesians 5 if you read Ephesians 5 and
[1:28:03] you leave Ephesians 5 as just a
[1:28:05] scripture between husband and wife and
[1:28:07] say well as the H as Christ so loved the
[1:28:09] church so should the husband loved their
[1:28:10] wives as he gave and you read it in just
[1:28:12] that terms and you fail to recognize if
[1:28:15] Christ is your husband and his spirit is
[1:28:17] in you and you're part of his body then
[1:28:19] you nourish and cherish his body
[1:28:23] are you with me it has to be applied
[1:28:25] across the board no man having been born
[1:28:29] of the spirit of God call it Jesus a
[1:28:31] curse no man being filled with the
[1:28:32] spirit of God comes against his body is
[1:28:35] that right Ephesians 5 no man ever yet
[1:28:37] hated his own
[1:28:40] flesh but this is where God has to deal
[1:28:43] with our hearts to help us to see at
[1:28:46] times and say if I can refer back to
[1:28:48] Thursday's message get out of the
[1:28:49] ordinary and come back into into the
[1:28:51] greatness
[1:28:53] am that's not that's listen friends
[1:28:55] that's not an excuse to
[1:28:56] sin that's not an excuse to sin some
[1:28:59] people get nervous on those things I
[1:29:00] didn't make I didn't put the word I
[1:29:01] didn't I didn't write the book of Romans
[1:29:03] but I know the reality is when God is in
[1:29:05] Your Heart by the love of Jesus Christ
[1:29:07] you don't desire to do
[1:29:08] wrong are you with
[1:29:16] me hear many times of the brother
[1:29:18] brother Ram says over and over in the
[1:29:19] adoption Series in the Hebrew series he
[1:29:21] said now I know my legalist people that
[1:29:22] are sitting here he said many of you are
[1:29:24] legal he said this troubles you when I
[1:29:26] preach on these things it's true why
[1:29:29] it's a wrong slant it's as though you
[1:29:32] put the you through your works you put
[1:29:33] yourself in you don't put yourself in by
[1:29:35] your own Works neither do we look at
[1:29:38] because that's Armenian ISM neither do
[1:29:39] we look at Calvinism well once in Grace
[1:29:41] always in in Grace that's
[1:29:43] disgrace we believe that as long as that
[1:29:46] life is inside of you because the life
[1:29:49] inside of you will keep you in the
[1:29:51] boundaries of the
[1:29:56] word you love
[1:29:59] him if he doesn't hear you then take
[1:30:03] with thee one or two more that in the
[1:30:04] mouth of two or three Witnesses every
[1:30:06] word may be
[1:30:08] established if he neglect to hear them
[1:30:10] tell it unto the church and if he
[1:30:12] neglect to hear the church let him be
[1:30:13] unto thee as a heathen man and a
[1:30:15] Publican I I I'm going through these
[1:30:17] things today because this
[1:30:19] is well first of all this is where God
[1:30:21] had led me and we started into it last
[1:30:23] week I'm going I'm I'm going further
[1:30:25] into it because we need this
[1:30:38] teaching because to see this in the
[1:30:42] right
[1:30:43] light
[1:30:45] where four four stages here first you go
[1:30:50] personally to the brother the sister if
[1:30:53] that's not then you take one or two more
[1:30:55] with you it didn't now let me be very
[1:30:58] clear in here it didn't say call the
[1:31:02] pastor preach thank
[1:31:08] you text the pastor no they didn't say
[1:31:11] that this is our this is the body of
[1:31:14] Jesus Christ you're a part of it just as
[1:31:17] in the Tabernacle in the wilderness they
[1:31:19] camped on this side this side this this
[1:31:22] side they protected anything that tried
[1:31:24] to come into the camp when the spirit of
[1:31:27] God is dwelling inside of you you are
[1:31:29] there to protect the working of the holy
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:35] spirit it's even like in your own home
[1:31:37] you're there to protect
[1:31:42] it this is where the scripture says I I
[1:31:46] want to deal with that last little part
[1:31:47] in verse 17 so we have an understanding
[1:31:49] of it he neglected here the church let
[1:31:51] him be unto thee as is a heathen man and
[1:31:52] a Publican in verse 18 whatsoever you
[1:31:55] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:31:57] and whatsoever you loose on Earth shall
[1:31:58] be loosed in heaven this is loosening
[1:32:00] from under the protection of the blood
[1:32:02] because what is it it's sin allowing to
[1:32:05] go on being tolerated instead of it
[1:32:07] being addressed listen to me very
[1:32:09] carefully now when Paul I read to you
[1:32:11] out of 1 Corinthians 5 when Paul spoke
[1:32:13] concerning that young man and what he
[1:32:15] was doing in living with his uh uh
[1:32:17] stepmother what did Paul say If any man
[1:32:20] be caught as a brother and all of these
[1:32:22] things are going on drunken whether it's
[1:32:23] a drunken a extortion or what you
[1:32:25] know what a
[1:32:27] is woo there some might running their
[1:32:35] mouth you see you have privileged to
[1:32:37] your own opinion but you're not a
[1:32:38] privilege to go around the church and
[1:32:40] spread
[1:32:42] it no sir this is part of a body we're a
[1:32:46] body of Believers you don't want to
[1:32:49] injure you want to try to protect you
[1:32:51] want to try to protect one another's
[1:32:55] testimony why I am My Brother's
[1:32:59] Keeper that doesn't mean I'm going to
[1:33:00] let him get by with things but it means
[1:33:03] that I'm going to also pray if I see
[1:33:05] something and I want to be moved by the
[1:33:14] Lord loose from under the protection why
[1:33:17] that God can't deal with them because
[1:33:19] we're praying for him holding them up in
[1:33:20] protection you know brother deal with
[1:33:22] the one situation in in in Hebrew series
[1:33:24] and I just got to reading over this the
[1:33:25] last week and I thought wow you know
[1:33:27] sometimes you read over things and I
[1:33:28] just I hadn't caught it before but there
[1:33:30] was a situation where an individual they
[1:33:34] brother BR talked about walking right
[1:33:35] out of the service and he said just
[1:33:37] walked off the platform and and these
[1:33:38] people were saying oh what a wonderful
[1:33:39] service what a wonderful time and he
[1:33:41] goes out in the parking lot and he
[1:33:42] overhears this other individual and this
[1:33:44] other person is saying that guyin
[1:33:45] nothing but an impostor brother B said
[1:33:47] what it was he said it was one who had
[1:33:49] backslid from the church now listen to
[1:33:51] to me carefully now one who had backslid
[1:33:54] from the church he said and had started
[1:33:56] running down the church and what we
[1:34:01] believe they had not went to another
[1:34:03] assembly yet I hope you're hearing
[1:34:06] me they hadn't went to another assembly
[1:34:09] they were still identified with falling
[1:34:11] from that
[1:34:13] assembly and brother Brown said he got
[1:34:15] up and he took the text they went out
[1:34:17] from us because they were not of
[1:34:19] us and then they went to him one went to
[1:34:22] them then two went these scriptures I
[1:34:24] just read to you they wouldn't come So
[1:34:27] eventually they loosed them from under
[1:34:29] the protection of the
[1:34:31] blood but Samuel did they ever return I
[1:34:35] don't
[1:34:36] know but this is what I'm trying to tell
[1:34:38] you if someone leaves here and they go
[1:34:41] to another church and then in that other
[1:34:44] Church they start running this down that
[1:34:46] scripture does not apply to that
[1:34:49] situation I hope somebody's hearing me
[1:34:52] some of you local know exactly where I'm
[1:34:55] at that does not apply in that
[1:34:58] manner see that's why it's
[1:35:01] important you're not giving your
[1:35:04] opinion when you don't know the full
[1:35:08] situation well whose responsibility the
[1:35:11] other assembly if God leads them to do
[1:35:13] it that
[1:35:14] way but let me just say this very clear
[1:35:17] so you understand it if you ever feel
[1:35:19] led you say brother Samuel I I just
[1:35:21] can't I can't come here anymore you know
[1:35:23] what God bless you I love you that
[1:35:27] doesn't apply here you might we might
[1:35:30] see things differently there might be
[1:35:31] different things but you know what let's
[1:35:33] go on for the Lord if you feel led to go
[1:35:35] somewhere else go somewhere else just go
[1:35:38] in the name of Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ amen just go and keep keep the
[1:35:42] opinions keep all those things don't go
[1:35:44] somewhere else and start spreading all
[1:35:45] of the
[1:35:47] negativity you understand don't go
[1:35:49] somewhere else just go on and say Lord
[1:35:51] cleanse
[1:35:55] everything this I thought this is
[1:35:57] perfect Church you thought
[1:35:59] wrong ain't nobody perfect including
[1:36:03] you just case you didn't know just want
[1:36:05] to remind
[1:36:09] you but God did send a gospel to perfect
[1:36:14] us hallelujah where does that Perfection
[1:36:17] begin in our soul and then God has
[1:36:20] Ministry and uned under that same
[1:36:22] Revelation to do what for the perfecting
[1:36:25] but that's not the same perfecting as
[1:36:26] the Perfection of your soul that
[1:36:28] perfecting is a thorough
[1:36:30] Furnishing which is what how many of you
[1:36:32] would want a house and you well look at
[1:36:34] the house I have and somebody where we
[1:36:35] sit down at oh I don't have no furniture
[1:36:37] how sad how sad you want to have
[1:36:40] furniture to set
[1:36:47] on remember Kim and I first got Sister
[1:36:50] Kim and I first got married hey we were
[1:36:51] happy to have the house we had we had
[1:36:53] them plastic lawn chairs man them things
[1:36:55] were like lazy boys to us we were just
[1:36:57] so
[1:37:00] happy it's true we were
[1:37:03] happy you know he had to hand me down
[1:37:05] tables and everything else but praise
[1:37:07] God we were happy I thank God for it I'm
[1:37:09] serious thank God for
[1:37:11] it this these two terms Heathen and
[1:37:14] Publican just so you understand it when
[1:37:17] it talks about the loosening from under
[1:37:18] the
[1:37:19] blood the Bible deals with that this is
[1:37:22] how that he is to be unto
[1:37:25] thee wow that's that's a that's a
[1:37:27] tremendous thing if it may made it if if
[1:37:30] things make it to a place of loosening
[1:37:31] of the blood but it's not to be looked
[1:37:32] at like oh no this is God's discipline
[1:37:35] but this is how God says this is how it
[1:37:37] is to be unto thee y'all believe this is
[1:37:40] a
[1:37:43] word this is how now notice this is
[1:37:46] where it takes the discernment of the
[1:37:48] spirit of God Paul says in 1 Corinthians
[1:37:51] 5 I was referring to moments ago Paul
[1:37:53] said put that Wicked one away from among
[1:37:56] you now listen to me this is where it
[1:37:58] takes discernment why is Paul saying
[1:38:00] Wicked he's talking about the
[1:38:06] spirit I I'm going to get to in just a
[1:38:08] moment Paul was dealing with the spirit
[1:38:10] that's where you have to have
[1:38:12] discernment and discernment does what
[1:38:14] that's why discernment with the
[1:38:16] correction it drives away foolishness
[1:38:18] that's Bound in the heart aren't you
[1:38:20] glad that God didn't destroy you the new
[1:38:22] birth does not annihilate you come on
[1:38:25] paramia what does it do the new birth
[1:38:28] does what you are A New Creation in the
[1:38:31] same old
[1:38:34] Temple is that
[1:38:36] right so when we look at then the
[1:38:38] scripture says let him be unto thee as a
[1:38:41] heathen and a Publican the word heathen
[1:38:44] if you think of heathen when you look at
[1:38:46] it we we have a real true worship is to
[1:38:51] be in our lives of the Living God see
[1:38:54] what what is heathenism heathenism where
[1:38:57] they don't believe it doesn't believe in
[1:38:58] the Living God the Living God dwelling
[1:39:00] in
[1:39:01] you it's going somewhere he's here in
[1:39:04] this Temple he's here in this Temple
[1:39:05] he's here in this Temple no but you
[1:39:06] recognize you are a temple of the Holy
[1:39:10] Ghost you conduct your life as a son and
[1:39:12] daughter of God see that's why it says
[1:39:15] he he's not conducting himself in the
[1:39:17] right way he refused all to hear all
[1:39:19] this that's what it says he's to be unto
[1:39:20] you as a heathen is he still a brother
[1:39:22] would they still be a sister yes but
[1:39:25] this is how they are to be unto
[1:39:28] you that that takes the real love of God
[1:39:32] the word Publican here uh just in my
[1:39:35] just just for me referencing it to you
[1:39:37] this word Publican this is God was
[1:39:39] dealing drawing their attention to how
[1:39:41] that tax collectors were detested not
[1:39:45] just by Jews they were detested by other
[1:39:49] nations they were remember hey you
[1:39:51] remember what what when when when God
[1:39:53] went over to uh U is it Matthew's house
[1:39:57] is it Ma who is the text ler Matthew or
[1:40:00] Andrew Matthew
[1:40:03] okay I'm sorry but we're gonna get the
[1:40:07] point okay Matthew we're going to get
[1:40:09] the
[1:40:14] point Matthew was regarded not you
[1:40:17] Matthew but Matthew was regarded as not
[1:40:20] a real
[1:40:22] great
[1:40:23] guy his own family looked at him with
[1:40:27] detest this is what Publican is because
[1:40:30] they detested them because they were
[1:40:32] harsh deceptive and
[1:40:34] greedy this is how God said is to look
[1:40:37] at it what was it about it's about the
[1:40:39] body because in all of these matters
[1:40:41] right here and which says be unto thee
[1:40:42] as a heathen and Publican is talking
[1:40:44] about their
[1:40:45] actions what were their actions actions
[1:40:47] that were injurious to the body if it's
[1:40:50] it's injurious to the body it's
[1:40:52] injurious to the Holy
[1:40:56] Spirit oh
[1:40:59] my can I have a few more
[1:41:04] minutes 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[1:41:06] one I do want to read this to
[1:41:09] you my I you know brother brother
[1:41:12] Jerry's coming in here next
[1:41:15] week yes
[1:41:19] sir I know how you feel I always liked
[1:41:21] it when you know when when family came
[1:41:24] in after you got correction it always
[1:41:26] felt
[1:41:30] good no I know you're we certainly love
[1:41:34] brother Jerry and I know you all have
[1:41:36] been looking forward to that the Lord
[1:41:39] willing next Sunday he'll be
[1:41:42] here verse one and what I want you to
[1:41:44] look at here this is
[1:41:49] Paul after the people of God responded
[1:41:53] to the
[1:41:54] word and this is Paul speaking if I can
[1:41:59] say it like this to his children he's
[1:42:02] speaking even giving them guidance
[1:42:05] because look look guidance is not just
[1:42:08] guidance here was not Paul just saying
[1:42:11] do this no but there's the guidance is
[1:42:13] is that after in the
[1:42:16] restoring so what's what how Paul will
[1:42:19] do this let me just say kind of like
[1:42:20] this it's like this after the correction
[1:42:23] and everything is done it's just like
[1:42:24] when you have corrected your
[1:42:26] children you don't just have such a
[1:42:29] great distance and everything like that
[1:42:31] you let them know I love
[1:42:35] you I know they don't understand it I
[1:42:38] didn't understand it when my dad said
[1:42:40] this is going to hurt me worse than hurt
[1:42:41] you I never understood that I understand
[1:42:44] it now I'll tell you that much I
[1:42:47] understand
[1:42:48] that I told you last week there's times
[1:42:50] I've CRI cried I've cried right along
[1:42:53] with him but that crying has never made
[1:42:56] me to look back and say oh no I
[1:42:58] shouldn't have done this or shouldn't no
[1:42:59] no I know what's taking place but I can
[1:43:02] sit right there with them and say I love
[1:43:05] you I know you may not understand it but
[1:43:08] Daddy can't let you go this way I love
[1:43:13] you that didn't mean that all of a
[1:43:15] sudden I slip out you know within that
[1:43:16] week that that day and I'm thinking oh I
[1:43:18] feel so bad I got to go back and I say
[1:43:20] Paul
[1:43:21] do you love
[1:43:22] daddy do you still love daddy do you
[1:43:26] have flowery thoughts of daddy do you
[1:43:28] still think well of that you know what
[1:43:30] I'm doing I'm undoing all that was
[1:43:44] done Benjamin you're lucky you're back
[1:43:46] there not up
[1:43:49] here
[1:43:57] verse
[1:43:58] one but I determined this with
[1:44:01] myself that I would not come again to
[1:44:04] you in
[1:44:06] heaviness for if I make you
[1:44:08] sorry who is he then that maketh me
[1:44:11] glad but the same which is made Sorry by
[1:44:15] me now Paul the motive is Right Paul
[1:44:18] within this he's not saying I don't I
[1:44:20] don't want to make you sad because I
[1:44:21] always want to be happy that would have
[1:44:22] been selfishness right but Paul is
[1:44:25] letting it be known his motive and
[1:44:27] objective within it is that he would
[1:44:29] actually be able to receive Joy
[1:44:32] emanating out of their
[1:44:35] lives and I wrote this same unto you
[1:44:38] lest when I came I should have sorrow
[1:44:41] from them of whom I ought to Rejoice
[1:44:45] having confidence in you all that my joy
[1:44:48] is the joy of you all now notice he's
[1:44:51] talking about the writing this writing
[1:44:52] of correction that we read in 1
[1:44:54] Corinthians 5 he's talking about this
[1:44:55] letter he said when I lest when I came I
[1:44:58] should have sorrow from them of whom I
[1:45:00] ought to Rejoice so Paul is dealing with
[1:45:02] this if I had Paul said if this which
[1:45:04] has been reported to me if it had not
[1:45:07] been addressed then when I came among
[1:45:09] you all I would have
[1:45:11] sorrowed because I would have seen the
[1:45:14] condition of where things
[1:45:16] were but remember he being absent but
[1:45:19] yet present in the Spirit had already
[1:45:22] judged how could he judge by character
[1:45:24] of
[1:45:25] Christ now notice this in verse four for
[1:45:28] out of much Affliction and anguish of
[1:45:31] heart I wrote unto you with many
[1:45:35] tears I wonder within Paul's writing how
[1:45:38] many of the words might have been
[1:45:40] smudged from
[1:45:42] tears because when Paul wrote and told
[1:45:44] him what to do Paul's love was for the
[1:45:47] whole
[1:45:48] assembly he was not right in it that I
[1:45:51] tell you that that guy he hit no that
[1:45:53] let just no that F no it was out of
[1:45:57] Anguish out of
[1:45:58] love that he
[1:46:02] wrote not that you should be grieved
[1:46:05] notice the purpose of the discipline is
[1:46:07] not that you should be
[1:46:09] grieved but that you might know the love
[1:46:13] which I have more
[1:46:14] abundantly unto you what's Paul
[1:46:18] uncovering this has been the motive
[1:46:20] behind me
[1:46:22] it verse
[1:46:24] five if any have caused grief he hath
[1:46:27] not grieved me but in part that I may
[1:46:31] not overcharge you sufficient to such a
[1:46:35] man is this punishment which was
[1:46:38] inflicted of many now
[1:46:41] remember because the blood had been
[1:46:43] loosed they were at the final step Paul
[1:46:45] had admonished him don't even keep
[1:46:47] company with them and that's when they
[1:46:48] had went to the last step
[1:46:50] you hear me you know Paul in first
[1:46:53] Thessalonians when he deals with he uses
[1:46:55] the term Busy
[1:47:00] Body Busy Body he says you seen how we
[1:47:04] were among you we labored among you he
[1:47:09] said so as we said before he that does
[1:47:11] not work he doesn't
[1:47:14] eat wow that's the love of
[1:47:16] God really if he doesn't work he doesn't
[1:47:20] NE we'll say that for another
[1:47:23] time but Paul
[1:47:25] dealt there had to be correction within
[1:47:27] that situation as
[1:47:29] well verse
[1:47:32] 7 so that contr Wise you ought rather to
[1:47:34] forgive him now notice this direction
[1:47:36] that Paul gives here this is to the
[1:47:40] restoring of that young man who had been
[1:47:43] living with his
[1:47:45] mother-in-law so that contr Wise you
[1:47:48] ought rather to forgive him and and
[1:47:50] comfort him lest perhaps such a one
[1:47:52] should be swallowed up with over much
[1:47:57] sorrow wherefore I beseech you that you
[1:48:02] would confirm your love toward
[1:48:07] him appropriate times right it's
[1:48:11] appropriate times it's appropriate times
[1:48:12] even in the midst of Correction it can
[1:48:14] either be undone what was done or it can
[1:48:17] be solidified and it raises up up as a
[1:48:25] standard you love
[1:48:31] him verse n for to this end also did I
[1:48:34] write that I might know the proof of you
[1:48:37] whether you be obedient in all things to
[1:48:39] whom Ye Ye forgave anything I forgive
[1:48:42] also for if I forgave any to whom I
[1:48:44] forgave it for your sakes forgave I it
[1:48:46] in the person of Christ lest Satan
[1:48:49] should get advantage of of us for we are
[1:48:51] not ignorant of his devices Paul wanted
[1:48:54] the church to
[1:48:56] know that he says as you have forgiven
[1:49:00] so have
[1:49:02] I Paul also said I want you as a body to
[1:49:05] ensure you confirm your love toward
[1:49:12] him he not loving the behavior is not
[1:49:15] loving what the man was doing it's
[1:49:18] him you with me
[1:49:24] I know you look at this now tonight I'm
[1:49:25] not saying maybe you don't look at it
[1:49:27] but you might look at this and say this
[1:49:28] is not a real shouting service I don't
[1:49:31] know but I tell you what the presence of
[1:49:32] the Lord is so rich
[1:49:34] still and I'll tell you this right here
[1:49:36] if there's not real real true correction
[1:49:41] that comes into the church you can't
[1:49:43] enjoy
[1:49:49] yourself he that corrected his son hath
[1:49:53] rest is that right you want rest not I
[1:49:57] hope you don't you want you want
[1:50:03] rest can I read a couple more
[1:50:05] scriptures this is I'm I'm coming down I
[1:50:08] just I want to leave this with you
[1:50:12] here go to Second Corinthians
[1:50:16] 7:4 Paul is picking this same up same
[1:50:19] thing once again with the people and I
[1:50:21] want you to see this this this
[1:50:24] aspect great is my boldness of speech
[1:50:27] toward you great is my gloring of you I
[1:50:30] am filled with Comfort I am exceeding
[1:50:32] joyful in all our
[1:50:36] tribulation ain't that
[1:50:38] wonderful I am
[1:50:41] refreshing he goes on to say for we when
[1:50:43] we were in Macedonia our flesh had no
[1:50:45] rest but we were troubled on every side
[1:50:47] without were fightings within were fears
[1:50:49] never nevertheless God that comforted
[1:50:51] those that are cast down comforted Us by
[1:50:53] the coming of Titus and not by his
[1:50:54] coming only but by the consolation
[1:50:56] Comfort wherewith he was comforted in
[1:50:59] you when he told us your earnest desire
[1:51:01] your mourning your fervent mind toward
[1:51:04] me so that I Rejoice the
[1:51:07] more so they were responding to
[1:51:11] correction but you know what that
[1:51:13] response to correction would not have
[1:51:15] been right if there hadn't been
[1:51:18] relationship
[1:51:22] because Paul's not
[1:51:25] here it's like the saying that you've
[1:51:27] heard when the cat's away the mouse will
[1:51:30] play Paul was not there but what they
[1:51:33] recognized is is that Paul sent the
[1:51:36] word and God is the
[1:51:39] word they what were they honoring they
[1:51:42] were not honoring so much as the person
[1:51:44] of Paul they were honoring the person of
[1:51:48] Christ for though I made made you sorry
[1:51:50] with a letter I do not repent though I
[1:51:54] did
[1:51:56] repent I don't repent but I did
[1:52:00] repent what was Paul saying well what's
[1:52:02] he saying it wasn't something I
[1:52:03] delighted to do I didn't want to make
[1:52:06] you sorry but yet I did want to make you
[1:52:07] sorry why why can you say you didn't but
[1:52:09] you did he didn't want to see him being
[1:52:11] sorry but yet at the same time there was
[1:52:13] a part the correction had to
[1:52:16] come no wonder the prophet could say I
[1:52:19] wish this
[1:52:20] message was not mine to bring as he
[1:52:24] stood there and said I've lost many
[1:52:27] friends after this service but aren't
[1:52:30] you glad he stood
[1:52:34] faithful a word that's come forth that's
[1:52:36] made you and I who we
[1:52:38] are sure enough a word that has come to
[1:52:41] release and reveal unto us the true
[1:52:43] boundaries of who we
[1:52:45] are for I perceive that the same epistle
[1:52:48] hath made you sorry though it were but
[1:52:49] for a season now I
[1:52:52] Rejoice not that you were made
[1:52:55] sorry but that you
[1:52:57] sorrowed to repentance that's that's a
[1:53:01] key sorrowed to repentance not just
[1:53:05] sorrowed not just
[1:53:07] sorrow for ye were made
[1:53:11] sorry after a Godly
[1:53:15] manner I believe this is not only
[1:53:18] dealing with this in church
[1:53:20] I believe it's dealing in our
[1:53:22] homes it's after a Godly
[1:53:25] manner Godly
[1:53:29] manner listen friends I understand
[1:53:32] sometimes there's situation you can say
[1:53:34] Brother Sam I didn't have certain
[1:53:35] teaching like this or one more listen
[1:53:36] don't let the devil beat you up on it
[1:53:39] here's what you do you make sure that
[1:53:41] you're a faithful witness from here on
[1:53:43] out you understand me you can't do
[1:53:46] nothing about seeds that were swn back
[1:53:48] there but Esther you can tell your
[1:53:50] people to arm
[1:53:57] themselves sow good seed to counteract
[1:54:00] the
[1:54:03] bad where you were made sorry after a
[1:54:06] Godly manner that you might receive
[1:54:08] damage by us in nothing God doesn't want
[1:54:10] you
[1:54:12] damaged God doesn't want you walking out
[1:54:14] of church let me tell you this if you
[1:54:16] walk out of a church service at any time
[1:54:18] and you walk out and you're just so
[1:54:20] lethargic like and you're
[1:54:22] just something's
[1:54:26] wrong I know well I don't want some say
[1:54:31] that sometimes depending on people's
[1:54:33] backgrounds it PR it it it depending
[1:54:37] depending on backgrounds will actually
[1:54:39] cause a service to be a made or made
[1:54:41] made or broken form you understand if
[1:54:45] they're if things are not like that then
[1:54:48] it's like we didn't have church
[1:54:50] but then if it's not like this it's like
[1:54:52] oh you know then others it comes like
[1:54:55] this other
[1:54:56] oh we need the balance of the Holy
[1:54:58] Spirit you understand me God's Delight
[1:55:01] is not coming down and whooping us I
[1:55:03] want you to understand that God don't
[1:55:05] God don't say you know what I'm gonna
[1:55:06] give my Ser my servant something it's
[1:55:08] going to whoop
[1:55:09] him correction it tears you down listen
[1:55:13] to me now it's to do what separate you
[1:55:17] separate from what's wrong but God
[1:55:19] interested in just doing that CU if he
[1:55:21] does that all the time there's no
[1:55:23] building that's right but sometimes you
[1:55:26] got to get the stones out of the yard
[1:55:28] before you can sew the
[1:55:30] grass and to get the stones out of the
[1:55:33] ground you got to use a rock hound on a
[1:55:35] bobcat and get them out of the
[1:55:37] ground you with me it's not a fun job
[1:55:40] sewing a
[1:55:42] lawn but you get the rocks out of it
[1:55:44] raking and out of there and The Rock
[1:55:45] count don't get them all but once you
[1:55:47] get them all
[1:55:48] out all you can enjoy the
[1:55:56] grass verse
[1:55:59] 10 Godly sorrow this is very
[1:56:03] important Godly sorrow worketh
[1:56:05] repentance to Salvation not to be
[1:56:06] repented
[1:56:09] of but the sorrow of the world worketh
[1:56:15] death I've watched conditions I've
[1:56:17] watched
[1:56:18] where
[1:56:20] you can see things within this
[1:56:23] world where the way the world is they're
[1:56:27] sorry I know some of you think I don't
[1:56:30] hear people say a lot of times sorry no
[1:56:32] no a lot of Sorrow is a lot of the
[1:56:35] sorrow is truly what it is it's worldly
[1:56:39] because the sorrow is I'm sorry because
[1:56:41] these situations are the way they
[1:56:44] are it has nothing to do with what they
[1:56:47] are judge I'm sorry that the policeman
[1:56:51] was there and he caught me when I was
[1:56:53] robbing the
[1:56:54] bank I'm
[1:56:56] sorry I'm sorry I robbed this bank and I
[1:56:58] didn't Rob the other one I'm
[1:57:01] sorry I don't know why everything it
[1:57:03] always happens to me I tell you I was my
[1:57:06] family everything was so messed up I
[1:57:08] just look at me I'm I'm all together a
[1:57:10] mess
[1:57:11] I you think the judge is going to give
[1:57:13] in on that and say release the guy he's
[1:57:16] a troubled fell no that troubling listen
[1:57:20] to me very carefully that troubling
[1:57:22] might be
[1:57:24] true there's no doubt there's marks and
[1:57:27] scars upon every one of our lives but
[1:57:29] listen to
[1:57:30] me you don't have
[1:57:33] to let that be your alabi and your
[1:57:38] excuse that might have worked before the
[1:57:40] blood of Jesus Christ and I say might
[1:57:43] have but since there's a blood that has
[1:57:45] come a strong
[1:57:47] bleach it doesn't listen to to me it
[1:57:50] doesn't do away with the memory or the
[1:57:53] past of it but it can take the sting out
[1:57:55] of
[1:57:56] it and it can bring healing to a wound
[1:58:00] that there's no threads to stitch it
[1:58:04] upall do you understand
[1:58:07] me because there's things that all the
[1:58:09] way through this room right here there's
[1:58:11] different ones of us has had things
[1:58:12] whether it's come from school parents or
[1:58:14] different people of things things that's
[1:58:15] happened but listen to me you don't have
[1:58:17] to live with that as an excuse
[1:58:19] and I don't say that lightly to you I'm
[1:58:22] telling you that there is strength and
[1:58:25] there's power in the blood of the
[1:58:28] Lamb if you can just submit yourself and
[1:58:31] say Lord this there's a this a situation
[1:58:34] but Lord God this is not going to be
[1:58:38] me I'm not going to live of that natural
[1:58:41] family
[1:58:42] tree I want the strain of
[1:58:45] predestination to move in my life Lord
[1:58:48] God
[1:58:50] that tree of life to move through me
[1:58:52] that doesn't just come just by us saying
[1:58:54] it it comes by us submitting ourselves
[1:58:56] giving ourselves to the word letting the
[1:58:58] word work in our
[1:58:59] life being a real Godly sorrow when God
[1:59:02] deals with our lives on
[1:59:05] things what does that mean that means
[1:59:07] take
[1:59:08] responsibility a pardon is not a pardon
[1:59:10] unless it's accepted as a
[1:59:16] pardon so real sorrow Godly sorrow I
[1:59:19] love that worketh
[1:59:22] repentance what is repentance if you
[1:59:25] repentance is where you're going this
[1:59:26] way but repentance is now turn that's

[1:59:33] way and say you repented hello somebody

[1:59:38] the Lord then there has to be a turn in
[1:59:40] your
[1:59:42] life and what do you start doing you
[1:59:44] turn to him who is able to cleanse

[2:02:19] Titus has seen in the
[2:02:22] people it wasn't something that Titus
[2:02:24] had to make up but Titus saw the effect
[2:02:27] where discipline correction had went
[2:02:30] forth it had been received and now it
[2:02:33] had worked itself not only through that
[2:02:36] person that got right but it came within
[2:02:41] the church as well notice how Paul Paul
[2:02:44] says this here for behold the self-same
[2:02:47] thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly
[2:02:50] sword what carefulness it wrought in you

[2:04:33] ending here in all
[2:04:37] things ye have approved yourself to be
[2:04:42] clear in this
[2:04:44] matter that's the word of a prophet
[2:04:49] and remember though Paul went off the
[2:04:52] scene the prophet of the hour stayed on
[2:04:54] the scene who the angel of the Lord the
[2:04:58] Holy Ghost Moses went off the scene but
[2:05:01] the angel of the Lord stayed on the
[2:05:02] scene right the angel of the Lord is
[2:05:06] present you believe that yes
[2:05:10] sir he's faithful he's a faithful and
[2:05:14] true witness the beginning of the
[2:05:17] creation of God the amen of
[2:05:22] God God is

[2:05:34] you we appreciate having you in our
[2:05:36] gates this morning trust that you have
[2:05:39] felt refreshed in the Lord because the
[2:05:42] word that we're looking at it's a word
[2:05:44] God's word it always brings
[2:05:47] edification
[2:05:49] it'll cut but it
[2:05:51] edifies is that right sure it cuts but
[2:05:55] it also edifies as a matter of fact God
[2:05:57] knows how to encourage you in the right
[2:05:58] things and discourage you in the wrong
[2:06:00] things how does he know that because he
[2:06:02] knows you and he knows
[2:06:05] me God ain't just looking at numbers
[2:06:07] like a professor in a big seminar room
[2:06:09] on number 56 this guy he just kind of
[2:06:12] blew off the test that guy may have
[2:06:13] studied like crazy he doesn't know the
[2:06:16] guy brother same me that shouldn't make
[2:06:18] any difference with a grade
[2:06:19] whatsoever I don't w't go
[2:06:22] there he doesn't know the
[2:06:24] person God knows you he knows me let me
[2:06:28] tell you something let me tell you
[2:06:29] something how God knows you and me you
[2:06:31] know God he does not even have to say
[2:06:33] things in a certain way but he does for
[2:06:36] you and me I'm glad he does that you
[2:06:40] know what that does that lets me know
[2:06:41] even when I'm being corrected it lets me
[2:06:43] know he
[2:06:46] cares he's mindful he does doesn't want
[2:06:49] me to struggle with the words he wants
[2:06:52] me to yield to
[2:06:57] it
[2:06:59] I love
[2:07:03] him
[2:07:05] I love
[2:07:08] him
[2:07:11] because he
[2:07:13] first love
[2:07:17] me and
[2:07:21] purchase
[2:07:22] my
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:25] [Applause]
[2:07:27] salvation on
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:33] Cal
[2:07:36] Street I know today by the way that it
[2:07:39] places on the calendar it says Father's
[2:07:42] Day it's like they say Mother's day and
[2:07:44] those
[2:07:45] things I thank God for every every
[2:07:48] father in
[2:07:51] here but I want to take a moment as well
[2:07:55] to thank my heavenly
[2:08:00] father
[2:08:01] [Music]
[2:08:03] Hallelujah he set me
[2:08:05] free he redeemed me he shed his
[2:08:11] blood and he keeps working with
[2:08:14] me he keeps dealing with me correcting
[2:08:17] me edifying me showing me the way he is
[2:08:22] a faithful father he is truly friend
[2:08:26] that Stith closer than a
[2:08:28] brother he's not just somebody in
[2:08:30] distance that shows up but he's there
[2:08:32] with me he said Lo I'm with you always
[2:08:36] he knows how to condescend down to my
[2:08:39] level and talk to
[2:08:42] me he knows how to
[2:08:45] think 42 year old thoughts
[2:08:50] said Brother Sam he was only 33 years
[2:08:51] old but he knows the complexity of time
[2:08:54] you say he was only 33 Old 33 33 years
[2:08:56] old when he was crucified but when he
[2:08:57] stood before the Pharisees they said
[2:09:00] thou art a man no more than 50 years
[2:09:02] old he wasn't 50 but that shows the
[2:09:05] burden he was under that's he had come
[2:09:07] to such a place coming to dwell among us
[2:09:11] that he had such a burden on him that
[2:09:13] his age was beyond what his
[2:09:15] chronological age
[2:09:16] was Hallelujah
[2:09:19] so does he understand yes he does he's a
[2:09:22] faithful and merciful high
[2:09:25] priest I love him because he first loved
[2:09:31] me don't you love
[2:09:34] him I tell you if you hadn't surrendered
[2:09:37] your life to him wouldn't you want to
[2:09:38] surrender your life would you want to
[2:09:41] turn it over to the Living God and say
[2:09:43] Lord Lord Jesus you can hear him calling
[2:09:46] you what is that it's the voice of the
[2:09:49] father calling you what must I do
[2:09:53] surrender be like the prodal come back
[2:09:57] home come
[2:09:59] home say Lord even in the things we
[2:10:02] spoke about Lord let my life reflect the
[2:10:06] discipline of the
[2:10:08] word I want to walk I want to receive I
[2:10:11] want to walk in Lord in the chastening I
[2:10:13] want to walk in every part of your word
[2:10:15] I want to grow that Lord in my life I'm
[2:10:18] bringing glory to
[2:10:21] you in all
[2:10:25] things that's what Peter said they could
[2:10:27] see your good works and glorify who not
[2:10:29] you but your heavenly
[2:10:31] father because we are reflection of
[2:10:35] him like the older brother was talking
[2:10:38] to the younger brother and the younger
[2:10:40] brother said I don't know what daddy
[2:10:41] look like the older brother said
[2:10:44] well the older brother was on the scene
[2:10:47] the older brother brother said well they
[2:10:49] say I got his
[2:10:51] smile they say I I I I look like him in
[2:10:54] in in this manner and The Young and the
[2:10:56] little boy said ah now I know when I see
[2:10:59] you I've seen the father and let me tell
[2:11:01] you something the older brother is not a
[2:11:03] fleshly man the older brother is Christ
[2:11:06] himself because it is Christ who reveals
[2:11:10] the
[2:11:11] father no man has seen God at any time
[2:11:14] that the only begotten of the father he
[2:11:15] had declared
[2:11:16] him Lord so it takes the living image of
[2:11:19] the living Christ the true holy ghost
[2:11:21] moving in the church is what the true
[2:11:23] image of the Living God and that moving
[2:11:26] in you and I releasing and quickening
[2:11:28] that seed reveals the image of who our
