[4:47] most of all
[4:48] may it be
[4:50] the expression of your own life
[4:54] it's not how good we can explain the
[4:56] word
[4:58] lord reality
[5:00] if we're able and somebody's able to
[5:01] come by an explanation somebody else
[5:04] will have another explanation
[5:06] it must be something lord that goes so
[5:08] much deeper
[5:10] lord god
[5:12] we look to you father
[5:14] [Music]
[5:15] we ask the lord god right here this
[5:17] morning
[5:19] lord i know

[5:22] here under the sound of my voice whether
[5:25] here
[5:26] by way of internet
[5:29] or god that need
[5:31] they're in need of that real
[5:35] that real experience with you
[5:38] in need lord of coming under the safety
[5:42] of the blood
[5:44] lord to where their life lord
[5:47] is completely
[5:49] transformed
[5:51] they'll be battles
[5:53] but they've got a strength on the inside
[5:57] there's a love affair between you and
[5:58] them
[6:00] that though temptation
[6:01] can arise
[6:04] there's a dove on the inside
[6:06] that will lead them and give them
[6:08] strength
[6:09] through that temptation
[6:12] things the lord god
[6:15] that you would manifest through their
[6:16] life overcoming power
[6:21] oh god granted
[6:24] may you move lord i pray for every
[6:26] brother and sister
[6:28] young and old lord all that are gathered
[6:30] here
[6:31] lord i pray that father right here in
[6:34] this
[6:36] time in your presence
[6:38] [Music]
[6:41] may the lord god
[6:43] cast their cares upon you
[6:46] may they take lord
[6:49] life lord god and say lord i deliver i i
[6:52] give my life to you lord
[6:54] i surrender it lord to you
[6:58] lord god it takes your presence to come
[7:01] to bring that release into a life to
[7:03] where that they would surrender
[7:06] lord i ask right now maybe that same
[7:08] comforter
[7:09] spirit of truth
[7:12] the lord god has come and spoke this
[7:15] message this morning
[7:17] now lord god as you've already been
[7:19] making visits to hearts and lives
[7:22] may they on the end may they on the
[7:23] inside open the door
[7:26] may they open it
[7:29] oh god
[7:31] say lord jesus
[7:33] come in fully lord
[7:36] i don't want you just to come in lord
[7:38] where i'm just saved from my sins
[7:42] i don't want you just to come in to
[7:44] where you stand on a carpet and but you
[7:46] can't touch this and you can't touch
[7:48] that
[7:49] [Music]
[7:51] but i want you to come in fully
[7:54] i want you to have every door
[7:56] of my life
[7:57] jesus every room of my life
[8:01] is available to you
[8:03] [Music]
[8:04] i want you to have the uppermost seat
[8:08] the preeminence in my life
[8:12] really lord i pray
[8:14] may that just drop with such a certainty
[8:16] lord god
[8:18] that even in this moment lord as they
[8:19] would go even in prayer in their hearts
[8:22] lord such a certainty lord god that's
[8:25] stirring in their hearts that this is
[8:27] the moment
[8:28] that this is the season lord god
[8:31] oh lord jesus
[8:33] this is not a work up friends
[8:36] this is the presence of the living god
[8:40] speaking with certainty
[8:43] a moment of time
[8:47] to where you can put your foot down
[8:51] you can have uncertainty when you
[8:53] approach the promise of god
[8:54] if there's anything get it get it
[8:56] cleared out repent
[8:59] [Music]
[9:04] and if you when you fully surrender
[9:06] he'll fully come in he will he will
[9:09] that's his promise
[9:12] but samuel what should i look for
[9:17] well i'll tell you the after effects of
[9:19] it
[9:22] because the experience itself is the
[9:24] same
[9:25] of passing from death onto life
[9:28] the venue might be a little different
[9:31] the way everything exactly and the
[9:33] experiences and everything but there is
[9:35] one thing that is sure you pass from
[9:37] death into life that the desires and the
[9:39] things that you once had in your life
[9:42] you no longer have
[9:46] and he
[9:47] has become your all in all
[9:51] he is your life
[9:52] for he has given you life
