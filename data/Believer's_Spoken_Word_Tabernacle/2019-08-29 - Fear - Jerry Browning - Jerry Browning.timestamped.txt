[32:25] by
[32:32] hey man take your cheese that means all
[32:40] the world to me amen no matter the trial
[32:43] the test
[32:44] what means everything to me is it is
[32:47] well with my soul amen that's what you
[32:51] know what what separates our lives from
[32:54] other lives it's not us making ourselves
[32:57] different but it is God that has come to
[33:02] quicken what he placed inside of us and
[33:06] then that brings us as brother Brown we
[33:09] use the term throws us into subjection
[33:11] to the word and here we are being formed
[33:15] to the word image as we're feeding on
[33:17] that word to us we see the way the world
[33:21] is we see the framework we see the
[33:24] system and this whole system that is
[33:27] upon this earth right now is a religious
[33:29] system it's a religious order that
[33:33] started out of rebellion
[33:35] that fell in heaven came down to Ernie
[33:38] but it's not the true religion religion
[33:42] is only a covering but oh my we've got
[33:45] more than a country there's been an
[33:49] atonement made for us there's been a
[33:53] perfect blood that's been shed for us
[33:56] amen and the God who came down and he
[34:01] shed his own blood he has come with a
[34:04] personal Jubilee message to our hearts
[34:08] the Holy Ghost has said you were within
[34:11] my mind before the foundation of the
[34:13] world I've never forgot about you but
[34:18] all of redemption stories all of this
[34:20] was all pointing it was all calling for
[34:23] this moment I believe just any moment
[34:26] any moment we're gonna be caught away
[34:29] I believe that with all my heart you
[34:32] know and we hear the prayer requests
[34:33] that were read and I thought as I was
[34:35] standing there I thought you know of how
[34:38] we were you know reading and the one
[34:39] that they mentioned with little Liliana
[34:42] and I just in my heart I just just said
[34:45] right there I said it's a line vanity
[34:47] it's a line vanity you said brother
[34:50] Sammy you're choosing you're ignoring
[34:52] facts no no what I'm looking at there's
[34:55] a time when the truth is not the truth
[34:58] there is a greater truth is that right
[35:02] the Giants in the land was not alive
[35:04] that was the truth but the truth was God
[35:06] said I've given you the land that was
[35:09] the truth so we we choose we look at the
[35:13] truth and the promise you say when and
[35:16] how with every need well we don't know
[35:18] when and how but as believers we pray we
[35:22] commit it to God and we expect God to
[35:25] move amen and that I believe tonight the
[35:29] Lord is gonna come down tonight he's
[35:32] already here amen
[35:35] I brought him with me you brought him
[35:36] with you all the licks of fire that's
[35:38] together my it's hard to tell what will
[35:40] happen here tonight but God will come
[35:42] down and take a gift that he's placed in
[35:45] brother Jerry's life and the Holy Spirit
[35:47] will come right in and step into that
[35:49] and take that word and for what you and
[35:51] I have need of tonight God will pour out
[35:54] his inspiration upon that word and a
[35:57] word that has been an encouragement and
[35:59] has has defeated the devil time and time
[36:02] again God will come right down tonight
[36:04] and show once again that his word is the
[36:08] ultimate weapon that has been given amen
[36:12] so we we thank God for that tonight and
[36:14] we just want to just give and give right
[36:16] over into the word and just so thankful

[36:38] Lord would you sing that song with me
[36:40] how great is our God amen you know I I
[36:45] don't want to take more time but I got
[36:48] to looking at a little something I
[36:49] didn't look it up and just stumbled
[36:51] across it you know how the Bible says
[36:53] that the stars sing he said though he
[36:56] said even though creation seems there's
[36:59] a man that they caught these these
[37:02] electromagnetic pulsations from stars
[37:05] and it sounds like a symphony that's
[37:08] being played then they captured that of
[37:11] the wells
[37:12] echoing out or the joy they put it all
[37:14] together and when they put it all
[37:16] together it sounded just like this how
[37:19] great is our God God they're singing
[37:28] praises to God how great is hotdogs amen
[37:37] let's sing it together brother Jerry
[37:38] comes to minister the word of the Lord
[37:40] amen
[37:42] [Music]
[37:44] is our God sing with me how great
[37:51] [Music]
[37:59] our great
[38:01] [Music]
[38:09] [Music]
[38:17] No at all
[38:26] Oh how to do
[38:31] ah
[38:33] [Music]
[38:40] distrust
[38:42] [Music]
[39:04] and always me
[39:10] every
[39:14] say name of Allah
[39:18] [Music]
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:22] [Music]
[39:36] [Music]
[40:08] [Applause]
[40:11] hey man let's just vibes and word of
[40:14] Prayer before we go to the scripture
[40:16] tonight Heavenly Father board were
[40:19] thankful to be here tonight are together
[40:21] with believers here Lord in Ohio we ask
[40:26] God that you will anoint me now Lord to
[40:29] be able to yield to you that you may
[40:32] speak to the people and help them dear
[40:34] God bless them tonight we ask for your
[40:38] glory in Jesus Christ's name Amen if you
[40:45] could turn me into book of first John
[40:47] chapter 4 I'd like to read verses 17
[40:55] through 21 what I want to speak on
[41:01] tonight is fear
[41:09] verse 17 herein is our love made perfect
[41:13] that we may have boldness in the day of
[41:16] judgment because as he is so are we in
[41:20] this world there is no fear in love but
[41:24] perfect love casts out fear because fear
[41:29] hath torment he that feareth is not made
[41:32] perfect in love we love him because he
[41:36] first loved us if a man say I love God
[41:39] and hateth his brother he is a liar for
[41:42] he that loveth not his brother whom he
[41:45] hath seen how can he love God and we had
[41:49] hath not seen and this commandment have
[41:53] we from him that he who loveth God
[41:56] loveth his brother also a man you may be
[42:00] seated we all have to do with fear in
[42:08] our lives and theirs fears of many
[42:13] things theirs sometimes people feel fear
[42:17] failure sometimes they fear rejection
[42:21] sometimes they fear sickness there's
[42:26] people who fear being alone these are
[42:29] all fears that weigh heavily on us
[42:34] and there's many others I guess we could
[42:38] mention tonight types of fear that is in
[42:42] our lives but it paralyzes our spirit
[42:47] and they can damage our relationships
[42:51] and it definitely hinders our faith
[42:58] faith and fear cannot exist together
[43:04] hebrews 1 xi tells us that faith is
[43:09] being certain of what we do not see
[43:13] being certain of what we do not see it's
[43:17] an absolute belief that God is
[43:19] constantly working behind the scenes in
[43:22] every aspect of our life that's faith
[43:28] the phrase fear not is used 63 times in
[43:32] the Bible
[43:34] I believe that the enemy uses fear to
[43:39] decrease our hopes and limit our
[43:40] victories sometimes people worry that
[43:48] God won't come through and their time of
[43:51] need they fear that God won't be there
[43:55] for them
[43:58] sometimes people fear that God doesn't
[44:01] love them because there's things go on
[44:03] happening to them and going on in their
[44:05] lives and he well if he loved me these
[44:07] things wouldn't be happening to me
[44:10] but the Bible tells us we suffer with
[44:14] Jesus we shouldn't fear that God doesn't
[44:23] love us or that he'll come through for
[44:25] us for the Bible tells us he first loved
[44:28] us he loved us before before you were
[44:33] ever formed in the womb of your mother
[44:38] God loves you I can prove that by the
[44:43] scripture because the scripture tells us
[44:46] that before Jacob and Esau were even
[44:50] born God said he loved Jacob and how do
[44:59] you know God loves you
[45:00] he called you he said no man can come to
[45:04] me except the father calls him
[45:13] perfect love casts out fear if for
[45:22] instance like to light these lights in
[45:24] the building here you've got to work
[45:27] according to the laws of electricity
[45:29] otherwise the lights won't come on
[45:33] - brother branham gives an example and
[45:35] says if I had crops on this hill and I
[45:37] had water on this hill he said the only
[45:40] way I could get the water over there -
[45:43] all those crops is by complying to the
[45:46] law of gravity to move that water from
[45:50] here to there and it's the same thing
[45:53] with our healing we must work according
[45:58] to the law of God and and his only
[46:03] belief all things are possible to them
[46:07] to believe perfect love brother Branham
[46:11] says casts out all fear perfect love
[46:18] casts out all fear
[46:19] brother em says love and faith is the
[46:22] same thing perfect love casts out all
[46:25] fear which gives faith when fear is gone
[46:29] faith is perfect
[46:31] so you see why Satan wants to use fear
[46:35] fear of your sickness fear of your
[46:38] illness fear that well I won't I won't
[46:42] make it fear of death there's people who
[46:46] have fear of death
[46:51] we you know if I was to ask anybody here
[46:56] tonight there would be nobody would say
[46:58] I want to die nobody wants to die that's
[47:01] in their right mind but to die the Bible
[47:08] says is gain if we die in the Lord we
[47:16] live so Satan should not be able to
[47:20] torment us with fear of death brother
[47:22] Adam says death is just a vehicle that
[47:25] takes you from this dimension to that
[47:28] dimension some people are scared he
[47:33] won't keep his word but I know that he
[47:37] does he does keep his word he has always
[47:42] kept his word I'd like to read from 1st
[47:47] Corinthians chapter 13
[47:54] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1
[47:57] though i speak with tongues of men and
[48:00] angels and have not charity I am become
[48:03] as sounding brass and tinkling cymbal
[48:05] charity is love and though I have the
[48:10] gift of prophecy and understand all
[48:12] mysteries and all knowledge though I
[48:15] have all faith so that I can remove
[48:18] mountains and have not charity I am
[48:20] nothing though I bestow all my goods to
[48:23] feed the poor and though I give my body
[48:25] to be burned and have not charity it
[48:28] profiteth me nothing charity suffereth
[48:31] long and is kind charity envieth not
[48:35] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[48:37] puffed up does not behave itself
[48:39] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[48:42] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[48:44] rejoiceth not in iniquity rejoices in
[48:47] the truth beareth all things believeth
[48:50] all things hopeth all things endureth
[48:53] all things charity never faileth but
[48:58] whether there be prophecies they shall
[49:00] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[49:02] cease whether there be knowledge it
[49:06] shall vanish away for we know in part
[49:09] and we prophesy in part but when that
[49:12] which is perfect is come then that which
[49:14] is in part shall be done away brother
[49:18] Branham speaking about that scripture he
[49:21] says it's talking about love and he says
[49:25] it says when that which is perfect is
[49:27] come he said which is love perfect love
[49:33] and perfect love will never pass away
[49:37] amen do we believe he's Almighty God if
[49:48] he's not capable of looking out for us
[49:51] then he's not Almighty God if he's not
[49:52] capable of doing all things then he's
[49:55] not all mighty God if he's not capable
[49:57] of knowing all things then he's not
[49:59] Almighty God but I believe he is
[50:04] I believe he knows everything I believe
[50:07] that he's taking care of everything I
[50:11] commit my life into his hands I commit
[50:15] my soul into his hands my being my
[50:20] living everything myself I committed
[50:24] into his hands how things are going to
[50:27] come out I committed into his hands
[50:29] how is this problem going to be his
[50:32] resolves I committed into his hands
[50:36] I've been in the midst of things to
[50:39] where
[50:40] I looked for a way out I looked for a
[50:43] way to resolve the situation I was in
[50:46] and I would come up with what I thought
[50:48] was a good idea love how to do it and it
[50:52] would fail but when I stood back and
[50:56] committed it to God and watch what God
[50:58] would do then God always does it
[51:01] perfectly
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:10] if you have the right kind of love
[51:13] for God you won't have one speck of fear
[51:20] we're still growing
[51:22] in love we all have filial love but the
[51:30] love that is talking about is agape love
[51:33] that's perfect love love that when
[51:40] you're you know people fear that perhaps
[51:43] their children won't come and give their
[51:45] lives to the Lord if you've got the
[51:53] right kind of love agape love you can
[51:56] pray and say God do whatever you need to
[51:58] do to them if they got to come down to
[52:02] face death then let them come down to
[52:04] face death if I've got to to say goodbye
[52:08] to them in this life to see them in the
[52:11] next life is what I want I'm willing to
[52:15] lay it all down before God
[52:24] no one would like to see their
[52:27] children's lives in a wreck but if
[52:31] that's what it takes Lord then I that's
[52:34] the right kind of love see the filial
[52:37] love will get you into trouble the
[52:41] filial love you know it wants to well
[52:45] there might my son or there my daughter
[52:47] and make some kind of excuse warm or
[52:50] make some kind of loophole form that the
[52:52] filial love but the agape love says I
[52:56] want to see him saved at any cost
[53:05] the breath says you can't have faith
[53:08] until you have love
[53:11] and when you've got perfect love then it
[53:15] casts out all fear all a double L all
[53:22] fears love drives fear out then faith
[53:38] comes in and takes the place of fear one
[53:45] of the greatest hindrances brother
[53:47] branham says to the believer to
[53:49] Christians is fear the reason they're
[53:55] fearful he says because they don't have
[53:57] the right temperance of love that never
[54:00] entered into that yet
[54:04] I'm not saying these to condemn us we
[54:07] all fight fear but if we'd love God with
[54:15] the agape love and realized as the
[54:18] scripture said he loved us first I like
[54:22] the song that that says he knew me yet
[54:27] he loved me
[54:28] so he knew everything I would ever be in
[54:31] my life everything I would ever do he
[54:34] knew every failure every mistake every
[54:36] fault and he still loved me now that's
[54:44] the kind of love that you can count on
[54:46] that's the kind of love that will drive
[54:50] out fear when you really love the Lord
[54:57] then you can trust him Jesus says in the
[55:03] Book of Luke he said fear not little
[55:06] flock for it is your father's good
[55:08] pleasure to bring you the kingdom we
[55:12] live in a time where a lot of people are
[55:14] perplexed the Bible tells us we're
[55:20] living in a time when men's hearts fail
[55:22] them for fear
[55:26] there was one time that I wanted to
[55:30] mention in the scripture there was a
[55:32] time when the children of Israel came
[55:35] out of Egypt
[55:37] and when they came out they got down by
[55:41] the Red Sea and all of a sudden Pharaohs
[55:45] chariots and armies showed up on the
[55:50] horizon and they looked and they cried
[55:55] out to Moses said was there not enough
[55:57] graves in Egypt that you had to bring us
[56:00] out here to die
[56:01] you see fear had gripped them they were
[56:07] looking at the circumstance they were
[56:11] not looking at the Jehovah God was there
[56:15] to take care of that they were not
[56:18] looking at that Jehovah could do the
[56:20] impossible and they cried to Moses and
[56:26] Moses said fear not but stand still and
[56:30] see the salvation of the Lord and
[56:36] remember the Lord said to Moses why cry
[56:38] speech and go forward whatever I think
[56:44] about that I think about when we first
[56:46] was starting to work here back years ago
[56:49] in the 80s and every time somebody would
[56:53] go through a trial or something like
[56:54] here brother bill said go forward you
[56:59] remember that he said why Christ beat
[57:03] and go forward and he told him raise
[57:07] your rod and then God did the impossible
[57:12] he you know you could not part water
[57:22] but God did it to me must have been with
[57:28] the breath from his nostrils because it
[57:31] just blew the water back on either side
[57:35] not only that but he told them they were
[57:38] going to walk through on dry ground now
[57:41] I will tell you something when you first
[57:43] move water the ground ain't dry when it
[57:46] rains outside how long does it take for
[57:48] the ground to dry up but he said you're
[57:50] gonna walk through a dry ground so he
[57:53] breathed on the Red Sea and it split and
[57:56] there was dry ground to walk on God said
[58:04] I'll not stop until I get me hotter upon
[58:07] Pharaoh and his army in his chariots and
[58:14] with the same water he parted for the
[58:17] children of Israel across through and he
[58:18] said a hardened Pharaoh's heart that
[58:21] he'll follow after you they follow
[58:26] laughter of course we all familiar with
[58:28] the story
[58:29] Pharaoh's army got drowned by the Red
[58:32] Sea
[58:33] [Music]
[58:37] fear not they had a cloud by day and a
[58:42] pillar of fire by night yet they so many
[58:48] times were overtaken with fear it is
[58:52] because they didn't trust Jehovah that's
[58:58] why when they came down to the time to
[59:00] take the land and they sent the ten
[59:02] spies out and then you know they came
[59:06] back and and when they came back some
[59:10] said we're not able why it was their
[59:13] fear they said we look like grasshoppers
[59:17] in their sight that was their own
[59:21] imagination fear working on their
[59:24] imagination as I heard brother joel for
[59:28] nice a knot on one of them went over and
[59:30] said hey what do I look like to you it
[59:36] was their own imagination
[59:42] but time after time Jehovah had proven
[59:46] that he was taking terrible and he has
[59:49] proven over and over and over again in
[59:52] our lives that he is taking care of us
[59:55] and every aspect of our lives and he
[59:58] cares about even the smallest my new
[1:00:01] things in our life then we ought to be
[1:00:04] able to trust him because he's come
[1:00:06] through time and time again like the
[1:00:10] song says he'll do it again
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:19] we look at Moses God had a purpose in
[1:00:23] Moses he had a purpose for Moses to
[1:00:26] fulfill brother Branham says God's got a
[1:00:31] purpose for you and I to feel and he
[1:00:34] said the sooner we get in that place
[1:00:37] that it'll save he said God and yourself
[1:00:43] a lot of trouble Lord spoke to Abraham
[1:00:58] says the word of the Lord came to Abram
[1:01:01] and said fear not Abram
[1:01:05] I am your shield I am thy seeding great
[1:01:10] reward fear not I'm your shield I'm
[1:01:16] there to shield you I'm there to take
[1:01:18] care of you fear not the Lord came to
[1:01:24] Isaac told him fear not
[1:01:30] I'm with thee and I'll bless thee and
[1:01:33] multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham
[1:01:35] sake
[1:01:41] Deuteronomy God talking to the children
[1:01:46] of Israel he said fear not neither be
[1:01:49] discouraged
[1:01:53] doesn't matter if you're going through
[1:01:56] something doesn't matter how long that
[1:01:58] it seems to be going on don't become
[1:02:02] discouraged God is working behind the
[1:02:07] scene remember when the angel came to
[1:02:15] Daniel
[1:02:17] and he said fear not Daniel I've been
[1:02:20] sent from the presence of the Lord and
[1:02:22] he said God herds you on the first day
[1:02:26] and dispatched me to come down and bring
[1:02:30] you the answer but said I was beset by
[1:02:36] the Prince of Persia and he said Michael
[1:02:42] had to come down with his angels and
[1:02:44] fight so that I could get through 21
[1:02:47] days Daniel prayed he didn't quit he
[1:02:50] didn't give up so I'd been praying about
[1:02:54] this one situation for a long time
[1:02:56] doesn't seem to be getting anywhere keep
[1:02:58] on praying keep on believing remember
[1:03:07] when John Ryan came and was prayed for
[1:03:09] my brother branham for his eyes he was
[1:03:11] blind
[1:03:13] went off the platform still blind
[1:03:17] humming background got back in line come
[1:03:20] back up brother branham said I said you
[1:03:21] already healed he said well I can't see
[1:03:25] brother brems said I realized that him
[1:03:29] being Catholic background he had to have
[1:03:32] something for him to do he said so I
[1:03:35] told him you everywhere you go
[1:03:37] you say by his stripes I'm healed you
[1:03:41] remember the story he was out on the
[1:03:44] corner selling newspapers extra-extra
[1:03:48] hear all about it by his stripes I'm
[1:03:50] healed everywhere he went by his stripes
[1:03:52] I'm healed you know what it did it was
[1:03:55] getting rid of the fear in his life he
[1:04:00] kept claiming the promise by His stripes
[1:04:03] I'm healed until the day of his
[1:04:06] visitation and look at when the day of
[1:04:10] his visitation was was when somebody was
[1:04:13] mocking him and in the face of somebody
[1:04:18] mocking him God restored his sight the
[1:04:29] children of Israel God spoke to them and
[1:04:34] said when you are come nigh into battle
[1:04:38] that the preach shall approach and speak
[1:04:41] unto the people and say unto them hear o
[1:04:43] Israel the approach this day in the
[1:04:46] battle against your enemies let not your
[1:04:47] hearts faint fear not and do not tremble
[1:04:51] neither be terrified because of them why
[1:04:56] why is he saying this what for what why
[1:04:59] should they not be terrified for the
[1:05:03] Lord your God is he that goes with you
[1:05:06] to fight for you against your enemies to
[1:05:09] save you time after time God gave them
[1:05:16] victory
[1:05:19] why would they doubt him when it come
[1:05:22] time to cross over when God had gave
[1:05:26] them victory time after time against
[1:05:29] insurmountable odds
[1:05:39] tells them again in Deuteronomy 31 he
[1:05:42] said be strong and of good courage fear
[1:05:44] not nor be afraid to them for the Lord
[1:05:47] thy God he it is that does go with you
[1:05:49] he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:05:54] that's not going to follow you he's not
[1:05:57] going to forsake you I've dealt with
[1:06:01] people that had fear of failure
[1:06:05] fear of failure I dealt with it within
[1:06:09] my own life when I first went to Dixon
[1:06:12] the devil would come to me and say every
[1:06:15] ministers been here before you failed
[1:06:16] you're gonna fail too I was talking
[1:06:20] about the Tim Pruitt on the phone one
[1:06:21] time about it and he said we'll praise
[1:06:24] the Lord brother Jerry if the devil's
[1:06:26] telling you you're gonna fail it means
[1:06:28] you have it but I say this if God's the
[1:06:34] one that's in control how could we fail
[1:06:38] he said he would never fail us no
[1:06:41] forsake us
[1:06:42] so if God's want to control to your life
[1:06:44] you can't fail
[1:06:47] he said that all things there's that
[1:06:52] word again a double arrow all all things
[1:06:56] work together for the good of them that
[1:06:58] love the Lord they are called according
[1:07:02] to his purpose alleluia
[1:07:16] told remember Boaz told Ruth said fear
[1:07:20] not I will do all the tower requires I
[1:07:25] love that reading that story about Ruth
[1:07:27] because you know why I feel like I'm
[1:07:30] reading to buy myself the Bride of
[1:07:31] Christ because that's who Ruth typed the
[1:07:36] Gentile bride fear not remember the time
[1:07:44] of the famine and Elijah God had told
[1:07:48] him there's a woman down here a woman
[1:07:51] that I've got that's going to take care
[1:07:53] of you
[1:07:55] and he's sent him down there and when he
[1:07:57] got there he saw the woman and he said
[1:08:00] give me a drink and she she said all
[1:08:02] right and he says why you're going to
[1:08:04] fetch a drink said make me a little cake
[1:08:07] remember she said I've only got enough
[1:08:11] to make me and my son a cake and we're
[1:08:12] going to eat it and then we're gonna die
[1:08:16] and he said fear not it's what he said -
[1:08:21] he said fear not go and do his taoist
[1:08:25] said but make me a little cake first and
[1:08:32] he said bring it unto me and afterward
[1:08:35] make for thee and thy son already he was
[1:08:38] talking about a multiplication here
[1:08:41] because she said she only had enough to
[1:08:43] make one and he was telling her to make
[1:08:44] two and he told her the crew savoia will
[1:08:51] not run drying the mill Barrow will not
[1:08:53] run empty prints she had to overcome her
[1:08:58] fear and believe him but what did she
[1:09:02] have to lose she was going to die what
[1:09:09] have you got to lose there's not
[1:09:15] anything in this world that's worth
[1:09:19] missing the rapture this world has
[1:09:24] nothing of value to offer all the riches
[1:09:28] in this world are not worth it because
[1:09:31] every one of them will pass away
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:37] nothing's worth missing eternal life
[1:09:42] we've got nothing to lose so give it all
[1:09:47] over to him committed in his head you
[1:09:51] know if you sincerely commit it to God
[1:09:54] you won't be worrying about it anymore
[1:10:04] king of syria had declared war on israel
[1:10:10] and every time the king was syria would
[1:10:14] send his troops down to a certain place
[1:10:17] to to come against Israel
[1:10:21] Elijah would tell the king of Israel
[1:10:24] don't go to that place and it kept
[1:10:27] happening till the point to where the
[1:10:30] king of Syria said which one of you is
[1:10:32] for the king of Israel and he said and
[1:10:36] one of the service is not none of us he
[1:10:39] said but there's our prophet down there
[1:10:41] that tells the king of Israel if things
[1:10:44] you say in private so the king of Syria
[1:10:52] gets this idea I'll just go down and get
[1:10:54] that man so he sends his armies down
[1:10:58] there and a great number and they
[1:11:01] surround they hear that Elijah Elijah is
[1:11:05] down in Dalton so they go down and
[1:11:07] surround the city at night and one of
[1:11:11] the morning Dawn's Elisha's servant goes
[1:11:14] out and sees the hills all covered with
[1:11:17] the soldiers and chariots of Syria he
[1:11:22] comes back in he tells it Elisha we're
[1:11:24] doomed we are doomed we are so
[1:11:30] surrounded they have found you Elisha
[1:11:35] says there's more with us than there are
[1:11:37] with them and you imagine a servant
[1:11:42] looking around the same Elisha are you
[1:11:45] little touched in the head right now I
[1:11:46] don't see anybody for us but I remember
[1:11:50] Elijah said prayed said Lord open his
[1:11:53] eyes and when he opened the servants
[1:11:56] eyes he saw the hillsides there was
[1:12:01] chariots of fire and angels surrounding
[1:12:06] all around and then Elijah prays and
[1:12:11] smites the soldiers blind now I'm not
[1:12:15] blind where they couldn't see but blind
[1:12:18] where they couldn't tell who he was he
[1:12:22] walks out and says the man you're
[1:12:23] looking for it's not here I'll take you
[1:12:25] to where he's at and so they follow him
[1:12:29] and he takes him down to Samaria
[1:12:31] and then after he gets them down there
[1:12:33] he says Lord open their eyes and they
[1:12:36] look and see whether act and they write
[1:12:39] the myths of the enemy all around him
[1:12:50] and Elijah tells the king of Israel just
[1:12:55] feed them don't kill him
[1:12:58] just feed them and send them back to
[1:13:00] their king they did that and all the
[1:13:05] raids against Israel stopped see God had
[1:13:11] a way of defeating the Syrian army
[1:13:20] Isaiah tells us fear not for I have
[1:13:24] redeemed thee I have called thee by name
[1:13:27] thou are mine we belong to it
[1:13:34] you many times here brother branham free
[1:13:37] and he'll say Satan take your hand off
[1:13:39] this daughter of God were this son of
[1:13:41] God
[1:13:43] we belong to him Satan doesn't have any
[1:13:48] claim on us but he tries to work you
[1:13:53] know where fear works it's not in your
[1:13:55] soul fear works in your spirit realm
[1:14:00] works through reasoning and imagination
[1:14:03] and these different things in the spirit
[1:14:07] realm Satan comes and he worked builder
[1:14:10] and preach the message greatest battle
[1:14:12] ever fought and he said the battleground
[1:14:16] Satan pick was your mind and that's
[1:14:19] where fear tries to work in your mind
[1:14:23] but friends look forget reasoning don't
[1:14:34] let your imagination get carried away
[1:14:36] with you
[1:14:43] Mary the angel came to Mary and told her
[1:14:49] fear not you have found favor with God
[1:14:54] you're going to have a son
[1:14:57] you're gonna be overshadowed by the Holy
[1:14:59] Ghost and you're gonna have a son his
[1:15:02] name will be called Emmanuel
[1:15:07] so here she is with child
[1:15:11] and Joseph is fearful he doesn't know
[1:15:17] what to do if he if he takes Mary to
[1:15:23] himself then how is he going to look on
[1:15:25] him that he doesn't care
[1:15:30] because they said all she's been with
[1:15:32] some soldier Joseph didn't know and he
[1:15:39] didn't he in because of fear he didn't
[1:15:41] know what to do but the Bible says while
[1:15:44] he thought on these things the aims of
[1:15:47] the Lord came to him and told him fear
[1:15:50] not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for
[1:15:52] that which is inner is conceived of the
[1:15:55] Holy Ghost
[1:16:09] Zacarias wanted a son angel Lord came to
[1:16:14] him and said fear not your wife
[1:16:16] Elizabeth who was barren is going to
[1:16:18] have his son and his name will be called
[1:16:20] John
[1:16:23] Zacarias couldn't believe it so he so
[1:16:29] the angel says you'll not speak you'll
[1:16:33] not be able to speak you'll be dumb
[1:16:35] until the day the child is born and from
[1:16:40] all through her pregnancy Zacharias
[1:16:45] couldn't speak nine months of no
[1:16:50] speaking but when he the child was born
[1:16:57] his speech come back to him and you know
[1:17:00] what the first thing he said his name is
[1:17:02] John I said something on Sunday about
[1:17:14] Jai restore remember when the servant
[1:17:21] came sire gyrus was there speaking to
[1:17:24] the Lord want him to come free for his
[1:17:26] daughter and the servant came and said
[1:17:28] don't trouble the master any longer
[1:17:30] she's dead
[1:17:32] and Jesus says to him fear not believe
[1:17:36] only fear not believe only the Bible
[1:17:45] tells us that the hairs of our head is
[1:17:47] numbered brother branham you say I
[1:17:50] haven't lost a one God knows where
[1:17:53] they're at
[1:17:58] you said if the hairs of your head are
[1:18:00] numbered fear not therefore ye are of
[1:18:03] more value than many sparrows
[1:18:12] remember all the fear the disciples
[1:18:14] dealt with when Jesus was being taken
[1:18:19] peter was overcome with fear that's what
[1:18:22] caused him to deny had then he knew the
[1:18:24] Lord they didn't know what to make of it
[1:18:31] they they because when Jesus had told
[1:18:35] them destroy this temple in three days
[1:18:37] I'll raise it up again they didn't
[1:18:38] understand what he was talking about
[1:18:42] they just believed it you know the other
[1:18:47] men around that heard they thought that
[1:18:49] he was talking about the tabernacle that
[1:18:51] Solomon had built he imagined Peter and
[1:18:54] rest on saying well that would really be
[1:18:56] something but if he says he can do it I
[1:18:58] believe it they didn't understand it so
[1:19:02] when the women came down to the to the
[1:19:05] tomb they they still were not
[1:19:08] understanding they didn't know what was
[1:19:09] going on and they come down there and
[1:19:13] the stone was rolled away and there was
[1:19:17] an angel there that told him fear not I
[1:19:20] know who you seek his Jesus but he's not
[1:19:22] here he goeth before you into Galilee go
[1:19:28] tell his disciples you know why the
[1:19:33] Angels say fear not because fear was on
[1:19:36] them but when the angel told him fear
[1:19:40] not he's risen then that dissolved their
[1:19:47] fear they still did how could he be
[1:19:52] risen they still didn't understand
[1:19:55] but they believed what the angel told
[1:19:58] them
[1:20:07] the Lord says in Revelations chapter 1
[1:20:12] when John the Revelator saw him he said
[1:20:15] when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[1:20:16] dead he laid his right hand upon me
[1:20:19] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[1:20:22] and the last I am he that liveth and was
[1:20:26] dead and behold I am Alive for evermore
[1:20:28] and have the keys of hell fear not
[1:20:42] brother branham went beyond the curtain
[1:20:44] of time I was just listened to something
[1:20:46] about it just this week and he went
[1:20:52] beyond the curtain of time there comes
[1:20:56] so many people to greet him and his
[1:21:01] first wife hope came too greedy and she
[1:21:05] said my precious brother and she hugged
[1:21:07] him and then another woman comes up and
[1:21:11] she hugs brother browning Branham and
[1:21:13] says my precious brother brother Francis
[1:21:15] I don't understand this and then hoping
[1:21:17] the lady the other lady hugged each
[1:21:19] other and there was no feelings of
[1:21:24] humanity there brother ministers I don't
[1:21:29] understand this
[1:21:31] and the angel spoke to him the voice
[1:21:33] spoke to him said this is what you
[1:21:35] preached the Holy Ghost is this is
[1:21:40] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[1:21:44] without it brother Brent says I'm more
[1:21:48] determine to my life that you can't make
[1:21:50] it there without perfect love friends I
[1:21:59] don't know how this body's going to
[1:22:00] change but I'm not in fear over whether
[1:22:03] it's going to do it or not I believe
[1:22:05] it's going to change I'm looking forward
[1:22:09] to it I don't think it'll hurt a bit
[1:22:12] sister it's just going to change so I
[1:22:25] know it's written in the Bible the
[1:22:27] prophets gather with their people
[1:22:31] bril dreams yes I remember that
[1:22:33] Scripture
[1:22:35] he says well then you gather with your
[1:22:37] people never brother branham was he was
[1:22:41] fearful before this he didn't want to be
[1:22:44] just a spirit floating around or
[1:22:46] something so he kind of had a fear about
[1:22:50] it and then the Lord allowed this to
[1:22:52] happen and one of the things brother
[1:22:57] branham asks is will they be real can I
[1:23:01] touch them that was what he was afraid
[1:23:05] of that would just be floating around
[1:23:06] wouldn't be able to touch one another
[1:23:08] and all these things he says yes they're
[1:23:11] real you can touch them it dissolved his
[1:23:16] fear concerning that matter because he
[1:23:24] saw what perfect love was Paul told
[1:23:30] Timothy for God hath not given us a
[1:23:32] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:23:35] and of a sound mind
[1:23:41] the book of Romans Paul says we have not
[1:23:44] received
[1:23:46] let me just back up I'll read all this
[1:23:48] in verse 14 whereas many has led by the
[1:23:51] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:23:54] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:23:57] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:24:00] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:24:02] we cry Abba Father the spirit itself
[1:24:06] bears witness with our spirit that we
[1:24:08] are the children of God and if children
[1:24:12] then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with
[1:24:14] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:24:17] that we may be also glorified together
[1:24:23] and I'll just throw in this last verse
[1:24:25] because I really like it
[1:24:27] Romans 8:18 well I reckon that the
[1:24:32] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:24:34] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:24:35] which shall be revealed in us we've not
[1:24:41] been given the spirit of bondage again
[1:24:43] to fear but the spirit of adoption we
[1:24:50] are children of God if if we're children
[1:24:57] then he loves us unconditionally
[1:25:11] in one service titled exhortation of the
[1:25:18] divine healing
[1:25:22] brother branham there was a woman that
[1:25:24] came up before brother branham and he
[1:25:28] said I see that you've really been
[1:25:30] suffering
[1:25:32] and he said Astra did she believe him to
[1:25:35] be God's prophet he said you know you're
[1:25:38] coming up here is a testimony to
[1:25:40] everybody that you believe in divine
[1:25:41] illy
[1:25:42] where you wouldn't come up here
[1:25:46] that he told her you know because the
[1:25:48] people come into the presence of that
[1:25:50] angel standing there with him at first
[1:25:52] it would strike little fear in them and
[1:25:56] he'd tell him fear not
[1:26:00] that's that's just him and after he
[1:26:06] tells this lady that then he says you
[1:26:08] you have cancer that's what it is
[1:26:12] said you're suffering with cancer he
[1:26:14] said you believe God heals you just come
[1:26:17] here about a minute to me because I'm
[1:26:20] gonna pray for you that God will bless
[1:26:22] you and heal you and he prays for her
[1:26:26] and then after he prays for she goes to
[1:26:27] walk off and brother Brendan says just a
[1:26:30] minute he said I I feel something I
[1:26:34] filled that spirit of cancer he says
[1:26:38] sister come back here a minute he says
[1:26:40] maybe it's still on you and then he
[1:26:42] comes back near to him he says no it's
[1:26:44] nice gone
[1:26:47] he said all I feel it coming from over
[1:26:51] here said it's a kindred spirit
[1:26:53] it's another demon of cancer he said
[1:26:57] they're sympathetic with one another and
[1:26:59] he NE says calls out this man laying on
[1:27:03] a cot and says you're dying with cancer
[1:27:05] and says you've got cancer of the of the
[1:27:12] spleen and it's through your kidneys in
[1:27:14] your stomach and your inwards
[1:27:17] is it really God heals you
[1:27:19] the gods healed you and then he talks
[1:27:24] about those demons and he says it's like
[1:27:27] birds of feather they flock together and
[1:27:31] he says these spirits he said like doves
[1:27:35] we'll go together he said well then they
[1:27:39] don't hang out with buzzards
[1:27:41] but buzzards hang out with buzzards and
[1:27:44] he says that that's what I'm talking
[1:27:46] about is these demon spirits and that
[1:27:50] spirit he said of cancer was on that man
[1:27:52] was sympathetic because the spirit was
[1:27:55] cast out of that woman brother and said
[1:27:59] you know the cancer is a devil it's a
[1:28:01] demon and he said the angel of the Lord
[1:28:06] appeared to me and he told me that with
[1:28:09] I believe that when I pray not even
[1:28:13] cancer will stand before my prayer and
[1:28:20] he said there's been more healings of
[1:28:23] cancer than any other thing in my
[1:28:26] ministry
[1:28:37] perfect love casts out all fear
[1:28:47] the Brenham said he was praying the
[1:28:52] message unconditional covenant he said
[1:28:57] he leads us all into perfect faith
[1:28:59] perfect love one for another make us
[1:29:02] Lord so much in love that it be hard for
[1:29:05] us to leave the building that's the kind
[1:29:09] of love we wanted our miss that's the
[1:29:12] kind of move of the Spirit we wonder
[1:29:14] miss where you feel like you wouldn't
[1:29:17] want to leave here recently I preached
[1:29:26] back at home I don't remember which
[1:29:31] sermon it was but it was just your
[1:29:34] recent
[1:29:36] and I went to walk out the back
[1:29:39] afterwards and I usually go back there
[1:29:43] so I can stand and greet the people as
[1:29:45] they come out
[1:29:47] and brother Jim Horner had stepped out
[1:29:51] and then he stepped back in
[1:29:54] and when I came back out of the office
[1:29:57] and he was still standing back in there
[1:29:58] he says I don't want to leave he said
[1:30:01] there's something about the presence the
[1:30:03] Lord here I don't want to leave that's
[1:30:06] how we want God in our myths hallelujah
[1:30:13] let's stand Heavenly Father we come
[1:30:22] before you tonight we thank you for your
[1:30:25] word there Lord we thank you for words
[1:30:28] of encouragement Lord and a faith Lord
[1:30:32] and instruction Lord it shows just how
[1:30:38] much you love your people we think you
[1:30:41] Lord for taking the time to come down
[1:30:43] and be with us here this evening Lord
[1:30:47] Lord bless your people continue to bless
[1:30:50] them I pray Lord God Jesus Christ name
[1:31:24] better words
[1:31:31] that was real counsel
[1:31:34] counselor tonight
[1:31:36] I really believe that it would it would
[1:31:39] behoove us
[1:31:41] just take time and go back over that
[1:31:43] service
[1:31:46] you know just something they just kept
[1:31:48] coming to me as the jury was minister
[1:31:57] god the greatest compliment that we can
[1:32:02] give to God is to have faith in what he
[1:32:07] said
[1:32:12] and you know
[1:32:15] in every one of these instances of how
[1:32:19] the Lord ministered every one of those
[1:32:22] for the scriptural hearts even those
[1:32:25] things that was brought out of brother
[1:32:26] branham's life you'll notice every one
[1:32:30] of them his experiences
[1:32:34] suppose tell me what were you saying
[1:32:36] that it isn't just something to where we
[1:32:38] just look at in the word at just just to
[1:32:45] look at it but God wants to make that
[1:32:49] word live within us and so God is the
[1:32:56] one working in all out of their lives
[1:32:59] you know brother Branham made mention
[1:33:03] brother Ruth Jerry made mention of the
[1:33:05] time brother bad I mean we've all heard
[1:33:07] that most of us maybe some of you have
[1:33:09] brother Brown was talking about going
[1:33:11] beyond the curtain of time and before
[1:33:13] then we had a lot of his fears wandering
[1:33:20] you listen to the message go to 1953
[1:33:24] brother branham goes into the latter
[1:33:26] part of that message he makes a
[1:33:29] statement when he's down with sickness
[1:33:33] and he says looking at his wife he says
[1:33:36] sometimes I even wonder if I'll call me
[1:33:39] now that's hard for us to try to think
[1:33:41] after how God has used the problem so
[1:33:45] much that he would make a statement and
[1:33:48] say sometimes I even wonder if I'm
[1:33:49] called sister meaning being a faithful
[1:33:52] helpmate she said you ought to be
[1:33:54] ashamed of yourself to say that brother
[1:34:00] Brett said what it is he got he got to
[1:34:02] look in at something of what General Pat
[1:34:04] had said and if I put this bullet in a
[1:34:08] gun if that bullet don't go off I'm
[1:34:11] going to take it out and I want to put
[1:34:13] another bullet in if that little go off
[1:34:15] I want to take that out and put another
[1:34:16] bullet in with Brett said what it is he
[1:34:19] said I've always been afraid of failing
[1:34:23] of failing
[1:34:26] receipt god allowed the experience to
[1:34:29] come and God let him know this whole
[1:34:34] sickness he was dealing with
[1:34:36] he needed to accept the commission that
[1:34:40] God had already confirmed the joy soon
[1:34:43] as brother Graham said and Lord I accept
[1:34:48] it with Rev said that moment the fever
[1:34:52] broke the Silas condition left and he
[1:34:57] said right there he said I'm determined
[1:34:59] if that bullet fails I'll put another
[1:35:02] one in
[1:35:03] he said God can't fail see it wasn't
[1:35:06] experience it wasn't just looking at
[1:35:08] something with and I hope you understand
[1:35:11] what we're saying
[1:35:13] it's an experience God brings his word
[1:35:16] to pass and as that word is coming to
[1:35:18] past and that experience it cast out all
[1:35:22] fear
[1:35:25] sometimes we wonder with experiences and
[1:35:28] things that we go through and test a
[1:35:30] traveler but we know that all things
[1:35:32] work together for the good tests and
[1:35:36] trials are not they're not droppings
[1:35:40] that just happen to come over in our
[1:35:41] life this kind of wants to get out of
[1:35:44] this guy and the spirit doesn't like it
[1:35:48] but the inside man is anchored in God
[1:35:52] that's where God takes control and I
[1:35:58] just those things tonight how the Holy
[1:36:01] Spirit came both for our heart everyone
[1:36:05] else from the Red Sea that was an
[1:36:06] experience that's an experience did they
[1:36:10] not see God did not God tell them before
[1:36:13] if you're not sure he did but yet now
[1:36:16] experiences come and all of those
[1:36:19] experiences and you say Lord let me just
[1:36:22] lift up my eyes and remember this one
[1:36:26] thing no matter what the experience is
[1:36:29] it was said over and over as the Lord
[1:36:31] would take brother Jerry through this
[1:36:33] and this is exactly how the Lord has
[1:36:35] brought this message to us in the end
[1:36:37] time it is to cast out all fear and that
[1:36:41] was you were in his mind before the
[1:36:45] foundation of the world I've always
[1:36:49] loved you
[1:36:53] I sought you out and that's where faith
[1:36:56] takes hold that's where faith in rest he
[1:37:03] knows the end the same one who holds the
[1:37:08] beginning he holds the end it's securely
[1:37:14] that's what love does and bring security
[1:37:17] I love that love cast out fear faith in
[1:37:21] step in
[1:37:23] all we the Lord the Lord spoken tonight
[1:37:27] it's already been clearly said but say
[1:37:32] Lord with every experience let the word
[1:37:36] come let it cast out the fear fears not
[1:37:44] in the soul spirit realm it's a mine
[1:37:50] see these things that the Holy Spirit
[1:37:52] spoke tonight so clearly God knows what
[1:37:55] we have need of tonight and that right
[1:37:58] there if you can take that that reality
[1:38:00] right there to realize it's not your
[1:38:04] soul it's a spirit room it's your mind
[1:38:09] now the devil try to punch engine and
[1:38:13] his brother Brett says try to make you
[1:38:14] think that you're not seen but he says
[1:38:20] you know you're not what you used to you
[1:38:25] know you have believed every word
[1:38:31] Satan comes with him while the trying to
[1:38:34] try to get us to entertain even as was
[1:38:37] said this sickness this fear comes with
[1:38:40] this or this situation this with us and
[1:38:44] let us just say Lord and just commit
[1:38:47] myself to commit this situation it's in
[1:38:51] your hands
[1:38:53] same God who sought me out the same God
[1:38:56] brought me to him the same God who's
[1:38:59] done the work of my life that same God
[1:39:00] is working even now
[1:39:04] and there's one thing you can't do he
[1:39:07] can't fail him and he can't fail her the
[1:39:13] rabbit said he'll break your brains and
[1:39:16] you'll bankrupt heaven you keep one
[1:39:18] promise yes amen
[1:39:20] [Music]
