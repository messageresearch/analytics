[0:00] things in a moment and a twinkling of an
[0:03] eye
[0:05] and just as we're standing in that and
[0:08] expecting that hunt also comes with this
[0:11] promise a release of the anointing of
[0:14] the spirit of God where you and I are
[0:17] able to look at every opposition every
[0:20] obstacle no matter what it's been down
[0:22] through time we're able to stand there
[0:25] with a liberty and say who ought to hold
[0:28] great Mountain
[0:29] because the Rapture is not like a sieve
[0:33] in other words you're going in a Rapture
[0:35] and then everything just drops off of
[0:37] you that's not what the Rapture is
[0:39] well when the Rapture comes it'll just
[0:41] take me up through an elevator and I'll
[0:42] be a good boy and a good girl that's not
[0:44] what the Rapture is because brother
[0:45] random says it's so clear in recognizing
[0:47] his day in his message he said if you
[0:50] did if if you've got a you got a temper
[0:52] here you have a temper over there
[0:54] of course it won't be there
[0:56] because because the Rapture is a change
[1:00] of dwelling place it's not a seed that
[1:04] sifts everything away it's character
[1:08] that's being taken
[1:11] so in reality
[1:13] Satan has no ground to stand on
[1:18] but Samuel that's pretty bold that's
[1:20] where the word of God stands and we're
[1:22] standing with the word whoever is on the
[1:24] Lord's Side let him stand by me
[1:27] the word of God is here we're not here
[1:30] to pamper Satan we're here to address it
[1:34] I want you to notice who and thou who
[1:38] art thou old great mountain and thou
[1:41] shalt it's speaking to a being
[1:46] a being and that being is Satan
[1:51] that's what it's speaking to it's a
[1:53] Satan this is a spiritual
[1:55] Warfare in a battle now let me lay this
[1:58] in Ephesians 6 10 finally my brethren be
[2:01] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[2:04] His might
[2:05] put on the whole armor of God that you
[2:08] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[2:11] of the devil
[2:13] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[2:16] blood but against principalities against
[2:19] Powers against the rulers of the
[2:21] darkness of this world against spiritual
[2:24] wickedness in high places
[2:27] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[2:31] of God that you may be able to able to
[2:34] withstand in the evil day and having
[2:36] done all to stand so here it's speaking
[2:40] of a battle and the necessity to have
[2:44] the right equipment to fight this battle
[2:48] it's not a flesh and blood affair
[2:51] it is a spiritual battle there isn't a
[2:55] battle where there's an engagement
[2:56] between right and wrong between God and
[2:59] Satan and this battle has been going on
[3:02] down through every age
[3:05] and so just as much as the war is
[3:09] against principalities Powers spiritual
[3:12] wickedness in high places the whole
[3:14] armor of God is not something that is a
[3:18] flesh and blood origin or something that
[3:20] is outwardly but it is the armor of God
[3:23] which is God's word the holy spirit
[3:26] inside the life of the believer
[3:29] because he made a promise when the enemy
[3:32] comes in like a flood I the Lord will
[3:35] raise the standard against him
[3:39] and he makes the word more sure how can
[3:42] he make the word more sure
[3:44] well he'll he'll have debates debates
[3:46] don't make the word more sure
[3:48] come on debates can change a person's
[3:51] mind for a period of time but it's got
[3:53] to take something deeper than that and
[3:55] the standard we're talking about is when
[3:57] God himself his word his life comes down
[4:01] on the inside by the new birth then it
[4:04] is the standard of the word inside of
[4:06] our life
[4:10] here we are in this moment
[4:13] battles
[4:15] and remember that this battle
[4:17] that we are engaged in because we're
[4:19] engaged in it
[4:21] this battle the first battle was fought
[4:24] in heaven
[4:26] think of it in heaven
[4:29] not out in Skid Row alley in heaven
[4:34] Lucifer led a rebellion
[4:37] is that right
[4:38] and there were some angels that followed
[4:40] his lie
[4:42] right his tail not t-a-i-l the Bible
[4:46] says t-a-l-e he gathered him with his
[4:49] tail t-a-l-e his lie
[4:54] Satan gathers by lie God gathers by
[4:59] truth
[5:01] oh Hallelujah and this battle was thrown
[5:05] down to heaven
[5:06] and I want you to watch how the prophet
[5:08] says this this battle was thrown down
[5:11] from Heaven to Earth and it fell on
[5:13] human beings then the battle from Angels
[5:16] become human battles and Satan come to
[5:20] destroy God's creation what God had
[5:23] created to be for himself he Satan had
[5:26] come to destroy this that's what his
[5:29] purpose was was to destroy it remember
[5:32] that's his characteristic
[5:34] you can always evaluate when things want
[5:38] to come in your life I don't care if
[5:39] it's relationships I don't care if it's
[5:41] jobs I don't care what it is you need to
[5:44] look is this increasing my stature in
[5:48] the Lord or is it taken away
[5:51] come on Friends the devil's a slicker
[5:54] [Music]
[5:55] he's a slick tongue fella
[5:58] right smooth talker
[6:02] right he wanted to make her feel like
[6:05] she's somebody she's something he knows
[6:08] what he's doing
[6:09] but his intent and his purpose is
[6:12] destruction and you can look at and say
[6:14] well how do I know it's destruction what
[6:17] I'm feeling right now he felt pretty
[6:19] good when he was talking to her in the
[6:22] Garden of Eden but look at the
[6:23] destruction right now
[6:26] you and I have the pains in our body
[6:28] ambulances going up and down the street
[6:30] all because one listened to his lie
[6:34] and death entered in
[6:36] anything that reasons against the word
[6:40] of God is your enemy
[6:45] come on Friends anything that reasons
[6:48] against the word of God I'm talking to
[6:50] bride and material here this morning
[6:52] that's able to look there regardless of
[6:54] race Creed or color and evaluate things
[6:57] under the leading of the spirit of God
[6:59] is this adding to my life or taken away
[7:02] from my life I ain't talking about your
[7:04] personal life I'm talking about your
[7:06] life in Jesus Christ
[7:15] blessed Lord oh God help us this morning
[7:19] we're talking about an opposition
[7:23] are you with me I've seen too many
[7:25] things over the years where relationship
[7:27] s saying else take people right out of
[7:28] the house of God
[7:30] you know why they didn't never get
[7:32] really Anchored In Jesus Christ and it's
[7:35] to recognize you know let me tell you
[7:36] something you have to understand and
[7:38] know where you're at
[7:39] [Music]
[7:40] is that right this is why you don't go
[7:42] on the devil's Crown you have to know
[7:44] where you're at that ain't a sign of
[7:46] weakness
[7:48] that's a sign of knowing where you stand
[7:50] this is where I'm at and I'm not going
[7:52] on the Devil's Ground
[7:55] we've seen family have seen everything
[7:57] else you know what it all comes down to
[7:58] it's more than flesh and blood
[8:01] it's spirits
[8:06] oh glory be to God that was his purpose
[8:08] then the battle began here on Earth and
[8:11] it's beginning us it's been raging ever
[8:12] since so where is this battle
[8:16] where is this battle
[8:18] it's in the mind
[8:21] it's a Battleground the Battleground the
[8:23] mind is no man's land
[8:26] when they fight a battle there is a
[8:29] neutral place where you engage
[8:33] and the mind
[8:35] is the Battleground
[8:37] it's the Mind listen to me it's the mind
[8:39] that either accepts opens up and accepts
[8:43] what's coming or it closes and rejects
[8:47] are you hearing me now your mind
[8:51] oh my
[8:53] the mind is a gate it's just like if you
[8:56] have a gated community I know there's
[8:58] been you know things over the years you
[9:00] go to deliver things and you think I'm
[9:01] in a gated community and nobody's at the
[9:04] gate
[9:05] like you all had to go in a steel mill
[9:06] right right through a gate I don't even
[9:07] know if they put anybody out there
[9:08] anymore maybe they do
[9:10] but you understand that they don't they
[9:12] don't put nobody out there anymore
[9:14] what's a good having a gate
[9:17] right I mean if they had somebody come
[9:19] in there and do all sorts of things oh
[9:21] what happened you didn't stop them at
[9:23] the gate
[9:24] because in order to get through the gate
[9:26] they've gotta they've got work IDs
[9:29] you got to pass that off scan it or
[9:31] whatever they do you can't just get on
[9:33] they go through there
[9:35] but what happens become relaxed
[9:38] they come relax
[9:40] let me tell you something your mind my
[9:42] mind any of our mind you cannot become
[9:45] relaxed
[9:46] and Satan's Duty oh Satan's a misogynist
[9:50] just relax oh
[9:53] oh oh yeah right there oh that's Satan's
[9:57] Duty yeah
[9:59] to do to get it all
[10:01] take him down
[10:03] but when it comes notice it's your mind
[10:06] that opens or accepts it's your mind
[10:09] that opens the door or closes closes the
[10:12] door to listen to your conscience or
[10:14] your memory or your affections
[10:17] but when your mind closes itself and I
[10:19] want you to catch this when your mind
[10:21] closes itself to these things talking
[10:24] about
[10:24] to all of those other things conscience
[10:27] memory affection reason when it closes
[10:30] itself to whatever their whatever is
[10:32] trying to come through those Avenues
[10:34] when your mind closes itself to these
[10:36] things and let God the spirit of his
[10:40] word come in it blows the rest of the
[10:44] stuff out
[10:45] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[10:48] every sensation of Doubt is gone every
[10:52] feeling is gone man we could preach a
[10:54] Month of Sundays on that when the spirit
[10:57] of the word you let it come in you say
[11:00] what is that him that's speaking to you
[11:02] dealing with your life what do I do let
[11:05] accept him
[11:08] accepted him and let the spirit of the
[11:10] word remember I was one who was awakened
[11:14] I like one wake and out of my sleep it
[11:17] was an angel It's the spirit of God
[11:20] that's opening our understanding to
[11:23] things
[11:24] right where the words going forth we
[11:26] just don't want to set their numb but
[11:28] when he's dealing with us say Lord tell
[11:30] me what you're trying to show me
[11:33] to me Lord God because if he's touched
[11:36] you it's his desire to reveal it to you
[11:39] [Applause]
[11:44] I just read a quota even last night
[11:45] brother REM said you are a blessed
[11:48] person if God has come by your way and
[11:50] knocked on your heart he said do you
[11:52] realize there's people that will never
[11:55] receive that knock
[11:59] what must I do you can take that knock
[12:03] and walk with an authority and say every
[12:06] promise and everything that God has
[12:09] intended for my life he came looking for
[12:13] me
[12:17] halleluia
[12:18] [Applause]
[12:21] but the statement what's going on we're
[12:22] receiving the spirit of the word to blow
[12:25] out sensations of fear blow out doubt
[12:30] I don't know
[12:33] I'm telling there's power in this word
[12:36] there's power in the word of God the
[12:37] spirit of God gets a hold of that word
[12:39] there's power in it
[12:42] oh he's nothing he said there's nothing
[12:43] that can stand but there but the word of
[12:45] God and Satan cannot battle against that
[12:51] he said these battles has raged since
[12:52] the day of the Garden of Eden the battle
[12:55] in the human mind
[12:57] now let me read here in First
[12:58] Corinthians 11. notice how Paul picks
[13:01] this up
[13:02] went to God
[13:03] that you could bear with me a little in
[13:05] my folly
[13:06] and indeed bear with me
[13:08] for I am jealous over you
[13:11] with Godly jealousy
[13:13] for I have espoused you
[13:16] to one husband all right that I may
[13:18] present you as a Chase virgin
[13:21] to Christ
[13:24] but I fear
[13:26] lest by any means as the serpent
[13:30] beguiled Eve through his subility now
[13:34] notice how did the beguiling come
[13:37] through his subtility
[13:42] show your minds
[13:46] should be corrupted for
[13:49] corrupted from so corruption sets in by
[13:53] what the satility and it corrupts us
[13:56] from
[13:57] something
[14:00] corrupted from the simplicity
[14:04] that is in Christ
[14:06] can you say that with me the Simplicity
[14:09] that is in Christ
[14:12] for in he that cometh
[14:15] preacher
[14:17] another Jesus
[14:20] if they live in another Jesus
[14:23] come on now the Bible said use words
[14:26] when necessary otherwise your life
[14:28] preaches a sermon
[14:31] right if they preach another Jesus
[14:36] whom we have not preached all right or
[14:39] if you receive another spirit
[14:42] which he have not received or another
[14:44] gospel
[14:46] which you have not accepted so they've
[14:49] already accepted what is true but what
[14:51] Paul was letting them know that that
[14:54] Satan is not going to rest
[14:59] remember when he gathered all the the
[15:01] pastors around there and acts before his
[15:04] departure he said he said Satan is
[15:07] Desiring to come in as Grievous wolves
[15:10] among the flock now let me just tell you
[15:13] something Satan's not a lazy guy the
[15:14] Bible pogles on the talking about how
[15:17] that his Ministers of they transformed
[15:19] themselves to be angels of light like
[15:22] whoa I got new understanding but if it's
[15:25] understanding that's against the word of
[15:27] God you better forsake it you better
[15:30] call it a lie and you better run as fast
[15:32] as you can because it's not Liberty it's
[15:36] not understanding it's a lie it's
[15:38] deceived and will damn your soul to hell
[15:42] that's how powerful it is and I know
[15:44] hell isn't even preached on within
[15:47] churches no more because you know why
[15:49] there's some of them that have even
[15:50] preached it that it's done away with
[15:52] what nonsense
[15:54] hell is still real
[15:57] but the Bible said hell was created for
[15:59] the devil and his angels
[16:03] for human beings
[16:05] not for lives to go there
[16:08] amen but remember there was one and
[16:11] Jesus spoke of that rich young man
[16:14] that when he turned down his opportunity
[16:16] he lifted up his eyes in him
[16:21] are you hearing me now
[16:23] they're one of the guy that this guy
[16:25] that would lift up his eyes and hell
[16:26] wasn't a guy on Skid Row
[16:28] this was a guy who knew verses from
[16:30] Sunday School
[16:33] let's just stay with this
[16:35] for him to come and preacheth another
[16:37] Jesus let me just go on this is what
[16:39] you're in the the we are to do last part
[16:42] of it ye might well bear with him in
[16:45] other words endure it stand against it
[16:55] it's hard not to preach on every point
[16:59] but I'm talking about this some
[17:00] Simplicity now corrupted from the
[17:02] Simplicity that is in Christ
[17:06] corruption itself you you know you've
[17:08] seen things in some of you in the
[17:10] Medical Science and everything else too
[17:11] you know this corruption sets in little
[17:13] by little
[17:15] right and then eventually it's like we
[17:17] need to take that off
[17:19] hmm what's going on corruption
[17:22] it sets in little by little by little
[17:27] right
[17:29] remember I had a
[17:31] an individual one time a young man
[17:33] I'm about 12 years old
[17:35] he had this there you know he kind of
[17:38] had a cut on his leg you know how kids I
[17:40] mean I thought about it myself I thought
[17:41] man how many times I picked scabs you
[17:43] know I know it's not beautiful to talk
[17:45] about but you just stay with me okay
[17:49] the problem of it is he got into picking
[17:51] it because they itch sometimes
[17:53] right but all that itching and all that
[17:56] stuff is all part of healing going on
[17:58] but he would get to start picking that
[18:01] but the scab is also there it signifies
[18:05] healing's taking place and when it's
[18:08] finished the scab will come off
[18:12] are you hearing me
[18:14] oh my
[18:15] God glory be to God
[18:17] but he had they end up having to put him
[18:19] in the hospital for Mercer
[18:21] because he kept picking the scabs and
[18:23] infection set in y'all talking about a
[18:25] young man 12 13 years old they didn't
[18:28] know may have to end up making him
[18:29] taking his leg off just from a simple
[18:32] scab
[18:34] of picking at something and Corruption
[18:36] sets in that's how simple corruption is
[18:39] in our life but there is one
[18:44] who deals with corruption you don't have
[18:47] to pick at it he's a Healer
[18:51] [Applause]
[18:53] he not only come to set the captive free
[18:55] he not only is here to bind up the
[18:57] Brokenhearted
[18:58] but he's also to heal them that are
[19:01] bruised
[19:04] yes ma'am man oh man
[19:07] I wish I had a Month of Sundays to
[19:09] preach right now at this moment
[19:16] and I want you to understand this
[19:19] Satan's desire is to hinder or stop the
[19:22] move of God in your life
[19:27] he'd like to stop it and you're like I
[19:29] don't care who you are I don't care who
[19:31] I am he wants to stop it I don't care
[19:33] where you are in your journey his
[19:35] objective is to stop it
[19:37] yeah he knows let me tell you something
[19:40] he knows that he can't stop the work of
[19:43] the Holy Spirit but he wants to minimize
[19:44] the effect and the work of the Holy
[19:46] Spirit
[19:48] I know that once again I wanted to refer
[19:50] to a few scriptures here the Bible says
[19:52] in first John 4 1 Believe beloved
[19:54] believe not every Spirit but try the
[19:56] spirits whether they are of God
[19:59] because many false prophets are gone out
[20:01] into the world trium whether they're of
[20:03] God not whether or not I felt good
[20:05] who
[20:07] good Lord when I took a shower I feel
[20:09] good
[20:10] when I when I eat something I like apple
[20:12] crisp I feel good
[20:15] when I ain't talking about the song
[20:16] either
[20:17] yeah you feel good about certain things
[20:19] but it ain't about feelings
[20:22] Satan can bring corruption just because
[20:25] of feelings
[20:29] because many false prophets are going
[20:31] out into the world hereby know you the
[20:33] spirit of God every spirit that
[20:37] confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
[20:40] the flesh is of God
[20:43] this is not talking about 2 000 years
[20:47] ago he's the same Lord Jesus in a
[20:51] many-membered body
[20:53] to deny the Holy Ghost
[20:56] is a sign that's an evil spirit
[21:00] [Applause]
[21:02] he's the same God does the same things
[21:06] acts the same way
[21:09] his death didn't stop him
[21:12] Acts chapter 1 verse 1 of Theophilus the
[21:16] things that Jesus began to do and the
[21:19] prophet picks it up in the token and
[21:21] says and continues to do because his
[21:24] death didn't stop him it's Jesus Christ
[21:28] the same yesterday today and forever
[21:35] same God
[21:39] that's why even every believer down
[21:41] through every age did not just look back
[21:43] at the messenger but they recognized
[21:45] that what God did through the messenger
[21:47] it was a message that was being spoken a
[21:51] message that was being lived a message
[21:53] that was being released for them
[21:58] and every spirit
[22:00] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
[22:03] come in the flesh
[22:06] help me now
[22:07] is not of God
[22:13] and that is the spirit
[22:15] of antichrist
[22:19] not anti-word
[22:21] oh no they told the Bible but Antichrist
[22:25] because you can have all the word you
[22:27] want but if you don't have the spirit of
[22:30] the word and the spirit of God this is
[22:32] nothing but a dead letter
[22:35] but it takes the spirit to bring it to
[22:38] life
[22:39] come on now the law was a good thing but
[22:42] it takes the spirit in order to bring
[22:44] the word to life this ministry of the
[22:47] spirit of God is the glory that
[22:50] excellence
[22:51] you know why because it's not bringing
[22:53] Just conviction conviction it's God
[22:55] coming in and rewriting lives
[23:01] Jude chapter 1 verse 3.
[23:04] beloved when I gave all diligence
[23:06] carefulness to write unto you of the
[23:07] common salvation it was needful for me
[23:10] to write unto you and exhort you that
[23:12] you should earnestly contend for the
[23:15] faith which was once delivered to the
[23:17] Saints
[23:19] thank you
[23:23] I tell you what you're going to fight
[23:24] for something
[23:26] don't tell me oh I'm not a fighter
[23:28] you're a liar you'll fight for something
[23:31] sometimes you can take people be a man
[23:33] there'll be a passive could be touch
[23:34] their children they'll fight buddy
[23:36] even if their children is wrong as wrong
[23:38] can be they'll fight
[23:40] come on now but there's some things that
[23:43] we need to really contend for
[23:48] yep come on and Lord we need the Relic
[23:50] content for is the faith that was once
[23:53] delivered so if there had this was a
[23:56] faith that was delivered it was a faith
[23:58] that was not there but what was the
[24:01] faith that was delivered was the Holy
[24:03] Ghost
[24:05] that's the faith that's what comes in
[24:08] and moves our faith
[24:13] there's some things we need to fight for
[24:16] yeah
[24:18] I think we need to fight for families
[24:20] but fight for them in the right way
[24:22] and don't come under this anointing of
[24:24] this age out here at people's rights
[24:27] come on preach
[24:29] don't come out there with all this but
[24:31] we need to fight for what's right
[24:33] we need to fight with what on our knees
[24:36] when situations want to come in the home
[24:38] we need to go to God In Prayer
[24:40] we need to look to God he's a mighty God
[24:43] to address that need to address that
[24:45] situation
[24:49] not oh well they're just teenagers you
[24:51] need a whooping
[24:53] forgive me but I'll be a pastor you need
[24:55] a whooping for that that's a cop-out God
[24:58] don't need a bunch of cop
[25:01] come on now he don't need men that are
[25:03] being derelict in their Duty either he
[25:04] needs somebody that'll lead the house be
[25:07] an example
[25:09] come on my Lord have mercy the preacher
[25:12] came home this morning
[25:14] it's a time you've got to step up
[25:16] there's things that you've got to fight
[25:18] for it but in this
[25:20] it's an age that has stripped men to be
[25:22] no more than passive sissies
[25:26] you know why because it's the spirit
[25:28] that's upon it
[25:30] and a real man don't treat a woman like
[25:32] a doormat either a real man don't treat
[25:34] a woman like a sex object a real man he
[25:37] values that woman he don't touch her
[25:40] until he has accepted and walked down
[25:43] the aisle that's a real man
[25:45] [Music]
[25:47] foreign
[25:49] Hallelujah
[25:51] that's what I'm talking about a real man
[25:52] I'm talking about Godly standards I'm
[25:54] talking about biblical standards
[25:56] [Applause]
[26:01] my mama
[26:03] verse 4 and there are certain men that
[26:06] have crept in unawares
[26:11] just slipped in unaware
[26:14] they slept right in Undercover
[26:17] yeah we believe just like you believe
[26:20] yeah they crept in
[26:22] the Bible you know why they didn't come
[26:24] in the right way
[26:26] right if you come in the right way you
[26:27] got to come through the door
[26:29] and if you come through the door and you
[26:31] come through the door and that's Jesus
[26:32] Christ and he is the word and that's why
[26:36] we stand as Believers if it can't come
[26:38] through the word then it ain't for me
[26:46] mama
[26:48] maybe it would have been better if we
[26:50] just said amen after we read the text
[26:52] huh
[26:54] you don't help us
[26:56] I said it'll help us
[26:59] who were before
[27:00] ordained to this ordained to this
[27:02] condemnation ungodly men
[27:05] notice there it was already going in
[27:08] this direction already ordained to this
[27:10] God never made him go this way it was
[27:12] their choices God already saw their
[27:15] choices from before the foundation of
[27:17] the world
[27:19] wonder how many times some of these
[27:20] these same men that had crept in
[27:22] unawares set and heard the message the
[27:25] faith being preached
[27:26] yeah I wonder how many of them heard it
[27:28] knew about it
[27:30] but never submitted themselves to it
[27:34] ungodly men turning notice turning the
[27:39] grace of our God into
[27:41] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[27:45] God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[27:50] turning the grace my Lord
[27:54] now I want you to think about this
[27:57] foreign
[27:58] when we look at anointing here let me
[28:01] just try to get to a place here this
[28:02] morning
[28:04] Satan as we said moments ago he
[28:08] transforms his
[28:10] ministers that's what the Bible says his
[28:13] ministers Satan's got a Ministry team
[28:17] he's got a Ministry team and they're not
[28:19] lazy they're deceitful workers
[28:24] they work Buddy
[28:26] they are false Apostles in other words
[28:31] they have not been sent by God
[28:37] because a true Apostle is one who is
[28:39] sent by God
[28:41] can I preach just for a moment
[28:43] when the Holy Spirit has come into your
[28:45] life oh I just heard the prophet here
[28:47] this week tell us he said when the Holy
[28:49] Spirit has come into your life you have
[28:51] become a pilgrim and a stranger he said
[28:53] God is sending you forth as an apostle
[28:56] you are running with a message from the
[29:00] throne
[29:01] [Applause]
[29:06] with him
[29:08] glory be to God
[29:10] and but Satan comes and he anoints his
[29:14] servants because I want you to talk I
[29:15] want to look here just a little bit
[29:17] about anointing Satan anoints his
[29:20] servants
[29:21] and what does he anoint them with
[29:24] unbelief
[29:26] Satan and his demons anoints Humanity to
[29:30] disbelieve God's word
[29:35] now he won't come in and say the Bible's
[29:37] a lie
[29:39] but what he wants to do is is
[29:41] misconstrue it or take away the effect
[29:44] of it and
[29:45] well God really didn't mean that
[29:49] God really don't mean that you know
[29:51] we've we've learned better now
[29:53] we've got we've got some things that
[29:57] God really don't he's not going to be
[29:58] angry with you
[30:00] you know he's a sweet
[30:02] Jesus
[30:04] everything just sweet sweet sweet sweet
[30:07] sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet
[30:07] sweet
[30:09] but they're not other attributes in his
[30:13] life
[30:14] there's other attributes
[30:17] he is a god of judgment
[30:20] he is the god of his word
[30:23] he is a father
[30:25] he's not a Papal a poppy a grandpa or
[30:28] whatever more that lets you know man let
[30:30] him get by with certain things and just
[30:32] say well we'll just keep this here at
[30:34] Grandpa's house no at God's house
[30:38] he is our father and judgment begins at
[30:42] the house of God
[30:44] [Applause]
[30:46] there's a standard of the word he calls
[30:49] us to
[30:50] but Satan calls Eve that doesn't he just
[30:54] to kind of misconstrue it a little bit I
[30:57] want you to think about this here just
[30:58] for a moment
[31:00] you know when you think of how
[31:03] brother Brown would go on to say it like
[31:04] this he says I want you to look at how
[31:06] nasty he gets how he whitewashes the
[31:09] word that's I'll tell you that's
[31:10] something when I it just caught me the
[31:12] other day I'm looking at it look how
[31:13] nasty he gets isn't it amazing that some
[31:16] of the things that we can look at and
[31:19] we wouldn't necessarily maybe call that
[31:21] Satan tampering the with the word him
[31:24] getting nasty
[31:28] now come on now
[31:30] some of you after God got a hold of your
[31:32] life there are certain things that you
[31:33] remember that boy seem real well this
[31:35] thing seems really innocent you go back
[31:37] after God's delivered you go back and
[31:39] there's certain things that you thought
[31:40] when you were in the world that were man
[31:42] this was harmless you go back and
[31:43] hopefully you're like that was in there
[31:45] wow that was what's happened what's
[31:48] happened what changed
[31:51] changed
[31:53] what happened in here
[31:55] now it's
[31:57] nasty
[31:59] look how nasty he gets boy it raises it
[32:02] to a whole different level right what's
[32:04] he trying to do get into her mind
[32:08] he's talking to her I want you to watch
[32:10] this he's talking to her after the word
[32:14] has already fortified there
[32:17] wow so Satan doesn't look and say oh
[32:19] he's fortified oh
[32:22] the devil keeps trying
[32:25] now don't you let notice don't you let
[32:28] Satan fortify nothing you keep God's
[32:32] word fortified
[32:34] in your heart
[32:38] so
[32:39] you mean brother Samuel that I'm not a
[32:42] pushover no you're not
[32:44] you're not
[32:45] so don't let the devil paint that
[32:47] picture to you that you're a pushover
[32:49] because you're not
[32:51] it's what you allow
[32:54] it's what you allow
[32:55] don't let Satan fortify anything
[33:00] he wants to bring his Lumber wants to
[33:02] bring his building material wants to
[33:03] bring his accusations pass on by
[33:07] you got the wrong lot
[33:10] you're not building a storage shed here
[33:13] pass it on by come on friends I'm
[33:16] talking about in the mind pass it on by
[33:19] you got the wrong lock yeah no no no no
[33:22] no no no isn't this so-and-so's isn't
[33:25] this such and such a dress now well
[33:26] you've got the right physical address
[33:28] but the guy who ordered that don't live
[33:30] here
[33:33] right on down the street because I'm
[33:34] sure you got the wrong person
[33:39] don't let him fortify nothing
[33:45] you keep God's word
[33:48] fortified in your heart
[33:52] now watch out brother Branham I'm gonna
[33:54] come back up and pick this up
[34:06] what's he trying to do
[34:09] to this woman
[34:11] to Eve he's trying to anoint that
[34:13] precious woman there God's daughter with
[34:16] an unbelief in God's word
[34:19] and brother Brown turns to some
[34:22] to a little sister and turns to others
[34:24] that's how the greatest battle ever
[34:25] fought he says you realize he says honey
[34:28] he was even talking to a little girl
[34:30] that was there had a need
[34:32] he said that's what he's trying to get
[34:33] each of you to do out there is to anoint
[34:36] you
[34:39] Satan is trying to anoint you
[34:42] he'd like to anoint me
[34:48] he'd like to anoint us
[34:52] yes and the only thing you have to do
[34:55] you're a free moral agent
[34:57] right did you catch that you're a free
[35:00] moral agent
[35:01] you have a choice I have a choice
[35:04] now you can accept that if you want to
[35:07] yeah
[35:09] yeah right but kick it out
[35:13] if Eve hadn't stopped that moment to
[35:15] listen don't stop for nothing
[35:23] let me get back to the trying to come to
[35:25] this point here
[35:27] we'll try to type let me just try to
[35:29] find this point and just try to close on
[35:31] this this moment
[35:33] you know in the scripture here was Micah
[35:36] right
[35:38] Mike I got called into a situation and
[35:40] brother Ram's picking up right here in
[35:41] this spot and he keeps on in this
[35:43] particular quote you're a Micah you're a
[35:46] Micah you're a Micah now remember Micah
[35:50] or Micaiah however you want to say it
[35:53] he got brought into a situation where
[35:56] he's outnumbered
[35:59] and I'm telling you he's severely
[36:00] outnumbered matter of fact when they
[36:03] went to go get him
[36:04] he had strict orders
[36:07] we're going to let you join our coffee
[36:08] Club but don't you be talking none of
[36:10] that stuff
[36:12] don't you be doing none of that
[36:15] you can come be a part of this but don't
[36:18] you be talking on that stuff you say
[36:20] only good things about the king wow so
[36:23] in other words to Micah don't you go by
[36:25] inspiration of God
[36:26] we just want you to speak good things
[36:29] when you speak you might want to put
[36:31] some powdered sugar on your lips make
[36:33] sure you gurgle with Sweet Water sweet
[36:36] tea so when you speak it's just
[36:39] sweetness
[36:41] over the whole bunch
[36:45] so Micah got up there and you know the
[36:47] story
[36:50] Michael told him he said I'm only going
[36:52] to say what God puts in my mouth to say
[36:56] [Applause]
[36:58] it's what you wanted
[37:00] you asked me to come
[37:02] but see it was Jehoshaphat
[37:04] yeah hear me now
[37:06] Jehoshaphat was a real believer
[37:09] real believer but he got into a cold
[37:12] moment
[37:13] bye bye come on let's let's deal with
[37:16] the devil right now he got into a cold
[37:18] moment
[37:19] he got into a pact or an agreement that
[37:22] he should never have got into
[37:26] but look at the mercy of God he knows
[37:30] how to get his children out of trouble
[37:34] no doubt Joshua was there remember what
[37:37] he was under there he had word that was
[37:39] given to him hey we're all Israelites
[37:43] This Is Our Land
[37:44] remember all I guarantee you Ahab was
[37:47] quoting scripture you remember one shall
[37:49] put a thousand to fly two shall put ten
[37:52] ten thousand he was quoting the
[37:54] scriptures what was he doing isn't it
[37:56] amazing how family and others can bring
[37:58] scriptures and quotes and not just
[38:00] family others and just want to bring
[38:01] condemnation I thought you was a
[38:03] Christian
[38:06] but Christians don't compromise
[38:10] they still stand with the word
[38:12] [Music]
[38:12] [Applause]
[38:15] woo
[38:19] here he is oh this has been laid on him
[38:22] but how did Jehoshaphat here he is
[38:24] there's something that moves out of his
[38:26] heart
[38:26] that says ain't you got one more
[38:31] ain't you got one what was it
[38:34] Jehoshaphat only needed one where
[38:42] and even a believer that might be down
[38:44] and maybe has made me good packs or
[38:47] other things they shouldn't have done
[38:48] but a Believer only needs one word from
[38:52] almighty God
[38:56] thank you
[38:57] the least of this morning that we could
[39:00] do is say God have you got a word for me
[39:03] Lord
[39:03] [Applause]
[39:07] he's not here to shame us he's here to
[39:10] loosen
[39:15] he knows you are but flesh he's here to
[39:18] loosen You by his word
[39:22] faith and anoints with unbelief
[39:26] misconstring the word but the spirit of
[39:29] God takes those word under the true
[39:32] anointing and he works with a son and
[39:34] daughter of God and he lifts them right
[39:37] back up and they come right back into
[39:39] fellowship with him
[39:41] because you know why it's the goodness
[39:43] of God they'll be sitting right there
[39:45] listening to the word of God and right
[39:47] there in their heart they're repenting
[39:48] the whole time and they keep on climbing
[39:50] under the anointing of God you know why
[39:52] it's a spirit of God if it is they're
[39:55] just not one more
[39:56] [Applause]
[39:59] [Music]
[40:00] Micah came up there
[40:04] when Micah entered
[40:06] he was not the favored
[40:09] as a matter of fact why is she here
[40:13] I hate him you better not say nothing
[40:14] bad about me
[40:15] better not
[40:18] but Micah
[40:20] was really brought there
[40:22] for the call that was going forth in
[40:24] jehoshaphat's life
[40:25] [Music]
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:27] they thought they went and got him yeah
[40:30] God brought him there because one of his
[40:32] children need to come under the right
[40:34] anointing
[40:36] he had come under the anointing of
[40:37] cooperation consolidating into one image
[40:41] we're all alike we're all Israelites he
[40:44] come under that anointing to form the
[40:47] image unto the Beast
[40:48] he was that anointing was on but
[40:50] remember the spirit of God comes before
[40:52] he can never get into that
[40:54] come on now the message of the hour
[40:57] speaks to you and I if
[40:59] that image
[41:01] that's why I called us out of Babylon
[41:06] he still calls us out of packs and
[41:08] everything else
[41:09] [Applause]
[41:10] but here stands Micah
[41:13] all these thoughts that are on around
[41:14] him but Micah stood there
[41:17] with the word of God
[41:19] yeah
[41:20] and you're a mica
[41:22] this morning
[41:25] surrounded by thoughts
[41:28] obstacles all around
[41:30] opposition
[41:32] but the word of God is for you
[41:35] the word of God is greater
[41:38] than what you think about you
[41:42] the word of God is greater
[41:45] it's greater than all of your might your
[41:48] power your struggles it's greater
[41:52] the word of God is greater than all
[41:53] unbelief
[41:54] it's his anointing that comes right into
[41:58] the building
[42:00] just as Satan anoints I can't get to
[42:02] this but just as Satan comes to anoint
[42:05] God also comes to it
[42:09] God comes to anoint and he sends angels
[42:13] his servants as a flame of fire
[42:17] to those who are The Heirs of salvation
[42:21] and they come with the spirit of the
[42:24] word to anoint you to anoint us
[42:28] to do what Lift Us
[42:31] what's the way out of this the anointing
[42:33] will lead you
[42:35] the anointing of the spirit of God it'll
[42:37] Lead You Out
[42:39] it's the spirit of God that breaks every
[42:43] hope
[42:47] no matter what it's been
[42:49] who art thou oh great Mountain I wish I
[42:52] had more time
[42:53] I I need I need some hours here just to
[42:56] finish the laying this in
[42:58] but I know I'm a pastor I can come back
[43:01] and we we we would just get right back
[43:03] at it but
[43:05] it's to me this is between life and
[43:07] death
[43:10] but God lays out for you and I all I can
[43:13] see is is Victory
[43:16] that's all I see is Victory
[43:18] all I see is Deliverance all I see is
[43:21] who art to our great Mountain
[43:24] you that would want to stand and before
[43:28] God's people and accuse you who that
[43:30] would want to hold back who are you all
[43:34] right
[43:35] or opposition or obstacle before
[43:38] zerubbable in the presence of Jesus
[43:41] Christ in the presence of the anointing
[43:44] of Jesus Christ you shall become
[43:55] all it is
[43:57] God releasing
[43:59] God that anointing you know what the
[44:00] anointing does it breaks the spirit
[44:03] that's wanting to bring over your life
[44:04] those thoughts are not just thoughts
[44:06] there's not a dictionary flapping near
[44:08] you and releasing words it's spirits
[44:11] right it's spirits
[44:14] when thoughts come in it's Spirits
[44:17] that's wanting to whisper and that's why
[44:19] you cannot entertain them can't take it
[44:22] in
[44:22] you got to stand with the word nowhere
[44:25] you stand with the word and you stand
[44:27] right there
[44:32] something has come your way disease
[44:34] Affliction whatever it is it's a spirit

[45:08] of God is Jesus Christ and when Jesus
[45:11] Christ is exalted he exalts his people

[46:53] high priest

[46:57] your sickness I refuse to look at lime
[46:59] vanities

[47:04] promises made by a positive God that's
[47:06] made alive in me whether by a positive
[47:08] token I am going to confess he's my
[47:11] healer he's my deliverer He's My

[48:31] God that Lord has come in here this
[48:33] morning Lord father to minister Lord to
[48:37] every heart Lord to strengthen every
[48:40] Micah Lord that we would stand Lord
[48:44] under that true anointing lord of the
[48:47] message that you have sent to us as
[48:50] Micah could stand there he was under
[48:52] that anointing of the spirit of God that
[48:55] had come through the message of Elijah
[48:57] and he stood there Lord with the
[48:59] sureness with the strength and the
[49:01] inspiration as he stood with that word
[49:04] in his heart he stood upon that word and
[49:07] as he stood there there was one of your
[49:09] children by the name of Jehoshaphat that
[49:11] needed a word from the Lord and as he
[49:14] stood with that word he might have
[49:16] fumbled with his words at first in a
[49:18] text but then came the anointing the
[49:21] inspiration of God that would move down
[49:24] through that word that was in his heart
[49:25] and would speak to the heart of
[49:27] Jehoshaphat Lord I believe this morning
[49:30] you have spoken to hearts Lord
[49:33] you have spoken Lord to lives that God
[49:36] even Hearts can look around this morning

[54:09] upon your life that no matter all of
[54:11] these floods of doubts and everything
[54:12] else can come your way isn't it amazing
[54:15] how Satan can take scriptures and take
[54:17] quotes and if he gets a hold of them
[54:19] it'll bring fear it'll bring
[54:21] condemnation but you let the spirit of
[54:23] God get a hold of that same word through
[54:25] a man of God watch what will happen it
[54:27] don't bring fear and condemnation you
[54:28] know it does it says this is the way out
[54:30] it begins to lift you right up why it's
[54:33] the anointing
[54:34] of the spirit of God
[54:37] and it's the anointing that breaks the
[54:39] yoke
[54:41] it breaks the yoke
[54:43] hallelujah oh I love him don't you

[54:53] preacher
[54:55] but you're living you're living what
[54:56] you're a manner
[54:58] amen hallelujah I'm not picking speaking
[54:59] to people without an experience I'm
[55:02] speaking to people that know this by
[55:03] experience and you watch how the spirit
[55:05] of God will begin to go and deal with
[55:07] hearts and deal with lies what does he
[55:08] do he uncovers Satan's working
[55:13] I'm glad that there is one who's bigger
[55:15] than me bigger than you he's bigger
[55:18] aren't you
[55:19] I'm glad that he can go right down and
[55:21] he can just take the cover right off the
[55:24] devil
[55:27] and you know what happens brother Rocco
[55:28] when that cover gets taken off the devil
[55:30] he does the same thing for me and you of
[55:32] what it's going to do for those leaders
[55:34] of the Nations on the other side when
[55:37] they stand and look and say
[55:40] you're the man
[55:42] you're the guy you're the one that's
[55:45] caused all these trouble
[55:48] you know why he's been brought right
[55:50] down
[55:51] and there's one thing that'll bring him
[55:53] down where he belongs
[55:56] and that is
[55:58] the anointing of the spirit of God by
[56:01] the word
[56:03] you say what do you mean where he
[56:05] belongs let me just say it pretty simple
[56:09] if the devil is out from under your feet
[56:12] he's out of his position
[56:17] it puts him right back
[56:20] right back in his position
[56:24] no matter whatever the whole sin
[56:26] indifference disease the spirit of God
[56:28] uncovers is working
[56:34] the movie can rise
[56:37] in the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[56:39] rise into our position
[56:43] Hallelujah
[56:45] oh thank God
[56:49] I know God's done some wonderful things
[56:50] right here this morning
[56:53] I want you to be in prayer this week as
[56:55] well
[56:57] let's be in prayer because I believe
[56:58] there's yotes to be broken
[57:01] [Music]
[57:05] sometimes you think of just a little
[57:06] thought sometimes it drops on your heart
[57:08] like here was on Friday morning little
[57:10] thing it starts out
[57:12] and I know how he's dealt with me in
[57:13] times past but I don't know are you
[57:15] dealing with me that for here for
[57:17] meeting what what's what is it is it for
[57:19] right now
[57:20] spirit of God just kept on building
[57:21] building praise God hallelujah then of
[57:25] course just so you understand
[57:27] how that the enemy would want to try to
[57:28] work why
[57:30] that's so simple you're right
[57:33] the people won't be able to stay with
[57:34] you on that and that's so simple there
[57:37] but you see
[57:39] there's been a little bit of training
[57:40] that I've been through a little bit
[57:42] I think right now I'm probably in
[57:44] kindergarten I made it through preschool
[57:45] right now all right I've told you before
[57:47] if you ever put a sign back there that
[57:49] says Pastor make sure you put in letters
[57:51] underneath it in training
[57:54] because really I'm his associate
[57:56] he's our pastor
[57:58] [Music]
[57:59] he's our pastor
[58:01] you take him out of a picture how to
[58:03] have there's nothing
[58:05] what could I do
[58:08] but he's the pastor
[58:09] yes
[58:11] but one little thing and he starts
[58:13] building and building aren't you glad
[58:17] yes aren't you glad yes and I opened a
[58:20] little bit like that to you that's the
[58:22] same way he'll try to work on you right
[58:23] setting in a service
[58:25] or you'll never get beyond that you'll
[58:27] never overcome that you'll never
[58:30] you'd really don't understand it this is
[58:32] what should I do stand right there amen
[58:36] him that has awakened you as one who was
[58:40] asleep
[58:41] and say Lord what are you saying to me
[58:45] speak my Lord yeah here's your servant
[58:48] here's your son here's your daughter say
[58:52] on my lord I can't make out what I'm
[58:54] seeing I could maybe look at it but Lord
[58:56] what are you saying all right
[58:59] and the same one that comes by and
[59:01] touches you and awakens you to wear
[59:04] things you know how it is when you're
[59:05] looking at a picture and you're sitting
[59:06] there at an art museum and you look and
[59:07] you're like
[59:10] you come back over this way and
[59:12] sometimes you you know you you're trying
[59:14] to find what perspective right right
[59:16] you're trying to find that right
[59:18] but you know brother Brian once you see
[59:19] it in the picture
[59:21] every time you walk past that picture
[59:24] yes that's all you can see
[59:27] that's all you can see
[59:29] and then you become messengers of what
[59:34] you see in the picture
[59:36] you've been worked to try to get others
[59:38] seeing that same thing that you see
[59:43] why because you see something and you're
[59:46] telling them look away look
[59:54] no wonder when brother Randall said when
[59:55] you once see
[59:57] the message
[59:59] you can't see nothing else
[1:00:03] foreign
[1:00:10] you know who you see Jesus Christ
[1:00:13] that's all I see I I don't see nothing
[1:00:16] but Jesus Christ
[1:00:18] I see him the Victorious Christ that's
[1:00:20] all I see
[1:00:22] the mighty conqueror
[1:00:24] and you know what we're seeing him
[1:00:26] was seeing him then as I keep looking
[1:00:29] I keep looking looking unto Jesus the
[1:00:31] author I'm finishing my faith I keep
[1:00:32] looking you know what i is I see me I
[1:00:36] say I'm a Son of God I see I'm a
[1:00:38] daughter of God no it didn't matter how
[1:00:40] I came into this world didn't matter
[1:00:42] what family didn't matter all that I am
[1:00:44] a son and daughter of God I come from
[1:00:45] God and I'm going back to God
[1:00:52] what's open to me to see that
[1:00:56] the anointing
[1:00:58] of the spirit of God
[1:01:00] who is it the same Pillar of Fire
[1:01:03] he's right here the same Angel of the
[1:01:05] Lord
[1:01:06] he's right here he's the one not brother
[1:01:08] Samuel not any other minister it's him
[1:01:11] that opens our eyes Flesh and Blood hath
[1:01:15] not revealed these things unto you but
[1:01:18] my Father which is in heaven
[1:01:21] and notice if he's revealed he's letting
[1:01:24] you know I'm your father
[1:01:27] you are my son you are my daughter
[1:01:32] because the secret things thank you Holy
[1:01:34] Spirit
[1:01:35] secret things
[1:01:37] belonging to the Lord
[1:01:39] and those things that he has revealed
[1:01:42] belong unto us and to our children and
[1:01:45] to our children's children
[1:01:47] he's revealed the secret things
[1:01:52] oh my don't you love me just bathe in
[1:01:55] this anointing
[1:01:57] he just let it just saturate amen oh
[1:02:00] brother Sammy no no listen what brings
[1:02:02] change
[1:02:03] the anointing
[1:02:05] of the spirit of God
[1:02:08] when a seed is planted in the ground if
[1:02:11] it just stays there like that it's all
[1:02:12] hard
[1:02:13] but if it can receive and allow that
[1:02:17] water to come down I've watched them in
[1:02:18] class I put them
[1:02:20] put them in little little baggies
[1:02:23] little baggies to put them bean seeds in
[1:02:25] with little baggies you put brown paper
[1:02:26] on them not even dirt but Brown you know
[1:02:28] that hard stuff they call paper towels
[1:02:30] you won't soak it with water and I put
[1:02:33] it around the bean seed it I don't I
[1:02:35] don't know if you all did this or not
[1:02:36] but I put this under there and you know
[1:02:38] what happens after a couple days all you
[1:02:40] got to do from where that wet paper
[1:02:42] towel has been around
[1:02:44] that seed eventually you take that paper
[1:02:47] towel apart right there the paper towel
[1:02:49] has acted like dirt you know what the
[1:02:51] dirt does it just keeps the moisture up
[1:02:53] around the seat
[1:02:54] and that old hard seat coat that's all
[1:02:57] around that bean seed
[1:02:59] you can take it and it just flakes right
[1:03:01] on
[1:03:02] and there's a little itty bitty green
[1:03:06] sprout
[1:03:07] that has come right out of that sea
[1:03:11] you know what that is because it's been
[1:03:13] right in absorbing
[1:03:15] the moisture
[1:03:17] it's absorbing the moisture
[1:03:21] no wonder brother Graham said
[1:03:23] you take a son and daughter of God
[1:03:26] they're built to absorb the moisture of
[1:03:30] the Holy Spirit
[1:03:32] and what does it do when we absorb it
[1:03:35] turns to be a son and daughter of God
[1:03:37] it releases what's on the inside what's
[1:03:39] the anointing doing it's releasing
[1:03:41] what's on the inside
[1:03:45] oh my what a presence
[1:03:47] what a presence here amen we're we're in
[1:03:51] the presence all things are impossible
[1:03:53] to them that believe
[1:03:55] we're in his presence right now
[1:03:58] I believe you've got a need right now
[1:03:59] just submit it before
[1:04:03] we could maybe slip brother to brother
[1:04:05] sister to sister
[1:04:07] and let's just lay hands on one another
[1:04:09] let's just pray
[1:04:10] you got to move out and get to where
[1:04:12] somebody is family whatever it is would
[1:04:15] you mind doing that
[1:04:17] I just just in my heart just feel to do
[1:04:19] this
[1:04:20] foreign
[1:04:21] I got confidence in the anointing the
[1:04:23] quickening power of God that's right
[1:04:25] here Among Us
[1:04:26] why wait
[1:04:28] heavenly father as we lord God have Lord
[1:04:32] our hands Lord hands Lord that are
[1:04:35] yielded into your presence oh God lord
[1:04:39] knowing that God that there are needs
[1:04:42] Lord Jesus that's right here Among Us
[1:04:44] Lord God and father I pray that God that
[1:04:47] Lord you would move Lord for every
[1:04:50] single need Lord God that father where
