hallelujah we need you Lord Oh God we love you precious Lord Jesus you are the precious stone we love your father we just just invite you just come Lord Minister to our hearts now for your word Oh precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] god bless you tonight if you eternally make the Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4:4 up there in just a moment if you just had a little bit visions for four there is one body one spirit even as you're called and one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so everyone has a part in the body everyone has a part verse eight wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers amen nothing just let me read out of first Corinthians 12 27 before we're seated there Paul is speaking of this body now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God hath set in the church first apostles apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers and after that miracles then gifts of healings helps government's diversities of tongues I think we can rest within this at God said it he set or placed it there then it shows God knows that we would have need of that and it's not so much of an office but it's God coming through to that office it's him that we have need of because a man can never meet our need no matter how how great the gift might be it's it's our faith is to be in God Abram talked about in faith is the victory and he spoke about a woman he said she would come to the altar brother Brown would pray with her over and over he said she would ask God to deliver from cigarettes all the in because that's what she was still battling with and he said you know he said she would cry weep them he said then the next day you need her she bowed knock you down he said but one day they came down to be known that she had cancer then he said she got the business she started praying and he said at that time he said God come down and moves for her he said see what happened is he said her faith was not in William Brennan her faith was not in Branham tabernacle he said that she took her faith and put it in the one she should have put it in the beginning and that's him that's a finished work see that's the goal of the ministry that's the goal within each of our lives because we recognize if someone when we go to witness to somebody we recognize by the joy it's more than just to get somebody to a church that's not the goal the goal is that they would get to Jesus Christ because he's the one that has changed our life he's the one that's made the difference god bless you you may be seated I know every word I say it counts the time against me so sometimes I wish I'd be able to claim that back but God when we look at this here in gifts of the mighty Conqueror I want to just still looking at this in the whole part of it at this time God intended man to preach the gospel he could God could have had the son to preach the gospel he could have asked the star as a matter of fact brother Pam told us he said the son never gets out of God's will the stars never gets out of God's will the sons never deliberated between two two or three different messages to preach and how men maybe I should have preached this or stood then stars don't either but yet all of them have their place because it's all God's Bible is that right and every wherever those stars are all known by its name but yet even though they have their sound and their sound goes out and there's a emanating of their sound and it would actually there's a warship that's going on but yet God intended that man would preach the gospel and yet it's not based on the ability of man but yet it is that which is through a yielded divinely placed gift in that life that the Lord would use to reflect himself into the midst of his people and call his children back to that original life it's it's very much like this microphone that I'm wearing here tonight this microphone itself is not it's not giving out any sound it's only a tool that I've picked up off of my desk put the batteries in it and put it on and it allows the voice to be transmitted that you can hear it a little better and that's all that a gift what a gift is to be is that which is yielded to God that God might speak and God might achieve what he intends to achieve and you know God never gets in a hurry it's us who gets in a hurry and it's always something to always be mindful in our lives that it's not ability that does anything in the very thing that when we get to relying upon our ability is where we fail and that's within any aspect in every part of our life my prayer is through these things that God will help us but this gets applied right down into every life because remember just as God would take a messenger to an age as a star that's in his right hand and the right hand signifies power and authority and God would take that vessel and God would project his life his light through that vessel it would be an example to the rest in that age of how God intends to use man but men but it doesn't mean that that man that whether ministry or whether it's a man or woman it doesn't mean that they are supposed to do how God has used that man remember God makes himself known that he is the present God when he sent Moses with a message the purpose is he's told them he says you tell them I am hath sent you it's a present god it makes us aware that there is a present God right here among us and so when we're when we look at this this is where that Peter would pick up in 1st Peter chapter 4 verse 10 and he would say as every man have to received the gift the gift what gift the gift of the Holy Ghost received it it's a gift even so Minister the same one to another so here's the body ministry let that Life Minister to minister means to serve one another and as good stewards of the manifold grace of God what God has bestowed upon our lives there's a purpose there's a reason it it's it's not just in Redemption but it's that our lives might also minister one to another the same way than in our natural bodies as God keeps on in those examples we every part of the body must operate in a coordinated manner and yet it's things that altogether are not always audible but there are things that can happen that the eyes can pick up and it and then it's able to take something in and then the rest of the body will move out of harm's way because the eyes have saw something and the mind has processed it and then the rest of the body is able to get out of the way yet there's no audible sound to it but yet it's something that the eyes can see showing that every part of the body is to work in harmony and I'm telling you that in itself is a great paradox because in order for a body to operate in harmony the hand can't argue with the eyes the arm can't argue with the legs in so it's gonna require sacrifice on every part there's only one thing that can bring that sacrifice and that's for the true sacrifice for him to be so preeminent in our lives where that word brings a coordinating of every effort in our life and that's exactly what the Prophet when he spoke the message humbled thyself he said in order to see this third pole really demonstrated among us it will require a humility and a coordination among every member it requires that out of our life now Paul Peter goes on to say in 1st Peter 4:11 if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion for ever and ever amen now Peter in an inner and another place here Peter picks up the God's commissioning now remember they have been commissioned to take this gospel and to preach this gospel but it's not left in just into the hands of man but it must be God in man carrying on his own work so Peter here as he would pick this up to recognize he says of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come to you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into there's a difference between just preaching and the Holy Ghost doing the preaching there's a big difference here see this right here when the Holy Spirit the same one who declared the coming salvation and moved within the prophets and with within that word there was distinction there was direction there was appointment all of that was laid out there now look the same Holy Spirit that would tell that prophet elect when you read in the Book of Isaiah Isaiah in one chapter and it's not Isaiah it's the Spirit of God he'll break back and forth between the present he'll come into the gentile age and then they'll break right over into that of god dealing with the 144,000 after the rapture then you'll move to the millennium and then right into the future hold not in chapters but sometimes in one chapter and it's not even in chronological order but it's the same god it takes god to put it all together so it all comes down to it is us depending on Jehovah Jireh and he always provides for himself when we're in the midst of battle he reveals himself as our banner when we're in trouble he reveals himself as our peace because all of these are attributes seven compound redic today's of the one same Living God so the Holy Spirit is what takes the word it must be the Holy Spirit to deliver that word that's how God prepares a man not by schooling the brem talks about those were that light has come through then they're faithfully taught but faithfully taught does not mean they have sat down on a bench and they have been instructed by an elder howbeit there is a necessity of that doctrine and for that to be taught but that cannot replace the light from shining into your life this word must not be or confined just to doctrine or theology it is the Express light of Jesus Christ it's that same light that reflection that image because after all in the Church of the Living God we don't want to see man reproducing himself but it should be God reproducing his own life men are called to be eunuchs not their own seed but God injecting his seed and bringing forth Messiah that's the goal of the gospel so it's not a man-made screwing it's got to be an experience with God it takes us stripping before Aaron and and his sons could enter in they had to meet the Prophet at the door they had to be stripped of their garments that's not only just for the ministry that's for each of our lives we must be presented before the word for our day and stripped of our own ideas stripped of our own will it requires us to lay him down then that word comes forth to wash us you can't be anointed until you've been washed you've got to be washed by the word first once you wash by the word then you can be dressed by the word and anointed by the word then you're ready for service and the service is only a manifestation of a vision that God has given the Prophet which is the word that now has been revealed now becomes flesh and manifests in sons and daughters of God because it is that same life that comes to bring us into expression we become a prisoner to the revelation we become a prisoner you see these these these realities that have been spoke to me these are more than just titles a prisoner you become Yelp with the word you see it's the same Jesus continuing on his work he's just using his body to do it the same way he used his corporal body to come and bring Redemption as that body was under the anointing of redemption show is the body of Jesus Christ under that same anointing of redemption oh that's why I love that in in in in Acts chapter 1 verse 1 all grateful offers those things were Jesus began to do and teach and the Prophet picks it up and the message token and he's continuing to do it hallelujah it's a continuation well that's why we are one body one family there's family strains that are through this body whoo Laura meter cop they just it's part of the fatty rocks in this family so to think it's him in his people co-workers and redemption it committed to unto us the word of reconciliation he is divine were the branches we're his branches were born of his life in that tree we are his branches I want you to look here in the scripture in Isaiah 52 6 therefore my people shall know my name he's not only talking about to that of when the Jews are regathered back and he reveals his name but he's talking to you and I right now because you can only worship Him when it is revealed where he's placed his name his name is his life is his character when Jesus was here and he said in John John I believe with John 17 I have manifested thy name unto those thou has given me out of the world and what does the Sun do look at listen now a woman is not a carrier of her father's name right but it requires a son that's why I went God he came fresh he did not become a woman he become man I'll pause on that one tonight because there has to come forth that life that was left forfeited back there in the beginning hallelujah so now notice therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that does speak behold it is I how beautiful upon the mountains look at this are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publishes peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publishes salvation that saith unto Zion thy God reigneth publisher's means to preach jesus said go you therefore and preach this gospel demonstrate this gospel now think I want you to look at this feat speaks of being active we're not just standing still see every time within the word how it has to be applied yes we need to be established in the Word of God we need to have our feet placed on solid ground but yet now moving in this part of it we must be active with that word but like Isaiah we cannot become active with the word until Farrah's we have had a confession oh my right and from a confession now comes forth cleansing once cleansing happens then were commissioned all of those parts have to come in and in reckon look what look what the new birth does it draws us beyond our own our own selfishness but we've got to battle that every day but feet speak of being active running with the message witnesses that are going forth with his life carrying his message preaching the acceptable year a time to return to your inheritance this is the reality of the greater works did not Jesus say he said the greater works you shall do than this let's think of it brother Brandon would place it like this and let me just refer to it he said Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it had not yet come that's greater works the church is to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost jesus said it was coming but the church has it and saying we got it and it's for you hallelujah my my my when Jesus was standing here remember when he took the scroll and he found the place that it was written he announced and declared the acceptable year of the Lord it's at hand hey man it was it was a time for it to be breaking for it now think of it in the ministry as he walked here in his ministry there were sicknesses and diseases lifted from the people he brought our infirmities devils were cast out you see what he did in groom form that same Jesus Bay men coming back in bright form he would do the same take better he did not diminish in power as when Adam was was laid to sleep and rest and the mystery that was with anyone he was revolving for could only be brought out when Adam was laid to rest and when he came forth notice has God prepared that body taking from what was already there what he had already created he brought that body and separated the original spirit all my and divided that original spirit and he placed into her and the spirit that he placed into her would be a feminine designation of Adam himself this is why the real believer humbles themselves to the word a man may recognize their husband they recognize when he speaks [Applause] they met a real believer this ain't a real believer your spirit ain't a real believer either but got pepper knackles in that real believer which is that seed attribute of God he raises that up he begins to fellowship and he speaks to that son or daughter and says you got jurisdiction over this possession this thing says I'm tired but the inner man says but I'm going to the house of God this guy says man I'm so tired I don't know if I can pray today but the inner man says prayer in about a position of your body it's a condition of your heart [Applause] if he Hebrews 2 verse 11 I want you to look in the description here for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one we needed him we couldn't clean ourselves up brother William we needed him he said right we needed him he's the one who came down from glory to bring many sons unto glory for which cause he's not ashamed to call them brethren oh I wish I could preach on there that's a whole mouthful right there think of it he's not ashamed to call you and me brethren even of everything that the enemy could try to accuse you of but it's not ashamed to call you brother because why it is that inside man that has been raised up we were dead but he raised Kaman raised us up just as he made an appointment to visit the tomb where Lazarus was were there and he made an appointment to raise up that son or daughter that was on the inside of you and there's only one thing that could do that and that was his voice my sheep know my voice and we have followed him for every step every stage and we're following that voice this is what he's doing watch saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church while I sing praise unto thee right in the midst of the church he's declaring his name this this phrase I will sing praise unto thee he is declaring this is a hymn it's like a hymn it's speaking of victory you can't correctly look at the Lord Jesus and see any defeat you see victory so the bride of Jesus Christ is yielded to him so much until she's a perfect reflection of him his working he is working through her it is Christ in her not her own identity but his working remember when in the book of Zechariah when it showed Zechariah the lampstands what is this sakurai Zechariah said I don't know thou knowest you tell me what that little room is I mean you tell me what them candelabras are this is what he said it was another night not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord it's his work his strength he's equipped his body to a tree what he is achieving through us doesn't mean that we don't wrestle with our humanity we wrestle with our humanity but greater is He that is in us then he that's in the world the identity is him his life look at this in Revelations 1 verse 12 here is John on the Isle of Patmos and remember this is to reveal the coming of the Lord and now John the voice has been speaking to him he said it was a voice like a trumpet sounding it had signification to him for the Bible says in verse 12 and I turned to see the voice he went looking for a person he said I turned to see that voice let speak to me you see it was something that was so personal to where it was just this is just personal to me it had a personal meaning and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks look at this and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man that one like is his bride miss notice she's clothed with a garment down to the foot she's not standing there naked she's clothed with what his righteousness his holiness his power she is clothed down to the foot he has provided her garments and great about the paps with a golden girl she's as brother man would bring it and right across he said the breast and here it stands the bride of Jesus Christ you see it's a ministry even even in high priests but yet is a nun coming judgment and here what is holding that gospel it's the gospel that is holding the holiness and the power over the Church of the Living God this is what I want that knows very simple but I want you to see this verse 14 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in the furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters do you notice it didn't say her her identity is him in her it is his feet and he had in his right hand seven stars out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the Sun shine attend his strength and when I saw him not a church not an idea when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last do you recognize that laying of the right hand upon your life brother shame laying upon your life brother day you recognize that's that same one the same power that moved upon Moses that sent Moses down the Egypt is the same power that part of the Red Sea and that same God by his power and authority has raised up in your life who you really are hallelujah an outstretched arm his right hand fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead nobody could ever say that but you know you can he became dead like we were but he might raise us up we could say I was dead bonel Milosh dead yeah I was dead what I mean I've seen you before out here and doing this no I was a dead man walking around that was a dead man but now I've been made alive in Christ Jesus amen I'm no longer dead I'm alive hallelujah who did that the same one who was dead and is now alive amen and have the keys of hell and of death now we notice that with the enemy here in this body it's God's God's Way is to lead his body I tell you when you you step back and you look at all this and to me it just you know it's God in control it's got to be God in control how God had puts everything together and brings it together how God and call in his body a unit you remember what was back in Eden the word was preeminent it was preeminent there in their midst they had brother Branham as he tells us in Satan Dean they had a perfect understanding of the love of God you know that you're not the perfect understanding of love God it brings it relaxes you you recognize what his love you're a witness of what his love has done in your life it's not this sappy worldly love that they teach out there oh Jesus just loves you no no no his love he loves you but he changes you that's real life that's what real love is real love projected it it has an effect but you find that how that Satan's does that remember what his desire has always been to be worshipped like God he's a sick guy but Satan has always he tries to move into this and man is susceptible by the fall to remand sometime States he's got to make things happen and he's got to do this and he's got to do that God is the one who is in control I like the statement you know brother Henry Green made years ago I was a member as a little boy I was just a just a boy when we first went there to those meetings and in North Carolina and sitting out on the hood of the car cuz we couldn't even get inside the the little church they had there in Ruth at the time but Henry made a statement he said God started his church in the beginning the way he wanted it and now he wants it the way he started it he's made a promise I'll restore so we find that when the first age and entered in it was in that age to where then we find is that Antichrist spirit was entering in and it was right in there real close and we find that how that eventually there was a drifting by that church natural from the real reality of Pentecost all they could see was what was on the outside religion began to become an appeal to them but it was not the life and what you think of this they were being removed from the very oversight of the Holy Spirit brother Brown would say it like this and I'm just gonna cut in on this statement he says the way of God boy that's a--that's a whole mouthful right there the way of God wants to lead them by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and signs and god-given wonders this was to be accomplished but God selected God ordained God equipped God sent men you notice when every one of them God equipped God selected God ordained God set you take god off of it no different than anything else you take God away from my life no different from any other life God makes the difference with the whole camp being dominated by Holy Ghost move that wasn't calling up you know having to call up pastor Moses and say pastor Moses I got something on my heart to pray for you you reckon I can pray for him that guy was already busy enough he couldn't even see it see everybody in the interviews as the way God speaks to you that's God telling you there ain't time to waste go I realize people could take that the wrong way of what I've just said but it listen every true gift and everything that God moves it will work in harmony with a vision it will always work in harmony with the vision and when it's not God is faithful to correct it why because correcting it doesn't mean removing it correcting means working with it because it's to be used so brother Brandon goes on the they makes a statement in that same one and once you're listening he says now I want to I want to say that I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has sent men in the church men who are gifted by the Spirit and they will keep the church in order that's a big freeze right there to keep the church in order that's working in all all of those ministerial offices it's God caring for his work sometimes the order it isn't that somebody got out of order they spoke on they shouldn't be spoke sometimes beginning out of order is they get to looking at the world and everybody else marching over here they get their eyes on the wrong face but God is faithful he'll come down and shake it and say get back and step thank God for that friends I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God's sins to take charge whoa some big words there to take charge you you heard the phrase you can't have too many cooks in the kitchen no more salt here no let's cayenne pepper there no need a little bit more pepper there no a little bit more so now that nothing gets done there's got to be order or you sit around let's do this let's do that let's do this let's do that let's do this let's do that how about let's get home and get to bed cuz we done spent all this time saying let's do this let's do that let's do this let's do that let's do this Golic where you want to go anyone go yeah no matter me we're not going well let's go here no I don't wanna go there that's not my wife that's me I really don't care as long as in this god sends them to take charge somebody gotta make decisions I said somebody's gotta make decisions I'm making decisions isn't always popular let's say me how come why don't we just take a vote on everything because this is a theocracy why don't we just can you imagine what that would be like more that's another one but that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the Spirit of God for the word and spirit are one remember them this is a verse right before Hebrews 13:8 better maybe we forgot it remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God notice how it's followed who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow faith that revealed substance that revealed that's that follow that you know that's a great achievement is for God to get one mortal to believe another brother Bram called it the hardest thing that God's ever had to do that takes the grace of God for for for a person to be able to look beyond the flesh I'm glad for God's mercy because even it's sometimes were sometimes and I that's just brother Samuel but that's just this God will bring somebody else in and here they things they begin to address and to deal then you know you know that ain't brother Samuel it wasn't him anyhow but then you know that's God's grace whose faith follow God did not give us leadership for us to turn around and follow her himself true I mean can you imagine a platoon showing up to the battle here the sergeant shows up and we go into the battle and everybody going their own way wonder what are you guys going yeah we think you'd be better over here our position be better over here at the enemy this group says this over here pretty soon you know what we're not one were divided before division ever shows itself physically if first happened spiritually so you find what happened instead of them doing it God's Way the Bremen goes into talking about this they saw something they saw that the church that leadership they could see these scriptures that we are reading from you tonight they could see those scriptures but they were trying to institute it in their own strength they were taking scriptures without them spiritually being revealed and without themselves having a real experience from God because they had a desire for preeminence they were making bishops over this one and they were taking and not having an understanding they were putting men to rule over men that's man's idea he didn't leave it the way God intended remember God does not choose men that men think are fit Samuel went to a night you know the first the eldest one of Jesse Shirley this is God's anointed nope that's why nope Sheree nope finally he gets through all seven and says do you have one more because none of these are the one that God sent me here for God don't make a mistake when he sends a prophet with a message somebody is gonna be anointed somebody's gonna be anointed they may not be on the scene right then but brother they're going to become on the scene that word is gonna bring them on the scene here came a ready little guy poured out the anointing oil appalling that was God's choice hallelujah it was God's Way this is what brother Branham tells us he says that the businessmen they have said Ephesians 4 has failed and he says they have invaded the pulpit without a call from God they've invaded it not God called him to it they invaded it because they believe that it's failed but remember let me just say this very clearly it's true there's been a lot of failure there's been pastors that's fallen Vangelis men go on down the line but there's been a lot of people that's fail too sometimes you deal with people in central Samuel you don't know well not you know this or this pastor or this or that I don't know if I can never trust another pastor that's the mistake you trusted a pastor you need to trust God that's the one who gave that word and like John I've turned to see the voice that spake unto me got to know that personally there's a lot of doctors that have fought have failed they made mistakes come on breathe you see we got to come back to man did not give that word we got him say devil I don't need your excuses is this a healer isn't he a healer you say that's an emotional healing he's still a healer he heals the emotional scars and lives hallelujah so that we can have a confidence in his word but you see one on that did it's separated the people but what separating them from the life this one's over this one and this one's over this one and this one's over this one it's all three minutes of man when so contrary to how the scripture says that were one body one spirit and that all within this body are to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost everyone is to participate in worship I'm not just talking about one you were sitting here in these pews everyone is to participate in worship you know you worship God even as brother Brent tells us in the Hebrew series when you see that person in the store and you say Matt Hossack the Lord blessed us with a beautiful day that's testifying that's why shipping was the things not just when the song or when the word but there's a last ship that comes out of our lives but see it then just began to be just a succession from one to another so there's differences in administration this is what Paul when Paul would would set this forth remember Paul would declare to them that that I'm a mist I'm the minister unto the Gentiles he wasn't puffing himself up but he was reminding them in Romans 15 the commission that God has given me to the Gentile church remember Peter Peter would speak this at the end of 2nd Peter and he would talk about some who were looking at what Paul was preaching and Peter said they're already unstable in their lives and they're wrestling with what Paul is saying and he says they wrestle to their own destruction oh what a blessing it is to believe it's a blessing to believe don't understand everything No but it's a blessing to believe to know Jesus Christ is the absolute he's been revealed to my heart he sent a message in this hour he has taken the seals from off the book he has spoken in this hour and that same voice is writing that trail again hallelujah the same light it stabilizes us in this hour there's differences in administration differences within that but it's the same Lord all the way through brother Branham when they would speak of this here and taking sides with Jesus he says it's just like in the army you've got to have one that's a general that's the headquarters captain's the captain says this I speaking to a group of ministers here in this meeting he's the captain of that group but then the general can change his orders and the chief commanding general of course is Jesus Christ in the church brother Brown never made himself the chief General however however when the bride is going in preview he's right there on the stand are you with me because listen why because it was Jesus Christ revealed through the ministry of this hour reveal what in the body that's why the Prophet could say he has come in our flesh and his ministers are his captains of the companies that's representing him here on now you've recognized you I've read these scriptures to you before we're talks of the bride in the Song of Solomon and it speaks of her not to let me just refer just to verse 10 if I could who is she that looked at forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the Sun and terrible as an army with banners these banners are a standard the other scriptures that are right there in Song of Solomon chapter 6 she is lovely she is the Dove she is the undefiled and she's the choice one he's talking about the bride but then he goes and expresses it she's terrible that means awesome dreadful as an army with banners she's lovely she's delicate but she'll stand for that word don't you mistake her loveliness as though she's a pushover no it's him motivating her you're not gonna lay a charge on her husband these banners are standards standards that part of the word of the Lord the season that we're living in the administration of the gospel like the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall raise a standard against it you see the body of Jesus Christ it's fortified by himself look at this protection that's here I'm coming down it's a protection this word being in the body wrapped up in the believer where the Holy Ghost is the leader of the church remember brother Branham kind of dramatized like this he says I gave it to Eve and she let down on it you said but I'm coming myself I'm coming to do the job and I'm gonna come in my people I'm gonna come wrapped in them and this is why God is present in his army we're not on a picnic we're on a battlefield they're not only our rights that belonged to us as believers but there's other sons and daughters of God that don't know their sons and daughters of God there's others that don't know Liberty has come you don't have to be subservient to the enemy any longer it's an army that goes to battle Oh glory this is why brother Brian would say God is fortified in his army what with himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what the officers of the church is it's God's dress inside dress the world don't see that dress it's an inside dress it's something that is specially revealing to us as a believer you know listen just as much as it's God's inside dress for a prophet to recognize carrying the message for this age it's also God's inside dress to recognize the Apostles it's God's inside dress to recognize who your pastor is who them who that the missionary was apostles evangelist what is it is to recognize him him speaking see we're we're in a day when things are just like sera sera what are you doing I'm just floating along no no you get established I turned to see the voice that spake to me God an apostle a prophet a seer four seas before Satan ever gets to it done told it and now awesome how many's a witness to that the God will come right down and he already calls out that the enemies coming this way and it prepares us ahead of time what is that God fortified in his body Oh glory be to God God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress where he's clothed is that right the Roman soldiers stripped him that system stripped him of his dress where come on they stripped him and crucified Him but here he come in as dressed up in his church his bride don't crucify him she has on that wear that ring with a diamond she receives every gift that he has she put it on in a museum for people to come by and look at no sack she's wearing it when you see these officers pastors teachers evangelists what is it that's God's dress work it's God's present his presence is Spirit working through man any office design denies that it's not of God anything denies that word not of God but if it speaks with the word we said haha I know him who's speaking he might have a different complexion he might be shorter he might be fatter he might be skinnier it don't matter it's him it's Jesus that I really want to see it's God protecting his work he's watching over it this is why he has the offices set in the body this is why he'll take a man and the man he doesn't know why am I going this route why am I going that round God knows you come to the only thing you come to a place after years of ministry you finally you come to the rest God knows what he's doing gun knows what he's doing there's something that God is doing this is why brother Branham in clothes he brings it and he types the work of the ministry as those four Chairman's anointing Chairman's that are gathered around the ark which is the acts of the Holy Spirit in the body he said you've got the Evangelist the Prophet the Eagle they fly you know the Prophet flies and sees things way off evangelist will fly from here and land here fly from here land here flat from here land here sometimes not all but sometimes the way that some evangelists are gifted sometimes they don't get they don't get credit for what God has really revealed to us because them here it looks like when they get done with it with with a sermon you you you got the font but it looks like they've been here they've been here they've been here they've been here they've been here you know why that's how God has directed them to go then you take others maybe standing as an evangelist maybe they're just working and doing the work of an evangelist but the the way the things will move right down through the word and you see it just being moved in that way see it's God working it's why there's diversity even in every gift every pastor is not the same every teacher is not the same apostles are not the same they're not all the same God has gifted each one in a special way and he wants that person to be who God made him that's the same for each of us no wonder Paul could tell Timothy despise not that youth but be thou an example these four anointings that are gathered around here remember these 490 they don't contradict one another the Bible says when one moved they all move they're all looking the same way lion comes out and roars like the Apostle moving into a new area roars out then you you find that here then comes the ox kind of standing in one place for an hour pasture one thing about a pasture he don't he don't fly like an eagle for feet on the ground and he stands he's ox or the team doesn't move very fast but think of it brother Brown says there each one guarding he said that teacher he's a shrewd man he can take that word and take bits and drop that here what's gone doing it's God protecting his work I tell you I pray that God through this time there was we're looking at this not that we're not but I pray they say God let me have one thing let me I don't want my eyes on any man it's not that we're not to have confidence you should have confidence and but that confidence ought to come in your heart from God identifying himself that's what our confidence should be in but to say God let me just get my eyes so on you so whatever vessel you're going to use let me just be on it let me say this to you every ministry grows well I heard this man say this year I heard this don't put him in a picture frame don't put him in a picture frame there's things where ministers have come and stood right here and there's certain things I didn't get it behind him and go through and start correcting things maybe a service or two later I start bringing it in right through the message but I don't come back and say this brother said this but this is what the Prophet says I don't want to destroy that brothers influence because the same God who reveals it to me is the same God to reveal it to them because God might use that man at some point in time to help you in your walk and if you tear him down how can you have confidence this is why just for every one of our lives don't put people in picture frames you've seen a picture of me when I was you know in fifth grade I was a chubby fat little kid had poofy hair on my head I'm well I was still a little chubby but I don't have poofy hair on my head things changed that's the same way it is for every one of us may God help us to have grace for one another Oh blessed be his name your loving aren't you grateful for the gifts of the mighty Conqueror his love expressed to us every one of our lives we've received for every one of us the gift of God the Holy Spirit if you've not tonight it's for you I said it's for you it's for you let's bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we just just so thankful God for your mercy Lord many times I just don't even feel like thank you is majest enough Lord but lord how we thank you so much we thank you for your love and your care and or just just walking us through these things and lord I realize for some of us Lord it could be a review and looking back at it but Lord we're not just coming through things as reviewing I've come to see it Lord over the years where many of these things Lord if we can really understand Lord what it is and be able to yield our hearts to it your God then you're able to really minister to us in these channels Lord because it's it's you working in your body Lord may you guide us Lloyd guide us as an assembly Lord direct me Lord as a pastor Lord oh god I can't do this Lord you know I've I've told you that over and over I can't do this you know Lord I ran from it Lord when my dad would begin to bring it up Lord I'd run I wouldn't even stay at the home I got to where I just walk out of his house and go home it's called me to tremble betting never left me Lord it's your it's your called it's your beckoning it's your work now that's not only for me Lord in surrendering in that you take in that gift of a pastor you placed in my life realizing the Lord is your prophet would tell us we can see it in the scripture eventually there can be no man can have more than one gift in his life but Lord may we all take from this tonight and in these services its you working and directing and leading us and it's you being reflected in our lives Lord as you spoke to us over and over our lives it's more than just messages that are preached from this pulpit across the sacred desk Our Lives preaches sermons the place we're going to work our lives preach O God may we be faithful witnesses that are reflecting Jesus Christ the people Lord they Oh Minh quote a Bible all they could get drawn up may we recognize it's not something we have to quote it's who we are give us wisdom Lord to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a death because Lord were we're after souls for your kingdom it doesn't for us it doesn't matter where they go to church because there's only one church it that's not our objective our objective is that people get to Jesus Christ the same one who has changed and transformed our lives that same Liberty that has come to us that's what moves to our our lives that's what moves are upon our hearts for our families our loved ones our children Oh God for our co-workers for our neighbors friends it's that reality that oh come on give me favor with them help me to reach em father oh go on drop a word in season deal with their hearts Lord when we go to talk to him and we take that token and with love and consideration may we be Jesus to them Lord Oh God help us Lord [Music] may it be as we read here in the scriptures it's you that they see not us not not believers spoken word Tabernacle this church can't change nobody as a man I can't change nobody people can come hear the preaching of the word the Lord unless their eyes and their faith gets placed in you then Lord and miss it but I ask God for grace that maybe for some Lord that it's been misplaced they've regarded just coming to this church if there be anything or any that just would say just to be associated around the message and believe their brother branham's our prophet or just for them to say but the same you're my pastor cut me they recognize and it's not that's not a title we're not it when there's nothing about know about something being good it's recognizing you they've got to have a personal contact with you you're the one who changed their life [Music] I could so transform them into a new creation in Christ Jesus what their mind cannot even conceive because that carnal mind is enmity against God but that heart can believe and say God I believe it's for me
