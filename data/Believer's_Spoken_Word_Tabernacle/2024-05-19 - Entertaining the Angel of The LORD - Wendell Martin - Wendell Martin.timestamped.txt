[47:22] similarities I don't see any kind of
[47:24] good I don't I don't see any kind of my
[47:27] dad in me or any kind of but I just want
[47:29] to tell you the genetics are
[47:33] there your daddy had to go through the
[47:35] same trials that you're going through
[47:38] your mama had to go through the same
[47:39] struggles that you've gone through your
[47:42] Prophet had to go through the same
[47:43] struggles that you've gone through and
[47:46] just as the elders have made it and are

[47:51] you I look at my life even today I see

[48:02] look back at me and say I'm proud of you
[48:04] son and I'm I I'm fixing to be 54 years

[48:15] mamas and daddies need to let their
[48:16] children know how proud you are of them
[48:20] amen and so uh we count a de a delight
[48:24] to be here so glad to see everyone here

[48:44] here in in the Book of Genesis the 18th
[48:47] chapter and
[48:49] um uh we're going to read the first six
[48:54] verses and we um uh we just want to say
[48:58] it's such a delight Amen to to know the
[49:02] Lord Jesus and to have this message of
[49:04] the hour and um amen uh we we are so
[49:09] blessed I I believe the coming of the
[49:11] Lord is so close to us but here in in
[49:14] Genesis
[49:16] 18 and 1 and the Lord appeared unto him
[49:20] in the plains of mamory and he sat at
[49:23] the tent Door In the Heat of the day and
[49:26] he lift up his eyes and looked and low
[49:29] three men stood by him and when he saw
[49:32] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[49:35] door and bowed himself toward the
[49:37] ground and said my Lord if now I have
[49:40] found favor in thy sight pass not away I
[49:45] pray thee from thy servant now I want
[49:48] you to look the Lord
[49:49] appears and then we find that Abraham
[49:52] recognizes him number three he bows down
[49:56] to to this ground and he asked him not
[49:59] to
[50:00] leave let a little water the fourth
[50:03] verse I pray thee be fetched and wash
[50:06] your feet and rest yourselves under the
[50:08] tree prise the Lord and I will fetch a
[50:11] morsel of bread and comfort ye your
[50:13] hearts after that ye shall pass on for
[50:16] therefore are ye come to your servant
[50:19] and he said they said do so and as thou
[50:23] Hast said and Abraham hastened into the
[50:26] tent and Sarah and said make ready
[50:29] quickly three measures of fine meal and
[50:32] me it and make cakes upon on the earth I
[50:36] want to speak for a few moments tonight
[50:40] entertaining the angel of the Lord let's
[50:44] go to the Lord in prayer
[50:46] father Lord we love you and it's so nice
[50:50] to have friends and fellowship and to
[50:55] see these young people come from some of
[50:57] them drove hours away and were already
[51:00] in service this morning but they come
[51:02] Lord to put their licks of fire in with
[51:05] the young people here and and Lord I say
[51:09] I'm asking that you would bless them and
[51:12] all of those who have come today I pray
[51:16] that you'll bless this
[51:17] congregation bless the pastor and those
[51:20] that labor with him bless these young
[51:23] people Lord as we've seen them play
[51:24] music and singing and Lord it does my
[51:28] heart good I pray holy spirit that you
[51:32] would help me as Lord my voice is is a
[51:36] little weak tonight and and I just ask
[51:39] that you would give strength to body and
[51:41] voice Lord give me a clear mind let my
[51:45] spirit be sensitive to you Lord and I
[51:48] just pray Lord that you would make us
[51:49] all sensitive to youen in the name of
[51:52] the Lord Jesus Christ bless can the
[51:55] Church Say Amen am and amen God bless
[51:58] you you may be seated here this evening
[52:01] and I I want to say
[52:05] that as we have seen as brother brandham
[52:08] would tell us there in
[52:10] the uh 18th or the 12th
[52:13] chapter amen he said Abraham typed he
[52:17] typed out the bride and and and the
[52:21] stages of of restoration and he he said
[52:24] the 12th chapter was the was Abraham
[52:27] being
[52:29] justified he says the 15th chapter was
[52:31] Abraham
[52:34] Sanctified then in the 17th chapter the
[52:37] Holy Ghost he typed the Holy Ghost
[52:39] baptism El
[52:40] shedi but when he come to the 18th
[52:43] chapter was the placing this is when the
[52:46] Lord appeared and the body change was to
[52:48] take place and and
[52:53] Abraham recognized the presence of the
[52:57] Lord I I I think it's important that we
[53:01] recognize the presence of the Lord Jesus
[53:06] now I don't I don't think it's it's
[53:07] God's not calling us just to be church
[53:10] members God is calling us Amen to a very
[53:14] special position in this last day he's
[53:17] calling us back to that place amen that
[53:21] he had we're going back to the Garden of
[53:23] Eden can you say amen I think it's in
[53:26] important at what we
[53:29] entertain now the scripture says as it
[53:31] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[53:34] in the revealing of the son of man the
[53:37] revealing of the son of man is what took
[53:39] place here in the 18th chapter when God
[53:42] appeared in the in the form of a human
[53:45] being and God be to speak amen words of
[53:50] life and restored Abraham and Sarah back
[53:55] to their amen and a youth again can you
[53:57] say amen I think it's incredible because
[54:01] lot did not see this lot could not
[54:05] entertain the presence of God Amen
[54:08] because he could not recognize God I I I
[54:11] think God Amen I'm thankful that there
[54:14] is a people that can recognize God in
[54:17] our midst today when I think about
[54:20] entertain it means to give attention to
[54:23] to give consideration to to receive
[54:25] someone
[54:27] amen it it it to entertain is to amen uh
[54:31] pay attention and to play and and give
[54:36] attention consideration
[54:38] to amen as it was in the days of Sodom
[54:43] amen there will be a revealing and there
[54:45] will be a receiving just as there was a
[54:48] revealing to Abraham and a receiving
[54:51] from Abraham so will it be today amen
[54:55] now we're living in a in this hour of
[54:59] great um uh self-gratification
[55:02] amen now you young people are facing
[55:05] more today than than I had to face when
[55:07] I was a kid I mean computers uh uh you
[55:12] know if you had computers when I was a
[55:13] kid uh you were pretty rich and if you
[55:16] had computers you had to have this
[55:18] really big room amen because computers
[55:21] would take up the entire room and and uh
[55:25] we didn't really know what we were doing
[55:26] with the computer if you ever had one
[55:28] but it amen that's what we had amen I I
[55:33] I I I'll tell you what we there was no
[55:36] such thing as a cordless drill there was
[55:40] no such thing as a amen as a cell phone
[55:44] there there was no such we had cords on
[55:48] our phones amen we had cords on our
[55:51] drills we had chords you see but I
[55:55] that's that's the generation
[55:56] I was raised up in if I wanted to make a
[55:59] phone call 10 miles away amen it was
[56:03] long
[56:05] distance so we had calling cards you had
[56:09] to go buy a calling card y'all how many

[56:15] you old fossils back

[56:22] I remember back when they used to have
[56:23] to get the operator I wasn't born back
[56:26] that way amen praise the Lord but but
[56:30] but back in the day amen we uh you you
[56:33] had to have the calling cards my wife
[56:36] was was an hour away from me I couldn't
[56:39] talk to her uh very much because it cost
[56:42] a lot of money so what we done is sat
[56:46] down and wrote
[56:47] letters every day and and and and would
[56:51] receive letters back and forth that's
[56:53] the way we communicated when I was a kid
[56:55] and uh we had pay phones how many
[56:57] remembers the old pay
[56:59] phone amen now now payones were good
[57:02] that's where Superman used to
[57:06] changes so amen back in they we had
[57:09] those pay phones you'd put a quarter in
[57:11] and you could dial across and no one you
[57:14] see there they no one knew where you
[57:16] were at when I was a kid I would take
[57:19] off riding my back I wouldn't come back
[57:21] home I'd leave in the morning time
[57:23] wouldn't get back home until supper time
[57:25] mom wouldn't know where I was there was
[57:26] no way of knowing where I was at we
[57:29] didn't have cell phones we didn't have
[57:32] no way of keeping track of one another
[57:34] well praise the Lord amen that's the way
[57:37] that's the kind of generation I was
[57:39] raised up in but we are in a generation
[57:42] today to where
[57:45] everything is at our
[57:49] fingertips right well praise the Lord
[57:52] amen you you you you can keep in track
[57:55] you can keep keep track of your you know

[58:01] friends here in in Ohio and y'all can
[58:04] y'all can talk to each other once twice
[58:06] three times a day if you want to amen
[58:08] that you you can keep track of people
[58:10] across the seas you can keep track of
[58:13] Amen what what is we are in a a a
[58:16] generation amen where where the uh uh uh
[58:20] where the electronics has kept us all
[58:24] entertained
[58:26] amen if we ever wanted to figure
[58:29] something out we would go get the
[58:30] dictionary or go get the
[58:33] encyclopedia amen encyclopedias were
[58:35] that line there was a bunch of them and
[58:37] you'd have to go through there to try to
[58:39] figure out what this meant and what that
[58:41] was that's the generation but this
[58:44] generation Satan knows what he's
[58:48] doing he's wanting to entertain
[58:53] you so that you feel
[58:56] important all
[58:58] right he's entertaining you so that we
[59:03] feel
[59:05] important but I want to tell you the
[59:07] promise of this generation is he has
[59:10] promised to come right and we must
[59:15] entertain
[59:17] him am I doing all right so
[59:20] far I we've got to recognize him in our
[59:25] midst so self-gratification you see the
[59:28] action of lot lot could not recognize
[59:32] God lot could not see where God was at
[59:35] because lot was amen he he he was he was
[59:38] blind of heart amen therefore his
[59:42] actions his reactions could not be the
[59:44] same but the actions of Abraham were the
[59:47] direct results of the expectation of
[59:52] heart he knew that God was going to
[59:56] fulfill his word in his life amen
[1:00:00] Abraham had been waiting for a promised
[1:00:01] child Abraham had been waiting for a
[1:00:04] long time it had been 24 years when God
[1:00:07] appeared to him in this in this text
[1:00:10] amen and Abraham recognized God when he
[1:00:14] came and there was a reality that God
[1:00:18] gave to him yeah now I want to tell you
[1:00:21] today amen that in our in this culture
[1:00:24] today there is nothing in this culture
[1:00:27] that is going to produce a body change
[1:00:30] in these mortal bodies there is nothing
[1:00:33] in this culture that is can change us
[1:00:36] there is nothing in this culture that
[1:00:38] can give us a Rapture there is nothing
[1:00:40] in this cult can you say amen and to be
[1:00:42] quite honest this culture is not looking
[1:00:44] for a Rapture they claim a Rapture but
[1:00:46] they're not looking for a Rapture
[1:00:48] they're not looking for the Fulfillment
[1:00:50] of sons they're not looking they're just
[1:00:52] looking for self-gratification they're
[1:00:54] looking for things amen and
[1:00:56] entertainment to keep them busy amen but
[1:00:58] there is a group of people that know
[1:01:00] that the Redemption is growing near

[1:01:05] understand that God has called them to
[1:01:08] take this world back he's calling us

[1:12:58] stay put angel of God we're going to
[1:13:01] entertain
[1:13:06] you sometimes we can't even go through a
[1:13:08] church
[1:13:09] service when the presence of the Lord is
[1:13:11] going so strongly and
[1:13:13] sweetly and because it's running too
[1:13:16] late for
[1:13:17] us Elders be
[1:13:20] careful come on we want to turn around
[1:13:23] and say man that service is going but
[1:13:25] somebody has got to entertain the
[1:13:28] presence of the Lord the angel of the
[1:13:32] Lord is a mystery to this generation
[1:13:36] they don't know who he is but you know
[1:13:38] who he is they don't know where he would
[1:13:40] even be at but you know where he's at
[1:13:44] the angel of the lord always accompanies
[1:13:46] his message he's always here the angel
[1:13:50] the mighty angel of Revelations 10 is
[1:13:54] here on the
[1:13:56] Earth hallu amen
[1:14:00] hallelujah but in the revealing of the
[1:14:02] son of
[1:14:04] man when God would reveal him in the
[1:14:06] form of dust and he would discern hearts
[1:14:10] with precision and night after night and
[1:14:14] year after year and he was literally
[1:14:15] restoring the hearts to Faith Can you
[1:14:19] say
[1:14:20] Amen we beheld him we knew him we seen
[1:14:23] him amen we we we could recognize God
[1:14:28] through that prophet's word and when a
[1:14:30] prophet comes and let me just say this
[1:14:32] before I get into my my my my main
[1:14:34] thought when when when when you see a
[1:14:36] prophet you know that God is on the the
[1:14:39] the prophet is here to reflect or to
[1:14:41] reveal God to let you know that he's
[1:14:45] close so when a prophet speaks that
[1:14:48] means that when a prophet shows up that
[1:14:51] means god is on the earth to do
[1:14:53] something really special amen now he
[1:14:55] don't want you looking at the prophet
[1:14:57] and worshiping the prophet he wants you
[1:14:59] to know the prophet declares that he is
[1:15:02] here the prophet says you don't see him
[1:15:05] but I can see him the prophet says he's
[1:15:08] right here he's he's right up above you
[1:15:10] can't you see the light the angel is
[1:15:13] here you don't see him I don't see him
[1:15:17] but the prophet sees him and the prophet
[1:15:20] reveals him and the prophet tells you he
[1:15:24] is
[1:15:27] here can you say amen
[1:15:30] amen because God's doing something glory
[1:15:34] to God now it's God's thoughts spoke
[1:15:39] through a prophet into the Virgin womb
[1:15:42] of his bride and they carry and manifest
[1:15:45] the supernatural seed of God this is
[1:15:48] what God has called us can you say Amen
[1:15:51] now I want you to understand now Moses
[1:15:55] amen the the brother Brandon would talk
[1:15:57] about how that Moses would go up into
[1:15:59] the mountain he would come back down and
[1:16:02] the glory of the Lord was upon him and
[1:16:04] he says and he would have to put a veil
[1:16:06] over his face until he come and give the
[1:16:09] people the word and once he gave him the
[1:16:13] word then he could take the veil back
[1:16:16] off why as long as he held the word he
[1:16:20] was the veil but once the people took
[1:16:23] the word they become the veil of that
[1:16:28] word
[1:16:29] hallelujah hallelujah he says so Moses
[1:16:32] was a God to the people until the word
[1:16:35] came and then when the word came amen he
[1:16:38] was just a normal man oh hallelujah what
[1:16:42] I love about the message of the hour is
[1:16:45] God specifically brought a message in
[1:16:48] this generation to impregnate or to put
[1:16:53] in your bosom for for you to believe so
[1:16:56] that you could perform the very works of
[1:17:00] God Sarah could not have the baby Sarah
[1:17:03] tried Sarah long Sarah could not but
[1:17:07] when God came through that angel when
[1:17:11] Prophet God came whatever he said to
[1:17:14] them change their bodies amen amen and
[1:17:19] I'm here to tell you that what we have
[1:17:20] received into the womb of our heart amen
[1:17:23] is going to produce a body change in
[1:17:26] every one of us can you say
[1:17:29] Amen
[1:17:31] now God's got to have a
[1:17:34] veil he's got to have a
[1:17:37] people and I say today as brother
[1:17:40] brandham would say but this is the
[1:17:42] spirit that comes upon the promised word
[1:17:44] for this age and brings forth and
[1:17:47] manifest not two tables of stones but
[1:17:51] the presence of the Living God not a
[1:17:54] mythical thought somebody made up and
[1:17:57] some houd a trick but the very promise
[1:18:01] of God revealed made manifest right
[1:18:04] before us then he asked the question
[1:18:06] what sort of a veil will that be
[1:18:11] behind now now now I I I Hallelujah I
[1:18:14] want stick stick with me it's fixing to
[1:18:16] get good
[1:18:17] amen the veil
[1:18:21] God behind skin
[1:18:24] God through a prophet God delivering his
[1:18:29] word thank you Jesus because God is
[1:18:32] wanting to reveal himself thank you Lord
[1:18:37] through
[1:18:39] peopleall
[1:18:41] thank I think sometimes we don't
[1:18:44] recognize God because all we
[1:18:49] see is brother Samuel Browning
[1:18:56] or we miss the angel because all we see
[1:19:00] is brother
[1:19:02] Nathaniel all we see is Wayne Lawson or
[1:19:06] all we see is fill in the
[1:19:09] blank and we we we fail to
[1:19:14] realize that God is still here
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:20] living that's right living in a
[1:19:23] five-fold Ministry
[1:19:27] and when the preacher's
[1:19:28] preaching we're not entertaining the
[1:19:31] presence of God because we don't
[1:19:34] recognize that it is
[1:19:37] God oh it's sure is well we had a good
[1:19:40] service here this morning it's quiet
[1:19:41] here
[1:19:42] tonight we don't recognize him because
[1:19:46] he's behind human
[1:19:49] skin right he's behind a human Veil
[1:19:55] can you say
[1:19:56] Amen now I think we've got to recognize
[1:19:59] the presence of God can you say Amen
[1:20:03] someone says well I can't see God
[1:20:06] Amen I say God is here whether you see
[1:20:08] him or
[1:20:10] not I say the angel of the Lord is here
[1:20:12] whether you whe whether you can see the
[1:20:14] pillar of fire or
[1:20:17] not brother Brandon put it this way he
[1:20:20] said how many knows there's a difference
[1:20:22] between the appearing of Christ and the
[1:20:23] coming of Christ two different words now
[1:20:26] the appearing the coming now's the
[1:20:28] appearing the coming will soon be he's
[1:20:31] appearing in the midst of us doing the
[1:20:32] works that he once did in his church now
[1:20:35] you're a part of that church and by his
[1:20:36] grace you believe uh you believe I'm a
[1:20:40] member of that church amen and and and
[1:20:42] he goes on down he says but my Ministry
[1:20:45] is a different Ministry from a pastor or
[1:20:47] a teacher he says if I say things wrong
[1:20:50] Brethren forgive me I don't mean that
[1:20:52] but this is my Ministry see to declare
[1:20:56] him that he is
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:02] here amen so as
[1:21:06] Believers we have confidence in the
[1:21:09] words of that Prophet sir to say that
[1:21:12] he's with us amen
[1:21:16] amen I think there must be an

[1:23:11] matter all right well praise the Lord
[1:23:15] you listening to your music your your
[1:23:17] cell
[1:23:21] phones now back when I was a kid you had
[1:23:23] to have a wire right and someone would
[1:23:26] have came up with a cell
[1:23:27] phone and didn't have a wire I'd said
[1:23:30] you are absolutely nuts yeah because I
[1:23:34] had to see the proof all right it's got
[1:23:37] to be connected to a wall
[1:23:38] somewhere or it don't
[1:23:41] work but today there's no cords
[1:23:46] whatsoever but it's picking up into that
[1:23:50] fourth
[1:23:52] dimension right now we're in the third
[1:23:55] we're in that the first three dimensions
[1:23:57] time space and matter I I believe it is
[1:24:00] but this fourth dimension is where is is
[1:24:03] is where amen it goes beyond your
[1:24:06] eyesight it goes beyond well can you say
[1:24:08] Amen so it is with God you don't see him
[1:24:15] many times you might not feel him but
[1:24:18] God is
[1:24:23] here and God sent a prophet to let you
[1:24:26] know that he is
[1:24:29] hereen God sent a prophet to say he's
[1:24:33] here brother you're you you live with
[1:24:35] such and such and such and such and you
[1:24:36] just had this and this and this and this
[1:24:38] sister you had a surgery 20 years ago
[1:24:40] and I can see the docker and he looks
[1:24:42] like this and he hears it and he says
[1:24:44] this and this that and the other it was
[1:24:46] God letting us
[1:24:49] know the prophet letting us know that
[1:24:52] the mighty angel
[1:24:56] amen praise the Lord amen I don't need
[1:25:00] another Prophet to come and tell me he's
[1:25:01] here that's right he's already proved
[1:25:03] he's
[1:25:05] here what I've got to do though I can't
[1:25:08] see though I might not always feel
[1:25:11] though I cannot come on I can't taste
[1:25:13] but I know he's
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:19] here sir
[1:25:21] therefore I can entertain him
[1:25:26] amen now that that Mighty Angel was not
[1:25:30] was not prophesied to come in any other
[1:25:32] generation but this one brother brandham
[1:25:34] would say we don't have any reverence to
[1:25:37] God everybody just thinks he's so secure
[1:25:40] until they don't reverence God like they
[1:25:42] should why why do they do this because
[1:25:46] they're
[1:25:48] not conscience of his
[1:25:51] presence that's the reason people do
[1:25:53] that they don't recognize it they can't
[1:25:56] they can't comprehend that they're in
[1:25:58] the presence of God their minds become
[1:26:00] so perverted taken up in the things of
[1:26:02] the world until they don't even pay
[1:26:04] attention to it they go to church sure
[1:26:06] but to realize that you're in the
[1:26:08] presence of God not only in a church
[1:26:11] wherever you are you're in the presence
[1:26:13] of God if they could do as David said I
[1:26:16] put the lord always before my face
[1:26:18] therefore I shall not be moved as long
[1:26:20] as the Lord was before him he could not
[1:26:23] be
[1:26:27] moved another place 63 in influence he
[1:26:31] said you must remember that God is
[1:26:32] watching you every
[1:26:33] hour he watches you when you're
[1:26:36] asleep now I think that's the reason
[1:26:39] people do those things is because
[1:26:42] they're not conscious of his presence
[1:26:44] yet he is there whether you think he is
[1:26:47] or not he sees every look that you make
[1:26:50] every move that you make he knows all
[1:26:52] about it but we ought to realize that
[1:26:57] can you say
[1:27:00] Amen be careful little
[1:27:02] eyes what you
[1:27:04] see be careful little eyes what you see
[1:27:08] for the P father up above looking down
[1:27:12] in Tender Love Can you say
[1:27:17] Amen he's here right recognizing
[1:27:22] him understanding that he knows every
[1:27:25] thought that you
[1:27:27] think and he has come to Earth to
[1:27:32] fulfill his word in
[1:27:39] you if you're sick here
[1:27:42] tonight remember he's
[1:27:45] here he sees when the baby's sick he's
[1:27:49] there with you he's wanting you to
[1:27:53] recognize
[1:27:55] amen when your mind is about to fall
[1:27:57] apart and you just don't know which way
[1:27:59] to go remember when the preacher no war
[1:28:02] you you can't get a hold of him when
[1:28:03] Mama you can't get a hold of it
[1:28:07] remember he's here
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:17] hallelujah the reason why
[1:28:21] we I I I I think our our attitudes
[1:28:24] toward
[1:28:25] him I you know the prophet would say
[1:28:27] that our that our Spirits are are are
[1:28:30] magnetized to the spirit world am man
[1:28:33] that Spirits travel on words what your
[1:28:37] eyes and your ears that ushers it into
[1:28:39] the soul and Man songs and television
[1:28:43] and Internet and text and and and and
[1:28:46] all of these things and we become so a
[1:28:49] we get we get so uh uh uh subjected to
[1:28:53] these
[1:28:54] spirits and those Devils tried to keep
[1:28:57] us out of the presence of
[1:28:59] God but on the other hand amen a a
[1:29:03] prophet's voice and gospel music and the
[1:29:07] presence of the Lord and what can you
[1:29:09] say Amen brother Bram says there's three
[1:29:11] regions above us and there's three
[1:29:13] regions below us Satan and his angels
[1:29:16] have come up to Earth in this Dimension
[1:29:18] God and His angels have come down to
[1:29:20] earth Amen in this Dimension and what
[1:29:23] are they here to do they are here
[1:29:25] looking for
[1:29:28] subjects
[1:29:31] right in this final day amen well can
[1:29:36] you say amen amen but I just want to
[1:29:39] tell you amen the power of the Holy
[1:29:42] Spirit if we can recognize his presence
[1:29:45] if we can recognize him in our midst if
[1:29:47] we can recognize him amen when we're in
[1:29:50] prayer I'm not just saying another
[1:29:52] prayer I am ENT entertaining the Lord
[1:29:55] I'm not just reading the Bible I am
[1:29:57] entertaining the Lord I am not just
[1:29:59] coming to church but I'm entertaining
[1:30:01] the Lord I'm coming amen with a with a
[1:30:04] Heart of Worship I'm coming with a heart
[1:30:07] of praise and sincerity I'm coming to
[1:30:10] give everything of God I'm going to wash
[1:30:12] Jesus feet I'm going to love him I'm
[1:30:14] going to adore him I'm going to give him
[1:30:16] everything that he is worthy of he has
[1:30:19] come down for me and while he is here I
[1:30:23] am going to entertain
[1:30:27] him can you say
[1:30:31] Amen brother Brenham would say when you
[1:30:33] receive the Holy Ghost amen he would say
[1:30:35] when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[1:30:37] heart quickly you become a two-fold
[1:30:39] being one of Earth to die one of Heaven
[1:30:42] to live his body is still subject to
[1:30:44] death but in his soul he's passed from
[1:30:46] death into life his body he's he has his
[1:30:49] Earthly contact with his five senses and
[1:30:51] his Spirit he has contact with God
[1:30:53] through the Holy Ghost and the angels of
[1:30:55] God visits them speaks with them they
[1:30:58] are messengers sent from God to reveal
[1:31:00] to bring messages from God to the
[1:31:02] individual can you say Amen I'm living
[1:31:05] in this world I'm living in this
[1:31:07] condition but I have one that

[1:32:34] believe he says that's him you might not
[1:32:37] be able to open your eyes and see him
[1:32:39] because he's in a spirit form the
[1:32:41] invisible God but he dwells among a
[1:32:43] visible people making himself visible by
[1:32:46] his promised word in that people then he
[1:32:49] asked do you understand now
[1:32:54] bumping Hall well glory to

[1:35:20] subject that's bad when Pastor thinks
[1:35:23] that

[2:17:52] amen how many say
[2:17:53] [Music]
[2:17:57] amen God has certainly
[2:18:01] spoken amen certainly
[2:18:04] spoken Satan would like to try to bring
[2:18:07] the definition and defining of what we
[2:18:10] need and what things need to be
[2:18:13] done that's the way this Brother Martin
[2:18:16] and brother Wendell took that that to
[2:18:18] make us think that we need to be
[2:18:21] entertained and it's not the real Joy
[2:18:26] the greatest joy in your life and our
[2:18:30] life is to entertain
[2:18:32] him you can have and we've all been
[2:18:35] there there's times that I can talk to
[2:18:38] everybody in
[2:18:40] here you can click on one
[2:18:42] video you can click on something else
[2:18:46] click on something else and before you
[2:18:48] know it it's been
[2:18:52] time and after that a little bit of time
[2:18:54] you just feel
[2:18:57] so and it isn't even it's not sinful
[2:19:00] things that you've been looking at it's
[2:19:01] just you're just like
[2:19:04] ah because none of those things have
[2:19:10] value in your life even as a young
[2:19:12] person no matter who you are always
[2:19:16] evaluate things by how is this going to
[2:19:19] increase the value of Christ in me
[2:19:24] Satan's always interested in devaluing
[2:19:27] taking away but God wants to bring value
[2:19:31] to your life when you entertain
[2:19:34] him he brings out of you what he placed
[2:19:38] within you and there's no Greater Joy
[2:19:41] there's no greater
[2:19:43] pleasure I'm a
[2:19:45] witness of times that when my flesh
[2:19:49] don't feel like praying
[2:19:52] times when I don't feel like
[2:19:55] studying times when I don't even feel
[2:19:57] like coming to
[2:19:58] church but I'm a witness of
[2:20:02] it that just that little bit of pressing
[2:20:04] beyond my feelings cuz you know what my
[2:20:06] feelings we all have feelings and
[2:20:08] feelings have their place but don't live
[2:20:10] by them don't live by them because like
[2:20:14] the prophet told us he
[2:20:16] said Satan can beat us around the stump
[2:20:20] on our feet feelings yeah he said but
[2:20:22] when I've learned he said as a young
[2:20:24] young Christian he said I learned to
[2:20:27] take what God had said in his word and
[2:20:29] I've met God's requirements and I stand
[2:20:32] right there and that's what matters so
[2:20:35] when anytime my feelings or any feelings
[2:20:38] are against the word I'll take the word
[2:20:41] always take the word always take the
[2:20:43] word it'll lead you out of Gloom it'll
[2:20:45] lead you out of depression it'll lead
[2:20:47] you out always take what the word says
[2:20:49] because the word is true and it's
[2:20:51] certain there's no variableness in the
[2:20:53] word the word solid and always take a
[2:20:57] hold of what God has said and every
[2:20:59] experience that you've had every
[2:21:01] experience is important it's god making
[2:21:04] himself known to you and right was what
[2:21:07] was said right here there's a there's so
[2:21:09] many good points I would really suggest
[2:21:12] going back over this message and and I
[2:21:15] mean going back over it in your
[2:21:18] home taking down
[2:21:21] notes upon those things I know you did
[2:21:24] hear it and right now what brother
[2:21:27] Wendell mentioned there at the end is so
[2:21:30] important of begin to thank God for
[2:21:34] whatever it is that you had a request in
[2:21:36] your
[2:21:36] heart begin to thank him for it you say
[2:21:41] brother Samuel was that scriptural
[2:21:43] brother Brandon would point out at the
[2:21:45] end of The Book of Luke that when the
[2:21:48] disciples had met the resurrection Ed
[2:21:50] Lord Jesus
[2:21:52] Christ and he told them to go wait in
[2:21:55] the city of Jerusalem and be endued with
[2:21:57] power from on high at the end of The
[2:21:59] Book of Luke it describes that event
[2:22:02] that happened in Acts and the Bible says
[2:22:04] they returned with joy and brother
[2:22:06] Brandon points it out in the message he
[2:22:08] said look at that they returned with joy
[2:22:11] before they even got the Holy Ghost
[2:22:13] because they knew it was certain you
[2:22:15] know why if it was just a man who made
[2:22:17] the promise we could doubt but it's not
[2:22:20] a man man who made the promise it's God
[2:22:22] who made the promise it's God who came
[2:22:24] by your tent door tonight it's God who
[2:22:26] came by where you were at and made the
[2:22:28] promise real that hey I'm The God Who
[2:22:31] made the
[2:22:32] promise I'm your
[2:22:35] God Amen and we can be certain with that
[2:22:38] and we can begin to thank him we're not

[2:23:22] presence this is the best place that we
[2:23:25] could be is in his presence right now

[2:23:29] met us here don't you love him amen when
