gonna open with a word of Prayer just talk to you the master here at moment father we thank you for this privilege once again Lord of being in the house of God and coming together in your precious name thank you Lord for the service thus far the songs and the singing and the worship Lord the musicians that a plate so skillfully upon their instruments God bless them I pray Lord and just bless the congregation now Lord as we've worshiped together and I pray Lord you're just got our thoughts this morning have your preeminence and what's said the Lord may it be a blessing may it be a encouragement to the church this morning I pray God we love you and we need you Lord more than ever before bless your word now and bless it lower the service there remain a part of it do we pray in Jesus name Amen and the church said amen I want to read one scripture was one scripture in 2nd 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 1 I was going to continue on this morning with the thoughts on the rapture that I've ministered on the last time the revelation and for some reason the Lord just kept bringing me back to this little thought of doing this today so I'll share some things with you here in a moment but second Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 1 you need to know where that's at it's after 1st Corinthians I just had to say that I'm sorry 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 1 said would to God that ye would bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me amen may God add his blessing to the reading of his word god bless you you may be seated this morning the word bear there Paul was speaking and he says I wouldn't 'god that you would bear with me that word bear means to to to suffer with to bear with - to endure and the word folly that paul uses there is a word that means if I can say it correctly foolishly foolishness senselessness the definition of folly thoughtlessness recklessness this is the Apostle Paul wanting you to suffer with him for a while to endure him for a while while he gets a little frolic he he talks a little bit about himself and about the things that he has done and if I could say it this way it's the Apostle Paul asking for a little bit of grace and forbearance so that he can talk about some things that he's accomplished in his ministry and what he's done talk about his life and if you would give me that same grace this morning I feel like I'm at home here I this is like a second home to me and I feel totally relaxed when I come here I appreciate you all I love you all very dearly and we're thankful to the Lord for our relationship through the years some of you have known us many many years others maybe not so long maybe that's good but we were hard to get rid of once you once you get acquainted with us so if you would just be kind enough this morning to to bear with me I would like to give you a little testimony if I can of myself and I've had this on my heart to do for some time coming different times and and I I remember asking brother Sam if I ever gave my life testimony here and he said I don't I don't remember you doing it if I did then you're gonna hear it again you just pretend like you never heard it I pretend like everything many of you have known bits and pieces of our life or through the years and some you know some good things some not-so-good things that have happened but I want to I want to take this morning if you don't mind and just talk a little bit about what God has done in my life and how I am what I am and how I got where I'm at so I want to start back and just do my little life story I'd like to have it on tape anyways I I've spoken at a couple places but I want to get it pull it together some once said one time they wanted to make a little package out of it I don't ever do that but I'm doing it because I want to encourage you I know life is short and I remember hearing brother Branham say when he was 50 years old or more I haven't done anything for Christ and I thought to myself Lord if he hasn't anything what could we possibly do you know but that was that was a genuine feeling in his heart that he wanted to accomplish more that he wanted to do more he felt like there was more out there and that was before the I think that was back before the third pole was even came into existence perhaps and he was feeling like you know I need to do more and we all feel that way you know saying is I'd rather rust out then I'd rather wear out then rust out because we there's always something you can do for the kingdom of God but when you look back on a ministry with brother Brandon spoke on his life story and you look at his beginning and how God protected him right from the beginning you that they would have starved to death in that cabin and and and died there that winter but the hand of the Lord is in our lives and I don't think there's a one of you sitting here this morning that can't point back and say God was with me here and he directed me here and he helped me here and he led me here you're here this morning because of the leadership of the Holy Spirit in your life and what God has done we've all got a testimony but the bantam said if you can't tell anything else tell how your how your fire got lit that's the only testimony you got it so I wanna I want to just share with you how the fire got living the LaFontaine family that okay that'd be all right this morning it's not a deep deep related message but I think you're hearing that anyways if you're like us over there our church we're I think the ministries our greatness that's ever been that I've ever heard it just seems like God is zeroing in and giving us exactly what we have need of so I thought you know maybe we can just relax today I like to tell people I was born at a very young age I was that's the truth and so I'm gonna be myself today I was born in Port Heron Michigan November the 21st you want to write that date down for my birthday 1943 I'd like to send a little log cabin I helped my daddy bill but I can't say that that wouldn't be it wouldn't be like and I like that's what I used to say I was believe it or not when I was born I was a preemie I only weighed four pounds and some ounces I don't know what the ounces of where they might have been 200 I don't know but they never did tell me I was four pounds of something I have never by the grace of God I'll be 74 next month in November I have never by the grace of God spent the night in a hospital as a patient not even when I was born now there's not a lot of people that can say that but it's only His grace I I worry you know I think about what would happen if I had to go in I that that kind of freaks me out a little bit there was a time when a lady tried to put me in a nurse practitioner said you need to go to the hospital need to go now and I said I have never been to the hospital to spend the night as a patient and I don't want to go now so she let me go home anything called me that night about 11:00 o'clock make sure I was all right he talked about the nice nurse practitioner so I I've never done that but I was born in a nursing home that's what they used to have back then birthing home I guess is what it was called where you would have midwives and different ones come in and mother decided to go there and for some reason I was that's where I was born I was not raised in church I did not know the value of church mom and dad were not churchgoers they were there were sinners dad was what I would call an alcoholic he done a lot of drinking in his past mom both both of them drank both of them smoked and dad was in the Coast Guard so he was like with the sailors and stuff he could cussed with the best of them and he did often and that was kind of embarrassing at times once I became a Christian especially I remember one time we were sitting at the camp meeting in Ann Arbor and they saying with dad and we were sitting in the cafeteria there and everybody was around us going around and we were talking and I said oh by the way dad I'm gonna drop the kids off so you can watch him for a while well he started cussing right the lunchroom and a camp meeting your goals dad I said dad I was only kidding but you know kid I guess with people they got a mouth like that but anyways that that was my upbringing we just never found I guess the time or or anything to to to go to a church there were good people I don't want to paint a bad picture of them but they drank a lot dad would often we'd go to town for shopping and mom and I when I was just a little kid we'd go and they'd always want to stop by the beer garden on the way home dad would to have a drink before he came back to the house and so here I was just a bit four or five years old little butch running around with him you know and so they would drag me into the into the VFW it was a VFW I for years I thought it was very few women that's what it meant because there was no hardly any women there's all guys you know but I found that it was veterans of foreign war and that's why dad I guess joined it but I would he would drag and finally I got the place I got older I said no I said let me sit in a car I don't want to go in there so I sit in the car sometimes an hour 45 minutes an hour waiting for them to go in and have a little drink and come back on and I learn to hate I learned to hate alcohol I saw what it did to my family I saw what it did to my mom and dad and I just you know I just said no I said I I don't want anything to do with that but other than that there were good parents I don't ever remember a time I don't ever remember a week go by that dad didn't bring a paycheck home for our family to put a roof over her head to put food on her table and to meet our needs he was a very very good provider when it come to that he was a hard worker I remember many at times he would go out in inclement weather he was a Salesman he he sold cooked coffee for years and he's so life insurance in most all of his life and he was always a good provider mom on the other hand was a homebody she never wanted to go anywhere she never wanted to do anything she just want to stay at home and she'd always I don't I don't not remember ever coming home from school and all the years of my school life without her being in the house when I got home that's really something to say and I think that helped mold our lives in in the end to what they are today because they were good parents when it come to that dad loved to hunt he loved to fish he taught me to do that we went hunting together went fishing together went the ball games together he likes sports and so as far as a providers they were good that way they were good people and I got my humor from my mom she was the funny one of the family dad was all serious and you know taking care of business but mom mom just was a crack-up she just uh I just bless her heart she got me laughing so much he would just and we needed it we needed a lot of laughter back in those days because there wasn't a lot going on you know to be good about baseball was my love I love baseball my grandfather played professional ball and I wanted to be just like him he played years and years back up in Minnesota before it was the Minnesota Twins before all that transpired he played when there was no padding in the glove you just had a piece of leather there that's when he was playing ball so I wanted to be like him so I said you know I I started that career I just started in Little League I went to Pony League I went to I think it was American Legion I write on up and and and I had scouts that were coming I didn't have them but Scouts came from Detroit Tigers up there partner to see our our all-star games and our playoff games and they were watching us boy I was good I was good I was a great ballplayer and I just that was my whole desire everybody my dad my grandpa they're all oh yeah butch is gonna do it which is going to do it he's gonna be the ball player and then one day I was sitting in church I was about 13 14 years old sitting in church and something got ahold of my life sitting in a Baptist Church in Wadhams Michigan and the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart a nephew said it's your time I'll never forget coming to the offer I didn't know just the center I was a bet in a Baptist Church and the Baptist he can come and pray with me and he said this is how to pray Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins and I prayed after he prayed I'll tell you what when I got up from that altar and I walked away I was a different individual I felt like a heavy load had lifted off my shoulder I felt like I was free I used to swear I used to steal I used to lie I used to cheat all that went away at that one experience at an altar of God and all of a sudden baseball all of a sudden baseball became my second love and Jesus Christ became my first let me tell you something this morning he wants first place in your life if you got anything else going around this there it ain't gonna work he wants first place in our life I got to a place I didn't want to go to church I'm sorry I didn't want to go play ball when was church night I want to be in the house of God my dad thought I'd flip my mind he thought I'd lost my mind grandpa got so disappointed in me oh no but this ain't gonna happen and sure enough it didn't happen you don't have to watch me on Sundays or the weekend hitting the ball I'll come and speak for you I'm so glad to be a part of the family of God I'm so glad for what he done but he took all that away and I was about probably I think about 13 14 years old and a Baptist preacher had come to the door and said anybody want to go to church here I remember saying I do I was in the back room I said I do dad kind of cranked his head around and that's what happened I started going to church with that Baptist preacher and and and he picked up me picked up my picked up my uncle I had an uncle called bebop why are you laughing let me tell you you would be glad to call bebop if your name was Myron Koppel Berger it was his name well my mother I don't know where it all came from but nicknames was her pet peeve she just loved nickname to give an example I've got a a nephew named jinx cousin named jinx rather I got an aunt named boots an uncle named Jeep a niece named pumpkin John Paul was called Charlie Brown oh pretty better kill me for this I know he is Sharon was called Polly Ike was called Jake these were nicknames that's what they called us and I was butch and my little brother was stink I was glad to be called hoods but nicknames were I don't know why they just they just stuck with us all through the years I didn't even know what my name was that I got in school I really did they call called John la Fontaine for roll call and I just sat there Java Fontaine here nobody in somebody put me sitting at you said no they said John I said yeah that's your name isn't didn't know what I was butch I thought butch was a name so I always I always knew there was a God there was I call it a God consciousness about I knew when I did right from wrong I knew I was doing wrong it didn't stop me from doing it but there was something there and I think just about every true believer can say there was a God consciousness there there was something there that we knew when it was right and when it was wrong but it just took a conversion it took a new birth to take that to take that stuff away baseball kind of went by the wayside and I I started carrying my Bible to school every day I take my Bible of school and walk the halls with it and bring it home at night and funny dad was an insurance man and he he was well-known throughout the community and everybody talked to everybody and he comin to me one day and he said he said I gotta talk to you said this carry in your Bible the school said I don't want you to do that no more taking it there and bring it back I don't want you to do that no more don't don't be taking your Bible and bring it and take it I said ok so the next morning I get up I got my Bible I put it in my school bag I went to school and I put in the locker I walked the halls with it put in the locker I walked the halls with and put it a locker I never went back and forth with it no workers he didn't want me to go back and forth so I did what he said but I carried my Bible every day we we went to a school that was pretty tough school it was there was it was integrated it was pretty tough and I remember one day I I was walking the halls and I was just a little runt I was just I wouldn't I wasn't very big anyways and a bunch of a bunch of black brothers brothers I'll call him brothers just by the grace of God got a got me slammed up against a locker in the hallway and they start pushing me around and all of a sudden this walking carpet stepped between me and them I mean this guy was like 6 foot 10 and 250 pounds and he said leave him alone he's my friend I didn't know who it was I never seen him before in my life but I had a friend and they've never bothered me again turned around introduces himself I'm James Thomason he said I see you're a

great guy he McDonald's there by the border will you come across the border and put here and McDonald's hired him on the weekends to walk their parking lot and keep order so that the kids and the

but he was he was a great influence in my life a great brother and and God always has the way of protecting you I remember another time I was we had a the black river was behind our house and about two fields back to the back forever I remember going down there with my aunts and some of the neighborhood people we have now we used to go down there swimming in the Black River well I couldn't swim but I like to splash around in the water and I I don't know I was probably maybe eight years old or something like that maybe a little older or younger I mean and we were down there and somebody was and we were bouncing around here and I fell backwards in the water and I remember going down in that water and all I could think about was it's all over I'm gonna die and all of a sudden arms come down under that water and scooped me up and pick me up and carry me back to the bank and save my life because God's gonna take care of you until he's done using you here in this area I remember another time we were standing out by the road ready ready to go through a school event or something like that and we're standing out there by the road we're walking back we're pitch black out in the country we live out in the country pitch black you couldn't see two feet in front of you and something spoke to me and said step back I step back and a car went flying past me with no lights on God hasn't got his hand on his elect don't you let the devil push you around God has got his hand on his left he is going to take care of you I never forget these things 17 years old getting ready to go into a high score of 16 actually and dad got a transfer from Michigan to Oklahoma City Oklahoma I had to leave all my friends all my upbringing all my I went to school with him all my life over there there were bosom buddies and I had to leave all that my senior year and go to Oklahoma City it was a different world all new friends and little did I realize God was training me for a ministry that was going to cause me to have to leave friends here leave friends here and go and meet new ones and do things it was the beginning of a move in my life that God was using my first week in Oklahoma City u.s. grant high school to seniors got in a fight decided to settle it after school one of them lost went to his car got a gun and shot and killed the other one welcome to the Wild West I said it's given me to death I just a country bumpkin from Michigan I didn't I never saw anything like that everybody was toting guns down there and hunters and you could see them racks in the back of the cars I never I had never experienced anything quite yeah there was something I had a whether was we started somewhere back in there that I started going to church with our neighbor a Baptist Church and I'd met a girl in high score name was Julia you might be doing this you guys I want to make this tape and I want to want to do it right but I'd met a girl in high school she was a similar god girl name was Julia and I got to like in her a little bit so we started you know I can't say the word dating because I'm not allowed to say that any more than a message but we started we started running around together and what would happen was every Sunday night we got to a place that that we both had services Sunday night so one Sunday night I'd go to her church and next Sunday night she'd come to my church so we started doing that we started going you know you know how you are wondering when you're not dating but you're you're real close to something like that and all of a sudden your your ear add to lift her life one Sunday and then you're back here in your own assembling next Sunday know how that is Josh there's an attraction on the mountain you know you gotta so we started doing that and I never forget the first time that I ever ever went to her church I was a Baptist boy most of my experience my life and the music started we went down in the congregation I remember walking to the back door we said about halfway down somewhere halfway marking on this side the fuse went all the way to the to the wall I think that we came down to smile and I went a little halfway down we got in the middle of the aisle I'll never forget Julia was sitting between me and the island between me and the next thing was the wall and I wasn't gonna get out that way so I thought I wanted to make a way but there was Julia and then about 14,000 people and that pute well there wasn't quite that many but there was a bunch of people between me and that aisle and me I'm a little claustrophobic anyway so I was I was uptight anyways the music started we were just sitting Aaron and the music started and all of a sudden people started singing to the music and they started clapping their hands well that didn't freak me out I thought well you know what I got rhythm I you know I felt like I had rhythm every every Saturday morning Saturday afternoon American Bandstand would come on the television with Dick Clark and and they played all the rock and roll songs and all the songs and I take my my sister who was 14 years younger and I wouldn't I take her to my arms we dance all over the living room and I had rhythm so I didn't mind clapping my hand I thought that was cool you know our Baptist Church didn't do that but we did that at her church and I really enjoyed it and then and then we got to sing of a good and all of a sudden the choir got up the choir don't have to sing a special and this is what really got to me they got up start singing we're nearing the show beautiful show my goosebumps come all over me I thought I didn't even know what the rapture was but I could have been in it right then man alive I never heard nothing like that and then all of a sudden somebody down in front on this side started speaking in tongues gibbering and carrying on I punched you I said what's that said he's speaking in unknown tongues I said let's go oh just stay quiet this way I said I kept looking at those 14,000 people so pretty soon he stopped and then somebody over here in front got up and started talking I said this is the middle of a service they were singing and they stopped singing this was going on and she said he's interpreting what he said I said that's cool she said no no it's okay well then we stayed the service and business so then their very next morning I get up probably like up the Raiders we're not call my pastor on phone so I got to talk to you so I went down to the Baptist Church met with my pastor I said this this this and this I said this one on and their tongues and interpretation and I said ain't right is that I know that ain't right he said no no no no that's not right said that you want to stay away from that stuff that's holy rollers and I said I knew it I knew it I knew it it just could be right so I started studying because I wanted to I like this girl and I wanted to help her I wanted a shorter she was wrong and get her straightened out so she could join the Baptist Church so I started studying out in my I opened my Bible to the book of Acts because everybody said that's where that's where all this stuff yeah I don't think I ever heard the word Pentecost until I met her I probably did I don't ever remember even hearing the word Pentecost so I started again I come to Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come as I say what I think when the day of Pentecost was fully come anything that's fully come can't come no more it's already come it's full it's done it's complete it's kaput you can't have any more what's the fullest for what are you gonna eat if you're for nothing so I called you on the phone I said yeah I got to talk to you right now so I went over and met with her I said listen this is it here's the scripture and I boy I was a banty rooster I said I was ready to go I remember one time in our Sunday School room and her son is bringing the Baptist Church they had one of these Papa's that was on wheels that little pompous that they use and I was we around when they going up and down the island somebody said what are you doing said well I'm a roving preacher I said I'm going everywhere I didn't know what God had in store for me but look what happened so I set her down and I said look at this when the day of Pentecost was fully come I said Julia it's already come it's full it can't come no more it's complete it's done it's kaput what do you think about them apples and she sat there quietly nice just calm and she said well let me ask you one question well I was a theologian by then so questions were gonna ask away off man I can handle it you know come on bring it on she looked at me and she said if it's done it's complete it's full and it's over and it's finished and it's kaput like you say how come people are still getting it I don't know what I wanted to that's what I told her all I know is I wanted to if it's real in this genoise I want what they got and so we went on to graduate together grot graduation that year I'll never forget we instead of going to the prom Julia and I went out and hit golf balls on a go on the golf range we were Christians we didn't dance hello I remember as a young person going up and I'll get through it the probably in a little while but our young people didn't do it either our bachelors young people didn't dance either so they would they would have a youth banquet that's where I got acquainted with youth banquets our Baptist group and all the Christian churches in the area would have a youth banquet combined together on prom night so they didn't have to go to the prom and we would have the speaker's come in sometimes we'd have a sports figure come in or somebody to come in and speak to us our young hearts and we had a time to dress up or look nice that's where that's where I got it in my mind from me being a kid we went to we went to these youth banquets and I thought my this is a wonderful thing and I begin to incorporate it into the message some years back but but I always always looked and honored what I felt like was what God wanted me to do as an individual and I couldn't do the things that were doing I remember I was in speech class I took speech I used to be real shy for the bill I would this is the truth I would not get up to the blackboard and work out a problem even if I knew the answer because I'm scared I used to feel like I had a hard time talking to people can you believe that I really hit so I decided when I was a senior in high school I decided well I'm gonna take a I'm gonna take a speech class I thought I need help so I took this speech class and learned some principles and so our decisive grade in the class was to give a speech to the people in the class so I just say well I don't know what I'm gonna speak about but I've got to do that now I got to get up for other people and I got to talk so dad was an insurance man so I went to dad and I said dad tell me all about it selling an insurance policy I don't know how to sell policy so he sat me down we went through all those things I rolled up my speech and I got up and I had everybody get a piece of paper out and I started into this spill about the insurance and everybody needs insurance we got to have this and gotta have that and what I want you to do is put your name down put your address down put your put your this down that down and everything and said okay I said now sign at the bottom says you just signed up for a policy and I got an A and that was easy because I was just talking about something that I knew that you worked for dad but I had to break through the ice of being scared not afraid but I'm gonna tell you what the Holy Spirit can give you boldness like you ain't never seen what he comes into your life so there we were we were finishing up high school we graduated and I had I had a great job when I when I was in high school I had a I worked for a little store called Buchanan supermarket and I made fifty cents an hour 1961 bagging groceries and carried him out to the car I got a raise when I graduated just 60 cents an hour that's what I work for I thought you hate gonna cut it I can't even afford the insurance I just sold the whole class for 60 cents an hour so I joined the United States Air Force took a ride with the guys got all signed up everything come back told mom she was out in the on the garage there in Oklahoma we had we had our horseshoe out in the garage because it didn't freeze enough to have worry about frozen pipes and I think so we had a worker out in the garage and the old kind of ringer washer where you did it by hand and everything she was out there there's a mom I said I got to talk to you I said I want you to know somebody said I just joined I just joined the service well she broke down crying and had a hard time you know and dad come home said you know what's going on and I said well I joined the service I gotta go gotta go he finally got her settle down everything so I got stationed in the first place first place I got stationed was overseas can you imagine that me a young man from Michigan yes it was Goldsboro North Carolina that was my overseas tour I'm telling you Church it was a different world and they had they had the audacity those young people in that church had the audacity to tell me I had an accent you've got an accent I said I got a what next thing they would look at me these are true words that came out of their mouth y'all want a ride on my car I said had really really ride in it I mean I I've been on a few of them but it ain't fun and if you're standing at the table with them in and they wanted you to pass you know the green beans or pass the potatoes they'd say their terminology was thank you for the beans I said I didn't make him I didn't bring him I said thank you for the taters well they meant would you please pass the potatoes it was a foreign language it really was it was it was a foreign language and this was the first time I really ran into segregation was was down in North Carolina because I when I got there I got on a city bus and right away when I got in the bus that said blacks to the back I never saw that in my life there were restaurants and establishments in the city of Goldsboro North Carolina at that time that they had it posted interval blacks not allowed not welcomed and I remember back in the 70s going with a little family over here and just not too far from you got down here to call the Johnson family there they were in the message the Johnson family they believed at that time they believed the message I don't remember where they are on a precious family I went down to we were going down to North Carolina it's a special meetings down there and we decided to go together and went together we're in a restaurant down there in the south somewhere to eat something and and we got sit down and somebody come up said said your come here but they're not I'll talk about their 70s I said what are you talking about I'm gonna go get cowboy you're gonna wake you out man it was that strong and that powerful well I've never experienced anything like that I we grew up together we had great times and not-so-great times one of my first fistfights and only fist fights was with a little black boy and he could box me and that kid could fight he was something else about he he would have cleaned my clock of the teacher hidden tongue but I was holding my own I just I hadn't fallen yet anyway so so I went in the I went in the United States Air Force and I arrived on a Saturday or Friday night it was I think Saturday I got up and I started looking in the phone book for a church to go to and I was a Baptist but I knew Pentecost was right because I knew that's what I needed I needed that experience so I'm looking in the phone book and I'm going through the pages and all of a sudden my eyes fall on Pentecostal free will Baptists it's it glory to God I can hit both of in one Pentecostal Fremont back except who and I never thought it so I call the pastor up I said hey I'm excited I want to come to your church I mean I just got to the Air Force Base he said we'll have a car there for you in the morning don't worry I'll come pick you up and we're taking so I started going to the Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church and I decided I want to sing in the choir because we're nearing destroy I wanted that I wanted that experience so I'm standing up singing in a choir one day at the Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church and I got a little happy and I started clapping my hands to the song and two guys on either side of me grabbed my hands and put it on my side say we don't do that here I said we don't know I said I'm in the wrong place so I realized then they were more Baptist than Pentecostal no matter what they said so I had a couple buddies that I admit in in in in the military and the service they're in the Air Force one of them was I called him big bill and the other was a little bill because the reason they did that one was big one's a little but big bill and go bill there they called me one day and said hey we're going to revival meeting over at the Church of God wouldn't want to come with us I said sure I'll come with you so went over the revival meeting that night at the Church of God and something got ahold of my life like I never had before I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I had a powerful experience that night the altar there netilat Church come away from there again a different man different than what I was before I couldn't I couldn't just believe it all but I had that experience and I knew it was real I remember brother Branham singing a message called the great coming revival and outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Chicago in 1954 he said look the Holy Spirit when he has come he will lead and guide you into all truth and will show you things to come from that time I've watched the hand of God from the Baptist Church to the Pentecostal church to the oneness church to the message where I've landed not looking for anything else believe I got everything God's got for this generation and for this time I was excited I was on fire I had fire shut up in my bones i sat down and I wrote my mom and dad a letter I said dear Mom and Dad I prayed over God dear Mom and Dad you got to quit your smoking quit your drinking put your cussing you got to repent and give your heart to Jesus Christ and start going to church love butch I put that in Volvo I put a step on it I leave my hands on and I prayed over I said God a North this letter let it be a blessing to them God move on their hearts Lord in Jesus name I set it off well mom would write me every week mom had impeccable handwriting they used to hire her from companies where we lived up in Michigan to write out their invitations to sales and things like that because her handwriting was just beautiful every week I'd get this beautiful handwriting from a week went by two weeks went by all of a sudden this letter comes at us now mom's handwriting as a dad I said to really got to the core of it so I open his letter up it didn't even say dear just said push don't bother to come home you make up your own bed dad well I was Christ you know sometimes you do everything you feel is right you try everything you feel is right and all of a sudden it doesn't work right hello one two three god bless you nice to meet you we'll edit that but you see what were they don't come home but yeah yeah yeah I get that a lot sometimes you do everything you try everything you think it's just right it still doesn't work so I got a real lesson that day how not to treat your parents I remember one time when when I get this great revelation about Christmas I called him and I said don't you buy a thing for our kids we don't celebrate that he that holiday hold for wisdom God where's the whistle crushed him crushed him so they started getting around it Isaac had a birthday on the 28th of December has it every year by the way same date and so they wouldn't send any money for Christmas they'd send it for iyx birthday and say bye everybody a little something well years later I realized how stupid I was and that's not the right approach not the right attitude and I finally found out what the Prophet did and how he handled things and everything like that so I went to the mall I don't know we wasn't leaving her where it was I went to the mall and went up said I agree Santa Claus is lab and I had to take a picture and send it to mom and dad Happy Holidays to you know I figured but you know you get you get sometimes lopsided sometimes yet you get off-kilter sometimes you've got to learn that the Holy Spirit needs to really lead you and not you try to lead the oldest way because sometimes you can get totally out of the out of the will of God and out of the mind of God and it's a it's a terrible thing when you do that when you're doing you try to get ahead of God and again what's going on so he sent me this letter and I just crushed me and it was it was in February of 1962 I was 18 years old when the Lord called me into the ministry never forget it I was so Wednesday night prayer meeting at our Church of God there in Goldsboro North Carolina and everyone was praying around the altar after service and I decided I was going to go upstairs and one of the Sunday school rooms and so I walked around went upstairs and there was a light about a block away or two blocks away there was a little street light that was shining had enough light in the room that I could see to get around the seats and everything so I didn't turn the light on but I I knelt down and I started praying there that night February 1962 and all of a sudden with my eyes closed the the the room just became illuminated like a pillar fire like a light great light was in this room well I remember the presence of God coming and I was praying and I started speaking in tongues and all of a sudden I started interpreting and I heard this voice say go do the work of an evangelist you go and I'll go with you and then after several minutes or whatever it was it kind of waned and went away I come down that night and I said I believe the Lord's called me to the Ministry well my pastor heard me telling big bill what had happened in the room and so he said we got the youth meeting this coming Saturday night I want you to preach let's find out if you're called or not I guess I buddy yeah we see what's going on so I I said sure yeah here I was I was ready to preach right I've been called for a half hour and sure so I learned from him I learned from his wife his wife the girl in the preacher and so I had about with her too I mean I I knew how she preached I knew who he preached in so I could vary between I could fall I'm sure so I went to the you went to the youth meeting and ever forget it what did he believe in that day it was in the fellowship hall of our church and and and the Pope was setting up here and they were back there did I do that again did I knock that off the game huh oh it's right down there would you pick it up for me sighs I'll tell you what we'll get rid of this put it right on there where it belongs I'm already kidding I'm only kidding you know that I'm sure you sure you know that not that didn't use me okay I'm telling you 74 even up here I can feel it so I'm in this youth meeting and they do the songs over there and I'm standing up there not preaching in the pulpit and and and I'm preaching away to the young people just going like a Gatling gun because that's what we did in the south we just we spit it out fast as we can spit it out and I'm saying it and all of a sudden I had an out-of-body experience and I remember stepping back from my body and watching me in the pulpit preaching and I was just going in a preaching and I stood back the other said is that me am I saying that I remember vividly I'm never doing it I was watching myself and I was standing there watching myself in after a few minutes I stepped back into my body and I went in to finish the service I never had that before never had a sense I don't believe but I had an out-of-body experience and I knew I knew that God had anointed I watched the anointing I knew what the anointing was because I had experience for myself firsthand I've never seen anything anything quite like that well it was in it was in January of 1963 that I first heard about William Branham January 1963 just before the seals were open there was a brother and sister Woodard that had come to two goals for North Carolina is set up a big tent and they were Church of God evangelist he would preach one night she would preach the next night and they set us down during the day young people and start talking about William Branham and how that he was a prophet of God and how that God was going to come to Jeffersonville he was going to come to Jefferson feel and God was going to reveal the revelation of the seven seals and I'll never forget they said we're gonna go early we're gonna get there every morning early we're gonna stand in line we're going to get see we're going too fast all week because we want to hear this revelation well that planted a seed in my heart that this must really be an important person in her being a woman preacher I thought later I thought about how in the world of could she but she may have quit preaching after that I don't know but it planted a seed in my life that I knew this must be a great man I got out of the Air Force in 1963 after two years with an honorable discharge I talked to my superiors and different ones about my ministry God had called me too I was already holding revival meetings around the state and different churches so they finally saw fit to let me out two years early with an honorable discharge so I could do what they called community services a looting for community services your community I'm yeah I'm giving you a service no that's and and I did I got out and started rate right away with the full-time ministry preaching and going around and doing those things one of the one of the meetings that we had there one of my revival meetings it was I think it's Smithfield North Carolina we've been having you know when you had revivals back in those days you didn't have Friday Saturday and Sunday a weekend meeting or you know to service on Sunday where our special meetings this week okay we have a we're gonna have Sunday morning Sunday night Friday night Saturday night Sunday night sure we're gonna know that wasn't a revival that wasn't the meeting back then the meetings were four five six weeks they would go constantly I used to take a Monday night rest night so that people could go to the grocery store and get their groceries and do their laundry and get caught up on things around the house because they've been to church every night of the week so we were in the middle of that revival and God was really moving people were giving coming to the Lord giving the hearts to God and I remember I went out for a lunch and one of the Deacons home or one of the trustees home I can't remember what it wasn't invited me over for lunch so we're dinner Sunday afternoon and I was standing in his living room and there was a door here the kitchen was back in that part of the house and everybody had gone back down I was standing a living room looking looking in a mirror the culture was in front of men are just standing looking here and all of a sudden an open vision broke in front of me and instead of that mirror I was looking at the service and there were people all around the altar they were praying everywhere people were crying and the Holy Spirit was moving and I remember looking up at the clock on the walnut said 12:00 midnight and all of a sudden the vision went away boom there was the mirror there was a couch there was a living room and people started coming back in I've never had one before or since but I know what it was now to have an open vision it wasn't too many nights later two or three nights later exactly what I saw that day came to pass in that revival me because god no lie his word is always the truth that's why brother banner can have such confidence when god's shouldering those things to speak it that's thus saith the lord because god don't lie so one of the meetings that we had in north carolina i'm sorry i'm taking so long I won't take I won't take long ger than I and I take but I'd met a couple an older couple there was a brother and sister would I believe West's brother sister Wes was their name they were the Church of God that I was preaching at and so they had a son who was in the Air Force he was in Madison Wisconsin and he was a pastor of a church in Madison Wisconsin he was stationed there and I guess on a full-time pretty full-time basis but he pastored a a Church of God and so they said I think my son would be interested in you coming up there so they gave him my address and and gave him my address so I was in back in Michigan but this time and at Mom's house and I got a letter from this brother West who was in the service over there Madison said I want you to come and hold me a revival so Church of God I said that's good so I went through Madison Wisconsin in I think was February of 64 that he invited me I went and we went at crazy times I know but went up there I think was February of 1964 that that I went to went to Madison Wisconsin and preached brother West a revival meeting at that time and there's where I met sister Loretta her brother Virgil used to come there to the church and he called her up and said this this evangelist is over here he's a great guys great preacher he got to come in here him so I was sitting on a platform one night waiting for service to start and all of a sudden he she got off on work she caught a cab she came in Brigid was with her and I looked at her I said whoa my heart sunk I said this has got to be the most beautiful woman I've ever met in all my life and I'm gonna marry her it was love at first right sight I fell in love with her I said lord I I've never seen anything such such a beautiful but I'd been told by her brother that her dad where she went to church across town was a oneness preacher independent Jesus name oneness preacher and they didn't believe in the Trinity they believed in Jesus only baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well that wasn't gonna work with her in that church and me and Church of God so I decided to have a little serious conversation with Loretta so the first time I met her was that night I walked back from the platform after we preached she was standing in the back with her brother and I walked up to her and the first thing I said to her sugar Hanson now what's this stuff about one God great way to start a relationship she she said excuse me you know I could kind of already she's so precious and so you know during the course of this meeting her dad and mom and her brother start comes you have eight brothers seven of them were still at home and started coming the revival meeting you had two sisters they started to come to revival meeting and all of a sudden her dad who was this one this preacher had this one that stirred invited me a Trinitarian Church of God to come over to his church and hold him a revival oh this is strange but I got to get this girl so I said sure I really didn't need to pray about that Loretta went to that church that's where I need to go so I said I'll be over there about three weeks later four weeks later I went to Madison to her dad's Church but I stayed with brother West because I didn't know these one of those people you know I knew brother West he was he was he was a brother he was the air force man he was he was my so I stayed with brother West in trinitarian brother and I held them a revival across town well like I said revivals didn't last you know just a week or two we probably went for weeks there with their dad name and the whole time that were there the whole first time were there I started studying the the Godhead because I wanted to show her I had to show her where she was wrong here I go again I had to short what she was wrong and I used to tell her she's sitting back there she'll tell you this is the truth I said I used to say if you join the Church of God this week we'll get married next week and we'll start traveling you can sing play the piano for me we can have a good time traveling for the Lord they should tell her that I need somebody to sing else who would play the piano that's the bottom line what more reason is there to want to marry a guy then he needs your piano playing and he needs your vocals I don't sing parts I don't sing any I don't have that gift to sing el tor or tenor I just don't do that I'm just got the big mouth I sing lead you will be the alto you would be the piano player I will be the leader of the whole so I started staying where dad gave me a track I never forget her dad gave me a track that he had was called the bread of life and it was all the Scriptures of the Godhead from Genesis all the way through the revelations and I took it because I knew well this will keep me from having to look all these things up so I started in this track and I started writing these scriptures down and I started going to them in the Bible and Cyrene is I gotta prove her wrong I got pretty well after about a week or two of that God gave me the revelation of the oneness of the guy and I started preaching it before the revival was over staying at brother West's house didn't go over real good he said what are you doing he said you said what what about this this there's one god stuff what are you doing I said I said well if you mean do I believe in one god yeah I believe in one God no I don't believe in three anyway he told me in his house I said you believe in three said yeah I believe in through your father holder go I said well I guess the difference I believe when I get to heaven I'm gonna see why so I'm gonna see three big people up there well he came to me later I apologize I want you know but he was upset you know because I was going with not dating I was enjoying the company of this of this other one this girl so by the end of the revival when they revival closed we had a big baptismal and I was the first one in the water to get baptized the Evangelist got baptized first I preached myself right into the altar and right into the revelation gave my heart to the Lord all over again got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and started going out preaching among the oneness churches then well finally it was quite a time I'd done all of that I preached all in weeks and and I hit the I hit the water her dad actually her dad went on to go to a brother bands meeting down in Jeffersonville and they when they did the marriage and divorce series at the high school down there he attended those that series of meeting so he got acquainted with brother branham's ministry quite well and he brought back a little 45 album I don't know if any of you remember those but that's the first time I heard brother Brandon was on a 45 album they had his voice on there and his ministry on there so that was the first time I got to hear and well I kept working with sister Loretta Ann's trying to convince her with everything inside of me that she should marry her be the best thing she ever done in her life after several months I think I finally convinced her that she she loved me it wasn't easy guys I would I would be out in meetings and she would write me letters and say this is never going to work or two we're incompatible we're too different it's never gonna work I take a money a night off like I did a lot of times in my revival I Drive for hours to come and see her and be there when she got off work and she'd walk out of Martinelli's market she said what are you doing here duh what don't we have an on D or something what's going on here you know she wasn't easy on me but I had perseverance brothers they got a persevere finally I said wilt thou and she wilted and we got married during the fourth mark that down Jude the fourth in 1965 I went to pick her up one day a couple days and few days before we got married I never forget I went to pick her up and they said she's not here I said worry she said well we saw her walking down the road strange you know so I drove down the road and I come up to a place down where the highway wasn't everything and she was in a phone booth making a phone call and she was just coming out I pulled up I said what you're doing is that I was trying to call brother Branham just see if we should get married but he wasn't home he's out in a meeting sister media told her he wasn't there I said you don't have to worry about it honey I got this no problem at all it's the will of God don't you worry about it so she's been worried about her no she hadn't worried about it Santa so we finally got gotten got those things resolved and got married and we went on our honeymoon we we decided we're gonna drive over here to Cleveland we've done a lot of preaching in the Cleveland area and oneness movements over there independent Jesus named churches and brother there was a brother Deaton over there they had a church he was an old snake handler from down south at snake bites on his hands where the snakes is a bit there before him he was an old-timer and he had a son he had a son named Danny Danny Deaton Danny gave his heart to the Lord and in a revival meetings there and he's a pastor over there today I think in the UPC church he's still over there pastoring good a great great man of God I love him with all my heart and we went around around about about this message he was set for hours and talked and he just couldn't see it and I said well I'm not here to give you a revelation by any means so he's a good brother he loves the Lord but I appreciate him and I just pray for him they got that'll help him you know and gotta lead him and guide him and direct him so we got married in 1965 and we went on a honeymoon and I preached I preached on our honeymoon well the Dayton fell down I was in town I was there on a Sunday morning he said you're preaching this morning brothers young people kids guys if God's called you to preach probably not a real good thing to do it on your honeymoon but we haven't stopped since that day it's been our life it's been our goal everything we do but I got enough money by preaching here that Sunday to go to Niagara Falls we hadn't planned to go on the hanger Falls that that's that was a big deal you know so they said why don't you go to Niagara Falls just down the road here so I got that money went to Niagara Falls and we had a great time at that in Falls we got pictures you know it was freezing it was so cold and it still in June it was cold the flowers weren't blooming yet or anything like that it was it was cold but we went we went to Niagara Falls we could see we're there we took pictures yeah I remember taking pictures and she all the money we had in the world was in her purse and she left her purse sitting by the side of Nagra Falls while we went off walking somewhere everything we've had was in there we would have been Niagara Falls residents if she hadn't found it but we went back there after I don't know half-hour or whatever it was we went back to her and it was still sitting there untouched so we were we're very thankful for that so we went there got to go there got to got to enjoy that and they had they had blessed us when we got married they had given us a car brother brother the Indians sisters husband and her in her had given us a 1955 Chevrolet those were great cars at a 1955 Chevrolet but they had they had problems with the headlights they would rust out he ever know anything well our device generally and and and we had we had what I call the UFO light because we had it we had it tied together with baling wire trying to hold on the headlights one light would shine right up in the trees and the other went right down the side of the road that's the truth it's a truth I called him he left all night well we could get by pretty good on the road ones because we would you when you see the edge of the road with that light that was going along to hearts then finally the door lash over here and the passenger side after john paul was born the door wouldn't shut anymore so we had to tie the door shut it wouldn't latch anymore way to tie the door shot and we had to untie it and get out and tie it and get in when we got in so once John Paul was born he was born in 1966 he was born in Ann Arbor Michigan we decided you know what we had better do something about a vehicle because this is not going to work what if he's out there someday and it happens you know the door would fly open and and some you know you see this loop there works John Paul II he's gone so I don't remember what we got what we decided we had to do something and we were just you know our life was just that it just it was it was the grace of God that kept things going along John John Paul was born in 66 and April and Sharon come along in 1968 she was born in May of 1968 and so it was about 71 we moved to Lima area and that's where Isaac was born in 1972 Isaac was born in Lima Ohio got to meet all the people down there and it was that winter I think of 72 that we had our first youth banquet ever down there and people came from all around Indiana different places brother Neville's daughters came up from Jeffersonville I remember the big youth banquet I loved it we did two years in a row we did it one year in Lima next year and Wapakoneta and that's where we got it started through that through the through the country and this time that now they got them everywhere they got youth banquets that go to all the young people we ever had nothing like that until we in the message I'm talking about back in those days until we we decided to have our own we started those and then the camps began to come along and God began to bless our lives we moved to Illinois in 1974 I think it was we started working in a coffee house a little little ministry storefront where you work with kids on drugs and kids off the street we go in there and Friday Saturday night and take our guitars and instruments so we play music and sing and kids would drop off the street we had we put we started a 24-hour love line we called it the love line and we put it in our house and we put brochures all over the city if you're depressed if you're thinking about suicide if you've got problems call call it well we'd get calls in our home my kids tell me about it still at all hours of the night people would call and say I'm gonna get him inside suicide I'm gonna do this order that what you said why would anybody do that because we loved him we wanted to help and my motto was if I could help somebody even if I could just get them off in drugs if they never came to my church if they never saw what I'm saying I remember going as a senior in high school in Oklahoma I remember going to my first gospel concert ever and and the Brotherhood man was supposed to be there by the name of Tony Fontaine he was a great recording artist at that time I guess and his dad had passed away they couldn't come and a little lady come called door seekers came to that meeting and sing that dance she sang a song that said if I can help somebody as I pass along then my living shall not be in vain that's stuck in my heart and from that that we came my mold of him I Drive God if I can just help somebody I can't give him a revelation but you know we had several young people that came to the church came and went on with God because of those little meetings if we can just help somebody as we pass along 1976 was the was the year of the Centennial Bicentennial was it 1976 I think it was and we had a big old school bus we painted blue we rolled on the side of it what are we right on the side of it Jesus Saves I think we put on the side of it we put a sound system in it speakers on the outside set of drums in the air so I like to play the drums and Paul was playing the guitar and they were singing going down the road in the Bicentennial parade they were singing gospel songs and come to come to the the the storefront come to the coffeehouse we're gonna have meetings tonight we're gonna have a good time just things we did crazy things we did because we love people that was a big thing back in their 70s and we wanted to help so finally we Bicentennial year we got it called us through a series of things oh my I could tell you there's so many things I could tell you but it's time to go so many things that I could tell you well it's time to go on but anyways I thought about the coffeehouse and the things that that God led us into for thereon but it wasn't it was in there 19 1990 1976 that we started traveling full time we live we left our things and storage there in you know in the basement of a church there and Rockford Illinois and we started traveling full-time across the United States and Canada seven and a half years we traveled full-time two years out of those seven and a half years we didn't even have a home everything was in storage during those two years and we had no home we just kept going from place to place revival to revival meet and we had a great time and we meet new people and go on the road and this one to recommend another brother we'd go on the road if we didn't have anywhere to go we'd go visit mom and dad hey thought you might want to see us having been around for a while so we're here - how are you saying well students I can get my next meeting book we'll be leaving but nice to had moment is so we ended up we ended up traveling that long and then 1979 sherry was born we're living in Tucson and she kind of just added to our group about two and a half years old three years old she started singing and heading south saying it's a sin but she she didn't like traveling when the Sun went down sherry would just freak out when the Sun was going down time out time out time out down on Mount a steel in the word motel I melt down la mode I want motels you doing shut out you know we would do all night in the van we'd travel all night we'd go everywhere everything we do a motel on my non-dominant at Cal then it started to get expensive when you had to stop and get Terry a motel every night it was we learned what that was all about for sure but we sang at youth meetings and sang a camps all over Georgia Ohio Michigan Louisiana Arizona and we just because we had a genuine love for the for the youth I usually always tell young people true there's two things about young people that I like to establish with them first of all first thing is there's not two messages there's only one message there's not a message for the adults and a message for the young people it's one message and we've got to believe a church whether we're young or whether we're old God sent a message he gave a message for us to believe there's in the spring of 64 I got to back up that God gave me a dream about brother Branham I never was in his meetings I never got to go because I was holding revivals he was holding meetings I guess I just didn't realize the importance the spring of 1964 God gave me a dream and in that dream I was with brother Branham in an auditorium we were we were back in the vestibule the front of the auditorium and we were talking brother Branham I was standing there talking I'll never forget it and I remember I can't remember the subject I can't remember what we were saying but I remember hearing on the loudspeaker where brother Branham please come to the platform it's time for you to speak and he looked at me and he said brother I've got to go now they're calling for me and I said that's fine brother Branham I remember him going back toward the back headed back to the back I went in the auditorium went up in the balcony and I sit down he came out on the platform a little little man that he was he started preaching the word and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said hear ye him that's my Elisha do you think there's anything in the world that's gonna get me to deny that or say that's not right or he's wrong I'm not gonna say that that's his Elijah I found out who he is I didn't understand everything I couldn't understand the message and things he was preaching a lot of times I matter of fact I preached I preached unto serpents heap of the bill for a year before I realized twins were born from treated for mothers the light bulb hadn't gone off yet funny when the light bulb went off all that makes it more simple it's not important if you understand it do you believe there's a lot of things I may not understand but I believe I believe God sent a prophet for me I'm gonna hear you him just like the the word said that day this is my Elijah here you him and from that moment on I started hearing him and so we're in these meetings and going on and that meeting the me just the second thing I tell young people feed your experience don't just go to camps and go to special meetings and have an alter experience and never feed it you got to read your Bible every day you got to pray put your nose on the book find out what he said because you're young men are gonna be leaders someday you're gonna have a family you've got Terry's you're gonna be the husband you're gonna be the one bob says the wife desires to know anything let her ask her husband at home what are you gonna do when your wife comes to you start asking you questions my wife did come to me one day and said where was where was Adam when the serpent was beguiling Eve I said I don't know thank God I'm not sure where he was yeah it's questions they're gonna ask you questions and you better know what's in that message because you're gonna have to answer the questions put your nose in the book listen to the tape here what God had to say he spoke to you in this generation and he wants you to hear it for sure many of our young people going on to be preachers already in this message and many more will come and be deacons and trustees and song leaders and in the women we come wise maybe you're gonna be a pastor's wife or a deacons wife or a trustee is what you need to learn what you believe and why you believe it because you need to give a be able to give an answer for the hope that lieth within you let me try to wrap this up with a 1983 we moved to Canada and I started pastoring the church up there in Ontario and once I once I got there I realized and I'm gonna close this in about ten minutes guys once I got there I realized that you know it wasn't good enough to try and put the you know that's somebody else answer I used to I traveled in evangelist you somebody statements like people ask me questions so we'll ask her pastor that's the easy way out for the evangelist ask your pastor but I realized I couldn't do that no more I was the pastor that was scary it was scary I remember one time I was preaching from brother who had gone overseas and I was taking his services for him and a brother come to me after service said can I talk to you and I said sure so we went to the office and we sit down here sigh I need to talk to you something need your advice I said ok this is one time I was going to give my advice he said 20 years ago when I was younger I murdered my best friend I killed him I was drunk and nobody knows it what should I do you know what I told him ask your pastor when he gets home and I'm so thankful I could do that sometimes we think we're somebody we're not anybody it's only the grace of God that keeps us going but he was convicted and God was speaking to his heart and I said I know there's an answer but I said you need to talk to your pastor and get his advice and do what he says but now I was pastoring I got down in my bedroom floor I locked the door I told my wife I said to rather don't bother me if I never come out of this bedroom don't bother me I got down on my knees and I put my Bible in front of and I said god I need answers and I need him now and I'm not leaving this room until you speak to me I said I hear brother Jelani Jenkins I hear brother Bissell I hear these other preachers preaching all over the place and they're they've gotten revelation they're preaching things that I don't understand God I need to know what's going on I started reading a little message that I had laying there and all of a sudden God dropped the revelation in my heart and this word began to open up to me brother Branham said it's a new book brother let me tell you what it's a new book when God opens your eyes to it you can't see nothing but it God gave me a revelation right there on my knees in that bedroom I was so happy I didn't even have to miss supper I got to come out I got from God that day everything I needed to talk about this message listen friends this is real this isn't something fake this is the real genuine thing 1984-85 we started having youth camps we had the winter youth retreat up there several years in Canada that's where it started many years ago but the Lonnie brother Geoff Jenkins brother then Williams and all them used to come there and then went Dan and Dan down there and in in Louisiana and him and Tim decided they were gonna have a camp down there they called me on the phone said we want to have a Louisiana youth camp but we're not going to have it without you I said well you guys can do it no said we won't even do it if you don't come so first two years of Louisiana camp I went and preached there for them and helped them get it rolling well look what's happened their camps everywhere God is begin to move and begin to open up things for the young people and and and do things all over the place and I realized that the buck stops here I'm closing finally 487 somewhere in that area 88 we started having we started having marriage seminars I never forget the first one we had was on Toledo John Paul wasn't even married yet so he volunteered the baby said all the kids in his church so that his adult couples could come that that was hilarious Paul doesn't do well with babies so the next year he still wasn't married we had two in a row there in Toledo he still wasn't married the next year but he decided he wasn't gonna babysit anymore so he tried to sneak into the meeting I never forget it we're having this meeting we're talking to the couples and all of a sudden this janitor walks in the door with his monkey Dunkey hat on and he brings a ladder in he sets the ladder in the middle of the room he goes up like he's changing a light bulb I said what's going on and I said check this guy out so they went back he was Paul he had snuck into the meeting in disguise and was changed pretending like you wanted to hear about the couples things yeah so the couple guys got him scored him out of the room and we went on with our meeting and next thing I know the cook shows up in the back of the room with a mustache and a hat and he's standing back there and I said the is there something you needed and just want to be it I said that's not a cook he was Paul tried to sneak back into the meeting again hey hey this quarter-mile because these meetings are so good you want to be at a couple's me have you ever had one we had them all over the country after that we started to have a couple's meeting and everywhere we ever went so let me just let me stop we left Canada after about 75 years eight years start traveling again I think we cover about three years and then we moved to Arkansas and we stayed in Arkansas for about ten years to June of nineteen our 2004 but we're down there it's a great time we loved Arkansas I love the people down there and had a great time down there and we moved back after after we're there ten years Lubeck let's Leto just quickly I'm going through these quickly now and then we spent you know ten years now at 18 I started preacher this is what you get what you see is what you get 18 that started preaching 21 we we got married 32 age 32 we started traveling full-time I was age 40 when I started passing Ontario I was eight fifty when I started pastoring in Arkansas I was eight sixty when I moved back to Toledo and we moved after that we went at age 70 I moved down to Murfreesboro Tennessee for two and a half years and guess what when we moved from Murphy's world's 1/2 years ago I put an application in at a place for the two-bedroom with a garage so mom and I would have placed out of the cold it was handicapped accessible lower counters lower sink at a washing dryer in two and a half years went by we hadn't heard and think last week they called and said there's a villa opening up would you like it guess what we're gonna do this month coming up I'm gonna move we are experts at another room but just across town not very far so anyways that's that's pretty much it now what the question I guess on my heart this morning as I close this is first of all what can I do for you how can I help you how can I be a blessing to you I don't know what the future holds Church we live in perilous times I look at the the storms the fires hurricanes I've never seen a day like this just seems like earthquakes one after another storm I believe we're living in the very edge of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I wouldn't want my lines tied up now I'd want to make sure everything was in order because just any day now our Lord is coming I don't want to miss it the key you don't get nothing else today get this the key to life is the baptism of the Holy Ghost make sure you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the most important thing in your life that you need to be sure of you may not understand everything you may not be able to explain everything you may not know everything but know that you know that you know that you've been filled with the Holy Ghost and you're on your way to glory let me close by reading a scripture Romans 12 verses 1 and 2 Romans 12 verses 1 and 2 speaks it like this I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God what about you I'm doing my part that I feel God wants me to do I feel like I'm coming down to the end of my Road don't know how long I have be 74 next month in November I'm getting old church I'm tired but I still want to follow his leadership I still want to be in His perfect will I don't want nothing but that divine will but what about you what have you done for Christ what are you doing for Christ if you're gonna do something for me you better hurry because time is running out what's your life story like if I can help somebody as I pass along in my living shall not be in vain is there somebody you know that you wanted to talk about a relative or a friend or someone that you wanted to mention about the Word of God about the message the our to better do it don't wait your parents your children your siblings your loved ones don't wait till it's too late don't wait till they're laying in the casket somewhere and they can't they can't hear you to know more I was privileged with my mother and dad to be able to pray for both of them before they left this world thank God I was able to do that but I'm asking you what have you done for Christ you said well I'm not a preacher that doesn't have anything to do with it we've all got a testimony we've all got a life this story to tell what have you different raised this power his positions if you come with your head bowed in your eyes closed I want you to think about your life for a minute think about your testimony think about what you have done for the kingdom of God and to help somebody and while your heads are bowed and your eyes are closed I wonder if you might feel like you haven't done enough you slip your hand up stable it's not pray for me I don't feel like I've accomplished what I need to accomplish just honesty just being honest god bless you bless your hands well the next question I have then is what are you gonna do about it what's your decision what are you gonna do how are you gonna change that are you gonna take that burden off your shoulders place it at the feet of Jesus right now I want you to speak to him and say Lord forgive me I don't feel like I've done what I should do Lord everything and Lord God I want you to take control of my life and help me to be a witness help me to be a
