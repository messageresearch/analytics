[22:09] um at work uh there's gentleman named
[22:11] Tony Castro we usually have a round
[22:13] table with the bosses sometime I work
[22:15] I've had many blessings with this little
[22:17] company I believe the Lord has me there
[22:18] for a reason other than just
[22:20] working so one of the round tables Tony
[22:22] was there and I were in the meeting and
[22:25] uh as we gave a little background of Who
[22:28] We Are we were on the horn and then got
[22:30] to Tony Tony said he found a renewed uh
[22:32] interest for his faith and it struck me
[22:34] I listened to him it intrigued me so I
[22:35] said okay so then um he Liv He Works
[22:38] near pretty close where I am in the
[22:40] vicinity of of the warehouse where we're
[22:41] at and so then um when I got to share
[22:45] with him a little bit my faith I said I
[22:46] said I invited him I said you go look at
[22:48] the uh the website you examine
[22:50] everything you want and he raised his
[22:51] eyebrows at me I said you go look at
[22:54] anything and everything and you come
[22:55] talk to me about it and then um when uh
[22:58] uh over time I've been sharing parts of
[23:00] the message with him but I never got I
[23:02] was ever able to express or convey
[23:05] brother Braham to him just yet so I said
[23:07] there's going to come a time I'm going

[23:43] was grateful that I gave him the
[23:44] websites it's kind of a rare thing when
[23:46] you can talk to somebody about the Lord
[23:48] and even more when you can share me bits
[23:50] and parts of the message I said we're
[23:52] trying to just not convince people that
[23:53] we're right we that God's right and
[23:55] we're trying to share with them that
[23:56] this is what the Lord has done and not
[23:57] us I said and it's such a blessing when

[46:30] welcome a visitor God bless you it's
[46:32] good to have you here with us amen and
[46:35] uh there's somebody else I'll just say
[46:37] any visitors amen that are here I I
[46:40] don't see uh too many others but uh it's
[46:42] good to have everyone here um I think
[46:46] it's kind of self-explanatory I don't
[46:48] we're not going to be able to have that
[46:49] fire pit uh Fellowship here tonight and
[46:53] um sometime or another we I think we're
[46:55] just going to have to do it like tou and
[46:57] go I know brother Shane's been looking
[46:58] at the weather I've been looking at the
[47:00] weather and sometimes we have our best
[47:01] intentions to plan things and I know I
[47:04] know we have to plan it because
[47:06] sometimes it's just for different ones
[47:08] making uh the sacrifice and taking off
[47:11] work in order to be for the fellowship
[47:14] uh but uh uh when Lord willing we'll try
[47:17] to just stay on that and try to arrange
[47:19] something here that uh if it can come up
[47:22] at some time whether it's on a Sunday or
[47:23] a Friday evening or something just so we
[47:26] can have some time together I believe
[47:27] Fellowship is
[47:29] important that's why those things like
[47:31] that that I have on my heart uh I think
[47:34] that's one of the things that even with
[47:36] h before covid came along but that's one
[47:38] of the areas that Satan wanted to attack
[47:40] was fellowship and he he hates
[47:43] Fellowship um you know he would like to
[47:46] cause Unity on the wrong things but we
[47:49] want to unify around the word of God and
[47:52] I think if the prophet of God could
[47:53] stand there in the message shalom
[47:57] and he was so moved by seeing that
[47:59] people had brought lunches to eat
[48:02] together and how moved he was to see
[48:05] that Fellowship I tell you to me this is
[48:07] not like the workplace you know you you
[48:09] appreciate I appreciate different ones
[48:11] that I worked with when I taught school
[48:13] but when 3:00 came that relationship
[48:18] ended but we're a body of Believers am
[48:23] that's different we're part of the
[48:24] family of God and it's just something we
[48:27] just we love the fellowship amen around
[48:29] the word of God and with one another so
[48:32] maybe the Lord just praying that God
[48:33] will just make a way for us I'd like to
[48:36] look in the scriptures here I just have
[48:38] one
[48:39] scripture the that we'll read and that's
[48:42] out of First Kings 18:21 thank you
[48:45] musicians
[48:47] amen and First Kings
[48:51] 18 and verse 21
[49:05] and Elijah came unto all the people and
[49:09] said how long halt ye between two
[49:15] opinions if the Lord be God follow him
[49:20] but if bail then follow him and the
[49:24] people answered him not
[49:27] a
[49:29] word I want you to think of this this
[49:31] was a God saw the
[49:34] need that was in the heart of
[49:37] Israel and remember there were 7,000
[49:40] that was reserved unto the
[49:43] Lord and they needed a courage to be
[49:47] able to
[49:49] stand now they had the word of the Lord
[49:52] but how the circumstances and things of
[49:54] Life had just uh things had come in but
[49:58] there were some real Believers remember
[49:59] God told Elijah after this incident
[50:02] Elijah ran is that right and God told
[50:05] him I've got 7,000 that's not bowed a
[50:09] knee to Bow and the prophet told us he
[50:13] said what it was is they needed to see
[50:15] the Living God and once they saw the
[50:17] Living God it would give the 7,000 the
[50:21] courage to step out on the word of God
[50:25] and that's that's that's what God has
[50:27] done in this hour we're we're not
[50:28] walking under a theology we're not
[50:31] walking under a this makes sense and I
[50:33] can prove this that's not how we're
[50:35] walking even though the word scripture
[50:38] must compare with scripture is that
[50:39] right and all all the all the all of the
[50:43] word of God is given by inspiration it's
[50:45] profitable we could go through all of
[50:47] those things but the way that we serve
[50:49] God Is Knowing him by divine
[50:53] revelation that's where divine
[50:54] revelation has prevailing power power it
[50:57] gives us authority over the enemy amen
[51:01] you love him amen God bless you as
[51:03] you're being seated this morning I'd
[51:05] like
[51:06] to also read uh from Romans chapter 8 if
[51:12] we
[51:13] could and
[51:15] um Romans chapter 8 and verse
[51:20] 1 the Bible says there is therefore now
[51:24] no condemnation to them
[51:27] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[51:32] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[51:36] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[51:38] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[51:42] sin and death for what the law could not
[51:44] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[51:48] God sending his own son in the likeness
[51:50] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[51:54] in the flesh that the righteous
[51:57] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[52:00] walk not after the flesh but after the
[52:04] spirit now notice here in verse five
[52:07] this same theme for they that are after
[52:10] The Flesh do mind the things of the
[52:13] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[52:17] the things of the spirit for to be
[52:20] carnally minded is death but to be
[52:24] spiritually minded is life and peace
[52:28] because the carnal mind is enmity
[52:30] against God for it is not subject to the
[52:33] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[52:37] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[52:39] God but ye are not in the flesh but in
[52:42] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[52:45] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[52:48] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[52:51] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[52:54] because of sin but the spirit is life
[52:57] because of righteousness but if the
[53:00] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[53:02] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[53:05] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[53:09] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[53:12] dwelleth in
[53:14] you and so when we look here all the way
[53:18] through this portion of scripture that
[53:20] we even would read here in Romans 8 I I
[53:23] think when that reality strikes it's
[53:25] more than a word but it strikes where
[53:28] there's no condemnation when we have we
[53:31] have passed from Death unto life where
[53:34] there's no condemnation to them that are
[53:36] in Christ Jesus he he has made a way for
[53:41] you and I to live in a full Victory uh
[53:45] to where the devil has no hold Upon Our
[53:48] Life to where there is there is an
[53:50] authority that within our lives and
[53:52] there's nothing let me just say it like
[53:54] this there's nothing as great as the
[53:57] Liberty that the Holy Spirit brings by
[54:00] the new birth there's nothing as
[54:02] liberating as that you know and so when
[54:06] we're looking at these things I knowing
[54:08] what God has called us to and the
[54:11] purpose that he would have within our
[54:13] lives um there's a something that I
[54:16] would like to just speak on or at least
[54:18] begin to deal with here just a moment
[54:20] and uh that we'll look at here for just
[54:23] maybe a few services but I want to deal
[54:25] with this if you're go and switch it for
[54:27] me Brianna I want to go ahead and I want
[54:29] to deal with this overcoming
[54:32] hindrances and so and so when we're
[54:35] looking at things you know of hindrances
[54:37] there's sometimes you can see where a
[54:39] hindrance itself is something that
[54:41] provides resistance it's a delay it's an
[54:45] obstruction to someone or something and
[54:48] you know you can see here within the
[54:49] pictures you've got two of them right
[54:51] here the where that here you have an
[54:53] obstacle here's a mountain that stands
[54:56] before them here you have a tree that's
[54:58] Fallen within the road those are things
[55:01] that uh it's circumstances and things
[55:04] and hindrances of life that come up just
[55:06] like when the scripture says if you say
[55:09] to this mountain be thou moved that
[55:11] mountain can be sickness that mountain
[55:14] can be all sorts of um situations it
[55:17] might be something on the JW but then
[55:19] there is also things that can be
[55:22] hindrances that is holding us back from
[55:25] what God is is calling us to these are
[55:28] things that we want to be able to look
[55:30] at because I believe that this is our
[55:33] desire we we want we rejoice in the word
[55:36] of God but the thing that God's desire
[55:39] and God's Delight is by making his word
[55:42] so plain and so real to us is to where
[55:45] that we begin to see our own selves in
[55:49] the word it that takes on a total
[55:51] different light when you begin to see
[55:53] yourself in the word of God it's one
[55:55] thing to to see brother brandham it's
[55:57] one thing to see your pastor it's one
[55:59] thing to see a Dad or Mom or somebody
[56:02] else but God's desire is that you would
[56:04] see yourself in the vision when you see
[56:09] yourself in the vision that changes
[56:12] everything and so this is God's desire
[56:15] this is why listen this is why the
[56:17] preaching of the Gospel Goes Forth even
[56:20] in this hour this is why God his prayer
[56:22] would be buy of me gold that's tried in
[56:25] the fire that and and that you would
[56:28] also uh come and receive of that garment
[56:31] that would clothe that thy nakedness
[56:33] would not appear and that your eyes
[56:35] would be Anointed with isav God's this
[56:38] is an hour of seeing this is an hour
[56:42] where that we we are not in no longer in
[56:45] the mouth age we are in the time of the
[56:48] seeing age and from the seeing now comes
[56:50] in to the very intelligence of God's own
[56:54] mind coming in to the body of Jesus
[56:57] Christ so to think where we are are
[57:00] living in this hour God's desire
[57:02] remember is to see his word being made
[57:06] manifest through our lives now you know
[57:10] when we look at this all before our
[57:12] lives when we the scriptures that we
[57:14] read here uh regarding that there is no
[57:17] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[57:19] and we can see how that you know even
[57:22] with that aspect within Christ that
[57:24] we're always going to have before us
[57:26] there's going to be choices there's
[57:28] going to be decisions that we have to
[57:31] make we're not and this is why that
[57:34] Satan battles in the mind because it is
[57:37] in the mind is where decisions are made
[57:41] this is why that he he'll try to hinder
[57:44] and try to move and try to make you know
[57:46] come within that Spirit realm he'll want
[57:48] to distract you Satan now let me just
[57:52] say this just as much as God is coming
[57:55] by his word to influence us into his
[57:58] word to move into him Satan also comes
[58:03] to want to influence by trying to show
[58:06] us all of the
[58:09] impossibilities the prophet said he
[58:11] wants to show you all the defects he
[58:14] wants to try to put all of this picture
[58:16] here of even what God has promised in
[58:19] regarding our lives he wants to try to
[58:22] hinder us he would like to try to cool
[58:25] us down the prophet said when Satan he
[58:28] says here it is Satan will even try to
[58:31] get ahead of a meeting to block the
[58:34] oncoming visitation that God has for you
[58:37] so Satan he he realizes that the word of
[58:41] God is is more powerful it will always
[58:44] overthrow him but it overthrows Satan
[58:48] when the word is received into a channel
[58:53] that is open and available and then the
[58:55] word expresses itself for what it is in
[58:59] the very power and authority to perform
[59:02] itself amen I want you to think of this
[59:04] here we are not walking and you know
[59:07] it's very to me I always love that in
[59:09] Romans 8 because the scripture was very
[59:12] clear we're not walking after the flesh
[59:14] yet what a what an incredible thing here
[59:16] you and I I'm looking and I'm seeing all
[59:19] the way through here flesh bodies we are
[59:21] still in the flesh but what Paul is
[59:23] writing in is that our uh our tie we are
[59:27] no longer tied to this Earth this is not
[59:31] this is not my home this is not what I'm
[59:34] tied to my first birth I'm not tied to
[59:37] this is where that we are no longer in
[59:39] the flesh but we are in the spirit and
[59:42] other words we become like a a a
[59:44] two-fold being here we are in contact
[59:47] with Heavenly places and yet here
[59:49] walking upon Earth and then others in
[59:52] the carnal mind will look at the
[59:55] spiritual mind and wonder why the
[59:58] approach I mean what how did it make
[1:00:00] sense for Israel when they needed water
[1:00:03] to speak to a rock the carnal mind would
[1:00:05] say that's the driest thing to go
[1:00:08] after right see God God
[1:00:11] Specializes in showing himself and it's
[1:00:15] so contrary to the carnal mind I mean
[1:00:18] what how how would it make sense for a
[1:00:20] man to walk around Jericho seven times
[1:00:24] and on the seventh day seven times the
[1:00:28] carnal mind would say that's foolishness
[1:00:30] but the spiritual mind says this is
[1:00:33] God's
[1:00:35] word and this is the spiritual mind is
[1:00:38] that when the spirit of God has so
[1:00:40] anchored in the depth of that soul and
[1:00:43] there's come forth a new birth that even
[1:00:46] there's nothing within the word that
[1:00:48] that Soul could not punctuate with an
[1:00:51] amen amen that's a real evidence of this
[1:00:55] Holy Spirit in a life listen friends
[1:00:57] anointing is not an Evidence gifts are
[1:01:00] not an Evidence nothing outside of the
[1:01:03] word being punctuated within our life
[1:01:07] because gifts will fade all of those
[1:01:09] other things do we believe in them we do
[1:01:11] but they are not above the word the word
[1:01:13] is above
[1:01:15] everything amen it is the word that
[1:01:17] brings and puts the gifts in the order
[1:01:20] it is not the gift that we're resting
[1:01:22] upon we are resting in the word because
[1:01:25] that is the only place that is
[1:01:28] certain right we we're not falling back
[1:01:32] on oh God led me to do this and God
[1:01:34] showed me to do this it's we are the
[1:01:36] Bride of Jesus Christ and it must line
[1:01:38] up with the word of God when it comes
[1:01:41] down to everything in our life it's B
[1:01:44] it's got to be based upon God's word is
[1:01:47] that right that's what God is coming
[1:01:49] back for is for a word
[1:01:52] bride so this is what the Holy Spirit I
[1:01:55] hope you're with with me now this is
[1:01:57] what the Holy Spirit has come to produce
[1:01:59] in this hour this is why the bride
[1:02:01] message is more than just the baptism of
[1:02:04] the Holy Ghost are you hearing me the
[1:02:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for
[1:02:09] the word himself are you hear me
[1:02:12] Pentecostals had the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:14] Spirit but now the word of God is to
[1:02:17] come and that word by the baptism of the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost in our life is to produce a
[1:02:22] word bride a life that becomes a
[1:02:25] prisoner of the word not just an
[1:02:28] anointing upon our spirit not just with
[1:02:30] gifts but with a life that falls back on
[1:02:33] the word every single time that the word
[1:02:36] is above everything including my own
[1:02:40] ideas and that's where it brings us to
[1:02:43] choices no doubt every one of us have
[1:02:46] felt this way we've come to these places
[1:02:49] in our
[1:02:50] life and I want you to think about this
[1:02:53] what the effect of redemption
[1:02:56] has upon our life I love how brother BR
[1:02:59] says this in the message the breach when
[1:03:02] we are
[1:03:03] redeemed we no more want our own choice
[1:03:07] right but we want his
[1:03:10] choice me say let me say this to you if
[1:03:13] if you find the word of God Grievous if
[1:03:17] you find the things hard let me just say
[1:03:20] to you like just say God let that full
[1:03:22] Redemption strike my soul because listen
[1:03:26] the price was paid at Calvary but full
[1:03:28] Redemption is where the Holy Ghost
[1:03:30] claims that
[1:03:31] Soul it's where it ties you back in to
[1:03:35] that reality of what God did for you
[1:03:38] amen and this is where that it comes
[1:03:40] down to that there's nothing that God
[1:03:42] could ask of you or I that we can that
[1:03:44] we would look at and say Lord no I'm not
[1:03:46] going to do that or I can't do that this
[1:03:48] is an effect of redemption it's not
[1:03:51] listen to me now it's not that there are
[1:03:54] not things that don't come our way that
[1:03:56] we have to die to oursel the Lord Jesus
[1:03:59] when it came time for that word to be
[1:04:02] fulfilled he prayed three times if it's
[1:04:05] possible let this cup pass from me but
[1:04:08] because he was redeemed Hallelujah you
[1:04:10] say redeemed the prophet said at the
[1:04:12] River Jordan Future home he said here
[1:04:15] the spirit of of God came down and he
[1:04:18] claimed that body that he himself had
[1:04:21] created that's the same way that the
[1:04:24] Holy Spirit you see he was the prototype
[1:04:26] of what the Holy Spirit would do to you
[1:04:29] and I as a Believer what is the Holy
[1:04:31] Ghost doing it's coming to claim what
[1:04:34] belongs to him we were always Sons and
[1:04:37] Daughters of God and it's the holy
[1:04:40] spirit that leads us into full
[1:04:44] obedience so now to think of this
[1:04:47] Redemption and to claim back he he was
[1:04:50] claiming that body that belongs to him
[1:04:52] that's what the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:04:55] claim back back every son and daughter
[1:04:57] of God comes to make known to you and I
[1:05:00] who we really are and now with that
[1:05:03] Redemption know the effect of it we we
[1:05:05] want his choice I I want to know Lord
[1:05:08] what do you think about
[1:05:09] this that's what I want to know when a
[1:05:12] man has been redeemed he don't care
[1:05:15] anymore for scholarship he don't care
[1:05:17] for any more of the things of the world
[1:05:19] the wisdom of the world he don't want no
[1:05:21] choice at all Christ has been his choice
[1:05:25] and that's all of it he is redeemed he's
[1:05:29] just no more wants to lead himself he
[1:05:32] don't want nobody to talk him into where
[1:05:33] to go and what to do he just Waits and
[1:05:36] finds out the choice of his maker then
[1:05:40] he goes in the name of his maker then
[1:05:43] when the maker tells him where to go
[1:05:47] hallah that's walking in Authority
[1:05:49] that's recognizing that you know that I
[1:05:52] I'm not my own I belong to him I'm not
[1:05:54] come to do my my own will I'm I'm not
[1:05:57] this is this walk is not about me it's
[1:05:59] about
[1:06:00] him right my whole life or whatever your
[1:06:04] span of life was or maybe even here
[1:06:06] before a full surrender it's always been
[1:06:08] about you but when the Holy Spirit has
[1:06:11] come it now our life becomes about him
[1:06:14] listen we're not waiting to go and look
[1:06:17] at some nativity scene your own life
[1:06:20] becomes the scene of why he came why God
[1:06:25] himself descended and was born right
[1:06:28] here Among Us he came that he might be
[1:06:30] born inside of our lives and it's it's
[1:06:34] not a nativity scene out here but it's
[1:06:36] Christ himself in Simplicity that now is
[1:06:40] born inside of our life and how fitting
[1:06:42] it is that there was no place for him no
[1:06:45] room for him in the end but he was born
[1:06:48] in a stinking stable where where it was
[1:06:51] just a smell in the stench how fitting
[1:06:53] it was that he himself South would come
[1:06:56] down and through the new birth he would
[1:06:59] be born in lives in Tabernacle whereby
[1:07:02] sin had so entrenched and filled our
[1:07:05] life but the grace of God comes down and
[1:07:08] cleanses our life and now it's Christ
[1:07:11] himself he is the focal point of our
[1:07:15] life like the prophet said that
[1:07:19] centerpiece of the garden is where all
[1:07:21] Paths of the garden lead into it becomes
[1:07:24] the focal point and that's the things
[1:07:26] that in our life where Christ becomes
[1:07:28] the focal point then everything is
[1:07:31] pointing to that everything our
[1:07:33] decisions that that's what we want our
[1:07:35] decisions our choices that it reflects
[1:07:37] Christ Lord I don't want my decision I
[1:07:40] don't want my choice it's God's going to
[1:07:41] let me choose but I want his choice amen
[1:07:45] amen that's what I want I want I want
[1:07:47] what he wants I I that to me is what I
[1:07:49] care about more than anything else is
[1:07:51] what he wants what his will is this is
[1:07:54] why when the script says we look not at
[1:07:57] things which are seen cuz they're
[1:07:59] temporal they'll fade away you can look
[1:08:01] at we can see that things will fade and
[1:08:03] pass but we look to the Unseen to the
[1:08:06] Eternal that's where we have to be fixed
[1:08:09] and our lies and our lives fixed on this
[1:08:11] is why the scripture say we do not walk
[1:08:14] by faith but by sight even with Moses
[1:08:17] the Bible said by faith he forsook Egypt
[1:08:21] and and he not fearing the Wrath of the
[1:08:23] king he endured as being him who is
[1:08:26] invisible I want you to think of this
[1:08:28] Moses himself remember he was born the
[1:08:31] prophet tells us with this great quality
[1:08:33] of faith in him but he needed to come
[1:08:36] into the presence of God and for that
[1:08:39] Faith to move from just an intellectual
[1:08:41] to a supernatural faith it needed to
[1:08:44] become anointed by God by the word is
[1:08:48] that right and notice you know when when
[1:08:51] when all of this here he had a faith
[1:08:53] within his life and you know when you
[1:08:55] consider it the prophet tells us like
[1:08:57] this he said he said when God begins to
[1:09:00] deal with your life if you start looking
[1:09:02] around at others and say well they can
[1:09:05] do this and they can do that and this
[1:09:08] person claims to be a Christian and and
[1:09:10] this person claims to be he said you'll
[1:09:12] only end up paralyzing your
[1:09:15] faith don't get your eyes on nobody else
[1:09:18] I believe there ought to be real
[1:09:20] examples in the house of God but don't
[1:09:22] you ever settle for just an example of a
[1:09:25] mortal human being always let your
[1:09:28] example be Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ and he's the word so if our
[1:09:34] example is the word it doesn't matter
[1:09:36] who who who fails here or who fails
[1:09:38] there it doesn't matter our eyes are
[1:09:40] upon the
[1:09:42] word oh my and this is where if we'll
[1:09:45] keep our eyes on him listen as the
[1:09:48] prophet said your faith as he said the
[1:09:50] world will either paralyze your faith or
[1:09:54] your faith will paralyze the world Amen
[1:09:58] it's one or the other oh God let our
[1:10:00] faith paralyze the
[1:10:02] world when the world wants to try to
[1:10:05] move and act upon our life and draw Us
[1:10:07] in into circumstances of compromise and
[1:10:10] other let our faith by looking unto
[1:10:13] Jesus who's the author and finisher of
[1:10:15] our faith it will paralyze the effects
[1:10:18] of the world coming in in our
[1:10:21] life oh my this is why we want above
[1:10:24] everything the will of God Amen God's
[1:10:28] will is what is esteemed above
[1:10:30] everything in our life and his will is
[1:10:32] his word is that right this is why that
[1:10:35] you know God will never lead us outside
[1:10:38] of his
[1:10:39] word is that true it'll never he'll
[1:10:42] never lead us outside of it he'll always
[1:10:44] lead us within his word that's the
[1:10:46] promise when the spirit of Truth has
[1:10:48] come he'll lead and guide us into all
[1:10:50] truth notice in in the book of Ephesians
[1:10:53] chap 1 and verse 7 it says in whom we
[1:10:56] have Redemption through his blood notice
[1:10:58] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:11:01] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:11:04] to the riches of his grace he's never
[1:11:07] run out of
[1:11:09] Grace he's never had a he's never had a
[1:11:12] bad stop day on Grace amen but Grace
[1:11:16] itself brother is unsearchable riches
[1:11:19] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[1:11:22] all wisdom and Prudence that word
[1:11:25] Prudence means a love of God's will
[1:11:27] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:11:30] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:11:33] which he hath purposed in himself I to
[1:11:37] me when you can see God's grace there in
[1:11:39] verse n it was God who made known the
[1:11:41] mystery of his will for our life I know
[1:11:44] there's a lot of things as we look at
[1:11:46] through life and we have decisions that
[1:11:48] we have to make throughout life but even
[1:11:51] with all of that in mind you know
[1:11:54] there's things where we're looking and
[1:11:56] God what is your will concerning this
[1:11:59] Lord what is your will I know what my
[1:12:01] thoughts might be but what are your what
[1:12:03] is your will because you know what the
[1:12:05] longer that you serve God the greater
[1:12:08] you value and esteem being in his
[1:12:13] will you recognize it's like things as
[1:12:15] we grow and we value we value things now
[1:12:19] that our parents told us there that we
[1:12:22] looked at and we said well they really
[1:12:24] don't know what they're talking about
[1:12:26] and and they don't you know and and and
[1:12:28] sometimes we just did things you know
[1:12:29] because that's what they wanted us to do
[1:12:31] and we honored them and obeyed them but
[1:12:34] as you get older you begin to see the
[1:12:37] value of what you're doing and you see
[1:12:40] that's one sign even a maturity is
[1:12:43] maturity is valuing I want God's input
[1:12:47] above everything else it's the value of
[1:12:51] I I've seen where it leads where I go on
[1:12:53] Impressions I don't want to on
[1:12:55] Impressions I want to be led by the Holy
[1:12:58] Spirit I I want to be in a place that
[1:13:00] God can lead me not not to where there's
[1:13:02] a hindrance in my life I want to move
[1:13:05] Beyond hindrances
[1:13:07] amen finding God's will this is a very
[1:13:11] familiar quote Even in our even with
[1:13:14] finding God's will very familiar very
[1:13:17] familiar brother Bram says he's asked
[1:13:19] the question how do you feel is the best
[1:13:21] way to find the Lord's will in some
[1:13:23] important matters
[1:13:27] he said the best way to find the will of
[1:13:29] God is post a survey on
[1:13:35] Facebook the best way to find the will
[1:13:38] of God in some important matters is
[1:13:42] prayer now let me just say it like this
[1:13:45] just because you haven't got a no don't
[1:13:47] mean you've got a
[1:13:50] yes are you hearing me amen we we want
[1:13:53] to know we listen we're let me say we're
[1:13:55] living in an hour you can't take
[1:13:58] presuming I'm I'm just I'm just saying
[1:14:00] it from my heart don't you can't walk by
[1:14:02] presuming we can't walk by well I I
[1:14:04] think this would be best or I feel this
[1:14:06] would be best God is calling every one
[1:14:09] of Abraham's seed to separate from see
[1:14:12] taste feel smell hear reasoning
[1:14:15] conscience imagination God is calling
[1:14:18] Abraham seed to a complete walk with him
[1:14:22] alone this is the time of rapture and
[1:14:26] the Bible said Enoch walked with God
[1:14:30] Amen a time of Walking with God separate
[1:14:34] from all of these from these other
[1:14:35] things so notice how do we find what's
[1:14:38] the best way prayer he says I take it
[1:14:41] before the Lord and it's always been my
[1:14:43] strength I wait upon the Lord and see
[1:14:45] what he says and I just let myself
[1:14:48] neutral to it and don't take either side
[1:14:51] that right there that word neutral can
[1:14:53] be a big word I should have bolded I
[1:14:55] should have capitalized that word
[1:14:56] because staying neutral can be the
[1:15:00] battle right you can have all kinds of
[1:15:03] influences you can have everything else
[1:15:06] that can come your way but remember
[1:15:08] staying neutral that's the key is so you
[1:15:10] say how should I be prayed God let
[1:15:13] everything about me be
[1:15:16] neutral it's not Lord I want this and I
[1:15:19] want that but God help me heart to be
[1:15:21] neutral why cuz if I'm neutral then I'm
[1:15:24] open to him hear from him
[1:15:26] amen and sometimes we've got to remove
[1:15:29] other voices and sometimes it means
[1:15:32] don't confer with others amen
[1:15:36] amen now let me just clarify that that
[1:15:39] doesn't mean you know if you've got
[1:15:40] something on your heart just sit down
[1:15:43] with the pastor but I I will tell you
[1:15:45] those that have experienced this already
[1:15:47] there will be questions that will come
[1:15:49] that I'm not looking for answers to but
[1:15:51] it's questions that you must take as God
[1:15:53] would give it and pray over it and
[1:15:55] consider it am because every decision we
[1:15:59] make in life is very very crucial
[1:16:03] friends it's very crucial sometimes
[1:16:05] there's things that we can look at in a
[1:16:08] manner and think well this does this is
[1:16:10] a no-brainer this doesn't need to be
[1:16:11] prayed over everything needs to be
[1:16:13] prayed
[1:16:14] over let me give you an example just be
[1:16:17] like a man who has a gift as a pastor
[1:16:19] and here's a church that's wide open and
[1:16:21] needs a pastor it does not mean that's a
[1:16:24] no-brainer what it means is it means
[1:16:26] he's got to find God's will because it
[1:16:29] doesn't matter if he is a pastor and
[1:16:31] that church is without a pastor if it's
[1:16:34] not God's will it'll never
[1:16:38] work so this is why I'm saying we don't
[1:16:41] make presumptions we don't even make
[1:16:44] assumptions the message of the hour
[1:16:47] never led us away from seeking after the
[1:16:50] things of God for the Bible said that
[1:16:53] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:00] God oh my I'm trying to get
[1:17:03] somewhere brother BR says I would just
[1:17:05] wait upon it and say Lord now you show
[1:17:09] me what's the decision to makeen amen
[1:17:13] you got to be open to being
[1:17:16] disappointed for what you want what I
[1:17:19] want but see once we've been redeemed we
[1:17:22] no longer want our own choice true amen
[1:17:26] we want we want his
[1:17:27] choice right and then the way you feel
[1:17:30] led to do it just wait a little bit and
[1:17:32] wait a little while longer and see which
[1:17:35] way which side you lean towards which
[1:17:38] way the spirit now father say it like
[1:17:41] this you know it doesn't matter but I
[1:17:44] want you to know what I want I want to
[1:17:46] know what you want to do about it now
[1:17:48] you can't just say
[1:17:50] that now you don't don't you know it
[1:17:53] don't matter and down deep on the inside
[1:17:55] it matters
[1:17:57] right it's got to come to a spot it
[1:17:59] doesn't matter this is where when we
[1:18:02] have been redeemed we can come to the
[1:18:04] place to realize his NOS are just as
[1:18:07] good as his yeses right
[1:18:10] amen that's the way I do about meetings
[1:18:12] sometimes I kind of feel to go this way
[1:18:14] or that way then I'll follow that day
[1:18:16] and that's the way to do it in prayer
[1:18:18] and then you're doing the best you can
[1:18:19] now how many remember when you know Paul
[1:18:22] brother Bram refers to this how that
[1:18:24] with Paul and them they were going on a
[1:18:26] missionary journey and they were at a
[1:18:29] Crossroads Paul they were looking at
[1:18:31] where where do we go do we go into Maia
[1:18:34] or do we go into Asia where where where
[1:18:36] do where do we go do we uh go into
[1:18:38] Macedonia which way do we go we don't
[1:18:40] know which way to go now let me just say
[1:18:42] this to you Paul and them did not go and
[1:18:45] sit down somewhere alongside the road
[1:18:48] and just say well I'm just going to wait
[1:18:50] on an answer to drop here now be very
[1:18:52] careful now but how how was approached
[1:18:55] the Bible said in verse 7 that they were
[1:18:58] come to myasia they assayed that means
[1:19:01] they tested to go into bethenia but the
[1:19:04] spirit suffered them not this is what I
[1:19:07] want you to catch it'd be like you know
[1:19:09] for um a young person going into school
[1:19:12] and they maybe don't know exactly what
[1:19:14] what direction to go do I go this way or
[1:19:16] do I go that way well let me just tell
[1:19:18] you there's General electives that'll
[1:19:20] take care of about your first two years
[1:19:22] and then then you have these roads
[1:19:24] setting before you and you know what you
[1:19:26] can begin to test it taking a certain
[1:19:28] class right here and you know what but
[1:19:31] always always be open to the Holy Spirit
[1:19:34] to say no this is not the way I want you
[1:19:36] to
[1:19:38] go always be open this is what Paul was
[1:19:42] saying let me just say it like this you
[1:19:43] always we always want to be open for our
[1:19:46] plans to be
[1:19:49] interrupted is that right I Lord God you
[1:19:51] know as much as my plans or something
[1:19:54] might be s but it's always open to
[1:19:56] Divine
[1:19:59] Interruption my and they passing by
[1:20:01] Masia came to troas and a vision
[1:20:04] appeared to Paul in the night and there
[1:20:06] stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him
[1:20:09] saying come over into Macedonia and help
[1:20:12] us and after he had seen the vision
[1:20:16] immediately we endeavored to go into
[1:20:19] Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the
[1:20:22] Lord had called us for to preach the go
[1:20:24] goel unto them and this is where the
[1:20:27] Prophet said I believe if you are making
[1:20:29] a decision for God and you do it the
[1:20:32] best you can I believe God will correct
[1:20:34] you and see that you don't go wrong I
[1:20:37] believe God will do it see this is a
[1:20:40] rest but it's always within everything I
[1:20:43] want to be open to him amen I mean you
[1:20:46] know I and look at I like even when
[1:20:48] sisters and many many more time any more
[1:20:50] with brothers too my Lord you know you
[1:20:53] go into clothing racks too I mean you
[1:20:54] know you got sissies brothers that are
[1:20:56] designing your clothes a lot of times
[1:20:58] you know they they like them so good on
[1:21:00] themselves they want to see them on you
[1:21:03] so you got to really pray about what
[1:21:04] you're what you're and even just as much
[1:21:06] as the sisters and things you got to
[1:21:08] pray because there's spirits that are
[1:21:10] there on those racks and things that
[1:21:12] would want to get you to compromise a
[1:21:14] little bit and compromise a little bit
[1:21:15] and compromise a little bit I I think
[1:21:18] this is where we have to have the
[1:21:20] strength of the holy spirit in our life
[1:21:22] and say God if there is a question about
[1:21:25] it the prophet made it clear if it's a
[1:21:27] question about it don't do
[1:21:31] it don't do what this nation
[1:21:35] does one thing that's different about
[1:21:37] our nation they'll let stuff come in
[1:21:39] commer and then prove that it's bad to
[1:21:42] get it taken
[1:21:44] off they don't do that in other nations
[1:21:47] right true it's true I'm not making
[1:21:49] anything up it's that's true that's why
[1:21:52] when you go to Mexico you can go from
[1:21:53] this side to that side and when you go
[1:21:56] down there you can I could buy a bag of
[1:21:57] chips in Texas and buy the same bag of
[1:21:59] chips in Mexico and in Mexico they will
[1:22:02] not allow all that stuff to come in
[1:22:04] there's only like two or three
[1:22:07] ingredients I'm not making this stuff
[1:22:10] up and it's another na but you see what
[1:22:12] it is this is why we don't want to walk
[1:22:14] by that way of just well you know I got
[1:22:16] a question about if you got a question
[1:22:18] the prophet said don't do it that's one
[1:22:21] way of overcoming any hindrance in your
[1:22:23] life amen
[1:22:25] amen if it's all right you know what God
[1:22:27] will bring it around and show you it's
[1:22:29] all right but I don't want to presume
[1:22:32] that it's all right and then my life
[1:22:34] become
[1:22:35] entangled and hindered amen I would
[1:22:39] rather do
[1:22:41] without and be walking with him than
[1:22:45] have and be hindered in my walk with
[1:22:52] God this was let me just drop a few
[1:22:55] things here of where I'm where I'm going
[1:22:57] this is why we don't want our own
[1:22:59] opinions he's he's the one like the
[1:23:02] prophet said we've got to let him be the
[1:23:04] supreme ruler in our life this is what
[1:23:06] the Holy Ghost comes to do you know when
[1:23:08] God comes into your life you you accept
[1:23:11] the Lord as your lord and savior you
[1:23:14] repent of your sins this is where he's
[1:23:16] come in to the welcome mat of our home
[1:23:20] but there's
[1:23:22] doors all throughout our Liv
[1:23:26] life and those doors is every
[1:23:29] compartment in every area of our life
[1:23:32] that God wants to go into yes now he can
[1:23:36] he'll stand there as our savior right
[1:23:39] there on the welcome mat but we've still
[1:23:42] not been fully
[1:23:44] redeemed we still got a carnal mind
[1:23:47] right but you see the way what we must
[1:23:50] do is is let him go to every single door
[1:23:54] you know the very first door that he'll
[1:23:56] come to deal with is the door of
[1:23:58] Pride cuz the door of pride is what
[1:24:01] started it all in the beginning that's
[1:24:03] where the fall came right in heaven was
[1:24:07] because Satan desired a more beautiful
[1:24:10] kingdom is that right Satan preached a
[1:24:14] rebellion in Kingdom he it was a church
[1:24:16] split that took
[1:24:18] place is that right he drew a third part
[1:24:21] of the Stars after him and those Stars
[1:24:24] remember the same thing that we look at
[1:24:26] and recognize that the angels of God are
[1:24:29] ministering Spirits let me tell you
[1:24:31] those demons were one time regarded as
[1:24:34] angels of
[1:24:35] God and they still have their Angelic
[1:24:39] hierarchy when they fail they didn't
[1:24:42] lose their position right is that right
[1:24:45] when that was a Prince of Persia that
[1:24:47] one had always been an overseer that
[1:24:50] withstood Daniel the Prophet when that
[1:24:53] was taking place and that Maniac in
[1:24:55] Oregon came up there and he made his way
[1:24:57] to the platform and remember the Holy
[1:25:00] Spirit accepted his challenge you know
[1:25:03] what Satan's desire was to do was to put
[1:25:06] a hindrance in that
[1:25:09] meeting but one man Hallelujah one man
[1:25:13] let me let me preach now all it takes is
[1:25:15] one vessel Hallelujah that's right
[1:25:17] brother ra said you give me one man
[1:25:20] that's on fire for God it'll do more
[1:25:22] than 10 days of Revival
[1:25:27] all it takes is a surrendered vessel and
[1:25:29] a surrendered vessel is yes Lord yes
[1:25:33] Lord yes Lord yes to your will yes to
[1:25:36] your word Lord amen and the spirit of
[1:25:39] God came in there and accepted the
[1:25:42] challenge and that demon that was
[1:25:46] anointing that man that demon that he
[1:25:49] worshiped remember he wasn't delivered
[1:25:52] because he worshiped it right right
[1:25:55] right but that demon was the chief over
[1:25:58] that tribe of demons where people were
[1:26:01] in CS and they were bound here and bound
[1:26:03] there but when they saw that Chief demon
[1:26:07] defeated the sickness and diseases this
[1:26:10] is why sickness and diseases it's Devils
[1:26:14] it's demons Satan brings diseases but
[1:26:18] God's Army is commissioned to cast them
[1:26:21] out
[1:26:25] let me tell you the the chief has
[1:26:27] already been
[1:26:30] defeated amen we're not worshiping uh uh
[1:26:34] a Jesus of 2,000 years ago he is
[1:26:37] standing in plain view as the mighty
[1:26:40] conqueror who rent The Veil and to he's
[1:26:43] come down to manifest his word manifest
[1:26:46] his promise he's here to meet the
[1:26:48] challenge of the enemy
[1:26:52] amen amen oh glory be to God we want him
[1:26:56] to be the sueme ru supreme ruler he him
[1:26:59] be over our opinions over our emotions
[1:27:01] over our ideas control every fiber of
[1:27:04] our thinking Hallelujah I want
[1:27:07] everything turned over to him
[1:27:09] amen hallelujah I tell you what just
[1:27:13] invite him into every room maybe maybe
[1:27:15] you're sitting here this morning a and
[1:27:17] you just accepted him in as Savior why
[1:27:20] don't you invite him and say Lord go
[1:27:22] through every door of my life Lord
[1:27:24] go through the door of Pride go through
[1:27:27] the door of Faith Lord go through every
[1:27:29] door listen friends I don't believe that
[1:27:32] God is just here to make a a One-Stop
[1:27:34] tour but God himself he comes to live
[1:27:37] and dwell in his children Lord I want
[1:27:40] you to feel every fiber of my being Lord
[1:27:44] walk through every door of my life Lord
[1:27:46] if my Faith's a little weak Let It Be
[1:27:49] operated on by the power of the Holy
[1:27:52] Ghost if my pride needs put in check
[1:27:55] Lord let it be put in
[1:27:57] check you know God assisted Paul with
[1:28:00] Divine assistance lest I should be
[1:28:02] lifted up is that right now I want you
[1:28:06] to think about this this is why when for
[1:28:08] hindrances one of the things with a
[1:28:11] hindrance and how that when you look at
[1:28:13] it when Elijah came to the offering in
[1:28:17] the evening
[1:28:19] time He restored the
[1:28:21] altar he rebuilt repaired the Bible says
[1:28:25] the altar right that word repair is
[1:28:29] Jehovah Rea our
[1:28:31] healer he repaired the altar healing was
[1:28:36] brought
[1:28:37] back and then everything the wood that
[1:28:40] was laid upon the altar the sacrifice
[1:28:42] and just to let them know there is no
[1:28:45] hidden trick here right there isn't a
[1:28:48] private thing in my ear and somebody
[1:28:50] telling me about somebody on the
[1:28:52] platform let's pour water over the whole
[1:28:55] thing 12 barrels full it wasn't no
[1:29:00] man-made
[1:29:01] fire but there came down a fire from God
[1:29:06] and consumed the
[1:29:08] sacrifice and I want you to hang on to
[1:29:10] this now and I'll get to this in a
[1:29:11] moment but this is what Elijah said when
[1:29:14] he prayed he came near The Altar and he
[1:29:16] says Lord God of Abraham Isaac and
[1:29:20] Israel notice not Jacob not shyer there
[1:29:24] was a Clarity there was a confidence
[1:29:28] there was no
[1:29:32] condemnation he knew where he was
[1:29:34] standing on God's word everything was in
[1:29:38] order and of Israel and let it be known
[1:29:41] this day that thou art God in Israel and
[1:29:45] I am thy servant and that I have done
[1:29:48] all these things at Thy word we want to
[1:29:51] be doers of the word don't we amen I've
[1:29:54] done it all at your word Lord just
[1:29:56] exactly what it was called for you know
[1:29:59] when we look at this in being of a doer
[1:30:01] of the word of God it you know it
[1:30:03] requires let me let me just say it like
[1:30:05] this as we were referring to Jesus in
[1:30:07] the Garden of Eden it isn't that
[1:30:09] everything is simple and it's easy but
[1:30:12] it but what it is it's us being
[1:30:14] submissive to the voice of God Amen I I
[1:30:18] want you to think of this right here
[1:30:19] that within the sacrifice and and the
[1:30:22] laying down constantly the laying down
[1:30:25] of our own will you know the Bible said
[1:30:27] it like this in Revelations 10:8 it said
[1:30:31] go and take that book and he said I went
[1:30:34] and I took the book that was open in the
[1:30:37] hand of the angel that little book and I
[1:30:40] ate it and in my mouth it was what sweet
[1:30:44] as honey but in my belly it was bitter
[1:30:49] once it got once it made its way down oh
[1:30:52] it was sweet and oh how wonderful but
[1:30:54] you see the word in order for the word
[1:30:57] to live it's got to come down on the
[1:30:59] inside and when the word gets down on
[1:31:02] the inside there's a power there to
[1:31:05] break that word down and make it live in
[1:31:09] our life it has within it the nutrients
[1:31:12] and the vitamins and the power to live a
[1:31:15] Victorious Life let me tell you
[1:31:16] something friends I don't care what
[1:31:18] you're dealing with today if you give
[1:31:21] yourself to feed fully on the word of
[1:31:24] God don't mince around like an ODB tray
[1:31:27] but feed on the word of God it'll change
[1:31:29] your appetites it'll change your life
[1:31:32] it'll change Styles it'll break habits
[1:31:35] that's the power of this word if you
[1:31:38] feed on it it'll give you strength to
[1:31:41] fly
[1:31:44] yes always presenting ourselves our
[1:31:47] bodies as a Living Sacrifice not my will
[1:31:51] thine will be done Lord that your will
[1:31:54] is what I
[1:31:56] want because in our text halting when
[1:32:01] Elijah asked the question why halt you
[1:32:04] between two
[1:32:05] opinions and I tell you friends before
[1:32:08] God come on the scene that's all they
[1:32:10] had was opinions that's
[1:32:12] right but when God comes on the scene
[1:32:15] we're no longer looking at opinions
[1:32:18] we're seeing the very thoughts of
[1:32:20] God are you hearing me this message that
[1:32:23] God has sent us is not the opinion of a
[1:32:25] man this message let me just say how the
[1:32:27] prophet said it he said oh to than
[1:32:30] tonight the message of the hour the
[1:32:32] express thoughts of
[1:32:36] Jehovah
[1:32:38] Hallelujah it was straight coming from
[1:32:41] God's mind that's what a prophet is a
[1:32:43] prophet's not just a preacher even
[1:32:45] though in the New Testament a modern day
[1:32:48] Prophet or prophesy one who is a
[1:32:50] preacher but God made a promise that
[1:32:53] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:32:55] Lord he would send Elijah the
[1:33:00] prophet and a prophet is a Seer a
[1:33:03] prophet is a Divine interpreter of the
[1:33:07] word of
[1:33:09] God brotherr when God took a hold of
[1:33:12] this word through Malachi 4 they were
[1:33:15] selling this word like nobody's business
[1:33:18] and we don't need this anymore and God
[1:33:20] really don't mean that and this don't
[1:33:22] mean that but God came
[1:33:26] down
[1:33:28] Hallelujah and in the ministry of
[1:33:30] Malachi 4 Luke 17 and 30 Revelations
[1:33:33] 10:7 God walked and he took the word he
[1:33:38] took the seals off of it and he begin to
[1:33:41] take the bow of the word of the
[1:33:43] predestinated promises and plan of
[1:33:46] almighty God and he saw brought to you
[1:33:49] and I the value of the word has not
[1:33:52] diminished
[1:33:55] but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:33:58] today and
[1:33:59] forever I am God and I change
[1:34:03] not we have been delivered from the
[1:34:06] schools of man's
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:13] opinions
[1:34:15] Hallelujah and we're not going back
[1:34:25] just like where I firmly stand someone
[1:34:27] says this is Brother bram's opinion
[1:34:29] where does that
[1:34:31] end all you're doing is troubling your
[1:34:33] congregation where does that end where
[1:34:36] does that end then what happens that man
[1:34:38] becomes the absolute of the people and
[1:34:40] God never intended that to be the word
[1:34:43] is always to be the
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:34:48] absolute but
[1:34:50] halting sometimes sometimes we
[1:34:54] we can be guilty of
[1:34:57] halting it's okay if you get quiet on me
[1:35:00] it's all right we're we're here to
[1:35:01] minister and help
[1:35:03] right okay I'm right in here with
[1:35:06] you sometimes on halting there's things
[1:35:08] that God can be moving and dealing with
[1:35:11] and and yet sometimes we'll halt on it
[1:35:14] and kind of hold back on it and moving
[1:35:17] on it you know you get out from
[1:35:19] underneath God's presence and I tell you
[1:35:21] the enemy already starts to attack yeah
[1:35:24] he already starts to attack your mind
[1:35:26] starts to attack things and he Satan
[1:35:28] always wants to try to tear down or get
[1:35:31] you away from what God is wanting to do
[1:35:34] in your life now you know when we are
[1:35:36] halting within this let me give you just
[1:35:39] a few examples here brother Ram talks
[1:35:41] about a man who was a member of brother
[1:35:43] Bosworth's church and this brother had a
[1:35:47] radio program and on this radio program
[1:35:50] you know he reaching many people doing a
[1:35:53] wonderful work for the Lord but you know
[1:35:56] he he had come into a place to where
[1:35:58] there was a sickness that be to strike
[1:36:00] his body and when that sickness was
[1:36:03] striking his body he you know he was
[1:36:05] thinking that it was tubercular but
[1:36:07] brother BR said what it actually is it's
[1:36:08] puracy pains in your side and he says
[1:36:12] now he said the doctor couldn't tell you
[1:36:14] that he said but there he said now or
[1:36:16] the doctor could you know he could no
[1:36:17] doubt speak that to you but here's
[1:36:19] something the doctor can't tell you
[1:36:21] you're halting between two opinions you
[1:36:24] think that you're serving God and want
[1:36:27] to do it by keeping this broadcast like
[1:36:30] this but you've got a call and you want
[1:36:33] to go in the ministry I said the thing
[1:36:35] that I would advise you to do was forget
[1:36:38] about the broadcast and get out there on
[1:36:40] the Harvest
[1:36:42] field see what a word come to do it come
[1:36:45] now Discerning that of what God's
[1:36:47] dealing with in his life to break that
[1:36:49] halting between opinions I this is why
[1:36:52] I'm so thankful for the living word of
[1:36:54] God then when you and I can come and sit
[1:36:56] right here and we can be between two
[1:36:58] opinions and you know here we are
[1:37:00] sitting here and then you know what God
[1:37:02] might bring in somebody that you don't
[1:37:04] even know or where the devil can't even
[1:37:07] get in your mind that oh brother Samuel
[1:37:09] said this or he might have told him this
[1:37:10] or he might have told him this I mean
[1:37:12] you know you you many of you you brought
[1:37:14] people here to church some of you I know
[1:37:16] one time you know and there was a family
[1:37:18] that came here one of the many times
[1:37:20] they got to looking at one another and
[1:37:22] then looking at their son who brought
[1:37:23] him here and thought who told him all
[1:37:25] this stuff about our life nobody it was
[1:37:28] God that was Discerning their
[1:37:32] hearts have no idea of those things but
[1:37:34] it's God that's Discerning our hearts
[1:37:37] and let me tell you something God
[1:37:38] doesn't do that to shame us he's letting
[1:37:41] us know that the I am the allseeing eye
[1:37:45] is right here Among
[1:37:47] Us is to recognize him and oh give
[1:37:50] everything give our life surrender all
[1:37:53] to him amen let me just say it like this
[1:37:56] deals are in
[1:37:59] hindrance when
[1:38:01] Rebecca elzer came to get
[1:38:08] Rebecca she watered the camels nobody
[1:38:11] had to tell her this she matched the
[1:38:14] vision of what Abraham had been asked to
[1:38:16] pray for what Abraham told of elzer
[1:38:19] elzer prayed according to what Abraham
[1:38:21] said see elra didn't have to tell her
[1:38:26] hey I think you look good for Isaac do
[1:38:30] this if it's God's choice God will
[1:38:33] always make known his
[1:38:38] choice God was David's choice and David
[1:38:42] didn't have to go around posting about
[1:38:44] it right nobody knew about it it was
[1:38:48] David's
[1:38:50] secret it was a secret coming
[1:38:54] David's character was being molded by
[1:38:56] that secret coming of that
[1:38:59] anointing it was molding him for the
[1:39:01] throne now yes that's right when Rebecca
[1:39:04] here it comes time to this moment
[1:39:07] remember her her
[1:39:09] brother her mother said hey why don't
[1:39:13] you all just stay here for at least till
[1:39:16] the
[1:39:17] tribulation 10 days that's right why
[1:39:20] don't you just stay here I mean it's
[1:39:22] it's all right I mean everything's good
[1:39:23] right here I mean look we've got gifts
[1:39:27] operating he gave them gifts right and
[1:39:30] they were happy with the gifts they were
[1:39:33] happy with gifts Pentecost was happy
[1:39:35] with
[1:39:36] gifts is that right Pentecost didn't
[1:39:39] want the word when the word begin to
[1:39:42] come across they didn't want the
[1:39:44] word but it wasn't the promis that we
[1:39:46] were going to stay in a shf and the
[1:39:48] promise was is that the seed would not
[1:39:51] be air with the shf
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:55] amen and so here it was you know uh you
[1:39:58] know elaser spoke up and said don't
[1:40:00] hinder me
[1:40:02] right sometimes you've got to you have
[1:40:04] to that's a one way of overcoming
[1:40:07] hindrances is when things are put our
[1:40:09] way is I'm not hinder me God has made my
[1:40:12] way prosperous God has confirmed this
[1:40:14] all along God opened up this door right
[1:40:17] where I'm standing right now don't
[1:40:19] hinder me hallelujah amen
[1:40:23] sometimes friends that hindrance has to
[1:40:24] be of us saying no to things that take
[1:40:28] us away from God's
[1:40:31] program are you with me it all it comes
[1:40:34] down don't hinder me don't hinder this
[1:40:37] this is why within everything the word
[1:40:39] must have first place in our life the
[1:40:42] words got to be first place brother Bron
[1:40:44] deals with here a lady let me just read
[1:40:46] this to you there's a lady he says oh
[1:40:48] you've got a trouble and it's
[1:40:50] nervousness you're upset a mental
[1:40:52] distress you're fating between two
[1:40:54] opinions and what you must do in life
[1:40:57] yours is not a sickness you have a child
[1:41:00] don't you it's a boy and you're having
[1:41:02] family trouble at home and you don't
[1:41:04] want to divorce in your family you don't
[1:41:06] want to do it and you're not from the
[1:41:08] city you come from Michigan he says
[1:41:10] there's only one thing that you can do
[1:41:13] that's believe on the Lord I'd advise
[1:41:15] you one thing to do go receive the
[1:41:18] baptism of the spirit live for God all
[1:41:21] your life and everything will work just
[1:41:26] right now watch this he says Lord as he
[1:41:29] prays be merciful to this woman God may
[1:41:33] she receive the Holy Spirit and may all
[1:41:34] of her troubles leave and I bless her
[1:41:36] for this purpose in Jesus Christ's name
[1:41:38] that the baby may be raised in a
[1:41:40] Christian atmosphere both father and
[1:41:42] mother filled with the spirit now her
[1:41:43] husband's not there he said now your
[1:41:45] husband isn't with you but when you go
[1:41:47] home I trust to God that you'll find it
[1:41:49] different are you ready to believe you
[1:41:52] will now just just as you believe I I
[1:41:54] know he does I know he's not knowing un
[1:41:56] believe but I say when you go home
[1:41:57] you're going to believe you're going to
[1:41:59] find things better he's going to receive
[1:42:01] you and things you believe that as you
[1:42:03] have believed that's just the way it'll
[1:42:07] be right now let me say it like this
[1:42:11] these are things that even advice and
[1:42:14] counsel that even that I've you know had
[1:42:17] to had to give and I I'll just say it
[1:42:19] like this you know my aunt my Aunt Linda
[1:42:21] who went on home to be with Lord when
[1:42:23] she first come here and you know God
[1:42:25] dealing with her heart and her life and
[1:42:27] God had really just done a further work
[1:42:29] in her life by the Holy Ghost and you
[1:42:31] know that the very desire within her
[1:42:34] heart is that there would not become a
[1:42:36] divorce within that home and there were
[1:42:38] times where you know here after
[1:42:40] preaching on a family service her and I
[1:42:42] would have a meeting in the office and
[1:42:44] she's not here and this is he's all he's
[1:42:46] already he's not here either but I I'm
[1:42:48] just saying this to you so you can
[1:42:49] relate to this a little bit you know how
[1:42:51] the enemy he would just so upon her mind
[1:42:54] and she said am I failing am I am I just
[1:42:56] throwing in the towel and and frankly to
[1:42:58] tell you the truth I can't even go into
[1:43:00] the things that the way things were done
[1:43:02] for over the years of such abuse and
[1:43:04] mistreat and everything else and I I I
[1:43:06] believe that my uncle at least when I
[1:43:08] went to that funeral that he that that
[1:43:10] they had for him and at the church that
[1:43:12] they said he had given his life to the
[1:43:13] Lord and I just said God thank you I
[1:43:15] trust that you know that he he come to
[1:43:17] accept you as his Lord and Savior I
[1:43:19] don't know whether he did or not but I I
[1:43:21] know this where I'm saying it in this
[1:43:23] way is that it come to a spot that she
[1:43:26] could no longer stay there in those
[1:43:28] conditions the way they were and God did
[1:43:31] not falter there's scripture for
[1:43:33] that but in this situation this is why
[1:43:37] God is Sovereign in all of his ways it's
[1:43:42] not us taking the word and I'm going to
[1:43:44] will the word to be this way that's not
[1:43:47] Faith amen we don't will the word to
[1:43:50] happen a certain way faith is a divine
[1:43:54] revelation of God's
[1:43:57] will is that right and so with this
[1:44:00] notice just just just receive the Holy
[1:44:03] Ghost and everything else will come in
[1:44:06] place I tell you if there if that isn't
[1:44:08] a real true uh uh direction for our
[1:44:11] lives just put God first in everything
[1:44:14] and everything else will come right into
[1:44:18] place friends listen this is where the
[1:44:21] church has got off and I'm not throwing
[1:44:23] off on churches I I'm not throwing you
[1:44:25] understand what I'm saying when they got
[1:44:27] away from the program that God sent down
[1:44:30] and that was repent and be baptized in
[1:44:33] the name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:44:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost this
[1:44:37] is why the churches have got to have so
[1:44:40] many self-help programs because they've
[1:44:42] rejected the Holy
[1:44:45] Ghost but it'll never be man helping man
[1:44:48] not by might not by power but by my
[1:44:51] spirit says the Lord we don't need more
[1:44:54] education we need more of the Holy
[1:44:58] Ghost it's the holy ghost that come
[1:45:01] Among Us it's the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:45:04] answer and he is the
[1:45:08] word yes amen oh glory be to God
[1:45:12] hallelujah man I just got to move on
[1:45:14] that's why we want to act upon the word
[1:45:16] I'm trying to get to a point here bless
[1:45:19] Lord when Phillip was taken away from
[1:45:22] that meeting in Samaria and was told to
[1:45:24] join himself to that Chariot where that
[1:45:27] where that unic was at of Candice the
[1:45:30] queen he was reading in Isaiah 53 but he
[1:45:33] didn't understand what he was
[1:45:34] reading Philip asked him said do you
[1:45:37] understand what you're reading he said
[1:45:38] how can I except some man should guide
[1:45:39] me and Philip began on that particular
[1:45:42] scripture begin to preach unto him
[1:45:45] Jesus and as they're coming
[1:45:49] along the unit looks and sees water it w
[1:45:53] Philip that was persuading him to be
[1:45:55] baptized the unit saw water and said hey
[1:45:57] hey hey hey here's water what does
[1:46:02] hinder what's
[1:46:04] hindering so acting upon the word is an
[1:46:08] overcoming of
[1:46:10] hindrances Amen just act upon God's word
[1:46:14] let me tell you how you begin to act on
[1:46:15] God's word you know how many knows how
[1:46:17] the prophet tolds Us in the message the
[1:46:19] token full obedience to the word of God
[1:46:21] entitles you to the token
[1:46:23] right there's no way you can fully obey
[1:46:26] this before the Holy Ghost has come he
[1:46:28] goes on to tell you what that means full
[1:46:31] obedience is acts 238 repent and be
[1:46:35] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:46:37] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:46:40] Ghost Hallelujah that's full obedience
[1:46:42] to the word of God and all these other
[1:46:44] things will be added unto
[1:46:47] you act upon God's word don't wrestle
[1:46:50] with it act upon God's word when God is
[1:46:52] dealing with with your heart when he's
[1:46:53] speaking to our lives friends listen
[1:46:56] don't don't draw back on it but act upon
[1:46:58] the word Lord what what what's hindering
[1:47:00] me the things he's dealing with me you
[1:47:02] don't even have to wait till the end of
[1:47:04] the
[1:47:05] service amen I believe in alter calls I
[1:47:08] believe in coming to the altar but
[1:47:10] friends I'm what I'm trying to say is as
[1:47:12] the word is coming forth you don't have
[1:47:15] to wait right there if there's something
[1:47:17] that strikes Your Heart Right There make
[1:47:19] it right am Surrender Your on right
[1:47:23] there Lord I lay it down right here Lord
[1:47:26] God act upon the word what's hindering
[1:47:31] me what an atmosphere you're standing in
[1:47:35] an atmosphere to be able to move upon
[1:47:38] God's
[1:47:39] word let me just deal with this
[1:47:43] point before I come to a close here I'm
[1:47:46] coming but remember and I want to just
[1:47:50] draw your attention to this the
[1:47:54] purpose of God becoming one of
[1:47:57] us was for
[1:48:00] Redemption and Redemption means to bring
[1:48:05] back what was
[1:48:07] lost the Reason God through
[1:48:11] Redemption is God was making known the
[1:48:15] purpose was that he might be manifested
[1:48:19] through our
[1:48:21] lives this is what why he had to be the
[1:48:26] perfect lamb this is why he went to
[1:48:29] Calvary this is why his blood that was
[1:48:32] shed could not be that which was mixed
[1:48:36] with blood that was already
[1:48:39] here he was not of
[1:48:42] Mary was not of Joseph God created that
[1:48:46] blood cell amen cuz every other blood
[1:48:50] was contaminated that's right God come
[1:48:53] down to to pay the ultimate price but
[1:48:56] through that price being being paid he
[1:49:00] displayed to you and I what God intended
[1:49:03] us to be this is why just even the law
[1:49:07] could never display
[1:49:09] it the law all of it even though he took
[1:49:12] on his own laws but the law itself could
[1:49:15] not display him right but when he came
[1:49:19] he who was the word he displayed all
[1:49:22] that he was and all that you and I as a
[1:49:26] son and daughter of God are to be God
[1:49:29] listen in the end time God brought a
[1:49:32] message in the end time which is the
[1:49:35] fullness of the word right here Among Us
[1:49:38] the Living God to do what display
[1:49:41] himself of what he has called Sons and
[1:49:44] Daughters of God to
[1:49:45] be God didn't leave it to some figment
[1:49:48] that's why the prophet said in Rising of
[1:49:50] the sun he said it was going to take
[1:49:52] more than just pictures of an eagle
[1:49:54] right it took a living Eagle to fly amen
[1:49:57] it took the eagle took Jehovah eagle
[1:49:59] flying over and when he flew over he
[1:50:01] showed that he was Jehovah of the old is
[1:50:04] Jesus of the new he showed I'm the same
[1:50:06] yesterday today and forever and you know
[1:50:09] what he did with his wings he has bore
[1:50:11] us unto
[1:50:13] himself we have been lifted out of sin
[1:50:16] lifted out of Doubt lifted out of
[1:50:18] condemnation
[1:50:22] thank
[1:50:23] you this is where it brings us
[1:50:26] to to act upon God's word and that can
[1:50:30] never be lost Satan's desire was to
[1:50:33] break that reality right and always just
[1:50:36] put it back to where we're looking just
[1:50:38] back to the Cross but without the
[1:50:42] substance of what the cross made a way
[1:50:44] for us to
[1:50:45] have the calvary made a way for us so
[1:50:49] that we might be born again
[1:50:53] in Calvary made a way so that that same
[1:50:57] God might come in and dwell within our
[1:51:01] life that it might be God displaying
[1:51:04] himself through our lives are you with
[1:51:08] me amen now with that hindrance there
[1:51:11] just stay with me just a minute here
[1:51:13] God's desire is to deal with
[1:51:17] hindrances sometimes we've come in this
[1:51:19] life and Satan has wanted to try to jam
[1:51:22] up every channel and every way to stop
[1:51:26] the expression of a seed but let me just
[1:51:27] tell you this it didn't matter all this
[1:51:30] concrete they've poured out there if
[1:51:33] there's a seed that's underneath there
[1:51:36] it's going to come
[1:51:38] right is that right I don't care what
[1:51:40] you put over it if there's a seed there
[1:51:42] it's going to come how many how many of
[1:51:45] you remember Georgie Carter brother Ram
[1:51:46] talks about that well Georgie Carter
[1:51:50] here she was in bed and she was she was
[1:51:53] dealing with uh I believe it was
[1:51:57] tuberculosis but you know how she got
[1:51:59] that onset here her uncle was taking her
[1:52:02] to piano lessons and her uncle molested
[1:52:05] her and when that happened brother Bram
[1:52:08] tells that and when that happened one
[1:52:10] place in the message he goes into it and
[1:52:12] when he when what happened within that
[1:52:14] now here she is there's a hindrance
[1:52:17] there that Satan has wanted to put in
[1:52:20] her
[1:52:21] life now come on friends we're living
[1:52:24] with things that are real yes true and
[1:52:27] notice here she was but there was a seed
[1:52:30] down there on the inside she had heard
[1:52:34] what had happened to the nail girl
[1:52:36] brother Howard Nail's daughter over
[1:52:38] there how she had been healed and got up
[1:52:40] out of the bed and she got a hold of
[1:52:42] that little track and she be to believe
[1:52:45] and she heard there was going to be a
[1:52:47] baptism there and remember it was the
[1:52:49] spirit of God that brought that
[1:52:51] attention to the prophet where he heard
[1:52:54] that little call of that lamb calling
[1:52:57] come to
[1:52:58] M Town that little lamb was caught in
[1:53:02] the
[1:53:04] Briars she was caught in that which had
[1:53:07] happened to her as just doing just some
[1:53:09] months a few years back she was caught
[1:53:12] in doctrine that said God don't heal the
[1:53:15] sick no more she was caught in all kinds
[1:53:17] of Bramble
[1:53:21] Hallelujah but God rich in
[1:53:25] Mercy he found
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:31] her even when her mother was against
[1:53:33] brother brandham she was hearing brother
[1:53:36] brandham was in town and her mother was
[1:53:39] all upset here she is getting in my
[1:53:41] daughter all upset and looking at this
[1:53:43] going on and all of a sudden she's
[1:53:45] directed to look at that shadow on the
[1:53:47] wall and what she sees as a shadow is
[1:53:50] the shadow of the Lord Jesus and it says
[1:53:52] who's coming there and about that time
[1:53:55] she sees brother brandom's profile
[1:53:58] Hallelujah and here as a she goes to
[1:54:01] tell to her daughter here brother
[1:54:02] brandom comes walking in at the same
[1:54:04] time God works everything out just on
[1:54:08] time Hey listen friends don't let that
[1:54:10] stumble you he has no hands but your
[1:54:12] hands he has no feet but your feet he is
[1:54:16] divine we are the
[1:54:17] branches is that right and he comes in
[1:54:20] there and brother Bram says oh I know he
[1:54:23] says as it struck me at that moment and
[1:54:25] I said Georgie carner the Lord Jesus has
[1:54:28] healed
[1:54:30] you brother Ram said why I said it even
[1:54:33] not even thinking about it but as it
[1:54:36] came out and that was spoken he said all
[1:54:39] of a sudden here she came up out of that
[1:54:41] bed
[1:54:43] Hallelujah her mother fainted now listen
[1:54:46] to this
[1:54:47] Hallelujah the first thing she did was
[1:54:51] go outside and begin to kiss the
[1:54:54] ground and after kissing the ground she
[1:54:57] went over and got on the
[1:54:59] piano normally anybody that's had a
[1:55:02] tragic experience like that wouldn't
[1:55:04] want to go near a
[1:55:06] piano come on because of what happened
[1:55:08] to her has a little girl but I wish
[1:55:11] listen to me now I'm not telling you
[1:55:12] this dig up old stories I'm telling you
[1:55:15] this because the power of God is so
[1:55:17] great it's able to break the Tormentor
[1:55:20] hold upon your life yeah it's able to
[1:55:24] break and Destroy hindrances where the
[1:55:27] enemy has wanted to put hindrances in
[1:55:30] your life you're not some trotting down
[1:55:33] something you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:55:37] God hallelujah she went and sat down and
[1:55:40] began to
[1:55:48] play the sour phenician woman she had a
[1:55:52] lot of hindrances when she
[1:55:55] came right lot of hindrances Jesus said
[1:55:59] it's not me for me to take the bread and
[1:56:01] cast it under dogs right even the
[1:56:04] disciples tried to stop
[1:56:07] her when she finally came through see I
[1:56:11] wonder what if what if what if it had
[1:56:13] been you and I he called me a
[1:56:16] dog but you see what faith will always
[1:56:20] admit the word is right right
[1:56:22] amen you don't want to wear your faith
[1:56:24] on your shoulders you want Faith you
[1:56:27] want God's faith in your heart you don't
[1:56:29] want to walk around with a chip on your
[1:56:31] shoulder you want you want Faith to be
[1:56:33] in the right
[1:56:34] place come on friends because when what
[1:56:37] he said what he said was true she said
[1:56:39] Lord what you're saying is true but the
[1:56:42] dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the
[1:56:44] master's table she got beneath the
[1:56:48] word she had a lot of hindrances right
[1:56:52] but Faith didn't have any
[1:56:56] right now let me come to my point here
[1:56:58] and I'm going to
[1:57:03] close there's a difference between
[1:57:06] hindrances where Satan is trying to
[1:57:09] hinder because Paul wrote of this in
[1:57:11] other places how Satan wanted to
[1:57:14] hinder them from coming and you know
[1:57:17] what Satan can't hinder anything from
[1:57:19] taking place unless God permits it right
[1:57:22] amen cuz sometimes go what God's
[1:57:24] revealed it's for a set and purposed
[1:57:27] time is that right now to think there's
[1:57:31] a difference between where Satan is
[1:57:33] trying to hinder and things that are
[1:57:35] spiritually preventing further
[1:57:39] movement this is where I'm now I'm
[1:57:41] starting to just zero in here and I'm
[1:57:42] only going to deal with this one point
[1:57:44] here just just a moment but this is
[1:57:47] where that when we look in our lives the
[1:57:50] scripture would talk to us
[1:57:53] about a perfect walk and I want you to
[1:57:54] think of this this this this phrase on a
[1:57:57] perfect walk with God the Bible tells us
[1:58:01] in Mark 11 verse 23 whatsoever you shall
[1:58:06] say unto this mountain this hindrance be
[1:58:09] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[1:58:11] sea and shall not
[1:58:13] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:58:17] that those things which he saith shall
[1:58:19] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:58:23] say this is God's promise for our life
[1:58:28] but the key is is no doubt within our
[1:58:32] heart that's the key no doubt within our
[1:58:36] heart now I want you to think about this
[1:58:38] when Israel came into the land the
[1:58:40] prophet says it like this he says and
[1:58:43] now after you're in talking about being
[1:58:45] in the promised land into that of the
[1:58:47] Holy Ghost into that of God's word in
[1:58:50] that don't mean that you're out free
[1:58:52] from war you still have to fight for
[1:58:54] every inch of ground to stand on Canaan
[1:58:57] did not represent the great Heaven
[1:58:59] because it's war and troubles and
[1:59:01] killings and fightings and so forth but
[1:59:04] it did represent this that it must be a
[1:59:08] perfect walk
[1:59:11] right brother Bram says this this is
[1:59:14] where the church is failing today on
[1:59:17] that walk did you know that even your
[1:59:19] own behavior cannot somebody else out of
[1:59:23] getting healed your misbehavior of
[1:59:26] unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can
[1:59:30] cause this church to bitterly fail and
[1:59:34] at the day of judgment you'll be
[1:59:36] responsible for every bit of it oh you
[1:59:38] say now wait a minute brother R well
[1:59:39] that's a
[1:59:40] truth so where Satan would want to
[1:59:44] hinder is here when it comes on
[1:59:48] unconfessed sin right and when you think
[1:59:51] of it but I want you to think with me
[1:59:53] just a moment I'm I'm coming
[1:59:57] down but how could that dwell there how
[2:00:00] could unconfessed sin dwell you know
[2:00:03] brother BR he brings he takes a whole
[2:00:05] message on and showing us why the word
[2:00:09] it is here it ought to be working in a
[2:00:11] certain way right but one of the reasons
[2:00:14] he said and the main reason is not is
[2:00:15] because a lack of an honest
[2:00:18] confession a true repentance he said now
[2:00:20] what if I did something to my wife wife
[2:00:22] and he said I walked up to my wife and
[2:00:24] said hey
[2:00:25] girl brother says it like this hey girl
[2:00:27] you know hey how you doing you know I
[2:00:29] didn't mean to you know I I didn't mean
[2:00:31] brother Bram said she wouldn't know
[2:00:32] whether I was joking or I was
[2:00:35] serious he said we've got to be sincere
[2:00:37] in our
[2:00:38] confession repentance is a matter of the
[2:00:43] heart it's a condition of the
[2:00:48] heart it's not just it's not just sorry
[2:00:51] I I I believe I listen I believe in
[2:00:54] saying sorry but repentance has got to
[2:00:56] be a condition of the heart and when it
[2:00:59] comes from the heart it'll show itself
[2:01:01] in
[2:01:04] humility it because it's humble because
[2:01:06] the humility has been humble to the word
[2:01:08] of God on the
[2:01:10] inside we don't want to hold you don't
[2:01:12] want to hinder God from working in your
[2:01:16] life remember remember when brother BR
[2:01:18] came around the Pentecostals and brother
[2:01:20] BR says here they are he said and
[2:01:21] they're wearing shorts and doing this
[2:01:23] and doing that and he says and then they
[2:01:25] speak in tongues he said you try to tell
[2:01:26] them they don't got the Holy
[2:01:28] Ghost why they were basing their
[2:01:30] experience on gifts instead of the
[2:01:34] word gifts are a part of the word but
[2:01:37] gifts are never to be the basis of our
[2:01:40] acceptance before God a man listen man
[2:01:43] standing right here I we just get it
[2:01:45] right at home they right setting right
[2:01:47] in here men that many have known even
[2:01:50] preach camp meetings could preach like a
[2:01:52] house on fire right and then end up
[2:01:56] being all sorts of things whether it was
[2:01:58] that and brother BR seeing the man
[2:02:00] remember that one here was speaking in
[2:02:02] tongues and the other interpreting one
[2:02:04] was genuine and one was false
[2:02:07] right you see this is why friends this
[2:02:10] is why we are brought to a word
[2:02:12] experience and a word experience don't
[2:02:15] reject the gifts but a word experience
[2:02:17] never puts experiences above the word
[2:02:21] amen
[2:02:22] amen is that right the prophet tells us
[2:02:25] he said the reason for all the confusion
[2:02:27] is because we have placed experiences
[2:02:31] above the word it doesn't mean that you
[2:02:34] you and I are not to have a supernatural
[2:02:36] experience it doesn't mean that there
[2:02:38] aren't experiences but never should that
[2:02:41] ever be the measuring line it's the word
[2:02:45] the plum
[2:02:46] line is that right that's the difference
[2:02:49] with the bride of Jesus Christ she's a
[2:02:50] word bride through and through and with
[2:02:54] that how could how could something come
[2:02:57] in that way you know because when things
[2:02:59] have to be confessed if you did
[2:03:02] something on your husband or your wife
[2:03:04] you can say well I made that right to
[2:03:06] God but like brother Bram took it he
[2:03:08] says you didn't sin against God you
[2:03:09] sinned against your marriage
[2:03:11] vow remember the woman who was a Sunday
[2:03:14] school teacher her husband was a deacon
[2:03:22] she came to brother brandham and she
[2:03:24] couldn't figure out why is my anxiety
[2:03:27] and all this like this my all this stuff
[2:03:29] all tore up why am I why am I mess
[2:03:32] brother BR said when the angel of the
[2:03:34] Lord comes I'm going to send for
[2:03:37] you he showed up and he sent mey go get
[2:03:41] her brought her in brought her to the
[2:03:43] house and they sat down in the den room
[2:03:45] in the office and the angel of the Lord
[2:03:47] revealed I see you was out with a
[2:03:50] gentleman and it was was in this color
[2:03:52] of a car and you were out as she
[2:03:53] screamed you know why brother BR said
[2:03:55] that's because that was hidden way down
[2:03:58] there in that subconscious what caused
[2:04:01] that to be hidden there minimizing it oh
[2:04:05] my minimizing
[2:04:08] it when Satan came to Eve what did he do
[2:04:13] he minimized
[2:04:15] it yay that God said You shall not
[2:04:19] surely die let me tell you friends you
[2:04:21] can't control sin sin will take you
[2:04:24] further away from
[2:04:26] God it'll take Christ right out of your
[2:04:29] life it'll affect your home it affects
[2:04:32] your walk with God come on
[2:04:35] now I want you I want us to thank about
[2:04:38] these things because the word is meant
[2:04:41] to work in every one of our
[2:04:44] lives and this is one of the hindrances
[2:04:47] that can be ever so present is
[2:04:49] unconfessed sin yes amen the Bible said
[2:04:54] if I regard iniquity in my heart God
[2:04:55] won't even hear my
[2:04:57] prayer aen this is what brother B's
[2:04:59] referring to aen buried the gold in his
[2:05:03] tent he buried the Babylonian garment
[2:05:07] yes he kept it hidden he kept it around
[2:05:10] this is why listen with everything Lord
[2:05:12] I don't want and we don't want to live a
[2:05:14] different life outside of here than what
[2:05:17] than what the word is calling for let me
[2:05:19] tell you there is a power to give you
[2:05:22] Liberty and
[2:05:24] victory amen is anybody with me on
[2:05:27] this there's a power to overcome on of
[2:05:31] these hindrances sir but oh how
[2:05:33] unconfessed sin how Satan wants to just
[2:05:36] get that in there and minimize it
[2:05:38] minimize it minimize it oh it ain't that
[2:05:41] bad it ain't that bad oh just a little
[2:05:43] bit here just a little bit there little
[2:05:45] bit here and finally all the little bits
[2:05:47] add up and everything begins to just
[2:05:51] pile and move around how many remember
[2:05:54] when brother brandham came under that
[2:05:56] pressure of the tax
[2:05:58] case remember that yes brother Bram said
[2:06:01] he had got all
[2:06:02] weary he was he was tired he was
[2:06:05] worn and they called the house and he
[2:06:07] ran out the door there and said tell him
[2:06:09] I'm not
[2:06:11] here is that right brother Bram then his
[2:06:15] wife when he come back in she said bill
[2:06:17] was that right he said sure it was I
[2:06:20] wasn't in here he said yet I knew knew I
[2:06:21] was
[2:06:24] wrong brother BR goes on to tell us he
[2:06:27] says see you've got to get everything
[2:06:29] out and live above everything because if
[2:06:34] not the Holy Spirit cannot work in our
[2:06:38] lives it becomes like like I was talking
[2:06:41] when I was showing you them pictures of
[2:06:42] something that's holding us back from
[2:06:44] going on where we need to go it's but
[2:06:47] it's to live clear it's to live free
[2:06:50] it's to live clear here if they're
[2:06:52] saying listen don't don't let things go
[2:06:54] by even in your home let everything be
[2:06:57] settled out in your home let everything
[2:07:00] let everything in your life if there's
[2:07:02] whatever the Holy Spirit would be
[2:07:04] dealing with your life don't let
[2:07:05] anything go hidden there's no such thing
[2:07:07] as a white lie they're all
[2:07:10] lies come on there's no such thing as a
[2:07:12] as a as a as well this this business
[2:07:15] deals okay everything has got to be up
[2:07:17] and up for that of a Believer why
[2:07:19] because we want to be a channel that
[2:07:23] faith can fall
[2:07:25] into this is an hour where for Faith to
[2:07:28] move within our lives and this is where
[2:07:31] we overcome hindrances is bring and
[2:07:35] expose the
[2:07:37] enemy when there's things that have come
[2:07:39] in and if there's things that's come in
[2:07:41] or that's been accumulated within your
[2:07:44] life listen friend this is where we need
[2:07:47] an honest examination right
[2:07:52] this is why the prophet says don't
[2:07:54] examine and judge your
[2:07:56] life by all the gifts he said but judge
[2:07:59] it by the fruits of the
[2:08:04] spirit that's what we judge it
[2:08:06] by Lord I want my life to hit in all
[2:08:11] cylinders but Sam if there's things that
[2:08:13] you've had to make right
[2:08:15] Absolutely I'll tell you right now let
[2:08:17] me just share this with you standing
[2:08:20] right here I wouldn't want to I wouldn't
[2:08:22] even stand right here if I knew there
[2:08:23] was something between my wife and myself
[2:08:26] I wouldn't do
[2:08:28] it I don't want anything between me and
[2:08:31] my boys between me and my
[2:08:34] wife this needs to be a Harmony if I'm
[2:08:37] going to speak to God's people I don't
[2:08:39] just do it because I'm speaking to God's
[2:08:40] people whether I was a pastor or not I
[2:08:43] don't like I don't like those
[2:08:45] things you know why I'm a Believer
[2:08:48] aren't you a Believer don't you as a
[2:08:50] Christian you like peace don't you I
[2:08:53] love peace I like peace within the home
[2:08:56] that that's that that's what my desire
[2:08:58] is is is
[2:08:59] peace but there's got to be that even
[2:09:02] among us as Believers Lord I don't want
[2:09:05] anything to
[2:09:06] hinder I don't want anything to hinder
[2:09:09] remember when Israel I close
[2:09:11] here remember when Israel went into the
[2:09:15] battle they lost that
[2:09:18] battle at AI right and they lost it
[2:09:22] because of unconfessed
[2:09:24] sin God never forsook his promise but
[2:09:28] Israel got away from
[2:09:30] God and that's one of the things within
[2:09:32] our lives

[2:11:30] to forgive
[2:11:34] us I wish I had a whole service on this
[2:11:38] part and I say that

[2:11:44] work with and deal with in our
[2:11:47] lives it comes to break holds it comes
[2:11:50] to break things sometimes that are just
[2:11:52] there are some of those hindrances and
[2:11:54] sometimes those things can get right in
[2:11:56] there and it's things we can start
[2:11:59] minimizing and if you minimize it
[2:12:01] friends it'll just
[2:12:02] grow and it'll hinder right things will
[2:12:06] start working and start moving and say

[2:12:47] was on the on the write up and the
[2:12:50] report it didn't only talk about kidney
[2:12:54] stones but it talked about if they found
[2:12:56] anything with a bone here or there and

[2:14:18] morning to read
[2:14:21] we don't want to Lord
[2:14:23] halt we see Lord even how you would take
[2:14:26] examples where the Prophet would speak
[2:14:29] to different ones that even as believers
[2:14:32] they were halting between certain things
[2:14:35] to
[2:14:36] do one wanted Lord to just stay in that
[2:14:39] broadcast but you was calling him to
[2:14:42] Ministry another sister Lord that she
[2:14:45] needed
[2:14:47] help Lord God how Satan was attacking
[2:14:50] her nerves through that domestic
[2:14:52] trouble but you Lord you minister to her
[2:14:56] and let her
[2:14:58] know first things
[2:15:01] first for her life to be filled with the
[2:15:03] spirit of
[2:15:05] God and then you would give direction in
[2:15:08] her
[2:15:08] life Lord you would work things out
[2:15:11] according to your own
[2:15:14] counsel Lord
[2:15:17] Jesus we've been there Lord in those
[2:15:19] times
[2:15:21] sometimes Lord speaking right here we
[2:15:23] can be right in the middle of
[2:15:26] decisions like Lord we're looking at two
[2:15:28] paths which path do I
[2:15:31] take what I pray here this
[2:15:33] [Music]

[2:15:53] initial part of that
[2:15:56] choice but what the reward is or the
[2:16:01] wages at the end of that
[2:16:04] choice I pray father right here this
[2:16:09] morning Lord as we looked at Georgie

[2:16:55] renew their eyes this morning renew the
[2:16:59] vision like you did for Moses

[2:18:19] we're among our families when we're
[2:18:21] everywhere our purpose Lord the purpose
[2:18:24] of redemption is to manifest you

[2:18:46] conduct our stand where we stand with
[2:18:50] conviction without
[2:18:53] compromise upon the word of God it

[2:18:59] can be
[2:19:01] followed Lord we don't know we we don't

[2:19:31] needs to be made right Lord with
[2:19:35] someone if there's something Lord God
[2:19:38] that's out of line Lord
[2:19:42] Jesus as your Prophet would tell us over
[2:19:44] and
[2:19:46] over when we know that we're wrong we
[2:19:49] automatically put ourselves out as
[2:19:53] Sinners but we want to live where
[2:19:55] there's no
[2:19:57] condemnation if our heart condemn us the
[2:19:59] Bible said you're greater than our heart
[2:20:02] but if our heart does not condemn us
[2:20:05] then we can have

[2:20:34] been
[2:20:36] minimized May Lord I pray it be shown
[2:20:40] for what it is Lord because it's your
[2:20:44] desire to reflect
[2:20:46] yourself through our lives

[2:20:53] reflect because it's just Lord to be a
[2:20:56] preacher that's that's not it Lord

[2:21:12] me it's what you would use Lord as an
[2:21:16] instrument but the whole thing with the
[2:21:18] gift is been able to get ourselves out
[2:21:19] of the way
[2:21:21] but Lord that gift is not my walk with
