[39:01] far let let your light so shine before
[39:06] men and I just just striking looking at
[39:09] this last verse let your light so shine
[39:11] before men and you realize that as we
[39:16] are looking at this this is just a
[39:19] statement and when I come across and we
[39:21] look at statements within the Word of
[39:23] God these are not just just statements
[39:27] that we look at and we say my letters
[39:30] wonderful but water responsibility that
[39:34] it places upon our lives you are the
[39:37] light of the world and yet when we look
[39:39] at this God has a representative in this
[39:43] hour there there is God has no other
[39:45] hands but our hands he has no other feet
[39:49] but our feet but the responsibility look
[39:51] at it when in the light of the scripture
[39:54] that no man when he has lit a candle he
[39:57] doesn't hide it but that candle comes
[40:00] into position so the lighting of that
[40:02] candle then it's a bringing in position
[40:05] so that all that are in the house might
[40:07] see but it isn't so much just that the
[40:10] focus becomes upon the candle but that
[40:13] the candle itself would actually be able
[40:16] to enlighten and illuminate the way that
[40:19] is set before so when we look at this in
[40:22] thinking of it in this terms we are we
[40:25] we in this hour we are God's
[40:27] representatives we are a representative
[40:31] of his victory it's not something when
[40:33] we when we speak of Calvary we speak of
[40:36] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[40:38] Christ we're not speaking of something
[40:41] that is just of a historical reference
[40:43] or of something that is just that we
[40:46] ourselves can just agree with but we are
[40:48] speaking as witnesses of that
[40:51] resurrection because that we have
[40:55] experienced that resurrection in our
[40:58] life that that life is dwelling on the
[41:01] inside of us we are a manifestation of
[41:04] his victory it becomes then in this hour
[41:08] - you and I when we we look at this
[41:10] charge that the Lord Jesus is giving to
[41:13] the disciples in this hour we do we are
[41:15] representatives of the message of this
[41:18] hour I tell you that's a hot charge
[41:20] because that means in everything that we
[41:23] say and that we do where we go how we
[41:26] live we we want to make sure that we are
[41:29] true representatives you know let me
[41:32] just say it like this and not dwell on
[41:34] this point we just don't want to deliver
[41:36] a word of truth but we want our lives to
[41:40] be a reflection of that truth because
[41:42] the brother man tells us in the message
[41:44] power transformation he said many times
[41:46] he said you can look at the word and he
[41:49] said maybe it was a hypocrite that
[41:50] preached that word he said but remember
[41:52] don't look at that man he said you look
[41:55] at the word because it was not and it's
[41:58] not the man that transforms you but it
[42:01] is the word that holds the power to
[42:04] transform so when we look at this that
[42:07] it's we only want when we in our lives
[42:09] come to a place of even being able to
[42:12] speak to someone else
[42:14] we want to be able in our hearts that it
[42:16] is an extension and it is who are we are
[42:19] speaking of is our own story in our own
[42:22] testimony so when we look at it what a
[42:25] responsibility that we have in this hour
[42:28] to declare him and when we look at this
[42:31] here in the in in the scriptures here
[42:35] pardon me here is just some of this is
[42:37] building but there is a true light I
[42:39] don't want to go into this party or just
[42:41] very briefly because when we look at the
[42:44] light itself that that we are to reflect
[42:46] there is a true light that enlightens
[42:49] the believer and when you look at how
[42:52] the Scriptures are set here there was a
[42:54] man sent from God whose name was John
[42:57] it said the same came for a witness to
[43:01] bear witness of V light that all men
[43:04] through him might believe this is a very
[43:06] it's a very important point because
[43:09] John's do remember John's coming I want
[43:12] you to think of this here is John
[43:14] standing there and there were many who
[43:16] even missed this time as far as John's
[43:19] physically being upon the earth but
[43:21] remember the light that had come through
[43:23] and John's that light that was reflected
[43:26] through was the light that was pointing
[43:29] the people to the true light that was
[43:31] going to be following there was a
[43:33] message that John was given and the
[43:35] message that John was given was to
[43:38] declare that Christ is now here it was
[43:41] to declare him as the Lamb of God which
[43:44] takes away the sin of the world and to
[43:46] think of this here that God how that the
[43:49] Lord would move by his word and you
[43:51] think of how that the word itself
[43:53] becoming light that what God when he
[43:56] spoke in the beginning of what you think
[43:57] of this God had already spoken
[44:00] concerning John's ministry God had
[44:03] already spoken all the way clear in the
[44:05] Old Testament
[44:06] now remember many brother Brendan
[44:08] brother Rama picked this up he says and
[44:10] I believe it's in God's power to
[44:11] transform and then he referred to
[44:12] empowered transformation he said many
[44:15] people read the book of Genesis and they
[44:17] say that God is repeating himself he
[44:20] said that God doesn't repeat himself you
[44:23] see the difference is when God he speaks
[44:26] his word first it's a word that's spoken
[44:29] just like it was in Genesis 1 the word
[44:31] first of all had to be spoken but after
[44:34] the word is spoken showing that it's a
[44:36] Word of God that word will come to light
[44:39] and that same God he spoke through the
[44:41] prophets and that word just lingered but
[44:44] it when it became time for that word to
[44:46] be fulfilled God would have
[44:48] man upon the scene that would be able to
[44:51] declare this prophecy that was spoken
[44:54] there is to be fulfilled there's no way
[44:57] that a man's mind could catch that it
[44:59] would have to be the supernatural God
[45:01] who spoke it back there would be
[45:04] stand-in right there illuminating that
[45:06] man in that time that that man would be
[45:08] able to look in the scripture and see
[45:11] his place in the scripture and be able
[45:13] to say this is the prophecy this is the
[45:16] time this is where we're living you know
[45:18] that's the same way in your life it
[45:20] isn't how much that you and I have
[45:22] studied it isn't that at all it's being
[45:24] ordained to this place and then the word
[45:27] itself it searches you and I'll and then
[45:30] through our lives it's not just a
[45:32] rallying but we begin to see the
[45:35] prophecy that God has for this day and
[45:38] we recognize that this is our prophecy
[45:41] we are a part of this and as we
[45:43] recognize that then our lives become
[45:46] placed in the candle step as a witness
[45:51] as a light to others so God's not
[45:55] repeating himself but God is simply
[45:58] declaring this now is the time so the
[46:02] Bible goes on to say he way that that he
[46:06] was not that light but was sent to bear
[46:10] witness of that light now remember they
[46:13] tried to place John but John was not
[46:15] that light John was sent to bear witness
[46:18] of him you with me any any true life and
[46:24] vessel will never seek to take the place
[46:27] of Jesus Christ is that right here John
[46:30] stands in the Book of Revelations the
[46:32] Bible tells us in the opening scripture
[46:35] of Revelation I believe it's revelation
[46:36] one one one one two how that God had
[46:39] sent his angel to signify these things
[46:42] under John you can see that this
[46:44] ministry John was ordained to receive
[46:47] this enlightenment in this understanding
[46:50] and God had an angel wasn't just said
[46:52] just vaguely out here but there's an
[46:54] intended audience and a target for this
[46:57] angel this
[46:58] messenger to come to and it's John down
[47:01] through the Book of Revelations all
[47:02] these things begin to open and John is
[47:05] seeing it and many things that John
[47:07] wondered at now the covers been taken
[47:09] off of it and as the covers been taken
[47:12] off of it
[47:12] John seen this illumination is so
[47:15] illuminated that John falls down
[47:17] multiple times to worship this angel but
[47:21] this angel being a true angel a true
[47:24] messenger he could say I am NOT that
[47:26] light I am sent to bear witness of it I
[47:30] am of the fellow servants the prophets I
[47:33] am a veil so he knew his position and
[47:38] would not receive worship that's where
[47:43] any believer will never receive worship
[47:46] because we recognize it is the life that
[47:50] is behind us can I preach tonight
[47:55] brother madam said it like this let me
[47:57] just show you how simple in the message
[47:59] have not our cynthy brother branham is
[48:01] praying and he said God he said that we
[48:04] just want to thank you he said because
[48:06] if there's anything that's been good and
[48:09] that's come out of our life it's because
[48:11] your Holy Ghost has overload our
[48:13] stubborn rebellion and pushed its way
[48:16] through hallelujah because God's not
[48:20] going to be defeated the Holy Spirit
[48:25] moves right through our lives even when
[48:27] we and ourselves are trying to grasp and
[48:29] believe and latch on to but the Holy
[48:32] Spirit remember it's God that
[48:34] sovereignly imparts to you and I what it
[48:37] is that you and I must come to and he
[48:40] conditions and works on our life to
[48:42] where that you and I are not removing us
[48:44] from free moral agency but to where that
[48:46] we become receptive to what he has
[48:49] ordained and desires to fulfill so it's
[48:52] him creating the atmosphere just like
[48:55] Genesis one over and over in our lives
[48:58] now think of this here he was not that
[49:01] light but was sent to bear witness of
[49:04] that light with bear witness what was
[49:06] John's ministry pointing him to him
[49:08] that's John's ministry so then we see
[49:11] that
[49:11] that was the true light which lighteth
[49:15] every man that cometh into the world so
[49:20] that light that lighteth every man that
[49:22] cometh into the world this is Christ
[49:24] this is the word this is the Holy Ghost
[49:28] that's the true light God is light so
[49:32] Johnson ministry being a true ministry
[49:34] was pointing and bearing witness of that
[49:37] light so when we look at this here
[49:39] brother Branham says it like this in
[49:41] spoken words original seed he said he
[49:44] that receives them that I sinned
[49:46] receives me and now them that he sinned
[49:49] and them that receives me receives him
[49:52] that sent me all he said I wish we could
[49:54] linger on that but you can only serve
[49:57] God as you do and believe the servants
[50:01] that God sins you can only serve God on
[50:05] earth has God's servants that sent on
[50:07] earth by divine inspiration interprets
[50:11] the word to you so God has ordained
[50:14] servants that he already has ordained
[50:17] for this moment it is in me and God
[50:19] don't need men that smart he don't need
[50:21] anybody to be smart all he needs is
[50:24] vessels that shielded he himself is the
[50:27] one that will proclaim his message and
[50:29] his life through us he don't need all of
[50:31] that he showed that with Moses when
[50:33] Moses wanted to try to put his intellect
[50:36] and everything to try to free him from
[50:38] Egypt but God said you can't free him by
[50:40] intellect all I need to do is get all
[50:43] the trash out of your life and I can
[50:45] step on the inside and I'm the one that
[50:48] will deliver them I was the one who
[50:51] spoke the word and I'm the one who comes
[50:53] on the scene to fulfill that word so God
[50:58] makes it known you can only serve Him
[51:00] badly received the servants to which he
[51:03] sins now remember many can look and
[51:06] proclaim and rally and we thank God for
[51:10] salvation we thank God for forgiveness
[51:12] of sins but remember with the ministry
[51:15] that God has given with those seven
[51:17] stars that are in his right hand those
[51:20] seven lamps that are before the throne
[51:22] those seven spirits remember what they
[51:24] are
[51:25] reflecting they are drawing from that
[51:27] true life of the atonement and they are
[51:30] reflecting that life back into the
[51:33] Church of the Living God and remember it
[51:35] is to call worshipers to worship Him in
[51:40] spirit and in truth
[51:42] so that's the ministry is bringing the
[51:45] people together in a unity now watch
[51:48] this when we look here in the scriptures
[51:50] we've been we've been dealing with this
[51:52] on the Tabernacle in the wilderness and
[51:53] I want to just hone in just a little bit
[51:55] more on this reflection in this life
[51:58] that is set before us we realized that
[52:00] with the tabernacle of God that each and
[52:02] every one of us are a three-room house
[52:04] we know that every one of us were made
[52:06] up of a three-room house and we also
[52:07] understand and we see that even within
[52:10] this here there was an approach that was
[52:12] ordained a gate whereby that men could
[52:15] actually enter aren't you thankful that
[52:17] God became the way there is no way that
[52:21] you and I could could ever make it but
[52:23] he became on entrance and away and and
[52:26] then through that way you and I can can
[52:28] enter in not just out here in the outer
[52:30] court but there's a way that's been made
[52:32] here in the holy place and and then a
[52:34] way that's been made into the holiest of
[52:36] Holies and we look at this light itself
[52:39] let me just hone in on this just a
[52:40] little bit because you look at how that
[52:43] when we're dealing with this on the
[52:44] candlesticks and in our lives of how
[52:47] that each one of these lamps are lamps
[52:50] of the candlestick they are they are to
[52:53] reflect him they are to show his
[52:56] brilliance they are to show his honor
[52:58] but you realized that it's not just
[53:00] something that's meant to be stationary
[53:03] in other words it's not something where
[53:05] you just come and look at it but there
[53:07] is a reason that these lights are where
[53:11] they are because these lights are set in
[53:15] a place here when we look at it as we
[53:17] move into the holy place right here
[53:20] these lights are set in a place right
[53:22] here this this candelabra here the
[53:24] menorah it's set here in a place so that
[53:27] there is light now remember this was
[53:29] this was an area that had to be attended
[53:31] to by Aaron it had to be attended to in
[53:34] the evening had to be cared for even in
[53:36] the morning
[53:37] and you look at how that when the
[53:39] Scriptures here would speak of this of
[53:41] how that these seven lamps how that they
[53:43] were to give light over against the
[53:46] candlestick I want you to look in here
[53:47] just for a moment you find the table of
[53:50] shewbread which the shewbread itself
[53:52] being the bread of his face the bread of
[53:54] his presence and I want you to look at
[53:56] this this altar of incense if you
[53:59] eliminate these lights you don't know
[54:01] what's in there and when you eliminate
[54:03] them Lots you don't recognize the bread
[54:06] of his presence which is actually the
[54:08] bread of his face that's what showbread
[54:10] means so you're not illuminated to the
[54:13] word so what is the light itself doing
[54:15] that lamp that one of those one of the
[54:18] spirits of God it illuminates it brings
[54:21] light upon the word it lifts the word
[54:24] from just letter to light and when the
[54:28] word is lifted to life then by word
[54:30] becomes a lamp unto my feet a light unto
[54:35] my path way so this light is not just
[54:39] something where we come in here and we
[54:42] glory around the light and we talked
[54:44] about how the vessel that God used its
[54:47] shop squirrel said its shot but we know
[54:49] that we're not glory in that we thank
[54:51] God for all the testimonies but remember
[54:54] here there is a witness walk in the
[54:56] light while you have the light lest
[54:59] darkness overtake you God doesn't need
[55:03] the physical messenger here upon earth
[55:06] it's the message that goes forth it's
[55:11] the message that is lied because the
[55:14] holy spirit vindicates and makes that
[55:17] word that was spoken that you and I can
[55:20] say that ain't brother branham's were
[55:21] that's God speaking that's God spoke
[55:25] that because a man's word will not act
[55:28] like that a man's word won't create
[55:31] don't you realize about the whole story
[55:34] of the squirrels and all those things
[55:36] it was speaking even in our life and it
[55:39] speaks even of the body change it's God
[55:42] providing for himself
[55:45] he's the
[55:46] one who spoke the rapture he's the one
[55:48] who declared there's gonna be a church
[55:51] without spot wrinkle blemish
[55:53] then he that declared he is Jehovah
[55:56] Jireh to provide for himself he is the
[56:00] word glory be to God in the highest
[56:04] so these lights the light it illuminates
[56:08] this light illuminates it shows it shows
[56:14] the direction to go and here's something
[56:20] oh my he dreamt full of new wine what's
[56:24] going on here
[56:25] it's 10:00 still light is shining what
[56:29] must we do to be saved what does the
[56:34] light do the light says I can point you
[56:37] to where I've been and where I'm living
[56:39] from but you've got to make this journey
[56:41] on your own what must I do repent see
[56:45] light is upon the world repent be
[56:49] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[56:51] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[56:53] Ghost
[56:54] those Peter could say I got it you got a
[56:58] hold of me so what is Peters what is the
[57:01] light that is shining through Peter what
[57:03] is the light that shines to you it
[57:05] points the people to the true and living
[57:08] way the Lord Jesus Christ doesn't point
[57:12] people to a church who I don't want
[57:17] dwell on that one tonight it points us
[57:19] to price so this is where the scripture
[57:23] could say let your light so shine I know
[57:33] you already know I'm very simple but
[57:36] sometimes this just certain little words
[57:37] it just grab off the screen and just
[57:38] literally shake me let your light not
[57:41] just let it shine let it so shine then
[57:46] men might see your good works and
[57:49] glorify your father which is in heaven
[57:53] I'll tell you right now is gonna be a
[57:55] testimony but by the works that they're
[57:57] seeing that there is
[57:59] greater reality than just man's effort
[58:02] but these works declare the Living God
[58:05] and it's only by the Living God and
[58:08] that's what the good works it's a life
[58:11] that's Express that brings glory to God
[58:14] now think of this let's look at this
[58:16] here in the scripture just a little bit
[58:18] there is a token that's to be on display
[58:20] and you think of how the scripture boy
[58:23] that's small you'll have problems seeing
[58:24] that tonight brother a you ever see that
[58:27] back there oh but if we're gonna get you
[58:29] some glasses I want I wondered about
[58:32] that and I really apologize for that but
[58:35] I think you all know the scriptures here
[58:37] I'm coming out of Exodus 12 you you
[58:39] pretty much know the scriptures I wasn't
[58:41] putting this so much to read it but
[58:42] notice how that God he declared that
[58:46] they were to take out a land and they're
[58:48] to take out that lamb for an offering
[58:50] there to kill that lamb and then when
[58:54] they were to kill that lamb they're to
[58:56] take a bunch of hyssop hyssop common
[58:58] faith it don't take great big faith
[59:01] it don't take huge and overarching faith
[59:05] to apply the promise of God it just
[59:06] simply takes on adulterated simple faith
[59:11] when you've got a need in your life
[59:14] that's all that it takes is simple
[59:16] common faith you say well I'm gonna come
[59:20] up here and I'm gonna be pray for fear
[59:22] if you don't have simple common faith
[59:24] this will do you no good but if you can
[59:26] just ask God even if you're looking and
[59:29] trying to believe if you can just be
[59:31] honest and say lord help my unbelief God
[59:35] will move on the scene you see let me
[59:37] tell you something God is drawn to
[59:39] humility he sure is God is drawn to
[59:43] honesty he's drawn to that and he or
[59:45] he'll even create within us what we even
[59:49] need to be able to satisfy the promise
[59:52] think of this take that lamb and to kill
[59:54] that lamb and to take the hyssop common
[59:59] faith and with that hyssop there to
[1:00:03] apply it upon the lentils and upon the
[1:00:06] post of the door and God let it be known
[1:00:09] he said that when I come through the
[1:00:11] land to smite
[1:00:12] with the curse and I see the blood upon
[1:00:15] the lentil and on the two side posts the
[1:00:18] Lord will pass over the door and will
[1:00:20] not suffer the destroyer to come in to
[1:00:23] your houses to smite you because there's
[1:00:25] already been a witness when the death
[1:00:27] angels looking at this blood let me tell
[1:00:30] you something the death angel knew
[1:00:31] whether that was good but blood or lamb
[1:00:34] blood he knew what kind of blood it was
[1:00:36] it wasn't just good enough to have blood
[1:00:38] it had to be lambs blood and that lambs
[1:00:41] blood had to be applied and when it was
[1:00:44] applied it was a witness death had
[1:00:46] already come to this house amen the
[1:00:49] firstborn inside of this house his safe
[1:00:52] under God's prevail yet that blood was a
[1:00:55] witness there it was a sign that there's
[1:00:57] already been judgment has come to this
[1:01:00] house
[1:01:00] and there the death angel would pass
[1:01:02] right over it was a token that was on
[1:01:05] display glory gonna hold it be to God
[1:01:13] forgive me for a little bit here but I
[1:01:15] think probably most of you seen the 10
[1:01:17] commandments I always think about that
[1:01:18] time when I'm looking over this of
[1:01:20] what's that guy's name day Fionn when
[1:01:22] he's in there you know and and then
[1:01:23] somebody had come and put blood over his
[1:01:25] door and then they come knock on his
[1:01:27] door and he said get out of here get out
[1:01:29] what do you mean get out on the governor
[1:01:32] here get out why are you telling me to
[1:01:35] get out what's all this on your door but
[1:01:39] he didn't put it there
[1:01:41] there won't be one go out of here that
[1:01:43] don't want to blood let me tell you
[1:01:47] something when that blood has been
[1:01:49] applied it identifies you and you're
[1:01:52] identified in it and by it I don't care
[1:01:56] where you go you're identified you
[1:01:59] understand what I'm saying
[1:02:00] it doesn't matter where you go you're
[1:02:02] still a Christian oh my luck we were
[1:02:06] dealing a little bit there on Friday
[1:02:08] night with Daniel down and down in
[1:02:10] Babylon you put Daniel down in Babylon
[1:02:12] but Daniel he purposed in his heart and
[1:02:15] you Daniel was going to live a
[1:02:17] victorious life right in the midst of
[1:02:19] Babylon how about you and I as Daniels
[1:02:23] right in the midst of Babylon God's got
[1:02:26] boys girls God's got men and women that
[1:02:29] can live victorious in the midst of
[1:02:31] Babylon lie the secret is the indwelling
[1:02:34] of his power on the inside oh my think
[1:02:39] of this here when we look at this
[1:02:43] think of it oh my that's so small well
[1:02:47] I'll read it to you in hell
[1:02:48] the blood was a token or an
[1:02:51] identification the blood identified that
[1:02:54] the worshipper had slain the lamb and
[1:02:56] accepted the lamb and apply the token to
[1:02:58] himself that he was not ashamed he
[1:03:01] didn't care who saw it he wanted
[1:03:04] everybody to see it and it was placed in
[1:03:07] such a position that everybody passing
[1:03:11] by could see that token you couldn't
[1:03:14] miss seeing that token it was on display
[1:03:17] there was no hiding it you say Jesus
[1:03:21] willing to be no you can't take this
[1:03:23] candle you don't put it under a bushel
[1:03:25] that's not the purpose of it being lit
[1:03:28] or that it's hidden under a bed but when
[1:03:30] it's lit it's placed on a candlestick
[1:03:32] that all that come in might see you see
[1:03:37] light itself if I had a lie and I'm
[1:03:39] holding that light down here maybe a
[1:03:41] candle or a lot and I'm holding it right
[1:03:43] here real close to the floor that ain't
[1:03:45] going to help you too much but when that
[1:03:47] light becomes and is lifted up when that
[1:03:50] light is lifted up the illumination or
[1:03:53] glory begins to illuminate in a greater
[1:03:55] way
[1:03:56] can't you see in this hour when there
[1:03:58] was a sounding on earth that said come
[1:04:01] out of Babylon my people and be you
[1:04:03] separated there was an echo in heaven
[1:04:06] that sounded that this is a heavenly
[1:04:09] voice as the third angel went fine come
[1:04:12] out of Babylon and the Bible says that
[1:04:14] the earth was enlightened with its glory
[1:04:17] amen a message that declared that God
[1:04:20] has a people a church he's been building
[1:04:23] he has been molding he has been shaping
[1:04:26] and he's calling about why it's time to
[1:04:28] leave here
[1:04:30] a message that illuminates gives light
[1:04:36] so that you and I might see our way out
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:43] Gloria is that many people wants to be
[1:04:47] Christians they like to do it secretly
[1:04:51] so nobody would know they were
[1:04:53] Christians or the associates they run
[1:04:56] around with some of them think we'll now
[1:04:58] look I want to be a Christian but I
[1:05:00] don't want so and sort of know about it
[1:05:02] well now you see that's not Christianity
[1:05:07] but I remember that I can identify with
[1:05:09] this quote right here I remember that at
[1:05:12] one time got quieted here I remember
[1:05:16] that as a young boy I remember that in
[1:05:19] the pressures and everything as I
[1:05:21] entered back in into school and all
[1:05:23] those things and now listen to me now I
[1:05:24] remember that but I also know when there
[1:05:28] came another visitation but it went much
[1:05:31] deeper it didn't matter who said what it
[1:05:36] didn't matter who put pressure on here
[1:05:38] there I should tell him when they came
[1:05:40] they would walk right by when I was
[1:05:42] selling suits they make their way in on
[1:05:44] Friday nights they would come in the
[1:05:46] door here it was a door that they
[1:05:48] wouldn't enter that mall you've been
[1:05:49] over there brother Joey where I worked
[1:05:50] at in the pennies they would come in
[1:05:52] that that direction right there they
[1:05:53] would come in there sometimes they were
[1:05:55] so tipsy and all of a sudden they would
[1:05:57] come in there you know giggling and
[1:05:59] cutting up but let me tell you something
[1:06:00] hi there was also other people that I
[1:06:02] worked with there in that job I would
[1:06:05] tell them people the same thing that I
[1:06:06] told others I said I've met that same
[1:06:09] God that you've no doubt heard about in
[1:06:11] the scriptures I met that God personally
[1:06:14] face-to-face and he changed my life the
[1:06:17] Samuel and the Sam browning that you
[1:06:20] once knew that guy don't live here no
[1:06:22] more
[1:06:23] the things that he used to like to do I
[1:06:25] don't like to do those things a little
[1:06:27] more that's a mystery to them but
[1:06:30] there's one thing about it they couldn't
[1:06:31] deny it because they knew the same
[1:06:35] browning that can make all kinds of
[1:06:37] promises and give him a few days and
[1:06:39] then promises are shredded come on
[1:06:43] somebody
[1:06:44] I know I'm preaching angels tonight you
[1:06:50] understand there's a there's a
[1:06:52] difference
[1:06:53] I don't care hey men huh what's this
[1:07:00] Christianity has to display it's token
[1:07:04] see publicly in public life at the
[1:07:07] office on the street when trouble is
[1:07:11] around anything in church Wow
[1:07:14] I mean isn't that just a given and that
[1:07:18] just a given I mean we're in church
[1:07:19] there are token the token is the life
[1:07:24] being applied and we have to apply the
[1:07:29] token right in church we've got to apply
[1:07:32] the token in our homes I'm not just
[1:07:36] talking about not having this and not
[1:07:38] having that it's got to go deeper even
[1:07:40] than that I'm talking about applying it
[1:07:42] on our attitudes I'm talking about
[1:07:46] applying it in forgiveness this is
[1:07:48] applying of this life you can't separate
[1:07:51] this message life you can't separate it
[1:07:56] and make it different if you try to
[1:07:58] separate it
[1:07:59] you've got doctrine here and you've got
[1:08:00] life over here you can't separate it
[1:08:03] it's the life itself that gives validity
[1:08:06] and strength and vindication to the
[1:08:09] doctrine Laura be to God everywhere else
[1:08:17] my the blood is in the token and the
[1:08:19] token must be applied or it's not even
[1:08:22] the Covenant it's not even in effect now
[1:08:27] look at this remember the scripture the
[1:08:32] Bible says grieve not whereby you are
[1:08:36] sealed with a holy spirit of promise
[1:08:41] I'll put this on there I don't know if
[1:08:44] this is real visible or not but you all
[1:08:46] seen a seal you boys seen don't just
[1:08:48] look at me y'all seen a seal or not
[1:08:50] because you know I'll stand right here
[1:08:52] and come right down there on you
[1:08:55] you guys have seen the seal before right
[1:08:58] when my wife and I went to go and and
[1:09:01] getting married I'm just put a simple
[1:09:02] okay they pulled out a document and that
[1:09:08] document they had to run it through a
[1:09:09] computer and put our names on there but
[1:09:12] there was somebody there that in the
[1:09:14] bottom part of that paper was like I
[1:09:16] don't know if it's a clay type stuff or
[1:09:18] what it is I don't need to know the
[1:09:20] mechanics of it all but you understand
[1:09:22] what I'm saying that the part of it is
[1:09:24] is that there was a part that is made on
[1:09:26] that document that's able to receive an
[1:09:29] impression and when you put that
[1:09:32] impression you could put that impression
[1:09:34] just on a piece of paper that impression
[1:09:38] is greater than even a signature this is
[1:09:42] somebody that is notarized in other
[1:09:45] words it's not just somebody can sign
[1:09:46] but this person has been approved by the
[1:09:48] government or the local government and
[1:09:51] they have been approved to notarize and
[1:09:53] say this marriage certificate is valid
[1:09:57] and it is in force and you know what you
[1:10:00] get your hands on it and you rub it it's
[1:10:02] raised up y'all know I'm talking about
[1:10:04] now you know I'm talking you rub it on
[1:10:07] the back and you can feel the
[1:10:08] indentations you can rub if you got
[1:10:09] fingernails you can rub it across there
[1:10:11] or you can rub it on the front and you
[1:10:13] know man there's been something touch
[1:10:15] this it actually changed the form of
[1:10:18] this paper because the actual seal has
[1:10:21] been impressed upon this now you can
[1:10:25] look at the front of that paper and
[1:10:26] you'll see something like this where you
[1:10:28] can read it but you can also flip that
[1:10:30] paper around and you know when you look
[1:10:32] at the backside of that paper it's been
[1:10:33] sealed this is where the Prophet said
[1:10:36] when you're sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:10:38] the seal on both sides of the paper both
[1:10:42] coming and going they can see the walk
[1:10:46] the talk the life of Christ reflecting
[1:10:49] in his people that's the purpose of his
[1:10:52] death the church that the church might
[1:10:55] continue his work but we've
[1:10:57] conglomerated it up with a bunch of
[1:10:59] everything so the purpose is to continue
[1:11:03] his work a seal is not just a
[1:11:07] ceil as a security a seal is a sign it
[1:11:11] shows coming and going when you enter a
[1:11:13] place and you exit a place understand it
[1:11:16] isn't Wow this is the man this is the
[1:11:20] wonderful I tell you what there's such a
[1:11:22] wonderful person and then they get
[1:11:24] around you and they're like dear Lord I
[1:11:26] wonder if there's another part of the
[1:11:27] plan I can get transferred to I wonder
[1:11:29] if there's another part you see coming
[1:11:31] and going now y'all understand I've got
[1:11:36] to put a little disclaimer here on this
[1:11:38] right here
[1:11:38] I understand friends that we all don't
[1:11:42] have the same temperament I understand
[1:11:45] that we all have different personalities
[1:11:47] part of your maturity is also
[1:11:50] recognizing that and reading over that
[1:11:53] in your own life and instead of saying
[1:11:55] that person I'll tell you but rather
[1:11:57] they aren't maybe they are the way they
[1:11:59] are God has allowed your paths to come
[1:12:01] across them so that you can see the
[1:12:04] greenness in your life that you and I
[1:12:06] have to so subject in our life and yet
[1:12:11] we're praying Oh God
[1:12:12] deliver me of this table delivery of
[1:12:13] this he will when you get a body change
[1:12:16] he will change your body and he'll
[1:12:18] change all your buttons you see why you
[1:12:23] just don't need to be a young person
[1:12:24] again because you still have them same
[1:12:27] buttons you got now you need to get your
[1:12:30] buttons changed not just a young body
[1:12:34] oh my so it's a showing coming and going
[1:12:38] now look how the Scriptures put it here
[1:12:41] but we are positioned in light the
[1:12:44] scripture said no man winning light of
[1:12:47] the candle cover that with a vessel or
[1:12:50] put a fit under a bed if he's doing that
[1:12:53] in aimed and lit what's the purpose of
[1:12:57] lighting it but he said if it notices
[1:13:03] set if it on a candlestick look at this
[1:13:06] if the can't glory if it is there to be
[1:13:09] lit it shows there's something to be lit
[1:13:11] and they're showing that there's
[1:13:13] something to be lit something must come
[1:13:16] to light it
[1:13:17] it's got to be ignitable and there
[1:13:20] must be a source of ignition and there
[1:13:23] is also a place for placing seda fit on
[1:13:30] a candlestick so as we see this God's
[1:13:34] positioning us within the light of the
[1:13:37] word in this hour that our lives are a
[1:13:40] reflection of that light think of this
[1:13:44] now another part of the scripture no man
[1:13:48] say it same same thought no man when he
[1:13:50] hath lighted a candle put us in in a
[1:13:52] secret place neither under a bushel but
[1:13:54] on a candlestick that they which come in
[1:13:58] may see the light 9 so God how God has
[1:14:06] has a reflection of this hour as we said
[1:14:08] remember earlier with the candlesticks
[1:14:10] and how that we can look at our lives
[1:14:13] there it's God's desire that our lives
[1:14:15] would point people to Jesus Christ if
[1:14:20] our lives and listen to me now if our
[1:14:23] lives only point people to the church
[1:14:26] we're missing it if our lives point
[1:14:29] people to the messenger we're missing it
[1:14:32] we're to point people to Jesus Christ
[1:14:36] you understand now because when when
[1:14:39] they come and Christ is being revealed
[1:14:42] listen friends there's no way listen to
[1:14:44] me there's no way in the world that you
[1:14:46] and I can go into the scriptures in this
[1:14:48] hour but God has illuminated this Bible
[1:14:52] the message then take away from the
[1:14:54] Bible the message came right out of this
[1:14:57] Bible it's brought the word that was in
[1:15:00] letter now to light it didn't take away
[1:15:04] from it as a matter of fact I love my
[1:15:06] Bible more every day I love my Bible
[1:15:10] more when I'm reading in the Bible I'm
[1:15:12] not just reading stories I'm reading
[1:15:14] about me and the Lord Jesus it's not
[1:15:18] just stories when I read about Abraham
[1:15:21] setting up the tent door I myself said
[1:15:24] after 10 door I
[1:15:26] expecting him to come these are not
[1:15:30] stories these are prophecies hallelujah
[1:15:38] not events of history many can just look
[1:15:41] back at history but when you know the
[1:15:43] God of history to be the same I am then
[1:15:46] you can know and believe that what he
[1:15:49] did back there he's still the same God
[1:15:51] and then these are not just history this
[1:15:53] is not just stories but you see it has
[1:15:56] absolutely possibilities in your own
[1:15:59] life that God might be able to move
[1:16:02] glory be to God in the highest you love
[1:16:05] him tonight oh my brother brems said it
[1:16:11] like this the only way that the world
[1:16:13] will ever see Christ is when they see it
[1:16:16] in you and me and that's the only way
[1:16:18] they'll ever see Christ he said their
[1:16:23] conscience are known how many know that
[1:16:27] the this was said clear back there in
[1:16:30] the time 1961 lord have mercy their
[1:16:33] conscience are numbed in what about now
[1:16:38] you're doing good if you can get them to
[1:16:40] look off their phone for a minute and
[1:16:41] look at you you're doing real good if
[1:16:44] you can drive down the highway and there
[1:16:45] don't have their phone up here like this
[1:16:48] hey you and I we both see I see it all
[1:16:51] the time it don't matter what kind of
[1:16:53] laws they put in place people still do
[1:16:55] it you know what that is that's an
[1:16:58] addiction that's exactly what it is it's
[1:17:01] an addiction but oh I'm so glad that God
[1:17:05] breaks addictions aren't you oh yes sir
[1:17:09] their conscience are numb to the sunsets
[1:17:12] it's just a sunset to the call of the
[1:17:16] birds to the leaves to the grass and to
[1:17:19] the flowers and the music and the
[1:17:21] message and so forth that we enjoy after
[1:17:24] we have found Christ now I know you may
[1:17:26] not enjoy cutting the grass but you also
[1:17:31] realize that as you cut it down it grows
[1:17:33] right back you see the leaves right they
[1:17:36] fall off the tree but
[1:17:38] you see him come back when you see the
[1:17:41] birds fine it's a witness to you you
[1:17:44] realize that God is present now think of
[1:17:49] this here when we look at it in showing
[1:17:53] forth his praises this scripture would
[1:17:55] begin to look at last week out of the
[1:17:57] book of Peter ye are a chosen generation
[1:18:01] what a responsibility a royal priesthood
[1:18:06] an holy nation a peculiar people that
[1:18:14] you should show forth the praises of him
[1:18:18] who hath called you out of darkness into
[1:18:21] his marvelous light he is the light he
[1:18:29] has called us out of darkness into his
[1:18:34] marvelous light why we are to show forth
[1:18:39] the praises of him
[1:18:42] the scripture says which in times past
[1:18:45] were not a people but are now the people
[1:18:49] of God this word people it it don't mean
[1:18:52] that as a goal it was like you were in
[1:18:55] nobody but you were out of the line and
[1:18:59] walking in the line that you would walk
[1:19:02] in you were always a part of him are you
[1:19:07] with me
[1:19:07] you are always ordained in him the
[1:19:12] Prophet tells us improving his word in
[1:19:14] 1964 he said you are ordained in him but
[1:19:18] he said you've come in this life and the
[1:19:21] light has shone upon you to confirm your
[1:19:24] place in this life you are always a part
[1:19:29] of this word that's why nothing else
[1:19:32] could satisfy and nothing else can
[1:19:36] satisfy but him you are ordained you
[1:19:40] were not a people you were not a part of
[1:19:42] that body but yet how he sought you out
[1:19:45] brought you unto himself and by one
[1:19:48] spirit
[1:19:50] baptized into one body we are people now
[1:19:56] we are the people of God look at this
[1:19:59] last part set which had not obtained
[1:20:02] mercy but now have obtained mercy so
[1:20:06] when we were out and whatever condition
[1:20:09] we were in we had not obtained mercy
[1:20:12] mercy had not become manifest in our
[1:20:15] life but when the word itself come
[1:20:18] across our pathway and that word
[1:20:20] illuminates and lightens our life then
[1:20:24] we have obtained a mercy
[1:20:26] let me tell you something David the
[1:20:29] Bible says surely goodness and mercy
[1:20:31] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:20:33] that word follow means chase after mercy
[1:20:38] and goodness chased after me all the
[1:20:41] days of my life and I shall dwell in the
[1:20:44] house of the Lord forever glory be to
[1:20:47] God look at this here we're God's
[1:20:53] billboard you've ever seen a billboard
[1:21:00] I've never seen terrible billboards I
[1:21:04] have but I've never seen a billboard
[1:21:10] that shows a nasty Big Mac I've never
[1:21:14] seen a billboard let's just talk about
[1:21:15] McDonald's I've never seen a billboard
[1:21:17] that shows a Big Mac with wilted lettuce
[1:21:20] I've never seen that Big Mac looked like
[1:21:22] an elephant stamped on and it gave it to
[1:21:24] you and it's all you know laying all
[1:21:25] over but what I see on the Billboard
[1:21:27] everything is just springing it's almost
[1:21:32] where you may not even have the size of
[1:21:34] hands to grip around it there's a little
[1:21:38] drops of moisture on the lettuce so
[1:21:40] place down there the the sauce is not
[1:21:44] running all over the place and and the
[1:21:46] seeds halfway ripped off the bun on top
[1:21:48] and then laying over like this it looks
[1:21:50] perfect
[1:21:53] till you order it and get it
[1:21:56] I don't like Big Macs myself but
[1:22:02] Benjamin does I don't like him you give
[1:22:04] me just a regular little simple
[1:22:06] cheeseburger you know I'm talking about
[1:22:10] of course with a little bit of fries
[1:22:12] grass-fed ones God's billboard now look
[1:22:18] at this
[1:22:18] I believe Rosenbaum said that the
[1:22:21] Christian is God's billboard I believe
[1:22:26] that each one of us is God's billboard
[1:22:28] and we don't have to do so much carrying
[1:22:30] on about it as we do just simply live
[1:22:34] such a lot that'll make the people
[1:22:37] hungry to be like you
[1:22:40] now you've ever seen a billboard to
[1:22:43] talked I never seen it don't want to say
[1:22:49] hey drive on in here never seen that but
[1:22:55] that billboard has such a picture on it
[1:22:57] you don't need to talk you see what
[1:23:02] picture is displayed it tells it all and
[1:23:06] the picture that Psalm there will cause
[1:23:09] you to check exit 135 oh what is that
[1:23:12] honey what is that for be okay for B
[1:23:13] let's make sure exit 135 is for bees I
[1:23:16] don't want for a for what's making you
[1:23:18] do that what is that the advertisement
[1:23:22] the Billboard is getting your attention
[1:23:25] you're hungry now you're hungry how do I
[1:23:28] get to that and satisfy this hunger
[1:23:31] there is a path of life or a way that is
[1:23:34] pointed out to you exit 135 for B it's
[1:23:40] attractive but then again after you've
[1:23:44] ate lunch or I've ate dinner let me
[1:23:46] drive down the road I don't care about a
[1:23:49] Big Mac some people I don't care about
[1:23:52] it I don't care what I'm full I'm not
[1:23:55] hungry
[1:23:56] now you put a dish ice cream there on
[1:23:58] that side you see God kissed me at the
[1:24:02] right time but somebody's got to be
[1:24:07] hungry so you see a billboard just
[1:24:08] simply displays to the hungry and it's
[1:24:13] attractive to the hungry he said each
[1:24:17] one of you from tonight on remember you
[1:24:20] are God's billboards you're God's
[1:24:23] advertising agent the world will look at
[1:24:26] you to see what Christ is look look at
[1:24:31] you the same I want to tell just let
[1:24:35] them look first when they look then then
[1:24:41] if opportunity presents then you can
[1:24:46] speak
[1:24:50] it's kind of hard look look look look
[1:24:53] look it's kind of hard you all know what
[1:24:54] it is I mean man when you drop down into
[1:24:56] West Virginia and you drive down
[1:24:59] sometimes parts of Kentucky ooh
[1:25:02] now I don't have nothing against them
[1:25:04] states but the thing of it is is that
[1:25:07] you can sometimes you can't hardly get
[1:25:09] somewhere to get something they you
[1:25:12] wouldn't know what's up some of them
[1:25:14] hollers if they didn't put it out there
[1:25:15] and you get spoiled by living in Ohio
[1:25:18] you think they got a McDonald's on this
[1:25:20] exit I'll get up and nobody told you
[1:25:22] you've got to make 10 miles around Mindy
[1:25:25] twisty around the mountains to get to
[1:25:27] this little McDonald's right you're
[1:25:29] expecting like you are in Ojai sure
[1:25:31] right up danceing ramp there it is and
[1:25:33] you get off and you're driving around
[1:25:35] and mrs. GPS is redirecting
[1:25:37] recalculating recalculating
[1:25:38] recalculating recalculating study
[1:25:41] getting there 3:00 p.m. you'll get there
[1:25:43] 6:00 p.m. now it's taking you all around
[1:25:46] but listen to me listen you would not
[1:25:48] even go that way if there wasn't a
[1:25:52] billboard out here on the roadway that
[1:25:55] lets you know there's a place down this
[1:25:58] road so there's got to be a billboard
[1:26:02] that lets you know there is a place down
[1:26:05] this road glory
[1:26:12] so we don't want to smear a big lot of
[1:26:15] stuff on there that testify about things
[1:26:18] that we really are not let's first be
[1:26:21] that and then when we be that then the
[1:26:25] world will see Christ in you and me
[1:26:28] on the billboard if you put a lot of
[1:26:31] words on a billboard there is going to
[1:26:34] be accidents right there you don't put a
[1:26:38] lot of words on a billboard you show
[1:26:41] them what you have to offer the only
[1:26:47] words that are there is to point them in
[1:26:49] to direct them where they need to go to
[1:26:51] satisfy the hunger that have been
[1:26:53] stirred up in them that all right
[1:27:06] we don't have to have big audiences we
[1:27:08] don't have to preach the 10,000 we don't
[1:27:10] have to even preach we can be God's
[1:27:13] advertisement board how do you all want
[1:27:17] you to watch this now how do you know
[1:27:20] that your life might not start some
[1:27:23] young man on the gospel your life might
[1:27:29] start some young man on the gospel some
[1:27:31] of you older men you older women want a
[1:27:34] responsibility all both Samuel I just

[1:27:46] word I just joined the presence of God

[1:27:50] yourself if you don't shine your light
[1:27:53] you don't look around and see one life
[1:27:56] can be passed on to somebody else
[1:27:58] come on friends we're missing a great
[1:28:00] part of Christianity when coming to
[1:28:02] church is just about you driving in to
[1:28:05] the parking lot and you leaving all of a
[1:28:08] sudden and not sticking around with the
[1:28:10] body and not even being in consideration
[1:28:13] for others and a burden we're missing
[1:28:16] the purpose as your candle is that under
[1:28:19] a bushel is it under a bed whoo I'll
[1:28:23] show me preach billa's Enya hey listen I
[1:28:29] got all the fingers coming right back
[1:28:30] here at me as well - we are to be
[1:28:34] servants one of another if we if we
[1:28:37] don't give with listen friends if all
[1:28:39] we're doing is coming to the house of
[1:28:41] God that ain't no different than going
[1:28:42] to McDonald's you show up an order you
[1:28:45] cram your face and then you leave that's
[1:28:47] not what it is to come to the house of
[1:28:50] God it's to be a part of a body of
[1:28:53] believers
[1:28:55] it's recognize you've got a
[1:28:58] responsibility here not to straighten
[1:29:00] everybody out we don't need that we just
[1:29:03] need you to let your light shine and
[1:29:05] have a burden for the kingdom of
[1:29:08] Almighty God that's what we need
[1:29:11] that's the lives that we need
[1:29:14] but you see this age this age is all
[1:29:17] about self Mayan got time last time I
[1:29:22] talked to somebody you know forget about
[1:29:25] that maybe the last time you talked to
[1:29:26] him you talked in the wrong way I don't
[1:29:30] get to that tonight but maybe that's
[1:29:32] what it was there's an approach you see
[1:29:34] what it is your life is giving out light
[1:29:40] maybe it's the light of testimony in
[1:29:43] your life how God has brought you
[1:29:45] through a trial and that trial nobody
[1:29:49] else could drink that cup but you but
[1:29:51] you got a testimony and somebody else
[1:29:53] comes along the way listen to me now
[1:29:55] somebody else comes along the way and
[1:29:57] God will inspire that to be given you
[1:29:59] understand I'm saying these are not
[1:30:01] things just just spoke out sporadically
[1:30:02] but I believe that just as God himself
[1:30:06] would ordain the word to be ministered
[1:30:08] here tonight
[1:30:09] I believe God also inspires his children
[1:30:12] that they themselves would testify and
[1:30:15] you and be able to give a witness when
[1:30:17] you're out there when you with another
[1:30:19] brothers sister ideally that God is
[1:30:21] still God so many times people talk
[1:30:26] about nickel alien ism but many times
[1:30:28] it's not addressed about reverse nickel
[1:30:30] alien ism they want to put everything on
[1:30:34] the plaster put everything on the
[1:30:36] prophet who laureate ho the Prophet did
[1:30:39] everything well the pastor did
[1:30:41] everything this is not a one-man
[1:30:44] ministry this is a body he that were
[1:30:50] witness of the light
[1:30:52] he has come and that message is
[1:30:54] influencing our lives to Jesus Christ
[1:30:57] and you and I are to be illuminated by
[1:31:00] that light whoo
[1:31:04] it's a responsibility you know you're
[1:31:06] going to give recount will give an
[1:31:07] account if you live your life to
[1:31:11] yourself you might want to check if it's
[1:31:13] really eternal life flowing through you
[1:31:16] or say God you know what I got my mind
[1:31:19] I'm too busy on all this I got all this
[1:31:21] projects I got all this I got all of
[1:31:22] this on my meditation is so tore up god
[1:31:25] I can't even think about you
[1:31:28] let me tell you something friends I
[1:31:31] believe with all my heart win huh God by
[1:31:34] His grace I know what it means also to
[1:31:35] be busy and I'm thankful for all those
[1:31:37] times that God allowed me even in the
[1:31:40] times when I work there and teaching and
[1:31:41] pastoring right here when sometimes your
[1:31:43] mind is so busy so busy with so many
[1:31:46] things to where somebody can say I'm
[1:31:48] busy I understand that what it means to
[1:31:50] be busy but I also know what it means
[1:31:52] that even in the midst of the busyness
[1:31:54] to where my mind and my heart by God's
[1:31:57] grace would still be upon him and how
[1:31:59] many times in the midst of a busiest
[1:32:02] times where the Spirit of God would come
[1:32:04] right there I might be taking him on a
[1:32:06] bathroom break at school and the Holy
[1:32:08] Ghost come right down and I would write
[1:32:10] on a poster note things that would
[1:32:12] actually come forth as a message from
[1:32:14] here let me tell you something God
[1:32:16] didn't do that just because there was a
[1:32:18] gift in my life I'm telling you each and
[1:32:21] every one can have that same kind of
[1:32:23] visitation as you meditate on him and
[1:32:26] realize it's not about me it's not about
[1:32:29] my job everything that I talk about it's
[1:32:32] not about me I can't do this because of
[1:32:34] this I can't how about giving a
[1:32:36] testimony of the word I can do all
[1:32:39] things through Christ who strengtheneth
[1:32:42] me cuz he ain't a high priest of our
[1:32:46] complaints start some young man on the
[1:32:56] field out there that would win ten
[1:32:58] thousand souls to Christ it was because
[1:33:01] that he saw Christ in you it's you look
[1:33:04] at this statement what a powerful
[1:33:06] statement it's you presented Christ to
[1:33:08] him in the simple power of the gospel
[1:33:26] I'm gonna just stop here on this this is
[1:33:30] what were to do tell how your candle got
[1:33:36] lit brother brems said it in many other
[1:33:42] times he said if you can't tell somebody
[1:33:45] about all these other things he said
[1:33:49] just tell him how your candle got matte
[1:33:52] just tell them what what what what lit
[1:33:54] you up let me let me pass this on by
[1:33:56] here cuz I'll get to this here Lord
[1:33:59] willing we'll just skip that I'm andin
[1:34:06] I'm in it cuz I'm gonna give you
[1:34:08] chocolate cake and you've got a rush to
[1:34:09] eat it actually this is more steak so
[1:34:12] we'll just we're gonna wait as soon as
[1:34:16] God lights the candle take off take off
[1:34:23] if you don't know more don't know no
[1:34:26] more just telling how it got lit let
[1:34:30] them get lit and they'll tell somebody
[1:34:33] else and we'll have a candle lighting
[1:34:37] time but brother Samuel isn't God the
[1:34:42] one to light them yes but he will not
[1:34:45] work outside of his body the eunuch was
[1:34:51] to be lit he was reading Isaiah's
[1:34:57] prophecy are you with me he was reading
[1:35:00] Isaiah's prophecy but the Spirit of God
[1:35:04] had Philip go down there fell upon the
[1:35:08] Prophet he was an evangelist a deacon in
[1:35:13] the church but he was led by the Spirit
[1:35:16] of God and Philip was told by God go
[1:35:19] join yourself to this chariot and as he
[1:35:23] joined himself to that chariot he simply
[1:35:25] asked him a question
[1:35:28] do you understand what you're reading
[1:35:35] do you understand what you're reading
[1:35:38] what's the approach God through Philip
[1:35:45] those scriptures became opened to the
[1:35:51] eunuch and you know how to spoken words
[1:35:54] original seed you know it from a
[1:35:56] personal witness in your life but the
[1:35:59] Prophet tells us the seed of life
[1:36:01] travels through the body
[1:36:08] seed of life travels and that is God's
[1:36:11] Way you understand this is why God is
[1:36:17] why the Prophet labored over and over
[1:36:20] through the message God does not use
[1:36:23] mechanical devices he does he said if
[1:36:28] God wanted the Sun to preach the gospel
[1:36:31] he could have done it he could have done
[1:36:34] that but God didn't do that God has
[1:36:38] ordained preachers to preach the gospel
[1:36:40] and he's also ordained you and I to live
[1:36:43] and to express that word have a candle
[1:36:48] lighting time that's what we need anyhow
[1:36:50] instead of so much theology candle
[1:36:52] lighting just tell how it got lit that's
[1:36:56] all you have to tell
[1:36:57] don't try to preach it just say how it
[1:37:02] got lit I got filled with something
[1:37:06] that's burning me up
[1:37:08] I got filled with something that's
[1:37:12] burning me up just tell about the
[1:37:15] lighting time how it got lit and it'll
[1:37:18] give the light as it burns down let that
[1:37:20] one light let let that one lights
[1:37:24] another one and then he'll tell how it
[1:37:26] got lit and he'll tell how and lit there
[1:37:28] will be a light around there after a
[1:37:29] while it will just tell that much
[1:37:32] remember
[1:37:35] that on the altar the fire was lit from
[1:37:39] before of the Lord and that fire was
[1:37:43] taken from there and the consuming of
[1:37:46] that sacrifice and they walked in to
[1:37:51] light the candle stick and his lamps but
[1:37:58] every lamp was lit when he lit this lamp
[1:38:03] he took the fire from that lamp passed
[1:38:06] it here then the fire from this one he
[1:38:08] just didn't hold in light showing that
[1:38:12] life travels through the body the Holy
[1:38:17] Spirit travels through the body and this
[1:38:20] is what the Prophet is saying right here
[1:38:21] tell how your candle got lit because
[1:38:25] remember it isn't that God listen to me
[1:38:28] now
[1:38:28] God doesn't need a pastor to light
[1:38:30] somebody he don't need a prophet to
[1:38:33] light somebody God can move right
[1:38:36] through your surrendered vessel and your
[1:38:41] life points the way and as they yield to
[1:38:46] that you tell how you got lit and watch
[1:38:49] how God can move for them and they can
[1:38:52] have faith that they can be lit to be
[1:38:55] lit by that same God you're loving
[1:38:57] tonight all let your light so shine I
[1:39:03] want to be God's faithful billboard
[1:39:06] don't you I don't want to be I don't I'm
[1:39:10] not interested I don't have to say
[1:39:12] everything you don't have to be say you
[1:39:14] just just let it be on display let it be
[1:39:17] what a calls are hungry if they're
[1:39:20] hungry God will open the door got to
[1:39:24] open the door and then you can tell them
[1:39:25] exit this far ahead this many miles well
[1:39:29] how far is it to so I get that well it's
[1:39:31] three steps I mean three steps of grace
[1:39:33] or three miles ahead and you're going to
[1:39:35] get off right here and it'll be a sharp
[1:39:38] turn but you've got to be willing to
[1:39:40] love him more than self and you keep
[1:39:43] moving around there more than father and
[1:39:46] mother sister a brother
[1:39:49] it's a light that's so shines it's a
[1:39:55] billboard that says it all maybe tonight
[1:40:00] you might feel like Oh Samuel I feel
[1:40:02] like my paper needs to be done up a
[1:40:04] little bit I feel like one of them
[1:40:06] billboards it seemed like it's a little
[1:40:07] tattered on the side but remember he
[1:40:09] don't have to repair your soul
[1:40:11] he's already sealed that song there
[1:40:15] might be some things on the outside
[1:40:16] that's not reflecting from the inside
[1:40:19] the way that it ought to be but this is
[1:40:21] where you can't apply the token it's
[1:40:25] medicine that you can take and if
[1:40:28] there's anything that's hindering that
[1:40:29] life from reflecting and showing its way
[1:40:34] through there's a cleansing agent that
[1:40:37] can flush out any flu that stopped up he
[1:40:41] can put back to the papers where it
[1:40:43] needs to be he can create right from our
[1:40:47] life and bring forth that hunger now I
[1:40:51] might require you having to go ask
[1:40:53] somebody for forgiveness you might have
[1:40:57] to go and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have
[1:40:59] said it but I mean you don't know what
[1:41:00] no but maybe you have to do that and
[1:41:04] when you find you're doing that you'll
[1:41:06] find that paper going right back up over
[1:41:08] brother Sam what will they think if I
[1:41:10] come and I confess that they'll think
[1:41:13] you're a real Christian that's what
[1:41:16] they'll think you're a real Christian
[1:41:19] brother branham in his time when he
[1:41:23] hollered back in the house and said tell
[1:41:25] him I'm not here but then the Holy
[1:41:29] Spirit moved upon his heart I went to
[1:41:33] pray for that baby you know the story
[1:41:35] but then he came back around and he made
[1:41:37] it right to those agents what did those
[1:41:40] agents say for the brand we always had
[1:41:43] respect for you before but we've got
[1:41:45] more respect for you now and if saying
[1:41:49] sorry is a hard word for you ask God if
[1:41:54] forgive me is a hard phrase
[1:41:56] Scot because remember we are part of
[1:42:01] that family tree not this tree so he
[1:42:07] gives us the ability to say Oh me
[1:42:23] you might think that's strange but
[1:42:25] sometimes it's awful hard but I'll tell
[1:42:28] you what if we're tapped into that life
[1:42:30] then we are ordained and we have access
[1:42:36] to him I just want my life I believe you
[1:42:40] want your life to to be that life that
[1:42:43] invites to the hungry I don't want to
[1:42:46] invite everybody I'm gonna leave you
[1:42:50] with this tonight I don't want to invite
[1:42:51] everybody but yet I'm out there to be
[1:42:54] displayed before everybody but the only
[1:42:58] ones I want to invite are those that's
[1:43:01] hungry and if they're not hungry now
[1:43:05] I'll be on maybe that same job next week
[1:43:08] maybe they get hungry they're not hungry
[1:43:12] next week maybe they'll be hungry
[1:43:14] tomorrow if they ain't hungry this month
[1:43:16] maybe they'll be hungry next month if
[1:43:19] they ain't hungry next month maybe
[1:43:20] they'll be hungry next year if God
[1:43:22] terry's but one way or another what I
[1:43:26] have it steals fresh it still is a
[1:43:32] satisfied to the hungry so it's there
[1:43:36] it's there it don't matter what they
[1:43:38] said or what they thought it's still
[1:43:40] open 24 hours seven days a week because
[1:43:48] the CEO and manager of this corporation
[1:43:51] never slumbers or sleeps it's always in
[1:43:56] stock they never run out of stock at all
[1:43:58] you never have to worry about showing up
[1:44:01] at the menu and they say we're out of
[1:44:03] that right now if you did this got here
[1:44:05] earlier no but a whole menu as a matter
[1:44:08] of fact this isn't just breakfast time

[1:44:42] thankful dear God for your mercy in your
[1:44:45] grace Lord tonight throughout this
[1:44:46] building or perhaps hearts lives that
[1:44:50] Lord as we would desire and hunger that
[1:44:55] our lives would be true billboards let's
[1:44:59] speak and Express of you Lord Lord Jesus
[1:45:05] I think Lord as I many times I know some
[1:45:10] different ones Lord for the herb sister
[1:45:12] eat a different ones Lord that lived
[1:45:14] down and some of those southern states
[1:45:16] and even different ones of us has
[1:45:18] traveled down through there Lord
[1:45:19] sometimes you're looking on the side of
[1:45:21] a hill you'll see a cross sometimes Lord
[1:45:24] you'll see crosses sometimes you'll see
[1:45:27] billboards where will you spend eternity
[1:45:30] sometimes Lord there'll be a big
[1:45:32] billboard Jesus is the answer
[1:45:36] Lord many of them places all the way
[1:45:38] down through their North Carolina
[1:45:39] Tennessee in different places it's
[1:45:41] referred to as the Bible Belt but I look
[1:45:47] at it Lord are those really the best
[1:45:52] billboards those billboards are words on
[1:45:59] a sign people can read that and there's
[1:46:04] people that have become so custom that
[1:46:07] they can drive by cross after cross
[1:46:09] billboard after billboard they're numb
[1:46:14] to those billboards like it has become
[1:46:18] with the grass the flowers the birds
[1:46:23] but what about a life back at me place
[1:46:28] right before maybe out of their own
[1:46:30] family maybe in the plant maybe in the
[1:46:35] place where they work a life that has
[1:46:39] been so transformed but there is not
[1:46:45] enough psychiatrist and psychologist
[1:46:47] that could have ever turned that man or
[1:46:49] woman around they realized this person's
[1:46:53] not been reformed but there's a light
[1:46:56] there illuminated it's like that little
[1:47:01] man known as tiny that German he would
[1:47:06] go in that store he was so happy how he
[1:47:09] had been lit up on the power of God but
[1:47:13] yet Lord God his boss said what in the
[1:47:17] world is wrong with you he said oh I've
[1:47:21] been down to the meeting last night and
[1:47:24] I got saved
[1:47:26] you mean you been down there ha me with
[1:47:29] that bunch of junk is it all thank God
[1:47:33] for the young thank God for the nuts Oh
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:39] God
[1:47:41] his life had been lit up wood there was
[1:47:46] a change that came about his life Lord
[1:47:49] countless countless number of
[1:47:53] testimonies through the Scriptures the
[1:47:57] insight that the Spirit of God would
[1:47:59] take through the prophetic eye in the
[1:48:01] Sonora that would talk to us about
[1:48:02] Zacchaeus and his wife Oh God
[1:48:10] I believe with all my heart Lord but I'm
[1:48:15] not only speaking to your billboards I
[1:48:18] believe I'm one of the billboards
[1:48:22] we don't have to have a lot of words as
[1:48:26] your prophet said in one of these quotes
[1:48:28] right here so you don't have to preach
[1:48:30] just live the simple power of the gospel
[1:48:37] help us Lord help us just that our lives
[1:48:42] would reflect you not a bunch of letters
[1:48:46] not a bunch of words but let it just
[1:48:49] reflect you because people will never
[1:48:52] look at exit 135 for B first they don't
[1:48:55] catch their attention
[1:48:57] it's that whopper that Big Mac that
[1:49:00] ice-cream whatever it is it's a picture
[1:49:03] and then if that picture is something
[1:49:06] that speaks to their hunger
[1:49:09] they'll look they'll look at the words
[1:49:13] because that picture will point them to
[1:49:17] the words your life inside of us Lord
[1:49:21] God it'll never leave people outside of
[1:49:23] the word it leads people to you not to a
[1:49:28] church to a movement it leads people to
[1:49:33] you this is our desire
[1:49:35] help us father help every young person
[1:49:38] every old help us father as we see the
[1:49:42] responsibility in this hour and this
[1:49:44] time we'll God
[1:49:46] from our lives or their lives might be
[1:49:50] living
[1:49:55] further we do still want to hand out the
[1:49:56] gospel because the gospel can now be
[1:49:59] handed out as you said in your word
[1:50:04] all set our gospel came not in word only
[1:50:10] but in power and demonstration so as
[1:50:16] your prophet would tell us over
[1:50:17] countless number of times he said the
[1:50:19] Bible is not altogether the gospel the
[1:50:23] gospel is the Living Word in action and
[1:50:28] demonstration Oh God
[1:50:31] let our lights this is our desire let
[1:50:35] our light so shine more tonight many of
[1:50:41] us Lord will never get a chance maybe to
[1:50:43] tread on other foreign soil but may we
[1:50:48] so illuminate the soil that you've
[1:50:51] ordained that our feet to walk upon
[1:50:55] may our feet be that Lord God ever
[1:50:59] publish good tidings of peace help us
[1:51:04] father I pray Lord God strengthen us
[1:51:09] tonight in our homes in our lives right
[1:51:13] here in this church Lord God help us
[1:51:15] father may we Lord God not get so caught
[1:51:19] up in the cosmos of this hour where it
[1:51:23] begins if everything is just centered
[1:51:26] around us but may it be centered around
[1:51:33] you that's that's where the line itself
[1:51:36] shines
