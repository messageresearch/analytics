[41:17] is this good to be back home I don't
[41:21] know how you were last week but my week
[41:24] was just kind of off a man with Tuesday
[41:27] night service but you know sometimes I I
[41:30] told my wife later on that night I said
[41:33] sometimes I said I think it's good for
[41:35] us to get thrown off sometimes we can
[41:38] get so locked into routine and that's
[41:41] what we become but it's so good
[41:43] sometimes to wear how God will just come
[41:46] by our way you know provided that we
[41:48] could be able to come together and just
[41:51] want to say it certainly appreciated
[41:53] your prayers for the services just had
[41:56] just just a real operand of the Holy
[41:59] Ghost and just in in the services and
[42:03] just to witness what God amen was doing
[42:06] there among the young people in the
[42:08] services that we had there brother Mike
[42:11] walls the young people I think there was
[42:13] about a hundred 40 young people they
[42:16] were there now brother Mike Walsh has a
[42:17] lot of young people
[42:18] so we there was just a few visitors that
[42:22] were there and
[42:24] then on Sunday morning there with the
[42:27] church there in Washington DC or right
[42:30] outside of it at whether Mike walls we
[42:32] just ministered there as well just
[42:35] seeing God just come on the scene amen
[42:37] and just ministering to lives and hearts
[42:40] and God just bringing change to life so
[42:44] I want you to know that even though all
[42:47] the details I can't go through that but
[42:49] just to know that your prayers amen
[42:52] God heard your prayers amen and so we
[42:55] just think God for that you may not ever
[42:57] know on this side but when you get to
[43:00] the other side my he's not he won't
[43:02] forget you're working labor of love amen
[43:06] for everything that we have done for the
[43:07] Lord is surely not in vain amen so let's
[43:11] read here in the word in first samuel 14
[43:13] verse 24 and we're just going to look at
[43:17] these scriptures and then we'll let you
[43:19] be seated in verse 24 and the men of
[43:21] israel were distressed that day and for
[43:24] saul had adjourned the people saying
[43:26] cursed be the man that eateth any food
[43:30] until evening that I may be avenged on
[43:33] mine enemies so none of the people
[43:35] tasted any food and all they of the land
[43:39] came to a wood and there was honey upon
[43:42] the ground and when the people were come
[43:44] into the wood behold the honey dropped
[43:47] but no man put his hand to his mouth for
[43:50] the people feared the old but Jonathan
[43:55] heard not when his father charged the
[43:58] people with the oath wherefore he put
[44:01] forth the end of the rod that was in his
[44:04] hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and
[44:07] put his hand to his mouth and his eyes
[44:09] were enlightened then answered one of
[44:12] the people and said thy father straitly
[44:15] charged the people with an old saying
[44:17] cursed be the man that eateth any food
[44:20] this day and the people were faint then
[44:24] said Jonathan my father hath troubled
[44:27] the land see I pray you how mine eyes
[44:31] have been enlightened because I tasted a
[44:35] little
[44:35] of this Honey verse 30 how much more it
[44:40] happily the people had eaten freely
[44:42] today of the spoil of their enemies
[44:45] which they found for have there not been
[44:48] now a much greater slaughter among the
[44:52] Philistines and they smote the
[44:54] Philistines that day from McMaster
[44:56] Agilent and the people were very faint
[44:58] and the people flew up on the spoil and
[45:01] took sheep and oxen and calves and slew
[45:05] them on the ground and the people did
[45:07] eat them with the blood then they told
[45:10] Saul saying behold the people sinned
[45:13] against the Lord in that they eat with
[45:16] the blood and he said you have
[45:18] transgressed roll a great stone unto me
[45:22] this day may God bless you bless the
[45:24] reading of the word as you're being
[45:26] seated just want to draw your attention
[45:29] on down in the scripture where Saul has
[45:37] spoken that whoever has interrupted or
[45:42] whatever has interrupted the plan of God
[45:45] or is standing before them in going up
[45:49] before the Philistines
[45:50] that their life shall be taken we find
[45:54] in the scripture that the law in in
[45:56] later in verses here that the lot fell
[45:58] into Jonathan but Jonathan was not
[46:00] preventing them from going up against
[46:02] the Philistines to further at Venge saul
[46:06] of the philistines but on the contrary
[46:09] the people when they went in verse 45
[46:11] the bible says that when the people when
[46:15] saul had spoke that surely jonathan
[46:18] should die the people says they said
[46:20] thus all shall Jonathan die who have
[46:23] brought this great salvation in Israel
[46:25] god forbid as the Lord liveth there
[46:29] shall not one hair of his head fall to
[46:32] the ground for he hath wrought with God
[46:35] this day so the people rescued Jonathan
[46:38] that he died not then Saul went up from
[46:41] following the Philistines and the
[46:43] Philistines went to their own place
[46:45] when we were looking at this and I want
[46:48] to just continue that thought on fasting
[46:50] instead of feasting this is a lot of it
[46:53] to where I just am just looking at this
[46:55] and there really the burden of my heart
[46:57] is more to teach this and to lay in the
[47:01] those things which we would know should
[47:06] know and if we don't know that God it
[47:10] would it would just be ministered to our
[47:12] hearts and even those things that we do
[47:14] know that our pure mind would be stirred
[47:17] up by way of remembrance because
[47:20] sometimes the simplest of things we can
[47:23] allow to become common to us and we can
[47:25] allow things to slip slip so easily but
[47:31] we need the help of the Lord and seeing
[47:33] the value of those things that God has
[47:37] desired for our life we find that Saul
[47:39] he has called a famine here in the mourn
[47:44] of Hammond but a fasting when the people
[47:47] of Israel should have been feasting on
[47:50] the things of God
[47:52] this was the Bible declares this was a
[47:55] time that the honey was dropping the
[47:57] honeycomb was there it all have been a
[48:00] time that the people were eating that
[48:02] which was in season and in that time but
[48:07] instead saw he called for a fast or
[48:11] withholding from eating and we see the
[48:14] results of this we see to where that the
[48:17] people themselves when it came time to
[48:20] move in after Jonathan and his
[48:22] armor-bearer had overthrown that
[48:24] garrison there with with that with the
[48:28] direction of the Holy Spirit the Lord
[48:29] that when they pursued after the
[48:32] Philistines they could only go to a
[48:35] certain distance because they didn't
[48:38] have the strength to pursue the
[48:41] Philistines all the way what Saul is
[48:43] asking here let's go up and can let's go
[48:46] after the Philistines let's pursue them
[48:49] more that wouldn't have not even been a
[48:51] question had the people been feeding and
[48:54] feasting instead of fasting if they had
[48:58] been feast
[48:59] there would have been no letting up on
[49:01] the pursuit after the Philistines and I
[49:05] believe it speaks very clearly in our
[49:07] life that there are many things that we
[49:10] can experience victory in our life but
[49:13] it's not enough just to see victory as
[49:17] it would come as it were here but
[49:20] victory is something that is to be a
[49:22] continual pursuit when the enemy is put
[49:26] in flight let's be up and going not just
[49:29] to let him go and then to gain ground
[49:31] again but we want to pursue to remove
[49:35] him from the holds that he would have so
[49:38] many times when victory is had within
[49:41] within Church or within a life and
[49:44] victory comes many times we can get to
[49:47] where we're resting in that victory
[49:49] instead of remembering that victory
[49:51] itself was a gaining of ground and we're
[49:54] going to have to fight to keep that
[49:56] ground you don't just get ground and
[49:59] then when relaxers they've got to be a
[50:00] fighting of ground and then we see the
[50:03] the people here they were in a state
[50:06] they were distressed they were faint
[50:09] there are conditions that were about
[50:11] their life they were weak and then when
[50:13] they moved in upon the spoil they were
[50:17] eating the spoil but they were eating it
[50:20] in the wrong way
[50:21] they weren't eating it in the right way
[50:24] and all of this is a result of where
[50:27] here saw calls for a a fasting in them
[50:31] time of war and I'll tell you God has
[50:35] clearly declared within his word that
[50:39] there was coming a time of war such as
[50:42] the world and never seen we're living in
[50:46] that hour Daniel 12 is a type of that
[50:49] warfare that's going on right now among
[50:53] and the attack upon the bride of Jesus
[50:56] Christ Psalms 27 speaks about even of
[51:01] how that we are a compass round about
[51:04] and how the enemy is is coming at us and
[51:07] in the Book of Revelations chapter 9 it
[51:10] speaks of the release
[51:12] of every demon spirit has been released
[51:16] here upon this earth that which was
[51:19] bound now is released and to think of
[51:23] this that what we're in in this time it
[51:25] is a battle that we are that we are
[51:28] engaged in but God does not allow the
[51:31] battle to come without making proper
[51:34] preparations for you and I to be able to
[51:37] enter into this battle and be ready for
[51:40] it
[51:41] God has made a way even as he would
[51:44] direct the prophet in this hour that he
[51:47] would would express that there was a
[51:50] need to lay up food or brother branham
[51:54] would use the word supplies in the
[51:56] storehouse now you need supplies in
[51:59] order to make food is that right you're
[52:02] gonna need with you no matter what dish
[52:03] it is you make you're gonna need
[52:05] supplies and me just say it to you like
[52:07] this the message that God has sent to us
[52:10] without the Holy Ghost it would be
[52:12] nothing but supplies but the Holy Ghost
[52:15] takes supplies and makes food out of the
[52:19] supplies it is that which then
[52:21] strengthens and is a nourishment and you
[52:24] and I are able to feed and be nourished
[52:27] on the things of God saw being a type we
[52:30] know how that the Prophet you know under
[52:32] the direction of the Holy Spirit would
[52:34] lay this down how Paul being or Saul
[52:37] rather being a type of like that of a
[52:39] denominational man or an organizational
[52:42] lead one who is not really under the
[52:45] leadership of the Holy Spirit and to see
[52:47] how Saul is holding them back from what
[52:50] they really need I'll tell you right now
[52:52] that's something I never want to be
[52:53] guilty of I won't have been one the
[52:56] other thing what I want to be is what
[52:58] God Himself as desired and what you and
[53:01] I have need of in this hour he knows
[53:04] every time that we're coming together
[53:06] he knows the very intense and desires of
[53:09] the heart he knows and he has supplied
[53:12] his word for this hour and the season I
[53:15] tell you like this it never ceases to
[53:17] amaze me it never becomes common to me
[53:20] to watch how that God will come on the
[53:23] scene and he will take you
[53:24] word and minister right to a question
[53:27] that's on somebody's heart you know I
[53:29] was even just kind of looking at it
[53:31] there even on Sunday morning when I was
[53:33] ministering on a little just to top that
[53:35] God had just dropped on my heart and
[53:37] said just go preach this thought and I
[53:39] looked at off of my you know how we
[53:42] gonna go with this you know but if the
[53:44] God moving down and how the Holy Spirit
[53:46] begin to take the word and here to find
[53:50] out then I'm receiving texts that are
[53:52] coming in from other people within that
[53:54] time that says you don't know it but you
[53:56] know my child was there in that service
[53:59] there on Sunday morning and word for
[54:02] word what they had spoke to another one
[54:04] of their friends word for word came out
[54:06] in that service they got their answer
[54:09] for what they had need of now who in the
[54:11] world could do that but God it takes God
[54:15] to come on the scene and to do that and
[54:17] you see God he operates by his word you
[54:21] know the Bible says is this day there
[54:23] would come a famine for the hearing of
[54:25] the word of God now in reality there's
[54:28] no shortage of Bibles there's no
[54:31] shortage of Bibles matter of fact if I
[54:33] if if I understand it correctly it's
[54:36] still one of the top sellers around the
[54:39] world or even in the nation so there's
[54:41] no lack for that of that of the Bibles
[54:44] but remember brother Branham would tell
[54:46] us he said that the Bible itself is not
[54:48] all together the gospel he said the
[54:52] gospel itself is the word that is
[54:55] preached in power and demonstration you
[54:59] see when we look at it we we just don't
[55:01] either famine that is going on it's not
[55:04] because people don't have access to the
[55:07] scriptures it is not because there's not
[55:09] individuals or people or ministers that
[55:12] are preaching or because that people are
[55:15] not reading but a famine that it's
[55:17] taking place remember the famine is
[55:19] linked to the hearing there will be a
[55:22] famine in the land for the hearing of
[55:25] the word of God and let me just say like
[55:27] this the Word of God is not a doctrine
[55:29] it's not a theory it's not an idea the
[55:33] Word of God is the person of Jesus
[55:36] Christ the whole ego
[55:38] is the lifeline of the church you cannot
[55:41] separate the word and the Holy Ghost
[55:45] it is the same self person Amen so
[55:49] that's why we need the Ministry of the
[55:52] word delivered by the unction of the
[55:54] Holy Ghost and this is exactly what Paul
[55:57] you know was mentioning even when Paul
[56:00] would write and he would admonish even
[56:03] those of Timothy and different ones to
[56:06] nourish up myself
[56:07] in the word and how do you know that
[56:10] that Timothy was to give himself and I I
[56:13] don't want to deal with that tonight but
[56:14] I want to just say it like this when
[56:17] we're looking at the some of the simple
[56:20] simple parts about our life I think of
[56:23] how David said it like this when David
[56:25] in Psalms 100 he said make a joyful
[56:28] noise unto the Lord all ye lands serve
[56:32] the Lord with gladness come before his
[56:34] presence was singing
[56:36] know ye that the Lord he is God it is he
[56:39] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[56:43] we are his people and the Sheep of his
[56:46] pasture there's a whole lot to be said
[56:49] within there but I think how how David
[56:52] is clearly giving it to you and I that
[56:55] we recognize that it is not us but it is
[56:58] God and here is very important we are
[57:01] the Sheep of his pasture amen enter into
[57:08] his gates with Thanksgiving and into his
[57:12] courts with praise be thankful unto Him
[57:16] and bless his name for the Lord is good
[57:20] his mercy is everlasting and his truth
[57:23] endureth to all generations now in the
[57:27] scripture here we find in in the book of
[57:30] Matthew chapter 16 where Jesus is
[57:33] speaking to the disciples within this
[57:35] time and he's asking them who do men say
[57:38] that I am and here you know they begin
[57:42] to answer but then Peter he speaks up
[57:44] and says thou art the Christ the Son of
[57:47] the Living God and Jesus
[57:49] answering to him and said blessed art
[57:51] thou simon barjona for flesh and blood
[57:54] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[57:57] father which is in heaven and I say also
[58:00] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[58:03] this rock I will build my church and the
[58:07] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[58:11] it and I will give unto thee the keys of
[58:13] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[58:15] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[58:18] in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
[58:20] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[58:23] now I want you to think of this here in
[58:25] the scripture here the Lord Jesus he
[58:28] introduces that indeed he is going to
[58:31] have a church and this church will he
[58:36] will call this church his home this
[58:40] church will be his church it will be a
[58:43] church that is made up of his substance
[58:47] just like it was when God took the bride
[58:51] right from the side of Adam and placed
[58:55] in that part and dividing masculine and
[58:58] feminine spirit and part of that our
[59:00] same original spirit was placed right
[59:03] there within that which we know to be
[59:06] woman or later called Eve and when it
[59:08] was brought before Adam he said this is
[59:10] bone in my bone flesh and my flesh and
[59:13] she eats was taken out of me she shall
[59:15] be called woman and he identifies who
[59:18] she is that she has come from him that
[59:21] is exactly how that God builds his
[59:24] church he builds his church with his own
[59:27] substance now I want you to think of
[59:31] this there's a lot when we take think of
[59:33] the word out of churches there's a lot
[59:35] of churches but there is one Church of
[59:39] the Living God
[59:40] there are many churches many out pulls
[59:43] but there's one true Church of the
[59:45] Living God as a matter of fact brother
[59:47] Branham would say like this he says
[59:49] there's one church where there's not one
[59:51] hypocrite and that is the Church of the
[59:55] Living God that we're not joined
[59:58] you can't join this church you are born
[1:00:01] into it by the Holy Ghost by one spirit
[1:00:05] we are baptized into one body so it is
[1:00:09] the very mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:00:12] that body ascended to the throne but now
[1:00:15] the Holy Ghost it begins to assemble
[1:00:18] that body upon the earth the attributes
[1:00:21] those thoughts of Gambas sons and
[1:00:23] daughters of God then it would reflect
[1:00:25] God's life and his desire through that
[1:00:28] one true church brother Brent says
[1:00:31] there's only one real church and you
[1:00:33] don't join it you're born in it if
[1:00:35] you're born in it the Living God works
[1:00:37] his self through you and making himself
[1:00:41] known that's where God dwells in his
[1:00:44] church now I want you to listen this God
[1:00:47] goes to church every day he just lives
[1:00:52] in church he lives in you you're his
[1:00:56] church you are his church you are the
[1:01:00] tabernacle that God dwells in you are
[1:01:03] the Church of the Living God yourself
[1:01:06] and if the Living God lives in his
[1:01:09] living being then your action is of God
[1:01:12] if it isn't then God isn't in there he
[1:01:16] wouldn't make you act like that when he
[1:01:18] says in the word here his blueprint
[1:01:20] don't do it and you go do it
[1:01:22] that's wrong when you deny it then the
[1:01:24] life then that shows the life isn't even
[1:01:26] in you so here when we recognize that
[1:01:29] this as as what we just read here is
[1:01:33] speaking of the Church of the Living God
[1:01:36] the mystical body of Jesus Christ this
[1:01:39] this in itself as it is speaking is
[1:01:43] those who are born of his spirit and
[1:01:45] because that that make up the true
[1:01:48] Church of the Living God and to think of
[1:01:50] this of how you know brother branham
[1:01:52] puts it like that God goes to church
[1:01:54] every day amen so if God goes to church
[1:01:58] what do you go to church you go to
[1:02:00] church to be lifted up you go to church
[1:02:04] to worship David said I will enter his
[1:02:07] gates with Thanksgiving
[1:02:11] no ma I will enter his courts with
[1:02:13] praise as as David said another place I
[1:02:16] was glad when they said unto me let us
[1:02:18] go under the house of the Lord so to
[1:02:22] think of a privilege here of what was a
[1:02:25] type in the Old Testament of the house
[1:02:28] of God that was set up within three
[1:02:30] courts which is a type of our life of
[1:02:34] body spirit and soul where God would
[1:02:37] dwell in the innermost part of our being
[1:02:40] in that of our soul through him by the
[1:02:43] Holy Ghost dwelling on the inside of
[1:02:45] there by the new birth now God reflects
[1:02:48] his life through us
[1:02:49] there is a warship that goes forth every
[1:02:54] day from our lives now I want you to
[1:02:58] think of this here because you
[1:03:00] understand that you know even where Paul
[1:03:03] would tell Timothy and first Timothy 4
[1:03:06] he would talk to Timothy about that
[1:03:09] there are doctrines of devils that are
[1:03:11] coming there's gonna be men that will be
[1:03:13] speaking lies in hypocrisy that means
[1:03:17] falsehoods there's gonna be doctrines of
[1:03:20] devils there's gonna be all kinds of
[1:03:22] seducing spirits but he's letting
[1:03:24] Timothy know that this is an onslaught
[1:03:27] that's coming on then from that there's
[1:03:30] going to be those you know forbidding to
[1:03:32] marry and all of these things commanding
[1:03:34] to eat meats things that would try to
[1:03:36] come to even upset the minds of the
[1:03:39] people but Paul tells Timothy that you
[1:03:42] need to give yourself to the Word of God
[1:03:44] and put the Brethren in remembrance of
[1:03:47] these things and thou shalt be a good
[1:03:49] minister nourished out in the things of
[1:03:52] God because you see God's desire in our
[1:03:56] lives he knows he knows that there is a
[1:03:59] desire that lays within our heart to be
[1:04:02] right there's a desire we want to please
[1:04:06] him when God has touched your heart in
[1:04:08] life you have a desire to please him and
[1:04:11] there is something about it that we find
[1:04:13] that as our desire to please him then
[1:04:17] God's favor is further unfolded where
[1:04:19] God will let you and I
[1:04:21] No how did we might please him how did
[1:04:25] we might serve him and to think of this
[1:04:28] but within this time of how God would
[1:04:31] want us to be established and to be at
[1:04:34] rest and with this of the word of the
[1:04:37] Living God dwelling in you and I because
[1:04:40] when we look at this quote getting back
[1:04:42] to this point now when we look at this
[1:04:44] quote you know this is one of the things
[1:04:46] a person could say well if I miss Church
[1:04:49] you know I am the Church of the Living
[1:04:51] God high in the house of God then why do
[1:04:54] I need to go to church but you see this
[1:04:59] is where you will realize that the word
[1:05:02] it remains true and faithful the spirit
[1:05:07] of truth will not deviate from the word
[1:05:10] the spirit of truth the Holy Ghost the
[1:05:14] person of Christ the word will always
[1:05:17] say amen to the word amen he will always
[1:05:20] stand behind that word and lift up the
[1:05:23] banner of the word so when we look at it
[1:05:27] and we see the example here of the Lord
[1:05:29] Jesus himself here was the very word
[1:05:32] made flesh in the tabernacle the body
[1:05:36] the tent that the Lord pitched and here
[1:05:39] he was the Bible declares him going to
[1:05:43] church in Luke 4:14 Jesus returned in
[1:05:48] the power of the spirit into Galilee and
[1:05:51] there went out of Fame of him throughout
[1:05:53] all the region round about and he taught
[1:05:55] in their synagogues being glorified of
[1:05:58] all and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:06:01] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:06:06] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:06:09] day and stood up for the reading
[1:06:12] you say what are you saying Jesus goes
[1:06:15] to church that's what I'm saying
[1:06:22] when the word was made flesh
[1:06:26] of the tights that was laying in the
[1:06:28] scripture but you see here is the
[1:06:31] display where the Lord Jesus himself as
[1:06:35] his custom you know what a custom is a
[1:06:37] custom is something you can count on it
[1:06:40] when it's the Sabbath day there's no
[1:06:43] question where Jesus is going to be no
[1:06:48] with me now we're talking about fans not
[1:06:51] fasting we don't want to fast when we
[1:06:53] ought to be feasting very simple
[1:06:58] principles of the word but it's things
[1:07:00] that the enemy wants to try to attack
[1:07:03] and erode a standard that is not a
[1:07:06] standard that the Prophet established
[1:07:09] this is a standard that God established
[1:07:12] and a true prophet will take that
[1:07:15] standard that's been trampled over and
[1:07:17] said this is steel dust saith the Lord
[1:07:22] that's what a true prophet of God does
[1:07:24] he's surrendered to the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:27] is able to hold that standard up now
[1:07:30] remember brother Branham went to collect
[1:07:32] a bill one day he was the line man that
[1:07:36] would collect a bill and he went you
[1:07:39] know collecting the utility bills and he
[1:07:41] goes and here he comes into a place and
[1:07:43] here's a woman you know she he comes to
[1:07:46] the door knocks and you know here she is
[1:07:49] going about listening to this music
[1:07:51] that's on the radio and you know here
[1:07:54] comes the announcer and he says
[1:07:56] something you know I be down there at
[1:07:58] this dance it set in such sets on
[1:08:00] Saturday night brother Graham said when
[1:08:02] she he said she was just going across
[1:08:04] that room he said she danced over there
[1:08:07] she picked up that bill she danced over
[1:08:09] there and she got her money and she
[1:08:12] danced around brother man says she
[1:08:14] looked back when that man made the
[1:08:15] decision or made the announcement on the
[1:08:17] radio she blew him a kiss I'll see you
[1:08:21] there on Saturday night honey and she
[1:08:23] came back and gave the bill you know why
[1:08:25] she didn't care that brother Randall was
[1:08:28] standing there she did not care she was
[1:08:32] so wrapped up in that music
[1:08:35] her heart was so in tune and so in love
[1:08:38] with that brother branham was saying
[1:08:40] like this he said I believe he said she
[1:08:44] pawned what clothes she had on to get
[1:08:47] there because brother man says you know
[1:08:49] he said she got the radio throat a kiss
[1:08:52] in the radio she said goodbye dearie
[1:08:54] I'll see you at the old briar patch
[1:08:56] everyone it was that night
[1:08:57] do you think mr. Michael Mitchell will
[1:09:00] ever have to make her sign a card to
[1:09:02] come over there talking about signing
[1:09:03] the card to come to church
[1:09:04] she'd pawn what clothes she had on to
[1:09:07] get there right for in her heart she
[1:09:10] couldn't live without it and I said you
[1:09:13] get that bunch of lukewarm church
[1:09:16] members down to the altar and let them
[1:09:19] pray through till the Holy Ghost since
[1:09:21] their soul afire they'll be no signing
[1:09:24] cards God's in their heart God goes to
[1:09:27] church
[1:09:28] he loves to us and I'm not going to
[1:09:33] update this quote and say God loves to
[1:09:35] stream
[1:09:36] I refuse to update that quote God loves
[1:09:42] to go to church
[1:09:45] god no live streaming you say now
[1:09:49] everybody's here tonight but if they're
[1:09:50] streaming they'll get it after all I've
[1:09:58] got to preach to those who come even on
[1:10:00] midweek come on somebody because many
[1:10:04] times what's happening the coldness and
[1:10:06] the lukewarmness among people midweek
[1:10:09] service is optional I'm gonna preach
[1:10:13] from the hell you can say out show me
[1:10:16] keep reaching it it is not option we are
[1:10:21] not a bunch of Roman Catholics that just
[1:10:24] gotta show up to some service and say
[1:10:27] when can I go to service this week
[1:10:29] brother we're coming here to worship
[1:10:31] we're coming here
[1:10:33] here from Almighty God and a fat woman
[1:10:39] would upon what she had on to get there
[1:10:43] you know I you know I should do that cuz
[1:10:46] it was in her heart you say it's in my
[1:10:48] heart then let your heart put your feet
[1:10:51] in action if what's in your heart don't
[1:10:56] come out in your life it ain't in your
[1:10:58] heart amen you tell me you got faith and
[1:11:03] I can't see your works I doubt you got
[1:11:06] faith now there is let me tell you
[1:11:12] something there's some genuine people
[1:11:14] that can't be here tonight all brother
[1:11:17] Sam you're putting lots on people they
[1:11:19] know who they are it's just like people
[1:11:22] through every surface know who they are
[1:11:27] full glory you see friends excuses are
[1:11:33] not going to add up people want God to
[1:11:38] do God things but they don't want to
[1:11:41] give themselves fully to God but you see
[1:11:45] we want to let this be a custom in our
[1:11:47] life now I don't want it to be just a
[1:11:49] tradition you understand what I'm saying
[1:11:51] I wanted to be a custom to wear that
[1:11:53] somebody knows hey it's Thursday
[1:11:56] I wonder what brother Sam you'll be at
[1:11:57] you think brother send me at the Mexican
[1:11:59] restaurant I know he likes Mexican food
[1:12:00] he like there ain't no question in your
[1:12:02] mind you say that's because you were
[1:12:05] pastor before I was a pastor or a
[1:12:08] minister of the gospel it was no
[1:12:10] question where I was going to be there's
[1:12:14] no question about it you say what do you
[1:12:17] saying I'm telling you that when you're
[1:12:19] able to be in the house of God you need
[1:12:22] to be in the house of God David said it
[1:12:26] like this in Psalms 116 and let me just
[1:12:29] he says in verse 12 what shall i render
[1:12:32] unto the Lord for all his benefits
[1:12:34] toward me how we'll take the cup of
[1:12:37] salvation and call upon the name of the
[1:12:39] Lord I will pay my thousand to the Lord
[1:12:42] now in the presence of all his people
[1:12:44] precious in the
[1:12:45] of the Lord is the death of his Saints
[1:12:48] Oh Lord
[1:12:49] truly I am thy servant I am thy servant
[1:12:52] and the son of thine handmaid thou has
[1:12:55] loosed my bonds how often to thee the
[1:12:57] sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call
[1:13:00] upon the name of the Lord I will pay my
[1:13:02] vows under the Lord now in the presence
[1:13:06] of all his people in the courts of the
[1:13:10] Lord's house in the midst of the O
[1:13:11] Jerusalem praise ye the Lord amen once
[1:13:19] again I'm not against streaming but my
[1:13:22] fear is that streaming has taken over
[1:13:25] people's desire to come to the house of
[1:13:28] God where it becomes optional on whether
[1:13:32] I can come tonight
[1:13:35] amen that's for everybody here and for
[1:13:38] all the streamers glory be to God my
[1:13:45] mouth just stay with me now tonight amen
[1:13:48] you see we're looking at the word to
[1:13:51] find things that the enemy would try to
[1:13:54] withhold or try to take away from us if
[1:13:57] there's a real need or a situation
[1:14:00] arises not something that's because of
[1:14:03] slothfulness not something because of
[1:14:06] well pray for my my doggie my dog he's
[1:14:08] got a to faith that you know of this and
[1:14:10] that and this and the other brother I'm
[1:14:12] telling you when the church doors are
[1:14:14] open we need to be in the house of God
[1:14:18] David said I will pay my vows you know
[1:14:21] what David's talking about he's talking
[1:14:24] about when I was in trouble when
[1:14:26] affliction and trials rose again means
[1:14:28] from psalm 66 when all these things came
[1:14:31] against me he says now he said I will be
[1:14:34] sure to go to the house of God and to
[1:14:37] pay the vows that I have made when I was
[1:14:40] in the midst of the test when I was in
[1:14:42] the midst of the trial where I my
[1:14:44] worship I said Lord just to deliver me
[1:14:46] lord give me strength to get through
[1:14:48] this test give me strength to get
[1:14:50] through this trial then I'll come to the
[1:14:53] house of God and say thank you Lord for
[1:14:55] strength
[1:14:56] thank you Lord you know it ain't easy
[1:15:00] when you're going through a test or
[1:15:02] trial even to come there's a lot of
[1:15:05] things that can set against you no doubt
[1:15:08] there's some setting here tonight that
[1:15:09] you've got all sorts of opposition
[1:15:12] that's against you you might have got
[1:15:14] things in the mail today or news that
[1:15:16] was delivered your way that would be
[1:15:19] news that you could have set it home you
[1:15:21] could have went in a corner you could
[1:15:23] have shut yourself away and the devil
[1:15:25] would have kept on pounding and beaten
[1:15:27] on you more but there's something about
[1:15:29] it I know as I look across this room
[1:15:31] right here that there's people in the
[1:15:34] midst of battle in the midst of war but
[1:15:36] you said I'm gonna go to the house of
[1:15:39] God
[1:15:39] I'm gonna offer a praise and sacrifice
[1:15:42] of face giving because he is worthy I'm
[1:15:48] gonna get my rod in the honeycomb I'm
[1:15:51] gonna put my rod in the honey and I'm
[1:15:54] gonna let my eyes be enlightened now
[1:16:01] look at this in 1st Thessalonians 2:13
[1:16:03] for this calls also think we God without
[1:16:07] ceasing because when you receive the
[1:16:10] Word of God which you heard of us you
[1:16:12] received it not as the word of men but
[1:16:14] as it is in truth the Word of God which
[1:16:17] effectually workers also in you that
[1:16:21] Billy there's a big difference how we
[1:16:24] received the word verse 14 for ye
[1:16:28] brethren became followers of the
[1:16:32] Churches of God which is in Judea are in
[1:16:36] Christ Jesus
[1:16:37] well I'm not going to follow no church
[1:16:39] you're gonna follow something I'm not
[1:16:43] gonna follow the church I'm following
[1:16:45] Jesus oh you sound like those little
[1:16:47] boys that Paul ran into that said how
[1:16:51] much Cephas I am of Paul
[1:16:53] I am Apollo's and some of them said I'm
[1:16:56] of Christ you know those that said I'm
[1:16:59] of Christ were the most dangerous ones
[1:17:02] out of all of them
[1:17:06] we are you're gonna be following
[1:17:09] something but notice you became
[1:17:14] followers of the Churches of God which
[1:17:18] are in Judea in Christ Jesus those
[1:17:22] identified by his presence come on
[1:17:26] somebody walking in the light of the
[1:17:30] hour
[1:17:31] amen the power of God present lives
[1:17:35] being delivered the Holy Ghost coming in
[1:17:38] among them and revealing his word and
[1:17:41] victory in the hearts and lives of the
[1:17:44] people yes sir
[1:17:46] notice you know look around what you
[1:17:48] know a familiar quote to us brother
[1:17:50] Branham wouldn't would admonish us
[1:17:53] everybody ought to have a home church
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:17:57] you ought to have a place he said that
[1:17:59] you just don't float from pillar to post
[1:18:01] and that right amen and I'm saying like
[1:18:07] this with people whose been in cycles
[1:18:10] they need to let the cycle breaker come
[1:18:12] and break cycles in their lives we're
[1:18:15] living in an hour friends where it's not
[1:18:18] just floating here and there and going
[1:18:20] from here and there God ain't confused
[1:18:24] you understand what I'm saying God ain't
[1:18:27] confused
[1:18:28] daddy changing his mind a man you've got
[1:18:34] to know where you belong
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:18:38] come on now
[1:18:40] oh my I'm not gonna preach on that but
[1:18:43] this is a real present reality and
[1:18:46] Radames talking about getting into that
[1:18:48] vision of that local assembly that God
[1:18:52] has there he picks this up in blind

[1:22:51] fasting you know sometimes that
[1:22:56] defeating and the eating itself is also
[1:22:59] what we do what we do you know I said
[1:23:06] this about a year ago and I had my boys
[1:23:11] out with me and we just had a time that
[1:23:13] we have together and I told him I said
[1:23:15] there's things coming up in your life
[1:23:17] decisions I didn't know well I didn't
[1:23:21] know what this year held for him that
[1:23:23] they're getting ready to embark into but
[1:23:25] I told them I said what your desire is
[1:23:28] is to be in the house of God so I said
[1:23:31] there's some things you need I have to
[1:23:33] take pretty seriously and not be slack
[1:23:36] concerning it you're going to have to
[1:23:38] make sure ask God to reveal to you what
[1:23:41] he has for your life I said there might
[1:23:44] be some times where something comes up
[1:23:46] and you may not you know be able to be
[1:23:49] in the house of God oh my that that like
[1:23:51] to kill them but I said you know there
[1:23:54] might be some of that I said but I'll
[1:23:55] tell you I said God put me in jobs that
[1:23:57] has a witness those jobs you should not
[1:24:00] have had off times to go to church I

[1:24:15] times a man I've got a mother-in-law and
[1:24:20] father-in-law I'm not here to give roses
[1:24:22] out to people tonight but we might as
[1:24:23] well give them a man they have worked
[1:24:26] they have labored within even in working
[1:24:29] third shift and taken their days off of
[1:24:31] work the days they have elected to take
[1:24:35] off work our days of church time they
[1:24:39] could have a longer weekend if they just
[1:24:42] work Thursday night they'd be off Friday
[1:24:45] Saturday and then they could go back on
[1:24:47] Sunday and they'd have a longer weekend
[1:24:52] but they want to be in the house of God
[1:24:58] now I know they're not the only one

[1:27:02] of you think it's a wonderful thing to
[1:27:03] be thoughtful you know when you've come
[1:27:06] to the house of God
[1:27:07] you're being thoughtful you're
[1:27:11] considering one another is that right if
[1:27:16] you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:18] you got a liquefier Amen you get a
[1:27:21] liquefies join with another liquify join
[1:27:24] with another liquify
[1:27:25] brother it creates a bank I'll take em
[1:27:32] so to even look at this I know it's
[1:27:35] heading right looking right across you
[1:27:37] all tonight to me it is a ministry back
[1:27:41] to me if brother Branham could stand
[1:27:44] there and say in the message he said
[1:27:46] mama what it is to see people who would
[1:27:49] want to stay for service and to come and
[1:27:54] to be in the service of the Lord because
[1:27:57] knowing we're all going through tests
[1:27:59] and trials it would have been easier for
[1:28:02] for some not to come here some to do
[1:28:05] this or that
[1:28:05] I think of brother Dave jr. even he
[1:28:07] leaves right out of here right after
[1:28:08] Thursday night service I'm able to get
[1:28:11] back and drop off this is daddy and
[1:28:12] mommy and then he then then brother
[1:28:14] brother Davis sister Shirley and then
[1:28:16] has to go right to work y'all with me
[1:28:20] now you observe brothers I mean you're
[1:28:23] putting people on the pedestals I'm just
[1:28:25] letting you know the kind of sacrifice
[1:28:26] that goes in here there's sometimes the
[1:28:30] sacrifice isn't where you've got to
[1:28:32] punch something in it's just something
[1:28:34] that you just have to say this will be
[1:28:36] here at the house when I get back if
[1:28:40] Donn didn't get the spaghetti noodles
[1:28:42] off the plate for you came to church
[1:28:43] soak it when you get home scrub it in if
[1:28:48] it don't come out then put some oxy in
[1:28:50] there with it and let it come off come
[1:28:53] on somebody you see sometimes the enemy
[1:28:55] just gives little things here and there
[1:28:59] and sometimes we've allowed him to gain
[1:29:02] ground when we ought to be here eaten
[1:29:05] honey provoke one another unto love and
[1:29:12] good works seen when different ones
[1:29:15] coming and sitting in the house of God
[1:29:17] and coming here even when they don't
[1:29:19] feel good such a sure the Kressel
[1:29:24] probably wearing me out after this but
[1:29:25] that's okay it's worth it
[1:29:27] she stood right here a couple weeks ago
[1:29:29] and I pray for her right here of the
[1:29:32] condition that she was dealing with
[1:29:33] within her body she didn't have even the
[1:29:37] strength to be able to stand she was
[1:29:40] weak within her body and in their head
[1:29:43] and and in her back her back was hurting
[1:29:46] her but you know what she said she said
[1:29:48] I wasn't gonna stay home I wanted to be
[1:29:51] in the house of God I'm telling you I
[1:29:57] don't know sister Shirley's maiden name
[1:29:58] but that ain't crest stalk brother that
[1:30:02] is DNA and stop from the Tree of Life
[1:30:04] of which I'm looking across this room
[1:30:07] that others that are DNA and stalk of
[1:30:10] the Tree of Life but there is something
[1:30:13] that is able to rise up with innocence
[1:30:15] say if I'm gonna be down anywhere let me
[1:30:18] be down in the house of God because I
[1:30:21] know when I'm in the house of God he
[1:30:23] will come and he will if Mia
[1:30:26] he will minister to my needs you say
[1:30:30] what are you doing you are going and
[1:30:32] taking up honey and you're pulling that
[1:30:35] honey in your mouth Oh Oh Lord that's
[1:30:39] just what I needed tonight
[1:30:40] Lord you know what I needed and you're
[1:30:43] pulling that and your eyes are being
[1:30:45] enlightened not forsaken
[1:30:53] the assembling of ourselves together as
[1:30:57] the manner of some is see this is not
[1:31:03] something that's new this was even it
[1:31:07] started in look this even started in as
[1:31:12] her only church kept going you read the
[1:31:15] first accounts of the early church the
[1:31:17] Bible tells us in the end of Luke also
[1:31:20] in Acts chapter two that they continued
[1:31:22] steadfastly daily in the temple breaking
[1:31:26] bread from house to house so eventually
[1:31:29] over time it was a roading away to where
[1:31:34] people begin not to see the value of
[1:31:38] coming to the house of God let me tell
[1:31:41] you something you know how your family
[1:31:43] sees the value that you place on come
[1:31:45] into the house of God be in the house of
[1:31:47] God when church is going on
[1:31:49] oh brother Samuel I'm gonna be a lot how
[1:31:52] can you be a lot when you're out there
[1:31:53] with them on Sunday instead of being in
[1:31:55] here in the house of God gonna get
[1:31:58] tacked tonight better let's get it out
[1:32:00] of get tired I'd rather be roasted
[1:32:02] tonight than in those flames later on
[1:32:04] come on friends brother man told us he
[1:32:08] said how do you win loved ones by you
[1:32:11] being loyal to what you believe let me
[1:32:15] tell you what was around our house we
[1:32:18] had family coming in though just where
[1:32:20] we hadn't seen them we didn't see him
[1:32:21] for both once a year you know things
[1:32:23] weren't easy to get money to travel up
[1:32:25] and bring gas to come from West Virginia
[1:32:27] up to Ohio a matter of fact they would
[1:32:29] buy a big old roll of baloney
[1:32:30] get it out on the car and just slice out
[1:32:32] to make sandwiches so they could eat it
[1:32:33] on the way up here but you know what mom
[1:32:35] and daddy did we had to drive clear to a
[1:32:37] church 45 minutes away in fact the thing
[1:32:40] was a little longer neck goes in country
[1:32:42] roads but you're not they did they left
[1:32:44] the key under the mat and they said when
[1:32:48] y'all get in we're going to be in church
[1:32:50] tonight but we'll see you after church
[1:32:57] hello everybody on the internet hello
[1:33:01] coming through a computer monitor near
[1:33:04] you glory not forsaking the assembling
[1:33:12] of ourselves together as the manner of
[1:33:14] some is my mouth that is some place that
[1:33:20] I don't want to be identified in the
[1:33:21] scripture I do not want to be known as
[1:33:25] one who forsakes to assemble himself
[1:33:27] together
[1:33:30] hallelujah but exhorting one another oh
[1:33:35] oh
[1:33:37] put a prairie question for me brother
[1:33:38] Samuel I got a better idea
[1:33:40] why don't you come and put the prayer
[1:33:41] request in yourself hello somebody whoa
[1:33:47] Gloria Mazda getting tied in here
[1:33:49] tonight
[1:33:50] Oh it'll get loose for sinners a moment
[1:33:53] but exhorting one another and so much
[1:33:56] more as you see the Day approaching
[1:34:01] think of this brother branham you know
[1:34:04] talking about how a person inside of
[1:34:06] Christ walking the position of a
[1:34:08] believer in Christ he says and your
[1:34:10] heart and mind becomes single on Christ
[1:34:12] Jesus that shows you have died to
[1:34:14] yourself and born again then just as
[1:34:17] surest church time comes around you just
[1:34:19] can't keep from coming to church you're
[1:34:23] just going to go if you have to hobble
[1:34:27] oh oh ha oh brother Samuel these pews oh
[1:34:36] these pews hurt so bad
[1:34:39] then why don't you tell the local
[1:34:41] steakhouse to get you a comfortable
[1:34:43] chair because they don't have
[1:34:45] comfortable chairs either come on
[1:34:49] somebody if you need a pinup bring a
[1:34:52] pillow hello somebody
[1:34:55] hey men Oh will this and end this and
[1:34:59] this and then can't you just see it's
[1:35:01] the enemy trying to get you're all
[1:35:03] bogged down with a lot of things to
[1:35:05] distract you from what the real thing
[1:35:08] yes I don't see anybody saying oh I'm
[1:35:15] gonna be able to eating breadsticks and
[1:35:16] salad and zip it this Cana all these
[1:35:19] chairs these chairs they just don't fit
[1:35:21] my legs right nobody complains about the
[1:35:23] seating you see what it is because it's
[1:35:30] the food they're there for when you come
[1:35:37] from the reason this isn't a furniture
[1:35:47] gallery we're not here to try to make
[1:35:49] your body comfortable we're here to get
[1:35:52] this body change get the soul safe and
[1:35:55] get out of here you know brother man
[1:36:06] told us he said about he said these
[1:36:08] churches nowadays he said you know he
[1:36:10] had there been all these gyms being
[1:36:12] built and everything like that brother
[1:36:14] BAM said you know it used to be people
[1:36:16] when they went to the house of God they
[1:36:19] didn't have to exercise because they got
[1:36:21] enough exercise inside a church whoo but
[1:36:29] I'm saying they got exercise to put p90x
[1:36:31] and all the other things to shame they
[1:36:34] got exercise they let go and letting God
[1:36:37] have his way you're just gonna go if you
[1:36:42] have to hobble that's all you're going
[1:36:44] to church because the spirit itself
[1:36:47] bears record of gathering together
[1:36:51] in Christ Jesus I'd better let you hold
[1:37:00] job better just let off because y'all
[1:37:02] won't be back here on Sunday then I'll
[1:37:04] have to wait and start back in on you
[1:37:06] the next year that means I ain't coming
[1:37:11] back you're just showing your colors
[1:37:13] you're just showing your colors come on
[1:37:17] somebody bill the banner would say like
[1:37:19] this you're talking about this
[1:37:21] commitment and promise every Easter and
[1:37:23] I'll be there in Christmas and I'll do
[1:37:25] this and do that and brother Branham
[1:37:27] says now here's what he made this
[1:37:28] statement in I will restore because
[1:37:32] Bestor the reason for that is because
[1:37:33] they're just church members and not born
[1:37:36] again that's the reason a man that's
[1:37:41] born of the Spirit of God that's the key
[1:37:44] loves to go to church better than he
[1:37:48] loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry
[1:37:51] now from the looks of us and I know
[1:37:53] pretty much of you all really good and
[1:37:56] y'all like he come on now but a man
[1:38:01] who's born of the Spirit of God loves to
[1:38:04] go to church better than he loves to eat
[1:38:06] his dinner when he's hungry the
[1:38:09] spiritual man on the inside has got to
[1:38:12] be fed if that man isn't fed he will die
[1:38:16] the outward man isn't fed he'll die
[1:38:20] the inward man he's got to be fed and he
[1:38:22] said Jesus told Satan in the debate it
[1:38:25] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:38:27] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:38:29] out of the mouth of God that's how man
[1:38:32] lives not by his bread alone but by the
[1:38:35] Word of God man lives his outward man
[1:38:38] lives by bread his inward man lives by
[1:38:41] the bread of God amen
[1:38:53] you know how they tell you just stop
[1:38:57] eating when you're fool when you're fool
[1:39:01] just stop
[1:39:04] but you know if you can just even before
[1:39:07] you reach that place he's little by
[1:39:09] little you eat a little bit then you eat
[1:39:12] a little bit of course you got to psych
[1:39:14] yourself out and tell you got for other
[1:39:17] stuff
[1:39:20] eventually what happens your stomach
[1:39:22] shrinks this is that big old plate used
[1:39:26] to be able to eat now you can't eat it
[1:39:29] no more you start having doggy bags and
[1:39:33] 2 gold boxes and everything else but if
[1:39:37] you put it on the opposite side you eat
[1:39:41] everything there and then you just keep
[1:39:44] on eating more by the time you get home
[1:39:47] you're like wow the Chips Ahoy look good
[1:39:49] then from the Chips Ahoy you think can't
[1:39:52] leave this also don't want them to get
[1:39:54] offended got to eat some chips and salsa
[1:39:56] I'm gonna do this got to eat some bread
[1:39:59] with jelly because I wouldn't want mom
[1:40:00] and they get offended after making that
[1:40:01] preserves then after a while eating and
[1:40:05] eating and eating like that you all know
[1:40:07] this it it don't take rocket science
[1:40:09] your stomach stretches you're able to
[1:40:13] handle more food oh anything that don't
[1:40:23] eat very much its stomach shrinks but
[1:40:26] the more that you eat the more it
[1:40:30] expands the Bible promised us in Malachi
[1:40:38] 4 that we were to be fat as calves in
[1:40:42] the store because there's one sure thing
[1:40:46] coming wins and everything else and
[1:40:49] tests and trials are going to come our
[1:40:50] way but there were two farmers and when
[1:40:54] they both had calves but one of those
[1:40:56] farmers you know he just let that cat
[1:40:58] feed any little thing and this and that
[1:41:00] but here was another one
[1:41:02] many kept throwing in that I've alpha he
[1:41:04] kept throwing in that straw he kept
[1:41:05] putting in that grain he was so focused
[1:41:08] on what was taking place and what was
[1:41:10] being fed when they turned those calves
[1:41:13] out in the spring after they had grown
[1:41:16] here come the winds that was blowing
[1:41:19] through those barn yards and that one
[1:41:21] then Italy literally been starved to
[1:41:24] death it was getting blown everywhere
[1:41:27] but the other one that had been cared
[1:41:29] for it had become one with what it was
[1:41:33] eating it begins to strengthen it and
[1:41:36] when the winds came you just kicked its
[1:41:39] heels up hey man
[1:41:41] why because it had become one and it
[1:41:45] gained it had grown from the word that
[1:41:48] was being fed on and that's the same way
[1:41:52] that God's desire for you and I in
[1:41:54] coming to the house of God he provides
[1:41:59] for you and I what we have need of we're
[1:42:03] not just coming here just together
[1:42:05] together like a social event this is not
[1:42:09] a lodge this is a place where God it's
[1:42:12] reserved that God comes down and meets
[1:42:15] with his people place where God comes
[1:42:19] and feeds his children that's how he
[1:42:22] leads you and I we don't want to forsake
[1:42:30] to assemble ourselves together let's
[1:42:32] just stop there tonight all sorts of
[1:42:36] things will come reasons pressures
[1:42:41] things can come but remember them to be
[1:42:46] something like this if I just leave you
[1:42:47] with a word tonight
[1:42:50] let coming to the house of God be a
[1:42:53] non-negotiable
[1:42:55] it's not negotiable whether we're going
[1:42:57] to the house of God tonight is that
[1:43:02] right you see and I'll say it like this
[1:43:05] for those of us who are parents and have
[1:43:08] children the emphasis that you place is
[1:43:13] what the children will take up and do so
[1:43:18] we don't just want to tell them sure let
[1:43:23] the importance and the value be placed
[1:43:26] on coming together and hearing from God
[1:43:31] don't you let the devil tell you that
[1:43:33] well if you're not there you won't be
[1:43:35] missed
[1:43:35] let me tell you something if you cannot
[1:43:37] be here and you and you're not here and
[1:43:39] you're not missed something's wrong with
[1:43:41] you out to me Jesus help me
[1:43:48] something's wrong with you it ought to
[1:43:50] be in the house of God we're all of a
[1:43:53] sudden somebody says hey souls are one
[1:43:55] here why because you are such a vital
[1:43:59] part of what's going on in every service
[1:44:05] I don't play nothing that's not what I'm
[1:44:08] talking about I think on Sunday you see
[1:44:12] how him how precious it is to have
[1:44:14] musicians it's a wonderful thing
[1:44:20] sometimes we we we can take it for
[1:44:23] granted but tonight let me just let's
[1:44:27] just let me just stop here
[1:44:32] let's not let that standard go down
[1:44:35] let's let that standard be raised if
[1:44:39] you've dropped it here and look there's
[1:44:41] there's all sorts of things it'll come
[1:44:42] it'll test that but this is what I want
[1:44:46] you to see see the value of it you know
[1:44:50] the value of it and you can also see the
[1:44:54] way Satan fight you and fights it Satan
[1:44:58] knows the value and that's why he would
[1:45:04] want to do everything he can to try to
[1:45:06] block you from that sister there's
[1:45:09] there's end if there's people I know I
[1:45:10] know you would too there's people that
[1:45:12] would give their teeth to be in these
[1:45:14] services that are not able to be here
[1:45:18] there's some that are homebound they're
[1:45:22] homebound they can't be here they they
[1:45:24] used to sit right here right among us
[1:45:26] faithfully and they can't be here
[1:45:30] anymore because their home back I see
[1:45:37] I want to let it be known whose side I'm
[1:45:39] on Jesus said this is where the
[1:45:43] scripture forsake not to assemble
[1:45:46] yourselves together that Scripture is
[1:45:47] directly collected where Jesus said he
[1:45:50] that will confess me before men I will
[1:45:52] confess him before my father you stand
[1:45:56] for me he said I stand for you amen
[1:46:01] oh my let us draw let us draw straight
[1:46:07] from the Lord amen amen
[1:46:10] God is safe a litany I'm not going to
[1:46:14] ask you if you love me I ask you that on
[1:46:15] Sunday but you know what when it gets in
[1:46:18] the heat in the battle amen
[1:46:20] we are we when it all comes down to it
[1:46:23] you know that God's desire my heart's
[1:46:26] desire is for us as an assembly if you
[1:46:31] feel something slipping a little bit say
[1:46:33] God help me a little order just reach
[1:46:36] down brother brems says me when you
[1:46:38] sense that but the Rebbe says you reach
[1:46:39] a hold and you get a hold of the buckle
[1:46:41] the belt that tightens all the armor
[1:46:44] together
[1:46:44] he said you reach and you get a hold of
[1:46:46] that buckle and tighten up the armor
[1:46:49] that brings it all together and the
[1:46:52] Hebrew series brother brems says when
[1:46:54] you feel things getting a little slack
[1:46:56] in your armor he said reach down and get
[1:46:58] a hold of that and say Lord give me a
[1:46:59] refilling of the Holy Ghost amen God is
[1:47:05] mindful of father

[1:47:34] but how much greater it could have been
[1:47:37] they won that victory because they were
