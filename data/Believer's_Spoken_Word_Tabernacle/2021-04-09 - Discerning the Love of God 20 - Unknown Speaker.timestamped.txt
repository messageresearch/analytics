[31:01] fill our hearts lord
[31:04] [Music]
[31:10] as well
[31:25] [Music]
[31:38] [Music]
[31:41] god bless you tonight let's turn in our
[31:43] bibles
[31:44] to first corinthians chapter 13 and
[31:48] certainly good to see amen each one of
[31:51] you that
[31:52] here this evening and
[31:55] just thank you for the prayers and
[31:59] as we as we were there in north carolina
[32:02] and i just so
[32:03] appreciate also i had a chance to tell
[32:06] brother nathan
[32:08] what uh what a masterpiece he placed
[32:10] here on sunday
[32:12] and um we just really just appreciate
[32:15] that so much
[32:17] and so i just i thank god for his mercy
[32:20] and uh we just want to look here in the
[32:22] word just a little bit more
[32:24] this evening and we certainly want him
[32:26] to lead us here
[32:29] in first corinthians 13 4 the scripture
[32:32] says
[32:33] charity suffereth long
[32:36] is kind the charity envieth not
[32:40] charity vaunteth not itself
[32:43] and is not puffed up and i want to
[32:47] also read that i don't know if i
[32:48] included that of the amplified but
[32:50] i want to just read that last part on is
[32:53] not puffed up
[32:54] it says it does not display
[32:57] itself hardly
[33:00] amen so may god bless you bless the
[33:03] reading of the word as you're being
[33:08] seated
[33:11] we know as we look at this and truly
[33:14] you know in each part of this and the
[33:16] scripture we could
[33:18] we could take many many parts
[33:21] upon this and we certainly just want to
[33:24] be mindful to what god has to speak to
[33:26] our hearts
[33:28] but when we look at this it's paul is
[33:31] letting it
[33:32] be known that charity itself is not
[33:35] is completely the opposite of pride
[33:38] and pride itself is something that we
[33:41] have seen it begins
[33:42] even within even within a person it can
[33:45] even start with a thought and start with
[33:47] a feeling
[33:48] and there's things that we know that we
[33:50] need the grace of god
[33:52] that everything about our life would
[33:55] stay in a place to where god
[33:57] can use us we know that that's something
[34:00] that
[34:00] god himself after god has come by way of
[34:04] the new birth
[34:05] god has entrusted that to our lives that
[34:08] we
[34:09] would humble ourselves god will not do
[34:12] that for us
[34:13] but that's something that we must do and
[34:16] so
[34:17] when we we look at this the scripture as
[34:19] it speaks concerning
[34:22] of the lord himself and just looking at
[34:24] at his nature
[34:26] it says in isaiah 57 15 for thus
[34:29] saith the high and lofty one that
[34:32] inhabiteth eternity
[34:34] whose name is holy i dwell
[34:37] in the high and holy place with him
[34:40] also that is of a contrite and humble
[34:44] spirit
[34:45] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[34:47] to revive
[34:48] the heart of the contrite ones
[34:51] in the scriptures when we look at this
[34:54] in second corinthians chapter eight and
[34:57] verse nine
[34:59] you know brother branham would take the
[35:01] example and he would pull it
[35:03] from even a story that he said i don't
[35:06] know if it's fictional or not but he
[35:08] would speak of it
[35:09] where that a king himself one day
[35:13] laid aside his kingly garments
[35:16] and he put on garments that would
[35:19] be as though he was a peasant and his
[35:23] subjects or those who were around him
[35:25] asked him and said what are you doing
[35:27] and he said i'm going to go down among
[35:30] my subjects
[35:31] that i might understand them better
[35:35] and to think that even in that whether
[35:38] it was a fictional narrative or whatever
[35:41] the reality of it is is that's exactly
[35:44] what god himself did
[35:47] in order to bring redemption to you and
[35:50] i
[35:51] as we were looking at that last week and
[35:53] you take that that term
[35:55] of humiliation and we know that the
[35:57] scriptures we even speak of that
[35:59] in acts chapter 7 but to think of how
[36:03] that god himself would come down and he
[36:05] would lay aside
[36:07] his kingly robes he would lay aside
[36:10] stepping out as brother brown would say
[36:11] out of the ivory
[36:13] palaces and he would come down and he
[36:15] would descend condense in
[36:17] to such a to such a measure in order to
[36:20] redeem
[36:21] you and i because he could not he could
[36:23] not
[36:24] do it as as jehovah's spirit but he had
[36:27] to come down
[36:28] and become kin folks he had to become
[36:31] kin folks with a man who was lost in
[36:34] order to redeem us
[36:36] to himself that's that's greatness
[36:38] that's real greatness
[36:40] that's real humility and the scripture
[36:42] how paul would pick this up
[36:44] he would say for you know the grace of
[36:47] our lord jesus christ that though
[36:49] he was rich yet for your sakes he became
[36:55] poor that through his poverty might be
[36:58] rich now to think of it here
[37:01] all the very fullness of the godhead
[37:04] bodily
[37:05] dwelled in him as far as riches
[37:08] uh that of this earth he was a very poor
[37:11] man the poorest of poor
[37:12] he didn't have even a place to lay his
[37:14] head a house to call his home
[37:16] as a matter of fact when he came down
[37:19] god would come down in such humility
[37:21] to where even at his birth god did not
[37:23] even provide the clothing that was
[37:26] needed
[37:26] but he came down into such a place to
[37:29] where they had to borrow
[37:30] as brother graham says a womb for him to
[37:32] be born in
[37:34] had to borrow a place and had to borrow
[37:36] a swaddling cloth that would
[37:38] go on the back of an oxen and and to
[37:40] think that god himself
[37:41] the greatest of all greats there's no
[37:44] one greater no one even close but
[37:47] god was going to make a way back for you
[37:49] and i
[37:50] and to show that pride itself is what
[37:53] had brought about this fall in the
[37:55] beginning to where
[37:56] what had taken place as we looked at in
[37:58] heaven and then it came down here on
[38:00] earth and how that
[38:02] one of god's subjects let down on the
[38:04] word
[38:05] and instead of just waiting on god to
[38:08] fulfill the word and say
[38:10] you know wait a minute here god promised
[38:13] here
[38:14] god made a word that he said that that
[38:17] there would be
[38:18] a multiply and replenish so i'm just
[38:20] going to wait on
[38:21] god to come and vindicate his word but
[38:24] instead
[38:25] here we see how that satan himself would
[38:28] take a promise
[38:29] and satan would inflate it or puff it up
[38:32] to a place of where this is of
[38:36] learning or great learning but god
[38:38] doesn't come according to
[38:40] great learning god comes in simplicity
[38:43] and god always comes to those lives and
[38:46] hearts that
[38:47] are just simply going to stand on his
[38:49] word and say lord
[38:51] i'm looking to you because remember god
[38:54] has entrusted the word to himself that
[38:57] god
[38:58] he'll bring his word to pass all we have
[39:00] to do
[39:01] is be waiting watching looking
[39:04] with expectation walking with him god
[39:08] never asked us to figure
[39:09] anything out he just said do you believe
[39:13] and that's the greatest compliment that
[39:15] we can ever give god
[39:16] as believers is just simply to believe
[39:20] what he has said and to find that how
[39:22] that here he comes the very
[39:25] the very uh god of glory and here
[39:28] the very the very fullness of the
[39:30] godhead is dwelling within him
[39:32] but he became poor he was rich
[39:36] but he became poor for our sakes
[39:39] that through his poverty we might be
[39:42] made
[39:43] rich i want you to think of this though
[39:45] he was a king
[39:47] yet he never put on any error about him
[39:50] that he was king
[39:52] he never put on any subtle display
[39:56] that i'm a king i'm somebody he
[40:00] never came out like that in any way as a
[40:03] matter of fact
[40:04] the way that he would so yield and so
[40:07] humble himself
[40:08] to the lord to to to the god of heaven
[40:11] to his father
[40:12] to think what would be displayed they
[40:14] would look upon him and say
[40:16] is this him is this is is this and they
[40:20] would marvel at what
[40:21] words the bible said they were
[40:23] astonished at his doctrine
[40:26] the bible said the common people heard
[40:28] him
[40:29] gladly to think that how god would so
[40:33] humble himself into such a such a manner
[40:37] that you know he never came in a manner
[40:40] to
[40:40] that would be displayed as though that
[40:43] i'm
[40:43] better than you but this is quite the
[40:47] contrary to what
[40:48] the pharisees who had the law who had
[40:52] the prophets who had the psalms and yet
[40:54] they themselves
[40:56] reading the writings knowing the
[40:58] writings
[40:59] could quote the verse before the verse
[41:01] after but yet they themselves were so
[41:04] inflated with themselves
[41:07] they were so inflated with the where
[41:10] remember they could look upon the man
[41:12] whose eyes were healed and say ah you
[41:14] were all together born in
[41:16] fornication do you teach us they had so
[41:19] so inflated themselves and yet that was
[41:23] not the true
[41:24] representation of the word
[41:28] but you see god himself came down in a
[41:31] real
[41:31] true display of that of the way that he
[41:34] had displayed himself
[41:36] in measure through the prophets the way
[41:38] that he had displayed himself
[41:40] through the psalms the trials and tests
[41:43] that was
[41:44] displayed or that would come forth in
[41:46] experiences in david's life
[41:48] he was there in the writings and noticed
[41:51] this
[41:52] all the way down through in the prophets
[41:55] in the psalms and
[41:56] all the law remember one thing never
[41:59] changed he said i'm god and i
[42:02] changed not it didn't matter what kind
[42:05] of
[42:06] a vesture he was wearing his nature
[42:09] was always the same
[42:12] so even when he laid aside because you
[42:15] know how it could be
[42:16] a person can take off certain garments
[42:19] certain
[42:20] let's just make it simple maybe certain
[42:22] name brand things that everybody would
[42:24] know
[42:24] boy those things cost a lot that purse
[42:26] cost a lot this cost a lot
[42:28] this cost a lot and through the
[42:30] menominee they might just have a
[42:32] knockoff that's off the black market
[42:33] just to feel good about it
[42:35] but you understand that here here is one
[42:37] that could take off
[42:39] kingly garments but you remember it's
[42:42] not enough just to take off kingly
[42:43] garments
[42:44] but it must be able to so humble itself
[42:47] to where everyone that is around would
[42:51] look
[42:51] right past him would not even
[42:54] recognize him this is the lord of glory
[42:58] almighty god who created who brought
[43:02] forth
[43:02] this earth the stars everything and here
[43:05] he was
[43:06] walking right among them he took upon
[43:08] the vesture
[43:10] of humility as we looked at last week it
[43:12] was that in the likeness of sinful flesh
[43:15] in that body of humiliation where he
[43:18] could experience
[43:20] suffering he could experience temptation
[43:22] he experienced sickness
[43:24] he experienced frustration in a body of
[43:27] humiliation
[43:29] he came in order to redeem him listen
[43:32] made in the likeness of sinful flesh
[43:34] that body aged when they looked at him
[43:36] here he was 33 years old they said thou
[43:39] art a man
[43:39] no more than 50 years old there was such
[43:42] an aging
[43:43] that had taken place upon that body but
[43:45] he came
[43:46] that way in order to redeem you and i
[43:50] and that he might understand you and i
[43:54] this is real humility this is
[43:57] real this is real charity as it would
[44:00] display itself let me just say it like
[44:03] this the
[44:04] garment of humiliation coming in the
[44:07] likeness of sinful flesh
[44:09] was only the beginning of humility
[44:14] it was only the beginning brother braham
[44:17] says it like this in total deliverance
[44:19] he said he was totally and completely
[44:22] a man but he chose
[44:26] to deliver his natural parts
[44:29] into the hands of the god who dwelled
[44:33] inside of him there was a choice you see
[44:36] it was not anything that was just
[44:37] that was made to be done it was a choice
[44:40] what you find
[44:41] remember man fell man put on free more
[44:44] agency
[44:45] redemption cannot come back or
[44:48] come without free mall agency
[44:52] god had to become kin folks with you and
[44:55] i
[44:55] god would so condescend there was a
[44:58] tabernacle
[44:59] a temple purpose for death that he might
[45:02] redeem us back
[45:04] to to back to himself but remember it
[45:07] could not be
[45:08] free from free moral agency
[45:11] he had to make choices
[45:15] because you and i have choices to make
[45:18] he never made a wrong choice we can't
[45:21] say that
[45:22] he was tempted without sin we can't say
[45:25] that
[45:26] but you see he had to be that because
[45:29] he's our high priest
[45:31] that stands on our behalf and we're
[45:34] identified in his life he is
[45:37] our perpetuation he is our advocate
[45:40] he is our all-in-all and we stand
[45:44] in him and he is our
[45:47] representative he clothed himself
[45:51] in the likeness of sinful flesh and yet
[45:54] as he said that was only the beginning
[45:56] he humbled himself
[45:59] to take the form of a servant
[46:06] that itself still was not the farthest
[46:11] but he would come to a place of humility
[46:15] that he would humble himself to death
[46:20] that in itself was not enough it would
[46:21] go even lower even
[46:23] the death of the cross but you find god
[46:27] condescending condescending it was not
[46:30] just enough to come with a garment
[46:32] of humiliation that was the beginning
[46:34] but he would humble himself
[46:36] humble himself humble himself humble
[46:38] himself to where
[46:40] even those that were around and even
[46:43] satan
[46:43] would watch him walking up the hill and
[46:46] the blood spots that started out small
[46:49] would grow and grow until there was one
[46:52] great big spot all upon his garment
[46:55] and satan would stand there and say that
[46:58] can't be the son of god
[47:00] that a son of god wouldn't put up with
[47:02] criticism
[47:03] a son of god wouldn't put up being
[47:05] called names but brother graham says
[47:07] a son of god will stand there and put
[47:10] up with it when he knows he's in the
[47:13] plan
[47:13] and purpose and will of god
[47:17] he was humbled to the will of god this
[47:20] is why
[47:21] this is what true greatness is
[47:26] he became in his greatness
[47:30] he brought himself down to where
[47:33] he wasn't a stuffed shirt these are
[47:36] terms
[47:37] brother branham would put it like this
[47:38] of what made him great
[47:41] he wanted a stuffed shirt he didn't look
[47:44] upon the woman
[47:45] who had you know six husbands and the
[47:48] one she was living with then
[47:49] was not her own he didn't look upon him
[47:51] and say oh i can't go around you
[47:53] you you you'll just you'll throw my
[47:55] reputation off
[47:57] but see he didn't come to try to be her
[48:00] buddy or to pat
[48:01] her lifestyle in the back but he had a
[48:03] heart for her life
[48:06] he condescended not to not to come and
[48:09] show
[48:10] that i'm better than you i'm a better
[48:11] class that god that's not god
[48:15] that's man that's man that's
[48:18] that's evil but god condescending not a
[48:21] stuffed shirt
[48:22] and i think our brother ram says rosella
[48:25] griffith he said
[48:26] when every hospital he said in chicago
[48:29] told her don't you come back
[48:30] we don't want you here she was turned
[48:33] out an alcoholic
[48:35] but how that god came down in a meeting
[48:38] and he set
[48:39] rosella griffith free when the rest had
[48:41] turned her out
[48:42] because they couldn't help her but jesus
[48:46] could help her
[48:47] and jesus didn't think he was too big
[48:50] that he could go down there
[48:52] and loosen the hold upon her life
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:56] i'm preaching to people tonight and
[48:58] myself included
[48:59] that i'm faithful that it wasn't too big
[49:02] to come down where i was at
[49:06] hallelujah i'm thankful that he didn't
[49:08] say oh i'll be too humiliated
[49:10] if i go down there and start dealing
[49:12] with samuel's life
[49:13] but i'm glad that he came down
[49:16] i'm glad he brought himself down
[49:20] to minister to my life
[49:23] it wasn't a stuffed shirt that's not a
[49:25] characteristic of jesus
[49:29] so matter of fact the publicans accused
[49:32] him and criticized him
[49:34] in luke 15 because he was
[49:38] here were sinners and he's receiving
[49:41] them
[49:42] come on they called him a wine bibber
[49:44] are you with me
[49:46] they had all of that but you see what it
[49:47] was they were stuffed
[49:49] shirts their their righteousness
[49:52] was putting other people down that's
[49:55] what pride does
[49:57] he goes around you gotta if you in order
[49:59] for that person to be righteous they
[50:00] gotta find somebody to tear down
[50:03] but you see jesus ain't in the business
[50:05] of tearing people down
[50:06] he's in the business of bringing a
[50:08] loosening of a hold a grip on their life
[50:11] and
[50:11] building them up in the power of his
[50:14] resurrection
[50:17] hallelujah oh my this is what
[50:21] makes him great to think that how that
[50:24] he will come in such a way think about
[50:27] it
[50:28] jesus he was with thousands
[50:31] there are times he was with 12.
[50:35] there are times he was with three and
[50:38] there's times he was with one
[50:41] jesus don't need a crowd to preach to
[50:44] him
[50:46] he's not a stuffed shirt he don't think
[50:48] that everybody well you know
[50:49] no he came he will always come this is
[50:52] what makes him great
[50:54] he'll come where there's a need
[50:57] and people invited he'll always do that
[51:01] i'm just referring to these places he
[51:04] can make himself
[51:06] simple i'm glad about that aren't you
[51:09] how does god make himself simple even
[51:11] yet here tonight
[51:13] because he'll come according to his word
[51:17] god does not ask for that we have to
[51:19] have great learning
[51:20] or great understanding as a matter of
[51:22] fact that that is that is
[51:24] self exaltation but god comes
[51:27] to his word when john the baptist stood
[51:31] there
[51:32] remember that day they could look and
[51:34] say oh the high places will be made
[51:37] plain and
[51:37] you know the low places will be exalted
[51:40] they
[51:40] they were looking to that that word but
[51:43] they had their own idea about it and
[51:45] they had
[51:46] so leaned upon that to they mist
[51:50] the actual manifestation of that
[51:53] was the ministry of john the baptist
[51:56] god was manifesting high places made low
[52:00] and low places exalted in the ministry
[52:04] of john the baptist and they miss that
[52:07] scripture
[52:07] being fulfilled oh my may god help us to
[52:11] have a mind that's simple
[52:13] may we be simple people that just simply
[52:16] say god
[52:17] i'm trusting in you that you come and
[52:20] you'll vindicate your word
[52:22] i'm looking to you this is a promised
[52:25] lord
[52:25] that you made and i'm gonna wait right
[52:28] here lord
[52:29] looking to you i'm gonna take your word
[52:31] that's molding me
[52:32] shaping me and preparing me for the
[52:35] moment that i can see that vindicated
[52:38] and move into it that's what the bride
[52:41] that's the secret in the blight
[52:42] of the bride of jesus christ she knows
[52:44] she cannot do it
[52:46] in herself it must be him and she's
[52:49] waiting on the word
[52:50] to be vindicated she's watching
[52:53] you see he would speak in such a manner
[52:56] he didn't
[52:57] stick his chest out you know as though
[52:59] he was
[53:00] somebody you you understand we're not
[53:04] ignorant here tonight
[53:05] you understand you've been around people
[53:07] that could be good people
[53:10] but there's just something about it
[53:11] there's an error about them when you get
[53:14] around them and i'm not talking about in
[53:15] the world i'm talking about i've been
[53:16] around it
[53:17] right right and it's just like this just
[53:19] it's just an air
[53:20] the way that they carry it's not just
[53:22] even how they would carry themselves
[53:24] when you when you when you could get
[53:25] around there's just something about it
[53:28] i don't know about you but i don't feel
[53:30] welcome in that
[53:31] in that place anybody know what i'm
[53:33] talking about
[53:34] you know it's like you start wondering
[53:36] man what do i step here do i step there
[53:38] or do it
[53:38] and it just becomes it becomes odd it
[53:41] becomes because
[53:42] that's not the atmosphere of a believer
[53:46] are you with me it's not an atmosphere
[53:48] we we want to be in an atmosphere and
[53:50] look
[53:50] let me just say it like this some might
[53:53] have a tendency
[53:55] toward that way while others have a
[53:57] tendency towards this way
[53:59] the thing that we always know is let us
[54:01] always
[54:02] recognize our weakness
[54:06] that's the way we can be honest with god
[54:08] and recognize our
[54:10] weakness and say god feel that with
[54:12] yourself
[54:14] and our strengths we don't want to
[54:16] handle our strength we say god
[54:18] you handle the strength also lord being
[54:21] aware
[54:21] taking account of ourselves so we see
[54:24] this and how
[54:26] it makes god what makes him so great
[54:28] because he's not a touch me not
[54:31] he's humble he's humble he was our
[54:34] example
[54:35] brother brown would say like this he
[54:37] says he come to show what god was i'm
[54:39] just going to refer to this
[54:41] anything that's high and haughty
[54:44] isn't god god is low and humble
[54:47] that's what made him god see something
[54:50] comes
[54:51] low not something that goes high god
[54:53] doesn't dwell in hierarchies he dwells
[54:55] in humility
[54:56] the way up is down humble yourself and
[54:59] you'll be exalted
[55:00] exalt yourself and you'll be humbled
[55:04] think of how in matthew 20 25 you see
[55:07] the lord jesus
[55:08] this was an example that was being lived
[55:11] out
[55:12] in in in a life that was here remember
[55:15] here he is in the vesture of
[55:18] of made in the likeness of sinful flesh
[55:22] but even in that vesture he did not
[55:25] then the nature itself remained the same
[55:30] he did not it was not something as we
[55:32] said to where
[55:33] he put on an heir about himself you know
[55:36] it's just like to give
[55:37] subtle clues like uh you need to be
[55:39] catering to me
[55:41] you need to be no not at all but here
[55:44] look at
[55:45] look how jesus as he speaks here to the
[55:48] disciples in matthew 20
[55:50] 25 but jesus called them unto him and
[55:53] said
[55:54] you know that the princes of the
[55:55] gentiles exercised dominion over them
[55:58] now there had been a discussion remember
[56:00] the sons of
[56:01] zebedee their mother had asked grant
[56:03] that one may sit on the right and one
[56:04] on the left so they're they're asking
[56:07] she's asking about position and jesus
[56:09] has told him said
[56:11] that that's already been granted i i
[56:13] can't do that
[56:14] that's already been given where before
[56:16] the foundation of the world that
[56:18] position
[56:19] so now when because of that's asked oh
[56:22] it's just
[56:23] stirred up a little bit of a of a
[56:24] contention
[56:26] and here here in the lord jesus he says
[56:28] the princes of the gentiles
[56:30] exercised dominion over them and they
[56:32] that are great
[56:33] exercise authority upon them think of
[56:37] the image that when nebuchadnezzar
[56:40] the dream that god gave him of the
[56:42] gentile kingdoms
[56:44] it does not start from the feet it
[56:45] starts from the head
[56:47] it starts with gold in the head and
[56:49] comes down to where it is now
[56:51] iron and clay mix through the toes
[56:54] such brittleness no stability
[56:58] nothing that's anchored but that's
[56:59] contrary to god
[57:01] god builds his image of his life
[57:05] in us by coming down to bring us
[57:08] into a place of a real foundation
[57:12] in him he descends in our life to
[57:16] build our lives up it's not something
[57:19] that we
[57:20] grow up overnight but we grow we grow
[57:23] in grace and knowledge we grow in the
[57:25] lord it's god
[57:26] maturing and moving in our life and
[57:29] maturing us now notice he says
[57:32] but it shall not be so among you he's
[57:35] letting them know
[57:36] this the way that the world is this
[57:39] should not be
[57:40] among you but whosoever
[57:43] will be great among you let him be your
[57:46] minister
[57:47] your servant and whosoever will be
[57:51] chief among you let him be your servant
[57:55] this is entirely contrary to that of the
[57:58] world
[58:00] notice he's displaying what true
[58:02] leadership
[58:03] is i i've said this because i see this
[58:08] i've said this
[58:08] over the years i see it scripturally a
[58:11] person cannot lead until they can be led
[58:14] and if they can't be led they can't lead
[58:17] you you'll see that principle you can
[58:20] see the principle many times it'll work
[58:22] out
[58:22] when a person can't be led because in
[58:25] order to be led
[58:26] you've got to be able to humble yourself
[58:29] you've got you've got to be able to do
[58:32] that you've got to be able to
[58:34] to look at that and and say god you lead
[58:36] me god you direct me now notice he says
[58:39] this is this is the example that's been
[58:42] set before him
[58:43] even as the son of man came not to be
[58:47] ministered unto but to minister
[58:50] to serve think of this he served the
[58:53] needs of those who were sick
[58:55] he served the needs he looked upon them
[58:57] saw they were hungry
[58:58] he served their needs he came not to be
[59:01] ministered to
[59:02] but to minister and to give his
[59:06] life a ransom for many
[59:11] when's the last time we ever thought
[59:12] about a great person coming around or
[59:15] maybe somebody coming in your company
[59:16] maybe one of the bigwigs are coming down
[59:18] my they get everything set or even maybe
[59:21] sometimes when we're
[59:22] having someone come over our house and
[59:24] maybe we get the coffee creamer they're
[59:25] alike and
[59:26] maybe the chocolates they like and or
[59:28] the apple pie they like you know trying
[59:30] to do things that you might know what
[59:31] because you have a
[59:32] thought about them coming i want you to
[59:35] understand this
[59:36] that god when he came as he
[59:39] came down his thoughts was not about
[59:42] what can they give
[59:43] me but he came and he came
[59:47] with a purpose and come to minister to
[59:50] them
[59:50] i come to serve their needs i
[59:53] come in order to give my life a ransom
[59:57] for them
[59:58] this is a god this is one of greatness
[1:00:01] who thought about
[1:00:02] our needs
[1:00:06] oh thank god for that he took the form
[1:00:08] of a servant here
[1:00:09] he humbled himself he took the form
[1:00:13] of a servant look at this in psalms 93 1
[1:00:17] the lord reigns
[1:00:19] he is clothed with majesty
[1:00:22] the lord is clothed with strength
[1:00:25] wherewith he has girded himself the
[1:00:28] world
[1:00:28] also has established that it cannot be
[1:00:31] moved
[1:00:33] now let's look here here's the lord of
[1:00:35] glory
[1:00:37] and how he rises from
[1:00:40] the passover there the last passover
[1:00:43] that he's going to eat with his
[1:00:44] disciples
[1:00:46] i want you to look at this verse of
[1:00:47] scripture here in john 13
[1:00:49] 3 jesus knowing
[1:00:52] that the father had given all things
[1:00:55] into his hands
[1:00:56] and that he was come from god and went
[1:00:58] to god
[1:01:00] this is not coincidence he knows
[1:01:05] he walked in a world of perfect faith
[1:01:08] he he knew that the father had given all
[1:01:12] things into his hands
[1:01:14] he has this this is not a knowledge here
[1:01:17] i can't get into that tonight
[1:01:18] but this is he's it's revealed to him
[1:01:21] it's so quick unto him and he knows that
[1:01:25] has he come from god and he's going back
[1:01:27] to god
[1:01:28] but look what this glorious revelation
[1:01:31] does when it's operating in his life
[1:01:35] he rises from supper and he laid aside
[1:01:39] his garments and took a towel
[1:01:43] and girded himself so
[1:01:46] revelation does not bring
[1:01:50] self-exaltation
[1:01:54] now there are things that god can reveal
[1:01:57] but then it's up to us to keep ourselves
[1:02:00] little
[1:02:02] but as we mentioned there's things that
[1:02:04] god knows
[1:02:05] we have limitations even in that and as
[1:02:08] paul said
[1:02:09] lest i should be exalted god knows
[1:02:12] just how to keep us in that place of
[1:02:16] weakness to where we're relying upon
[1:02:19] him i thank god for that i'm glad that
[1:02:23] god didn't say
[1:02:24] you know with that part of it samuel you
[1:02:25] oversee it but he did tell me
[1:02:27] humble myself and with all my heart
[1:02:29] that's what i want to do
[1:02:31] but i'm so thankful that god says samuel
[1:02:33] if i think you're getting a little bit
[1:02:35] i know how to humble you he's not
[1:02:39] beating us down and even with paul it
[1:02:41] wasn't that he could say
[1:02:42] well paul you're getting a little hottie
[1:02:44] no but he could see
[1:02:45] those things and god knowing here's a
[1:02:48] man that had the revelation of jesus
[1:02:50] christ
[1:02:51] he saw god in a greater measure than
[1:02:54] what peter had
[1:02:54] but yet he had to stand there and say
[1:02:57] lest i should be exalted
[1:03:00] god gave a messenger a messenger
[1:03:04] of satan to buffet me
[1:03:10] this to me is powerful he rose from
[1:03:13] supper
[1:03:14] and he laid aside his garments he took a
[1:03:16] towel he girded himself
[1:03:19] after that he poureth water into a basin
[1:03:22] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:03:25] to wipe them with the towel
[1:03:26] wherewith he was girded the lord of
[1:03:28] glory
[1:03:30] became if i could say it in this manner
[1:03:32] a foot washed blunky
[1:03:35] he became to the lowest take the lowest
[1:03:37] man in the house and jesus
[1:03:39] became the lowest man in the house
[1:03:43] he humbled himself to that place
[1:03:48] he was letting him know remember in this
[1:03:50] part where peter said
[1:03:52] no lord you're not going to wash my feet
[1:03:55] but jesus is letting him know this
[1:03:58] display of humility
[1:04:00] you don't understand it now but what i
[1:04:03] do
[1:04:04] unless i wash you you have no part with
[1:04:06] me
[1:04:07] but he says says he says but a man that
[1:04:10] is clean he's speaking of the new birth
[1:04:12] a man that is clean needeth not wash
[1:04:15] save his feet are you with me
[1:04:19] this is why we're out in the world you
[1:04:21] got to wash your feet
[1:04:22] you got to wash your hands i'm talking
[1:04:24] about your goings and your doings
[1:04:26] when they came into the tabernacle god
[1:04:28] had that of of their of running water
[1:04:30] and before they could wash it
[1:04:32] worship wash your feet wash your hands
[1:04:35] right there's got to be a continual
[1:04:38] washing of water by the word a cleansing
[1:04:41] nobody know what i'm talking about
[1:04:42] sometimes you leave work or you leave
[1:04:44] the store
[1:04:44] and you say lord yeah i mean my hands
[1:04:47] washed
[1:04:48] maybe there's things you hurt you didn't
[1:04:50] ask to hear but you're gonna wash your
[1:04:51] feet
[1:04:53] what you're a worshiper
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:04:57] and he let him know that the cleansing
[1:04:59] that i bring to you
[1:05:01] it is will be through my blood you will
[1:05:04] be
[1:05:04] loosed from your sins
[1:05:08] and i'll wash you this is greatness
[1:05:12] greatness to wear as we said here he was
[1:05:15] he was found in philippians 2
[1:05:16] 8 found in passion as a man
[1:05:20] he humbled himself
[1:05:26] i trust god who helped me to make this
[1:05:28] as these things have just
[1:05:29] rested on my heart for months he humbled
[1:05:32] himself this was not something
[1:05:34] that god did for him
[1:05:37] he had to do it he had to humble himself
[1:05:40] when they were trying to pull him
[1:05:42] to come to lazarus side
[1:05:45] he humbled himself to the will of the
[1:05:48] father and then became obedient
[1:05:51] unto bet unto death but notice not just
[1:05:54] death
[1:05:55] even the death of the cross as paul said
[1:05:59] regarding this in hebrews 12 2 that
[1:06:02] he for the joy that was set before him
[1:06:04] endured
[1:06:06] the cross despising the shame
[1:06:10] he knew what that was all about you see
[1:06:13] it was one thing to humble yourself to
[1:06:15] death
[1:06:16] that's a pretty big thing in itself but
[1:06:19] then
[1:06:19] to humble yourself even to the death
[1:06:22] of the cross knowing what it meant this
[1:06:25] is why when he was there
[1:06:27] in the garden of gethsemane think about
[1:06:29] this where the victory was won
[1:06:32] the victory wasn't won there at calvary
[1:06:35] the victory was won in the garden that's
[1:06:38] where the lamb
[1:06:40] overcame nevertheless not my will thy
[1:06:44] will be done
[1:06:46] he didn't pray that once he prayed it
[1:06:48] three times
[1:06:49] what was he showing that you and i would
[1:06:51] have times
[1:06:52] where to be wrestling with ourselves to
[1:06:55] obey the word
[1:06:57] are you with me i'm talking about even
[1:06:59] after you're converted
[1:07:00] you'll wrestle with yourself to obey the
[1:07:04] word
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:07] are you with me but he's a leader he's
[1:07:10] one as the prophet said he contended
[1:07:13] with himself who do you contend with
[1:07:16] yourself who's your worst enemy yourself
[1:07:21] he wrestled it out in the garden
[1:07:24] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:07:27] done
[1:07:30] oh my god ought to give courage and and
[1:07:32] and strength
[1:07:33] here he was the desire and it led him to
[1:07:36] a place
[1:07:37] of complete submission to where paul
[1:07:40] could write it like this
[1:07:41] in 2nd corinthians 13 4 for though he
[1:07:44] was
[1:07:44] crucified through weakness
[1:07:49] what happened in gethsemane complete
[1:07:51] weakness
[1:07:54] he had already spoke under inspiration
[1:07:58] according to the word
[1:07:59] destroy this temple and in three days
[1:08:02] i'll raise it back up
[1:08:04] he was standing on the word he knew the
[1:08:07] purpose
[1:08:08] that the father had given him to do are
[1:08:10] you hearing me tonight
[1:08:11] he knew that he was testifying even when
[1:08:14] he was walking with
[1:08:15] the disciples after many miracles he
[1:08:18] would speak to them
[1:08:19] signifying the death that he was going
[1:08:23] to die
[1:08:24] listen to me now he knew about all that
[1:08:27] but that in itself when it came time for
[1:08:30] the moment
[1:08:31] of that word to be fulfilled it required
[1:08:34] complete weakness what about the bride
[1:08:37] of jesus
[1:08:38] christ it's not weakness how you and i
[1:08:40] think about it
[1:08:41] weakness to god is where we just stand
[1:08:44] on his word
[1:08:46] it's not us with our thoughts about it's
[1:08:48] just god
[1:08:49] you said this in your word you said it
[1:08:52] and
[1:08:52] that's where i stand i say amen to that
[1:08:55] word
[1:08:58] hallelujah jesus there when he prayed in
[1:09:01] the garden you know what had happened he
[1:09:03] had come to such a place
[1:09:04] of such commitment to where he became
[1:09:07] obedient
[1:09:08] completely submissive
[1:09:12] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:09:18] so just kick that devil off your
[1:09:20] shoulder that wants to say oh
[1:09:22] you're stubborn your rebellion see look
[1:09:24] at you you're
[1:09:25] no i'm praying i'm wrestling it out i'm
[1:09:29] surrendering
[1:09:29] my will are you with me now
[1:09:33] we're not pretenders there's a battle
[1:09:36] that goes on but our desire that
[1:09:38] that pulsates beyond anything is lord i
[1:09:40] want to please you more than anything
[1:09:43] i want to please you more than i want to
[1:09:45] please myself
[1:09:48] notice therefore in isaiah 53 let me
[1:09:51] jump back to a promise this was a
[1:09:53] promise
[1:09:55] for though he was crucified through
[1:09:57] weakness yet he liveth by the power of
[1:09:59] god
[1:09:59] here's the promise isaiah 53 12 this was
[1:10:02] hundreds of years
[1:10:03] before he ever came therefore will i
[1:10:06] divide him a portion with the great
[1:10:08] because of his humility his humbling
[1:10:10] himself even to death the death of the
[1:10:11] cross
[1:10:12] he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:10:14] strong
[1:10:16] the little ones strong
[1:10:20] little ones strong little ones
[1:10:23] it's the hum ones who are willing to
[1:10:24] humble themselves that's the strong ones
[1:10:28] he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:10:30] strong because
[1:10:31] he has poured out his soul unto death
[1:10:35] he was numbered with the transgressors
[1:10:38] and he bear the sin of many
[1:10:40] and made intercession for the
[1:10:42] transgressors remember on the cross
[1:10:44] he didn't say my father my father he
[1:10:46] said my god my god
[1:10:47] he cried out as a sinner
[1:10:50] because he could not remain in his
[1:10:53] sonship
[1:10:54] and then make sinner's sons so he
[1:10:57] forsook
[1:10:58] his sonship and he cried out as a man
[1:11:01] that is lost my god
[1:11:03] my god why hast thou forsaken me but the
[1:11:06] great thing about it
[1:11:07] is is that he who was rich became
[1:11:10] poor that we who were poor might be made
[1:11:14] rich through his poverty
[1:11:16] now he can take sinners and make suns
[1:11:20] out of them
[1:11:24] hallelujah even in that moment he wasn't
[1:11:27] thinking about himself
[1:11:32] he saved others and he can't save
[1:11:34] himself temptation
[1:11:36] temptation what you're trying to do
[1:11:38] trying to anoint that flesh
[1:11:40] trying to get it drawn out in pride i
[1:11:42] show you who i am
[1:11:43] it's trying to get it and then the bible
[1:11:45] says how they hit him
[1:11:47] on the head prophesy tell us who hit you
[1:11:50] let me just tell you one thing you don't
[1:11:52] have one thing to prove
[1:11:54] to the devil
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:57] what do i do just keep living for god
[1:12:02] you don't have one thing to prove to
[1:12:04] that liar
[1:12:08] jesus now now let me jump ahead here he
[1:12:10] is he comes
[1:12:11] and appears to them after his
[1:12:13] resurrection and jesus came and spake to
[1:12:15] them saying
[1:12:16] all power is given unto me in heaven
[1:12:20] and in earth have been a conquering
[1:12:23] of all the realms he stood the mighty
[1:12:26] conqueror
[1:12:27] he had humbled himself and now god had
[1:12:30] raised him up
[1:12:34] and so why brother branham would you
[1:12:36] would speak about people want power but
[1:12:38] they really don't know what power is
[1:12:40] and the way up is always down
[1:12:45] let me move on let me just skip that one
[1:12:48] let me go here
[1:12:49] let's look into another promise isaiah
[1:12:52] 52 13
[1:12:54] behold my servant shall deal wisely
[1:12:57] prudently he shall be exalted and
[1:13:00] extolled and be very
[1:13:02] high psalm 89 27
[1:13:05] also i will make him my firstborn
[1:13:08] higher than the kings of the earth
[1:13:12] in in hebrews 1 4 now
[1:13:15] notice it was shifting from the promise
[1:13:18] to the fulfillment being made so much
[1:13:21] better than the angels
[1:13:23] as he hath by inheritance obtained a
[1:13:26] more
[1:13:27] excellent name than they and i want you
[1:13:28] to notice this
[1:13:30] there was the inheritance that he
[1:13:32] obtained
[1:13:33] there were promises he would be exalted
[1:13:37] he would be higher than than any of the
[1:13:40] other kings
[1:13:40] those were all promises promise i just
[1:13:43] read in isaiah 53
[1:13:44] but those promises required
[1:13:48] supreme weakness
[1:13:51] those promises were not just give me in
[1:13:54] other words
[1:13:55] this is just what it's going to be you
[1:13:57] don't got to do nothing it was a promise
[1:13:59] but in order for that promise to of
[1:14:02] exaltation to where god
[1:14:04] would lift him into that position it
[1:14:07] would come
[1:14:08] by complete humility
[1:14:12] if it was that for the groom it's the
[1:14:14] same for the bride
[1:14:17] complete humility complete weakness
[1:14:20] to the word so he obtained
[1:14:23] this inheritance that position how did
[1:14:26] he obtain it
[1:14:27] through complete humility he was tested
[1:14:30] just like you and i are
[1:14:33] as i said earlier the thing is is that
[1:14:36] he can say i never sinned and never
[1:14:39] failed
[1:14:41] you and i can't say that that's not an
[1:14:43] excuse it's just what we recognize is
[1:14:45] greater is he that's in me
[1:14:48] and he's teaching us he's molding us
[1:14:51] he's shaping us
[1:14:52] even the sting of where the correction
[1:14:55] or
[1:14:56] chastisement would come in our life
[1:14:58] you'd say oh god
[1:15:00] mold me and shape me knowing the test is
[1:15:02] going to come again
[1:15:03] if the test will be there but we say god
[1:15:06] build me for that moment
[1:15:10] wherefore god hath also highly exalted
[1:15:12] him and given him a name which is above
[1:15:15] every name
[1:15:18] the bible said in first peter 3 2 i'm
[1:15:20] just just moving through this
[1:15:22] who's gone into heaven and is on the
[1:15:25] right hand of god
[1:15:26] angels and authorities and powers being
[1:15:28] made
[1:15:29] subject unto him
[1:15:33] even though this was his position
[1:15:40] but that could not be obtained or
[1:15:43] come into without suffering
[1:15:47] the bible says in hebrews 5
[1:15:51] he learned obedience
[1:15:54] by the things he suffered
[1:15:59] he god actually so condescended to where
[1:16:04] god himself learned he experienced
[1:16:08] what it was for man to obey
[1:16:11] the word god experienced that
[1:16:15] god experienced that wrestling that
[1:16:17] struggle he experienced that
[1:16:19] friends listen we can be very honest
[1:16:22] there are some parts of the word oh my
[1:16:24] it's very easy
[1:16:26] there's things that god can speak and
[1:16:27] ask about oh amen
[1:16:29] but remember we've got to eat the whole
[1:16:31] lamb
[1:16:33] even the pertinence and everything and
[1:16:35] there's parts about it that even when it
[1:16:36] comes to preaching
[1:16:39] there's parts about it sometimes that
[1:16:41] even how god himself
[1:16:44] will come down and drop things and
[1:16:45] minister to our lives
[1:16:47] ministering just what we have needed
[1:16:52] oh god think of this hebrews 2 9
[1:16:57] we see jesus who was made a little lower
[1:16:59] with then the angels for the suffering
[1:17:01] of death crowned with glory
[1:17:04] and honor that he by the grace of god
[1:17:07] should taste
[1:17:07] debt for every man crowned with glory
[1:17:11] and honor
[1:17:12] that came after humility
[1:17:18] ram says you know he says god
[1:17:21] he could have brought to himself
[1:17:24] many men who had a lot of understanding
[1:17:26] he said but
[1:17:27] many of those things he said is that the
[1:17:30] men
[1:17:31] would start taking glory to themselves
[1:17:34] he said but
[1:17:35] god takes nothing and makes something
[1:17:38] out of it
[1:17:40] he says when you can become nothing in
[1:17:43] your own sight
[1:17:46] you're becoming something in god's sight
[1:17:48] then
[1:17:49] becoming nothing does not mean that
[1:17:52] you're
[1:17:52] looking down and running yourself down
[1:17:55] that's not
[1:17:56] what humility is humility is
[1:17:59] is simply recognizing what it is
[1:18:03] who you are and our need
[1:18:06] of him that god doesn't want me to
[1:18:10] try to put on something god just wants
[1:18:13] me to be
[1:18:14] honest with him that's what invites his
[1:18:17] presence you see
[1:18:19] the way up is down let me read just a
[1:18:21] couple places here think of jesus here
[1:18:23] he gives this
[1:18:25] example in matthew 23 verse 8
[1:18:29] but be he not called rabbi now he's
[1:18:31] dealing with what has been taken place
[1:18:33] out here
[1:18:34] among the pharisees and different ones
[1:18:37] but be ye not called rabbi for one is
[1:18:39] your master even christ
[1:18:40] and all ye are brethren and call no man
[1:18:43] your father upon the earth for one is
[1:18:45] your father which is in heaven
[1:18:47] neither be ye called masters for one is
[1:18:49] your master
[1:18:50] even christ so what's he telling us
[1:18:53] resist
[1:18:55] titles of exultation
[1:18:59] see they wanted those titles because it
[1:19:02] was something that
[1:19:04] it made them feel in a certain way and
[1:19:06] they wanted to display themselves
[1:19:07] remember
[1:19:08] remember they walked along in the
[1:19:10] markets with the longer tassels and
[1:19:12] their
[1:19:12] philanthropies if i said it right and
[1:19:15] man they made long prayers you know and
[1:19:17] i mean when they were called to pray
[1:19:19] over the prairie i mean when they they
[1:19:20] made long prayers you know
[1:19:23] you understand what i'm saying i mean
[1:19:24] they were just gonna they're letting
[1:19:26] everybody know
[1:19:28] jesus said you're doing all of that out
[1:19:31] of the pretense
[1:19:33] in other words to show off is that right
[1:19:37] that that's a boastfulness it's tied
[1:19:39] into pride but the sim the simplicity is
[1:19:41] jesus saying
[1:19:43] don't don't don't seek for those titles
[1:19:46] you're all brethren you're all brethren
[1:19:49] notice
[1:19:50] but he that's greatest among you shall
[1:19:52] be your servant
[1:19:53] this is a principle
[1:19:57] this is a principle of a church this is
[1:20:00] the principle
[1:20:01] look god sent his message to this
[1:20:03] generation
[1:20:04] and when god sent his message to this
[1:20:06] generation let me just tell you
[1:20:07] something
[1:20:08] the prophet when he was here i just say
[1:20:10] it like this it wasn't about him
[1:20:14] it wasn't about him as a matter of fact
[1:20:16] he got on different magazines he said it
[1:20:18] seems like he said the problem i've got
[1:20:20] with them
[1:20:20] is that they're trying to lift up the
[1:20:22] man instead of the god
[1:20:24] who's the one who's doing the work
[1:20:30] with himself you'll catch it in places
[1:20:32] here perhaps we'll share it in in other
[1:20:34] services but brother brown himself
[1:20:36] he would even speak of how that he
[1:20:38] himself would recognize
[1:20:40] how the ministry was advancing in the
[1:20:42] polls
[1:20:43] and he would say i must keep myself
[1:20:46] humble
[1:20:51] you know that requires a big man
[1:20:55] it requires a big person who's able to
[1:20:57] humble themselves
[1:21:01] it's easy for somebody to become
[1:21:05] but it it's it's against the grain
[1:21:08] of nature to go the other way
[1:21:12] but i'm thankful god has equipped us
[1:21:17] he that's greatest among you shall be
[1:21:19] your servant and whosoever shall exalt
[1:21:21] himself
[1:21:22] shall be a base and he that shall humble
[1:21:24] himself shall be
[1:21:26] exalted notice this in
[1:21:29] luke 14 7 i'm going to close
[1:21:32] what's jesus put this forth he puts
[1:21:34] forth a parable to those which were
[1:21:37] which were bidden when he marked how
[1:21:39] they should choose out the chief rooms
[1:21:41] saying unto them
[1:21:42] when thou art bidden of any man to a
[1:21:45] wedding
[1:21:46] sit not down in the highest room lest a
[1:21:49] more
[1:21:50] honorable man than thou be bidden of him
[1:21:53] and he that bade him that bad thee
[1:21:57] and him come and say to thee give this
[1:22:00] man place
[1:22:01] and thou begin with shame to take the
[1:22:04] lowest room
[1:22:05] but when thou art bitten go
[1:22:08] and sit down in the lowest room
[1:22:12] that when he that bad thee cometh he may
[1:22:15] say unto thee
[1:22:16] friend go up higher then thou shalt have
[1:22:19] worship
[1:22:20] in the presence of them that sit at meat
[1:22:22] with thee
[1:22:24] for whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[1:22:27] abased
[1:22:28] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[1:22:31] exalted
[1:22:34] self-exaltation is not of god
[1:22:38] to exalt oneself now let me just let's
[1:22:41] just
[1:22:42] i'm closing sometimes
[1:22:45] tendencies and so forth can can be
[1:22:48] right here among us can right be right
[1:22:50] here in our life
[1:22:52] sometimes you can feel pressure to to
[1:22:54] try to
[1:22:55] put yourself in a certain light or a
[1:22:57] certain way
[1:22:58] but just remember just remember this
[1:23:01] whether it's from young people
[1:23:02] to one ever more if you've got to put
[1:23:05] yourself in some way
[1:23:06] to be welcomed by somebody then that's
[1:23:10] not true
[1:23:12] god never put anything on he doesn't put
[1:23:16] nothing on
[1:23:17] to be welcomed by us he just simply
[1:23:20] is the same
[1:23:24] he just simply is the same
[1:23:27] and though sometimes we might feel this
[1:23:29] or feel that pressures can come friends
[1:23:31] pressures
[1:23:32] are real i know you know what i'm
[1:23:34] talking about
[1:23:35] pressures are real but just remember
[1:23:38] we're living
[1:23:39] for him every man riseth and fallen to
[1:23:43] his own master
[1:23:44] we are our rest is in him if we go
[1:23:48] to exalt ourself god will obey
[1:23:51] us because no man god will not accept
[1:23:54] the exaltation
[1:23:56] of any man because it's contrary to his
[1:23:59] nature
[1:24:00] it's contrary to the word so
[1:24:03] let's just continue to see how simple we
[1:24:06] can be
[1:24:08] see how simple as though like we come
[1:24:11] here to this
[1:24:12] to this place and you know here instead
[1:24:15] of rising and going to as he said
[1:24:16] to the highest seat see that whole whole
[1:24:19] example that he gave there in luke 14
[1:24:21] that's how he came he never took the
[1:24:24] highest seat
[1:24:25] made of no reputation he came to the
[1:24:27] lowest
[1:24:28] place but because he was willing
[1:24:32] to come to the lowest place then he's
[1:24:34] exalted
[1:24:36] to be a servant i could say this right
[1:24:39] here
[1:24:40] jesus was observant you believe that
[1:24:45] he's observant about our needs jesus was
[1:24:48] not one who just
[1:24:49] came and said hey i don't have time i'm
[1:24:51] here i just gotta
[1:24:53] you know i don't have time you're hungry
[1:24:55] well you know i'm sorry
[1:24:56] i'm here i just i'm here i've come i'm
[1:24:59] just here to pay the price for
[1:25:00] redemption
[1:25:01] i i can't be troubled with all those
[1:25:02] other things he came
[1:25:05] to minister so he had to take
[1:25:10] notice
[1:25:12] of all that was around him right let me
[1:25:15] tell you something friends
[1:25:17] real humility too is where our prayer
[1:25:20] time
[1:25:20] isn't all about us real humility is
[1:25:24] where
[1:25:25] everything is not all about us amen
[1:25:29] but it's to look on one another to look
[1:25:31] on the needs
[1:25:33] of one another to be mindful of that
[1:25:36] even as a body that we're placed here
[1:25:39] to serve and minister to the needs
[1:25:43] of the body of jesus christ we're here
[1:25:46] to serve
[1:25:46] god's purpose we're here to serve his
[1:25:50] will
[1:25:50] god help us i say god help me
[1:25:54] help me lord as brother brown would say
[1:25:57] keep those spirits away from us lord
[1:26:00] help us to recognize lord that our need
[1:26:03] of you and where you brought us from and
[1:26:05] who and where you've brought us to
[1:26:07] it's been you that's done that lord
[1:26:10] oh god how we need you lord jesus
[1:26:13] let's pray heavenly father
[1:26:16] lord we just we thank you lord this
[1:26:19] evening
[1:26:20] thank you dear god for your mercy
[1:26:24] lord even in the place i think of it
[1:26:29] that
[1:26:30] where you took on the garment
[1:26:33] of humiliation you kept
[1:26:37] humbling yourself took the form of a
[1:26:40] servant
[1:26:45] humbled yourself to death even the death
[1:26:49] of the cross
[1:26:51] you kept descending
[1:26:56] that was what the word called for
[1:26:59] was humility lord as you showed us
[1:27:03] tonight
[1:27:05] you knew the purpose you knew the
[1:27:07] journey you knew
[1:27:09] what you were purposed for
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:12] when it came time for that moment it
[1:27:15] required
[1:27:17] humility lord jesus i believe
[1:27:22] lord that's where it comes in our lives
[1:27:27] lord we see how you moved in our hearts
[1:27:30] lord
[1:27:32] your god you you brought a
[1:27:33] transformation in our life
[1:27:35] it started with a humbling dying to
[1:27:38] our self lord
[1:27:42] to humble ourselves lord to your word
[1:27:48] and lord that don't that don't stop
[1:27:52] that keeps going it's a humbling of
[1:27:54] ourselves lord
[1:27:56] moment after moment paul said i die
[1:27:59] daily
[1:28:01] it's a humbling of ourselves it's a
[1:28:03] humbling to your
[1:28:04] will it's a humbling to your word
[1:28:08] lord jesus help us
[1:28:11] lord i pray may we be mindful lord
[1:28:16] as your prophet would say it be
[1:28:18] conscious
[1:28:20] of how little we are
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:24] to make ourselves little
[1:28:28] it means lord simply just be ourselves
[1:28:30] just yield to you we don't have to be
[1:28:32] anybody
[1:28:35] we don't have to say everything the
[1:28:37] right way we don't have to
[1:28:39] well everybody's talking i've got to
[1:28:41] find the scripture to quote her i've got
[1:28:42] to find a
[1:28:43] i've got to find a quote to say no just
[1:28:47] just be in love with him
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:51] just be in love with him
[1:28:55] lord jesus help us lord
[1:28:58] your god it covers the lord expands
[1:29:02] all parts every life
[1:29:06] god help us help us to humble ourselves
[1:29:10] lord
[1:29:12] give us grace lord that we might humble
[1:29:14] ourselves
[1:29:16] we know that you'll not do it for us but
[1:29:18] we must do it
[1:29:21] even when paul would experience that
[1:29:24] buffeting
[1:29:27] that was not you humbling paul paul
[1:29:30] had to humble himself in that
[1:29:33] time that the power of christ
[1:29:38] might rest upon his life
[1:29:43] lord so we realize that real weakness
[1:29:45] it's not complaining
[1:29:47] it's healed it's standing
[1:29:51] on your word knowing that god you're
[1:29:54] you're in control help us lord
[1:29:59] may we always remember lord where you
[1:30:02] brought us from
