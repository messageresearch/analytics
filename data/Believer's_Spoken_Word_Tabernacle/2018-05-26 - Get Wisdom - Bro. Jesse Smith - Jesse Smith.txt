stand petite thank you Jesus I stand Rotimi for the great see now when he looks at me he sees those nail-scarred hands that bought my Liberty I stand every team and even at my best I am worried I have

that we can have the life that we have but he came to give us back the life that we had with him before aren't you grateful for that that's that's that's the heart of the gospel isn't it the heart of the gospel is not about doctrines but the heart of the gospel is about God himself coming down becoming one of us and redeeming his children back to himself amen what love and you look at that you know here in the service this morning we direct that right towards the young people but we're all young you know I used to hear different ones tell me you know that I still my body might be a certain age but I still feel 18 in my spirit now I just had to take that by theory I have heard but now I see younger women y'all know what I'm talking about there's things where you know you used to be able to just to walk outside and you could just start shooting baskets and the boys say dad let's go outside and I said let me think about it let me get my thoughts in order and once I get out there let me stretch a little bit and you don't know what you're gonna pull or but the Lord is so good so good my I tell you I just appreciate seeing each and every one of you and man the visitors have come god bless you brother Doug mr. Stacey I tell you it fit one now to order I'd come right down there right now and hug your neck buddy Nate and then in that I don't want to see the rest of y'all but I just tell you it just really really good amen good to see you good to see old friends and amen my goodness we appreciate the specials this morning don't we I'll tell you y'all sing like that again this morning he might start preaching I'll tell you what the Lord is so good you know it's I'll tell you what if serving the Lord is it's full of joy it's full of joy you know I used to I used to wonder as a young person what in what in the world did did they see sitting around talking what was it they seen in church you know you just you just went to church and and you went and you think man and you know back in those days you'd have the the meetings and you know they preach maybe two hours or something and then my dad would get up and I knew that's gonna be another half hour 45 minutes and I'd sit there and think my goodness man you know but you know what it was when you do when you when you don't see yourself and you don't know your part in it it's kind of hard to to really focus in on it but I'm telling you right now no matter how old you are how young you are you've got a part in this it's no mistake no mistake that you were born in a home in this hour where God had already taken a parent or parents and already birthed them by this word it's no mistake we're living in a time where it's so so close but what a privilege it is to be able to have a parent or parents or grandparents it's a privilege to not only be able to hear this word but in your heart if you can just look while the words coming forth and say Lord just make yourself more real to me and you watch the Bible says very clearly it says if we draw 9 to God he'll draw 9 to us you just start getting in your thoughts this morning and saying Lord just make yourself more real to me Lord and I'll tell you what God will come right on the scene he'll take the gift that he's put in brother Jesse's life and God will take that gift and operate it and and the way he operates it is because of based on our needs our needs really did take the way that this service will go the the man of God can study and he'll prepare by inspiration that's dropping but yet to put it all together it's gonna take God to come on the scene and God to minister to our lives and when you when you hear God minister in that way and you know brother Jesse don't know me he might know you but he don't know you he don't know the thoughts it's been going through your mind he don't know all those things but there's one here among us who knows all about it and that same one that talks to you in that way he's letting you know you've got a part and you know it's like when you look at a drama some of you may be had to do a play sometimes you know in school they have you in reading where you got a you have to read a part and you know how they put me out in italicized part they say read with enthusiasm you come across the kid and they say oh look dad's home no no no stop stop stop it says read with enthusiasm Oh what do you mean look dad's home see those little parts are in there to let you know how to read your part and there's only one that can really help us do our part and that's the one who ordained us in this part and he knows just exactly how to bring that expression out of your life God is so good he's so faithful in this generation in this moment in this time God is faithful and I'll tell you this right now the message that God sent in this hour it came for you it came for you brother brems said when he was caught up there he said in that consolation of angels he said I remember young people what he said concerning you see this message this word that God has given to us it's not a message for older people it's a message for all of his children you don't matter how young you are you might look at your stature and say how can I do anything but you let God take a hold in your life and you say Lord just have your way in me you do what you want to do in my life and you watch how God will move God does things that the mind itself cannot even conceive because it's not a natural way it's a supernatural God you're loving this morning I know I'm not the preacher this morning but the preachers here already but we want to just pool on the gift of God I want to say that I so appreciate brother Jesse as he's making his way on out he and sister Chris and they just have they just are bosom friends and I just really really love him and appreciate him and and I'm just grateful that brother Jesse was able to be here and take this service and brother Jesse's got a wonderful gift that God has placed within his life to be able to to reach and to minister to young as well as to old and we just want to pull on the gift of God I believe God has something for us you know and and I believe that with all my heart we want to just turn our attention fully to the word and and just so grateful for what God is doing in this time it's exactly right brother Nathanael that song that you sung today it's a time of joy it's a time of joy but the brem tells us and you know what this is not something you just have to read and know about it's something you experience but the brem says once a man has been born of the Spirit of God he said you've been tapped into a powerhouse of joy and that's the truth you've got joy even in a time when you should be down and you can't figure out down deep beneath the dark clouds and the despair I've got joy I've got joy because joy is not Joy's not happiness joy is there because a happy you can be in your emotions either way but there's joy down in your soul Oh glory be to God Amen well I'd better get out here we're gonna take the whole service for the Jessie we love you come on brother amen let's sing let's sing that I stand reading amen could you stand with me and we'll sing that again that course I stand redeemed I stand redeemed by the blood of the land I stand redeemed before the great I head and when he looks at me he sees [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's take our Bibles this morning by the grace of Lord it feels like Sunday but it's actually Saturday so we're grateful to be in the house of Lord this morning we just want to greet everyone the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see the Saints such familiar faces over the years we're so grateful for all the support from the Sheffield Saints this was the first message church I ever walked into so many years ago now it must been seventeen years ago by the grace of Lord so I'm so thankful to have started here and thankful for the fellowship of brother Samuel and the wisdom and the mentoring he's given me of course you know that's all by the Holy Spirit and but we're so grateful to be with you and we appreciate the assembly here in the Saints let's go to Matthew chapter 25 alright a title this morning I'd like to just speak on get wisdom I'd like to speak on that this morning get wisdom I believe it's supposed to be kinda like a youth service but hopefully we're all feeling young this morning by the grace of the Lord but do we so appreciate the desire to minister to the youth and to the youth out there may God bless you and trust the Holy Spirit will speak to you this morning by the grace of the Lord I know he will if you're hungry and thirsting because God never disappoints anyone who comes to the house of Lord hungered and thirsting for righteousness where the RAM said one time he said I never left Church disappointed and nor have I by the grace of the Lord because God is so real to us he's always revealing more of himself to us Matthew 25 like to start at verse 1 and we'll be reading two texts we'll go to proverbs 4 after this but I like to read Matthew 25 just 1 through 4 familiar a portion to us then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them verse four but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps let's go to proverbs chapter four like to read verses five six and seven proverbs 4 verses 5 6 & 7 if you're there say Amen verse 5 get wisdom that's my title this morning get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom he's got to say it twice aren't you glad the Holy Spirit repeats things so we don't miss it get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding that's just bow our heads in word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just making it to God so the Lord sees it Heavenly Father Lord we just bow our heads and reverence to you Lord we're grateful for this gathering this morning we're thankful for the home church here Lord God the Saints here in Sheffield and father we just pray a tremendous blessing upon them for opening up their doors to all the visitors Lord God and then their home church having special meetings Lord in this this time of the year such a wonderful time of the year Lord God to see life coming back Lord and warmth father and and all these wonderful blessings of this season and father we feel that also in our spiritual lives this season of our our lives Lord knowing that the coming of the Lord is soon dear God and father we're here to help make ourselves ready dear God we're here to get more wisdom Heavenly Father so I ask oh god by the grace of God Lord and you would speak by the Holy Ghost Oh God let me get out of your way Lord God and Lord you set apart from me you can do nothing so Lord I know I can do nothing Lord this morning I need you Lord if one person is to be helped Lord it would have to be you helping that individual so Lord I'm leaning upon you this morning Heavenly Father Lord may the Saints of God polled on the gift of God we know this is a spiritual transaction Lord God if they're willing to invest in polling and hunger and thirst Lord they shall be filled Oh God and so father help each one of us to be spiritual God and and Lord to receive all that you have for us Lord God and we will give you all the glory we'll give you all the praise and father we ask Oh God especially for the youth Oh God that that the youth would hear these words this morning Heavenly Father the words of life Lord God and may the Holy Ghost have preeminence and all that said and done Lord and we just give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you be in see the praise the Lord well again we're happy to be here by the grace of Lord and and you know I don't really agree bring greetings from my church because they didn't know I was coming because I just found out yesterday I think it was or was it day before and we're grateful to be here and brother Samuel said thanks for your sacrifice but it is no sacrifice to come here it is a blessing to come here I don't care if I worked all week or it was sick all week it would be a blessing to be with all of you so God knows how much we love all of you and and you know those all the encouragement you've given over the years brother ray you know I think - brother brother Richard and brother bill and brother herb you know I just appreciate all the encouragement over the years what a tremendous group you have here and I was telling brother way out of text you know this church is like a model Church that I want to model our church after because of the maturity here the love for the Lord here the dedication here it's really quite striking to see that and we just I just want to see more of that in Akron by the grace of the Lord so we're just grateful for your testimonies amen and keep up the great labor of love that you do praise the Lord so I want to look at this thought here and maybe I'll take an hour or maybe two hours we'll see how long you know I'll joke there you know I generally set a timer now to keep myself under control so that's the nice thing about this watch I can set timers and time myself and by the time I get started I got like 15 minutes left you know so but it isn't very handy you know even for preaching but especially at school you know when we have to be a certain time in place this thing is worth every cent you know to make sure I'm on time for school and I don't forget music and I don't forget PE and it's just a real help by the grace of the Lord so we're thankful to be with you let's look at this thought here this morning get wisdom it's kind of a combination of numerous messages the I felt like the Holy Spirit has given me over the past few months and I trusted to be a blessing to you I want to thank my wife for bringing all the six kids with her this we're with us this morning where's my wife well she's already out with the kids no no doubt about that but let's give her a round of applause appreciate my wife Amy she brought six kids but she's back in the seventh by God's grace so we're grateful the baby should be here any week now by God's grace but we're so thankful another arrow God has given to us and so we just want to sharpen that arrow and the Bible said it will be shot out at the gates of the enemy and helped tear down the kingdom of Satan somewhere amen so thank God for that so I like to look at this thought and I want to look at getting wisdom how many of the book of Proverbs you know I just started preaching on it I haven't ever preached on it really thoroughly until recently I think I've got 11 sermons on it so far but it's just been a tremendous book and you know the word wisdom has a few different thoughts about it but I just to define it in a few ways you might understand is his skillful living it's applying the word you know at the correct time because knowledge is just knowing the word knowing Hebrews 13:8 or you know Isaiah 53 verse 5 you know acts 2:38 wisdom in our knowledge is just knowing the Word of God but wisdom is actually taking that word and applying it at the right time of your life and it's in other words it's following the leadership of the Holy Spirit and so when you do this when you live with wisdom these are decisions you make like we'd say you'd make a wise decision and that's what wisdom is when you choose the right choice at the right time and so these decisions that you choose ultimately build your testimony or build your character because your character is the only thing you're taking with you is that right it's the only thing that we're taking with us is the care and the character is just the collection of wise decisions I remember when brother Richard taught that in Sunday school you remember that about 17 years ago I remember that he said it's your moral make up is what you said the character is you're more moral make up and you you know right and wrong you're choosing right over the wrong and so these decisions build your character and the Bible said wisdom builds her house so knowledge is like the materials you use to build a church here or reconstruct the church but wisdom is taking that those materials and constructing something beautiful and so if you search the scripture wisdom and knowledge go together throughout the entire Bible just like oil and wine you remember the the third seal brother ram labored on that he says he said you can run the concordance and oil and wine are always together in worship because they go together you can't have one without the other well that's how it is with wisdom and knowledge knowledge is just knowing the word why no the Bible says this I know the Bible commands that I know the Bible points us to this but wisdom is actually applying that to your life and then seeing the results of it because jesus said wisdom is justified of her children in other words wisdom is manifested by the results that it bears amen so in other words you know someone walked in wisdom when you see the fruits of their acts so many times wisdom doesn't have an immediate blessing upon it but give it a little while you've got give that seed of God a little time amen plant that seed leave it in the ground water that seed for a little while and watch the Sun go to take effect on that seed and pretty soon you're gonna find some wonderful godly fruit amen and then that fruit is then that's the effect so that's the results that's the evidence of the wise decision that God led you to make amen it's exactly right now another way you and I might understand the word wisdom is just the just saying this the perfect will of God that's the way I've just explained it at preaching our church wisdom is the perfect will of God the perfect decision the best decision God would have us make is the perfect will of God in other words walking in obedience to the Holy Ghost and now bringing it down to our text is the lifestyle of the wise virgin that's wisdom because she's called the wise virgin now virgin means she had no interactions with the world right no no flirting around and no interactions with the world she was completely she was free from that and member both were free from that the wise and the foolish were both free from those interactions with the world they weren't flirting with the world though the foolish were not neither were the wise but the wise had something that the foolish did it and that was the oil they knew they needed more oil they knew how much oil they needed amen the foolish were foolish about it they were not wise about it they thought well I only need a certain amount or I don't need you to take my lamp or uh-uh they they just didn't have the understanding that they might need more oil so they made no preparations to bringing enough oil and I don't know about you Church but I don't want it I just don't want a little bit of a ninety to last me five more years in the message like some people that fall away I don't want to fall away ten years down the road I want enough oil so that no matter when Jesus Christ comes I can shrimp my lamp make sure the fires burning and go out to meet him amen I'm not looking for a way out of the message because the message isn't me praise God I'm not looking for loopholes in the Bible where I don't have to do this I want to do God's will more than anything else I want to please God amen that's how we should all feel that's how any real Christian feels you know when the seals brother Branham was preaching and he was talking about how he couldn't prove brother brand was saying I can't prove my name is on the Lamb's Book of Life he said there's that you can't prove it and he says you know he said but one way you'll know for sure he says as soon as you see that word the person whose name is on the book of life can't wait for the moment to go do the will of God so that's one way that proves that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life when the word of God the book of life that we've been given when it flashes before you when the commandment is preached to you you receive it and you can't wait to fulfill it glory it's the wisdom of God and Jesus Christ Himself said I like in a wise man in Matthew 7:24 unto a man who builds his house upon a rock a man who hears the word and then go does the word a lot of people come to church and hear the word but how many do the word that's a different story right we've got to hear the word we've got to have circumcised ears but then we've got to remember that word as soon as we leave the parking lot as soon as we get home that eight this afternoon as we're fellowshipping or whoever you go you've got to remember that word you've got to let the Holy Spirit write that word upon the fleshly tables of your heart praise the Lord now let's look at the scripture here just a moment here let's go to proverbs chapter 1 since we're there in proverbs 4 I felt the Holy Spirit you know as I was preaching on the wisdom series just bring out some nice types here now if you know proverbs you know Solomon wrote this book and then there was at the end there some letters or chapters that were Hezekiah found and he placed in this book and then there's you know two kings at the end that agar and and and Lemuel that kind of placed this book and they complete this book and but it begins as a personal letter from solomon to his son and i thought this would be good for the young children for the young people because this is a let this starts out as a letter from a father to his son and 23 times in this book solomon says these words my son this is a this is a a desire from a father's heart for his children to listen to him he wants his children to hear what he's saying and he wants him to take not take it for granted but he wouldn't see he wants them to lay these words and and but the bible said even wrap them around your neck like a necklace let these words be always before your eyes don't look to other things but but just let my words of wisdom be placed before your eyes so this is the father's heartbeat to his son in chapter 1 verse 1 the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of knowledge I'm sorry understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity now the first time he says my son is in verse 8 remember there's 23 times in Heart Church I preach every time he said it and I enjoyed it a lot of times I was talking right to Malachi Somyot you get it a second time here tonight or maybe third or fourth or fifth time but we understand these things are true for daughters or sons but in verse eight my son here the instruction of thy father forsake not the law of thy mother now if you would and go to verse 20 and now Sullivan he gets allegorical or like a metaphor or he starts painting like a picture of what wisdom is like in verse 20 wisdom crying without so wisdom just doesn't stay all hidden you know and this perfect win of God is just not hidden away somewhere wisdom is trying to get its voice out she utters her voice in the streets she cry it in the cheap place of concourse in the opening of the gates in the city she utters her words saying how long you simple ones will you love simplicity and thus corners the light there scorning and fools hate knowledge turn at you I'm sorry turn you at my reproof so look at this wisdom is like a woman who goes out in the streets and she's crying who will listen to me is there anybody out there who wants to listen to me and so we see this wisdom here is symbolic of a woman heading out in the streets which is also a type of Acts chapter 2 praise God because look at the next verse at verse 23 turn you at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you does that sounded familiar to anybody it ought to be in Acts chapter 2 wisdom went out into the streets brother Branham so they jumped jumped out of windows and they went out to the streets the Bible said declaring the wonderful works of the Lord and three thousand people came to Lady wisdom and said we want wisdom and they buried him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ wisdom couldn't stay in the upper room thank God they were in the upper room but wisdom will send you out to declare the wonderful works of God in your home right on the job in your school wisdom we'll take you out it'll make you cry out do you want to come to church do you want to hear the word of God is there anybody that wants to hear God's Word Amen that's what wisdom does the church now this the wisdom would be like the church here the church has led the woman right the church she goes out and cries out I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh amen your sons and your daughters our prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men will see missions amen hallelujah and it was tight beautifully here in proverbs chapter one amen look at verse 25 but ye have said it not all my council and would none of my reproof doesn't that remind you of the latency in church age in revelation 3:18 jesus said take counsel from me to buy gold tried in the fire Amen Jesus wants to have a counsel Jesus wants to have a meeting Jesus wants to talk it over with all of us amen and we know that we know the story in Chapter one we know what happens we know they rejected what the majority people reject it and then the last part of the chapter there you know wisdom is is is mocking the sinners who rejected it oh god help us not to spurn mercy in this hour help us to really examine our lives are we really living wise lives well the man said checkup every hour are we doing that that's what we must do hallelujah now in in chapter 1 we see the invitation the invitation goes out now how many have received the invitation I have now proverbs 2 tells us how to get even more wisdom how many would be interested in that because remember no man can come to God except God draw him first they men it wasn't you seeking God it wasn't me seeking the message that was seeking me praise God I never would have found them on my own I didn't find God I wasn't the one searching God God was seeking my lost soul amen but he purchased my soul he sanctified my soul he saved my soul he filled my soul at the Holy Ghost amen he did it it's exactly right but chapter 2 tells us if we like more wisdom and this is what our young people and I think our older people can do to my son if thou wilt receive my words verse one and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thy heart to understanding here it is right here this is if you how many Mountain want more wisdom look at verse three yay if thou Christ after knowledge and lift this up thy voice for understanding you know how many times have we seen you know in our own lives we go to pray we're like lord I want more of you we're just so tired and we all go through it right I go through it we all go we all get burdened down by the cares of the world but here the wiz the book of wisdom is telling us we've really got to be convinced and concerned it's got to be more than just a casual asking of God we've got to mean business young people if you want to know God you've got to get down to business it's got it just can't be a casual asking and this was under the blood of bulls and goats cry after knowledge lift up your voice for understanding God I want to know your will for my life god I want to know I've got the Holy Ghost amen that's the kind of people we want to have in our church that's the kind of people us the kind of families we want to raise we're we're more concerned about the things of God than the things of the way because I can show you 10 million people that lifted up their voice for the Cavs last night but how many were lifting up their voice in God speak to my life speak to my family move upon our church in Sheffield at these special meetings we need the wisdom of God we need the understanding of the Holy Spirit this is what we should lift our voice for verse 4 if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures I've never went gold diggin I've never went silver diggin but I've seen videos on at school you need huge machinery you need explosives you need bombs the treasures are deep down in the earth amen in church if you want the treasures of God you got to go deep on your knees you've got to go deep down in prayer you've got to be more sincere it's going to take more than a casual 5-minute prayer it's going to take a little more than just you know reading one chapter a day now which that's good that's a good way to start but brother Ramson don't forget he said but after that you'll start reading more and more and your hunger more and more for God it can't be just a casual thing well I check this off I love to do this but this is not something just want to check off while I'm done for the day seeking the Lord then thou shalt understand now looking for spot then so what happened then after what after first you cry lift up your voice seek and search then thou shalt find answer then thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God so the Bible is for things and then it says then you find the fear of the Lord and the knowledge of God now how many are willing to go to that extreme praise the Lord when there's so many different apps and so many different things and different attractions and different voices out there and but the voice of lady wisdom is cry she's crying out in the streets saying I will pour out my spirit but you've got to come and you've got to come God's provided way it's got to be more than life glory verse 6 for the Lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he's a buckler to them that walk uprightly that reminds me when brother Brian talked about how every promise of God is like in a variety store the Bible said God lays up wisdom for the righteous and brother and said if your healing looks really high up there he said don't get discouraged he said just go get a ladder climb up that ladder of faith grab ahold of that because this is God's variety store he lets you in you've got access to that ladder you've got access through prayer if a promise looks too high say God give me a ladder let me climb Jacob's Ladder let me grab a hold of what belongs to me that you gave me hey man hallelujah he's striking Chapter three to certain detective chapter three here so chapter one she invites the Holy Ghost Church invites them to come out and be born again by the Holy Ghost then chapter two if you receive that invitation says this is how you get the fear of God this is how you get the understanding of God you've now got to do something into it right the Bible says that you if we want more of God we must draw nigh into God and then God will draw nigh unto you now chapter three looking at verse 13 happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding for the merchandise that is better than the merchandise of silver and gain there of then fine gold I'd have a hard time convincing a lot of church members of that today if you get wisdom it's better than a hundred thousand dollar paycheck or signing a contract will now make two hundred thousand a year actually wisdom is more valuable than that twenty-five I'm sorry twenty-five a hundred thousand or whatever two hundred fifty thousand contract the world would think Oh duh this is easy I'll take this twenty-two this quarter million I'll take this this contract is more valuable but God Word says just the wisdom has got of God is more valuable than that think about it with the wives versions when one's knocking trying to get in and Jesus will not let them in he said it's too late you weren't wise with the oil you weren't wise in your preparations what oh my could you imagine being on the inside and the rejoicing and then imagine what the sadness on the outside I could have got in that I had tsiyon was so close to that I was inches away from that the word of God's been delivered to us God sent us a prophet amen he gave us thus saith the Lord we should make every opportunity to get the wisdom of God amen and seek for lift up your voice for it search that secret search for it we should make every effort to gain the wisdom of God it's exactly right look at verse 15 I love this she's more precious than rubies rubies can rubies are some of the rarest gems of all I preached a little bit on that at the home church but you know based upon a gymnast or I'm sorry a gemst website or something like that I tried to take the most reliable website I could but rubies are more rare than diamonds and they're extremely valuable and the Bible says that she's more I'm sorry it's she's more precious wisdom is more precious than rubies and all things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto thee that's powerful I wonder how many young people here desire maybe a dad that loves them more a mother that would love them more for our teenagers I wonder how many are desired a good husband one day a godly wife how many of them boys desiring a godly wife someday boys desire no I want a good job someday or the sisters I want to do this someday we have all these desires I'm gonna have desires out there there are so many desires all we want to see this accomplished we want to see that accomplished but I hope my life you know produces this or that but the Bible said that wisdom is greater if you get wisdom it's greater than all the desires of your heart amen that's why wisdom has to be the desire of your heart amen knowing the perfect will of God that's more valuable than anything you could desire well I've always wanted a a Mustang brother Jes I've always just wanted a Mustang I've always just wanted that Corvallis always had that desire what's the Bible say all things you desire cannot be compared to wisdom the Bible later says in verse 18 she's a tree of life that's why it's more valuable because wisdom is life-giving I know I'm walking in the perfect will of God there can be nothing more valuable than that - no I have not transgressed God's command for my life amen I have done all that the Lord has asked me to do you know the Bible said that about David the Bible said David did everything the LORD commanded except for in the area of Uriah and Bathsheba other than that man what was he church he was a man after the heart of God and we should be a church after the heart of Christ amen is that right oh this is beautiful my the the scripture speaking to us today oh it's glorious now look here in chapter 4 why was our our text get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither inclined from the words of my mouth forsake or not and she shall preserve the loved her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom with all that getting get understanding there's a lot of getting I want to get this job I want to get this app I want to get this spouse I want to get this close I want to get you name it I want to get this I want to get that I want to get that but the Bible said with all you're getting but one thing we must get is wisdom Peter said over and over give all diligence he said it twice in 2nd Peter chapter 1 he of all diligence give all your effort to make your calling and election sure make sure everybody knows that you are elected amen you are chosen you're one of the chosen few you are a child of God lay everything else aside but give effort to make sure they know you're one of the you glory st. Paul was so humble and I find brother Brown the same way st. Paul was so humble he said in first Corinthians chapter 9 he said I've got to beat my body down and I've got to bring it under subjection that I'm not a castaway and if you look at anybody who would be saved in Paul's day well definitely Paul he was a missionary three great missionary trips miraculous miracle after miracle miracle after miracle church started after church sergeant you would think if anybody had any security it would be st. Paul but he realized that there's something there was sin laying in his members and he was humble enough to admit there's times and when I'm not walking the spirit and good and evil right there and the good that I wanted to do I don't do but he says not either do it it's not the soul it's not the CGT it's the sin that growth within me and I've got the daily crucify the lusts and the affections thereof and when I do that then I walk in the spirit then there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus uh-huh bori amen amen what a blessing the Word of God is I remember again remember brother BAM said the same thing he said I can't prove that my name's there he said God could use me as a tool for something else he never got harder you're prideful and said look how much better I am than all of you I'm a prophet I see visions I preach the seven seals he now you know he never exalted himself like that he was humble because he was an example to us and we should take that same example in fact I was preaching last week on how Jesus said he told the disciples you know the rich young ruler came and they said my goodness can anybody be saved and then Peter pipes up and says Lord he said we've left everything what do you have for us and he said you'll receive a hundredfold in this life both in this and the world to come and he said you will sit on the 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and brother ramen one to those quotes he mentions that and he says ma he said look at those Apple style judges he said now I don't want to do that he said I don't want to I don't need a big shot like he said I don't need a big place he said just let me sit at Jesus's feet for a thousand years now look we know brother Graham's gonna get something like that he's going to get some great reward but he wasn't in it for that he was in it because of the grace of Christ amen the level of Jesus the love of the Lord and he said I don't want none of that but yet we know and he would he crossed over he was high lifted up and he was the leader and enough to be judged by that and remember the leaders get judged more strictly than others so it's not a desirable thing but look how humble he is we know he will present us the later see abroad he will present us to Christ because Paul said in second Corinthians 11 that he would present them to Christ as a chaste virgin and the Prophet said that's a special promise to each church age messenger so their God chooses a man who doesn't really want to be there well you can let brothers owns a let brother happen and God brings up brother Branham he doesn't want to be there but God brings him up there because he's so humble because of the grace of God I'm not exhausting brother Branham do you understand I'm just saying that's what grace produces in our hearts it produces humility Who am I what have I done what can I do that compares to anything Jesus did I have nothing to show I love the humility of the Gods prophet amen now I just a better speed up here yeah there you go halfway done with my hour now remember wisdom I want to look a little more not in the scripture wisdom is an individual gift how we know that but also wisdom is the attribute for all Christians so every Christian has a measure of wisdom but there's some people that have an extra measure and it's the gift of God it's one of the nine gifts of the Spirit but Ram said the greatest of all gifts that's in the local body he says his wisdom he says is that right the next is knowledge how are you going to operate now it's when you haven't got wisdom to operate it if you don't haven't got no wisdom you can't operate the knowledge haven't gotten out you won't know how to have peace you've got the first things first not no evidence he said upon the Spirit of God she's talking about tongues tongues are not the evidence he said because wisdom is actually listening first a man and look at Ephesians 1:17 can we put it up there Ephesians 1:17 just so everybody can see it that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you how many how many want that to be you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him I can't think of a better duo than that wisdom and revelation wisdom I know what God wants done and revelation is unveiling of thus saith the Lord good amen I know how to take the knowledge and all this but God has also revealed himself to me he's taking the curtain away and things that I struggle it before I now see clearly I know what I'm looking at I'm looking at Christ I'm looking at the word hallelujah but now let's move to this year now you remembered also that the Bible said before wisdom is what the fear of the Lord and the Bible said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and brother Ram preaches this I can't think of the message right now I don't have the quote in front of me respect 61 yeah there it is but Ram said the fear of the Lord you must have reverence for God God demands respects and brother man brings it down to his life he said I fear my wife he said I fear my mother he said I fear he said I fear the mayor of Jeffersonville he said I fear my children I feel that I fear the church he said because I don't want to do anything that would cause them to stumble so when you've got the fear of God you Reverend Scott you know God is watching all your thoughts and every decision that you make and because of that you're careful how you treat your wife or your husband or your children or the mayor you get a chance to talk to the Sheffield mayor I don't know if you do or not but if you do you'll be a light in the witness you'll be careful how you act around them people should sense my there's something different about you because you've been with somebody greater than the mayor amen you've been with Christ amen I said brother and said about Elijah Elisha to hear a hab and all of his entourage because he'd been with somebody greater than a half it was God Almighty amen Lorie that's exactly right now the fear of the Lord the Bible said is the depart from evil so you know you fear God when you run from evil we were preaching at our Bible Club we do two Bible clubs one the Arrowhead the elementary went the middle school arrowheads on Thursday middle schools on Tuesday and we were teaching on how to use wisdom with the Internet and one of the boys got ahold of it you know one of the scriptures I mean we must have taught or read and he said one of my friends took his cell phone and tried to show me a dirty picture he said mr. Smith I took that phone and I threw it across the room and I said oh the wisdom of a child how many would say lord help me to have that kind of wisdom that's wisdom that was true fearing the Lord you see something that's offensive to the Holy Spirit and you depart from it instantly you don't hang around and see how long I can handle to cuss words will mean I can handle three will be backing into four I can handle five half-dressed people no you're supposed to run from it instantly praise God we're supposed to turn from the evil snare praise God for our bodies on the temple of the Lord amen that's right and the Bible said you're happier when you're fearing God all day long that joy brother Samuel is talking about that's when you'll be joyful because you know oh you know you're pleasing your Lord all the Lord kept me from this temptation the Lord kept me from that temptation my I'm having a great day I'm walking in the spirit I've got victory today praise the Lord Amen now wisdom comes down to this wisdom comes down to obedience to the Word of God because the Bible said that obedience is better than sacrifice remember with Saul Saul he was supposed to kill all the animals before Samuel got there and that's when Samuel brought out that wisdom that it's better to obey than to sacrifice right so wisdom is obedience for that specific situation that you're in and it's greater than sacrifice a lot of people will say this you know when it comes to church they'll say well if I just I'll skip Wednesday night and I'll just listen to it on Thursday and they don't get to it on Thursday Rogers skip Sunday morning or Sunday night I'll just skip that and I'll make up for later see that what they're trying to make a sacrifice rather than obey the Word of God well I can't pay my ties this week all right then next week I'll just give a little extra offering and next week's comes and the Bible says like holes in your pockets all the money's found all of your pockets because you know by God the first time Oh hallelujah it's exactly right wisdom is obeying and it's greater than sacrifice now church we need to learn I think we can learn from the most from the wisest person in the Bible outside of Christ who was that Solomon but RAM says Solomon had a gift of you knew it he had a gift of wisdom and discernment brother Branham said Solomon literally saw God twice our prophet saw him three times Solomon seen him twice God revealed himself unto Solomon and Solomon started off his kingdom in a mighty way huh me know that how many have you how many have seen that though people start out in the message really full go really on fire really going good but pretty soon the cares of the world start getting them down that's how Solomon was he started out on fire with this gift of wisdom it was the oddest time it was a like a honeymoon time for Israel the Golden Age it started out because he honored the gift of wisdom but you know the Bible said it came to pass when he was old in 1st Kings 11 for that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord is God as was the heart of David his father for Solomon went after Astra the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abominations of the am writes and Solomon did evil maasai Lord and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father then did Salman look now look look how far sin takes him sin will always take you farther than you want to go a little compromise once you compromise on that the next things a little bit easier to get into and the man who built the greatest earthly tabernacle at least that I'm aware of to God the same man who built the greatest earthly temple for God he now he starts building temples for all the other gods can you imagine that and Solomon did even sigh Lord and went not flee after the Lord then verse 7 then he built a high place for Chima the abomination of Moab in a hill that's before Jerusalem and for Moloch and the abomination of children of Ammon and likewise did he for all his strange one it's not that he just built one building for his gods it was one for every God of all his wives the wisest man did the consumers never agree with brother Branham on that the wisest man outside of Christ time started working on the devil started working him over time pretty soon he compromised for one wife and then now he's got to compromise for another oh we don't want that compromising spirit in here we're gonna stand year after year after year if we got a say in decade after decade after decade we know will not compromise on God's holy word can you imagine walking in Jerusalem at the beginning of Simon's reign you know seven years after he built the temple there is my lorries come back a few late years later and right beside that is Moloch and asteroth his temple like how in the world how did that slip past Solomon how did that slip past the man went to get the wisdom it's because he gave his heart to his wives and his wives turned his heart away from obeying the Word of God does every understand that and look at verse 9 was God happy with this no and the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice I just can't even wrap my mind or I just want to see God one time in a vision I haven't I just want to see him one time but Solomon seen him twice seen God Almighty twice and still decided to build these Tabernacles that proves it doesn't matter how many experiences you have you've got to have a daily experience hey I appreciate experiences times when I felt the presence of God or times God has healed people I prayed for but that does nothing about today today I've got to follow Christ today I've got to build Christ in my life and not build things for the world I must invest in Christ today a phrase the Lord and then you read the book of Ecclesiastes I haven't preached on this book but in that book Solomon goes through these five W's he tried everything he tried women and that didn't satisfy him young people a person won't satisfy you maybe there'll be a blessing to you my wife's a tremendous blessing to me I hope I'm a tremendous blessing to her but that's not the ultimate satisfaction he tried women then he tried wine the Bible said that if you read the cleese yesyes then he tried wealth he acquired more money than everybody else and then he cried then he tried wisdom just earthly wisdom all the books and memory he studied so much he got tired and then the thing he tried was works he tried rebuilding cities and building things he thought all these things would satisfy and all those five W's didn't satisfy because there's only one that satisfies and that's the word of God amen Cory the Living Word of God for today and young people you can try any of those things and I tried some of those things before I was saved and they never satisfied I always was empty but then Christ came to fill me amen and God knows this on my heart there's nothing more I'd rather do than preach God's Word it is the greatest thrill of my life to preach God's Word and to feed God's sheep the food of God that they need if you could ask me what would you do to go to Game seven of the finals of the Super Bowl or would you be present itíd States I'd say let me do one thing let me preach the people who are hungry to hears the Word of God amen then we'll see heaven come down to earth amen hallelujah it is the greatest privilege of our lives to serve the Lord Jesus Christ programs and Satan's wisdom was seen in Genesis 3 he said wisdom as Satan was presenting to her said you shall not surely die see it's trying to make the Word of God say something that isn't so he said that's what wisdom is today oh brother how they how we tarry on that the seminary schools of theology that's they're very nests that's their grassroots is trying to make God's Word say something that it doesn't so anytime the Word of God says something and Satan says oh it doesn't do that nothing bad will happen to you you know you know that you you can compromise a little bit that is the wisdom of Satan the wisdom of God will tell you keep the Word of God now let me go in this thought here this is the middle thought I want to hit just before I close but the close may be but a little bit further so don't get caught up on that word clothes we're still open for business right now but go to numbers 19 if you had numbers 19 this is a thought I just want to bring out it's when I preached repeatedly at our at our church and I preached that brother Tim Humes and brother Brooks his church there's two churches out there in Iowa now praise God one in Iowa City and one in Des Moines and preaching at both churches there and God did it was just a wonderful thing there but numbers 19 you know Solomon's heart got turned away glory it got turned away by lusts and then it was at that moment as soon as he did that it's almost as if his spiritual life died and he stopped growing he stopped drawing closer to the Lord where did it start it started in his home whichever wife it was out of the thousand I don't know which one started it but that's filthy I don't know which one it was but one of them in the house convinced him let's build this you know it's just for my dad when he comes to visit you know when you're in law just for the in-laws no we'll just get a TV for the in love what's your social drink you know at the restaurant you know because it's dark there nobody will see us it's okay we'll just wear shorts when it's when it's really hot at see your point we won't wear them any other time just a Cedar Point we'll let the kids wear swimsuits you know just the kalahari is that that's close to here right that's pretty close to here or whatever it is I forget Kalahari there's another one what is it is it Kalahari okay I know there was another one you know they just start off and it starts we'll just make that decision and it starts the death actually starts in the home that's where it started for Solomon now it's interesting church is that in numbers 19 it's the laws of purification for sin it's the waters of separation how many are familiar with this I hope you are if not you're I think you really like this here by God's grace it was a real blessing to me remember the waters of separation was for every every believer and it was it was so important the Bible tells us plainly that if you didn't get sprinkle by the waters of separation you were cut off from the church and it didn't matter if you were a stranger you just came into the message or if you were actually someone already in the message already part of Israel it didn't matter if you touch something dead or something died in your house you were unclean that's what the scripture says and I want to just make a few things here remember how the Bible said when they would kill the red heifer they would have to take the blood and they'd catch the blood and then have to go down to the tabernacle and after sprinkle at seven times I remember that and brother Ram said there's blood for every church age so as Ephesus Smyrna pirate ear of Pergamos right Philadelphia Sardis and then there was blood for Laodicea glory the blood of Jesus Christ has been sprinkled in heaven for this generation bearishness and it's the same blood that was there for Ephesus amen the same blood that forgave Paul the same of blood that redeemed Peter after all of his mistakes that same blood is for you and I today amen hallelujah it's the same blood and it's for everyone it's for whether there's a stranger because look at verse 10 numbers 19 10 if you can pull it up and either gather with the ashes in the heifer cell wash his clothes and be unclean until the even it shall be under the children of Israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them every Jewish believer was under this law of the waters of separation no matter if you just started the church yesterday or if you've been the church your whole life everyone had to be cleansed this way there was no excuses if you didn't get sprinkled you were cut off no matter how much of a faithful church member you were because there's one way for cleansing and that is through the blood how many understand that go to verse 13 numbers 19 13 I'll just read over there whosoever touches the dead body of any man that's dead and purified not himself defiles the tabernacle Lord and that soul should be cut off from Israel because the water separation was not sprinkled upon him he should be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him go to verse 20 verse 20 says very much the same thing here but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he's the file the sanctuary of the Lord the water separation has not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean right isn't that striking church and I wondered for so long how can people come to church and be so happy in Jesus and just give them a few months and then act like they don't even care about the preaching they would cry for the cross they would thank God for the cross and weep and cry but give them a month or two or maybe six months or a year and pretty soon they they don't really get excited about the word anymore and I always wanted that for years how can this happen how does this happen but the Bible tells us this in verse 14 a 3:14 Numbers 1914 this is the law when a man diet in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days look at verse 15 and every open vessel which has no covering bound upon it is unclean now don't let me lose you here stay with me ever take a deep breath can really do that refresh yourself I don't want to lose you at 50 minutes into the sermon here I just got a little bit more to go if you bear with me here but listen everybody had a tact no matter how long you've been the message if something died in your tent you were unclean and everything that was open was exposed to the the evil that that death every open vessel was unclean and it was your job as the father of the house to take you and your whole family and even your tent and your you that they would come to you with the sprinkling and they would sprinkle this blood of this waters of separation on you and then you had to wait seven day or three days you had to take a bath after three days and they come back the seventh day and then they say you're clean on the seventh day but what if you didn't do that what if you didn't go to church and confess your faults to the people you sinned against they could cut you off pretty soon praise the Lord and I think that's one thing that shows a real maturity of Christians were most mature when we can confess and confront sin I found that the most mature Christians and I know our people who can talk about their mistakes and go to that person one on one and do exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 18 because it's so easy for us to talk about it with somebody else or talk about it on Facebook rather than talk about it to the person individually right is that right so something dies in your home and all everything's death we've got to get right with God a church listen if they didn't get right with God right away they couldn't even go and worship at the church the priest would keep them out of something died it's your house it was reported last week you can't get in here and so they go back to their tent well when are we gonna do this water separation well I don't know I'm too busy I gotta work tomorrow the big games tonight how can I go to the waters of separation how can I do that I mean I've got this I'm gonna take care of all these things okay and so they would sit out service after service and they wouldn't enjoy how the priest would make sacrifices the people bring their sacrifices it would go up they'd be forgiven and the priest would go in the whole Easter place and one day year then the high priest would go in the holiest of Holies but they were physically kept out of the glory of that worship and so people today are kept out spiritually of the glory of the worship when they fail to get cleansed by the waters of separation Peter says that the waters he said your sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ he said unto obedience so when you confess and say I'm wrong forgive me when you do that the Bible says you get sprinkled with an anointing Lord when you finally obey the Word of God and confess you're wrong and say you're sorry and really mean it it's spiritually a waters of separation has sprinkled upon you and now you're clean and now you can get somewhere with God they would physically be kept out of the tabernacle because something physically died in their homes but today it's so much more deceptive because now they could come to church and sit in the tabernacle or come to the altar and if they're they don't confess their sins they get no closer to God the Bible calls it grieving the Holy Spirit in Ephesians 4:30 now think about this church every open vessel in the tent was exposed to the death how many got little children at home got a lot of open vessels in your home those children are just going to soak in whatever you say whatever you watch whatever you do they're just going to soak in everything that you do but if something dies if there's something dead if there's a sin that's laying in your home it will affect them as well I think as parents we can all say amen to that if I make a mistake it may rub off on my children if I make a mistake it may rub off on my wife we've got to limit our mistakes we've got to purge the sin we've got the purge that's dead stuff because it makes everything open in our house ever it makes everything dirty and it makes it unclean so that means TV's and movies and bad websites pervert the house right any compromise on the Word of God will affect the house so now we see what happened to Solomon can we all see what happened to Solomon one little compromise in this house caused death in this house and then it spread to the entire kingdom oh my you see it all the time people all just make a little exception for I just want to watch this movie it's just the kids movie and those are some of the raunchiest nastiest movies there are you understand I know because I got 20 of them in my class that tell me all about the movies I'm like I don't want to hear about that dirty jokes and all kinds of evil all kinds of perversion coming from Disney or whatever moved Pixar movies whatever they are b/c it's because they're exposed to death in the 10th oh my god help us Church now I wanted to say this here one thing that we must be careful of is our unconfessed sin the Prophet said your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it let me know that ache and his brother Brandon is an example from the Bible Aitken hid this things in his house where's always go back to the house he hid the Babylonian garment the wedge he hid it in his house and because of that it caused the church to lose innocent lives and we're responsible humming oh we're responsible hey man if there's death in the house we've got to purge the house praise the Lord Amen now there's a lot of sins that get people and there's a lot of death that runs and one of the most popular ones today are movies like Star Wars that just came out this weekend last December I was preaching this similar message over there in North Carolina in Iowa two weekends in a row went to Iowa the next next weekend went to North Carolina and it just came out and Star Wars the other one came out there's my our Star Wars just come out and everybody was so excited about it and something mean I was I was studying out you know I heard the kids talking about it something started dealing with me and I just went to the scripture and I thought what is the real Star Wars and I saw how the Bible God promised Abraham that your descendants will be as the stars of heaven and so the real star wars are believers who are fighting the good fight of faith praise God and people today are so caught up this weekend I think it's the solo movie because all the children we're talking about it I don't go to trash like that we used you shouldn't either but they're all excited about the Star Wars and and then my heart went to Revelation 19 how at the Battle of Armageddon there's going to be a real Star Wars because all the stars are going to come from heaven writing white horses and god's own son will be the leading one and a sword will come out of his mouth and it'll smite every nation praise God it'll smite the unbelievers so that's just the perversion the Star Wars it's just the perversion of what you and I are doing now we're battling amen for the kingdom of God amen it's exactly right so that's just a perversion just like tattoos are perversion people want us they want to write things up they just want to see it to get inspiration they want to write it they want to draw it they just want to they will never everybody know this is what I am now I put all my children's names here or whatever this is what I am that's just the perversion the real thing is the Holy Spirit writing his word upon the fleshly tables of your heart amen and that's why you here this morning to let the Holy Spirit write its word upon your heart amen it's such a perversion we've got to overcome these perversions with the wisdom of God amen now this is explains why for all these years that explains why people get so excited about the message but then after just a few little months and times they're no longer excited it's because they're spiritually cut off from the congregation think about it when you walk in and you're really prayed up in the Lord I mean your life you're trying every you're asking God for mercy you're repenting of your sins and you come excited to hear the hot the Word of God at the house of God you come and you come in and it don't matter if it's John 3:16 you can say praise the Lord you don't care if it's Genesis 1:1 you don't care what the preacher preaches on you can raise your hand and say hallelujah that's the truth I believe God's Word God's Word does something to you but see when God's Word doesn't move people it show something is wrong in their life something's died in their tent did you know brother Graham said this is lhara grace he said you know he said you getting some little mission out somewhere you know you might find a whole lot in there some spiritual vitamins God has got them for you to help your spirit to pep you up a little that's the preaching of the gospel so the gospel is your vitamins let me know that I hope somebody gets pepped up today if I know I'm getting packed up so hopefully you're getting packed up too my brother said that's the preaching the gospel if the preaching the gospel won't pep up the church there isn't nothing that will amen if this preaching last night this morning tomorrow morning if it doesn't pop you up nothing will because this is life and if it's not life and it's not lower than something's died in your turret amen [Music] you've got to come to the altar you've got to come see the priest you got to come priest sprinkled by the blood of Jesus unto obedience does ever understand that every stranger every person I don't care if you're in the message 40 years 50 years or like me uh how many years many message 17 years I don't care how long you been in when you at when we let something die when we not sin come into our lives it cuts us off from the blessing of God and it puts us in a very sad place let me look at one more thing here before I close so more thing think about this something died in a fence that's just called let's just call him the the Jewish family has called the Smith family something died in their house Oh something's died oh we let sing in our house we better go talk to the pastor so the man goes down to the pastor the pastors he says something died you know my dog died the house death is in her house we're all unclean will you come sprinkles he said yes sir I'll come right away he comes over he sprinkles the house he sprinkles the tent they take everything that was affected I their they clean it they all spring clip and then on the east end oh praise the Lord he wasn't clean yet the third day they got to keep all the dead stuff out the third day he goes take a bath he gets all washed he said oh my I'm ready to go to church and the priest says no you're not you got four more days to wait he waits four more days finally the priest comes his house and said all that all the dead stuff out and church that's what the Holy Spirit's doing does he wants to make sure we're really sincere about getting sin out of our lives praise God some people can keep up their deliverance for one day we need more than a one day victory God's not a one day victory kind of God right when Egypt when Israel came out of Egypt they weren't free for just three days they were free as frickin B and so when this family can keep it up for seven days oh praise the Lord now I can get back to the house of God now I can go worship now I can go sacrifice to my god so you bring his family and he'd bring the goat in or whatever they had they'd sacrifice it and he would feel the sin of that sacrifice and now he could cry at the altar and say praise the Lord my sins are forgiven before he couldn't experience that joy he couldn't experience and then the priests would washed their hands and they'd washed the sacrifice it had to rightly divide the sacrifice as preachers rightly divide the word of God and then it be rightly divided then they could go into the Holies the priest would go in there and church they would go in there and the first thing they would see is light from the tabernacle of the candlesticks there the candlesticks the menorah and this light would be manifesting and they would rejoice in the light that they had remember if you had sit in your home you couldn't experience the priest could experience this they wouldn't have this glorious light shining in their lives oh my go to Leviticus 24 here the biggest chapter 24 verse 1 just a beautiful type here Church the biggest 24 verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses saying command the turn of Israel that they bring unto the unto the pure olive oil beaten for that light to cause the lamps to burn continually without the veil of the tavern or the testimony the tabernacle the congregation shall Aaron order from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually it should be a statute forever in your generations you see this so everybody in the whole entire congregation had a part in the worship of God everybody played a crucial part the priests had to do their part but did you catch the scripture here it's the people who had to bring the beats in oil for the priests to use how many know that a preacher can't preach half a lick of a message unless the people bring in anointing - is that right see this was this was s was accountability everywhere if the peope if every tenth doesn't keep all the death out and then if every tenth isn't producing beat and oil oh my we're burning the midnight oil praise to the heart see there's either death in your home or there's oil being pressed out in your home amen either the Holy Ghost is in your home or death is in your home that's the way the church that Living God moves on and then the people of God brought this oil along with their worship and then they took this oil in and now the light the glorious light of the church ages can shine isn't that beautiful doesn't it prove to all of us how important everyone's household is the people's household had to be constantly beating the oil praying forgiving loving praying for the Holy Ghost praying for victory praying for healing all these things producing the right kind of life and they would bring that life to the house of God did you bring oil to the house of God this morning amen it's a beautiful thing to see it and I could go further remember the last thing before the holiest of Holies was the altar of incense the place of Prayer and this is like we saw earlier with the wisdom this is where you cry out to God your prayer is as incense before the Lord as I studied that there was four parts to the incense and you know that there's four parts to it and it fits that that acronym of pray PRA why that we taught in Sunday school it fits that perfectly where we have to praise God first and then repent of our sins and then ask out our request and then yield to God's will for our lives oh it's beautiful it's beautiful this is our worship this is how we approach to God this is what we must get the wisdom of God amen let me close with this here by God's grace I know I kept it too long here so forgive me let's go to back to Proverbs I want to finish there I hope you can see it by the grace of Lord I hope it be a blessing to you my God is so good to us let's go back to proverbs 15 6 proverbs 15 6 so we started with the wise virgin and how we must get wisdom and look what the scripture says proverbs 15 6 in the house of the righteous is much treasure when the revenues of the wicked is trouble now bro Graham said very few rich people will even be saved because Jesus said that so the treasure Solomon's talking about is not money go to proverbs 21 verse 20 21 verse 20 there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spend it up so where does it place this oil where's the wise version got her oil she's got it right in her home that's her treasure the baptism of the Holy Ghost glory look what the Bible says Rob let's go back to proverbs 3 32 for the froward is abomination to the Lord but his secret is with the righteous oh that's beautiful the secret is with them the treasure is in their home and the treasure is the oil in their home that's the treasure that they have their house is clean there's no death in the house and they've got plenty of oil they got plenty of treasure amen last Scripture revelation 2:19 you can stand her feet let's stand here by God's grace revelation 2:19 I know that works and charity and service and faith and patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first did you know brother Ram said this is the secret to overcoming Satan your life did you know the scripture is how many knew that brother Ram said this is the scripture this has the secret of God the Bible said the secret is with the righteous the oil is in the righteous home and here's what program says about this this is certainly remarkable this is in the church age book chapter 6 as the darkness of the age increased as the honor roll of the martyrs grew lengthy up day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love and the other ages but in this age the Thyatira age is the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of love and to our Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory amen did you catch a church the secret to overcoming Satan's barrage is and attacks of death on our homes is to not lay off and not and well I'll just serve God less I'll just do a little less the secret is to reply and say devil shut up I'm giving God more of my time I'm giving God more of my love I'm giving God more of my service that is the secret that dwells with the righteous let's bow our heads for a moment by God's grace I just plate is so sweet to trust in Jesus can we play that would that be okay you know we're in an age where we're bombarded with reminders appointments schedules tests trials the Prophet said this is the most deceptive of all ages we live an extremely difficult time and we've got to keep our homes clean before the Lord we have to make sure nothing dead comes into our houses for once something Dead's once sin enters our house it affects the entire family it cuts us off from the blessing and love of the Lord we don't feel the same about the cross we don't feel the same about the blood we don't feel the same about the preaching of the word and we've all read this morning that wisdom is the principal thing and with all of our getting we should get understanding I wonder if there's anyone this morning that would say brother Jesse pray for me I've let some dead things get into my home bless those hands that's those hands let me pray for you now if your real sincere pray with me if you want the joy of the Lord to return that dead thing has to be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Heavenly Father you saw the hands Lord bless those sincere honest hands Lord I believe your Holy Spirit has gone into their tent this morning and reveal to them perhaps why the joy of the Lord is gone why the love of the word is gone [Music] and Lord in your grace and mercy you come not to bring condemnation but to bring the waters of separation to separate them from the death in the home oh god it's a serious our Lord that we live in Oh Lord how you want to be the center of every home dear God how you cry in every service that you'll pour out your spirit to all those who will receive it how wisdom cries how the church cries other preachers cry let the Holy Spirit be poured out upon them O Lord God be merciful this morning Lord God may we be so sincere in your presence Lord God knowing that we are to get wisdom we're to get the perfect will of God we're not to settle for dead things we're not to settle for the permissive with of God Oh Lord we want the perfect wood of God we don't want to turn away from you in our older age or younger age we want to turn to you Lord God we went our hearts to be turned back to the Apostolic fathers Lord God dear God in heaven Lord minister to every heart as we sing o God may they truly confess may they go home and do something about it Lord God and there is something about their phone or something about their conversations something about what they watch something about what they see nor that the open vessels are not contaminated for cotton but Lorna instead of contaminated they're blessed they're refreshed their strength and dear God [Music] the Lord for those who didn't raise their hands oh I just pray help them to keep it Lord with all their money getting the wisdom of God may we all cry out for it may we all search for it may we all seek for it Lord God when we lift our voice for the wisdom of God for Lord that's all we want to be wise virgins in this hour bless them Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen [Music] benno desires prayer you're more than welcome to come out my brother Samuel here to come on up I seen that fish so sweet don't you love to trust in Jesus you can trust him with your life if you can trust with your salvation trust them with every single thing in your home this is not an hour to compromise this is our to get wisdom hey Matt messing that boat is so sweet - trust me [Music] [Music] [Applause] jeez is to trust [Music] just trust his cleansing [Music] think of a Jesus Jesus [Applause] [Music] Jesus Jesus [Music] just Jesus race to trust I'm so glad I learn to trust me just cheese [Music] we'll be with of singing jeez [Music] preciousness us all for grace to trust [Music] you're thankful for the word of the Lord you know I tell you the way the Lord just brought that this morning with wisdom looking inwardly in our tents you know the greatest thing that we can ever do when we come to a place that we feel like I'm good that's the very very place that were bad because it's the Word of God the ministering of the word when we look at what God has sent his word to us in this generation it was not a word that was given to us just so that we would have knowledge knowledge is a wonderful thing but if you remember just how the Lord spoke to us here this morning then you find brother Branham over and over from the seals you find him even after the seals almost every message brother Brown would ask you say God will you come and reveal to us that we might know we might know how to live in this day you see just this is not enough it's not enough but wisdom itself it comes not it's not a wisdom from us reading remember it takes more it takes an operation of the Holy Ghost you see we can look at print and we can take print and say ah this very this here this here but you see wisdom is has to be a discernment behind the situation a discernment behind to know how to apply and we're living in that moment where the Holy Spirit because the message that God has sent to us it points us and directs us and it will lead us into that token lie so the message is it directs us to that place and we need that wisdom of God like the Holy Spirit spoke and what a privilege it is for us as young people to be able to have access to call upon God you know this is an age where things are put right at our fingertips and I want you to think of what the Holy Spirit here at the end was directing to the tents because when you look in your life and sometimes you can look and say I want to see victory but remember victory does not start with someone else victory starts with you victory starts with me it's you having victory in your own life first see the enemy wants to deflect and distract our attention but victory starts inside of our vessel first and when victory is dwelling inside of our vessel it has an effect and can be an opening that others themselves can look at that and say what is it about this person why is this person the way they are well they're not they did their life is not as hard as minor they're not going through this or they've never been expected that we don't believe the devil's lies because that's the devil's lies one thing that we know is that God is faithful is faithful you know and and when we we look at how that God has provided for us within this hour that we truly by His grace can look to him we can seek after God and ask God to make himself known to us in this time and this is where we you think of it as as as young people young men young young young ladies there is so much of life that is ahead of you so many pathways so many so many directions to take but yet within it all as what brother Jesse was speaking here as the Lord was bringing that through him that that's all that matters you know when when God had when God did it did such a work in my life I just be very honest with you I didn't care about getting married now you might think I just didn't I my whole focus was is I just wanted to serve the Lord that's the truth and you know I remember my dad telling me you know my dad was trying to talk to me about the different things but really that's all I might that's all my joy was I never declared I was gonna be a Paul but I just that's my whole focus I just I was just in love with the Lord and I'm still in love with the Lord now that was a theme of my life I couldn't get enough and I I still can't get enough and then you know when my wife and I met and I've said this to the young people I've said it to everywhere I've went right now she is the number one person that I love to fellowship with about the word I've got a lot of other I've got a lot of friends brother Jesse in myself real good friends I've got a lot of other friends a lot of other ministry brothers but there is nobody that I love to fellowship with about the word but her and to tell you the truth you can ask the kids you can ask them what mom and daddy what is it that they talk about now I don't we don't go around the house and quote the scripture and throwing this out and can you finish this quote can't even known but sometimes she has to listen to me and then there's other times I'm listening to her but we there's such a fellowship this is our joy see see serving the Lord is not about coming to church it's not about just doing something it's not about just saying well I believe this you know I believe this and I believe God sent a prophet and I believe this I know it's more than that it's not a lifestyle it's a life that's God's that's what God's desire is for you is that you would have life and have it more abundantly and all it all it takes is the little things of what the Holy Spirit was speaking to your heart today there might have been one thing as a young person that you can you can say Lord you spoke to my heart it might have been something in your tent all you have to do is take that one little thing and say Lord I give this to you lord because and there could have been hundreds of people here but God still mindful of your need and God would speak in that manner just to make himself known to you and then you find yourself seeking after him in that and then you'll find it just starts it keeps going it keeps going because you obey his voice and little things he keeps opening keep some for me yeah you know the thing that I think is very very good that we can look at you know sometimes when the Holy Spirit comes conviction can strike but just listen listen to me just a moment if there's things that's on your phone or on your Facebook that you know it's not Ryan it's death don't try to reform it quit it you don't try to reform and I'm gonna switch the platform on it I'm gonna redo this no no because first of all you didn't have the right balance so they don't have the right balance you had to have the right foundation so don't just no don't just say well I'm gonna convert it all the scriptures and convert it all the quotes and no no no you have ever had the right foundation so it's not just erasing and it's not just well I'm gonna delete this app can you say why do you say that because you delete one app if you still don't get to the root of the issue you'll get another app you got yeah we have to understand what how is it that death came in you get to the root of the issue and the Holy Spirit over and over like brother Alexander spoke last night and Holy Spirit brought that one scripture out the axe is laid to the root of the tree when the scripture declares of of God Himself becoming one of us it says he is the root so God came to deal with the root of the issue so we're not we're not ignorant of Satan's devices because you can take one thing and say oh this oh yeah and you just get rid of this but you get rid of this and you really haven't gotten rid of it you have to get rid of here that's that's where as brother Jesse was speaking that's real deliverance because you don't get the root the weed comes back how many know I'm talking about the weed comes back you got to get the root you got to get the root and God is present to deliberate and to unearth all of those roots that's what I'm grateful for we're not let's listen to me now right here where we're standing it's not in any way I used to think in one way here we've come we've come to the message I know I was born and raised in the message but I remember one of the first times that I ever had dealt with the subject and I went to preach on a subject called the Feast of iniquity I thought why in the world am i preaching this is a message church and I just started ministering but I preached the Feast of iniquity and I thought what but what I really what you realize is we're not exempt from problems so it's not about you know that look how God had to bring me along on that we're not exempt from problems but we have the answer we have the answer and that answer is the Lord Jesus Christ not a theory not a historical being but the very Living God that's the answer to the devil's question that's the answer right there God is so good to us what our what a wonderful word that the Lord brought to us this morning you love the Lord one that good this morning my I was broke down God has you know you think about for the young people here if your timeline just like my timeline you guys make timelines in school right I never liked making them I never seemed like I always got everything put up here at the beginning and I had this wide gap at the end and finally when I became a teacher I learned how to space those things out but you know all of those little points on a timeline their events and every one of those events there are things that they're happenings they were important points and God our timeline is already laid out your timelines laid every little point every little thing and you don't have to worry about what's gonna happen at this point once the main thing is is that your life is committed into his hands God sees to it that every Junction and every point you'll make it you'll make it you don't ever have if the Bible is so clear in the Book of Psalms 119 that they who are seeking after him can do no iniquity when we're seeking fully after God you can do no iniquity it's fully focusing on him God is just such a clarity within it and it doesn't something deep it's just simple they say Lord make yourself more real to me and as he speaks to you just keep yielding to him and you watch how that your Lord will move within your life it starts out like a little button but it grows too eventually
