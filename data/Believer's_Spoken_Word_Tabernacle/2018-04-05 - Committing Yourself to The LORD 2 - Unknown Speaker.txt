I'm one Satan but you're not his property anymore we were in the pawn shop but we've been redeemed amen oh my the authority of God's Holy Word amen you're loving tonight amen let's just look to him in a word of Prayer before we open to the word tonight if you have a need let's just make it known before the Lord and let's just expect him to pass our way tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we just we love you Lord we're just so thankful for the time that you have given to us Lord to be able to come together for Lord we realized that it's not Lord concerning us Lord so much as it is Lord you coming and speaking to us Lord regarding the purpose that you have for our lives Lord as we are here tonight or God from all walks of life Lord every one of us Lord having a need Lord tonight Lord behind those hands that are lifted up Lord we lift Lord our hearts to you Lord for you're the only one that can Lord answer and make the difference law and so Lord we just ask that you would just come we want to just give ourselves Lord entirely into your hands tonight Lord and we just pray the Lord you'll take the Lord not only a speaker but here and Lord just Lord half your way in the midst Lord of our lives Oh God we just pray that you'll just come Lord and speak your word to a hearts Lord but you know what do we have need of tonight Lord we give ourselves to you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you open up your Bibles there and let's turn to in the book of Peter there first Peter chapter 2 and I want to read just a few verses of Scripture there verse 13 of verse Peter to submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake be to the king saud that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the King servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward for this is think worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is that if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God for even hereunto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow in his footsteps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously I want you to notice that that verse when he was reviled reviled not again so it shows that there were things that came against him to try to revile him draw him out stir him up but he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not he could have really rendered some threats is that right he could have rendered threats he could have said one of these days you're gonna be standing right for me he could have done that he could have looked right at him and said I'll remember you is that right but he didn't threaten he didn't threaten you see he was Kong he came to that place in the midst of his suffering it was brought to that place but yet he threatened not how how can this be how can this be is this something that was just for the Lord Jesus that is not for us as believers no it's for us it's for us it's for us here's what he did here was the overcoming but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls amen may God bless you mrs. Ward as you're being seated I want to continue to look at that thought here tonight for a few moments on committing committing yourself to the Lord when we look here at the first part of the scriptures here that we've read in 1st Peter 2 even the very first phrase that we read from there is submit yourselves and to submit is to voluntarily give over and we know that that is what God has has called for is that even when dealing with the things even of this world as Peter would speak it there that of how that we even are to conduct ourselves and to conduct our lives that the gospel itself has not given to us a Liberty as though that we are to look down upon P or to even as we realize that this world is already it's headed to judgment we recognize that we recognize that even some of the people we don't know who but some of the people even that we would rub shoulders with on a daily basis some people that we come in contact with that they'll never turn to the Lord and yet we don't know what the outcome and where the end will be we don't know we know that God when he places you and I even in the communities that we live in and where we're at this is not by chance but God places us there that it would be not so much as a blessing for us with which which the things that God provides truly are a blessing from him but yet it's about us being a light in in this time this this day and in the community and even in the job where God has placed you an ayah to rest in and you know when we we look at this in the scripture here of how that the Lord Jesus himself he suffered very much he was he was persecuted he was withstood he was ridiculed his entire life it was always the mark that was laid upon his life things were spoke about him even regarding that of his birth he had to bear those things all of his life he never came into a place as far as we could say of reprieve to where things were not being said about him or against him or he wasn't being tried or persecuted but yet to think about it if he had got caught up in all of that we would still be dead in our sins tonight but you see God himself could not this could not be an act he could not strip everything away it could not be to wear that it would be every and everywhere that he went that he was going to be welcomed and everybody was gonna love him everybody was gonna like him that was something remember the Bible tells us very clearly that he came into the world and yet the world knew him not here he came into this place and we know that it was not that of the world when we look at cosmos that God Himself created but we realize that that which know that the the the administration and the government that's upon the earth right now that that's not of God but we recognize that just as there was in our life an administration there was something about our life but yet God Himself comes down on the inside and he changes that administration we are the same we are the same temple but yet it's a new creation inside of a new temple there's a new owner that's moved in on the inside and yet we look at this of how that you know it could have been in such a place that everything would have been so seemingly easy but yet God he came down and we know that the purpose and the reason and why all the persecution while the suffering it was Satan that was against he's always been against the very working and the program of God and let me tell you something you are a part of the program of Almighty God it don't matter what size the part it is to play it's just that you are a part of the Word of God a part of the program of God when the Spirit of God has put you into the body by that spiritual induction of the Holy Ghost and there it's God Himself moving through your life just as he worked through the life of of his son when he was here upon earth that same God working through your life and yet because of our identification in him we suffer persecution we suffer there are suffering that's not just persecution we understand that trials and yet we understand that when all of these things as it comes our way there were many things that as we can look with the Lord Jesus no doubt he was pulled to limits upon many things cuz the Bible says when he was tempted the Bible said he suffered and that word suffered means to be vexed to undergo a sensible experience he he knew he was touched this this suffering and everything would go to such depth in his emotional realm I want you to think about this you might look at it and say well you know I've had words said to me or this has been said to me I want you to think about it his whole life he had things said about him everywhere he went he had things talked about him he had that cloud upon his life that he was born his mother of a drunken soldier he had that about his life but you know what it was something that was down there that was greater and to recognize of how that he even looked when all of these things would come about in his life you see it wasn't that God required you and I as far as this body to be virgin born in order to be an overcomer the virgin birth was so that the price could be paid you with me that virgin body sucked that virgin body suffered he as brother been traumatized it he had a headache he experienced temptation he went through all those things that's not how he overcome by the virgin body he overcome by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in his life that let him know who he was and he overcame by that in knowing who he was he's a part of the word is that right he is the word are you with me so it being that of the word then what is he doing he's committing himself to that of the word unto God that God will completely direct for he says I of myself can do nothing but he committed he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously I pray that God will help me to bring this as these things have been just moving on my heart and the things he even spoke to me regarding it but I look at this word committed and we looked at it last week and the very word committed means to give over into the hands of another but do you realize this same Greek word is the same word that's used in the New Testament for betrayal betrayal itself is where there's a giving into someone's hands but it's a giving that's by deception so we found that with within this of how that the Lord Jesus as we that last week and yet here in the midst of the time of where he's prayed he's asked if it's possible let this cup pass from me he himself had to had to die right there when we look at Calvary we see the death on Calvary but the death itself took place in the garden that's where the real death took place because the death was to the will of God that's the real death that Calvary was the manifestation of that overcoming that took place within the garden that's where the lamb prevailed in the garden is that right but here we find that when they they come to take him the Lord Jesus himself he arises and he gathers all of the disciples and I'm just going to refer out of Matthew 26 verse 45 where he refers to them that this is the hour that the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners and he spoke to them arise let us be going behold he is at hand that does betray me and while he yet spake lo Judas one of the twelve came and with the great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign now what you think about this Judas betrayed him is that right but even what's this now look how the Lord Jesus even prior to coming to all of these stages he knew as he said one of you is a devil is that right now let me ask you a question did Jesus act any different towards Judas than he did to the rest of them was there any way that they could have picked it out and said I know it's Judas you see it you see how Jesus looks at him you see I treat see you see there wasn't anything like that you see it shows what it means when we can stand in position of the word and rest in God not rest in ourselves he said what do you mean by resting in yourselves I'm talking about resting in our emotions our emotions our feelings always got to be checked you with me I feel to say this check I think this check it's not rest in my emotions God speaks to me but every time the voice even though it sounds the same way it's not always God are you with me it's check it sometimes the checking of it is not so much what's being said but check it of it of how is it affecting me in my spirit is it is it rising in my spirit is it causing those sandals right there's a check God ain't gonna do that are you with me so it's checking every one every spirit the Bible said beloved try every spirit see whether it be of God or not so here here comes Judas and he betrayed him he that betrayed him gave him aside and said whosoever I shall kiss the same as he hold him fast for with he came to Jesus and said he'll master and kissed him and Jesus said unto him you deceiver you betrayer I knew you all along come on somebody how did Jesus approach this home brother Sam you know that's Jesus but if Jesus is inside of you then you and I have the authority to be able to approach it with in this manner even when Satan would get up on my brother and my sister but yet to be able to stand there and say my brother my friend come on somebody man illusion but notice he came in he Jesus didn't draw back he's a friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him and the whole one of them which was with Jesus stretched out his hand drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear this was alliance these are alliances you're picking on Jesus you the Prophet would speak to us there in the church age book regarding our tests our trials that comes our way of how that were to conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials those things that he in His infinite wisdom permits to come our way how do we conduct ourselves in the right way how do we conduct ourselves in joy by committing ourselves unto him who judges righteously but say me are you saying that I can't judge righteously sometimes our emotion cast judgment sometimes our feelings render judgment come on somebody why do you think they called in jurors and they asked jurors have you heard anything about this case they wanted me to serve jury duty here not too long ago in the city Lorie I said I'm a pastor I'm you know these people I might be pastoring them some day I'm not gonna serve on that but I have an exemption that I'm able to do that as a pastor where there they'll permit that but you know they asked a journey to Jerry but people to come in there and they asked you do you know anything about this trial do you know anything about this yeah I don't know how people don't know anything about these trials they go in and set on I mean everything's blasted in your face I don't know how they don't know I really don't sometimes you almost wonder is it a gimmick you know but to think about this why because we and our emotions this is what the Lord Jesus is even instructing us Ruby / Peter that in our emotions we could judge so unrighteous ly that's why we need to commit it to him because you never know you never know that person who's come against you might might be you data lead them to the Lord so you either leave a door open or you close the door woo glory be to God this is where the Lord Jesus here in directing us as Paul would look at this in Philippians chapter 1 verse 29 and he says for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which you selling me and now here to be in me Paul we realize Paul suffered many many things and there was many things as Paul would write about this conflict the same that you've saw because everywhere that Paul went there was conflict but it was not conflict that was signature Paul you say what do you mean by that it wasn't Paul acting outside of the leading of the Lord and then turning and saying I'm being persecuted no with me who's sowing seed tonight way following this was not anything we're paul paul we know being late what great things you must suffer for my name's sake i'm gonna show this to you and how that paul when he dealt with this in acts 14 nineteen just one example but i want to hone in on this one there came thither certain jews from Antioch and Iconium now they've been run out of Antioch they've been run out of Iconium is that right who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city now let's you watch this you can read this just verses on back to where when they were put out in Antioch when they were put out they shut they shook the dust off their shoes and they departed and they gave glory to God having joy in the Holy Ghost not joy in the circumstances joy in the Holy Ghost so they leave but now in this time how God would direct Paul Paul didn't get up and leave that city he got up after being stoned and walks back into the city this is not an act God is displaying to the believers that live there of the standing in the midst of the times of things that would come about your life God will grant you grace when you feel like you can't go no more when you're left for dead God will raise you right back in place Alleluia because there's other times that we can read about in the scripture where Paul will move right out of the city and the Bible says that how that the next day they departed with Barnabas to Derby and when they had preached the gospel to that city and it taught many they returned again to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch they went back to those places what to do what confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God they exhorted them within their life and within their walk and I look at how that the Lord Jesus he laid this out in John 16:33 these things have I spoken unto you that in me in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world and you know you would think these words would frighten you frighten people away but to the believer the Lord Jesus knows that it's a greater power it's not the reasoning and intellect of men but it's the very power of God his presence his spirit that would woo his children unto himself in a love affair to where he himself steps on the inside and when you know what when you fall in love with somebody you don't care about all of these other things even out brother Branham brought it with that young man and that young lady murdered brother BAM talked about how she coming up here and she didn't even have shoes on her feet brother Graham said she had that gingham dress and she had you know these things that where they didn't have nothing but yet what was it if they fell in love with one another and that's what the Lord Jesus himself would look at it friends it's not that all of a sudden we get filled with the Holy Ghost and fall in love with God the Holy Ghost won't come unless you are in love with him are you with me jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments and we will come and make our abode in thee you gotta allows him you gotta love him and seek after him and then he comes and this this is where that with that love affair of that love dwelling within the heart no wonder Paul could just echo out by the Spirit of God that who shall separate us he's not even looking at all the things that could come but it is the power of Christ residing within his heart by a love affair the Lord Jesus told him in Matthew 10 he told him there and I didn't include some of these here but I have them I if you want to return them in your Bible you can but he told him I'm gonna send you out I'm sending you out his sheep among wolves be you therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves and once you think of this be wise as serpents and harmless as doves knowing that there's going to be situations of which he mentions that you're going to be delivered unto counsels now once you think of this delivered unto counsels they're gonna scourge you in their synagogues you're going to be brought before governors and Kings for a testimony against them in the Gentiles but when they deliver you up this is where he says now when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what shall what you shall speak in another part of the gospel and mark it says do not premeditate I'm gonna say this I should I say this I should have say that the wiser the serpent harmless as a dove there are many many encounters that you read in the scriptures and maybe I just referred to a fume here that when you look at in the book of Acts you see that there were many encounters that even Paul would come into and Paul himself never used the same approach each time that's the same way when they came into the land of Canaan it was not the same pro chawl the time but yet he was God first it was God first sometimes where Paul would would come into a situation you have in the Acts chapter 23 where Paul stands there and he looks he's brought in remember right here into question before the Pharisees and Sadducees and the Bible says that Paul perceived that over a great majority was Pharisee so what Paul said is I believe in the resurrection and what happened he divided that assembly just like that I believe in angels he began to do that you see he didn't come right out and say you every one of you are wrong what was that the same Holy Ghost that led him in that moment be how could that happen because Paul had committed himself unto God you think Paul wasn't tempted to blast him you think Paul wasn't tempted he was tempted me tell you something even when the Prophet stood there in the brand in the land the Lord told there's gonna be a test before you and remember when that young couple was making out in the service that was the test God didn't tell him what the test was going to be but notice where was the test he was tested even in that of his emotions but he said I stopped at I forgive you don't do that no more oh ma handling a situation lecture like a son of God taking control of that situation he didn't come down and you know just just lay down the law upon him and and just take the whole rest of the surface and say I feel that of the Lord I'm gonna change my sticks and I'm gonna speak on fornicators and you see what was it he was not reserved to William Branham but brother Branham was reserved to the Lord are you with me brother Branham was not reserved to William Branham brother Branham was reserved to the Lord William Branham in his emotions was there oh my you think of how that the enemy know that man was just given him all the scriptures and things that could be said in that moment look how the situation was handled see God knew God the test itself God knows even the test friends listen to me even the test and these things that God permits to come our way it's all part of our molding but it's all part of it that how in ourselves will we commit ourselves to him because in these things which the prophet in victory day millirem tells us he said if you could just look through God's looking glass he said these little trials these little disappointments and he uses that term little disappointments he said if you could just focus away and look at it it's God only bringing you to places that you might have a victory day in your life because in Christ it is victory after victory there's one victory and then because of that victory then we have that that that way that's made that we can have victory in trials and it makes way for that great Victory Day that's coming because these victories are only temporary is that right enjoy him enjoy the victory because tomorrow you might be on the battlefield again right I thought when I was playing football you know our coach would tell us enjoy this win tonight but he said you'd be here tomorrow morning at 7:30 ready to run sprints watch films couldn't hard to get the sleep out of my eyes sometimes on those Saturday mornings and you're sitting there trying to watch film and everything but you know what it was it was we're gonna look at what you did right and what you did wrong we're gonna have everything graded for you but then we're gonna start prepping you for the next opponent then you got to go the whole weekend thinking about this guy you got a face can you enjoy steak knowing you got to face somebody like that you're loving tonight any good so good but it said take not take no thought what you're gonna say but it's the spirit of your father that speakers in you and he goes on and lets them know of how that even brother is gonna deliver up brother he lets him know that there's going to be the father will DIF deliver up the child and how a child will raise up against the parents and cause them to be put to death I tell you betrayal is a terrible thing but betrayal inside of family didn't Lord Jesus see he knew this betrayal of things betrayal things that can come around and even betrayal within the family of God betrayal is a hard thing i'ma tell you something right now our spirits are not made to handle betrayal we're not we are not built emotionally to handle betrayal listen our human spirit everything about us does not like betrayal this is where that from the midst of it that in the midst of betrayal is to look to God I mean you know you've been in a workplace sometimes and there's things that sometimes you realize you don't go talking to everybody oh I feel so at home got around you you better be careful who you feel at home around Jesus told him in this verse I'm reading you beware of men he wasn't telling them to walk around in fear but you know what there's some times where there's things you might feel like saying but maybe you just better keep it because there could be somebody that all of a sudden Satan can anoint their memory or anoint their tongue and then what happens is there's things that just get centered right on you man oh man Wow just following you sir betrayal you think what in the world what in the world he said you'll be hated of men for my sake my betrayal is such as such a great thing in our lives every one of us if you haven't you will experience it but betrayal itself is one of those things that here the Lord Jesus this was the greatest betrayal of all times but look what he did in the midst of this time and I believe that we and ourselves can grow from this he committed himself to him who judges righteously blue bream says it like this in Ephesians he says I know thy works and thy labour that patience as he walks in the midst of his church he's aware of the suffering of his people and he cares as it was in the days of captivity in Egypt when he heard their cries he who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks amongst them the very word laborer signifies a weariness through oppression God's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy they are patient in bearing the yoke that first aid suffered great persecution it had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed for truth their enemy it wasn't that their they didn't have a spiritual enemy but their enemy was a very much so a natural enemy they were not they were not gathering in places like you and I are able just to freely drive in here and have a sign out here they didn't have all of the of conveniences or the ease but yet they preach the gospel because there was a motivating power in their life of that divine love that press them through even the hardest times and it gave them strength and encouragement through the hardest of times the Cobra Graham says this he said their high calling in life was to serve God is that your high calling is to serve God not how I want to I want to become this Sunday I want to become that Sunday but the high calling is to serve God if God sees fit that this is to be then he'll open the door but my first priority the high calling is to serve God that's first now notice he says and when their hopes in life were blighted that means just like taking away their hopes and life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for him on earth what would the whole the whole summation of this is is that when things came about the hopes that they had within life know there's things that you still have to do on a day-to-day basis you still have to go to work you're still got to pay your bills and let me tell you something you have to live as though he could come the next moment but you have to also move within this moment as though that you yourself that God would continue on so that even means in the raising of our children that means in everything that we do do it heartily as unto the Lord giving our all every moment until he himself takes us away and sometimes as it says here their hopes were blinded I wonder I wonder how many meetings that James had scheduled to preach when he was taken home to the natural mind that would not have looked like this is what needs to be James was a leader of the church in Jerusalem and everything seemed to be so blinded but you see God knows everything and all that he's doing his work is not going to recede but it's only going to increase and the increase comes from the heart and from the life from the effectual working of the Holy Spirit that in it all when there's things that you can't understand I can't understand don't tell me you understand why there's some people that were taken home at the age of 17 some are taken home to glory at the age of 10 and some are taking home what by the assignment you don't understand I don't understand when you're looking to look at a man that even here 55 years old or whatever more and taken home a man preaching the gospel as an evangelist who a man that as a young man here he is swimming and is taken away in a curtain a current you don't understand that but God knows he knows and you say well if I don't understand how it's not a battle understand it comes down to the place of say the Lord it my spirit of all tore up Lord I don't understand what's taking place but Lord you're in control you're in control Lord that starts even the process of committing it starts the healing it starts to dissolving this is not just in death I'm talking about I'm talking about in trials brother Brent says I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that God's people have always been and always will be persecuted he goes into of the parallel between Cain and Abel and Ishmael and Isaac and Esau and Jacob but then brother Branham makes a statement in the New Testament a few paragraph 1 down we find Judas betraying betraying Jesus while the religious orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God who are controlled by the spirit it's Satan flatting against God Satan anoints flesh to come against flesh that is veiling God but that's why you can stand and recognize this warfare is not a flesh and blood affair is a flesh-and-blood affair it's Satan see this is where the Prophet would even bring it and speak to us these things you see these things are spoken in the message these things are spoken in the scripture but then we must apply them and there's going to be situations that arise that we have to apply them whereas the Prophet told us you must recognize he said that it's not your brother doing that it's Satan or your sister and he goes on and remember how the Prophet brings us to this and this is where I'm working in to this place here it determines the attitude that we take towards it even if somebody's done wrong my attitude matters my attitude matters persecutions come my way my attitude matters my attitude matters what I say Matt it matters now let's just look at this here rearend goes on to say no matter how just an upright a Christian is before the public how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned in other words to declare Jesus Christ is come in the flesh you will be condemned it looked at as a oddball you see many of the religious world they look back on what was done for them but they fail to recognize that was done that you and I might be brought back to God in a union to where that same God that lived in that body desires to live inside of that body of his redeemed subjects that he has brought to himself as what he said the spirit of this world hates the Spirit of God and because it can't overcome the spirit of God it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of truth dwells it cannot overcome the Holy Ghost in you so it tries to destroy you it comes he comes against your flesh in your spirit yes sir these parts where it's vexed listen every one of us have said things wrong every one of us every one of us have been in times where we responded in a way that we should not have responded but do you see the convicting power of the Holy Ghost within your heart that even draws you to it brings you to that place and you are so smitten in your heart to say Lord forgive me I shouldn't have said that about this I shouldn't have done what is it it is the dwelling of the keeper of Almighty God within what's he doing he's moving upon the gates there's a gate that had gotten loose come on gate our gates in our spirit you can't overcome the Spirit of Truth so he tries to tear down and destroy the vessel that's what Satan tries to do and as far as within any of our lives we're all full of mistakes but the brim stands on the message he that is in you he said don't you lose your confidence in me he said as far as mistakes I'm full of them and that's truth every prophet was there right but yet the reality of it is it's the revelation there is no fault in the revelation who is Christ right there's no folding there that revelation is perfect they sought to kill the Lord Jesus think about Lazarus here lastest has been raised from the grave you know the very next chapter the Bible said many of them came to see Lazarus here was Jesus setting there but it was what happened to Lazarus that drew many to come and want to see what had happened this man that had been raised from the dead but there was chief priest who came also and said let's kill him because you know why he's turning many people from us to Jesus well as it wanted to destroy the vessel why because the vessel was a testimony of the glory of God multiple times they sought to kill Paul multiple times and in every one of these times that they sought to come at Paul God made a way don't live in fear about things that your job or this or that let me tell you something if you're looking to the Lord you got God on your side the Bible said the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man can do unto me it's looking to God let me tell you something I don't care how powerful the union is I don't care how much this is there's nothing more powerful than a man who's in position with God nothing is more powerful than a man or a woman who's in position with Almighty God nothing can overthrow that because God's got you there for a purpose God will let you know what you need to do persecutions and trials let me get to this my lord persecutions and trials are a natural and normal part of the Christian life there is only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God now committal is not a give up you understand committal is not just saying can't do nothing about that's not committal committal is by Authority putting it into the hands of one who has greater authority you you if you give up if they're what is that needs to be committed it's just laying there but your committal shows faith in Him who's able to do something about it commit them all to God the persecutions in trials look at this part judge not to help me Lord and leave they're out working and final judgment to him leave it to him I want to read this scripture with you in Psalms 37 look at this direction that David gives us here as we're coming down here and verse 1 he said fret not thyself because of evildoers you know what fret means to boil up in anger jealousy fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity how many remember Psalm 73 the psalm of Asaph if you haven't read that you read back over it Asaph was a chief musician in David's army David so ASEP kept coming to church Asaph kept playing but a Seth got to looking at the wicked nothing goes wrong with them they prosper they're going up it sounds like one of our songs up up but I can't say up up up to be with Jesus but it looks like they're going up up Asaph got to looking so much at that to a saps own testimony in Psalms 23 said my foot had almost slipped I almost lost my footing because I got to looking at that you see it isn't envy that oh ha I wish I could be out in the world this is so hard no it's like ah it seemed like here in the workplace or whatever more everybody loves them and it seems like it's envy Envy what it's envy to me I want to be I want to be loved and lacked like all of them now you can take the attitude and say it don't matter I am a Christian don't you lose your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness I'm a Christian I don't need that no we all need one another we all need love woo glory be to God for they listen listen for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb but look at this direction that's given in verse 3 trust in the Lord and do good so true trusting in the Lord that's in word right but the N word trust reflects in doing good is that right so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart I'd say probably everyone is can quote that scripture but notice this delight myself this is an action that you called to delight thyself in the Lord and the desires that are in your heart you give them to you because if you're delighting yourself in the Lord if there's anything that's out of cater the Lord will dissolve that you'll bring it to light you'll repent of it and get that desire out come on somebody because you cannot delight in the Lord with enmity against somebody but if you're delighting in the Lord you're there in the cleansing flow and what happens there's a cleansing that's going on he'll point out listen when we're reading in the work we're listening to the message we're in prayer the Holy Spirit convicts not just in the house of God he'll bring things to our attention in our lives if we're delighting ourselves in him then those desires that are righteous that are godly those desires of thine heart he you'll bring them forth verse five commit thy way unto the Lord that journey commit it to him if you keep talking about it you ain't committed it you keep talking about it you ain't committed it you keep hashing it you ain't committed it but to commit it is where as a prophetess say like this he said when the doctors have said they can do no more for you he said look to God and His Word and know that he is a healer he said and take that word and say Lord I commit myself to you and he says and then act like you're healed now I don't believe you understand I don't believe this is just things we just say out but when it comes that place where we can look at that in the word and say Lord there's a power comital help me to rise even to that place to where I can commit this to you Lord God to where I'm not I'm not gonna try to judge it out solve it out and I've got everything to sign I don't know you do and I'm not gonna let my life be robbed with worried I'm gonna delight myself in you because you're the real joy of my life you're the real delight of my life you're what makes my world as it were go round how many times mother and said I love to hunt I love to fish I love those trans back there he said but I would never trade anything for this time in his presence in his presence what about this women commit it to the Lord Trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth look at this thy righteousness as the light and that judgment as the noonday can I have just a few more moments I'm gonna just skip over some verses and I want to I read this to you last week out a life story and I want to read this here brother bream says if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself now brother Branham over and over even and throughout the message brother Branham he deals with this and he'll say this phrase many times even when there were situations that people were taking tapes and splicing them and brother Brown says they're making me say things that I didn't say still do it today they splice quotes together they'll quote what they want a quote out of it and when they get done with it it don't look anything like the image of Jesus Christ it looks like a mongrel you asked me the same you oughta not say that or no I ought to say that but you see what he did brother branham himself noticed this he said in the message I believe it's recognizing your day in its message brother Brown said what he did he says look he said I I gave that over to God he said as long as I'm fighting it God can't fight it now it didn't mean that he didn't stand against it but brother Brown was not gonna waste his time trying to track them guys down you understand me there's things that we can do them just be an absolute waste of time I don't know how many times I've told you you ain't going to convince these people on their blog posts and everything else why read the trash well I'll read it well I'm gonna win them back to the Lord be careful who's winning who why would you study that and give yourself to that when God has given to us the riches of his glory there's no vindication no light nothing that will ever come from reading those things but if you can get before God and say God I know this word is right I know it's true will you reveal yourself to me Lord then you'll have a stability even of the things that you cannot explain and it wouldn't matter how many contradictions you find come on somebody you don't matter he doesn't matter and it isn't that it doesn't matter because we make everything they'll say if the Lord we don't make everything they'll say if the Lord God never made everything thus saith the Lord are you with me brother branham himself he says so much of this is my own opinion come on somebody he said don't do that is that right but God and God reveals and declares whatsoever he has said he will bring back to our remembrance they're right could over it be to God so he says don't fight this just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it commit it to him God will take care of it now watch what's this looming their narrow this down here on the fretting in Proverbs 24 17 rejoice not wind an enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth love does not rejoice in iniquity I knew it all along I hate that in looking back discernment I knew he was that all along I knew lest the Lord see it watch this lest the Lord see it and it displeased him and he turn away his wrath from him so haughty I knew God was going to deliver me and fire her I knew God was gonna remove him I just knew it because I'm a son of God and he came against me God says huh I think I'll just pull it back and I think I'll promote him I think I'll promote her hmm verse 19 fret not thyself because of evil men neither be thou envious at the wicked for there shall be no reward to the evil man the candle of the wicked shall be put out my son look at this wisdom my son fear the Lord and the King and metal not with them that are given to change for their calamity shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them both I want you to think of the Lord Jesus here in the closing moments on the cross kind of looked at this last week but in the midst of what was taking place he said Father forgive them clear - his last moments he was tested it's anything is there anything that can anchor into his heart is there any bitterness any enmity anything and all that can come and he says Father forgive her how how listen to me now the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane it left him but here he is hanging on the cross it's committed there had been such a committal that had taken place even there even in the garden the full submission - here he is on the cross Father forgive him they don't know what they're doing you remember when brother Branham and spoken words original seed a trial came up and brother Brent says oh he said forget about it somebody was pointing something out to him they were pointing it out Brent's - forget about it he said that was predestinated before the before the world - give me a trial and you know what they said how can you look at it that way but that's what he answered it was predestinated to give me a trial what was happening a committal it was committing himself because he because they said this is about you and your family somebody is talking about you and your family the brem says forget it forget it here they are the disciples asked you for a few moments I didn't ask you for an hour here they are the Lord Jesus his face is set toward Jerusalem and he he tells them to go ahead he says and tell him we'd like to come into this village in Samaria well they send people out to meet him and say we don't want you here and so John the Beloved hey why don't we call fire down out of heaven like Elijah did but Elijah didn't do it out of his vexation of his spirit Elijah didn't do that like you're wronged me you don't want us in this village send fire down and consume them now there's no doubt that John we could say well John was looking back into that time of Elijah to where Elijah was there preserved and the fire itself was there issued out and it took away those men that came to take him but you see what the Lord Jesus caught was he said you don't know what spirits are up see it was discerning your knittin look this opposition is coming but look out the Lord Jesus handles that he said you don't even know what spirit you're up now I want you to think about this what if the water if fire had been called down there wouldn't have been no place to send Philip to but there was some more seed down in Samaria and when Philip and Philip got sent after persecution came Paul made havoc of the church Church scattered him God sent Philip down to Samaria and Samaria wend brother Philip went down there in the word and hearts were one to the Lord God knows what he's doing for that moment in time what if the Lord Jesus had stopped there at that moment in time what if they had received him his face was to go to Jerusalem think of that you think he didn't know he could have known that was gonna reject that they was gonna turn him out sometimes there's things that you're turned out of some things sometimes there's things that don't work out and things don't happen across the spectrum but you know what God knows exactly what to do to get us in position our face is fixed on Jesus and there's certain places he don't want to stop him it doesn't mean that that place may not get visited later but God knows no doubt may be sitting right here there's been people that maybe you worked with and then after a period of time how that God would turn around different ones maybe in your neighborhood maybe they even rejected the gospel when it was first given to him but they turn around because there's a seed and they turn around and receive it but send me of that impossible come on friends Paul himself was a persecutor of the Church of the Living God Paul himself said I was a blasphemer he said I did it in ignorance is that right this is where even the Prophet could not just say it about Scripture but witness it even in his own meetings he said you let the power of God come down and said and God will take ahold of a skeptic someone who's been a despiser and a rejecter of these meetings he said and God will come down and do a work in that heart he said I'll turn him into a witness that's why sometimes you don't know when we're shaking the dirt off don't throw the shoe Adam I hope you with me tonight just because your family don't receive and don't respond don't shake don't shake it off and throw the dirt Adam come on just recognize for this moment because when they shook the dirt off their shoes back there in Antioch the Bible we read in acts 19 they went back to Antioch when at the appointed time and God knows every every one of those junctions he knows when descendants he knows when to open the door faithful what must we do commit ourselves to the Lord commit ourselves think of it even when Paul went off the scene every messenger went off the scene when the Prophet himself went off the scene look at this the message that has been delivered to you and I what does he do it he committed to the Lord knowing that God's Word it cannot fail God cannot fail oh ma no longer there will be a bride there is a bride not they will be in His image B they are in His image in his likeness glory be to God he committed this is a word it's been committed to the Lord how much more God knows every situation knows every part in our lives he knows everything you've been through everything you're going through everything you and I will go through but what it comes down to committed to him who judge righteously say Lord my spirit that's all tore up all of this that's all bothering a committed Lord into your hands and let him have it he's faithful and he cares do you care you loved him tonight oh just I'm so thankful to the Lord let's just bow our heads in order prayer Lord Jesus you are so faithful Lord thank you Lord for your word that you've given to us tonight Lord to instruct us and to lead us Lord and direct us Lord you are truly Lord as Peter would admonish us by the Spirit of God that how that the enemy himself roaming about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but Lord has were admonished gird up the loins of our mind Lord that girding up Lord taking the belt and tightening it a little tighter Lord gird about with truth truth and Lord we recognize the truth truth is the person Lord Jesus you know every every need you know every situation that's here tonight every everything Lord that in any of our hearts Lord that we have either been through or going through you even you see all of this Lord and when you have come tonight to speak to us you have not come Lord to condemn but you do correct us and you do show us Lord that there is authority we have as we looked at it last week I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again we have within Lord that authority Lord to submit ourselves to you well the scripture said submit ourselves unto God then resist the devil and he will flee from you Lord if we submit put ourselves under the word put every part under the word Lord and Lord Jesus sometimes Lord in our lives we do we experience things Lord that can so vex us in our spirits things Lord that can be said and be done the Lord is is likened unto that of betrayal wounds that can come up in our lives the Lord Jesus even in the midst of persecution and trial father we receive it Lord we're not exempt from that you yourself when you came down and walked here upon this earth you are not removed from that but you showed us the way of how to overcome and overcoming is always putting ourselves last it's you first family next and ourselves last that's overcoming lord help us help us Lord when our our feelings or our thoughts our emotions Lord father we we ask for your help Lord that Lord we have a place that we can come to we have a refuge Lord a place where we can go in you lord and that refuge Lord is a great place of prayer that we can take

time of need Lord Father we thank you for that access Lord and dear God as we look here tonight lord I pray that father these things Lord that we have looked and you have the Lord cultivated and brought forth from your word and Polish to us Lord to show us Lord that in the midst of these times Lord of how we overcome the fretting of ourselves Lord instead we commit ourselves to you we trust in you doing good aligning ourselves in the Lord and trusting in him all Lord God and you bring forth our righteousness you'll bring forth the right judgment because it's in your hands and we have committed ourselves and delivered ourselves into your hands Lord we thank you for your grace Lord thank you for ministering drugs tonight Lord father for every need Lord for each and every one tonight
