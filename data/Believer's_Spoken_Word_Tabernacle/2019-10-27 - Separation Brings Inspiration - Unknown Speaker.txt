by You Father we're so thankful that you call us by name father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ may you bless these people knowledge of God this morning I don't believe that their gathering together would be in vain we've gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ believing you would speak through these lips of clay Lord unworthy as I am Lord yet you see the needs of your children and you desire to help us Lord it was your good pleasure to give us the kingdom and father we just ask Lord you just pour out a special blessing on each need Lord there's needs here today I don't know about maybe needs that the people themselves don't even know that they have Lord perhaps they'll walk out today and find that something has happened in their life but I believe before the need were to come I believe for adversity arose you knew the need and you made a preparation that you're still Jehovah Jireh you're still Jehovah Shalom God we believe right now our time our lives are in your hands and there's not one thing that can pluck us from your hand father we commit all these things now into your hands believing it's safe father believing that that we've we've got a security in your kingdom by the Holy Ghost father me you bless the service bless the word may all that send dumby to your glory and may you receive praise and honor we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen and amen god bless you it's good to be with you again this this morning and going into this afternoon I just want to before I take my text this morning if you want to start turning you can it's gonna be Genesis the 13th chapter but as you're turning there I just want to thank each one I know different ones they're familiar that I just got back from India here a little over a week ago and different ones praying for me and things you just want to extend our thanks for that the Prophet said that when you're praying for someone like that that you get the same reward amen is that right he was getting ready go to Palestine and he was talking about this he said those that pray for the meetings it says you it's accounted to you as well amen and he always uses the store I love the story the little the woman she she was a wast when when she saved her money up she paid up it was a baby Simpson to come preach their town she hand out tracts and one little boy showed up to the meeting amen and and you know for most people that have looked at that and said that wasn't a very good turnout or very the turn of events but that one little boy got saving the meeting was Dwight Moody and from that man millions of souls were saved and brother Graham said who gets the credit for that that woman does so your prayers are not in vain I appreciate it I appreciate the different ones that pray for my wife and family God just really blessed us with the different meetings we had I think over 60 people come flora get baptized and different ones receive the Holy Ghost a lot of different healings and some miracles I don't have time to tell Maus but since you're standing although I'll be doing that for a while anyway but I just I I think one that would suffice is a noteworthy one you know the Bible talks about the gate before a notable miracle cell I thought this was noteworthy and what was it was actually two years ago when I went and I say this because sometimes you don't know what the Lord's doing even right now you're praying for things and you don't always know what the Lord's doing and you might not even find out in this life but I believe we'll find out by and by but I think this is a good example with the language barrier and stuff there is a brother and he was in the church and he'd been in an accident and of course if you've ever been overseas you know how they drive anyway but they were in an accident there and his esophagus was completely crushed and they had him in the emergency room and they'd given one maybe two hours to live at the most because if his esophagus was crushed and so the morning service before we even had the song service they come to me and said well we won't you lead the congregation of prayer so as a congregation we prayed for that young man I didn't know what happened I I've completely forgot about it be real honest with you not that I didn't care whatever but you know just you after a while you didn't hear nothing and I got back this year and brother mother pretty said I need to tell you something and he's got my number so I don't know I waited two years but he said I need to let you know something he said when we had prayer that morning for that man and his esophagus was crushed it said the Lord healed him right there that very moment and he walked out of the hospital and so of course I was pretty excited some praise the Lord yeah praise the Lord I was happy I believe God is the same today men and so like I said people praying we don't always know even a man we don't always know but we know these faithful and if we remember that we retain that I believe that God will bless us amen and so I just wanted to share that with you and many other things the Lord did but he's a longtime God and he's the same and I believe he's not just the same in India I believe it's the same right here today whatever your need is just as the thirteenth chapter and I just want to read I'm gonna read most of the chapter here we read the first 15 verses and now Thursday when I was here on the screen there I was checking out the different things in the counters this that then there's a picture come up brother Samuel browning he had his text behind him I believe was the same chapter so I hope he didn't preach the same thing I did or at least not in recent history the date said 1996 I thought well that can't be right but I so anyhow praise the Lord I believe it'd be a blessing to you though Genesis the 13th chapter and we just asked the Lord would have preeminence this morning as we read the word it says this and Abram went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had a lot with him into the south and a place of the altar which he had made there at the first and I'll come back to this later but he come back to this first altars in there Abram called on the name of the Lord and watch what happens next and a lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them so that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abrams cattle and the Hermit of Lots cattle and the Canaanite and the perizzite dwell dwell then in the land Abraham Abram said unto lot let there be no strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herd men and I Hermon for we be brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if that will take the left hand then I will go to the right or without apart to the right hand then I will go to the left I'm brother Branham makes the point this is a this is a good Christian spirit he preferred his brother first amen and says a lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that what it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest into zou are then lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and lot journeyed East and they separated themselves the one from the other Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly verse 14 and the Lord said unto Abram and the scripture makes a point of this after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen Thursday I was talking about this idea and I've taken several thoughts on this idea of inspiration and Thursday I was talking about the inclination it's not a common word we used by the inclination the inspiration where the RAM stirs we should always have a burden for one another he says if we see indifference coming in says it's another spirit amen so we always want to have the right kind of we have the right kind of a burden that's when God could inspire us amen God actually inspires the burden and if we allow him to do with us that way he he adds to it amen so we're taking the thought of inspiration this morning I want to take a thought separation brings inspiration amen and so we look at this idea of inspiration and I I always choose to quote the Prophet at the beginning of this thought I want to remind you once again the brother Branham said that that inspired believers taking the inspired word those two together brings the results amen I don't have the quote for me but brother Brent talks about in the church age book he talks about what worship was like he moves in the Ephesian Church age in the church age book he talks about the manner of worship and how the were moved and they worshiped by the holy ghost and he says it's a far cry from what we see today where we just have a few inspired preachers preaching some of the word and the people aren't getting inspiration amen and so I just want to remind you the Word of God and this message even is inspired I believe that you can press play and hear tape and that tapes inspired today man I don't want to just press play but I want to be inspired as a preacher amen and I don't want you to be as far as a preacher I want the people to be inspired amen it's it's no good for me as a minister or a pastor to get up and have an inspiration and a vision for what he thinks that God wants to do in their life or in their church and he's poured his heart out and the people just have no care or they're indifferent toward it amen and I know you know this and I don't believe that's what I'm talking to that type of people this morning you wouldn't be here amen hopefully you didn't come here just because you wanted to be seen and heard of men but you come here because you're inspired to be here amen and so we understand that without a vision the people perish is that right so we want to be inspired by the same inspiration now and then we got to be careful about this because lots of people get the same inspiration and it's the wrong inspiration amen I want I want to remind you in Genesis chapter 11 then Ron got inspired and the people got inspired with them and I think it's marvelous at the unity of the people under a wrong inspiration was so great that God come down and looked at it and said I'm gonna go down and confound their language because nothing will be withheld from them listen if I could get everywhere on the same page under the same inspiration what could the people accomplish today then they could do that under Nimrod to build a tower trying to measure only they haven't so much that God loves attention and he confound the people's language how much more to that if we can get inspired by the Word of God the word of this hour listen I'm not trying to convince you to build a mark for me this morning so we can get about you animals on board a man I'm not trying to build a temple we're gonna build a replica art nothing like that we have the word for the day it's the it's a light amen because when the word is vindicated it's a lie Amen we don't have to live under a glare we don't have to have our own idea but if we can get that inspired by the Word of God how much greater is it then what Nimrod there what would Caesar than what Hitler was able to accomplish hey man so we want to have that kind of inspiration our life we would have fall into it we want to be led by an amen amen I believe that's what makes the difference between a person and a life it just drifts along an ordinary life with no real direction we just live from job to job or from trial to trial from paycheck to paycheck but when you get an inspiration in your life that's the thing that begins to carry you through disappointments to discourage was there trials there's something that carries you amen I look at men in the natural men have brother Brent talks about Walt Disney of all people hey man and I got inspired by a little moss that may have been rejected his comic after comic him he's looking at me like Edison and a man that he went through one after another material trying to find the film it there inspiration there was something in them when they found 10 times 20 times 30 times a hundred times yet they knew there was something about them in their life that's just in the natural if God could do that with the man in the natural with a sinner how much more that's believers see us I wrote this down I was praying about this one I was just in the Miller and I wrote this down in my book I take note Smith but I put this down I said that all men follow something and then followers follow a leader and leaders follow their vision or their ambition and then everybody's following something even the maintenance a leader he's following his ambition or his vision and how much greater if a man can catch a glimpse of the living Jesus Christ and then we're not being left by a desire that's going to to build a bigger Church or to have a greater kind of a CEO or a better job we're being led by the captain of the hearts of the army of the Lord hey man yo has come to do things that are mixed in to lead us I don't ladies desire to lead us into just a mini oh girl I say man I'm not talking on a bunch of Hollywood amen a Christian life to humble life a man she is so humble the people missed it is that Alright [Applause] it's unimportant it doesn't take away from the changed we're believing for the change in my body that it's not far [Applause] even while I'm preaching amen you said that sounds like a fanaticism listen we don't watch them pray amen we should be expecting it that should be the inspiration that gets us out of bed in the morning Bui Lera has done an Irish bit inspiration we're living in the hour of the rapture no one has been revealed [Applause] and we believe according to Scripture revelation 22 at the time of the opening of this word the time is it but at the opening of this word we're not to seal back up we're not to hide it it's been open hallelujah I hope something burns in your heart every day for a greater walk with God listen up but I tell you what different people they're inspired by different things amen different people they're looking for different things some people are looking for a bigger than sir greater that of this time I'm inspired by the idea that this world pest house is going to be quick I'll tell you what if you're getting older at all you should be inspired as well all the back pain and all the gray hairs and all the wrinkles and all the disappointments all the friends that are walked away all the things you had to deal with all the things that tried to drag you down one bin you're gonna put off this mortality that means more to me than a paycheck that means more to be popular to know that I'm gonna receive a crumb of the last jewels in saying this women it really shows you the unbelief in some people even ministries [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] obtain the excellency of Christ see the reward it's greater than the suffering I know don't seem like it some days the rewards greater than the discouragement listen if anybody complaint was Paul here's a man that was beaten he was shipwrecked he was called every kind of name in the book he wasn't hurries offerings fastings in prisons and to--let's and then he said our light affliction here he would say you are your listen I'm happy to go but I'm not satisfied to go by myself and then I want to go everyone I want our young our old I believe I got a family listen brother bear appreciate it man I'm Way off here have your attacks [Applause] listen brother Brown preaches a token message for a reason there's got to be a family out there somewhere well that whole family and that praise the Lord there's gotta be families somewhere that will fulfill that well one they take one we left I understand that a member from my house there's got to be somebody to fulfill that because God has never left himself without a witness but you some hot bad news out there yeah I live under a rock listen I come out of the world I come out of sin I know a little bit about it but let me say this I'm not impressed by the [Applause] [Music] the greater the enemy seems the greater the manifestation of God's power he says you know I'm gonna have a bride in the midst of Satan's Eden she's gonna serve me she's not gonna make guys with the separation so yeah I got home home somehow there's a separation there's something different about you than the rest of the Chaldeans there's something different about using the rest of the people in her and then we look at this man Abram he looked like everybody else hey man this is a man he's 7 years old and God calls him me God calls this man to come out of her child ear and go to Canaan a man and I just want to dwell on this for a sec because sometimes we read this thing like a newspaper and when I read this while back and the Lord was dealing with me I just thought so fast and he because the Bible doesn't tell us that God ever spoke to Abram before that maybe he did maybe he didn't I don't know huh hey man but never tell us that he spoke to him before that he doesn't even tell us how was it a dream was it a vision did he send an angel I don't know but something happened with Abram this man he was 70 years old don't ever think you're too old to serve God this man 70 years old God speaks to him in such a way I don't know what it lies about however God spoke to him it was in such a way that he left his home God speaks him one time I want you get up and guard this land and going to a land I prepared for you listen he didn't have a job recruiter waiting for him at the other end he didn't have some sort of a a GPS or Googler to get him there but a man that maybe never even heard from God before heard the voice of God and he was so convinced it was God not just an imagination not just some Idol or something else he was so convinced it was God it was such a conviction his heart he left everything listen this wasn't a young man striking out trying to find a future this is the man whose life it looked like was over seven years I can't do much more for my times about God was just now get ready I [Applause] think about how powerful this is God speaks to him and he's probably got home he's got land whatever he's gotten you know amen it may be a land or a job whatever it is and he leaves all these things because of the voice of God and yet didn't fully obey God then for some reason it was easy I say easy relatively speaking it was easier for him to leave his land and his heritage and everything you never know and I really need grown up wrong he could leave that but he couldn't leave his daddy he couldn't leave his nephew this is anymore come with you no it wasn't a bad idea no God is wanting to deal with Abram and he only called Abram a man and so as great as it was and as profound as it was that he left everything as far as his lands in his homes everything else he left all those things yet he didn't leave lot behind he didn't leave Haran behind is that right and I want you to understand that we all have different lot in life no pun intended a man we all have different Lots in life is that right now once you notice that God was calling Abram to a full separation not just a partial separation and for whatever reason that's what he that's what he presented to God amen the reason I got inspired by this actions I had a brother and he come up to me he I think he texted me after church one time or something and he and he asked me a question I think it's remarkable because many times people do this he said you know brother I've been in church for years and I've heard lots of preaching and I was here this idea we need to die to this we need to die to ourselves he says I hear that so much brother he says what does that really mean to you I thought well that's your question you know time this becomes a buzzword as we would say oh you got to die to something a man and so he's like what does that mean to you brother I begin to share with him what does the scripture say in the Bible tells us in Matthew 16 verse 24 says then jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whoever will lose his life for my sake I want to throw that in there for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited it's one of the sayings all right what is a man profited if he gains the whole world loses his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for her soul well can you offer an exchange for a soul it's worth ten thousand worlds does anybody have that kind of money in the bank anybody have that kind of righteousness daughter what you couldn't give anything they exchanged for it so if you have an opportunity to redeem it by the grace of God it's worth more than the riches of the world it's worth more than Fame which would fade away this was more than well that perishes it's worth everything because everything is worth nothing without it Luke chapter 14 verse 27 whose summer doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple now you can go to church you can listen to tapes you can quote a prophet you can be best friends with whoever but if you can't bear your cross you can't be his disciple right now and he uses the knowledge it's a familiar analogy and I will read it here it says for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest haply after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it watch this all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build was not able to finish it now notice what they do they mock it they bring her approach on the world how many ministers how many men how many women they heard this message I heard this gospel and they start out you know they didn't have any rude they sprung up fast and they they they walked a man the word it burned in their hearts and that they had maybe God really even did something in their life but yet because there was no root because they were never really sold out because they never really counted the cost one day they come to a cost they're not willing to pay see when you when you account for this cost you don't just account for the cost that you have now but yeah you know how I try to teach my children this up you know if you're gonna do something it costs $20 to do it and you're gonna build something you don't you have to have more than $20 amen because something might come up or you might have to change something amen you know it's like a builder that's why you was cut a board long cuz it's easier to cut a board short you can't can't get a board stretch it's just for background I don't know about you but any time I do I do when these projects at home and I tell you what if I made one of these videos on YouTube you'll be in watch it cuz it take up six hours change the light bulb no I'm serious maybe you can identify I'm the guy that goes to the hardware store gets everything he needs now I've kind of the cost and then I go home realize I forgot this thing so I go back again now it's six o'clock and even I forgot something else I'll just finish up tomorrow six months later I get done see there's all these costs that you don't think about sometimes some of these guys they start doing the tower wrong I got enough credit for it on that plastic you might not be it you might hit your limit not be done and when you count the costs you have to consider not just the force evil but even the things you don't perceive I'm coming to something here in a minute a man but I want you to notice it and this is where I was telling this brother I said with this is something that everybody has to do amen he says we have to take up our cross so there's nobody that's can say well I already done that because it's everyday I mean this listen this is something you're going to do every day if your lives and we live another 10 years or hundred years every day you've got to get up and take their crops a man so there's nobody here that to say well that sermon is not for me it's for all of us we all have to do it every day that was the cost we considered when we first took it up hey man I suppose where you got to take inventory every day in your life hey man we have to ask ourselves am I willing to sacrifice everything for this kingdom am I willing to lay everything aside my own ambitions my own idea whatever would be a job a family I'm not talking necessarily destroying there to get rid of it I've come that a second but are we wanting to give God first always or amen or do we get like saw work once he got blessed he forgot the Lord amen praise the Lord brother Graham says this is the power of transformation it's 1965 is it sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth to you to take your position that God has called you to is I'm sure you carry between the lines I'm saying see sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in Christ to where God has called you see but what is God doing transforming you from what you are maybe a daughter some whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of mind to obey the Word of God regardless of what the price is now and this is what I was just saying a moment ago you can separate from something that doesn't mean you have to destroy it necessarily amen I see this all the time well well I hate saying this way but even with message believers a man well this person goes to this church and then some message cherished is that so they're all just this and that we're not against the people we're gets the spirit of the organization amen then sometimes people they want to cut people off because they don't believe the same way or think the same way listen you can separate from unbelief without having to cut people off Amen I'm not out to destroy those people actually want to see them sing Boxey went to see God deal with him you really managed example with a lot he says law he says it's kind of rude saying mrs. Abraham's a silver dollar and lost just a penny and listen if allot sister penny says that's your nominal brother is that right just because he separates from lot doesn't mean he puts them to the sword he'd up trying to strum he actually saved a lot he actually stands in the gap for a lot even though he's just a penny he stands no gap for him a mint that's something you can do for him but listen Abraham he was it was more of a help and a blessing to lot once it separated listen you don't help get people saved by acting like the world hey man wait we don't want drink with him and I'll care on that limbs and they'll get saved a man man I went to one of these churches I had a family member they invited me to this church so I went one time and the pastor he preaches this two times I went there he preached the same sermon it's all about drinking a beer with your friends and tailgate party talking about Jesus I said what kind of nonsense it doesn't have anything else to preach cuz I heard this very the same thing so that society would just mingle with them that's what the Catholic Church did hey man now listen I'm not against law I'm not now to destroy law amen listen it all that lot could do is believe that Jesus Christ died for sins I say praise God I don't want to discourage him if that's what lot can do listen it's better than the barroom that's better than being out there in the world and all kinds of Filth they said back off he can't believe they let him believe that I think God I would encourage him but listen I was called a traitor separate from the lies he wants to but you calling as for me I've got a grade of college I've been called to total separation from unbelief I mean that's what Haven was called dude he had a greater calling in his life than lot amen praise the Lord like I said that man is still better off let's not get frustrated with them listen they do a lot of good things you know the hospitals in school that's all good that's fine that's good stuff buts like brother Brad said that's not what we were called to do that's not the main thing those things are all right but they leave out the gospel and that's what were called to a man I'm called to preach the word the way it was given by the original inspiration you're called to believe the same word were called to believe it that way a man just like Abram was Amen praise the Lord so we don't get frustrated with them but what we want to do is be like Abram what is our separation because if you really want to help that person if you really want to be a blessing you've got to find your position first hey man praise the Lord now listen many of us would come from different kinds of walks amen and many of us have separated from different kinds of things in our life maybe addiction maybe lost or whatever drinking whatever we come from different lives I come out of different things and we're like Abram we we heard a call and it called out we separate ourselves but this is where I'm coming to this morning many of us have left these things we believe the message we're like Abram we left that country we separated ourselves but yet there's things that we carry with us and this is why I'm coming to you this morning about inspiration it's the things that we leave off or the things that we carry with us that hinder us from hearing from God amen it's something great big things that we already did or didn't do it's the little things we carried with us this one talks separation brings inspiration why would I hear from God listen Abram went many years without hearing from God and maybe he even questioned well I've gotten the promise and I'm here I've done what I was supposed to whatever if not God was waiting for a total separation see it's one thing to be separated it's another thing to be sold out hey man hell I'm gonna bring it down now it's one thing to be said listen they separate themselves from certain things they have a separated kind of a lifestyle but they're not sold out to this gospel man we can quit our smoking we can quit our drinkin we can dress the right way will you come to church but I would really sold out it's one thing to be a separated person that's nothing to be sold out to be a prisoner to Jesus Christ were you forcing it every night you've given up every design of your own and you're just a prisoner to his word and as well many of us many Christians many message believers lack gave them all they left the Baptist Church all they started girl in the house oh they stopped smoking but where they sold out act well praise the Lord well I was taught that sir my family was this way this is how we are well this is the kind of job I have my job requires in it we hold onto little things hey man sometimes it's uh maybe it's a cousin maybe it's a fit maybe it's your family amen pray slow well listen I want my family the same I understand but you don't save them amen by mingling with the world you saved them by example you've got to create this and that living brother baby talks about she was praying for her husband comes home with them drunks listen her getting mad at them and trying to ask them that didn't do anything but because she had a sold-out life that was the power of her to redeem her husband that's the power you to redeem is there something different about you you've got a higher calling amen praise the Lord where the RAM says this and expectation 1961 just remember until Abraham fully obeyed God the blessing never come until he fully obeyed God he took his daddy along he caused trouble and then a lot finally caused trouble and a herd man and then a Suzie got separated he says he fully obeyed and when he comes follow buddies then God brought the blessing amen it's full of beatings it's looking for listen it's like I said many Christians struggle with fobian listen I've had people coming I'm not being critical but I've had people come to me maybe you can relate to this and they come to you and their deal with a certain situation there's certain things going on in their life and they say well I just don't know about his brother or what do you think and I say well it doesn't matter what I think it's what the word says and you Tom well the Bible says that's well the Prophet said this like well I don't know I'm just going off to pray about it I'm like so you didn't like my answer they were satisfied with the answer I'm thinking what's there to pray about I'd be like a man saying well you know I work a job and I just you know just the world embezzle money from my employer I'm not sure you should have pray about that it's kind of there already God kind of doesn't give me the answer wants me to go get another wife from this that why I know what the answer is it's in the word hey man you got one we don't need to do I don't know if you've got any platelets here but I'm calling you out now and then listen the word for you Provident over the answer listen we won't drop into something mysterious and serious like I tell people all the time it shows you the modern age we live in people they're always waiting for a phone call from God what what's got to call me up I wish God would speak to me I went for inspiration will God speak to me they're waiting on the phone call from God hey didn't send a letter in the mail how do you know he then told me he'd never wrote it down for 2,000 years ago for you what are you looking for an answer for these little things are little opinions well if God would tell me to stop glory hallelujah well it's about how it is in there hey man you know I'm not trying to be glib its Shula well you know I just don't know well did you consult the Prophet about it did you read the Bible amen we should comment speak to me why you don't listen to him anyway well he said my sheep know my voice they're gonna hurt it somewhere before the listener I'm not trying to whatever ah the reverse is true to get these people O God spoke to me I'm supposed to do such a thing well God never speaks unions how am i speaking it out Oh cuz you're gonna get a bigger bed count oh it's gonna give me the ministry all can give me big bad well hallelujah anyhow all right we don't we don't want to have a consecrated life but we went on the blessing it's a man but the RAM says this is always a connection with the spoken word of God God's promised for the day when it comes it's so unusual to the people can hardly grasp it we're so so deforms and ideas of our own ah why quit smoke and I quit drinking this what about your own ideas what about your family's idea of things or your church's idea or so-and-so your favorite preacher well my favorite preacher preaches it this way well praise God I'm all for the freedom of speech but this is preaching I want to see if he's preaching what the word says listen if I didn't tell you something conquer the Prophet I don't want you to believe me I know that sounds weird but it's a church thing man I want you to believe the Word of God that's my goal my goal not creator hey my words but to hang on every word of God and if I can get inspired by the sea where I believe you hear the same God amen my desire is not to present my own idea as if it were the gospel truth and yet so many times that's what we do to ourselves I was just born this way well I just raised this way what's that have to do with anything we're so so darf to forms and ideas of our own it's hard for us to grasp what is the truth see we get attached to things don't we we get attached to things listen Abram I understand he was attached to his father's and his wife was it says the same father amen they were attached to him they were attached a lot and I understand that in the natural but yeah that was the thing that was hindering them from hearing from God see he counted the cost of leaving the promises well I'm gonna have to give a house offered you a plan that's how I'm gonna find them what about this part that's the part you didn't want to factor into the cost amen praise the Lord I think about this when God calls Abraham one day he'd begin to speak to him because notice he speaks to him afterwards is that right what's he do he goes back and he finds the altar where he left God and after he does that God causes something to happen and he speaks to him and got a speaking to him and he gives me some by the name of Isaac and one day God tests him again hey man cuz he knows how he's attached his family he knows how he's longed for this son listen this is what Abraham did for 25 years he sounds like no saw ups and boots and and go get a crib ready we're gonna have a son named Isaac his whole Hulk his ambition was in this thought that God has spoken to him I love you I'm gonna raise up nations in your loins as kings I've made promises to Abraham his life I'm gonna give him a child I believe Allah promised and God blesses him because God is faithful and one day after I think eight years or whatever it is God calls me says I want you to take Isaac I'm gonna test you again I want you to take the Isaac I want you to take him up on the Mount I want you to offer him as a sacrifice and this is why I say this and I hope you follow where I'm going with this I want you to notice that God did not tell Abraham to take the Isaac up when he was three days old he said what do you mean by that he waits penny wait till you get some real attacks to him listen brother Brad pump up their offering the Old Testament they get that they get their favorite pet they get whatever they used to offer as a sacrifice he said someone become a family tradition and they weren't offering their best anymore they'll get attached they'd gotten comfortable with a certain kind of life as long as they were comfortable that life God couldn't deal with them but as long as a man was comfortable with his nephew and his daddy and a bunch of blessings God couldn't speak to what he wanted to mrs. long as he was happy with Isaac and it was just all about Isaac God couldn't really deal with him the way he wanted to hey Madison so he lets him go and he takes a little Isaac and he sees there's a little baby he stares at his face oh it looks just like his daddy I'm a beautiful little baby boy I didn't think it was possible got many young again God give me a little boy and he holds that child in his arms day after day thinking about how God is blessed and thinking about this child the little boy needs to grow up but he's playing in the yard and here he is with the servants working he says you take care of the business for a few moments and he go and play with his little chap cause he's younger you do that again go play this little child running through the field little Isaac falling down skinned his knee it was Abraham he was there to pick up Isaac and wipe his tears and tell me gonna be alright we'll pray for you you'll be okay when Isaac was waiting for his mother when I began to ride a horse when I was in begin to learn all these things it was a bruh Abraham was at her loving every moment of it this is my baby this is my boy now now God speaks to him you really love him don't you oh I love him more than the world it means so much to me I never knew I could be so happy I never knew I could be so blessed what's the offer was a sacrifice what place do we give God he begins to bless us a good church a good family a good job good health we still give God first place hey man I'm speaking for myself we gotta do it every day hey man listen God hey man I'm not counting the cost listen when I come to the Lord I was a wretch I think I own three changes of clothes I had an old jump car I live in the park I had nothing to give the Lord listen it's very easy to give your life to the Lord I mean you've got nothing to lose I had nothing to offer and he took me in listen that's easy and really almost have anything today still but we think we do we come in this world was nothing is that right but it was so easy for me to surrender fully to the Lord when I had nothing to offer to surrender hardly but my own well but listen God give me a home glass must meet with a wife that I love is but before wonderful children I love them doing now can you still pay the price are you still missing I just talked about going over neither I don't like going overseas it's not that I you know just like people or anything like that listen I like my home I have my own bed I like it hey man I got my own pillow I got my own stuff got my own shower my own toothbrush got my own house my own vehicle I got my children there I don't like leaving them behind I don't enjoy one that some guys probably do but I don't like leavin though I would all like leaving my children behind and every year my wife will tell you seems like it's harder and harder every year every nurse is she here I go through the same spiel huh maybe I shouldn't go this year maybe this to be my last time well maybe will be maybe it won't it's not up to me and I like to think it is but it's really not it's true I'd like to think well you know if I it's not up to me if he come here right now and said I want you to go to Timbuktu guess what how sold out am i listen he's not even often I said I got off it was a sacrifice like that I just don't wanna leave him for two weeks but yeah it's not about you know what it is we think well I I can retain I can do something there's nothing you can do listen I think was Martin Luther and he said I've held many things in my hands in my life and I've not held on to any one of them hey man all the things I've ever hung on I'm not hold on anything right now I've never had power to hold a woman I can't retain my children I can't retain my wife but he said everything that I've ever put in God's hands I've never lost a man I'll go over there brother Brown he goes I'm cousins I don't think he enjoys leaving either he enjoys leaving the church he enjoys in America but there's a burden Eman because there's a need somewhere I've got a calling in my life and I have to account for yes the comfort able dress account for the calling in his life are you willing to lay everything down to be the friend of God I give in Isaac I give you a blessing and give you riches I give all these things are you willing to lay them down for me the one they give him to you listen Abram he didn't just lay it on Isaac everything to just offer him up you know what he did it he have an expectation he said God wanted me to promise to me for my seat government promised to you as well and then God made a promise for my child the in him my seat would be called and he had an expectation if I go up there and if I offer him up I will see him raise again listen I do overseas I leave behind my home I leave behind I'm not even trying to compare myself to Abraham I thought even the same but I leave these things behind because I have an expectation expectation that I'm going to see God do something only God can do Abraham an expectation that God was giving you something only he could do only he could raise the dead only God can heal crush the Sun only God can give the Holy Ghost I can't do these things but I know vacations but the family and the life that I've committed his hands he's more able to keep the when I'm absent the line when I'm present I'm not one of these preachers that thinks I made we're having to sacrifice my family for the ministry I don't think God called me to do that either hey man some of these some people they're all over the place a man I believe and take care of your house amen but listen we can we can never let a spouse a child a job whatever take first place from the Lord and when we do that that's when we find God doesn't speak to me like he used to I wonder why he's waiting for you to separate for a long time since I heard from the Lord looking for a separation in your life that you haven't made yet because once you separate from everything else peak to you hey man like I said I can look back to the time Abram can look back time we can look back to the time our life when we separated we knew we were giving everything to the Lord and God called us out listen that was okay for 13 years ago can I do the same thing today now listen you just still be blessed that right look Abram had silver and he had gold had great lands that right but when there was a famine of land the first seed was run out of the promised land he left the blasting hey man but I praise God you know why because when he went back where did he go - he went to the place he'd first blessed the Lord he went to the same office he built when he first come to the land and he rededicated himself and listen when you rededicate yourself like he did God will bring a separation look what was the very next thing that happened after he comes that altar God wrote a separation between Lots herdsmen and his listen got a lot of trials sometimes got a lot separates until lesson sometimes they're coming just because he's trying to get your attention he's trying to get you to separate under him amen where is he at he's where you left him listen I prayed I prayed for a man here some time ago this is a man and I've just I just give you the testimony in short a little bit but this is the man he'd been going to church and and he'd been raised around the message he knew better and I was at work one day years ago I was at work one day years ago and I was praying and my wife sent me a text said that this person's been in an accident I thought something with work or whatever and I didn't know what it was 'awesome Lord showed me I saw him in his truck and he's sitting there and he just gets he goes like this I didn't know what it was come to find out what had happened was he was he was on the side there on his truck talking to somebody he thought was broke down and somebody rear-end just pick up at 55 miles an hour and I saw I saw this happen before I knew what the accent was about it's not and I begin to pray about it and they had him in the hospital they life fighting they give him two days to live and I was praying about it at work before I knew the prognosis before I knew anything and the Lord told me he won't die but he's going to live and they're up at the hospital praying they're getting ready from the die and I text the brother that's addicted to church and said the Lord showed me he's not gonna die is gonna live he walked out of the hospital two days later he was supposed to be paralyzed the rest of his life that sounds good that sounds great but you know what happened he got a bunch of insurance money and he back slid he went and bought this he went and did that and the next thing you know he doesn't left his wife he doesn't there are all these things I got to place I was so discouraged alertly but better I'm dying why not pray about it but I believe was a purpose in it amen this same man I was a different Church and he was at this church just a few weeks back and he'd come in and he'd had different issues and this that he'd run from it and different things and he found out I believe he's got cancer some sort of cancer and he'd come up at the end of the service after the service is over and I was getting ready to walk out in the office this that he couldn't said I want you to pray with me he said I need to get right with the Lord and I got down I begin to pray with that man I said nice I quoted what I just quoted you a few moments ago brother Brennan said that he's where you left him I said do you remember when you left him at and I knew where he left about he said I left him that night well that accident happened that's where I left him at I said I know he's been back there waiting for you the whole time I said you left him there and there's something else you're still there you've gone on and you've continued of your life and yeah everything you've done everything's ever happen to you you never really left that moment you rolled it over in your mind and every day you're like in the bathtub it has consumed you and it's destroyed you you've destroyed a home your health your family your fight everything is gone you left him behind I said I believe he's still there and he's waiting for you right now we got down we begin to pray listen many of us we live back that our consecration we can look back to time God did something our life and we're still living there 20 years later hey y'all got quiet many of us never moved beyond a certain point in their life Abram never got beyond a certain point in his life till he separated Foley he come his promised land he been blessed but God never dealt with that man again until a lot was removed from him separation where the RAM says this amen that's what I'm gonna come to this have we gotten so used to living in our promise and her blessings that we've learned to live without the voice of God we learned to code well I'm doing all right I'm getting by I don't need to hear from God I'm doing all right we need to hear from God more now today then we did that night we give our life to the Lord then we did last week we need to hear from him more let's not learn to just live without it prophet says this he says this is the sermon once more timeout Sam ceases notice the church today is not willing to pay the price he said Sampson prayed the right kind of prayer Lord let me with the enemy oh my there you are you don't want to die to your pride amen this is you don't want to die there the things work let me say this before I finish the quote if you can die to your pride you can died anything I'm affirmative that's that's that's where people get hung well I can't give up in this and I can't get it's because you're too proud hey man because God said you can give it up if God said it I believe it and then that's your pride that says well I can go on this way this nut you can die to your own pride you can die to anything I believe that well praise the Lord since you don't want to die to your friend you don't want to die there things well now remember I'm talking to literally thousands around the world what I'm saying see I love to speak here in Chicago I'm speaking out the world you don't want to die but that's the only way there's a possibility for rioting well in resurrection language nobody wants to die they can't have a resurrection without a death he says this you know what he died that's the only way there's a possibility revival you're blinded Sampson can't you see that Delilah has blinded your eyes the only way you'll ever be able to bring back the strength to the church is to die to the enemy that's got you in this worldly ism being worldly is more than just oh I'm smoking drinking it's any time we attach ourselves the things of this of this world over the Lord Amen Sampson I said let me die with the enemy there is a great price to pay as you count the cost this afternoon as I'm preaching I'm gonna be real honest with you there's a great price to pay it might not seem like there's a great entry the entry fee you seem free well there's a great price to pay in our life the state consecrate there's a great price in our life to continue to walk with the Lord every day it's the free gift that costs everything you say well that's a lot to pay well he paid it he thought was worth it to pay it for you and who arena steaming lighter value than he did if he thought you were worth it then I believe the land is worthy to receive the reward of his suffering hey man you know there's a great price to pay you must die to the thing that brought you into this thing you must die the thing that brought you you Pentecostal people to where you are this afternoon you've got to die to it Samson was willing to pay the prize oh my he was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back in his life again hey man Simmons can talk about the power of God that wonder he once knew this man was willing to pay the price to see it once more he said on one of the churches this have been willing to pay the price and die with the enemy the thing all your popularity and all your this that another just to see the power of God back on you again and become a prisoner of Jesus Christ hey man listen I've told you testimony this morning I think God for those testers and they God for the testimony of the prophets meaning many you have testimonies but what God has done in your life supernatural things powerful things things that only God can you know I'm so grateful for those things but this morning I'm not satisfied just to look back and see what he's done if I've got the diary everything and I've got to offer everything up just to see him do it one more time just to seal in the sanctuary just to see him glorified like he's been alone once more [Music] I'm willing to pay everything to see it one more time oh yeah if I've got to give up everything oh it's easy to say that I know willing to offer everything sacrifice everything I thought I am to hear from God one more time I want to go back that same Walter I was at the beginning and offer up sacrifice and calling the name of the Lord just to hear him speak one more time see you'll never understand that to get through a famine he just come out of a famine he realized you know what I'm doing isn't working anymore it's not working anymore I need another direction from God there's something left on them I need to hear his voice again merely that man could do they he didn't even really realize it maybe we don't even realize sometimes but you know he did he went back to that first altar and he rededicated himself and he called the Lord and the Lord brought to pass need to hear from him one more time I need to see the power of God in my life that's what Samson said that's what the quote says now that somebody else's life I think God I think God for ministers then I'm going to preach this I think God for men and women daughters and sons of God they've gotta answer the prayer but I one more time come across come on I'm not built to live without hearing the voice of the shepherd I'm not content just to live in the pasture I always lived there but if my Shepherds gone by green waters and he's taking me beside still waters I don't want to follow his voice when he caught on the name of the Lord God brought a separation listen I don't believe after coincidence that Suzie got done calling the name Lord Oh Lots herdsmen just I just don't believe it's a coincidence maybe you believe in coincidence maybe you don't I don't know hopefully they don't but for a believer there's no coincidence in my life because all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose listen it maybe didn't help a lot out but it held Abram but there's many things that happen in this life many things that take place and I'm everybody gonna be blessed by everything but if you're the call black Abraham if your call God will make it work to your purpose to his purpose hey man there's no coincidence it's no accident you're not here by an accident you're not some cosmic mishap your life every footstep every footfall every down city every uprising was foreordained by God we think we can go out without hearing his voice and I can't get to this church without a GPS some of these old preachers man I hear these stories they're driving here this thing and I'm about God call me in this age I'm too stupid to figure out what's going than the other age hey man I need direction we need direction and if we would need direction in the natural how do we think we're gonna make it through the darkness of language to see you with our own understanding hey you can't make it down the street with your own understanding his word is a laugh cuz your feet it's a light to your path I believe his word is not I don't believe it's just bottled up in this book I believe it's in a people I believe that they that are the sons of God they're led by the spirit they're led every day like I say I said all the time but the bible scripture says they are continually led he is always leading us he's always directing us if we could just listen we can just be sold out amen look if we're not gonna listen to no one who don't speak to us he doesn't need a babe hey man he needs a Moses needs a Joshua he needs a Caleb he needs some it's one to go that Promised Land it don't matter what it looks like he's not laying there what kind of obstacles he wants somebody's gonna follow him regardless of the cost hey man you're all believers where's the safest place she can be and the will ago that matter about typhoons and persecutions and go in the will of God look you can't lose 1/2 through your head praise the Lord stand our feet oh my well I believe I believe this is something that we can all relate to something that pertains to all of us but I really just want to challenge for just a moment as I set the end or attitude we willing to lay down pay the price to make a sacrifice that's required to hear from God or we just content to be a churchgoer your message believer play tapes at home read your buck that's all good that's fine but I believe that the same God that speaks through those things and then there's things in your life places you're gonna go people you're going to talk to we need the inspiration listen I can sit there and I can try to to witness to somebody and I can try to give them information I can try to beat it into don't I've done that before it don't work but if the Lord lay something Hart just text a certain person or call over pray for him go talk to certain just uh just just one word from the Lord that's so much more powerful than a whole sermon I could preach in my own intellect you know what I'm talking about how many times do we as I was saying Thursday miss that opportunity because we're not really attentive to the voice of God how many times do we falter like Abram like Abraham in our own strength because we're not really sold out like we're supposed to be I believe there's an altar of rededication I believe it worked for Abraham I believe it works for us Amen you're never too spiritual you're never too old and they were too young to worry just call on the Lord Lord ah I don't know I'm in this situation even I don't know how I got here this isn't where I thought I was gonna be this isn't what I thought I was gonna make the things I done made a mess of it I've got all kinds of issues it seems like I'm worse off than I was before you could call on the Lord he can take that mess bring a separation he can take that problem and speak to you through that problem the very thing it's challenging the very thing that's upsetting you he can speak you through that I believe he wants to speak to us amen let's let's speak to him for just a moment as we bow our heads Oh Lord Lord I I've been guilty at times we all have if we're honest of missing the leadership of your voice holding to our own ideas getting things in our minds I'm not consulting with you like we are Lord some of us we we can look back to that see your your mercy towards us Lord my great concern today is some of us have taken that immediate a lifestyle a life absent of hearing the voice of God because we're no longer seeking your face like we ought to we're no longer laying everything down we're no longer willing to pay the prize to count the cost somewhere in our prosperity our blessing we grew to live absent of your direction Lord I pray if there'd be one here today that finds himself in that place they find them some of the need the Lord may they come now to that alter their heart normally they call upon your name Lord may you bring a separation father I desire today I think he's one of us Lord we could just lift our hand say Lord I don't want a closer walk with you I want a greater consecration I want to be more yielded to you I want to have a greater witness in my life Lord may you help your children help that one maybe there's a word father to rededicate themselves to you Lord speak to us I pray like you've never spoken before mainly be such a conviction in our heart of the word that you've spoken Lord would take us from our lands take us from homes take us from our own thinking and our own livelihood to wherever you'd have for us to be lead us into the realms of the supernatural that mighty kingdom of God the land flowing with milk and honey father may you bear witness and we let it down every pride
