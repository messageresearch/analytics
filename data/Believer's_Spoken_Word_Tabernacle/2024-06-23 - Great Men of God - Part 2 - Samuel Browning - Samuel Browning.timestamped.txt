[36:35] thought there was absolutely nothing
[36:37] when I went to bed last night and but

[36:56] it's not us that brings the rain right
[36:58] amen he the Bible said he would come to
[37:02] us as the rain that's right so his
[37:05] coming is as the rain and God knows what
[37:08] you and I what we have need of and amen
[37:10] we're not the ones who make that happen
[37:12] but I want to be in a place to receive
[37:15] it amen and just to just to absorb it so

[37:37] and uh amen and sister Michelle God
[37:40] bless you good to have you here with us

[37:49] broader but um amen it's good to be here
[37:52] we're going to have a a dedicate little
[37:55] Brooks to the Lord amen and what
[37:57] wonderful time also want to say it's
[37:59] good to have brother Bob right here with
[38:00] us this morning God bless you brother
[38:01] Bob good to have you amen sister ogga
[38:04] God bless you amen am good to have you
[38:06] here with us
[38:08] amen amen hallelujah amen so I want to
[38:14] read a a scripture before I we have them
[38:17] to come and uh it's out of Matthew
[38:20] chapter 19 and verse 13 very
[38:23] familiar uh portion of scripture but the
[38:27] the Bible says then were there brought
[38:29] unto him little children that he should
[38:31] put his hands on them and pray and the
[38:37] disciples rebuked them but Jesus said
[38:41] suffer little children and forbid them
[38:43] not to come unto me for of such is the
[38:47] kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands
[38:51] on them and departed
[38:53] F I think that's the desire of every one
[38:56] of us as parents is that God has
[39:01] entrusted us with the life or lives that
[39:04] he's given us but by placing them back
[39:07] into his hands Lord you're the one who
[39:10] knows the whole order of their life you
[39:14] know the plan just like when God came
[39:16] and spoke to Samson's parents and I
[39:19] thought it was just to me as always that
[39:21] that partion has always been something
[39:23] that stood out to me to where that when
[39:26] monoa told his wife asked the angel to
[39:29] come again and when he came remember
[39:34] asked ask him to come again and when he
[39:36] came I thought of how that manoah asked
[39:39] him he
[39:40] says show us of how we're to order the
[39:44] lad's life because God's got a purpose
[39:48] that's good we're not here and we
[39:49] realize within our lives it's not just
[39:51] something haphazard we're doing even as
[39:54] we dedicate little Brooks to the Lord
[39:56] you know that's a that's a real solemn
[39:58] commitment when we do when we dedicate a
[40:01] baby that's just not that's just not
[40:03] something we do that well that's just
[40:06] part of what they do at this church or
[40:07] what that that's not it at all it's a
[40:10] it's an actual just like when a person
[40:12] is baptized in the name of the Lord
[40:14] Jesus Christ that ain't just something
[40:15] we do it's
[40:17] scriptural they never one time in the
[40:20] scriptures ever ever sprinkled an infant
[40:23] this is the scripture he had they put
[40:25] him they put the baby into his hands
[40:29] they they they committed it to his hands
[40:31] so we're not we're making a declaration
[40:33] that God with everything that is within
[40:36] me as you've given this life then I've
[40:39] entrusting it back to you and with all
[40:42] that is within me as I stand to dedicate
[40:45] this baby to you I dedicate myself aresh
[40:48] that in everything that your will would
[40:51] be done that in every area that the word
[40:54] itself would be followed in order for
[40:57] this promise to take in effect you
[41:01] believe that amen amen I think of when
[41:03] Joseph he brought Ephraim and
[41:06] Manasseh it's all scripture amen he
[41:09] brought them there to Israel praise God
[41:12] and you remember what happened when he
[41:14] put the the the firstborn on the right
[41:16] hand and he put there of the second on
[41:20] the left but
[41:21] God when he brought him the hands were
[41:25] crossed remember Joseph said no no dad
[41:27] you you got it you got it
[41:29] wrong but Jacob told him and said I
[41:32] didn't do this
[41:34] Glory God has done
[41:36] this you see it was through the cross
[41:40] the blessing has come to you and
[41:43] I amen what was what was intended for
[41:47] the Jews and they're going to get their
[41:48] visitation they're they're going to
[41:50] receive that revelation of what Calvary
[41:52] has meant to them they're going to
[41:54] receive the revelation of the true Lamb
[41:57] of God they're going to receive their
[41:59] their visitation it's it's on the way
[42:01] it's very imminent but to think I love
[42:05] how Joseph said it he
[42:07] said the angel that Redeem Me redeem The
[42:12] Lads also Hallelujah the same one that
[42:15] has done the work that delivered that's
[42:18] good me that's right deliver
[42:21] them amen and that the name of God be
[42:25] blessed through their life
[42:27] lives I can think of no greater thing
[42:30] when we stand here to dedicate little
[42:33] Brooks any child to the Lord amen
[42:36] there's no greater thing and no greater
[42:38] witness we can do than to put the life
[42:42] into the hands of God amen amen aren't
[42:46] you thankful that God's watching
[42:49] over he's watched over your life he's
[42:52] watched over my life he's brought us
[42:53] right to where we're at right now it's
[42:55] not by chance that you're here God has
[42:59] so ordered and even how that you are the
[43:02] Bible said fearfully and wonderfully
[43:04] made God's made you the way he has for a
[43:08] purpose and now only thing we have to do
[43:11] is just yield to him he's the one
[43:15] that'll operate through all of that
[43:16] through our lives God don't want us to
[43:19] all be the same he's made us unique in a
[43:23] certain way to get a certain thing that
[43:26] his glory might flow through our lives
[43:29] amen so as we dedicate little Brooks to
[43:32] the Lord I'd like to invite even the
[43:33] grandparents if they' come on up and

[48:39] Sunday school kids the things the

[48:50] going to resume uh not sister Lily but

[49:06] [Applause]
[49:11] done let's stand and let's go to the
[49:14] word of the Lord
[49:20] and just want to say I I thank you for
[49:24] our prayers and we had just some time
[49:27] just to rest and just to do
[49:30] nothing uh I'm not really one I don't
[49:33] really like myself Vacations or when you
[49:36] come back and you realize you've run
[49:38] here and run there now that's just me I
[49:40] you know there might be a little
[49:41] something to see but I I don't it was
[49:44] just good just to sit and uh just drink
[49:47] coffee and just to
[49:50] rest so I just appreciate uh that and
[49:55] then I I understood um when brother
[49:57] Brandon I haven't got a chance to listen
[49:59] to it all but I thought my this is
[50:01] different he's preaching on
[50:07] job but just just I I want to listen to
[50:10] all of it but what a what a wonderful uh
[50:14] service and I really um I really
[50:16] appreciate brother Brandon coming and
[50:18] taking the service here um I I was
[50:22] didn't just you know even when I have
[50:24] someone to come I don't just have people
[50:26] to come
[50:27] um I I want I want hearts and lives that
[50:30] have been a blessing to the people and
[50:32] what I have on my heart and um brother
[50:35] Brandon he I think he shared with you
[50:37] he's been through quite a journey um it
[50:40] was quite a journey and I had told him
[50:42] throughout the times I kept letting him
[50:43] know we're praying for you we're
[50:46] standing with you and that's been quite
[50:48] quite a journey but we thank God for his
[50:50] faithfulness and I thought it was just
[50:52] wonderful that uh brother Brandon to be
[50:54] able to stand here and to share that um
[50:57] with us let's go to we have Proverbs
[50:59] Chapter 20 I don't know if I told you
[51:01] that but I want to go back in here and I
[51:05] want to speak on the family here once
[51:08] again this morning and I'd like to
[51:10] continue the thought if God will help us
[51:14] um try to you can never really bring
[51:17] anything to a close but I want to just
[51:20] try to capitalize upon that here this
[51:23] morning in Proverbs chapter 20 and verse
[51:27] 5 counsel in the heart of man is like
[51:32] deep water but a man of understanding
[51:35] will draw it out most men will Proclaim
[51:39] everyone his goodness but a faithful man
[51:43] who can find the just man walketh in his
[51:49] integrity and his children are blessed
[51:51] after him I I want you to notice that
[51:53] verse the just man walketh in his
[51:57] Integrity his children are blessed after
[52:01] him and then in verse 29 the glory of
[52:05] young men is their
[52:07] strength and the beauty of old men is
[52:11] the gray head and so we just want to
[52:14] look here once again this morning at
[52:17] that on Great Men of God man we just
[52:21] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[52:22] prayer and maybe you have a request on
[52:25] your heart God knows
[52:27] amen I know there's been many requests
[52:28] for different needs and healing but
[52:31] whatever the need is let's just commit
[52:33] it to the Lord in prayer and let's just
[52:35] invite him to come Heavenly Father Lord
[52:39] we are so thankful for your mercy Lord
[52:42] with us once again Lord we're grateful
[52:45] Lord that we have a place that we can
[52:47] come and we can gather Lord in the word
[52:50] of God and Lord we're just Lord looking
[52:53] to you that you would just come Among Us
[52:56] and very special way this morning once
[52:58] again lord it's where we look to you
[53:02] it's not anything Lord that we are
[53:04] trying to do or create father but we
[53:07] just Lord desire to so yield Lord of our
[53:10] lives and our hearts to you and father
[53:13] that God you would just speak to us Lord
[53:15] in a way that would be fitting Lord
[53:17] father to the present needs and
[53:19] ministering to our lives Lord you know
[53:22] every Lord every heart Lord and father
[53:25] we certainly believe that God the word
[53:27] of God holds within it father oh God the
[53:31] power Lord to transform Lord so father
[53:34] may your presence just come Among Us
[53:36] Lord and take Lord under your control
[53:39] every situation Lord father we give our
[53:42] thoughts to you we give all that we are
[53:44] to you Lord that you might have your way
[53:47] father Lord in our midst Lord and God
[53:50] when it's all said and done May me be
[53:52] able to say that it was good to be Lord
[53:55] here in the Pres presence of God and
[53:57] that our lives have been affected and
[53:59] influenced Lord by the glory of God we
[54:03] commit Lord this day Lord in this Lord's
[54:06] service into your hands now in the name
[54:08] of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you
[54:12] as you're being
[54:13] seated I I want to read just a
[54:17] portion in looking at this on uh Great
[54:20] Men of God and I want to look at a
[54:23] portion here where we read just to kind
[54:25] of get our thoughts in out of a Psalm of
[54:29] Life and you're aware that brother
[54:31] Branham would refer to this Psalm of
[54:33] Life over and over as a matter of fact
[54:35] brother brand said it was it was his
[54:37] favorite and um it's something that was
[54:40] written back clear back in the uh later
[54:43] 1800s by Henry wodsworth Longfellow but
[54:47] it deals with that of a of a real
[54:49] purpose and a direction that would be
[54:51] given to that of a young man and I'm not
[54:54] going to uh read NE necessarily all of
[54:57] it but I'm going to read uh just parts
[54:59] of it I'd like to begin if I could Those
[55:03] whom Brianna's on the slides I'd like to
[55:05] begin at I think it's the fifth stanza
[55:07] it says in the world's broad field of
[55:09] battle and uh you know before that all
[55:12] the the previous stanzas here uh um
[55:15] Longfellow is putting forth that there's
[55:18] a purpose in life and that's something
[55:21] that should be the desire of every of
[55:24] every young person and those things some
[55:26] sometimes in a in a time in a day that
[55:28] we're living in and it's not there are
[55:31] certain things that are peculiar to the
[55:33] day that we're living in where we have
[55:36] to be uh be in such a place to where
[55:38] that Satan let me say it this way Satan
[55:41] is no longer operating in just a subtle
[55:44] disguised way he's out in the open um
[55:47] the word of God has taken the covering
[55:50] off of him but it's in such a time in
[55:53] this hour that where Satan is moving in
[55:56] such a way that I believe it's an hour
[55:58] that we are to be as the children of God
[56:01] very intentional in the things that
[56:03] we're doing and so when we look at this
[56:06] purpose that that as a young man or that
[56:08] in any of our Lives it should always be
[56:11] of a purpose that what God what purpose
[56:14] do you have for my life Lord the reason
[56:16] that you have saved me and Raised Me Up
[56:19] and and brought me to where I am and
[56:21] Longfellow starts in with this in the
[56:23] world's broad field of battle in the ABC
[56:27] of Life be not like dumb driven cattle
[56:31] be a hero in The Strife trust no future
[56:35] however pleasant and let the dead past
[56:37] bury its dead act in the living present
[56:42] heart within and God overhead lives of
[56:46] Great Men all remind us that we can make
[56:49] our lives Sublime and departing leave
[56:52] behind us footprints on the sands of
[56:55] time
[56:56] footprints that perhaps another sailing
[57:00] over life solom man a forlorn and
[57:03] shipwreck brother seeing shall take
[57:06] heart again let us then be up and doing
[57:10] with a heart for any faint still
[57:13] achieving still pursuing learn to labor
[57:17] and to wait I I think those are just
[57:21] beautiful words I I could stand behind
[57:23] the the prophet of God and say that's
[57:25] abs absolutely those are wonderful words
[57:28] and a direction that is given that God
[57:31] would bring to make known his purpose to
[57:33] us and bring discernment in our lives if
[57:36] there's one thing that we must have in
[57:38] this life we must have discernment and
[57:42] I'll tell you in order to have
[57:43] discernment I'm talking about something
[57:45] that's greater than our mental abilities
[57:48] because there you can have discernment
[57:50] within your reasonings and knowing this
[57:52] is this to do this and not to do that
[57:56] but it's going to take more than just
[57:58] our ability to reason it will take a
[58:00] discernment that is comes by the spirit
[58:03] of God that's why Paul could write in
[58:06] the book of Hebrews and say strong meat
[58:08] belong it to them that are full age who
[58:11] have their senses exercise to discern
[58:14] good from Evil because we're living in a
[58:17] day and age that CS good evil and evil
[58:20] good we're living in an hour that was
[58:23] prophesied where it's a time and an age
[58:25] and and it's not people it's the spirits
[58:28] that have come in to this generation
[58:31] just like it was in the days of Noah the
[58:33] Bible said that the Earth was filled
[58:36] with violence through them there were
[58:39] individuals that became channels or
[58:41] portals that came under the influence of
[58:45] those evil spirits and all of that began
[58:48] to be manifested upon the Earth but
[58:51] there was also a man by the name of Noah
[58:55] and he himself became a channel that
[58:58] righteousness might be displayed upon
[59:01] the Earth and so God has always had a
[59:04] witness he's always had a standard that
[59:07] he can raise as the Bible said when the
[59:10] enemy would come in like a flood God
[59:13] will raise a standard against it how
[59:15] does God raise his standard what is
[59:17] God's standard his standard is his word
[59:20] how does God make his word sure well he
[59:22] spoke it in the beginning but then that
[59:25] word itself God came and he manifested
[59:28] that word that he already spoke that
[59:30] that's what the coming of the Lord Jesus
[59:32] was he was a manifestation of the word
[59:36] that had been spoken clear from the
[59:38] Garden of Eden that I will give thee a
[59:41] seed and it shall bruise the head of the
[59:43] serpent and all the other Messianic
[59:45] promises that were that were made and
[59:48] that were given and then that word
[59:50] became the living standard inside of a
[59:53] group of people when the Holy Ghost was
[59:56] poured out it became the word living
[59:59] itself inside of the people that's how
[1:00:02] God makes it sure he has raised it the
[1:00:05] prophet said three times already there's
[1:00:08] no way no greater way for God to make
[1:00:11] his word more sure in your life than by
[1:00:14] the Holy Spirit God's word coming into
[1:00:17] your life and then your life through
[1:00:20] your life it becomes a standard the word
[1:00:23] itself is actually manifested
[1:00:26] so when we look at this we need that
[1:00:29] discernment of the Holy Spirit within
[1:00:31] this hour we're not made to be as dumb
[1:00:33] driven cattle we're not made to go along
[1:00:36] with everything of the world and come
[1:00:38] under the influences of the world but we
[1:00:41] are are set apart by God and what God
[1:00:44] has called you and I to there's a
[1:00:46] purpose that burns in our heart so when
[1:00:49] I'm looking at this here on a great man
[1:00:51] and great men of God that we recognize
[1:00:54] that in the book of ecclesiast is verse
[1:00:56] one of chapter 7 it says a good name is
[1:01:00] better than precious ointment now now we
[1:01:03] understand you know I remember when I
[1:01:04] taught school you know there would be
[1:01:06] things that we would have things on the
[1:01:08] list and you would have names on the
[1:01:10] list and sometimes I didn't recognize
[1:01:12] the first name but I knew the surname
[1:01:14] cuz I'd already had enough of maybe that
[1:01:17] family in my class I already and I would
[1:01:20] want to know how is the connection with
[1:01:22] this particular family is this connected
[1:01:25] with this same you know uh a grouping
[1:01:28] because I we' already had dealings and I
[1:01:30] knew you know kind of the way things
[1:01:32] were come once in a while you'd be
[1:01:33] shocked you might get a sweet one you
[1:01:35] know that would come your way but you
[1:01:37] know there would be things like that you
[1:01:39] could hear a person's name and they
[1:01:41] might say a certain thing and I think I
[1:01:42] shared this with you before when Paul
[1:01:45] when when God brought Paul along I had
[1:01:47] already uh declared I said I I want to
[1:01:49] name him James the want to name after
[1:01:51] you know after my dad and and then the
[1:01:53] middle name to be Paul but it happened
[1:01:56] that year I had a boy named James in our
[1:01:58] class that guy was a thief and a liar I
[1:02:02] mean I'm telling you he could steal you
[1:02:03] blind I'm I'm serious it it wasn't
[1:02:06] anything where you just look at and say
[1:02:08] oh oh I I know I I caught you no this
[1:02:10] guy he was good at it I mean he he was
[1:02:13] good I don't know how his skills had
[1:02:15] been H had been honed in but it had come
[1:02:17] to such a place and what I'm trying to
[1:02:19] say is is that sometimes we can hear a
[1:02:22] name that is mentioned and we think oh
[1:02:24] my so what is the surname and then when
[1:02:27] we hear that Sur oh okay yeah thank
[1:02:29] goodness it's not it's not the James
[1:02:31] that I'm thinking about but you
[1:02:33] recognize because what we're talking
[1:02:35] about here is not just that name but
[1:02:38] it's what the character remember At The
[1:02:41] Mention Of that name that's why At The
[1:02:43] Mention Of The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[1:02:46] there is a character that is manifested
[1:02:49] to you it's not just a name but it is
[1:02:52] the character and the life that is
[1:02:55] spoken when we speak the name of Jesus
[1:02:59] Christ it is a character and this is why
[1:03:02] when the scripture would tell us it the
[1:03:04] good name a character is better than
[1:03:08] precious ointment this is why when the
[1:03:11] prophet would say God is searching for
[1:03:13] real man he said I don't mean how big
[1:03:15] his muscles are man is never judged by
[1:03:18] his muscles that's a brute man is judged
[1:03:21] by character I've seen man that weighed
[1:03:24] 200 lb and solid MUSC and didn't have an
[1:03:27] ounce of man in him and would throw a
[1:03:29] baby from a mother's arms and ravish her
[1:03:31] that's a brute but a man is measured by
[1:03:35] character and there never was a man like
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ the Bible said there was no
[1:03:40] Beauty we should desire him but a
[1:03:43] character like it has never been
[1:03:48] molded there were many great righteous
[1:03:51] men but none of them had the character
[1:03:55] that was needed or able to do what he
[1:03:59] alone could do they each had their part
[1:04:02] with the anointing of the spirit of God
[1:04:04] that come upon them and that part of the
[1:04:06] word that would be spoken and expressed
[1:04:09] out of their life but he came this
[1:04:12] character was came as a character from
[1:04:15] glory in Redemption it was none other
[1:04:18] than God himself come down to produce to
[1:04:22] you and I a blood that could take care
[1:04:25] of the sin question and deposit in our
[1:04:29] life what was needed in order to bring a
[1:04:32] change in our life to where our lives
[1:04:35] would display the very character of God
[1:04:38] himself you see you are ordained for
[1:04:41] this it is the spirit of God that pulls
[1:04:44] upon your heart and stirs your life this
[1:04:47] is why that friends it calls you an i to
[1:04:50] say Lord I I I want to be like you Lord
[1:04:52] I I desire Lord there's a yearning that
[1:04:55] begins to move in your heart because
[1:04:57] there's something in you that is being
[1:05:00] drawn upon by the spirit of the Living
[1:05:02] God this is why when we look at and in
[1:05:05] the scriptures and and we see that even
[1:05:08] where Daniel or David would express it
[1:05:10] like this and he would say help Lord For
[1:05:13] The Godly Man ceaseth for the faithful
[1:05:16] fail from among the children of men and
[1:05:19] to think help Lord The Godly are ceasing
[1:05:23] and and the Faithful Men are failing let
[1:05:25] me say this to you remember job was
[1:05:27] looking for one and job was saying oh
[1:05:30] that I might come before his seat oh oh
[1:05:33] that I could go to his door and then
[1:05:35] that inspiration would break that there
[1:05:37] would be one who would be able to show
[1:05:40] unto man his uprightness you say to show
[1:05:43] unto man his uprightness there's got to
[1:05:46] come one who's able to tell you who you
[1:05:49] are and who you always were and to what
[1:05:52] God has called you to and this is where
[1:05:55] that God himself came down and he
[1:05:58] displayed in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:06:01] the uprightness that he is calling man
[1:06:04] to he displayed it in portion through
[1:06:06] the prophets but then through and by the
[1:06:09] Lord Jesus Christ he displayed that
[1:06:12] uprightness and here in the end time the
[1:06:15] Holy Spirit has come once again in its
[1:06:18] fullness to display to men and women
[1:06:21] that you and I are Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:24] God we're not just trotten down
[1:06:26] something we were ordained before the
[1:06:29] foundation of the world it's not a
[1:06:32] church that makes us a Christian it's
[1:06:34] not the building that makes us a
[1:06:36] Christian but we are made a Christian by
[1:06:38] the spirit of Christ and this is why the
[1:06:41] Bible said in the book of Galatians
[1:06:43] because ye are Sons he hath sent forth
[1:06:47] his Spirit into your hearts it was not
[1:06:50] you or me looking for God it was God
[1:06:54] that came looking for you and me he knew
[1:06:56] about us knew the age he placed Us in
[1:06:59] and God sent a word that was ordained to
[1:07:02] get your attention because you are a
[1:07:05] part of this
[1:07:07] word oh I'm glad that God gives
[1:07:10] help so as we were wrapping that up last
[1:07:14] week I I told you I made a statement
[1:07:16] here and I want to I want to just work
[1:07:18] with that a moment that great men when
[1:07:20] we look upon it they're not born Great
[1:07:24] Men but they
[1:07:27] become they become great men remember
[1:07:30] the Bible said as many as received him
[1:07:35] to them he gave the power and that word
[1:07:38] power is exusia or the authority to
[1:07:42] become the sons of God see God ministers
[1:07:46] to you your right of ausia your right
[1:07:49] that you might go to dunamus which is
[1:07:51] the power to bring to pass that right
[1:07:54] this is why when God makes known to your
[1:07:57] heart and there's a hunger for the Holy
[1:07:59] Ghost a hunger for healing a hunger for
[1:08:01] deliverance let me tell you something
[1:08:03] when you can respond upon that you can
[1:08:05] go ahead and begin to rejoice and thank
[1:08:09] God and welcome God to fulfill that
[1:08:12] promise in your life because why a right
[1:08:16] has been ministered to you and you've
[1:08:19] got a right to the god to come and
[1:08:22] enforce that right in your life so great
[1:08:25] are not born Great Men you can have you
[1:08:28] can have individuals that you know they
[1:08:30] can be born to Great Men Great Men I'm
[1:08:33] speaking of when I'm talking of this
[1:08:35] phrase and even the title as we were
[1:08:37] looking at last week great men are men
[1:08:40] of character Yes Men of
[1:08:45] character and I want to just say it like
[1:08:47] this that what what makes within that of
[1:08:51] a great man here becoming a man that is
[1:08:55] is born and becoming a great man is
[1:08:57] because of the promise that they hold
[1:09:00] remember in the Scriptures it would
[1:09:03] Express of how that job was the greatest
[1:09:07] man in all the earth now job had a lot
[1:09:09] of wealth it would talk about or the
[1:09:11] greatest man in the East it was dealing
[1:09:13] with not only his substance but I want
[1:09:15] you to notice where that is mentioned
[1:09:18] that very that very term is not
[1:09:20] mentioned in the opening scripture of
[1:09:22] job the opening scripture is God's
[1:09:26] Declaration of who job is he's a perfect
[1:09:30] and upright man he's one that a Feth God
[1:09:34] and esth shuns evil you see he was one
[1:09:39] who was living by what God had revealed
[1:09:43] to him through and by the burnt offering
[1:09:46] then everything else like the scripture
[1:09:48] said seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:09:51] and all of and his righteousness and all
[1:09:53] these other things will be added into
[1:09:55] you job was a great man but the
[1:09:58] greatness of that was within his life
[1:10:00] was because of what the revelation of
[1:10:04] his sacrifice had done in his life I I
[1:10:08] wish I had time to preach this uh within
[1:10:10] this but you recognize that that
[1:10:12] Ministry within job and you know as you
[1:10:15] go ahead study in the head chapters job
[1:10:17] there was a Ministry a character in his
[1:10:19] life there was a character that had
[1:10:22] power to bring Deliverance to bring
[1:10:25] understanding handing to those who were
[1:10:26] in places of confusion that's what it
[1:10:28] says in job 29 it was those that maybe
[1:10:32] that were blind their eyes would be open
[1:10:34] those who were even in the jaws of death
[1:10:37] they were snatched out of there it was a
[1:10:39] Ministry of power and deliverance what
[1:10:42] brought that about it was the character
[1:10:45] of Christ being revealed in job's
[1:10:48] life oh my Hallelujah so with the
[1:10:52] greatness when we think about Abraham
[1:10:54] you know brother would take that and
[1:10:56] make that statement of how that Abraham
[1:10:58] was the greatest man on the face of the
[1:11:00] earth now I'm not talking about because
[1:11:03] with that Abraham within his own flesh
[1:11:05] was great but it's because of the
[1:11:08] promise he had received and who had made
[1:11:11] the promise to him it begin to have an
[1:11:14] effect on Abraham's life is that right
[1:11:17] Abraham left in Genesis 11 he left the
[1:11:19] her of CIS not fully separated here he
[1:11:22] was with lot and his Grand his and his
[1:11:24] daddy with with him but he kept on
[1:11:26] walking with God Genesis 12 Genesis 13
[1:11:30] he kept walking and we find in Genesis
[1:11:32] 14 here one who is greater actually
[1:11:37] blesses Abraham who has the promise and
[1:11:41] here Abraham being the greatest man on
[1:11:43] the earth what made Abraham the greatest
[1:11:45] man on the earth because he had received
[1:11:48] the greatest promise from the great
[1:11:51] almighty God and that's the thing that
[1:11:54] separate Ates you and I it's not because
[1:11:58] of who we are our DNA let me just say it
[1:12:00] like this it's not even because you come
[1:12:02] to this church it's because of the
[1:12:05] promise that you hold in your life it's
[1:12:08] not our association around the message
[1:12:11] it is because of the promise you hold in
[1:12:14] your life that will influence you to
[1:12:17] make the decisions in your life even the
[1:12:20] tough decisions that God has to arrange
[1:12:23] conditions that'll force you to to make
[1:12:26] decisions I tell you one thing as
[1:12:28] parents if there's anything that we
[1:12:29] ought to be able to do is stand behind
[1:12:32] and God dealing with our our children in
[1:12:35] such a way like David I read that
[1:12:37] scripture to you rid us from the hand of
[1:12:39] strange of strange you know strange
[1:12:41] women and yield take us away from
[1:12:44] falsehood Lord I want my home and my
[1:12:47] family to be under the influence of the
[1:12:49] Holy Spirit and I want to encourage when
[1:12:52] my children when there are things that
[1:12:54] they come do in their life to say Dad
[1:12:57] God is leading me to lay this aside or
[1:13:00] to move right here I want to be able to
[1:13:02] stand there with the word of God and
[1:13:03] encourage him and say let's pray about
[1:13:06] it and because why God is dealing with
[1:13:08] him on a personal way and that same God
[1:13:11] that's dealing with them in a very
[1:13:13] simple thing that we could look at it'll
[1:13:15] be the same way the rest of their
[1:13:18] life Hallelujah this is why even when a
[1:13:21] young person can come and you know
[1:13:23] brother Samuel whether here or wherever
[1:13:26] God's dealing with me on on certain
[1:13:27] things let's pray about it and let's ask
[1:13:30] God as God is opening that to your heart
[1:13:32] let's ask God just so confirm that and
[1:13:35] settle it in your heart to where the
[1:13:37] decision that you make is a decision you
[1:13:40] realize things you're seeing and now
[1:13:42] it's completely under the influence and
[1:13:44] there's a settl
[1:13:47] Hallelujah think about where Abraham
[1:13:50] came to in his life Abraham came to a
[1:13:53] place all all the way through the
[1:13:55] Journey the decisions that he made in
[1:13:58] life was because of the promise he was
[1:14:01] holding Abraham did not look at lot as
[1:14:05] though that he himself was better but he
[1:14:07] looked it was the promise that he held
[1:14:09] that he made the decisions he made and
[1:14:12] see that's a great man that's a great
[1:14:14] man of God the decisions that are based
[1:14:17] upon what the promise that we have let
[1:14:19] me tell you we're we're in the season of
[1:14:21] rapture we're in the season of change
[1:14:24] we're in the season of influences and
[1:14:26] things and listen I I could go through
[1:14:28] and give you accounts in the scripture
[1:14:30] to where that there are things and
[1:14:32] influences and decisions that were made
[1:14:35] like even Jacob one time made a decision
[1:14:37] to leave bethl right after God had dealt
[1:14:40] with him and made a decision to leave
[1:14:42] bethl and go on down here I can't
[1:14:43] remember the name of the city now he
[1:14:45] goes on down there and you know what
[1:14:46] happens to his daughter his daughter
[1:14:48] that here becomes one of the city that
[1:14:50] begins to lust after her and now the
[1:14:53] situation that comes and ask her you
[1:14:55] know to to marry him and remember it's
[1:14:58] always been the Declaration God himself
[1:15:01] never approves of unbeliever or
[1:15:04] Believers marrying unbelievers let me
[1:15:06] just drop this in right now don't ever
[1:15:08] entertain one who is an unbeliever and
[1:15:11] think that you've got the ability to
[1:15:13] convert them there is nobody that can
[1:15:17] convert an unbeliever but God that's why
[1:15:20] when you know that you met God you know
[1:15:23] that God that changed your life you met
[1:15:25] the Supernatural and you don't ever want
[1:15:28] to get entangled with anything that God
[1:15:31] has not already put his approval
[1:15:35] on I'm not talking about for the F of
[1:15:37] relationship I'm talking about to where
[1:15:40] you see that God is with this life this
[1:15:43] is a life that loves the Lord this is a
[1:15:46] life that loves God this is a life that
[1:15:49] bears His Image
[1:15:51] amen come on that's still scripture
[1:15:53] friends
[1:15:56] hallelujah we're not interested in
[1:15:58] trying to make somebody conform to a
[1:16:00] group of ideas that'll work for so long
[1:16:03] that's right man we're just going to run
[1:16:06] with it it'll work for just so long go
[1:16:08] along for just so long but about that it
[1:16:11] ought to be that what we see and what
[1:16:13] we're searching for is to see Christ in
[1:16:16] that individual if I can't see Christ in
[1:16:19] that individual then sorry I want Christ
[1:16:22] it's him and him alone I don't want on
[1:16:25] anything else but Christ and anything
[1:16:28] that I add to my life it ought to be an
[1:16:30] adding to more of Christ in my
[1:16:34] life
[1:16:36] Hallelujah Oh Glory so we find that
[1:16:39] Abraham himself here he comes to such a
[1:16:41] place to where everything that is laid
[1:16:45] on the line to where he offers his all
[1:16:48] and because of that offering God
[1:16:51] expresses that thy seed shall possess
[1:16:53] the gates of thine enemy me in Genesis
[1:16:56] 22 and in thy seed shall all the nations
[1:16:58] of the earth be blessed because thou
[1:17:01] Hast obeyed my
[1:17:05] voice amen that's real greatness you
[1:17:07] know what greatness it's obedience to
[1:17:09] the voice of
[1:17:11] God that's what it is so because when we
[1:17:14] look at thoughts of and and reasonings
[1:17:17] of greatness you know that remember what
[1:17:20] the world calls great God calls foolish
[1:17:24] is that the
[1:17:25] scripture what man calls great oh this
[1:17:28] is so great you know man even in his
[1:17:32] even in uh how man would look at it man
[1:17:35] could look upon things and you know
[1:17:37] they'll look at at what they call Great
[1:17:39] this is what happened when God come to
[1:17:42] fulfill his word even through the life
[1:17:45] and Ministry of John the Baptist they
[1:17:47] were looking for the Low Places to be
[1:17:50] made High and the high places to be made
[1:17:52] low but they weren't in tune with the
[1:17:55] spirit of God and they were looking for
[1:17:57] something that matched their reasoning
[1:18:00] and when John came he came according to
[1:18:02] the scripture he came according to how
[1:18:05] that God had spoken it but it wasn't
[1:18:07] talking about something out here in the
[1:18:09] natural but it was God coming down to
[1:18:12] make a way in the heart of the believer
[1:18:15] that Christ himself might come and take
[1:18:18] his Abode in our lives but you see their
[1:18:21] way of looking at greatness it took them
[1:18:23] right away from the real principle and
[1:18:25] kernel of the scripture and that's real
[1:18:27] humility you see when the Lord Jesus
[1:18:30] when he came he's the greatest man to
[1:18:32] ever live and when he came upon the
[1:18:34] Earth remember he was asked who would be
[1:18:37] the greatest as a matter of fact the
[1:18:39] Bible will say in one place there was
[1:18:40] Strife among them in another place it
[1:18:43] says there was disputing when it's
[1:18:44] talking of the same account so you
[1:18:47] recognize that that this voling for
[1:18:50] position and this that that part it laid
[1:18:53] within man that came because of the fall
[1:18:56] of the first birth you you realize it
[1:18:59] takes the grace of God for you and I to
[1:19:02] lay down our life that that's what the
[1:19:04] scripture said except a man be willing
[1:19:07] to lose his life or Surrender it if he's
[1:19:11] not willing to surrender it if he keeps
[1:19:13] his life he'll lose it in the end but
[1:19:16] God is so placed it that he's not going
[1:19:18] to come and overpower you and I to take
[1:19:21] it from us but he wants us to come into
[1:19:24] such a place that it's a surrender to
[1:19:26] his presence we see the greatness of God
[1:19:29] and God's greatness is one who's able to
[1:19:33] condescend if he would have remained
[1:19:36] where he was PR there would have been no
[1:19:39] hope for you and
[1:19:40] I but God condescended to such a place
[1:19:44] that he didn't even have a pillow to
[1:19:46] rest his head on did not even have a
[1:19:49] home is that right had no place he said
[1:19:53] the foxes have holes they have dens but
[1:19:55] the son of man has no place to lay his
[1:19:57] head it come to such a place and God so
[1:20:01] condescended even to where we see the
[1:20:03] woman at the well we see many different
[1:20:05] needs to where that almighty God
[1:20:08] condescended in such a manner in order
[1:20:11] to bring Deliverance to bring Redemption
[1:20:15] to Fallen
[1:20:16] man now notice with this of the strife
[1:20:19] and he would say the greatest one among
[1:20:21] you is he that would be able to humble
[1:20:25] himself the greatest one among you
[1:20:27] because when we when we understand that
[1:20:30] that brother R would say it like this
[1:20:32] great men in the message unwelcome
[1:20:33] Christ great men are little men they
[1:20:36] never brag or take honor they make you
[1:20:39] feel that you're great that's great men
[1:20:43] and he said here's the greatest of men
[1:20:46] the greatest of all men God manifested
[1:20:49] in flesh become a footwash flunky with
[1:20:54] humility
[1:20:55] the king of all eternity all glory the
[1:20:58] creator of heavens and earth washed the
[1:21:00] dung off of men's feet yes he did and
[1:21:03] this is to me what strikes me it was
[1:21:05] already humiliation enough that he
[1:21:08] became one of us took upon himself the
[1:21:12] likeness of sinful flesh that was
[1:21:15] already humiliation but here in the
[1:21:18] midst of his disciples he humbled
[1:21:21] himself and washed their feet he took
[1:21:24] the the lowest position you see what the
[1:21:27] spirit of God will always lead you and I
[1:21:30] to do is to take the lower position you
[1:21:34] say lower to what it will always lead us
[1:21:37] in subjection to the word let me just
[1:21:39] say this to you when Jesus knelt down
[1:21:42] and he began to wash their feet remember
[1:21:44] what Peter said you're not going to wash
[1:21:45] my feet Lord he he looked at it hey you
[1:21:48] you you you you you've so in such a
[1:21:50] position no I'm not going to let you
[1:21:52] wash my feet it wasn't that he had
[1:21:54] anything against Jesus it was simply of
[1:21:57] the place that Jesus had so condescended
[1:22:01] to that Peter was looking at it in such
[1:22:03] a natural way and Jesus told him what
[1:22:06] I'm doing right now you don't understand
[1:22:10] but you will understand it you're going
[1:22:14] to come to this understanding and he
[1:22:16] said whosoever's feet I wash not has no
[1:22:20] part with me that changed everything
[1:22:22] Peter said if it me means that I'll have
[1:22:25] no part with you then wash everything
[1:22:28] Lord wash all of
[1:22:30] me is that right but he showed us the
[1:22:34] authority of what it is that when the
[1:22:37] word itself when we in our lives would
[1:22:40] come into such a place of subjection I
[1:22:43] don't care what the hardest obstacle is
[1:22:45] I don't care what the greatest thing
[1:22:46] that might be in your life it might be
[1:22:48] husband wife it might be differences it
[1:22:50] might be things and so forth at work but
[1:22:53] listen when you in your own life can so
[1:22:55] subject yourself to the place of the
[1:22:58] word then you are letting the word go to
[1:23:00] work instead of your feelings your
[1:23:03] emotions your reasonings let me tell you
[1:23:05] something the word has power within it
[1:23:08] to bring to pass whatsoever that love
[1:23:11] has called for you've got to be sure
[1:23:14] that it's love that's in your
[1:23:17] heart love does not call for vengeance
[1:23:20] love does not call for Retribution love
[1:23:23] keeps no record am is that right that's
[1:23:26] love are you hearing me it's there we
[1:23:29] could go all the way through that but
[1:23:30] what I'm saying is is notice the
[1:23:33] position that he that he assumed in
[1:23:36] order to bring to pass this in their
[1:23:40] lives I'm glad about that aren't you
[1:23:43] amen so here God's not you know he's not
[1:23:47] calling you know even in humility
[1:23:49] sometimes we can get in our mind that
[1:23:50] humility itself and you know is you know
[1:23:53] maybe a way that we would kind of make
[1:23:55] our face or how we walk but that that's
[1:23:58] not it it's some humility in our heart
[1:24:01] to the word of God there you go am and I
[1:24:04] just want to say it like this leadership
[1:24:06] itself leadership is not meant to be a
[1:24:09] struggle right it's not meant to be a
[1:24:12] struggle it's meant to be an Evidence of
[1:24:15] inward
[1:24:17] Victory that's what real leadership is
[1:24:19] that's good you see the lamb was willing
[1:24:22] to go to Calvary because he had already
[1:24:24] wrestled it
[1:24:25] out he was able to be led the lamb was
[1:24:30] able to be led right and there's a
[1:24:32] leadership itself it's not meant to be a
[1:24:35] struggle that this is why friends that
[1:24:37] when when many times that within the
[1:24:39] things of Life of how that God comes
[1:24:42] with his Spirit in order to bring about
[1:24:45] a real Divine change in our life it
[1:24:48] these are things that when we're looking
[1:24:49] at it it it ought not be that we're
[1:24:52] looking at the word of God as as well
[1:24:54] his Commandments oh is asking us to do
[1:24:56] this and and you know then we well the
[1:24:58] preacher is asking it it isn't the
[1:24:59] preacher God's word is still the same
[1:25:03] he's never changed man has wanted to
[1:25:06] take from God's word man has wanted to
[1:25:08] alter it but you know why man does that
[1:25:10] because they don't know
[1:25:13] God there should have been a bigger Amen
[1:25:15] on that the reason men will do that they
[1:25:18] know God by their Seminary or by a
[1:25:21] certain teaching but they don't know the
[1:25:23] Living God
[1:25:25] when you know the Living God and you
[1:25:26] have met him face to face you have met
[1:25:29] his character and there when you're
[1:25:31] reading the word then the word of God is
[1:25:34] not just a letter it now becomes a love
[1:25:37] letter there are things that are written
[1:25:39] between the scriptures and between the
[1:25:42] lines that are there and God's thoughts
[1:25:45] become so precious and impactual to your
[1:25:48] life hallu Hallelujah and I will say it
[1:25:51] like this as that leadership is not
[1:25:53] meant to be a struggle but evidence of
[1:25:55] an inward inward Victory we've got to be
[1:25:58] willing with a willingness to conquer
[1:26:01] ourselves I tell you what of all the
[1:26:04] greatest of all the latest greatest land
[1:26:07] grabs that's ever been the greatest
[1:26:09] Victory is when we're able to conquer
[1:26:12] ourselves you go there you go that's the
[1:26:15] greatest Victory yes sir that's why
[1:26:17] brother Brown would say and humble
[1:26:18] thyself and listen he's not taken away
[1:26:20] from worship when he says this but he
[1:26:22] says when a man has been able to conquer
[1:26:25] himself he has got more Victory than the
[1:26:29] man that would run all over the building
[1:26:31] and Shout man not talking taking away
[1:26:34] from from from from worship that's not
[1:26:36] what he's doing at all but he's letting
[1:26:38] us know that real overcoming power and
[1:26:42] victory is more than just being in the
[1:26:45] house of God it's more than just coming
[1:26:48] under the influence or coming under and
[1:26:51] oh my we have just a wonderful time in
[1:26:53] his presence thank God that we have a
[1:26:55] wonderful time in his presence but
[1:26:57] friends it's got to come something that
[1:27:00] we are real and we're looking at it the
[1:27:02] Lord I need a deeper work I don't want
[1:27:05] to just be satisfied with something on
[1:27:08] my spirit that leaves me when I get out
[1:27:10] of here and I'm back to the same old
[1:27:12] person again I want that which you drop
[1:27:15] in the depths of my soul that brings a
[1:27:18] change in my
[1:27:20] life that's what God promised that's why
[1:27:23] real leadership is the evidence of an
[1:27:26] inward Victory let me tell you God's
[1:27:29] called you to be a
[1:27:30] leader in the capacity that you are as a
[1:27:34] father as a mother you'll never be
[1:27:37] successful without full obedience to the
[1:27:39] word of God that's
[1:27:41] true let me give you an example if you
[1:27:44] can tell your son or
[1:27:46] daughter well that don't that don't
[1:27:48] apply
[1:27:49] anymore there'll come a time in their
[1:27:51] life they'll ask you well what about
[1:27:53] this problem
[1:27:56] what about this scripture you see you
[1:27:58] you got we want to seow seeds of
[1:28:02] righteousness we want to show that that
[1:28:04] God the Bible said in the Book of
[1:28:06] Malachi I'm God and I change not Hebrews
[1:28:09] 138 said I'm G Jesus Christ the same
[1:28:13] yesterday today and forever he never
[1:28:15] changed he's the same God when he comes
[1:28:18] in he lives the same life through you
[1:28:21] and I right so in order there's got to
[1:28:24] come a full obedience uh uh which which
[1:28:27] brings the entitlement to the Token
[1:28:29] bringing God's life in us and then we've
[1:28:33] got to stay in our Lane right that's
[1:28:36] right father's got to stay in his Lane
[1:28:39] as husband mothers got to stay wife got
[1:28:42] to stay in her
[1:28:43] Lane true you see many times like
[1:28:48] brother brah would say it and he bring
[1:28:49] the scriptural principle seek you first
[1:28:51] the kingdom of God his righteousness all
[1:28:53] these other things will be unto you we
[1:28:55] see the woman of zapus we see all the
[1:28:57] way down through the scripture that
[1:28:59] every time there was a miracle and God
[1:29:02] moved it's because God's word was obeyed
[1:29:07] first and this is why that when we're we
[1:29:09] can be interested about brother B just
[1:29:11] says it like this in the Hebrew series
[1:29:13] he said instead of us trying to get
[1:29:15] everybody else lined up he said make
[1:29:17] sure that you're lined up with God's
[1:29:19] Will and when you're lined up with God's
[1:29:21] will then the rest of the family will'll
[1:29:24] fall in
[1:29:26] line you see that's believing what God
[1:29:29] has said to be
[1:29:31] true oh my I think there's no greater
[1:29:34] thing that we can have than to be a
[1:29:35] servant of God you know when the prophet
[1:29:38] himself remember they presented that I
[1:29:40] stood there in in brother bram's office
[1:29:42] a few years back and we stood there and
[1:29:45] we're standing there for for some time
[1:29:47] and I looked at the at at the picture
[1:29:49] that uh they gave him in the message
[1:29:51] restoration of the Bride tree that
[1:29:53] brother uh Jerry Stephy had painted and
[1:29:55] there it is and every all the writings
[1:29:57] and the accolades and what they were you
[1:29:59] expressing of how of what they had seen
[1:30:01] and and and you know there through
[1:30:03] brother bram's Ministry and and you know
[1:30:05] through through his life and and this is
[1:30:07] to me what strikes me is that after it's
[1:30:10] all said and done brother bham just says
[1:30:12] my he says I'm not worthy of those kind
[1:30:14] of things to be said he said but that
[1:30:17] means more to me than all the money in
[1:30:19] the world why because it's a character
[1:30:22] that the people have seen manifested
[1:30:26] before them and here's what he says he
[1:30:28] says just to think that somebody would
[1:30:31] regard you as a servant as God's
[1:30:35] servant what a high compliment to be
[1:30:38] regarded as a servant of God what a high
[1:30:41] compliment for you for me to be regarded
[1:30:44] as a son and daughter of God a servant
[1:30:46] of God there's no higher compliment that
[1:30:49] we could pay one
[1:30:51] another now notice this in Psalms 1
[1:30:54] one2 verse one blessed is the man that
[1:30:58] fearth the Lord this isn't afraid of him
[1:31:02] but it's reverence that delighteth
[1:31:06] greatly in his Commandments that's so
[1:31:09] good his seed now notice the effect of
[1:31:11] this his seed shall be Mighty upon the
[1:31:15] Earth the generation of the upright
[1:31:18] shall be blessed now this word mighty
[1:31:21] when you look at this word it's a word
[1:31:22] Gabor when you look at it down through
[1:31:24] the scriptures there some of the very
[1:31:26] first parts of it of Mighty and this
[1:31:28] it's just many times what we can get in
[1:31:30] our mind of Mighty and some of those who
[1:31:33] regarded as mighty was based on their
[1:31:36] Earthly wisdom in the days of Noah there
[1:31:39] were men of renown they were Mighty Men
[1:31:43] of wisdom and knowledge then is that
[1:31:46] right mighty men that have lived down
[1:31:49] with knowledge but this Mighty is not
[1:31:51] talking about men of Earthly strength
[1:31:54] Earthly abilities Earthly standing it's
[1:31:57] speaking of the character within their
[1:32:01] life are you with me of how that through
[1:32:05] this well what brings this about is
[1:32:07] remember Great Men D not born Great Men
[1:32:11] that's right they become great men
[1:32:14] notice where it starts with blessed is
[1:32:16] the man that word blessed I wish I had
[1:32:19] time to preach that it deals with a man
[1:32:21] who is completely content in his walk
[1:32:24] with God that he knows that his life is
[1:32:27] matching what God has required there is
[1:32:30] a real happiness that's not brought by
[1:32:33] Wall Street or anything else it's a
[1:32:35] happiness where that man knows where he
[1:32:38] is with God in his walk with god notice
[1:32:41] the effect there is a reverence and a
[1:32:43] Delights in this
[1:32:45] commandment yes sir Hallelujah you see
[1:32:49] these are things that with within it
[1:32:51] this is why these are important princip
[1:32:53] principles that within this his seed
[1:32:56] shall be Mighty upon the earth and the
[1:32:58] generation of the upright shall be
[1:33:01] blessed wealth and riches shall be in
[1:33:03] his house and his righteousness endureth
[1:33:07] forever that's good so there's a there's
[1:33:10] a
[1:33:11] reverence that that that when we're
[1:33:13] looking at with great men there's a
[1:33:15] reverence there's something that that
[1:33:17] should come from that life that even
[1:33:20] when job would walk through the
[1:33:21] marketplaces then when it talked about
[1:33:23] princess would stand up it wasn't
[1:33:25] because that job you know had had some
[1:33:28] you know he had some kind of an ego trip
[1:33:30] that's not what it was at all it's
[1:33:32] because of the character in his life
[1:33:35] this man had a character that was
[1:33:38] brought he didn't even have the Holy
[1:33:39] Ghost like you and I have the privilege
[1:33:42] of having but he operated under the
[1:33:44] Revelation that God had given him in
[1:33:47] that day and just that portion of the
[1:33:50] Revelation It produced in job's life
[1:33:53] that kind of a character Hallelujah and
[1:33:57] that kind of a character within it it it
[1:33:59] brought a reverence this is why a
[1:34:01] reverence a life of humility and
[1:34:04] reverence oh the effect that it will
[1:34:06] have through our life it will bring
[1:34:08] forth the same life in others amen and
[1:34:13] I'll just say it like this Redemptive
[1:34:15] power lays in the heart of the believer
[1:34:18] yes that's good yes sir yes sir if you
[1:34:21] have been born again of the spirit of
[1:34:23] God God Redemptive power lays in your
[1:34:28] heart there is that which Paul writes of
[1:34:31] it is the spirit of
[1:34:34] reconciliation it is the spirit of God
[1:34:36] that of redemption but remember
[1:34:39] reconciliation can only operate through
[1:34:42] lives that have been fully reconciled to
[1:34:46] God and then when that life is fully
[1:34:49] reconciled to God then the spirit of
[1:34:52] reconciliation can operate through that
[1:34:55] life we become a channel that others can
[1:34:58] be reconciled to him let me just preach
[1:35:00] for a minute this is why then in your
[1:35:02] life how Satan wants to so come in your
[1:35:04] homes in your families he wants to get
[1:35:07] on you as a brother or sister and get
[1:35:09] your thoughts out here get you under the
[1:35:11] influence of the day get you into traps
[1:35:14] and things to try to break away that
[1:35:16] effect and that influence that Christ
[1:35:19] would have on your life and through your
[1:35:21] life and get us so tied up to where we
[1:35:23] are unable to even reconcile situations
[1:35:26] in our
[1:35:28] home let me tell you the way the way
[1:35:32] that Satan works is to try to break that
[1:35:35] influence but there is nothing that can
[1:35:37] ever reconcile a situation nothing
[1:35:40] outside of the spirit of almighty God
[1:35:44] are you hearing me friends listen
[1:35:45] friends I stand right here as a pastor I
[1:35:48] believe in laying hands on the sick I
[1:35:50] believe in casting out Devils but let me
[1:35:52] tell you something it is not just a
[1:35:54] preacher to stand there when that is
[1:35:56] done I believe with all my heart that no
[1:35:58] matter what it is that you might be
[1:35:59] troubled with here this morning I
[1:36:01] believe there's Deliverance in the house
[1:36:03] of God but you're going to have to keep
[1:36:05] and hold on to that Deliverance in your
[1:36:08] life you can't go out what do the
[1:36:11] scripture say go and sin no more go and
[1:36:14] disbelief no more don't leave and
[1:36:16] continue on the way that you were in
[1:36:19] other words do not make your life a
[1:36:22] Haven that is welcome for other spirits
[1:36:25] to come and influence your life but let
[1:36:28] the standard of the word be in your life
[1:36:30] that Satan does not feel welcome at all
[1:36:34] and you say how does that happen by the
[1:36:36] love of God and staying in the love of
[1:36:43] God there's a portion here in the
[1:36:46] scripture this man is not ever even
[1:36:49] alive when his
[1:36:51] daughters come to Moses and it's time
[1:36:54] for inheritance to be given
[1:36:59] out but it's
[1:37:03] zad this is this is the man's name he's
[1:37:06] not even alive in this time this man has
[1:37:10] had no
[1:37:12] Sons now to understand that what God
[1:37:15] gives to a tribe it always is to stay
[1:37:18] with that tribe it can never pass from
[1:37:22] this tribe to that tribe amen even if
[1:37:26] the land is sold the Bible says in
[1:37:30] Leviticus it shall not be sold forever
[1:37:33] hallah that's good oh my I wish we could
[1:37:37] preach on that but you understand that
[1:37:39] these portions of inheritance of land
[1:37:43] that here zelop had was not even alive
[1:37:46] and all he had was daughters but the
[1:37:48] daughters that he had came to Moses and
[1:37:51] this is the Declaration that they made
[1:37:54] to Moses in verse three our father died
[1:37:58] in the wilderness but he was not in the
[1:38:01] company of them that gathered themselves
[1:38:04] together against the Lord in the company
[1:38:08] of Kora yeah right I tell you what a
[1:38:11] testimony they you know what it is they
[1:38:14] saw this they were Witnesses when the
[1:38:17] rest joined themselves to the spies
[1:38:20] those 10 spies that went over into the
[1:38:23] promised land and said it's an evil
[1:38:25] report they were Witnesses of how that
[1:38:28] their father stood with the word of the
[1:38:31] Lord how their fathers stood under all
[1:38:34] the Wailing and the pressure that was
[1:38:36] there they are aware of that because
[1:38:39] there was something in the heart of zad
[1:38:42] notice the effect that he stood in that
[1:38:45] time walking in his Integrity look at
[1:38:48] the effect that it had upon his
[1:38:50] daughters it brought a courage in his
[1:38:53] daughter to go and ask for a promise oh
[1:38:56] my to ask for something that it looked
[1:38:59] as though there's no hope for
[1:39:01] itah there was a courage in them that
[1:39:04] they rose up when there was no promise
[1:39:07] that of to daughters but it Rose in
[1:39:09] their hearts to go and ask Moses and say
[1:39:13] ask the Lord because our father did not
[1:39:15] yoke himself with a Disobedience of Kora
[1:39:19] Hallelujah but he died in his own sin
[1:39:21] meaning natural causes cuz death passed
[1:39:23] on all men and had no Sons why should
[1:39:26] the name of our father be done away from
[1:39:28] among his family because he had no son
[1:39:31] give unto us therefore a possession unto
[1:39:34] the Brethren of our father Moses takes
[1:39:36] it to the Lord and says the daughters of
[1:39:38] zop had had well spoken you realize
[1:39:40] there's things that you that even how
[1:39:42] God has come and he has dealt with our
[1:39:44] life to where when it seemed that there
[1:39:46] was no
[1:39:47] hope there were things let me tell you
[1:39:50] something there's things sometimes that
[1:39:51] you can look at and say I don't seem
[1:39:52] like I can find a scripture that matches
[1:39:54] my situation maybe God wants to raise
[1:39:56] you as an
[1:39:58] example cuz he's still God you may not
[1:40:01] find the exact scripture find the exact
[1:40:04] chapter but what's important is to know
[1:40:06] the same God that is brought Deliverance
[1:40:09] in every situation time and time
[1:40:14] again they had a
[1:40:17] testimony this great man great man of
[1:40:21] God
[1:40:24] Hallelujah here was John I want to go to
[1:40:27] the scripture here how here was John at
[1:40:30] that time greatest man here he was
[1:40:33] baptizing in the River Jordan greatest
[1:40:36] man on Earth at that time he was the
[1:40:38] prophet of
[1:40:39] God but the greatest man on Earth notied
[1:40:43] what came in the waters was the word
[1:40:47] right and John
[1:40:50] introduced the word the Lamb of God
[1:40:54] he introduced the one who was promised
[1:40:57] and notice a great man of God the
[1:40:59] greatest man on the earth at that time
[1:41:02] and here the greatest man now here
[1:41:05] stands the Lord Jesus here stands the
[1:41:07] word made flesh and he's given the
[1:41:10] privilege to introduce him I tell you
[1:41:12] there's no greater privilege you and I
[1:41:14] could have is to be able to introduce
[1:41:17] Jesus
[1:41:19] Christ there's no greater privilege than
[1:41:22] to be a
[1:41:24] display of his Mercy see just as the
[1:41:28] word came to John you say well John was
[1:41:30] ordained to introduce the Lamb of God
[1:41:32] you are ordained as well to display the
[1:41:35] word you are ordained as well the word
[1:41:38] has come to you brother BR tells us in
[1:41:41] souls in prison now he said the word
[1:41:43] comes to the predestinated they are the
[1:41:46] heartbeat the word has come to you this
[1:41:49] is why when Philip went to find
[1:41:51] Nathaniel this is why when the word has
[1:41:53] come to your heart it's something that
[1:41:55] begins to strike your heart and stir
[1:41:57] your life there's a desire to tell
[1:41:59] others of the freedom that you have
[1:42:02] experienced in your own
[1:42:06] life Hallelujah so the spirit of Truth
[1:42:09] when it comes to
[1:42:11] us still working with that just a moment
[1:42:14] where great men are not born but they
[1:42:16] become great men the spirit of Truth
[1:42:19] Jesus had said in John 16:13 when he the
[1:42:22] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[1:42:25] you into all truth thank you Jesus now
[1:42:29] notice when he is come he will guide you
[1:42:32] into all truth one of the greatest
[1:42:35] evidences of the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:42:39] is being able to say Amen to every word
[1:42:42] of God and that your life is directed
[1:42:46] into the word of God now it's not just
[1:42:49] you realize it's when we talk about
[1:42:51] saying Amen to the word of God we're not
[1:42:53] just talking about that what we can say
[1:42:55] out here but it's something within our
[1:42:57] heart that that's what God's looking at
[1:43:00] remember it's not the humility out here
[1:43:03] it's the humility on the inside is that
[1:43:06] right because you know it it's just like
[1:43:09] when we can look at it here in the
[1:43:11] scriptures he will lead and guide us
[1:43:13] into all truth this is the promise It's
[1:43:16] A Life That's directed into the truth
[1:43:19] for whatsoever he shall he shall not
[1:43:21] speak of himself but whatsoever ever he
[1:43:23] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:43:25] will show you things to come remember
[1:43:28] even in the time of the disciples he
[1:43:31] spoke to them and said there are things
[1:43:34] I'd like to tell you right now but I
[1:43:36] can't yeah it's it's too hard to be
[1:43:39] understood right now but when he has
[1:43:42] come see there would have to come that
[1:43:45] time and the only way that these things
[1:43:47] would be able to be grasped it would
[1:43:49] take the same divine revelation but it
[1:43:52] would come after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:43:55] into their lives now you see God has
[1:43:58] ways of bringing you and I through
[1:44:00] different situations and training and
[1:44:03] and teaching and how that God works down
[1:44:05] through our lives let me let me just
[1:44:07] read this to you I don't think I put
[1:44:08] this on the screen but you know brother
[1:44:10] BR is talking about how the same spirit
[1:44:11] of God will move down through sons of
[1:44:13] God today he says the great holy spirit
[1:44:16] that was given at Pentecost is here
[1:44:18] tonight and thy children many are weary
[1:44:21] and worn and been pushed about all for
[1:44:24] their own good their teaching their
[1:44:26] child training to bring them up in the
[1:44:29] admiration of the Lord trials worth more
[1:44:32] than silver and gold but as it is
[1:44:34] written no chastisement is Pleasant for
[1:44:37] the time being but when finally that
[1:44:40] church becomes to have its training then
[1:44:43] they will become adopted Sons or placed
[1:44:45] Sons into the inherit inherent of God
[1:44:49] which shall inherit all things and be
[1:44:51] equal in the powers and blessings as a
[1:44:54] Son of God Brothers to
[1:44:57] him this is the effect of God leading
[1:45:01] you and I into all truth character
[1:45:05] itself you've heard it said over and
[1:45:06] over it's not a victory if character
[1:45:10] itself is a victory it's not a gift
[1:45:12] that's right right talking about Great
[1:45:15] Men of God talking about the people of
[1:45:17] God living down through Time character
[1:45:19] itself the Holy Ghost is the gift of God
[1:45:22] right
[1:45:23] but character is a
[1:45:25] victory and there can't be Victory
[1:45:28] without
[1:45:29] battles is that right now I'm going to
[1:45:32] tell you what gives you the strength is
[1:45:34] the promise you're
[1:45:36] holding when everything you face in life
[1:45:39] you've always got to come back to you'll
[1:45:41] always be defeated if you one time get
[1:45:44] off of those sacred Sands you always
[1:45:47] must come back to and remain on those
[1:45:49] sacred Sands that's your basis of
[1:45:52] victory in everything you face you say
[1:45:55] why because the sacred SS is the Holy
[1:45:57] Ghost the word inside of your life
[1:46:00] that's why that you are commissioned to
[1:46:03] bring everything to the word and say
[1:46:05] well I don't see this right now I don't
[1:46:07] understand it then don't make a move on
[1:46:09] it because anything that's not done in
[1:46:11] faith is
[1:46:13] unbelief is that right that's scripture
[1:46:15] so it must be by faith and the only
[1:46:18] thing that can bring Faith is the word
[1:46:20] of
[1:46:21] God and so God comes to you and I just
[1:46:24] like when a a dad you know would come uh
[1:46:28] to his sons and and uh and I I don't
[1:46:31] just say it because that that I have
[1:46:32] sons but you know I realize it has to
[1:46:34] take place even for mothers with their
[1:46:37] their daughters there's got to be a time
[1:46:40] of coming into a place of manhood and
[1:46:43] Womanhood and inauguration there's got
[1:46:45] to be an inaugurating of that there's
[1:46:47] got to come a moment where there's
[1:46:48] things in other words it's not just left
[1:46:50] to its own it's not just left to their
[1:46:52] own deves remember in the Bible says in
[1:46:55] the days of Judges every man did what
[1:46:57] was right in his own eyes it don't just
[1:47:00] say that once in there it says it
[1:47:02] multiple times that's right but you see
[1:47:05] God would come in a way to break that
[1:47:08] from you and I so we're not walking
[1:47:10] according to our own imagination but God
[1:47:13] would come and reveal his perfect will
[1:47:16] to you and I not because we deserve it
[1:47:18] not because we're better than somebody
[1:47:20] else but because God made a promise in
[1:47:23] this hour he would keep his
[1:47:26] word my notice the scripture says in 1
[1:47:30] Corinthians 13 when that which is
[1:47:32] perfect has come then that which in part
[1:47:35] shall be done away when I was a child I
[1:47:37] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:47:41] I thought as a child but when I become a
[1:47:43] man right I put away childish things
[1:47:47] right true there's things that no doubt
[1:47:50] every one of us in here there's things
[1:47:52] that you can think of of right now that
[1:47:54] where we thought that man you know we
[1:47:56] had it all figured out you our parents
[1:47:58] you know my they poor
[1:48:01] things you
[1:48:02] know man if they only
[1:48:05] knew and you get you know you get on and
[1:48:07] you
[1:48:08] realize that was
[1:48:10] wisdom yeah there was direction that was
[1:48:14] being given to my life a lot of times I
[1:48:17] didn't understand it I didn't understand
[1:48:18] why I didn't understand why no was said
[1:48:21] I didn't understand why certain things
[1:48:23] were done but you know what the thing
[1:48:27] that that that would bring that about is
[1:48:29] to be able to look back at that and
[1:48:30] realize if it hadn't been for God's
[1:48:32] grace if it hadn't been for his Mercy is
[1:48:36] that right and then things to where that
[1:48:38] Dad or Mom and they're they're coming
[1:48:40] around in our life and say hey hey come
[1:48:41] on now you're coming into a time there's
[1:48:44] responsibilities there's time to start
[1:48:46] taking up listen friends that's why
[1:48:48] we're living in the in in this time that
[1:48:50] we're living in we're still living in a
[1:48:52] situ
[1:48:53] ation we're individuals you've got grown
[1:48:56] men right that are still babies
[1:49:01] y you know why because they've not been
[1:49:04] initiated into manhood there's not been
[1:49:07] things that's been taken because
[1:49:09] remember great men are not born great
[1:49:12] that's right they become great but it's
[1:49:15] through the admonishing it's through the
[1:49:17] full counsel of God and it works to move
[1:49:19] away there's things that we be begin to
[1:49:23] realize it's time to let go of certain
[1:49:25] things this is how God deals with our
[1:49:27] lives as children of God that there's
[1:49:30] things that God begins to come around to
[1:49:32] our life and say hey it's time to let go
[1:49:34] of that you you you can't keep holding
[1:49:37] on to some of those same things you you
[1:49:39] can't keep walking in that same way it's
[1:49:42] time to mature it's time to come up the
[1:49:45] responsibility and the hour demands
[1:49:49] it watch out brother BR says this in
[1:49:51] what he is that Elijah he said I believe
[1:49:54] we have been children long enough God's
[1:49:56] going to turn his church into manhood
[1:49:59] now now who's going to do it God's going
[1:50:01] to do it we have played and frolicked as
[1:50:04] children but now we're going to have to
[1:50:06] put away childish things and take on
[1:50:09] manhood and maturity Paul said when I
[1:50:12] was a child I spake as a child because
[1:50:14] he thought as a child but it's time that
[1:50:17] we begin to think like men and women now
[1:50:20] for we've got to get down to
[1:50:25] business oh my this is why let let me
[1:50:29] read another place here if God be with
[1:50:31] us where be all his miracles brother BR
[1:50:33] says you can't expect a baby to be born
[1:50:34] a man he's got to grow to it and we grow
[1:50:37] in Christ to the full stature not
[1:50:40] somebody gets converted tonight and
[1:50:41] tomorrow we go preach the gospel we grow
[1:50:44] up into manhood and into the stature of
[1:50:49] Christ amen see God remember remember
[1:50:53] the promise that he gave to
[1:50:55] Abraham the promise that you
[1:50:58] hold is what declares the greatness
[1:51:01] right in your life and that promise is
[1:51:06] what's there to influence the decisions
[1:51:09] you make yeah let me just say it like
[1:51:11] this I'm just sharing with you a little
[1:51:13] bit that even when there's times my boys
[1:51:16] can tell you and to get to be to a
[1:51:17] certain time some of the things that I
[1:51:19] would even lay in with them to let them
[1:51:21] know
[1:51:23] even when I'm correcting them and there
[1:51:25] are things that that would be done and
[1:51:27] and so forth I I'm letting them know
[1:51:29] someday you are going to be in charge
[1:51:34] and responsible for a household right
[1:51:37] and so this this right here the reason
[1:51:40] daddy is standing the way he's standing
[1:51:43] right now you may not understand it I
[1:51:45] don't expect you to understand it but
[1:51:47] here on what I'm giving you is by God's
[1:51:49] word but God is calling and God's desire
[1:51:52] desire is for you when you get to that
[1:51:54] place then you are prepared for that
[1:51:58] moment there's certain things that we
[1:52:01] are doing look even when God took the
[1:52:03] prophet through all of his life and all
[1:52:05] the testing all the trials remember
[1:52:07] listen when brother R him through the
[1:52:09] first pool when he remember he was
[1:52:11] trying to you know uh uh lace that that
[1:52:13] shoe that that shoelace through that
[1:52:15] through that that little shoe and and
[1:52:17] the angel had already told him don't do
[1:52:18] it don't try to explain these things
[1:52:20] even then under pressure
[1:52:23] he explained them right then here he is
[1:52:25] fishing in the second pool Under
[1:52:27] Pressure oh brother Ram's a great man oh
[1:52:29] brother Ram's a great man oh brother R's
[1:52:31] a great preacher pull it brother R boom
[1:52:33] he comes under that but it's different
[1:52:35] with the third pull hallu what I'm
[1:52:39] bringing you to is to show you this the
[1:52:41] prophet God never threw him away after
[1:52:45] the first pull that's good that's good
[1:52:48] as a matter of fact when you read it it
[1:52:49] goes from One Vision right into the next
[1:52:52] you know why because of the maturity God
[1:52:56] taking situations where mistakes were
[1:52:59] made listen God's not afraid of your
[1:53:01] mistakes but it's what you and I do with
[1:53:04] them don't make excuses for your
[1:53:06] mistakes don't make excuses for your
[1:53:09] shortcomings submit it to God and say
[1:53:11] God teach me Lord train me help me Lord
[1:53:15] Build Me Up Lord in this area of my life
[1:53:18] this is exactly what God was doing with
[1:53:21] the prophet throughout his life that's
[1:53:22] what God did with Abraham they were not
[1:53:25] born great men they became Great Men
[1:53:29] because of the greatness of the promise
[1:53:31] that was given by a great God and they
[1:53:34] submitted themselves to
[1:53:36] it so it blazs within our our hearts to
[1:53:40] bring that to bring that about amen
[1:53:43] within our within that even in our
[1:53:46] families it ought to be an encouragement
[1:53:48] this is why even within the ministry of
[1:53:51] a pastor it's one of out of all the five
[1:53:53] ministerial offices I don't say it
[1:53:54] because it's me it's just that's how it
[1:53:56] is it's one of the most closely related
[1:53:59] offices there to that of being of a
[1:54:01] father that of being like a husband
[1:54:02] because it's constant watching over and
[1:54:05] care right right right you don't have
[1:54:07] that with the Evangelist you don't have
[1:54:09] that with with the Apostle you don't
[1:54:10] have a all of them have their part is
[1:54:13] that right all of them have their part
[1:54:15] but how did God would so place it that
[1:54:18] care with the objective is that we grow
[1:54:21] in him that we're coming to moments and
[1:54:24] Times of decisions and things in our
[1:54:27] life to where it should be in our life
[1:54:28] we're looking and saying I'm no longer
[1:54:30] what I used to be right there's a desire
[1:54:34] in our life it it ought to be where the
[1:54:36] word of God is coming and stirring our
[1:54:38] hearts to Lord I want to be more like
[1:54:40] you amen God begins to deal with our
[1:54:43] life I mean you can ask my boys just
[1:54:45] like every one of us have experience
[1:54:46] sometimes when there were things that my
[1:54:48] dad brought across my my pathway and my
[1:54:51] turning and it wasn't just in the
[1:54:53] Natural Things of life but it was even
[1:54:55] when I first got to preaching let me
[1:54:56] tell you something my dad was not easy
[1:54:59] on me my dad when it came to preaching
[1:55:01] and Ministry he would shoot it straight
[1:55:03] with me on things he would tell me son
[1:55:06] you need to study this out a little more
[1:55:08] you need to look at this a little more
[1:55:10] and here's a book on this and here and
[1:55:12] you need to look on this and I you know
[1:55:13] maybe try to go nope he said nope you
[1:55:15] need to study this out when you get this
[1:55:18] studied out then come back and sit down
[1:55:20] and we'll talk about it oo that's stung
[1:55:23] wow that
[1:55:26] stung it really stung it cut but you
[1:55:29] know what it caused me to study yeah it
[1:55:32] caused me to study on many of those
[1:55:34] subjects and things but you know what it
[1:55:35] was doing it was bringing me to a place
[1:55:38] even of maturity even of surrendering of
[1:55:40] my heart in my life that God could mold
[1:55:43] me prise the lord it's the same for you
[1:55:45] and
[1:55:49] iise my my my thank you
[1:55:53] Jesus this is why let me just close with
[1:55:58] this when the Bible it speaks of how
[1:56:03] that in our lives as fathers and
[1:56:05] mothers that there's things that it
[1:56:07] would speak of how that fathers in the
[1:56:10] book of Colossians provoke not your
[1:56:13] children to anger lest they be
[1:56:16] discouraged there's things sometimes
[1:56:18] that as a father in the natural there's
[1:56:20] same Sometimes some things as a Pastor
[1:56:23] sometimes there's things that we all can
[1:56:25] see and you can be
[1:56:28] discouraged you can get frustrated but
[1:56:30] let me just tell you something let me
[1:56:31] just tell you one of the greatest litmus
[1:56:35] things for me when I look at if I feel
[1:56:37] the least little bit of frustration I
[1:56:39] realize I need to get more in prayer
[1:56:43] Glory I'm just sharing my heart with you
[1:56:46] I realize because that's that's Samuel
[1:56:49] even though there's a need there's a
[1:56:51] truth there's things that but you you
[1:56:53] realize because frustration will never
[1:56:54] bring
[1:56:56] results the only the greatest thing I
[1:56:58] can't get to it today but the greatest
[1:57:00] thing for you and I that we have access
[1:57:03] to is prayer if you can if we when we
[1:57:06] can enter into prayer for one another
[1:57:09] enter into prayer for our children enter
[1:57:12] into prayer for situations that we see
[1:57:15] when we can enter into prayer in the
[1:57:18] right way then we can expect to see God
[1:57:21] move
[1:57:23] we've got a right expectation prayer
[1:57:26] changes things sometimes there's things
[1:57:29] that you know we could say you know
[1:57:31] there's sometimes where you can say
[1:57:32] things you can say it until as the old
[1:57:34] southern expression says until you're
[1:57:36] blue in the face you can repeat it and
[1:57:38] repeat it and repeat it but once God
[1:57:41] drops that is that right like brother B
[1:57:45] said here you said you take a man that's
[1:57:46] heard salvation all his life and all of
[1:57:49] a sudden one day it drops hey he did it
[1:57:52] for me Calvary did it for me the spirit
[1:57:56] of God drops that in your heart and yet
[1:57:59] you've been hearing or heard about the
[1:58:01] story whether you're in church or out of
[1:58:03] church and all of a sudden it drops at
[1:58:05] that moment and you realize hey this is
[1:58:07] about me he did it for me Hallelujah
[1:58:11] that's the same way as God deals and he
[1:58:14] works with our life yes and he will work
[1:58:17] with our life Hallelujah until we get it
[1:58:21] amen let me tell you God doesn't leave
[1:58:24] you where he finds you that's right God
[1:58:27] doesn't leave you and I as a toddler he
[1:58:30] works with us neither does God take us
[1:58:33] as a toddler and try to make us a
[1:58:36] teenager all right God don't take a
[1:58:38] teenager and want to treat him like a
[1:58:40] toddler God don't take a teenager and
[1:58:43] put a teenager who's turned third 13 and
[1:58:46] man he can drive the co Gokarts real
[1:58:48] good God don't put keys in his hand God
[1:58:52] don't even put keys in the hand of
[1:58:55] someone who is 16 years old and legally
[1:58:58] can get their
[1:59:01] license I'm bringing that into the
[1:59:03] natural you understand that because you
[1:59:05] see what God does God will not he is
[1:59:08] interested not in you failing his word
[1:59:11] can't fail but God prepares you and I to
[1:59:15] handle what he's called us
[1:59:18] to he molds us that's why the testing
[1:59:21] and trial come our way it molds us it
[1:59:24] shapes us because what's happening in
[1:59:27] that trial it's reducing us from self
[1:59:32] that is so good and God is preparing us
[1:59:35] for what he's called us to that's
[1:59:38] right it's maturing yes sir it's what we
[1:59:42] choose to do with it within those times
[1:59:44] Lord I want to be more like
[1:59:47] you fathers discourage not your children
[1:59:51] lest they be angry unless they
[1:59:53] be all the air taken out of them right
[1:59:57] that's why in when we come down to
[2:00:01] it that's why brother brandham when he
[2:00:03] could say to the church there he would
[2:00:06] talk to us as pastors and ministers he
[2:00:09] said don't you tie your congregation
[2:00:10] into just one Bible evidence he said
[2:00:13] when you do that you keep your church in
[2:00:16] babyhood and not in
[2:00:19] manhood he said I could ask one Bible
[2:00:21] evidence and we'd all be embarrassed to
[2:00:23] raise our hands cry and sigh for the
[2:00:24] abomination of the wicked but you see it
[2:00:26] comes down to what is the real what is a
[2:00:30] real true
[2:00:31] evidence it's a heart where the spirit
[2:00:34] of Christ on the inside Bears witness
[2:00:38] with his Spirit praise the Lord that's
[2:00:41] so good this is why that when it all is
[2:00:43] said and done and I'm a Christian I I'm
[2:00:46] a Believer the the world and the rest is
[2:00:48] looking at what life that is seen
[2:00:51] reproduced
[2:00:52] that's why that within our life there's
[2:00:54] nothing that should be here that we live
[2:00:56] than a different life outside if there's
[2:00:58] a life if we live a different life
[2:01:00] outside then we don't have what's
[2:01:02] necessary and it's not that of what God
[2:01:04] intends for you and I to have listen
[2:01:06] friends when we God deals with our life
[2:01:09] and deals with our heart I'm not saying
[2:01:10] that to shame you but I'm saying it in
[2:01:12] this way that our lives should be such a
[2:01:15] desire that my desire is to reflect
[2:01:18] Jesus Christ I I I want to be one with
[2:01:21] him I I want to have a life that where
[2:01:23] others can say there goes a Christian
[2:01:24] not because I've said it remember the
[2:01:26] Bible said the faithful man does not
[2:01:28] Proclaim his goodness that's good his
[2:01:31] life speaks louder than all the words
[2:01:35] glory glory and those are great men of
[2:01:38] God those are great women of God because
[2:01:42] all the scre the scripture like I said
[2:01:43] last Sunday we could take the Ruth we
[2:01:45] could take the Esters we could take all
[2:01:47] of that it's lives that have been
[2:01:49] surrendered to almighty God
[2:01:53] amen let's just pray praise His name
[2:01:56] hallelujah thank you Jesus Heavenly
[2:01:59] Father
[2:02:00] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:02:03] Lord as the scripture is said in the
[2:02:06] Book of Psalms when David would
[2:02:09] Express that we are the Sheep of your
[2:02:12] pasture and he would say Lord that it is
[2:02:15] not us that has made ourselves but it is
[2:02:18] you that have made us Lord
[2:02:22] father I pray Lord
[2:02:24] that God through the portion Lord of
[2:02:27] these Services I know Lord here this
[2:02:29] morning even that God in the chopped up
[2:02:33] fragments Lord of everything I I just
[2:02:36] trust Lord that father what you have
[2:02:39] Lord desired to Lord speak to us and get
[2:02:43] across to our hearts the thought the
[2:02:46] thought that you have for us
[2:02:50] Lord that God that you find Lord in our
[2:02:54] lives you find hearts that are made
[2:02:58] willing
[2:03:01] lord lord it's you
[2:03:04] that is turning your church into
[2:03:09] manhood Lord you've come by your
[2:03:12] word in this day in this hour the
[2:03:15] promise that you have made and now
[2:03:18] you've come Lord and revealed it and
[2:03:20] Vindicated here we are our
[2:03:23] standing Lord many years later but how
[2:03:26] that the
[2:03:27] promise remains true remain
[2:03:31] sure it's
[2:03:33] steadfast now Lord I
[2:03:36] pray if there's one that would be here
[2:03:38] this
[2:03:40] morning that Lord under the sound of my
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:45] voice that God that would have a desire
[2:03:50] within their heart to say Lord
[2:03:53] I want to know you in that way praise
[2:03:57] God I want to know you to where that you
[2:04:00] are the Lord Of My Life Lord you you're
[2:04:05] you're my master Lord you're my one who
[2:04:08] is there to control and direct my life I
[2:04:12] I don't want to try to handle it on my
[2:04:14] own I don't want to try
[2:04:17] to I don't want it in my hands any
[2:04:20] longer like like the little lad that had
[2:04:24] that Five
[2:04:26] Loaves and two
[2:04:30] fishes in his hands it would have
[2:04:35] remained just a little
[2:04:37] lunch that no doubt would have would
[2:04:40] have fed
[2:04:41] him but when he surrendered it into your
[2:04:46] hands it fed a
[2:04:50] multitude Hallelujah scriptures would
[2:04:52] tell us 5,000 but we realized that what
[2:04:54] was being counted was not women and
[2:04:56] children that was just men
[2:04:59] right but it it fed
[2:05:02] them in your
[2:05:05] hands now Lord here this
[2:05:09] morning I want May lives and hearts that
[2:05:13] would just look at it and say
[2:05:16] Lord I want my life so fully delivered
[2:05:19] into your hands amen
[2:05:23] I want that life inside of me the spirit
[2:05:27] that will bear witness with his spirit
[2:05:30] that I'm a Son of God I I want Lord that
[2:05:33] that everything in my life I don't want
[2:05:36] no hindrances I don't want anything Lord
[2:05:38] any unconfessed sin I I don't want
[2:05:40] anything build up in my life that would
[2:05:44] keep that Spirit of
[2:05:47] reconciliation from
[2:05:49] working in my life
[2:05:52] I want to be reconciled to every promise
[2:05:54] of
[2:05:55] God lord I want that
[2:05:58] word as Paul said that Ministry of
[2:06:00] reconciliation been committed unto us
[2:06:02] that Lord that that same life would work
[2:06:05] through US
[2:06:06] Lord you've spoke to us in these
[2:06:09] Services Lord that great
[2:06:11] men are not men of of stature physically
[2:06:16] it isn't by their smarts or their
[2:06:18] knowledge nothing wrong with all those
[2:06:20] things Lord they have their place but
[2:06:23] that's not what you're calling
[2:06:27] for Great
[2:06:29] Men great women of God
[2:06:35] lives that Lord A
[2:06:37] promise is spoke to their hearts takes a
[2:06:41] hold of their life and they begin to
[2:06:42] take a hold of that
[2:06:44] promise and it
[2:06:47] influences decisions they
[2:06:49] make associations
[2:06:52] and most importantly Lord because every
[2:06:56] decision will be about you and about
[2:06:59] this word in our
[2:07:01] life I pray that God that you would give
[2:07:04] strength give courage help every one of
[2:07:06] us
[2:07:07] Lord father if there's one here that
[2:07:10] doesn't know you in that
[2:07:12] way may this be a moment Lord I pray
[2:07:15] that Lord just the understanding that's
[2:07:19] needed is the understanding of of your
[2:07:22] presence cuz that's the real greatness
[2:07:24] Lord that's Among Us is your presence
[2:07:27] and to surrender to you that
[2:07:30] Lord I Just Surrender my all
[2:07:34] hallelujah amen I wonder throughout this
[2:07:36] building as maybe we could
[2:07:42] stand maybe that's what you would like
[2:07:44] to do this morning
[2:07:46] Lord I want to surrender my all I want
[2:07:50] to surrender my all to
[2:07:52] you Hallelujah if you've never repented
[2:07:55] and walked into the Waters of baptism in
[2:07:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[2:07:59] a start right there that's right that's
[2:08:01] a start let me tell you how Abraham
[2:08:07] started you look over in Genesis 22 and
[2:08:11] what you see there where he offered up
[2:08:13] and went to take Isaac and the ram came
[2:08:15] on the scene but I'm going to tell you
[2:08:18] it was the same God that started with
[2:08:20] Abraham's life in gen Genesis
[2:08:22] 11 that led him 11 chapters
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:27] later don't despise Small Things what
[2:08:31] God is calling you to do do it surrender
[2:08:35] to the word Lord I I want my life I want
[2:08:38] that character in my life that Lord to
[2:08:42] where that what is in here what what I
[2:08:45] have testified what what I say I I'm a
[2:08:47] Christian I'm a believer I'm standing
[2:08:49] for this message this this word that's
[2:08:52] been revealed in this hour Jesus Christ
[2:08:55] that's who it is that Lord when I when
[2:08:58] leaving out of here that's the testimony
[2:09:01] that's the
[2:09:02] identification that Lord that I want in
[2:09:05] my
[2:09:07] life I wonder how many say Amen to that
[2:09:10] Lord be it unto me that's what I want
[2:09:12] Lord maybe with an uplifted hand Lord
[2:09:15] that's what I want I want to be

[2:18:49] testimony I'd like to share with you
[2:18:51] here real
[2:18:52] quick I know I haven't given testimony
[2:18:55] for a very long
[2:18:57] time uh I can give you a testimony up to
[2:19:01] date but I just feel led to give this
[2:19:05] one that is buried in the treasure box
[2:19:08] of of Miracles that I've
[2:19:11] seen you know I dedicated my daughter we
[2:19:15] my wife and I dedicated my daughter when
[2:19:18] she was a baby and and we always trusted
[2:19:22] in
[2:19:24] God
[2:19:25] and the Lord to watch over
[2:19:29] her
[2:19:32] and my daughter was about 5 years
[2:19:37] old and I told my wife I says um I'm
[2:19:40] going to go cut the
[2:19:43] grass it was one of these times that the
[2:19:46] grass grew the rain came
[2:19:51] it grew then the sunlight came
[2:19:53] out and I didn't have a chance to cut it
[2:19:57] because it was still
[2:19:59] wet and it went about a week like that
[2:20:03] off and on I worked shifts so I there's
[2:20:07] times that I couldn't go out there just
[2:20:09] to cut the grass the next day next
[2:20:11] morning or
[2:20:13] whatever and finally it you know the we
[2:20:18] weather was all right the grass grew but
[2:20:21] it was about this
[2:20:23] high and I had a lwn
[2:20:26] more and to cut that grass I had to lift
[2:20:30] it up and then have it come down like
[2:20:34] this and I had to do that the whole
[2:20:39] yard and I says something came to my
[2:20:43] mind what if there's a can in there in
[2:20:47] that
[2:20:48] grass it was in the front
[2:20:52] lawn and I told my wife before I left
[2:20:56] out of the house I said I'm going to go
[2:20:58] cut the grass I need to do it now you
[2:21:01] know it'll be a
[2:21:02] jungle you know it was already one
[2:21:06] already but but uh I said so you make
[2:21:10] sure Anita don't go out she was only
[2:21:14] about 5 years
[2:21:15] old so she says I'll watch her I don't
[2:21:19] know what happened
[2:21:21] but Anita open unlocked the
[2:21:24] door and came out while I was cutting
[2:21:27] the
[2:21:32] grass and she came by the side uh
[2:21:37] driveway she was only about that
[2:21:41] big and I was cutting
[2:21:45] it and when I cut it
[2:21:49] down I
[2:21:51] heard now mind you I didn't have a cover
[2:21:55] for
[2:21:56] it but it was
[2:21:59] going just
[2:22:04] chopping and it went uh you know how to
[2:22:09] cut the uh how lawnmower Cuts well it
[2:22:12] shoots out and it goes
[2:22:17] up my daughter was standing right there
[2:22:24] and I
[2:22:26] looked
[2:22:29] and that
[2:22:31] can it was a the top of the can that cut
[2:22:35] in
[2:22:37] half and it started swirling and it went
[2:22:40] right to
[2:22:41] her right
[2:22:44] there by the grace of God I said in the
[2:22:47] name of Lord Jesus Christ you stop
[2:22:51] and it was at her height where that can
[2:22:55] lid went
[2:22:58] up and it
[2:23:00] stopped right in front of her
[2:23:03] spinning right in front of her
[2:23:05] eyes and she was
[2:23:10] like remember I already said you
[2:23:13] stop and after it stopped spinning it
[2:23:18] dropped right in front of her
[2:23:22] I just felt led to share that I know
[2:23:24] it's it's a long time ago but I can give
[2:23:27] you up to dates of other Miracles but I
[2:23:30] just feel led to say that that
[2:23:33] dedication to children to
[2:23:35] babies it's not
[2:23:38] just anything to
[2:23:41] overlook we put them in the hands of God
[2:23:44] and God is still watching over them in
[2:23:47] the name of Jesus Christ God bless you
[2:23:50] all
[2:23:51] [Applause]
[2:23:59] hallu you know when the Bible
[2:24:02] says train up a child in the way it
[2:24:04] should go and when it grows old it'll
[2:24:06] never
[2:24:07] depart you
[2:24:09] know brother Bram talked about many
[2:24:12] times when you take back that scripture
[2:24:13] believe on the Lord and thy and thy
[2:24:16] house shall be saved GL it wasn't for
[2:24:21] the Philippian Jailer to figure it out
[2:24:22] but he
[2:24:24] invited the word of God into his
[2:24:27] home and I tell
[2:24:29] you God takes situations that look
[2:24:34] impossible and God still changes
[2:24:38] lives listen friends God God don't just
[2:24:40] specialize in Taking Lives that we say
[2:24:43] well that's a good person God
[2:24:44] Specializes in Taking Lives where there
[2:24:47] seems to be no hope and what was wrote
[2:24:49] off
[2:24:52] there's a man standing right here now
[2:24:53] it's very present brother Matt didn't
[2:24:55] even believe in
[2:24:57] God but God got a hold of his
[2:25:00] life God revealed himself to
[2:25:04] him move for him and sister Heidi and
[2:25:07] look look at the effect look at the
[2:25:08] effect of Christ through their lives
[2:25:10] what what I'm trying to say is is that
[2:25:13] God knows what he's placed in every one
[2:25:15] of us God knows what's there in your
[2:25:18] wife in your in your in your husband God
[2:25:20] knows knows what is there in the
[2:25:22] children stand upon that of God's word
[2:25:25] you believe and thy and thy house shall
[2:25:27] be saved the prophet said you may not
[2:25:29] even live to see your children come in
[2:25:33] he said but I can tell you your prayers
[2:25:35] have not been
[2:25:37] wasted there's a man there's a there's a
[2:25:39] lady by the name in the scriptures the
[2:25:41] name of
[2:25:43] Elizabeth and she prayed for her husband
[2:25:46] Zacharias is that right I think I got
[2:25:49] the right name
[2:25:51] he was a Critic right and he began to
[2:25:54] get more contener and the prophet told
[2:25:56] us he said them when you begin to see
[2:25:58] that that's a sure sign that God's
[2:25:59] dealing with their
[2:26:01] life he got to such a place to where he
[2:26:03] had to find out what is it that's
[2:26:05] dealing with Elizabeth's life you
[2:26:07] remember zakus he had to climb a tree
[2:26:11] shortest man had to climb a tree in
[2:26:13] order to see the Mighty God that had
[2:26:16] come down among
[2:26:19] us go God's word will not return to him
[2:26:24] void just because you don't it seems
[2:26:26] like some of the prayers you prayed it
[2:26:28] seems like things are going the opposite
[2:26:29] way your prayers are not in
[2:26:32] vain they're not in vain God knows each
[2:26:37] one of them they're not just out here he
[2:26:39] stores them and the effects of them it
[2:26:42] begins to be poured out in its
[2:26:45] time don't you love him amen amen
