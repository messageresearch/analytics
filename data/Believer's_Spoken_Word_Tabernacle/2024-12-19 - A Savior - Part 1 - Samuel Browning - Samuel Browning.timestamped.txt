[44:37] amen amen amen you
[44:40] loving amen any good
[44:43] amen the Lord is so good amen God bless
[44:47] you thank you musicians amen I would
[44:51] like to turn here tonight once again
[44:53] into
[44:54] the uh Book of Job and the school to
[44:57] chapter 26 and I want to just speak just
[45:01] draw a little bit more from uh the
[45:04] second
[45:07] verse
[45:09] tonight and job
[45:11] 26 and we'll just read verses one and
[45:15] verse
[45:19] two and I want to the Lord would just
[45:22] help us tonight I just uh want to kind
[45:25] of lay a little bit of a a groundwork
[45:28] here I thought I would probably get to
[45:31] uh well at least hoped I would get to
[45:33] all of it and I begin to realize there's
[45:35] just no way to lay it in and um but then
[45:39] again if he changes course then he
[45:40] changes course but uh I just want to be
[45:44] uh very sensitive and mindful of him and
[45:46] I don't want to rush through things um
[45:49] so in job 26 verse one verse two amen
[45:54] but job answered and said how has the
[45:57] thou help him that is without
[46:00] power and how savest thou the arm that
[46:06] hath no strength and that's what we want
[46:09] to just draw from here tonight how
[46:11] savest thou the arm that hath no
[46:14] strength amen may God bless you and
[46:17] bless the reading of the word as you're
[46:18] being
[46:19] seated amen like to say just such a such
[46:23] a blessing just to be able to see you
[46:25] tonight and uh I know different ones
[46:28] that have been recovering it's good to
[46:29] see you here and sister Stephanie sister
[46:32] Barb and different ones and I know
[46:34] there's others that uh um I know that
[46:37] are also dealing with certain things
[46:39] even from the places that they work with
[46:41] and so forth so uh let's just keep one
[46:44] another in prayer uh you know it makes
[46:47] one thing about it it makes you look
[46:48] forward to a time when all this will
[46:51] pass and uh and not just I'm not just
[46:53] looking in the future way out there even
[46:55] though I desire that in the Millennium
[46:58] uh that's the kind of Health Care system
[46:59] I believe in I mean when you think of it
[47:02] in the Millennium that there will be
[47:04] lives the Bible said that there would be
[47:06] raised up those who had come against the
[47:08] city and those that had never heard but
[47:11] the prophet said they'll be raised in
[47:12] the time of the Millennium and they will
[47:15] G be given a chance to receive the
[47:17] Gospel and to think of how that they
[47:19] will come back and walk within this and
[47:23] they'll never experience any ailment or
[47:25] any physical condition or any sickness
[47:27] in their body and the sad thing about it
[47:29] is is being in such a perfect condition
[47:31] at the end of it all there'll be many
[47:33] that'll make a decision in that time and
[47:35] say I don't want
[47:37] this so even in a perfect condition in a
[47:40] perfect situation you know what you know
[47:41] what it comes down to show us that it's
[47:43] it's it's deeper than all the atmosphere
[47:46] that we're around it's what's on the
[47:48] inside of us that can respond to the
[47:50] glory of God and that part on the inside
[47:53] that's all God's working that's why it
[47:55] all comes down to the grace of God
[47:57] so we're certainly looking forward to
[47:59] that time of when there'll be no
[48:00] sickness and we always look forward to
[48:02] the time of when through the year if God
[48:04] terries that things just kind of pass
[48:06] and it runs its course and goes on in
[48:09] the meantime we just want to hold one
[48:10] another up in prayer but I'd like to
[48:13] just speak here tonight uh Bria if you
[48:15] go ahead and switch that over for me I'd
[48:17] like to speak here tonight on a savior
[48:20] and I'd like to deal with this thought
[48:23] here within this uh portion of the verse
[48:26] that job is expressing to the Brethren
[48:30] who are there and remember they came I
[48:33] believe with all my heart I believe they
[48:35] came to be a help I believe they came in
[48:38] some way to try to save or to minister
[48:41] to job I I don't believe that they came
[48:43] with the wrong intentions uh but what
[48:46] they lacked is what we've been the
[48:47] Lord's been leading us on is they lack
[48:49] discernment and so if there's everything
[48:51] any everything that we need we need the
[48:53] discernment and the leadership of the
[48:55] Holy Spirit go God's given us his word
[48:58] in this hour and what a powerful word
[49:00] and that word of power and authority is
[49:02] the King's word it's God restoring his
[49:05] word by his presence in our lives and
[49:07] there's a confidence that we have from
[49:10] an inner work in our own lives and yet
[49:13] with that when as we approach uh one
[49:16] another as brothers and sisters we
[49:18] approach sometime those that maybe are
[49:20] backsliding or we come across others
[49:23] that maybe you know they're just they're
[49:25] looking and just struggling and maybe
[49:26] maybe there there's something they're
[49:28] longing for a little bit more and we
[49:30] just always want to know that there's
[49:32] one thing and there's one objective that
[49:33] we have and that is we always want to
[49:36] point people to the Lord Jesus Christ if
[49:39] there's one thing that when we leave
[49:41] that the one thing that they have been
[49:43] impressed upon their life is that they
[49:45] have been able to see Jesus Christ a
[49:48] little bit more clear and that the more
[49:51] uh determined to serve him you know I I
[49:53] just say it in this way that you know my
[49:55] objective is not to go and to try to
[49:58] take Pentecostals or Methodist or
[50:00] Baptist and try to make them a message
[50:03] Believers if they're ordained seed of
[50:05] God then when the light shines in
[50:07] humility there will be something that is
[50:09] there that only God can satisfy and God
[50:11] will draw them to himself he'll use the
[50:14] agency of man that's true and that's
[50:16] what we're going to begin speaking about
[50:18] tonight how God uses that that agency of
[50:21] man but at the same time if they are
[50:24] walking in all the light that they are
[50:26] or D to see I pray that God let my life
[50:30] be that which would encourage them to be
[50:33] all that God would have them to
[50:36] be that's that because that takes all of
[50:39] us us not trying to pull people or
[50:41] struggle just just be a light brother
[50:42] Bram said let it Flash in humility and
[50:46] God will take care of the rest of it and
[50:48] sometimes you know when we know that uh
[50:51] uh with that sometimes you know a lot of
[50:52] thoughts can come in but Lord just help
[50:54] us to have our thoughts just stable ized
[50:57] on you and so I want to just look at
[50:59] this this here on how savest thou the
[51:01] arm that hath no strength and I want to
[51:04] look at that thought on a savior the
[51:07] scriptures here tonight I'd like to look
[51:09] at this here because to be that of a
[51:12] savior uh would be that of where to be
[51:15] delivered or be liberated and uh to be
[51:18] saved from many times moral troubles to
[51:21] be saved from many uh different
[51:23] situations that that could be present
[51:26] and we understand that there is no
[51:30] savior but God
[51:33] Alone true we want to just really lay
[51:36] that in it's not it's not our strength
[51:39] it's not our abilities but it's God at
[51:42] work that's why when God showed
[51:45] Zachariah the the picture of the
[51:47] Candlestick which was representative of
[51:49] the seven Church ages and he asked him
[51:52] what do you see and zachariah's response
[51:54] to the angel uh because a prophet does
[51:57] not know the symbol unless God
[51:59] interprets the symbol but a prophet is a
[52:02] channel that God will interpret symbols
[52:04] so that symbols no longer remain as
[52:06] symbols but now they become clear
[52:09] pictures and so he said what will you
[52:11] what thou sayest what is it and he let
[52:13] him know that the whole working within
[52:15] that of the candlesticks is not by my
[52:17] not by power but by my spirit sayeth the
[52:21] Lord this mountain shall be removed so
[52:24] it's always it's it's God's spirit at
[52:26] work and it that's that's if there's
[52:29] anything that is to be achieved in our
[52:31] lives anything that is achieved in our
[52:33] homes and our families and everywhere it
[52:36] must come by the spirit of God but God
[52:40] needs channels to work
[52:43] through and that's what we want to be
[52:45] it's just like an extension cord if you
[52:47] run an extension cord from right here
[52:49] and run it back there and you could plug
[52:51] a fan up maybe where Brother Carlos is
[52:53] at that extension cord just serves to
[52:56] carry the electricity it doesn't produce
[52:59] it but if it's unplugged from The Source
[53:02] no matter how much it's plugged up there
[53:04] the the extension cord does not have
[53:06] anything to carry that's why in our
[53:08] lives we always want to stay plugged
[53:11] in always want to stay plugged in so
[53:14] there's some there's a current that's
[53:15] flowing through our lives that it's not
[53:17] I that liveth but Christ who liveth in
[53:20] me so now in looking at how Paul would
[53:24] write this all things are of God who
[53:28] hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[53:32] Christ and hath given to us the ministry
[53:37] of
[53:38] reconciliation so now God coming down to
[53:43] become one of us now through and through
[53:46] and by the work of Calvary that the
[53:49] blood has been shed now that same life
[53:53] God's own life comes into the worship
[53:57] and it ties us together with God then we
[54:01] are part of the ministry of
[54:04] reconciliation so the spirit of God is
[54:07] not a spirit that draws circles tighter
[54:11] or excludes or even looks down but the
[54:14] ministry of reconciliation is even not
[54:17] about someone uh joining and and seeing
[54:20] things the way I see it it's about being
[54:23] reconciled to God glory that's the focus
[54:27] that's the objective is being reconciled
[54:29] to God and before that that can really
[54:32] be the objective in our lives we have to
[54:35] in countless situations always make sure
[54:39] that our objectives our motives are in
[54:42] tune and in line with God that we as an
[54:45] individual are completely reconciled to
[54:48] God and then the ministry of
[54:51] reconciliation Works through us and I
[54:53] want to just say this to you it's not
[54:55] just a one Stop Shop deal that it just
[54:58] well you know I've received the spirit
[55:00] of God so I'm part of the ministry of
[55:02] reconciliation you have to stay in a
[55:05] place to where your life remains as a
[55:09] channel to be reconciled in all areas of
[55:12] our life I can't get to that tonight but
[55:15] that's the that's the challenge and
[55:17] that's what Satan wants to work on is to
[55:20] try to hinder and block the
[55:23] channel true that's what he wants to try
[55:26] to do do he'll try to do that through
[55:28] discouragement he'll try to do that
[55:30] through uh frustration he'll try to do
[55:33] that through many different agencies but
[55:36] God's desire is that that Ministry of
[55:39] reconciliation remember he's the one in
[55:42] us that carries the message it's not us
[55:45] carrying the message it's Christ in US
[55:47] carrying the message because the message
[55:50] is of him glory to
[55:53] God that's what the holy ghost coming
[55:55] that's what it is now to ITT that go
[55:58] watch how Paul Paul brings this so that
[56:00] we can see our own selves to wit that
[56:02] God was in Christ Recon reconciling the
[56:06] world unto himself not imputing their
[56:10] trespasses unto them and hath committed
[56:13] unto us the word of reconciliation so in
[56:17] other words all of the trespasses could
[56:20] not hinder or stop God from fulfilling
[56:23] his word and once his word has been
[56:25] fulfilled then it's able to deal with
[56:28] the trespasses it's able to deal with
[56:31] the hindrances that we might be fully
[56:34] reconciled to God because not one of us
[56:37] could make ourselves fit to a place to
[56:40] be reconciled with God is that right
[56:44] John looked and he looked he saw in
[56:46] Heaven and Earth and saw no man
[56:51] worthy no one was
[56:53] worthy but then John receiv received a
[56:56] call there is one Behold the Lamb Worthy
[57:01] is the Lamb Glory the lamb that was
[57:04] slain before the foundation of the world
[57:06] that lamb that became preeminent in the
[57:09] body of Jesus Christ now that lamb walks
[57:12] forward with authority to say I have
[57:15] taken care of everything that they have
[57:18] done and all that was lost even that of
[57:21] creation I've come to fully claim what I
[57:25] have done
[57:26] yes Hallelujah I'm glad he's got the
[57:29] book in his hand aren't
[57:31] you I'm glad to be a recipient of that
[57:33] book
[57:34] tonight A recipient of that life now
[57:37] notice how he says this a word of
[57:40] reconciliation these are the this is the
[57:42] things oh God let our lives be so
[57:45] seasoned as we've talked in previous
[57:47] weeks on Words fit words that are spoke
[57:50] that it's words of
[57:53] reconciliation now then we are ambass
[57:56] adors for Christ amen so I'm not an
[57:58] ambassador for a church no I'm an
[58:01] ambassador for Christ am I'm not an
[58:04] ambassador to try to get people here we
[58:06] are ambassadors to try to get them to
[58:08] Christ because we know it's not a church
[58:11] that's changed us it was God who changed
[58:14] us even the understanding and the
[58:17] knowledge of the message did not change
[58:19] us but meeting the
[58:21] person that has changed our lives we are
[58:25] EMB ambassadors of Christ fully
[58:30] authorized Vindicated sealed agents of
[58:34] the most high God hallelujah just like
[58:37] when you can be looking at a person and
[58:39] you don't know who they are and how many
[58:40] times policemen have come up and they've
[58:42] pulled somebody over and they've
[58:44] arrested them and all of a sudden here
[58:45] the person pops out a badge they look
[58:47] like everybody else pling clothesman
[58:49] they blend right in the fbca whatever
[58:52] more they blend right in but they have a
[58:54] badge and it is a it is that of an
[58:57] authority that states who they are you
[58:59] and I do not look any different as far
[59:02] as we're made of the same flesh as every
[59:05] other person out there but there's one
[59:07] thing that separates you and I and
[59:09] that's the grace of God on display by
[59:12] the Seal of the Living God in our lives
[59:15] and that seal in our forehead in our
[59:17] heart it gives us a knowledge to walk we
[59:20] do not walk as other Gentiles will walk
[59:23] we walk as Sons and Daughters of God
[59:29] we're ambassadors of Christ amen as
[59:32] though God did beseech You by us so God
[59:35] used vessels to speak and to reach
[59:39] others they were not they did not become
[59:42] polites or Apollos sites or or
[59:46] branhamites but they became sons of God
[59:50] manifested through the vessels that God
[59:53] would
[59:54] use that's why that it's not the
[59:56] Highlight that we become a reflection of
[59:59] church to so much to where that someone
[1:00:01] says oh we can tell that if so and so is
[1:00:04] your pastor we don't want we don't want
[1:00:06] to Bear the image of a
[1:00:08] man we want to Bear the image of Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ that's why our glory is not some
[1:00:14] Doctrine our glory is the person of
[1:00:17] Jesus Christ on display in our
[1:00:21] lives sir
[1:00:23] Hallelujah yes sir we pray you notice we
[1:00:26] pray you in Christ's dead we're standing
[1:00:29] on his behalf be ye reconciled to God
[1:00:34] for he notice this declaration for he
[1:00:37] hath made him to be sin for us who knew
[1:00:41] no sin that we might be made the
[1:00:44] righteousness of God in Christ that's a
[1:00:47] powerful statement it points to him who
[1:00:50] was the innocent one I tell you the
[1:00:52] other day I I was listening to the to
[1:00:54] the message and how the prophet begin to
[1:00:56] speak about that and in the message of
[1:00:59] Grace and he says here was a here was a
[1:01:01] king he sent his son he said and there
[1:01:03] was one who rose up and he you know he
[1:01:06] he got in a moment of anger and he
[1:01:07] killed that son and and here he was on
[1:01:10] on the death penalty but then the king
[1:01:13] said I want to take a few moments and I
[1:01:15] want to go down and talk to this young
[1:01:16] man and he went down to talk to this
[1:01:18] young man as brother Ram tells a story
[1:01:20] and he got into that cell with that
[1:01:22] young man and he said the young man and
[1:01:24] he said why did you do it the young man
[1:01:26] said I was in a fit of rage he said I
[1:01:28] don't know why I did it I'm so sorry I
[1:01:30] did it I didn't mean to do it and he
[1:01:32] said the king walked out of the sell he
[1:01:34] said he went over and he got over on a
[1:01:36] desk and he took the record of that
[1:01:38] young man and he wrote pardoned on it
[1:01:41] and he said you have become my son this
[1:01:44] day oh my and to think about it the
[1:01:47] prophet said that's what he did for me
[1:01:49] we were guilty it was the iniquity of us
[1:01:53] all he hath laid on him it was for my
[1:01:56] sins that he was crucified I was that
[1:01:59] barabus and he took my
[1:02:02] place Hallelujah I didn't deserve it I
[1:02:05] didn't become good enough but God rich
[1:02:08] in
[1:02:10] Mercy a savior came down thank you Jesus
[1:02:14] hallu he took upon my sin your sin our
[1:02:17] shame that he might place within us his
[1:02:20] own life and bring us back to being Sons
[1:02:23] and Daughters of God again amen the holy
[1:02:26] ghost coming by way of the word loosens
[1:02:29] a Ministry and you and I are part of
[1:02:32] this ministry a matter of fact in
[1:02:34] questions and answerers 61 brother
[1:02:36] bradam gathering with a group of
[1:02:38] Brethren of ministers he says Brethren
[1:02:40] this message that God is given me he
[1:02:42] said we are together in this message we
[1:02:47] are messengers of this message and the
[1:02:50] prophet said when you have received the
[1:02:52] Holy Ghost in the Hebrew series now the
[1:02:55] spirit of God in you has brought you
[1:02:58] into a place you are messengers of the
[1:03:01] Covenant Christ through you is

[1:03:09] working of the Covenant keeping God in

[1:03:32] our savior let me just I I know I but I
[1:03:35] just want to I love I love the word of
[1:03:37] God I just want to rehearse some
[1:03:38] scripture here Jonah said clearly
[1:03:41] salvation is of the Lord amen Isaiah
[1:03:45] 43:11 I even I am the Lord and beside me
[1:03:49] there is no
[1:03:51] savior there ain't nobody else I alone
[1:03:55] am the savior
[1:03:56] Isaiah 45:
[1:03:58] 2122 tell ye and bring them near yay
[1:04:01] tell them and take counsel together who
[1:04:03] ha declared this from the ancient time
[1:04:06] who have told it from the time have not
[1:04:08] I the Lord there is no God else beside
[1:04:11] me a just God and a savior there is none
[1:04:15] beside me look unto me and be ye saved
[1:04:19] all the ends of the Earth for I am God
[1:04:22] and there is none else none else
[1:04:24] Hallelujah I'm glad that if that here
[1:04:26] the announcement comes look unto me look
[1:04:29] unto me who A finished work I'm your
[1:04:32] savior look on me aren't you glad if
[1:04:34] he's calling us to look then there must
[1:04:37] be a renting of the veil there must be a
[1:04:40] loosening of the seals it must be where
[1:04:43] Christ is coming in plain view to where
[1:04:46] the worshipper can look and see a
[1:04:48] finished work they can see themselves in
[1:04:51] Christ they can recognize my enemy is
[1:04:54] dead they can recognize I am more than
[1:04:57] an
[1:04:58] overcomer I wish I had more voice I wish
[1:05:01] I had more strength because that is the
[1:05:04] authority that overcomes every of
[1:05:07] Satan's poison breath is being able to
[1:05:10] look and see him our Mighty conqueror
[1:05:14] and you and I are tied into that yes
[1:05:17] we're tied into that it's already begun
[1:05:19] in your life it's already begun in your
[1:05:22] life he changed he changed your nature
[1:05:24] and then when test and trials have kind
[1:05:26] to come your way and Satan is one to
[1:05:28] knock you down there has been a
[1:05:29] resurrection power within you that has
[1:05:32] brought you right back into places again
[1:05:35] with God it is God working in your
[1:05:40] life my 1 Timothy 2 for this is good and
[1:05:46] acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:05:49] savior right who will have all men to be
[1:05:52] saved that's God's desire is it all
[1:05:55] would be saved and to come unto the
[1:05:58] knowledge of the truth God's desire what
[1:06:00] is the knowledge of the truth it's not
[1:06:03] it's not a a a knowledge as far as facts
[1:06:07] but the knowledge of the truth is to
[1:06:09] having that understanding of his life
[1:06:11] dwelling in us what he come to do in us
[1:06:16] and listen to come to that place and to
[1:06:18] come to that realization once he's come
[1:06:20] in of who's on the
[1:06:22] inside Hallelujah did you catch that to
[1:06:26] recognize who has come into your life
[1:06:28] and to recognize what his purpose is to
[1:06:32] do did you catch that see it's not
[1:06:35] something that all of a sudden here the
[1:06:37] knowledge of the truth has come in and
[1:06:39] then from that moment on man there's
[1:06:41] there's no battle no now there becomes a
[1:06:43] battle but now in the realization of
[1:06:45] that it's giving the preeminence to the
[1:06:48] truth himself who is Christ don't you to
[1:06:52] love that sir my think about that for
[1:06:55] there is one God and one mediator
[1:06:58] between God and Men the man Christ Jesus
[1:07:02] un who gave himself a ransom for all to
[1:07:05] be testified in due time oh my for
[1:07:09] therefore notice how Paul words this we
[1:07:11] both labor and suffer reproach because
[1:07:14] we trust in the Living God who is the
[1:07:17] savior of all men especially those that
[1:07:23] believe you see he's a SA savior of all
[1:07:26] yeah he is is that right he gave his
[1:07:29] life for all but he came with his mind
[1:07:32] upon those in the book of redemption but
[1:07:35] notice if there had not been a fall
[1:07:38] there would have been many that would
[1:07:39] have never populated upon the Earth but
[1:07:42] God even in the midst of the Fall there
[1:07:45] are many names that are written outside
[1:07:48] of the little section there are many
[1:07:50] names that are written in the Book of
[1:07:53] Life is that right there's many that's
[1:07:56] why brother Ram would say it over and
[1:07:57] over if it's a Catholic man and he's
[1:07:58] trusting in the church for his salvation
[1:08:01] he's lost but if he's trusting in the
[1:08:03] Lord Jesus Christ he's
[1:08:05] saved right he said that about the
[1:08:07] Methodist goes on down now he didn't say
[1:08:09] well that's a part of the Bride he's
[1:08:10] talking about they have believed and
[1:08:13] they are
[1:08:14] saved now if God's if God's desire and
[1:08:18] they and and they are aart they they
[1:08:20] listen they were then always apart in
[1:08:22] God's mind and a part of the word then
[1:08:24] let me tell you something God will not
[1:08:26] leave hoof
[1:08:28] behind God won't do it thank you Jesus
[1:08:31] sometimes it might take a lot of things
[1:08:33] where God has to work on a
[1:08:36] life it'll come it'll things will drop
[1:08:39] here and drop there and drop there look
[1:08:42] at that he Pharaoh didn't let him go
[1:08:45] after the first plague fell no
[1:08:48] stubbornness resistance but you know
[1:08:51] what that showed if we can look at it in
[1:08:53] this way and instead of looking at it
[1:08:54] and say man why didn't he let him go man
[1:08:57] why haven't they come yet man why
[1:08:59] haven't they turned around yet but look
[1:09:01] at how God God's not going to give up on
[1:09:04] one of his words he's not going to give
[1:09:07] up on one of his children I'm telling
[1:09:09] you claim your children God is not
[1:09:12] giving up on one he'll move he'll move
[1:09:14] everything to get to one of his
[1:09:18] children Hallelujah it don't matter they
[1:09:20] may not have come or they may not be
[1:09:22] here when the first plague is Fallen
[1:09:24] second plague but God is still a god of
[1:09:27] his word and he didn't send a
[1:09:30] message into your life to come back
[1:09:32] empty handed
[1:09:35] Glory
[1:09:37] Hallelujah glory be to God I'm talking
[1:09:40] about a
[1:09:41] savior
[1:09:43] Hallelujah notice acts 5:30 the god of
[1:09:47] our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew
[1:09:51] and hanged on a tree him hath God
[1:09:54] exalted with his right hand to be a
[1:09:58] prince and a savior he's the prince of
[1:10:01] the kings of the earth he's the chief
[1:10:04] one he he's the author he he's he's the
[1:10:07] now he's the one that was the example to
[1:10:09] say this is how it was back there in
[1:10:11] Eden this is how it was with Adam and
[1:10:14] now I have come to restore what has been
[1:10:16] lost I have come to redeem my children
[1:10:20] he's prince and a savior for to give
[1:10:25] repentance to Israel in forgiveness of
[1:10:27] sins so it what what is it all about
[1:10:30] what what is what what is the objective
[1:10:32] for the preaching of the Gospel under
[1:10:34] the inspiration of God what's the
[1:10:36] objective in your life has God lead you
[1:10:38] to witness and God would lead you to
[1:10:41] maybe to speak to somebody else or you
[1:10:43] know to contact another brother or
[1:10:45] sister in church and you know maybe just
[1:10:47] to to encourage them or you know maybe
[1:10:49] as we would go to to pray for them what
[1:10:51] what is our objective well our objective
[1:10:53] is certainly we know that we can't save
[1:10:55] nobody we can't heal nobody but we know
[1:10:58] the God who is more than
[1:11:02] enough we know the God who saves We Know
[1:11:05] The God Who heals and so the objective
[1:11:08] is is God let my life just be a channel
[1:11:12] that Faith their faith can be built to
[1:11:17] the place of the finished work to where
[1:11:19] they can see it's finished to where they
[1:11:22] can see I'm already healed to where they
[1:11:25] can see amen I'm already saved they can
[1:11:28] see God's Redemptive plan God sweeten
[1:11:31] our actions sweeten our our our words
[1:11:34] give us the right words in the right
[1:11:37] season at the right time is that
[1:11:41] right oh my faith to it's faith in a
[1:11:45] finished work and this is why look how
[1:11:47] brother BR says this because remember
[1:11:48] how many times brother Brandon was
[1:11:50] accused or you know they would say this
[1:11:51] Dr best was one of them that said it
[1:11:53] down in Houston of saying well you know
[1:11:55] Here Comes This Divine healer and over
[1:11:56] and over brother Brandon faced that and
[1:11:58] he said well you know if you say I'm a
[1:12:01] Divine healer by saying go into this
[1:12:03] hospital and empty everybody up you be a
[1:12:05] Divine healer he said well then I'll say
[1:12:06] to you go into the bar down the street
[1:12:08] and you be a divine
[1:12:12] Savior and he said no more than you
[1:12:15] could be a divine Savior I'm not a
[1:12:17] Divine
[1:12:18] healer but God's the Healer and God is
[1:12:20] the savior amen is that right and he he
[1:12:24] he moves right down and he'll he'll
[1:12:25] crawl he'll step over this one step over
[1:12:27] that step over there he'll get he'll get
[1:12:29] to the one let me tell you when God
[1:12:31] coming down there to the pool of beest
[1:12:33] and he stepped over this one stepped
[1:12:34] over that one moved there you know what
[1:12:36] that was all about that was not showing
[1:12:38] that God was lacking in compassion but
[1:12:40] his compassion was tied to the will of
[1:12:44] God you see sometimes this is why the
[1:12:47] prophet would take time with that and
[1:12:48] said sometimes he said we get human
[1:12:52] compassion confused with God's
[1:12:54] compassion
[1:12:56] because you say what's IND different
[1:12:57] human compassion is always about
[1:13:00] reconciling Humanity with Humanity but
[1:13:03] Godly compassion is reconciling with God
[1:13:06] because that's the lasting work right
[1:13:09] it's just like if somebody you know here
[1:13:11] have compassion and somebody all of a
[1:13:13] sudden comes and they learn the message
[1:13:15] they know the message but if they've not
[1:13:17] met the Lord Jesus Christ it's only a
[1:13:19] matter of time that if they they don't
[1:13:22] need him to wear something a website or
[1:13:24] this or that may not even be that it
[1:13:26] just may here it just just walk right
[1:13:28] away but this is why it's not about
[1:13:30] learning the message it's meeting the
[1:13:33] person of Jesus Christ that's what it's
[1:13:36] all about because he's the one that
[1:13:38] gives us Victory let me tell you
[1:13:39] something we don't stand there and
[1:13:41] defeat the devil on a daily basis by
[1:13:43] being able to recite Doctrine Doctrine
[1:13:46] just belongs to us are you hearing me
[1:13:49] the right Doctrine belongs to us because
[1:13:51] the spirit of Truth has come to lead and
[1:13:54] guide us into all truth but we're
[1:13:57] standing there knowing who we
[1:13:59] are knowing that we've been redeemed
[1:14:02] knowing that his life is working within
[1:14:04] us and we stand on those sacred Sands
[1:14:07] where the devil can't put his dirty feet
[1:14:11] Glory Hallelujah and who did that a
[1:14:14] savior Hallelujah now watch brother R
[1:14:17] says in believing God he says there you
[1:14:20] are he's talking about that Divine
[1:14:21] healer divine Savior there you are faith
[1:14:23] in the word you couldn't say save no one
[1:14:25] preaching the gospel of Salvation
[1:14:27] doesn't make you a divine Savior no more
[1:14:29] than preaching Divine Healing makes me a
[1:14:31] Divine healer but it's faith in God's
[1:14:34] spoken word yeah and he said and I know
[1:14:37] this that some of us has more faith than
[1:14:39] others and those who have abundance of
[1:14:41] Faith are supposed to pray for those but
[1:14:43] if you don't live the right kind of life
[1:14:45] you better leave away from it the devil
[1:14:47] will laugh at your prayer but when you
[1:14:49] live right and do right and act right
[1:14:52] and have faith in God Satan will tremble
[1:14:54] with when you speak cuz God swore under
[1:14:58] obligation he take care of that prayer
[1:15:02] yes he will Hallelujah I say God let us
[1:15:06] be channels
[1:15:09] Lord now remember there like man told us
[1:15:11] here there's a lot of different
[1:15:13] diversity diversity of gifts diversity
[1:15:16] of administrations Paul lays that out in
[1:15:18] the body God don't want us being all

[1:15:22] has a whole a whole tool chest full of
[1:15:24] nothing nothing but Philip
[1:15:27] screwdrivers sometimes you need a plier
[1:15:29] sometimes you need a flathead
[1:15:30] screwdriver is that right you need all
[1:15:33] different types of tools is that right I
[1:15:36] mean there's there's a need for
[1:15:37] different tools and God has so fixed it
[1:15:41] in our lives each of us are an
[1:15:43] instrument for his glory
[1:15:47] am and God ain't going to use you as a
[1:15:49] flathead screwdriver to pound a nail in
[1:15:51] the
[1:15:53] wall he you know what my brother has
[1:15:56] that gift my brother Hammer come on over
[1:15:58] here you know what that is when pride
[1:16:01] has been knocked out it ain't about it
[1:16:03] don't matter who gets the glory god gets
[1:16:05] the glory I know a brother I know this I
[1:16:07] come on over here brother Hammer come on
[1:16:09] over brother screwdriver come on over
[1:16:11] brother brother brother pliers come on
[1:16:14] over here brother needle noose oh my I'm
[1:16:16] so thankful for the Arsenal that God has
[1:16:19] in his
[1:16:21] body and let me just tell you the truth
[1:16:23] you and I are not a not Swiss pocket
[1:16:26] knives where we've got all sorts of
[1:16:27] things and pulling out this and pulling
[1:16:29] out that a spoon a fork a knife and a
[1:16:31] cork breaker and everything else nope we
[1:16:34] are instruments and God don't expect us
[1:16:36] to do what he called somebody else to do
[1:16:39] that's right amen he's the great Diamond
[1:16:42] that shines through it
[1:16:44] all but in the midst of it if we just
[1:16:46] settle upon this God recognizing the
[1:16:49] strength of Our Lives for God to move
[1:16:53] through our life lives as a
[1:16:57] savior now I want you to think this is
[1:16:59] why it comes from drawing drawing from
[1:17:02] the right Source how many know we got to
[1:17:05] draw from the right Source you know you
[1:17:07] got to you know it's like I said if you
[1:17:08] don't you plug that that that extension
[1:17:10] cord into the wrong to the wrong thing
[1:17:12] you plug into one that where maybe
[1:17:14] there's a wire or something that's you
[1:17:15] know messed up in that in that extension
[1:17:17] cord I don't know if you've ever had to
[1:17:18] do that sometimes in lamps I've had to
[1:17:20] take that off and replace and rehook
[1:17:22] that wire and and you know it wasn't
[1:17:23] that it needed a whole new set up in
[1:17:25] that lamp it's just something got loose
[1:17:27] it got shorted out from what
[1:17:31] use yeah now listen the holy ghost in
[1:17:36] your soul never gets
[1:17:38] old the Garment of Salvation which is
[1:17:42] the holy spirit never wears out that's
[1:17:46] what Israel experienced in a type when
[1:17:49] they walk through the Wilderness when
[1:17:51] their shoes didn't wear out and their
[1:17:52] clothes didn't get be God God was using
[1:17:55] that as a type that there's an
[1:17:56] experience that won't wear out thank you
[1:18:01] but that other part this garment this
[1:18:03] garment that gets older uglier I'm just
[1:18:06] speaking from me I I I see I see I see
[1:18:09] pictures of me and and then dear God I
[1:18:13] mean really I mean I look at let me get
[1:18:15] a hat on quick I don't want to flash you
[1:18:17] know I mean when I'm looking at this
[1:18:19] thing is the one that gets tired gets
[1:18:21] weary gets weak gets troubled I'm
[1:18:24] talking about our flesh and our spirit
[1:18:26] but notice this is why we are drawing
[1:18:28] from the source of Living Waters and
[1:18:31] that's why Satan battles against that
[1:18:35] Source because he knows the authority
[1:18:39] that's in it and that you and I are
[1:18:42] called to be
[1:18:43] channels that's why he battles it listen
[1:18:45] your prayer life it's not just about you
[1:18:48] you're reading and giving to the word
[1:18:49] it's not just about you you see as
[1:18:51] you're taking that word in it not only
[1:18:53] comes in but now it moves moves in our
[1:18:55] lives and it comes
[1:18:57] out right I mean when when when you ate
[1:19:00] your carne aada today did you determine
[1:19:02] and say this carneada it's going to go
[1:19:03] down and the you know the the the red
[1:19:05] blood settles in this right here I
[1:19:06] needed some iron so it's going to go
[1:19:08] down into my toe there and it's going to
[1:19:10] take care of that place I got on my toe
[1:19:11] and there you didn't determine that no
[1:19:13] or you'd be
[1:19:15] stay it's been a while since I had some
[1:19:17] of that but you you don't determine that
[1:19:20] when I eat the rice the rice is going to
[1:19:22] go here and it's going to break down
[1:19:23] this the complex car you don't need you
[1:19:25] don't worry about that the nutrients in
[1:19:28] it find themselves in the in your life
[1:19:30] and that's how it is with the word of
[1:19:32] God it's packed with the gospel it's
[1:19:35] packed with what you and I have need of
[1:19:37] and it will go to work in every area of
[1:19:40] our life where you and I have need of it
[1:19:42] you know what that is it's taking our
[1:19:43] mind off of our problems and focusing on
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ amen because this word has
[1:19:51] power in it it has glory in it has
[1:19:53] transforming power in it it has the
[1:19:55] vitamins that's needed in it to go to
[1:19:58] work in our life I don't have to tell
[1:20:00] the word where to go the word knows
[1:20:02] where to
[1:20:03] go and then it'll work out in my life
[1:20:06] you know like after you ate you're no
[1:20:08] longer hangry you you comfortable to be
[1:20:13] around some people got that one drawn
[1:20:16] from the source of Living Waters notice
[1:20:19] 1 Timothy 4:15 meditate notice how Paul
[1:20:23] writes to Timothy medit meditate upon
[1:20:26] these things your mind give your mind
[1:20:28] give your heart meditate upon these
[1:20:30] things give thyself holy to them that
[1:20:34] thy profiting may appear to all now it's
[1:20:38] not the objective is that you might have
[1:20:41] some glorious appearance no meditate
[1:20:44] upon these things give yourself to them
[1:20:47] is not not what Jesus said hide thyself
[1:20:50] away in the closet prayeth to him that
[1:20:52] seeth in secret and he that seeth in
[1:20:54] hearing in secret will reward thee
[1:20:57] openly what is it speaking of there is a
[1:21:02] manifestation for a life that's being
[1:21:04] hidden
[1:21:06] away and there's also effects when we're
[1:21:08] not hiding away like we should is that
[1:21:12] right leaves become
[1:21:14] prickers it goes from a beautiful oak
[1:21:17] tree oh I didn't know it was a cactus we
[1:21:19] got we got we we got Cactus here in
[1:21:21] lorine no no
[1:21:22] no come on friends we I I'm speaking all
[1:21:25] of us all of us notice what he said take
[1:21:30] heed unto
[1:21:32] thyself and unto the doctrine so un
[1:21:35] giving what is he speaking he's letting
[1:21:37] Paul he's letting Timothy know give
[1:21:39] yourself to the message of the hour to
[1:21:43] that reality that God has manifested his
[1:21:46] glory he is our
[1:21:51] savior and continue in them that's a
[1:21:55] challenge to continue means keep
[1:21:58] moving don't don't become sedentary
[1:22:00] don't become complacent keep moving for
[1:22:03] in doing this this is the result then
[1:22:06] for in doing this Thou shalt both save
[1:22:09] thyself and them that hear thee praise
[1:22:13] God so sometimes we're looking and
[1:22:15] saying God I I I'm praying for this and
[1:22:17] we should pray Lord I I you know I'm I'm
[1:22:19] I'm working trying to make contact but
[1:22:20] you know what don't become discouraged
[1:22:22] by what you're not seeing keep giving
[1:22:25] yourself to the Lord because after all
[1:22:27] it's going to be him that turns their
[1:22:30] heart it's going to be him and us as we
[1:22:34] give ourselves to him not only will you
[1:22:35] save yourself so in other words here we
[1:22:38] are giving oursel to the word what
[1:22:40] happens all of our frustrations
[1:22:42] everything that we sometimes get so
[1:22:43] bottled up Lord I am doing this Lord I'm
[1:22:46] I'm really loving them Lord I'm really
[1:22:48] doing it Lord I'm really loving them
[1:22:50] Lord and they're and they're just acting
[1:22:52] mean and terrible and everything Lord
[1:22:54] I'm loving them and as we get just keep
[1:22:57] praying and get staying in his presence
[1:22:59] we begin to realize I'm not loving them
[1:23:02] like you love them amen I'm loving them
[1:23:06] how I love them right Lord I need a
[1:23:10] refilling of the love of God I need a
[1:23:12] refilling of the holy spirit so see what
[1:23:14] happens Thou shalt save thyself and
[1:23:17] others that hear thee you see what
[1:23:18] happens is that as we stay in God's
[1:23:21] presence then there's things that can be
[1:23:23] made right
[1:23:25] in our own hearts and our own lives that
[1:23:27] when we go out of there isn't it
[1:23:29] wonderful where you can go to the Lord
[1:23:30] and cast and leave your burdens there
[1:23:33] sometimes you're leaving burdens you
[1:23:34] didn't even realize you were carrying
[1:23:35] his burdens and you're able to leave
[1:23:36] them there and you walk out of there and
[1:23:37] you realize what you thought was the
[1:23:39] problem was not the problem and the
[1:23:41] burden has been let down and now Thou
[1:23:44] shalt save thyself and others that hear
[1:23:47] thee oh my oh my you say brother Samuel
[1:23:50] that that Paul was talking to ministers
[1:23:52] he let me tell you something whether or
[1:23:54] not you're you're a minister every one
[1:23:55] of us
[1:23:56] preach and I'm not talking about those
[1:23:59] who do it on Facebook I'm talking about
[1:24:01] that every one of us preach through our
[1:24:03] lives you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:05] every one of us you your life your life
[1:24:07] preaches sermons true you think I preach
[1:24:10] series your life prees
[1:24:13] series part
[1:24:17] 335 notice how brother R talks about
[1:24:20] this creative power everybody all right
[1:24:23] he said this creative power
[1:24:24] familiar point I want you to think about
[1:24:26] just this thought on the creative power
[1:24:28] of God I want you to think about what it
[1:24:30] is that's laying inside of you that's
[1:24:33] what the prophet would spend that time
[1:24:35] in the message in 1949 the deity of
[1:24:37] Jesus Christ to get the people to
[1:24:38] recognize what is in them
[1:24:41] right that same deity that created the
[1:24:45] heavens and the Earth lays inside of you
[1:24:49] the same God who who who who set forth
[1:24:54] and brought all of this is the same God
[1:24:56] that has created and brought forth a new
[1:25:00] creation in your
[1:25:04] life it's to dwell upon
[1:25:07] that the creative power of God brother B
[1:25:09] says with the token get ready apply it
[1:25:12] believe it clean up let your children
[1:25:14] let your family let your loved ones see
[1:25:16] it in you it'll take an effect no let
[1:25:20] see it just let him see it let Lord help
[1:25:24] me me to get out of the way that that's
[1:25:25] all they can see am he goes on to say
[1:25:29] then apply the token in prayer with
[1:25:32] consideration with believing and with
[1:25:34] such love till you know it's going to
[1:25:38] take place it's going to take place
[1:25:39] apply it in confidence believing it's
[1:25:41] going to help and when you talk to that
[1:25:44] child notice now here's how the applying
[1:25:46] comes there's a confidence what's our
[1:25:48] confidence in it's not my confidence is
[1:25:50] is when I go talk to little Aaron he's
[1:25:52] going to turn around no I I it with
[1:25:55] confidence confidence in what confidence
[1:25:58] in God who is in you oh that's good
[1:26:02] that's where Satan many times gets us
[1:26:04] and we get frustrated because we've
[1:26:06] walked out and we're so enthused we have
[1:26:09] such confidence but our confidence God
[1:26:11] wants you to look to the god who's in
[1:26:14] you what he did in you he'll do for
[1:26:18] others God let me get so much in your
[1:26:21] hands let me so commit myself in your
[1:26:25] hands to where you take control Lord now
[1:26:29] when I go talk to
[1:26:31] him my confidence is in God my
[1:26:36] savior when you talk to that child when
[1:26:39] you talk to your husband talk to your
[1:26:42] wife talk to this loved one believe that
[1:26:45] it's going to help true so you've got to
[1:26:47] have a
[1:26:49] relationship it's got to be
[1:26:51] relationship and it's it's talk it's is
[1:26:54] talking believing it's going to help oh
[1:26:58] yeah absolutely right if I can just be
[1:27:03] that extension cord from right here and
[1:27:06] take it back where Brother Carlos is at
[1:27:08] here I am I'm I'm walking around right
[1:27:09] where it's at I've got something that I
[1:27:11] can apply to the
[1:27:13] situation I've got something I can't
[1:27:15] apply to it I can take it there but if I
[1:27:17] just leave the extension cord right
[1:27:19] there here he is back there in need but
[1:27:21] I know what's in me I I know what's in
[1:27:24] my life I know what's changed me and you
[1:27:26] see you what look what it's doing it's
[1:27:28] removing Confidence from our own
[1:27:31] selves and it's putting confidence in
[1:27:34] the word of God cuz heavens and earth
[1:27:35] will pass away but my word shall never
[1:27:38] fail and God has given you a positive
[1:27:41] word and that positive word is what is
[1:27:43] on the inside of
[1:27:45] you he spoke the word is that right and
[1:27:48] then he raised the standard again the
[1:27:51] second time the word became flesh and
[1:27:53] then he raised it to a higher standard
[1:27:55] now it's flesh in you with the Holy
[1:27:57] Ghost oh yeah same God working what does
[1:28:00] it do it brings a positive experience in
[1:28:02] a positive
[1:28:04] God oh Hallelujah believe that it's
[1:28:07] going to help what what he said just
[1:28:10] stand there and say Lord I've claimed
[1:28:14] them they're mine I'm getting them for
[1:28:18] you Lord who's the mind you recognize
[1:28:22] that you're standing as an ambassador
[1:28:24] for Christ no hands but his hands no
[1:28:27] feet but his feet I'm standing here Lord
[1:28:30] and I'm claiming them for you they're
[1:28:36] mine but there all there's and Satan
[1:28:39] says but look how they are and look at
[1:28:41] the situation but they're
[1:28:44] mine look at the condition look at how
[1:28:47] terrible they are but they're
[1:28:49] mine you see there's got to be something
[1:28:51] in your heart like it was in moses'
[1:28:53] heart that's able to look past oh yeah
[1:28:57] the condition that Israel wasin and see
[1:29:00] the promise of God that God has given
[1:29:02] you it will not return back to him void
[1:29:05] amen it has produced in your life and it
[1:29:08] will work and it does work in you and
[1:29:10] through you oh yeah it's creative power
[1:29:14] that's working in our lives apply it and
[1:29:17] create that atmosphere around you that
[1:29:19] they'll just drop right into it if
[1:29:21] you've got the token you create a spirit
[1:29:24] around you a power that when you walk
[1:29:27] people know that you're a
[1:29:31] Christian we don't we don't have to have
[1:29:33] anything we don't have to have even
[1:29:34] symbols we don't have to have you know a
[1:29:36] cross I believe in having a cross in my
[1:29:38] car but it it we're not known by
[1:29:41] symbols the way as we our life is
[1:29:44] lived the way the life is lived the
[1:29:47] conduct the atmosphere the presence of
[1:29:50] God that's around us that that others
[1:29:52] cannot put their finger on what it is is
[1:29:54] but it's something about his presence
[1:29:56] that's what makes you and I different
[1:29:59] because we are made up with the same
[1:30:01] dirt calcium potish petroleum is
[1:30:03] everybody else but there's something
[1:30:05] different on the inside that's his
[1:30:07] presence and aren't you thankful there
[1:30:10] was a seed on the inside that could
[1:30:11] capture his presence aren't you think
[1:30:14] well there was a seed that pursued after
[1:30:17] his presence my I feel like preaching it
[1:30:21] was a seed in Jacob that that that that
[1:30:24] sought for the glory to be made manifest
[1:30:26] in his life what was that that seed of
[1:30:28] God it was that seed in Tamar that rose
[1:30:31] up and said I've got to have that life
[1:30:34] I've got to be one raised up to the name
[1:30:36] of my husband there was something
[1:30:38] operating within
[1:30:40] her nothing was going to stand in her
[1:30:43] way from that work of Kinsmen being
[1:30:47] fulfilled you know what that is that's
[1:30:49] why the prophet says it like this in
[1:30:50] unveiling of God and he's talking about
[1:30:53] how God has become one of us and he's
[1:30:55] talking about brought it right down to
[1:30:57] the present hour We're living and he
[1:30:59] speaks of how that God when God became
[1:31:02] man God became one of us God operating
[1:31:05] through the Flesh of his son Jesus
[1:31:08] Christ he was manifesting the attribute
[1:31:12] of Redeemer and savior and deliverer and
[1:31:16] it was not only temporal in other words
[1:31:19] that saving was not temporal once he
[1:31:22] saves you from your sins you can you
[1:31:23] can't go back once Redemption has been
[1:31:27] experienced you can't go
[1:31:29] back are you hearing me now I'm talking
[1:31:31] about something that now is no longer
[1:31:33] just a type but the
[1:31:35] antitype and now that same anointing
[1:31:38] Works Upon Our Life when now the prophet
[1:31:41] moves it to the place to showing us that
[1:31:44] where the word has become flesh in this
[1:31:49] hour you think about it if you can if we
[1:31:51] can just grasp this the work that God
[1:31:54] has done all the way down Through the
[1:31:56] Ages and then in this end time with the
[1:31:59] message of the hour it
[1:32:02] shows the power of the blood of Jesus
[1:32:06] Christ Glory because God can take
[1:32:10] vessels and he God works through
[1:32:13] redeemed vessels it shows the power of
[1:32:16] the blood to dismantle all that was
[1:32:19] against you it shows the power of the
[1:32:21] blood to break it all up and send it and
[1:32:23] scatter it away it shows the power of
[1:32:26] the blood to break every bit of sins
[1:32:28] hold it shows the power of the blood to
[1:32:31] bring you back to your rightful place in
[1:32:34] the Lamb's Book of Life That's The Power
[1:32:36] of coming under the blood that God would
[1:32:38] take a vessel without a seventh grade
[1:32:41] education and God was not ashamed to
[1:32:45] make his glory
[1:32:47] known and God's not ashamed to make his
[1:32:50] glory known through your life preach
[1:32:53] with with me now a minute think it not
[1:32:56] robbery to be equal with God that's the
[1:33:00] power of the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:33:03] comes to loosen you from sin's Hope and
[1:33:06] it lets you know this is what God has
[1:33:08] always thought about you he's known
[1:33:11] about you you are one of
[1:33:14] his and he works through redeemed
[1:33:17] subjects to
[1:33:20] redeem the work of redemption goes on
[1:33:23] the work of redemption is working on
[1:33:25] it's going on it's going on that that
[1:33:27] that that that that that uh that that uh
[1:33:29] what do we call it in a race what do you
[1:33:31] call it in a track race a baton you pass
[1:33:34] a baton so it's like it goes from me and
[1:33:36] you pass it on and then the next one
[1:33:38] takes it runs a little bit passes it on
[1:33:40] passes it on that's what's happened down
[1:33:42] through the seven Church ages that's why
[1:33:45] the prophet said there was always an
[1:33:47] overlapping in the ages why it's a
[1:33:49] passing on of the Baton and in the end
[1:33:52] time
[1:33:53] what was they passing they were passing
[1:33:55] on that life and God said I will
[1:34:00] restore that life will come into the
[1:34:03] full resurrection power and
[1:34:06] glory in a
[1:34:08] people it's Redeemer anointing at work
[1:34:14] what is it that moves in your heart to
[1:34:16] go after your loved ones what is it that
[1:34:19] moves in your heart to go after others
[1:34:22] let me just say it like this
[1:34:25] they're outside of your circle
[1:34:27] somebody's got to be the Redeemer to go
[1:34:29] bring them
[1:34:32] in you hearing me now very simple these
[1:34:35] are these are very tremendous principles
[1:34:38] of redemption that
[1:34:39] God places in our
[1:34:42] hands for
[1:34:44] us what do we do Redeemer anointing you
[1:34:49] see what it is it works under
[1:34:50] reconciliation where did reconciliation
[1:34:52] start in the mind of God in the heart of
[1:34:55] God where does reconciliation start it
[1:34:58] starts in your heart the desire it
[1:35:00] begins in your heart forgiveness begins
[1:35:02] to work and there's a desire for
[1:35:04] reconciliation a desire for Harmony and
[1:35:07] God as we give to him he brings it all
[1:35:13] to
[1:35:15] pass God restores
[1:35:18] relationships God restores marriages God
[1:35:21] restores heart listen if he did look how
[1:35:23] many times how many times we heard
[1:35:24] brother Ram say if if if he if he that
[1:35:27] inspiration he says and I have heard but
[1:35:28] I see he said if that inspiration
[1:35:30] dropped to save you won't that same
[1:35:33] inspiration drop for healing in your
[1:35:35] body sir won't the same inspiration let
[1:35:37] me just say like this I want to just
[1:35:39] I'll just say it like this let's just
[1:35:41] make such a declaration from our hearts
[1:35:42] Lord I don't want no roadblocks on
[1:35:46] reconciliation I want my heart open to
[1:35:49] you because I can trust everything that
[1:35:52] God does I can put my foot on you you
[1:35:55] might tell me you buildt a set of stairs
[1:35:56] you might tell me you set out a ladder
[1:35:58] but I don't know you may not have put
[1:35:59] that ladder out all the way that ladder
[1:36:01] may not be able to handle my weight I
[1:36:02] don't know that but I do know one thing
[1:36:04] I can stand on I can stand on God's word
[1:36:07] and if I'm looking for God's word to be
[1:36:09] fulfilled then there's a place I can put
[1:36:11] my foot on cuz God's desire is for us to
[1:36:13] walk in shity in confidence and in
[1:36:15] stability amen you love him AB man I
[1:36:19] wish I had more time yes yes sir
[1:36:24] let me just try to try to wrap it here
[1:36:26] on this right
[1:36:28] here God works through
[1:36:32] man I say try to wrap it right here I
[1:36:35] some of you thinking what's the time
[1:36:36] when we
[1:36:37] on but I I don't want to give you I
[1:36:39] don't want to give too much of it God
[1:36:41] works through man I want you just to
[1:36:43] think of this here I want you to think
[1:36:45] of this just a moment I didn't put this
[1:36:47] quote up but I'm going to read it
[1:36:49] brother bramman says and God's gifts
[1:36:50] always find their places he said that he
[1:36:54] came to redeem the whole creation and
[1:36:56] nothing could do it but God himself
[1:36:59] that's the reason that God does nothing
[1:37:02] outside of a man he always works through
[1:37:06] a man because he had to use a man a man
[1:37:10] is what he had to use to display his
[1:37:14] attribute of
[1:37:17] Savior so God's not about to change his
[1:37:20] program now that's right brother
[1:37:24] Samuel look at
[1:37:26] me you're we're we're we're we're in the
[1:37:29] right spot we're in the right spot for
[1:37:31] him to use this God help us to continue
[1:37:33] look at me me Lord how how could you use
[1:37:37] me how could you use me but see that
[1:37:40] shows you the power of the blood yeah
[1:37:44] you see what the power of the blood is
[1:37:45] it ain't about just coming and getting
[1:37:47] something that's powerful enough to take
[1:37:48] care of every stain in your life it's
[1:37:50] about the power of the blood that's able
[1:37:52] to kill kill yes sin nature and that
[1:37:57] quickening power raises up that seed on
[1:37:59] the inside listen to me God will not be
[1:38:02] called an
[1:38:03] adulterer so he cannot marry a woman
[1:38:06] who's got a living
[1:38:07] husband are you hearing me now Romans 7
[1:38:10] so what does he have to do he kills that
[1:38:12] old man not only is he divorced put away
[1:38:16] but he comes and he bring death comes to
[1:38:18] that man but then very quickly God
[1:38:20] raises up that seed on the inside and he
[1:38:23] ites himself with that life on the
[1:38:26] inside and so now that's why this is why
[1:38:29] like Rahab you can look back where are
[1:38:32] thine
[1:38:37] accusers there is
[1:38:39] none there is
[1:38:41] none that's what that's what the prophet
[1:38:43] tells us in souls in prison on and on
[1:38:45] and on you find such a beautiful thing
[1:38:46] as brother R says that and souls in
[1:38:48] prison what God has worked on all along
[1:38:50] is to get that first nature to agree
[1:38:53] with him him and then he kills
[1:38:58] it and then he raises
[1:39:00] up that which was always there on the
[1:39:06] inside don't you love him let me finish
[1:39:09] reading this quote here A man is what he
[1:39:12] had to use to redeem or to display his
[1:39:16] attribute of savior he had to make him
[1:39:19] in his image make him something like him
[1:39:21] and put him on free moral agency and let
[1:39:23] him act any way he wanted to act he
[1:39:25] could he could take his choice and he
[1:39:27] knew that man by giving him a choice
[1:39:29] would fall so being that he had to do
[1:39:32] that he turns back around and makes the
[1:39:35] man a partner to him and does nothing
[1:39:39] except he does it through a man the
[1:39:43] whole work of Redemption come by a man
[1:39:45] so the whole key is it's God doing it
[1:39:49] not us but it's God doing it
[1:39:54] oh brother BR said death come by the
[1:39:56] first man life come by the second Adam
[1:39:58] there you are he does nothing because he
[1:40:01] had to use a man for that and he uses a
[1:40:03] man to redeem back again so deity become
[1:40:06] a child he become in the form of sin
[1:40:10] that he might redeem The
[1:40:14] Sinner God has
[1:40:16] always and will always work through the
[1:40:19] agency of
[1:40:21] man man that he has redeemed in order to
[1:40:27] display his Redemption through don't you
[1:40:31] love him me to say
[1:40:34] Lord just flow through me Lord Lord
[1:40:38] Brother br will say in Christ the
[1:40:39] mystery he'll say in perfect Faith
[1:40:41] you're familiar with it he'll say as we
[1:40:43] receive the word we become the word am
[1:40:47] he says as he said what the faith of God
[1:40:49] is is that of a Believer is the faith of
[1:40:52] God that flows through us I just say
[1:40:54] Lord you know my responsibility as an
[1:40:57] extension cord my responsibility is not
[1:41:00] to produce electricity that's not it my
[1:41:04] responsibility your responsibility God
[1:41:06] never asked me Samuel heal somebody I
[1:41:08] can't no he never asked you and me hey
[1:41:11] Save Somebody I can't no but he said
[1:41:15] just be the extension cord that may be
[1:41:19] they're far out there but just be
[1:41:21] plugged into me so when it when when it
[1:41:23] would just get near just get near them
[1:41:25] and there's a point of contact there's
[1:41:27] virtue that's present there's strength
[1:41:29] that's available that they can draw from
[1:41:33] they can draw from maybe it's a dark
[1:41:34] storm and lights and everything else has
[1:41:37] gone out all around electricity's down
[1:41:39] like it was what was it some months ago
[1:41:41] and uh back in August when all that I
[1:41:43] was here that day and man trees and
[1:41:45] everything else coming down and man it
[1:41:47] was so dark and my how many people
[1:41:49] electricity um sister Judith y y'all's
[1:41:51] electricity was out for a long time time
[1:41:53] over there right there in Cleveland they
[1:41:55] were out and you know there's a lot of
[1:41:57] things let me tell you something we're
[1:41:58] living in a time of gross Darkness we're
[1:42:01] living in a time of
[1:42:04] Darkness but there's light in your
[1:42:08] dwelling there's light in
[1:42:10] Goan there's light in your life well me
[1:42:15] say it it don't it you know how in the
[1:42:17] world can this light handle the darkness
[1:42:19] no you misunderstand this place right in
[1:42:21] here could be ever so dark but if I
[1:42:23] strike one of them little matches out of
[1:42:25] a matchbook that light itself just that
[1:42:28] little tip will push back Darkness
[1:42:31] that's around it it don't have to be
[1:42:34] some great big light it just has to be a
[1:42:37] light and that's all God has called you
[1:42:40] and I to be I just want to be a light ye
[1:42:43] are lights just to what what what are we
[1:42:45] to show is to show that Jesus Christ is
[1:42:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:42:50] we're not displaying a new gospel the
[1:42:53] message is not a new movement but the
[1:42:55] message itself is a restored
[1:42:58] relationship with the living Fountain of
[1:43:01] the Living God the fountain is open in
[1:43:04] the House of
[1:43:06] David Hallelujah there is Deliverance
[1:43:09] there is pardoning Saving Grace that's
[1:43:12] what our lives are an example of so let
[1:43:15] me just say sure we're ashamed from our
[1:43:19] past but let me say don't despise from
[1:43:21] where God has brought you because
[1:43:22] through your life God himself is
[1:43:24] declaring a testimony that there was
[1:43:26] nothing and no hold no circumstance that
[1:43:29] was greater that the blood of Jesus
[1:43:31] Christ can't take care
[1:43:32] of I said I was finished and this ain't
[1:43:35] even my notes Hallelujah it just goes on
[1:43:37] display just like when sister Dalton
[1:43:39] wrote wrote to to brother brandham and
[1:43:41] talked about she was so tore up about
[1:43:43] her illegitimate birth and brother
[1:43:45] brandham pinned out the letter I've got
[1:43:46] a copy of the letter pinned it out to
[1:43:48] her and wrote it back to her and brother
[1:43:50] Ram preaches it in the message he said
[1:43:52] the reason he said where they couldn't
[1:43:53] enter into the congregation of the Lord
[1:43:56] until that fourth generation or whatever
[1:43:58] it was he said cuz there wasn't nothing
[1:44:00] strong enough at that time the blood of
[1:44:02] bulls and goats couldn't do it he said
[1:44:03] but that was until the blood of Jesus
[1:44:05] come when the blood of Jesus come it's
[1:44:08] strong enough to take care of it
[1:44:12] hallelujah it's strong enough that
[1:44:13] there's not a habit there's nothing that
[1:44:15] can hold you back from being exiled from
[1:44:18] God the blood of Jesus Christ will go to
[1:44:21] work as we confess our
[1:44:24] sins it dismantles
[1:44:28] holds Lord oh
[1:44:31] my I'm just ready to preach right
[1:44:34] now I tell you get to talking about the
[1:44:36] blood of Jesus Christ oh my brother and
[1:44:39] sister that's why I said sister dton
[1:44:42] don't you fear he said the new birth
[1:44:46] takes care of the first
[1:44:50] birth boo devil amen boo
[1:44:55] devil you see look look what the
[1:44:58] atmosphere that atmosphere of Faith
[1:45:00] being created right around our lives you
[1:45:01] know what it's doing it's putting us in
[1:45:04] that position to operate as a vessel for
[1:45:08] the Savior to work through praise
[1:45:11] because when you know where you're
[1:45:12] standing you can stand right there
[1:45:15] you're you're not a you're not a You're
