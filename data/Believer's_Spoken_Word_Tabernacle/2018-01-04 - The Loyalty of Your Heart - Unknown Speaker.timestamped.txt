[30:13] praise your father we give ourselves to
[30:16] you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[30:19] amen
[30:21] let's turn to Romans chapter 8 and verse
[30:23] 35 very the very familiar passage of
[30:30] Scripture but what a water reality that
[30:34] that it is to our lie
[30:39] verse 35 of Romans chapter 8 who shall
[30:45] separate us from the love of Christ
[30:50] shall tribulation or distress or
[30:55] persecution or famine or nakedness pearl
[31:00] or sword as it is written for thy sake
[31:05] we are killed all the day long we are
[31:07] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[31:12] in all these things we are more than
[31:15] conquerors through him that loved it for
[31:20] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[31:22] life nor Angels nor principalities nor
[31:26] powers nor things present nor things to
[31:29] come nor height nor depth nor any
[31:33] creature shall be able to separate us
[31:36] from the love of God which is in Christ
[31:39] Jesus
[31:42] may God bless you bless the reading of
[31:44] his word as you've been seated when we
[31:51] have been looking at this with tests and
[31:53] trials and I thought what was only going
[31:57] to be a service or two it just continued
[32:00] to open you might say better sent me
[32:02] that's how it always is you know there's
[32:06] a lot of things that you open and I have
[32:07] to push on back because he won't he says
[32:10] it's not time yet so it isn't always
[32:12] things the opens is what's time and
[32:15] what's its season and I believe that's
[32:16] what we have need of is what's in season
[32:18] I you know many times you can you go to
[32:21] a service and go to a meeting and
[32:23] sometimes you go to you know you go to
[32:24] meetings and man these meetings were
[32:26] like man they were the best meetings
[32:27] there's the reason why is because
[32:29] meetings themselves God gives a word for
[32:31] the season and the word and season it
[32:34] that's how it ministers to is we said
[32:36] mine is there's like none other god
[32:38] ministers to us in season what we have
[32:40] neato and I believe that not just for
[32:42] meetings would go to but I believe
[32:44] that's the way in when we come to the
[32:45] house of God they say my you know this
[32:47] the service on Thursday my goodness they
[32:49] tell you what it wouldn't lie
[32:51] last Thursday and that's true God
[32:53] ministering his word in season and
[32:55] that's what's so precious about the Lord
[32:57] so when we look at this here we
[33:00] understand with tests and trials that
[33:02] brother Branham he gives us such a such
[33:05] an understanding within these things
[33:07] that and I believe that understanding is
[33:10] is so so necessary when we're looking at
[33:13] tests and trials and how that we would
[33:15] come into it I want to just I want to
[33:17] just look beyond that right now just for
[33:19] sake of time and perhaps maybe later
[33:21] this evening or maybe the next next time
[33:25] well refer to some of those places but
[33:27] you know it's where God Himself he's
[33:30] found you found favor with God when God
[33:32] has allowed a test or a trial to come
[33:35] your way and God believes you'll stand
[33:37] the test God doesn't give you a test
[33:40] knowing that you're gonna fail that's
[33:43] not how that's not the way God works
[33:45] God does not glory in failure he doesn't
[33:51] you know sometimes when I look at things
[33:53] that you know some when we as teachers
[33:56] when they were dealing with us we had to
[33:59] take a class on where you actually had
[34:01] to test your tests see if your test is
[34:04] valid you look at the standard deviation
[34:06] all these are the things in these
[34:08] highfalutin terms you know but really
[34:10] what it is is that is your test testing
[34:12] what it should be testing and what your
[34:14] testing is it why are you testing what
[34:15] you've taught and are you testing what
[34:18] you've taught in an adequate manner for
[34:20] the student to be able to show multiple
[34:22] levels of understanding and those are
[34:25] things that even when we look at the
[34:27] understanding of a believer there are
[34:29] things that as you walk on with the Lord
[34:32] I walk home with the Lord
[34:34] our understanding becomes greater but
[34:37] not greater in a sense to where we
[34:39] become more our heads get bigger but
[34:42] it's where that God the knowledge of God
[34:45] being unfolded and the Holy Spirit
[34:47] revealing to us to where it ins more
[34:50] than just something that's mental but it
[34:52] leads to a place of submission in our
[34:54] life and a greater trust it just
[34:57] continues to develop within our lives
[34:59] and that's and that's something that
[35:01] with in our lives as believe
[35:03] that continues to grow and God never
[35:07] with anyway desires to see failure and
[35:11] that's why that even when you look at it
[35:13] the scripture said God is love and you
[35:15] think of first Corinthians 13 where it
[35:17] says that love does not rejoice in in
[35:21] wrong love does not rejoice in iniquity
[35:24] love doesn't rejoice in that love
[35:26] doesn't rejoice in you know and you know
[35:29] and something of in a manner as though
[35:31] that getting even or have this was going
[35:33] to happen or no no love itself does not
[35:35] rejoice in iniquity or in wrong so when
[35:39] we look at these things of how that God
[35:42] brings maturity in our life and I
[35:44] believe that's exactly what his presence
[35:46] by his word will bring in our lives
[35:48] brother Branham you know when he's
[35:50] dealing with these things and telling us
[35:52] concerning that how that when God is
[35:55] giving us a trial that shows he's got
[35:56] confidence in you you if you look at it
[35:59] when the trial comes and you and you
[36:00] think my I didn't have this level of
[36:03] confidence in myself but God wants you
[36:06] and me to see what he sees he doesn't
[36:12] want us just to see what we can see now
[36:14] and just to think but God wants it to
[36:18] become further known to us personally of
[36:22] the great riches that we have within us
[36:25] and God allows the tests and trials to
[36:28] come to make those things real to us not
[36:32] the tester trial but to make real the
[36:35] reality that he is already placed in our
[36:37] lives so where you and I can recognize
[36:40] even in the midst of the trial that
[36:42] there is something and one greater than
[36:44] me or I could not do this I could not
[36:48] stand this way but there's one within me
[36:50] giving me the strength to stand in this
[36:54] manner that's God making it real in the
[36:57] midst of the trial well to think of this
[37:01] here tonight and I want to just kind of
[37:04] look at this in a manner of how that God
[37:06] dealing with things really even in the
[37:09] beginning and then how God working and
[37:11] maturing and the maturing within our
[37:13] lives as believers because Paul
[37:16] would deal with as we took our text last
[37:18] week of where that and Paul would call
[37:22] him the light afflictions that that
[37:24] would come our way and he would let us
[37:26] know that these light afflictions in
[37:27] verse 17 a first second Corinthians for
[37:30] there but for a moment they work for us
[37:33] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[37:36] of glory and then in verse 18 while we
[37:40] look not at the things which are seen
[37:42] but at the things which are not seen for
[37:45] the things which are seen are temporal
[37:47] but the things which are not seen are
[37:50] eternal
[37:52] I believe there's levels within that as
[37:54] well within within verse verse 18 and I
[37:57] believe that the Holy Spirit teaches us
[37:59] and directs us within that and even our
[38:02] approach and how that we are looking at
[38:04] things and how that when we are we've
[38:07] come face to face with different things
[38:09] within our life that it's very much
[38:11] accustomed to where in our in the two
[38:14] realms the flesh and the spirit to look
[38:16] at things temporal very customed to do
[38:19] that but the inside man that has been
[38:22] fully regenerated it's that man that
[38:25] holds steady and it's that man that in
[38:28] the midst of the test in the midst of
[38:30] the trial remaining faithful and pulls
[38:33] all other things in line because Paul
[38:38] said it here the outward man perishes
[38:41] when we're going through a trial the
[38:44] outward man is not doing a jumping jacks
[38:47] and handstands and and everything else
[38:50] but the outward man is perishing the
[38:52] outward man is actually being brought in
[38:55] a place of dying but through that the
[38:59] inward man is being renewed the trial is
[39:03] not about glorifying the flesh the trial
[39:06] is to bring forth what God knows lays
[39:10] beneath the surface and the only way to
[39:12] bring that is it must show the frailty
[39:15] of the earth and vessel in which the
[39:17] excellency of the power is closed
[39:22] think about brother Branham brings this
[39:24] in three kinds of believer in this
[39:26] particular quotes what I'm gonna
[39:27] working with your tonight brother BAM
[39:30] goes into this here and he says
[39:32] sometimes believers put to the test
[39:35] and he says not sometimes every time for
[39:40] every Sun that cometh to God must be
[39:42] chastened tried and child trained every
[39:48] Sun this is where even when the Prophet
[39:52] is laying this this this this message
[39:55] out that through the midst of tests and
[39:58] trials in actually will bring on display
[40:01] even the believers that are there
[40:04] believers make believers unbelievers it
[40:08] brings it brings to display and God
[40:10] allows that to come because God doesn't
[40:13] withhold now what you think of this here
[40:15] God does not withhold his tests there
[40:18] are the tests or the trials because well
[40:21] this one's not a believer or this was
[40:23] not no God doesn't spare INRI holding
[40:25] back tests and trials but God permits it
[40:28] to come and remember the Scriptures if
[40:30] we endure chastening then he deal it
[40:35] with us with sons you see if if there we
[40:40] cannot stand the test then how can he
[40:43] place anything in that see that
[40:46] Scripture in Hebrews 12 not only
[40:47] pertains to us coming into the place of
[40:51] a full experience with God but it also
[40:53] that's that's portion of Scripture also
[40:56] deals with a maturing of a son and
[40:59] daughter of God coming clear into that
[41:02] adoption time that maturing it also
[41:04] deals with it if it's like brother Ram
[41:07] tells us in time tests and material when
[41:09] the man when they wanted to build that
[41:12] bridge there I believe it was in
[41:14] Australia they they had every kind of
[41:16] people that said there's no way you can
[41:19] do you can do it but there was a man who
[41:22] says I can do it and the man was not
[41:26] boasting he just said I can do it but
[41:29] what he was dealing with is that he went
[41:32] down to us to that of a rock and you
[41:35] hear familiar
[41:36] this he went down to Iraq and he fixed
[41:39] that so that the bridge would be
[41:41] supported on the rock but that alone now
[41:44] you've got a rock a place to which the
[41:46] bridge can be built on but that man had
[41:49] every single boat
[41:51] tested he had every beam tested he had
[41:57] to make sure that what he's putting in
[42:00] that bridge that it's got to be
[42:02] sufficient and equality and that's the
[42:05] way when God Himself will allow test
[42:07] he'll oust rest and trials to come away
[42:10] and was in all of that if we endure he
[42:13] deal it with us as sons and that's where
[42:16] the scripture said there's no one who's
[42:18] not as far as a partaker of chastisement
[42:22] or of chain of chastening no one is
[42:26] without that but if we receive that then
[42:30] it is a declaring that were not
[42:32] illegitimate but we are children of God
[42:36] that receiving it doesn't mean that we
[42:39] understand everything it doesn't mean
[42:44] that let's just look at this here for a
[42:46] moment
[42:47] because you see when we're looking at it
[42:52] think of how that the Scriptures and I'm
[42:55] just just going to take my time here
[42:56] with with just this portion of it every
[42:59] son that cometh to God must be chastened
[43:01] tried and trial child train that
[43:03] requires such such mindfulness
[43:09] faithfulness by God and long-suffering
[43:13] it requires that sometimes remain you
[43:17] know we we think about some are slower
[43:19] learner summer her or look at the same
[43:21] thing when we look at things how God
[43:23] will deal with things within our life
[43:25] and there's things God is working
[43:27] personally in our life in a spiritual
[43:30] manner and this chastening listen God's
[43:32] not interested in just always correction
[43:35] God's manner of correction is not always
[43:36] if we could say it like this putting
[43:38] something on you to drive you into a
[43:41] place but remember part of the
[43:43] chastening child training in all of
[43:45] is one who sets down and makes time to
[43:49] develop a full counsel everything that's
[43:54] involved because there's things that you
[43:56] know in your life let's just look at it
[43:58] in a natural there's things that you've
[44:00] come through in the natural that you're
[44:02] able to pass on to someone else there's
[44:04] certain things with those of you who
[44:05] have in college or you've been through
[44:07] college there's certain things that you
[44:09] know how to pass on to others who would
[44:11] be entering in there's little things
[44:12] that you can say that would comfort
[44:14] those who would be entering into that
[44:16] same thing with those of you within your
[44:18] job or whatever more of course you get
[44:22] next time I don't go into what I'm doing
[44:24] I'm doing you know what I go into what
[44:26] I'm doing
[44:27] no I don't wanna talk to you either that
[44:34] was free but you see everything that you
[44:38] know that that you have there's things
[44:40] that God even when when calling us to
[44:43] the different things it's very helpful
[44:45] and it's mindful and you don't want to
[44:47] look you don't want to paint all the
[44:49] bleakness and every all the hardness of
[44:51] and the my goodness this was gonna be a
[44:53] rough thing I tell you are you ready for
[44:55] it it's such a hard thing you know it
[44:57] you scared the people to death I'm gonna
[45:02] ask you this you could think of it like
[45:04] this and these things everything we're
[45:06] saying we need to be drawing it from the
[45:08] character of Christ not just what we're
[45:10] saying but in what we're doing
[45:13] God does not put fear into us even when
[45:19] God made known to things that was going
[45:21] to unfold in the ages yet his word that
[45:26] I friends I can't figure that out but I
[45:29] know what the prophets said and I
[45:30] believed that when brother Branham when
[45:32] he was ministering that the the the
[45:34] summer teenage brother brems says if he
[45:37] would have told the people in that age
[45:38] everything that was going to fully
[45:40] befall them which he did declare that
[45:43] but yet there's a part of it and even in
[45:46] what was declared that God was held and
[45:48] program said less fear should take them
[45:51] yet that was a word that was promised
[45:53] but see guano's God releases the
[45:57] necessary preparation
[45:59] for you and I to be able to face what is
[46:02] coming that's his word when the enemy
[46:04] comes in like a flood the Spirit of the
[46:06] Lord will raise a standard against it
[46:09] what good does it do to teach to tell
[46:12] you know like tell him Zachery about all
[46:14] these in here you gotta watch you know
[46:15] defensive driving and right he's not
[46:16] even close to driving you know what I
[46:20] mean why would I tell him that but
[46:23] there's things that I can tell him about
[46:24] things that he can relate to now that
[46:26] will carry on later on in his life the
[46:36] driving maybe he understands now is you
[46:38] know you you wrecked you get another
[46:39] life
[46:43] but the removal look at this there's a
[46:47] whole council there's not a removal but
[46:50] there's a guiding through these things
[46:51] and your brother branham makes this
[46:54] statement and this is what just so
[46:56] gripped my heart I haven't looked at
[46:57] this but I tell you just so gripped my
[46:59] heart brother Graham says remember the
[47:01] trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of
[47:04] persecution the loyalty but the loyalty
[47:08] of your heartbeats that material till
[47:12] she's ready to go into the mall that's
[47:15] what I want to deal with here tonight
[47:17] I've already been dealing with it but a
[47:18] few more moments the loyalty of your
[47:20] heart notice what he says the loyalty of
[47:24] your heart beats that material so the
[47:27] trial is more precious than gold because
[47:31] the trial what does it do the trial of
[47:33] your faith and that faith is that
[47:37] loyalty and that loyalty beats the
[47:40] material so the act remember character
[47:44] is molded by the character of life in
[47:47] you so write the character of life
[47:51] inside of a wheat is declared the germ
[47:54] itself brings forth all the
[47:56] characteristics of that wheat so the
[47:58] loyalty beats the material
[48:01] oh my I'd say there's just a way the
[48:07] things to be said like this this is
[48:09] understanding
[48:11] the loyalty of your heart beats that
[48:14] material till she's ready to go into the
[48:17] mold my God's children is made up
[48:22] correctly on his word for they are
[48:24] living examples and the Word of God
[48:26] living through them the trial he said it
[48:30] comes to shake you to put you to the
[48:32] very bottom to see where you'll stand
[48:34] they tested tried every son that come up
[48:38] to God and what you think of this here
[48:41] in the scriptures if I just can refer to
[48:44] it in in in the places they're in in
[48:48] Matthew and Luke and in the gospel
[48:51] they're where they will refer to the
[48:54] sowing of the word of God and remember
[48:58] how that the Lord Jesus he lays it out
[49:01] that there is four different grounds
[49:05] that are there the word it's the seed is
[49:08] the word of God but you have four
[49:11] different grounds you the wayside you
[49:13] have the rock you have those that have
[49:16] thorns and then you have the good ground
[49:20] that good ground is not something that a
[49:23] person has made themselves good ground
[49:28] it was already ordained to be good
[49:31] ground but it doesn't mean that that
[49:34] good ground did not have to go through
[49:37] the process of being called sanctified
[49:41] and filled it goes through that process
[49:44] declaring it was always the ground so
[49:48] you see all of this the good ground it
[49:51] had things that need to be cleared out
[49:53] of its life right you just couldn't
[49:56] plant something in it and things that
[49:57] have to be clear so I had to receive a
[49:59] call there are things that have to be
[50:00] cleared out of its life in order for the
[50:03] planting to go forth but it is ordained
[50:06] as good ground and this is the thing
[50:08] that wants you to look at in verse 15
[50:10] these are are they which in an honest
[50:14] and good heart having heard the word
[50:16] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[50:20] patience bring forth fruit with patience
[50:27] Wow so if I plant an apple see the
[50:32] understand listen the understanding of a
[50:36] little would be if you plant this Apple
[50:38] see daddy we're gonna have apple crisp
[50:40] next year I wish you understand they're
[50:47] not the little ones not questioning is
[50:50] the seed gonna come forth is it gonna
[50:52] come up but it's understanding years
[50:54] it's just time is it is it gonna come
[50:58] for that we're gonna have apples next
[50:59] year we're gonna have a bunch of apples
[51:00] we have apple pie and up no but you see
[51:04] the understanding listen to me now the
[51:06] understanding for us as children of God
[51:10] and you take four four four four four
[51:12] lives that are just born into the
[51:14] kingdom and I believe we all have to be
[51:16] reminded of it that that's the word
[51:19] itself that when God speaks a word and
[51:22] declares a word just because he spoke it
[51:25] does not mean it's happening that moment
[51:27] but when the word goes forth there is
[51:33] things set in motion they set in motion
[51:39] when the word has been spoken it's set
[51:41] in motion when the Prophet was here he
[51:44] spoke and declared the word that God had
[51:46] ordained for this generation he did not
[51:49] see that word come to pass but it set
[51:52] things in motion and we're seeing that
[51:55] word come to pass he could see it being
[51:58] fulfilled look at it where he could say
[51:59] that she you know and in the earlier
[52:02] parts of the message as she will be she
[52:04] will be she will be then he makes this
[52:06] they makes the declaration in rising the
[52:09] son she is him his preaching listen to
[52:12] me now he's preaching aware that when
[52:15] you look at it and you take the expanse
[52:17] of the age after the Prophet leaves the
[52:20] scene much was dealt and emphasized on
[52:22] God sent a prophet is that right but God
[52:26] that was
[52:27] necessary for that to be what to catch
[52:30] up to this
[52:32] so the Hammad the wild has already been
[52:35] spoken over this generation
[52:38] God is not taking back that one but that
[52:42] one has set things in motion and then
[52:46] when that word has come across your
[52:48] pathway my pathway it sets things in
[52:51] motion it's because of that word when it
[52:53] begins to deal with your life that's
[52:55] what causes you to separate from other
[52:59] things it's because the word begins to
[53:02] draw you and have precedence in your
[53:04] life that's why the Prophet could say
[53:07] Abraham separated from Locke because of
[53:09] the promise he was holding it's a very
[53:13] powerful statement in this message God's
[53:16] Word calls for total separation Jesus
[53:19] was separated from the world this is
[53:20] this separation was not about I want to
[53:22] be different I'm gonna be awed we're
[53:24] gonna be strange there was not what the
[53:26] separation was what brought the
[53:28] separation was not just a word that
[53:30] we're looking at but a word that was
[53:33] taking hold in their heart and they seen
[53:35] this cannot continue on a word that
[53:46] brings a separation what was it that
[53:48] separated Aaron and the Levites unto God
[53:51] word a word that declared of a sacrifice
[53:55] that had already went forth God said
[53:57] I've received all the rest of the
[53:59] sacrifice of Israel that I take Levi
[54:02] unto myself so what that points out this
[54:06] has already been done then I may freely
[54:08] bring you to myself and they laid in
[54:11] that word and it brought a separation so
[54:13] it doesn't mean because in the
[54:15] scriptures in Matthew 13
[54:17] these same scriptures when it's talking
[54:18] about the parable the sword it seeks of
[54:21] the good ground he that heareth and
[54:22] understanding understand that doesn't
[54:24] mean that we know all things it doesn't
[54:27] mean that we can explain all things it
[54:29] doesn't mean we can put all things
[54:31] together but that understanding that a
[54:34] word is spoken is the same understanding
[54:36] that the Prophet would speak in hearing
[54:38] and understanding he said a drunkard
[54:41] hear it and remain a drunkard a
[54:42] prostitute could hear it and remain a
[54:44] prostitute he said but him that
[54:46] understand it it means he that sees and
[54:49] is born again then he said their change
[54:53] forever that's a difference the word
[55:00] must be heard and brought to that place
[55:01] and drawn to that first notice I want
[55:04] you to look at this here in Luke 21
[55:08] verse 12 before all these things look
[55:14] what Jesus is speaking here to to the
[55:17] disciples and through the people they
[55:20] shall lay their hands on you and
[55:21] persecute you delivering you up to the
[55:24] synagogues and into prisons being
[55:26] brought before kings and rulers for my
[55:28] name's sake
[55:32] this isn't running them away the reality
[55:37] of this is not striking their hearts but
[55:40] you see like people that are falling in
[55:44] love and sometimes there's a time for
[55:47] everything
[55:47] let me huh there's a time for me you
[55:51] know I mean yeah we're living off love
[55:54] but there's a part of that yet that you
[55:56] want to live off love but love don't put
[55:58] groceries in the fridge is that Alright
[56:01] love don't put gas in your tank the
[56:07] truth though salmon that's just the way
[56:09] you think well what I'm trying to say is
[56:12] is that when love is striking hearts
[56:15] they don't see all the hardships when
[56:18] God is dealing with with your heart on
[56:20] the promise and of himself you don't see
[56:22] all the hardships you don't see all
[56:25] those things any that end that is not
[56:27] even all the focus of well this or that
[56:30] that's not even the focus notice what he
[56:36] says in verse 13 and it shall turn to
[56:39] you for a testimony it shall turn to you
[56:44] for a testament what shall all of this
[56:46] is gonna take place which I'll turn to
[56:48] you for a testimony I want you to think
[56:50] of this right here just in that
[56:52] scripture alone
[56:53] we could pull up writing of believers
[56:57] who have died before us and I will say
[57:02] it more correctly are asleep and are
[57:06] waiting on us once you think of this
[57:07] when we read these things in the
[57:09] scripture you read of different ones who
[57:11] have went on different ones and it
[57:13] wasn't just older young ones as well
[57:16] that stood there's some 17 years old
[57:18] some younger than that and they stood
[57:20] right there they were delivered up unto
[57:24] the rulers and magistrates and they
[57:26] stood faithful God allowed that
[57:32] testimony to be recorded and what stands
[57:36] out to us it's not everything else that
[57:39] they had done in their life but the
[57:42] testimony the stand that was made in
[57:45] that moment it was the it declare itself
[57:49] in that moment but I want to I want you
[57:50] to look at this if we don't even have to
[57:52] go back as though to have such a lens
[57:55] that would reach so far back remember
[57:57] it's even to recognize this of what God
[58:01] even around us with brothers and sisters
[58:04] of like precious faith friends I'm not
[58:06] just talking about looking around the
[58:08] church but yet also but I am saying
[58:10] looking at brothers and sisters that
[58:13] what you can see is is that through the
[58:15] test of time and you realize serving the
[58:19] Lord for any length of time it's not
[58:21] something that comes without hardship
[58:25] but its grace is sufficient and you can
[58:30] look at that and you can take
[58:31] encouragement from their lives I'll tell
[58:33] you I do I look at lives and veteran
[58:36] lives and you know we we still have
[58:38] right here in the assembly many that
[58:39] were of pillars when this work was
[58:41] getting started and I can look at not
[58:43] just at them but but others as well but
[58:45] I'm saying you know I look at that and I
[58:47] think of what brother Branham would talk
[58:49] about with brother and sister short I
[58:51] think about what brother Ram would say
[58:52] remember what he says he said Here I am
[58:54] he said I stand out there and look at
[58:55] them he said and I think Lord what am i
[58:57] complaining about you see one of the
[59:00] ones this wasn't about the brother and
[59:02] sister short had some great wealth of
[59:05] understanding
[59:06] but their love of God was in their heart
[59:08] the loyalty that was within their heart
[59:11] it brought such a respect that the
[59:15] Prophet he would call in in some places
[59:16] rugged Christianity gallant men and
[59:19] gallant men and women he would speak of
[59:22] these things you see this was important
[59:24] when he he takes the message the opening
[59:26] message a future home and he takes a
[59:29] great space within there and he speaks
[59:32] on character reports that he's received
[59:36] from the different restaurants and
[59:37] Warner for more he's received he's
[59:40] received reports of a life that's being
[59:43] lived outside that's why brother Branham
[59:50] was remember he was ever so quick when
[59:51] there were things that were anything
[59:53] that would bring a reproach on the
[59:55] Tabernacle in ministry so our brother
[59:57] Brian was so quick with on those things
[59:58] even remember when at a situation where
[1:00:00] a person had ran up a bill remember that
[1:00:02] and they ran up a garage bill and they
[1:00:03] just relented go they weren't paying for
[1:00:05] and brother ram tells us they sent down
[1:00:07] and said hey when they're gonna have
[1:00:09] that best thing looking bad on the
[1:00:10] church but the individual had done it
[1:00:11] and just you know went on their way but
[1:00:13] brother Branham he stood there with he
[1:00:15] stood within that now let me just make a
[1:00:17] little disclaimer I'm not advocating I'm
[1:00:19] gonna take care of people's bills but
[1:00:21] you know what I'm trying to get you to
[1:00:22] the place to understand so we'll be
[1:00:24] going to charge a bunch of stuff you
[1:00:27] know further savings gonna stay with the
[1:00:29] word I sure AM live within your harvest
[1:00:32] live within your means just a little
[1:00:38] disclaimer let my foot know we don't
[1:00:40] want that small riding we want a big
[1:00:41] riding but what I'm trying to look at
[1:00:44] here is the Lord would bring it to my
[1:00:45] heart is that we want our desire is in
[1:00:49] everything because you know what there
[1:00:51] are things that people see you and I
[1:00:53] under pressure they saw me under
[1:00:55] pressure and the job they see you under
[1:00:57] pressure and the job they see you and I
[1:00:59] you know that is that's real
[1:01:00] Christianity on display you'll turn for
[1:01:08] your testimony this is where you had
[1:01:11] that goes on to talk about I mean to
[1:01:13] think about this it's Bill here that how
[1:01:17] they would be betrayed some in verse
[1:01:19] steamed by parents another by kinfolk
[1:01:21] and friends and brethren and some of you
[1:01:24] shall be calls to put to death and you
[1:01:26] shall shall be hated of all men for my
[1:01:29] namesake
[1:01:30] notice for my name's sake you're gonna
[1:01:32] be heated but there shall not a hair of
[1:01:36] your head perish he just said therefore
[1:01:40] the same that some of them may even be
[1:01:42] put to death but the scripture is true
[1:01:44] not one of your head shall perish you
[1:01:47] might be put to death but you don't die
[1:01:53] amen the fear of death has been removed
[1:01:59] let me tell you something God prepares
[1:02:02] each and every one of his children look
[1:02:04] at this in verse 19 in your patience
[1:02:06] possessed of your soul that's what we're
[1:02:08] dealing with here this patience patience
[1:02:10] is that of a steadfastness a constancy
[1:02:13] in endurance and in the New Testament
[1:02:15] it's the characteristic of a man who is
[1:02:17] not swerved from his deliberate purpose
[1:02:20] and his loyalty to faith and piety by
[1:02:23] even the greatest trials and sufferings
[1:02:26] patiently in steadfastly waiting for
[1:02:28] patient and during sustaining
[1:02:31] perseverance now we need to give honor
[1:02:34] to whose honor honors do you think of it
[1:02:39] tonight when you can look in your heart
[1:02:41] and I can look in my heart and say Lord
[1:02:43] but the brain was talking about how that
[1:02:45] a person was singing Amazing Grace and
[1:02:48] brother brandman just finished preaching
[1:02:50] time-tested memorials and Brent says Oh
[1:02:52] God he said what a lovely song that was
[1:02:55] said to just go right along with the
[1:02:57] message he said and how that we as your
[1:02:59] people can reflect and think you know
[1:03:01] how that we've stood faithful and he
[1:03:04] said it's only been by your grace so we
[1:03:08] want to give glory and honor to whom
[1:03:10] honor and glory that this loyalty of
[1:03:14] heart is not something that we put in
[1:03:16] there but this loyalty of heart that is
[1:03:20] beating the material under the tests and
[1:03:23] trials this life this reality that has
[1:03:26] raised us up it all began because
[1:03:29] there was a lawyer one when there when
[1:03:33] man had completely forsaken and left his
[1:03:38] no way no in no way back at all but the
[1:03:41] lawyer one I will give thee a seat and
[1:03:47] he was loyal to his word and that
[1:03:50] loyalty produced itself in a body of
[1:03:54] flesh faithful to his word loyal and
[1:03:58] that royalty beat itself out in perfect
[1:04:02] obedience complete submission when
[1:04:05] everything was coming around this way he
[1:04:08] committed himself unto God who is
[1:04:10] faithful in all judgment
[1:04:12] there's things he could have think of it
[1:04:13] if Jesus would have taken the time to
[1:04:15] try to answer every single question and
[1:04:17] dispute everyone that disagree with him
[1:04:19] there would have been so much that would
[1:04:22] not have been been able to be said but
[1:04:24] it's not just being said there would
[1:04:26] been many people who would have been
[1:04:28] left in conditions he did not occupy
[1:04:32] himself with that but what was he
[1:04:35] occupied with the will of the Father he
[1:04:38] was tested to be pulled a certain way
[1:04:40] they remember when he they were trying
[1:04:42] to pull him to come down to the grave of
[1:04:44] life but one whom thou lovest trying to
[1:04:48] work there in his in innocent in his
[1:04:50] spirit there and trying to tamper with
[1:04:52] that affection gate you know the one you
[1:04:54] love but you see he shelled listen he
[1:04:57] was not showing something that you or I
[1:04:59] are not called to be but he was showing
[1:05:04] that if our devotion is to the will of
[1:05:07] God we receive strength to resist in
[1:05:11] this time see it isn't just about well
[1:05:14] I'm not gonna do this no no strength
[1:05:15] coming from the Lord David said he is my
[1:05:19] buckler that word Butler is my strength
[1:05:22] so it's not just a strength it's not
[1:05:25] just something we carry like a you know
[1:05:27] a belt pack or something behind us no
[1:05:29] we're looking to him that in the midst
[1:05:31] of this my strength to move through and
[1:05:33] resist and overcome coming from the Lord
[1:05:36] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:05:40] through him who loved us so this loyalty
[1:05:46] is because there was a one than loyal
[1:05:49] one and that loyalty that then come by
[1:05:53] that life now coming in to our lives
[1:05:56] calling us cleansing placing his life
[1:06:00] within us to wear that you and I can say
[1:06:02] hey it's Christ see all praise and
[1:06:08] adoration goes to him that the loyalty
[1:06:12] of art is because his life is dwelling
[1:06:16] within me you as me the fasces look at
[1:06:20] this these were guys reading the word
[1:06:23] but they were not loyal they were not
[1:06:26] loyal and doing this doing this doing
[1:06:28] this but what they failed to what they
[1:06:31] did not know brother man tells us they
[1:06:33] knew the history of the god of Moses but
[1:06:36] they did not know the god of Moses what
[1:06:39] is the god of Moses it's the living
[1:06:41] image its Christ they didn't know him
[1:06:44] they only knew a letter a letter is not
[1:06:48] a living image but a living image gives
[1:06:52] life and gives the depth the height the
[1:06:55] breadth of the Word of God that's why
[1:07:01] God when God would call us in this hour
[1:07:04] God did not even in this hour of how
[1:07:06] that God himself he came even when he
[1:07:08] became one of us he didn't send down
[1:07:10] well you need more laws you need a
[1:07:12] stricter code no he came to fulfill what
[1:07:16] was there by his own life on living
[1:07:20] image God sending his word he did not
[1:07:24] just say no word it's a living image of
[1:07:26] that word this is where that James could
[1:07:33] talk about the trying of your faith my
[1:07:35] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[1:07:37] into divers temptations knowing this
[1:07:41] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:07:45] patience but let patience have her
[1:07:50] perfect work
[1:07:52] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:07:55] wanting nothing look patients what
[1:08:01] patience but steadfastness that loyalty
[1:08:03] of faith let it have its perfect work
[1:08:07] the listen your life your testimony my
[1:08:10] testimony
[1:08:12] it's not made overnight it's not a
[1:08:16] microwaveable dish experiences in your
[1:08:21] life the things that you have went
[1:08:24] through listen to me now even things
[1:08:26] that you could not say well the Lord you
[1:08:29] know that I was suffering for the glory
[1:08:31] of God though sometimes there's
[1:08:32] decisions we've made that had nothing to
[1:08:34] do with the glory of God this is where
[1:08:36] the scripture comes true though all
[1:08:38] things work together for the good that's
[1:08:41] why it isn't saying well this one's to
[1:08:42] the glory of God let me rip this down
[1:08:43] and throw it away no mozart may have
[1:08:46] crumbled up many but all of those
[1:08:49] mistakes all of those things along the
[1:08:51] line all of those experiences went to
[1:08:53] make great masterpieces and the Prophet
[1:08:57] tells us everything that he you know
[1:08:59] like this masterpiece hallelu it's not
[1:09:06] was that not as not without learning
[1:09:07] we're learning you know it's none of its
[1:09:10] comfortable for us to go back and look
[1:09:11] at our failures it's not comfortable
[1:09:13] look at our mistakes nobody not one of
[1:09:15] us likes to do that but yet within it
[1:09:19] when we go back and say Lord tell me
[1:09:21] what whoa what was it within this here
[1:09:24] what where did I where did I fail within
[1:09:26] this work because we know that any
[1:09:28] failure its failure was here and it
[1:09:32] requires it requires the Lord to teach
[1:09:34] us and he will teach us and one thing
[1:09:36] about the God God doesn't turn around
[1:09:39] and put our nose in it that's not him
[1:09:42] he's chastening he's molding he's
[1:09:46] admonishing us in our lives so let
[1:09:49] patience have her perfect work oh my
[1:09:53] brother Brent tells us like this he says
[1:09:56] job went through trials and the tests
[1:10:01] his children taken everything else taken
[1:10:05] the church members come accused him of
[1:10:08] being a secret sinner and tried to say
[1:10:12] something against him but yet he
[1:10:14] wouldn't listen to any of it I want you
[1:10:20] to want you to look at this you know I
[1:10:22] say it's just so tempting just to go and
[1:10:25] just preach all the way on Java I love
[1:10:27] that study that we took some years ago
[1:10:30] with on that because you find that how
[1:10:31] joke
[1:10:32] he had his ups and downs job had the
[1:10:36] times that were joven said I wish it
[1:10:39] would been that there had never been an
[1:10:41] announcement that a man child is born
[1:10:43] you know our job was saying I wish I had
[1:10:46] never been born the testing and the
[1:10:50] trying the scripture said Joe declares
[1:10:53] it that even his wife's breath was
[1:10:54] strange to him I don't have to t I've
[1:10:57] taught that before but that's a pretty
[1:10:58] it goes pretty deep that you can
[1:11:00] understand it had affected everything
[1:11:02] around his marriage his family things
[1:11:05] was being affected by the tests and by
[1:11:07] the trial was going on you find that
[1:11:09] even in the scripture that when Joe said
[1:11:11] I know my Redeemer liveth as we looked
[1:11:13] in that years ago you look right after
[1:11:15] those verse in the scripture you find
[1:11:17] Joe coming right back down into another
[1:11:18] situation of loneliness yet you say well
[1:11:23] that was a path a part of the scripture
[1:11:25] that was a powerful revelation I agree
[1:11:27] just like when you and I are going
[1:11:29] through tests and trials everything that
[1:11:31] God drops our way is powerful it gives
[1:11:35] us strength along the way that
[1:11:38] revelation didn't bring Jove out but
[1:11:41] that revelation gave him strength
[1:11:43] you're not the outer man the outer man
[1:11:45] was perishing but it strengthened the
[1:11:48] inner man that's why James would say
[1:11:53] have you considered the patience of Job
[1:11:59] patience this that's what this patience
[1:12:01] is this loyalty of heart and to think of
[1:12:04] it in how that Joe when he looked
[1:12:07] brother and says like this he knowed I
[1:12:09] want you to catch these these these
[1:12:11] these thoughts here he knowed he had met
[1:12:17] God's requirements
[1:12:18] what you think of it God had revealed to
[1:12:21] Joe what was the acceptable way that was
[1:12:26] subtle he was standing right there on
[1:12:29] that I met God's requirements this is
[1:12:32] what God has revealed this is what God
[1:12:33] has spoken I mix I have met his
[1:12:36] requirements next part he no there's no
[1:12:42] need of Satan trying to tempt him trying
[1:12:44] to tempt him on what God's requirements
[1:12:48] you're not going to tamper with this
[1:12:51] revelation you're not going to tamper
[1:12:54] with is the message writer Israel you're
[1:12:56] not tampering with that look because the
[1:12:59] church has said it but it's Christ been
[1:13:01] revealed to me in a tampering with that
[1:13:04] look how many websites and blog posts
[1:13:07] and everything else it doesn't matter
[1:13:09] we're gonna say one of you can't
[1:13:11] understand everything let me tell you
[1:13:13] something friends there's a lot of
[1:13:15] things that can be laid out right here
[1:13:17] that I don't fully understand let me
[1:13:19] just give you an example while we're
[1:13:20] talking of it I can go through many
[1:13:22] different many different things but I
[1:13:24] hear it was I come out of here than one
[1:13:27] night and I just got done preaching and
[1:13:29] this is just one example that it comes
[1:13:30] to me right now I come out of here
[1:13:32] and-and-and-and brother Brown was and he
[1:13:34] made a statement he talks about Abraham
[1:13:36] and he said Abraham being the greatest
[1:13:38] man on the earth not to you that may not
[1:13:40] have been a big thing but I thought
[1:13:41] greatest men on the earth
[1:13:44] where's working lord help me and I
[1:13:47] wasn't doubting that no understand what
[1:13:49] I'm saying
[1:13:49] I'm talking about me understanding so
[1:13:53] when I'm looking at it and understand
[1:13:55] you know me I don't make every word thus
[1:13:56] saith the Lord the Prophet didn't do
[1:13:58] that he actually and chided those in
[1:14:02] Canada in the message key to the door he
[1:14:03] said remember I'm not infallible I
[1:14:07] didn't say that he said that I don't
[1:14:10] have no problem with that
[1:14:12] but the reality is is that within all of
[1:14:15] it how that God see God they're allowed
[1:14:17] God will allow things to come across our
[1:14:20] pathway that you look and you say wow
[1:14:22] but then right when eyes I'm leaving off
[1:14:25] the platform and walking back
[1:14:26] three years the Spirit of God just took
[1:14:28] a hold of that and you know I preached
[1:14:29] that service here the following Thursday
[1:14:31] sometimes it don't happen that quick you
[1:14:36] understand what I'm saying I'm saying
[1:14:38] that there are things that you don't
[1:14:40] always and I don't always there's
[1:14:42] nothing's that you can figure out and
[1:14:44] fully understand and neither are your
[1:14:48] efforts to try to pry into it and make
[1:14:51] it understand God reveals all things in
[1:14:56] his time he will reveal it when we have
[1:15:01] meat of it absolutely they're saying the
[1:15:06] understanding that that God has brought
[1:15:09] to to our hearts and lives so here
[1:15:11] notice this here and I that was just one
[1:15:14] quick example you say my brother sent me
[1:15:15] that just turned around within moments
[1:15:17] of time that's true but there's other
[1:15:18] things that I've said sometimes and it's
[1:15:21] things I had read in the scripture I
[1:15:22] didn't understand and here it was 10
[1:15:24] years later here's a brother standing
[1:15:26] here as speaking and his brother is the
[1:15:27] only time one time he'd been here he's
[1:15:28] been returned on the other side of the
[1:15:30] earth and he's standing right here
[1:15:31] ministering and all of a sudden that
[1:15:33] scripture opens what did you do with it
[1:15:36] I just put before the Lord because I'm
[1:15:39] not going to try to create understanding
[1:15:41] out of things God Himself brings
[1:15:45] understanding man gets a hold of it it
[1:15:51] turns into presuming and the things that
[1:15:54] man starts constructed you don't look
[1:15:56] like the image listen to me it might be
[1:16:00] things where they're taking things
[1:16:01] seemingly word-for-word that brother
[1:16:03] Bama said but you start looking at
[1:16:05] what's being tried to drive down and
[1:16:07] what kind of image is being produced you
[1:16:08] say mm-hmm
[1:16:11] that ain't holding true to the image of
[1:16:13] Christ that ain't home true so you see
[1:16:17] how that here he knowed he and met God's
[1:16:20] requirements he know there's no need of
[1:16:22] Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it
[1:16:26] was the devil
[1:16:29] he's closed in right on that on that
[1:16:35] does he he needs understanding and as
[1:16:41] long look at this
[1:16:42] as long as Satan can make him believe
[1:16:46] that his sickness was his God doing it
[1:16:49] he had Joubert he nolde he'd met God's
[1:16:55] requirement Satan couldn't tempt him on
[1:16:57] that the devil he couldn't get to that
[1:17:02] he knowed that was the devil so thing
[1:17:04] about the devil couldn't tempt him on it
[1:17:06] look at this quote he knowed it was the
[1:17:08] devil if the enemy was coming to tempt
[1:17:13] him and come against his sacrifice he'd
[1:17:15] say get out of here thing nice sacrifice
[1:17:20] is accepted and I am accepted sacrifice
[1:17:27] you mean acceptance is not so much about
[1:17:30] him understanding everything no neither
[1:17:33] is that you either as long as Satan can
[1:17:37] make him believe that his sickness was
[1:17:39] his God doing it he had job whipped and
[1:17:42] listen to me now safe and whipping joke
[1:17:45] right there on that and nothing to do
[1:17:50] with the loyalty of his heart but God is
[1:17:54] faithful to his word and him we are
[1:17:58] walking in his word then God will come
[1:18:01] and give understanding to us as we have
[1:18:04] need of it James said if any man lack of
[1:18:07] wisdom let him look up and ask God is
[1:18:10] that right
[1:18:11] but when job once struck that revelation
[1:18:14] that it was not God he was only going
[1:18:18] through his trials to make him something
[1:18:22] it wasn't God doing it it was Satan
[1:18:26] doing anti I know you know we said here
[1:18:30] Dan I think that's a me that's just not
[1:18:33] a great big thing but it is a great big
[1:18:35] thing it is because the same way that he
[1:18:37] came against Joe is the same way that he
[1:18:39] comes against you
[1:18:43] you say brother Samuel elaborate good
[1:18:46] like that
[1:18:49] when sickness and other things come your
[1:18:51] way you don't get the job promotion
[1:18:53] you're looking for sickness comes your
[1:18:55] way this doesn't happen or these things
[1:18:57] takes place what's the very first thing
[1:18:59] and listen as a believer we always want
[1:19:02] to examine our lives is that true
[1:19:06] we're taught that you examine your life
[1:19:08] first Lord is there any way that any
[1:19:10] place that I am I'm falling short if
[1:19:12] there's any way and truthfully listen in
[1:19:16] our lives we all desire to be closer to
[1:19:21] the Lord but you understand what I'm
[1:19:23] saying with sickness and other things
[1:19:26] would come the very first thing and this
[1:19:28] is where understanding comes and where
[1:19:30] it is needful you say why so that we're
[1:19:34] not walking around oh oh so terrible I'd
[1:19:40] if I only had faith if our faith doesn't
[1:19:43] mean that you're gonna be healed like
[1:19:45] that you know friends that I used to
[1:19:49] know an individual that you know their
[1:19:50] whole statement their phrase was my
[1:19:52] faith keeps sickness away from me I
[1:19:53] prayed for that individual I said God
[1:19:55] they're gonna face something one day but
[1:19:57] they're gonna need faith that comes in a
[1:19:59] different angle that carries them
[1:20:01] through sickness it might be true
[1:20:04] they're delivered of this and delivered
[1:20:05] of that deliver to this but that's not
[1:20:07] all there is to it because there is
[1:20:10] suffering he had left his church a
[1:20:14] measure of suffering right Paul said
[1:20:16] fill up behind me the suffering that is
[1:20:18] left so faith itself is not always about
[1:20:23] I don't have to go to a doctor I don't
[1:20:25] have to do it yes that's not that that
[1:20:27] leads in a way of pride and God will let
[1:20:31] you go maybe for years but then you're
[1:20:33] bringing right around but you know what
[1:20:35] I've watched also how God brought even
[1:20:37] and would bring that situation right
[1:20:38] around to where the individual has
[1:20:40] recognized it see grace grace I mean why
[1:20:48] would you why would you pray that way
[1:20:49] because friends we're talking about a
[1:20:51] balance in our walk and
[1:20:52] life that's what I'm preaching here
[1:20:54] tonight I'm dealing with these things as
[1:20:56] God is laying them with tests and trials
[1:20:58] it's a balance in our life and a balance
[1:21:01] is not compromised a balance is not
[1:21:03] powerless a balance is knowing where
[1:21:05] you're standing in full authority so in
[1:21:09] sickness and other things comes your way
[1:21:11] it's not you let me get back to this
[1:21:13] point it's not you or I walking around
[1:21:15] in a situation where we're all you know
[1:21:18] walking around beat down I'll tell you
[1:21:19] what I must have veiled God you know it
[1:21:21] must be something about it I as I've
[1:21:23] said over the years God doesn't hold
[1:21:26] things behind his back and saying guess
[1:21:28] where you're failing no again no God
[1:21:33] doesn't play sorry to use such
[1:21:36] vernacular as that but God don't play
[1:21:37] he's not playing games he's interested
[1:21:42] in molding and shaping and making you
[1:21:44] and I if there is anything in our life
[1:21:48] that is lacking when our heart is open
[1:21:50] God Himself will bring those things
[1:21:52] through our attention and it is remedy
[1:21:54] and we don't have to wait you see what
[1:21:58] this word the teaching of the word does
[1:22:00] it removes tradition that can come over
[1:22:04] come on somebody it removes tradition
[1:22:08] that can come over traditions that come
[1:22:11] over like they came to Joe and must have
[1:22:13] done something wrong Jovi must be bad
[1:22:14] must be something going on and then it
[1:22:16] can come on over to where it's like we
[1:22:18] have to do Pitons for years and days all
[1:22:21] of a sudden I get to a place I'll be
[1:22:22] better you with me it's got perching
[1:22:27] God's cleansing of these things within
[1:22:29] our lives he was only going through his
[1:22:33] trials to make him something
[1:22:35] it wasn't God doing it it was Satan
[1:22:37] doing it a quick check it's looking
[1:22:41] examing in our life and then within it
[1:22:44] within the midst of it recognizing that
[1:22:48] it's God that's overseeing our lives yet
[1:22:52] while Satan came to test him and try him
[1:22:54] on this I'm closing I really am
[1:22:58] Joe was still a believer
[1:23:02] he was still a believer this is a dis
[1:23:07] didn't make him not a believer you mean
[1:23:09] because he was thinking Claude was doing
[1:23:11] it he wanted to believe he was still a
[1:23:13] believer sure he was a believer he
[1:23:17] needed his mind renewed he needed a
[1:23:24] renewing like Titus speaks of renewing
[1:23:27] by the Holy Ghost not book-learning but
[1:23:30] renewing by the Holy Ghost and listen
[1:23:33] this this did not happen by all of a
[1:23:35] sudden just something just being dropped
[1:23:37] God king and visited job gone allowed
[1:23:41] all of those other men to say what they
[1:23:44] had to say and remain silent he said I
[1:23:48] thought ancient shall speak first
[1:23:52] everything's been said now her comes le
[1:23:56] sacrifice makes way for Joel to speak
[1:23:59] lip to hear and hear God after joke the
[1:24:05] Prophet says he stood flat-footed
[1:24:06] flat-footed doesn't mean he understood
[1:24:08] everything I know I keep coming to that
[1:24:10] it keeps coming forward flat-footed
[1:24:12] means he was standing or God had
[1:24:15] revealed imma tell your friends that's
[1:24:17] the reality Revelation holds you it's
[1:24:22] true there is an anchor that's why Jesus
[1:24:25] said upon this rock I will build my
[1:24:28] church this message is not learning hope
[1:24:35] I can say this freely I can this is my
[1:24:37] church I can save this this right here
[1:24:39] the message is not something where all
[1:24:41] of a sudden we'll get you to Calvary
[1:24:42] then we'll take you to the message you
[1:24:44] don't know where Calvary is act without
[1:24:46] the message of the hour I'm talking
[1:24:49] about a true atonement
[1:24:51] a true reality a true call how would
[1:24:57] Philip have taken them to Jesus how
[1:25:01] would he have taken unto Jesus if he
[1:25:02] didn't know Jesus I'm talking about a
[1:25:06] real Calvary not a Calvary where just
[1:25:08] you look at him say oh my yeah he felt
[1:25:10] sorry for me he loved me he'd that for
[1:25:12] me now I'm talking about the real
[1:25:14] ministry of Calvary let's speak someone
[1:25:17] who died that he might make a way that
[1:25:19] you and I might be brought into a union
[1:25:22] with Almighty God it's not higher
[1:25:27] learning the message is not theology
[1:25:30] it's not doctrine it's a life of Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ as Christ revealed to us Alleluia
[1:25:38] I shared this with some other brothers
[1:25:41] you know some of you heard for the bram
[1:25:43] time have you heard brother bisque will
[1:25:44] talk about this and well the fiscal mate
[1:25:46] he know he came out he made that he made
[1:25:48] the statement he was ministering few
[1:25:50] years back and he said questions he said
[1:25:53] you think I haven't had questions didn't
[1:25:56] think they're any things and I've read
[1:25:57] that I haven't had questions about he
[1:25:59] said one of the questions once he said
[1:26:01] is how in the world can somebody enter
[1:26:03] into life by just giving somebody else a
[1:26:05] cold drink of water this is brother
[1:26:09] Bissell's he's a how Lord he said and
[1:26:11] then once you catch this he said I
[1:26:12] carried that with me for years he said
[1:26:17] here I was getting ready to preach a
[1:26:18] meeting overseas and I got down to pray
[1:26:22] and that was not even my thought but he
[1:26:25] said the Holy Spirit came and gave the
[1:26:28] scripture he that receiveth a righteous
[1:26:30] man in the name of a righteous man who
[1:26:32] receive a righteous man's reward the
[1:26:35] Holy Spirit that's the answer right
[1:26:37] there why didn't God just give right in
[1:26:41] and give it right away because he
[1:26:43] doesn't want brats sorry to be so frank
[1:26:47] he doesn't want brat he's raising sons
[1:26:50] and daughters
[1:26:52] waiter he's over my understanding right
[1:26:54] away that's where faith and trust comes
[1:26:56] in that's where the revelation proves
[1:27:00] itself that's why all these things that
[1:27:05] have that got not permitted it all to
[1:27:07] come up even for the advancement of the
[1:27:08] internet and also things God allowed
[1:27:10] that to come the way it did why he could
[1:27:13] show this word is not the word of a man
[1:27:17] it could show that revelation cannot be
[1:27:21] seen God allowed that God will allow
[1:27:24] dual arms to be rubbed with different
[1:27:27] ones who turned around and left and hope
[1:27:29] those saying I'm not writing anybody
[1:27:31] away I'm not focusing on that what I'm
[1:27:33] showing is is that with all of that
[1:27:35] taking place it ought to declare of
[1:27:38] something that's a greater reality in
[1:27:40] you that you look at and say this I'm a
[1:27:43] part of this is a part of me what is it
[1:27:47] it's a love of God is not doctrine is
[1:27:51] the things that I can happen that I look
[1:27:53] because I can explain this and I can
[1:27:55] explain this and I can explain this why
[1:27:59] I told you I was closer than I am let's
[1:28:06] think so I don't keep going
[1:28:13] perhaps said the same thing today look
[1:28:16] at this same thing today he'll try to
[1:28:23] tell you these trials and things is your
[1:28:28] God trying to put punishment upon you it
[1:28:32] isn't so no sir
[1:28:38] even in God's discipline he disciplines
[1:28:44] with a vision
[1:28:50] any discipline is always with where
[1:28:53] everything lays even within the future
[1:28:57] those things I believe this is very
[1:29:02] important no we've met God's
[1:29:05] requirements know where we're standing
[1:29:09] that God would remove from us the line
[1:29:12] of thought the trials are bad remember
[1:29:15] as we said last week we're not praying
[1:29:17] lord give me trials that's not a
[1:29:20] training but it removes from months the
[1:29:24] line of thought the trials are bad it
[1:29:28] forms of punishment it removes that the
[1:29:32] real punishment and only true punishment
[1:29:35] to a believer it's when his presence we
[1:29:42] stand like Moses Moses said if your
[1:29:46] presence does not carry us up don't even
[1:29:49] carry us for how shall we be separated
[1:29:52] from all the rest of the nations of this
[1:29:54] earth not because that we have some some
[1:29:58] name as far as these were people were
[1:30:00] down in Egypt they were called out these
[1:30:02] are people of Israel is his presence his
[1:30:05] presence his name being revealed his
[1:30:09] life that's what separated them from the
[1:30:12] rest of the earth that's the same thing
[1:30:16] in our lives our lives were many times
[1:30:19] those things that we do not understand
[1:30:21] how this is going to work out this is
[1:30:23] going to happen everything that's going
[1:30:25] to take place all this
[1:30:31] it just like this right here we know
[1:30:33] things that are coming up on this earth
[1:30:35] is that right we know that we know there
[1:30:39] are things that's coming but God has not
[1:30:41] left look when the prophet has spoke
[1:30:43] concerning those things and what
[1:30:46] identified here in the word of those
[1:30:48] things that are coming up those things
[1:30:50] were not spoken in a manner for us to
[1:30:52] meditate on them and dwell on is that we
[1:30:55] might know
[1:30:57] but our trust is in the Lord
[1:31:03] said brother Simon what do you mean his
[1:31:05] look to him who he is and he gives
[1:31:09] strength right now and in that moment he
[1:31:12] will also give strength and BR strength
[1:31:19] I hope that makes sense to you sometimes
[1:31:22] you can get in your mind what am I going
[1:31:23] to do but they sent me to a
[1:31:25] concentration camp what do we do I know
[1:31:28] how you look the enemy can fire all
[1:31:31] these different things
[1:31:32] you can fire all this that's not even
[1:31:33] for us to be worried
[1:31:35] it's not a worry
[1:31:41] I'll tell you this right now
[1:31:45] the RAM says I see nothing left nothing
[1:31:48] left but the coming of the Lord if we're
[1:31:54] waiting
[1:31:55] and any be waiting on certain things
[1:31:57] well this is gonna happen this is gonna
[1:31:59] happen we say something in other nations
[1:32:02] they're already experiencing church
[1:32:04] doors have been closed
[1:32:06] they can't even meet right now in Russia
[1:32:09] they're not even allowed right now
[1:32:15] they're already experiencing these I
[1:32:19] tell you within our lives with
[1:32:24] everything it's Lord let me be ready
[1:32:26] every movement God will provide listen
[1:32:30] to me now in the men in the in the
[1:32:32] church age book program takes into a
[1:32:34] place Polycarp and all the different
[1:32:36] ones
[1:32:37] I believe friends with all my heart this
[1:32:38] is real leadership our lives the Prophet
[1:32:42] tells us God will give supreme grace for
[1:32:45] the supreme
[1:32:48] I think sometimes people have in their
[1:32:51] mind that we're gonna go through
[1:32:51] martyrdom and all these other things it
[1:32:54] can be difficult days but friends listen
[1:32:56] we are not we are not destined under an
[1:32:59] ox anointing we are destined under an
[1:33:02] eagle anointing rapture we're not
[1:33:06] running from anything there's been some
[1:33:08] of our brothers and sisters even now and
[1:33:10] even but the years they've had to give
[1:33:12] their lives but God calling us into
[1:33:21] rapture I believe the word listen
[1:33:24] loyalty in itself even when a person has
[1:33:30] met God face to face there's been a work
[1:33:33] that's done within your life there's a
[1:33:37] loyalty of heart that beats the
[1:33:41] materials
[1:33:43] but as time and has under the word how
[1:33:46] that God deals with our heart get
[1:33:48] matures and you find that patients
[1:33:54] that's strength growing
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:00] I remember there's things earlier in my
[1:34:02] life serving the Lord
[1:34:04] my dad would talk about certain things
[1:34:05] of testing I thought you got to be
[1:34:08] kidding me
[1:34:09] did you see what it is I wasn't at that
[1:34:12] place I did some tests and I had some
[1:34:16] trials some things that that a part of
[1:34:18] beginning but it was nowhere where one
[1:34:21] now there was a seasoned veteran was
[1:34:25] experiencing things but that's where us
[1:34:28] listen as being a seasoned veteran you
[1:34:31] want to be a representative and an
[1:34:33] example of what loyalty of heart
[1:34:43] Paul drew the attention to the to the
[1:34:46] Church of these things look I just don't
[1:34:47] use let's just bar ants
[1:34:56] oh Jesus you are so faithful
[1:35:06] you you Lord you you give to us Lord the
[1:35:09] understanding what we have need up when
[1:35:12] we needed I'm so thankful Lord and
[1:35:17] ourselves Lord that we don't have to pry
[1:35:22] I'd have to push the Lord you can look
[1:35:27] up to you
[1:35:30] what Jesus you are a strengthening
[1:35:35] father no standing here tonight and
[1:35:38] others more than streaming and will be
[1:35:40] Lord God not just those Lord that would
[1:35:44] be a part of this assembly because I
[1:35:45] know that there's so many more your
[1:35:47] bride around the world some that's gone
[1:35:49] on Lord father what testimonies what
[1:35:54] testimonies of that loyalty of find
[1:35:58] Nora say that will God looking Lord
[1:36:01] standing before me Lord lives will guard
[1:36:06] than you moulding she be your God that
[1:36:12] loyalty that beats in the heart no God
[1:36:16] that beats the material heart until it's
[1:36:21] ready to be put in the mold
[1:36:24] Lord we see tonight as we're looking
[1:36:26] more God in the word and we thank you
[1:36:29] too Lord because we know that God it is
[1:36:32] you that has placed that deposit in our
[1:36:36] lives and God as we stand there Lord
[1:36:42] the revelation Lord is so struck a heart
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:48] Lord we think your father and I pray God
[1:36:51] if there's one here tonight that that
[1:36:52] revelation Lord hasn't struck lord I
[1:36:55] pray that God that there would be that
[1:36:58] of Lord a humility of the heart that God
[1:37:01] where they can just lift the heart up
[1:37:03] before you tonight and say Lord
[1:37:05] drive it down Detroit oh god I want to
[1:37:12] know that Lord I want that reality Lord
[1:37:14] that that revelation striking Lord in my
[1:37:18] heart boy Oh God where it's not a
[1:37:22] lifestyle where it's not a teaching but
[1:37:28] it's your life
[1:37:30] a love affair
[1:37:37] Paul would speak Lord who shall separate
[1:37:39] us from the love of Christ
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:43] what we know that even in the days were
[1:37:46] Paul there was some Lord by the name of
[1:37:49] Jaime nice and philetus they took
[1:37:51] teachings of Paul but there's things in
[1:37:54] Lord God he wasn't he wasn't the thought
[1:37:56] the thought that Paul had preached in
[1:38:00] regarding resurrection they themselves
[1:38:03] Lord as Peter would say wrestled these
[1:38:06] things that they could not understand
[1:38:08] they wrestled it to their own
[1:38:09] destruction and when they begin to speak
[1:38:13] that the resurrection has already passed
[1:38:16] they began as your prophet could say
[1:38:18] take the word hear it and as karna men
[1:38:21] put a carnal interpretation to it father
[1:38:25] would see that God how that there were
[1:38:27] many many a faith that was overthrown
[1:38:33] but as you declared through Paul to
[1:38:37] Timothy at the foundation of the Lord
[1:38:40] standard as sure the Lord knoweth them
[1:38:43] that are his and he declared that in a
[1:38:47] house in a great house there are many
[1:38:49] many many many vessels Lord there were
[1:38:56] those who stood
[1:38:58] and even when that teaching would come
[1:39:00] there was a lot of loyalty of heart that
[1:39:03] beat and it held Lord in you Lord father
[1:39:08] it shows it shows Lord that teaching
[1:39:11] alone teaching is necessary but it's
[1:39:13] teaching by the Holy Spirit you coming
[1:39:16] and revealing your word but just Lord to
[1:39:20] have knowledge is not enough it will
[1:39:24] never hold it will allow Lord people to
[1:39:28] explain but when something comes that
[1:39:30] challenges that Lord God hold father has
[1:39:34] the scripture could say no I was shunned
[1:39:38] we are not ashamed Lord we know by the
[1:39:42] grace of God where we are standing Lord
[1:39:45] how we thank you Lord God for your mercy
[1:39:50] Lord I pray tonight
[1:39:53] may your grants strength Lord to every
[1:39:55] heart Lord some Lord God going through
[1:40:00] different tests going through different
[1:40:01] trials going through different things
[1:40:02] law father I pray that in the midst of
[1:40:06] it Lord not just for this this this
[1:40:08] moment of time but father may we grow
[1:40:10] may the Word of God Lord just just Lord
[1:40:13] elevating us helping us to see giving us
[1:40:19] understanding Lord you you didn't remove
[1:40:21] the test or the trial from Joel but
[1:40:23] through that test of trial you made
[1:40:25] yourself more real to Joel than you ever
[1:40:29] had out of that testing out of that
[1:40:34] trial it wasn't just Joe come came
[1:40:37] walking out of that test to trial but
[1:40:39] through out of that experience patience
[1:40:45] came forth and because then of patience
[1:40:52] there was hope that came forth
[1:40:57] we don't read Lord any more of jobs life
[1:41:02] the Father we know that God the example
[1:41:06] you included there was for us and we can
[1:41:09] see Lord your faithfulness more not just
[1:41:12] there but in our own lives so I pray God
[1:41:16] tonight then may we not look Lord upon
[1:41:21] the test of trials of one another and
[1:41:23] Lord meaning that we would make ours
[1:41:27] greater or even make ours littler but
[1:41:31] may we recognize that Lord the season
[1:41:33] and the test and trial is permitted by
[1:41:37] you and it has come Lord personally it's
[1:41:44] for us
[1:41:46] truly Lord our outward men in parishes
[1:41:48] but the inward man is renewed Lord we
