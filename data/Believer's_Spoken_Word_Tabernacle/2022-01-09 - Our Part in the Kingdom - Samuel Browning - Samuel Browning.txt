have searched he searched but i'm glad he was the one searching for us he's the one that put that longing within our hearts that desire for reality desire for the living god it's actually that desire is what really what found us the branham brings it on down he said it's that eternal germ that was in you that's what found you you think about it if you with your phone if you don't have a sim card or nothing on there how can anybody find you so it's the sim card that allows you to be found it's a seat of god on the inside it's god's never lost sight never in any way of you or i but he came looking for us amen he came in the fulfillment of his word in this hour to look for you and i amen you believe that it's true amen this word is the only word that could take effect upon our lives and bring out what god had placed within us and it's him we're in due season amen we're in the season in a time amen we just want to ask that the brothers would come we'll take up the offering at this time for the project second sunday of the month and i'm just going to also pray at the same time over the service and how the lord would just direct us as they're coming i want to remind you this coming thursday brother trevor edmond will be here it'll be the first time brother trevor has been with us for the trevor associate minister there with brother nathan bryant right there out of new alba new albany in jeffersonville just had great wonderful fellowship with the whole assembly as well as with brother trevor over the past few years and so he's been here in service with us one other time but he's coming this way and i asked him he just come and minister for us and so i believe that we'll we'll be blessed so let's just keep that in prayer too heavenly father lord jesus as we just lord come to this further part of the service lord we ask that you'll just continue just lord directing our hearts and our minds and lord we just want to as the word is coming forth just really enter in in our hearts with the real spirit of prayer you know our needs lord and we're asking that god that you'll speak lord directly to our hearts lord may you help me to step aside lord may you just come and do a great work lord in our hearts lord it's not something that is a great public show but it's an intimate working where you come down in a very personal way in every life lord to speak to our hearts personally and that's what we that's what we desire more because you're a personal god you come and you make yourself known personally you speak lord in an audience it wouldn't matter if it was an audience of 5 or 10 or five hundred you come and lord you speak so personally lord to every heart that's what lord we invite you this morning that's what we desire we pray that you'll come lord may you just pour out of your spirit lord for whatever the need might be lord may our hearts just be set oh god to receive lord what it is that you have for us may we just lay aside everything else from the cares of this life just enter in lord for these next few moments because in just a lord a few moments of time there are things that you will speak you will minister you will do and you will place into our hearts and our hands that are of eternal valley help us lord i pray we ask that lord as we take this offering lord for this project oh god that is to take place here lord with the entry way in those things oh god thank you lord even over the last week of how that the quotes and things lord we've got the responses back from different ones lord we ask that god that you'll just bless the worshipper now lord as they lord would give lord from their heart lord we lord we're not a rich people but lord we we just believe your god that lord that there is nothing that can be you can never be outdone lord lord you're the same god who takes and multiplies and directs lord and we believe that lord that you are jehovah jireh we have found that to be true not only for our soul but for every part of our life you are the lord who provides for himself and we ask that you'll direct us lord even as as the brothers would begin to look and pray over the different quotes and looking lord the different avenues o god we ask the lord for your direction in these things lord because knowing that there's things that you know and see that we cannot know and see but we have a confidence in your leadership we love you and thank you now father in jesus name amen amen god bless you as you give blessing let's sing that again there is no and no one else can touch my heart like you do for i can search for all eternity one more time [Music] and no one else can touch my heart like you do [Music] there is [Music] amen let's turn in our bibles to matthew chapter 9. so good to see each and every one of you and we still have different ones that are still recovering and we can't go up for his mercy and see different ones that's recovered and from different things that uh taking place in their body from covenant and flu from whatever it is i'm glad that the scripture still applies i'm the lord that healeth all thy disease when covett came along jesus never said uh-oh he never did that he said i got it covered i'm the lord that healeth all die diseases amen so i'm grateful for that and so we just want to look here into the word of the lord and just a part that just really inspired to my heart here as we look into these things in verse 35 four verses of scripture here jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among them among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest i want you to catch this in verse 37 this response in 37 is based on a need as the lord jesus is looking in the very depth and notice what he says they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd he's looking in a spiritual context there's a need for leadership and he's seeing it now he's already seen it designated it's sheep but they need a shepherd and notice how he follows this the harvest truly is plenteous the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of harvest that you may send for that he will send forth laborers into his harvest so god sees the need communicates the need and then he asked us pray about it pray about it this is the need this is what needs to be done i'm the one to do it but i won't do it without you praying amen i'd like to speak to you this morning the lord will help on our part in the kingdom may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated our part in the kingdom branham takes this in feast of the trumpets very opening statements yes the people let us bow our heads and he says lord on one occasion it was said by thy beloved disciples teach us to pray for when we catch sight of the great god of heaven we do realize how insufficient we are there's a lot that could be said with that statement when we can catch sight of the great god of heaven over and over as brother branham would speak to us in different places in the message and even giving us counsel in later times of the things that we are seeing the things that god is declaring the message that god has has brought to you and i that we might come to a living experience in jesus christ not a church experience but a living experience of the living god that reproduces the bible again in flesh and it's that's god's promise in this hour there would be a capping a culmination a finishing of the mystery of god which is the indwelling of the holy spirit in a life of a son and daughter of god many that could catch and see the great god they could see it and they would go off under impressions and other things but there's a great difference between an impression and inspiration because impression eventually wears off and we've seen that take place around the message impressions wear off after a while but there's a difference between impression and inspiration and when we can see the great god to really see it in in the light of what it is he says then we recognize our self insufficient now this is not meaning that we put ourselves down or i can't do this or i can't do that but we recognize that the god who is appearing and is making himself known that what god is doing by revealing himself to your eye it's god actually coming to let us know that i am the one who has come to do and to fulfill but i need you to serve in this part to recognize your weakness to recognize your insufficiency and to look to me in my sufficiency in order to bring past what i'm making known to you so he says so teach us to pray to teach us to pray lord in our hearts now for the things that would be beneficiary to thy kingdom and for thy servants you know the need of every person here so i would say it in this matter it's a when we look at this thought our part in the kingdom every one of us have a part and i we can speak of how that paul could write under inspiration in first corinthians 12 and speaks of how the same spirit that is divided and manifest with all there's ministering gifts there's nine spiritual gifts there's helps in the body all these things that are there but that's not what i'm focusing on here and that's not the inspiration of the channel of where i'm going this morning sure god has every one of those gifts but i'm looking at this in a manner that it comes down to each of our lives there's not one person sitting here this morning that i would go ahead and say and venture out that there's not one that would say oh i don't want to see any more of god in my life but on the contrary every one of us it is the desire within our lives to see more of god in our lives the desire is to see this word become manifest within our life that this word that god reveals to us remember there is a three-fold purpose to god and brother branham unfolds that to us god desires to make himself known and so god comes down and he makes himself known through flesh that's god revealing himself that's the first fold revelation is a necessity amen but it leads true revelation leads to the next phase which is preeminence it's to where the word then has oversight whatever god and please don't just limit it to the new birth though that is the foundation that is the necessity that's the ultimate but there must be a growing even from that part you see god did not bring about the new birth as though that we were just wandering out in the world and we're just walking around and you know just going about things and all of a sudden whammo it takes place no the spirit of god begins to deal with our hearts and he doesn't force us into anything he begins to draw on our hearts it might have been a billboard you read it might have been a pamphlet it might have been something that someone else said it might have been something in nature how god could speak through that but there had to be something that the spirit of god begins to get your attention he deals with your life but god will not repent for us the bible says we must repent but how can you repent if the goodness of god does not lead us into repentance god does his part to bring conviction we must do our part to repent is that right then the bible says that the blood it sanctifies but that is not something that it just we're standing and then god comes down and god just does it no it's us yielding ourselves our part is to welcome him and say lord my life all of these habits and everything that is standing between me and you i'm desiring these to be dissolved in my life if i've got to stay on my face day and night when i go to work i'm praying i want to be united with you that's doing our part god will not sanctify us just by us walking around and saying that's what needs to be done we first have to agree with the word but then our part is giving ourselves to the word that's been made known see we see how insufficient we are this is where it separates from just walking by a knowledge to walking then by divine revelation same thing when it comes to the baptism of the holy ghost only god can baptize only god can do that work is that right but he does it when a life is fully surrendered to him it's when that heart and you see it isn't always listen it isn't always together our mouth saying i surrender because sometimes the the whole part of the mouth can say surrender but god remember he's listening to our heart that's a powerful thing that's a great thing because sometimes we say things out of here but god looks down into the heart and god comes ministers to the heart sometimes we can say out of here oh i'm so insufficient i'm not able to do this i'm a failure but down on the inside as a believer a son and daughter of god that's what god comes to speak to because this natural man can't do nothing but it's the inside man that god comes to empower amen and when he shows up we recognize how insufficient we are but with that true recognition we submit ourselves to the living god that's right there before us and whatever he is asking of us and he's the one he comes and does the finishing work amen it's our part in the kingdom i read this i read this to you on thursday and this is where the thought originated from before we ever got into thursday's service just looking at some of these parts but i'm going to just read one quote and move from there in this thought our part in the kingdom i want you just to think of this in terms here's the lord jesus he's the capstone of the old testament what they were waiting on what the saints that were in paradise were waiting on he's the one that ezekiel saw the will in the middle of the wisdom he's the one that all of them the shadows spoke of him right there all of them all of the ages that was down spoke of his coming and it would come in fullness god would come in fullness and it had to come first in groom form notice who came in the garden it was not woman first it was man but the woman was already there but it took there a laying down in order for god to bring forth that hidden part that was in adam the whole time but adam had had to stand there in a fulfillment of god's word and that is the same way it it has been with that of the lord jesus to stand in the fulfillment of the word he fulfilled all of the parts that spoke of the bridegroom what he was supposed to do he finished it is that right as a matter of fact if when you look at the lord jesus he would even in speaking this in john the text that we read he speaks of it in this term i must finish the work that my father has given me to do now think of it god god could not could not do it without coming down in flesh you see the lord jesus here god coming down in flesh was now the example what they had heard about what even think of that that enoch hearing from his great-great-great-great-grandfather adam maybe in a coffee shop someday about how he walked with god now it's no longer just something you know enoch hasn't experienced but now thank all of those who are there they are witnessing one that has now manifesting what it was like inside of the garden of eden because adam was the first adam but the lord jesus is the second adam is that right then out of the second adam there comes a second eve there comes a bride that that is there and that bride will be and must be and let me just say is the manifestation of that second atom what is the second atom the quickening spirit amen is that right so within this the way that the bridegroom went about is the same way the bride will go about right just as the groom said i've not come to do my own will in other words coming here in this world and becoming occupied with things see that's a trap of satan to try to get us occupied with things out here that's a trap understand it's the trap right but you see the lord jesus when he came he's shown us what the reality let me say this the reality that the new birth brings in our life and the power that you and i have to be able to live in such a place of contact with god to where our desires and everything is culminated to see the work of god and the purpose of god not just for the in our in the economy but in our own lives in our own lives in our own lives our part our part in the kingdom think of this how brother brown made that thing help us to pray those things that would be beneficiary to thy kingdom well but simon i need things to be beneficiary for my family see ye first come on you can pull it with me and then all these other things notice before that he said your heavenly father knows what you have need of amen and there's things that god gives us sometimes that are even our wants they're not needs but they're wants can we get a witness on that so god unders god knows what's on that to don't let those things bypass you thank god as god knowing his care uh his his love and his care for our lives so think of it if we're focused upon that which is beneficiary to the kingdom then everything else within our lives everything will move right in place and in order as we're seeking amen to fulfill that part in the kingdom look at this with the lord jesus i referred i referred to this place on thursday evening we were talking about prayer and i just this is just stepping aside from that thursday service but yet i'm going to say it in this way it's very much much so focused around prayer okay i've got more to say on the thursdays but this is very much focused around prayer it came to pass in those days that speaking of the lord jesus he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god you read through the scriptures jesus was very intentional in his prayer and if the groom had to be intentional the bride has to be intentional there's things that we we have to be intentional within our prayer life so over and over you'll find where the lord jesus he would go aside to pray watch how brother branham places this in the healing of jairus daughter he's referring back to this scripture he said just in the previous chapter we find one place there where the son of god spent so much time in prayer and if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay somebody say stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him isn't that incredible you and i have experienced where there's a disconnect even in our own home but don't look at me strings you can eat at the same dinner table or whatever you just know you realize wait a minute we just it needs to be a more of a it needs to be a real connection that happens you understand this that's not evil it happens when you have to step away what do you do you step away and just have a connection focusing on one another right notice don't think of this that is where you and another person or me and my wife but think of this the spirit that was within him all right you know what it shows to me it shows i help i trust it shows to us that you and i can become disconnected when you're born of the spirit of god you can become disconnected from the influence of the holy spirit it doesn't mean you're going to go back out in the world because the riches have been burned if you've been born again there's no desire for the things of the world but who can get warm by a little fire right you have to feed the experience you have to feed stay notice stay in fellowship the groom in order to stay in fellowship to stay in harmony to stay in a channel to stay in a place of fellowship he had to stay in fellowship through much prayer with the spirit that was in him amen how much more he said do you and i have to spend in prayer and this is let's just be honest okay this is where satan battles us let's just be honest there's no there's no big eyes and little used there's no blue ribbons to be given out we're right here where the rubber meets the road said brother simon you're a pastor do you think satan doesn't didn't try to attack that brother about him over and over in the message influence voice of god in this last days on and on he speaks to us he says pastors don't you get yourself too busy that you can't get quiet before god to hear his voice i'm just going to speak very clearly that's why some things brother bram said a pastor acts low some things that seem like it's red light emergency ain't a red light emergency it can wait don't wait come on now all right that's why brother samuel i don't do a lot of fellowshipping out here all this and i don't because why i have a responsibility to receive from god and feed the flock and i can't feed you on my thoughts i can't feed upon things that even things that i can be looking at in the word i don't preach those things that are even coming to me at that moment wait for that inspiration and i believe that's what you want because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and to know that there is a word for this season for this moment in our life anybody can open the bible anybody can quote a quote but we want to hear from god this morning amen anybody can put together a message and man put things together but there needs to be inspiration from the throne of god to meet the challenge of the hour and how is he meeting the challenge he's inspiring you and me to stand up on his word and take our responsibility and our part in the kingdom that's grace for you and i aren't you glad for that grace how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only know what time and prayer meant i would just say it like this for all of us god help me to see that even more yes amen how about to see that even more what time in prayer amen much time and prayer now notice this sometimes when you're in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen i could probably highlight that sometimes sometimes we're praying in a certain direction and we're always in the will of god we're praying for healing we just don't know how healing is going to come right sometimes healing is on to the other side sometimes healing right when we stand on the other side it don't matter what they suffer with in this life it's gone when you stand on the other side right you've been delivered from this terrestrial into the celestial right and they're waiting on the glorified right sometimes healing comes by way of medicine right surgery sometimes healing comes miraculously the ego swoops down and picks us up all right right there's many different ways of how that healing can come and that's just healing that that even isn't included sometimes the things that we're praying about and we must always pray i believe in this manner that if it be thy will sometimes when you're in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen he said do you believe that there might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation now look at this statement here look at this statement well you say if god knows it's going to happen what would my prayer do now we're getting into the subject our part in the kingdom if god knows it's going to happen what good is my part in it you see this is this is a work of satan to try to take away from our part it's just like if a person says i'm predestinated i'll be there if you're predestinated you live like it that's right right god does not pull us through a pipe he did not pull us through a pipe and then say blessed is he that overcometh what did you overcome he pulled you through right right our part in the kingdom see all the way down through the scriptures we can fellowship abraham was predestinated oh no no no but look what their lives their lives are expresses out of a life that the revelation that came to them it took hold of their life and they were working to take hold of that revelation and bring it into fruition in their lives by the help of god is that right the bible said when it was revealed to know about the ark the impending judgment no one noah could not stand there and say ah come forth right right come on now there's a lot of things we'd like to say art come forth this come forward but sometimes there's things in our life that we can see and we see our shortcomings we can see the areas the cloud i need more of you and god brings you and i to a place of sincerity and desperation in prayer amen because anything that's given as a silver spoon you never appreciate it if god knows it's going to happen what what would my prayer do he said you remember when he was looking out upon the harvest he said the harvest is ripe laborers are few but pray ye the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest in other words here's the amplified in other words pray to me that i will send laborers into my harvest which i'm just telling you it's such a needy thing well if you know it needs to be done lord go ahead and do it no no you've got a part amen that's right i'm telling you what needs to be done now you pray amen hallelujah i want you to think of it in this way the bible is one book right but there's the old testament that's the bridegroom there is the new testament which is the bride that which came out of the old testament that which came out of adam that which came out of him at calvary and now is being made up what is the bride of jesus christ what has the believers been down through the ages those that have been born by his spirit with his word in that hour have taken that word lived by that word become that word expressed that word and went to make up that part of the body for upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it but we are partners in the building amen are you hearing me now peter said you add to your faith you had to you add to right you say well there must be the holy spirit that's true but we have to see the need for that to be added our part in the kingdom notice brother around the very next statement he says but part of it lays in human beings he said do you believe that do we believe that amen the kingdom of god lays within the human being now jesus said in one place i am the vine you're the branches the vine can't bear fruit the branches and the vine bears fruit god cannot bear fruit of his self it's got to take the church he says is that right it's got to take you branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth god wants your hands yes amen you want your eyes he wants your tongue you want your lips you want your ears want your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through amen i want you to think of this you've seen me give this example here dozens of times and i've done it in other meetings as it's come to me if i asked brother joy to put this coat on me and i stand here limp you know what i mean by lymph right good luck trying to get it on that's not yielding but yield it is i see the need for the joy could you help me put my coat on i see the need see now i see that need and i'm asking him to help me amen so he comes up and he said put your arm right in here brother sam okay i got it right in there then he comes around this way so here here here let me let me just i know where that sleeve holds that let me take a hold of this right over here and i'll put it in there for you thanks he can't do it without my cooperation the word can't come to pass in our life without our cooperation amen we must cooperate with the word of god john 15 1 let me go to the scripture that brother branham is referring to here and use for a basis here for the next few moments jesus has said i am the true vine and my father is the husband now notice the my father is the husband every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit so what so what is the um the deciding factor on whether a branch stays or whether a branch goes whether it's bearing fruit fruit in other words is it doing its part is it serving its purpose if it's serving its purpose now think of uh look here in verse two it's evident if a branch can be purged or removed it's not went all the way but there's necessary fruits for justification come on now there's necessary there's fruits for sanctification right and then it leads into the fruits that come forth from a life that is completely uh born in jesus christ see this is why it's been crucial in a person's life don't you don't look at one another right you let god deal with you individually and what god is dealing with your heart individually you respond to that word give yourself to it don't don't don't don't allow things to come up oh well you're not here or you're not there god doesn't do that within within a service like this or any other service there should be the effect of the word going forth that's not not doing the maturing for us but is speaking to us those things that we must need to give ourselves to that he might do it i want to go deeper i want to go deeper i want to go deeper now you are clean through the word which i have spoken so it's the word that brings cleansing right and no matter in our lives we know this this scripture it's the word that brings a cleansing in other words it's the word that comes to sanctify word that calls us into a place of cleansing this is why remember the holy spirit will never come into a dirty vessel people can receive anointings on their spirit and everything else but see it's the word that comes to cleanse that the word himself might come and dwell in i mean let's just face it there's places that you wouldn't go there's things that you you know hey listen listen listen uh you know when i was teaching school i had kids that would come around they want to give you cupcakes or water more i see what they did when they walked in my door no thank you don't even put it on my desk but i did it respectfully why i don't want that that's for me to do are you with me all right there's some things i understand brother behind me everything ought to be received and saint vacation and prayer that's right and i love it when i don't know about it especially in a restaurant or whatever more but when i know about it you see what i'm saying the holy spirit he will not come into a place that he has not made ready and prepared for himself but yet then even in our own lives daily service after service we know as we rub shoulders with the world hey brothers and sisters we can't live in a bubble we know that we can't go live in a cave right you know lock ourselves up in our houses and well i'm not going to have any contact with the world no we are in the world but we're not of the world there's things sometimes we hear that vex us things we see we didn't ask to see things we hear and we feel dirty and we're not the ones who did it all right but this is where we have an access to the washing of water by the word not only is the word come to you and i that it might bring forth to our life but that same word is preparing the pathway for himself to come so that you and i can stand there under the cleansing of the word and washing away all of those things that we might be able to stand there and ask for the things that he's asking us to ask for abide in me verse four and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself accepted to bear in the abide in the vine nor no more can ye accept ye abide in me verse 5 i am divine you are the branches no it's this is positioning now it's letting us know our part of the positioning he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing right the speaking of in verse five this is a full work a life that has been fully moved into a place with god him abiding the person in the worshipper abiding completely in god and god dwelling in them it burned that life brings forth fruit for without me you can do nothing but we have a part to play yes amen simon what are you saying i'm saying that it's very intentional in our life of how we must give ourselves to the things that god is speaking to very personally in our lives there's things that out of a service here you come out of one service there's things that the joshua you could be praying about god has spoke to your heart there's things that brother and you could be praying about brother dave and you all get together and say no no this is what i'm praying because god is personal he's working personally in our lives maybe it's on how we're facing a situation and maybe it's not about a situation we're in it's because remember now let me just say like this even the tested trials the situations that we go through are not separated from the word being made manifest in our life because sometimes with tests and trials and experiences god uses them to keep us humble to keep us out of pride and looking to him and god will mold the character in our life through those experiences and then there's other things in our life that we can look at and god we begin to see in our life and we put ourselves before the throne of god amen maybe there's certain things that you wish you was a little bit more patient and you can go before the throne of god and say lord i want more patience added and not i want more lord i want more lord i need more lord let me show live in a place lord that i'm not affected my spirit is not affected by the things that goes on around me because as i said we do not live isolated from that but we must walk in this world and god there is a part that we have here if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you can you read that verse of scripture with me if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen there's some parts in that and that's what i want to work with on just just a few moments herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples brother branham he picks up that same scripture that we've read looking upon the field seeing the need for laborers to go forth and the lord jesus speaking to the disciples i want you to pray that the lord of harvest he was the lord of harvest so he's telling them you need something to pray about this is what you pray about so you see reality is prayer is not something we're wondering what do i pray about god lets us know as he deals personally in our life the things that we're to be praying about i know there's a lot of needs there's a lot of needs and things that take place sometimes it seems like with the amount of needs and things that are all around but don't don't allow that to be the all right another word this is brother brown taking that same scripture we just referred to again of the harvest in other words you ask me to do just what i know that's got to be done but yet you got to ask me for it lord you just told me what i needed are you going to ask me but you know what needs to be done in my life lord let the transforming power lord what you spoke to me you know what needs to be done yeah but are you going to ask me all right are you going to do your part are you going to pray lord how am i going to work this in jesus spent much time in prayer see i would i would say this very clearly for each of our lives if we start and really evaluate and say lord is there some time that's gotten away that i need to buy back redeem the time if there's some things that i've allowed to encroach where i can redeem the time amen i'm speaking to all of us speaking to all of us said you have not asked you have out you have not because you ask not think of that principle here when the word's coming forth yes lord that's true and then we don't ask and then you get discouraged well i don't see it in my life have you done your part you see part of asking is obedience to the word that's part of the fear of the lord is to recognize and reverence him that speaking he knows what we have need of in our lives lord i don't feel like i'm growing have you been asking you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not that's a different part how the enemy wants to how things can be troubled in there because you believe not things that would like to try to hinder faith in prayer but i want to stay focused on this here this morning and i'm saying in this manner i'm going to read a few few statements here from the message how it's made so clear simple terms regarding john 15. and if you you recognize as a message believer that john 15 is a paramount scripture if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done it is the theme and the thrust of what should be present as the manifestation of the bride of jesus christ a life that is abiding in him and he in him and them and they are in tune with the supernatural and they are asking those things that he is speaking to them notice so it's the vine i want you just to catch this part it's the vine that energizes or inspires the branch to ask or how would we know what to ask for right probably every one of you have sat down in a restaurant or sometime i i really don't like going to restaurants that i don't know you know that's just me by the time you'll never try anything new i know i know but sometimes you go into a place and you know you have to ask them what's good here that's their opinion i mean i like that kind of fish i may not like this i may not like that right you understand what i'm saying you go and what you're getting is their opinion all right but god's not giving us his opinion he's giving to you and i'm speaking to you and i what he desires to see come forth in our life this is where even bible scholars will go back in the book of genesis and say that god is repeating himself he's not repeating himself god is declaring what is to be done and god is looking for you and i the part in creation is to respond for what he's what he's calling for by us saying be it unto me amen brother braham tells us in power transformation that the the earth itself became a water garden of eden because it obeyed the voice of god the voice of god is the word of god right it's the will of god it's the trans within it it's the transforming power of god the earth itself being an ice was a big conqueror of ice but it obeyed the voice of god the voice of god held transforming power within it but it didn't transform it right where it was at it was transforming power a power that if that earth could yield it could bring it into a place as more that it yielded it brought it into a place to its position that's the same with our lives we see the transforming power of god but our part is yielding to them seeking after that praying after those things and what is it it's god drawing us into that place of position but the brahman talks about he says you know if we fail he says to see the power that god has placed in his people god is in his people and he speaks of the scriptures of how god was with his people one time when he walked on earth but now god is in his people a little while the world sees me no more yet you'll see me for i personal proton will be with you and in you to the end of the world i want you just to these are familiar some of these are very familiar pastors this is not deep but it'll bring out the depth of god in our life all right god dwells moves works in mankind god doesn't work through orders he doesn't work through organizations you say what do you mean by organizations those that have their own mind and god can't move according to his word but they have their own thoughts about god remember that was the religious of that day crucified the lord jesus because of their own thoughts they couldn't accept the manifestation of god according to his word right so god doesn't work he can't work through organizations i would just say it like this lord i don't want to be a know-it-all i don't want to have it all figured out i want to be looking to you amen he works through individuals god works in man god doesn't do the work today that's a powerful statement god doesn't do the work today he energizes or projects his spirit into men to do so for he said i'm the vine the vine don't bear fruit ye are the branches that's a very important statement god doesn't do the work today he energizes or projects his spirit now let me just say this it is very important and you hear it preached across this pulpit you hear it through the message of the hour that it must be god to do the work amen is that right but listen the scriptures in the book of psalms except the lord build the house they that labor labor in vain but it didn't say don't do no labor but labor according to the inspiration that god is giving amen amen glory be to god it's laboring under the inspiration of him who holds the blueprint and he's able to release the inspiration for our part as a lively stone that's part of this temple see it's that same inspiration that sets the word in motion it's the same inspiration that ezekiel saw where when the when when the living creatures were lifted up the wheels were lifted up on the earth see the wheels on earth reflected the living creatures there's all the tank of the holy spirit working through the ages so whatever characteristic it was reflected through earth so the whales responded to that we're the wheels i said we're the wills hey the words walking in shoe leather we are the wills amen so it's the same way as a composer the director and the symphony all coming together right right not somebody in the symphony back there you know as a violinist i think the composer here the composer should have wrote this for this time he should have done this your violinist you've got your part but your part is is to heed to the director who's in the spirit of the composer when you heat to that then the compo the spirit of the composer moving through the director moves through you and it's all one great big symphony and what becomes out of the symphony is the same inspiration that hit the composer that then has revealed to the director and come out to uni it was a mouthful lord but you understand we're not living by bread alone amen the brandon will make this statement again he says he says he has jesus has no eyes tonight but mine and yours on earth he has no hands but mine and yours he has no voice but mine and yours and he is the spirit in us and we are the branches to bear fruit as he energizes us so i'm not working by my own energy god hasn't asked you and i have to when you energize yourself no no he says you're the branch but i will energize you i will project my spirit i'll let you know what you need to be praying about and give yourself to because as you give yourself what i'm actually declaring to you this is my desire that i want to see fulfill and express through your life back to me do you realize what the rapture is all about it's where the full desire has come into full fruition and now there's a bride standing on earth and the bridegroom is attracted to the word that he sees made flesh in the life of the bride hallelujah when attracted to the realm on the mountain with abraham the almighty god energized abraham i'm telling you you could have never read what you read in genesis 22 back in genesis 12. it was there but you couldn't read it there what happened energizing after energizing after energizing sure there were failures sure there were misunderstandings but abraham kept walking under the energizing of the holy spirit and eventually what god knew was in him the whole time became manifest in genesis 22. amen that's the same for you and me you hear me i said that's the same for you and me abraham had to do his part god said i need to show this type but i can't do it i need you all right let me just stay with as he energizes somebody say they're with me as he energizes you think of scriptures right now i can do all things through christ who strengtheneth me energized we're not talking about the bunny we're talking about eagles the battery power man wears out after a while we're talking about supernatural holy ghost power my notice he energizes i'm just going to refer to a few places in these quotes and move to wrap this up notice he energizes the the vines to bring forth fruit he pours his energy into us he energizes the vine with his life so that if the need and the purpose of the hours to bring apples if that's the kind of tree it is the energy that's coming forth from the vine they're apples right right and if the branch is ordained as an apple branch right well how do i know if i'm an apple branch get into the shekinah like aaron's rod did amen it manifests and declares what it was the whole time the shekinah did not make it an almond brass it was always an almond breath the shekinah only revealed here's a branch there's nothing there for just a dead dry stick but in the presence of almighty god in one 24-hour period hallelujah button blossom and bore almonds that's tremendous that's what god does by the new birth and then as we continue to grow and bear fruit sometimes we're still looking for that but it blossomed almonds in 24 hours right right well i know i'm speaking to some veterans sitting around here we're still lord i tell you i want that same kind of experience no that experience was necessary for you now to wait in patience and believe and stand on his word right sometimes you mean you have to wait for a season right you gotta i mean you you can't go out there right now and say man i like some good old apple pie right now i'd like to have some but you can't go out there and you can't just go out and say you know i'm gonna go up to miller's today and go out there and pick apples it's not apple picking time you got to wait for that season right and for that season what you and i are looking for like two apple crisp apple dumpling apple pie somebody's got to go and they've got to trim those trees they've got to fertilize those trees they've got to care for them and while you and i are oh look at these wonderful things in the spring all the blossoms around my house those trees are out there blooming right there's a work that's going forth in that season that's right it's a silent work but nothing nonetheless it is a work it's not necessarily a public show because it isn't happening all at once but it's god is changing me little by little right and if we're branches we are energized with jesus christ you know reproduce the life of jesus christ i'll just stop there if i keep i keep going here we'll i thought or would just be on this today and then but god comes and he energizes and how does he energize us by his word don't misunderstand me god does not energize us by music god does not energize us it doesn't matter if it's a slow song a flat song that does not energize by music god does not energize us by our feelings but god energizes us by his word amen jesus said it like this in john 15 7 if you abide in me and my words rhema now logos logo says the concept is the thought it holds the mandate scholars bible readers can tap into and look at logos oh that makes sense oh that looks good boy i really like that but rhema is is that a woman which the holy spirit can reveal and it's that word that revelation that word when god speaks so personally to you and to me that's god energizing us this is why in this hour the urgency was needed not for a student to compare verse to verse brother branham tells us that and we see it he said it's got to take more than that all right he said it'll take more than knowing the greek and the hebrew he said we don't need that that's what he said what we need in this hour see the call in this hour was for one from the throne to issue fourth divine inspiration revelation he says it will take an operation of the holy ghost and that's what has opened our eyes and the same god that's opened our eyes to make this alive and real not just oh the message is so good oh i just really enjoyed the doctrines i no no no because a person can enjoy the doctrines and still not be a partaker of the life are you with me they can they can agree with it oh i agree with that oh i see this i see that but see seeing it here is not seeing the kingdom there's times at first we have to look at it and things that but it takes god and operation of the holy ghost to unfold these things to us and make it real is that right it doesn't mean that we understand everything but it means we know in whom we have been amen we know it's god who's present we know it's a living god that leadership has come to the church of the living god for our lives and these are things that you and i are are being inspired by god see the word as we're coming to the house of god it's the word the revelation of the holy spirit speaking to our lives personally now let me just i told you i was stopping and i meant that just just to close it in this part here but when i would say this right here when we are even preparing to come to the house of god if we can see the value of not just in that moment but even throughout the week and at different times lord jesus guide the man of god amen and not only guiding him but lord let my heart be prepared because you know satan's always after distractions he's always out sunday morning thursday evening through the week he's out to try and the pressures and things are all around us but let me say this to you see the value of just slipping away to say lord there's things that i know i can see in my life but there's things that you see that i have need let me be so inclined to where when the word of god the rhema word the spirit of god coming down and energizing that inner place that it finds a place to dwell in my life you see that word now it goes with you and you're praying over it maybe god reveals to your life you need a deeper walk you need more of this need more of that you see in your life and to see it's not always about us praying just saying i see this neither i see this shortcoming we do we should pray about those things we see things within our own self we see i see certain flaws and i see this and i see i see this listen god doesn't come to cut them out of our flesh but living in his presence will give us grace to discern and manifest an overcoming life of those things if there wasn't anything to overcome then how could the manifestation of overcoming power manifest itself through you but there are things that we must overcome there's a part that we have to play and i'd say god may we come into these places and really the prayer as we're coming into your lord speak to my heart let me know as it were you looked upon the fields and said pray to the lord of harvest that he will send laborers in the vineyard lord help me to be so sensitive that i can see what it is you're drawing my attention to amen think of it the disciples could have been standing right there and they were they were standing right there and they're just wow man look at the field but see when jesus takes a hold of something he lets him know do you really see it it's kind of like a picture do you really see it see when they seen it he let him see there was a need and this is something i need you to pray about i'm going to do it that i need you to pray i need you to ask me to do it so whatever your need is ask him he said ask the father anything in my name and i might do it i feel like doing it for what i will do sometimes how i feel like i've been asking for a while knock and it shall be open to you ask if that has been inspired to you it's energized you it's energized you to go to prayer energize you to ask god see the holy spirit comes to energize a life seek for the holy ghost seek to be sanctified seek after these things it's our part in the kingdom you love him amen i'm gonna say lord i want to do my part i want to do my part let's pray lord jesus thank you lord for your mercy thank you lord for your great just very personal personal grace to our lives father throughout the expanse lord those that are gathered here those that are more streaming by way of internet those that lord would archive this later on i just pray and i ask o lord jesus the lord may we just lord seeing that necessary part lord that lays of the kingdom that lays in us that these things that you have you make known to us is that we might take these things lord and pray and pray with faith and faith it's a revelation faith is a settlement this is what god has said he's not asked me to bring this to pass but he asked me to pray and to seek after this lord i don't know what the needs are i know some needs lord but you come in such a personal way now i pray god may there be such a stir such an energizing of the holy spirit to the branch that maybe that branch has not even come to repentance may they be energized this morning lord to repent of their sins energize to be baptized in the name of jesus christ energize lord god or a sanctified life lord energized oh god to
