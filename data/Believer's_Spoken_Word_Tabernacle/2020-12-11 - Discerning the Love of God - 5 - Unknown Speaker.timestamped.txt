[23:42] word amen certainly just want to greet
[23:45] each and every one of you in the name of
[23:47] the Lord Jesus Christ and um we just say
[23:52] we're just so thankful for the mercy of
[23:54] the Lord once again this evening that
[23:57] we're able to be able uh to come
[24:01] together and gather around the word and
[24:04] knowing that God is he's mindful he's an
[24:07] omnipresent God and so we want to just
[24:12] look just for a moment a few things that
[24:14] I want to go over with with you as a
[24:16] congregation before we go into the
[24:18] service the ministering of the word and
[24:21] those things I'd like to go over with
[24:23] you are in regards to the resuming of
[24:27] the in-person service is here on Sunday
[24:29] I'm not going to labor this we sent out
[24:32] an email uh this past Monday as well as
[24:35] posting it there on Facebook for those
[24:37] of you who are connected with all of
[24:40] that uh the and so you've read that and
[24:43] I really don't have any other points to
[24:45] make other than what is on there and to
[24:48] reiterate some of those and that is that
[24:50] um with a mask itself The Mask will be
[24:54] worn uh at all times while we're in uh
[24:58] here uh in in the services and so forth
[25:02] um we uh want to also want in in looking
[25:07] at this is is what we've been I've we've
[25:09] been uh relying upon uh one another that
[25:14] if in in coming to Services if you if
[25:18] you have a fever you're not feeling
[25:20] well it there's no question whether you
[25:23] love the Lord or not just just stay at
[25:25] home and stream just just check it out
[25:27] to be sure what it is um so we need you
[25:31] that's why we've been the whole time
[25:33] that we've been working with these
[25:35] things we need you just to do that the
[25:37] other part is is that and just to make
[25:39] that other point very clear is if you've
[25:42] had contact with someone that's
[25:43] suspected in other words you've been
[25:45] around someone and they've been they're
[25:46] suspected because each and every day we
[25:49] can come in contact with different
[25:52] numbers of people or whatever more we're
[25:54] talking very specifically here if you
[25:56] have there're suspected that you've been
[25:58] in contact with someone and you you kind
[26:01] of know that whether it's been uh of
[26:03] something and you just to take inventory
[26:05] of that we need to be real stewards
[26:07] about these things and so uh to be
[26:10] mindful of that and and obviously if uh
[26:13] if you've tested positive for covid well
[26:16] um you know you know that you're not to
[26:19] come but we just we want to be proactive
[26:21] and I wrote on here a quote that
[26:24] actually is from Benjamin Franklin but
[26:26] it's true an ounce of prevention is
[26:27] worth a pound of cure uh and so we want
[26:30] to just just try to be very simple with
[26:33] that the other thing is I want to
[26:35] mention to you what we put in there is
[26:37] that we've done we've done a good job
[26:40] with the spacing and for and and
[26:41] thankfully here we've been able to to
[26:43] social distance and we tried to do all
[26:46] that we can in to be prudent to be wise
[26:49] with everything that we are doing and uh
[26:53] and I think for the most part we have
[26:55] done a very good job with that however
[26:58] coming back here and in this in this
[27:01] time on this is also going to be along
[27:05] with the mask until further notice in
[27:07] here and that is that the deacons will
[27:10] seat you they'll kind of look at where
[27:12] everything is at and they'll seat you
[27:14] because I know even even on the Thursday
[27:17] nights we've had we've had uh almost
[27:20] close to a Sunday crowd on the Thursday
[27:22] night so we we want to be careful with
[27:25] that that we're not just we talked about
[27:28] that the last time that we're not just
[27:29] sitting behind one another and sometimes
[27:31] that happens somebody sits down doesn't
[27:33] aware of somebody's at the restroom so
[27:36] the deacons will be overseeing that just
[27:38] please understand uh you may not uh be
[27:41] seated in your normal place and that's
[27:43] okay it's just an opportunity to show
[27:46] that you can serve God no matter where
[27:47] you set in church um so you know and
[27:51] you're you're you're like a fire might
[27:52] be needed in another Pew or another side
[27:54] of the building so uh we want to be
[27:57] understanding of that and the deacons
[27:58] I've really asked them to really be on
[28:00] that part of it to stay with that and
[28:03] they've done a good job here in the past
[28:05] so please understand that coupled with
[28:08] that um this is something that I want to
[28:11] mention to all of you as a congregation
[28:15] and that's on our arrival time um I want
[28:18] you just to think about coming to church
[28:20] like you would coming to work now some
[28:22] of you maybe you do clock in late at
[28:23] work I I don't know um but uh I want you
[28:27] to think of it in this terms the doors
[28:30] are locked and brother Richard has to
[28:31] get up each and every time and so I want
[28:34] you to think about this it's not about
[28:36] Brother Richard getting up each and
[28:37] every time but it's about the fact of
[28:40] more or less when we're coming to the
[28:42] house of God let's just think that
[28:44] getting here early and us coming in here
[28:46] and getting settled and praying it's not
[28:48] just about us it's about the whole body
[28:51] and so that in itself will also during
[28:55] this time um would make it just even
[28:59] even a lot better instead of you know
[29:01] having things coming in late and and we
[29:03] can just be very Frank and very honest
[29:05] with one another sometimes I understand
[29:07] circumstances come up but I think we can
[29:09] be honest sometimes it's just habits
[29:11] that we just need to break and get out
[29:14] of and and really be determined on this
[29:17] part and just to really to see the value
[29:19] of it so I want to encourage you uh
[29:22] within that part of it as well so that
[29:24] that'll help out so the email is there
[29:27] the Faceook Facebook uh post all that
[29:29] was done on Monday and if you have any
[29:32] if you have any questions if there's
[29:33] anything you've got a question about
[29:35] this is the same thing that has um
[29:38] whether you should come or not this is
[29:39] the same thing that's been throughout
[29:41] that I appreciate that when you call me
[29:44] I would as I said I would rather look at
[29:46] something and let's let's think it
[29:48] through than just just to assume we
[29:51] don't want to do that so let's we just
[29:54] want to move forward with that as well
[29:57] so so uh at this moment we want to just
[30:01] just turn our attention to the word of
[30:02] the Lord here tonight and um we just
[30:05] like to just invite you to the word of
[30:08] the Lord and maybe as we're preparing to
[30:10] turn there in 1 Corinthians 13 uh one uh
[30:15] let's just go to the Lord in a word of
[30:17] prayer tonight and just ask for his
[30:19] Direction and his Mercy as well uh Upon
[30:24] Us Heavenly Father Lord we are just so
[30:28] thankful dear God lord for the mercy and
[30:32] the grace of God lord Jesus we lord
[30:36] don't know what we would do without you

[30:40] you're are the guide of our life Lord
[30:42] through every circumstance of Life Lord
[30:45] and every little detail Lord we ask you
[30:49] for your help and your guidance Lord
[30:52] there's nothing that we take for granted
[30:54] I I know Lord in myself and I'm certain
[30:56] that Lord in the lives of others that
[30:58] even when it comes to Lord the tasks of
[31:01] life or things that we take on and are
[31:03] doing Lord around the house or whatever
[31:06] Lord we just ask you sometimes we run
[31:09] into things that we don't know Lord Lord
[31:11] how do I how do I approach this and Lord
[31:14] I'm so thankful that Lord we can come to
[31:16] you in everything Lord and just to know
[31:19] that God that you're mindful Lord of
[31:21] every need and we just pray tonight Lord
[31:24] that you'd minister to the hearts of
[31:27] each and every one of your children I
[31:29] pray that God that you would just help
[31:31] me to be able to step aside tonight that
[31:34] you can come Lord and that you can
[31:37] deliver the word oh God to our hearts
[31:40] Lord that you would just minister to our
[31:42] lives in such a very special way tonight
[31:45] Lord we just Lord commit ourselves into
[31:48] your hands now we want to say we love
[31:50] you and we appreciate you and we ask it
[31:53] now in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:56] amen in first Corinthians
[31:59] chapter
[32:01] 13 um we want to look here in First
[32:06] Corinthians
[32:07] 13:1 and I want to just come back into
[32:10] this this place of it and as we look at
[32:12] it here tonight Paul would write and
[32:16] this is counsel that is really that's
[32:19] given to the Corinthian Believers but it
[32:23] applies to all of us though I speak with
[32:26] the tongues of men and of angels and
[32:29] have not charity I am become as a
[32:32] sounding brass or a tingling symbol or I
[32:35] am become as a sounding brass or a
[32:36] tingling symbol and though I have the
[32:39] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[32:41] Mysteries and all knowledge though I
[32:44] have all Faith so that I could remove
[32:47] mountains and have not charity I am
[32:51] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[32:54] to feed the poor and though I give my
[32:57] body body to be burned and have not
[33:00] charity it profiteth me nothing so a lot
[33:05] of these things would be
[33:07] very very good things or we could say
[33:10] they could be things that would seem to
[33:12] be very helpful to that of others or to
[33:17] the body but Paul is is directing them
[33:21] that this is not what you are to rest
[33:24] upon they seen the supernatural taking
[33:26] place but Paul is letting them know that
[33:29] do not rely upon the supernatural taking
[33:32] place or or you being used of that but
[33:37] make sure the number one thing is that
[33:40] of Charity the love of God that you have
[33:44] been sealed by the Holy Ghost because
[33:47] that's the ground that's the source that
[33:50] all of this is the gifts and everything
[33:54] else is used for the body and it is
[33:57] those are Gifts of God's love so we want
[34:01] it to it is to be used by the love of
[34:04] God the next scripture I'd like to just
[34:07] read before we maybe would be seated or
[34:10] however you are there in 1 Corinthians
[34:12] 14:1 Paul says follow after charity and
[34:16] I think that's very key follow it's to
[34:19] pursue or to seek after eagerly follow
[34:24] after charity and desire spiritual gifts
[34:27] but rather that you may prophesy so may
[34:29] God bless you and bless the reading of
[34:31] the word as you're being
[34:32] seated when I look at when we look at
[34:35] this part here uh many of many of these
[34:39] things that we look at with the love of
[34:41] God these are things that Paul is
[34:44] dealing with of even how that a Believer
[34:48] is is admonished and encouraged in their
[34:51] walk with God this is real counsel and
[34:55] Leadership that's given to to the Church
[34:58] of the Living God and to see that when
[35:01] as we've been looking at this thought on
[35:03] Discerning the love of God and we know
[35:05] that we must have spiritual discernment
[35:09] these are things that we need the Holy
[35:12] Spirit to discern things out even in our
[35:15] life we need we we need to rest upon him
[35:19] and this is where when Paul would say
[35:21] follow after charity is that let let it
[35:24] be that it's the love of God that is
[35:26] leading us that's Direct ing us and we
[35:28] are following the love of God and I I
[35:31] look at this and I just just recognizing
[35:35] that within our lives as you and I we
[35:37] were to we were looking at last week
[35:39] when we look at this with charity and
[35:42] the love of God love can be is a term
[35:46] that can be thrown around or uh taken
[35:49] very lightly or spoken very lightly of
[35:52] and we recognize as we looked at it last
[35:54] week that in the scriptures where the
[35:57] the Lord Jesus I believe in John 21 was
[36:00] asking Peter lovest thou me and he's
[36:03] speaking in that term of agapo me that
[36:06] love that is from and is of god it's
[36:10] pure and Peter's response was I ailio
[36:13] Thee I love thee thou knowest I aelo
[36:15] Thee and we recognize that that that is
[36:19] the only measure that Peter at that time
[36:22] was able to love the Lord in with with
[36:27] that of the fial love but here God would
[36:30] would would impart to Peter and to each
[36:34] of them on the day of Pentecost and to
[36:37] disciples and Believers on down Through
[36:39] the Ages even as it comes down into our
[36:42] present time and into our lives that God
[36:45] would would release into our hearts the
[36:48] love of God this is this is what brings
[36:50] leads to a real transformation in a life
[36:53] because we realize that we are not drawn
[36:55] to God out of a out of a law but it is
[36:59] God drawing our hearts in a love affair
[37:02] that then there would come a uniting and
[37:05] as we kind of been looking at that on
[37:06] Sunday that there must be a death first
[37:09] of the old man and then there's a a
[37:11] uniting of with that seed with that life
[37:14] on the inside and so that is all it's
[37:17] all a work of the love of God and so
[37:20] when we look at this there there is when
[37:23] we approach into these scriptures as we
[37:26] Paul would begin to look and deal with
[37:29] this of Charity We There is a very
[37:32] important part to recognize that we as
[37:35] Believers have a resource and that
[37:39] resource is him and he is our life if we
[37:42] have been born again he is our life and
[37:45] this is why brother brandham would say
[37:47] it like this in the Hebrew series he
[37:49] says could you imagine before there even
[37:52] was an earth before there was a light
[37:54] before there was a star before there was
[37:57] anything there was a great Fountain
[38:00] going forth of spirit and out of this
[38:03] Spirit came the most pure of love
[38:06] because there was nothing for it to come
[38:08] from but love now we what we call Love
[38:12] Today is a perverted love but just as we
[38:15] get an essence or a little bit of that
[38:18] love in US it changes our whole opinion
[38:23] so if you notice brother said just in
[38:25] essence if just as we get a little bit
[38:28] of that it changes our whole opinion it
[38:32] begins to change our Outlook it begins
[38:34] to change our attitude begins to change
[38:36] you know the love of God even working in
[38:39] in a measure in our life it begins to
[38:41] change to where our heart will be moved
[38:44] in Repentance and then that same love
[38:46] working it'll it'll it'll move that life
[38:49] in order of sanctification where the
[38:51] mind is set in order for Holiness where
[38:54] the things they begin to looking at the
[38:57] things you know that's around them but
[38:59] then let the love of God it goes deeper
[39:02] to lead to a death and to a union and
[39:04] see it's all the love of God that's
[39:06] bringing about the change within our
[39:09] life it's the same love after we've been
[39:11] born again that actually is moving
[39:14] ministering correcting as well as
[39:17] bringing that maturity within our life
[39:20] brother B says now when these great
[39:21] lights went out or great rays of spirit
[39:25] love peace that's all there was was that
[39:28] there wasn't no suffering there was no
[39:30] hate nor No Malice it couldn't come from
[39:34] this fountain that was Jehovah that was
[39:39] Jehovah God now I want you to think
[39:42] about this it could not he is the
[39:45] Fountain and the source and from this
[39:48] great Fountain this great spirit God
[39:52] here comes forth the very pureness of
[39:55] Love itself out of that Fountain and to
[39:58] think of it that that how that for that
[40:02] part that out of him there could come no
[40:04] hatred No Malice it couldn't come from
[40:07] this Fountain let me just say it that
[40:10] when a person you have been born again
[40:13] of the spirit of God remember the holy
[40:16] spirit that is the love of the father it
[40:19] is the love of God and there is no
[40:22] hatred or malice can come from that
[40:25] Source within our Liv life but it's to
[40:29] let that source that love if there's a
[40:32] love that's going to govern we do not
[40:34] want FAL love governing Our Lives we
[40:37] want our lives to be governed by agape
[40:40] love even with felio love that would uh
[40:43] be among Brethren F your love that would
[40:46] be uh between a husband and wife between
[40:49] and that of a family but yet we want
[40:52] that under the governance of agape love
[40:55] this is why Paul could write right
[40:57] husbands agopa your wives even as Christ
[41:01] Agape the church so it's to recognize
[41:04] this is the kind of this is the kind of
[41:07] love and that love is not anything that
[41:10] we can attain to on our own s but there
[41:14] is a resource it is in God's hands and
[41:17] it is that which God deposits and he by
[41:21] the new birth then we have an access we
[41:24] have a resource we have a fountain and
[41:27] then the whole of our life is to be LIF
[41:30] the expression from that resource from
[41:33] that Fountain and so you know this is
[41:36] where with that with that Fountain I
[41:38] want you to keep that in mind this is
[41:40] our resource and we must continue this
[41:43] is our life is to be lived from that
[41:46] resource and so notice Jesus would say
[41:50] in John 13:34 a new commandment I give
[41:54] unto you that you love one another as I
[41:57] have loved you that ye also love one
[42:00] another by this shall all men know that
[42:04] you are my disciples if you have love
[42:09] one to another you see Agape Love is a
[42:12] love that
[42:14] creates it's a love it brings forth an
[42:17] atmosphere it brings forth a change it's
[42:20] real it's substantive it's that which
[42:23] others can see that these people really
[42:27] love one another and that's that was the
[42:29] testimony among the early church when
[42:32] they would would speak of them and they
[42:35] were first called Christians the things
[42:37] that were so moved by that of the
[42:40] Heathen and the Pagan that were around
[42:42] they looked at them and the testimony
[42:45] they had of their own lives is what love
[42:49] that is a that is among these
[42:52] individuals let me just tell you
[42:54] something that that is a work
[42:57] sovereignly of almighty God and it
[43:00] requires that our life is drawing from
[43:04] that resource from that Fountain of
[43:07] Life so Jesus goes on to say in John
[43:11] 15:12 this is my commandment that you
[43:14] love one another as I have loved you
[43:17] Greater Love have no man than this that
[43:20] a man would lay down his life for his
[43:23] friends notice love one another as I
[43:26] have loved you these things I command
[43:28] you that you love one another so there's
[43:31] only one way that that can be done the
[43:34] only way one way we can love one another
[43:36] in that manner as he did it has to be
[43:39] the same love of God in our hearts that
[43:43] was within
[43:45] him 1 John 4:7 beloved let us love one
[43:49] another for love is of God and everyone
[43:53] that loveth is born of God and knoweth
[43:56] God I want you to take notice of these
[43:58] scriptures here beloved let us love one
[44:02] another you see this is encouragement
[44:05] this is an this is admonition the gospel
[44:08] is not something that just goes on
[44:11] autopilot the gospel encourages us
[44:14] because when you have been born of the
[44:16] spirit of God you're still dwelling in
[44:19] this sticky house that's here and it's
[44:23] got to be admonished to bring everything
[44:26] else in subjection to the word and
[44:29] here's the admonition of the word
[44:31] beloved let us love one another for love
[44:34] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[44:37] born of God and knoweth God so notice
[44:40] how the scripture here goes on to say he
[44:43] that loveth not knoweth not God for God
[44:46] is love it's very clearly laid out here
[44:50] in verse 7 and verse 8 without the
[44:53] revelation of Jesus Christ which is the
[44:57] the new birth which is the baptism of
[45:00] the Holy Ghost which is the word
[45:02] experience without that reality in that
[45:06] life to where now the tenderness of the
[45:09] love of God has come into your heart and
[45:12] the love of the world is gone and your
[45:14] whole desire your whole life becomes him
[45:18] you love him nobody's making you serve
[45:20] him you serve him because you love him
[45:24] he's the one you desire to please and
[45:26] with that that aspect of it this is
[45:29] where it ties together because remember
[45:32] brother BR would say the Pharisees oh he
[45:35] says that you know they had love he says
[45:38] Christian Science they can outshine many
[45:40] people but the difference is that what
[45:43] the Pharisees have Christian Science
[45:45] that's not the love the agape love they
[45:48] can have love and you know expressing
[45:50] love but this love we're talking about
[45:53] is a love that works in harmony with God
[45:57] it is positioned in his word and it's a
[46:00] love for the body of Jesus Christ and a
[46:04] love for
[46:07] others 1 John 4:11 beloved if God so
[46:11] loved
[46:12] us we ought also to love one another no
[46:16] man hath seen God at any time if we love
[46:20] one another God dwelleth in us and his
[46:24] love is perfected in
[46:28] us this is one of the evident signs in a
[46:34] life hereby know we that we dwell in him
[46:38] and he in us because he ha given us his
[46:40] spirit so as we said before a person can
[46:42] say well I I just love everybody but
[46:45] they don't walk in step with the word
[46:47] they don't walk in step with the body
[46:49] then this isn't they don't have the love
[46:51] that we're talking about here the love
[46:53] we're talking about here is a love that
[46:55] comes from the word itself being
[46:59] revealed because it is God himself deity
[47:04] coming to Tabernacle the person of
[47:07] Christ coming to Tabernacle in his
[47:12] children it becomes a love for the word
[47:16] of
[47:17] God first
[47:20] Peter
[47:22] 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls
[47:27] in obeying the truth through the
[47:30] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[47:33] Brethren notice purified the souls
[47:36] there's been a leading to death by what
[47:40] obeying the truth you can't get anywhere
[47:42] without
[47:43] obedience obedience comes out of love so
[47:48] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[47:50] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[47:55] of the brethren see that notice this
[47:58] admonition see that ye love one another
[48:01] with a pure heart fervently in other
[48:03] words be let this be
[48:06] intentional let it be to the Forefront
[48:09] see that ensure that this is the part of
[48:12] your life don't become loose on
[48:16] this being born again not of corruptible
[48:18] seed but of Incorruptible by the word of
[48:21] God which liveth and abideth
[48:25] forever you see the
[48:27] same as as the revelation of the word of
[48:32] God because the word is active the word
[48:35] is a
[48:36] person as that word performed through
[48:40] Abraham's life Moses life Joseph life
[48:43] and I'm just I'm not just talking about
[48:45] in the signs and wonders I'm talking
[48:48] about in the times of
[48:51] adversity when things were that come
[48:54] against them things were said about
[48:57] them
[48:59] mistreated look how the word the
[49:03] resource that they were able to draw
[49:05] from the word gave them a living
[49:08] resource to be able to draw
[49:12] from this is where our
[49:15] resource 1 Timothy 1: 15 now the end of
[49:20] the Commandment is Charity out of a pure
[49:24] heart and of a good conscience ious
[49:27] conscience and of faith on faith notice
[49:31] charity out of this is the resource the
[49:34] fountain tapped in to that Fountain
[49:37] where is that Fountain here that life
[49:41] that spirit that portion of that belong
[49:44] to you here he is
[49:46] dwelling in that seed that life that he
[49:50] has raised up you have access you are
[49:53] tapped into a fountain that's why Jesus
[49:55] said he that believeth on me as the
[49:57] scripture said out of his belly shall be
[50:01] rivers of Living
[50:04] Water 2 John 1: 15 and now I beseech
[50:09] thee lady not as though I wrote a new
[50:12] commandment unto thee but that which we
[50:15] had from the beginning that we love one
[50:19] another and this is love that we walk
[50:24] after his commandment
[50:28] ments this is the Commandment that as ye
[50:30] have heard from the beginning you should
[50:32] walk in it you
[50:35] see it's impossible to love one another
[50:39] and not be walking in the word of
[50:41] God it's
[50:43] impossible and it's also impossible to
[50:46] be walking in the word and not love one
[50:50] another they go hand in hand because if
[50:53] you're walking in the word you're
[50:55] walking in Christ Jesus you're walking
[50:59] in the body of Jesus Christ This is why
[51:02] Paul said Discerning the Lord's
[51:04] body so then you have one motive and one
[51:08] objective and that's
[51:11] Christ and this is why brother Randon
[51:14] would say this and I I I just this just
[51:16] so so striking to my heart he talks
[51:19] about our attitude our objective our
[51:23] motive he said that's where the church
[51:26] is standing ing today if your objective
[51:29] and motives is right towards God the
[51:33] love of God will stream down like a
[51:38] fountain motives and objectives this is
[51:41] why brother randam would take take the
[51:44] time because it is all the way through
[51:46] the scripture we could go on and on but
[51:48] brother random would take us and he
[51:50] would talk about uh even when he was
[51:53] talking to brother Collins about knowing
[51:55] of Something's the will of God he says
[51:57] even if it is the will of God I want to
[52:00] test my motive and objective in it
[52:02] because if it is God's Will and yet my
[52:06] motive and objective is wrong it's the
[52:09] same as it not being God's Will and he
[52:13] would tell us in power of transformation
[52:15] among many places test that motive and
[52:18] objective this is where we need the
[52:20] discernment of the love of God we don't
[52:23] need feelings we need the discernment of
[52:26] the love of of God and I believe with
[52:28] all my heart that the discernment that
[52:31] God brings to our heart the discernment
[52:35] that we have need of and it's not just
[52:37] something that I'll say that's out here
[52:39] it's what's in here but it's us staying
[52:42] in contact and in fellowship with him in
[52:46] a real closeness of Fellowship that
[52:48] we'll know as the prophet said the least
[52:51] little thing that would disturb him he
[52:54] said I'll know it
[52:57] and flee from
[53:00] it now when we come into this and I want
[53:02] to just as we I say all of that from my
[53:06] heart before we come into this part of
[53:09] it in verse four of first 1 Corinthians
[53:12] 13
[53:14] because I don't know about you but every
[53:16] time when I read through these chapters
[53:19] and I read through in the book
[53:21] especially 1 and 2 third John and it's
[53:24] all through the New Testament Paul it's
[53:26] in so many different places where we
[53:28] speak of Charity and how charity is
[53:31] expressed and how how the life is
[53:33] conducted I don't know about you but
[53:35] every time when I'm reading and as I
[53:37] look through this right here I just
[53:39] always find myself saying oh God help me
[53:42] Lord to live a little bit deeper Lord
[53:44] not just a little bit but knowing that
[53:46] God that this is what I have need of you
[53:50] not saying that I haven't seen victory
[53:52] in my life no more than you could say
[53:54] but to recognize Lord and to this and
[53:57] this part of it it's something that
[53:59] grips within our lives because we
[54:02] realize these are things that are still
[54:05] where we drawing from that fountain in
[54:07] our life that many of these things that
[54:09] we read about are not things that
[54:12] require love in the so-called good times
[54:16] but this is where the love of God stands
[54:19] in the time of adversity and opposition
[54:23] and this is where that from that
[54:25] Fountain we can't draw from out here in
[54:28] that first realm we've got to draw from
[54:31] The Fountain and that's why we were
[54:33] looking at that in the opening tonight
[54:35] we've got to be in contact and drawing
[54:38] from the Fountain of God in order for
[54:40] this to be
[54:42] expressed 1 Corinthians 13:4 charity
[54:46] suffereth long and is
[54:49] kind charity envieth not vth not itself
[54:54] is not puffed up in the Amplified Bible
[54:58] if I can read that first part it says
[55:01] love endures long and is patient and
[55:08] kind love never is envious nor boils
[55:11] over with jealousy is not boastful or
[55:14] vain glorious does not display itself
[55:19] hotly I want to look at this first part
[55:22] charity suffereth long and is kind this
[55:27] this part of it is a
[55:30] description of where that this I
[55:33] believeth on my heart that the love of
[55:36] God in our heart it will move us in this
[55:39] way and I also believe that through the
[55:42] word as these are things that God deals
[55:45] with our hearts that it it should be
[55:49] that the word brings us to a place of
[55:52] Greater
[55:54] self-reflection in other words words
[55:56] we're not looking at everybody else but
[55:59] we recognize that this takes place that
[56:03] takes place but the first place that we
[56:06] look is right here because regardless of
[56:09] what that person does we have to ensure
[56:13] that our hearts and our lives stay in a
[56:16] place that's open before God and that
[56:20] there be nothing that is held against
[56:23] the
[56:24] person that takes that takes takes the
[56:27] love of
[56:29] God suffering this word here suffereth
[56:33] long this means to be of a long
[56:38] spirit means to be of a long
[56:41] Spirit In other words it's not quick on
[56:45] the
[56:46] draw it's of a long
[56:48] Spirit it means to be patient in bearing
[56:52] the offenses and injuries of
[56:57] others to be mild and slow to
[57:01] punish it's okay you can say Lord help
[57:07] me because of every
[57:10] Victory there's things that I can look
[57:12] at and see victories in my life but even
[57:15] with those victories and those parts
[57:17] that are there it still comes back into
[57:19] these things to where still having to
[57:23] deal with and pray and say God let there
[57:26] be nothing that resides here or gets
[57:30] hung up
[57:33] here that takes that takes the work of
[57:38] the Holy Spirit and what I mean by that
[57:40] is that doesn't mean that we sit back
[57:42] and just say God you got to do it no
[57:45] it's where we take the value of that and
[57:48] say God Purge it out of my life really
[57:51] get desperate before God because
[57:53] remember this guy is not converted
[58:00] right 1 Thessalonians 5:14 what our Paul
[58:04] would direct this now we exhort you
[58:07] Brethren warn them that are unruly
[58:10] Comfort the feeble-minded support the
[58:13] weak be
[58:15] patient toward all
[58:19] men not just them who are of the
[58:21] household of
[58:22] faith but toward all
[58:25] men all
[58:29] men see that none render evil for evil
[58:34] unto any man but ever follow that which
[58:39] is good both among yourselves and to all
[58:43] men notice follow that which is good
[58:47] following after
[58:49] charity these are things that notice the
[58:51] spirit of God bringing out to the
[58:54] believer and is really drawing the
[58:57] attention down to this that these are
[58:59] things that if these things are left and
[59:02] it becomes careless then we find the
[59:05] supply in our life we wonder why isn't
[59:08] our life going on the way it is why do I
[59:11] have things going in my life the way
[59:13] that they are and we have to come back
[59:15] to the simple principle of how is our
[59:18] attitude how is our heart toward others
[59:21] how are we conducting ourselves and
[59:24] listen we even in the midst stuff we're
[59:27] these things we're talking about
[59:28] suffering long this isn't because
[59:30] somebody made you a beautiful birthday
[59:32] cake and oh I just got to suffer with it
[59:35] and you know eat it all this is not what
[59:37] this is this is where offences have
[59:42] come and to be of a long
[59:47] Spirit
[59:49] wow well once again the only way you and
[59:52] I can be of a long Spirit suffereth long
[59:55] we've got to be able to draw from the
[59:58] Fountain of him who is known as the
[1:00:02] longsuffering one the Lord 2 Peter 3:9
[1:00:06] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:00:09] promise as some men count slackness but
[1:00:12] is longsuffering to usw not willing that
[1:00:16] any should perish but that all should
[1:00:18] come to repentance notice he's
[1:00:21] longsuffering to us word so the
[1:00:25] longsuffering of God even as it was in
[1:00:27] the days of Noah think about it the
[1:00:29] longsuffering Peter is writing this here
[1:00:32] in this time that the longsuffering of
[1:00:34] God it was that which God himself his
[1:00:37] word had went out and God within the
[1:00:40] midst of it though you and I had gone
[1:00:42] astray but in our or the ordained time
[1:00:45] of God how God would draw us to himself
[1:00:48] but in the meantime it was the
[1:00:50] longsuffering of God that waited for you
[1:00:53] and I think about that the life that we
[1:00:55] live or maybe you can saywell I didn't
[1:00:57] go out and drink and I didn't go out and
[1:00:59] smoke and I didn't go out and do all
[1:01:01] this but maybe you just did something
[1:01:03] that was even as just as bad you sit in
[1:01:06] a church pew and you would not turn your
[1:01:08] life over to the Lord and yet God
[1:01:12] himself would be longsuffering to you he
[1:01:15] would keep on dealing with your life he
[1:01:17] would keep on ministering to your life
[1:01:19] he would even take care of you and me
[1:01:22] when we did not deserve to be taken care
[1:01:25] of when our lives were live directly in
[1:01:28] opposition to his word and his will and
[1:01:31] we would get up we would forsake and not
[1:01:34] actually surrender our hearts but yet
[1:01:36] what was it what was it that kept us
[1:01:39] from being removed it was the long
[1:01:42] suffering of the Lord and the last part
[1:01:44] of the scripture not willing that any
[1:01:46] should perish but that all should come
[1:01:49] to repentance notice the longsuffering
[1:01:52] of God think of it is not just that for
[1:01:55] the elect of God because the elect of
[1:01:58] God that is the will of God and the will
[1:02:01] of God cannot be defeated but this is
[1:02:03] dealing with God's willingness God does
[1:02:06] not want to see anybody miss it as a
[1:02:09] matter of fact he he will give
[1:02:11] opportunity after opportunity maybe it's
[1:02:14] your life in the place where you're
[1:02:16] working or among your family and that
[1:02:19] life that's being live and you're having
[1:02:20] to deal with this or having to deal with
[1:02:22] that but in your life it can actually be
[1:02:25] the expression of the longsuffering of
[1:02:28] almighty God or that soul that son that
[1:02:32] daughter that life maybe they're not
[1:02:34] even elect but maybe they're just to be
[1:02:36] part of those that are saved but your
[1:02:39] life and the longsuffering of God can
[1:02:41] let them know there is indeed a true and
[1:02:44] living
[1:02:45] god notice Proverbs 19:11 the
[1:02:50] discretion of a man deferreth his
[1:02:54] anger it's
[1:02:57] okay when offenses have
[1:03:00] come you don't feel like blowing sugar
[1:03:06] kisses oh brother the Samuel I'm full of
[1:03:09] the Holy Ghost well so am I but when
[1:03:11] offenses come they then have to be dealt
[1:03:16] with because there is a part about
[1:03:20] it that it that that part can so get
[1:03:24] stuck in our lives it can get stuck in
[1:03:29] our spirit it can get stuck in our mind
[1:03:33] you say how can that be you ever talked
[1:03:35] to somebody and they can recall an event
[1:03:37] from years ago and when they talk about
[1:03:40] it they have there is a part within it
[1:03:42] when they go to talk about it that it's
[1:03:44] almost like they're reliving it and you
[1:03:47] don't you do not catch any peace when
[1:03:49] they're telling it they're still telling
[1:03:51] it where there's an anger a resentment a
[1:03:55] bitterness why is that they've never
[1:03:57] dealt with that they've never allowed
[1:03:59] God to adequately deal with it but what
[1:04:02] a blessing it is that God could bring us
[1:04:04] to this attention to say that is to be
[1:04:06] dealt with and there is a way to deal
[1:04:10] with it the discretion of a man the
[1:04:12] wisdom of man deferreth his anger now
[1:04:14] notice I was speaking here the wisdom of
[1:04:16] man deferreth his anger and it is his
[1:04:18] glory to pass over a
[1:04:24] transgression there's no
[1:04:27] way there's no way that a person's going
[1:04:30] to just be able that to draw from
[1:04:32] strength if they really haven't been giv
[1:04:34] themselves to the Lord and walking in
[1:04:37] the word as they ought to be I'm talking
[1:04:39] about walking in fellowship with God and
[1:04:41] praying and so forth there's no way
[1:04:44] because you're feeding the wrong
[1:04:47] dog you with me notice the wisdom James
[1:04:51] 3:17 but the wisdom that is from that is
[1:04:54] from above is first pure Peaceable
[1:04:58] gentle easy to be entreated full of
[1:05:00] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[1:05:02] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[1:05:05] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:05:10] that make peace so when an offense has
[1:05:15] come now the choice is for Wisdom that
[1:05:20] defers anger this is where we need as
[1:05:23] Paul would say in the book of G ations
[1:05:26] in two different places if we live in
[1:05:28] the spirit let us also walk in the
[1:05:32] spirit that our lives are are are
[1:05:35] regulated by the spirit of God and those
[1:05:37] are things that friends the further as
[1:05:40] we go in the journey down the down the
[1:05:43] road the further the journey the more
[1:05:45] and more I realize more and more that
[1:05:48] this guy is my enemy I'll just be very
[1:05:50] honest with you the very first thing
[1:05:52] that I look for when something comes up
[1:05:54] or this AR Es are this this is right
[1:05:57] here the first guy that I look at
[1:05:58] because this guy right here I know that
[1:06:01] this guy there needs to be attended to
[1:06:03] this guy can very easily there could be
[1:06:06] things accumulated things brought about
[1:06:09] these are things that I have to look at
[1:06:10] you are the same way you have to look at
[1:06:13] him the same way you say brother Samuel
[1:06:14] what are you saying I'm saying where we
[1:06:16] come to a place in maturity but we're
[1:06:18] not looking at well why did so and so
[1:06:20] have to say this or why did so and so
[1:06:22] have to do that that is not the
[1:06:24] suffering long of
[1:06:26] Charity that's looking for who can I
[1:06:30] blame and make an excuse for my
[1:06:34] attitude notice the fruit of
[1:06:37] righteousness is sown in peace now every
[1:06:40] all throughout those you streaming the
[1:06:42] few of you that are here we've all
[1:06:44] planted things the word sewn here is not
[1:06:46] dealing with a plant like one of these
[1:06:48] up here even though they're fake it
[1:06:50] isn't like taking one of these and you
[1:06:51] know you transplant it outside and now
[1:06:54] you know it has a good start no this
[1:06:56] word sown it deals with that of a seed
[1:07:00] and when you sew a seed it's got to be
[1:07:03] the right kind of a ground that it's swn
[1:07:05] in we know that the word itself is is
[1:07:08] that even of a seed now many times when
[1:07:10] a seed is sewn you're looking at that
[1:07:13] seed and you wonder and say when is that
[1:07:15] seed going to come forth when is this
[1:07:17] going to be turned around maybe it's
[1:07:19] something that you know an offense that
[1:07:21] has occurred between you and someone
[1:07:23] else in the assembly maybe it's in your
[1:07:25] family maybe it's with someone on the
[1:07:26] job and you're looking at a situation
[1:07:29] you're praying about it and you're
[1:07:30] asking God Lord help me with this and
[1:07:33] we're looking at that but remember when
[1:07:35] the fruit of righteousness is sown in
[1:07:37] peace first of all it must be that you
[1:07:41] have tapped into the peace of God that's
[1:07:43] dwelling there in your life because
[1:07:46] there's got to be then seeds that seed
[1:07:49] which is sown in peace that will lead to
[1:07:52] peace now I want you to think of this
[1:07:54] it's got to be then a cultivating of
[1:07:57] that you said let me just say be very
[1:07:59] simple with this what does that mean
[1:08:01] that means that when you're sewing in
[1:08:02] peace it means that you're not walking
[1:08:04] around and ignoring those whose tread
[1:08:06] upon
[1:08:08] you oh if the internet could ring right
[1:08:10] now it means that you're not just
[1:08:13] shunning them that have actually done
[1:08:16] you wrong but in order to sow peace
[1:08:19] somebody has to swow peace not a peace
[1:08:22] that the world giveth but a peace that
[1:08:24] comes from God God from the peace of God
[1:08:28] that's in your heart brother Samuel that
[1:08:31] sounds impossible I will agree for the
[1:08:34] first man but not for the new man who's
[1:08:38] been born again it's not impossible we
[1:08:41] have a fountain to draw
[1:08:44] from this is why James would go on be
[1:08:48] patient therefore Brethren unto the
[1:08:50] coming of the Lord notice the husbandman
[1:08:53] waiteth for the precious fruit fruit of
[1:08:56] the earth and hath long patience for it
[1:09:00] until he receive the early and latter
[1:09:02] rain he has patience for his word that
[1:09:05] has been sown be ye also patient
[1:09:08] establish your hearts for the coming of
[1:09:11] the Lord draweth not notice be patient
[1:09:15] the coming of the Lord is upon us be
[1:09:17] patient be faithful enduring and giving
[1:09:20] of yourself notice the very next verse
[1:09:22] Grudge not a one against
[1:09:27] another
[1:09:28] Brethren lest you be condemned behold
[1:09:32] the judge standeth before the
[1:09:35] door so how are we to live our life well
[1:09:39] brother Samuel I didn't speak to this
[1:09:40] person for a
[1:09:42] week the Lord does not have to give you
[1:09:44] a week's notice that he's
[1:09:47] coming oh you know pipe send out you
[1:09:51] know a tweet Samuel get everything ready
[1:09:54] buddy I'm coming on Friday morning at
[1:09:57] 11:00 no we are to live ready at any
[1:10:02] moment we are living ready there would
[1:10:06] be nothing that would hinder now you
[1:10:08] think well brother Samuel what if he
[1:10:09] doesn't come he does come he comes every
[1:10:12] day he comes every service there is a
[1:10:15] coming of the Lord where God visits our
[1:10:17] hearts and that coming what is it doing
[1:10:20] preparing us for his physical
[1:10:24] return
[1:10:25] Colossians
[1:10:28] 1:7 notice how Paul would write of
[1:10:32] this this report that is brought to him
[1:10:36] from aapas a fellow servant faval
[1:10:39] minister of
[1:10:40] Christ he declared unto us your love in
[1:10:43] the
[1:10:47] spirit for this cause we
[1:10:50] also since the day we heard it did not
[1:10:53] cease to pray for you and to desire that
[1:10:57] you might be filled with the knowledge
[1:11:00] of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:11:03] understanding that you might walk worthy
[1:11:05] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[1:11:08] fruitful in every good work and
[1:11:10] increasing in the knowledge of God
[1:11:14] strengthened with all might according to
[1:11:17] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:11:21] longsuffering with joyfulness oh my my
[1:11:26] my my my it's one thing to suffer long
[1:11:30] but suffering long with
[1:11:34] joyfulness how can you have
[1:11:37] joyfulness what does Joy consist of what
[1:11:40] is Joy
[1:11:42] about the scripture as it speaks in the
[1:11:44] book of
[1:11:45] Nehemiah that's a Time the joy of the
[1:11:47] Lord is our strength it's dealing in the
[1:11:49] time of the Feast of Tabernacles which
[1:11:51] is a feast that looks back to the work
[1:11:54] that was done through the lamb that was
[1:11:56] offered up through the life Pentecost
[1:12:00] that had come forth so where does our
[1:12:02] joy lie in the midst of suffering long
[1:12:06] it is not in the Suffering The Joy is
[1:12:09] not in the offense like Oh Glory they
[1:12:12] they offended me I'm so happy you're a
[1:12:14] liar that is not what this Joy is
[1:12:17] talking about this Joy where do you draw
[1:12:20] Joy you know who you are you know who
[1:12:24] you belong to and you know you've got a
[1:12:27] fountain that you can tap into and draw
[1:12:30] and say Lord Jesus Lord I bring this
[1:12:34] before your throne Lord God help me Lord
[1:12:37] God help my brother help my sister help
[1:12:39] my boss Lord help my husband Lord help
[1:12:42] my wife Lord but most of all I'm the one
[1:12:45] who needs the most help in this
[1:12:54] situation
[1:12:59] me just take just a few more moments
[1:13:03] here
[1:13:05] charity suffereth long there's not one
[1:13:08] person that I'm talking
[1:13:10] to not
[1:13:12] one that hasn't
[1:13:15] suffered and won't
[1:13:19] suffer not one
[1:13:22] person but how
[1:13:26] how are we able to suffer how are we
[1:13:30] able to be of a long Spirit how are we
[1:13:33] able to be slow and to have that hold
[1:13:37] where it's it's not coming out because
[1:13:39] let's just be honest there's no doubt
[1:13:42] every one of
[1:13:44] us there's no doubt about it we've had
[1:13:47] to repent and say
[1:13:49] Lord should have been in prayer about
[1:13:51] this first over and over can't even get
[1:13:53] anywhere close to it tonight brother
[1:13:55] Brother Brad will let let us know very
[1:13:56] clearly he says if you're feeling this
[1:13:58] certain way don't you go talk to that
[1:14:00] person till you pray
[1:14:03] through prayer prayer has a way if we
[1:14:07] really get in prayer the right way
[1:14:09] prayer has a way of Us coming into a
[1:14:12] place to where it'll help us to see the
[1:14:16] other
[1:14:17] persons not their problem but it'll help
[1:14:20] us to see
[1:14:23] Lord no doubt there might be going
[1:14:25] through something Lord help them Lord
[1:14:28] Jesus see this is what this is what real
[1:14:32] prayer is real prayer is not complaining
[1:14:34] real prayer is not complaining about
[1:14:37] this is going on or this has happened or
[1:14:39] I've been wronged or I've been wrong and
[1:14:41] I look we've all been wrong that's not
[1:14:44] insensitive it's just counsel to help us
[1:14:48] to recognize in this place that to where
[1:14:51] than in our lives to see that there is a
[1:14:54] way
[1:14:56] to approach this and we have a source we
[1:14:58] have a
[1:15:00] fountain that we can we can go
[1:15:07] to let me just wrap let me just close
[1:15:10] out with this right here there's no way
[1:15:11] I can get into this another part of it
[1:15:13] but I want you to see this charity
[1:15:16] suffereth long
[1:15:18] and is
[1:15:22] kind Paul prayed that the people that
[1:15:25] the children of God would be
[1:15:26] strengthened with all might unto
[1:15:31] patience and
[1:15:33] longsuffering with
[1:15:35] joyfulness that God would give them the
[1:15:39] strength to stand like
[1:15:42] that and here the scripture said charity
[1:15:44] suffereth long and is
[1:15:48] kind
[1:15:50] so this is this is how the love of God
[1:15:54] it works
[1:15:55] works it's coupled with kindness
[1:15:58] suffering long is coupled with kindness
[1:16:02] it'd be one thing to suffer long but
[1:16:04] real suffering long doesn't mean that
[1:16:07] well you know you're just silent you're
[1:16:08] just off to yourself but it's come it's
[1:16:11] paired together the longsuffering is
[1:16:14] where it's not you're just being quiet
[1:16:16] and you're holding I'm holding this I'm
[1:16:18] holding this I'm just daring them to say
[1:16:20] something oh they just say something I'm
[1:16:22] just going to lay it out right here and
[1:16:24] you got your binders you know that the
[1:16:26] binders are this thick you've got them
[1:16:27] laid out you know you're ready to
[1:16:28] present your
[1:16:30] case that's not suffering long suffering
[1:16:34] long as of a long spirit it's not not
[1:16:38] saying that oh I'm going to pretend
[1:16:40] there was any wrong that pretending is
[1:16:42] not is not what we're talking about it's
[1:16:45] recognizing there's
[1:16:48] wrong there's
[1:16:51] offenses things may be sad or things
[1:16:53] done
[1:16:56] but the suffering of long is where as
[1:16:59] we're entering
[1:17:00] in to prayer with the Lord think about
[1:17:03] Moses let me let me just bring this
[1:17:05] together in the book here of
[1:17:08] Nehemiah with this
[1:17:10] part and we'll just stop with this here
[1:17:17] tonight there's much to say on this with
[1:17:19] kindness
[1:17:20] but in Nehemiah chapter 9:1 17
[1:17:27] speaks of Israel they refused to obey
[1:17:30] neither were mindful of thy Wonders that
[1:17:32] thou did among them but hardened their
[1:17:35] necks and in their Rebellion appointed a
[1:17:37] captain to return their bondage but thou
[1:17:40] art a god
[1:17:42] ready to
[1:17:44] Pardon if I can say this one thing I
[1:17:48] want to be a Son of God who's ready to
[1:17:52] pardon I want to be ready to leave I
[1:17:55] want to be ready to
[1:17:57] Pardon that doesn't mean it's going to
[1:17:59] be easy but a
[1:18:01] Readiness a
[1:18:03] Readiness a Readiness staying in a
[1:18:07] place gracious and merciful slow to
[1:18:11] anger of great kindness and forsook US
[1:18:13] them not goes on to say when they made a
[1:18:17] molten calf and they said this thy God
[1:18:19] that brought this is the god that
[1:18:20] brought thee up out of Egypt and had
[1:18:22] wrought provocations yet thou in thy
[1:18:25] manifold mercies forsook us them not in
[1:18:29] the
[1:18:30] wilderness the pillar of the cloud
[1:18:32] departed not from them by day to lead
[1:18:34] them in the in the way neither the
[1:18:36] pillar of Fire by night to show them
[1:18:38] light and the way wherein they should go
[1:18:40] thou gavest also thy good spirit to
[1:18:43] instruct them and withheld us not thy
[1:18:46] Mana from their mouth and gavest them
[1:18:48] water for their thirst did they deserve
[1:18:50] it
[1:18:53] no this isn't about what's
[1:18:57] deserved yay 40 years didst thou sustain
[1:19:02] them in the wilderness so that they
[1:19:05] lacked nothing their clothes waxed not
[1:19:08] old and their feet swelled not on the
[1:19:12] contrary they did
[1:19:16] everything listen to me now this
[1:19:20] scripture that we just
[1:19:22] read Nehemiah writes
[1:19:25] Lord this was
[1:19:29] you thou are a god ready to
[1:19:34] Pardon how were these scriptures made
[1:19:38] manifest God told Moses step aside I'm
[1:19:42] gonna kill them all
[1:19:43] right there's a part of the word
[1:19:47] injustice
[1:19:49] judgment but notice this Word of Promise
[1:19:54] dwelling in the heart of Moses at that
[1:19:58] moment how was these scriptures made
[1:20:00] manifest fulfilled it was Christ it was
[1:20:04] the Lord himself fulfilling his promise
[1:20:08] and he himself staying with his word
[1:20:11] even though for them he could he could
[1:20:14] have walked away from them they they
[1:20:17] hardened their necks as the scriptures
[1:20:19] said they did everything but the Bible
[1:20:22] said he was slow to anger and what I'm
[1:20:25] trying to say is this was manifest
[1:20:28] through a man who did not even have the
[1:20:31] new
[1:20:33] birth Moses wasn't even born again like
[1:20:36] you and I have had the privilege to be
[1:20:38] born again but he was in the presence of
[1:20:41] God and he came under the full effect
[1:20:44] that could be allotted in that time and
[1:20:47] where was he drawing from it was that of
[1:20:49] Christ that spoke out in that crucial
[1:20:52] moment in that crucial time let me just
[1:20:55] say this to you there are times in our
[1:20:57] life that where the spirit of God has so
[1:21:00] moved down upon our life and to help us
[1:21:03] in a crucial situation where we're aware
[1:21:06] he has taken over and you're aware he's
[1:21:09] got it in control I'm telling you what
[1:21:12] brother B talks about the maniac on the
[1:21:14] platform talking about the bull talking
[1:21:16] about the Beast I've witnessed that many
[1:21:18] times not just in that office back there
[1:21:20] counseling it I've witnessed it in the
[1:21:22] in over the phone I've witnessed it face
[1:21:24] to face I've witnessed this many times
[1:21:27] in many situations but then listen to me
[1:21:30] that in itself still does not take away
[1:21:34] that sometimes even in the midst of
[1:21:36] something that where the love of God can
[1:21:38] take over and there's ways God will
[1:21:40] guide that circumstance and when I come
[1:21:43] out from under that there can be hurt
[1:21:45] there can be things that have been said
[1:21:47] there are things that you know have been
[1:21:49] mentioned a certain way brother Samuel
[1:21:51] what do you do I must go to God In
[1:21:54] Prayer
[1:21:55] because you know why I don't trust this
[1:22:06] guy I'm just going to stop there tonight
[1:22:10] I'm probably talking about bride
[1:22:12] material I'm talking about bride
[1:22:15] material listen
[1:22:18] Saul Saul himself you watch how Saul
[1:22:21] conducted himself Saul was jealous
[1:22:25] saw what sought everything about David
[1:22:27] he was
[1:22:28] envious look how David conducted himself
[1:22:31] he had multiple times to take Saul's
[1:22:35] life but you see God allowed his
[1:22:38] character to be tested in
[1:22:42] situations he was already anointed king
[1:22:45] you've already been anointed Queen but
[1:22:48] God's allowing situations to test your
[1:22:51] character to prove the character for the
[1:22:55] throne that's fit to rule and
[1:23:01] Reign easy no this is not this is not
[1:23:05] something we're looking into and
[1:23:06] preaching that's just oh this is just
[1:23:08] easy it requires us
[1:23:11] dying it requires us really looking in
[1:23:15] on our lives and looking at things you
[1:23:18] understand what I'm saying when I'm
[1:23:19] praying I'm not looking at the other
[1:23:22] person oh the hurt and or whatever and
[1:23:25] everybody's been through there this is
[1:23:26] not this is not this is not sad stories
[1:23:29] this is reality I'm just sharing from
[1:23:31] from in my life and in my heart because
[1:23:34] it's a person can say oh yeah charity
[1:23:36] suffereth long and it's kind yeah praise
[1:23:38] the Lord amen I'm talking about living
[1:23:40] it I'm talking about an experience it
[1:23:43] ain't just something that just comes and
[1:23:45] goes but these are things that we must
[1:23:48] give ourselves too and these are
[1:23:50] experiences in our life there's things
[1:23:53] that you know even though God teaches us
[1:23:55] he trains us we come through experiences
[1:23:58] in our life it doesn't make the next
[1:23:59] experience easier it just builds faith
[1:24:02] that God will see me through this one
[1:24:04] the same way he's seen me through that
[1:24:06] one there's not one of us that would
[1:24:08] raise our hand and want to go through
[1:24:10] certain things again Lord I don't want
[1:24:12] to go through certain things again I
[1:24:13] don't want certain troubles in the
[1:24:15] church again I don't want this again I
[1:24:16] don't want to face this again I nobody
[1:24:18] wants to do that but to know this one
[1:24:21] thing that God who has seen me through
[1:24:25] seen you through seen us through that
[1:24:27] same God will see us through again but
[1:24:30] how do I suffer
[1:24:32] long suffering long with
[1:24:35] kindness and in that prayer as I told
[1:24:38] you sometimes that
[1:24:40] praying it takes quite a bit of
[1:24:44] prayer I'm just telling you takes quite
[1:24:46] a bit of prayer now what I'm telling you
[1:24:48] it should not be anything new to
[1:24:50] you but I just say it like this it takes
[1:24:53] more than me just praying over my
[1:24:55] oatmeal of the
[1:24:56] morning he take some real as brother
[1:24:59] Brian would call it grubbing out with
[1:25:01] with with that Garden hole digging
[1:25:04] things out digging it
[1:25:08] out I say
[1:25:10] Lord prepare me
[1:25:14] Lord help me Lord
[1:25:16] Jesus this is this is my
[1:25:19] desire that this be even further
[1:25:22] manifest in my life
[1:25:25] I'd say tonight if the thing that we
[1:25:27] could do is say God help me to be more
[1:25:29] sensitive let me say this to you the
[1:25:32] great Mysteries that had come forth but
[1:25:35] God has opened to us the word in this
[1:25:36] hour I want you to think brother Ram
[1:25:39] himself he had to take a
[1:25:41] break because when he had developed that
[1:25:44] complex he got he got to a
[1:25:47] place and what did he say he said I
[1:25:50] can't be of a help to nobody as long as
[1:25:52] I feel this way and you recognize this
[1:25:55] is why it's so crucial what I see in the
[1:25:59] ministry also of brother brandham I
[1:26:01] don't only see that in
[1:26:03] 1963 I can we can see that I can show
[1:26:05] you that down in 19
[1:26:08] 1955 it can show you at 57 show you in
[1:26:11] 60 brother brandham evaluating his own
[1:26:15] life not pointing fingers at somebody
[1:26:18] else but recognizing his need of more of
[1:26:24] God
[1:26:27] fenses come situations come they will
[1:26:31] come but within this part of
[1:26:35] it Lord in the suffering long taking it
[1:26:39] to God and
[1:26:41] prayer and being kind that takes along
[1:26:45] with that that takes the help of the
[1:26:47] Lord to be
[1:26:49] kind Jesus said pray for them who
[1:26:53] despitefully use
[1:26:55] you may God help
[1:26:58] us Heavenly Father Lord
[1:27:03] tonight dear God your word as we look
[1:27:05] into
[1:27:07] this
[1:27:09] Lord Lord just pouring over these things
[1:27:12] Lord for some
[1:27:15] time lord just meditating and looking
[1:27:18] into
[1:27:20] it to know that lord it's your desire
[1:27:25] to really help us
[1:27:27] lord it's your desire Lord to help any
[1:27:30] life that maybe has not come into that
[1:27:34] place Lord where they have this resource
[1:27:37] or this fountain that they're tapped
[1:27:41] into but dear God it's available to
[1:27:45] them may they just continue to surrender
[1:27:48] to you may they just continue to fall in
[1:27:51] love with you in simple obedience
[1:27:55] to your word simple
[1:27:58] obedience Lord God as you spoke to
[1:28:01] Abraham the Bible says in the
[1:28:04] selfsame
[1:28:06] day he took ishmail and those of his
[1:28:09] household and circumcised him he was
[1:28:13] obedient to the word of
[1:28:16] God lord
[1:28:19] Jesus I pray
[1:28:22] father for those of us Lord in our lives
[1:28:25] our walk with you
[1:28:27] then we realize Lord
[1:28:31] that it's moved into that place in our
[1:28:33] life or our life it's governed by the
[1:28:36] love of God but Lord no matter
[1:28:40] where we would be or how long we've been
[1:28:43] serving you we find ourselves Lord when
[1:28:46] we look at
[1:28:48] this in the
[1:28:50] scripture this is so contrary to that
[1:28:53] first
[1:28:54] nature I think of how brother Brandon
[1:28:57] would talk about in the message
[1:28:58] explaining the healing of gyrus his
[1:29:01] daughter he said here comes a man
[1:29:03] walking down the street and somebody
[1:29:05] says look at that old Holy Roller going
[1:29:09] there he said how
[1:29:11] that Satan would suggest to the flesh
[1:29:16] get even with him the flesh would
[1:29:19] suggest to the Mind get even with
[1:29:23] them
[1:29:24] he said but by the time it gets back to
[1:29:26] the inside if the good man of the house
[1:29:28] is
[1:29:29] there he say vengeance is mine saith the
[1:29:33] Lord it will come out Lord an emanating
[1:29:37] of
[1:29:38] love oh it isn't that Lord we don't feel
[1:29:41] the hurt it isn't that Lord that hurt is
[1:29:45] not
[1:29:47] felt charity suffereth long how could
[1:29:50] there be a suffering if there's not an
[1:29:52] impact to it there is is an impact a
[1:29:55] feeling to
[1:29:57] it but dear
[1:30:00] God you give us
[1:30:04] Grace to be able to be of a long
[1:30:08] Spirit help us
[1:30:10] Lord help us to recognize Lord God as
[1:30:13] children of God more and more clearly
[1:30:16] Lord You're not expecting us to do this
[1:30:19] on our
[1:30:20] own but dear God we've got a fountain
[1:30:23] we've got a re
[1:30:26] Source Lord Jesus I'm so
[1:30:29] thankful I'm so thankful dear God that
[1:30:33] there is
[1:30:34] strength there is
[1:30:37] virtue in that of the love of
[1:30:40] God the Lord Jesus would move in our
[1:30:45] lives in such a
[1:30:47] way that would help
[1:30:50] us to seow peace
[1:30:54] it would help us
[1:30:56] Lord that as Paul would bring it by the
[1:30:59] spirit of God it would help us
[1:31:01] Lord with the
[1:31:03] suffering to do it with kindness Lord I
[1:31:07] know this is this is so against our
[1:31:11] first birth our first
[1:31:13] nature but Lord God it's so in line and
[1:31:16] in tune with that new nature our new
[1:31:19] birth Lord God it's right in line with
[1:31:22] it this is this this is the desire from
[1:31:24] our heart
[1:31:26] Lord help us Lord as you fulfilled that
[1:31:29] word through Moses life where it was
[1:31:34] demonstrated that you
[1:31:36] pardoned you were slow to anger Moses
[1:31:40] also had his times where
[1:31:43] Moses displayed some anger so it showed
[1:31:46] the humanity that was still there but
[1:31:49] this portion of scripture that we read
[1:31:51] here tonight Lord in Nehemiah 9
[1:31:55] the display of that
[1:31:57] longsuffering of the kindness that's the
[1:32:00] kindness of
[1:32:02] God you took a
[1:32:05] man subject to like passion such as we
[1:32:09] are a man who did not even have the Holy
[1:32:12] Ghost as we have it
[1:32:14] Lord but father to show the power where
[1:32:18] that word would find its place in the
[1:32:22] life oh God
[1:32:25] we want to give
[1:32:26] ourselves and
[1:32:28] live live from that Fountain Lord help
[1:32:32] us Lord help us to drink from that
[1:32:35] Fountain when offences come when things
[1:32:37] come our way may we lord draw from that
[1:32:40] Fountain Lord may we take Time Lord in
[1:32:45] prayer Take Time Lord to really
[1:32:50] consecrate ourselves before you
[1:32:54] you're the only one Lord that can make
[1:32:56] this word live and live it through
[1:32:59] US Lord God forgive us Lord of our
[1:33:04] mistakes our failures Lord our
[1:33:06] sin I pray that God may we lord God as
[1:33:10] we would come through this Lord and as
[1:33:12] you would take us Lord through these
[1:33:14] scriptures Lord May our hearts Lord be
[1:33:18] really warmed by your
[1:33:20] presence May there be a deepening in our
[1:33:23] life and in our walk

[1:33:30] the desire the achievement Lord that you
[1:33:32] would
