[0:00] playing in our life that the word brings
[0:02] out because the words are discerner we
[0:04] want to side with the word like when
[0:06] Moses said whoever is on the Lord's Side
[0:08] let him come and Stand By Me
[0:11] amen
[0:13] for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him
[0:16] and where the word of a king is there is
[0:21] power
[0:22] and who may say unto him what do us
[0:26] whoso keepeth the Commandment shall feel
[0:30] no evil thing oh I love that who so
[0:33] keepeth the Commandment shall feel no
[0:36] evil thing it didn't say evil things
[0:37] might not come but you will not feel any
[0:40] evil things
[0:42] why because the king's word has power
[0:45] and if you receive the king's word you
[0:48] receive the authority and the power of
[0:51] that word with you
[0:53] and no evil thing shall you shall feel
[0:56] and a wise man heart discerneth both
[0:58] time and judgment amen may God bless you
[1:01] bless the reading of the word as you're
[1:03] being seated
[1:04] it's again just such a privilege and
[1:06] honor to be gathered here together this
[1:08] morning
[1:09] and I want to draw your attention back
[1:11] to that word actually in verse 4 and
[1:14] you know so much through all of these
[1:16] verses of scriptures just so precious
[1:18] and speaking of the authority and us not
[1:21] being in a haste and not siding with the
[1:23] word
[1:24] I want to just say when we look here
[1:26] over verse 4 for where the word of a
[1:30] king is
[1:31] There Is Power
[1:33] and you know someone else might give a
[1:36] word and that word could be questioned
[1:38] maybe if it's somebody in the king's
[1:40] court that maybe would be a little less
[1:42] or it would be someone without that but
[1:44] where a king's word is when that King's
[1:47] word is spoken by the king it's a word
[1:50] that is not to be questioned now think
[1:54] of it in in the days of Esther where uh
[1:57] where a hazrus remember with the
[1:59] authority of that word that when he gave
[2:02] his word and he spoke for vashti to come
[2:05] that's that she would come because he
[2:07] wanted to to to to to show to show off
[2:11] before all of those who were there and
[2:13] she refused to come in his word now
[2:16] because she rejected the word in order
[2:20] to come remember then the king himself
[2:24] he put her away because she rejected the
[2:27] word
[2:28] so the word has the power to join us or
[2:32] to actually uh cause that to where we
[2:35] are rejected or put away but I want to
[2:37] just focus on that here this this
[2:40] morning that as king hazarus went on
[2:42] within that and remember there was a
[2:44] word that you know Haman came and threw
[2:47] deceit and so forth he calls there to be
[2:49] a a law that was passed that the Jews
[2:52] were to be destroyed but within that
[2:54] here God begins to move upon Esther and
[2:56] I don't want to get so much into that
[2:58] that part of it because that's not
[2:59] really where I'm going but I want to
[3:00] focus on just the authority of that word
[3:02] to where that when the king of hazrus
[3:05] would rise up and here he would say I
[3:08] cannot undo what has already been
[3:10] written but what I can do is I can you
[3:14] you and your people speaking to Esther
[3:16] you can rise up on the day beforehand in
[3:20] other words make a preparation and you
[3:23] can go and deal with all of those of
[3:26] your enemies that was going to to come
[3:28] and take your life let me say this that
[3:31] sin the Bible says that the ways and the
[3:34] pleasures of sin is death
[3:37] we understand that what lays before it's
[3:39] certain and the word of God that word
[3:42] cannot be taken away but there is a word
[3:44] that has come to you and I that lets us
[3:48] know that we can make ready against that
[3:51] day that we can actually rise up by the
[3:54] authority of God's word through the
[3:57] blood of Jesus Christ and that very tie
[4:01] within our life that is tied to Satan by
[4:04] the first birth is broken by the power
[4:08] of the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[4:10] Holy Spirit so it allows us to prepare
[4:14] ourselves against that day to prepare
[4:17] ourselves to live and to walk in Liberty
[4:19] and I I want to just speak here just for
[4:22] a few moments on the power of the word
[4:24] the power of the word and when you look
[4:28] at this where the word of a king is
[4:30] there is power that means there is
[4:32] Mastery that is there there is a power
[4:35] to be exercised that is also to become
[4:38] master or even the word dominate is
[4:41] within this particular word which means
[4:43] to have a commanding influence on or to
[4:46] exercise control over and we realize
[4:48] that no matter where you're at even
[4:50] gathering in this Gathering here this
[4:52] morning we are either under the
[4:54] influence of God when we are under the
[4:57] influence of Satan we are we're being
[4:59] influenced by one power or another and
[5:01] it's not our thoughts because remember
[5:03] the God is not a thought nor is Satan a
[5:07] bad thought
[5:09] the Bible said concerning the Holy Ghost
[5:11] when he is come not a thought but when
[5:15] the person of Jesus Christ is come
[5:19] and we also recognize that the devil is
[5:22] also a spiritual being so it's not just
[5:25] a bad thought and a good thought but we
[5:28] know we can tell and discern even by the
[5:32] thoughts that are coming to us who is
[5:35] trying to influence us
[5:37] who is trying to inspire us
[5:42] so we want that of the word and the word
[5:45] is meant to have a commanding influence
[5:47] Upon Our Life
[5:49] and uh you know when we see this in the
[5:52] scripture you know there is a need as
[5:56] Paul would write that the veil Upon Our
[5:59] Hearts would be taken away that that
[6:02] Veil because there was a veil upon the
[6:05] hearts of those Pharisees and those
[6:07] religious men who knew the word so
[6:12] perfectly
[6:13] if we could say it like this so it'd be
[6:15] simple those men on Sunday school charts
[6:18] their their line would have been filled
[6:20] up with stars
[6:22] they were they can recite the verses
[6:24] they had all the Sunday school toys they
[6:26] had all that they knew the letter
[6:30] but they didn't know God
[6:34] that's why the Bible says to know just
[6:37] the letter the letter killeth
[6:41] because the latter itself is actually
[6:44] pointing us to the very person of Jesus
[6:48] Christ
[6:49] the letter killer but it is the spirit
[6:52] that giveth life
[6:54] I don't know about you but I want life
[6:57] amen and you know the veil itself within
[7:01] their life was to be when that Veil is
[7:05] taken away then that heart is turned to
[7:07] the Lord and that comes by the spirit of
[7:11] almighty God who brings Liberty it is
[7:14] God alone who breaks the veils upon
[7:19] lives
[7:20] you remember that the young man who was
[7:22] healed in his eyes and here you know
[7:25] when he came and he hadn't seen the Lord
[7:28] Jesus and everything had taken place
[7:30] between him and his parents and the
[7:32] Pharisees but when he stood there and he
[7:34] came face to face with the Lord Jesus
[7:36] after his eyes were healed Jesus asked
[7:39] him the question do you believe in the
[7:42] Son of God he said who is he Lord that I
[7:45] may believe
[7:48] you see he was Desiring who is he he'd
[7:51] been touched you see there had already
[7:53] been a touch that had come into his life
[7:55] that was undeniable
[7:59] this man saw and he never had seen
[8:03] before
[8:04] and now that he's seen physically
[8:07] he was the same God who moved for a
[8:10] physical need upon his life do you
[8:12] realize God can touch your life
[8:14] physically and the things that he'll do
[8:16] and let me say this this is where the
[8:19] question should become why has God done
[8:22] this for me why has God moved upon this
[8:24] from me and what must I do I'll tell you
[8:27] that is God's love his grace and his
[8:30] care you say what must I do I would
[8:32] begin to seek after him because if he
[8:35] can open your eyes he can heal your body
[8:37] he can deliver you from oppression he
[8:40] can break the hold of drugs and alcohol
[8:42] and cigarettes that same God is there to
[8:46] loosen the hold upon your soul that is
[8:49] tormented you and plagues you and bring
[8:51] a real Deliverance in your life I tell
[8:54] you that's what I do I'd say Lord who is
[8:56] he that I might believe
[9:00] glory be to God that veil was done away
[9:04] with and he began to worship
[9:07] and this is why
[9:09] where the spirit of the Lord is
[9:11] there's liberty
[9:14] let me say this God's God's objective
[9:18] it's not just that we feel Liberty in
[9:21] the house of God let me say this I
[9:24] believe that there's any place there
[9:25] ought to be Liberty it's in the house of
[9:27] God
[9:29] I said if there's any place there ought
[9:30] to be Liberty it's in the house of God a
[9:33] liberty where it's being proclaimed that
[9:36] you're free you can walk free there is
[9:39] Deliverance there God has made
[9:41] Appropriations that man could come I
[9:43] believe with all my heart this ought to
[9:45] be a place of Liberty but God's desire
[9:48] is not that Liberty will not just remain
[9:50] here
[9:51] but that it would come here
[9:54] because where the spirit of the Lord is
[9:57] there's liberty
[9:59] we can live and walk us free
[10:02] freedom
[10:04] and this is where we are changed the
[10:06] Bible would say for into the same image
[10:09] from Glory unto Glory
[10:12] now his word
[10:14] his word is his voice
[10:18] are you hearing me now
[10:19] his word is his voice
[10:22] Jesus said my sheep know my voice
[10:27] and they follow not it
[10:30] me
[10:32] so he is the word the word was made
[10:36] flesh and dwelt Among Us my sheep hear
[10:39] my voice and they follow me
[10:44] so we see we can't be following Jesus
[10:47] and not following his word
[10:50] if there's another voice that comes and
[10:52] says this doesn't apply to this age it's
[10:55] not the voice of God
[10:58] it's the voice of a hireling it's the
[11:01] voice of a stranger
[11:04] are you with me because the voice of the
[11:07] chief Shepherd calls to the Sheep of God
[11:10] you may not recognize and have fully
[11:13] recognized that you are a sheep but the
[11:15] only way that you can hear the voice of
[11:17] the shepherd because many can hear his
[11:19] voice and they take his voice and say
[11:22] what's he asking of me what's he
[11:24] requiring but to a sheet there is a
[11:26] prevailing Authority in his voice there
[11:29] is a love that ministers to them that
[11:31] says with your condition with your
[11:33] situations I not only can do something I
[11:37] did something for you I have already
[11:39] loosened you I bore the stripes I paid
[11:42] the price that you can walk through all
[11:44] of that Authority is ministered in the
[11:48] voice of God to the Sheep of God
[11:52] Hallelujah so he is the word and the
[11:55] word speaks
[11:59] the word was smitten
[12:02] in order to speak
[12:04] right there had to be a Calvary in order
[12:07] to release the voice
[12:09] when you see now that there was a
[12:11] Calvary now it releases The Voice
[12:14] that was there and now that voice comes
[12:17] forth to announce and declare freedom
[12:22] in other words I am your freedom I am
[12:25] your Jubilee
[12:27] I am your Shield I am your buckler I am
[12:30] your all-in-one I am your healing I am
[12:32] your deliverance I am your Shepherd he's
[12:33] announcing who he is how can he do that
[12:36] because remember he went and paid the
[12:38] price and the Bible said when he arose
[12:40] he said all power in Heaven and Earth is
[12:43] given into my hand and he rose up and
[12:46] ascended there and he sat at the right
[12:48] hand of the Majesty on high it's not a
[12:51] young boy sitting on an old man's hand
[12:53] it's figurative right hand speaks of
[12:56] authority and Power
[12:59] because when John Luke John never said I
[13:01] looked and saw three he said one sat on
[13:04] the throne
[13:08] hallelujah it's the devil that wants to
[13:10] break that confusion you know why
[13:12] because if he can bring that confusion
[13:14] then the expectation is you are
[13:17] receiving something lesser than God but
[13:20] God himself became man God created a
[13:24] body for himself to dwell in why that he
[13:27] might come and dwell in his people
[13:31] this is why the agnostics and the
[13:34] unbelievers wanted to question and say
[13:36] Jesus is not come in the flesh and John
[13:39] said whosoever say that Jesus Christ is
[13:42] not come in the flesh is the spirit of
[13:45] antichrist
[13:46] why because it's the Living God who
[13:49] comes flesh in his people
[13:52] I'm glad about that there is a liberty
[13:55] that I can walk in a liberty in a
[13:58] freedom that I can stand here under the
[14:00] authority of that same voice that same
[14:03] anointing and Proclaim that same Liberty
[14:09] Psalms 29 4.
[14:11] the Bible said that the voice
[14:13] of the Lord
[14:15] is powerful yes it is
[14:18] the voice of the Lord is full
[14:22] of majesty
[14:24] somebody say powerful
[14:26] somebody say full of majesty
[14:29] that's what the voice of the Lord is
[14:33] it's full of majesty that's honor that's
[14:36] Glory that's power that's Dominion the
[14:39] word the voice of the Lord is powerful
[14:45] hey there was a woman who had an
[14:47] infirmity of blood let's just go as he's
[14:50] taking this
[14:51] she will bound with that infirmity
[14:53] she had went to every doctor
[14:58] you know why she wanted help
[15:01] I need help I this Blood condition I
[15:04] need delivered from this and no doubt
[15:06] the doctors were doing all they could to
[15:08] try to help her
[15:10] but when she came and she said I've got
[15:14] to touch Jesus
[15:15] you know what it was she recognized God
[15:19] was present in Christ
[15:22] it didn't matter how many Skeptics how
[15:26] many doubts how many things was trying
[15:28] to plague her way she said if I can get
[15:31] to him
[15:32] I know I shall be made whole
[15:36] Hallelujah
[15:38] also another another woman who was pound
[15:41] over remember she was bound over like
[15:43] this the Bible said she had an infirmity
[15:46] she could not raise up let me tell you
[15:48] that's just not a Bible story and that's
[15:50] just not for that woman it was God
[15:52] demonstrating in that power that there's
[15:54] things that you've bowed to there's
[15:56] things you've given yourself to it may
[15:58] not have been sin as you call it but it
[16:00] might be depression it might be anxiety
[16:03] it might be Pride it might be a lot of
[16:05] things that's come in your life bruises
[16:08] and emotional scars but there is a power
[16:10] that just as he said right there Woman
[16:14] Thou Art loose I'm asking you whose
[16:17] hands were laid on that woman it was the
[16:20] voice of God that spoke to that
[16:23] condition
[16:24] you are loose
[16:28] you are free
[16:30] that's the power of the word of God
[16:33] listen friends those things that he just
[16:36] spread Express expressed right here are
[16:38] not things to be minimized they are not
[16:40] things to be glorified they are not
[16:42] things to even be toiled around played
[16:44] with or even put on a shelf and Polished
[16:46] they are meant to have dominion over
[16:50] you got quiet on me but that's okay
[16:54] we have we in much just as much as we
[16:56] stand and against sin in every other way
[16:58] we should stand that same way
[17:01] brother Sammy you don't know what I
[17:02] battle I'm not asking what you battled
[17:04] with I'm trying to remind you of your
[17:06] rights and who you are that what am I
[17:08] saying don't ever make a place in your
[17:10] life tore it
[17:12] but you stand right there and you let
[17:14] the enemy know you have no right here
[17:16] you have no place here
[17:19] my life is reserved for almighty God
[17:22] [Applause]
[17:24] Hallelujah the voice of the Lord is
[17:27] powerful the voice of the Lord is full
[17:29] of majesty
[17:31] so the most powerful think of it between
[17:33] the two forces between God and Satan
[17:37] God who if I would ask the question who
[17:40] has the most most power obviously God
[17:43] does
[17:45] right God has the most power
[17:48] now once you think of this
[17:50] how do the message the contest you see
[17:52] what God gave them in the beginning was
[17:54] the best thing he could give them
[17:56] to combat with I'm talking about back in
[17:58] Eden he gave him his word
[18:01] all they had to do was stay with that
[18:03] word
[18:04] but in the midst of conflict and battle
[18:07] Eve let down on that word
[18:10] and remember she didn't even have her
[18:11] own name at the time
[18:13] right the Bible said in Genesis 5 in the
[18:15] day when he created them he called their
[18:16] name Adam
[18:19] because to the believer we don't have
[18:22] our own name
[18:24] come on you know people want to ask what
[18:26] church you go to what as though we got
[18:28] to have our own identity my identity is
[18:30] in him
[18:32] the Bible says that the people in heaven
[18:35] and earth all that are named The Name of
[18:37] Jesus Christ
[18:38] so we're not going by our own name
[18:40] because sometimes if you go your own
[18:42] name you say something in name then you
[18:44] know what the doctrine they prescribed
[18:45] to
[18:46] right because their Doctrine has
[18:48] produced a name it's produced in
[18:50] Allegiance has produced a church but you
[18:52] see God was never interested in
[18:53] producing a church remember the church
[18:55] itself was in God's mind before the
[18:57] foundation of the world and God knows
[18:59] that his church being reproduced will
[19:01] actually be himself being revealed in
[19:04] the lives of his people not the idea of
[19:07] a man not the idea and the schools of
[19:09] theology but the living presence of the
[19:12] Living God coming down and manifesting
[19:15] himself to and through and in the lives
[19:17] of his children Upon This Rock I will
[19:20] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[19:23] shall not Prevail against it I tell you
[19:26] what there is many things that could
[19:27] Prevail against these walls they could
[19:30] Prevail against the walls of a natural
[19:32] church but we're not talking of a
[19:34] natural Church we're talking of a
[19:36] spiritual church that is known as the
[19:38] body of Jesus Christ
[19:42] and it cannot be prevailed against
[19:45] now think about it he gave his word to
[19:47] combat the enemy let me say this who's
[19:50] stronger than God
[19:53] anybody
[19:55] no like he asked Sarah is there anything
[19:57] impossible with God
[20:01] now think about it Sarah standing right
[20:03] there she has not been had the ability
[20:05] to have children
[20:06] right and God gave a promise she's
[20:09] looking at the promise and looking at
[20:10] her body and saying how is this going to
[20:12] be
[20:14] but you see if you look at the promise
[20:16] and look at yourself
[20:17] is looking at the wrong way
[20:19] but when you when your promise is made
[20:22] look to the one who is speaking it
[20:25] look to the one who has made that
[20:28] promise and the same God who made that
[20:31] promise is greater than all of your
[20:33] infirmities is greater than all of your
[20:36] complexes he's greater than all of your
[20:38] weaknesses who are you talking about I'm
[20:40] talking about how Shady eye the almighty
[20:44] God the Living God for in his word is
[20:47] power and Majesty the authority to
[20:51] change our bodies
[20:54] one
[20:56] and the word
[20:57] the word is God is that the word
[21:01] Amen in the beginning was the word and
[21:03] the Word was with God and the Word was
[21:04] God and the word becomes our strength
[21:09] God in the church becomes its strength
[21:13] to pull Satan into his own fires
[21:17] now I want you to think of this
[21:19] because we know that we are in a battle
[21:23] just in case you didn't know we're in a
[21:25] battle
[21:26] and Paul admonished as Believers he said
[21:29] finally my brethren
[21:31] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[21:33] of His might
[21:35] put on the whole armor of God
[21:38] that you might be able to stand against
[21:41] The Wiles of the devil
[21:43] Peter said that this line that Satan
[21:46] himself he's not a lion but he roams as
[21:49] a lion
[21:50] seeking whom he may devour
[21:54] right are you hearing me Satan's not a
[21:57] lion he tries to mimic the true lion
[22:01] and the true lion is almighty God the
[22:05] true lion is the lion of the tribe of
[22:07] Judah
[22:09] he tries to mimic was that right he
[22:11] wants to try to mimic him and put forth
[22:13] a word that would want to bring fear
[22:15] want to devour want to want to I consume
[22:19] a life but his consumption listen to me
[22:22] now Satan's way of consuming a life is
[22:27] to wrap it up with such unbelief
[22:29] such doubt with such things about its
[22:33] life to where that life sees no other
[22:36] way
[22:39] don't come that way
[22:42] think what the chief Shepherd said he's
[22:45] called Satan is nothing but a thief and
[22:47] a robber God gave you those virtues God
[22:51] placed those in your life God gave you
[22:53] those attributes God gave you the desire
[22:56] to serve him but Satan's desire is to
[22:59] come as a thief and try to take
[23:01] opportunities from your life whether
[23:03] it's a young person a middle age or an
[23:06] older person he wants to come as a thief
[23:08] in deceive he left to rob you of what
[23:11] God has for you you know why he is
[23:14] afraid of that word taking effect in
[23:17] your life why it will move and perform
[23:19] the same way it did in the body of the
[23:22] Lord Jesus for he said the works that I
[23:25] do shall you do also and greater than
[23:29] these meaning more because that same
[23:31] life has now been dispersed
[23:34] [Applause]
[23:37] true
[23:39] he's afraid of that word coming into its
[23:41] place in our lives
[23:44] so Satan will study
[23:46] our strategy with the word of God
[23:48] he studied it perfectly perfectly when
[23:51] he came to Eve
[23:53] and he uses the strategy of reasoning
[23:58] and reasoning is now listen
[24:00] God told us in the book of Isaiah said
[24:02] come let us
[24:04] reason together
[24:06] right though thy sins be a Scarlet they
[24:11] shall be white as snow
[24:13] but it really matters who you're
[24:14] reasoning with
[24:15] when you reason with the word or your
[24:17] reasoning is with the word
[24:19] then we then it's of God
[24:21] but when come on now I'm not out I had
[24:24] too many things I can quote on this one
[24:26] but when your reasoning goes against the
[24:28] word
[24:30] that's where you recognize your enemy
[24:33] yeah right what did Satan do what did
[24:36] Satan do to her in the beginning now
[24:38] think of this she's under the word but
[24:40] he comes to anoint her with disbelief
[24:44] right now remember the word has power
[24:47] the word is the anointing the word
[24:50] itself coming forth and he begins to
[24:52] speak to her and that anointing begins
[24:54] to move and she entertains it she stops
[24:58] to listen the best thing she could have
[24:59] done is said hold on just a second here
[25:04] we're going to stop this right here
[25:07] but she entertained it
[25:11] so when she entertained it then that
[25:13] anointing was able to move it just kept
[25:15] to listen to me now it kept on moving in
[25:18] her life
[25:20] you see backsliding doesn't take place
[25:23] at just one moment
[25:27] you start entertaining reasoning against
[25:29] the word of God well not pretty good
[25:31] I'm a pretty good guy pretty good girl
[25:34] I'm telling you I'm pretty good compared
[25:36] to what
[25:37] yeah well you should see my neighbor you
[25:38] know to compare yourself to your
[25:39] neighbor you compare yourself to the
[25:40] word looking unto Jesus who is the
[25:44] author and the finisher of our faith
[25:46] right I mean I could compare myself to
[25:48] my dog I'd be a lot better than my dog
[25:50] but we we have a right to compare that's
[25:52] why Paul said they that compare
[25:53] themselves among themselves are fools
[25:56] we don't compare ourselves with other
[25:58] flesh We compare ourselves with the word
[26:01] we are not predestinated to be conformed
[26:05] to the image of somebody else we have
[26:07] been ordained to be formed to the image
[26:10] of his dear son who is his dear son he
[26:15] is the word for there are three that are
[26:19] one the Father the word and the spirit
[26:24] are you hearing me now
[26:28] so now we don't want to we don't want a
[26:31] reason with the word
[26:34] we want to believe the word
[26:37] just believe it
[26:39] he said brother I said just like this
[26:40] just believe it don't try to explain it
[26:43] don't try to figure it out
[26:48] I know these are simple Parts but
[26:49] sometimes this is where we get caught up
[26:52] trying to figure it out trying to
[26:54] explain it
[26:55] just believe it
[26:57] a simple simple thing that God asked us
[27:00] to do and that's where Satan wants to
[27:02] come in complicated
[27:04] are you hearing me now Paul said he was
[27:07] jealous over the Church of the Living
[27:09] God with a Godly jealousy lest Satan
[27:13] should corrupt your minds from the
[27:16] Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ
[27:22] the gospel is not a complicated Affair
[27:24] it is the Simplicity of God's Life
[27:28] coming and doing in us for us and
[27:32] through us what he has already made a
[27:34] way for
[27:37] what must I do well what would you do if
[27:39] the King was coming right you won't
[27:41] stand in the way of the king's word you
[27:42] let the king's word come
[27:45] right they had Runners right they had
[27:46] Runners that went before the king
[27:50] and Runners I know I'm speaking you know
[27:52] not in this day and age but there are
[27:54] Runners that went before the king why
[27:56] because the King was saved the King was
[27:58] coming down this pathway
[27:59] and the King was going to come this road
[28:01] that's the road he's going to come
[28:03] you're not going to put up a detour and
[28:04] say you cannot come this way
[28:06] he is the word
[28:08] and he always comes according to his
[28:11] word he never deviates from his word
[28:13] he's not a man that he should lie nor
[28:16] the son of man that he should repent
[28:19] right his word is sure but God will send
[28:22] a forerunner God will send a messenger
[28:25] God will send a message God will send a
[28:28] word that does what remember what John
[28:30] the Baptist said here he was he was
[28:32] announced already in the book of Isaiah
[28:35] the voice of one crying in the
[28:36] wilderness and they asked him who do you
[28:39] say that you are and what did he do he
[28:42] pointed the what you see this ministry
[28:45] is identified in the scriptures because
[28:49] anything that is of god that is really
[28:52] sent as a real move of God will always
[28:55] identify itself in the scripture and
[28:59] there'll not be a contradiction of
[29:01] another scripture against it
[29:03] because the Bible says that no scripture
[29:05] is of any private interpretation
[29:08] is that right that he is the Alpha and
[29:12] Omega it's Jesus Christ the same
[29:14] yesterday today and forever
[29:16] right and that messenger would have to
[29:19] go and he would have to see that
[29:22] Boulders impediments things that could
[29:25] be stumbled over all those things that
[29:27] would hinder the king from coming
[29:30] oh are you with me now
[29:33] what Authority does does that messenger
[29:36] have does that one have to say hey let's
[29:39] get this cleared out of here
[29:40] hey let's get this Boulder cleared out
[29:42] hey that log that tree that's falling
[29:45] across the path let's get that cut up
[29:46] and get that out of the way by whose
[29:48] authority the king is coming
[29:51] the king is coming
[29:53] and I am his messenger carrying the
[29:56] message that the king is coming and he's
[29:59] not going to come a different way he's
[30:01] coming this way
[30:03] [Applause]
[30:06] glory be to God so he must come this way
[30:09] so God sends his Messengers to do what
[30:12] prepare the way of the Lord
[30:16] sure God makes a way for his word to
[30:19] come into your life into my life
[30:23] sometimes you really you know you can
[30:24] send and say well I just want the king
[30:26] to come in but he's going to come
[30:27] according to his way
[30:28] he's already laid his word his way out
[30:30] in his word allow the word himself to
[30:33] prepare the way that he the word the
[30:36] king himself might come and sit down on
[30:38] the throne of your heart
[30:42] you can't figure out God
[30:44] anybody ever tried doing that
[30:47] well I have sure I have
[30:50] oh brother Sammy you might be talking
[30:51] about years ago no I mean even in
[30:53] situations that can take place in my
[30:55] life right now
[30:56] we can try to figure it out
[30:58] we have certain things that maybe it's
[30:59] going to happen this way or or I wonder
[31:01] why this or I wonder
[31:03] come on Friends these aren't glorified
[31:05] yet
[31:07] are you with me but it always comes back
[31:09] to the one thing I don't know but I
[31:12] trust you
[31:14] I know that I know that I know I know
[31:17] him
[31:18] and I know he works everything according
[31:21] to the Council of his own will
[31:24] and who art thou old man that I would
[31:26] ask God and that thou mayest instruct
[31:28] him
[31:29] come on now I'm in the Bible
[31:31] right who is it that can stand before
[31:33] the word of a king and say why are you
[31:35] saying this why are you saying that
[31:37] really can this be don't dispute with
[31:40] the word don't reason with the word
[31:43] except the word and believe the word
[31:48] because the word has power
[31:51] it the word brings to pass whatsoever he
[31:55] has said
[31:57] you can't figure God out this word is
[32:00] just made to believe
[32:02] that's our strength
[32:05] just accept the word
[32:10] so if we could just say it like this we
[32:13] want to
[32:14] unleash
[32:16] the power
[32:18] of that word by believing it and
[32:20] accepting amen the word there's power in
[32:24] the word but you see it's only going to
[32:27] be powerful to you
[32:30] if you'll stay in the presence of him
[32:32] who spoke it
[32:33] if you take the side with him
[32:36] against evil if you'll take and let the
[32:39] word go to work in your life
[32:41] then there's an authority that moves in
[32:44] to bring to pass what the King has said
[32:46] then you know what happens you become
[32:49] the expression of the king's Authority
[32:53] because it's his authority living in
[32:56] your life
[32:57] that's why Jesus said I have given you
[33:00] power over unclean spirits
[33:03] I have given that's that's the Church of
[33:04] the Living God that if we go forth
[33:07] preaching the gospel and those that
[33:10] believe and are baptized in my name
[33:13] shall be saved an authority to stand
[33:18] against every unclean spirit
[33:20] I'll tell you there's not a devil that
[33:22] can stand before the name of Jesus
[33:23] Christ
[33:24] [Applause]
[33:26] there's not a devil are you saying you
[33:27] just say that no I I've prayed for many
[33:29] and seen many different in many
[33:31] situations there's probably not too many
[33:33] Devils anything printed too much that
[33:35] you can name that I haven't witnessed
[33:37] and seen conquer standing right there
[33:39] I'll tell you he's God above it all he's
[33:43] still the mighty conqueror
[33:45] let me tell you something I've got gonna
[33:47] come to reform people he don't come to
[33:49] give your mind over matter it comes to
[33:52] give you his mind his life that you
[33:56] would reign in this life
[34:00] not that you have to be looking over
[34:01] your shoulder and wonder how well I tell
[34:03] you what I've been 10 days clean or I've
[34:05] been 30 days clean I tell you if you
[34:07] ever get your soul clean you'll never
[34:08] look over your shoulder anymore because
[34:10] you recognize there's no going back
[34:12] because the hold that was upon my life
[34:14] has been broken
[34:18] that's the power of the word what does
[34:20] it do it takes you from looking over
[34:22] your shoulder
[34:23] your fear to a place of authority
[34:26] where you become a testimony
[34:29] so give me a scripture on that the man
[34:31] of caterer he was bound we don't even
[34:33] know his name he was known by the Mount
[34:36] of devils that possessed his life
[34:38] Legion
[34:40] is that right things would arise after
[34:43] so long a time and he would go to the go
[34:45] to the catacombs you know he would use
[34:46] his six days six days six days up at
[34:48] work and personal leave because he was
[34:50] out there he couldn't be around his
[34:52] family family didn't want him being
[34:53] around there he was all out there
[34:57] let me tell you it started on one time
[35:00] if you'd ask Legion what happened Legion
[35:03] stop just for a moment
[35:06] I started with one little bit of
[35:07] reasoning started with one little drink
[35:09] started with one little smoke I started
[35:12] with one little look I started it all it
[35:14] takes because you can't control sin
[35:19] are you hearing me now
[35:21] you want me you cannot control it it has
[35:24] to be one on the inside of you
[35:27] a God that brings a Deliverance in your
[35:30] life
[35:33] but when that man got free remember
[35:35] Jesus came across the sea for that one
[35:39] man let me tell you something God will
[35:41] take this service for one person
[35:45] that's my Jesus
[35:48] my Jesus is not afraid of busting up the
[35:51] program my Jesus is not afraid that oh
[35:54] I'll go contrary to this song that ain't
[35:57] my Jesus
[35:59] his program is before the foundation of
[36:02] the world
[36:03] amen and it's coming right down in
[36:05] through time right here and that same
[36:08] Jesus he crossed the sea for one that
[36:11] saved Jesus will cross the sea let me
[36:13] tell you what he'll do he'll go through
[36:15] your back barriers of doubt he'll go
[36:17] through every barrier that the enemy has
[36:20] ever wanted to put upon your life there
[36:23] is nothing that can stop my Jesus
[36:26] nothing
[36:29] while we're preaching we might as well
[36:31] preach
[36:32] [Applause]
[36:33] he was a woman by the name of Rahab
[36:36] help me preacher now
[36:38] she was on she was inside a walled City
[36:42] she couldn't get out on her own
[36:45] the Walsh was too thin
[36:48] and you know you know in The Book of
[36:51] Leviticus to be inside a walled city is
[36:53] a curse
[36:55] you and I were born man born of a woman
[36:58] is full of trouble and a few days old we
[37:01] were born under the curse of sin we
[37:05] couldn't get out of it
[37:06] we were walled in
[37:09] but there was a God who came down
[37:12] and that same God right here this
[37:14] morning he'll tear down every wall
[37:17] [Music]
[37:20] Hallelujah there's not a wall too thick
[37:23] then my Jesus can't break down
[37:28] [Applause]
[37:29] you say I can't get to him but he can
[37:31] get to you
[37:34] he can break the walls down but you'll
[37:37] be able to walk out
[37:38] and you have to say pardon me a minute I
[37:40] gotta step over this Rubble what is that
[37:43] Rubble that Rubble is what was trapping
[37:44] you in but let me remind you it ain't
[37:47] nothing but Rubble
[37:48] [Applause]
[37:50] all the brick and mortar that Satan
[37:52] wanted to put over your life to him you
[37:54] in is nothing but Rebel
[37:56] when the voice of God shouts forth
[38:00] [Music]
[38:03] the way the Bible said let every man
[38:06] be swift to hear
[38:09] slow to speak
[38:12] for the wrath of man James 1 20. the
[38:15] wrath of man worketh not the
[38:17] righteousness of God
[38:18] see our
[38:20] our own
[38:21] uh doing things in her own self well I'm
[38:24] gonna do this no
[38:25] we have no Authority on our own
[38:28] Jesus said
[38:30] I can do nothing
[38:32] of myself
[38:34] but what I see John 5 19 the father
[38:38] doing that doeth the son likewise
[38:44] Hallelujah
[38:46] so we're not acting upon enthusiasm
[38:49] we're acting under authority of divine
[38:53] inspiration
[38:54] this is why verse 21
[38:57] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[39:02] superfluity of naughtiness
[39:05] and receive with meekness
[39:08] the engrafted word which is able to save
[39:12] your souls
[39:15] notice lay lay everything else aside
[39:20] but how can I do that
[39:23] because the authority
[39:25] of the King has spoken
[39:29] his word has spoken
[39:32] when the word has spoken and addressed
[39:35] sin in your life don't sit there with
[39:38] sin in your life
[39:39] if there's things that need to be made
[39:41] right make it right
[39:44] are you hearing me
[39:46] repentance friends is not a cheap word
[39:49] repentance is the key to all the
[39:51] promises of God
[39:55] in this day and age repentance has been
[39:57] replaced by excuses
[40:01] well I wouldn't be this way and so and
[40:02] so and so and so no no no the gospel
[40:04] came to take care of that
[40:07] it's true that they're not no doubt
[40:08] there have been some rotten apples in
[40:10] your life but don't forget you're a
[40:11] rotten apple too
[40:13] but down at the core there's a real
[40:15] child of God we're not here to pick out
[40:18] rottenness we're here to see Sons and
[40:19] Daughters of God come into full reality
[40:22] all right don't allow excuses well
[40:24] so-and-so did this or so and then that
[40:26] sort of and I don't want to talk about
[40:28] them I want to talk about what did the
[40:30] Lord Jesus do for you
[40:32] because he has done for you what nobody
[40:34] else could do how many times you say oh
[40:37] they wronged me how many times have you
[40:39] wronged him
[40:40] he's coming knocked on your heart he's
[40:42] spoken to you time and time again
[40:44] he's come to you and told you he loves
[40:47] you he cares about you he wants to do
[40:49] for you and you turn it away
[40:51] and then you can stand in his presence
[40:54] and say these people have wronged me he
[40:56] has done nothing but love you and give
[40:59] himself for you and speak to your heart
[41:03] who is it that even walk in a bar and
[41:05] bring conviction in your heart
[41:09] you say you mean Jesus would do that he
[41:11] walked into a pig pen one time where
[41:13] there was a prodigal son big Angel of
[41:15] the Lord knew just where that boy was
[41:17] [Applause]
[41:20] afraid of those conditions
[41:22] you know why he's coming for his sheep
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:28] you're not a drunkard
[41:30] come on follow me now you was ordained
[41:33] to be a sheep of God
[41:36] oh
[41:39] he's here
[41:42] Hallelujah that does not define who you
[41:45] are
[41:46] the word is defining who you really are
[41:51] Satan's wanted to put that label on your
[41:53] life Satan's wanted to Define that but
[41:55] God is letting you know you are a son
[41:58] and daughter of God
[42:00] [Applause]
[42:03] hallelujah what must I do lay aside all
[42:06] those other things and receive with
[42:09] meekness
[42:10] being grafted word of God which is able
[42:14] to save yourself you're not engrafted
[42:15] word means within this word it's
[42:18] implanted with his nature
[42:23] scripture second Corinthians chapter
[42:24] three the Bible tells us concerning the
[42:26] law right Paul said the law is Holy and
[42:29] good
[42:30] right so the law was not done away with
[42:32] the law becomes established by the Holy
[42:34] Ghost in our hearts that's what God had
[42:36] said he said I will write upon the
[42:38] tablets of your heart my law
[42:40] why because his law God whether we're
[42:43] being expressed what was glorious about
[42:45] the law because the law only pointed out
[42:46] you're guilty you're guilty you're
[42:47] guilty you're guilty you're guilty right
[42:49] that's what the law did right but where
[42:52] where where where there was sin Grace
[42:54] did much more abound
[42:56] and the grace of God came to do for you
[42:59] and I what we could not do ourselves
[43:02] the grace of God came to do what to pay
[43:05] the price
[43:07] that the work of the Holy Spirit could
[43:10] come and write the law upon the tablets
[43:14] of our heart to where our nature is
[43:16] changed
[43:17] don't you see that's why being born
[43:19] again
[43:22] it's been so cheaply used
[43:27] you're born again while I'm born again
[43:28] and you see him you think well you ain't
[43:30] no different than anybody else
[43:32] see it's been so cheapened God never
[43:35] cheapened it
[43:36] God never cheapened his word the Bible
[43:38] said in Isaiah 59 that when the spirit
[43:41] cometh in like a flood the eye the Lord
[43:43] will raise a standard against it what is
[43:46] the standard of God it's his word coming
[43:48] in power and authority to bring
[43:51] deliverance and stand down in the midst
[43:53] of our life
[43:56] foreign
[44:00] is to give it place
[44:03] that's what meekness is
[44:05] to give it place
[44:07] now you see
[44:09] God knows how to soften you and I up
[44:12] this is why the Bible tells us in the
[44:14] Book of Ezekiel he said I will give them
[44:17] a new heart
[44:18] and a new spirit
[44:20] a new heart new way of thinking
[44:24] thinking in a Sanctified way
[44:26] right you think about the things that
[44:28] are being done you become open to the
[44:30] word of God and a new spirit
[44:31] God comes in to deal with that new
[44:33] spirit
[44:34] but remember the new spirit is not the
[44:35] Holy Spirit
[44:37] a person can have a new heart and a new
[44:39] spirit
[44:40] the Bible tells us in first John that
[44:42] there are three that agree in one
[44:46] right
[44:47] there are three that the water the blood
[44:49] and the spirit they agree in one
[44:52] but a person can be justified
[44:55] and not Sanctified not cleansed
[44:58] they can be sanctified
[45:00] and not be filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:04] this is why Paul would announce know you
[45:06] not you are a temple of the Holy Ghost
[45:08] he's letting the people of God know
[45:10] these are your rights and don't stop
[45:13] short of it
[45:15] you are ordained to be a Dwelling Place
[45:17] of God's own life
[45:19] and not to receive that word with
[45:21] meekness
[45:22] to let it have its rightful place within
[45:26] our life that then after the new heart
[45:29] and new spirit then his Spirit comes in
[45:34] are you with me
[45:35] you see this is why let me I I want to
[45:38] just refer to a couple places here
[45:40] the Bible tells us God resisteth the
[45:43] proud it's not a first Peter 5 5.
[45:47] and giveth grace to the humble
[45:50] how many desire Grace
[45:52] God resists the proud
[45:54] those are just well I you know I'm good
[45:57] God resists the proud that's why I don't
[45:59] stand in any evil thing side with the
[46:01] word
[46:02] humble yourselves therefore under the
[46:05] mighty hand of God
[46:07] that he may exalt you in due time
[46:11] casting all your care upon him for he
[46:15] careth for you
[46:17] see God cares about you
[46:19] he cares about your life
[46:22] he wants to do for you what no one else
[46:25] can do he cares what must I do well he
[46:30] cares do you care right
[46:33] do you care
[46:35] what about the same I do care do you
[46:37] care
[46:38] what are you doing to show that you do
[46:40] care
[46:42] are you accepting his word or are you
[46:46] reasoning against it
[46:48] let me say this there's two forces that
[46:50] work faith and doubt are standing right
[46:54] at your heart
[46:57] doubt would want to tell you you'll be
[46:59] all right to the next service there may
[47:00] not be a next service
[47:02] and there may not be a next service for
[47:04] you
[47:05] remember this life is for the
[47:07] opportunity for you and I to surrender
[47:10] Our Lives to God and to walk with God
[47:12] and to serve him the Bible said the fear
[47:14] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[47:16] to serve him to do his word is that
[47:19] right
[47:20] oh my
[47:23] humble ourselves under the mighty hand
[47:25] of God that he may exalt you in due time
[47:26] notice in James chapter 4. the Bible
[47:30] said do you not think the scripture says
[47:32] in vain that the spirit that dwelleth in
[47:34] us lusteth to Envy but he giveth more
[47:39] grace
[47:40] I love that
[47:42] he don't just give a little Grace he
[47:44] gives more grace
[47:46] wherefore God resisteth the proud but
[47:50] giveth Grace unto the humble submit
[47:53] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[47:56] devil and he will flee from you notice
[47:58] what does submit mean
[48:00] voluntarily surrender and come under
[48:08] before so what does it mean if submit
[48:11] and humble means to surrender and come
[48:15] under
[48:16] than to not do it would be Pride
[48:21] what is somebody else going to say
[48:24] somebody else ain't going to stand there
[48:26] for you on that day
[48:28] somebody else ain't going to give you
[48:29] authority to live in this lifetime as an
[48:31] overcomer
[48:32] but there is one who can give you and
[48:34] release to you the authority that
[48:36] belongs to you the Liberty as a son and
[48:38] daughter of God
[48:40] well I've been around this message for
[48:41] all those years don't let pride stand in
[48:43] your way God resisteth the prize
[48:46] you cannot resist him and expect more
[48:49] grace to come because it is not Grace
[48:51] that you are receiving that allows you
[48:53] to live in unbelief that is disgrace you
[48:57] are not receiving Grace because when
[48:59] Grace comes to you and I it is Grace to
[49:02] correct us Grace to show us our way and
[49:05] Grace to come and bring forth in our
[49:07] life what he has called for
[49:09] and he giveth more grace you know what
[49:11] that means as we come under that word he
[49:14] gives more grace
[49:15] we come under the word he gives more
[49:17] grace
[49:18] holy Lord I'm struggling here but when
[49:21] Lord you're aware it is true I give
[49:23] myself the Lord to you I Surrender more
[49:26] grace
[49:27] this is why when there's sufficient
[49:30] Grace
[49:32] that a life can be convicted and be re
[49:34] and repent of their sins what are they
[49:36] doing receiving of Grace
[49:38] and as they will receive that Grace then
[49:41] they make themselves available for more
[49:43] grace what's more grace for God to come
[49:45] and cleanse the habits out of their life
[49:48] cleanse them up sanctifying to feel the
[49:51] longings that they've tried to feel with
[49:52] everything else let me tell you there's
[49:54] not a woman nor a man nor anybody nor a
[49:57] job nor a stock nor money can feel the
[49:59] emptiness of your heart but there's one
[50:01] who can feel
[50:02] he can feel that he can satisfy you
[50:05] are you hearing me
[50:07] David said blessed are they whom thou
[50:09] causeth to approach to thy house o God
[50:12] for they shall be satisfied with the
[50:15] goodness of God
[50:16] it comes to a place to where you're sat
[50:19] you know how it is when you're satisfied
[50:20] when you've ate and somebody says hey
[50:23] guess what we got something else over
[50:25] here in our house
[50:28] you know Mom Dad somebody shows up
[50:30] something comes out for Thanksgiving and
[50:32] hey we got this particular pie out
[50:35] you think Lord why did I eat more of
[50:37] that sweet potato casserole I should
[50:39] have saved more room for the pumpkin
[50:40] streuseling yeah it sounds good right
[50:42] now don't I but use it as an example
[50:46] when God has filled our life you see God
[50:49] wants to feel our lives
[50:52] who were satisfied
[50:56] to where the world
[50:58] no longer sin no longer has Dominion
[51:06] remember short verse of scripture three
[51:09] words remember
[51:11] Lots why
[51:14] the word told her
[51:16] walk
[51:18] she started hearing some cries come from
[51:21] Sodom
[51:22] you pulled on her heart
[51:25] she turned and looked back and became a
[51:28] pillar of salt
[51:29] all she had to do is heed to the word
[51:32] and she would have walked on but this is
[51:34] why Jesus could say those three words
[51:36] remember lost why why
[51:39] gave heed
[51:42] to another voice
[51:44] she started out as an overcomer and
[51:47] eventually because he never became a
[51:52] full overcomer
[51:53] eventually the word world
[51:57] overcame her
[52:01] is powerful
[52:04] let me let me try to let me try to bring
[52:06] this down we giveth more grace and God
[52:08] giveth Grace unto the humble
[52:11] draw nine to God and He will draw nigh
[52:13] unto you
[52:15] humble yourselves in the sight of God
[52:18] that he may exalt you up
[52:21] God gives Grace upon great let me tell
[52:23] you there is sufficient Grace this
[52:25] morning
[52:26] for healing of your body
[52:30] they're sufficient Grace you realize I'm
[52:33] talking to everybody here
[52:36] I'm talking to everybody this applies to
[52:38] every condition
[52:39] in our lives
[52:41] no matter where you're at with God even
[52:45] obtaining every promise of God and God
[52:48] working with our life it depends on are
[52:52] we humbling ourselves
[52:54] to him
[52:56] don't reason against it
[52:58] the word is made to believe
[53:02] think of what Paul would say here
[53:06] he said God
[53:08] hath chosen you
[53:10] from the beginning and second
[53:11] Thessalonians 2 13 to Salvation through
[53:14] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[53:16] of the truth whereunto he called you by
[53:18] Our Gospel
[53:20] to the obtaining of the glory of our
[53:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[53:26] let me just let me bring this here to
[53:27] this moment
[53:29] the word itself has its coming
[53:34] it's got to come
[53:37] to the Mind first
[53:39] that's why Satan attacks your mind
[53:42] the four servants and in a service
[53:46] because the word has got to be accepted
[53:50] in the mind
[53:54] once it's accepted in the mind now it's
[53:57] not our thoughts
[53:59] it's his
[54:01] thoughts
[54:02] not our thoughts our thoughts do not
[54:05] have life in them
[54:06] his thoughts has life
[54:09] to receive his word is life
[54:13] so for a mind to be open to accept the
[54:17] word of God as it's coming
[54:19] to accept it
[54:26] think of this
[54:27] what does accept mean
[54:31] what does accept me
[54:33] it'd be just like brother William if I
[54:36] were standing here
[54:38] let's say with uh a gift certificate
[54:41] okay
[54:45] I know the places you like
[54:48] so I don't know all of them but I know
[54:49] one of them but if I had a gift
[54:51] certificate to that place
[54:53] and if what you said was oh that's
[54:55] wonderful
[54:57] oh that's great
[55:00] yes it's wonderful oh I can oh
[55:04] and then you get up
[55:06] and you walk out
[55:09] what's the problem
[55:12] you never accepted it
[55:14] I've got it right here in my hand
[55:17] but you've got to accept it
[55:21] you've got to accept it
[55:24] you've got not a reason against it oh
[55:26] you don't know no it's not about you
[55:28] it's about the word
[55:30] it's not you that we're lifting up or
[55:33] you that we're putting down it is the
[55:35] word
[55:36] Jesus said if I be lifted up
[55:40] then I will draw all men unto me
[55:45] and it's to him to be presented it's for
[55:48] us to accept him
[55:50] and to come under that word so in our
[55:52] mind let me just finish this point
[55:55] to accept
[55:57] that word in our mind
[56:00] then believe it
[56:03] with our heart
[56:07] then the spirit of God
[56:10] comes upon that word
[56:13] to bring it to past
[56:15] are you hearing me you first must accept
[56:18] it in the mind and that's where the
[56:20] Battleground is that's the same thing
[56:23] when it comes to even healing in our
[56:25] body
[56:26] Satan wants to battle in our mind
[56:30] when it comes to Deliverance when it
[56:31] comes to other things he wants to battle
[56:33] in our mind
[56:35] when you tried this before you've done
[56:37] this before what's he doing that ain't
[56:40] God saying that
[56:41] is the devil wanting to battle in your
[56:45] mind
[56:46] because if you can accept that word like
[56:48] like as I said walking here and taking
[56:51] it and saying that's my word
[56:55] accept the word don't reason against it
[56:58] accept it and believe it let it drop
[57:01] down into your heart
[57:03] and then the spirit of God is what comes
[57:06] and Waters it
[57:10] praise the Lord
[57:12] let me tell you
[57:13] I know what God can do in just a moment
[57:17] are you hearing me I know what God can
[57:20] do in a moment I know God can change
[57:22] your life just in a moment
[57:23] but I also know that God there are times
[57:26] that where there is a work that's going
[57:28] on in a life
[57:30] and that work is just Grace
[57:32] being received upon Grace received upon
[57:35] Grace well brother Samuel they've been
[57:37] sentenced so long in this Grace why
[57:38] don't you stop looking and evaluating
[57:40] everybody else
[57:41] and start evaluating your own life and
[57:43] receive God's grace
[57:45] God didn't put anybody in here with a
[57:47] black pants and whiten you know zebra
[57:49] shirt with a whistle
[57:51] you've been in justification too long
[57:53] you've been in sanctification too long
[57:55] then if you can do something about it do
[57:57] something about it for him
[57:58] well what should I do I'm speaking plain
[58:00] what should I do pray for him that more
[58:03] grace would come
[58:07] because we grow in the grace and
[58:09] admonition of the Lord
[58:11] I'm not here to push people on
[58:13] are you hearing me I'm not here to do
[58:15] that because when you do that then it
[58:17] becomes you and it becomes a man's work
[58:18] you got to push them to church pull them
[58:20] to church push them to church pull them
[58:21] to church you're not to be dependent
[58:23] upon a man you are to be United with
[58:25] Jesus Christ he is your lord he is your
[58:27] savior he is your Redeemer he should
[58:29] deliver he's the one that paid the price
[58:31] for you you ought to have a relationship
[58:33] with him
[58:36] there is one fathering Lord of us all
[58:39] and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:41] so what are you saying I'm saying I
[58:43] watch God and I can look to God as God
[58:46] will build lives
[58:48] sometimes there's things that takes
[58:50] place instantaneous and sometimes if
[58:51] things listen I'm even speaking to
[58:53] people personally that even questioning
[58:55] your life right now I know where I'm at
[58:57] I know where he's leading me you can
[58:59] look at your life and say well I didn't
[59:00] receive don't compare yourself to
[59:01] somebody else well I don't see this
[59:03] right now let me tell you something the
[59:05] work of God does not take place on the
[59:06] outside end it takes place from the
[59:08] inside out
[59:10] he works to change the inside
[59:13] I've got an oak tree in my yard right
[59:15] now we've never seen squirrels the whole
[59:16] time we've lived there
[59:18] I've lived there now for five years in
[59:20] that home
[59:21] and now those squirrels want to torment
[59:23] my dogs
[59:25] my dogs can't get to them you know they
[59:26] can't go beyond that barrier but those
[59:29] because there's
[59:31] there's acorns everywhere
[59:35] you know how long it took to produce
[59:37] them acorns
[59:41] well they put I don't know who planted
[59:43] it I don't know if a deer planted it
[59:44] squirrel planted it I don't know who
[59:46] planted that there
[59:47] I don't know it don't matter it don't
[59:50] matter are you hearing me it doesn't
[59:51] matter who planted it it wasn't who
[59:54] planted it that gave it the authority
[59:58] to be an oak tree
[1:00:00] it was in it the whole time
[1:00:06] and in the word of God being engrafted
[1:00:09] word holds the germ to become whatsoever
[1:00:15] he has said it will be
[1:00:18] you are always to be a son and daughter
[1:00:21] of God
[1:00:23] are you hearing me you are never meant
[1:00:25] to be
[1:00:26] certain slave or upon to him
[1:00:29] you're never meant to be that you are
[1:00:31] ordained to be a son and daughter of God
[1:00:33] it might have taken you a while to
[1:00:35] recognize it but there's the voice of
[1:00:38] God that speaks with power and a Majesty
[1:00:41] to let you know you are a silent
[1:00:43] daughter of God
[1:00:45] and it equips you to let you know you
[1:00:47] don't have to set in that condition any
[1:00:49] longer
[1:00:51] I'm bringing it down personal even with
[1:00:53] complexes and everything else in our
[1:00:55] life there is a power to bring healing
[1:00:57] in our life a power that can reach to
[1:01:00] where no surgeon can reach a power that
[1:01:02] can reach to where no psychologist can
[1:01:04] go to a one who can heal a wound that no
[1:01:07] womb doctor can heal but there is the
[1:01:09] great physician the almighty God he
[1:01:12] heals what's incurable he is the cure
[1:01:15] for it what is undeliverable he is the
[1:01:18] Deliverance for it
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:22] you see that word as it's coming forward
[1:01:24] what is it as you receive that word as
[1:01:26] what Eve received it brought disbelief
[1:01:30] but you receive this word it brings
[1:01:32] faith
[1:01:34] it brings Faith to do what lay aside
[1:01:37] everything else lay aside your thoughts
[1:01:40] about you lay aside your doubts lay
[1:01:44] aside your unbelief lay aside whatever's
[1:01:47] trying to hold you back and do what
[1:01:50] humble ourselves under the mighty hand
[1:01:52] of God that he
[1:01:54] will exalt us
[1:01:58] oh brother Samuel I don't want to get in
[1:02:00] the flesh news flash
[1:02:02] whatever your age is on your birth
[1:02:04] certificate that's how long you've been
[1:02:05] in the flesh
[1:02:08] well I don't want to act out of order
[1:02:11] you're never acting and let me say this
[1:02:12] to you you're never acting out of order
[1:02:14] when you're standing on God's word
[1:02:19] you're never out of order when you're
[1:02:21] standing on the word
[1:02:23] you're always in order when you're
[1:02:24] standing for the word of God
[1:02:27] let me say this to you
[1:02:28] I tell you where I would stand that even
[1:02:30] here this morning
[1:02:32] I would stand like Mary
[1:02:35] remember when Mary here she was
[1:02:39] she was ordained
[1:02:41] already
[1:02:42] God didn't have to write her name in
[1:02:44] Isaiah 9 6 God knew who it was talking
[1:02:46] about
[1:02:48] are you hearing me anybody been in a
[1:02:50] play before a drama a play
[1:02:52] never ever done that okay
[1:02:56] you have to try out for those parts
[1:02:57] don't you right you have to try out can
[1:03:00] I do this part let me tell you something
[1:03:02] in this drama
[1:03:05] there is no tryouts
[1:03:09] tryouts tryouts no the ACT the actors
[1:03:11] already wrote In
[1:03:13] [Applause]
[1:03:15] you might look at your life and say I
[1:03:17] don't fit that God said well you can't
[1:03:19] do it but you wait let me get inside you
[1:03:22] you let me come in and I'll act that
[1:03:24] part out and everything that's acted out

[1:03:29] same

[1:03:45] highly favored one who has received
[1:03:47] divine grace

[1:03:59] it's for you all you have to do is yield
[1:04:02] right Thou Art highly favored blessed
[1:04:05] art thou among women
[1:04:09] begins to announce
[1:04:11] what is to take place notice
[1:04:14] down Shout
[1:04:16] conceive
[1:04:18] I have a child
[1:04:21] you shall call his name Jesus
[1:04:24] he shall be I don't have time to read
[1:04:26] the scripture but notice as he went
[1:04:28] through right after that this is what is
[1:04:31] going to take place this is who you are
[1:04:34] you are highly favored remember she cast
[1:04:39] in her mind in her mind in her mind she
[1:04:42] said what kind of a saying is this
[1:04:50] now this was not a young lady who didn't
[1:04:52] know
[1:04:53] the scripture she knew it
[1:04:55] right but she cast in her mind what is
[1:04:58] this
[1:04:59] but the word came and let her know this
[1:05:02] is what's going to be fulfilled in your
[1:05:03] life
[1:05:05] see the word was moving with power in it
[1:05:08] it was dismantling all doubt
[1:05:11] all unbelief you know what she was doing
[1:05:13] she was standing
[1:05:16] in the presence
[1:05:18] of the word
[1:05:19] and what was the word doing the word was
[1:05:22] dismantling every hold
[1:05:24] it was breaking every hold it was
[1:05:27] breaking every doubt he was breaking
[1:05:29] unbelief she just stood in the prince of
[1:05:31] the word being unhasty to go out of his
[1:05:33] presence
[1:05:34] the word was dismantling every doubt
[1:05:40] and when it come to that place how is
[1:05:42] this going to be
[1:05:43] seeing I don't know a man
[1:05:46] see in order for there to be conception
[1:05:48] children it's got to be a man and a
[1:05:51] woman
[1:05:51] right and so her her question
[1:05:54] is a human question
[1:05:56] how is this going to be
[1:05:59] seeing I don't know a man
[1:06:01] and God announces
[1:06:04] the Holy Ghost shall over shadow
[1:06:11] a work of
[1:06:14] are you hearing me
[1:06:15] God it was letting it be known I don't
[1:06:18] need your egg
[1:06:20] I Supply egg and sperm together because
[1:06:22] this is not going to be a creation of
[1:06:24] man
[1:06:25] right it could not be a blood or he
[1:06:27] could not even merge himself with blood
[1:06:29] that was polluted
[1:06:31] right that had to be blood that would be
[1:06:33] perfect blood that's why Peter could say
[1:06:35] this is the blood of Christ
[1:06:37] it had to be perfect blood God created a
[1:06:40] blood cell that Satan could not put his
[1:06:42] finger on and say ah this this you know
[1:06:45] what deep doing God even in his coming
[1:06:48] was dismantling any accusation that he
[1:06:53] could ever raise against you and say yes
[1:06:56] but this blood but you can look and say
[1:06:59] that was a blood that was born free from
[1:07:04] sex desire
[1:07:06] and in that blood that was shed it paid
[1:07:09] the price
[1:07:10] for my sin debt
[1:07:13] that I could rise up the Unworthy
[1:07:16] go unworthy but he has made me Worthy
[1:07:23] I can accept what he has already done
[1:07:28] do you realize
[1:07:29] your salvation is not something new this
[1:07:31] morning it was already paid for
[1:07:36] it's if you accept it
[1:07:38] your deliverance was already paid for
[1:07:41] will you accept it your healing was
[1:07:44] already paid for will you accept it
[1:07:48] and what did she say
[1:07:51] be
[1:07:52] it unto me
[1:07:54] according
[1:07:56] to Thy Word
[1:07:58] she received
[1:07:59] the word
[1:08:01] in her mind
[1:08:03] believed in the heart
[1:08:05] and the Spirit come upon it
[1:08:11] brother Branham said oh he said a Saint
[1:08:12] Paul I quoted right there he said I've
[1:08:14] always said if Saint Paul could hear
[1:08:15] that preach see that Saint Paul would be
[1:08:17] shouting right now because that's the
[1:08:18] gospel it's received in the mind
[1:08:20] believed in the heart and the spirit of
[1:08:22] God comes upon it
[1:08:24] see this is why the word being accepted
[1:08:27] what am I doing brother Sam you know I
[1:08:29] tell you what I do I'd accept the grace
[1:08:30] of God
[1:08:31] if you've never repented I mean been
[1:08:34] convicted in your heart to where you've
[1:08:36] really repented well I've tried you know
[1:08:37] because sometimes people unders some
[1:08:39] people mistake repentance for well you
[1:08:41] know I start to I started feeling bad so
[1:08:43] I started reading my Bible that ain't
[1:08:45] repentance
[1:08:47] I'm not against you but I'm just trying
[1:08:49] we want to uncover the devil the devil
[1:08:52] don't want you to repent
[1:08:54] well I started praying well okay that's
[1:08:57] that's that's good but have you repented
[1:09:01] you have to repent and it's not well I
[1:09:04] have to do this this is what the word
[1:09:06] when the word goes to dealing with your
[1:09:08] life it's to repent it's to realize I'm
[1:09:11] a sinner I need you Lord Jesus
[1:09:15] forgive me of my sins but remember we're
[1:09:18] living in a day and age right now but
[1:09:19] it's not my fault it's everybody else's
[1:09:21] fault I am the way I am because of
[1:09:22] everybody else
[1:09:23] right but this is the day remember we
[1:09:26] will not be judged upon what Adam did in
[1:09:29] their disbelief we will be judged at
[1:09:31] what we did when the word came by our
[1:09:33] way
[1:09:33] what will you do with This Man Called
[1:09:35] Jesus
[1:09:37] what will you do with the Holy Spirit
[1:09:38] dealing with my life what would you do
[1:09:40] with it
[1:09:41] but you see when you repent
[1:09:43] then the Bible said be baptized in the
[1:09:45] name
[1:09:46] of Jesus Christ
[1:09:49] he's the sacrifice right
[1:09:51] that's the also Vision sacrifice
[1:09:53] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:09:57] Holy Ghost
[1:10:00] that's the promise of God's word
[1:10:03] it's just like when you need healing in
[1:10:04] your body
[1:10:06] it off begins to accept that promise
[1:10:10] Satan will work against you
[1:10:12] how many years
[1:10:13] how long how many prayer lines how many
[1:10:16] this how many of that you've been
[1:10:18] through let me tell you something
[1:10:21] what should I do casting down
[1:10:23] cast him down
[1:10:25] don't give him any place in your mind
[1:10:28] don't give him any place in your spirit
[1:10:30] cast him out
[1:10:32] what example am I following you're
[1:10:34] following the example that God did in
[1:10:36] heaven when he rose up in heaven God
[1:10:37] passed him out
[1:10:39] right that's how his children do we cast
[1:10:42] him out when he comes and says well you
[1:10:44] you'll you'll you'll never be well
[1:10:45] you'll never be free we cast him out and
[1:10:48] we accept the word
[1:10:50] by his stripes I am healed
[1:10:53] Hallelujah I am delivered by the blood
[1:10:55] of the Lamb
[1:10:58] Oh Brother Sam you know I've been prayed
[1:11:00] for for the Holy Ghost said you know I'm
[1:11:01] looking my love I really don't know it
[1:11:03] if it's come you're not I would confess
[1:11:05] that it's mine
[1:11:07] I would go ahead and go back oh I don't
[1:11:09] want to make our God to be alive who are
[1:11:10] you making out to be a liar he said he
[1:11:13] giveth the Holy Ghost to them that
[1:11:15] believe and he is the high priest of our
[1:11:17] confession
[1:11:20] I'm not confessing that someday I'm
[1:11:22] confessing right now he is my deliverer
[1:11:25] he is my seal he is my shield he is my
[1:11:28] butler I would confess the promise of
[1:11:31] God
[1:11:33] and don't back down one inch from it
[1:11:38] you believe that this morning
[1:11:40] Hallelujah we want to move on that word
[1:11:42] I want to we want Grace upon Grace upon
[1:11:45] Grace upon Grace it's the power of the
[1:11:49] word of God

[1:11:56] and letting it go down and letting the
[1:11:58] Spirit come in water you know how you
[1:11:59] water the word
[1:12:01] you water it with praise
[1:12:04] you water it with Thanksgiving
[1:12:08] you know Mary started testifying before
[1:12:10] she ever felt anything
[1:12:12] Mary never felt one thing in her womb
[1:12:15] and she went and spoke to Elizabeth
[1:12:20] she said she said I already knew yeah
[1:12:25] you didn't have to send me the baby
[1:12:26] shower announcement I already knew
[1:12:34] must been
[1:12:35] no but the same one
[1:12:39] who spoke to me
[1:12:41] had already confirmed what he did within
[1:12:43] you
[1:12:45] and here's what he said to me
[1:12:48] he said I should have a son and call his
[1:12:51] name Jesus
[1:12:53] and the Bible said when that name was
[1:12:55] spoken if the baby left in her womb six
[1:13:00] months she had never felt a kick or a
[1:13:02] punch but at the name of Jesus
[1:13:06] that baby responded
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:17] that life on the inside it's something
[1:13:19] about it when his word is preaching
[1:13:22] power and demonstration there is a life
