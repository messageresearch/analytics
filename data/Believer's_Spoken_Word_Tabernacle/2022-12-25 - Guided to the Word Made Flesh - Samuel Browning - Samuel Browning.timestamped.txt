[39:24] he said oh you say oh brother Brian of
[39:27] my I wish that you know I could I could
[39:29] do that and offer it up brother Brown
[39:31] said actually you've got it easier than
[39:32] job
[39:33] he said because job had to offer up the
[39:36] sacrifice all you have to do is accept
[39:38] because the sacrifice has already been
[39:40] offered us
[39:43] it's already it's already been offered I
[39:45] didn't have to offer it it's been
[39:47] offered once and for all
[39:49] right amen isn't that wonderful
[39:51] man if Joe could stand like that I'm not
[39:53] gonna preach on job this morning but if
[39:55] Joe could stand like that what about you
[39:57] and I
[39:58] what ground that we have to stand on a
[40:01] more
[40:03] sure Promises of God
[40:07] I just love the Lord this morning I
[40:10] don't want to keep you here long I just
[40:12] want to just express some things that
[40:16] the Lord has just
[40:18] placed on my heart and maybe try to lay
[40:20] a little bit of a foundation here for it
[40:22] it looks like even in a few services to
[40:24] come so we just want to kind of look at
[40:27] that and I don't think there's any am I
[40:30] missing any announcements honey
[40:35] I'm getting there I'm getting there
[40:39] I'm surprised if you ever see her with
[40:41] her phone now she's probably texting me
[40:44] yeah I would sometimes I always feel
[40:47] like I'm forgetting something when I get
[40:48] here and she is my helper she writes the
[40:51] notes for me and you know just like uh
[40:54] you know it's like brother Rock was good
[40:56] to have you back yes
[41:00] amazing
[41:03] Caroline's sister and then it was good
[41:04] to have you back they were here on
[41:05] Thursday and
[41:07] I told sister Caroline after service I
[41:09] said of course everybody that you all
[41:11] know me I it's it's not a positive thing
[41:13] but I'm just maybe in one way it is but
[41:16] I'm just so one-track mind when I come
[41:18] here it's announcements and everything
[41:19] he does such a wonderful job for me on
[41:22] that right there taking care of
[41:24] announcements and if I don't get it my
[41:27] wife has the notes coming to me
[41:30] but we love you in the Lord and I
[41:33] certainly want to say Merry Christmas to
[41:34] you Amen to each and every one
[41:37] you know and and if uh if that bothers
[41:40] you you can look it up in the message
[41:42] brother Brandon said it over and over
[41:45] sure you know and I that's why I you
[41:47] know for myself when I look at certain
[41:49] things I see how brother branham's
[41:51] approach within in the message of the
[41:53] hour
[41:54] and I also look at the life that was
[41:56] lived behind that and that's why if we
[41:59] try to make the quote say a certain
[42:00] thing and it's not matching up with what
[42:02] was being expressed then I look at all
[42:04] the way through there and said wait a
[42:06] minute there's a point that's being made
[42:08] here yes it is there's a real Point
[42:10] that's being made here
[42:13] and so I I'm just I'm thankful to God
[42:15] because I I believe with all my heart
[42:18] that when God sent this message the
[42:21] prophet not only delivered it
[42:23] but he was the example of what this
[42:25] message is all about right
[42:27] I could read you a quote of what T.L
[42:30] Osborne said t Osborne said when we saw
[42:32] William Branham we saw Jesus Christ once
[42:36] again in flesh not making William
[42:38] Branham Jesus Christ but he said
[42:41] we have seen him yeah we forgot
[42:44] but I'm grateful God brought a real
[42:46] present reminder to you and I in this
[42:48] hour you know what that reminder was all
[42:50] about it was about you and I that's what
[42:52] it was all about the relationship that
[42:54] God desires for you and I that's the
[42:56] that's the whole whole purpose of it
[42:58] amen
[43:00] well amen what a wonderful song service
[43:03] amen these brothers did Brothers do such
[43:06] a wonderful job and the the musicians I
[43:09] so appreciate them could we just give
[43:10] just a thank you
[43:19] and I tell you that uh what was that
[43:21] song you were singing was it heart
[43:23] Herald my goodness I tell you you know
[43:26] these songs these songs were not written
[43:29] as Christmas carols
[43:30] you understand when you go back and you
[43:32] rejoy to the world I know that the world
[43:34] but you also know Elvis Presley used to
[43:37] sing Amazing Grace but he don't have
[43:39] rights on Amazing Grace
[43:40] you know the reason they would sing I
[43:42] mean Elvis Presley could sing it but you
[43:44] know as far as their notes but he
[43:46] couldn't sing it from experience
[43:49] right
[43:51] so these are things the world don't have
[43:53] no claim on this the world's tried to
[43:55] claim it but talk about brought to you
[43:57] and I the second birth Lord have mercy I
[44:00] was just sitting back in the office you
[44:01] know I hear these songs but I'm
[44:03] listening to and I thought Lord have
[44:04] mercy you're talking about inspiration
[44:05] yes right I mean these are songs that
[44:08] are written and sometimes some of the
[44:09] song readers nowadays songwriters could
[44:11] take note about it instead of just
[44:13] repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat
[44:15] repeat repeat repeat repeat
[44:16] let's get a message
[44:18] let's get a message that's tracked
[44:22] I know I got a Preach Today
[44:26] amen God bless you amen listen could we
[44:29] just stand for the reading of the word
[44:31] amen just Good To Be With You amen this
[44:34] morning
[44:36] amen
[44:38] I'm just going to look here in the
[44:40] scriptures here and we'll just see how
[44:42] the Lord will take us this morning
[44:43] because I I just don't want to
[44:47] um
[44:48] overload in this at all either and I
[44:51] know I I always feel that way with
[44:53] things I don't want to overload and I
[44:55] just want to be very cognizant of the
[44:58] time as well and I know I I am I do have
[45:02] a timer before me at all times but today
[45:05] I really do I just want to be able to
[45:06] move here into a point
[45:09] and um
[45:11] we just want to look at Matthew chapter
[45:13] 2.
[45:15] amen
[45:17] and I'm going to read just a few verses
[45:19] of scripture then we'll let you have
[45:20] your seats maybe verses 1 and verse 2
[45:22] and then we'll just let you have your
[45:25] seats here
[45:27] amen
[45:35] the Bible says now when Jesus was born
[45:37] in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
[45:40] Herod the king behold there came wise
[45:45] men from the East
[45:47] to Jerusalem now notice they're coming
[45:49] from the East they're traveling to the
[45:51] West
[45:52] saying where is he that is born King of
[45:57] the Jews
[45:59] for we have seen his star in the east
[46:02] and are come to worship Him
[46:07] you know they've asked the question but
[46:10] that question holds a certainty in it
[46:12] where is he
[46:14] because we've seen the sign
[46:16] now we know he's here
[46:19] where is he
[46:21] now I want you to look they've traveled
[46:23] from the East to the West
[46:26] when the Shepherds came and I'm not
[46:28] going to speak on the Shepherds this
[46:30] morning but when the Shepherds because
[46:32] the nativity scenes that we see a lot of
[46:35] times don't have the Shepherds and the
[46:37] wise men they're together and the truth
[46:39] of it is they weren't there these are
[46:41] two separate time periods
[46:43] the Shepherds were there at the
[46:46] announcement of the birth the wise men
[46:48] are here after the babe now it's no
[46:52] longer babe but a child two years old
[46:55] because remember when Herod asked the
[46:57] question
[46:58] when did you see this star
[47:01] they said and they had to give him when
[47:03] did you see it and how long you've been
[47:05] on this journey that's how Herod knew
[47:08] when he sent them in kill every child
[47:10] that's two years and under
[47:13] right
[47:15] so here we find I want you to think of
[47:17] this here was the Shepherds they came
[47:19] and saw the Babe in a Manger but when
[47:22] the wise men called
[47:23] that child was standing on its feet
[47:28] so if you can also see the see the
[47:30] parallel from the Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:32] here is a bride that was born in infancy
[47:34] now the bride is standing on the feet
[47:36] yes sir that's so good
[47:39] so I'd like to speak this morning if the
[47:42] Lord would help us just to deliver a
[47:44] little bit of a of a thought
[47:46] on guided to the word made flesh
[47:51] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[47:52] Heavenly Father
[47:54] Lord these few moments that you've given
[47:56] us the Lord to be able to come together
[47:59] Lord we ask that you'll take control
[48:01] Lord
[48:02] father right now Lord and ask that you
[48:05] would deliver Lord those things that you
[48:07] pressed on My Heart Lord standing on
[48:10] this platform a couple weeks ago Lord
[48:12] that inspiration just struck me Lord and
[48:16] I'm asking that you'll come and just
[48:18] deliver Lord I want to be sensitive to
[48:20] you Lord to know when I've said enough
[48:23] Lord may you bless your children this
[48:25] morning in a special way oh God make
[48:28] your presence just draw near to every
[48:30] heart May every heart just welcome you
[48:32] Lord and just Lord that you find a place
[48:35] in every one of our Lives oh God we pray
[48:38] in the name of Jesus Christ amen God
[48:42] bless you you're being seated
[48:43] so if we can continue on reading here
[48:47] in Matthew 2 verse 3 if you wouldn't
[48:50] mind maybe to keep your Bibles there
[48:54] when Herod the king had heard these
[48:56] things he was troubled in all Jerusalem
[49:00] with him so Herod knew when when you
[49:03] make it a statement to a King and Herod
[49:06] is ruling over this jurisdiction and the
[49:09] question becomes where is he that's born
[49:12] King of the Jews
[49:14] that's speaking a threat to his kingdom
[49:17] yes it is
[49:18] and he didn't realize that Jesus wasn't
[49:21] coming to bring a threat to an Earthly
[49:23] Kingdom
[49:24] a Heavenly kingdom was making an
[49:26] entrance
[49:28] the kingdom of God was coming into the
[49:30] Earth
[49:32] and it was not going to come come under
[49:34] the Nations or the kingdoms of this
[49:37] Earth but we're talking the kingdom of
[49:39] God to come down and bring a Deliverance
[49:41] in the hearts and lives of his subjects
[49:45] that we would no longer walk by the
[49:48] prince of power of the air that we would
[49:50] no longer be moved by that of our first
[49:53] birth but that we would receive a real
[49:55] true Liberty being born of that Kingdom
[50:01] and live as subjects in this Kingdom and
[50:03] Herod thought what what's this what's
[50:06] this that's coming he's troubled about
[50:08] it but in verse 4
[50:11] he gathers all the chief priests and
[50:13] scribes of the people together and he
[50:16] demanded of them where Christ should be
[50:20] born
[50:21] and they said unto him in Bethlehem of
[50:24] Judea for thus it is written by the
[50:27] prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land
[50:30] of Judah are not the least among the
[50:34] princes of Judah for out of thee shall
[50:37] come a governor that shall rule My
[50:39] People Israel so they're pulling from
[50:42] the scriptures from the prophecy
[50:44] they know the prophecy of what God has
[50:48] spoke concerning
[50:50] the coming of the Messiah
[50:52] they are able to take the scribes and
[50:55] Priests are able to take when Herod asks
[50:58] where should the Christ be born they're
[51:01] able to take him here because it's been
[51:03] announced in scripture his pathway has
[51:07] been clearly identified all through
[51:09] scripture Isaiah 9 6 Isaiah 7 14 all of
[51:14] these places it's not something that has
[51:16] laid uh as though that well nobody knows
[51:20] they knew the places by prophecy but to
[51:23] think of it these scribes and these
[51:26] Pharisees and I'll get to it here in
[51:28] just a moment they did not see the
[51:32] Heavenly sign
[51:34] they knew the prophecy but they were
[51:37] unaware that the prophecy was in
[51:40] fulfillment
[51:41] as a matter of fact this right here when
[51:44] this is being when I'm reading this here
[51:45] we're reading it together this is two
[51:48] years after it's already taken place
[51:52] and they're not aware of it yet they're
[51:54] aware of Prophecy but they're not aware
[51:57] that God has already come and God has
[52:01] fulfilled and is fulfilling this word
[52:04] you see oh how this joint rejoices my
[52:08] heart because you don't have to be a
[52:11] smart person to know the Lord Jesus
[52:14] you don't have to God doesn't want our
[52:16] intellects because our intellects can't
[52:18] figure God out all God wants is our
[52:21] heart that's the whole purpose of his
[52:24] coming is to reclaim that part that
[52:27] rightfully belongs to him because if God
[52:30] has our heart then there is nothing
[52:33] that's impossible
[52:37] Herod
[52:38] perhaps we'll speak on that and
[52:40] sometimes in Herod when he had privately
[52:43] now notice he calls the wise men
[52:45] together
[52:46] he inquires of them diligently what time
[52:50] the star appeared so remember his whole
[52:52] purpose that he's got an objective in
[52:55] what he's doing
[52:56] and his objective it's full of Deceit
[52:59] what's the next verse he's and he sent
[53:01] them to Bethlehem so he communicates to
[53:04] them yeah here it is down in Bethlehem
[53:07] and he says go and search diligently for
[53:10] the young child notice he didn't say go
[53:12] search for the baby
[53:14] I know we understand these things but
[53:16] it's very important that he says go for
[53:19] the young child now notice and when you
[53:21] have found him bring me word again then
[53:24] I may come and worship him
[53:26] what Herod was speaking in deceit he had
[53:30] the wrong motive he had the wrong wrong
[53:33] objective but let me just say this to
[53:35] you God's word cannot be defeated
[53:39] Satan can try to turn the tables against
[53:41] you he can try to come at you try to
[53:44] come at me but God is watching over his
[53:46] word
[53:48] and Satan can try to hinder it he can
[53:50] try to prevent it but he can't stop the
[53:53] word from coming to pass
[53:55] he can't prevent that he can't stop it
[53:58] in your life he can try to send all
[54:00] sorts of thoughts he can try to send all
[54:03] sorts of discouragement he can try to
[54:05] hinder he can try to stop but you see
[54:07] you can't stop that word from coming to
[54:10] pass
[54:11] and here God is standing there too make
[54:15] known within all of this because as the
[54:18] wise men remember when they eventually
[54:19] when they go
[54:21] they God speaks to them in a dream and
[54:24] they realize we need just to depart back
[54:27] into our homeland a different way
[54:29] because Herod
[54:31] seeks of a different objective he's
[54:34] coming to kill the children
[54:36] he doesn't want to worship Him
[54:38] so
[54:40] I want to draw our attention here to the
[54:42] promise in Isaiah 7 14 here
[54:45] just if you just bear with me just a few
[54:48] moments allow me just to lay this in for
[54:50] this service and then
[54:52] building for the next service here and
[54:54] Isaiah 7 14. the Lord himself here's a
[54:58] problem here's a prophecy the Lord
[55:01] himself shall give you a sign
[55:04] so this is not something that is going
[55:07] to be handed out by a man it's God
[55:10] himself giving the sign
[55:14] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[55:18] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[55:23] now this promise had been known
[55:26] throughout all Israel Isaiah 9 6 as well
[55:30] all of these promises and remember how
[55:33] brother random tells us which would be
[55:35] natural thinking if you listen if they
[55:37] were Jews and you hear you were and you
[55:40] had a daughter wouldn't you also be
[55:42] looking and say this is possibly going
[55:43] to be my daughter this will possibly be
[55:46] mine why because the Bible said a virgin
[55:47] shall conceive
[55:50] and so every every true Jew was looking
[55:54] oh my
[55:56] every true Jewish brother Brown brings
[55:58] in and spoke a word's original C was
[56:01] looking with this expectation now for
[56:04] those parents who really didn't care
[56:05] about anything they didn't let the
[56:08] children do whatever but there was some
[56:10] real believing Jews who said I believe
[56:13] the word I believe God has entrusting us
[56:16] with with the with a leadership in this
[56:19] hour God's Gonna fulfill his word
[56:22] and if it's not in my generation it's
[56:25] coming nothing can stop it and so they
[56:28] lived and they raised their families
[56:30] with an expectation that you're the one
[56:34] I believe we should live that kind of an
[56:36] expectation in our lives the promise of
[56:39] the Rapture has been a promise but we're
[56:42] the people
[56:43] we're the people of the Rapture we're
[56:46] the people that the prophets have spoke
[56:48] about we're the ones that the scriptures
[56:50] have prophesied about I believe it ought
[56:53] to be that real to you and I that even
[56:55] as the word is coming forth we can look
[56:57] at it and say God you're speaking to me
[56:59] I'm the one the one the one the word's
[57:01] talking about this message is about me
[57:03] this message is for me this message came
[57:06] from me if it wasn't for nobody else it
[57:09] was for me
[57:10] that's how personal it becomes
[57:14] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[57:18] and shall call his name Emmanuel so his
[57:22] name
[57:23] that will be given or the title with it
[57:27] is that of God With Us it's declaring
[57:30] with us is God
[57:33] and this would be the sign that God
[57:36] would give that it would be God With Us
[57:39] God Among Us remember God's whole
[57:44] purpose
[57:46] once you just to capitalize on just a
[57:48] moment the whole purpose
[57:51] is that God might dwell in man
[57:57] he had that in Eden
[57:59] man is his Temple
[58:02] right not so much this yet Paul would
[58:05] say your body is the Temple of the Holy
[58:07] Ghost but remember the Tabernacle the
[58:09] temple had three courts
[58:12] and remember that no man because this
[58:15] body is the way that it is now it came
[58:17] between the section it was a sexual
[58:19] sexual act that came between a father
[58:21] and mother and coming together right
[58:22] even though our hair color eye color and
[58:25] all that that was all ordained by God
[58:28] but yet the way we came was a permissive
[58:30] will but remember he's Jehovah Jireh so
[58:33] the real Temple is that seed on the
[58:36] inside that a place that God has
[58:39] reserved for himself that is the holiest
[58:41] of holies
[58:43] that's where the presence of God comes
[58:45] that's where life begins in the place of
[58:48] rest that's where the new birth is is in
[58:51] the soul that's the temple of God and
[58:53] then from there it radiates through our
[58:55] spirit it radiates out into the flesh it
[58:58] covers all three courts no you're not
[59:01] your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost
[59:05] so that's God's purpose that's the whole
[59:07] that's the whole Canon of the scripture
[59:09] is that God might come and dwell once
[59:12] again inside of his people
[59:17] so brother Brandon would say it like
[59:19] this and we have seen his star and we've
[59:21] come to worship Him
[59:23] he said I want to wish you the merriest
[59:25] of Christmas and that God will send his
[59:28] star from the East that Rose in the East
[59:32] 1900 years ago and will guide you to the
[59:37] word made flesh
[59:41] now notice what he says here it's very
[59:43] important that God will send his star
[59:45] from the East
[59:47] that Rose in the East see the same son
[59:50] who Rose in the East that that same sun
[59:54] will rise again and lead us to the word
[59:57] may flesh remember the Bible says in the
[1:00:00] book of Isaiah let's turn here just for
[1:00:02] a minute as it comes to me Isaiah 59
[1:00:04] maybe they can pull it up on the screen
[1:00:06] for me Isaiah 59 I want to read that
[1:00:08] just as it's coming here to me Isaiah 59
[1:00:13] yes Isaiah 59 verse 19.
[1:00:18] notice how this is worded in verse 19.
[1:00:24] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:00:28] from the West
[1:00:31] notice God's rising in Authority rising
[1:00:34] in the west what is the West it speaks
[1:00:36] you can go no further west you're back
[1:00:38] East again
[1:00:40] that scripture has been fulfilled in the
[1:00:44] end time
[1:00:47] because it has Rose remember this
[1:00:50] ministry it Rose in the west it was all
[1:00:52] signifying the cloud all of that it
[1:00:55] signified judgment is at hand but notice
[1:00:58] he returned back to you and I to pick us
[1:01:01] up that we might come into that
[1:01:04] expression
[1:01:07] think of it all of this is is not just
[1:01:09] it's not just happenings
[1:01:12] the prophet receives that Revelation
[1:01:14] there there in subpino Canyon he
[1:01:17] receives that Authority and he goes back
[1:01:20] East why this is where you and I are at
[1:01:22] and we've got to come into that place
[1:01:24] with God
[1:01:25] God came and found you and I where we
[1:01:29] were
[1:01:30] that's the thrilling let me finish
[1:01:32] reading the scripture so shall they fear
[1:01:35] the name of the Lord from the West
[1:01:37] remember his name is his character his
[1:01:39] life and his glory from the rising of
[1:01:42] the sun when the enemy shall come in
[1:01:44] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:46] shall lift up a standard against him
[1:01:51] so what's the standard well standard
[1:01:53] well it's a rallying point it's a banner
[1:01:55] but the standard of the Lord is where
[1:01:58] God makes his word more real
[1:02:00] you don't have to add to it
[1:02:03] he makes it more real how does God make
[1:02:05] his word real by the word taking on
[1:02:09] flesh
[1:02:11] that's the standard of the word
[1:02:14] and when that standard because what is a
[1:02:16] standard you're going to a workplace and
[1:02:18] we can go here and there's standards
[1:02:19] what is the standard a standard is what
[1:02:21] we are called to and that's why this
[1:02:25] word for you and I it's the standard of
[1:02:28] the hour that has called us to the
[1:02:29] standard that the word would be made
[1:02:31] flesh in US
[1:02:33] that's the standard of the word
[1:02:38] so this thought here
[1:02:40] you know I said just a couple weeks ago
[1:02:43] on a Sunday service that we were
[1:02:44] speaking on we've been speaking on the
[1:02:46] power of the word and I just it just was
[1:02:48] all I remember is back in here and it
[1:02:50] this thought just so struck my heart
[1:02:53] of I just was so overwhelmed the
[1:02:56] presence of the Lord of that the reality
[1:02:58] of this message has opened and revealed
[1:03:01] to us the path of life
[1:03:05] I I just I was overwhelmed here in in
[1:03:08] that moment in the in the part of the
[1:03:10] after service after praying because God
[1:03:12] promised that he would send to us the
[1:03:15] spirit of truth how many knows the Holy
[1:03:17] Ghost has called the spirit of Truth
[1:03:19] it's a spirit of Truth
[1:03:21] to lead and guide us and that he would
[1:03:23] make himself known the way that he
[1:03:25] always has how does he make himself
[1:03:27] known by vindicating his word making his
[1:03:30] word live because he's the only one can
[1:03:32] that can do that and this is this is the
[1:03:34] blessing within it we are delivered from
[1:03:38] confusion
[1:03:41] you know what confusion is the very word
[1:03:44] of that Babel
[1:03:46] Babylon
[1:03:48] the Bible calls it mystery Babylon right
[1:03:51] now
[1:03:51] her religion is spread throughout all
[1:03:53] the Earth is confusion
[1:03:56] it started look look how it starts so
[1:03:58] innocency it starts so innocency
[1:03:59] remember my brother Brian will say well
[1:04:01] we talk about juvenile delinquency but
[1:04:03] see it traces on our back brother
[1:04:04] answered well you couldn't have juvenile
[1:04:05] delinquency without parent delinquency
[1:04:07] and you can't have the parent
[1:04:08] delinquency without Pulpit delinquency
[1:04:10] amen see it all comes back to our lives
[1:04:12] we're meant to be under the leadership
[1:04:14] of the word of God
[1:04:16] that's the blessing i that's the
[1:04:18] blessing the word of God has all that we
[1:04:21] have needed but I'm talking about the
[1:04:22] person of Jesus Christ and to see that
[1:04:25] how the within that look where it's got
[1:04:27] to in the time and the age that we are
[1:04:30] in right now
[1:04:31] that people don't know what they are
[1:04:34] but do you understand that confusion
[1:04:36] started when things started telling
[1:04:38] people that shaking hands is the new
[1:04:40] birth
[1:04:41] well just accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:04:44] savior you're born again you see these
[1:04:46] starts things like that we want how did
[1:04:47] he get this it starts as little seeds
[1:04:49] things start drifting and drifting
[1:04:51] drifting drifting when it brings
[1:04:52] confusion I've sent and talked to her
[1:04:55] with their you know been relatives that
[1:04:57] here they are were uh people and
[1:04:59] prominent people within their
[1:05:01] organization and they can't understand
[1:05:02] because they saw another person here uh
[1:05:06] that was married to one of their
[1:05:08] children well he spoke in tongues and I
[1:05:10] mean you know see they're stuck on that
[1:05:12] evidence where you speak in tongues
[1:05:13] you've got the Holy Ghost and they're
[1:05:15] stuck I've seen him speak in tongues and
[1:05:16] I don't know how I could go and do this
[1:05:18] I don't know so there's questions that
[1:05:20] rise why because they realize they're
[1:05:22] holding to this but that's not grounded
[1:05:25] upon the word of God
[1:05:27] I tell you that when I look at things
[1:05:29] like that it don't cause me to look down
[1:05:31] on people it cost me to want to go in a
[1:05:33] corner and cry and say thank you Lord
[1:05:35] for your mercy because who am I am
[1:05:39] en who am I
[1:05:40] right see God's you see what God's
[1:05:42] desire the reason this message come is
[1:05:45] to Deliver Us from confusion
[1:05:48] you and I could walk
[1:05:50] every day with an assurance
[1:05:52] like job that no matter what accusations
[1:05:55] come around us we've got an assurance
[1:05:56] I've met God's requirements I don't care
[1:05:59] who says what I don't care what comes in
[1:06:01] my body I don't care what comes around
[1:06:02] it I know I've met the requirements
[1:06:07] well thank God for that deliverance from
[1:06:09] confusion where we can know where we're
[1:06:11] standing we know where we're at
[1:06:14] you know how it is if anybody's ever
[1:06:16] called you you know
[1:06:18] saying if anybody's ever called you and
[1:06:19] said Shane I'm lost first question
[1:06:22] you're going to ask hey where are you at
[1:06:23] right now I don't know
[1:06:25] it's kind of hard to help them right I
[1:06:27] mean I know we got GPS and things now
[1:06:29] but you know you got to watch GPS I've
[1:06:31] it's taken me in places
[1:06:33] in a city that uh there was not a was
[1:06:36] not a hospital and they told me I wanted
[1:06:37] to go to a hospital and I showed up in
[1:06:39] somebody's driveway
[1:06:40] or help me get out of here quick because
[1:06:42] I realize where I'm at I'm watching a
[1:06:43] GPS and I realize where I'm at hey I'm
[1:06:45] not in the right place
[1:06:47] it's not a good place to be in but you
[1:06:49] know what somebody got to know where
[1:06:50] they're at right
[1:06:52] before you know we can say this is where
[1:06:54] you're going this is where we need it
[1:06:55] but you need to know where you're at if
[1:06:57] you know where you're at then you know
[1:06:58] where you need to go then you just
[1:07:00] follow and you move in that pathway you
[1:07:02] move in that direction God's provided
[1:07:05] leadership for us within this moment so
[1:07:08] think about how almighty God he
[1:07:10] orchestrates everything to serve his
[1:07:12] purpose and to fulfill his word and all
[1:07:15] things have to be in position think
[1:07:17] about this with
[1:07:19] with with Mary and Joseph
[1:07:22] going back into this moment they
[1:07:26] it was necessary that the baby
[1:07:30] that here the coming he would be born in
[1:07:33] Bethlehem
[1:07:36] God knows how to get us in position
[1:07:43] brother Brown tells us that Joseph no
[1:07:45] different from us he's kind of grumbling
[1:07:48] about the tax situation
[1:07:50] on the way down nice out of visitation
[1:07:52] but he's kind of grumbling on the way
[1:07:53] down I mean because who wouldn't you
[1:07:54] have to load up
[1:07:56] you have to pack up yeah and then your
[1:07:58] wife any moment is due
[1:08:02] right sure I mean it just you know all
[1:08:05] everything so he's kind of grumbling I
[1:08:07] love how the prophet had dramatized that
[1:08:09] you know it brings what it does you know
[1:08:10] the one thing about it does it does
[1:08:12] God's Not interested in trying to hide
[1:08:13] Humanity he just makes known that my
[1:08:16] grace is sufficient and is greater than
[1:08:17] your Humanity
[1:08:19] God's not ashamed of that this this is
[1:08:21] that's why brother Brian could say this
[1:08:22] is not the book of man it's the book of
[1:08:24] Prophecy it's God's book God God don't
[1:08:27] take out things that aren't so glorious
[1:08:28] but God leaves those things in there if
[1:08:30] he was like oh how could David do it oh
[1:08:32] how could but God leaves that in there
[1:08:33] and God says I want to show you that
[1:08:34] there's no situation that's beyond
[1:08:36] Redemption
[1:08:39] praise the Lord
[1:08:41] glory be to God I'm having a good time
[1:08:43] how about you
[1:08:48] did by going to come into place and to
[1:08:50] think how Paul Paul if I just refer to
[1:08:53] this just just a moment here Paul speaks
[1:08:56] of how what God has given to him how
[1:08:59] many remember where Paul will speak
[1:09:01] about the mystery of God that's been
[1:09:03] committed to him Paul speaks about the
[1:09:05] ministry that's been committed to him
[1:09:07] the purpose is that we would fulfill the
[1:09:10] word of God
[1:09:11] that's that's the the this word has been
[1:09:14] delivered and Paul would say in
[1:09:16] regarding that and that whole purpose is
[1:09:19] that it would be Christ in us the hope
[1:09:21] of glory and that's what you and I this
[1:09:24] is what we're guided to this is why God
[1:09:27] provides the guide of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:30] and he works through faithful guides
[1:09:33] that are able to step aside that he
[1:09:37] might reflect his life
[1:09:40] to direct us to that rightful place of
[1:09:42] the word made flesh in our lives
[1:09:45] let me just let me move on here into
[1:09:48] into this place here
[1:09:50] you see there was no answer perhaps
[1:09:52] we'll come to that here in just in some
[1:09:55] time here
[1:09:56] there was no answer in Jerusalem when
[1:09:58] they got there no answer at all they
[1:10:00] knew that written word but they did not
[1:10:03] recognize the sign in the visitation
[1:10:06] what you think about these wise men
[1:10:10] when we look at the wise men here they
[1:10:13] were making a journey they had studied
[1:10:16] they had studied with these Stars they
[1:10:19] they studied this and they knew there
[1:10:21] was going to be a crossing that you
[1:10:23] think of it how men have tried to say oh
[1:10:26] that's just a natural occurrence but God
[1:10:29] orchestrated those heavenly bodies to
[1:10:32] come in line at a specific time
[1:10:35] these minutes studied this but this star
[1:10:39] was not just some ordinary star
[1:10:42] this was that same Pillar of Fire
[1:10:46] that led the children of Israel
[1:10:49] it was the same almighty God think of it
[1:10:52] it's a phenomenon that here they are
[1:10:55] that that is being seen and here it is
[1:10:58] it's standing out it's unusual
[1:11:01] but here's the thing
[1:11:03] these men
[1:11:05] remembered there was a prophet down here
[1:11:08] when Israel was in Exile by the name of
[1:11:11] Daniel
[1:11:13] you see sometimes we wonder why we're in
[1:11:16] certain situations it might just be to
[1:11:19] drop a word for God to quicken in a
[1:11:20] certain season sometimes we become we
[1:11:23] become despondent because we think well
[1:11:25] it doesn't seem like they're taking the
[1:11:27] word maybe God's called you to drop that
[1:11:29] word right there at that moment just
[1:11:31] just trust God God doesn't sow his word
[1:11:34] in vain
[1:11:35] the word will be quickened in the right
[1:11:37] season these men were directed back to
[1:11:40] those writings where Daniel led by the
[1:11:43] spirit of God could reach back and pull
[1:11:45] out that of balaam's Prophecy Balaam was
[1:11:48] a false prophet but notice the spirit of
[1:11:51] Truth is able to catch truth that was
[1:11:54] spoken there that a star shall arise out
[1:11:58] of Jacob a scepter shall arise out of
[1:12:01] Judah the spirit of Truth was able to
[1:12:03] reach back and Pull and identify that
[1:12:06] and they could see that and know this is
[1:12:09] what was prophesied let me just say this
[1:12:11] to you it was something that just
[1:12:14] gripped their hearts
[1:12:17] they couldn't explain it no more than
[1:12:20] you can explain it
[1:12:22] when it just starts taking a hold of
[1:12:24] your heart and it's moving and it's
[1:12:26] directing it here they start packing up
[1:12:28] notice
[1:12:29] the Bible says in verse 9 of Matthew 2
[1:12:32] when they had heard the king
[1:12:34] they departed and lo the star which they
[1:12:37] saw in the east
[1:12:39] went before them
[1:12:41] till it came and stood over where the
[1:12:43] young child was and once you notice what
[1:12:45] star they had been following all along
[1:12:47] the guide now
[1:12:50] when they leave out of Jerusalem
[1:12:53] as soon as they get out of Jerusalem
[1:12:55] here they see the star once again
[1:13:00] Simon what are you saying I'm saying
[1:13:02] that there's a lot of things that look
[1:13:04] when God's dealing these these men were
[1:13:06] on a journey there's a lot of things
[1:13:08] that can come your way to try to dim the
[1:13:10] light
[1:13:11] Brothers I mean what should I do if
[1:13:13] there's anything that gets between you
[1:13:15] and that light it's the world get it out
[1:13:18] of the way
[1:13:20] anything that gets between that remember
[1:13:23] when the earth gets between the Moon and
[1:13:25] the Sun it brings an eclipse
[1:13:28] so when the world gets between you and
[1:13:30] the son
[1:13:32] the world brings its shadow what is the
[1:13:34] shadow Gloom Darkness doubt and it
[1:13:39] starts it's just the world right so
[1:13:42] anything that is wanting to take away as
[1:13:45] though uh your journey was nothing no no
[1:13:48] they began that journey by a
[1:13:50] supernatural leading
[1:13:52] you've begun this journey by a
[1:13:55] supernatural leading and we've got a
[1:13:57] destiny it's all
[1:14:04] it's all die
[1:14:07] we shall be changed in a moment in a
[1:14:10] twinkling of an eye
[1:14:11] Hallelujah we've got a promise the Holy
[1:14:14] Ghost is a sure promise whatever that is
[1:14:17] to your heart this morning remember
[1:14:19] don't allow things to come between you
[1:14:22] and the star
[1:14:24] the leading of the Holy Spirit a lot of
[1:14:27] things going to want to come but
[1:14:28] remember what is it doing it leads them
[1:14:30] until it comes over to where the young
[1:14:33] child was it stands over the young child
[1:14:35] so the star is there to identify this is
[1:14:39] him who you are searching for this is
[1:14:42] him the sign was declaring he's on Earth
[1:14:45] and that sign they followed is what
[1:14:48] pointed to them this is him
[1:14:52] oh man it's all I can do to hold back
[1:14:55] and when they saw that star they
[1:14:58] rejoiced
[1:15:01] they rejoiced
[1:15:03] I just say it in this manner here nobody
[1:15:06] else saw that star
[1:15:08] brother Brandon would say it just
[1:15:09] perfectly like this and he would give us
[1:15:11] examples in the scriptures remember when
[1:15:14] Paul was on the road now you could take
[1:15:16] even go in the book of Acts and one
[1:15:18] place it'll say the men heard the voice
[1:15:20] and then none of them just says they
[1:15:21] didn't hear the voice then over here it
[1:15:23] says they saw the light and then it says
[1:15:24] they didn't see the light you say well
[1:15:26] that sounds like that's contradictory no
[1:15:28] not at all what it is it had no meaning
[1:15:30] to them
[1:15:32] it had no meaning to them
[1:15:35] it was just the light
[1:15:37] that's why brother random could say he
[1:15:40] said a person can get up and say bless
[1:15:42] God I saw the pillar found brother Brown
[1:15:44] says judge it by the life you leave
[1:15:45] after you've saw it
[1:15:47] see not just
[1:15:48] hold a pillar Oh Glory to God
[1:15:55] this month's testifying to those things
[1:15:58] and seeing it right here in the services
[1:16:00] and that's not something that's a new
[1:16:03] occurrence how we think God for coming
[1:16:05] but look God doesn't do that it's not
[1:16:07] for me that's for you
[1:16:10] that's for you and me
[1:16:11] right that's that's for us but see if
[1:16:14] I'm think about it nobody else saw it
[1:16:17] I mean when because when they came
[1:16:18] herod's herod's looking and thinking
[1:16:20] what are you talking about
[1:16:22] you talk to the scribes and friends what
[1:16:24] are you talking about a star
[1:16:25] they didn't see it remember when John
[1:16:28] the Baptist was baptizing nobody else
[1:16:31] saw the pillar of fire nobody else saw
[1:16:32] the dove coming down John saw it
[1:16:36] right because he was ortained to see it
[1:16:38] he was supposed to see it he had a place
[1:16:40] in the scripture and let me tell you
[1:16:42] something right now it wasn't your
[1:16:43] smarts or my smarts my intellector your
[1:16:45] intellect that figured this out this
[1:16:48] message is the grace of God that has
[1:16:50] come to you and I and Found You and I
[1:16:52] you see why do I believe it because you
[1:16:54] ordained to believe it
[1:16:56] you were wrote in the prophecy and you
[1:16:59] can't escape that you can't get away
[1:17:01] from that there can be things in your
[1:17:03] life that's trying to put out the life
[1:17:06] but there's something that can't be
[1:17:07] stopped and that's the desire that God
[1:17:10] has placed within your life for this
[1:17:14] word to be made flesh in you
[1:17:18] Hallelujah you ordained to see it
[1:17:20] blessed are your eyes
[1:17:23] let's see
[1:17:26] Hallelujah that's why brother Randall
[1:17:28] could say it like this when you're
[1:17:30] looking for it because the Magis were
[1:17:32] looking for it when you're ready to
[1:17:34] receive the real Christmas present the
[1:17:37] real Christmas gift God's Christ's gift
[1:17:40] the Holy Spirit you're looking for it
[1:17:45] I don't know about you I look for
[1:17:46] Christmas gifts
[1:17:52] oh brother Samuel saying oh I can pay
[1:17:54] you know I preach on these things I can
[1:17:56] load a bundle of quotes brother Branson
[1:17:58] I'm just like a kid on Christmas morning
[1:18:00] I can't wait to open my gift
[1:18:02] I'm not if you don't know that's okay
[1:18:04] but I just understand you see all that
[1:18:07] right there was only pointed to one
[1:18:08] thing
[1:18:10] God
[1:18:11] was going to come down
[1:18:13] and God
[1:18:15] was going to wrap himself
[1:18:17] oh it wouldn't be in beautiful tinsel
[1:18:21] as a matter of fact they'd look on that
[1:18:23] package and say
[1:18:25] people as a man despised and rejected oh
[1:18:30] they don't have beautiful bows on it but
[1:18:32] what was inside of that package
[1:18:35] Oh Glory what was in that package was a
[1:18:40] blood that could pay for every sin that
[1:18:42] it was also a life that can be released
[1:18:45] to bring Deliverance to bring release to
[1:18:47] bring healing to bring everything that
[1:18:49] you and I have needed it didn't look
[1:18:51] good on the outside but oh what was on
[1:18:53] the inside was Jehovah
[1:18:56] what a real Christmas present
[1:19:01] maybe God didn't wrap it so nice and
[1:19:04] neat like everybody else oh they get the
[1:19:06] corners folded and all that right there
[1:19:07] I appreciate all that just buy a bag but
[1:19:09] you don't understand god well how did
[1:19:12] God wrap it up he wrapped it up by his
[1:19:14] word every word upon word upon word
[1:19:18] everything well you didn't have to have
[1:19:20] scotch tape to hold it together it was
[1:19:22] held together by the leadership of the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost it was the Holy Spirit that
[1:19:26] was bringing this corner to this corner
[1:19:28] to this to this to this it was perfect
[1:19:31] what was it God identifying
[1:19:35] the word made flesh
[1:19:40] the woman at the well
[1:19:42] she saw it as the word may flesh
[1:19:44] brother Brian the same people in the
[1:19:46] temple saw him and said PLC Bob
[1:19:50] fortune teller
[1:19:54] well it looked like they had more
[1:19:56] credentials to recognize him
[1:19:59] God ain't looking at outward credentials
[1:20:02] it's that on the inside
[1:20:04] something that just reaches out I said I
[1:20:07] know that's God
[1:20:09] I know that's God
[1:20:11] oh he said
[1:20:13] you're looking for it you'll see it it's
[1:20:15] a Heavenly light sent down from God out
[1:20:18] of heaven
[1:20:20] to Bear record of Jesus Christ
[1:20:22] I think about this for two years they
[1:20:24] followed it
[1:20:28] two years
[1:20:29] we know that like I said with the
[1:20:31] scriptures
[1:20:32] why did God guide them mad jobs they
[1:20:34] were guided
[1:20:36] not by
[1:20:38] a GPS
[1:20:40] in one way it was I think it was brother
[1:20:42] Daryl Ward that mentioned that GPS God's
[1:20:44] positioning services
[1:20:47] I mean it was just
[1:20:49] yeah they were directed
[1:20:50] you know brother Brown dramatized he
[1:20:52] said they would sit down brother Shane
[1:20:53] he said they would sit down for the day
[1:20:55] they would in the daytime they would
[1:20:58] fellowship and oh man
[1:21:00] and it's so wonderful thank God for his
[1:21:03] grace he said at night
[1:21:05] here that star would be there he said
[1:21:06] they would just load back up and keep on
[1:21:09] heading down the way
[1:21:11] and they would have that Fellowship but
[1:21:13] why did God guide them why what was it
[1:21:16] that God made sure that they didn't get
[1:21:17] tangled up let me think about their
[1:21:19] Journey their Journey they could have
[1:21:20] been killed they were Bandits right I
[1:21:23] mean the bandits
[1:21:25] things everywhere I mean just like
[1:21:26] there's certain places in certain cities
[1:21:28] and certain cities in certain places in
[1:21:30] this city there's certain places you you
[1:21:32] know we know better than the goal right
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:35] right it's just like when I you know
[1:21:37] even when I went into Mexico you know as
[1:21:40] I talked to some brothers in the place I
[1:21:41] was going and said yeah you're good just
[1:21:42] make sure you you you're not gonna be
[1:21:44] going off by yourself you stay with the
[1:21:45] people you know that are there with you
[1:21:47] and bring you okay that's that's what I
[1:21:49] do and I made sure I did that
[1:21:53] but you see they have the right gifts
[1:21:56] they had the right gifts
[1:21:59] and look how let me I want to read this
[1:22:02] here this this statement that brother
[1:22:04] Branham has made here how that they
[1:22:07] have these right gifts can I have just a
[1:22:09] couple more minutes I'm doing good I'm
[1:22:11] doing good here I'm doing good
[1:22:14] my excitement Manhattan I'm doing good
[1:22:16] let me just drop these in that God
[1:22:18] guided the Magi because they had the
[1:22:20] right gifts
[1:22:23] I want you to think about your own life
[1:22:25] how why and how God has guided you
[1:22:28] God guided these wise men because they
[1:22:30] had the right identified gift
[1:22:33] to identify his son
[1:22:36] wise men today rise in the name of the
[1:22:40] Lord not with some fictitious something
[1:22:42] but with the gift that God promised for
[1:22:44] this day and God will guide you to
[1:22:47] identify that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:22:49] yesterday today and forever there you
[1:22:52] are wise men now remember in the
[1:22:55] scripture there's the parallel the wise
[1:22:56] and the foolish virgin right
[1:22:58] the wise version is that which took oil
[1:23:01] in her land the wise virgin was one that
[1:23:05] responded to the call
[1:23:08] she was one who was made ready
[1:23:11] and to think God guides these wise men
[1:23:14] because they had the right gifts
[1:23:16] to identify him
[1:23:19] in this day
[1:23:21] once you think of this brother Brown was
[1:23:22] picking this up and he goes very he goes
[1:23:25] very slowly within this message God's
[1:23:27] gifts always find their places and he's
[1:23:29] just stopping and he's he said I hope
[1:23:31] the church is getting it right now he
[1:23:32] said for this lady you'll see an age the
[1:23:35] gift is fitting for the age we're living
[1:23:38] in
[1:23:39] so you see God ordained the promise of
[1:23:43] Malachi 4. Luke 17 30. all of those
[1:23:47] promises you say oh that was about
[1:23:49] brother Branham no brother Branham
[1:23:51] happened to be the veil but those
[1:23:53] promises was for Jesus Christ to
[1:23:56] identify himself as the word made flesh
[1:23:59] that would call you and I
[1:24:02] into our rightful place
[1:24:04] remember why did God watch over these
[1:24:07] gifts remember brother Branham remember
[1:24:08] he was going to put his hand upon the
[1:24:11] wire
[1:24:12] when he's when his daughter and them had
[1:24:14] passed away
[1:24:15] it didn't work brother bam found himself
[1:24:17] on the ground I've said this before I
[1:24:19] said I wonder if anybody was driving by
[1:24:21] the power line that day and how they saw
[1:24:22] it because he didn't touch it but how he
[1:24:24] ended up on the ground
[1:24:27] well you say what you want brother REM
[1:24:28] never said this but brother Brown says I
[1:24:29] don't know how I got there but see how
[1:24:31] how God had a way of just placing his
[1:24:32] Prophet there on the ground why it
[1:24:34] wasn't time for him to go
[1:24:36] remember the gun we preached about that
[1:24:38] before the gun he lines it up boom
[1:24:42] and the doctor said I don't know how
[1:24:44] your head's still on your shoulders why
[1:24:46] because the gift had to fully identify
[1:24:50] Jesus Christ
[1:24:53] it's the purpose that's why when we look
[1:24:55] at the seventh seal the coming of the
[1:24:56] Lord remember it's the his coming in the
[1:24:59] fullness of his Spirit to make a people
[1:25:02] ready that his fullness would live
[1:25:04] inside of you and I
[1:25:06] that's that's the whole
[1:25:08] Simplicity of the seven seal it's Christ
[1:25:10] coming into his Temple coming into his
[1:25:12] body of Believers and that's why we're
[1:25:14] caught away from traditions of man
[1:25:17] were being caught away from
[1:25:20] we realize it's not a tradition It's A
[1:25:22] Love Affair it's a relationship
[1:25:24] so it's identified so think of this that
[1:25:27] gift that God provided was to do what to
[1:25:30] identify Jesus Christ think how brother
[1:25:33] Brown would tell us about John the
[1:25:34] Baptist remember he talked about how
[1:25:36] John he said you know God took John out
[1:25:39] in the wilderness he said what did John
[1:25:40] had stayed around in Jerusalem you know
[1:25:43] had the people coming up and say hey hey
[1:25:45] you know your daddy your daddy's got a
[1:25:47] position down there and you know you'd
[1:25:49] announce the Messiah
[1:25:51] brother so-and-so he's a good looking
[1:25:52] guy over there good stature guy man he's
[1:25:56] got all his p's and q's remember my
[1:25:57] brother Ram talks about that John would
[1:25:59] have all that you'd have people coming
[1:26:00] around and pressuring you you need to
[1:26:02] select this guy you need it but God knew
[1:26:04] what he was doing
[1:26:05] because God already knew God already
[1:26:08] provided for himself a lamb
[1:26:11] God knew when it was time to be
[1:26:13] identified
[1:26:14] and God moved John out to that place and
[1:26:17] here John he was in position to announce
[1:26:20] him it was the gift that was fitted for
[1:26:23] the age
[1:26:25] are you with me now
[1:26:27] that gift that was fitted for the age
[1:26:29] now you know what that means
[1:26:32] when that has come to you when it's come
[1:26:34] to me when you and I can see that word
[1:26:37] made flesh you know what that's about
[1:26:39] it's God letting you know
[1:26:42] I want to be I want to live in your
[1:26:43] flesh
[1:26:45] I want to live behind your flesh
[1:26:48] what you see on the platform dominion
[1:26:51] over every spirit
[1:26:52] I want to manifest that through your
[1:26:54] life
[1:26:55] I want that Victory to be made manifest
[1:26:58] or you're like remember we're guided to
[1:27:00] the word made flesh not when we get to
[1:27:03] where the word is made flesh we fall
[1:27:05] down as though to say oh this is this is
[1:27:08] it no we know what it's about the word
[1:27:10] is made flesh there it's God identifying
[1:27:14] I want to identify myself in your flesh
[1:27:19] it's the whole purpose that's the whole
[1:27:21] coming is
[1:27:27] don't get too big on that trigger finger
[1:27:28] just attached see this is why so think
[1:27:31] think think as we bring as I'm bringing
[1:27:33] this down here I've only got a couple
[1:27:34] minutes
[1:27:35] but how God brings us into this place
[1:27:39] God guided those gifts because they were
[1:27:42] the gifts to identify him God
[1:27:45] has guided you has guided me well
[1:27:48] somebody cut me off God guided you
[1:27:49] guided me for what because within your
[1:27:51] life
[1:27:53] within your life
[1:27:54] just like within my phone there's a
[1:27:57] little card in here you call me I've
[1:27:59] already I'm in the network
[1:28:01] you've got to have the number inside of
[1:28:03] there you call that number you send a
[1:28:05] text hey I'm going to get it I've got a
[1:28:06] device I'm connected I'm baptized into
[1:28:09] the body into the network I'm I'm
[1:28:10] activated
[1:28:12] you understand I'm activating my little
[1:28:14] that little SIM card that little thing
[1:28:15] that's so small it's it's activated I
[1:28:17] can send and receive messages
[1:28:21] right I can download Visions I'm in
[1:28:23] videos I can I can get into those realms
[1:28:27] all right
[1:28:29] that's how it is with you and I it's not
[1:28:31] about it's not that we put ourselves
[1:28:33] here
[1:28:34] we haven't made ourselves see this
[1:28:38] it's God In His Amazing Grace why has
[1:28:41] God guided your life why has God watched
[1:28:44] over your life and over my life you say
[1:28:46] brother Samuel I've been raised in a
[1:28:48] message church I was raised in a message
[1:28:50] home but why has God watched over our
[1:28:52] lives to bring us to this place because
[1:28:56] in our lives
[1:29:01] don't tell me I thought we were to
[1:29:03] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[1:29:05] gift of the Holy Ghost comes to the real
[1:29:07] gift that's from God
[1:29:08] things that are to be that real gift
[1:29:10] from God is your soul
[1:29:14] what is it it's God uniting with God
[1:29:19] what is it Emmanuel God With Us
[1:29:25] the purpose of his coming
[1:29:27] was so that his life
[1:29:30] could be rendered
[1:29:33] blood cell opened that the life itself
[1:29:36] could make its way could come to you and
[1:29:39] I and here we are standing in 2022 and
[1:29:42] the Holy Spirit coming right through the
[1:29:44] word in this hour vindicating himself to
[1:29:46] be the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:49] what does he do he guides us to the word
[1:29:52] made flesh we can look at that as we're
[1:29:55] hearing the message that's the same
[1:29:57] Jesus that's the same almighty God as
[1:30:00] the prophet could say oh he says can you
[1:30:02] get it now it's not I'm the son of man
[1:30:05] but I am a son of man revealing these
[1:30:09] son of man I'm not the one who has done
[1:30:11] these things I was only present when he
[1:30:14] did them
[1:30:16] what was it the word made flesh that was
[1:30:19] pointing and calling and drawing upon
[1:30:22] you and I and God sounding Out through
[1:30:25] this message that I want to be made
[1:30:29] flesh in your life
[1:30:32] you're the reason this message came
[1:30:34] you're the reason that I was born so you
[1:30:38] could be born again
[1:30:46] Hallelujah
[1:30:48] this is why God
[1:30:50] has guided you and I
[1:30:52] into this place and that's why brother
[1:30:54] Randall could say it just so simply like
[1:30:56] this he says if we can just look away
[1:30:59] wise men today he said just wanting to
[1:31:01] look away from all
[1:31:03] churchanity
[1:31:05] look away from just
[1:31:07] emptiness of Creeds emptiness and I
[1:31:12] I believe people are trying look God's
[1:31:14] going to have people that will stand in
[1:31:17] the tribulation they will come out of
[1:31:19] that system
[1:31:21] they'll have to they'll they'll have a
[1:31:22] choice in that time in the tribulation
[1:31:24] they're going to have a choice if they
[1:31:26] remain in that look the mark of the
[1:31:27] beast is going on already but if they
[1:31:29] remain in that and remember they're
[1:31:30] going to be pressures there's like
[1:31:32] pressures that comes right now
[1:31:34] and you can see all around people can
[1:31:36] cave to pressure that's why you must be
[1:31:38] pressurized now
[1:31:40] by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:42] the holy spirit is what helps you and I
[1:31:44] to withstand all the pressure
[1:31:47] of the world so the wise men today
[1:31:50] look away from church annity because
[1:31:52] it's emptiness I I don't want
[1:31:55] I don't want emptiness
[1:31:57] that's not what God promised God
[1:31:58] promised a real filling
[1:32:01] but the same word today to think there's
[1:32:03] a longing there's a DEET that calls it
[1:32:05] deep let me say this to you
[1:32:07] we are blessed
[1:32:10] to hunger and thirst
[1:32:12] after righteousness
[1:32:16] you're blessed
[1:32:18] you're blessed to have a hunger in your
[1:32:20] life
[1:32:21] a desire that says Lord
[1:32:24] be glorified in this Temple
[1:32:28] but the same sometimes it just seems
[1:32:30] like I maybe sometimes I feel like I'm
[1:32:31] going Beyond Myself no no wait let's
[1:32:34] just put that in perspective you know
[1:32:35] what that is that's a groaning within
[1:32:37] you
[1:32:38] because new life has come in
[1:32:41] and it's a desire Lord
[1:32:43] be glorified in this Temple Lord
[1:32:47] what is it it's the Zeal of the Lord
[1:32:49] moving in your life
[1:32:52] let me close
[1:32:54] as soon as they left the star come back
[1:32:56] on
[1:32:58] Abraham says when we're willing to lay
[1:33:00] aside all those other things he said
[1:33:02] then we can say
[1:33:04] I think this is this to me is so fitting
[1:33:06] these are these are words to take
[1:33:10] Lord Jesus guide me to that perfect
[1:33:12] light
[1:33:14] if we just say that just think listen
[1:33:16] how many believe this is a Vindicated
[1:33:19] word how many know that to be the truth
[1:33:21] let me just read this to you
[1:33:23] say Lord Jesus guide me to that perfect
[1:33:27] light and watch something Supernatural
[1:33:31] happen the holy spirit will come in a
[1:33:35] phenomenal way
[1:33:37] let's say I can't figure it out you
[1:33:39] don't have to
[1:33:40] say Lord Jesus guide me to that Perfect
[1:33:43] Light what's that perfect light
[1:33:46] what's that perfect light
[1:33:48] is him
[1:33:50] he's the light
[1:33:51] that lighteth all men
[1:33:53] right
[1:33:54] Song of Solomon describes the the bride
[1:33:57] the bride she has she comes in
[1:34:00] and what happens her light continues to
[1:34:03] shine it's in the morning but then it
[1:34:05] continues to shine brighter and brighter
[1:34:07] through the day that's the same way with
[1:34:08] your walk with God
[1:34:10] it gets brighter and brighter and
[1:34:13] brighter
[1:34:15] so follow the supernatural the Heavenly
[1:34:17] sign and they followed that sign until
[1:34:22] the word was made flesh they saw
[1:34:24] the young child
[1:34:26] standing there
[1:34:29] they didn't see a baby these wise men
[1:34:32] they saw the young child
[1:34:36] here they were on that Journey
[1:34:38] and that star
[1:34:40] they didn't keep on saying oh star where
[1:34:43] they realized they knew what that star
[1:34:45] was about that star was guiding them to
[1:34:47] the word made flesh
[1:34:49] we've seen the sign now where's he at
[1:34:53] they knew
[1:34:54] where's he at so they weren't looking
[1:34:57] for another star to arise
[1:34:59] they knew the star served its purpose
[1:35:02] it's led me to the word made flesh it's
[1:35:05] led me for what my soul has been longing
[1:35:09] for
[1:35:10] glory be to God that's why in The Book
[1:35:13] of Revelations when John is standing
[1:35:16] there and John has given a personal tour
[1:35:19] by that prophet
[1:35:21] John falls down to worship him in the
[1:35:23] prophecies see thou doest did not
[1:35:28] you're not to present your life to me
[1:35:29] you present it to the one who's
[1:35:31] reflected through me

[1:36:24] that God that
[1:36:26] in their Journey Lord
[1:36:29] maybe I think the Lord could they could

[1:37:22] maybe Lord others of us Lord that has
[1:37:25] come to that place
[1:37:28] but yet we're still on a journey
[1:37:30] we don't stop until we're back home
[1:37:34] so Lord no matter where we're at
[1:37:37] may we recognize Lord that just like
[1:37:39] when the wise men came into Jerusalem
[1:37:41] they came to a place that they thought
[1:37:44] could help them
[1:37:46] but you're the one who had been guiding
[1:37:48] them all along
[1:37:50] as soon as they departed they saw the
[1:37:53] star that had led them
[1:37:55] safely thus far
[1:37:57] they begin to rejoice and Lord
[1:38:00] you're the same God that if Darkness if
[1:38:04] the world
[1:38:06] if Gloom if doubt
[1:38:08] friends oh Lord all those things that I
[1:38:12] know that you're able to discern and go
[1:38:14] right through very personally in our
[1:38:15] lives if there's been anything Lord
[1:38:18] that's crowded out or tried to take that
[1:38:20] out of our Lives Lord May right here
[1:38:23] this morning we depart from that Lord
[1:38:27] turn from it
[1:38:29] and Lord look to you the one who has
[1:38:31] guided me safely thus far
[1:38:34] to take me safely home
[1:38:38] granted Lord

[1:38:42] will be changed in a moment in a
[1:38:45] twinkling of an eye thank you Father for
[1:38:47] this day
[1:38:48] thank you Lord for providing your word
[1:38:50] to guide us into this precious place of
[1:38:53] where the word is made flesh
[1:38:56] in our lives Lord

[1:39:01] Lord coming thank you for the Simplicity
[1:39:04] thank you for the humility Lord how did
[1:39:07] it bypass all of the minds of the
[1:39:10] theologians Lord they were looking for a
[1:39:12] general they were looking for someone to
[1:39:15] Stamp Out the Roman army but you gave
[1:39:17] him just what they needed you gave him a
[1:39:20] baby
[1:39:21] they needed a baby and Lord in our lives
[1:39:24] we can look for a lot of other things
[1:39:26] but what we need
[1:39:28] is a birth
[1:39:30] that birth Lord is what is the
[1:39:34] Conquering power in our lives
[1:39:37] we thank you Father for your mercy now
[1:39:40] Lord as we just draw strength from you
[1:39:42] may we lord

[1:39:49] we love you and we thank you Father
[1:39:51] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:39:55] won't you love him
[1:39:58] you might say brother Sammy you didn't
[1:39:59] get to where they presented the gifts
[1:40:01] well I thought I was but he told me back
[1:40:03] they're different and it proved out
[1:40:07] so we got some time to go here
[1:40:09] but you know
[1:40:10] the message like this you know brother
[1:40:12] Brian we can preach this in July right
[1:40:14] sure I know how I use the month July you
[1:40:16] get people say Christmas in July you
[1:40:18] know wrong choice of a month right
[1:40:22] but truth truth is it not true
[1:40:24] the whole purpose it doesn't change
[1:40:27] the whole purpose God coming down
[1:40:30] and becoming one of us
[1:40:33] he came that he might know what the
[1:40:35] struggles of a teenager are right that
[1:40:38] he might know what it is to go through
[1:40:40] all those pressures
[1:40:42] that he might know what it is as a man
[1:40:45] and when I say man I talk to you about a
[1:40:47] mankind
[1:40:48] he would know
[1:40:50] he could be the right kind of a mediator
[1:40:53] for you and I
[1:40:55] and that most of all that through that
[1:40:57] he could pay the price
[1:40:59] and he could send the holy spirit that
[1:41:02] same life that brought forth that
[1:41:04] creation and send that into you and I
[1:41:07] and we become a new creation
[1:41:09] where you've got ground to stand on and
[1:41:12] say
[1:41:13] I know who I am
[1:41:15] I know what God's Grace has done for me
[1:41:18] I know I'm not the same person that I
[1:41:20] used to be God has changed my life
[1:41:23] something has happened that I can't
[1:41:25] explain it well what happened something
