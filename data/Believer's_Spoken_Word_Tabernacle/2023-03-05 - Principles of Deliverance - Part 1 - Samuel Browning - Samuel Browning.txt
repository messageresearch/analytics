hallelujah let's give him a hand clap of Praise this morning hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah man amen don't you love the Lord amen I I just appreciate amen every one of those songs the specials amen the words that were were mentioned and um you have to forgive me but you know when I hear Brother David I was sitting back there and I just was kind of just kind of chuckling into my heart and and my spirit because um well you don't have to guess what's on his mind and you don't have to guess where he stands and you know there's all there's all we have all those parts within the kingdom of God and you know I I couldn't help but think about it and I hope this all right brother David but I helped I couldn't help but think you know because brother Branham caught it when he was preaching that there were some people who when brother Wayne brother Ben Bryant was was carrying on me stopped in that service he said wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait he said if you knew what God delivered that man from what God delivered that man from you know when you you listen to the message of the hour brother Brandon points that out he said this is why he said brother Ben Brian and brother Ben was brother Ben you know I've heard some stories you know and uh and what a what a what a what a deliverance and I think we all have in our own way you know we're not all we're not all the same we don't all worship the same way grateful for that God's a god of variety you know and that's how God made us in that way and uh you know it's just like uh in myself when when I played football you know I had different ones that kind of some guys that already graduating you'd get around them after the game and stuff so I didn't really want to be around them but you know you get around them and then you know hear the replay of the game would be on we're sitting around and you know they want to poke fun at me and think ah Browning always hugging everybody you know and well it didn't matter if I made the tackle or not it didn't matter if I'm the one who scored the touchdown or not I mean hey I was glad that we scored I was glad when the ball carrier got tackled now that's just me I know not everybody else but that's just me and you know what God didn't change that when he saved me I'm still grateful and I Delight in to see God working in his people now I had other teammates they weren't like that at all you know uh but we were still teammates we still had the same goal and I I just you know I love the Lord and you know I maybe have a kind of a peculiar way of showing it and so forth and maybe you do too but you know I I said it like this let's just fall in love with Jesus and let's just have a good old time amen Jesus I want to enjoy Jesus amen and you know it's just like when we eat uh well I keep going we eat pie and cake and some people might like sitting at the table and after dinner to do it I like getting in my recliner and bring that bowl of apple crisp over there with the coffee and let me just sit down you know over there you might say brother Samuel that's not real spiritual I know but there's some things that when I mention this you'll understand there's differences and God has designed it in that way he's designed it that way I keep on that keeps on spilling over from things eventually we'll preach that but I just it's just so so powerful you know um I want to say as we get ready to look into the word of the Lord I just want to say I love you it's so good to be with you um and I mean that with all my heart it's just a it's a real treasure I look forward to seeing you and being with you because one of these days amen we're going to be together amen we're gonna we're gonna set together and I'm counting on that amen and I don't know how it all is going to get and everything that God's gonna make it all I don't know how he's going to make it all happen but I know it'll be him I know it'll be him that's one thing for sure it will be indeed the grace of God so I also want to make mention to you yeah a little little Aaron and and you know you'll probably be 50 years old of God Parents and I'll still be calling you little Aaron and you might actually be bigger than your daddy at some point in time but I'm just so thankful for what God has moved upon in a little Aaron's heart and um you know I might be a little Aaron been making a big decision yeah amen so we just really appreciate that and how God has just been dealing with his heart and I really appreciate that and just to encourage that and and you know here we are I tell you you can look around this room right here we you've got some cheerleaders you got some people pulling for you amen you got evidence you got witnesses around amen well also remember the upcoming event of the Christian family there at the end of the month and if there's anything you need to get with me or any changes or anything like that you can see see me text me or or whatever so that's all really kind of coming together and we just thank God for that looking forward to it and let's just be in prayer for what God's going to do because I I just believe God's going to do some wonderful things in these in these moments that we have together uh I told you today that I was going to send you show you a picture of brother Joshua and sister Sharon but I I just didn't get time to clip those things off of my phone because some of the photo the photos he sent me it just uh I need to kind of box them in and I hadn't even gotten to my wife and really who's going to want to see him let's be honest man who's going to want to see him the sisters [Laughter] so we'll get them out there you know and uh I tell you they're just a beautiful couple and uh we're just certainly looking forward to them and like I said I spoke to them on Monday on the phone and we're just greeting one another and talking with both of them and so um you know just continue to keep them in prayer for the whole process of her getting over here because brother Joshua will come back in the middle of March and everything the way they've kind of planned the timeline is uh that everything should kind of be making its way by that month but you know how the government is I don't mean to make No Slam but there's no efficiency in the government you know like when they talk about the government handling this well it's not a good track record but you know I I think when brother this is what I thought of when uh you remember when brother Benny Perry was here in not in May but you remember when brother Benny spoke here last January and brother Benny said something in that service when he was testifying he's talking about inspiration dropping and he gave a testimony of how that there was an individual that needed papers processed and God processed them papers in record time true now those are things that even from last January of 2022 we were praying about let's just keep and keep that in prayer would you do that amen for sister Sharon Amen to be able to be here um so uh we want to keep that big smile on brother Joshua's face amen you love the Lord amen amen well God bless you musicians thank you this morning and we want to just look into the word of the Lord and Deuteronomy chapter 2 and I just want to begin there this morning and we'll just see I don't know how where we'll get to on this I would love to bring all these parts out today but I'm not I don't want to rush anything either and so I just want to be mindful of him so would you just be praying with me as I'm ministering and say God just just you know let us give us the direction on this here so on a Deuteronomy 2 and verse 2. and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward I want to just read that again the Lord spake unto me saying can we say that personally unto me personally yea have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward now there's a lot of things that you and I we can go right we could go down through maybe a list or there's just something that maybe presses on your heart whatever the need is if it's for the holy spirit it's for deliverance or salvation for healing whatever that it might be if we can just we come into that place and say it's long enough it's long enough and that God and it's not us working this is God giving a declaration to our hearts it's long enough and so I want to just hear speak this morning and you'll see as I go into this here just a little bit but I want to speak on principles of Deliverance principles of Deliverance may God bless you bless the reading of the word are we are can we give can you give it to me up here I pardon me just a second here we'll just can we can we go here can I can is it ready on here right now can I get my file in here in Maya there's a mile well you love technology don't you a few seconds and we'll fire him laughs if it's not working it's all right it should be able to Ben can't you air drop it to the computer over there just get it just get it pulled up on there he should be able to airdrop it it's okay I got I got a good corn here that's okay Ben should be able to air drop it so verse three go ahead and get the screens back up please verse three and what I wanted to show you was I wanted to show you just a map that I had laid out of the journey where Israel had taken coming into the promised land and you realize that they were only a few days from crossing over few fully but because of unbelief there were 40 years in Journey but even in the midst of 40 years a believer is a believer is a Believer is a Believer is a believer and you say what are you saying when that time was up Caleb rose up at that moment and he says it's time to go the 40 years did not take out of Caleb's heart what God had put in his heart so it doesn't I want to just say it in this manner and I'm being very intentional with this so whatever the past was it's the past that's where Paul said I have learned to forget those things that are behind me the Branham in one place in the message I never forget when he's speaking and he comes to the end of the service and he says if in your walk he says like Moses where Moses went and then he failed he said if it has been it it has been he said a failure let that be a has been and start from tonight is that right this is the grace of God that's given to us because to Compass something is just where we to go around it and just keep going around and we realize it that in this that we God has called us to get into the word of God and that we're not just going to pass by the same mile post and same markers over and over and God's grace God wants a a full work and full deliverance and God wants there's more that God has for us Amen to a Believer a Believer uh as brother Brown places it this way a Believer presses on to Perfection that's what a Believer does they they press on there's a pressing that goes on in our life and you can as a Believer you can never be satisfied outside of a full surrender and you can never be satisfied even when there's been a full surrender you can never be satisfied out of fully and continually walking and dedicating and devoting your life to God there's a lot of other things that you can try to and sometimes there's traps to try to occupy our Zeal and listen Satan knows us he studies us if you knew the case File he had on you it'd probably scare you come on now I'm preaching right from the word of God he studies us and he looks at everything in his desire is to try to impede slow down stop hinder the working of God in our life so he'll he'll place things and he'll try to channel our lives but you know that's why there's nothing satisfying outside of full surrender in every moment serving the lord and there's nothing that will satisfy that and so the direction itself for us as Believers is there's the direction is always to be going forward uh never to be standing still or to even go back because let me say this wherever your eyes are set is the direction you'll go and that's why Satan wants to try to he'll try to distract with a lot of other things and brother Branham put it just like this in the message he said when as God's dealing with your life and he says how that there's things then it'll start coming your way and he said it's things where the enemy will present this and he'll present that like he presented for a lot hey you can have a better life for your family down here in Sodom and so you know a lot lot just was you know he knew enough that I I can't go down there but all he had to do was is turn his tent door to face Sodom and he yielded to that and eventually the entrance or what began to come into His tent eventually his tent was down in Sodom so it's what we give ourselves to because whatever we give ourselves to we will become and that's why it's very important that within everything and Paul dealt with that on our thinking and what we give ourselves to and I want to say it in this manner that is it's always to be going forward with God and even how God would talk to Moses and he wouldn't tell Moses even when they had journeyed to Mount Horeb and you remember they journeyed to Mount Horeb this was after the Red Sea and it came a time after they were on Mountain Horeb that God LED Moses know it's time to go from Mount Horeb all the way and God let him know and this is the one thing you can always you always can catch and always know that God he has a timing your I can't get ahead of God's timing for our own lives or even for the lives of others uh I'm saying like this even as the pastor of disassembly there can be things that that I want to see but it's the burden that God puts on my heart but God knows the timing sometimes in the way and God has that that brother Brian lays down clearly in the church age book is the timing the time is in hand God has a timing so when we're looking at that what we what we must do is operate under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit at that moment because it's God that'll bring everything in place we talk about the vision where the handkerchief had to be here this person here this person here that was only a picture to show what the holy spirit will do in our lives with getting our heart lined up and in the right place for God to move so when we look at this I want to just I want to just say it like this there's a deep resolve and I trust I there is a deep resolve in our hearts in this hour and that deep resolve that would be there is that this is not we are not in a in a point of a so far religion I'm gonna go ahead and go on oh they've got it up there gets better late than never you can't see this back there and if you need it we'll send it to you there's many pictures of it but I like this one because some of those things are too busy for me but when you wow this is out you can see the red the red line and the red journey I mean here they are all this time and when God said it's time to turn northward the direction that God was given was an indication it's time to turn northward it's time to go to the mountain of the amorites it's time to cross this is after the 40 years it's time to cross now going back to my slides for me I'm done with that please so here we are in a resolve this is where the resolve and I think this is where every one of us not only should be but I believe that would be and and should be continuously in our lives that we are not in a just so far walk because when we only walk if we fail to walk daily with him brother laid it out clearly says we take an organizational life so it's a daily walk with almighty God when remember when when Moses was presented by Pharaoh Pharaoh got to a place with uh with uh with Moses here here where the word is coming and Pharaoh said if you guys want to go ahead and you want that kind of religion you want to worship that way then I tell you what you older people you guys go ahead and worship she's trying to make a deal for it for something part way or halfway but Moses had a resolve in his life that we're not going to have a just so far religion you know why because Moses had had an experience that went beyond a just so far experience he was now here he was it was not only was he in the presence of the burning bush but the same God that had come down there and drawn him was now veiled in Moses life and Moses knew the liberty and the Victory of being of being drawn Beyond and Beyond a just so far experience remember the deals that they wanted to make I just leave your children here and you know you guys can go ahead and go and and all this right here the devil's all about trying to make deals [Music] amen but I'm going to tell you this here you'll never get anywhere with making a deal or sitting down on a peace table with the Devil you'll never get anywhere you've got to make a decision every day every moment Moses made the decision and said we're not leaving hoof behind not only are our children not brother Sammy you don't know where my children are at let it be a declaration it's not a so far religion it's all the way God promised me that I and my offspring would be there he said believe and thy in thy house shall be said that is a promise that God has made I'm not a so far Christian I'm an all the way kind of guy yeah you know why Moses didn't believe in us so far let me let me read a statement to you I don't have this on the board but Moses is faith was not a so far faith you know why because his faith it now was not Moses's Faith his faith had been anointed by the same God who veiled himself there on the mountain and that same God told Moses you're going to bring him out and you're going to come back and worship me on this mountain what was God saying the same experience I've given you as the messenger is the same experience that I'm bringing the rest of the people to in this Exodus it's not a just so far times we can be it very comfortable with things but uh just so far well you know I've I'm doing pretty good and uh you know I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we press on if we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible said that's the earnest hello somebody it's a desire I'm pressing on to what to in my father's house or many mansions I have got a mansion over and under I've got a body Over Yonder and there are cities to take down in this land there are strongholds to be pulled down there are battles to be won there's character to be molded there ain't no time to sit down it's time the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the time of overcoming it's a time of operating by the power and authority of almighty God moving through Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah it's not a time of compromising it's a time to take everything that God has said in his word that's why when Moses stood there and looked at the opposition God said speak the word that the people go forward how am I going to get through this speak the word crying about this crying about that you know when brother Brandon preaches why Christ speak he comes even throughout that message and he comes to the end of it he said I need to repent because he realized here's an opposition and God was pointing him back to the same thing that has brought you this far the word Will Make A Way you don't get anything you see what the enemy has always wanted to do if the church is not going how we think it should or our family or this and that and we want to deviate other means you can't go any other way and expect Victory there is no other course of Victory than through the word speak the word that they go forward the Bible said in Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us I want you to catch that a moment let us lay it aside there is Authority there is there is Grace that is present and Authority in your life to lay it aside [Music] brother Branham stands there in the message the deity of Jesus Christ and hold the Holy Spirit takes that maybe I mean listen a message in a while it'd be good to listen to it because he's he puts it in mind in this manner he said it is in you to live above sin amen it is in you to overcome because the Holy Ghost comes to raise up Sons and Daughters of God there's an authority don't the devil is a liar you know the reason that spooky feeling wants to come around it ain't you that's the devil amen amen it's a spirit that's afraid of being exposed there you go let's just put it on notice of what it is it ain't you it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit is calling him out and God's given you an authority listen I'm gonna tell you this you don't even have to wait to the end of the service to lay something aside it can take place right while the words going forth if you come at the end of the service so be it there ain't nothing wrong there ain't more faith either way it's that you know what I'm going all the way all right yes how are we supposed to run it looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and despising the shame aren't you glad for that and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God now this is where I want to get to here um for it's my fault in the text here this morning these are some things that I'm just going to say how God pressed it on my heart here just a few weeks ago but has been really for a few years it's just things that I've just and sometimes when you're studying things they it's just like a pot boiling it spills over into things because it influences everything even as you're studying and you're looking at it and these are some things that if you uh look in the time of July of 63 brother Branham is going through uh some things there in July of 63 and he works uh into that of August of 63 and I'm saying this to you for a purpose if you have an opportunity and through the work or through the week begin to listen to those messages beginning in the first part of July it'll start with communion and then it'll come into uh like Christ speak humble thyself a prisoner and then he cares for you it'll keep building throughout that month there there is a purpose I'm going to read here in a moment from the message a prisoner and brother Brandon preaches this message uh the the the the Wednesday before he preaches he cares do you and there's things that brother Branham is is seeing within the church and and he's he there's a burden that God has put upon him for this now I'm going to just read it to you out of a prisoner he says sometimes he said I believe one of the great things that I find in this day is the lack of sincerity of what we believe now watch on he says if God in the days of John Wesley would have done in that day what he has done today what would it have done in the days of Martin Luther or what more now watch what he goes in to say as we see him doing now that's important him doing both proven by the church by the Spirit by science and every move what are we seeing God proving his word through all of these channels and this statement I don't I can't preach on this side it's a separate study but notice this next statement it's emotion has to recognize now emotion is where you have you have uh uh different things that come together and you have maybe like different droplets of liquid and when they come together they do not make one substance they remain separate like oil into water right you can think of many different things like that and it does not make in other words blend in to become all the same so what brother Branham is saying here is that Christ himself has come down here Among Us he's not blending in with the Creeds and the dogmas and the world but he's standing out in the midst of it all as the mighty conqueror its Emulsion in other words it's not blending it was not God coming and putting in a man upon the Creeds but he was God coming and a Manning his own word by vindicating himself to be the same just as much as you can look in water when you put oil in boiling water you can see the oil the oil will move around the water and that's what Emulsion is that's what the life of Jesus Christ is in the Church of the Living God you see this is why he comes in you and he doesn't change himself he doesn't change his nature but he comes and changes your nature and it becomes the same Jesus on display in a manifold many membered body in a variety but the same nature being displayed what is it it is the Emulsion of the Holy Spirit God's own life on display through his body so now let me keep on reading here so its Emulsion has to recognize and God's word here declaring it and telling it before it comes to past and then moving upon and prophesying and showing the very thing that he said it'll come to pass perfectly exactly what he said now there's no denying that we see God right here Among Us there's just no there's no denying of that right there it's God Among Us it's God dealing with your heart God dealing with your life God Healing The Sick God bringing Deliverance come on friends it's just like when you bring in new recruits guess what you got basic training hello somebody sometimes the things that maybe you have an altogether seen out here but you don't know back there in that office but God's will deliver no matter where he's at Hallelujah now I want you to catch this and brother Brandon says after seeing all this and still we sit kind of slothful as if we wonder well wonder if that could mean me wonder if it could mean just the church in whole or wonder if I'm really included in this and so brother Brown identifies this coming Sunday morning which he's going to preach he cares do you care he said I'm going to try to talk on some of those principles that might Enlighten us a little now you see Satan's objective is to try to keep things obscure let me tell you the message of the hour is not obscure it's the light of almighty God I don't care what message you listen to I don't care what message you come here and hear you're always going to hear it's it is that of Christ being veiled in a body that of a true experience with God a relationship are you hearing me we don't have to say maybe the exact words but because why it's God on display you can preach the new birth but if it's not God on display then it's only talking about something you're reading in the word but God displays that he is the same God and as he displaced himself he's letting you and I know this is your personal property so it's something to give us a greater knowledge and understanding in a situation and so when we see this I'll just say it in this way God's desire is that we would walk with and live with a true Godly certainty in our lives we're talking about rapturing faith we're talking about faith in to walk as a Believer as a son and daughter of God God's desires that we would walk with a certainty in our life are we going to be challenged you will be challenged but Faith itself will also grow but there's got to come a certainty within our lives to where it's not my faith but it's God's faith that's operating in other words it's God's love that we're trusting in because we know I I don't just I haven't just read about him I know him it's not what I can just talk about he can do he's done it are you with me not like somebody's selling lamps and they don't even have one of those lamps in their home you're talking about somebody because we can talk about the word have all the dialects and everything down but what makes the difference is is to know him who is the word and then we walk with the certainty to where if there's going to be one it's going to be me if there's one going out of this community and here in the church today sorry for all the rest of you but I'm the one I'm the one come on Friends now I want you to think about this it's to live in a manner you see listen let me say something you that ain't just a quote that's the way you have faced your job that's the way you face school that's the way you face everything in your life if there's one here that's ordained to handle this I am that one that God has placed here to handle this it's not me it's Christ in me I think it's not robbery [Music] that's the kind of Faith we're talking about it's not a faith that I'm building myself up it's a faith where I'm standing on his word and what is confirmed to me Beyond even what my thoughts because his thoughts are overtaking my thoughts and then it becomes his thoughts that we're expressing like that and you stand back and say whoa where did that come from and the devil wants to draw you out and say yeah you don't want to get all puffed up you know how it is you don't want to be you know bloated up like this or no glory hey I am talking a language that belongs to me as a son and daughter of God and God has given me that language that's restored the original language [Applause] when the Jew from Babylon God restored the language when the Jews came back in Zion God restored the language and God has restored the language of the Holy Ghost in This Hour to his called out children without faith familiar scripture without faith it's impossible to please God and Faith itself is based on forgiveness that's what it's based on now instead of our faith would be anointed I pray to God that this audience this morning would be anointed with faith and that Faith Comes Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that there's an Evidence of himself of his presence right here Among Us anointing our faith it's pulsating to you and I because if anything you approach if you don't have sufficient faith you'll never obtain it you've got to have sufficient Faith now let me read here in Ephesians chapter 1. the Bible said in whom verse 11 and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation see remember Paul in in Romans 10 how can they hear except there be a preacher and how can one preach except to be sent Paul goes on to say how can they call upon Him whom they have not heard now the name Jesus is almost synonymous among so many churches but we recognize that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he is he is revealed as the mighty conqueror his Nature has never changed his word has never changed he's not an ideology of man he is the living person of almighty God right here Among Us that has made a way in Redemption that you and I can come fully back into our possession as Sons and Daughters of God is that right so when we thank God for this that when we can see it in a manner in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation so there had to be the sounding of the truth the gospel of Salvation what is that of Salvation letting you know you are free a person said but I still have this I still have that but the gospel is declaring Freedom by the authority of the blood that was shed and the Holy Spirit is announcing it to do what let you know that you don't have to remain in the same condition any longer in other words the trumpet sounds and says it's long enough the freedom you have been craving you have been Desiring it's here it's here it's him he is your freedom [Applause] in whom notice in whom so you trusted after you heard it in whom also after that you believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit a promise so there must be a word that sounds out that makes known the way into the promise of almighty God just like the trumpet would be blown for the time of Jubilee it will let him know you can get back to your inheritance when God became flesh there was a sounding that was even being declared this is the acceptable year of the Lord you know what was being declared that the pathway back into the holist of holies back into Glory back into the prince of God it was being Vindicated and identified in the man Christ Jesus and that was stirring the hearts of the people to recognize that this now of Jubilee was on once the blood was shed now you can go back to your inheritance see there there's something within you that's why you couldn't be satisfied here satisfied there even sitting in a message Church you can't be satisfied with just knowing God sent a prophet because you are ordained to dwell in the land of promise and the land of promise is the word himself the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why you can't be satisfied anywhere else or anything else you'll run yourself miserable listen just save the tithe and say devil you ain't gonna run me around this mountain no longer I'm tired of seeing the same old thing saying the same old thing I I'm changing my confession are you hearing me you will see it with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory now I put my notes up here in a minute I want it because I got three principles and I don't know if I'll get to them today but right out of the message he cares to you the first principle I'm going to talk about is read this is being thoroughly convinced that this is God and this is his desire for me he is manifesting himself and his will for my life and my purpose he is here to bring my faith to a full reality in him and this is some direction don't pay attention to anything else focus on him now and he cared to you let me work with this first principle being thoroughly convinced you got to be thoroughly convinced that what is that that's coming with sufficient faith right remember John remember John stood there and John got his eye filmed over and uh when Jesus when the disciples came and Jesus said to his disciples he said he said stay here for this meeting and then you watch what God is doing the deliverances all those things the healing and all that and then that is the message I want you to take back to John what was it it was a living God and John knew him are you hearing me John knew him John had met him and the only thing that could encourage John was God himself so what John had to do was when they stayed around and seen it and they went back with the report they went back and began to testify of what they saw let me tell you friends there's a lot if you get your eyes looking everywhere else you're gonna be down discouraged and defeated but you you can't you can't be looking everywhere else you've got to look unto Jesus what I'm preaching here this morning is because I'm looking unto Jesus and God has entrusted me as a steward of this house to preach that word of where I'm looking unto Jesus this is the direction we're going [Applause] [Music] we're not going back we're not staying the same we're going on Hallelujah and I'm just gonna I'm gonna let you know right up front I haven't wrote nobody off devil listen up so you understand this too because you know and I tell you yeah we ought to be cheerleaders in a sense of saying God what you did for me you'll do it for them and we keep pressing on individually [Applause] you won't find brother Samuel coming with a measuring stick on your life but the word will be preached and you will allow yourself to evaluate will you do that will you allow your word your life to say where am I at with the word then let the word bring discernment let the word bring Deliverance speak the word that we go forward you say brother Samuel why do you say that because I'm not your absolute I'm not your Holy Ghost and neither is any other man or any other woman in here you've got a right to a genuine experience I'll tell you right now press on with all you got if you can only we weave this this pinky let me tell you something you're going to find out in my heart standing there like David saying come on we can take this battle they're only waving a pinky if they wave a pinky today it'll be the whole finger tomorrow from this finger to this finger to this finger what is it I know that God is able and God is present to do what he said he would do [Applause] Hallelujah but Samuel how can you not give up because he never gave up on me [Music] devils are rich and I'm not proud of that but teachers in school students that knew me wrote me off but he didn't you couldn't get me off of his book and you know what you couldn't get me off his mind and what he did for me if he did it for me if he did it for me he'd do it for anybody are we clear well brother Samuel so no no let the word as it's coming forth even now and in Services if God tarries you let the word stand right there before the word and let the word be that of the measuring in your life don't measure yourself compared to anybody else in this assembly you measure your life with the word because it's your experience nobody else has experience [Applause] if you're moving inch I'm going to say glory to God [Applause] now let me let me just I wonder I want to read these points here I don't know if he cares do you is that all right now I want you to understand this they sang that song how perfect is he Worthy because let me say this to you the seals have been taken off you know what the seals was taken off so that we might see Christ in Plainview the pathway back into the holiest of holies to the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God we couldn't see our way there without him coming and loosening is certain Isaiah they delivered to the they delivered the book to him that's unlearned he that was unlearned said I can't read it I'm not learned and so they delivered it to him that was learned and he that was learned said I can't read it because the words of this book are as the words of a book that is sealed [Applause] thank you but he has taken the seals off of himself [Applause] he's taken the seals off of your life if you let him he'll break every seal of unbelief he'll take every seal away of wondering and I wonder if this could be me and well I was raised in this and the devil said yeah you know it was only happenstance and it was only by chance you were here and you've been raised in this all along but you need to have a declaration of your heart I'm not here by chance I've been told you were a mistake you're not a mistake you're here by Design [Applause] every word of God every promise of God belongs to you this message came for you this message is about you Hallelujah you believe that this message is for you [Music] Hallelujah I want to let it go just let it go lay it aside right now lay it aside it broke the covering that then releases God's nature God's life to work among the church in the church and in our lives to Break about because of nobody and we're living in a day where there's so many false promises is that right how many women brother Brown said he thought he was going to be a hero when he got home because he found a he's in a detergent on a commercial in a hotel room and you know dip the egg in there foreign came out still eggy gifted again still eggy that's man let me tell you something you know why that's about because that's the way that the gospel has been treated you we may think commercials and that is so separate it comes together you can't come to that standard of lying unless there's false being presented come on now you can't come to that it all starts they want to talk about juvenile delinquency parent delinquency Pulpit delinquency Pulpit delinquency is where it first starts [Applause] because it establishes true headship coming on down his life flowing on down so all these promises all these promises well you know it belong to this or belong to that and Below I'm not against anything that could help somebody I'm not against that but there's nothing that can clean can I say it like this the egg off of a life like the blood of Jesus Christ let me tell you something not only did the blood do away with every stain it does away with every desire [Applause] now let me read this quote and you'll see how God breaks this Veil it's obscurity this darkness in this hour regarding around that of sincerity but the Bible says people don't get down to that real colonel of sincerity he says the very English word of sincerity has lost its value to the people it's by the way of people of living it's lost sincerity to them and they don't seem to understand and it goes on to talk about even to our confessions and I'm going to get to that maybe not this service but notice he goes on to say unless paragraph 62 and I want you just to everybody okay this is a this is a principle right here of Deliverance unless you are deeply sincere and you cannot be sincere until you're positive understand right now when we talk let me just he's going to deal with this understanding here because understanding is not that you become a Bible scholar the boy I'm able to that's not what he's talking about remember the scripture said he that uh heareth my words and believeth on me shall have everlasting life right brother man will pick that up throughout the message in Satan's Eden in other places and he says to hear it means to understand it he said because a prostitute can hear it and remain a prostitute a drunkard could hear it and remain a drunkard but he said when that begins to fall upon a sea it's something different here hey man there's something touching my life that's different this is not aware there's like somebody that's right down in my Pew right down in my life what is it it's understanding we are in the presence of almighty God and you can recognize that when you're in his presence what I do just draw on him you recognize his presence go ahead release Lord this is what I need in my life [Applause] [Music] brother Samuel I don't feel worthy throw that blind devil down throw him down I'm telling you by the word of the Lord throw him down if there's something that's out of light right here just throw it out of your heart what are you doing I'm siding with the word of God you cannot be sincere until you're positive you understand now remember also talked about you can be sincere and sincerely wrong right so we want to establish a difference we're talking about a sincerity that's a condition of the heart because when they threw brother Brahm tells us when they threw them babies in Egypt into the alligators he said they were sincere they were feeding those Gods that's what they were believed the Buddhist they're sincere when they approach yeah right so sincerity alone won't do it it's got to be sincerity according to the word God giving a direction a principle into deliverance and you cannot be sincere until you're positive you understand if you're presuming or guessing or hoping so then there cannot be a depth of sincerity that God requires if faith if faith is not a hope so or it could be right it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's your absolute it's the thing that you're tied to you have to come to your ultimate that it is the truth and it's nothing but the truth and it must be thus the same here what are we talking about that this is the truth what are we speaking about that he the person of truth that his life being veiled in a life to change it from Death unto life that he would manifest himself to be the same yesterday today and forever that he takes the nature that old carnal sticky nature that loves the world and the things of the world that God will come down and perform an operation and change that life and bring forth a saint out of a life that had been so black and so mocked up with sin there's got to be an ultimate something that you can tie to and say this is the truth [Applause] and this is for me if you see it are you hearing me blessing are your eyes that see it and blessed is your heart that that stirs on the inside that says that's me that's for me there's something what is that that's a deposit of God and it's God moving upon a deposit he placed in your life like a magnet that's sweeping by the angel of the Lord sweeping by so in other words the Holy Ghost is not a maybe soul my Deliverance is not a hope so it might be it is a certainty brother REM could say and over and over he says has he ever said anything and it not be done amazing he's proving himself all of that every bit of the prayer line was proving God's word that he's the same and he delivers a real true experience now here's the thing and then when you realize that in your mind then you've got to approach it with your whole life so now once you realize it you've got to approach it with you now this this becomes into our hands we've got to approach it with our whole life remember not a so far Samson gave God his strength right gave Delilah his heart he had a so far but we don't believe in so far religion you might as well let it be resolved in your heart I'm not a so far Christian brother Samuel I've been so far but so far has been so far now is different you make a declaration in your heart right now I'm not going to be a so far Christian I'm not gonna live beneath my privileges I am not going to sit here and be robbed any longer I'm going to get into the land and enjoy my inheritance I'm going to enjoy my Liberty and I'm going to enjoy my freedom I'm going all the way my mind just made up then you approach it with your whole life soul body all that's in you just completely sell out everything to it now he picks up I don't have time to read it but out of Matthew 13 he picks up where One Of The Parables of the Kingdom of Heaven where a man had many pearls but then he found the pearl of great price and he sold all of the other pearls to get this Pearl now the rest of them were pearls was that right I mean he didn't have rocks he had pearls and brother Bram calls those pearls that he had truths he had truths truth I'm gonna read it to you he had truths but once he found the pearl of great prize he sown all of the truths for that Pearl because why the Peril is the way the truth and the life Hallelujah and Jesus so bracely taught us in the man buying pearls I'm just going to read it he found the one of great price and he sold all his others to get it all the truths and everything that he had though they were good pearls this one meant all to him there's been truth down Through the Ages that means there's been truths scattered in through other in through other churches right and and thank God for truth I mean you might have had your start in a Baptist Church of Pentecost I don't know wherever you might you might have you're starting a Catholic Church right but there's something that wouldn't let you stay [Music] because you know why he always belonged to God and what I'm talking about belonging to God I'm talking about you as one of his children you belong to dwell in the promised land That's why nothing else could satisfy you good people good truth but there's something about it said this is good but it's got to be something more I'm looking for something more I say what is that that's what David said there's a deep call it to the deep and if there's a deep that's calling there's a deep to respond I say there's more of God for you [Applause] when you find God's ultimate his word a promise Upon A Certain thing you must know first that it is God's word you find the promise of the Holy Ghost I want you to watch here right now put your thoughts aside and let God's thoughts permeate it's no first that it's God's word not know first or allow reasoning to enter in it may not be for me or I've tried over and over but the promise is yea and amen God has spoken who can but prophesy God ain't a man that he should lie or the son of man that he should repent every word of God is yea and amen heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never fail what do I do shout out your reasoning let the word override every thought let me just say something to you not to take your mind off track but I know sometimes when I have to look back at videos I know I'm an ugly looking God I make ugly faces when I preach but don't look at my ugly face and don't say man he must be mad at me there's one person I'm mad at and that's a devil and I don't like it when he picks on God's children he's got God on his hands when he picks on God's children I don't like it either because you're made to live free you're made to live in Liberty and we're going all the way we're going all the way we're not leaving hook behind not one part of my life outside from under the blood I'm going all the way all the way [Applause] God's word being the ultimate has nothing to do with your failures it has to do with we get started looking at all my reasoning look at everything else let the word be your focus looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of your faith the same yard that brought you out of Egypt the same God who's LED you and cared for you the same God when the enemy trying to overtake you he came between you and the enemy that same God he's letting you know if God be for us who can be against us [Applause] by the time we need to get the other points if I go to the other points and this isn't established the other points mean nothing because he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him Hallelujah his word is a promise of a certain thing you must know first that it's God's word that the thing that you're seeing I want you to watch the thing that you're seeing being done is God we can go through lives being changed we just had a testimony last week God taking cancer off another there's more I've got had to restart and listening to certain things out I forget about some of you remember have better memory of me I I I just to me things God is doing right now sometimes it's not even here in church it's among his people that's why there's testimonies you know what that's about that's to build our faith God took down some Kings before they went over in the land God went up against some kings that raised up in Rebellion God knew they'd rebelled and the Holy Spirit he knows that Devil's going to try to Rebel he'll try to raise up he'll try to dig his feet in but he's no match for the Holy Ghost and you know what God's doing he's taken down one king after another you know why he's doing that he's doing that for you that's for your life that's for your personal testimony he's taken things out of your life one step at a time it may not be all at once but if he does one thing rejoice and look for him to do more and expect him to do more Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] there's no maybe so it could be it looks like it might be it is God man and I said to you the promise is unto you amen as many as the Lord Our God shall call you might have been brought here as a young person sure you might have heard about this even years and years ago but why are you here this morning [Music] why are you here this morning I'll tell you why there's a call of God upon your life brother Samuel that's being awful assertive let me tell you something I've got a right to say about the authority of God's word I'm called to preach a bride message with a true experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't care what situations look like God is a god of paradoxes he's more than enough he can take an unbeliever and make a Believer out of them God can take a make-believer make a Believer out of it God will take a Critic and make a Critic stand up and testify I was once a critic but now I'm standing as a witness there's no limitations to God Hallelujah God he's a god of paradoxes he opened the Red Sea he opened the Jordan he's open blind eyes he's healed the sick he's delivered and that same God it ought to be enough that we rise and say I'm convinced [Applause] [Music] it's God then what give everything you've got [Applause] give her don't hold nothing back remember cast down that reasoning cast down imagination cast it down let the word have preeminence in your life let the word lead you all the way because it's our thinking that's got us in the places we're at right now but let the thoughts in the mind of Christ of what God you want to know what God thinks about you he's letting you know right now this is what he thinks about you you belong to him you've always belonged to him yours and inheritance for you in the promised land this message not against you this message has come to lift you in position it's a principle of Deliverance [Applause] I'm just gonna have to stop two more principles I want to get to here but this is the first one and it's very important let me tell you this but God is doing he's doing it with you and me in mind give everything you've got to him laid down in a repentance unto him if there's something that's a besetting sin habit something that's taken hold and it's there it seems like it's linger lay it aside do you realize who's given you the authority to do that that's him who ascended on high over every principality and Power it's him who's in our midst it's God I'm so tempted to go to that second principle now maybe it's long but just touch real quick I'm not going to preach you but here's the second principle just a little bit of a foretaste well you pull that pull that up Sister Brian I haven't listed their second principle is she back there second principle what's up thank you okay this is my words here's the second principle this is what brother Bram goes into get away from all unbelief [Music] get away from all unbelief means every voice that speaks contrary 10 opposing voices did in the camp when they said we can't go up they're bigger than us they're do this they do that do that you know what it caused a wailing and a weeping they were a bunch of mourners oh we're just dead Men You're Not Dead brought you out by the blood of the Lamb [Applause] we're nothing but grasshoppers in their sight that's a lie that was in their mind have you forgot who brought you out have you forgot who started the work in your life if God before us who can be against us [Applause] that's worth putting on the refrigerator and rubbing his nose in every single moment get away from all unbelief you must separate yourself and you do that by obedience to the word of God Lord I'm going to obey your word I might still feel it here in my heart but you say God I am I've heard you I've recognized that you and I'm going to act on your word I'm laying it down I'm stepping aside Lord cleanse the desire out of my life who are you asking to cleanse the desire the same God who raises the Dead the same God who heals cancer the same God who has testimony sitting around that our spokesman testimony is to say what he did for me he'll do it for you he's never lost his power [Applause] but the same you don't know how long I've been around it well then God's just got a testimony for you and God's going to work a testimony in your life to come right back and somebody else might be sitting there and they'll be under that old cloud of Gloom I've been here so long and you'll be one to be able to stand up and say hey wait a minute that that thought once was around me but I'm a witness I thought I had went past my day of Grace I thought I had sinned it away I thought there was no for me but look what God has done in my life [Applause] get away from so far religionist oh and you're just all right you're doing it get away from every voice and just be locked in on the voice of God devil said well you're only worked up that ain't God telling you that Hallelujah it's simple action upon the word of God it's sell out everything brother saying if I could right now I'd pause and have you come up here and give your testimony but if you don't mind if I can just kind of walk through because it was a lot like mine too but the Shane gave that testimony and I wasn't going to do this but it just comes to me is that all right but the same when he spoke here to the young people here the the other Friday going now some things that I wanted him to just said press on my heart from the previous youth meeting but Shane began to speak about doors and he said you know there were a lot of doors he he laid it out like it was in in my house he said there was a lot of doors in my life I had a door of music a door of relationships in the world a door of this and door of that and he said but I had to let God go into each door eventually as he invited God and letting God go into the door on his music God took away the music then God went into the relationships praise God but Samuel was it all like this no but it didn't listen to me it doesn't mean that things can't be like that can I preach just a moment if for your life and your experience is just like this I'll say glory to God your experience is like this this this this this this I'll say glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God be like David shouting through we're one step closer glass coming down [Applause] but doors after doors after doors remember how God took things out of my life it was door after door after door brother Bram explains that perfectly in the message the Messiah in 1961 he says it's that little white button coming in and it's God taking over letting God have the right of way it's selling out everything that's what selling out everything means that's what surrendering means just inviting God in it's like if I invited you in and made you stand on the doormat right there welcome like I told the young people I said you know we're in here and you could hear us they're praying over Pizza they're getting pizza I said only thing you would do is hear the sounds from what was behind the curtain I mean what was in other parts of the house you would only have to you would only be guessing that because you wouldn't be seeing it it's about the same as he got cheese pizza and said pepperoni you wouldn't know because you're only on the welcome mat so you welcome him in as your savior but he wants to be Lord and that's where you invite him to every room in your house and you let him take over that's why I said you don't compare yourself to nobody else in this church you compare yourself to the word that's being preached are you hearing me because God is moving us onward Hallelujah let's just bear our heads now just say it like this we couldn't even get into that spot but I believe we got to where God wants us today and he knows he knows very very important the principle to recognize it's him and his desire for me his desire for me is that he would dwell in me he would live he would walk in my life he would influence my life it would be that that transformation it would be that of victory unto victory it's his desire to bring healing to every part of your life first in part to your soul and to everything else he's he's the Healer there's no limitations to him and the second principle to it once you recognize that here it's him then he's the one that makes you aware of anything that's contrary to him it's not a man shaming you it's not a man condemning you it's the conviction of the Holy Spirit but the same what do I do move upon that conviction respond to the conviction of the Holy Spirit and watch the grace that brought conviction bring Deliverance act upon it stand with the words stand Lord I Repent Lord I Give Myself fully to you I lay down every thought I lay down all my ideas I lay down my reasoning I laid down my imagination don't even have an imagination about the Holy Ghost just let him be him let him do what he does because he testifies of all his works say Lord with our heads bound how many could say Lord I recognize it's you now you might be sitting here this morning no doubt because every one of us are in different Journeys different spots on our journey but for whatever your need is this morning it's important you recognize that he's still God you might be praying about your children it might be healing it might be Deliverance it might be for the holy ghost in your life but it's important you recognize this is God this is the god of paradoxes this is the Living God this is an ultimate that I can take and say this is positive he's a living God he's my God and stand upon that many say that I recognize that it's God it's for me it's God now whatever it is that's contrary to what God has revealed would you just be able with an authority right now to act upon his authorities say I lay that aside because part of the laying of Assad it actually is a repentance or a denouncing and a standing with him maybe it's been an attitude maybe a bad attitude maybe fear maybe doubt maybe whatever I don't know healing we can go on but he's personal if it would help you for me to call it out he'll give it to me but I don't believe you need that I believe he's worked with you and me in a personal way here this morning that you can say I denounce everything contrary to the voice of God that's speaking to my life this is a principle of Deliverance it's approaching god with sincerity because you could go out of here after hearing everything and you'd walk out the same way but you've got to make there's got to be decisions that are made there's got to be something where you say I'm going Lord by your help I Lay My Life down it's I it's you now I give everything all all but I am my soul my everything I give myself to you Lord I want you to overtake my life Lord I can't get to it this morning on a confession of real repentance but that there's a real repentance there's a real confession there's a siding with a word of almighty God but let it be in your heart right now if it's a habit let's lay it aside if it's a weight you've been carrying let's lay it aside Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our hearts in your presence I'm Lord I am I'm satisfied lordy even though Lord in my heart I would love to just deliver everything Lord that you've placed on my heart but in one way it has and in another way Lord you've brought us the Lord what was needed for this moment uh Lord I I thank you for that and I thank you Lord that you would just even while the word's been going forth you've been moving Lord the angel of the Lord is here in our midst and Lord it's you that's moving speaking to our hearts encouraging us with a faith to approach [Music] every promise of God promise of the Holy Ghost the promise of healing promise of salvation promise of Deliverance every promise in the book is mine and you said Lord in your word blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled no maybes no might Bees No matso shall be filled Lord I pray God even here this morning for every Hungry Heart Lord every heart that would just in Simplicity and in real sincerity just to prostrate themselves before you Lord to lay the life down say Lord I lay my life down before you I lay it Lord God let the fire come upon the altar let it consume let it burn out every desire let it burn out everything that's unpleasing the Lord to you to where there's nothing left but a Son of God or a daughter of God consume all the world Lord I'm taking my way with the Lord's despised View like Moses a choice is made granted Lord here this morning I pray that God that may there be more doors that are opened in lives more rooms that God that you become occupied maybe it's in dress maybe it's in music maybe it's in the door of pride maybe it's in the door of passion God may you move Lord for every door maybe it's that door of self God we invite you to every door Lord [Music] come Lord Jesus come feel Lord every life may it be Lord at this moment that every heart where it's settled it's upon you Lord and I'm going to give all that I am giving all of my life flinging all it down nothing matters besides him all of my wants I'm only empty I need him granted Lord this morning as the heart Rises into that Lord It's realize it's long enough to realize Lord I pray that you'll fill every vessel Lord and I pray God that you give every one of us a fresh refilling Lord I need a fresh refilling right here this morning yesterday or the day before that ain't good enough I need afresh killing and a fresh refilling Lord granted Lord a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit got a restoring of the joy of thy salvation oh God for any heart that's lost that the joyous departed from their life may they see the Lord may they look and recognize you can restore it right now but it's also important to recognize that that Joy begin to leak away little by little by little by little by little it's a little foxes that spoiled the blind the Vine just start getting your attention on other things and you know the world can never bring you lasting Joy it's from one event to the next from one thing to the next that's the world but you were meant to live with the joy of the Salvation of the Lord remember what he did for you quick remember what he did for you remember where he brought you from remember how he took your laugh and he cleaned your life up remember how he took habits out of your life remember how he moved for your family [Music] remember the joy of his salvation because that Joy is where you've got a meat offering a drink offering and that meat offering and that drink offering it's Christ it's his life it's where abiding in his presence that's your joy that's your satisfaction you remember how the prophet said he said you've got a call to go beyond the river a call that goes beyond this Ridge Beyond this Ridge Beyond this Ridge now you know how it is you don't get from Ridge to Ridge by hopping from Ridge to Ridge to Ridge you got to go from this Ridge go down in the valley to get on top of the next Ridge then you got to go down in the valley to get up to the next Ridge the same God on the mountain is the same God in the valley the valley was not there to destroy you the valley is to prove what fruit is in you what do I do keep heeding to the call that says come up a little higher come up a little higher come up a little higher what do I do keep yielding to that voice he'll Lead You from One Ridge through the valley to the next Ridge through the valley through the next Ridge through the valley until we're resting in the arms of the Lord Jesus glory be to God it's him children it's him it's him like that woman who had an issue of blood she said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment the one who knew she had need of her daughter to be healed she said I've got to get to him and he spoke she recognized who he was to her she said Lord and he was her Lord right here this morning if you can just just Reach Out for your need in your life maybe it's something that you just seemed like I've never been able to lay this aside but yes you can because he said you can he's here to do what he said he will do oh let's just move this morning while the water is being stirred by the presence of God let's step into the water let's step into it and wear that cot that you've been laying on that bed that you've had to lay around the pool where the supernatural's at there's a God here this morning and like all those people that were there he had this step over every one of them he has stepped over all your unbelief he has stepped over all your doubt and he has come right to your heart's door every excuse that the devil ever tried to give you he's walked right over it as a mighty conqueror and he's come right to your door how about it this morning why don't you let The God Who send the Angels the God who sent the message why don't you let the God who is the message why don't you let him raise you up this

Peter came out from that upper room with the rest of them they had went in there as men that were frayed and cowards but they went in under the leadership of the word to the promise of God and what we're going to witness here in just a few moments he's just his presence that's here they asked the question what must we do to be saved see it's something about it that stood out to them that they recognized that I can be a partaker of this too what must I do to be saved Peter never said go join a church Peter never said go be buddies with the pastor here's what he said repent and how can you repent if you don't know who he is but when he's coming he deals with your life then you can repent because you're convicted of your sin there's a real sincerity I'm wrong he's right and I give my life to him repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that's being sincere repentance real repentance is being sincere Lord it might cost me every friend and every relationship but you're worth it all Lord that's real repentance I turn from my sin that's the next part that I ain't got to preach on but that is a reality because you can't really repent Without Really knowing him Hallelujah glory be to God what a moment for the Aaron sister Amanda what a moment what a moment Hallelujah what a moment amen a moment for God to come and the work that he started in your life he's going to finish it you know you make a stand for God you got all the heavens standing behind you [Music] you believe that you got more than 10 guys on a bench you got all of Heaven you got a host of angels you got a promise in God's word that's dealt with your life he wants to be the Lord of all your life and just as you walked in the waters of baptism right here just step by step of the way let him take over all your life he'll do it all you believe that you're looking to Witnesses you're looking at a witness he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah

for this moment to come and I won't let it pass me by oh I won't go back to the way if you used to be before your presence came and changed me I'm not going back not going back before your presence [Music] now think of how the prophet said it in things that are to be he said as we see God he said when you see that need in your life he said ask him to lay word on top a word on top of word until you become a full stature you see it's a relationship there's something that is the word calls us to separation if there's something that you look at and say this is standing between me and believing all the word of God when I'm talking about believing all the word of God is our life being able to punctuate it within a man then you know what you've got to write an authority to invite Jesus into that place of your life invite him when you're sitting on the computer inviting with that music not the music invite him but invite him right there invite Jesus and what's Jesus just begin to dismantle every hold upon your life let him be Jesus the mighty conqueror little by little by little by little and remember no matter if it's like this or it's little by little let's keep moving on footsteps are possession every little increment we're going to say glory to God if God took over the closet in somebody's life of Music That's a time to testify God has brought a Deliverance in music because what God did in one area he'll do all of it he brings a toll to Deliverance is that right he's gone God we're out here Among Us he's God is an Awakening [Music] just walk walk and walk the Lord is here for you and obtain you to take away everything that you don't want in your life Jesus God is there for you Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus thank you for your mercies Lord God you are so mindful of every one of us as your children God the desires that you put in our heart Lord that come from you I think Lord the desires that stand here is a pastor that come from you Lord and that same desire God it doesn't stop with me it moves to every life every believer it's you Lord it's you Among Us and God we're expecting full Deliverance we're expecting to where we can say no longer going to walk around this mountain whatever it might be complex whatever be setting sin we're going on we're going all the way we're going from justification to sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the person of Christ himself we're going on Lord may that be the resolve in every one of our hearts that I'm not a so far person I'm all the way all the way and I'm going to press press press like a salmon getting back to its breeding grounds it has to go Upstream you don't have to sometimes Crossroads places where there isn't even water God even as they documented at that one time where that salmon even he was hatched out in a hatchery but it's the scent of water from the Homeland that it follows that scent till it gets back to the grounds where it was born and that salmon Lord as they documented I think on that old documentary Lord that Moody Bible Institute put out that salmon was seen it had to pop a great off in order to get back into that place oh God it takes the Lord of Reckoning from that in an understanding we do as your children to recognize as your Prophet said when there is a life with the hunger and the desire then there is a veil and a barrier to be broken oh God we surrendered Lord we submit Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we're going back to our homeland in the name of Jesus Christ bless your children Lord watch over them today bless their Time Lord watch them as they go of their their separate ways they make their Journeys back their time of Fellowship God may you be Lord I pray in the theme of it all may you continue to move Lord even as the eating dinner Lord God may your presence Lord just moving oh God and Father throughout this day and Lord God through on the oncoming hours oh God May the anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord continue to move Lord and Quicken that word in the promise of God granted Lord I pray father continue to fulfill your word Lord in our lives and our hearts in Jesus name amen and amen amen God bless you love you
