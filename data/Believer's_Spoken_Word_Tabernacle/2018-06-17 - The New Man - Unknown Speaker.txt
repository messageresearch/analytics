Lord we feel like we're already in August these temperatures I'll tell you the way they are you know but certainly good to be a Christian just say to each and every one of you especially to our fathers to stay god bless you richly amen just what a what a real privilege it is and just so thankful you know when we come into these times that how God by His grace has given to us the influence that's needed in this hour that we might truly be real representatives of him you know you think of it in the scripture there are so many so many different principles that are laid out in the scripture there's many principles that even this nation itself it's still it's run by many principles they get from the scriptures and yet they don't know him and I don't say that with any slight but what I'm saying is is what I've said many times times that I've set and counseled with people that don't even come here to this assembly they don't go anywhere but they've come and they've set and they've asked that I would counsel them and the things that I would mention to him was I said you know you can follow these principles right here in the word and they'll work for you but how much greater it is if you get he who is the principle man I said he he's the only one that can really make these seeds flourish in your life and that's the truth and we so we thank God for that because there's things that we can look at and we thank God for each and every one the influences that the Lord has brought into our lives that's been godly and we thank God for the influence of the Holy Spirit that has changed us and continues to change us amen don't you love him this morning amen well let's look into the word here and may God bless you thank you musicians want to look here in Luke chapter 5 this morning if the Lord will help us we'll begin at verse 36 and if if we could let's just have a word of Prayer first and then we'll we'll read the scriptures together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are just so thankful Lord you truly the Lord have made it real to us or that you are our Father and we are your sons and daughters Lord Lord I think of how that your prophet and made mention of this in the message Salome he said you're proving this to us because you have and are changing us from the things of the world to love you Lord God we see that change that has taken place and we in our hearts Lord that transforming power working in our lives Lord and father we just pray this morning that oh god may we be further changed Lord oh God from glory unto glory you you know Lord what we have need of Lord you know the needs in our lives Lord and father we just ask that you Lord would help us to be sensitive Lord because you have every answer Lord you're the answer to all of life's questions in every situation so lord help us to be steel Lord and just to be able to hear from you lord what it is that we need to hear father may you move among us in a real special way this morning Lord may our hearts be warmed Lord in your presence we pray and father we would ask all of these things for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Luke chapter 5 verse 36 and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh Arendt and the piece that was taken out of the new agree if not with the old it realized as the Lord Jesus is dealing with this here it's not so much that it is that the cloth itself or maybe the coloration would be different but that the new itself when it would be put into the old when it would go through all the other processes the washings and everything else it itself would not mesh and agree and hold the same qualities that would actually be present in the other garment and most of you know this if you've ever tried to somehow maybe your favorite shirt or whatever it is you've tried to somehow arrange things to where that you can get this repaired or maybe it's a piece of carpet or whatever more you know it just never really meshes just right the fibers just aren't right so here this is where the Lord Jesus is letting us know that it's not just putting something on the old because he won't agree verse 37 and no man putteth new wine into old bottles so he's taking the same thought else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish so God's not interested in blowing things up he's interested in saving you with me he never came to blow things up he came to save but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth knew for he saith the old is better may God bless you bless the reading was worse or being seated I'd like to speak to you this morning on the new man the new man this parable we we see that it has been recorded in each one of the Gospels except that of John and we we look at it at how that the Lord Jesus would speak of this and the people within that time those he was speaking to would have an understanding to what he was saying we sometimes look in our language of how things are recorded or documented and we look into it and it would be kind of hard if we left the term bottles and just left it in that terminology because you would look at it well if I put something in a bottle the bottle itself no matter if the bottle is old or new the bottle will be able to hold the contents but this is not speaking of a bottle glass bottle that we would look at but it is actually speaking of wine skins and wine skins were that which is made out of leather which leather meaning that of animal hide so when we think of it that it's hides of an animal typically it was animals that were either a goat or either a sheep and when you look at it that many times within this it was just looking at many different pictures of it it was it was many times left within the shape you could actually see the actual form of the animal hide itself because the hide being taken off the animal it no longer had all the contents on the inside the only thing that was needed or wanted was that hide and so they would take that hide they would bring it down from the neck and you know up from a certain part on all the legs and they would actually close off certain parts and almost all of these openings they would close them off and that would it would just look like it here it is it's just hanging upside down and what it looks like it looks like you could see you'd say hey what kind of animal is that hanging there well it was a sheep it was a goat it was a living animal at one time because you're able to identify the or that you still can see but yet everything that is there within that has been completely removed but now that wine has been put in place that the wine itself the juice that they freshly taken that the that the wine itself unfermented might begin to ferment inside of that wine or inside of the the animal skins itself and I look at this in the terms of the scriptures here in Ezekiel 36 I'm just going to go through a few scriptures here in the beginning and you see how that God Himself would speak to Israel and we know that it prophetically it speaks to you and I as well in verse 24 of Ezekiel 36 God said for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you and heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them now there's honor in in this whole reading of what we've just looked at there's not one thing within there that has spoken about you or me doing anything but remember in order for God to do this this is what he himself I will take away the stony heart I will give you a heart of flesh and I will give you a new spirit and then I will put my spirit within you you know all of this in order for this to take place remember God will never he does not force himself upon anyone so in order for this I will it requires that God moving on our life and that you and I are yielding to this that his work might be done it comes to it we in our lives we truly are his workmanship and this is where that even where God would would call a person and you know to think of how that you know many of us can remember it when God first dealt with your heart and and here are a heart in her life the way it was and the Spirit of God would call to us and you find quickly you repent of your sins and as you repent of your sins and you accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior you actually feel a release or a lifting because he already is the sin bearer he's already taken away the sins of the world he paid the price for that so you feel that release but yet the individual can still go around and and they still have all the desires in their life but then God also has said how we'll give you a new heart so there it meant there begins to be a changing of the mind itself setting the mind in order of holiness there's things that thoughts and things that begin to change within your life as God Himself is cleansing that heart and that life it's him doing the work that he himself might come in and then dwell in the middle or in the midst of our life and when that comes his spirit is placed within us then that's where that new birth that changes on the inside and he's living and dwelling behind his veil right there in the midst of our life and through that then there is his life that's permeating and moving out through the other courts of our life it's a great change because the things that you can look at in your life that I'm sure we can fellowship on this morning that there is no way that you could be able to do and live the way that you live if not for the mercy of Almighty God and God brought a change within your life listen friends our best efforts and our best days will never cut it but it has to be a change and God by His change coming on the inside then once he gets on the inside then as he continues to move removing his life all the way through you and I it's a continual dying can you say you man so this is his workmanship I will put my spirit within you in Titus 3:5 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost it's God releasing upon the seed the what is needed in the hour in order to bring the seeds of God to a complete birth and it's a it's a renewing of the Holy Ghost it's a washing of regeneration where the holy spirit through the word is going to bring about that transformation within the heart and within the life look how he puts it here in Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God but then puts it like this in God's power to transform he said he longs to have fellowship with you he is longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind not to the church or to the denomination but to his word which you are a part if that desire is in you you see the desire is not something that is given to us as far when we come to that around the word but it's a desire that is always there within us that nothing else could satisfy this is why the Prophet tells us and the message identification he sold that desire within you and he himself made a way that that desire come to a fulfillment all the way through this building there are a lot of things that perhaps some of you are desiring to do maybe desiring to do certain things around your house desiring to you know little things within the natural but yet you know that just desiring to do it and it being done is really two different things but what God Himself did not just leave you and I listen to me now he did not just leave you and I with just a desire to be a Christian but that desire has come into a full reality within our heart by a new birth to where that it is the very spirit of righteousness that's working on the inside and this is why the scripture can declare whosoever is born of God cannot commit sin because the seed of God remaineth in him you understand what the word commit means it means to be a practitioner you and one time lived in those conditions but you no longer live there there is you you are you have changed there's been a transformation that has taken place blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled for the RAM picks it up in another place and God's power to transform and it's in prayers that all God transform us today by your power by the renewing of our mind to turn from the meager elements of this world now unto the Word of God and may we be renewed by the transforming power of God upon the seed that's in our heart so the transforming power it's come from God that renewing of the Holy Ghost that washing of regeneration that is the inspiration the water that is poured out that what is need in order to release the germ that's on or the inside of that seed and bring it to life so pour out of that transforming power upon the seed that's in our heart you see God's the whole the whole thrust of redemption itself is God coming down to claim what belongs to him and this redemption of the soul then it is a deposit and a down payment that this body shall also be redeemed one day we're going to put off this thing one day we'll never walk around with that that that's human spirit that we've had there will no longer walk we will be there within a three-room house but we'll never be there in that human spirit with all of those memories and everything else of all your failures and ever you'll never be there and the body itself you're not just going to get a new body I told you the other day you need more than just a young body I need more than just a young body I need the buttons changed in this body there is a buttons that came with this body because of the first birth and them buttons are still there are you with me they're still there this body is sins is that were the Jews it was it was strictly written that you cannot take of an old hide and put new wine in it they they strictly wrote it because they're the old hides could not contain they were not flexible they could not actually be able to contain what would take place when that new wine was put on the inside so this when Jesus is speaking this they're aware of what he's talking about but what he's calling them to is there's got to be a transformation there's got to be a change now notice how he goes on to say here but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved now think about this when we look at it of how that in midst of it held that when you think of how that the manor itself would fall within the wilderness at that Manor being a type of the Holy Ghost they were sent together out and go gather that manner and remember the manor itself by the time of the evening that manna would already have maggots in it now when you look at it there's nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost nothing wrong at all but what manna fell on the first day the priests that were were commanded by God to go out and to take an Omer full of that original manner now this is not something that was a original manner that had to be replenished but it was the original outpouring of that manner and they were to take that Omer and they were to take the omer of manna and put it into the holiest of holies you know that manner inside the holiest of Holies it never got maggots in it it never contaminated that experience was just as fresh and true and genuine it didn't matter how long and with that experience was the same you see it matters where the Holy Ghost falls so when we talk about the Holy Ghost and we recognize that's why the word when God sent a word in this hour it's a word that would come that would release the Holy Spirit back into the Church of the Living God that Christ himself might have preeminence and lead the people of God and bring you and I into a real true birth according to the part that's allotted to us within the word to be fulfilled in this hour it is the Holy Spirit doing the work and it takes the power of the moisture of the Holy Ghost coming through the word to bring about a change because remember it's not a man's idea when God sends a messenger on the scene a messenger is not coming with his own thoughts or his own ideas he is a star in the right hand of God and he's electing that same life of the true atonement there's no variation in it it's being reflected right down into the Church of the Living God the age and that life that's there is to capture the elect of God within that hour you believe that the holy spirit is sent for the see that's the whole the whole part of how that the manna itself so when you look at this that the Spirit of God moving down and moving down to where that it would fall into new bottles new wineskins so that both are preserved remember as I said moments ago God's not interested in bringing ruin to a person's life that in God's that is that's a God's Way you see let me say it like this God he did we understand he doesn't force himself upon anybody and I don't believe that we also force ourselves upon anybody if there's people out there in your workplace your family or whatever more listen to me don't try to force what understanding that God has given to you first of all like we looked at here on Thursday night your first of all a billboard and the Prophet clearly said we're not salesmen you know what I mean I don't want to labor on that but we're billboard let it let a life be shown and wait till God opens the door let there be an answer I believe that was on my heart but we're to move by the unction of the Holy Ghost don't you allow Satan to put guilt upon you you can operate by guilt and end up bring an offense it's operated by the love of God and grace then is provided for the here so then when we're looking at it it's God's desire that within notice that the new wine and the new bottles that both of them are preserved to think of it that when that new wine is poured out when there are new bottles that are set aside for it that wine is actually preserved and the bottle is preserved whereas if it was old bottles and you put new while in there those skins have lost the oil they they have served their purpose and they're brittle they cannot be flexible that cannot be stretched they cannot be moved but that's why it must be new bottles let me tell you something if God brings forth new wine then God is the one who knows there is going to be new bottles because he's ordained new bottles to receive new one hallelujah he will not his word will not return back to him void so to preserve this is to preserve a thing from perishing or being lost and this is how that God God keeps his word God keeps his word he keeps it in her eyes the Prophet put it just like this his rights are protected on earth not my copyrights his rights are protected by Holy Ghost filled people there are lives that he has changed and they look upon that word and they're standing there in that word and said this is what God has said this is God's word he's still the same God in this generation and they stand upon that work that is horns on the lamb his protection of his rights on earth don't you want to be that aren't you glad you are that to be a vassal that he can move through and move upon our lives preserve that we would be preserved to think of it that when God has done this work you can no more die than God could die you are sealed until the day of your redemption you don't become unsealed you're sealed until the day of your redemption let's look at this a little bit an anointed ones at the end time the Prophet tells it like this he's talking about how they teach a historical God and trying to live in the past and well Wesley said so-and-so or so-and-so said so-and-so you're refusing the promised word of the day the manna that's clearly identified of the day they try to put their old Lutheran Baptist Pentecostal ones in our new bottles it don't work and our new wine in their old bottles won't work so let the old wine for old bottles but there's new wine for new bottles if they try to put this new wine in the nomination their folly is made manifest they can't do it it blows her up now what'd you think of this just for a moment remember God's desire is not just that there would be demonstrations but his desire would be a living action of his life within us how much you think of this I could speak I could pull out a lot of different things and and speak of this and say this will say that and it would demonstrate that I am a son of of James browning it would demonstrate that but God doesn't want demonstrations as far as that's the only thing that I live by God wants there to be a living action in our lives of the person of Jesus Christ this is why the Prophet himself was accused of not preaching the Holy Ghost and in Satan's Eden he said I understand there's people right around the tabernacle that has said why don't brother ban a preach on the Holy Ghost he said here it is it's the person of Christ within you quickened to every word for the age he said don't watch so much on demonstrations but watch the action of the person inside of you glory be to God if I'm going and somebody's kidnapped don't just send me and show me garments of that person if I've got to pay a ransom I don't want to just see garments of it oh I know he wears that shirt I know she does this now I want to see the person when I see the person I know it's still good rule repeater God Oh hallelujah so to think of how that God has given the strength of what has been needed for each day and for each hour we thank God for that thank God for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit down through the ages but remembering that even within that word that that God would desire that the people would walk on to think of how that God in every generation he's never opened his word inside of an organization another very simple but the reality is God does not open his word inside of an organization and you realize friends that where does organization stem from it stems from the very mind a mind of man it stems from carnal nature Luther did not start the lutheran denomination Wesley did not start the Methodist the right they were fallen angels who came behind that and then they themselves begin to move upon that but yet those who are danger life they move on in that life this goes the same way God will not move in organizational thinking that I'm dissing friends this is where it pertains to you and me God will not move if our minds gets in any way to organizational thinking oh I tell you I desire with all my heart God let it be a renewing Lord God I don't trust myself and if you trust yourself you're in bad trouble we need a renewing of the Holy Ghost no wonder the prophets said we've been saved we've been filled with the Holy Ghost now he said we need the mind of Christ to move in our renewing of our minds we need that Oh glory be to God what does it take to make a Christian life what's up brother BAM says this here may every heart he said go out of here singing with the mainspring of their soul the Holy Spirit and the pulsations of their heart as it beats all may their souls jump and spring and stretch to the Word of God as new bottles with new wine with a new hope with a new faith with a new spirit and God's Spirit in the middle of it the life pushing on them it's wonderful to jump but it's wonderful to shout but there's also times we need to stretch oh my is wonderful when it's it's going down oh it was sweet in my mouth that it gets down in the belly it's time to stretch this is where it comes to live it out in the word time to stretch oh my in the impersonation of Christianity the Prophet said think of it like this he said what he said I see what Jesus meant there if you put new wine unfermented one into a bottle like that and that new wine had life in it and it went to working and fermenting it would burst when they put that wine it's not for a minute it's freshly squeezed juice but when it gets inside of the animal hide the reason it needs new bottles is because there is a need for flexibility there's a need for stretching because what is taking place on the inside of that hide there is a change that's taking place what are that grape juice that it was placed within there freshly squeezed from the fruit of the vine oh my it's freshly squeezed and as it moves in there there is a transformation that is taking place to where that grape juice on the inside actually begins to become fermented and it actually moves within its potency and it's proof it don't get weaker it gets stronger you realize that the real holy spirit within our life it doesn't get weaker it gets stronger the Prophet tells us like this and the message Messiah he said when the holy ghost has come in he comes in like a little white button he said like a little white ray of light and it begins to grow in our life and begins to push out all these other things it's growing within us as it's growing within us how does it grow it's got to be a building of our lives on the inside now think of this how that God himself remember the life moving upon the sea God's desire is to dwell within the human heart this is God's desire this is where God sets up his residency he never dwelt in the outer Court he never dwelt within the holy place he dwelled in the holiest of Holies where he came down and where he told Moses I will meet you in there I will commune with you and there it was there that God the Shekinah glory would take up his residency in the innermost part and that is the same way that he does within you and I so this new bottle this new skin is not a changing of this skin but God himself knows the the real reality of this skin I just got to get to the inside and when I bring about the change on the inside to wear that I take out a stony heart and I put in a new heart then I myself can move on in the inside and be able to live out my life from within them and eventually from with inside this new wineskin on the inside I'll eventually get a new skin out here glory be to God so we become flexible because oil is still in the skin now look at this in in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 the scripture says for he is our peace who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby so the price was already paid as we've been looking at that price was paid he died just simply put it how the prophet put it he said he died that you and I might die he died but you and I might die if that had not been a surrendering and a death there's no way that you and I could die but because he died it makes way through the life through the water that is there that this ransom this price has been paid and now the Holy Ghost can flow in renewing and bringing about the change in our life to where it comes into a complete birth and I'm so glad it don't just stop there he's working in our life he's changing us from glory unto glory Oh glory we're not deceived to think that all of a sudden once we've been born again I'm all of a sudden a fully perfect man we have been born as a child and we grow and we grow and we grow there's child training there's training I'll tell you what we're going to need training we're going to need guidance of the Holy Spirit every moment that we live here in this life we're going to need correction by the Holy Ghost because there's still two parts of us that have not been redeemed but that inside man has been redeemed and that inside man is the one who feeds on the Word of God and that inside man is the one that looks to that outside man and says shut up you're going with me no wonder Paul said I bring my body in subjection that word subjection there means to beat it black and blue glory be to God so he made one new man we've seen this he's the beginning of this new creation and verse 17 came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were not for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God don't you think God for that think of how Ruth must have felt when she came into the land she's watching everything that taking place she's made a decision to come but oh how the Holy Spirit begins to woo and move in her life and then when there is a uniting with Boaz oh ma she's no longer a stranger but now she is a fellow citizen she was one without the covenants now she is in the Covenant by a real true spiritual marriage think about Rahab after the walls have fallen down and here she is there is nobody to testify against her there is absolutely no witnesses to say been there in the wind when they are standing up that day - Miriam if there is any calls why these two should not be joined in matrimony please let him speak at this time but all the voices that was against her had been silenced hey man the shout had brought down the walls and it's silenced all the voices that was against her there was no one there to accuse her and in the midst of that time here she is through and by her union with Salman she's brought into citizenship through and by the spiritual ordained channels of marriage you also seen how Jezebel tried to enter in Jezebel did not enter in through the right spiritual channels it looked as though it was but yet it was not she and they have come together for political purposes oh ma what a what a what a detriment look at this in verse 20 you are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone you see this is why if a person looks at their foundation and they look at where it is within their life and then they look and say well I don't believe God does this anymore I don't believe we need this anymore I don't believe these things then you need to check what foundation are you standing on because the Holy Spirit listen to me now the Holy Spirit is a placer he will place you he's the only one that can place you in the body he's the only one that can establish you and I he's the only one that can settle us he's the only one that can really truly ground you and I you believe that the whole spirit does not produce wandering the Holy Spirit brings settled miss he is the very rest the Sabbath of God to bring rest in Christ and to bring rest and placement even in this life so to think of this here this is how God works you you see it all the way through the Old Testament I don't have time to deal with all of that but you see how that the Holy Ghost will work within this that replaces us upon the foundation you see friends this is why that that many times down through that the whole ages where spirits have wanted to come in and try to move people away from the word and where they're standing oh let me tell you something a real true messenger never ever has ever taken anybody away from the scriptures it has never taken anybody and said this doesn't need to be anymore listen man none on the contrary a messenger sent by God is one sent from God with a message and if he's got a message there's an intended audience for that message that's going to hear it and heed to it and they by listening to that word coming under submission and obedience to that word are established in Jesus Christ that's a real purpose of a message so when people say I don't believe in certain things no more eugen to check your foundation verse 21 in whom all the building fitly framed together the whole building not just us Ephesus all the way on down its fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom he also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit hey men look at this and he of Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 for we are his workmanship listen all of us have thank God for the ministry ministries know know that you said under maybe a ministry that here you were in a camp somewhere one or more thank God for that ministry and how it helped you but remember it was still the Holy Spirit's not a man it's the Holy Spirit that moves it's him doing the work upon our lives we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works my created on in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in there Omaha I think of how the Prophet at the end of rising of the Sun all he says how are we going to do this how is this word going to be glorified within us he said I'll tell you how we're ordained for that word to be glorified through our lives it's us taking a hold of that word it's not by my efforts it's by my yielding not my efforts not my Aegis MMus but his presence comes to say just rest this word created it means to make habitable it's the same word that's used the linkage is used in terms of proprietorship where it's not a partnership it's a proprietorship the one who owns the business he's the stockholder of the business he's the worm that is absolutely responsible for any loss in the business he's responsible for all the gain in the business he is sole proprietor and the Holy Ghost oh my he hath created we are under the sole proprietorship of Almighty God in Christ Jesus he is responsible fooling for our lives no repeater God it's not me that's responsible he's responsible are you with me he's responsible when there's something that's needed in my life maybe it's something I need to make right maybe something you need to make right you realize he's responsible to bring about in my life to where there's awareness of it and there's also that where it's able to stretch and be able to make it right cuz this old flesh better you don't like the stretch but it ain't the flesh stretching it's a hard he put in there you know her to be to God notice this Ephesians 5:23 let's look at this a little more for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ as the head of the church and he is the savior of the body Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the body the church so the church is his body but it's not this body his body remember Adams body that which have become out of him his attributes his gene that which God opened up the side of Adam and he took out of Adam a helpmate and when he brought her to him she's bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man she is the womb that he might reproduce himself in don't you realize that it is that see that cell that was ordained of God that was the womb that Christ Himself was able to bring forward and so his image on the inside amen that heart that new bottle that he could put that new wine on the inside makes you jump sometimes makes you shout sometimes and other times it gives you the ability to stretch once you're glad for that he's the head of his jeans his body his attributes 2nd Corinthians 5:16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh he ain't though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more same old temple but new creation on the inside his fourth we know no man after the flesh therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new glory be to God look at this now in the message Great Commission he said when you're sick in your physical body until this body has been redeemed it's subject to sickness again but it's got to die it's got a parish so did the soul have to perish the thoughts the soul is the nature of the spirit and those thoughts and so forth in you had to perish before the new man could be born into you to make you a new creature in Christ brother Bram is dealing with with a brother here in Word made flesh India trip I know many of you have no doubt you've read this and this brother he's he's searched all over the place something has touched his heart how God touched his heart and touched his life and he searched all over the place I I want Christ I want Christ so you know he went to this camp they said you got to speak in tongues they went to this camp you got a shout you meant he went all these all these different places and finally they told him they said look you need to go see brother Branham you need to see a Prophet's what you need I'm glad we all needed to see a prophet in this generation I said we all needed to see a prophet in this generation to be able to take us in the pathway of the new birth aren't you glad and here he stands and brother BAM begins to explain it in this way he talks about he says now for you he said in your life he said you don't need a prophet he said what it was that he said that in your life he said at one time you were this certain certain way and and you used to do those certain things he said what happened to that he said well brother and me said it just changed he said it just gone from my life brother said you you you normally said these things would be done he said but something has taken place he said see brother he said you've had it the whole time he said the problem was you just wasn't straightened out in the beginning you realized this is why what I'm saying we needed a prophet within this hour listen friends there's only one true reality that'll tell you whether you've got the Holy Ghost or not the message will clearly reveal that to you and I it will make it known through our lives I know that sounds awful simple but brother Graham goes into and he puts it like this before I read you the quote he said now think of a pig now every one of us have seen pigs and and sheep and things like that and maybe you grew up on a farm or whatever if you took a pig you could scrub that pig up man you could I mean buttermilk bathe them and everything man put a bow tie on them you could do everything with that pig but that pig the first moment you lift that door be cracked that pig will be right inside there there's fresh mud out there and I'm in here you see why it's still a nature you can clean it out but it's still the nature but the first crack that pig will be gone if it'll take right back out because it's still a nature within it it can't help that it's a nature that was there but you take for example the spirit there if we could say like this of a lamb you would take out the spirit of a lamb and you put that in a pig you might see that outer form of a pig but you'll never catch that pig if it's got a lamb spirit on the inside it will not be rolling around in mud it will not be longing to go back out there you might see the form of a pig but you think something's different about this pig what's different about it if we can say we know how animals don't have souls but its spirit is different and that's the same way within a you and I as a believer there had to come a change of nature on the inside if it wasn't the change of nature it's things were just kind of looking at it and just being haled around but remember he gives us a new spirit you feel the release he gives us a new heart that's flexible that when the word is being preached that you can say a man's or the word that then he might put that new wine only inside of his life and then that life going to work and living itself out through you Oh glory be to God and this is where the Prophet said his thoughts talking to this man he said what happened his thoughts changed something does it for him as a man thinketh in his heart Christ the Creator come to him in a steel form and created truth came to him in a steel form and created his own spirit took the man's nature away to love dancing and the world and carrying on and from that time he just laid it aside and was hungry after God God was in him all the time it was God in the beginning hearing recognizing acting on the Word of God the libram says this is what's the matter today you can't get up at the altar and say well hallelujah hallelujah Lord I want the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah no but brothers sister when the Holy Ghost has inspired that word to you you'll get it before you leave your seat something in you will burn up hallelujah it's got to be the inspired word even when a person when would would would be inspired to come here and to pray whether it's here or in the other meeting it must be the word that is inspired to your heart but your ass it's the word dealing with the heart it's the word dealing with the life I think sometimes we've made too many things traditions we've made things traditions we've made it in in manners of things aware well it has to be in a church and it has to be in an altar it has to be there listen friends there's many many quotes and it's understanding how the Holy Spirit would bring all of those things together the Holy Ghost in this hour never spoke through the Prophet to create a tradition let me tell you what the real experience does you know that you've passed from death unto life it because it's more it's more than a sensation it's something that you realized hey you know what there's a greater working on the inside of me like that little spring the Prophet talked about and said why are you bubbling the way you bubble is it because the deer come and drink from you is it because this happens and he said if it had a voice it would say no it's not because you not because any of the animals there is a force that is behind me that's a real reality you know you know you pass from death unto life Christ has become alive he said the preacher won't have to tell you to do this and that the old leaves will just pop off I like these simple terms the old leaves will just pop off and new leaves will come on they've never seen new leaves sometimes I go out and look at even looking at the little plants it's done you see them little things sometimes I wonder deer been chewing on them I'm looking at them and I think we're that deer is that nubbins there but you know them little things are wound up so tight but give it a little bit of water keep on giving a little bit of water and that life you'll eventually start seeing it moving out there and there they leave starts swelling up a little bit more so you know that ain't no nothing there's a leaf coming on there and as it keeps going sucking in that water or you don't see it you don't hear it bringing in that water that's an invisible something that's going on on the inside a man there are capillaries that are ordained within that tree the root system that's below the ground is actually drawing like a straw it's drawing the nutrients and the water up into itself it is producing that's going on and you start to see that belief it's opening up old leaves plop all things pass away well do I have to pluck the leaves off no no the life moving within your head oh it causes the old leaves to plop off and then new leaves come on the tree it's inspired to you then oh my then they have just a little bit more time Kenna let's go to Ephesians four let me skip a few places here I'm coming down I know you're used to hearing that your private thing yeah right verse 20 of Ephesians 4 I'll skip a few verses here here Paul is speaking to the ephesian church and he's speaking of how he's admonishing them in the difference of how that they should not walk in the vanity of their mind as other Gentiles he says in verse 20 you have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man I love this put on means sink into sink into your memory Elijah was ordained by God to take the mantle that was upon the Elijah and finish out what God had told Elijah God never gave any new commands it was the finishing out of what had been given five things that Elijah was to do Elijah was the vessel that carried out the majority of that is that right God's ordained way the words going to be fulfilled because it wasn't man that was fulfilling it it's the same spirit of god through yielded vessels that's why in this hour it's not a new message that we didn't need a new message right now we don't need a new message we don't need one there's the same spirit of god that is spoke the word that is making that word come to pass and live out in our lives it's not us doing it brother brand me wooden brother branham doing it he said I'm just happened to be here when he comes he's letting us know it's a yield at all of those statements are letting you and I know it's a yield it surrendered life and God begins to move down and move right through there now look at this put on this to sink into it lashes they didn't cut down the road they didn't cut down the mantle but Elijah had to grow into it you don't tailor the this robe this mantle is not tailored it's not oh let me see let me get a measurement here and let's see do you want your how do you want your trouser sir do you want him with a brake on the front brake on the back you want a flat do you want cuffs in them how do you want how do how do you want to know this is where our lives are tailored we're ordained to be conformed to his image so he helps us to wear that we grow into this this is put on means to sink into that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness in that wonderful this new man now here that new bottle now it has new wine on the inside it's a new creation not not of the old creation but of a new creation let's look here in Colossians 3 verse 8 Paul picks us up again on the old man and the new man verse 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth this is skin stretching put off these currently no I'm talking about its stretching it calls you to stretch malice isn't and what you say malice is things you think is that right I'm not going to ask you how many's had to repent of that but even Paul when Paul would in another place ravine out of Ephesians four Paul was admonishing the saints of God he's not speaking to unbelievers he's not speaking to the make believers this is to the believers who have access to the divine nature of God because it's dwelling on the inside of them they have a power and authority to put these off also if they've got authority to put them off where would these things be coming from not from the new bottle with a new wine but it's still out here this thing where Paul could say I pack it around when I would go to do good evil is present is that right look at this put them also off so we've got to have strength and authority to be able to do this verse nine why not one to another seeing that you have put off you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian Scythian bond nor free but Christ is all and in all verse 12 oh boy here's some real stretcher put on therefore as the elect of God now wait a minute I've already put on the new man but now put on sink in into therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved boughs of mercy kindness humbleness of mine meekness long-suffering bow say help me Lord help me Lord Jesus help me help me to sink into sink into what is it submit to it you or me neither one is going to be able to stop you don't stop thoughts from flying in you don't stop that but you can stop them from roosting and this is where the scripture can say this to me when I read these scriptures right here this is an access that belongs to the elect of God it is an access that we have as the elect of God put on holy vows of mercy this vows of mercy it speaks of the spleen in our life to where there can be damaged blood cells and things that's moving through our body but that spleen will catch damaged cells and it will capture them they can't pass through certain channels it will capture them it sends them off into a certain place and they go through a recycling because they will not be allowed to continue on in the body that way Oh God I thank God for the real bowels of Mercy within our life and we're really yield to it friends and really yielding to this it helps us that thoughts and feelings and no matter what's been said or what's been done how he can help you and I so that damage cells are not passed through the rest of our body forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a court against any even as Christ forgave you so also do this a powerful statement he didn't say just forgive even as even as to the same the same depth how can you and I do that can you do it can I do it no I'm just saying for you you can't do it neither can i this is where we have to sink into these places we have to sink into it the salmon sometimes thoughts come but it's not about the thoughts coming remember reject them things right back out when in your heart your heart has been cleared your heart has been purified hey listen Satan will try to stir up things again in your mind but this is where that in when it comes in that's already under the blood you're not bringing that up against my brother against my sister you're not bringing that up you're not no no no this is where we need stretching this isn't jumping and above all these things sink in to put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful here's a key right here for the sinking in to let the word of Christ dwell in you richly you know you want every part of your life you want these things to be really under the governance and subjection of the Holy Ghost this is a key right here letting the word dwell in us richly in all wisdom not just word dwelling in us but in wisdom remember what wisdom not earthly earthly wisdom is sensual earthly wisdom sides but that wisdom that comes from above is full of mercy that wisdom itself Held's within it virtue for you and not to be able to live it gives us strength oh my sometimes these things come around our way come on not just once in a while this is everyday everyday living stretching you know when you read scriptures like this we read them about forgiving there's gonna have to be incidents that come to test you on it test me on it God does not give it he just did not admonish us in this way because well you'll be immune to it you'll never have any problems you've been born again I don't have to deal with any of this it where my soul my soul your soul you've been born again of the Spirit of God my soul has never ever held anything against anybody but my mind and in my spirit and in my heart been many times cleansing cleansing sometimes there's things that we need to be cleansed of that were not even aware of it but you get before God in prayer and the Holy Ghost can move right down and say this is still in your heart you had him do that to you he's praying about a situation at one time oh god I was really crying out to God about a situation and the Holy Spirit just came right down and met me right there in the room and said before this can never happen you got to change your heart right there it was right there as soon as he spoke that to me it was release right there as soon as I could say that it was release right there because I realized it wasn't this person or it wasn't this it was here it was here but thank God thank God for His grace that I could stretch it could be moved thank God when the Holy Spirit can move down upon our life and say hey hey it's not that individual it's your bitterness Oh God Lord Jesus you see friends this is why we we need we need him to speak to us because so easily things can we can get to looking at things in one Avenue in one angle but all my how that when he comes and he speaks to us he's able to reveal and go in there to a depth and we see it as we ought to see it and when we see it like that and let it in and let it take it say Lord come Lord Jesus the reality is I know it simple I know it's a simple point we cannot do this in our own strength we cannot but the same me I've been born again of the Spirit of God that's why you need his strength we need his strength and he helps us to sink into that clothing there might be things you're looking at and you see overcoming oh my for many of us it's not about drinking it's not about smoking it's not about running around but overcoming is still putting our arm in one sleeve and giving our hand into his hand and let him put it in the other sleeve that's overcoming overcoming is not me and you muscle in our way into it overcoming it's saying here Papa you got my hand you teach me Lord how to do this help me know how to do it Lord and that's all he wants it's sinking in to this cloth this clothing this garment let me tell you something you're ordained to wear this garment yes you are you are deign to wear it this garment it was kept up for you brother and sister prodigal and his servants he sent his servants and said go get the best robe put it on him put shoes on their feet put a ring on the finger you are deigned for this robe oh my what love say Lord you think of this God doesn't come to create tenseness he comes to move and COO upon our lives but for the Bram said it like this he said standing right here he said along this altar he said there are these new bottles he said there's been filled with new wine and they're standing here because they believe that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said season the Holy Spirit as cooed that word upon your life he said and here they are they're flexible they're standing on that word you are deigned ordained for this and he brings you and I in the condition in that wonderful I know it's simple but that's exactly what he's doing he's a real husband husband he draws us let's pray or Jesus or through the simpleness and foolishness of preaching you chose to save souls father through this simplicity you choose and you've chosen Lord as you speak to our hearts this is one of the avenues Lord you'll minister to us father I pray this morning Lord God as we Lord take into consideration Lord in our lives Lord Jesus not for one moment do we take this for granted but father from the depths of our lives Lord God as we fellowshipped around this word here this morning Lord father we truly identify that you are the one who's transformed us Lord that old man that old Nature has passed away

for every every one of us Lord that has been fully born again I pray that God as your word has spoke to us this morning Lord and calling us Lord Jesus admonishing us Lord we want to fall deeper in love with you Lord father this this garment Lord to think is Paul by the Spirit of God could speak to us as sons and daughters of God and admonish us to put off certain things and to put on other things and then to say put on as the elect of God Oh father Lord we need your help Lord aha Lord God I I've tried many times to put the coat on I've tried times in my life to put on the coat of forgiveness I've tried many times the Lord to put on the coat Lord God of different things or that that code of charity the Lord Jesus in my strength I cannot do it but I need your help Lord Jesus I look at the resource the virtue already that we have on the inside of us a desire that has been raised up and quickened Lord the desire that we have that burns within our hearts Lord God it is a flame with your life desire to please you lord help us lord help us each and every one Lord God that in our lives more in our hearts that with that garment Lord God wear that our arms our hands are guided

reason Lord God that we live and can live in overcoming life the reason Lord God the Lord if there would be something wrong in our life or God and what do you give us the strength to be able to stretch or god help us support what do we love the times when we can jump shout we feel that stimulation of that new wine moving in our lives the Lord how that the desire there are things that come our way sometimes Lord there's things that come our way that we can say why did this have to happen why did they have to say this so why didn't this been Lord all of those things as your prophet told us when he took a town in his own life people asked him it said how in the world can you take these trials like that he said that was ordained before the world to give me a trial or Jesus he looked to you that you would help I pray this morning Lord God you're here to help each and every one of us support God you're Helder here Lord to minister to our lives lord ah I don't know the specific needs but you do you do not and I pray right now that father would that you would just move right up next every heart as you've been right through your word father just so personal between each and every one the Lord that cool band of Lord moving Lord God right there upon their life and Lord to where it becomes such an echo a voice blending together to where they can say I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me help us lord I pray this is our desire Lord these places we once lived in these places but we no longer live here we no longer live down malice alley we no longer live in a home place of hating one another we don't live there at all God neither do we want to yield our members to unrighteousness neither do we want sin to reign in our mortal body now we have been Mohnish
