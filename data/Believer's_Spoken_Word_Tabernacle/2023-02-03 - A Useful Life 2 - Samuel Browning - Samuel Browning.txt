house of the Lord I want to remind you to sign up for the Christian family event we will be having there on that Saturday in March I believe it's March the 25th 25th I had so many dates in front of me but March 25th and I'm really I'm really looking forward to that and uh so if I have to bring that sign up sheet to your front door I'll do it it'd be easier if you sign up here that way I don't have to come to your front door hey I had somebody come to my front door today my wife said who was that I was sitting in the dining room and finishing a little bit of preparation I said you don't want to know I said you get mad at me if I tell you I said who was it sweet little girl I opened the door she just she said Girl Scout cookies for sale but I overcame I told my wife I said see when I tell you I told you you'd get upset but I'm glad that God comes and knocks on our door aren't you I just want to make sure my door is facing the right way right lot turned his tent door to face Sodom and eventually what his door opened to eventually overtook him but Abraham had his door facing in the right direction amen it was the right direction that's the same way that God had visited him time and time again so he turned his house God came right down that same way oh what a difference it made that day aren't you glad for that A man also wanted to announce there's going to be a Brother's Fellowship breakfast there at Cracker Barrel in Sandusky Ohio and you might be wondering where the brothers that had set that up well we've got brothers that travel from over that way and from Toledo and everywhere else so amen so we just thought we would just have a fellowship over there I'm not going to ask because I know you all like to eat [Music] and uh so the the directions or as far as the address and I know they're just for everybody here you know there are places Beyond Lorraine right Lorraine's not the United States of America right right might be your day I know how am I gonna I'm leaving Lorraine some people feel that way when they say I'm coming to Lorraine [Music] I hope I don't offend you Jesus had a sense of humor humor right it's okay to lighten up and we have good things in store so wonderful to serve the Lord and just my the presence of the Lord so sweet as I sit back there tonight and my just looking over these things and thinking what God has laid on our hearts and just the thought that we want to continue with tonight and I just would say this I'm going to start into a little bit of this tonight this has been there's been a message I've really been just drawn to for some time and uh I just say think that it would be good if you have a time and a moment to listen to it and it's the message that day on Calvary what a powerful message well I don't know there's not one that's not powerful but it's challenging I think the word of God it comes to us and it it challenges us [Music] we just love him don't we such a wonderful presence of the Lord wonderful presence wonderful presence Hallelujah could we just stand not so good to see each and every one of you God bless you efforts and labor coming out being in the house of God may God richly bless you amen tonight amen as we just go to the Lord in prayer maybe as our heads are bowed if you have a need you'd want to make known before the Lord and say Lord I have need tonight I'm asking that you're passed by my way you just want to make it known by an uplifted hand Lord I invite you more than just to my Pew but to my heart come speak to me Lord tonight [Music] let's go talk to Papa now Heavenly Father to thank Lord the greatest Delight the desire that you have had from before the foundation of the world is to come down and to have Fellowship with your children Lord the attributes the thoughts of your mind o God the thoughts of yourself becoming tangible and to think how that Lord you would come down in the evening time in the cool of the evening and you would begin to walk through the garden oh what a moment Lord if we could describe it in this way of excitement and joy that it would be that you would be coming down as Adam and Eve Adam would take her by the hand say you know it's about that time even though they were in eternity but it was something about it Lord a moment they were no this is Drawing Near to that moment that Papa's going to come down and speak to us and Lord you would come in such a personal way as your Prophet would dramatize it you would speak to them and you would ask them personally have you enjoyed your stay on Earth today my children God you would come and minister Lord after the fall you made a way that we can have fellowship with you you made a way through the shedding of the blood of an innocent one that we could fellowship with you Lord that we could hear your voice that we could walk in Divine favor Lord your God and for the all-sufficient sacrifice of calvary now here we are gathered Lord here this evening oh my how the scripture said you love to dwell in the Praises of your people Lord we come with a praise in our heart no matter what we're going through no matter what we feel we come with the praise you're worthy it's a sacrifice Lord sometimes this praise Has Come Easy other times Lord It's a sacrifice but no matter what Lord and no matter where we might be we invite you that you would just come Lord come down lord May the same presence of God that's here so sweetly and so precious right now would you just walk down every aisle move on every heart behind and minister to every need in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you musicians thank you tonight amen Job chapter 22 and I'm going to go back to the verse and scriptures that we've read the other night and just want to kind of move forward a little bit more as the Lord will help us on this thought and we begin speaking on this thought last week and just as the Lord would press upon our hearts that is on a useful life a useful life in job 22 verse 1. then he life as the team and I'd answered and said can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself is that any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gained to him that thou makeest thy ways perfect will he reprove thee for fear of Thee will he enter with thee into judgment may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just draw our attention to this word in verse 2. that's a pretty it's a pretty big question can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself now we all know as we look at it in this scripture as it would speak it's it's actually saying in this way if you allow me to paraphrase it in this in this manner or to just place the words out for us can a man be useful be of a service to God as he that is wise wherein his wisdom would be useful to himself and I think of our wisdom how is our wisdom useful to ourselves how many times that we have talked with someone else and we can just speak of this even in the natural there's a lot of times that even since um my dad has went on home to be with the Lord I've had to call a lot of times different Brothers in the church and ask them how do I do this how do I approach this I know we got YouTube videos but sometimes YouTube Just it doesn't beat the in flesh thing and so when I ask certain things because there's little things that even as they're instructing you and we all know how the YouTube video is we look for the shortest one let's get to the point on this but there's things we like to know because there's things that one might be able to share with us in the midst of that time not only are they instructing or helping us to be able to do a job but also to help us to know these are some things I've learned these are some things that'll make it easier these are some things that can help out and that wisdom that we receive from someone else benefits us it benefits our life and so this is how the question that's being asked can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself and we remember looking at this last week and I maybe to Define that word profitable just for a moment it means to be of use or to be of a service to be of a prophet to one or a benefit to be used or exhibit you sir show harmony with be familiar with or to know intimately can a man be profitable unto God just like that as he that would have wisdom and be that wisdom would be useful to himself and remember what our what our answer was last week the answer is yes and no because they're like the scripture says from the book of Isaiah Paul would pick it up in the book of Corinthians who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him job even understood this even as he would express it here in in in in in the Book of Job so we understand it's not us telling God and God doesn't want us to tell him what to do and we looked at certain examples even of that in last week and God doesn't need he doesn't need our help our thoughts about things or about how to run his program and that's that's one of the greatest things in victories that comes into our life and that we must continue to live by that sometimes that's a that's that's easier done in one life maybe than another and it doesn't raise one life or lower one life but within it all the thing that we come to continually daily and Moment by moment is we are continually brought back to dying daily to ourselves that God might have his way and the reality of real of maturity you've heard me say this over and over that real maturity is not something to wear that we become more self-sufficient more independent but real maturity is recognizing the god that's in US and submitting ourselves to him and anytime we get out of that realm is where we get in trouble right those are the things we get out into and we've got to say forgive me right whether it's someone else or to the Lord and this is why real Victory is living from that Victory on the inside and so when we see this God's desire is to use a man for his glory not that the man would get Glory because remember brother says God has a hard time getting a hold of a man using that man and then that in itself keeping him in a place of humility that's why the brother Brandon would admonish us concerning where Paul was in the dust uh on the road to Damascus and he says You must never ever rise above that dust on the road to Damascus in other words we're not walking around with uh uh I'm going to say it in the right way we're not walking around with the thought of I'm nothing I can do nothing because let me just tell you what that is that's false humility that's called Pride we just want to expose the devil is that right sometimes we get in this oh I can't do nothing we really don't believe that I really can't do nothing I can't do but see that's not what what it is this is what that's what brother random tells us that that's where we make excuses for our weaknesses when all God wants us to do is to acknowledge Him in his presence and surrender him Hallelujah and God doesn't come to strip the weaknesses away from our life he says I just want them to be channels that my strength can come through so God desires to use man for his glory and his desires that we would surrender ourselves and yield Our Lives to the working of his program hey go back to these scriptures here that we were looking at last week because this is the same uh individual and I would just lay this down once again just this little bit this is the same individual in life as that is speaking to job and here in the previous chapter he said something very similar behold speaking of God behold he puteth no trust in his Saints yea the heavens are not clean in his sight and there is there's truth in there but remember it's important that truth is applied correctly because if we are his Saints remember we were always his Saints from the mind of God so we we always were a part of God then what is God putting trust in because remember this is only a veil can I say the words of the prophet he said what we do when we fellowship with one another we're not fellowshipping with this we're fellowshipping with the attribute of God in one another that's brothers and sisters it's not this it's that on the inside that's a part of the same family tree it's that part on the inside that God has confidence in behold job 4 18 it's the same same brother he lifes behold he put no trust in his servants well in one way this film take a rocket scientist but it's his Saints his servants God has already laid claim on them they are the Sanctified ones by his presence we are his servants by his working for his glory this is why think of the messages brother random would preach my servant David my servant job him would preach just those messages titled in that way because it is God's servants that's what I want to be now think of this you see neither none of them including job know this conversation and this conversation that actually took place where that the Lord where he called and God began to brag upon job and he said hast thou considered my servant job God was taking claim on job Glory there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man I wish I could preach right now one that feareth God and askeweth Evil now there's no doubt think of them think of how brother Graham says Satan stands there before the throne as an accuser of the Brethren right so Satan can be their accusing but God here is looking at job because job's faith and confession remains in the sacrifice you say you mean to tell me the job didn't do any wrong but if his confession and his repentance is in the sacrifice then God is looking at the sacrifice I'm glad about that aren't you I'm grateful for the grace of God tonight now think about this how brother random would say this and Brian I'll just alert you or she's not is she here praise the Lord I'll alert you Brianna when I when I want you on this but I want to just let me just kind of you just listen to this statement here I want to just read a few things where brother Ram's talking about God's confidence in you and I'm just reading about this and and I don't have this one on the board but here he says said uh have Satan is talking to God and saying oh sure you give him everything he wants and you've got him all edged up and everything no wonder he serves you sure he can serve you making plenty of money got plenty of cattle got everything in life anybody can serve you like that but if you let me have him I'll make him curse you to his face and God said I don't believe it Hallelujah God said I don't believe it he said could he have that confidence in you and I tonight where the accusation that Satan could come and yet God could say I don't believe it amen I just want to read a few of these here notice in Fellowship about Redemption God knowing the heart job had only one way that's through Fellowship through the shedding of the blood he had talked to God he knowed that he was God had confidence in job why because he had had fellowship with job so God's confidence is based on his fellowship with his children my my brother said oh me the Branham Tabernacle see today that the only way God can have confidence in you is not because you do something or with your faith you do something remember if I got faith to move mountains on and on but when you have Fellowship how do we have Fellowship we have Fellowship under the blood is that right now notice if we look at this of how that God we want God to put uh confidence and God to put confidence in us and out of the message here you him how many knows that there is a growth yes amen there is growing now Brothers is speaking here he says the holy spirit's bringing word to Heaven how that you're progressing in your growth if you go back out in the world then God can't put much confidence in you if you're up and down and say this one thing yeah that's it you're following little Clicks in the church you're fussing fighting gambling bat biting how can the church ever go on now think of it brother man would go on to say in one of the same messages of hear ye him and I want to just say this like this in the message hear ye him you will find how the prophet is being led by God to speak to lives that have been drawn and they have come to Christ they have accepted salvation and they're on their way into a full reconciliation and Redemption where the Holy Spirit becomes the Seal of their life because just to accept Christ is not the new birth are you hearing me that's a start the Bible said man believeth with the heart unto salvation right and that the faith of God is revealed from righteousness unto righteousness right this is why brother Adam said if a man he said even if he might be a Catholic Methodist or whatever and brother Brown It's been extended extensive time and laying this out even through the seals if it is a Catholic man and it's trusting in Jesus Christ for its salvation he is saved now he didn't say he's in the bride because remember for the bride it's got to be that of the blood has been fully applied and she is him on display right and I'm glad that ain't up to me to decide who is and who is it but if we just preach a word because the message that God has given me to preach is the call from the other side it is a message that calls to the Bride of Jesus Christ to make yourself ready and who's going to make themselves ready only the bride will respond to that call nobody else will right I would love for everybody you say how do you preach it I preach it as though it's for everybody because I don't know who he is and who is not years and time and how long it takes for somebody to even come to that place that is not in my hands that is in the hands of God [Applause] this is why brother Randall could say when he's talking about being in the family of God because let me just pause this eyes he brings me back to this point that we there is a growing where the holy spirit is dealing with our lives even in a life that has accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior right now Savior and they might still have all kinds of habits in their life because they're still what made them do it in the beginning is still there that's where sanctification has to come in Sanctified by the blood Jesus suffered without the gate that he might sanctify the church is that right it's the blood that sanctifies cleanses out all the habits all the filth all the desires and the Holy Spirit comes to Crown his work with by feeling filling that life now I want you to think of it like this there's also a growth within our lives lives that have been that have been born again how many knows there still are growing going on right Paul over and over it's how would you with abound in faith I would you would abound more in love because so it's a desire for continuing growth and and this is one of the uh you know one of the greatest statements that when you come to the end of first Corinthians 15 we always look at oh that this corruptible shall put on incorruption but the very last scripture there says I would that you be abounding in the work of the Lord Oh Glory so we ain't sitting around drinking sweet tea and waiting on the rapture hello we're abounding in the work of the Lord and really remember it's not us telling God what to do but it's us surrendering and letting God achieve what he has desired to achieve oh glory be to God now think of this it's your character your conduct that gives God confidence in you well how what is our character affected by it's affected by him is to be molded by him so what's God putting confidence in he's putting confidence in that life that is submitting to him and it's it's responding to the word and God is putting confidence think of this God allows tests and trials to come along every one of us we can Fellowship on this I remember when I first got started in serving the lord or when God first got a hold of my life there was some tests there were some things that came my way and you know what Satan's purpose was when I think back on it I've said this over and over was to try to shake me and to see am I really tied to that which is real in genuine is there something that means more to me it can take the very things that's so meaningful the things that we think anybody know what I'm talking about this is why brother random would talk about he said was yes as soon as you give your life to the Lord he said as soon as the holy spirit moves in your life he said you can expect family and everything else to turn against you but it's not them it's not them it's the enemy God's permitting it to do what only prove you that the grounds you're standing on it ain't you holding on but it's God that's got to hold on you oh my mama it's your character your conduct that God that gives God confidence in you now this is why brother Brown would go on and he would make a statement and he would say now that's what God's desire is to have a real confidence in us and he says the real love of God here in the message hear you him the real love of God is waiting for you where God can get into you and have confidence in you so the love of God is God's confidence in you my mama does he speak to you then he's got confidence or by the same I haven't always responded I haven't all but does he speak to you if he speaks to you let me tell you something there is nobody mandating God to talk to you or me if he's talking to you talking to me it ain't because we're worthy it ain't because that we've done something it's because he loves you and no matter how many times you don't let him in Hallelujah surely goodness and mercy shall run after me or can I say it the way it is and the where it will chase after me all the days of my life and let me tell you something you can outrun a lot of things but you can't outrun the choosing of God and the goodness and mercy of almighty God hmm the real love of God is waiting for you where God can get into you and have confidence in you he said like I would my wife or you would your wife I don't care how many men would come up it wouldn't bother me she don't care how many women would be around that don't bother her we got love and confidence and the only way you can have confidence is to have love and the only way you can believe God and take him for your healing whatever you're taking him for is because you love him right if you love me keep my Commandments Hallelujah love is the key for every promise of God well brother's name I can't muster up enough love he ain't expecting you because you your love will never do it but it must be his love he loved us first right it ain't that I got to give my love up to his level it is that really it is my love submitting to the love of God and then it becomes God's love moving me beyond my fears beyond my doubts Beyond unbelief it becomes his love that's motivating me oh my and then you got confidence in him that he won't lie to you he promised he'd do it how many ever prayed for something and you had to wait for it okay about five of you I know we're living in an age of instant instant instant dear Lord don't let us see that spinning color wheel on our Mac don't let us see that spinning thing don't let us get outage by Spectrum maybe if your healing's ungered a little bit God's got confidence in you that you hold on God's got confidence in you you can look at you I don't even got that kind of confidence in me no but he does he does and he'll keep encouraging you and strengthening you and here you are standing here praying prayer requests after prayer request life do the right and said the same prayer request you're still praying the same prayer why because you know that God answers prayer because sometimes what we're looking for they may not be answered in my presence but God always answers prayer I think our brother Branham was baptizing brother Billy Paul in the pool and brother Branham says oh God let Hope look over the banister of time where the prayer has been answered right here this morning Hallelujah Glory oh my let me go on he said when it looks like everything has gone wrong anybody ever had that you probably say had it got it when it looks like everything has gone wrong God is giving you a trial because he dislikes you he thinks little of you well that's my own fabricated version isn't it he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hot blood plant a hybrid you're a real Christian God is giving you a test to see what you'll do about it no wonder Peter said these fiery trials wow count it as Joy it's more precious to you than gold and many times we oh Lord here we're going to repent while we read it we him and Hall or hauling him right like years and years ago I remember I think it wasn't 96 sitting there and you know the first time I ever heard brother Donnie say it when he said you know he said many of us want a testimony he said but here's the way we go about it test I moaning and complainy and groanie and grumbly all the time testimony come on now oh we just gotta let everybody know on Facebook we're having a bad day right ain't no wrong wanting a little bit of empathy sympathy or whatever more right but you know that's a part what is it that feels that way if you're a real child of God that ain't your soul that feels that way it's our flesh and it's our spirit let me tell you what a trial does it exposes the weakness that we are encompassed with God knows how to get our attention that hey this ain't about you you ain't holding you I'm the one that's holding you and the trial is all about God's desire to use us more oh my we him and Hall well that's something God give you to overcome he knows you'll do it imagine we're surrounded by a host of angels and what's more what's most important the author and the finisher of our faith is rooting for us Lord I don't feel like I'm going You're Gonna Go I don't feel like that you're gonna do it he knows you'll do it does he know that because you're a part of him and he never gave up he never quit when it looked Bleak and dark come on now when he was building his Masterpiece and you had Noah that died there like that but God didn't give up at all God didn't throw up his hands and say what in the world am I going to do but God said before I build this masterpiece I'm gonna take four pedestals and I am going to build it upon Faith love Mercy Perfection or faith love Grace and Perfection I'm gonna build it on that because my church will be built upon my faith my love my grace and my perfection whoa now job was useful like this right here this is useful to me sure don't make them like they used to but it's useful to me seemed like they used to be thicker now if you want better examples you pray and ask God say God's smarten him up some so I can get some better examples but there's things that's useful right I mean I've had to use a screwdriver but you know the thing for a screwdriver if I walked over that screwdriver and it stood up and told me you don't need me you can't use me right but screwdriver don't do that does it it's an instrument that can be used when it's needed and that's how God wants us to be when he needs a screwdriver he can get it the hammer he can get it the wrench he can get it so God doesn't God doesn't look at a bunch of a toolbox if we're all tools in the box and God's not looking at like we're a bunch of you know little kids in the classroom me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me you know that's always funny you know when I would ask those questions in class me me everybody wanted to do it on certain things but when you asked him about other things no hands will go up it's kind of like us isn't it there are certain things that God said okay here's the deal who wants to walk on water tomorrow Lord Jesus I humbly accept your requests Lord I'll do it Lord God in place of all the rest of these people here but what if he says who would like to go through a hard trial Lord I prefer my brother Lord I prefer my sister Lord is that right come on Friends your flesh is no different than mine right my flesh is not looking around saying Lord where's the next test or next trial coming from so let's look at how that job was useful let's just take a few moments on this job was useful but how was he useful through the sacrifice now let's just let's look at a few scriptures here tonight job 4 verse 3. here's a testimony that is witnessed by his friends they're the ones talking like this behold thou job Hast instructed many and thou Hast strengthened the weak hands wonder where he got that kind of character for who you're spending time with who he was fellowshipping with are you hearing me that's what's really important in our life is about who we spend the time with spending it with the Lord is that right you know brother man tells us that in our lives he said we'll have that sticky carnal nature that'll bother us until we're out here is that right now I realize that I can pray all day long I can pray all night and we should pray without ceasing but I realize it's not going to remove the stickiness but I just pray it makes it like wax on the stickers to where when something comes off it's just like water on my car where that hot waxes went over it beads up and runs right off I trust that God Lord let me get in your presence where my life can be so waxed up with the anointing oil of the spirit of God to where when things want to stick there ain't nothing to stick to in my move down here and move down there but oh there is an anointing oil over the Samuel then in scripture oh but yes it is scripture when Jesus prayed he said our father that are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth even as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever amen and brother by Adam will take that portion of scripture that can deliver us and keep us from evil and he will tie it back into Noah he said when Noah was on the ark and if any little bit of water started to come in he would grab the tar and begin to pitch it right there to prevent that water from coming in and he said that's what prayer does it's pitch on your life against the enemy whoa Hallelujah that was free thank you Lord job 4 4 another testimony witnessed by surrender this ain't even Joe Joe ain't bragging on himself this is a testimony they've all seen okay bad words have uphold in him that was falling and thou has strengthened the feeble needs that's kind of testimony I want it's been a man who's strengthened a life a useful life one who has one that would strengthen the feeble knees job 16 5. now this is Job's own confession I would strengthen you this is what he job was confessing that he would do now we know from previous verses he means it I would strengthen you talking to those friends that were coming against him I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving on my lips should assuage your grief that's what I would do job where is all this with great acts and mighty power that is mighty power to be able to look at a situation and be able to minister Health to be able to minister strength to be able to minister a Word of Deliverance how could he do that by his fellowship with God because you see this confidence that God had in job was not a foreign strange thing job though he didn't hear that conversation but that confidence was in his heart and he walked as a man with a perfect Faith with confidence in God and that's why he could be so yielded the way that he was Joe 29 25 this is another confession from his heart I chose out their way and said it Chief speaking when others would come and dwelt as a king in the Army as one that comforteth the mourners I know there's things sometimes that we look at and we want maybe God and we feel like well if I can't do this you know if I can't preach if I can't sing if I can't do this then God can't use me that's a lie that's not true at all you can be used as much as you will surrender your life to God I'll tell you what why don't we do this stop waiting on somebody else to do a burden that God's put on your heart to do if God's put it on your heart you pray for it and you ask God to equip you and direct you instead of well you know I've been praying about this and I've been how about putting some feet on your prayers and on the burden hello somebody maybe I need to preach this on Sunday maybe we just do we'll just do replay but it's true we need looking at these parts here that even with Comfort now let me just move on here in this in this brother Brown makes a statement I read this to you last week if I won't be the last time you hear it but then Jesus came and called out of the message he said job knowed he had influenced people his life had been useful God never gave us our lives just to hang around this or that he give it to be useful for him I don't want to be one who just hangs around the message I don't want to be one who hangs around bsw2 you know you got like these signs no no you're no loitering I lliter on the grounds of the message now either and neither neither listen to me now neither is God continuing to push us out into something that we're not called to do but I think when God has touched our heart it ought to be something rise from without within us like it did Paul what would you have me do now God may not have you seen may not have you preach but God might choose you to be a witness to your family he might choose you to be a witness on the job you we don't have a choice but I just want to say Lord what you've ordained to use me I'm here I don't want to be a shiny screwdriver I don't want to just be a shiny wrench I want to be one that your hands is being on just like a wrench that's got oil on it I know that man's been using it it's been changing oil filters I want my life covered over with the Fingerprints of the Holy Ghost where God said I've got an instrument I've got somebody that will let me use them but I'm a screwdriver Lord I'm only to put in screws but Lord if you need to use me to pop out a nail on the wall I'm here I may not be a four-way I may be a flathead but I'm here Lord God to be used he give it to be useful for him do something tell somebody else because that's really what it is everything that we do for the kingdom of God it's actually an expression and a telling of somebody else you can talk you can't talk whistle A Hymn or something give some impression somewhere and job was the type of man that was useful that's the type of man I want to be I want to be useful how many want to be useful okay this man was useful this is why those trials came the way they did because you know why he was useful well brother Samuel that don't make sense or it does remember because these trials were not God was against him God was only as the prophet would say approving his servant he would say in another place he's only trying to draw out the qualities that are in The Believer in another place it's only God pruning off the branch so that it will bear more fruit it don't feel it's not it's not joyous is it the trial is not joyous useful so it's to be used for practical purpose in several ways now let's just try to get to this this this little question here tonight how do I become into that place of being useful how do I become into that place just for sake of time if you don't mind I was going to read Matthew 27 that really deals with the crucifixion of where they crucified our Lord but maybe just for sake of time if you allow me just to kind of move through here just a little bit in verse 33 it says when they were coming to the place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they pardoned my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and they sent over his head his accusation written this is Jesus the king of the Jews then there were two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads saying thou that destroys the temple built a in three days save thyself if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise also the chief priest mocking him with the scribes and Elders said he saved himself he saved others pardon me himself he cannot save may I be found to Echo those same words as the prophet would say I'm glad he didn't save himself because if he would have saved himself I could have never been saved Hallelujah oh my God glory be to God he trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said I am the Son of God the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying that is to say my God my God why has Thou forsaken me notice not my father my father what did he do he forsook his sonship in order to make Sinners Sons for he could not remain a son and make sinner Sons but he gave up he gave up he surrendered he did not become sinful he who knew no sin became my sin a man in order for Fellowship to be restored he who was the worthy one he who was the one that was not guilty he surrendered himself in order to take away my guilt oh God no one only let me receive it but let me live that Lord let me live that Lord you know we asked that question what must I do to become useful and really it's the same as job it's through the revelation of God working through the sacrifice in our life but Abraham would say it in this simple way that job actually had more to do than what we do because job had to offer up the burn offering we don't have to offer it up he's been offered up once and for all all that we have to do is accept it not reason with it you can't barter with it God don't want you to barter he paid your debt and my debt he paid what was against us let me tell you something brother Wayne depicted it so clearly when he was up here even when he was preaching that last time there in December that he born this was not what we see on the pictures of the Lord Jesus or the crucifix that that's done to keep and hold the modesty but he was stripped of his garments shame he bore our shame it was shameful enough to look at it as he was but he bore our shame you know what he was saying there'll never be one that could ever say my shame is worse or I've got such shame in my life he bore our shame he bore the offless worse whatever you could imagine is the worst shame he bore it all glory be to God in the highest Hallelujah all we have to do is accept that sacrifice that's been provided for us and it releases to us a liberty to become Sons and Daughters of God Brethren makes a statement he says first this is out of that day on Calvary that message I asked you to listen to at some point brother Perham speaking he says first we should seek what that day meant we're talking about how to become useful right second we should see what that day has done for us what it did for us and third let's look at what we ought to do for that day so he paid I'll let you know on the next one Briana he paid the price when he died at Calvary he made a way for every son and daughter of God to come back home he made a way he gave up the spirit and he poured out his Spirit when he ascended up there he poured it out on the day of Pentecost that's what Calvary means to us it allowed us to follow him because before that time no man could die as far as died to himself the prophets remember God would move on them and they would speak now think of this David would speak my God my God why is Thou forsaken me it was David The Vessel but it was the spirit of God the spirit of Christ speaking through him right so they were able to yield that the spirit of God could speak through their lives but Calvary made a way that a man could come and die to himself to where there was a remedy that was made for the sin question in his life that he could surrender his life and come back across the chasm under the shed Blood by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son and daughter of God Calvary made a way for that aren't you glad for that not one of us was worthy of that right sometimes we're still looking at our unworthiness but remember it's not us that made ourselves Worthy oh to think of that but the man said we got to accept it and to accept it is to accept his person Christ in our heart then we're free from sin there's no more sin shackles hanging on us at all and God just it's like we never sinned the perfect sacrifice made us perfect for being therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect there's no more to be done but we are made perfect in the presence of almighty God that's the powerful thing is to recognize the sufficiency of the grace of God and accept it sometimes that word it sounds so simple to us and it really is it's not you know what complicates it is we get it King in our mind trying to figure it out you can't figure out the pardoning grace of God because let me tell you something it don't make sense you don't deserve it I don't deserve it thank you well I've been a good boy I've been a good girl I've been you don't deserve it it's not anything that we could Merit it's the grace of almighty God but this is where it would sometimes like Brother Brad said we'll lose our position we go to looking back and trying to find out what we have done what we have done but listen God he wants to use us but he don't need our help he just needs our surrender right it's not what what we can do or what I have done and this is why go ahead bran on paragraph 83 look what that day on Calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be a Scarlet they're as white as snow red like Crimson white like snow then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven Anything Is Forgiven is remitting and forgot about let me just just drive this down right now when you have repented of your sins God is not holding your sins over you because you can never walk on the Bible said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you don't remember remit means past sins are cut off because you can't go nowhere if those sins are still hanging on you but there's got to come Grace that ministers to your heart to let you know Jesus Paid It All [Music] and I can rise up and go right toward the promise of God boo devil devil then what does it do it gives you after that condition his Spirit that's what it does it gives you his Spirit after that condition to follow on read this next part with me and to do as he did for others who is following on ah so how do I become useful by dying to myself because the grace of God leads us to that what what does what does Calvary do it causes you when we get a real glimpse of Calvary it causes you to take your focus off of your unworthiness it causes you to take the focus off of habits it causes you to take the focus off everything that's been around in your life that's tormented you plagued you and everything the devil is trapped you into and wanted to make you say you'll never be this you'll never be that you know what Calvary does it overwhelms you with the love of God to do what to where you look away to Jesus where you need to be looking to in the first place laughs to do as he did for others who was following on let's try to hit that tonight he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you wow so he was the example of what God intended a Son of God to be daughter of God you believe that he's the first among many Brethren let me just read this first part of this quote the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself he didn't die for himself he didn't take a beating for himself he didn't bear the crown of thorns for himself he wasn't mocked for himself he wasn't spit on for himself he wasn't reviled for himself he wasn't made fun of for himself he lived his whole life or you think he wasn't tempted to to live it you think he wasn't tempted he was tempted remember the devil would say to him if thou be the Son of God he was tempted to act out in the flesh he was tempted to take the kingdom without suffering he was tempted in all points such as we are what was it it was proving Not only was he the perfect sacrifice but when this sacrifices offered up and this same life that's in me it comes back in you it will give you the strength to withstand Temptation it'll give you the strength to get back up again it'll give you the strength to walk on in my perfection glory be to God he never lived for himself remember even Brethren after the Temptation Brethren came around surely John 7. surely any man that has a gift like this does not keep it to himself he would go out and make it known to others tempted same devil different form same devil different form right he was tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin right he was tempted now let's look at this here just for a moment can can we take just a few moments to look at this notice here in Matthew chapter 9 verse 9 this is just a few verses of scripture we'll look at here before we close let's look at our example just for a minute here just one of those things Jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he said to him follow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass as Jesus said at meat in the house behold many public uh many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples oh Lord don't let anybody post this on Instagram that Jesus is sitting in Matthew's house dear Lord his reputation will be ruined Oh no you're mistaken his reputation is made there aren't you listen to me aren't you glad that he overcame that that you and I get bothered by help me come on what if somebody sees me talking to this guy that's got about a million rings and a million tattoos and whatever more well if they're a real believer they'll be praying for you they won't be thinking wonder if he's thinking about getting a ring I wonder if he's thinking about getting a tattoo no I've already been tattooed on my soul I've got the Seal of the Living God Hallelujah all right I wonder what brother Samuel is talking to them for trying to win a soul for the kingdom of God trying to see if there's a seed there we don't get to pick and choose whether they got Rings tattoos whether they're bald got hair whether they got hair down to their waist we don't got we don't get to choose that because that's not what we're choosing based on anyhow we're choosing and letting God lead us because if there is a son and daughter of God on the inside just get him in the presence of the light and God will go to work and God will do it is that right and when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master you can almost imagine with public and sinners but when Jesus heard it he said to them they that be whole need not a physician but they are sick oh wait a minute so you mean Jesus that I you mean you mean that that it's not oh eyewitness to people when everybody is just in the right condition they're here at church and they're this that's what I witness no that's Pharisees yeah hello somebody but here is the thing that Jesus was looking at is you know what there's a need right here there's a need in this life there's a need in this situation Jesus if I can say it like this Jesus was not going around looking for a party he was looking for his children aren't you glad that he came where you and I were at probably a lot of people wouldn't have come there a lot of pastors priests and whatever more would never come but Jesus came Lord be to God in highest but go you learn notice he said they that beholding him not a physician but they that are sick verse 13. but go you and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance he's still calling Apostolic age is still in session but guess what the Corporal body's not here but his body is Because by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have been baptized into one body we has no hands but our hands no feet but our feet is that right and what you think of this now Matthew 11 19 because we're talking about what an example he was what Calvary did for us that he never lived his life for himself if he would have lived his life for himself he'd have made sure he never went to these kind of places was never being been called and identified with Matthew and luxem he also made sure he wouldn't have been at the well of Samaria especially him and that woman standing there by the well he'd made sure of it but Jesus never lived his life for himself like I don't want them to dirty my reputation no his reputation is made with Taking Lives that look like as Misfits these will never be turned around Jesus said that's where my reputation is made that's where I make my name is taken lives that people say wrote off Outcast but he gets a hold of that life and out of that life he raises a son and daughter of God Matthew 11 19 the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous and a wine bibber see misinterpreting right so what are you going to do Jesus what are you going to do I'm telling you what are you going to do Jesus are you going to turn around oh I don't want to be labeled that if I go if I go and sit down with that brother I mean I might get late oh so it's still Pride that we deal with isn't it help me somebody it'll just cause me to go in first gear and preach a little bit more right here sometimes we get that old pride thing that rises up in this you know what that is it's a spirit that wants to try to come around our lives is that right oh I don't I don't know if I can be but remember we're not there fellowshipping with sin we're there to try to reach a soul for the kingdom of God is that right a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of her children I always remember the testimony it's just one but you know even when brother Jerry tells this the testimony he's told about brother brother Tim uh brother Tim Horner and how that brother Tim Horner had had so many different experiences with preachers and different ones and and you know just and I I'll just say like this Maybe Maybe I'm Wrong maybe I'm off with this right here I believe a lot of times people have good intentions but the thing of it is they're trying to take the product they've got and Shove It Down somebody's throat yeah are you hearing me now brother that's why brother Brian said ain't nothing wrong with the product of the Holy Ghost we got it sometimes it's our presentation of it that's wrong is that right I got a quote on I'm going to read it tonight but to notice how the here brother Tim comes to that this Church Fellowship it was a miracle he came to the Church Fellowship but here that brother Jerry comes in and you know my brother he don't have no Rottweilers right now as he's wanted some but he don't have none but you know he had them then and you know my brother when he gets in a dog gets an outlet for him it's just it's just an outlet to be able to research it study it and things like that and the Lord knows you've got to have Outlets like that as a pastor and a minister you got to have something you can look at and but you know here he is he's doing this and he comes and sits down he don't mention one scripture he don't mention one quote to brother Tim I wonder what some of us would have said if we'd have been there I wonder if we'd have been itching and his brother Jerry getting worldly his brother Jerry getting careless I believe I think we ought to need to get on the boxing gloves we need to put it out and brother Tim glory to God you God you need to be born again and you need to be you need to re I wonder what we would have done you see the problem is where the screwdriver telling telling God how to use us instead of letting God use us the way he wants to use us and sometimes pride gets built up come on friends it's that part we get that fleshness over us like oh my goodness I don't want to be a compromiser I don't want to be in this I don't until we respond on a wrong basis instead of the love of God and what happens that right there drives away but I'm talking about an example how to be useful right he gave his life on Calvary that you and I could become useful but how brother Jerry stood there that that or sat there that day that whole day of that picnic talked about Rottweilers the whole time and brother Tim's testimony was you've heard about the Jerry tell this and I just use it for this example as it comes to me brother Tim when he left that picnic he said I'll be in church tomorrow he told his parents he said I never met a preacher like that you know sometimes we walk around like we have to be a bunch of spiritual monks where we don't have an ounce of compassion about us think of the scriptures I referred to with job think of the scriptures he was a useful man I read four scriptures to you where he strengthened the knees of the feeble you have to gain favor before you could ever talk to somebody is that right but here Jesus is regarded as a friend in the long story short you know what happened brother 10 that very service he walked in on that Sunday morning and here there God moved there ended up being an older call and here come brother Tim walking stepping right over top people and my brother walked down and stepping over top people and he was led to the Lord I say glory be to God might have had to use Rottweilers he wouldn't put Rottweilers over any other breed hello somebody but God used it to do what reaching God might use your background with tools or knowledge or the cars whatever it could be God can use that to strike up a conversation with somebody you know how this is the only this is the only time I got who told you that's the only time you got don't try to cram rush or push just yield notice Hebrews 4 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised Luke 15 1. I am I'm closing here's Jesus then he drew near unto him they then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him he must have a problem publicans and sinners this is his this is the people that he's fellowshipping with oh but he's on a mission for the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister he came to give his life a ransom for many let me tell you something he gave his life over and over Calvary was only a manifestation of what took place daily to the will of God giving himself daily whole mind and the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eat it with eateth with them and he spake this Parable saying what man of you have a hundred sheep if you lose one does not leave the 99 in Wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it and when he had found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost I say unto you I'll just close here that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth what was the whole goal was after one after one you mean Jesus you mean for one person hey he crossed the sea for one is that right he kept an appointment in his appointment book at The Well of Samaria that appointment had been arranged before the foundation of the world and it just came up on his notification I must need to go by Samaria why one of his children was coming I could go on and on we've had that point we'd understand that for one sinner that repenteth God like job job was useful how was he useful because he allowed the life of the sacrifice not only it's it gave him it was a conf God's confidence in him but it gave him a place where he could stand it's like if you're trying to get somebody out of the water who's drowning you better make sure that you're standing on Solid Ground first are you with me and then when you're on Solid Ground then you can reach your hand to somebody else and say here take a hold of this because you got ground to stand on that you won't be pulled off of that ground but you're pulling to the ground you're standing on I believe that's that's the grace that we need or sometimes it might be things that we're looking at or it might be long in my town well brother Sammy I'm pulling up well don't make sure you're not yanking just make sure you keep pulling because he made us Fishers of men right just a little bit it's a little bit just a little bit and that little bit that we're like that that might be our response to a trial it might be a reaction to a situation at work and it's getting the attention wow there's something there's something deeper here something deeper oh God I want to be useful not useful for my glory but like I said I don't care if it's just to flip the light switch on I just want I want to be a part of this program I don't matter you don't have to it's not a certain part that I have to have or you have to have I just want to be useful like the little guy who stands at the end of the symphony and this little guy he's waiting this Symphony goes on and on and on the song is playing and all of a sudden we're at the end he's the one that goes that's all he does I don't care I don't care if my job in the symphony is to set the chairs up for those who complain to play it's an honor that he has allowed me to be a part of his body if I'm the guy who has to unload the truck of the violin cases and somebody else plays them I'm just glad to do it I'm glad to do it Lord whatever that I can do Lord if it's hey hey said hey go fetch me some rosin for my boat sure sure whatever I can do but Sam you don't I do mean that I just want to be used by him because whatever he asked me to do if I do it he'll be glorified and it'll work with another part of the body and that part of the body work at this part of the body it'll just work together that's about our heads Lord Jesus I believe across this building tonight Lord and those that Lord would be or will archive Lord even the service some streaming it now help us Lord like we looked at last week Lord certain things that you don't need the things you can't use what you don't need from us Lord help us the Lord help us father that we can stay in a place Lord in your presence and fellowshipping Lord with you father lord it's not something that we have to where it's drawn out and we have to make something Lord out of our imagination know when Paul said pray without ceasing I believe God that that's staying in contact with you you've given the example sometimes in Services Lord where it's been sometimes the Lord for my wife and I will set down and we'll have a little time together with coffee and it might be just a few moments there whether it's at the start of that day or it's at the close of it or maybe I'll take a break in the middle of the day just to have coffee and those those are some longer times of chatting and just a few moments that we have there and then there's other times through the day or something that I may send a text or I'll walk out of the office or walk from another room in the house and and come out of there and I'll say honey how you doing how's this doing not a long conversation but just just expressing things like honey I love you or how you doing you're feeling better how's your how's your pain how's this Lord that's how you want it to be with us there's times sure that we have Lord in our prayer closing times Lord in prayer and that's true maybe sometimes Lord we've got to get out and just go park Lord in front of the of the lake and just to talk to you sometimes we've got to break away from just certain things Lord but you know how you deal with each of us but then even through the day in our busyness Lord of the work and everything else through the day we can say Lord I love you you just begin to think about the grace of God that has come down our way how you found us how you picked this up how you turned our lives around lord it's something I've never got over I can say thank you Lord things that we can notice throughout the day and there's times Lord where you'll you're you'll drop little things to us Lord a little something Lord maybe you'll say or something will come to us that we've heard or something we've read or sometimes we might even be driving down the road and we'll see a sign and something you can he can say God loves you and Lord everybody else driving back and reading that it might help different ones in a different way but we're reminded yes you do Lord oh Lord God we love you father Lord as we think of job it was the life of the sacrifice that was being expressed when he would visit those who were Mourning when he would strengthen the knees that were people when he would Express words that would assuage the grief to dismiss or lighten that it was the life of the sacrifice Lord help us help us Lord my hands are up Lord Dear God that Lord is the privilege we have not only to live an overcoming life but daily Lord Jesus father to live so close to you to where the life of that sacrifice is projected through our lips projected through our actions projected through our empathy our sympathy our comfort or there's no doubt every one of us Lord our flesh would still rise up and say Lord I'll walk on water tomorrow for you but Lord I wonder how many of us would raise our hands and say Lord I'll be a comforter to one that's in trial I'll comfort them Lord by the same comfort that you've comforted me I'll be willing to minister Lord be willing to send a text to card phone call encouragement I'll be willing to pray for somebody Lord I'd be willing I'd be willing Lord to just listen not even have to say a word because Lord some of the greatest words we can ever say is when we say absolutely nothing and just listen help us Lord for that's what that day on Calvary did for us how that Lord you were in the presence of Sinners and publicans but I think about it Lord you were there on a mission you were there that that life Lord could be expressed and it would touch the lives of others we read here in this of Luke 15 or it was misunderstood the public or the those Lord God of the Pharisees the religious of that day they could not understand it as a matter of fact they wanted nothing to do with people who were not as righteous as they were God help us I don't ever I don't want to be that way Lord because I sure can't be useful for you to you if I'm better than somebody else I can never be useful to you Lord any goodness that is in our life it's because of the grace of God help us Lord as we look not at our own selves we look away to Calvary help us Lord to stand on that ground that confidence and like job be able to reach out a helping hand to the others and that hand that we might be reaching out to that life oh it might be a life that has been wrote off a life that is all this will never be this but Lord there's something within us that reaches out to him that's the Redeemer in his redeemed creation reaching out to redeem it's you Lord that's when the Holy Spirit has come and as your Prophet tells us we have now been made co-partners with you in Redemption Lord Jesus help us the Lord to live to walk that way help us to be sensitive in what we'll say and what we don't say help us Lord not to get pulled out into the flesh as though we got to say something right now or I got to do this help us Lord to realize that the only time and only way you'll use this is when we're yielded to you not leading you not pushing you not shoving but being yielded in the Master's Hand Lord help me Lord I pray Heal Me Lord that's the kind of life I want to live a useful life I might just be a little flathead screwdriver but Lord whenever you've got need let me be in a position that you can reach down and say I need this right now help us Lord help us I pray in
