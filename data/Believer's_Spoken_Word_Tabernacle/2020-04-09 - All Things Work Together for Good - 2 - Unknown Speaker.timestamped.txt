[20:54] man how we thank the Lord for His mercy
[20:57] tonight hey man so grateful for the
[21:00] grace of God and I'm just so glad that
[21:03] we could be gathered together here once
[21:06] again and I just want to say we just
[21:10] appreciate the times that we can get
[21:11] together we certainly missing seeing
[21:16] each and every one of you
[21:17] just through the times that were able to
[21:20] have contact and just I think oh how my
[21:25] heart longs for a time where we be able
[21:27] to come back together and just to be
[21:29] able to see one another and so we know
[21:33] that that longing in her heart the
[21:36] desire we know that not just in this
[21:39] life but we also know that we're heading
[21:41] home and we'll come to a place there on
[21:45] the other side we will never have to and
[21:49] we'll never have to part again these the
[21:51] times that we come together and we
[21:54] gather Paul would identify at these
[21:57] times that we come together he would say
[21:59] forsake not to assemble yourselves
[22:01] together Paul would go on to write that
[22:03] our gathering that we take do now he
[22:06] said it's a gathering as unto Him it's
[22:08] it's showing there's a call within our
[22:11] hearts to come together with brothers
[22:13] and sisters of like precious faith and
[22:16] it is it's one of the things that we are
[22:19] so it's a great it's a great privilege
[22:21] and a great honor and I think God that
[22:23] we as I've said before that we have this
[22:25] opportunity appreciate all those who
[22:27] make it possible and
[22:30] so that we're able to do that and I
[22:32] would trust that each and every one of
[22:34] you are just drawn closer to the Lord
[22:38] and then throughout the time that God
[22:41] just watching over each and every one of
[22:43] you and we are just we're confident in
[22:45] that in those things right there we want
[22:48] to just look here in the word I I don't
[22:50] want to tarry too long here in
[22:53] preliminary but we do want to say we
[22:56] love and miss H each and every one of
[22:58] you and we want to go straight to the
[23:01] word of the Lord tonight and I would
[23:02] like to go back into Romans chapter
[23:05] eight and just look to the Lord tonight
[23:08] just to come and just to speak to our
[23:11] hearts in a real special way tonight
[23:13] just want to read some verses of
[23:16] Scripture here verse 26 and we were
[23:21] reading from these parts the last time
[23:23] we were together on a Thursday and it
[23:25] says likewise the spirit also helpeth
[23:29] our infirmities for we know not what we
[23:33] should pray for as we ought but the
[23:35] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[23:38] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[23:40] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[23:43] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[23:45] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[23:49] according to the will of God and we know
[23:52] that all things work together for good
[23:54] to them that love God to them who are
[23:58] called according to his purpose for whom
[24:03] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[24:05] to be conformed to the image of his son
[24:09] that he might be the firstborn among
[24:12] many brethren moreover whom he did
[24:16] predestinate them he also called and
[24:19] whom he called them he also justified
[24:22] and whom he justified them he also
[24:25] glorified what shall we say to these
[24:30] things
[24:31] if God be for us who can be against us
[24:36] he that spared not his own son but
[24:39] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[24:44] not with him also freely give us all
[24:49] things who shall lay anything to the
[24:55] charge of God's elect it is God that
[25:00] justified
[25:01] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[25:05] that died yay rather that is risen again
[25:11] who is even at the right hand of God who
[25:16] also maketh intercession for us in verse
[25:21] 36 or 35 it says who shall separate us
[25:27] from the love of Christ I want you to
[25:31] notice the wording it did not say what
[25:35] shall separate us who he goes to who is
[25:41] behind it who shall separate us from the
[25:45] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[25:47] distress or persecution or famine or
[25:52] nakedness or pearl or sword as it is
[25:57] written for thy sake we are killed all
[26:01] the day long we are counted as sheep for
[26:05] the slaughter
[26:06] but nay in all these things we are more
[26:11] than conquerors through him that loved
[26:14] us amen may God bless his word amen and
[26:20] let's just look to him now
[26:23] Heavenly Father as we Lord have gathered
[26:27] Lord around the Word of God Lord we are
[26:31] just Lord anticipating I'm looking Oh
[26:35] God that you would just take control and
[26:38] just speak to our hearts Lord speak to
[26:42] every life oh god that's gathered here
[26:45] Lord around the word and Lord you even
[26:48] know those that would Lord archived it
[26:51] in days or times to come Lord may it be
[26:54] an encouragement or God Oh father to
[26:59] every son and daughter of God may it be
[27:02] Lord a wooing of the Holy Spirit of God
[27:05] that would draw Lord any life that's
[27:09] been on the fence Lord may it just drawn
[27:12] Oh God
[27:13] into a place Lord where the love of God
[27:15] is just so overwhelms their life and
[27:18] they would surrender Lord so completely
[27:21] to you Oh God we're just asking Lord
[27:25] tonight that you would come and break
[27:27] the bread of life to us Lord speak to
[27:30] our hearts Lord we ask it in the name of
[27:32] Jesus Christ amen
[27:35] and then may God bless you as you being
[27:38] seated we want to look at that thought
[27:41] of all things work together to them who
[27:45] love God amen and to them who are called
[27:50] according to his purpose and we
[27:54] recognize that it's not just to to love
[27:57] God or a person can have a lot of an
[28:00] object and imagination they can have a
[28:03] thought of God but this is not talking
[28:06] about your thought or my thought or any
[28:09] man's thought of God but it's dealing
[28:12] with where the love of God has really
[28:16] come in to the innermost part of our
[28:19] life where his life is in full control
[28:23] in our lives and it's not just loving
[28:27] attributes about him many love his
[28:30] attribute of grace but his attribute of
[28:32] grace we know it's not something that
[28:35] would allow
[28:36] to remain or to live a sinful life you
[28:40] see it's never God's objective to leave
[28:43] us where he finds us but he comes to
[28:46] bring deliverance to our lives and
[28:49] everything and how that the Holy Spirit
[28:52] how he would move is by love he comes to
[28:56] woo us and draw us unto himself and
[28:59] that's the whole relationship that's
[29:02] what a real relationship with God is
[29:04] based upon it's based upon an individual
[29:08] falling in love with the Lord Jesus just
[29:11] allowing just him to keep on as he's
[29:14] dealing with your life you keep on
[29:16] yielding and and keep on just falling in
[29:19] love with him and seeking after him and
[29:22] so when we come into this the times that
[29:25] we we are in right now we know that as
[29:28] we're looking in the scripture that
[29:30] certainly and that not everything that
[29:32] takes place is good but all things work
[29:36] together for the good to them that love
[29:39] God and are called according to his
[29:41] purpose and so when I I look at this
[29:44] whole templates of Scripture here we
[29:49] look at things that how Paul has
[29:51] directed us as believers because we need
[29:57] solid ground there must be solid ground
[29:59] in a life to stand on if if in any time
[30:03] in a life when God permits testings and
[30:07] trials and God permits trouble to come
[30:10] our way he he comes to reveal not that
[30:14] he needs to know but it's us discovering
[30:18] the hold and the stability the anchor
[30:21] the assurance within our life but it's
[30:24] important that we in our lives that it
[30:27] be founded upon the solid rock like Paul
[30:31] we would hear him write in Ephesians 6
[30:33] having done all to stand you must know
[30:36] where you are standing you must know the
[30:40] ground that you're standing on and so
[30:42] this is where when Paul would write in
[30:45] verse 31 what shall we say to
[30:48] these things if God be for us who can be
[30:52] against us let me just say it God did
[30:55] not start being for us when we all of a
[30:58] sudden had a desire to begin to yield
[31:01] for him
[31:01] no God was already for us from before
[31:05] the foundation of the world he is for
[31:08] his word coming to pass in our life as
[31:11] we were looking at it last Thursday so
[31:13] with God
[31:15] to think of it of all of the hindrances
[31:17] and the roadblocks and annoying that
[31:20] even how a person can so get their lives
[31:23] so twisted up by making decisions and
[31:27] running in the world and doing all sorts
[31:29] of things but yet if there is and they
[31:32] are a seed of God and they belong to God
[31:35] they cannot escape the plan of God
[31:38] because we recognize that the Holy
[31:41] Spirit no matter how much and remember
[31:44] the enemy's objective with all of those
[31:47] things is to try to bring a life into a
[31:50] place to where they would even question
[31:52] and say how could God want anything to
[31:56] do with me what could God why would God
[31:59] want anything to do with me and they're
[32:01] looking at the spots and the stain of
[32:03] sin upon their life even from the nature
[32:07] within their life and they would ask the
[32:09] question how could God want anything to
[32:11] do with me but the scripture said if God
[32:14] be for us who can be against us God was
[32:19] for Jacob but he did not allow Jacob to
[32:22] bypass that of the new birth but God
[32:25] allowed all of those things to happen
[32:27] and it came back to a place to where
[32:30] Jacob had met God first at Bethel he was
[32:34] not contained he was not converted he
[32:37] had not been delivered of Jacob but he
[32:40] had a supernatural experience with God
[32:42] and he made a promise he says Lord when
[32:45] I return he said I will give thee a
[32:47] tithes of all and remember God was not
[32:50] so much looking as a tithe from all of
[32:53] his sheep his herds everything else
[32:55] although that tithe was to go to honor
[32:58] the Lord but God was calling for a
[33:02] of his life which was his soul to be
[33:05] turned over completely to the Lord so to
[33:08] recognize that within it no matter what
[33:10] would try to come even in that of Jacobs
[33:14] way and others God Himself is moving all
[33:17] things and he'll bring things like he
[33:19] has in our life to a showdown what's he
[33:22] doing he's declaring that he is for us
[33:25] it doesn't mean that and surely that
[33:28] within any life that they could bypass
[33:30] you cannot bypass the new birth you must
[33:33] be born again
[33:34] but God working upon that life then Paul
[33:38] would bring that would bring that
[33:40] reality and say he that spared not his
[33:44] own son but delivered him up for us all
[33:48] how shall he not with him also freely
[33:53] give us all things
[33:56] it was the innocent all the way from
[33:59] Eden all the way through it's the
[34:01] innocent dying for the guilty to think
[34:04] of even in Redemption when you read the
[34:06] Old Testament you go through from
[34:08] Genesis you're reading you move from
[34:10] Genesis you move you know they're in the
[34:13] Exodus you move two numbers you move to
[34:15] Deuteronomy over and over you read even
[34:17] as you read through a numbers even times
[34:20] and Exodus and Deuteronomy sometimes you
[34:22] read and it's like these are the same
[34:24] chapters that were said within the
[34:26] previous book but yet within at all you
[34:29] read that of redemption to where God had
[34:32] placed it in there to where you know
[34:34] brother Branham would take the example
[34:36] he said like you take he remember that
[34:38] which was the firstborn of any of those
[34:40] of the creatures as they were firstborn
[34:44] there had to be a lamb that would be
[34:45] offered in the place of that firstborn
[34:48] and brother Branham would take that
[34:49] dramas dramatization of he said if you
[34:52] had that of you know
[34:53] of that of one of them a little mule and
[34:57] he said that mule he said it was the
[34:59] ugliest looking thing in the world and
[35:01] he said that little mule he said you
[35:03] know it would have something it was such
[35:06] a horrible looking creature he said but
[35:08] if its mother was instructed in the laws
[35:11] of redemption it would be
[35:14] look to tell that little one he would
[35:17] say you don't have to worry because you
[35:22] are under a birthright and then what is
[35:25] required is a lamb the owner is gonna
[35:28] take a lamb for your life and then what
[35:32] she would instruct him in is that the
[35:35] owner that they will never see you they
[35:38] will see the lamb and this is where the
[35:42] scriptures are declaring for you and I
[35:44] it's not God evaluating our life to see
[35:48] whether or not we're worthy no man no
[35:51] woman is worthy of the grace of Almighty
[35:54] God
[35:55] you can't do anything to make yourself
[35:58] worthy it is unmerited grace amen and
[36:03] not that the lamb is going to be but our
[36:05] lamb has already been offered up it was
[36:10] before the foundation of the world the
[36:12] lamb was land this is where that the
[36:16] sons of God shouted for joy amen to see
[36:20] the salvation the security of God's plan
[36:24] of redemption and to recognize we were
[36:27] always unworthy we are not worthy other
[36:30] we can't merit it it is the unmerited
[36:33] grace of Almighty God as a matter of
[36:37] fact brother Branham would say God
[36:39] doesn't look at your unworthiness there
[36:43] can be a woman that might be soft towel
[36:45] or a man that could be so pal that seems
[36:49] like so much entrenched on their life
[36:51] but yet within it all the scriptures
[36:54] remain true God is not looking at their
[36:58] filthiness he's looking at the lamb and
[37:01] if God calls you to a life of
[37:04] justification sanctification and he's
[37:07] calling you to a complete deliverance
[37:08] he's not looking at you he's looking at
[37:11] the lamb because it is the lamb that has
[37:15] already overcome
[37:18] if he's looking at me its defeat
[37:21] he's got folk to find but I'm not called
[37:25] by my merits i'm told by the blood of
[37:29] the lamb he examines the lamb so he
[37:37] follows that up who shall lay anything
[37:42] to the charge that means bringing
[37:43] accusations of God's elect it is God
[37:48] that justifies
[37:52] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[37:57] that died yea rather that is risen again
[38:00] who is even at the right hand of God
[38:03] he's seated in power he did what was
[38:06] called of him as a kinsman he fulfilled
[38:09] he fulfilled his part he's already paid
[38:13] the price the blood was shed it was
[38:16] accepted he rose on that Easter morning
[38:19] and he set back the Holy Ghost he
[38:22] ascended to the right hand of God on
[38:24] high he is there until he maketh his
[38:28] enemies his footstool amen
[38:32] he's already seated in power you say
[38:34] brother Samuel what does that mean it
[38:36] means he has already it's a finished
[38:38] work he sat down on the right hand of
[38:42] God the word is in power the world of
[38:45] redemption is in power the world of
[38:48] Liberty is in power the world is in
[38:51] power what was taken out of the hands of
[38:53] man now that word was delivered and
[38:56] notice here the word the book of
[38:59] redemption was veiled in the man Christ
[39:01] Jesus
[39:02] he already prevailed he already overcome
[39:06] and the reality of this working is
[39:10] released to you and I as sons and
[39:13] daughters of God he is interceding for
[39:16] you and I
[39:18] glory be to God in the highest Amen we
[39:23] don't have nothing to do we have to
[39:26] believe think of the setting even when
[39:30] we were at last night think of the
[39:32] setting here we were in where it's
[39:35] observed as the Passover families were
[39:39] in their houses gathered together plague
[39:43] was on the outside blood was applied
[39:46] here we were in the myth here we are in
[39:49] the midst of it gathered with families
[39:51] plague on the outside blood upon the
[39:54] door is that right and to recognize that
[39:59] when that blood remember the blood God
[40:01] made a preparation before judgment could
[40:05] ever strike Egypt the message come to
[40:09] open the way of deliverance because you
[40:13] see her lord have mercy I feel like
[40:17] preaching you recognize that within
[40:19] Egypt God didn't want them walking out
[40:22] with taskmasters hanging over them God
[40:25] wanted that to be a walking out to where
[40:27] Pharaoh and them would say get out of
[40:30] here get out of here we don't want you
[40:32] around here anymore and that's how the
[40:34] Spirit of God it deals with a lot it
[40:37] works with a lot to do what release that
[40:40] son and daughter of God on the inside Oh
[40:44] glory be to God
[40:46] let me tell you something when that lamb
[40:48] oh they took the lamb they killed the
[40:51] lamb and they took the blood of the lamb
[40:54] they put it upon the doorposts and the
[40:56] lintel thereof and they had to come
[40:59] under that blood that blood was a
[41:02] representation that death has already
[41:05] come to this house the firstborn that
[41:08] should die there's already been a lamb a
[41:11] firstborn that has died for that first
[41:14] point one is already shepherd and a life
[41:17] has been given when the Death Angel
[41:20] would look upon that blood he had to
[41:23] recognize that heat there's already a
[41:25] death you cannot touch that let me tell
[41:28] you Satan cannot come over the
[41:32] Satan cannot walk over the blood and to
[41:37] fake of it every promise that God has
[41:41] made to us this is why you don't have to
[41:44] wonder when you get safely beneath the
[41:46] blood hallelujah even when God is
[41:51] calling alive you must believe that God
[41:54] is and easy rewarder of them that
[41:57] diligently seek Him
[41:59] amen to come under her and anywhere
[42:02] his brother Brandon would tell us he
[42:04] said if they were to come under the head
[42:05] he said and they wondered I I wonder if
[42:07] Jehovah is going to keep his word he
[42:09] said that's any insult to Jehovah
[42:12] because every word God keeps every word
[42:17] Amen winner believer or my lack Romans
[42:20] 8:1 said there is Vallon there know for
[42:23] no condemnation to them who are in
[42:26] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[42:29] flesh but after the spirit their life
[42:34] has been completely transformed not just
[42:38] cleaned up but Christ has been made
[42:41] alive the the illumination of the heart
[42:44] is to please the Lord I do only those
[42:47] things that please him Oh glory be to
[42:51] God and you know you might ask in your
[42:54] mind or your heart you might say what
[42:56] does this have to do with tests and
[42:59] trials or even a present situation it
[43:02] has everything to do with it
[43:04] you've got to make sure you're on solid
[43:07] ground
[43:08] you've got to know the ground you're
[43:10] standing on what I'm preaching about is
[43:12] what Paul would tell them in first
[43:14] Thessalonians no your election brethren
[43:18] you've got to know where you're standing
[43:21] and if you've been standing on between
[43:24] two opinions I say in the name of Jesus
[43:28] Christ separate yourself from that
[43:30] unbelief you've got a purity to walk
[43:33] away from unbelief and to be and to be
[43:36] united with Jesus Christ get on solid
[43:41] ground
[43:43] oh my let me just say it like this you
[43:48] need there is solid ground is when you
[43:50] know you pass from death unto life to
[43:54] where the desire within your life is no
[43:57] longer just a desire to want to serve
[44:00] God and you know let me just say it like
[44:02] this for a moment
[44:03] you know God calls upon a life they
[44:06] might have they have a desire to serve
[44:08] John and maybe they're you know smoking
[44:10] drinking of fornicating whatever it is
[44:12] in their life and God calls upon their
[44:15] life and here they surrender their life
[44:17] to God and they still got all those
[44:19] habits about their life you see God is
[44:21] not looking at all of them habits he's
[44:24] calling that life into a complaint of
[44:26] complete surrender let me tell you
[44:28] something everything that that
[44:30] individual has need of he has already
[44:33] provided for that life he has not only
[44:36] provided the justification for us to
[44:38] believe he's also provided the
[44:41] sanctifying power of His grace to be
[44:43] able to break that hold of habits and
[44:46] things in that life he has also provided
[44:48] that of the Living reality of Jesus
[44:52] Christ that's able to reach down and
[44:54] move to such a place of complete
[44:56] transformation to where he sets down on
[44:59] the very throne of that heart it's not
[45:07] looking back we're not looking back to
[45:10] Calvary as a historical event we're not
[45:15] looking back and saying mile thank God
[45:18] for Calvary but we look at a like a
[45:19] historical event that'll do you no good
[45:22] you've got to know what what Calvary did
[45:25] that what it did and his resurrection is
[45:29] to reveal himself pressingly to you that
[45:32] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[45:35] and forever what he did in that body he
[45:39] comes and does in your body this is why
[45:44] over and over many things
[45:49] but we hear of think oh I want you to
[45:52] think of these these moments
[45:56] David would ride over and over in
[45:59] different places he's my rock we've
[46:02] preached on that even some Thursday's
[46:04] ago he is my rock Psalm 62 he or he
[46:08] alone is my rock
[46:09] he's the solid ground when David talked
[46:13] about being overwhelmed he said leave me
[46:15] to the rock that's higher than i is that
[46:17] right in psalms 27 the chapter there
[46:21] that would refer to that of the the the
[46:24] setting and everything that's going on
[46:26] around us in this world remember what he
[46:30] said he will hide me in the his pavilion
[46:33] in the secret of his tabernacle in a
[46:37] will set me upon a rock God's desire is
[46:41] that you and I would know where we are
[46:44] standing that's not just for this moment
[46:48] but that you yourself might be a serpent
[46:51] bruiser and to recognize who you are in
[46:55] Jesus Christ you must know who you are
[47:00] man cannot tell us that it takes a
[47:03] direct revelation from Almighty God and
[47:07] brother he doesn't work on the inside
[47:09] it's a sure work of the sealing power of
[47:13] the Holy Ghost that you know you pass
[47:15] from death unto life the things you once
[47:18] loved you no longer love you know your
[47:21] desire is Jesus Christ you know that's
[47:24] been illuminated this word the prescient
[47:27] word has been revealed to you
[47:33] I'm saying that's Liberty
[47:39] that's Liberty this is why God would
[47:46] write all the way through in the
[47:48] scriptures of the Liberty that belongs
[47:50] to us is the sons and daughters of God
[47:53] he would he would announce even in the
[47:55] time of Israel where there would come a
[47:58] times of captivity where you know people
[48:02] would either the selling or the
[48:05] endowment of their land and themselves
[48:08] they would have to work off a debt or a
[48:10] lien that was against him but when the
[48:12] fiftieth year came there was a sound of
[48:16] Jubilee let me tell you something that
[48:20] trumpet when it sounded that man had a
[48:24] choice he could either believe the
[48:27] announcement and go free he didn't have
[48:30] to go ask the master can I be free he
[48:34] didn't have to go after one and say hey
[48:36] can I go can I go back to me he didn't
[48:38] have to the sounding of the trumpet
[48:42] remember all Israel could not see the
[48:46] atonement and the blood being shed but
[48:48] the but the blood was connected with the
[48:52] sound and there was a priest that would
[48:54] ride throughout the land and that priest
[48:57] would announce that the blood had been
[49:00] shed the atonement had been made and you
[49:04] can go free they could take whatever it
[49:07] was that they were bound with and
[49:09] release it and walked under the
[49:12] authority of the Liberty that had been
[49:14] sounded to them that's the power of the
[49:18] gospel of Jesus Christ it's true believe
[49:22] it's to have faith in his finished work
[49:26] and you see that Liberty it began he
[49:30] works Amen faith faith it begins to work
[49:36] this is why when you think when the Lord
[49:39] Jesus would stand there in Luke 4
[49:43] and he would remember the priest
[49:46] delivered the scrolls unto him he found
[49:50] where it was written in the Book of
[49:52] Isaiah and he began to declare the
[49:55] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[49:59] hath anointed me and he goes down
[50:02] through all of those parts and
[50:05] categories to preach the gospel to the
[50:07] poor you know the poor eels he wasn't
[50:09] talking about that they didn't have no
[50:11] money
[50:14] Jesus said blessed are the poor in
[50:16] spirit for theirs is the kingdom he
[50:19] ain't talking about people being poor
[50:21] within within there in them financial
[50:24] means he's talking about blessed are
[50:27] they who are who can come in humility to
[50:31] the world when the world said you can be
[50:34] free and the word brings conviction that
[50:37] there's a heart on the inside that's not
[50:40] full of the devil's pride but can stand
[50:43] there and say yes Lord I need
[50:45] deliverance from you
[50:47] I need your help Lord God I'll tell you
[50:51] what right now I'm standing here right
[50:53] now
[50:54] since God did a work there and getting a
[50:57] hold of my life in June of 1995 let me
[51:00] tell you say brother Samuel have you
[51:02] been standing by the grace of God for 25
[51:06] years he's been my strength and my help
[51:09] hey man he's the one that changed this
[51:11] life and rearranged it for his glory
[51:14] he's the one it wants something that I
[51:16] did I could not do it he had to come and
[51:20] do it but he wooed me he drew me he
[51:28] drifted just like he draws his children
[51:31] I'm talking about solid ground tonight
[51:32] and Jesus would begin to say in closing
[51:36] up there he had come to preach the
[51:38] acceptable year the Lord preaching that
[51:40] of the Jubilee he goes on in that
[51:43] portion of Scripture in Luke 4 and he
[51:46] deals with how a prophet is not even
[51:48] accepted in his own country
[51:51] what was being sounded forth you know
[51:54] what they did they said I know him I
[51:57] know him I rubbed shoulders with him he
[52:00] was in and out of his daddy's car purred
[52:02] carpenter shop who in the world does he
[52:03] think he is I know who this is you see
[52:06] it's it's always something about it
[52:08] where people the greatest challenge is
[52:11] to recognize commonality things become
[52:15] common tune
[52:17] people can become common and they can no
[52:22] longer distinguish is it person or is it
[52:24] God I tell you that so that's a great
[52:27] embankment to that life because in order
[52:31] for any help to come you've got to
[52:33] recognize this ain't flesh it's God and
[52:37] Jesus let it be no no prophet is
[52:39] accepted in his own country he goes on
[52:43] to talk about in the days of Elijah
[52:45] under no other Widow was Elijah sent but
[52:49] one great famine was over the whole
[52:52] earth but one of them was sent one of
[52:55] them Elijah was sent to
[52:57] in the days from very in that statement
[52:59] in the time of leprosy was all over
[53:04] and yet many were in Israel lepers but
[53:09] not one of them was healed
[53:12] this is the scripture but naman Assyrian
[53:17] these are Gentile representations but
[53:22] naman was sent to Elias is that right
[53:26] Elijah was sent and he received healing
[53:30] in his life means Savior leprosy he is a
[53:34] horrible condition leprosy will separate
[53:39] a man from NASA was in Israel it
[53:41] separates them from the economy of
[53:44] Israel it would separate them from even
[53:46] from the from even coming into the house
[53:48] of God but remember like Moses remember
[53:52] God told Moses put your hand in your
[53:55] bosom he put it in his bosom pulled it
[53:57] out it was leprous it was showing that
[54:00] man's heart is leprous that's where the
[54:04] leprosy is but he said put your hand
[54:06] back in your bosom and he put the hand
[54:09] back in his bosom and pulled it out and
[54:12] it was completely clear what was it
[54:14] showing it was showing a complete work
[54:16] of the hand of Almighty God when God
[54:20] would come down and God would do a work
[54:22] to separate that leprosy of unbelief
[54:26] that was on the inside this is God's
[54:31] work who can lay anything to the charge
[54:34] of God's elect
[54:36] this is a Liberty the where when tests
[54:40] and trials and things come our way we've
[54:43] got ground we're standing on that's why
[54:47] the applying of the token when you're
[54:49] praying for your children you're praying
[54:52] for different ones you are praying with
[54:55] an authority of what God has done in
[54:58] your life amen
[55:04] you are praying with an authority you
[55:08] have met God you know him to be the same
[55:11] yesterday today forever
[55:13] he has changed your life
[55:16] glory be to God the very desire of sin
[55:20] is gone you see when you can look back
[55:23] look back you see many times it helps us
[55:26] look back
[55:29] he called you
[55:33] clean the life up from sin
[55:36] remember God don't take anything from
[55:38] anybody's life
[55:39] he don't forcefully take nothing he
[55:44] don't do it that way because he wants
[55:47] you to love him amen
[55:52] think of it he's brought you here he
[55:54] saved you he cleans you up
[55:56] he filled you with the Holy Ghost that
[55:58] gives you a perfect setting for faith
[56:03] when you know those things that gives
[56:06] you courage
[56:08] Amen you know where you're standing
[56:12] this is why when the scripture word long
[56:15] and here as I was thinking of these
[56:20] things here for some weeks the Lord just
[56:23] directing my heart to that where all
[56:24] things work together and we look in
[56:27] verse 35 where we read who shall
[56:32] separate us from the love of Christ
[56:35] it goes into naming things tribulation
[56:39] or distress persecution famine nakedness
[56:44] peril or sword for thy sake we are
[56:51] killed all the day long we are accounted
[56:54] as sheep for the slaughter
[56:56] what plough is letting us know here is
[56:58] the same thing he would write over in
[57:00] 2nd Corinthians 4 that it is our dying
[57:05] that the life of Christ might be made
[57:08] manifest because we can just really be
[57:11] real honest all of us that are gathered
[57:14] as you're gathering in your room it is
[57:16] constantly a surrendering of our will to
[57:20] God's will that's the battle
[57:24] but remember as you are giving yourself
[57:27] to the Lord you gain the advantage over
[57:31] your own will
[57:35] I'll just say it plainly our own will is
[57:37] stubborn our own will is rebellious come
[57:41] on bat in the flesh man the flesh man
[57:44] I'm not talking about these calcium
[57:46] Potter's petroleum
[57:47] I'm talking about the flesh man the
[57:49] carnal man I want to remember he didn't
[57:51] get the Holy Ghost come on somebody God
[57:56] has set down in yourself your soul have
[57:59] been turned there come a change on the
[58:01] inside of your life
[58:05] is that right but they're here we find
[58:09] within it
[58:09] it's us even in the midst of these times
[58:12] surrendering submitting to the Lord
[58:15] looking to the Lord in these times it
[58:18] doesn't remove us it doesn't cause us to
[58:20] say well you know it's going to happen
[58:21] no it's in these times as even the Lord
[58:24] Jesus he was praying nevertheless not my
[58:28] will thy will be done
[58:29] he was praying earnestly even on his way
[58:34] to Calvary
[58:37] and Paul would say in all these things
[58:41] we are more than conquerors through him
[58:44] that loved us
[58:46] who wants you to notice that scripture
[58:48] verse 35 it said who shall separate us
[58:55] and everyone these scriptures remember
[58:58] here's what's going through
[58:59] hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo is that right because
[59:02] we're dealing with two powers and see
[59:06] the God's power the Holy Spirit or it's
[59:09] Satan and it's dealing with not a lot
[59:13] but who
[59:15] behind every tribulation every distress
[59:20] persecution famine nakedness pearl sword
[59:23] behind it is Satan now let me just deal
[59:28] with this here and bring this this is
[59:30] where a point that I just want to
[59:32] capitalize on here for a few moments it
[59:34] is not what but it is who that is
[59:37] bringing it and it is Satan that brings
[59:40] it by the permission from the Lord I
[59:45] mean just let's just look at this here
[59:47] for a moment you see one of the things
[59:50] that was a very a crucial thing in the
[59:56] false the RAM would tell us with job and
[1:00:00] I'll get to that in a moment
[1:00:01] but he said as long as Satan could make
[1:00:05] job think
[1:00:07] then it was God doing it to him he had
[1:00:11] him whipped why because there's no
[1:00:15] something's wrong with me that's why I
[1:00:19] joke
[1:00:20] now I'm gonna preach a little bit this
[1:00:21] was a lot you know I've preached on
[1:00:23] these things I've referred back to him
[1:00:24] and I know not everybody was here for me
[1:00:26] and my mind sometimes I feel like
[1:00:27] everybody was but you realized there
[1:00:29] came a time when joke gotten them three
[1:00:31] guys started coming around Bildad you
[1:00:33] know I fast and all those things like
[1:00:35] that you remember their conversation
[1:00:37] eventually Joe tried to start justifying
[1:00:40] himself they kept on talking and Joe
[1:00:44] kept on trying to answer him to job's
[1:00:46] eyes got off the lam and his eyes got on
[1:00:50] himself
[1:00:52] that's why when Ella who come he had
[1:00:56] some words to say to Jo and then here
[1:00:59] after Ella who has passed off and now
[1:01:02] Ella who makes a way think of this God
[1:01:04] did not come and then you know then Ella
[1:01:07] who shows up but notice Ella who a
[1:01:09] sacrifice had to move in a way to get
[1:01:13] Cho into a place that quad could come
[1:01:15] down and speak lip to hear Oh glory be
[1:01:20] to God in the highest
[1:01:21] Omaha to think of it here you know
[1:01:24] brother Ram has asked the question in
[1:01:26] questions and answers 1954 and you know
[1:01:29] there is a person with a very good
[1:01:30] question they said I cannot believe all
[1:01:32] these wars and everything going on that
[1:01:35] I cannot believe that my God would be
[1:01:37] doing that my God as a God of love a
[1:01:40] brother branham he picks this up and
[1:01:43] he's you know he speaks of it speaks of
[1:01:45] how this could be even a bosom friend he
[1:01:47] said I don't know who it is
[1:01:48] but he said how that they have said my
[1:01:50] God is a God of love my god is love and
[1:01:53] wouldn't do this
[1:01:54] wars are of Satan he said I'll agree
[1:01:57] with you that Wars is of Satan that's
[1:02:01] exactly he's a prince of this world
[1:02:03] every Kingdom every nation in this world
[1:02:06] belongs to Satan God said they did in
[1:02:10] his word Satan said they're mine you
[1:02:12] remember the scripture G took Jesus up
[1:02:14] and showed them all in the Book of
[1:02:16] Revelations it speaks in the coming of
[1:02:18] that a millennium to where the kingdoms
[1:02:20] become them of the cry of the Lord and
[1:02:22] of his Christ so all the Satan is in
[1:02:25] control and all the kingdoms belong to
[1:02:28] him but Jesus he admitted they were but
[1:02:31] he was going to fall heir to them after
[1:02:33] a while Jesus will will have no more
[1:02:35] wars then that's a promise out of Isaiah
[1:02:39] but God even in Hell Psalms but God
[1:02:42] permits Satan to do this for correction
[1:02:46] and for judgment
[1:02:48] brother brandon picks it up and he says
[1:02:50] that continuing on he says who was it
[1:02:53] that permitted the evil to come down and
[1:02:55] Satan to go out and destroy the most
[1:02:57] perfect servant of God until Jesus
[1:02:59] Christ his children and everything else
[1:03:01] he had job God sent a wicked spirit out
[1:03:05] there and destroyed all of jobs children
[1:03:08] and everything just to test his servant
[1:03:11] all he said I could stand here for hours
[1:03:13] showing you my brother and sister
[1:03:15] whoever you are don't you get this
[1:03:18] spirit of God mixed up what's he calling
[1:03:20] it - don't you get this spirit of God
[1:03:23] mix up see it's coming to bring really a
[1:03:28] discernment of what's at work he said
[1:03:32] Wohlers are God's judgments upon the
[1:03:37] nation's destructions are sent of God
[1:03:41] and God is a God of love but god is a
[1:03:46] god of Wrath also see this is what a God
[1:03:50] of imagination leaves out that he's
[1:03:53] somehow oh he God you know oh surely God
[1:03:56] won't do this he leaves out a god of
[1:03:59] Wrath but I tell you what we need a god
[1:04:02] of Wrath we need him to come and execute
[1:04:06] judgment on that old sin nature come on
[1:04:09] somebody a man where he's able to bring
[1:04:12] a separation and loosen a certain and
[1:04:15] honor God who's imprisoned on the inside
[1:04:18] we need that God to come and execute
[1:04:21] judgment and remove him who is the head
[1:04:24] of that life so that he might be the
[1:04:27] head of that life hey man remember the
[1:04:32] word came not to the married woman of
[1:04:35] Zarephath but to the will of Serapis she
[1:04:39] had been loosed from her head and then
[1:04:43] she was ready for headship of the word
[1:04:46] are you with me now
[1:04:48] now notice is sets this sets forth the
[1:04:52] whole program of God
[1:04:54] me just say it before the devil was ever
[1:04:56] the devil before there was ever Stardust
[1:05:00] out of molecule let's go back him before
[1:05:04] that before there was any Angels any
[1:05:08] thing else
[1:05:10] it was Elohim the whole program was
[1:05:15] already laid out in the mind of God
[1:05:20] amen now these things let me just kind
[1:05:24] of pick them up and refer to him you see
[1:05:26] this is where the ground the solid
[1:05:30] ground that we are standing on as
[1:05:32] believers and to recognize that how that
[1:05:35] God will permit Satan to make a move and
[1:05:40] to work
[1:05:42] remember when things happened in Acts
[1:05:45] chapter 4 I have just referred to it for
[1:05:47] sake of time when they were let go from
[1:05:51] the hands of you know of the rulers of
[1:05:56] the Pharisees they returned back to
[1:05:58] their own company the Bible says in acts
[1:06:00] 4:23 and they themselves begin to pray
[1:06:04] I've referred to this prayer many times
[1:06:07] but this is what they said in verse 24
[1:06:10] they said Lord thou art God which made
[1:06:15] heaven and earth and the sea and all
[1:06:18] that in them is who by the mouth of thy
[1:06:21] servant David has said why did the
[1:06:24] heathen rage and the people imagine a
[1:06:26] vain thing they are declaring by a
[1:06:30] witness in their life that this
[1:06:33] situation is not above God but God is
[1:06:40] above it
[1:06:42] he's already spoke what they were
[1:06:45] witnessing they were declaring by the
[1:06:48] unction of the Spirit this is what the
[1:06:50] spirit spoke through David in Psalms 2
[1:06:54] you see what the Spirit of God did it
[1:06:56] identified the moment in the hour in the
[1:06:59] word now look what happened to them they
[1:07:02] themselves receive a refilling of the
[1:07:06] Holy Ghost in this time and they say
[1:07:09] Lord granite that thy servants they
[1:07:13] might do we might go forth with all
[1:07:16] boldness that thou would stretch forth
[1:07:19] that hand to heal it's a time of
[1:07:24] pressure there was a time of persecution
[1:07:28] as I said before this is not a time of
[1:07:31] persecution but it's still a time God is
[1:07:33] working come on somebody this is a time
[1:07:37] God is working
[1:07:39] and to think they identified these are
[1:07:43] the things I want you to look here in
[1:07:44] verse 28 how they identified it for he
[1:07:48] says for a truth verse 27 against that
[1:07:52] Holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed
[1:07:54] both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the
[1:07:56] Gentiles and the people of Israel were
[1:07:58] gathered together
[1:08:02] people were gathered together that
[1:08:05] couldn't even stand one another well was
[1:08:08] it they were assembling and gathering
[1:08:11] together against the revealed word of
[1:08:14] the hour don't even agree on doctrine
[1:08:18] but notice what happened the light
[1:08:21] presses the darkness together here's
[1:08:27] what he goes on to say for to do
[1:08:31] whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
[1:08:36] determined before to be done
[1:08:41] they were telling Dave they were this
[1:08:43] was a confession to the Lord we know
[1:08:46] you're over all these things we know
[1:08:49] that there's no we could not have been
[1:08:50] thrown in that prison we know that this
[1:08:52] persecution and all this could not have
[1:08:54] come unless you had permitted the enemy
[1:08:58] to come in this way so what was it it
[1:09:01] was not time for them to cave in they
[1:09:04] were standing upon the grounds that had
[1:09:08] been given to them as believers what I'm
[1:09:12] telling you I think it's time you stand
[1:09:15] upon the grounds that God has given to
[1:09:17] us as believers it's not enough to read
[1:09:21] about it and ain't enough even to know
[1:09:23] about it it's take the ground that
[1:09:25] belongs to you and exercise your
[1:09:28] Dominion as a son and daughter of God
[1:09:34] God let it be known I've read these
[1:09:36] scriptures many times to you here over
[1:09:38] the past months he told him in Exodus
[1:09:40] 15:26 let me just refer to it he said I
[1:09:43] will put none of the diseases upon you
[1:09:47] that I brought upon the Egyptians
[1:09:51] Yeah right notice who brought him upon
[1:09:55] the Egyptians God permitted it come on
[1:10:00] friends God in a disease but it was
[1:10:04] spoken and when the word that her
[1:10:06] hearing was the spoken and it was turned
[1:10:09] loose because of Pharaoh he rejected all
[1:10:13] he's seen was a man who looked like a
[1:10:16] vagabond a man who looked like forgive
[1:10:19] me for saying this man who is this guy
[1:10:22] I'm Pharaoh this was the most powerful
[1:10:26] nation in the earth and he looked at it
[1:10:28] in a manner me
[1:10:29] you want me to bow to you but he failed
[1:10:33] to recognize here was one though he
[1:10:35] looked very meek and lowly but it was
[1:10:38] not him he was packing the word of the
[1:10:42] King of Kings and the Lord of lords he
[1:10:44] was packing a message that was come to
[1:10:47] breathe liberty it was according to the
[1:10:50] promise of cause announcing his
[1:10:53] visitation and confirmed by the pillar
[1:10:56] of fire Pharaoh did not know who he was
[1:11:00] dealing with he won deal him with Moses
[1:11:04] no sir and this one the same Moses you
[1:11:08] seen before when you can't win what he
[1:11:10] did he took off and he ran like a
[1:11:11] scaredy cat
[1:11:12] you ain't dealing with the same guy
[1:11:14] you're dealing with a guy who's been
[1:11:16] illuminated by the promise there's been
[1:11:18] a courage and a boldness that's rose up
[1:11:20] in his life because he knows it is not
[1:11:22] by his power or by his mind it's the
[1:11:25] same God he met that same God the angel
[1:11:27] of the Lord that was there in that
[1:11:29] burning bush that was burning and did
[1:11:31] not consume that same angel the Lord the
[1:11:34] same presence of God the same spirit of
[1:11:37] God
[1:11:37] it came there and he moved within Moses
[1:11:41] brother that's exactly the way the Holy
[1:11:44] Ghost does in a life
[1:11:46] well my comes in as a consuming fire it
[1:11:49] consumes all the world and yet here you
[1:11:51] are the same old temple but there is a
[1:11:54] living fire
[1:11:56] the inside hey man it becomes a living
[1:12:00] witness as he was amazed the bushes on
[1:12:03] fire but it ain't consumed I'm telling
[1:12:05] you when the Holy Ghost is come up you
[1:12:08] have been set on fire whoo man I feel
[1:12:14] good though repeater God hallelujah
[1:12:20] he said output none of the evil diseases
[1:12:23] I want you to watch this word I don't
[1:12:29] want preach on this right now but I
[1:12:30] almost can't help it you know this this
[1:12:32] word as they went forth the word had the
[1:12:36] boundaries when the word went forth it
[1:12:41] permitted the lice he permitted disease
[1:12:44] he permitted the boils it permitted the
[1:12:46] viruses it permitted those things to
[1:12:48] come like that but remember the word
[1:12:51] laid boundary and said you cannot come
[1:12:55] upon Gosha glory minute god oh my let me
[1:13:03] just tell you there's no other place of
[1:13:04] safety but in Jesus Christ amen let all
[1:13:08] the plagues and everything wage war and
[1:13:11] things come but brother when you're
[1:13:13] anchored in Jesus Christ oh he can come
[1:13:15] upon this flesh but he can never get to
[1:13:18] this song this soul is safely sealed in
[1:13:21] the presence of Jesus Christ let me just
[1:13:27] run through this here just a moment and
[1:13:29] forgive me for saying running through it
[1:13:30] but just to put the point when Satan in
[1:13:33] Joe born if I just let me refer to a few
[1:13:35] places when he comes there to job
[1:13:40] uh-huh and it begins to talk you know
[1:13:43] and remember what he accuses god of he
[1:13:48] said you've got him all hedged up that's
[1:13:49] verse ten
[1:13:51] now what you think about how God's got
[1:13:53] him hedged up the Bible said that the
[1:13:55] angels of God are encamped round about
[1:13:59] them that fear him and love his name you
[1:14:05] are your hedge about his house
[1:14:08] you're about everything he hath on every
[1:14:11] side you see when you're in him you're
[1:14:15] looking to see the eagle you look and
[1:14:17] see the man you look and see the ox you
[1:14:19] look and see the line you see you are
[1:14:21] under the protection of the throne
[1:14:23] guards out of the word and our
[1:14:26] protection is when it come time for the
[1:14:28] ox anointing to move and maybe we've
[1:14:31] just got to subject and submit ourselves
[1:14:33] let our opinion go
[1:14:35] it moves upon our life when it's time
[1:14:38] for the lie just step forth and stand
[1:14:40] with the boldness and say no sir devil
[1:14:42] you have no foothold here the Spirit of
[1:14:45] God will manifest that characteristic
[1:14:47] through the children of God when it's
[1:14:49] time for things to be snatched away that
[1:14:53] of a child of God that's yielded and
[1:14:55] battle the anointing of the eagle moves
[1:14:57] in and it lifts us onto higher ground
[1:15:02] when it comes time to be wise as a
[1:15:05] serpent and harmless as a duck the man
[1:15:07] anointing steps in Oh glory be to God
[1:15:12] you see we are hedged about and Satan
[1:15:16] knows us well Satan is saying I can't
[1:15:18] get to him Satan let him know here
[1:15:22] brother bran would go in to dramatize
[1:15:23] this and I have heard but now I see
[1:15:26] Balarama tell us in that message I've
[1:15:28] heard but now I see he said when God
[1:15:31] came or when Satan came to God and begin
[1:15:34] to accuse he said God responded to Satan
[1:15:37] and says you can't make him do it
[1:15:41] what Satan says I'm making curse you
[1:15:44] Gervase he said you can't make him do it
[1:15:46] blue grant tells the sin and I've heard
[1:15:48] but now see and of course that's you
[1:15:49] know of going upon the words you know to
[1:15:52] put it pretty simple for you and I but
[1:15:54] notice I want you to catch these words
[1:15:57] verse 11 here Satan says but put forth
[1:16:02] thine hand talking to God and touch all
[1:16:07] that he hath and he will curse thee to
[1:16:10] your face and the Lord said unto Satan
[1:16:13] behold all that he hath is in that power
[1:16:17] you see Satan can't even bring anything
[1:16:19] your way unless it gets permission
[1:16:23] sometimes you think I gotta ask mom and
[1:16:26] dad or maybe I mean why don't I have to
[1:16:29] text my wife dad or well I says why
[1:16:31] don't have to text my husband dad you
[1:16:32] know I'm just gonna run to the store and
[1:16:34] do this or whatever here I'm just want
[1:16:35] to show you something right now Satan
[1:16:37] can't even give you a toothache he's got
[1:16:41] to get permission only upon himself put
[1:16:49] forth not thine own hand see God would
[1:16:53] have to pull back his hand but there's
[1:16:55] boundaries God said only so far is that
[1:16:59] right then notice here in the scriptures
[1:17:03] and I'm coming down
[1:17:06] when Satan touches all that he hath the
[1:17:10] Bible says in verse 15 the Sabian's came
[1:17:15] and they took the oxen
[1:17:17] who stirred up the Sabian's to come down
[1:17:20] there Satan did are you with who put
[1:17:27] within that heart to go after that I'll
[1:17:29] go after that oxen Satan did men the
[1:17:34] Bible says in verse 16 the fire of God
[1:17:37] fell from heaven and burned up the sheep
[1:17:40] let me clarify this point fire of God
[1:17:44] that means lightning let me just keep on
[1:17:50] working with this right here I'm talking
[1:17:51] about lightning verse 17 the Chaldeans
[1:17:55] came out in bands and took away the
[1:17:59] camels in verse 17 then it goes on to
[1:18:03] talk about in verse 18 and verse 19
[1:18:06] when job's children were gathered
[1:18:09] together eating and drinking in the
[1:18:11] eldest brother's house notice verse 19
[1:18:13] and behold there came a great wind from
[1:18:17] the wilderness who was in the lightning
[1:18:20] who was in the wind Satan the Bible says
[1:18:25] in Ephesians 2 he is the Prince and
[1:18:27] power of the air
[1:18:30] notice how brother Anna puts it in
[1:18:32] future home this is why even as we head
[1:18:36] into the Millennium even going into the
[1:18:39] Millennium remember coming into the
[1:18:43] Millennium there's going to be a baptism
[1:18:45] of fire because also an issuing of fire
[1:18:48] is a cleansing
[1:18:50] it comes in to them we as we come in to
[1:18:54] the Millennium this is where even in the
[1:18:56] millennium diseases are done away with
[1:18:58] germs are done away with Satan's Satan's
[1:19:02] bound with a chain of circumstance are
[1:19:04] you with me now Satan is bound is that
[1:19:07] right and to think of all of this of
[1:19:10] that will take place wouldn't even as it
[1:19:13] would come under the rulership just in
[1:19:15] the Millennium now under the rulership
[1:19:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ and the sons
[1:19:20] and daughters of God but yet now he is
[1:19:23] the Prince and power of the air
[1:19:25] what troubled him says it he said he
[1:19:27] keeps off or wars off the blessings from
[1:19:31] God talking about remember when Daniel
[1:19:33] was praying he prayed for 21 days and he
[1:19:36] prayed and remember as Gabriel was
[1:19:39] coming with an answer he got stopped by
[1:19:43] the Prince of Persia the Prince of
[1:19:45] Persia was a demon that was in charge of
[1:19:48] that area remember Jesus member was
[1:19:52] taken up on the Mount and Satan said
[1:19:54] I'll give you all the kingdoms of the
[1:19:56] world if you will bow down and worship
[1:19:58] me there is a spirit over every nation
[1:20:03] come on when those angels fail when the
[1:20:06] rebellion was led in heaven and remember
[1:20:09] that was a third of them that were cast
[1:20:12] out remember they never lost their rank
[1:20:14] they kept their ranks coming down here
[1:20:17] this is why over government's over
[1:20:21] States over counties and over cities
[1:20:25] think of this when the Prophet was
[1:20:28] standing there out there in Oregon and
[1:20:30] that mania it was not a man who was a
[1:20:33] maniac here was it was demon powers that
[1:20:36] had that man bound and he came to that
[1:20:39] platform and he challenged there the
[1:20:42] Prophet and brother Graham said the Holy
[1:20:44] Ghost accepted Satan's challenge and he
[1:20:48] said you will fall across my feet this
[1:20:51] night that was not William Branham
[1:20:54] speaking it was the Holy Spirit using
[1:20:57] the voice of brother Branham that was
[1:20:59] surrendered to God and what happened
[1:21:02] there
[1:21:03] night that man drew back he spit in his
[1:21:06] face again and when he went to hit him
[1:21:08] he was like the wind left him and he
[1:21:11] fell across his feet brother branham
[1:21:14] said at that moment he said everybody in
[1:21:17] cots in wheelchairs everyone that was
[1:21:20] sick they got up he said - what happened
[1:21:23] is every one of those demons that were
[1:21:26] lower
[1:21:26] imps they saw the chief of their tribe
[1:21:30] had been defeated Alleluia
[1:21:37] what happened there they couldn't stand
[1:21:40] when their chief had been defeated
[1:21:45] there's a demon over this city come on
[1:21:50] now there's demons over these states
[1:21:53] demons over these countries the reason
[1:21:58] wars come about God permits it brother
[1:22:00] Graham so what happens is these spirits
[1:22:02] get jealous of one another
[1:22:05] seeing Satan's Kingdom it's a kingdom of
[1:22:08] positioning Hoban aren't you glad God
[1:22:12] delivers you from that he goes on to say
[1:22:16] in their in their The Prince and pound
[1:22:19] there in there comes Thunderbolts of
[1:22:22] lightning strikes the earth
[1:22:27] they need to rewrite the insurance plans
[1:22:31] other house we lived at I'll never
[1:22:33] forget one night man had the lightning
[1:22:36] it struck that house not only struck our
[1:22:38] house it struck the neighbor's house
[1:22:40] it knocked every one of their appliances
[1:22:42] out microwave stove refrigerator
[1:22:44] everything they had in their house it
[1:22:46] fried it
[1:22:47] one thing that hit on mine was my
[1:22:49] intercom system that went throughout the
[1:22:51] whole house but buddy I mean it was loud
[1:22:54] now you know what when I went to go make
[1:22:56] that claim I really didn't want to make
[1:23:01] the claim because I didn't want nothing
[1:23:02] to be against my record but I realized
[1:23:05] you know what this is a little bit more
[1:23:06] I'm not gonna be able to take care of
[1:23:07] this I better enforce my insurance but
[1:23:10] you know what they have on there and
[1:23:11] it's a bold-faced lie it says it's an
[1:23:14] act of God that's a lie
[1:23:16] it's not an act of God here when this
[1:23:19] said the fire of God fell from the sky
[1:23:21] it was not it was not God it's giving us
[1:23:24] it was lightning God permitted the
[1:23:27] lightning God permitted that great wind
[1:23:29] all of this then it came about upon
[1:23:32] job's life makes you want to go home and
[1:23:38] highlight out your insurance policy an
[1:23:40] act of Satan not an act of God
[1:23:44] notice how Joe would worship you know
[1:23:47] the Lord gave the Lord taketh away job
[1:23:49] was standing on his sacrifice
[1:23:53] the scripture goes on to say of how that
[1:23:58] the Lord notice what God says in job 2 3
[1:24:00] I'm trying to come down and close now he
[1:24:03] says you know here's the God testifying
[1:24:06] a job he said he hold it fast his
[1:24:08] integrity although thou movers me
[1:24:12] against him to destroy him without cause
[1:24:17] you see this was not because job was a
[1:24:21] sinner Joe had a perfect sacrifice he
[1:24:26] had a perfect revelation in that
[1:24:28] sacrifice he had solid ground he would
[1:24:30] stand in there job do you know what's
[1:24:34] going on I don't
[1:24:37] do you know what's taking place no I
[1:24:39] don't jump do you know it's gonna come
[1:24:42] out I don't remember
[1:24:44] he stood his brother Hamid saying like
[1:24:46] this flat footed he said any new by
[1:24:51] being a prophet God visits by
[1:24:53] inspiration but he said he knew at that
[1:24:55] time I don't know what's taking place
[1:24:58] but God's in control
[1:25:02] you see Satan then answers him we know
[1:25:06] skin for skin verse four
[1:25:08] yay all that a man hath he will give for
[1:25:09] his life but put forth that hand now
[1:25:12] notice how Satan speaks to the Lord put
[1:25:15] forth valve on hand now touch his bone
[1:25:18] his flesh and he will curse thee to thy
[1:25:20] faith see if we stop right there in your
[1:25:23] mind - pervs say well it's God touching
[1:25:25] no it's not God touching God's moving
[1:25:27] back the hand to a certain place for
[1:25:30] Satan
[1:25:30] so Satan can move upon him
[1:25:34] and the Lord said unto Satan behold he
[1:25:37] is in thine hand but save his life the
[1:25:42] Bible said he went forth in verse 7 and
[1:25:44] he smoked Jobe with boils from the sole
[1:25:46] of his foot unto his crown this is where
[1:25:49] the devil this is where Satan gets many
[1:25:52] people many times where they think
[1:25:56] everything ought to be good everything
[1:25:59] ought to be easy and this ought to be a
[1:26:01] picnic and let me just be honest friends
[1:26:03] every one of us all of everybody that's
[1:26:05] listening tonight there's not one of us
[1:26:07] that raises our hand and say you know
[1:26:09] what I love calamity if you're raising
[1:26:11] your hand let me go ahead and tell you
[1:26:13] you're lying because our flesh and our
[1:26:16] spirit does not like tribulation we
[1:26:20] don't like persecution we don't like
[1:26:23] famine we don't like anything that takes
[1:26:25] us out of the ordinary anything that
[1:26:28] puts a little bit of pressure we don't
[1:26:31] like it there right but yet within
[1:26:35] everything notice in this situation God
[1:26:40] permitted God was over it there was only
[1:26:45] so far that Satan could go this is why
[1:26:51] with sickness when sickness comes
[1:26:54] it's like even how close that this
[1:26:58] coronavirus how close has come to our
[1:27:00] own ranks
[1:27:02] who heads Ben you see he wasn't
[1:27:06] something to wear you know when we hear
[1:27:09] it even among others you see even when
[1:27:12] God is permitted we know it Satan God is
[1:27:15] permitted it
[1:27:17] it's a reminder as I've said before
[1:27:20] everything every sickness every test
[1:27:23] every trial everything comes away it's
[1:27:26] not just a molding and shaping of our
[1:27:28] character but it's a reminder this is
[1:27:32] not your resting place this is not our
[1:27:37] home if we had no discomfort we'd get
[1:27:45] more comfortable here we'd get more
[1:27:47] comfortable God doesn't want us to be
[1:27:50] comfortable here he wants us to be
[1:27:53] looking to him this world is not our
[1:27:58] home we're not of this world
[1:28:03] this is why when sickness and different
[1:28:06] things would come remember
[1:28:09] God takes us brother Brandon would take
[1:28:11] us back into the scriptures in Genesis
[1:28:14] 18 we're in that Abraham look at this
[1:28:17] mount here is Abraham standing in a time
[1:28:21] when the revealing of the son of man has
[1:28:24] come
[1:28:24] speaking of even a time that we're
[1:28:26] living in and he would make a statement
[1:28:28] then that you know that Lord you will
[1:28:31] not slay the righteous with the wicked
[1:28:33] and that the righteous should be as the
[1:28:35] wicked be it far from thee shall not the
[1:28:38] judge of all the earth do right and
[1:28:41] brother Branham takes that up and he too
[1:28:42] answers a question he says brother
[1:28:44] Branham you say how can we how can a
[1:28:47] believer a believer get sick and he
[1:28:49] quotes that scripture shall not the
[1:28:51] judge of all the earth do right he said
[1:28:54] God will allow us sickness to come right
[1:28:56] back along and prove to you the
[1:28:59] resurrection
[1:29:03] God permits those things
[1:29:07] now let me close in this this scripture
[1:29:13] said may and all these things were more
[1:29:15] than conquerors I want to read that in
[1:29:17] the amplified version
[1:29:20] yay amid all these things we are more
[1:29:25] than conquerors and gain a surpassing
[1:29:29] victory through him who loved us how
[1:29:36] through him who loved us
[1:29:39] for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:29:44] nor life nor Angels nor principalities
[1:29:48] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:29:53] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:29:56] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:29:58] us from the love of God which is Christ
[1:30:01] Jesus our Lord
[1:30:04] do we understand everything as it's
[1:30:07] happening no no brother Brown I'm in a
[1:30:12] personal letter a personal letter to the
[1:30:15] stance cliff family you remember the
[1:30:17] stance cliff lamb family is the one that
[1:30:18] had the little baby over in Germany and
[1:30:21] they had a right of private military jet
[1:30:24] waiting it's a fly brother branham from
[1:30:26] here over there to pray for that baby
[1:30:28] it's all right
[1:30:30] but the Lord after brother Branham was
[1:30:32] praying and asking God the angel of the
[1:30:35] Lord told him don't touch this it's of
[1:30:38] the Lord now for our minds to be able to
[1:30:42] comprehend that there's no way I can
[1:30:44] comprehend that but I know one thing he
[1:30:46] does everything right and well blue
[1:30:51] brown would write to them and he said
[1:30:53] this is what he wrote to the stats for
[1:30:55] family it wasn't something that Satan
[1:30:58] slipped up on it was the plan and
[1:31:03] program of God brother sister stance
[1:31:08] cliff how can I make you see that now no
[1:31:11] more than I could when I went into the
[1:31:14] room and little Sharon and God refused
[1:31:16] to hear me
[1:31:17] see what he's saying there's no way for
[1:31:19] you to understand that now when I went
[1:31:22] through it with Sharon I couldn't
[1:31:23] understand it I couldn't understand it
[1:31:27] then how that would be his program but
[1:31:33] he said look what that little story has
[1:31:35] done it's brought thousands to Christ
[1:31:39] he said a few weeks ago I was out on the
[1:31:41] hillside riding to them I was out on the
[1:31:43] hillside and I was squirrel hunting
[1:31:46] then I thought when I came by a familiar
[1:31:48] place well things has changed a lot
[1:31:53] since then
[1:31:55] but I looked at the sorrow
[1:31:58] he said if things if you'd go through it
[1:32:02] would you do it if you had to go back
[1:32:05] over this was being asked to brother
[1:32:07] branham would you go back over it would
[1:32:09] you go back through that sorrow
[1:32:13] if you had to go back over life first he
[1:32:17] said I said I don't believe I would
[1:32:20] notice would you go back through the
[1:32:22] sorrow again no I don't believe I would
[1:32:25] hardships trials tribulations the Samuel
[1:32:29] thinks you went through as a pastor
[1:32:31] would you go back through him again
[1:32:32] first response is no no I wouldn't
[1:32:40] he said but now something said but look
[1:32:45] at the thousands of souls that's been
[1:32:47] saved
[1:32:47] you see there's experiences that come
[1:32:50] out of our lives and then you don't live
[1:32:53] the gospel neither do I preach the
[1:32:55] gospel without an experience and without
[1:32:58] experiences some by knowledge is by
[1:33:02] experiences
[1:33:05] he said god yes I told him yes then yes
[1:33:09] I'd go through it again anything for
[1:33:12] your kingdom
[1:33:14] remember because of that scene his
[1:33:17] little baby with cross eyes brother
[1:33:20] Brahim says he'll never be a cross side
[1:33:22] baby come across this platform and leave
[1:33:24] out without it being crew without it
[1:33:26] that's eyes being straightened
[1:33:27] there wasn't one baby that came across
[1:33:29] or a little child cross-eyed that he
[1:33:31] didn't make it to the other side its
[1:33:32] eyes was already streamed
[1:33:34] was able to enter in because of that
[1:33:37] need
[1:33:37] I'm telling you brother not only were
[1:33:40] their eyes straighten but there were
[1:33:41] lives that were turned around why all
[1:33:45] things work together for the good we
[1:33:49] don't know is is like what this virus
[1:33:51] that's a bonus and these things it's all
[1:33:54] around another sister we don't know but
[1:34:00] there's one thing we do know we're
[1:34:02] knowing whom we have believed you know
[1:34:06] what grounds you're standing on and we
[1:34:09] know that within all this right here
[1:34:11] nothing who shall be able to separate us
[1:34:17] who can do it tribulation nothing that
[1:34:22] Satan can bring can separate us from the
[1:34:26] love of God thank God for his anchor
[1:34:32] thank God for solid ground that we can
[1:34:36] stand on and I say tonight if you're not
[1:34:40] standing on solid ground get on solid
[1:34:43] ground tonight

[1:36:19] worst disease I can think of right now

[1:38:48] father
[1:38:51] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:58] you know I think of even when sickness
[1:39:01] sometimes it comes sometimes God we know
[1:39:04] sometimes God have permit that sickness
[1:39:06] sometimes to correct us if he needs to
[1:39:09] correct us a little bit remember how God
[1:39:13] would allow Paul his eyes would flare up
[1:39:18] every once in a while Paul was able to
[1:39:22] identify there was a messenger of Satan
[1:39:24] that had come to buffett me
[1:39:27] God didn't hmm you know change his
[1:39:31] eyesight make his eyesight go bad and
[1:39:33] then come back didn't remember Satan
[1:39:35] came to afflict him but there was only
[1:39:37] boundaries where he could go to but in
[1:39:41] all of that Paul realized he said I'm
[1:39:45] not going to complain
[1:39:47] I'm gonna glory in my infirmities Paul
[1:39:50] was not going around and say oh I'm so
[1:39:53] glad that I can't see right this is a
[1:39:55] blessing of God no no that's not what it
[1:39:57] means
[1:39:58] it means he glory God let him know Paul
[1:40:02] I already heard your prayer you've
[1:40:04] sucked me three times for this to remove
[1:40:06] it but Paul want you to know I don't
[1:40:10] ever want you to rise too high in your
[1:40:12] own thinking I don't want you to ever
[1:40:15] get to where you get too dependent on
