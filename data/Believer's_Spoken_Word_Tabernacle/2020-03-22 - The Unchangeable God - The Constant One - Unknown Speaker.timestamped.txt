[24:43] and we certainly desire that the Lord
[24:46] would have his way in our lives and we
[24:50] just so thankful for his mercy so
[24:54] thankful that God even in the midst of
[24:57] the time that we're in that God has
[25:00] afforded a way in a measure that we are
[25:04] able to be able to still gather around
[25:09] the word of the Lord and we believe that
[25:12] even in times like this we don't we know
[25:15] for sure that God he manifests himself
[25:18] even even so real in these times and so
[25:24] I just want to just admonish you those
[25:28] that are are gathered as you're gathered
[25:31] there at home just to admonish you that
[25:35] let your home be a place that the Holy
[25:38] Spirit we're in that the Lord is welcome
[25:41] but even in this time here just to say
[25:44] Lord you're still God that you would
[25:48] come and minister to our knees our lives
[25:53] right here and just let it be a time
[25:56] where we just let the Lord just come and
[25:58] speak to our hearts we
[26:02] we realized that in the time that we are
[26:06] we are living in we I think God for the
[26:11] opportunity that we have we have had
[26:14] even had pastors different ones that had
[26:17] contacted me towards the latter part of
[26:20] the week and things and I you know some
[26:23] that they're trying to come up with
[26:27] means and order ways to try to meet with
[26:30] their congregations and different things
[26:33] that I could do to try to help them make
[26:36] them aware of certain things but I want
[26:38] to say that I think God that he's
[26:40] provided for us that we can do that and
[26:43] we can still have service and gather
[26:45] around the word of the Lord it's not the
[26:48] ideal situation as far as where we're at
[26:51] home instead of being here but yet
[26:52] within these times remember God is still
[26:56] God and so I want to just say
[27:02] this morning thank you mom
[27:06] during this time I want to just to
[27:09] encourage you there are needs like you
[27:13] heard mentioned in the prayer requests
[27:14] and we want to continue to hold one
[27:18] another up in in prayer
[27:21] remembering brother herb just been
[27:25] trying to get in contact here with
[27:26] sister Rita once again we want to
[27:29] remember brother herb in prayer God
[27:30] would just continue to strengthen him
[27:32] also brother Mark as he's coming through
[27:36] his recovery and we want to just
[27:39] continue to hold them up in prayer
[27:42] there's many different needs that are
[27:45] among us and I want to say this if the
[27:50] greatest thing that we can do even and
[27:52] we find during this time we need one
[27:56] another we're not able together here
[27:59] right now and as far as we really feel
[28:02] in our hearts just to comply with what
[28:04] they are asking us we have a it's not
[28:07] it's also the protection thinking of the
[28:09] people that are gathered here and we
[28:13] need one another during this time and I
[28:15] really want to admonish you those of you
[28:18] there out there you're listening stay in
[28:20] contact with one another and let me just
[28:23] be very clear don't just stay in contact
[28:27] with the three or four or five people
[28:29] that you normally stay in contact with
[28:31] do that and more be let us be purposeful
[28:36] and in this time checking on one another
[28:39] calling one another and and following up
[28:42] and not just during this time this would
[28:43] be a good thing that would bring about a
[28:46] good change that would be a good change
[28:49] to where we get out of certain things
[28:51] that we need to be changed where we need
[28:54] to be able into that place and so and
[28:57] just to do that too just to contact one
[29:00] another you know calling one another
[29:03] sending a text to one another during
[29:06] this time it's very important during
[29:08] this time and just to remind you in the
[29:11] scripture the Bible says that he that
[29:14] showeth himself friendly
[29:16] has friends so if you're waiting on
[29:19] somebody to contact you maybe gods
[29:21] wanting you to fulfill that part in the
[29:23] scripture that you would show yourself
[29:25] friendly so we want to fulfill the word
[29:28] we want to be we see it in the early
[29:30] church when situations arose they they
[29:35] would they would really come together
[29:39] and so would that's exactly where our
[29:41] hearts are we want to be able to reach
[29:45] out and stay in contact with one another
[29:46] throughout these times also to mention
[29:50] this is mainly for the young young
[29:52] people I'm going to be sending out an
[29:56] email for those that gather there on the
[29:59] the fridays there at our home i'm going
[30:04] to be sending an email there's a there
[30:06] is a an app in a way that we can
[30:10] actually have our youth meeting but
[30:11] we'll have it over online so we can see
[30:14] one another and i can get a chance to
[30:16] interact with you online and and so it's
[30:21] not idea we won't ideal we won't get to
[30:24] eat the snacks and things but and and
[30:27] our pizza but maybe i'll eat a piece in
[30:29] front of you over the inner internet but
[30:32] we just we want to be able to do that
[30:34] and so i'll be reaching out to you
[30:36] tomorrow and i'll just need the email of
[30:39] what i can use in order to get that
[30:41] visual communication so we can go ahead
[30:44] with our youth meeting throughout this
[30:46] time i think that's pretty much it that
[30:51] i wanted to mention
[30:52] you know with with you as an assembly
[30:55] we're trying to do all we can to comply
[30:58] with what they've asked they've said 215
[31:00] days and we we're just looking at that
[31:04] right now we want i want to admonish you
[31:06] to keep everything in prayer keep those
[31:08] in prayer that our leaders keep those in
[31:12] prayer because the decisions that they
[31:14] have to make are not easy decisions and
[31:16] they're trying to do things all these
[31:18] decisions are being made are being our
[31:21] decisions that are being made for the
[31:23] benefit and to and to benefit the
[31:26] citizens of our country
[31:29] our state and city and I I don't know if
[31:31] some of you had the opportunity if you
[31:33] have it yesterday I I thought it was
[31:37] very interesting you you here where it
[31:40] is mentioned about the Spanish flu that
[31:43] came in among 1918 and there was a real
[31:48] interesting document from the city of
[31:52] Cleveland where it was commissioned and
[31:54] what took place during that time they
[31:56] closed down everything they would there
[32:00] was no of course back then there was no
[32:01] such option as streaming a service and
[32:04] so they closed where I was when I was
[32:06] bullying number one of this whole sheet
[32:09] and I thought it was a very interesting
[32:12] article that was wrote there by our
[32:16] local stations here in their news clip
[32:19] and I just read it and you know we're
[32:22] living in a time where with a world it's
[32:27] a time of uncertainty and uncertainty no
[32:31] matter in what it is it always comes
[32:35] with an opportunity where fear can step
[32:38] in and we all face uncertainty at times
[32:42] in our lives
[32:43] there's things sometimes that if you we
[32:46] start to think ahead too far then we
[32:49] venture into territory that does not
[32:52] belong to us it belongs to God remember
[32:55] we only take the land as we come to it
[32:58] so this is exactly where we we want to
[33:01] just rest in the Lord and just wait on
[33:04] the Lord and you know just just look
[33:08] into to him in this time and just
[33:12] trusting him for leadership and guidance
[33:14] within it all so if you know if you need
[33:20] to reach me during this time you can
[33:21] reach me as though at any other time
[33:23] it's you know about text or what have
[33:27] you but I think it's a time that there's
[33:29] so many things that we have already been
[33:32] looking at and examining within the Word
[33:35] of God and you know it's a time to be
[33:38] sure
[33:40] it's it's a time to be sure it's a time
[33:43] to evaluate it's a time to check up it's
[33:46] a time to look and it's a time that our
[33:50] expectation should not be in in the
[33:53] manner of that well this this is going
[33:56] to be done away with but our
[33:58] expectations should be on the Lord
[34:00] because remember you know these are let
[34:03] me just say it like this if I can say it
[34:05] in this manner these things that we are
[34:07] seeing just as there are preambles of
[34:10] the Constitution of our of our united
[34:13] states these plagues are preambles of
[34:16] the tribulation these things are our
[34:19] preambles of what and this was very
[34:21] minor to what the things will be it's
[34:24] very very minor the Scriptures speak of
[34:27] these these things in in the Book of
[34:30] Revelations and perhaps we would be able
[34:32] to move within some of those parts but
[34:35] we know where we are standing in this
[34:38] hour and that is what that is something
[34:41] that we take a great comfort from so I
[34:44] want to look in the word of the Lord
[34:47] upon something here that God has so just
[34:51] the other day in the office we were we
[34:56] were praying and my wife and I were
[34:58] praying together for some different
[35:00] needs and the Holy Spirit just spoke to
[35:03] my heart right there in prayer and it
[35:05] just these things just begin to just
[35:09] begin to move out of through my heart
[35:11] and I want to read in the scripture in
[35:13] job 23 3 it's just one scripture that I
[35:16] want to read but it says like this job
[35:20] says all that I knew where I might find
[35:24] him that I might come even to his seat
[35:31] Amen may God bless you and bless the
[35:34] reading of the word I I think of this
[35:39] approach it's a great desire that an
[35:43] individual or a person would have in
[35:45] that they might find him and I I think
[35:49] the expression to which that you know
[35:53] job would right here he wants jobs in
[35:57] the midst of a situation in his life and
[36:01] we find ourselves in times in the midst
[36:05] of many different situations that they
[36:08] change and even with a life and a heart
[36:12] that is seeking after God seeking for
[36:15] answers seeking for the emptiness that
[36:18] is there and we could try to you know if
[36:21] I could say it like this the this Satan
[36:24] has nothing but empty promises his
[36:29] promises they hold no satisfaction they
[36:32] it only becomes something that is
[36:35] temporary and the Bible would say that
[36:37] that that pleasure is but for a season
[36:40] no matter how many duration of years
[36:43] that a person would have but it's only
[36:44] for that of a season James would call it
[36:47] that our life is but a vapor and Jobe
[36:50] noticed this longing you know there's a
[36:53] longing within job's heart that I might
[36:55] come even to his seat where he is
[36:58] abiding where he's dwelling where he is
[37:00] at and to think of this that there is a
[37:03] call there's a hunger even from the very
[37:05] beginning when when man fell away from
[37:10] the Word of God there was a hunger and a
[37:12] desire to get back in to that of life
[37:16] there was a hunger and God knowing that
[37:19] that desire would be there knowing that
[37:21] his children would have a longing to get
[37:24] back to life and the reality is that
[37:27] everything that we find within around us
[37:30] it is people that are individuals that
[37:33] are thirsting for life and everyone that
[37:35] I'm talking to on the internet from the
[37:37] assembly the few that are here you
[37:40] realize that we all were in that place
[37:43] we were seeking for things that nothing
[37:47] could satisfy but God in His mercy
[37:51] we couldn't find where he was at we
[37:54] could not find that but remember when
[37:56] the fall come he put there a cherubim
[37:59] with a flaming sword and the sword is
[38:02] the word of the Lord and that sword was
[38:05] in order to keep the
[38:06] way under the tree of life knowing that
[38:09] God himself there's no way that man
[38:12] could get to God but God would come to
[38:16] man God would come dan sinned and God
[38:19] would come into a place to where he
[38:22] would be able to bring about and restore
[38:26] a communion with man in the very heart
[38:29] of man and bring man into a place where
[38:32] man would have access into his seat into
[38:35] his throne because to think of it when
[38:37] God Himself now is received in his seat
[38:41] in his throne this is where his power
[38:43] his authority and to recognize that job
[38:47] there was a desire there was a calling
[38:49] for that which that there would be that
[38:53] of one who would manifest his authority
[38:58] manifest his power in his life and
[39:01] that's exactly what the earth is
[39:04] groaning for right now now when I look
[39:08] at this scripture I think of another
[39:11] scripture here because wherever that God
[39:16] has been found he still can be found
[39:21] he's the same yesterday today and
[39:25] forever
[39:27] he might change his mask but he never
[39:30] changes his nature
[39:33] hey man it's just like you know I can
[39:36] look in some of you that are streaming
[39:38] whoever you are
[39:40] whether has life as evolved when you
[39:43] were as a son or a daughter of your
[39:46] earthly parents it evolves then you
[39:49] become that of a whether you know a
[39:51] spouse whether it be husband or it be
[39:55] wife then from there evolves you become
[39:58] father or a mother then from there it
[40:01] evolves you become a grandfather or
[40:03] grandmother you're not multiple persons
[40:06] you are the same person we being
[40:09] revealed in many different masks or
[40:12] offices or attributes that are already
[40:15] within you and that's the same way with
[40:17] God all of these
[40:19] or with in God and God was manifested
[40:23] through every one of these attributes
[40:25] and the comfort within it all among his
[40:28] children is that through it all he still
[40:32] remains the same so we find how God will
[40:40] reveal himself to be the same to every
[40:44] generation in the book of Malachi
[40:47] chapter 3 verse 6 it says for I am the
[40:53] Lord I change not therefore ye sons of
[41:00] Jacob are not consumed thank God that he
[41:08] is the unchangeable one and that's what
[41:12] I want to deal with here this morning
[41:14] just to take a little bit of time with
[41:16] it on the unchangeable God and the real
[41:19] part of the thought that pulsates in my
[41:21] heart is the constant one anything
[41:26] that's constant cannot change it can't
[41:31] change it remains the same
[41:34] it cannot be altered it's not modified
[41:38] it's not reformed if it can be in any
[41:42] way then it has been changed it's it's
[41:47] been lessened been reduced from what it
[41:52] is and this is why the word would speak
[41:54] to you and I that he who would take away
[41:58] in the book of Revelation whoever takes
[42:00] away from the word or adds to it his
[42:03] part shall be taken away we're living
[42:08] and I think we all are in agreeance of
[42:11] this we are living in a changing time
[42:13] and I'll tell you within the past the
[42:18] past well really the past couple months
[42:22] from you know even when these things
[42:25] were already identified over there in
[42:27] China
[42:29] and I even though that really the first
[42:32] case was identified here in the states I
[42:35] think it was you know January 21st but
[42:38] in reality you know we look at their
[42:41] testing more and more and we know
[42:44] there's gonna be more cases that would
[42:46] come about because how many were already
[42:47] here before they identified the first
[42:49] one the more testing you do the more
[42:52] you're going to find so the you know the
[42:56] things that that are present even where
[42:59] things have changed so quickly and no
[43:04] island doubtedly you know I would say
[43:06] this right this you know in this in this
[43:09] regards as believers this too shall pass
[43:12] do we God God is seeing us through this
[43:16] the midst of this time the changing
[43:20] within it though there are things that
[43:22] we what we don't know is out of all of
[43:25] this what things we'll go back to the
[43:29] way they were and then what things are
[43:31] changed from here on out we don't know
[43:34] that neither is it for us to be given or
[43:38] concerned with that one thing about it
[43:42] is that when we look at this and keeping
[43:45] the thought in our hearts as we speak
[43:47] this morning on the unchangeable God and
[43:50] the constant one we know that there are
[43:53] things that perhaps that will be changed
[43:55] that will be changed for the better
[43:57] there can be things that will come about
[44:00] that would be you know perhaps change
[44:02] for the better then there's going to be
[44:03] things that where we will have to modify
[44:06] in our lives and certain things that
[44:08] maybe that we once were able to do maybe
[44:11] certain hours where we were able to go
[44:14] to different places certain things no
[44:16] doubt will change and I think you know
[44:19] of there's some things that I you know
[44:22] kind of look at this that even with the
[44:24] change and things like this through even
[44:26] this time that we're together here
[44:28] there's some things that I've got to
[44:30] look at and thought well it's brought me
[44:32] even to a place to realize that even if
[44:34] it God Terry's next year and snow or ice
[44:37] hit the ground then we might have to
[44:39] cancel people coming here but I can
[44:41] still deliver
[44:42] the word of the Lord for that service so
[44:45] there's things that were we're looking
[44:47] at and through it all we want to we just
[44:50] want to keep our eyes on the Lord
[44:52] because God is guiding us through this
[44:54] time we are truly living in that time
[44:59] everything is changing and if we just
[45:00] kind of maybe digress from this
[45:03] situation and step back and just to look
[45:06] before even this situation of that you
[45:11] know the the coronavirus before all of
[45:13] that you already identified that there
[45:16] are changes that take place all around
[45:18] us you know you come into certain
[45:20] neighborhoods and I don't know maybe if
[45:22] any of you drive back in certain places
[45:23] where you were raised
[45:25] places you grew up you see sometimes the
[45:28] house ain't even there sometimes you see
[45:30] that Street has been altered maybe
[45:32] they've changed they've rerouted I know
[45:34] even the the city where the school where
[45:36] I graduated from they completely altered
[45:39] a street altogether in order to make way
[45:43] for a parking garage at a hospital it
[45:45] completely changed the way that that
[45:48] route was through there there are
[45:50] changes that come about and everything
[45:52] itself is is so different cities change
[45:55] there's changes even when we look at it
[45:58] in our local city here of of Lorraine
[46:01] hey the way that you used to go down
[46:03] Broadway Avenue that's changing there's
[46:06] changes that's come about and change as
[46:08] you know man is always looking at things
[46:12] and to change it we find the changes of
[46:14] businesses clothes we find things if I
[46:16] can speak so even you know of the young
[46:19] ones see it as well there's certain
[46:21] things that close that of businesses and
[46:24] things like malls and and places that
[46:26] once we're a very busy metropolis or
[46:31] busy area now it becomes like a ghost
[46:33] town and we find we find things they
[46:36] change things change all around us
[46:39] sometimes there's even things that you
[46:41] change on the inside of your house
[46:43] there's things maybe colors you change
[46:45] and you know this is now the new color
[46:47] this is now the the new thing there's
[46:50] things that's constantly changing year
[46:52] after year politics change
[46:56] nations are changing we've watched we've
[47:00] witnessed here within the past years and
[47:03] I think about you know specifically over
[47:05] the period of time that our from our
[47:08] from our oldest son Paul who's 19 soon
[47:11] to be 20 I think about during the period
[47:13] of time over their lives and even when
[47:15] the very day that that that Benjamin was
[47:18] being born at the very day the very the
[47:20] very time I was looking at on a screen
[47:22] there in the hospital when they were
[47:24] taking down the very statue of Saddam
[47:26] Hussein day and in many things we see
[47:29] that what happened in that area it
[47:31] changed the landscape
[47:32] it changed the powers that changed
[47:35] things
[47:35] that were there things are changing we
[47:38] even recognize God already spoke by his
[47:41] word all in the scriptures from the old
[47:44] into the new that there would be a
[47:48] reviving even of the old Roman Empire
[47:50] its borders would come back that's why
[47:53] even when we look at the middle wall of
[47:56] between East Germany and West Germany
[47:58] that wall had to come down we see even
[48:02] the borders even where that old Roman
[48:04] Empire its borders its boundaries and
[48:07] being coming back into that into that
[48:10] place but also just as much as that is
[48:14] coming back into its place the real
[48:16] bride of Jesus Christ the believer God
[48:20] has laid landmarks down in his word by
[48:23] his presence that were man now Satan has
[48:27] wanted to encroach and move those
[48:29] landmarks and bring changes to where
[48:32] things no longer no longer is calling
[48:35] allowed to be the same God and we find
[48:38] that but God made a promise that I will
[48:41] give you back your land I will give you
[48:44] back your borders and that which belongs
[48:47] to you and as a matter of fact we are
[48:50] standing here like the widow under the
[48:52] ministry of Elijah and we recognize hey
[48:55] our land has been taken but God has
[48:58] appointed an officer to be able to
[49:00] execute but keep the king's command to
[49:03] bring back the borders and the
[49:06] that belonged to us this land I'm
[49:08] talking about is the genuine land of the
[49:11] real baptism of the Holy Ghost a man and
[49:15] that officer that has been important
[49:17] then that hasn't come about to execute
[49:20] the commandment of the king of the war
[49:22] is the Holy Spirit himself so we are
[49:26] resting in the midst of all of this and
[49:28] change here and change there but yet to
[49:31] know that the Holy Spirit is present to
[49:34] execute every word that he has promised
[49:38] every boundary every part is given to us
[49:43] in Christ Jesus I think about you know
[49:47] I've not been back to where where my
[49:51] momma you know grew up I haven't been
[49:54] back down in that area my brother has
[49:56] drove around down there around in the
[49:57] Blair and Logan areas but I've heard
[50:01] tell of it and I have you know you drive
[50:03] in certain times where places you know
[50:07] what we called hollers and I know some
[50:10] of you don't know what a holler is and
[50:11] that ain't just callin people to dinner
[50:13] either it's an actual place where he
[50:15] driving up between the mountains but the
[50:19] things where people come in through
[50:20] mining and strip mining they had a it's
[50:23] unbelievable I did see when I was 18
[50:26] years old when they started to move into
[50:28] that area and my aunt Barbara would
[50:30] point out she pointed out some of the
[50:31] big equipment that was up there on the
[50:33] hill around Sharples I look back into
[50:36] those into those times I couldn't I
[50:38] didn't know machinery there it was
[50:39] machinery that big I don't even know how
[50:41] they got it up there but it has so
[50:44] changed it's longer mountains it's just
[50:46] one big leveled place because why
[50:49] because man has sought to to extract
[50:53] something from the earth and man has
[50:55] brought about a change it's changed it's
[50:57] it's no longer the same they told me
[51:00] they said you wouldn't even recognize
[51:01] that I've tried to you know look at
[51:03] different videos or people driving up
[51:05] through there and and you know you try
[51:07] to find landmarks and really the
[51:09] landmarks themselves as far as with
[51:11] schools here and there those things are
[51:13] removed there are certain things that
[51:15] could be pointed out of certain houses
[51:17] but my point is is that
[51:19] change scenery changes look the weather
[51:23] changes I mean you know everybody makes
[51:26] a statement and they say well you know
[51:28] stick around in Ohio it'll change every
[51:30] state says that I hate to disappoint the
[51:33] Ohioans and think we got a cliche on
[51:35] something you don't everywhere you go
[51:38] when I've been in this state or I've
[51:39] been in this country everybody says the
[51:42] same thing because why I don't care what
[51:44] they talk about with whether we know
[51:46] climate is more of the predictability
[51:49] weather is what can change from day to
[51:51] day but you recognize that even among
[51:53] those things things change people change
[52:00] the reality of it is right now is that
[52:04] even you know for somebody to know if
[52:07] their neighbor died somebody have to
[52:08] tell them or they read it in the paper
[52:10] it used to be there were people where
[52:13] neighbors used to be where people were
[52:16] friendly people change people go in you
[52:21] know even even they go in I never forget
[52:24] we were in a place with the family and
[52:26] my boys remember this they got a guy
[52:28] that stands in the middle of McDonald's
[52:30] and he just gets all upset because he
[52:32] didn't have his food with in under three
[52:35] minutes and then he wants to start and
[52:37] you know just ripping off swear words in
[52:38] the midst of a lunch hour you know maybe
[52:42] he took the lid to term fast food a
[52:44] little bit too literal but the reality
[52:46] of people changing people's under such a
[52:48] pressure in this hour they're in such a
[52:52] hurry we're used to be you know you
[52:55] would find where people would would
[52:56] would take time and rest
[53:01] they would they would take a time to be
[53:04] able to rest instead people are
[53:07] constantly in a hurry and you know I
[53:09] think of how you know even one brother
[53:12] when I was speaking with him here some
[53:15] months ago he works over in one of the
[53:18] Ford plants where he has to travel for
[53:20] 80 huh and I heard what he was saying I
[53:22] know the people jump for 80 it's 60
[53:25] miles per hour but you'd have to tell
[53:27] them that you'd have to almost stick it
[53:29] on the windshield they don't want to go
[53:31] 60 miles per hour and if you're only
[53:33] going 60 miles per hour they're ready to
[53:35] run you over and they wonder what's
[53:37] wrong with you people are changing we've
[53:41] seen that taking place we've seen the
[53:44] loss of of motherhood fatherhood and
[53:48] everything else people are not there
[53:50] covenant the Bible said they'd be truce
[53:52] beta breakers and lovers of themselves
[53:54] we see that but the word is identified
[53:58] these changes would come about the wired
[54:02] has identified it the Bible tells us in
[54:06] the book of Daniel when it speaks of
[54:08] that of the working of that spirit in
[54:11] the Antichrist we when the Antichrist
[54:13] working
[54:14] it speaks of even that fourth beast that
[54:16] fourth kingdom and it speaks of how that
[54:19] that little horn that one of the
[54:22] Antichrist he would seek to change times
[54:25] and laws and we see that taking place
[54:31] modifications and things and that's been
[54:33] going on so within this here's what I
[54:37] want to I focus to be on all of that is
[54:41] changing the world is changing because
[54:44] the world it is to pass away but there
[54:48] is one who remains constant there is one
[54:53] who has never changed for I am the Lord
[54:57] and I change not circumstances change
[55:03] but God don't change the same way that
[55:08] God acted in the first time when he ever
[55:11] saved a man he'll act the same
[55:15] the first time they ever healed a man
[55:17] when those same grounds are met God will
[55:20] heal him once again he's a God of his
[55:24] word he's committed to his word you see
[55:26] the very thing that we are are looking
[55:30] at here if there's one thing that you
[55:32] and I can have a confidence in and can
[55:34] have a faith in that's in the Word of
[55:37] God when we get when we get our
[55:40] confidence in anything outside of the
[55:43] Word of God then that's where we're
[55:45] disappointed and let me just say it like
[55:47] this sometimes we can get our confidence
[55:51] in our thoughts concerning the Word of
[55:54] God and then we're disappointed come on
[55:58] how the Bible said in the book you know
[56:01] in the book of Matthew blessed to see
[56:03] that's not offended in me John the
[56:05] Baptist was offended because things
[56:08] weren't happening the way he thought in
[56:10] on a hat yet what he spoke was exactly
[56:13] the word of the Lord but God came down
[56:16] notice of the Lord Jesus
[56:18] he see called the disciples he said come
[56:21] here for a minute he said I want you
[56:23] just to stay right here you know he
[56:24] could have told John he could have sent
[56:26] him back and he could have said don't
[56:27] tell John don't worry don't tell John
[56:29] it'll be all right that wasn't gonna
[56:31] help John John needed something that he
[56:35] could take a hold off so Jesus said just
[56:38] sit down here and I want you to witness
[56:40] what is taking place in this meeting
[56:44] where the sick are healed
[56:45] where the devil's are cast out where
[56:48] lives are being changed you know what it
[56:50] was
[56:50] he knew that John was anchored to that
[56:53] of the Living cloth and all John had to
[56:55] do is hear a report of the Living cloth
[56:58] and it would anchor John and remove the
[57:01] film from off of his eagle eyes it would
[57:04] give him strength in the midst of that
[57:07] time of prison there was a different
[57:10] situation but God knows how to speak to
[57:13] his children and let him know
[57:16] till the unchangeable God at steal the
[57:20] constant one it's to build our faith in
[57:26] the word of the Lord this is why the
[57:30] ministering of the word this is like God
[57:33] send his message in this linda's in in
[57:36] the end time it is the promise of his
[57:38] work to do on restore back Bible faith
[57:42] it never took us out of the Bible but to
[57:45] restore back to Bible faith there's
[57:49] things that we're you know churches they
[57:52] get together in their councils and they
[57:54] come together and going to decide what's
[57:57] what's right and what's wrong
[57:58] God never left it to a group of man to
[58:01] decide what's right and what's wrong is
[58:04] that right the council that ought to be
[58:07] called is the same Council that was
[58:08] called in acts two that the power of the
[58:11] Holy Ghost would come down and feel
[58:14] those lives because God never intended
[58:16] man to pack the gospel God talks the
[58:20] gospel in man that's the kind of council
[58:24] that needs to be called because out of
[58:26] those councils they make certain you
[58:28] know things for a room for now women can
[58:30] cut the hair and now women can wear this
[58:32] and now we can't allow homosexuals in
[58:35] the church who decided all that stuff
[58:37] it ain't God bringing the decision if
[58:39] God alters one word then everything else
[58:43] is out David said thy rod and thy staff
[58:49] they comfort me
[58:51] he's either the same or he isn't the
[58:54] same man learns better sure there's
[58:58] things in the medical books right now
[59:00] like really what killed George
[59:02] Washington there one the bullet what
[59:06] killed him because of the method of
[59:08] bleeding them out there's methods where
[59:12] they used to thank God they don't have
[59:13] that no more but you got an infection
[59:16] we're gonna heal the infection we're
[59:17] going to bleed you out but our medical
[59:20] science right now doctors would look
[59:23] back on that day no in the world they'd
[59:24] let somebody stand around for that right
[59:26] now
[59:27] man is always advancing but God don't
[59:31] ever change
[59:32] and God don't need the counsel of men
[59:35] there were there were 400 prophets that
[59:37] came up there with a lying spirit but
[59:41] God had one and Jehoshaphat said isn't
[59:44] there one it was a lying spirit that
[59:49] came upon them but Michael could stand
[59:51] there and what did Michael say though
[59:53] the situation's change and though you
[59:56] can quote to me a promise out of the
[59:58] word and say God gave us the land of
[1:00:01] ramoth-gilead but he was standing on the
[1:00:04] word and knew God had pronounced
[1:00:07] judgment on the house of Ahab for their
[1:00:10] disobedience what was he doing
[1:00:12] Michael was standing with the constant
[1:00:14] one the unchangeable God and with
[1:00:18] Zedekiah said which way with the Spirit
[1:00:21] of God when he went out of me and Micah
[1:00:24] said you'll find out when you return
[1:00:26] back and are in your inner presence the
[1:00:31] Word of God is shallow that wasn't that
[1:00:34] wasn't Elijah's thinking but it was the
[1:00:36] word of the Lord spoken through the
[1:00:39] mouthpiece his servant Elijah in that
[1:00:42] hour by what the constant one I never
[1:00:53] forget we were out on vacation and we
[1:00:59] were in a certain place that was um
[1:01:03] this was some time back we were in a
[1:01:05] certain place that was kind of close to
[1:01:07] where my aunt Barbara and uncle Glen
[1:01:10] where they live and we saw a person in
[1:01:14] the restaurant there and you know it
[1:01:17] would have been a place that they would
[1:01:18] have been they matter of fact they went
[1:01:19] there to that place multiple times over
[1:01:21] there in Pennsylvania and how we were
[1:01:23] looking at it and not goodness we
[1:01:25] thought through we got to look the hair
[1:01:27] everything from behind I mean it looked
[1:01:30] exactly like man Barbara so you know
[1:01:32] there's a part of it we got a little
[1:01:34] excited we thought maybe they're here we
[1:01:36] just don't know about it so we got up
[1:01:39] there and five
[1:01:40] you know we're moving around and looking
[1:01:41] at things in the store not that we're
[1:01:43] interested in buying we're trying to
[1:01:45] find out is that her because you just
[1:01:48] don't want adrenals sneak up behind
[1:01:49] somebody and say hey and Barbara and
[1:01:51] they turn around and think one of the
[1:01:53] world's just crazy person doing here
[1:01:55] you wonder see who it was before you
[1:01:58] called their name and maybe just tell
[1:02:01] you something God will always reveal
[1:02:04] himself to be the same that's the only
[1:02:08] thing that you and I can have in life
[1:02:11] that is tangible we don't need more
[1:02:13] literature we need the presence of the
[1:02:16] Living God because it is that which
[1:02:20] Jacob when he was in his wonderings
[1:02:22] Jacob was wondering what's going on
[1:02:25] what's taking place but drawn met him
[1:02:28] there
[1:02:28] Jacob had something he could put his
[1:02:31] hand on and when he put his hand on it
[1:02:33] that same God changed him let me tell
[1:02:38] you something
[1:02:38] he changed him and it can never ever
[1:02:40] ever ever go back to being the same
[1:02:43] Jacob again that's the kind of change
[1:02:45] God makes God brings you and I into his
[1:02:49] constancy it's a constant life abiding
[1:02:53] in the Holies of Holies it's something
[1:02:56] that you can take ahold of don't turn
[1:02:58] him loose remember remember Jacob
[1:03:01] it wasn't God hold on it Jacob you know
[1:03:03] and God wrestle and Jacob that's not how
[1:03:06] God works God don't wrestle none of his
[1:03:08] children down God don't make none of his
[1:03:11] children serve Him because he puts him
[1:03:13] in a headlock and and puts him in a
[1:03:15] place of why cement or I submit no God
[1:03:19] moves by His divine love to wear
[1:03:22] something the goodness of God wouldn't
[1:03:25] move in our live into a place and say
[1:03:27] Lord I know that thou art the same and
[1:03:31] true and living
[1:03:32] and all I want you to change me it
[1:03:35] becomes that desperation that moves in
[1:03:39] the heart of an individual to know that
[1:03:42] there is one that is present that I have
[1:03:44] my hands all can deliver me and bring a
[1:03:48] change in my life is to build faith in
[1:03:55] the word I don't have nothing against
[1:04:04] Christian bookstores and all these other
[1:04:06] things and so forth but I'll tell your
[1:04:07] friends I think a lot of it has its we
[1:04:09] see people have substituted a real
[1:04:13] genuine acts to experience with theology
[1:04:17] a man in order for the same reality to
[1:04:23] be reproduced it takes the same Living
[1:04:26] God when one of his words has changed he
[1:04:29] no longer remains the same that's why
[1:04:34] people go on preaching experience and
[1:04:40] listen to me they go on that's why they
[1:04:42] preach it they preach experiences for
[1:04:46] the new birth instead of finding that
[1:04:49] the experience must be founded in the
[1:04:51] word and it is not something of changing
[1:04:54] from year to year and month to month
[1:04:56] when God brings a change in a man it's
[1:04:59] constant that man might have certain
[1:05:03] feelings he goes through different tests
[1:05:06] and trials but there's a constant God
[1:05:08] that lives in him and he is living and
[1:05:10] abiding in the presence of the same one
[1:05:13] who brought Aaron's rod into blossoming
[1:05:16] fruit producing and bearing to mature
[1:05:20] maturity you see this is where is to
[1:05:24] instill faith in the Word of God this is
[1:05:27] why this is why the presence of God we
[1:05:30] just don't need word we need the
[1:05:32] presence of the Living God and they just
[1:05:35] tell you son the Holy Ghost is the Word
[1:05:37] of God because the Word of God is a
[1:05:40] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:05:42] the heart
[1:05:43] it has with
[1:05:44] the power to bring change whatever
[1:05:48] decision God if God met a man first and
[1:05:51] the first thing that God asked is have
[1:05:53] faith the Bible is very clear we must
[1:05:57] have faith is that right is to have
[1:06:01] faith in God let me just say to you like
[1:06:03] this
[1:06:03] you used to have faith in God and God is
[1:06:07] no greater than his word he's no more
[1:06:10] perfect than his word because God and
[1:06:13] his word is the self same thing I love
[1:06:16] this scripture it's a portion in the
[1:06:19] world that it's just been on meditation
[1:06:22] on my heart for months and just really
[1:06:24] moving right down even in these times
[1:06:27] it's a scripture that even will it moves
[1:06:30] over into the coming of the Lord and
[1:06:33] even to that a millennium and so forth
[1:06:35] but this scripture is something I really
[1:06:38] enjoy in Psalms 138 verse 1 I will
[1:06:42] praise thee with my whole heart before
[1:06:44] the gods ye are gods
[1:06:47] come on the scripture said Ye are gods
[1:06:49] right and God is the god of the universe
[1:06:53] Adam was made to be lowercase G God of
[1:06:57] the earth is that right the Bible said
[1:07:00] he had put all things in Dominion under
[1:07:02] his family is that right this is why the
[1:07:07] earth is rude groaning and longing for
[1:07:09] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:07:12] because there is that reality that
[1:07:14] yearns within the earth just as it did
[1:07:16] in Joel just as it did in US and even
[1:07:19] now we crawl on within ourselves to be
[1:07:22] delivered there is a desire in the earth
[1:07:24] for the earth to come back under the
[1:07:26] Dominion of the sons and daughters of
[1:07:28] God this is why the earthquakes in
[1:07:30] diverse places this is why the nervous
[1:07:33] frustrations of the earth and all these
[1:07:36] things laugh because there is a kingdom
[1:07:39] that is being ushered in hallelujah
[1:07:46] before the gods well I sing praise unto
[1:07:49] thee I will worship toward that holy
[1:07:52] temple and praise thy name for the
[1:07:56] loving-kindness
[1:07:57] without truth I love this for thou has
[1:08:00] magnified thy word above thy name now we
[1:08:06] realize that a man's name you know
[1:08:09] somebody can have a real bad name
[1:08:11] because of their character their
[1:08:14] character becomes that of their actions
[1:08:16] what they do or what they don't do like
[1:08:19] somebody can say tell them if you're
[1:08:22] going to start Church at 11:00 telling
[1:08:23] church starts at 10:00 so they're here
[1:08:25] on time you know say I'm saying you can
[1:08:27] feel you can see different things right
[1:08:30] but now when we look at this here here
[1:08:34] that as David as a witness Dallas
[1:08:36] magnified that word above my name see
[1:08:38] God remember his name is revealed his
[1:08:42] name is his person is his character is
[1:08:45] who he is
[1:08:46] it is revealed in his word he reveals it
[1:08:52] he's not trying to make a reputation for
[1:08:54] himself and go off out here and give a
[1:08:57] bunch of loose words you know God's not
[1:08:59] a politician he don't make a lot of
[1:09:02] empty promises and then say oh hell you
[1:09:05] know I got under heat and Method and
[1:09:07] I've got to try to keep this together
[1:09:09] know every promise that God made he
[1:09:13] fulfills it he has magnified his word
[1:09:18] above his name because with his word
[1:09:21] being fulfilled that's what makes his
[1:09:23] name great amen and that's why the Bible
[1:09:28] could even say in the Book of
[1:09:30] Revelations of 19 when he comes riding
[1:09:32] back with the armies of heaven when
[1:09:34] we're get rid from the West wedding
[1:09:36] supper and he comes down to make that of
[1:09:39] war there in that valley of Megiddo
[1:09:41] there in Armageddon remember the Bible
[1:09:44] said that he had a name written on his
[1:09:46] vesture and in the Bible said his name
[1:09:49] is called the Word of God his name isn't
[1:09:51] the word of God but it's called the Word
[1:09:53] of God when his name is made manifest
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:09:57] forever
[1:09:58] that is the way
[1:10:01] amen that's magnified by word above thy
[1:10:04] name man is only as good as his word is
[1:10:10] that right so God is unchangeable he
[1:10:16] meets man on the same grounds that he
[1:10:18] did before human them same grounds when
[1:10:21] man gets almost same grounds God will
[1:10:23] manifest himself to be the same Amen so
[1:10:27] the only way to declare it is God is
[1:10:29] unchangeable I think of it you know my
[1:10:32] heart would break what good would it do
[1:10:35] for a person to go to seminary or any
[1:10:38] place like this and read about the Word
[1:10:41] of God
[1:10:41] no the Word of God and then to have
[1:10:44] somebody standing in the pulpit or to
[1:10:46] have those people there and say well God
[1:10:49] no longer does that or God used to do
[1:10:51] this back there that that is absolutely
[1:10:54] contrary to the word because what God
[1:10:57] did before he still the same God the
[1:11:00] smarted
[1:11:01] man has changed but God has never
[1:11:04] changed and that's why we're thankful
[1:11:08] because if he changed then we would be
[1:11:11] consumed but remember God can't change
[1:11:14] and he is the word for I am the Lord and
[1:11:17] I changed that therefore these sons of
[1:11:20] Jacob you are not consumed God is
[1:11:23] focused upon his word God rest in his
[1:11:28] word as a matter of fact Milliband would
[1:11:29] say like this God in the beginning spoke
[1:11:31] his word and step back and believe it
[1:11:36] remember it's the same God inside of you
[1:11:38] and me the Spirit of Truth it's the same
[1:11:41] the same Jesus is that right
[1:11:43] because when Paul met him on the road to
[1:11:46] Damascus remember he saw that pillar
[1:11:49] fire he knew this was God visiting his
[1:11:51] people and when God visits his people
[1:11:53] like that it's to lead them out of
[1:11:55] unbelief into faith and he asked him who
[1:11:58] are you lord and what did he do he
[1:12:01] revealed to him I am Jesus whom my
[1:12:03] persecutors the corporal body had
[1:12:06] already ascended on the throne
[1:12:08] holy ghost the same God that lived in
[1:12:11] that body that he created now that same
[1:12:13] life of God that same Holy Ghost if that
[1:12:16] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:12:19] dead dwell in you he was dwelling in his
[1:12:21] church in that hour Amen though the
[1:12:26] corporal body Jesus was on the throne
[1:12:28] that same one on the inside that had
[1:12:31] come down and took upon a human name for
[1:12:34] redemption he was standing there
[1:12:37] he was veiled in the midst of his church
[1:12:39] and that's why the scripture text you
[1:12:41] and I know in the Book of Revelations
[1:12:43] when John sees him revealed he is
[1:12:46] revealed as Alpha and Omega I am the
[1:12:49] beginning and the end though men would
[1:12:52] want to alter me but I am still the same
[1:12:55] the way that I started my church I will
[1:12:59] finish it the same God that came down on
[1:13:03] the day of Pentecost is the same God
[1:13:06] right here with you and I walking in the
[1:13:14] midst of the candlesticks David declares
[1:13:17] in Psalms Paul picks it up in Hebrews
[1:13:19] he's declaring the victory in the midst
[1:13:23] of his brethren I will sing in the midst
[1:13:26] of my brethren this is why the scripture
[1:13:32] building faith building faith in the
[1:13:35] Word of God this is why it says without
[1:13:38] faith it's impossible to please him he
[1:13:44] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:13:49] is I'm a firm believer nobody nobody
[1:13:55] should come to an altar because their
[1:13:58] buddy comes to an altar because their
[1:14:00] friend comes to an altar come on I've
[1:14:02] seen that they come under pressure and
[1:14:05] under this and I want to do it because
[1:14:06] of this and do it because of that
[1:14:08] there's certain parts or we look at
[1:14:10] things and say well that would be good
[1:14:12] to emulate but it takes more than you
[1:14:14] emulating somebody else it takes where
[1:14:17] you become identified or introduced with
[1:14:19] that that same God he
[1:14:22] living God you first got to know that
[1:14:25] he's a living God let me just say it
[1:14:26] whether you're here or whether you're
[1:14:28] out there on the internet if you don't
[1:14:29] know him to be a living God one that you
[1:14:31] can put your hands on tangible all you
[1:14:33] have to do is ask God Lord
[1:14:35] make yourself known as the Living God
[1:14:38] the same God that part of the Red Sea
[1:14:41] the same God that turned the water into
[1:14:44] wine make yourself known the same God
[1:14:47] who changed Jacob and delivered from
[1:14:50] within him the Prince that was hidden
[1:14:53] your first is to ask God reveal yourself
[1:14:59] and once he does that then here's the
[1:15:03] next part and that he's a reward it
[1:15:07] ain't just good enough to know well I
[1:15:08] know this is truth I know the Living God
[1:15:10] is among us I know God is around us I
[1:15:13] know our brother Samuel administering I
[1:15:15] know this message is the truth all of
[1:15:17] those are wonderful those are wonderful
[1:15:19] things but remember it's for you to take
[1:15:21] ahold of and let the same god of this
[1:15:24] message that he delivered him change you
[1:15:28] you must believe he is a rewarder one
[1:15:33] who releases the spoil one who releases
[1:15:38] there of the riches of his glory the
[1:15:41] riches of his spirit the riches of his
[1:15:44] life his nature you must believe that he
[1:15:47] is a rewarder he's not an Indian giver
[1:15:51] it's church teaching that is cost people
[1:15:54] confusion that's what I would hope you
[1:15:58] feel it oh my if you feel it or if you
[1:16:01] spoke in tongues or if you did this and
[1:16:03] you're fine with people in and out and
[1:16:05] up and down and here they are living
[1:16:07] back out in the war you want to know why
[1:16:09] it wasn't that there was an anointing
[1:16:11] didn't come on their life there was a
[1:16:13] genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost that
[1:16:15] came on their life but remember the
[1:16:17] Bible said the rain it falls on the just
[1:16:19] and unjust the Sun that shines on the
[1:16:22] weep it shines on the weed it's not
[1:16:25] saying you're
[1:16:26] but it's Sam left the rain and let the
[1:16:29] light go into the depths of your soul
[1:16:32] then it is no longer you then liver but
[1:16:35] its Christ liveth in you it becomes then
[1:16:38] a constant by the unchanging God living
[1:16:43] out his word
[1:16:48] the reality is the accountability comes
[1:16:52] I just say a personal here I'm just
[1:16:58] speaking to the church that God has
[1:17:01] called me to pastor
[1:17:02] there's not one without an excuse in
[1:17:05] this assembly that God don't move among
[1:17:07] us there's not one that could sit here
[1:17:10] in this assembly and say well I ain't
[1:17:12] felt the premise of God i han't felt the
[1:17:14] power of God
[1:17:15] I ain't seen the power of God there's
[1:17:17] not one can say that then wrong what we
[1:17:24] what do we do with that it's to take a
[1:17:25] hold of that Living God because he's the
[1:17:30] one that comes he's the one that brings
[1:17:32] his word to pass you see when it's left
[1:17:36] up to the imagination of man man wants
[1:17:39] to fabricate it like this this is why we
[1:17:41] have that we have the situation's of
[1:17:43] where that we have that people look at
[1:17:45] and say well you know if I just confess
[1:17:47] the Lord I'm saved there's a beginning
[1:17:49] but you got to keep going
[1:17:51] amen there's the promise the promise is
[1:17:54] of redemption and Men we think God for
[1:17:58] salvation but it's gotta go deeper he's
[1:18:00] a sanctified he cleans out all dirty
[1:18:03] filthy habits he sanctifies that life he
[1:18:07] moves in to bring a cleansing and a
[1:18:08] sanctified by his power that then he
[1:18:11] himself comes down on the inside and let
[1:18:15] me just say it like this when God gets
[1:18:17] ahold of the life remember God don't as
[1:18:21] I said before God don't drag that in
[1:18:22] life and say yeah I'm gonna put you in a
[1:18:24] headlock neither does God put people in
[1:18:26] a headlock and say alright I'm gonna
[1:18:28] clean you up
[1:18:29] I'm gonna sanctify you God don't work
[1:18:31] that way what has to happen is is
[1:18:34] remember a further work of the grace of
[1:18:36] God it has
[1:18:37] to come a determination on your heart
[1:18:39] that Lord I want nothing in me that is
[1:18:42] unlike you and that never stops
[1:18:45] Lord I want nothing that would hinder
[1:18:47] you from coming in me if I've got
[1:18:50] desires in my life that are not right
[1:18:52] Lord I want to just give myself to you a
[1:18:55] determination of the Spirit of God
[1:18:58] moving upon that life Lord lead me to
[1:19:02] deeper depths in you sometimes God God
[1:19:13] the hill he'll do things every time God
[1:19:15] fulfills his word it's every time he
[1:19:17] fulfills it it is never how man has
[1:19:21] figured it out see God don't want you to
[1:19:26] view it God God's not in it for you and
[1:19:27] how to figure it out that's not what
[1:19:31] remember where God's confidence is is
[1:19:34] when he makes himself known among his
[1:19:37] children his children will recognize him
[1:19:47] well I feel good
[1:19:53] Gideon's standing there that day and
[1:19:56] remember in the book of Gideon in the
[1:19:59] book of Judges sorry a prophet had come
[1:20:02] first thing God sent a prophet why
[1:20:05] people get away from the word they get
[1:20:10] away from it and they get drifting out
[1:20:12] here what does a prophet sent forth to
[1:20:13] call you back into the word I'm talking
[1:20:16] about a true ordained prophet it's to
[1:20:18] call you back into the word of Almighty
[1:20:19] God
[1:20:20] it delivers from the counsels of men and
[1:20:24] men's ideas which hold no power that
[1:20:29] prophet came and let him know where you
[1:20:32] drifted from you're living a life of
[1:20:34] defeat Midianites keep coming in as
[1:20:38] grasshoppers and lighting you out and
[1:20:41] he's cold what do you know he's calling
[1:20:43] them back - he didn't come there - you
[1:20:45] know the bathe a.m. and say oh this is a
[1:20:47] terrible situation and oh in this
[1:20:50] horrible and you know what we just need
[1:20:52] to start a separate group here in the
[1:20:54] church in Israel we need to start a
[1:20:56] group among the harvesters and you know
[1:20:59] let's all just hold hands and sing
[1:21:00] Kumbaya and weep because we're defeated
[1:21:03] knows that the reason Israel was
[1:21:07] defeated there is because they live out
[1:21:10] on the word hey man when they let when
[1:21:15] their word is raised back up in power
[1:21:20] how do you then Satan don't stand a
[1:21:24] chance hey man he's still Jehovah Nissi
[1:21:28] a man when and when Moses was on the
[1:21:31] mountain and Joshua was down there
[1:21:33] fighting the battle Aaron and her were
[1:21:36] up in there and what were they to do
[1:21:37] hold up the hands of Moses and when his
[1:21:42] hands they'd seen the hands growing
[1:21:43] weary amen they put that put two rocks
[1:21:46] right there he's the same in the Old
[1:21:49] Testament as in the new he is the breach
[1:21:52] that breaches him together he ties it
[1:21:54] all together that is Jesus Christ
[1:21:56] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:21:58] power the same car that was there is the
[1:22:01] same power and called that is here now
[1:22:04] this hands are steel exalted and the
[1:22:08] revelation that has come to you and I in
[1:22:10] this Hauer this one with his hands up he
[1:22:13] swears by him that liveth forever and
[1:22:17] ever
[1:22:17] what is it the effect of calais what
[1:22:20] cavalry was initiating Redemption this
[1:22:24] is the gathering together I'm talking
[1:22:28] about the constant one here who was
[1:22:33] Gideon the Prophet came and went but the
[1:22:39] one that's sinning didn't leave the one
[1:22:45] that gave the prophet his message he
[1:22:48] came in the message and he came right up
[1:22:52] to her Gideon was the message was
[1:22:55] broadcast to all but it's going to find
[1:22:58] who it's intended for you see that
[1:23:00] message is going to build courage it's
[1:23:02] call it it's gonna answer the longing
[1:23:04] that's in the heart of the individual
[1:23:06] for the constant one where is that same
[1:23:09] God
[1:23:10] Gideon asks a question here is he's
[1:23:12] talking notice he doesn't perceive him
[1:23:14] as anybody anything oh I wonder who this
[1:23:17] is this wasn't Christian bookstore
[1:23:19] theology he didn't have he didn't have
[1:23:21] you know a certain aura or a certain
[1:23:24] light about him it wasn't that at all
[1:23:26] but this here was the angel of the Lord
[1:23:29] was present here he loves taken upon a
[1:23:32] veil and a form that Gideon would know
[1:23:34] as a man he wasn't startled but the man
[1:23:38] began to speak to him and speak to the
[1:23:40] depths that lay within his life he was
[1:23:42] uncovering to Gideon a mystery that laid
[1:23:45] within him that Gideon himself could not
[1:23:48] see but you see what the word comes to
[1:23:50] do it comes to inspire courage and the
[1:23:53] only way that courage comes from about
[1:23:55] in our life is for God to reveal himself
[1:23:57] as the unchangeable God
[1:24:00] and Gideon said if God be with Hassan
[1:24:02] then where P all the miracles we've
[1:24:05] heard what he did when he part of the
[1:24:07] let's see how he opened the Jordan why
[1:24:09] is that same God for this Hauer where's
[1:24:15] the constant one where's the
[1:24:19] unchangeable God promise after promise
[1:24:23] I'm just going to come down here and
[1:24:25] close promise after promise in the Word
[1:24:29] of God such rich and precious promises
[1:24:32] of how God he gave witnesses all the way
[1:24:35] down of the of the keeping of his word
[1:24:37] manifesting his word and even how God it
[1:24:40] would be expressed in the word of the
[1:24:42] Lord how David would express it the
[1:24:44] testimony of the Lord is sure
[1:24:48] Amen Solomon would write every word of
[1:24:50] God is pure I say it would ride on I was
[1:24:54] a a48 the grass wither at the flower of
[1:24:56] fate is but the word of our God shall
[1:24:57] stand forever
[1:25:03] Titus 1:7 speaks of that hope of eternal
[1:25:07] life where Paul was resting which God
[1:25:09] that cannot lie
[1:25:11] notice it notice where he's drawing the
[1:25:13] attention for God which cannot lie the
[1:25:18] Bible said that every man's word be a
[1:25:20] lot but let God's Word be true let me
[1:25:25] tell you God backs up his word Amen that
[1:25:30] God cannot lie
[1:25:31] he promised before the world began look
[1:25:34] at look at look look look this word is
[1:25:36] sure before there was Adam Stardust or
[1:25:40] molecule before there was even the
[1:25:42] dividing of the atoms the multiplying of
[1:25:45] the molecules before there was anything
[1:25:49] there was Elohim there was God existing
[1:25:54] with his thoughts in the beginning was
[1:25:59] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:26:01] the Word was God
[1:26:04] the constant
[1:26:08] the earth was being changed the earth
[1:26:11] was coming into manifestation but as the
[1:26:17] earth would come into a manifestation we
[1:26:20] see where the enemy would come in and
[1:26:23] bring an encroachment in Eden he would
[1:26:28] lead notice God gave His Word in Eden
[1:26:33] God can't change his word he said the
[1:26:36] day you eat thereof the day you die God
[1:26:40] had to stand by his word but God made a
[1:26:45] promise he said to that of the woman I
[1:26:49] will give you a seed you see in order to
[1:26:53] bring this back
[1:26:55] it's got to be God giving a seed because
[1:27:01] in order to bring this back remember
[1:27:02] Jesus said I am coming my father's name
[1:27:05] right he had magnified his word above
[1:27:08] his name remember here it is in order to
[1:27:11] release that light because remember what
[1:27:13] does the Sun do a Sun is an error he's
[1:27:16] one that carries on the lineage and the
[1:27:18] name of the Father and Jesus has come in
[1:27:23] the volume of the book what was it an
[1:27:25] air it had to be unto us a son is given
[1:27:29] why it had to be that of a son
[1:27:31] it had to be were God would create a
[1:27:34] body a tabernacle that he could step
[1:27:37] down and pay the price of redemption and
[1:27:40] now through that clear the lien and the
[1:27:42] debt that was against you and I that
[1:27:45] that same life might be released back to
[1:27:47] you and I as sons and daughters we were
[1:27:50] under the darkness and the blackness of
[1:27:52] sin it was in Genesis 1 but God said let
[1:27:57] there be light
[1:27:58] and his light is his well made manifest
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:07] hallelujah
[1:28:09] hey man that same life now that's why
[1:28:13] the family of God is called by one
[1:28:17] the name of Jesus Christ hey man it has
[1:28:21] released the family name to whom it has
[1:28:25] released the family name to those who
[1:28:27] have the genes of his loins
[1:28:30] remember he that is L must come from the
[1:28:33] loins come on now Abraham said Eleazar
[1:28:37] shake he could be my hair tossing me but
[1:28:40] he that comes from your loins
[1:28:42] what was God declaring my ears my
[1:28:45] children they will come from my loins
[1:28:48] they will come from the loins of my mind
[1:28:51] of my word blessed be the name of the
[1:29:03] Lord
[1:29:05] think of it here's a scripture in the
[1:29:12] Book of Revelations to our church age an
[1:29:18] age where the Holy Spirit dealing with
[1:29:22] the church the church they stand here he
[1:29:26] stands and knocks at the door but he's
[1:29:31] been put out but yet they're still
[1:29:33] preaching this shows that the Lord is
[1:29:37] not the letter the word is the person to
[1:29:43] have the letters not enough that's why
[1:29:45] there has to be programs and people we
[1:29:48] have to get together and make promises
[1:29:50] man can keep a promise
[1:29:53] but God keeps every promise he's a
[1:29:58] constant one unto the angel of the
[1:30:05] church of the lady of seein's write
[1:30:08] these things saith the Amen which is the
[1:30:12] so be it the faithful and true witness
[1:30:16] the beginning of the creation of God he
[1:30:21] is the author this is why the Scriptures
[1:30:27] I'm closing I'm just going to close here
[1:30:30] heaven and earth jesus said will pass
[1:30:34] away but my words shall not pass away
[1:30:40] let me just say it like this as work as
[1:30:45] I'm closing just skipping some different
[1:30:48] things here to have a constant is to
[1:30:54] have an absolute it's to have something
[1:31:00] that doesn't change it's an absolute is
[1:31:05] something that you can always come back
[1:31:07] to and base everything else off of help
[1:31:12] me preach out there in your homes that's
[1:31:16] why you've got to meet God on the sacred
[1:31:18] sands of grace you got to have an
[1:31:20] absolute that you know you've met God
[1:31:22] then no matter what comes your way
[1:31:24] sometimes you can feel like you're not
[1:31:26] saying but you've got an absolute to
[1:31:28] come back to you've got a constant you
[1:31:31] can come back to just say I know that I
[1:31:34] met God and the love of the world is
[1:31:37] past for my life I no longer love the
[1:31:40] world but God has become everything to
[1:31:43] me you've got an absolute you've got a
[1:31:46] constant that you can check everything
[1:31:48] by let me just put it clear like this
[1:31:51] you've got a thinking man's filter it is
[1:31:54] a constant and in that filter it will
[1:31:57] not allow the world it's constant it's
[1:32:01] an absolute David would call the
[1:32:05] constant in his life the absolute in his
[1:32:08] life he would say he's my rock when he
[1:32:12] said I get overwhelmed lead me to the
[1:32:14] rock that's hotter than hot he nearly
[1:32:17] had a constant pace lead me there it's
[1:32:22] higher than I these problems and I'm
[1:32:25] seeing what's going on around me there's
[1:32:26] a rock that's higher than I need me
[1:32:29] there Lord that's why David would say in
[1:32:34] psalm 62:5 my soul wait thou only on God
[1:32:37] for my expectation is from him he only
[1:32:40] he only this is from Shalom
[1:32:44] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:32:50] is my defense i shall not be moved in
[1:32:58] god is my salvation and my glory the
[1:33:04] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[1:33:09] god
[1:33:11] david knew him as the constant one the
[1:33:15] unchangeable god he didn't matter the
[1:33:18] obstacle
[1:33:21] sometimes the obstacles look different
[1:33:24] lines don't look like bears bears don't
[1:33:27] look like Giants hello somebody tests
[1:33:30] and trials that come our way they had
[1:33:33] come in many different ways and
[1:33:34] appearances as I write things that we
[1:33:38] are faced with all of that is things
[1:33:41] that change around us but like David
[1:33:44] David looked at Goliath and he knew this
[1:33:47] is different but the same God is with me
[1:33:51] David knew he's the same God the
[1:33:53] constant one the unchangeable God but
[1:33:57] just saying like this he doesn't matter
[1:34:00] what comes along and what goes we're in
[1:34:04] the midst of a time right now that of
[1:34:06] the changing all this as a whole around
[1:34:09] us we see all that change and look
[1:34:10] people are in their homes and all these
[1:34:13] things we see things that were that's
[1:34:14] had to be change they've asked us to
[1:34:17] comply we see a lot of things that's
[1:34:18] changed there's some right now that I'm
[1:34:20] speaking to a part of this assembly has
[1:34:22] went through some major surgeries
[1:34:24] there's been some major things that have
[1:34:26] happened here among us within the
[1:34:29] assembly things that we've been through
[1:34:31] and God has brought us through things
[1:34:33] have changed I've watched how things
[1:34:36] have changed over the years but let me
[1:34:38] just say this to you one that remains
[1:34:40] constant is that God is still God
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:34:46] he doesn't change sometimes we feel we
[1:34:52] look at the situation and say I never
[1:34:55] faced nothing like this before but the
[1:34:58] same God that was with you in the
[1:35:00] previous trial is the same God with you
[1:35:03] in this trial the same God that was with
[1:35:06] you there is the same God that's with
[1:35:07] you here because he said I'll never
[1:35:10] leave you nor forsake you and when we
[1:35:13] can entertain that thought it relieves
[1:35:16] us from the covetous spirit for I can
[1:35:20] boldly say the Lord is my helper
[1:35:31] David believed that God was the constant
[1:35:35] one David would even make the request in
[1:35:39] Psalm 63 verse 1 o God thou art my god
[1:35:45] early will I seek thee my soul thirsty
[1:35:48] for be my flesh longer for thee in a dry
[1:35:52] and thirsty land where no water is to
[1:35:56] see that power and that glory so as I
[1:36:00] have seen it in the sanctuary you know
[1:36:02] what David was calling here he knew what
[1:36:05] I've seen you to be in the sanctuary
[1:36:07] your power and your glory I may not be
[1:36:11] in the sanctuary right now I'm in a
[1:36:13] place of a dry and thirsty land
[1:36:16] it's like darkness is all around below
[1:36:20] along in to see your power and your
[1:36:22] glory right here in this time because
[1:36:27] you're the constant one the unchangeable
[1:36:30] God let me just say it like this
[1:36:53] if you don't know him to be the constant
[1:36:56] one inside of you then let him dear
[1:37:08] friends
[1:37:09] life something you know what if people
[1:37:11] get tired people get tired well I've
[1:37:13] tried this and I'm up and I'm down and
[1:37:15] I'm up listen when that's mentioned
[1:37:17] about being up and down it's not putting
[1:37:19] anybody down it's trying to let you know
[1:37:22] there's a place you can come to where it
[1:37:24] becomes constant in your life oh you go
[1:37:27] through tests and tryout sure is the
[1:37:29] world you'll go through you go through
[1:37:31] time but there was different is you've
[1:37:32] got a friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:37:34] brother you got one who is abiding with
[1:37:38] you constantly you got wonder whether
[1:37:41] you fill him enough you got to promise
[1:37:43] no I am with you always has he told
[1:37:46] Joshua whithersoever thou goest and
[1:37:48] there with you
[1:37:49] I'm the constant one not Jericho is
[1:37:54] different from me but I'm the same God
[1:37:56] no matter if it's caracal no matter if
[1:37:58] it's a as he told them in the Bible when
[1:38:01] there was an attack made on his
[1:38:03] character that he's only the god of the
[1:38:05] hills he said I will declare that I'm
[1:38:08] not just the God of the hills but I'm
[1:38:10] the God of the valleys he's God whether
[1:38:13] you're on a mountain whether you're in a
[1:38:15] valley he's the same God he's the
[1:38:17] constant one the unchangeable God he's
[1:38:20] the same yesterday today and forever let
[1:38:23] me tell you something this is where that
[1:38:24] same God he comes into the heart of an
[1:38:27] individual and he brings a constancy in
[1:38:30] that life by a constant love affair
[1:38:32] where the love of God is shed abroad in
[1:38:34] your hearts it becomes a stability oh
[1:38:37] you're not floating but you have an
[1:38:39] anchor that enters within the veil and
[1:38:41] you are held constant in him and I say
[1:38:47] to you this morning if you don't have
[1:38:49] that constant one dwelling in the midst
[1:38:53] of the chamber of your heart that can
[1:38:57] bring stability and comfort to your life
[1:39:02] that only he don't just get you through
[1:39:06] covet night Tina

[1:39:14] through all the way through every test
[1:39:18] and every trial through every trap and
[1:39:20] every snare through everything the devil
[1:39:23] can throw at you he is are not constant
[1:39:25] one and there's a prevailing power that
[1:39:28] moves in your life to where when you get
[1:39:30] caught up in a little bit of weeds you
[1:39:32] got a power it's not just this humanity
[1:39:35] you got a power behind this humanity
[1:39:37] lots of power
[1:39:39] that is on a boat if a boat gets caught
[1:39:41] this power for it to overcome
[1:39:45] he's the constant one you might be
[1:39:52] sitting at home and wonder but Sammy
[1:39:55] you're still sweating as though you got
[1:39:56] a whole whole group of people there let
[1:39:58] me just say something I miss every one
[1:40:00] of you I miss you all not being here and

[1:40:47] because otherwise there is a there is a
[1:40:51] chasm there is a breach between us and
[1:40:54] this we need one who's able to put his
[1:40:57] hands on us put on that of the word and
[1:41:02] tie the two together you see this is the
[1:41:05] mystery it takes the releasing of his

[1:42:19] the coat because I can't get it in and
[1:42:22] right now you might be in the midst of a
[1:42:24] valley there might be things I know as
[1:42:27] many of our sisters here you are you've
[1:42:30] got the children and the things that you
[1:42:33] know some things has changed in your
[1:42:34] home homeschooling and things like that
[1:42:36] and not really exactly homeschooling but
[1:42:41] I mean there's things where there's been
[1:42:43] some modifications from things that you
[1:42:45] had to to to amend some of you on your
[1:42:47] schedule some of you in different in
[1:42:49] different ways in different settings let
[1:42:51] me just say this to you remember this
[1:42:54] he's the same God you're in the things
[1:42:57] around us there's changes but he's the
[1:42:59] constant one if there's one thing that
[1:43:01] we need that assurance of and we need to
[1:43:04] rest our hearts in right now it's in the
[1:43:06] constant one because all around us it's
[1:43:09] changing everything around this is
[1:43:11] shifting sands here we have no
[1:43:13] continuing City it's all shifting and
[1:43:17] changing but just to remember
[1:43:20] and to look at it like this even in the
[1:43:23] midst of times by the salmon these are
[1:43:26] times when you get over a limit I sure
[1:43:27] do
[1:43:28] there's times when I get overwhelmed
[1:43:29] with things because the things brothers
[1:43:32] and sisters that we're dealing with
[1:43:33] things and many times that I'm doing
[1:43:35] things I can put my hands on I've got to
[1:43:37] trust God to work it out the same way
[1:43:39] you have to trust God for our families
[1:43:41] and everything else
[1:43:41] we've got to trust God to work it out
[1:43:43] but to real the real reality within it
[1:43:47] is let's just ask God say Lord I want to
[1:43:51] draw closer to you and Lord that you
[1:43:54] would direct me through this moment
[1:43:56] because there's things that God can make
[1:43:58] known to you there's things that maybe
[1:44:00] there's some things that can come about
[1:44:02] in your life that you look at and say
[1:44:04] you know what I never thought of doing
[1:44:05] this before but you know what I realize
[1:44:07] I can do it remember God is not the
[1:44:11] author of confusion the world is running
[1:44:14] around in confusion but they're seeking
[1:44:16] this is an hour what people are seeking
[1:44:18] for leadership but you know if the
[1:44:22] leadership there wanting leadership that
[1:44:24] will calm their fears and I'm telling
[1:44:26] you everybody needs leadership we all
[1:44:29] need real godly leadership thank God
[1:44:33] that he provides leadership in the midst
[1:44:35] of a time where it's in a situation of
[1:44:38] the world of crisis but God lets us know
[1:44:41] I'm the constant one I haven't changed
[1:44:45] your life your schedules they might have
[1:44:48] changed a little bit you might be used
[1:44:50] to going up and picking a hamburger up
[1:44:52] here at a certain time and going
[1:44:53] wherever you want but that has changed
[1:44:54] but remember I've not changed and we can
[1:44:57] bring our thoughts back into that place
[1:44:59] then God can mold and shape and bring
[1:45:05] forth from our lives in this time what
[1:45:09] he's intended to bring forth I think God
[1:45:13] for His mercy for our requests that came
[1:45:17] in this morning read over me looked at
[1:45:21] it and just to know like this and how it
[1:45:24] said is that God he is faithful
[1:45:29] taken time that's like this and we're a
[1:45:32] heart could reach out and say I need God
[1:45:35] I need God I need one that'll be a
[1:45:41] constant one living on the inside of me
[1:45:45] not one who's trying here and failing
[1:45:49] here and try but there's one who's a
[1:45:50] constant in my life let's pray father
[1:46:00] Lord I know that you have spoke to us
[1:46:07] not just the Lord for those of us that
[1:46:10] are gathered here but you spoke to us as
[1:46:14] an assembly and Lord perhaps you've
[1:46:18] spoke even beyond that of which would be
[1:46:23] Lord that would come here that would
[1:46:25] look to me as their pastor being a part
[1:46:28] of this assembly under the vision that
[1:46:31] you've given here Lord
[1:46:33] but father you're still God and you know
[1:46:37] every heart Lord of life that Lord could
[1:46:42] even be on the very brink of where they
[1:46:45] don't even feel like going on father I
[1:46:50] asked right now that that same presence
[1:46:54] that's here in this building that same
[1:46:57] constant one that has come and brought
[1:47:01] the unction to deliver this word that
[1:47:04] you would move in that heart Lord move
[1:47:07] upon that life right now Lord by your
[1:47:10] grace you lord that heart and let him
[1:47:15] know
[1:47:15] let him sense that presence Lord like
[1:47:19] Jacob since that night Lord father that
[1:47:23] their hearts that their mind will be
[1:47:25] turned Lord and I pray God
[1:47:30] may there not be one Lord
[1:47:37] Lord would any longer tolerate the enemy
[1:47:43] robbing them from the privilege of being
[1:47:49] a son and daughter of God may they cast
[1:47:53] down all imagination cast down reasoning
[1:47:59] may they take a hold take a hold of you
[1:48:04] Lord say Lord I'm not going to turn
[1:48:08] loose
[1:48:11] I'm not gonna let it go until you bless
[1:48:13] me and only you can change me I can't
[1:48:17] change me and I'm tired of being Jacob I
[1:48:20] don't want to be Jacob no more I want to
[1:48:24] be free oh Jesus Renan Lauren moved down
[1:48:35] in now heart made a Lord receive courage
[1:48:40] take a hold of that word and say Lord

[1:49:28] 19:18 i'm not' some people might have
[1:49:30] been little young people there might be
[1:49:33] some around in nursing homes and things
[1:49:35] like at the Lord when everything came to
[1:49:38] a standstill in the city of Cleveland as
[1:49:41] I read the reports those in those cities
[1:49:43] that didn't come to a standstill those
[1:49:45] cities were rampant with that with that
[1:49:48] Spanish flu Lord I'm glad that we have a
[1:49:54] place of protection
[1:49:56] oh we're not fearful no we have the
[1:50:04] promise that you've given to us Lord
[1:50:12] just as it said in your word in mark 16
[1:50:14] if if if if they drink any deadly thing
[1:50:19] it also said hoard it if that of any
[1:50:27] serpent but it never said to go around
[1:50:29] and handle serpents it never said to go
[1:50:32] around and take deadly things and drink
[1:50:34] it has to try to prove our faith that
[1:50:36] would be pride so we're not here we Lord
[1:50:40] we have nothing to prove perfect love
[1:50:43] cast out all fear
[1:50:44] [Music]

[1:50:55] pray God for every father and every
[1:50:57] mother I pray for every young person
[1:51:01] your God I ask to Lord Jesus that
[1:51:05] through this time that you would just
[1:51:08] minister to every heart continue to
[1:51:12] minister to lives continue to draw us
[1:51:16] closer father through the midst of the
[1:51:19] test through the midst of the trial Lord
[1:51:22] may we be like David have our eyes upon
[1:51:25] the constant one the unchangeable God
[1:51:31] Lord were in times of uncertainty for
[1:51:35] the world Lord you've anointed our eyes

[1:51:45] we see it Lord you have sent the intent
[1:51:49] message the evening light of God that we
[1:51:52] might recognize who we are where we are
[1:51:55] in this place and Lord we don't want to
[1:52:00] be guilty of trying to figure things out
[1:52:02] either because Lord you never come
