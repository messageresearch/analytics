and about you to stand I want to go right here into scriptures tonight we want to just go I want to go straight to Hebrews 10 go back into this and just a little direction we want to take tonight with this here in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 and we want to just look into that here verse 23 of Hebrews chapter 10 it says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer tonight Lord Jesus we we love you more we just appreciate you Lord father we just Lord as we Lord have come out here Lord tonight we have sacrificed to be Lord in your house and we have not Lord placed that as though before you but we're aware in our hearts that Lord we have not come here to be seen we have not come here just to occupy a time or to save it we have fulfilled a duty we have come here tonight Lord because as you promised in your word wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in their midst Lord we know that this is not a protracted gathering the Lord it's a time where you come Lord and you minister to our lives in a personal way and you know every need Lord that's gathered here tonight Lord and you're the only one that can meet those needs so Lord in whatever channel in whatever way Oh God Lord that you would choose Lord to minister to the needs of your people Lord we just come to present ourselves Lord as lives that are available Oh God that you could come and Lord use us Lord for your glory and we ask that God that you'll just move among us Lord and may our hearts be warmed in your presence tonight Lord and when Lord the service Lord it's all said and done may it be Lord echoed from our hearts that it was good to be in the house of God and didn't on our heart burn within us as he talked to us along the way Lord you know our needs Lord every need that's a cross Lord the spectrum tonight God and we're just Lord looking to you that you will now minister Lord to every heart father according to our needs we pray Lord we love you thank you once again in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless your being seated I'd like if you turn with me in the scriptures here and let's go to the book first Corinthians chapter 14 and I want to look at a few scriptures because we know that as as we as as the people of God when we come together that we're not just we're not just coming here to fulfill time or to say that well we've come to church we recognize that coming to church it's it is where God comes and he meets with us in a special way that there are needs that are present in each of our lives and across the spectrum in any in any given service there are there is going to be needs for deliverance there's going to be needs for salvation there will be needs for the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a needs for healing in every service all of those needs are present and and God comes to minister to every need in a very personal way and it's one thing that I have just witnessed over the years you know I they were early on actually within pastoring and watch found that God will minister to the church and he will take things in a certain way and who will so bring us in the manner you know has sons and daughters of God then I've watched the Holy Ghost come right back around and he'll take us and he'll swing our feet over hell to make us realize that there is a real hell and there's a place that we don't want to go to and so God he doesn't do those things to bring fear that we would serve him out of a fear or a I think as the scripture says in the right term of that word fear where it's something that is slavish but God desires that we would serve him in a real reverence in a real love that everything that we do is because that we love him and so when Paul he Paul now is speaking to the Corinthian church and at first Corinthians 14:1 he speaks to to the believers and he says follow after charity now I just got done speaking in that chapter right before this on what charity is and he's dealing with how that charity should be the governing of everything that it's done so he says follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort and he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he that prophesies edifies the church now we understand that what Paul is speaking here on the prophecy is that which is the interpretation of the tongues that are given we understand that there are tongues of men and tongues of angels and Paul is is putting this separation here and he's ministering to that of the Corinthian church and he is telling them in many different chapters you go back to 1st Corinthians 10 and he lets them know that all of them saw the pillar fire they all drink of the rock they all ate of the manna Paul is letting them know do not your salvation is not based and brother Branham would say it this way on healing campaigns on seeing visions or any gear but our salvation is based exclusively on the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ and that becoming personal in our life because it must be something that is completely with him because we know that Satan can impersonate any gift and our real rest is to be appalled that real comfort and peace of the Holy Ghost within our life that we were indeed included in Redemption and so then when that when when that is the basis of every thing then as we'll see as we look at this tonight when that is the real risk of the individual then God can use that person for his glory to be able to be a blessing to others to the body of Jesus Christ because they're not resting upon their gift in other words they do not have that it is not that where that they are feeling as though Victor or victorious if their gift is used they are VIP victory whether they are used once whether they are used twice whether they are used three times or whether they're not used at all they are living in victory so this is where Paul is trying to get the believer to have their faith based upon the right things now I want you to notice what he says here he's dealt in the scripture in verse four but he that prophesies edifies the church I would that you all spake with tongues but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesies then he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying now once you notice one word that you'll find here over and over and this is what I want to deal with here tonight you'll find the word edifying and the word edifying I want to look at that thought on godly edification when we read the scriptures here in Hebrews 10 we have come together and the church comes together with the promise when two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in their midst and to recognize that when we come together there is to be and is an edifying a godly edification in our life now Paul would write about this and I'm just going to refer to it in first Corinthians 12 he spoke to the Corinthians and would say in verse 1 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you ignorant you know it's we recognized Paul is speaking the church because when any person that when they have been baptized into the body of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost they are subject to any of the nine spiritual gifts brother Branham would say it over and over he says it just Mills throughout the body it can be on this one tonight on this one the next night and on this one here and so you know when we recognize Paul is saying what God has placed into your hands I do not want you to be ignorant with it but I want you to operate with understanding because when we have understanding and faith and that operating then we recognize what God has put within our hands there's a great reverence that is with him and Paul would go on in verse 31 of the st. chapter and he would say but covet earnestly the best gifts now Paul went through that chapter you can read it when you get home in 1st Corinthians 12 and Paul is dealing with the differences of administration and how that it is the same spirit that worketh in all and so Paul is saying covet earnestly the best gift now Paul was not was not telling this you know we have to look at how that the the writers would interpret this Paul is not putting it in a manner as though that we are to rank well this gift is better than this gift but the word best here is Paul saying covet earnestly the those that are the most useful because there are gifts that are very useful to the body and Paul is dealing with here in one part of that of the tongues and how that tongues unless there be interpretation it is not useful to the body now we understand that you know and that within it all Paul would hear would express he would desire that everybody in verse 5 that all would speak in tongues but rather that we would prophesy why because prophesy it brings the edification to the Church of the Living God so remember this edification Paul goes on in verse 6 and he says now brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except I shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine I want you to notice what Paul is dealing with what shall it profit you the whole focus that is going on is that the body would be edified is that the body would be profited by what is done so this applies to everything done in the body in verse 7 even things without life giving sound whether pipe or heart except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or what is is harmed for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle and we understand as believers here you know the Spirit of God would direct the Prophet in this hour and he would minister over and over this theme of an uncertain sound and he would take it now let's you think of it he would take this and minister this on the uncertain sound and what it was there was known as he was dealing with there are scriptures that were being preached but the lack of bringing the people into the readiness of the coming of the Lord is an uncertain sound all the way down through the ages even from the outpouring of the Holy Ghost they were to take the gospel and the gospel was to call the people out from the world and into a relationship with Jesus Christ it was to be the word that would be preached that would convict the center of the condition he was in but would cause him to look to the all-sufficient sacrifice of Calvary and that his faith would raise to a to believe that indeed he was crucified for me and he rose again for me and then that faith would release to them a justification where the Lord of sin is lifted off of them and then they walked into the sanctification another further full of God's redemptive work and to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is always been the gospel that is preached is to call men into the full relationship with Jesus Christ because the preaching of the gospel is always about the second coming of the Lord that he is coming and not only is he is coming in a corporal body but it is to declare that he is come he has returned he is not here in his corporal body but the Holy Ghost has come bad that same life that was the end the body of Jesus Christ that's now seated on the throne of God has come back upon the worshiper as a witness that that has been received and you have been accepted in the beloved the gospel of Jesus Christ it is to sound with a certainty that makes us ready for the coming of the Lord now Paul goes on in verse 9 and he says so likewise except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak it into the air there may there are in may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice now watch this I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me now you know what benefit would it do me tonight if I could speak in Tagalog which is the Philippine tongue and I came here and I preached the message that my within it would have such liberating power what good would it do because none of you can understand Tagawa what good would it do if I could speak Dutch there's only one of you that can understand that what good would it do if I could come here and speak Spanish not Porto Rican Spanish I had to say that get some but you understand what good were to do right here there's a lot more that would understand Spanish right but not all of us I mean there's bits and pieces I would be I would be playing catch-up all night I mean once we get past you know you know hermano and hermana and then we do you pass all this you know it's pity the Sun towards we give that's all of that right there you're you're a playing catch-up believe it or not some of those same words are in Tagalog exact same words but I want you to listen what this is the point see God's desire is that understanding would be among us that what is being spoken it would be understood so in other words it doesn't no good for us or any if for an especially Amit just say like this for a ministry if there are things that even though that I can you know be studying many times there's things that you know that I'm a just you get on a run and you're just studying it and I don't even preach it there's things that I've you know God on a run studying the Holy Ghost just open it up but yet I haven't brought it and ministered and many times God will open a thought and I I look at it Lord how does the thought how do we bring it down to everyday life because a burden with in my heart is you I can preach it up here but if I just pray should up here and it never comes down to where you can put it in your lunchbox what good does it do you don't do any good you all kind of service Wow one that awesome what there's no doubt I failed in that sometimes I pray God helped me to be more sensitive that's that's my objective within that is that either things be understood and be applicable to our lives this word edify wants you to watch what this word means the word edify here it is the act of building up it is the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom piety which is reverence happiness and holiness how many times when you hear brother Adam say we are here for one purpose and that is to glorify Jesus Christ we would he said our desire is to leave here that when we leave that you would leave out a better Christian than when you came in that you have a greater desire to serve God and agree and you have a greater are repulsiveness to sin that's the objective that's godly edification because when we when we look at it to think of it that even in the operation of the gifts that would God would have within the body and that includes you know even when we look at ministry or gifts and singing gifts and all those things that God has placed within the body think about this friends if we do not come and assemble ourselves together how can God fulfill this part of the world God has not called us to be cyber Christians if that's something if y'all just say like this cuz I know I'm talking to people streaming if you're satisfied streaming the service and it don't bother you that you're not in the house of God then something's wrong with your Christianity we'll pastors back in town there's something wrong if there's not a desire to be in the house of God gonna tell you something it ain't just here it's the same thing they're battling with in the Philippines as well same thing that they battle with is you know people just want to stay home and strain it ain't you something you know there's testimonies we can go throughout this whole you know time right here within this assembly but there are people sitting here that make a sacrifice to be here and they don't live next door they drive and they come here there's people that's made sacrifices and the reason they want an a day shift job is so they could be in the house of God what about their sister Caroline we paid for over a year and her whole objective was I want to be in the house of God I want to be there when things are going on I want to be in mid-weight service I don't mean to call you out sister Caroline but I think it bass think it behooves mentioning those things that God will always honor that design I'll say it's a good desire to be in the house of God amen you don't know what's gonna happen when we come together so let's let's examine godly edification just a moment because you see this world and it has been all the way through the world wants to purport what is true edification but the mega grace churches are not godly edification it is heaping up damnation because godly edification it promotes growth Christian grow in wisdom in reference in happiness in holiness it does not promote loose living godly edification sometimes it's got to get right down on your cross right down to your address and let you and I know this is where you're living this is where you need to be living what is it all about it's godly edification now Paul would say in 2nd Corinthians 10 7 now remember Paul you know he is dealing with how that the Word of God and I don't have time to go in the background but Paul's dealing with how that some you know I've looking at Paul's appearance when he comes among them and you know Paul don't look very you know very powerful and Paul stature and he looks real weak Paul lets him know it ain't the stature of a man that's powerful it's the way God that is powerful is that the size of the dog in the fight if the size of the fat in the dog do you look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is Christ's let him of himself think this again that as he is Christ even so are we Christ for though I should both somewhat more of our Authority which the LORD hath given us for edification Authority is given for edification whether it's husband whether it's father whether it's pastor it was digging no matter wave covers everything authority is given for edification and sometimes that edification you got to face facts is that right authority is not things that are just handed loosely but we recognize that this edification had pulse it it's not for your destruction now once again let me just get once again Paul in second Corinthians 12 remember Paul is word referring here in second Corinthians twelve nineteen remember there are many who have now went forth and asserting themselves as apostles Paul would call them deceitful workers but and these were individuals who evidently were trying to purport themselves and you know they had a way that its undoubted they were laying everything out of how they were this and how they were that and how they were this and so Paul remember in this verse of scriptures here this chapter he asked them forgive me he says for glory but he lets them know that the tests and the trials that have come me that these tests and trials he said ain't none of them had to go through these things Paul is asserting his apostolic Authority and he lets him know there's not one of these men out here that's met God in this way I don't have time to read the whole chapter but you understand he said bear with me in my glory he lets him know I've been shipwrecked I've been left for dead call answer no that was never anything that I even put before you I have suffered but he said clearly in the book of Colossians I have suffered for the body safe because the rem-pod realized that the revelation that was committed to him there would be suffering that would come his way that would mold his character that the word being delivered would come with power and authority it was circumcised he would cut away unbelief and doubt and everything from the body so Paul would come on and say again safety that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before God in Christ we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying this was a real God called man for your edifying not for self for edifying because Paul had to say some mighty hard things to the Corinthians he here this whole time his phone is laying it down how they're using gifts and how things are going on you're letting sin in the church you're letting this - you're bringing correction but remember godly edification correction leaves in it it's not just godly edification is not patting somebody on the back all the time and saying you're a son of God you're a daughter of God you're a son of God you're a daughter of God but godly edification says hey as the son of God we don't act that way as a daughter of God we don't act that way we don't dress that way we don't treat one another that way that's what godly edification does that's what Paul could say in 2nd Corinthians 13:10 therefore I write these things being absent less being present I should use sharpness according to the power which the Lord have given me to edification and not to destruction my momma but how the world would have us believe well when the word comes - correct that's destruction knowing it you can't run away the believer no sir the Word of God will not run away a believer if the Word of God runs somebody away they need to be run away but sending you out a preacher so everybody feels at home I only want the sons and daughters to feel at home people who want to come here fill up a Pew and live like the world live like the devil I don't want them to kill at home you see edification it brings if edification what is called edification if it don't bring correction in love then it ain't edification it's actually tearing down because you must hold the blessings and the cursings you come back to Deuteronomy on the two mountains right there brother Brandon tells us like this you know brother Bama in one of the messages brother Graham said a man that's always all he is just preaching blessings he said I don't have confidence in that he said because the weapon also contains cursings there's blessings and cursings but you see in today's modern educated society they only want the blessings of God but there's only one way you get the blessings of God brethren ain't a word that kept us your ears it's when your soul it's fully baptized with the Holy Ghost and your bra under the blood of Jesus Christ and that old same nature has been destroyed that's godly edification we're not trying to edify the stretch we're trying to edify sons and daughters of God and sometimes the word has got a comment it's cutting it's cutting away what's it do it's cutting away everything that's not you that's why Paul would go on he would say we are laborers together ye are God's husbandry you are God's building he would go on to say that the grace of God that's given to me as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon in second Corinthians 5:1 for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens now remember what Paul is speaking of here is that same body that Peter wrote of in 2nd Peter we have a body reserved in the heavens he is riding a bat see often he by that word body what is that that is the representation of the son and daughter of God before the throne of God just as we have voted right here I think maybe it was this past week that there was a voting going on there were different ones that were voted for there are people that they might have an office here locally but they actually are positioned down there whether it's in Washington DC or the state and and here they are they are our representatives from this area and the theophany that which is before the throne of God it is our representation and the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost it ties us back into that word body to wear a representation is before the throne of God and it reflects on earth when we live there's no right so you know what's this this building it is that calling us to perfection remember when this when this message this revelation when it has become eagle food to us not just something good it's become eagle food then you have heard from your see often well now what did that do the same call of God that moons up on your life moved up on my life that godly edification did not tell us you're all right all you got to do is love Jesus know the call of that word listen to me now the hearing from that representation it comes through the word of which we are dinner fide with it calls us through the cleansing out the blood it brings us into the sanctified himself and we are positioned in Jesus Christ Zacks godly edification this is what Paul would say in Ephesians 2 you are no more strangers foreigners but your fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God you are built upon the foundation of apostles prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom ye are also building together for in habitation of God through the spirit and remember what the scriptures that I've just read here this is looking at drawed ly edification the whole purpose of all the scriptures we just went through is to see godly edification of how that God comes down to edify our edification is not Pat's on the back edification is where God comes to break amnesia from our life it's where the Holy Spirit comes to bring correction in our life he comes to bring understanding he comes to bring help and strength and ministry to encouragement that's all part of edification so it ain't all correction in ain't all correction there's got to be some building up after correction that God just don't leave you we're here you are you walk around are you a believer yeah and I've got a bunch of stones laying around my life no sir God comes and if there's anything that he has to tell you this isn't setting right he doesn't destroy the whole building he works in the area that it might come into harmony with the blueprint in that growth in him let's look at it here in the scripture in Ephesians 4 the Bible says that he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers no tape recorders verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ you see these gifts notice these are his gifts and and he's the one that uses them and when he uses them his purpose is for his goal it's for the glory of his people it's for the glory of his church it's for the edifying of the body of Christ for the glory of the kingdom of God brother Bramblett said in one place he said perhaps he said there's somebody sitting here tonight and you just need a little lift God has provided those gifts in the body to bring a lift to you and I we might need a little encouragement you know joke of faith but God has placed it there and that he would give a little lift to us and that lift is godly edification Paul goes on to say in verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man now Paul's not talking to when he says perfect man here he's not talking about the soul he's talking about a completely mature thoroughly furnished person what kind of house would it be if you don't have no furniture in it God puts furniture he decorates your walls and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we be that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive this is not plotting them it just said very clearly this this right here is not possible for an individual to do this themselves well I take the message and do this as you break all scriptural patterns it's God who does it let me just but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Oh glory be to God we may grow up into him in all things Oh blessed be his name verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together I want you to listen at this verse and are compacted by that which every joint supplies we're not on an island by ourselves God has so fit to wear the body it's necessary that the body work in harmony the loans cannot say a mouth I don't need you see this theme works throughout we need every member of the body of Jesus Christ we don't need a mouth to be a heart we don't need the mouth to tell the heart what to do nor the heart to tell the mouth what to do or the love we just need everything in its position to operate according to the program of God according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh watch this ver what's this part here now make it increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now everything it is to be done well Paul we were reading here in the first part that what is done in the church is to be unto the edifying of the church that's why Paul said if one speaks in tongues let them also probably interpret why so that the church is edified so now when we look at this verse of scripture that the whole work of the ministry and Paul is especially looking here at the five ministerial offices that God has put into the church and it is now notice that in there maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so the receiving of godly edification is not the flesh but it is the son or daughter of God on the inside sometimes our flesh can get in the way our flesh is men and I don't know that seemed awful hard I don't think those senators looking at this sinner that way if he could only see it through my lens you see godly edification I flesh as who but if will give the inner man the right away the inner man will take that word that separates the living word brings a separation and that inner man will take the word and he will actually grow and his growth is also a subduing of that fleshly man he's growing in Christian wisdom I'm not going to ask you because nobody would raise your hands nobody wants to make the same mistake again nobody likes when we failed you don't say oh my I wish I could fail again no you don't matter of fact that there's a whole process and a little and here you are coming to a time you know to accept you know forgiveness and all that but you see all of this here is where the son and daughter of God on the inside is the one who's being edified by the Living God and receiving the notice to receive it maketh increase as the Bible says unto the edifying of itself in love it in this verse of scripture if you can see it it's like what was ministered to Esther she took and become one with it this is where we take what the Spirit of God is ministering to our life correction encouragement lift all of that and we apply it to our life we receive it and then it is an edifying of ourselves in death and it's made manifest in a lot you see here the body of Jesus Christ where we just read it in Ephesians 2 here is manifest in the bride body the Messiah The Anointed One when we have been quickened by the Spirit of God we are science we are not the Messiah in ourselves but we are part of that mystical body of Jesus Christ for by one spirit we are baptized into one body we have all been made to drink by one spirit so then it is the Anointed One the Messiah and he anoints brother Ram would say like this he anoints all of us and if he would anoint one with a sign and the other doesn't believe it what good would it do it's got to be all of us together though many have looked at and still yet go on and look at the ministry that God has sent in this hour and God has vindicated it with this presence with the very sign of a messiah but yet many will look at it and they don't be Ethan but - you and I it's different we're not looking at a man we recognize that God has fulfilled the scriptural promise of this hour as he said he would make a bride ready for action so you see if there was nobody to believe it what good would it do descendants it's the same way service after service God might be speaking there might be fat people that did it brother that's what it's all about I want everybody to get it but God knows who's going to get it that's why brother Ram says we preach it as though everybody can get it this is why brother animal takers in spiritual food a new season and he would tell us he said if now he said someone came here with scarves in their hands and they were he said they maybe looked exactly like the Hoffmans head of Christ he said and blood were running out of their hands scars all over I wouldn't accept it see it must be identified by the word but notice he says but he embodies himself he embodies himself taking your body and my body and gives you this gives meekness and through these gifts he makes himself known that's the secret food all throughout this building right here if I call your number brother Richard that's a call directly to you from me that signal is going throughout this building but nobody else is gonna get an alert why because it's a personal call that sent out a signal that comes from a tower and where that that well that phone or that chip that you've got in your phone it is baptized into that Network it can actually receive messages well it is invisible but it's Pat see right through this building and that's the same way that God does he embodies himself using gifts that is placed in men lives and using the gift of faith in your life and there's a feeding that goes on and ever and there's others again set by and say well you know brother man I'm out of the word to this here you know he didn't say this exactly right over here you know that they're not feeding they're not feeding no they're not but you and I we are feeding so I believe and said no matter how much he would make himself known by me you've got to believe it you've got to have a gift of faith to believe it see those non spiritual gifts are in our to be operating in every local body they key they are there remember to keep the church clean the ministering of the gifts of the five minister gifts is to bring the church together separating it out a gospel the word the light brings separation and all of this it comes together to bring the church together to make us one if we're really really being edified and receiving edification it does not bring schisms it does not bring division that's why just listening to the word is not enough listen friends you and I both know Mom watch she worked in a nursing home and when she was expecting Paul right here she got sent home on bed rest there was a woman that was there in that nursing home she read her Bible faithfully every day and could quote that Bible but she was meaner in a rattlesnake that's my words him you know my wife sweet enough she wouldn't say that but that's madness the very one that pushed her down on the floor when she was pregnant now then that's not the only one there's people that don't just know the Bible there's people that know this message that's meaner than a rattlesnake there's no submissive and subjection in their heart at all they've got it all put together they're know-it-alls that ain't a sheet brother that's a goat whoo sheets here his vas but the guts ain't you missed this here she went stuff to friends we were at you see the real feeling of the where it makes us one it makes us one in him a brotherhood of one soul one heart one body one spirit then when we have received that godly edification there is an operating in position as believers in Christ in heavenly places when a man and a woman know who they are and what God has called them to do they can relax and God uses them for his glory for the glory of the body if it's a preacher the preacher may only preach once a year depends on what God has set forth he may only preach twice a year then again he might preach twenty five times out of it it's according to how God uses the gift same way within singing it's the same way it's not more than ever know if God has differences the Bible tells us this so everything is to be industry-recognized always be available it'd be like you know if we tapped one of the song leaders and they're coming into church that hey by the way you're gonna have to lead songs in it oh no I can't why not well I'm really not prayed up we see I really haven't done this and I really haven't done that now you'll always be available that's where every one of us I said that's for every one of us you see this is where that Paul oh my I'm just gonna skip some things here Paul would go on that and skip down to first Corinthians 14 12 I want to just close some of this on I'll just skip over some of the rest of it Paul said even so for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you may Excel to the edifying of the church let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayer but my understanding is unfruitful I know throughout this building there's no doubt you know different ones of us pray and you know you'll go right in and you begin you move right into an unknown tongue our understanding when that happens our understanding is unfruitful but there is a consolation that goes into the heart of a person they know they're in contact with God and you with me this is what Paul is some are understanding within it is unfruitful but there is a consolation see it is an edifying yourself and that is perfectly permissible in your prayer closet are you with me in your prayer closet or when you're driving down the roadway that's absolutely permissible so understanding let me just try to close this out verse 15 so it's under so it's edification that all should glorify the work of Jesus Christ Paul said I will pray with the spirit verse 15 I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit I will sing with the understanding also else well let me just say like this you all know and many of you know what I'm talking about there are certain songs right now that some songs that perhaps that we would sing and some that sing online you sing that song in a denominational Church nobody is going to understand what you're saying we're on a journey that started in the mind of God and will end in a glorified body denominations won't stand down so what do you need to focus on I shall mine eyes to Calvary are you with me because we're interested in that heart being edified is that right poorni and maybe you know you're you're just witnessing to people you all understand what I'm saying verse 16 else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say amen at the giving of things Paul Paul you seem like you're so worried about the unlearned Paul said I'm worried about everybody that comes through those doors Paul said I want so everybody will be able to understand seeing he understandeth not what they say for thou very give us thinks well but the other is not edified I think my god I speak with tongues more than you all how many know Paul knew many different languages you know how it is somebody speaks in her language they're talking about you got some you lighten up just go and talk about me in English the same it sound like a conflict say lord help me yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue brethren be not children in understanding but in malice be children but an understanding be men if therefore here become verse 23 if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that you're mad am believers I ain't worried about that's not the attitude Paul had you gotta say well I was always a believer down beneath all the darkness I agree hello now but there's gotta come something that'll break those clouds back but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of the truth so I think we're very clear godly edification isn't just having gifts and our midst but that they're operating according to the Word of God it promotes growth in the body remember this this godly edification this think about this tongues being given interpretation coming can actually reveal to a person your healing is prolonged because you need to take care of this in your life put the sandal that's tearing down no it's not it's edifying it's edifying it's helping the person free themselves of what it is that's holding a bat from the blessing of God that belongs to her godly edification comes to a define it comes to correct it comes to bring people to know God this is why Paul would say I'll close with this verse 26 how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you half a song half a doctrine half the time half a regulation half an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying Paul even goes into the next verse let everything be done in two or three what if somebody else will this is the fourth set of speaking in tongues hold it that's the Word of God so if that would apply then - speaking in tongues and interpreting how about a service with specials I'm not trying to put no doctrine I'm trying to say what is the purpose of when we come together it's to edify the body of believers you've probably been into it I've been in services where specials were wonderful but the people were wore out I was in a meeting one time the song service went well I've been in multiple means where they went a long time and one brother came out one time you know I never forget we were there in the meetings and he just he said congregation I don't want you to see he said called this brother the plays the trumpet by the Bruce he said I want you to play only believe and I want nobody to sing I want you just to let your mind focus on those words people were depleted but when he began to pray they begin to play that in their people nobody saying he focused on only belief the Holy Spirit came right back down in the building you see that's why even with it's important to know when is enough enough in other words God don't want you to clean your plate God likes to take the plate when you've got fourth of the steak left to eat why'd you stop it like that so you relish his presence it's edification that being said how better a closing happen don't you love the Lord I want to be I want to be where he is at I want to be gathered with his body and in everything we want it to be to the edification of the body of believers sometimes there's things that's behaving to be said other times it's believing zip it and don't say anything is that right amen say lord help us we want to we want to edify and we want to receive that edification Lord Jesus thank you Father for your mercy thank you Lord for Lord your instruction in the word your God for each of our lives to see on you you work so masterfully Lord you the godly edification Lord how you work Lord among your body Lord in everything this is our desire when we go into a restaurant even in that we want to leave it better than when we found it the waiter or waitress having a bad day we want to try to do anything we can to be able to encourage them meat counter whoever it might be Lord Lord and we we feel in that way with all of that father when we come here we come together this is our desire is that the Church of God would be edified Lord for every song that son that father it would be for the edification of the body I thank you in order for song leaders that step aside and they consecrate themselves Lord and pray and they seek your will for the songs to be sung thank you Lord for your God those who had seen specials and who would be used in such a measure thank you Lord that they are they're sensitive to you Lord to sing a song because many times I've witnessed how you'll take a song and you will speak right to a heart of our life to encourage that Lord let them know that you're mindful that's a gift that you use Lord we want you to use every gift there's there's gifts right here in this body right here that they may never step foot on this platform but they are just as important Lloyd Lord when they've got a heart for your body [Music] the Lord there in prayer they are mindful and they don't see somebody they call them they check maybe they go visit him maybe
