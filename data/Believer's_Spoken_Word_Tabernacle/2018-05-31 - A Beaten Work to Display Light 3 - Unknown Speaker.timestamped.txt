[26:47] [Music]
[26:49] Alleluia amen you love him tonight a man
[26:54] it certainly is good to be gathered
[26:57] together here tonight and the precious
[26:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just
[27:02] want to say that we I know not everyone
[27:05] is here and different ones that were
[27:08] apart even in the meetings there this
[27:10] weekend but just such a on Sunday I
[27:14] wanted to make mention of it after
[27:17] looking and everything and just to see
[27:18] how that just such a concerted effort
[27:21] just everyone just coming together and I
[27:23] know brother Bill was mentioning it I
[27:26] wasn't there when the doors were opened
[27:28] on that fellowship hall even though they
[27:30] were late but just to see how everybody
[27:32] brother Bill's testimony was and it said
[27:35] he said there's no way I could have done
[27:37] that on my own
[27:37] he said but just to see everybody just
[27:40] come right together you know and I'll
[27:42] tell you that's a real that's just a
[27:44] real testimony and you know it's um it's
[27:47] something that the Lord just you know
[27:49] when God gives a burden yet it takes all
[27:52] within our hearts just you're standing
[27:54] behind that I believe that I know I was
[27:56] sure blessed this weekend
[27:57] I was sure blessed this weekend I I
[28:00] thank God for his visitation and the
[28:03] Lord just coming in just really speaking
[28:05] to our hearts and and perhaps some of
[28:09] you are kind of like me you after a few
[28:12] days you start feeling the effects of
[28:15] those things you know but it's it's good
[28:18] you see our body can fill it but yet
[28:20] what has been sown and what we've taken
[28:23] in all my it's it's priceless it's
[28:26] priceless for what the Lord has done and
[28:28] and so we just were so thankful to God
[28:31] for His mercy so thankful for all that
[28:33] different visitors had come and they
[28:35] brought their licks of fire I had
[28:37] mentioned to many of the pastors even on
[28:39] early Sunday morning had greeted many of
[28:42] the pastor's were different ones had
[28:43] come and just was thinking them you know
[28:45] for coming and being a part of the
[28:48] meeting and just so just so wonderful to
[28:51] be able to fellowship together in
[28:53] just so wonderful so we want to just
[28:56] look into the word of the Lord tonight
[28:58] and we certainly need his help we want
[29:00] to look in Exodus chapter 25 once again
[29:13] Exodus 20:5 and
[29:22] verse 31
[29:27] when you say that when you have it just
[29:29] say you men and thou shalt make a
[29:36] candlestick of pure gold I wanted I want
[29:40] you to watch in the scriptures here
[29:42] where how what is first and what is
[29:45] spoken of what is what is in view here
[29:49] and thou shalt make a candlestick of
[29:52] pure gold of beaten work shall the
[29:56] candlestick be made his shaft and his
[30:01] branches his bowls his knobs and his
[30:05] flowers shall be of the same let's just
[30:11] ask the Lord's blessing in the word
[30:15] Heavenly Father Lord as we give of
[30:19] ourselves Lord hear Lord speaker and
[30:23] hearer together lord we've come Lord
[30:26] with a purpose and a desire and a heart
[30:29] to hear from you
[30:30] and Lord we know that that will take
[30:33] Lord truly a supernatural act from you O
[30:38] God Lord that you would comment and take
[30:42] the gift Lord that you've placed here in
[30:44] my life and Lord my desire is to move
[30:47] out of the way and Lord as the people
[30:50] Lord hear Lord of gathered their desire
[30:53] Lord is to also move out of the way and
[30:56] Lord to place all of the cares and
[30:59] worries of this life Lord before you
[31:02] because Lord we can walk in here with so
[31:05] many questions and not knowing what road
[31:07] to take or what decision but in your
[31:10] presence Lord you're the one that we
[31:13] want to influence our lives Lord
[31:15] so we know that Lord as we come in here
[31:18] Lord our purpose is that we leave out of
[31:21] your different people Lord that father
[31:24] we have a confidence that you are the
[31:26] answer for every need in every question
[31:30] in our life so we wait patiently upon
[31:33] you Lord for the Lord as you've told us
[31:35] be careful for nothing don't be anxious
[31:38] but wait on the Lord in heat
[31:40] renew thy strength Lord this is a
[31:44] promise to us and we Lord as believers
[31:47] we are looking to you even in those
[31:50] moments that we don't know the next step
[31:52] to take but we are waiting in you Lord
[31:55] father for your faithful Lord always to
[31:59] come at your appointed time Lord as
[32:02] you've spoken in your word and Lord we
[32:04] just love you we've gathered here
[32:06] tonight and we ask that you would have
[32:08] your way we just want to present
[32:10] ourselves Lord we don't have any any
[32:13] form or any Lord direction to give you
[32:16] but we stand Lord as vessels that are
[32:19] yielded to follow your direction Lord
[32:21] and you're leading tonight may you just
[32:23] come in a very special way Lord and just
[32:26] pour out of yourself the Lord in our
[32:28] midst tonight or God and speaking to
[32:31] hearts and lives Lord in a very personal
[32:33] way Lord we love you and we thank you
[32:36] Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[32:39] god bless yous your being seated tonight
[32:44] want to look here at this once again a
[32:49] beaten work to display light and one of
[32:53] just in looking at how that it is set
[32:56] forth here you'll notice in the
[32:59] scriptures and just for sake of time I
[33:01] didn't read them but you'll notice that
[33:04] what is first and what is drawn here
[33:06] when it speaks of the the candelabras or
[33:10] the menorah and we know that it's a part
[33:12] within the in the tabernacle and all all
[33:15] of the parts would we see this all the
[33:18] way through the tabernacle with in the
[33:20] wilderness remember maybe for some
[33:23] that's a little new within the faith
[33:25] just remember that God's desire has
[33:29] always been to Tabernacle inside of man
[33:33] that the Old Testament is filled with
[33:37] many types and shadows wonderful types
[33:40] and shadows and that no matter where
[33:42] that you can look within the Old
[33:45] Testament and truly seeing it in its
[33:47] right light you'll see Christ to be the
[33:50] center of it there's certain things that
[33:53] you know I would say
[33:54] that probably all of us that are
[33:56] gathered here tonight there are things
[33:58] that maybe you can read or have read or
[34:01] even in your time when you look back at
[34:03] the Old Testament and maybe not seeing
[34:05] many of these things within their
[34:08] clarity but you know God has a time and
[34:10] God has a season for it and we know that
[34:13] when we look at it that they're very
[34:15] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ was not
[34:18] something that was just II as we say
[34:23] just dropped but he yet it was
[34:25] prophesied of the whole time all the way
[34:29] through from even from when in the very
[34:32] heavens themselves even as God wrote his
[34:35] first Bible there in the heavens it
[34:38] always in all things it is to speak of
[34:41] the Lord Jesus Christ and when I look at
[34:44] this this work that is mentioned here
[34:46] the first focus and the attention is
[34:49] upon this should make a candlestick of
[34:52] pure gold and then it begins to go
[34:56] through and it speaks that everything
[34:58] that's of that of this candlestick
[35:01] there's six branches that come out of it
[35:03] and then it lays that all of these parts
[35:07] in verse 31 his shaft his branches his
[35:10] bowls
[35:11] his knobs his flowers shall be of the
[35:14] same so in everything that we see when
[35:18] we look at this pure candlestick we're
[35:22] recognizing that this is none other than
[35:24] the Lord Jesus Christ God coming down
[35:27] and in in redemption to bring you an eye
[35:31] to himself and that our lives are
[35:34] completely completely his everything is
[35:39] to be completely his and I look at this
[35:42] when I I think of this when you see how
[35:45] that God spoke to Moses and he tells
[35:48] Moses remember in this vision he tells
[35:51] Moses regarding the vision that there
[35:54] were men that he had filled with his
[35:57] spirit God makes mention of this and
[35:59] Exodus 31 and then he he brings it back
[36:02] again in Exodus 35 and then it's
[36:04] mentioned again in Exodus 37 but God
[36:07] lets him know
[36:08] there are men that I have filled with
[36:10] wisdom and these these men that I have
[36:13] filled with my spirit to work in wisdom
[36:16] to work in understanding their to work
[36:19] also in all knowledge and all manner of
[36:22] workmanship so and all of the things
[36:24] that were done what God had showed Moses
[36:27] their God had opened this visions of
[36:30] Moses to show him what was there in the
[36:33] heavenlies but yet now to take what was
[36:36] now in a vision and what would be spoken
[36:38] it must come into manifestation and God
[36:43] Himself to think of this of how that God
[36:45] had men that were set aside that were
[36:49] able to enter in to that same
[36:52] inspiration not another inspiration but
[36:55] that same inspiration and what they
[36:58] would see and what they themselves would
[37:00] behold would be the same thing that
[37:03] Moses beheld they themselves were not
[37:06] able to take themselves there but notice
[37:09] God said even even in the midst of the
[37:12] vision when all was taking place within
[37:15] Israel God said I have filled them
[37:18] past-tense with my spirit you see God
[37:21] already seeing you and I even before the
[37:25] foundation of the world he he made a way
[37:28] knowing that you would want life you
[37:30] would desire life because you are part
[37:32] of him he already seen you as a matter
[37:35] of fact he sees you as a finished work
[37:38] but you see we need we need that same
[37:41] channel of inspiration that has moved
[37:44] upon our lives that you and I can begin
[37:47] to see ourselves even more clearly the
[37:51] way that God has always saw us because
[37:55] many things that we know about ourselves
[37:57] or have known and when we look at
[37:59] ourselves it's very easy for us in and
[38:02] in our in our first nativity and even
[38:05] have to being born again it's very easy
[38:08] to just think about all of the mistakes
[38:11] and all the failures but you see God is
[38:14] able by his Spirit to bring you an eye
[38:17] into that place to where we're operating
[38:20] the same inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[38:24] and this is where God has brought these
[38:26] individuals and you see and within it I
[38:29] want you to catch this here within it
[38:31] they themselves would have the wisdom
[38:33] here's what being filled with the spirit
[38:35] did it gave them wisdom it gave them
[38:38] understanding it gave them knowledge to
[38:40] work all manner of workmanship you and I
[38:43] both know that you and I cannot perform
[38:46] the Word of God and perform his will on
[38:49] our own but we need the Holy Spirit
[38:52] revealing his will to our lives and it's
[38:55] not you and I that's that's the one
[38:57] doing it we just simply become vessels
[39:00] that are yielded that he himself is the
[39:03] one who receives all the glory so when
[39:06] it's all said and done there is nothing
[39:08] that you and I can say I did this or I
[39:11] did that all we can say is I just
[39:13] happened to be standing here and he
[39:16] showed up I just happened to be here
[39:19] because it was in my arrangement but God
[39:22] has a rage that I would be here God
[39:25] arranged that you would hear this
[39:27] glorious truth you're ordained you are a
[39:30] part of it and it's the truth itself
[39:33] that came and sought you out I look at
[39:36] this of how this inspiration it moves
[39:40] within this time and I think of how that
[39:42] God moves down and he speaks through
[39:45] Peter of how that there were prophets
[39:47] men of old who were set aside and they
[39:51] themselves were moved by the Spirit of
[39:53] God the Bible says in Hebrews one I
[39:55] believe it's verse one it speaks of how
[39:58] that he spake how that God spake in the
[40:01] prophets to them and how that he was the
[40:04] Spirit of Christ Peter picks it up in
[40:06] 1st Peter chapter 1 it was the Spirit of
[40:09] Christ in them and it did signify one
[40:13] manner and how that Christ would come
[40:15] you see they entered in the prophets of
[40:18] old I want you understand me now how the
[40:20] prophets themselves did not pry
[40:23] themselves into these places they were
[40:25] ordained prophets they were ordained
[40:28] prophets they were predestinated by God
[40:31] and here
[40:33] that gift that would lay upon the earth
[40:35] the Spirit of God moving down and how
[40:38] that they were a part of that life they
[40:40] themselves would be moved by the Spirit
[40:43] of Almighty God that same inspiration
[40:45] the same honors in the beginning the
[40:48] same one who spoke in Genesis 3 that
[40:51] same spirit of God would move down upon
[40:55] these prophets and they themselves
[40:57] notice what harmony how in the world can
[41:00] you get a group of people in harmony it
[41:02] would be impossible for this man stop to
[41:05] match this man stop to match this man
[41:08] sloth to match this man's thought it
[41:10] would be impossible but remember the
[41:13] prophets were not speaking their own
[41:15] thoughts they were speaking as they were
[41:19] moved by the Holy Ghost they entered
[41:25] into that same channel of inspiration
[41:28] and notice all the way then all the way
[41:32] down through the scriptures we find that
[41:35] when Christ Himself he comes upon this
[41:38] earth God becoming flesh we find of how
[41:41] that he declares himself that he indeed
[41:45] was in the prophets he was in the Psalms
[41:49] he was in the Proverbs were you with me
[41:52] he was there the whole time he
[41:54] matter-of-fact in his resurrection and
[41:56] Luke 24 he declares beginning with Moses
[42:00] he begins to declare all the way through
[42:03] it was me it was me it was me it was me
[42:08] oh my I want to just draw your attention
[42:15] to this tonight because when we look at
[42:18] things you know and we're looking at who
[42:21] should be and the one that is
[42:23] highlighted in our midst there should
[42:25] not be one that is even brought to that
[42:28] of equalness to the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:31] because let me tell you something there
[42:33] is only one who has redeemed you and I
[42:36] the one who shed his blood for us and
[42:39] every true life will point to that work
[42:43] of redemption in the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:46] never lift anybody into that place
[42:49] nobody in his in that place that place
[42:52] is reserved for him and him alone they
[42:57] men you believe that tonight so look at
[43:00] how that the scripture would even speak
[43:02] of this and and continue to highlight it
[43:05] in Exodus 39 verse 37 the Bible says the
[43:09] pure candlestick with the lamps thereof
[43:13] even with the lamps to be set in order
[43:16] and all the vessels thereof and they
[43:18] offer light but I want to draw your
[43:20] attention back to the pure candlestick
[43:22] with the Lance thereof notice it says
[43:27] these are lamps of the candlestick the
[43:32] candlestick is not of the lamps but the
[43:35] lamps are of the candlestick without the
[43:38] candlestick the lamps are nothing are
[43:42] you with me
[43:42] but it's the candlestick and the lamps
[43:45] belong to the candlestick
[43:47] here's lamps belong to him they are his
[43:50] lamps are you with me
[43:51] so we notice that within this the
[43:54] scripture says here in second chronicles
[43:56] 13 11 just a few verses of reference
[43:59] here and it says and the candlestick of
[44:02] gold with the lamps thereof the
[44:04] candlestick of gold with lamps now
[44:07] remember this candlestick is a pure gold
[44:10] it cannot be mixed with anything else it
[44:14] must be pure gold and the lamps belong
[44:16] to the candlestick you see it speaks
[44:20] this speaks in such detail that our life
[44:24] is not to be our own it's in our life is
[44:28] not to be about us but our life is to be
[44:31] about him we've been bought with a price
[44:34] if it wasn't for him we would be nothing
[44:38] we can clearly say as he said upon this
[44:42] earth when he walked here in a fleshly
[44:44] body that we can not do anything without
[44:47] him remember what he said he said the
[44:50] son can do it and can do nothing but
[44:52] what he see it the father doing
[44:54] and then that doeth the son likewise so
[44:57] without he
[44:58] were nothing but we've been bought with
[45:01] a price
[45:02] aren't you glad for that tonight amen
[45:06] and so we're being bought for a price
[45:08] there's a reason and it was not just
[45:10] something that you know sometimes where
[45:12] you go to a a junk store or whatever you
[45:14] call it you know and you look at this
[45:15] and you think hmm let me see here
[45:19] I don't know wonder what I could use
[45:20] this box for I don't know I'll just pick
[45:23] this box up and we'll just see I don't
[45:25] know I I who knows I mean I don't know
[45:27] I'll just put this with the other other
[45:29] 52 boxes of God what are you gonna use
[45:31] for a mile and I just put it there that
[45:34] is not the way that the Lord Jesus
[45:36] worked he knew what was in the pawnshop
[45:40] and he knew the potential that lay
[45:44] within his subjects when he came to
[45:47] earth he never came wandering or
[45:49] questioning would somebody feel sorry
[45:52] for me will somebody serve me he knew
[45:54] exactly what he was coming for and that
[45:57] there would be vessels there are vessels
[46:01] that are ordained for a purpose you
[46:03] realize that God has ordained your life
[46:06] for purpose and you and I are the ones
[46:09] coming into that place which is Paul
[46:11] declaring the mystery of Christ
[46:14] that it's you and I were already here we
[46:17] were we were ordained to be vessels of
[46:20] God but yet it had to be him come and
[46:23] redeem us and bring us unto himself and
[46:26] then he by his life in us empowers us
[46:29] and fills us and then it's him working
[46:32] through us so it isn't God wandering
[46:35] around with your life I wonder what I
[46:37] wonder what I wonder what I should do
[46:39] with him I wonder what I should do with
[46:41] her God is not doing that that's you and
[46:44] I but you see the sooner that we can
[46:47] realize and let our hands be taken off
[46:50] and tried to not perform it by our power
[46:52] our mind then God Himself can perform
[46:55] his perfect will in our lives God
[46:58] doesn't want our hands on it he did not
[47:01] redeem us and then say you know what I
[47:03] got you out of the pawn shop but I don't
[47:05] know if I can really use your now I
[47:06] don't know if I can do this so I'm gonna
[47:08] need your strength he doesn't need my
[47:10] strength
[47:11] he doesn't need your strength the only
[47:13] thing about our strength is to yield
[47:16] ourselves to him that he might perform
[47:19] his word through us think about this
[47:24] lamps of the candlestick now look at how
[47:29] look at how that the scripture goes on
[47:31] with this in Exodus 35 14 the
[47:35] candlestick also for the light and his
[47:37] furniture and his lamps whose lives are
[47:41] they his lamps so after his lamps they
[47:46] must reflect his life if they are a lamp
[47:51] and reflect something else they're not
[47:53] his limbs his lamps reflect him his
[47:58] lamps declare where he where the source
[48:02] and origin of their life is of numbers 4
[48:07] 9 the candlestick and they shall take a
[48:10] cloth of blue I look at even how they
[48:13] wrap them and cover the candlestick of
[48:16] the light notice cover the candlestick
[48:20] of the light not just the candlestick
[48:24] but the candlestick of the light because
[48:26] it is the candlestick that is lit first
[48:29] it is the candlestick itself of which
[48:33] the other lamps themselves would derive
[48:36] their own light without this candlestick
[48:40] of light there is no light now watch how
[48:44] that God would place this let's just
[48:46] kind of review this just a little bit in
[48:48] Exodus 40 verse 4 notice once again and
[48:52] thou shalt bring in the candlestick and
[48:56] light the lamps thereof notice who comes
[48:59] in first thou shall bring in the
[49:02] candlestick it's almost as though the
[49:04] candlestick is here and the lamps are
[49:06] coming in behind but it's altogether are
[49:08] you with me it's all together but what
[49:11] is the highlight the highlight is the
[49:14] candlestick so who's to be highlighted
[49:17] all the way through the candlestick so
[49:20] you mean there's not a lamp that's to be
[49:22] highlighted no
[49:24] No if a lamp is highlighted more than
[49:28] the candlestick it's not right you can
[49:31] see the people doing yet or it's that
[49:33] lamp that that lamp is not truly of the
[49:36] candlestick are you with me
[49:38] for every lap will truly maintain its
[49:41] position because every lamp realizes its
[49:44] life source is of him and it recognizes
[49:47] its purpose just like Paul knew his
[49:49] purpose is that right that's the same
[49:52] way it comes down to you and I notice
[49:54] this here in numbers 8 verse 1 and the
[49:57] Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto
[50:00] Aaron and say unto him when thou
[50:05] lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall
[50:10] give light over against the candlestick
[50:16] it mattered how they lit this you didn't
[50:20] mattered it wasn't just oK we've got
[50:22] this candlestick we've got the menorah
[50:24] just you know Aaron make sure you you
[50:26] light it no no there's a way to light it
[50:29] remember God just not do things
[50:31] haphazardly God is interested everything
[50:35] that God does whether it's things spoken
[50:37] or whether it's actions
[50:40] it is prophetic it will always it always
[50:44] speaks of him and the way that he will
[50:47] do these things notice when thou
[50:49] lightest the lamps the seven laps shall
[50:52] give light over against the candlestick
[50:56] no glory in their own but they shall
[51:00] give light over against the candlestick
[51:03] so every true lamp will do what it will
[51:08] reflect Jesus Christ if a lamp doesn't
[51:13] reflect Jesus Christ it's not a true
[51:16] lamp but every true laughs their life it
[51:20] reflects it gives alive
[51:22] it gives witness over to the candlestick
[51:26] Christ the center of it watch this in
[51:31] verse three and Aaron
[51:35] did so he lighted the lamps there of
[51:39] over against the candlestick as the LORD
[51:43] commanded Moses now let me read this
[51:46] tree I don't think I didn't include this
[51:48] but I read it to you the last time we
[51:50] were together but RAM tells us like this
[51:53] in the Patmos vision he said the lamp
[51:54] was lit in a special way first
[51:58] the priests took fire from the sacred
[52:02] altar which was originally lighted by
[52:05] the fire of God so you could not take in
[52:09] a strange fire you cannot take in a
[52:11] different fire but it must be the same
[52:14] fire that came and consumed the
[52:17] sacrifice there on the brazen altar
[52:20] which speaks of the fire of God
[52:22] accepting and receiving the sacrifice as
[52:26] is mentioned in Isaiah 53 so that same
[52:30] fire of God now notice this it must be
[52:34] that same fire he said he lit what's
[52:37] this he lit first of all the lamp that
[52:40] was sitting on top of the bowl the lap
[52:46] that was sitting on top of the bowl now
[52:48] remember when they were pouring in the
[52:51] oil they didn't go around pouring in the
[52:53] oil within each of the branches the
[52:55] branches get their life out of the vine
[52:57] is that right there is a bowl as it
[53:00] speaks in Zechariah 4 - as a Cariah
[53:03] noticed the bowl on the top thereof the
[53:06] Holy Spirit will notice when here
[53:08] the sacrifice is received the Bible says
[53:11] that there were they were in dude with
[53:14] power from on high
[53:16] the Holy Spirit came down as a witness
[53:20] that the sacrifice not only had been
[53:23] accepted but the Holy Spirit comes down
[53:26] to make them aware that they are
[53:28] included in the sacrificial offering
[53:32] mama what's this he lit first of all the
[53:36] lamp that was sitting on top the ball so
[53:39] you mean it makes a difference you mean
[53:41] it makes a difference on who you set
[53:43] forth first
[53:43] it sure does there ought to be one
[53:46] person that you identify first when
[53:48] you witness and that's the Lord Jesus
[53:50] Christ at the truth that ought to be
[53:55] that they are their identification and
[53:57] the witness is of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:59] if listen friends if this message that
[54:01] has been truly revealed to us then it
[54:04] ought to have revealed Jesus Christ to
[54:07] you and I if it's something else and
[54:09] we've got the wrong revelation if the
[54:12] message that we're hearing all we can
[54:14] see is brother branham wrong revelation
[54:16] this message brings Jesus Christ to the
[54:20] forefront it does not highlight a man it
[54:24] does not raise up a man it does not
[54:26] raise up a church it raises up Jesus
[54:29] Christ in his original power and
[54:32] original glory hallelujah glory be to
[54:38] God in the highest you matters how its
[54:41] lit it matters how it's lit all things
[54:45] listen to me now
[54:46] all things ought to start with Christ
[54:49] nothing is to be ministered in the
[54:52] church except you'd be fairly vindicated
[54:56] by the scriptures is that right
[55:00] that's exactly what our prophet told us
[55:02] he stood for that is that right he stood
[55:07] for and over and over nothing should be
[55:10] preached unless it is vindicated within
[55:13] the Scriptures it's gets the right order
[55:17] it's the right order you see if it's not
[55:20] held that Christ is the center then
[55:24] things can start going off well I've got
[55:29] quotes for it you might have quotes for
[55:31] it but if Christ does not remain the
[55:33] center you're on the wrong path is that
[55:36] right
[55:37] it must highlight Jesus Christ it's not
[55:41] just about will to the center it's got
[55:43] to be word on top of word but you can't
[55:45] divide the word from the spirit it must
[55:47] be his life that's being expressed in
[55:51] whatever doctrine and whatever truth in
[55:53] whatever is minister it must highlight
[55:57] Jesus Christ to be the same if it's not
[56:01] somebody's lightning in the wrong order
[56:04] hello somebody over the sand I got
[56:08] quotes I don't care if you got quotes if
[56:10] them quotes don't highlight Jesus Christ
[56:12] to be the same yesterday today and
[56:14] forever you need to let the Holy Spirit
[56:17] take that evil spirit away from you that
[56:20] wants to take Jesus Christ from being
[56:22] the sinner
[56:25] whew Rory
[56:27] he then lit the second lamp from the
[56:31] flame of the first so it didn't go back
[56:34] to the altar now remember from the altar
[56:36] the flame is moved they lit the lamp up
[56:38] on the top then they moved there from
[56:41] that they moved in from the to the first
[56:43] lap then they're moving from the first
[56:45] lap to the second lap they aren't taking
[56:47] the fire from one lap to another it is
[56:50] the same fire of God that is moved down
[56:54] through the Gentile Church ages the same
[56:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same
[57:00] Living God coming and redeeming his
[57:03] subjects age after age time after time
[57:06] he is redeeming what belongs to him and
[57:10] he works through them hmm but remember
[57:17] he only works through a certain way it's
[57:21] got to be his provided way it can be any
[57:26] other other way it's got to be his
[57:28] provided way when it comes this provided
[57:31] way then he can work through that way
[57:35] amen the third lap received this fire
[57:38] from the second land has did the fourth
[57:40] receive it's from the third and so on
[57:42] until all seven lamps were burning this
[57:45] holy fire from the altar being passed
[57:47] from lab to lab is a wonderful type of
[57:49] the Holy Spirit in the seven church age
[57:51] 'as the original outpouring of Pentecost
[57:53] which outpouring came direct from Jesus
[57:56] on the mercy seat in doing his church
[57:59] throughout all seven churches showing
[58:02] forth perfectly you catch in that
[58:07] showing forth perfectly that Jesus
[58:11] is the same yesterday today and forever
[58:16] the never changing God in his essence
[58:20] and his ways he's the same God now
[58:25] notice this light that King John's picks
[58:28] it up here in John 1:1 in the beginning
[58:31] was the word and the Word was with God
[58:33] and the Word was God
[58:35] the same was in the beginning with God
[58:38] all things were made by him and without
[58:41] him was not anything made that was made
[58:44] in him was life and the life was the
[58:48] light of men I want you to listen to me
[58:52] just a moment here these there have been
[58:55] many prophets and different ones down
[58:57] through time where God had been able to
[59:00] reflect his light because the prophets
[59:02] themselves were being were reflectors of
[59:05] light but they were not able but I did
[59:08] not have the ability it was not that of
[59:10] the light where a man and women were
[59:13] able to experience redemption but we
[59:16] realized that they were gathered under
[59:18] that truth that was made known and
[59:20] they're a part of that truth and as it
[59:22] was gathered we were also realized that
[59:24] they were awaiting the fulfillment and
[59:26] coming of the Messiah they were gathered
[59:29] with that with that earnest and a lot
[59:31] don't you see that when the real coming
[59:33] of the Holy Spirit it does not make
[59:35] complacent people it does not make us
[59:39] come to a place where well this is it I
[59:42] have arrived it doesn't work that way
[59:44] when the real Holy Spirit takes
[59:46] residence within the heart of the
[59:48] believer it gives you up out of your
[59:51] natural senses it gives you a vision
[59:53] that's beyond this world you might have
[59:56] to live in this world we have to do
[59:58] things in this world but your life is
[1:00:00] not about this world your life is being
[1:00:03] lived for that other world that you have
[1:00:06] been born of been touched by been
[1:00:09] birthed into you are living here for
[1:00:14] that there so your life is no longer
[1:00:19] your own but here when the Lord Jesus
[1:00:22] comes now in him was life he
[1:00:24] was the very life giver himself the very
[1:00:27] one that had revealed himself to the
[1:00:29] prophets the very one the very spirit of
[1:00:31] God that had moved upon the prophets and
[1:00:33] they themselves would speak under that
[1:00:35] divine channel of inspiration of the
[1:00:37] true candlestick the Messiah who was to
[1:00:40] come they would express that but now
[1:00:42] when God Himself becoming one of us
[1:00:45] noticed the testimony in him was life
[1:00:49] and that life was the light of men now
[1:00:55] man already had light within themselves
[1:00:58] as far as in their spirit but it could
[1:01:00] come and go is that right he could come
[1:01:03] and go Redemption had not come forth to
[1:01:05] where that the very soul of man should
[1:01:08] actually be lit up there had not been a
[1:01:10] price that was paid it just comes back
[1:01:12] to that box I was talking about that box
[1:01:15] itself we could use that box for a lot
[1:01:17] of things but if it still hadn't been
[1:01:19] brought out of the prong shop it still
[1:01:21] is not solely in my possession but once
[1:01:23] the debt has been paid that thing which
[1:01:26] always belonged to me it's solely mine
[1:01:29] they understand what I'm saying after I
[1:01:31] get done using it here in this service
[1:01:33] and don't go back to the pawn shop it is
[1:01:36] mine I have purchased it so the use of
[1:01:39] it it doesn't leave come and go come and
[1:01:42] go but at the spirit of God abides to
[1:01:46] work through this you with me this
[1:01:50] because redemption has been paid and
[1:01:53] remember when the candlestick himself
[1:01:55] come on whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:01:58] descend and remain the same as he the
[1:02:03] same as he walked the pure candlestick
[1:02:06] so notice in him was the light and the
[1:02:10] life was the light of men remember what
[1:02:14] it was that lightened the world in the
[1:02:17] very beginning when the world itself set
[1:02:20] in total darkness it was covered over
[1:02:24] but what lightened the world in the
[1:02:26] beginning was his word let there be
[1:02:30] light
[1:02:31] now you can look and say well then that
[1:02:34] was sunlight but remember the Sun is
[1:02:36] only a proud
[1:02:37] of his word his word is what gave light
[1:02:42] there in the beginning so what brought
[1:02:45] light to this chaos that now you and a
[1:02:47] half here we are walking in around upon
[1:02:50] this earth it was his word that brought
[1:02:53] light when that word became open when
[1:02:59] that word became manifest then it
[1:03:02] brought light to where there was
[1:03:05] darkness
[1:03:08] notice how the scripture speaks of his
[1:03:10] birth in Luke 2 verse 32 it says alike
[1:03:14] this is this is the this is the coming
[1:03:16] of the Lord Jesus a light to lighten the
[1:03:20] Gentiles lord have mercy
[1:03:24] you mean I couldn't light myself no you
[1:03:27] couldn't like yourself you mean I could
[1:03:30] never be good enough to wear that
[1:03:32] finally when I'm good enough God says
[1:03:34] alright I'll give you the Holy Ghost if
[1:03:36] that was so we would not have needed a
[1:03:38] redeemer
[1:03:39] but our Redeemer came this and now out
[1:03:42] of his side went forth the water out of
[1:03:45] his side went forth the blood and the
[1:03:47] Spirit of God that dwells within him
[1:03:49] that life that lightens you and I it's
[1:03:52] because of him who called us and
[1:03:55] sanctified us and it's him that likes
[1:03:58] you and I am without him we're not able
[1:04:01] to be lived
[1:04:03] don't you reload can't you see it so
[1:04:06] clearly that it must be him to light you
[1:04:10] and I up and he'll always come through
[1:04:13] his word if it's the word in the
[1:04:15] beginning that lit it up in the
[1:04:17] beginning then it's his word that is
[1:04:19] manifest and vindicated that lights
[1:04:22] things up him him a light to lighten the
[1:04:28] Gentiles and the glory of that people
[1:04:33] Israel notice what Jesus says concerning
[1:04:36] his self here John 8:12 then spake Jesus
[1:04:39] again unto them saying I am the light of
[1:04:43] the world he that followeth me shall not
[1:04:46] walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:04:49] light of
[1:04:51] life he that followeth me following him
[1:04:58] was much more than just knowing him in
[1:05:01] his physical journey here I want to
[1:05:04] dwell on that law tonight but it was
[1:05:05] much more than knowing him in his
[1:05:07] physical journey Paul came to a place to
[1:05:09] where could Paul could say I believe
[1:05:10] it's in first Corinthians 5 we
[1:05:12] henceforth we know no man after the
[1:05:14] flesh it comes to a place to where it
[1:05:17] had to know him by divine revelation but
[1:05:20] the promise is following on to know him
[1:05:23] you see friends it isn't God doesn't
[1:05:26] expect you and I to try to figure it out
[1:05:28] he just said follow me follow you yeah
[1:05:31] just put your foot every every place
[1:05:33] that I put my foot you put your foot
[1:05:35] right in that place right there
[1:05:37] but sometimes let me just preach a
[1:05:39] little bit sometimes we're so interested
[1:05:41] in getting to the back of the door it's
[1:05:43] like we want to walk on air to get there
[1:05:45] but he has a pathway there is an order
[1:05:49] to lighting the lamps and it must follow
[1:05:53] the pathway that he has given well I
[1:05:56] know what they used to teach in Sunday
[1:05:58] school and and in my old church or at
[1:06:00] this place you know they said that long
[1:06:02] all you got to do is just believe but
[1:06:04] remember there's more understanding that
[1:06:06] you're responsible for now it's more
[1:06:09] than just looking at those back doors
[1:06:11] and say I believe that's way out of here
[1:06:13] I really do little joy I believe that's
[1:06:14] the way out I believe if I go that way
[1:06:16] I'll get out of here but just believing
[1:06:18] don't get me there I've got to believe
[1:06:21] that that is the way and then I've gotta
[1:06:24] walk in every step that he has laid out
[1:06:27] every stage of grace I must walk in that
[1:06:31] to be called in justification as a dirty
[1:06:34] glass and then sanctified a glass that's
[1:06:37] cleaned up and then filled with the
[1:06:40] Spirit of God I've got to be lit the
[1:06:43] right way in matters there and how you
[1:06:46] light them up there could be a lot of
[1:06:50] errands at home my whole glorious God
[1:06:52] you know they work for people up they
[1:06:54] get them worked up and the Holy Spirit
[1:06:56] yet the Holy Spirit will come right down
[1:06:57] upon their spirit but you see it never
[1:07:00] results in a change life because listen
[1:07:03] to me the world
[1:07:04] goes down and deals with the depths of
[1:07:06] our life the word does not leave us in
[1:07:09] the condition if we are really receiving
[1:07:12] it it does not leave us in a condition
[1:07:15] in a bad condition but the word will
[1:07:17] work in our life it'll push back it'll
[1:07:20] separate the firm it's the word itself
[1:07:23] we'll go to work it'll put everything in
[1:07:25] order just as it ought to be see it's
[1:07:28] God has a precise order amen you love
[1:07:34] him as long as I'm in the world John
[1:07:38] nine five I am the light of the world
[1:07:41] see speaking of his earthly visitation
[1:07:47] in his corporal body as long as I'm here
[1:07:49] I am the light of the world well if you
[1:07:58] are his body then what could you say at
[1:08:02] this time if when he was here in his
[1:08:08] corporal body now if he is here and you
[1:08:11] have been baptized into his mystical
[1:08:14] body right representing here showing
[1:08:18] that body I am identified in that body
[1:08:21] that sacrifice there we are identified
[1:08:24] in his body right now so what is it it
[1:08:27] is ye are light in the heart here he is
[1:08:32] I am the light of the world but pure
[1:08:34] candlestick John 12:46 his purpose I am
[1:08:38] come a light into the world that
[1:08:43] whosoever believeth on me should not
[1:08:45] abide in darkness what child Paul picks
[1:08:48] this up in acts 26 22 Paul here
[1:08:52] testifying before men having therefore
[1:08:56] obtained help of God I continue unto
[1:08:59] this day witnessing both to small and
[1:09:02] great saying none other things than
[1:09:05] those which the prophets and Moses did
[1:09:07] say should come what's Paul saying I'm
[1:09:10] under that same inspiration where the
[1:09:15] candlesticks are lit in a certain way
[1:09:18] I'm in that same inspiration that still
[1:09:21] declares that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:09:25] in that same inspiration that he is the
[1:09:29] candlestick of pure gold
[1:09:32] is that right then what Paul preached
[1:09:35] every promise is yay an amen
[1:09:39] they said before I was with you in
[1:09:41] weakness and trembling which they call
[1:09:45] brother branham the lights the brother
[1:09:46] and will focus on that he says notice
[1:09:48] this great man all the languages he knew
[1:09:51] but yet he said he was in weakness and
[1:09:53] fear and great trembling lest lest it
[1:09:58] would be Paul that would stand before
[1:10:02] him Paul did not want their faith to be
[1:10:06] resting in his flesh Paul wanted their
[1:10:10] faith to be in the power of God you know
[1:10:16] why Paul was truly called of God to
[1:10:19] order it in the right way in that your
[1:10:22] desire even among your children your
[1:10:25] family you know what the confidence
[1:10:26] within your flesh you want the
[1:10:28] confidence in that Jesus is the center
[1:10:31] of this home Jesus is the center model
[1:10:33] even for different ones that you would
[1:10:35] pray for him and God would move upon
[1:10:38] your heart yet with it at all you don't
[1:10:39] want nothing within your flesh but they
[1:10:41] would rest you want it to rest in Jesus
[1:10:45] Christ to be so careful to say no I'm
[1:10:48] just your brother
[1:10:49] I'm just your sister I'm just your daddy
[1:10:52] I'm just your mama but he he he's the
[1:10:58] one you see what I'm saying it's not
[1:11:04] about what we can do even as young
[1:11:06] people when you look at things you look
[1:11:08] at daddy look at mama look at different
[1:11:10] ones around the church and and things
[1:11:12] like that it isn't power and strength it
[1:11:14] is in mind of war tell you what man
[1:11:16] brother Samuel just he can quote the
[1:11:18] scripture it it definitely what it is
[1:11:20] it's Christ and it was something that
[1:11:23] even I can remember back in my own life
[1:11:25] it was a mystery how is this lived
[1:11:30] how do they want to do this but yet I
[1:11:32] wanted to do this how is that it's
[1:11:34] because there's got to be a change
[1:11:38] there's got to be a change in here
[1:11:41] because this man does not pack the
[1:11:43] strength notice what Paul said in acts
[1:11:48] 26 23 continuing of how that he had
[1:11:51] continued with that same inspiration
[1:11:53] that Christ should suffer and that he
[1:11:57] should be the first that should rise
[1:11:59] from the dead Paul even speaking this
[1:12:02] same inspiration Moses and the prophets
[1:12:06] all pointed out how Christ should suffer
[1:12:08] and be the first to rise from the dead
[1:12:11] and should show light unto the people
[1:12:15] and to the Gentiles now let's come back
[1:12:19] here just a few moments Exodus 25 37 and
[1:12:26] thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof
[1:12:30] and they shall light the lamps thereof
[1:12:35] that they may give light over against
[1:12:41] yet so the lighting of these lamps if a
[1:12:48] lamp is truly lit in the right way it
[1:12:51] will give light over against the
[1:12:54] candlestick
[1:12:55] it'll give light over against him who is
[1:12:59] in the middle it will give light it will
[1:13:02] give witness you see it's a witness that
[1:13:05] is given the light whereby the lamp is
[1:13:08] lit gives witness that I am a Christian
[1:13:15] look at what I look at what Zechariah
[1:13:17] seen I think this is just tremendous
[1:13:20] they can't get away from this Zechariah
[1:13:23] for to hear Zechariah taken in a vision
[1:13:26] and he said unto me what see is that I
[1:13:30] said I have looked and I see seven lamps
[1:13:35] is that what he saw first no what did he
[1:13:41] see first and behold a candlestick all
[1:13:46] of gold with a bowl upon the top of it
[1:13:53] and his seven lamps thereon and seven
[1:13:57] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[1:14:00] the top thereof
[1:14:01] so in this vision who desire I see first
[1:14:04] the candlestick so even in the true
[1:14:09] witness who'll is it that is to be
[1:14:12] reflected in shown forth the candlestick
[1:14:14] of pure gold the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:17] because listen friends once the
[1:14:19] revelation of Jesus Christ is so struck
[1:14:22] you'll recognize his lamps when you
[1:14:25] reckon listen because you'll recognize
[1:14:26] that his lamps are his lamps and you
[1:14:30] recognize that his lamps give light and
[1:14:32] substance from him to guide and help us
[1:14:35] on our walk are you with me but it's not
[1:14:39] the lamp first then the candlestick ooh
[1:14:44] now can't I'd only now it's not the lamp
[1:14:48] first than the candlestick
[1:14:49] it's the candlestick and his lamps
[1:14:53] thereof you see friends this is one of
[1:14:58] the main reasons where many people I
[1:15:00] don't say this critically or to demean
[1:15:02] where many have made the mistake they
[1:15:05] have exalted brother Branham first and
[1:15:07] they had exalted him above the Lord
[1:15:09] Jesus Christ they have wanted to make
[1:15:12] people know for sure this is the
[1:15:14] messenger this is the messenger the
[1:15:16] first thing is to get them to Jesus
[1:15:18] Christ if we've got if a real revelation
[1:15:21] burns within our heart then it ought to
[1:15:24] be Christ the candlestick listen if we
[1:15:26] can read the scriptures this is the
[1:15:28] words of the Prophet he said if you can
[1:15:31] read going back to Genesis and you don't
[1:15:34] see Christ in every verse of the Bible
[1:15:39] go back and read it again
[1:15:43] he didn't say keep going the same way
[1:15:46] now the order is wrong it's C Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ that is the whole every true
[1:15:55] messenger that has been down through
[1:15:56] time every believer the whole the whole
[1:15:59] of it is to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:02] just looking at it here even today and
[1:16:04] whatever more over and over you type in
[1:16:06] the very part where brother Graham will
[1:16:08] say it over and over it's not the
[1:16:10] messenger it's not the messenger it's
[1:16:12] the message but yet if we're not careful
[1:16:19] there's other voices that want to
[1:16:22] portray to us and say every ordained
[1:16:25] minister will appoint for people to
[1:16:27] brother branham that's a line devil that
[1:16:30] is not the Spirit of God the Prophet
[1:16:33] himself said time and time again the
[1:16:35] Holy Ghost will always point to Jesus
[1:16:38] Christ but true ministry will always
[1:16:41] he's this as his folks his words will
[1:16:43] always point the people to the finished
[1:16:46] work of Calvary you see what that is
[1:16:48] that's men people messing around and
[1:16:50] they haven't ordered it the right way
[1:16:55] they're ordering in a different way that
[1:16:58] doctor the random appear in Jesus down
[1:17:00] here no that is not the right order
[1:17:04] that's the wrong order Bodrum said to do
[1:17:07] it like that is to make me Antichrist
[1:17:11] but to say that his spirit is anointing
[1:17:14] me then that would be right you see
[1:17:22] because of that way this is where you
[1:17:24] have many people that all of a sudden it
[1:17:26] comes to a stumbling and they've got
[1:17:28] their posts on the internet and this was
[1:17:30] set here and this was said there that's
[1:17:31] nothing but a bunch of chipmunk chatter
[1:17:34] you know I'm saying where people come
[1:17:36] and say hold of the RAM you know he said
[1:17:38] this here and he said that here what is
[1:17:40] it that you're trying to tell us what is
[1:17:43] it that you're trying to say I'm stood
[1:17:45] right here in this church in this
[1:17:47] assembly my daddy did the same thing I'm
[1:17:49] stood right here and I preached those
[1:17:50] things what was that that was chipmunk
[1:17:53] chatter we see that
[1:17:56] we recognize this was a man but it's who
[1:18:00] was portrayed through that vessel any
[1:18:05] man we recognize that it was Christ that
[1:18:08] spoke in this generation and that same
[1:18:12] Christ is speaking here tonight we can't
[1:18:14] help it when we read the message when we
[1:18:17] hear the message it has made this book a
[1:18:20] brand new book to you and I to where
[1:18:23] when we read it all we see is the pure
[1:18:25] candlestick you know that is caught up
[1:18:29] in the same inspiration glory be to God
[1:18:33] we thank God for the prophet in this
[1:18:35] hour God gave him this place but you and
[1:18:38] I have got a position we've got a place
[1:18:40] and we are responsible to see that this
[1:18:44] message who lives out through our lives
[1:18:48] may God help us may God help us to be
[1:18:52] faithful lamps that give light over
[1:18:57] against the candlestick to where when
[1:19:02] people come and they talk to you and
[1:19:03] they ask you what are you I'm a
[1:19:06] Christian yeah I know what church you
[1:19:10] volunteer I belong to the oldest church
[1:19:15] there is what churches that you must be
[1:19:18] Catholic well I'm original but I'm not
[1:19:20] Roman I'm part of that original body of
[1:19:28] Jesus Christ
[1:19:29] okay okay okay but yeah seriously what
[1:19:32] what church are you part of you see what
[1:19:33] it is they're looking at things they're
[1:19:35] seeing the way you're acting how you're
[1:19:37] conducting your life they know there's
[1:19:39] something different about you but your
[1:19:41] position is not in a church it's in
[1:19:45] Jesus Christ and so when they come and
[1:19:49] start talking to you here you start
[1:19:51] talking to him about the word you start
[1:19:53] talking to them about the scriptures
[1:19:54] where do you want to start where would
[1:19:56] you like to you know just let them talk
[1:19:58] and where would you like to talk I'll
[1:19:59] tell you what friends listen this
[1:20:01] message I love my Bible more than I ever
[1:20:03] did every day as I read it I
[1:20:07] to be able to sit down with different
[1:20:09] ones and you can sit there and just talk
[1:20:11] to them through the scriptures
[1:20:13] oh brother Sammy you can do that because
[1:20:15] you're a minister no no it's not just
[1:20:17] cause I'm a minister
[1:20:18] it's where that this light and this word
[1:20:21] it has highlighted Christ throughout
[1:20:23] here is that right
[1:20:26] and we understand listen God reveals to
[1:20:30] you what God has revealed to you don't
[1:20:33] worry that light is to shine through
[1:20:34] your life and yet God doesn't reveal
[1:20:38] things just for us to get built up but
[1:20:40] he's revealing it that it might be lived
[1:20:42] through us and then when some when it
[1:20:44] comes to witness and testify you're not
[1:20:47] speaking about theory you're speaking
[1:20:48] about yourself when you're talking about
[1:20:52] the word you're talking about yourself
[1:20:56] who glory be to God
[1:20:59] and behold with a candlestick of gold
[1:21:02] what did John see John said I heard a
[1:21:06] voice like a trumpet speak unto me he
[1:21:12] said I turned to see the voice that
[1:21:13] spake unto me and being turned I saw
[1:21:17] seven now listen now seven golden
[1:21:21] candlesticks but yet as we continue into
[1:21:26] the next verse and in the midst in the
[1:21:30] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[1:21:35] unto the Son of man he is in the midst
[1:21:39] of every age he walks in the midst of
[1:21:46] the seven golden candlesticks he is the
[1:21:50] centerpiece of every messengers message
[1:21:55] and as he is the centerpiece of every
[1:21:58] messengers message is also the
[1:22:01] centerpiece in the life of every
[1:22:04] believer who receive that light you know
[1:22:12] what a centerpiece is sometimes you know
[1:22:15] they put such great things great
[1:22:17] centerpiece on the table to me the best
[1:22:19] thing outside of flowers be on the table
[1:22:20] I can for
[1:22:21] get the flour just put a big old turkey
[1:22:22] in the middle of it that's a great
[1:22:24] centerpiece for me or you know have a
[1:22:25] calf a cake get rid of the all the fur
[1:22:27] combs and everything else just put one
[1:22:29] of those glass cake covers with a three
[1:22:31] layer chocolate cake with frosting all
[1:22:33] around it put that right there or put an
[1:22:35] apple pie in the middle of it lattice or
[1:22:37] a crumble topping put one of those right
[1:22:40] there in the midst of it but you see
[1:22:43] what it is what does the centerpiece do
[1:22:44] it draws the attraction and everything
[1:22:48] else is just filler it becomes the focus
[1:22:52] it becomes what the eye is glued to it
[1:22:56] what is this and that's the way that
[1:23:00] Jesus Christ is in the life of a
[1:23:04] believer let me read this in closing
[1:23:07] Colossians 3:3 for ye are dead and your
[1:23:15] life is hid with Christ in God when
[1:23:20] Christ who is our life shall appear then
[1:23:26] shall ye also appear with him in glory
[1:23:30] he is our life but the RAM says who
[1:23:36] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:23:38] candlesticks how meaningful are those
[1:23:42] words when viewed in the light of the
[1:23:44] scripture which describes him as Christ
[1:23:47] who is our life for Christ indeed is the
[1:23:51] life of the church she has no other life
[1:23:55] without him she is simply a religious
[1:24:00] Society a club a meaningless gathering
[1:24:04] of the people as a corpse be jeweled and
[1:24:08] rest is still a corpse so the church no
[1:24:13] matter what her programs her gracious
[1:24:15] efforts might achieve without Christ she
[1:24:19] is a corpse also but with him in her
[1:24:25] midst with him motivating her she
[1:24:30] becomes to the wonderment
[1:24:32] of all his body the fullness of him that
[1:24:38] filleth all in all
[1:24:40] do you realize that you are a wonderment
[1:24:43] not just to people around you you are a
[1:24:46] wonderment to the Angels remember the
[1:24:54] scripture I read to a few weeks ago
[1:24:56] where Paul said I think it was when a
[1:24:58] preacher on the dead of love I Oh what
[1:24:59] Paul said that we as apostles were made
[1:25:01] us as a spectacle unto the world that
[1:25:03] word spectacle means as a theater one
[1:25:07] who is acting out apart and here are you
[1:25:11] men here is a humanity that yet there's
[1:25:13] something deeper beyond our humanity
[1:25:16] it's not us acting out with the baptism
[1:25:21] of a Holy Ghost in our life it's Christ
[1:25:23] acting out through our lives down all
[1:25:27] yes sometimes we can get down listen to
[1:25:30] me when you've been born of the Spirit
[1:25:32] of God your soul has been sealed the
[1:25:36] light of the candle in your spirit might
[1:25:38] get blown out you might get down you
[1:25:44] might get discouraged but that flame
[1:25:47] that's seal on the inside
[1:25:49] it can never be removed but God Himself
[1:25:55] will move right down and he'll come down
[1:25:58] and wear a flame in our spirit remember
[1:26:00] the book of Proverbs the spirit of man
[1:26:02] is as a candle it can be blown out but
[1:26:06] God will come right back down and He
[1:26:10] will light our spirit again because we
[1:26:15] get weary sometimes we get down
[1:26:18] her brother bill speak of it right here
[1:26:21] when he was leading songs tests and
[1:26:22] trials and things come our way and it's
[1:26:26] true sometimes it seems like it's been
[1:26:28] it's went out remember the prophets
[1:26:32] standing right there when he said I was
[1:26:33] about ready to say what he was getting
[1:26:35] ready to say but you see the seal
[1:26:38] couldn't be broken the seal could not be
[1:26:42] broken
[1:26:43] and the Spirit of God moving by to
[1:26:46] relight that candle that flame mama and
[1:26:54] this very hour listen to this hears we
[1:26:57] close in this very hour he is walking in
[1:27:01] the midst of the last ages golden
[1:27:06] candlestick it's not all we see him back
[1:27:10] down the beginning no he was the center
[1:27:12] of every age he's the center Center what
[1:27:18] he was as he walked in the first age he
[1:27:22] is even now in the last stage Jesus
[1:27:25] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:27:28] forever he's walking and you know what
[1:27:34] in the beginning the Bible says they
[1:27:37] heard the voice of God walking here he
[1:27:43] was walking how did they know he was
[1:27:44] walking in the midst of him they heard
[1:27:46] his voice his voice he was walking in
[1:27:50] the midst of them he walks in the midst
[1:27:53] of your life he's enthroned in the midst
[1:27:56] of your life
[1:27:57] it isn't that necessarily you're saying
[1:27:59] something out of here but it's a voice
[1:28:02] that's sounding his voice his life is
[1:28:06] sounding out so Christ Christ in our
[1:28:12] lives let's stand our lives has been
[1:28:17] pre-planned
[1:28:19] it's been ordained by God don't you
[1:28:24] think of these it's been ordained by God
[1:28:27] you and I come to this realization and
[1:28:31] yet it's becoming more real to us it
[1:28:36] must become more real to us it must
[1:28:39] become more personal it must become more
[1:28:42] of a substance in our life I want you to
[1:28:47] think of this scripture here let me read
[1:28:48] this I told you I just wanted to read a
[1:28:50] couple more before I close here as I am
[1:28:52] closing
[1:28:55] but no flesh should glory in his
[1:29:00] presence is there anything we can glory
[1:29:04] in I've done this I we haven't done a
[1:29:08] thing it's him but of Hilda are you in
[1:29:14] Christ Jesus who of God he is made unto
[1:29:19] us wisdom what wisdom do we have without
[1:29:22] him we have none he's made unto us
[1:29:26] wisdom righteousness sanctification and
[1:29:31] redemption
[1:29:33] he's my wisdom he's my righteousness
[1:29:37] he's my sanctification he's my
[1:29:40] Redemption he's my all and all that
[1:29:45] according as it is written he that
[1:29:48] glorieth let him glory in the Lord so
[1:29:54] our lives we'll do our lives reflect as
[1:29:57] a believer as a Christian life our lives
[1:30:01] reflect the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:04] it reflects him he is our everything I
[1:30:09] think about it in this hour you and I we
[1:30:14] would have missed it maybe sitting here
[1:30:16] tonight you're not aware of all of these
[1:30:19] things of what God has done but yet
[1:30:21] you're aware of his presence you're
[1:30:23] aware of God speaking personally and
[1:30:26] your life just remember as the Holy
[1:30:28] Spirit is said that he lights the lamps
[1:30:31] in a certain way he had light up your
[1:30:36] life you will never he'll never go over
[1:30:39] your will but he works to bring our will
[1:30:42] in submission to his will and that's the
[1:30:47] same thing in every you can follow that
[1:30:49] pattern in every part of your life if
[1:30:52] God has a pathway for your life you'll
[1:30:55] light it up you may not see at the very
[1:30:58] end of it
[1:30:59] but if you walk in what he's opening up
[1:31:02] to you you'll get to the end
[1:31:05] what he has this is faith is to trust
[1:31:10] him if you don't know him in that way
[1:31:12] what a sublime opportunity to come to
[1:31:16] know him in that way let's bow our heads
[1:31:20] Lord Jesus
[1:31:25] you are the center Lord the center of it
[1:31:29] all Lord Jesus if we've missed that we
[1:31:36] miss everything Lord Jesus I pray
[1:31:42] Heavenly Father Lord in all of our lives
[1:31:47] our decisions everything that we do it
[1:31:52] is to reflect you not just when we talk
[1:31:56] of the word Lord of scriptures quotes
[1:32:00] but every when you our life everything
[1:32:06] it reflects you when you revealed to
[1:32:11] Moses Noah all of them down through time
[1:32:15] what you revealed to them that was
[1:32:18] Christ in that generation those that
[1:32:25] Lord that came under that message that
[1:32:29] was given and become part of that
[1:32:32] revelation they were ordained to be a
[1:32:34] part of it but Lord it was reflected in
[1:32:37] their life Christ the heart the center
[1:32:42] of that revelation because the ark
[1:32:45] itself that spoke of you you were there
[1:32:50] in the center of Noah's message you were
[1:32:54] there in Moses message Lord when we look
[1:32:57] back down through there every decision
[1:32:59] that would have been made Lord when we
[1:33:02] take it in a very simple simplistic way
[1:33:04] about the ark every decision that was
[1:33:07] made would have been about the ark lord
[1:33:13] help us may we Lord look at every
[1:33:17] decision maybe we not make decisions
[1:33:19] lightly
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:21] whether it be positions that we take
[1:33:23] whether it be things that we do lo God
[1:33:27] may we'd not take it lightly but may we
[1:33:31] look and pass everything through and say
[1:33:36] will this hinder the purpose of Christ
[1:33:41] in my life or will it help to further it
[1:33:47] help us Lord Jesus because Lord it's
[1:33:53] that right there that causes us as your
[1:33:57] children to make decisions differently
[1:33:59] many times I'm speaking Lord to some
[1:34:03] that are here some that are not even
[1:34:04] here there's Lord things decisions they
[1:34:07] could have made decisions where some of
[1:34:10] them Lord would have made where they'd
[1:34:12] had never been around a church home
[1:34:13] whatsoever they maybe could have stream
[1:34:17] but they they didn't want that they
[1:34:21] wanted to remain where there's a
[1:34:24] fellowship of believers or to where that
[1:34:28] they turned down positions in a company
[1:34:32] where there could have been more money
[1:34:34] that they could have made but it was
[1:34:37] because you're the center Lord God I
[1:34:43] know there's been decisions that's been
[1:34:45] made all the way across here Lord God
[1:34:49] Lord many that no doubt I'll never know
[1:34:53] we'll never know among one another but
[1:34:55] that's how our lives are lived as
[1:34:57] believers Christ is our life and Lord
[1:35:01] when there's a decision that we've made
[1:35:03] that we say oh this this is infringing
[1:35:08] upon that reflection of Christ nor then
[1:35:13] we quickly coming right back into that
[1:35:15] place of purpose say Lord forgive me
[1:35:19] cleanse me Lord Jesus realign I don't
[1:35:24] want that reflection to be taken away
[1:35:27] but I want Christ to be so reflective
[1:35:32] decisions Lord that are made Oh God let
[1:35:37] it be Lord let it be said Lord Jesus
[1:35:40] from our lives that the decisions that
[1:35:44] we would make let us not make them
[1:35:46] hastily Lord but let us Lord God wait in
[1:35:50] prayer let us look to You Lord God I
[1:35:54] know sometimes the Lord were put on the
[1:35:56] spot sometimes there's a decision that
[1:35:58] we have to make the Lord led us at all
[1:36:01] times not knowing when that decision
[1:36:03] would come
[1:36:04] may we the Lord defer to your choice
[1:36:09] that in all things that Christ would
[1:36:13] remain first reflected fully in our
[1:36:18] lives
[1:36:19] in our families in our homes in this
[1:36:23] assembly Lord God Granite Lord Jesus for
[1:36:28] it matters how the lamps are lit may it
