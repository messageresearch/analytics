[37:18] than the Angels for the suffering of
[37:20] death crowned with glory and honor that
[37:24] he by the grace of God should taste
[37:26] death for every man for it became him

[40:47] speak to Abraham and yet we find and we
[40:50] identify other places in the scripture
[40:53] but not within that could he come and
[40:56] and redeem us but he had to become like
[41:00] we were and so to see how that God is we
[41:04] were looking at some weeks ago the great
[41:06] the great condescension of Almighty God
[41:10] of hound that he condescended to become
[41:13] one of us to in order to bring us back
[41:16] home to where to where he is and we look
[41:20] at this of how that when he is in his
[41:22] earthly pilgrimage as he was here we
[41:26] find that has it was made known John
[41:29] would declare behold the lamb of God
[41:32] which taketh away the sin of the world
[41:34] at that at that present time he had not
[41:37] entered into there had not been an
[41:40] offering up of the Lamb he had not went
[41:42] to Calvary but once going to Calvary to
[41:45] offer up his life and pour out his soul
[41:48] as an offering on our behalf and to take
[41:51] our sins away and to pay that sin doubt
[41:54] and then to think of how that he he
[41:57] raised up there on that third third day
[42:00] and he appeared to the disciples and
[42:03] when he appeared to them remember they
[42:06] were in disarray they did not they were
[42:09] not connecting what had taken place and
[42:11] here he begins to make known to them and
[42:14] gathers them by the promise and he is is
[42:18] is there with them and he makes known to
[42:21] them Here I am going to ascend to the
[42:24] Father and when I ascend to the Father
[42:27] I'm gonna send back the Holy Ghost and
[42:29] to see how that then as he entered into
[42:33] this the mediatorial work and there
[42:35] there in the present office as our high
[42:39] priest he's there on that present office
[42:42] on our behalf and brother Branham would
[42:44] say it like this and I just want to
[42:46] quote this here he refers over into
[42:50] revelations 15 3 where he says they sing
[42:53] the song of Moses the servant of God and
[42:55] the song of the lamb saying great and
[42:58] marvellous are thy works Lord God
[43:00] Almighty just and true are thy ways thou
[43:03] king of saints he says do you see it the
[43:06] lamb the high priest holding his blood
[43:09] as an
[43:10] tone meant on the mercy-seat for our
[43:13] sins is the Lord God Almighty that is
[43:17] his present office that is what he is
[43:20] doing now pleading his blood for our
[43:23] sins but one day that lamb will become
[43:27] the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he
[43:31] will come forth and power and glory and
[43:33] take his authority and to reign as king
[43:35] he's coming he's a coming king of this
[43:38] earth he is the coming king of this
[43:40] earth and he says it does not say that
[43:42] he's not the king now for he is our King
[43:44] king of the Saints right now it is a
[43:47] spiritual Kingdom it's not of this world
[43:50] system even as we're not of this world
[43:52] that's the reason we act different from
[43:55] the world our citizenship is in heaven
[43:58] we reflect the spirit of the world of
[44:01] our rebirth where Jesus is the king that
[44:05] is why our women do not dress in men's
[44:08] clothing or cut their hair or used all
[44:11] those cosmetics and other things that
[44:12] the world likes so much that is why our
[44:15] men don't drink and smoke and carry on
[44:18] in sin our Dominion is the dominion over
[44:21] sin and it is enforced through the power
[44:24] in the Spirit of Christ that dwells in
[44:27] us and we know that every Kingdom on
[44:29] earth is going to be torn down but ours
[44:32] will remain we see that even in the
[44:36] parallel the type of even how Daniel
[44:38] would speak of that that this great
[44:40] stone that smote the image will smite
[44:43] that image we see that that stone itself
[44:46] in just for our lives by the true new
[44:50] birth of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:52] it's mites the hold of the world upon
[44:56] our life and it grows within our life
[44:59] and we see that we see within our lives
[45:02] I want to take here in this place
[45:05] reflections of his present office
[45:07] because when we look at this the Lord
[45:10] Jesus made it clear before he ever went
[45:13] to Calvary he let it be known you know
[45:16] when he was speaking of even the work
[45:18] that he was going to enter into he would
[45:21] tell the disciples and he would
[45:23] speak of what was to be a present and
[45:27] among them in their lives and he says
[45:29] that there should be by this of the love
[45:32] of God between them he says and by this
[45:34] they shall know that you are my
[45:36] disciples indeed and when we look at
[45:39] this scripture we understand it can be
[45:42] made to be something very carnal but yet
[45:46] the reality is it is that the love of
[45:49] God by the Holy Spirit in our life it
[45:53] brings us into that place to where that
[45:56] our life has changed and we have a
[45:58] desire to please the Lord and we look
[46:02] even to where that with that pulsing in
[46:06] our lives we see the value not to allow
[46:09] anything to remain in our life as God
[46:12] brings it to our attention or to allow
[46:14] things to come between us between
[46:16] brothers or sisters or what have you
[46:18] it's the love of God working and jesus
[46:21] said when they see this then they know
[46:25] you're my disciples and I believe that
[46:28] that is a that is a declaration because
[46:30] though that men and others cannot see
[46:34] him but yet what they see is a reality
[46:38] and should see a reality of a Living God
[46:42] being reflected in our life when we
[46:45] think of that of how that we are to see
[46:48] him brother Branham would say it like
[46:50] this he says when he says we see him he
[46:53] says as he is opening himself in the
[46:56] word he said and then he says I look he
[46:58] says as the word is going forth I see
[47:01] you taking that word in he said and then
[47:04] that life that word in moving in your
[47:07] life he says then he says I'm seeing him
[47:10] being reflected through your life so it
[47:14] is a life of Christ to this be reflected
[47:17] and when you think of that term
[47:19] reflection we realize that it is not our
[47:22] light but it is Christ the Lord Jesus
[47:26] who is our light we have no light of our
[47:30] own but yet by God's grace we have
[47:33] within us the ability not our ability
[47:36] but by that seed of God on the inside to
[47:41] be able to reflect Christ who he is in
[47:45] this generation and so it is something
[47:48] that will catch that you know it's like
[47:50] a signal in this room there's a signal
[47:53] that goes from this little transmitter
[47:55] that I have and it goes over there to
[47:57] that receiver you don't see that signal
[48:00] and but yet you know there is something
[48:03] that is taking place because you are
[48:06] hearing it in your ears you don't see it
[48:09] but you hear it and that's the same
[48:12] thing when we look at God Himself is a
[48:15] spirit and God Himself is invisible but
[48:20] God makes himself known and reflects
[48:24] himself through visible forms it's it's
[48:27] God in morphe it's God reflecting
[48:30] himself and remember when he reflects
[48:33] himself it cannot just reflect something
[48:36] of just what he was but it must reflect
[48:39] what he is and whatever he is will also
[48:43] identify what he was you see it's an
[48:46] advancement of that life and so this is
[48:49] where when we look at this in the
[48:51] scripture a reflection of his present
[48:54] office to recognize that through the
[48:56] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we have
[48:59] been brought in and made co-workers in
[49:01] Redemption with him there is one
[49:04] objective and I want you to think of
[49:05] this there's one objective that the Lord
[49:08] Jesus Christ that here God coming to
[49:10] this earth there's one objective that he
[49:13] had he said the Son of Man is come to
[49:15] seek and save that which is lost that
[49:18] was the objective there was anything
[49:21] else there was no other objective but
[49:23] along the way in that objective we find
[49:27] out that how they were sick that were
[49:29] healed does that right Devils were cast
[49:32] out all of the many things that were
[49:34] there to vindicate the Living God was
[49:38] present and how that he manifests
[49:40] himself as the true sacrifice the true
[49:44] atonement and then
[49:45] to see how that in the outpouring of the
[49:48] Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost that
[49:51] in itself the coming of the Holy Ghost
[49:53] is a witness that he is now seated on
[49:57] the throne of God that he indeed is our
[50:00] mediator and that there is a mediatorial
[50:03] ship to where he is going to make good
[50:06] upon the promises in other words it's
[50:08] like when you know electricity is
[50:10] flowing in this building but yet in a
[50:13] certain outlet you are not able to get
[50:15] power yet you know there's power coming
[50:17] into this building but there must be
[50:19] something that is able to take care of
[50:21] the short there's got to be something
[50:23] that's able to cause the circuit to come
[50:26] back together that that life or that
[50:29] electricity can flow and that's the same
[50:31] way it is with the son and daughter of
[50:33] God without the baptism of the Holy
[50:36] Ghost it's like a dead socket but you
[50:39] need to have that energized by the
[50:41] Spirit of God but you cannot do it I
[50:44] cannot do it but there is one who
[50:46] already stood in the gap for you and I
[50:49] there is a mediator there on the throne
[50:51] who by God's grace was able here to be
[50:55] able to fill that gap to take away that
[50:58] breach and to manifest when the baptism
[51:01] of the Holy Ghost comes upon your life
[51:03] that is the consummating of the breach
[51:06] of your life you're tied right back into
[51:10] his mind as you were in the beginning
[51:13] and this is why that when we look at
[51:15] this there is a reflection of the
[51:18] present office of the high priests that
[51:21] indeed he is there and is all-powerful
[51:24] you believe that so when we find this
[51:27] appalled would you know in these
[51:29] scriptures Paul dealing and pulling from
[51:32] Psalms 22 and Paul would it would
[51:34] express here but we see Jesus and Paul
[51:38] would would find it when you look in
[51:41] them in the book of Hebrews you'll find
[51:43] it in other places but Paul here the
[51:45] revelation has been known of how that
[51:47] God the Lord God Almighty became one of
[51:51] us and took upon the likeness of sinful
[51:54] flesh you'll find Paul bring
[51:56] this to you and I Paul will lay out so
[51:58] clearly in the Hebrews in the Hebrews a
[52:01] book there of the media toriel work of
[52:04] that working of the high priest and when
[52:07] we we think of it that in this great
[52:10] working of how that we see Jesus and he
[52:14] he became the example one you know he's
[52:18] the reflection but the remm said like
[52:20] this in the indictment he's the example
[52:22] son of what God intends every son and
[52:25] daughter of God to be to think that he
[52:28] he adorned himself in that same kind of
[52:31] a garment and then to look at how that
[52:34] within it you know how that he himself
[52:36] was able to bring to us of the access
[52:40] that you and I though all his sons and
[52:42] daughters of God but yet he brings the
[52:45] access that we might be recognized as
[52:48] sons and daughters of God you recognize
[52:50] that a person can live and may be right
[52:53] out on a barstool there are a son and
[52:54] daughter of God but they have not been
[52:57] quickened you with me future home you
[53:00] were always saved you see the reality
[53:03] your destiny has the son and daughter of
[53:05] God
[53:06] was never in question you understand God
[53:11] himself all the dead the destiny was
[53:14] already set in God and the pathways and
[53:17] whatever that came about but yet he
[53:19] himself had to move and raise up that
[53:23] son and daughter on the inside in order
[53:25] for you and I'd to be recognized as a
[53:28] son and daughter of God because you
[53:29] couldn't say as a son and daughter of
[53:31] God and drinking and smoking and running
[53:33] around and living like the world
[53:35] dressing like the world you could not
[53:36] call yourself a son and daughter of God
[53:38] you might you know you might say it but
[53:40] you see underneath this word you know
[53:42] there is not an authority in your life
[53:45] now you might look at it this morning
[53:46] and let me just preach to you for a
[53:48] moment you might look at and say well I
[53:50] want it but are you willing to get rid
[53:51] and
[53:53] your life down because if you're not
[53:55] willing to lay your life down then God's
[53:57] not gonna move any further but if you're
[53:59] willing to lay your life down you say
[54:01] what are you talking about
[54:02] your selfishness of everything and lay
[54:05] it down and allow God to move on the
[54:08] scene and be gone if you allow him to do
[54:12] that he will manifest his present office
[54:16] to you and then you become a reflection
[54:19] of the press and office of the high
[54:21] threes that indeed there is a mediator
[54:24] there is a lamb that has taken care of
[54:26] my sins there is one who is able to lift
[54:30] me above a life of sin they men so to
[54:37] see this within it
[54:39] brother Randall's in here and I want to
[54:41] just kind of keep this here and bringing
[54:43] this moving it back and forth in the
[54:45] message that out of the Simonian church
[54:47] age brother brems says his purpose now
[54:49] he breaks over into tests and trials his
[54:52] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[54:54] while we would be made perfect be
[54:57] established strengthened and settled I
[55:00] want you to keep in mind this perfect is
[55:03] not talking about your soul I hope you
[55:07] all want seem to be very clear with this
[55:08] this perfect is not talking about our
[55:12] soul his blood took care of that and the
[55:17] life coming back to you and I let me
[55:19] tell you something when that life
[55:21] strikes a son and daughter of God it's
[55:23] not one day I'm gonna be a son and
[55:26] daughter of God we are fully adopted
[55:28] sons and daughters of God when we have
[55:31] been born again of the Spirit of God in
[55:33] other words God ain't given a teaspoon
[55:35] and saying I wonder if you'll be a good
[55:36] boy or girl good girl
[55:37] and I'll give you a little bit more
[55:38] that's not how it works you say is there
[55:43] a maturing there is a maturing but that
[55:46] maturing comes where you operate in the
[55:50] authority that the father has placed in
[55:53] your life has a fully adopted son and
[55:57] daughter of God I wish I could preach on
[56:00] that a little bit
[56:02] but that perfect there it's dealing with
[56:05] a completion within our life it's
[56:08] dealing with all of these things that
[56:10] you and I are going through the tests
[56:12] and trials that we go through even now
[56:15] it's God molding and shaping our lives
[56:19] and he's bringing out of our lives I
[56:22] tell you we God brings out of our life
[56:25] great compassion Lord Ram goes on to say
[56:34] his job said he puts strength in us in
[56:37] that tremendous through tests and trials
[56:40] this is how God puts in strength so this
[56:45] is God's way he says he goes on to say
[56:48] he said now you see he himself suffered
[56:51] he learned obedience by the things that
[56:54] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[56:57] by the things that he suffered he goes
[56:59] into Hebrews five and eight nine though
[57:02] he were a son yet learned he obedience
[57:04] by the things which he suffered and
[57:08] being made perfect he became the author
[57:11] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[57:15] obey Him Lorain whitsel like this he
[57:18] says in plain language the very
[57:21] character of Jesus was perfected by
[57:24] suffering and according to Paul he has
[57:28] left his church a measure of suffering
[57:30] that they - by their faith in God while
[57:33] suffering for him would come to a place
[57:35] of perfection he's talking about a
[57:38] completion without dwelling on this this
[57:43] morning but the random deals with Hal he
[57:46] says the success of my ministry has been
[57:49] able when I've been able to enter into
[57:53] the feeling of that one I'm praying for
[57:56] and sympathize with them he said then
[58:00] God comes on the scene and brother
[58:04] Branham would say it like this in
[58:05] another place these are just a little
[58:06] tidbits to drop in here brother Graham
[58:09] talks about a mother who she felt led of
[58:12] the Lord to pray for a baby
[58:15] and she said well you know brother brems
[58:17] here I'm not gonna pray for the baby and
[58:19] so forth but she can't get away from
[58:20] that burden and so she prays for that
[58:23] little baby and then brother bream said
[58:25] here when they come on the platform the
[58:27] Prophet bun denieth the inspiration the
[58:29] Holy Ghost calls it out and said you
[58:31] know your baby had this and this and
[58:33] this but God's already healed it
[58:34] he said when that woman that sister
[58:36] prayed for it and brother I've said it
[58:38] just like this he said see what it is
[58:39] that mother would have had more
[58:41] compassion on that situation that I ever
[58:44] could have got to what is God doing it's
[58:49] a body it's a body he you see God used
[58:55] that situation would not have heard the
[58:57] pear the prayer of the prophet he would
[58:59] have but you see God moved on the scene
[59:02] were put that burden on that sister's
[59:04] heart and she entered in in prayer and
[59:07] God answered that prayer mine so when we
[59:10] look at this you know that sonship and
[59:13] we find the tests and trials you know
[59:15] when we go through the tests and trials
[59:17] brother Graham says what we actually
[59:19] come out with we have passed in through
[59:21] schools of suffering and you know when
[59:24] we come through and in these areas here
[59:26] you look at the Lord Jesus Christ of how
[59:28] that God we said it here some weeks ago
[59:30] he could have went straight to Calvary
[59:32] but you see he would have never had the
[59:35] understanding that came with all of the
[59:38] suffering the Bible didn't say that the
[59:40] captain of our salvation would be made
[59:42] perfect through suffering it said
[59:44] through sufferings so there were
[59:46] multiple ones brother Branham told us he
[59:48] said he went through and knows what it's
[59:50] like to feel ignored right all the all
[59:54] these things that you and I would look
[59:56] over and say well mile the King of glory
[59:58] he would need to experience that
[1:00:00] evidently he needed to experience it he
[1:00:03] experienced all of these things not for
[1:00:05] the people out there but that was for
[1:00:07] you and I aren't you glad about it you
[1:00:16] see when we looked at it being the son
[1:00:18] his sonship did not exempt him from
[1:00:22] suffering
[1:00:25] it didn't exempt him as a matter of fact
[1:00:28] the position of which he was to fulfill
[1:00:30] the captain of our salvation required
[1:00:33] this to think of how that you know when
[1:00:40] you look it's a necessary completing he
[1:00:43] he suffered he there was a great
[1:00:45] suffering for us but then we find
[1:00:48] through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:51] that through these sufferings that was a
[1:00:54] perfecting as we just read of the very
[1:00:56] character of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:00:59] when we we think of this within looking
[1:01:01] at it I want you to think of it here if
[1:01:04] we could just transport back to the
[1:01:06] Garden of Eden and you find that this
[1:01:08] lovely couple were there within God's
[1:01:11] God's Eden there with a perfect
[1:01:14] understanding of the love of God there
[1:01:16] was no fear around there wasn't any
[1:01:19] torment there there wasn't anything of
[1:01:21] that nature but to see how that when we
[1:01:24] know that day in and day out that how
[1:01:27] that you know Satan would have pressed
[1:01:30] upon Eve in that of a serpent you know
[1:01:32] friends she could have ended that battle
[1:01:35] if she just would have taken it right to
[1:01:38] the word now I'm not going to say and I
[1:01:42] think you would agree with me we
[1:01:43] recognize that I don't believe that
[1:01:45] Genesis 3 was just a one-day event how
[1:01:49] long he pressed on her I don't know come
[1:01:53] on somebody because you know that then
[1:01:55] remember Potiphar's wife the bible says
[1:01:57] she pressed upon joseph remember look at
[1:02:02] Delilah
[1:02:03] the Bible says she pressed upon Samson
[1:02:06] so there was pressing upon now now when
[1:02:10] we go back to the Garden of Eden there's
[1:02:11] not been a fall yet but to think how
[1:02:13] that things begin to drop in upon Eve
[1:02:16] and to think how that things begin to
[1:02:18] get stirred to where that she begins to
[1:02:21] desire what Satan is actually presenting
[1:02:25] to her there is a measure in that of
[1:02:29] suffering but yet she doesn't know what
[1:02:32] it really is to suffer Satan is
[1:02:35] presenting to her there
[1:02:36] something you don't know about so right
[1:02:40] and then we find if if it would have
[1:02:43] just been brought back to the word there
[1:02:48] weren't a Beneful it's you know it comes
[1:02:54] down to that reality it's got to come
[1:02:57] back to the word that's why the
[1:02:58] scripture would tell you and I cast down
[1:03:01] imaginations cast down reasonings and it
[1:03:05] says that we are to bring every thought
[1:03:08] and to obedience of Christ and when we
[1:03:15] look at this the effect of suffering if
[1:03:18] there's a purifying remember the the
[1:03:21] Word of God teaches us that suffering is
[1:03:23] a purifying it's a purging
[1:03:27] now look here in 2nd Corinthians 1 I'm
[1:03:31] just going to move through this quickly
[1:03:32] in 2nd Corinthians 1 verse 3 through
[1:03:35] verse 7
[1:03:36] Paul says blessed be God even the father
[1:03:38] of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[1:03:40] mercies and the God of all comfort who
[1:03:43] comforted us in all our tribulation that
[1:03:46] we may be able to comfort them which are
[1:03:50] in any trouble by the comfort wherewith
[1:03:52] we ourselves are comforted of God so
[1:03:57] here Paul goes on to say for as the
[1:04:00] sufferings of Christ abound in us so our
[1:04:03] consolation also aboundeth by Christ and
[1:04:09] he goes on whether we're afflicted it's
[1:04:11] for your consolation and salvation which
[1:04:14] is effectual I want you to catch this
[1:04:16] phrase which is effectual in the
[1:04:18] enduring of the same sufferings which we
[1:04:22] suffer or whether we be comforted it is
[1:04:25] for your consolation and salvation and
[1:04:27] our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[1:04:30] that as you are partakers of the
[1:04:32] suffering so shall you be also of the
[1:04:36] consolation the infection enduring to
[1:04:38] think of this here here you have the
[1:04:42] apostle the prophet there of that age
[1:04:44] and here he is declaring there
[1:04:47] to the people of God the believers that
[1:04:50] we and ourselves are going through
[1:04:54] tribulation but in your hearing of how
[1:04:58] that we have gone through tribulation
[1:05:00] then you are comforted I want you to
[1:05:03] think of this if there is something if
[1:05:05] Paul listen to me now if Paul would have
[1:05:07] not been able to stand the test you know
[1:05:10] what that would have done to the gospel
[1:05:11] he was preaching you see this is what
[1:05:14] credentials is a whole lot more than
[1:05:16] what a man says it's what he lives its
[1:05:20] credentials here so Paul remember here
[1:05:23] when you begin to recognize Paul is
[1:05:26] noticing and knows that what God is
[1:05:29] doing through his life that it actually
[1:05:31] brings comfort to the believers to know
[1:05:34] I'm not alone because you know the devil
[1:05:37] will many times try to single out and
[1:05:39] make you think you're all alone but you
[1:05:42] recognize that even how God would allow
[1:05:45] in in humility that the Prophet would
[1:05:47] even speak of him many of his
[1:05:48] shortcomings and tests and trials and
[1:05:50] other things it would speak to you and I
[1:05:53] water
[1:05:53] what a glorious message that God has
[1:05:55] given to us and we can also look at the
[1:05:58] character here that that brought that
[1:06:00] and we look and see that God's grace
[1:06:03] indeed is sufficient you know when you
[1:06:05] think about testimonies when we give
[1:06:07] testimonies here within the church those
[1:06:09] testimonies it's not just you know
[1:06:11] something off out of the way but you
[1:06:14] don't know sometimes at that testimony
[1:06:16] when you've given that there might be
[1:06:18] somebody sitting right here there might
[1:06:20] be some of this streaming out there but
[1:06:22] it is going to help and encourage the
[1:06:25] rest of the body that's God's Way it's
[1:06:31] God's Way of comforting one another did
[1:06:36] not Paul said we look back and we take
[1:06:38] these things for our in samples they are
[1:06:40] examples to you and I now to think of
[1:06:43] this in first Peter chapter 5 just in
[1:06:45] referencing this how that Peter would
[1:06:48] speak about the great roaring lion but
[1:06:51] remember he got his teeth pulled out and
[1:06:52] he links the devil as a roaring lion
[1:06:55] walketh about seeking whom
[1:06:58] he may devour now the Bible goes on to
[1:07:01] say whom resist steadfast in the faith
[1:07:05] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:07:09] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:07:11] in the world in other words you have
[1:07:15] there is a steadfastness of faith in
[1:07:17] Christ but in also knowing that there
[1:07:21] are others who are also facing the same
[1:07:25] battles this is comforting because it
[1:07:31] brings us to a place where we recognize
[1:07:34] that God is God we believe that God is
[1:07:37] in control but you see what it does it
[1:07:39] breaks down any statements that the old
[1:07:41] lugar man wants to make that is though
[1:07:42] that you're off off on your own it's a
[1:07:48] comfort to you and I I don't know about
[1:07:53] you but that's what makes this message
[1:07:55] so great I know there's some people who
[1:07:57] well you know we got to cover this what
[1:07:59] do we got to cover up this message is
[1:08:01] not highlighting any man the Bible
[1:08:05] doesn't highlight man that's why it's
[1:08:06] not a book of man if this message was a
[1:08:10] man it would highlight man but this
[1:08:13] message is not there's not the
[1:08:15] highlighting of of a man it is the
[1:08:17] revealing of Jesus Christ himself in his
[1:08:21] supreme deity and authority back in the
[1:08:24] church and God lets us see the frailty
[1:08:28] and the weakness of humanity glory be to
[1:08:34] God now the think of this here James 5
[1:08:38] verse 10 through 11 take my brethren the
[1:08:41] prophets who have spoken in the name of
[1:08:44] the Lord for an example of suffering
[1:08:46] affliction and of patient how many are
[1:08:48] thankful for those examples I am in
[1:08:53] evidently Paul or James Sina right here
[1:08:55] take for example my brethren for an
[1:08:59] example notice verse 11 behold we count
[1:09:03] them happy which endure ye have heard of
[1:09:07] the patience of Job and have seen I want
[1:09:10] you to catch this and
[1:09:11] seen the end of the Lord that the Lord
[1:09:15] is very pitiful and of a tender mercy
[1:09:19] now remember here this is back in the
[1:09:22] Old Testament Joe being the oldest book
[1:09:24] in the Bible but yet noticing even
[1:09:28] though that redemption itself were God
[1:09:31] becoming one of us taking on a body of
[1:09:34] smade in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:09:35] even though that that has not taken
[1:09:37] place but yet God himself if we could
[1:09:40] say like this he was the very high
[1:09:42] priest of job's faith you with me he was
[1:09:48] the very hybrid you say how could he be
[1:09:50] high priest in time remember now he
[1:09:52] revealed himself to Abraham as
[1:09:55] Melchizedek that King and priest of the
[1:09:59] Most High God is that right he already
[1:10:02] revealed himself this is who he is so
[1:10:05] now when job's Trials come remember here
[1:10:09] Ella who first visits him and then you
[1:10:12] find it how that the Lord would speak to
[1:10:15] him veiled in the whirlwind and God
[1:10:18] would take things and speak to job that
[1:10:21] are very very simple things that you and
[1:10:24] I step over and when I say simple
[1:10:26] there's no way you can explain it such
[1:10:29] as where God would take him and ask him
[1:10:31] to know do you understand about how the
[1:10:33] frost is formed do you know who it is
[1:10:36] that causes the water spouts in the
[1:10:38] heavens do you understand all this you
[1:10:40] see what he's doing he is overwhelming
[1:10:43] job that all these things are taking
[1:10:48] place without your help
[1:10:52] you got to remember what he's come to
[1:10:54] that because job by the conversation
[1:10:57] he's been around job has drifted from
[1:11:02] the faith that he had in the sacrifice I
[1:11:04] know that's a big statement but job has
[1:11:06] drifted you say how did he drift look
[1:11:09] how job in the very midst of that book
[1:11:11] begins to try to justify himself in the
[1:11:15] midst of his so-called friends or
[1:11:17] accusers I tell you it matters who you
[1:11:19] hang around it matters what you listen
[1:11:21] to
[1:11:22] are you with me it's just like here we
[1:11:25] were dealing with music
[1:11:26] it matters what kind of music you listen
[1:11:28] to there's a lot of sums that's been
[1:11:30] wrote hey there's wonderful praise and
[1:11:31] worship songs but there's a lot of songs
[1:11:33] whether it's gospel or whatever more
[1:11:35] that's been wrote that has no bit of
[1:11:37] victory in it whatsoever it is nothing
[1:11:40] but a defeatist attitude of where they
[1:11:43] can't live in overcoming life that don't
[1:11:45] belong in the house of God because we
[1:11:47] don't know the Lord Jesus Christ in that
[1:11:49] way we know him in supreme deity and
[1:11:52] power we know him as the resurrected one
[1:11:55] he is an overcomer and manifest his
[1:11:58] overcoming life in us so to think of how
[1:12:01] that jeer in the midst of the time of
[1:12:03] Joe when job's faith itself would drift
[1:12:06] notice how God comes on the scene and he
[1:12:09] begins to speak to Jobin let job know I
[1:12:11] have all of these things on control and
[1:12:14] so do I have your life under control
[1:12:16] because you don't know it but I'm the
[1:12:19] one who asked Satan to consider you our
[1:12:24] thought lines probably about we would
[1:12:26] say Lord don't mention my name just I'm
[1:12:31] okay you know just I'm just okay just
[1:12:33] being one of yours but you see God
[1:12:37] coming on the scene through simplicity
[1:12:39] is able to yoke joke back to the faith
[1:12:43] that's residing in him that's residing
[1:12:46] in the sacrifice that he might continue
[1:12:49] on now when we look at this in the
[1:12:51] scriptures here in Hebrews chapter 2
[1:12:54] verse 16 if we continue he says Paul
[1:12:57] goes on to say for verily he took not on
[1:12:59] him the nature of angels but he took on
[1:13:02] him the seed of Abraham wherefore in all
[1:13:06] things it behooves him to be made like
[1:13:10] unto his brethren that he might be a
[1:13:14] merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:13:17] things pertaining to God don't let that
[1:13:21] drift from your heart
[1:13:22] he's of that he might be a merciful and
[1:13:26] faithful high priest in things
[1:13:28] pertaining to God
[1:13:34] this is his present office and that
[1:13:37] present office is reflected here on
[1:13:40] earth through his body when they walked
[1:13:47] out on the day of Pentecost they had
[1:13:50] that same life dog the true atonement in
[1:13:54] them and when they walked out of there
[1:13:59] they asked them what must we do to be
[1:14:02] saved Peter took them back and he
[1:14:06] identifies the coming of the Lord as the
[1:14:08] true atonement and then they asked him
[1:14:11] what must we do to be safe and now the
[1:14:15] way that's been open repent and be
[1:14:17] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:14:20] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:14:22] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:14:28] going to tell you if you ain't got no
[1:14:30] further and you find yourself not going
[1:14:32] any further then you need to ask
[1:14:34] yourself the question where are you
[1:14:36] sitting now you see you yield as God
[1:14:42] deals with your life you got to keep
[1:14:44] yielding if you don't keep yielding and
[1:14:46] walking on with God and keep giving your
[1:14:49] life to the Lord
[1:14:50] yep telling you what your days will be
[1:14:52] numbered right here I'm not talking
[1:14:54] about taking you off this earth I'm
[1:14:56] talking about that it's got to be a
[1:14:58] faith that comes down on the inside just
[1:15:03] coming to the church just being
[1:15:04] associated with a message is not
[1:15:07] powerful you gotta have that life of the
[1:15:12] truth helmet dwelling inside of you and
[1:15:15] then it reflects that he is indeed the
[1:15:18] mediator because the life gives witness
[1:15:21] that indeed the debt has been paid the
[1:15:24] same question settled in me and I am a
[1:15:26] reflection of that Living God so here it
[1:15:33] behooves him you say it was a virgin
[1:15:38] body it was but that virgin body made in
[1:15:43] the likeness of sinful flesh it was not
[1:15:46] something that
[1:15:47] came from between Joseph and Mary is
[1:15:49] that right but neither could he have
[1:15:52] went to Calvary in just as he stepped
[1:15:56] and revealed himself to Abraham couldn't
[1:15:58] go that way he had to come through the
[1:16:01] woman why he's redeeming he's claiming
[1:16:05] back what was lost so he hast he has to
[1:16:13] redeem that way in order to bring us
[1:16:17] back now what's this in things
[1:16:18] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:16:20] for the sins of the people for him that
[1:16:23] he himself have suffered being tempted
[1:16:27] he is able to secure them that are
[1:16:31] tempted now we understand this wasn't an
[1:16:35] act this was not an act he was tempted
[1:16:41] he suffered suffered means vexed to
[1:16:46] undergo a sensible experience and in
[1:16:49] that he suffered now notice what look at
[1:16:51] look at this in that he suffered now now
[1:16:55] it gives him what the ability to do what
[1:16:58] Sukkur come to the help or aid
[1:17:06] this is sicker come to the help or the
[1:17:09] aid of no glory
[1:17:13] in other words Jesus don't give us sugar
[1:17:15] pills for our needs he gives us what we
[1:17:18] need and where we're lacking that's how
[1:17:20] he's able to secure us to help us notice
[1:17:24] for the RAM goes into this here in the
[1:17:26] Hebrew series he says Sakr means to
[1:17:29] sympathize that's the reason he become
[1:17:33] this that he might be sympathetic with
[1:17:37] you who are you have your ups and downs
[1:17:41] your little ins and outs and your
[1:17:44] temptations get so great you can't
[1:17:47] hardly stand it he knows how to
[1:17:49] sympathize with you now you realize
[1:17:52] there's a difference between sympathy
[1:17:53] and empathy empathy means that I don't
[1:17:57] share the same feelings but I'm able to
[1:18:00] say ma that's at
[1:18:01] got to be hard brother but sympathy
[1:18:03] means I know what you're feeling I know
[1:18:07] what you're feeling this is what
[1:18:09] sympathy is it's it's different but yet
[1:18:11] there is a sympathy and there is an
[1:18:13] empathy now notice how brother Ram would
[1:18:15] take this word he knows how to
[1:18:17] sympathize with you now who is this this
[1:18:19] is the Lord of glory the same God who
[1:18:24] spoke in the beginning let there be and
[1:18:27] it was this is the same God who sent the
[1:18:31] very the very stars the very planets
[1:18:34] it's the same Almighty God here now
[1:18:37] dwelling in a robe of flesh
[1:18:40] don't lose that now it's that same deity
[1:18:44] that was there in the beginning now God
[1:18:46] come down and become one of us the god
[1:18:49] notice all-powerful dwelling there
[1:18:52] behind that veil of skin no wonder the
[1:18:59] scripture would say in Philippians 2 he
[1:19:01] made himself of no reputation he could
[1:19:05] have but he didn't he come in such
[1:19:10] simplicity to where the people missed
[1:19:13] him that overlooked him he came listen
[1:19:19] without bearing you know sometimes a
[1:19:21] person can have you know this particular
[1:19:23] person their name out there and when
[1:19:25] their name is put out then there is a
[1:19:26] reputation that kind of goes before them
[1:19:28] but here when God came down and took
[1:19:31] upon a human name for redemption Jesus
[1:19:34] here God comes down and noticed his name
[1:19:37] is manifested now is going to be
[1:19:40] manifested in power and glory through
[1:19:43] Redemption here is he said I've come in
[1:19:44] my father's name here is a manifestation
[1:19:47] of that life that is actually being
[1:19:50] manifested through the very life of the
[1:19:53] Lord Jesus Christ so here there is a
[1:19:55] reputation he's you know what we look at
[1:19:57] when we see the Lord Jesus Christ what
[1:20:00] you and I can see is that it's the same
[1:20:03] Jehovah God of the Old Testament is
[1:20:06] Jesus Christ of the new
[1:20:09] he didn't lose any power his nature
[1:20:12] didn't change but God became one of us
[1:20:19] hmm
[1:20:20] my the salmon let's talk about the glory
[1:20:26] and the honor he received but wait a
[1:20:29] minute
[1:20:29] this was before glory and honor and it's
[1:20:32] the same way in our lives
[1:20:34] testing trying all of this is before
[1:20:37] glory and honor it's proving notice he
[1:20:42] knows how to sympathize with you he sits
[1:20:45] there to make intercession he sets there
[1:20:48] to love you and though you go astray he
[1:20:51] won't forsake you he will still come
[1:20:54] after you and knock at your heart
[1:20:56] there's not a bats ladder in the
[1:20:58] building but what knows that God knocks
[1:21:00] at his heart daily and he will do it as
[1:21:03] long as you're immortal
[1:21:05] on this earth for he's loved you he
[1:21:07] redeems you he will not lose one but let
[1:21:19] me just also put a cliff note in here
[1:21:22] that does not mean that you can do
[1:21:24] whatever you want to do because if you
[1:21:26] still have that fault line at home ah
[1:21:28] I'll tell you right now you're not where
[1:21:30] you need to be under the blood and I
[1:21:31] doubt to where the dogs even dealing
[1:21:33] right now with you the way you ought to
[1:21:35] be but let me put you to and point you
[1:21:37] to this really in a real way there is a
[1:21:39] real hell I said there is a real hell or
[1:21:45] better Santa I believe this message but
[1:21:47] is this message the life of Jesus Christ
[1:21:51] identified in you that's the question
[1:21:55] not just being associated guarantees no
[1:21:59] sir it's not just being around open Sam
[1:22:01] you know I want to but if you're want to
[1:22:03] it's got to be a surrender I'm talking
[1:22:08] about his prison office now we're not
[1:22:10] talking about a high priest who walks
[1:22:12] around with dainty's and you know it's
[1:22:14] just walking around with teaspoons of
[1:22:16] sugar and spinning out you know little
[1:22:18] cube
[1:22:18] Elsa we're talking about a God who had
[1:22:21] manifested himself in power where he
[1:22:24] said be of good cheer for I have
[1:22:26] overcome the world glory be to God
[1:22:32] let's qualify this statement for a
[1:22:35] moment there's not a backslider in the
[1:22:38] building one knows God nuts at your
[1:22:40] heart you recognize brother Rama he'll
[1:22:46] go on and tell us here and I understand
[1:22:49] there could be a backsliding I'm getting
[1:22:51] cold even of a person brother man goes
[1:22:53] through this and took in many other
[1:22:54] places in that even when being born of
[1:22:56] the Spirit of God you can get cold
[1:22:59] that's backsliding it's not my words
[1:23:03] that's his you can get cold where you
[1:23:06] know where you're not giving yourself to
[1:23:08] the Lord
[1:23:09] lock you off to you're not praying
[1:23:11] you're not reading and then again maybe
[1:23:13] you're praying in your reading but yet
[1:23:15] the attitude itself is preventing the
[1:23:17] nutrients of the word from making it
[1:23:19] down in your life come on somebody it's
[1:23:22] kind of come deep in here we've got to
[1:23:25] reflect his present office amen it's got
[1:23:29] to be a real reflection of that life but
[1:23:33] you see it can also be when a person God
[1:23:36] has touched their life but yet they
[1:23:38] never came to a place of a real true
[1:23:40] conversion having a real birth in their
[1:23:43] life and they drift away brother BAM
[1:23:45] said the prodigal son was a backslider
[1:23:48] so you now want you to say take this in
[1:23:51] for a moment
[1:23:52] there's times where you can see people
[1:23:55] you can see brothers and sisters you can
[1:23:57] see different ones maybe it's husband or
[1:23:59] wife or whatever you can sometimes see
[1:24:01] things and coldness you can feel it in
[1:24:03] your own life and there's a battle
[1:24:05] against that there's all sorts of things
[1:24:07] to try to take away our attention and to
[1:24:10] try to divert them let me just say this
[1:24:11] to you
[1:24:12] part of our maturity isn't that we're
[1:24:14] not tempted and isn't that you don't
[1:24:17] make mistakes but I'm gonna tell you
[1:24:19] this right here part of our maturity is
[1:24:21] where you start recognizing the devil
[1:24:23] and every one of his tricks God told
[1:24:27] Israel when you get in the land
[1:24:29] down there pictures and there's times
[1:24:33] there's been wrong behaviors family
[1:24:38] strange you need to pull those pictures
[1:24:41] down get rid of those things because
[1:24:46] what you see is that when you prostrate
[1:24:48] before them it gives you a wrong
[1:24:50] attitude and our own slant and our own
[1:24:53] view you see that's not something where
[1:24:55] you're going out
[1:24:55] oh I'm drinking us no this is something
[1:24:58] where it gets down to the height from a
[1:25:00] charity where you recognize I don't want
[1:25:02] anything that hinders me from pleasing
[1:25:06] him and serving his will that's maturity
[1:25:14] hallelujah we need to be like those in
[1:25:17] the book of Acts where the Word of God
[1:25:18] multiplied the Bible said they brought
[1:25:20] all their books and Birnam come home
[1:25:24] somebody oh my so you just see when we
[1:25:28] look at this here brother been talking
[1:25:29] about that that backslider you see
[1:25:31] brother BAM even brings it in this
[1:25:32] manner here even to where a person can
[1:25:35] begin to speak negative remember when
[1:25:41] you go to talking like that negative he
[1:25:43] said you've excellent right there you're
[1:25:47] getting cold so none though it's this as
[1:25:50] our high priest he stands there to
[1:25:54] intercede for you and I and to think
[1:25:56] even in times of coldness and even in
[1:25:59] the time where there are lives that are
[1:26:02] not fully progressing and have not fully
[1:26:04] moved in to that divine assurance of the
[1:26:07] new birth he is sitting there to
[1:26:09] intercede on our behalf
[1:26:11] do you realize what that is when he
[1:26:12] deals with your heart and gets ahold of
[1:26:14] your lot and deals with you and talks
[1:26:16] with you you realize what that is he is
[1:26:18] making known that he interceding on your
[1:26:21] behalf and there is a life where you can
[1:26:24] live that is a victorious life above the
[1:26:27] life you're living
[1:26:29] you say how brother Samuel it ain't a
[1:26:31] one-two-three ABC step plan
[1:26:34] it's simply surrender your life to the
[1:26:37] Lord
[1:26:38] believe you see it's a reflection I was
[1:26:50] praying right here and just praying over
[1:26:53] these things and this is where the Holy
[1:26:56] Spirit spoke to my heart you are the
[1:26:58] very words that just come to my heart
[1:27:01] how is this reflected I've been studying
[1:27:08] on these things with the high priest
[1:27:09] looking at this and looking through the
[1:27:11] priesthood looking at this and it's over
[1:27:13] the past few weeks and it's just like a
[1:27:17] flood and just not a flood but and how
[1:27:19] the Word of God had challenges you many
[1:27:23] times before it ever comes to your heart
[1:27:25] and you're shedding tears it's already
[1:27:28] been striking here but to see the
[1:27:31] responsibility of the reflection that is
[1:27:34] to be within our lives to reflect this
[1:27:37] present office that where it is known
[1:27:40] how do we know that he's interceding
[1:27:43] there there's got to be lives that that
[1:27:48] can be reflected through you said
[1:27:51] brother Samuel it's got to be the Spirit
[1:27:53] of God that deals I agree
[1:27:55] but he'll travel by the word you with me
[1:28:00] so there has to be a reflection of this
[1:28:03] remember being made co-workers now watch
[1:28:06] this here when you find that there's
[1:28:08] there has to be you know this this
[1:28:11] particular scripture we're going to read
[1:28:12] out of Hebrews five you recognize that
[1:28:14] quote we just read here that quote we
[1:28:18] just read he knows how to sympathize do
[1:28:20] you realize when you read that quote of
[1:28:22] how much long-suffering and patience is
[1:28:26] required there you say I remember
[1:28:38] in the bible is clear to say in the days
[1:28:41] of noah
[1:28:41] he was long-suffering see it was already
[1:28:46] glimpses of the high priest here he is
[1:28:49] he's already meant long-suffering
[1:28:52] long-suffering means to suffer long you
[1:28:55] see what we're dealing with here it's
[1:28:57] more than just about somebody saying
[1:28:59] something against you or you have this
[1:29:01] or that this is what I'm speaking of his
[1:29:03] win we're long-suffering for one another
[1:29:06] we're patient with one another the
[1:29:12] Branham took some heat in his own
[1:29:13] tabernacle for certain things where he
[1:29:14] was long-suffering in patience and some
[1:29:17] of the brother bran knew it and he
[1:29:18] talked about it in broken cisterns I
[1:29:20] want you to think of this here maybe
[1:29:23] I'll refer to that here in a little bit
[1:29:24] in Hebrews 5 verse 1 for every high
[1:29:28] priest taken from among men is ordained
[1:29:31] for men in things pertaining to God
[1:29:35] what's that say that he may offer both
[1:29:39] gifts and sacrifices for sins so the
[1:29:44] priesthood that of the Levites God took
[1:29:48] them to himself out of all Israel he
[1:29:52] redeemed them took them unto himself for
[1:29:55] that service now watch this who can have
[1:29:59] compassion on the ignorant and on them
[1:30:04] better out of the way for that he
[1:30:08] himself also is compass with infirmary I
[1:30:11] want you to catch this for he also is
[1:30:14] accomplished with infirmity I want you
[1:30:17] to think of it take for example here
[1:30:18] this word compassion this word
[1:30:24] compassion deals with one who is not
[1:30:27] unduly disturbed by the errors false
[1:30:32] sins of others but bears them gently now
[1:30:39] I've already started on these verses
[1:30:40] Scripture we're going to go but I can't
[1:30:43] stop here now it's not unduly disturbed
[1:30:48] can see the faults can see the sins can
[1:30:52] see all these things come on somebody we
[1:30:56] don't need a prophet here now to see all
[1:30:59] of that we can see things we see
[1:31:01] coldness we see things where people just
[1:31:03] seem like people are lining up with the
[1:31:05] word come on somebody a coldness that's
[1:31:09] setting in I'll tell you what there's no
[1:31:13] excuse for being cold in this hour if
[1:31:16] you want to be cold and indifference
[1:31:17] because you choose to be that way
[1:31:20] there's a living God a living fire that
[1:31:23] is ever-present
[1:31:24] to clean your life up clean your
[1:31:27] attitude up he's ever-present to take
[1:31:30] care of it so this compassion remember
[1:31:35] it's not about sugarcoating but at the
[1:31:37] same time it's also being able to look
[1:31:42] sometimes you've got to look beyond what
[1:31:44] you're seeing and see the heart you
[1:31:48] understand
[1:31:49] brother Branham man he got criticized
[1:31:51] 1965 broken cisterns Bill Graham said
[1:31:54] concerning that within the tabernacle
[1:31:56] there was a man who was smoking and
[1:31:58] burning he wasn't in the tabernacle yet
[1:32:00] brother Branham went to that man and he
[1:32:03] cared a talking that man he said hey
[1:32:04] what what happened if you die man said
[1:32:07] well brother brownie you know I just I
[1:32:08] can't I can't do this right now I can't
[1:32:11] get my life the Lord I got the smoking
[1:32:12] but the man said why don't you forget
[1:32:14] about that he said you quit looking at
[1:32:17] what you can do and you need to look he
[1:32:20] said it what he's already done
[1:32:24] they said I would really remember them
[1:32:26] said there you go again talking about
[1:32:28] them cigarettes didn't I tell you stop
[1:32:31] talking about that he said you need to
[1:32:34] talk about him and you need to look to
[1:32:36] him and he takes us to the water in the
[1:32:39] rock
[1:32:39] he said there's sufficient water there
[1:32:42] to take care of that
[1:32:43] burgum said he took heat in the
[1:32:46] tabernacle because he baptized that man
[1:32:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not
[1:32:50] that run through a litany of quotes
[1:32:52] right now but I won't do it it was not
[1:32:56] the Spirit of God nor the Prophet
[1:32:59] condoning smoking know what he was
[1:33:06] saying and brother mem says this word
[1:33:08] for word he said what it is beyond what
[1:33:10] all the criticism was he said I could
[1:33:13] see there was something genuine in that
[1:33:16] man sometimes I'm wondering if we're so
[1:33:23] interested I believe in real holiness
[1:33:25] because the Bible said without holiness
[1:33:27] no man shall see God
[1:33:29] that's just flat-out the truth but I
[1:33:31] wonder if my concern has been over time
[1:33:34] are we interested in getting people to
[1:33:36] match our model instead of getting them
[1:33:39] to the Holy Ghost I don't want people
[1:33:42] just to dress Ron and everything else I
[1:33:44] want to see people on fire for God soul
[1:33:48] of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:50] [Applause]
[1:33:54] if you have the Holy Ghost you'll do the
[1:33:58] things that are right it's not a
[1:34:01] struggle to live a Christian life if you
[1:34:03] get the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the
[1:34:06] high priest this morning well yes sir I
[1:34:14] believe you ought to let your hair grow
[1:34:15] sister
[1:34:16] I believe you ought to wipe off all that
[1:34:18] paint off your face and Matt I believe
[1:34:20] you oughta wear shoes that don't put you
[1:34:22] up in the balcony come on now I believe
[1:34:26] your honor wear things that are
[1:34:27] presentable and brothers I believe you
[1:34:29] ought to wear things that are
[1:34:30] presentable - oh yeah brother Brent
[1:34:37] deals with a regarding rumor he talks
[1:34:38] about that of the the ponytail brother
[1:34:41] Brent said now back in the old days he
[1:34:43] said that was an example of a street
[1:34:45] woman he said of course that was back
[1:34:46] then when they would braid their hair
[1:34:47] brother Bramson now he said see he said
[1:34:50] the world looks at that net son off cast
[1:34:52] then he said it's not a fashion of the
[1:34:54] world he said it's okay it's not a
[1:34:56] fashion of the world and this is what
[1:34:58] I'm telling you you might have
[1:35:00] everything it seems like it's detailed
[1:35:01] but you need to make sure that you're
[1:35:04] not trying to pattern yourself after the
[1:35:06] world because brother this world is
[1:35:09] already falling apart but you need a
[1:35:12] pattern yourself after the Living God be
[1:35:14] a witness be an example be a reflection
[1:35:17] of that true high priest and the
[1:35:20] atonement that there is a life that's
[1:35:22] greater than this life there is a life
[1:35:24] that's more dear and more precious we're
[1:35:27] going to send you they may not accept me
[1:35:29] who cares what the world says as long as
[1:35:32] you're accepted in Jesus Christ that's
[1:35:36] what matters
[1:35:38] well they might promote me than if they
[1:35:42] promote you
[1:35:43] you have to confer compromise more and
[1:35:45] more I'd rather be a popper for Jesus
[1:35:48] been to compromise with the things of
[1:35:51] the world
[1:35:52] amen wanna be witnesses in this hour
[1:35:55] that indeed the true atonement has come
[1:35:58] and this is compassion where you can
[1:36:03] look upon a situation and you're able to
[1:36:06] pray for that situation Lord give them
[1:36:10] the same experience you gave me that's
[1:36:16] having confidence with that token you
[1:36:18] know that's the remedy well now we got
[1:36:27] the foundation will preach a little bit
[1:36:32] compassion on the ignorant and them that
[1:36:37] are out of the way some of you might be
[1:36:43] visitors here but you're not ignorant of
[1:36:45] our ways preach preach preach brother
[1:36:48] sin you're not ignorant your children
[1:36:52] are not ignorant of this way no Sam you
[1:36:55] can't make them do this or do that
[1:36:57] I didn't say make them do this or that
[1:36:59] but I ought to be a just a genuine
[1:37:01] respect of the presence of Almighty God
[1:37:04] it ought to be something where there's a
[1:37:06] desire and it ought to be something
[1:37:08] aware it's just a a holiness that's
[1:37:10] there well some of you got quiet on that
[1:37:17] one but that's alright we're talking
[1:37:21] about reflecting the Office of the
[1:37:22] hyperion I'm the time I'm running people
[1:37:23] down and someone I'm talking about I'm
[1:37:27] talking about having a real compassion
[1:37:29] but it's a compassion with power oh my
[1:37:35] and them who are out of the way they
[1:37:37] don't know no better
[1:37:40] hello
[1:37:43] for Hiva himself also his compass with
[1:37:46] infirmity and by reason here of he ought
[1:37:48] as for the people so also for himself to
[1:37:51] offer for sins and no man taketh this
[1:37:54] honor unto himself but he that is called
[1:37:57] of God as was Aaron you did not take
[1:38:02] this honor to be called a son and
[1:38:03] daughter of God unto yourself
[1:38:07] any man that of the priesthood is by
[1:38:10] birthright it's designated you are you
[1:38:16] are already by for nation a seed a child
[1:38:19] of God but remember you had to be born
[1:38:22] into this you can't just walk into the
[1:38:25] priesthood
[1:38:26] you got to present yourself there before
[1:38:29] that way and be wash and be dressed you
[1:38:34] don't just walk in forgive me this might
[1:38:42] step on toes - I never understood how
[1:38:44] people just walk in backsliding it's
[1:38:46] like we just pick up where we left off
[1:38:48] I'll tell you that always questions my
[1:38:50] heart because if you know you say
[1:38:52] brother Simon you don't know what for
[1:38:53] took place at hold no I don't know that
[1:38:55] but if something really took place to
[1:38:57] wear their heart was struck and they had
[1:38:58] already repented and it's turned around
[1:39:00] then praise God let's go on but for
[1:39:02] someone just to walk back in and act
[1:39:04] like nothing it happened it's hit the
[1:39:06] resume button I don't agree with that
[1:39:08] where you been all this time
[1:39:11] come on somebody I believe you ought to
[1:39:14] be a true repentance it's not just come
[1:39:17] back to where you are cuz where you were
[1:39:19] it wasn't strong enough to hold you and
[1:39:21] you fell away you've got to come to a
[1:39:23] place where it's not you the anchor but
[1:39:26] it's Christ who is the anchor that's
[1:39:28] holding you in the veil that's a
[1:39:30] reflection of the high priest no
[1:39:36] repeater God
[1:39:37] so Christ let me go on I got to read
[1:39:39] this so also Christ glorified not
[1:39:41] himself to be made a high priest but
[1:39:43] here he had said unto Him thou art my
[1:39:46] son today have I begotten thee has he
[1:39:49] also said in another place thou art a
[1:39:50] priest forever after the order of
[1:39:52] melchizedek
[1:39:54] remember now here comes here this one
[1:39:58] does great melchizedek and it takes upon
[1:40:01] a body of flesh he's not walking around
[1:40:06] in the temple all day if you recall
[1:40:11] without me relating to a lot of things
[1:40:13] in the scriptures the traditions and
[1:40:16] things that had been so devised with the
[1:40:21] Pharisees they themselves were so
[1:40:24] removed from the people and they were to
[1:40:28] be servants they forgot the foundation
[1:40:32] of the calling they forgot that
[1:40:36] foundation remember they looked a minute
[1:40:39] oh you're born a sinner well tell me how
[1:40:41] you were born that was altogether born
[1:40:44] in sin so were you - but you see listen
[1:40:50] now the Pharisees had such an outward
[1:40:52] and outward you know display about the
[1:40:56] remember brother BAM tells us this and
[1:40:57] you see it in the gospel he said you
[1:40:59] couldn't put a finger on their life but
[1:41:04] then when he started to uncover what's
[1:41:07] beneath these garments he found them
[1:41:11] full of dead men's bones he found them
[1:41:15] full of that was the same spirit
[1:41:18] motivating them that had motivated them
[1:41:21] to saw Isaiah in pieces come on somebody
[1:41:24] it didn't matter they were holding up
[1:41:26] the message of Moses and the law it
[1:41:28] didn't matter all that and they could
[1:41:29] say well I'm the seed of Abraham they
[1:41:31] themselves were against the very God who
[1:41:35] called Abraham and they had a problem
[1:41:44] now let me read the scripture here in
[1:41:47] Luke 15 verse 1 and verse 2 then drew
[1:41:54] near unto him all the publicans and
[1:41:59] sinners for to hear him dear God
[1:42:05] this is Melchizedek clothed in flesh and
[1:42:09] the sinners and publicans drew near him
[1:42:14] to hear him verse 2 and the Pharisees
[1:42:21] and scribes murmured saying this man
[1:42:27] receiveth sinners and eateth with them
[1:42:31] this is Melchizedek in flesh milk
[1:42:36] Cassidy became Jesus Christ here he is
[1:42:41] and the Pharisees and scribes are
[1:42:43] looking at him and saying this man how
[1:42:46] in the world can he have anything to do
[1:42:49] with them I know him they've been coming
[1:42:53] to this church for a long time they
[1:42:55] never got right they never fully went
[1:42:58] all the way then now let me ask you why
[1:43:03] were they coming to Jesus because Jesus
[1:43:06] was a good buddy no it was a living
[1:43:10] presence of the Living God you know what
[1:43:13] it was it was reality it was something
[1:43:17] that those starched Pharisees did not
[1:43:20] have they might have had word but they
[1:43:24] did not know the god of that word even
[1:43:29] the people said never a man spake like
[1:43:31] this do you realize Jesus takes this and
[1:43:34] you can read the rest of the chapter he
[1:43:35] deals with going out after that one lost
[1:43:37] sheep he goes on and deals with a woman
[1:43:40] where the coin she's looking for the
[1:43:41] corn then he goes on to the to the
[1:43:43] prodigal son and he ends this whole
[1:43:46] parables and wraps it up that the
[1:43:49] Pharisees are the elder brother what do
[1:43:55] you mean how no rules he rejoices not
[1:43:56] been here I've done this I've lived this
[1:43:58] to the letter I've done this I've done
[1:44:00] that you say what it is some people
[1:44:03] that's why they're so miserable it's
[1:44:05] because it's what they've been doing and
[1:44:09] instead of rejoicing
[1:44:11] now remember rejoicing the Bible didn't
[1:44:15] say when they rejoice is that a sheep
[1:44:17] been born again he didn't say that it
[1:44:20] didn't say rejoice us now that this coin
[1:44:23] has been you know completely put back or
[1:44:25] that this prodigal son remember the
[1:44:28] father went to meet him this is talking
[1:44:35] about and reflecting his office of a
[1:44:38] high priest
[1:44:38] do you realize Jesus don't sit in heaven
[1:44:41] and say it just repented
[1:44:44] I'll get happy when they get sanctified
[1:44:48] or another sanctified out you know I'll
[1:44:52] wait till they really get born again
[1:44:53] when they get born again I'll get happy
[1:44:54] that's not what this is about
[1:44:56] I guarantee and that's the desire within
[1:44:59] every one of us that's God's desire
[1:45:00] listen friends in the ministering of the
[1:45:02] word it so that you would come into a
[1:45:04] full relationship with Jesus Christ by
[1:45:06] the new birth but I'll tell you this
[1:45:07] right here for a life that has actually
[1:45:10] been given over to God and they
[1:45:12] themselves they might be full of still
[1:45:14] of all the things but yet they've given
[1:45:15] their life to the Lord
[1:45:16] they've turned it over as a sheet that's
[1:45:18] when astray you talk about rejoicing
[1:45:20] brother it all not be just them
[1:45:22] rejoicing we ought to rejoice knowing
[1:45:24] they are not the work of man but even
[1:45:27] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:45:30] Ghost somehow we've got this mixed up
[1:45:34] that sanctification and justification is
[1:45:37] not a work of the Holy Ghost yet we know
[1:45:39] it but somehow we don't know it you know
[1:45:41] what that means it means we need the
[1:45:43] divine power of the high priests to move
[1:45:46] on our midst there are things that you
[1:45:49] and I you can preach you can labor and
[1:45:51] you can see things and sometimes you say
[1:45:53] doesn't get discouraging yeah it's
[1:45:54] discouraging Saint can bring all sorts
[1:45:56] of things up before me it's not being
[1:45:58] effective and this is and and that isn't
[1:46:00] and that isn't but you see within the
[1:46:02] midst of it there I've got a choice I
[1:46:04] can either come out and blast everything
[1:46:06] or I can look under him and say God
[1:46:09] would you direct me and I can look two
[1:46:11] lives that he's bringing up and pray and
[1:46:14] ask God to undertake it might be that
[1:46:16] God will come right through here
[1:46:18] and he'll skin our hearts good but
[1:46:20] remember there still has to be a heart
[1:46:22] behind it
[1:46:25] most time you need to preach on this and
[1:46:28] this what's stopping you what about your
[1:46:30] life we're living so selfish for
[1:46:34] yourself and be a help to the rest of
[1:46:35] the body
[1:46:41] come on yeah I know it's tough but if
[1:46:46] you just say man it helps as sons and
[1:46:51] daughters of God were to be reflections
[1:46:54] operating under the headship and
[1:46:56] authority of a high priest
[1:47:01] you've got charges that you've got to
[1:47:04] keep come on your borders if you're born
[1:47:09] to the Spirit of God you got charges
[1:47:17] well we I want to keep going here the
[1:47:21] Bible goes on to say in Hebrews seven
[1:47:26] my-my-my Hebrews 7 verse verse 23 they
[1:47:35] truly were many high priests were many
[1:47:37] priests because they were not suffered
[1:47:39] to continue by reason of death but this
[1:47:41] man because he continuous ever hath an
[1:47:45] unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is
[1:47:48] able also to save them to the uttermost
[1:47:51] that come unto God by him or that that
[1:47:55] could really we could preach on that for
[1:47:56] months seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:47:59] intercession for them he saves to the
[1:48:03] uttermost that's the that's the
[1:48:05] testimony in our life he don't do a
[1:48:07] partial work he does a complete work
[1:48:13] coming to God by him he does a complete
[1:48:18] work for such a high priest or all of
[1:48:20] this for such a hot reached become us
[1:48:25] who is holy harmless undefiled separate
[1:48:32] from sinners and made higher than the
[1:48:34] heavens
[1:48:35] who need if not daily as those high
[1:48:37] priests to offer up sacrifice first for
[1:48:39] his own sins listen I want you to really
[1:48:41] pay attention this verse who needeth not
[1:48:44] daily as those high priests to offer up
[1:48:47] sacrifice first for his own sins and
[1:48:50] then for the peoples for this he did
[1:48:53] once when he offered up himself remember
[1:49:00] the high priest before they had to have
[1:49:03] a sacrifice that went in before them
[1:49:06] they were continually confessing their
[1:49:09] sins is that right now I believe it the
[1:49:13] Holy Ghost will help us here in dealing
[1:49:15] with this I believe that this when we
[1:49:17] look at this in verse 27
[1:49:19] I believe it deals with us living a life
[1:49:22] that's consecrated to him you say what
[1:49:28] do you mean I'm talking about a life
[1:49:30] that's not lived to self but rather a
[1:49:33] life that's surrendered fully and daily
[1:49:35] to him in order to fully fulfill the
[1:49:38] present office of a high priest let me
[1:49:41] go a little further with it I believe
[1:49:44] with all my heart
[1:49:44] when this verdes verse of scripture
[1:49:46] pressed up on my heart I believe that
[1:49:49] God is calling us to a greater and
[1:49:51] higher calling you say what do you mean
[1:49:55] I mean that we need to recognize the
[1:49:59] power and the authority of our high
[1:50:02] priest to fully operate in our lives
[1:50:06] and that means that our prayers should
[1:50:10] be more have more depth than just asking
[1:50:15] forgiveness I hope you with me you're
[1:50:21] going to make mistakes but that is not
[1:50:23] something where brother Branham told us
[1:50:25] two words well I just have mistakes I
[1:50:28] see that attitude right there I call
[1:50:31] that attitude out that is not right it's
[1:50:33] not a condoning of sin but you are
[1:50:38] compass to about within this body
[1:50:42] brother angles injured he says you know
[1:50:45] it said mistakes he said I've told
[1:50:46] people he said I'll be praying for him
[1:50:48] he's saying
[1:50:48] forget the pray for him you might look
[1:50:52] at this a man I don't see how much of a
[1:50:53] mistake these other things we can go
[1:50:56] through but my point is this instead of
[1:50:58] us living a life that where the prayer
[1:51:01] is constantly asking for forgiveness and
[1:51:03] we thank God that he is a high priest
[1:51:06] there that's one on our behalf that's
[1:51:09] there to make to move for you and I to
[1:51:12] remove that guilt from around our life
[1:51:15] but this is what I'm saying it ought to
[1:51:17] be that we're living a life that's more
[1:51:19] focused on his purpose and his plan and
[1:51:23] his calling instead of ourselves if our
[1:51:29] prayers are more on forgiveness we're
[1:51:31] living a selfish life you understand
[1:51:37] you're praying remember you have come
[1:51:40] into this brought in by the new birth
[1:51:43] and there's many responsibilities for
[1:51:45] the believer priest and one of those is
[1:51:49] intercession intercession for the needs
[1:51:53] of others
[1:51:54] how can you correctly intercede when
[1:51:57] you're wrapped up in yourself instead of
[1:51:59] there's needs in the body there's needs
[1:52:01] for healing
[1:52:02] there's needs for deliverance there's
[1:52:04] needs for people to be born again preach
[1:52:09] brother son
[1:52:12] instead of looking at ourselves is to
[1:52:20] take that focus instead of us look on
[1:52:22] the needs of others Paul said look not
[1:52:25] every man on his own things but also on
[1:52:27] the things of others that don't mean
[1:52:28] look on the things of others and run
[1:52:29] them down
[1:52:30] it means intercede pay for them and God
[1:52:36] lays it on your heart after you've got
[1:52:37] sweetened maybe you would be the vehicle
[1:52:40] to go and speak to them sister to sister
[1:52:44] brother to brother somehow I feel like
[1:52:54] this Catholic spirit II just like wants
[1:52:56] to creep over my brother Sammy was the
[1:53:00] holy man here brother Samuel does
[1:53:02] everything here you better get that
[1:53:03] Roman Catholic spirit out of here this
[1:53:06] is not a one-man it is a body of Jesus
[1:53:10] Christ it's the Holy Ghost working
[1:53:14] through his many membered body glory
[1:53:21] Paul told the believers in Galatia he's
[1:53:23] warning them don't be entangled with the
[1:53:25] yoke of bondage
[1:53:28] you've been free don't get entangled
[1:53:30] with it
[1:53:30] you and you've been free get up and get
[1:53:34] going and keep moving if you fell in a
[1:53:37] rut you made sure that you put distance
[1:53:40] between yourself and the rut you were in
[1:53:49] Paul so told the Corinthians all things
[1:53:52] are lawful unto me but however not all
[1:53:56] of them are expedient
[1:53:59] you see he's trying to tell them that in
[1:54:03] operating there's many things Paul could
[1:54:05] say I can do but I choose not to do it
[1:54:09] it's not expedient it doesn't further
[1:54:12] the work or the calls but let us serve
[1:54:20] one another
[1:54:24] verse 28 that we read I'm coming they'll
[1:54:30] all make us men that are high priests
[1:54:32] that have infirmity I want you to watch
[1:54:35] how Paul places this the lawmakers men
[1:54:39] high priests which have infirmity but
[1:54:42] the word of the oath it was spoken clear
[1:54:46] back to Abraham the word of the oath
[1:54:51] glory be to God which was since the law
[1:54:54] maketh the son who is consecrated
[1:54:57] forevermore and listen to me when he
[1:55:03] stood there before Peter and the rest of
[1:55:05] him he said who do men say that I am
[1:55:09] some say your David some say Jeremiah
[1:55:11] some say this who do you say I am thou
[1:55:15] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:55:20] that logos that pillar of fire the Son
[1:55:28] of God who went out the first visible
[1:55:30] form you with me
[1:55:33] here he is dwelling in a body of flesh I
[1:55:38] want you to listen to me here in this
[1:55:42] body of flesh when he stood before the
[1:55:44] Pharisees they said you're not a man
[1:55:48] more than fifty years old and you told
[1:55:49] me you seen Abraham you see he looked
[1:55:53] old a virgin born body for the complete
[1:55:58] supreme sacrifice he found temptation he
[1:56:07] felt sickness but the Sun was in week
[1:56:15] this is what I'm saying
[1:56:17] this morning the son of God is not weak
[1:56:21] he's all-powerful the Holy Ghost is
[1:56:25] all-powerful but it's an anchor that
[1:56:30] holds it keeps you here you are in your
[1:56:35] life your compass about with infirmity
[1:56:38] but once you've been born again of the
[1:56:40] Spirit of God you're more than a
[1:56:42] conqueror you experience things out here
[1:56:46] but on the inside it's the overcomer
[1:56:49] that's pulsating in your life there is
[1:56:51] no weakness on the inside and through
[1:56:58] that it brings us back to where we will
[1:57:01] receive a body that will match what has
[1:57:04] taken place on the inside of us because
[1:57:07] what has taken place on the inside of us
[1:57:10] it has now connected us with a theophany
[1:57:13] in the heavenly places in the delegation
[1:57:17] of God of that new city and it's
[1:57:21] reflected back down here on earth we
[1:57:25] have a body reserved in the heavens
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:37] there's no weakness in the seed life no
[1:57:42] weakness the Bible says here I'm coming
[1:57:46] down here I just want to drop this in
[1:57:52] you see this is why that we stand
[1:57:57] believers believers spoken where
[1:57:59] tabernacle is not a club it's not a
[1:58:02] lodge there's a lot of sweet people
[1:58:05] there there's a lot of sweet people at
[1:58:07] the ladies sewing circle to come on
[1:58:10] somebody a lot of love down they're
[1:58:13] going to love some other places as well
[1:58:15] Wittering this not just that it's here
[1:58:18] there's a Living God that's present do
[1:58:21] should people fill up they ought to feel
[1:58:23] they ought to come around listen to me
[1:58:26] like it did the Lord Jesus when the
[1:58:28] Bible says they drew near to Jesus there
[1:58:30] was a know roar there was a presence
[1:58:31] about Jesus he was not looking down on
[1:58:34] her
[1:58:37] that's a difference that kind of an
[1:58:39] attitude is not a reflection of the high
[1:58:41] priest that kind of an attitude of
[1:58:43] goodness gracious man how long is going
[1:58:45] to take before they get it that's not a
[1:58:49] reflection of the high priest that's the
[1:58:51] frustration of this earthly garment but
[1:58:56] you and I cannot make people conform
[1:58:59] they tell you something the word is
[1:59:01] preached what parents and as the word is
[1:59:05] preached it's Moses but brother there's
[1:59:07] only one can take across Jordan and
[1:59:09] that's just the agent show the Lord
[1:59:11] that's the only one that can tak them
[1:59:13] across into the promises everything else
[1:59:16] is to be set in order but it has to be
[1:59:18] the presence of God the angel the Lord
[1:59:21] to pack the people into the presence of
[1:59:25] Almighty God that's right
[1:59:32] if you're schooled in to this message
[1:59:34] you'll be schooled out of it I'll hold
[1:59:43] it be to God you said what he's saying
[1:59:46] I'm saying that it ought to be the
[1:59:48] presence of God I believe it friends but
[1:59:52] I want us to be very sincere and very
[1:59:56] very focused on this we want a sweetness
[2:00:00] and a presence about our life that would
[2:00:02] call somebody to one what we have you
[2:00:10] think Jesus wasn't bothered by the
[2:00:12] things that was going on around him he
[2:00:14] was but evidently it did not affect his
[2:00:17] attitude to where they themselves can
[2:00:21] have him around no more it was known he
[2:00:23] received them he didn't avoid them hello
[2:00:29] somebody
[2:00:29] I said he didn't avoid them they weren't
[2:00:32] the plague you know what it was he was
[2:00:35] confident in the seal that was on his
[2:00:38] life a living presence that could have
[2:00:41] an effect on their life if your Holy
[2:00:45] Ghost can be taken away then I wonder
[2:00:48] where
[2:00:48] that it ought to be effectual to where
[2:00:52] it's able to bring people into the
[2:00:54] presence of Almighty God but Simon I
[2:00:57] don't associate with people if it's
[2:00:58] after a few different times and then
[2:01:00] received it you show me that through
[2:01:02] where your prophet did that how many
[2:01:05] times he hung with Bert
[2:01:08] so often we we we Dogma ties this whole
[2:01:11] thing the brother man go along with his
[2:01:15] sin not at all but there was a life that
[2:01:18] was lived a reflection of the office of
[2:01:23] the high priest one to listen not that
[2:01:26] you remain in your sin that's not the
[2:01:28] desire not to go low but the desire is
[2:01:31] as God do something for this life change
[2:01:35] this life maybe it's something that said
[2:01:37] maybe it's not something that said maybe
[2:01:39] it's just said through your life the
[2:01:48] Bible speaks to us that he have made us
[2:01:57] kings and priests unto God and his
[2:01:59] father
[2:02:00] that's a duality King where we're
[2:02:06] reigning over sin over the flesh over
[2:02:12] the devil over sin it's a life of the
[2:02:19] high priest that's reflected in us the
[2:02:23] answer has come the answer to the
[2:02:27] devil's question ask our victory has
[2:02:31] been released and it's a witness it's a
[2:02:35] testimony you see it's a life that's
[2:02:38] live that witnesses to others you can be
[2:02:42] free brother I know what you're going
[2:02:47] through but I want to let you know
[2:02:48] there's a refuge
[2:02:52] sister I know what you're going through
[2:02:54] but there's a refuge for the band
[2:02:57] spending he says always said you that's
[2:02:58] a drunkard he said all he says and your
[2:03:00] family's warning you to get right he
[2:03:02] said I can sympathize with them and he
[2:03:06] goes into talk about the effects of that
[2:03:08] kind of a life and say no why don't you
[2:03:10] just turn your life over to God right
[2:03:12] now let God take control of it you see
[2:03:15] just sympathise doesn't mean that you
[2:03:17] would stay in the condition you're in
[2:03:20] but we are looking to God to know that
[2:03:23] the same god of what he's done in us
[2:03:25] that that same God can do it in you and
[2:03:28] if there's something in your life that
[2:03:30] you feel tempted by you're tested by is
[2:03:32] to wear that we're able to stand
[2:03:34] together as brother to brother Sister to
[2:03:36] Sister and able to say brother I'm
[2:03:38] praying with you sister I'm praying with
[2:03:42] you what a because Heslin has a king
[2:03:54] having dominion on the inside and yet
[2:03:57] were also priests we been brought into
[2:03:59] this place as a priest brother Brennan
[2:04:05] tells us this Lamia I'm closing I am God
[2:04:10] could not suffer in spirit he had to
[2:04:13] become flesh to feel the pain of
[2:04:16] sickness to feel the temptation of lust
[2:04:20] to feel the temptation of want to feel
[2:04:24] the temptation of hunger to feel the
[2:04:26] power of death that he might take it
[2:04:28] upon his self to stand in the presence
[2:04:31] of the Great Spirit Jehovah the spirit
[2:04:35] not the man the spirit to make
[2:04:37] intercession to this life he said Jesus
[2:04:42] took that in order to make intercession
[2:04:43] for us for he knows how it feels when
[2:04:46] you get sick he knows how it feels when
[2:04:49] you're tempted he knows how you feel
[2:04:55] Levin said did you ever notice when we
[2:04:58] vote for a president every farmer will
[2:05:01] vote for a president that's been a
[2:05:03] farmer
[2:05:04] for he knows the hard part of the
[2:05:07] farmers life he wants some man who
[2:05:10] understood and he said before God could
[2:05:14] ever understand before God could ever
[2:05:18] understand but Sammy that's not
[2:05:23] important oh but it is it is important
[2:05:26] that he understand to know how to
[2:05:28] intercede for you and for me not just
[2:05:33] knowledge of it but understand him being
[2:05:41] that great holiness think of this how
[2:05:43] could he ever understand after he
[2:05:46] condemned man by his holiness he
[2:05:48] condemned man and the only way he will
[2:05:51] ever know how to justify man is to
[2:05:54] become the Bram says all he says he's
[2:06:00] our high priest standing there he knows
[2:06:01] how you feel he knows how to reconcile
[2:06:04] you back to Grace and how to bring you
[2:06:07] back to your health he knows how to do
[2:06:11] it but I'm ask you whose hands does he
[2:06:13] have whose feet does he have come on
[2:06:19] somebody
[2:06:21] sometimes it's stretching out to people
[2:06:24] listen France there's too many
[2:06:25] testimonies to go around to things you
[2:06:27] know sometimes it's not jumping right on
[2:06:29] what you see is wrong sometimes you need
[2:06:32] to develop a friendship we're so
[2:06:39] interested that's not God's approach God
[2:06:44] gets your favor give me an example glad
[2:06:47] you asked Nathan when he walked in
[2:06:50] before David did David did Nathan walk
[2:06:52] in there with double barrels you man no
[2:06:57] you know what he did he God David
[2:06:59] because David would have been on the
[2:07:00] defense he got him to open up his gate
[2:07:04] of reasoning the word just opened him up
[2:07:08] to a certain place and then he finally
[2:07:09] could say you're the guy so he had open
[2:07:13] up there was his defenses were dis
[2:07:18] and you know brother Bram tells us then
[2:07:20] you start talking about the weather
[2:07:21] see if it'll go any further see if it'll
[2:07:24] go any further why would I do that
[2:07:26] because you have a heart of feeling for
[2:07:30] that person don't you let the devil
[2:07:34] condemn you that if you've been talking
[2:07:36] to them oh I didn't let him have this
[2:07:38] quote and I didn't let him have this
[2:07:40] scripture that's just a devil trying to
[2:07:42] get you all twisted up she friends he
[2:07:44] need to discern this right here the
[2:07:46] devil brings that stuff with anxiety the
[2:07:48] Spirit of God does not bring anxiousness
[2:07:50] how could he he'd be contradicting
[2:07:52] himself when he told us don't be anxious
[2:07:54] be careful for nothing take no thought
[2:07:56] for tomorrow he would contradict himself
[2:08:02] remember after all the one individual
[2:08:06] brother branham talked about being led
[2:08:07] to the Lord
[2:08:08] it wasn't what the preacher said
[2:08:09] although all the sermons were wonderful
[2:08:11] it wasn't the choir what did he see
[2:08:14] sunrise sunrise brother Brandon led a
[2:08:22] man to the Lord the infidel what quote
[2:08:26] did he use well the scripture did use
[2:08:30] well the rain rivers I mean he had has a
[2:08:33] God is in his universe God is in nature
[2:08:37] the Spirit of God used such wisdom and
[2:08:40] discernment to point this out to that
[2:08:42] man to what the man is open now he's
[2:08:46] open
[2:08:46] now you can approach it but if you to
[2:08:48] come out blazing with scriptures
[2:08:51] different story different story but the
[2:08:55] first that's why just be a reflection
[2:08:58] let your light so shine and pray God
[2:09:02] give me a favor with that brother give
[2:09:05] me a favor with that co-worker Lord give
[2:09:06] me a favor with m'lord would you Lord
[2:09:08] God give me favor for that soul that
[2:09:12] ought to be our prayer
[2:09:13] give me favor with them Lord that it
[2:09:16] would be like that to where they would
[2:09:18] assemble to our lives like they did to
[2:09:21] the Lord Jesus
[2:09:29] my ena was all about it he didn't have
[2:09:36] to be sick I'm just skimming over these
[2:09:41] but he became sick he didn't have to be
[2:09:46] but that you when you're sick or I'm
[2:09:49] sick and we could say lord I need you
[2:09:52] touchable but I just don't I don't feel
[2:09:57] good you don't stand here and say well I
[2:10:00] don't know it seems pretty bad he's able
[2:10:04] to sympathize and in her head and he's
[2:10:10] able to offer up as we stand there and
[2:10:11] say Lord by your stripes I'm healed yep
[2:10:15] yep yep that's it he's standing there to
[2:10:19] make good on that confession let me
[2:10:25] leave you with this quote here and we'll
[2:10:27] close out of the message living dying
[2:10:32] the last things the last quote I gave
[2:10:34] you just skip down to that first
[2:10:38] nineteen said I'm so glad to know that
[2:10:42] he can be found amongst the
[2:10:43] brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not
[2:10:48] one that would leave us aren't you glad
[2:10:52] that he sends an email glad he sends a
[2:10:58] card or it may not be American Greetings
[2:11:02] but it's greetings from the Dove and our
[2:11:10] sorrows he's not one that would leave us
[2:11:11] he stands by us when all has failed and
[2:11:14] the last hopes of earthly reaching has
[2:11:18] come to its end he is still God and He
[2:11:20] loves us he was the expressing of God
[2:11:24] and all how I believe that he longs for
[2:11:28] his people to be so anointed with his
[2:11:32] that we could go to each other in trials
[2:11:36] and in troubles and give the expression
[2:11:40] of his sympathy as it pours from our
[2:11:43] hearts that's been born of his spirit to
[2:11:47] reflect in the church the love of the
[2:11:51] Living God
[2:11:54] it's powerful it's a lot he longs for
[2:12:01] his people to be so anointed with this
[2:12:04] spirit now probably if we're asking out
[2:12:06] here who would want to be the one they
[2:12:09] would go on here Lake Erie if God wants
[2:12:10] people to walk on water out here today
[2:12:12] or not I'll do it lord I just just
[2:12:15] humbly I'll walk on the water let all of
[2:12:17] them see but if he says hey would you be
[2:12:24] anybody would be willing born in my
[2:12:26] spirit that would want to show sympathy
[2:12:29] to a brother to a sister well that's not
[2:12:34] like walking on the water I know but
[2:12:35] it's its greatness its greatness its
[2:12:40] greatness to be able to express did you
[2:12:45] catch what it says his sympathy how can
[2:12:50] I have sympathy the right depth of it
[2:12:52] without him but to enter in God help us
[2:12:58] reflecting his present office reflecting
[2:13:01] a life above sin and yet within that
[2:13:04] rhythm through that divine power riding
[2:13:06] residing within our life to also reflect
[2:13:09] that compassion that's able to minister
[2:13:14] to a heart and say there's a better way
[2:13:18] there's a deeper life god bless you this
[2:13:23] morning I'll tell you this morning if
[2:13:26] you you're here without that life you
[2:13:28] can have it you can have it if God's
[2:13:31] been dealing with your heart you can
[2:13:33] have it you just you just surrender and
[2:13:36] say Lord draw me nearer Lloyd you might
[2:13:41] say brother salmon sometimes taking the
[2:13:43] simple word surrender Oh Simon what does
[2:13:44] that mean that means giving everything
[2:13:47] if you know that there still holds on
[2:13:49] your life steel things that you still
[2:13:51] have a love for say Lord dissolve that
[2:13:54] love dissolve that Lord I want to be in

[2:14:11] your present office a life that's above
[2:14:17] sin and I want to reflect it Lord
[2:14:22] reflecting your sympathy to others let

[2:15:37] others I pray Heavenly Father
[2:15:46] I pray O God for our lives Lord hearts
[2:15:51] as an assembly
[2:15:58] I realize Lord what care

[2:16:30] Lord as your holy spirit Lord is just
[2:16:33] moving through this building Lord to
[2:16:35] bring conviction to hearts that are not

[2:18:13] but help us Lord me God our sights be
[2:18:19] set in such a measure Lord they were
[2:18:25] looking not just on our own but on the
[2:18:29] needs of others and taking it to heart
[2:18:33] [Music]
[2:18:35] maybe Lord God it's the burden you'd
[2:18:41] place on our heart annoyed to befriend
[2:18:46] that brothers sister because a desire to
[2:18:52] see him help to encourage him to pray
[2:18:54] with them Lord Bible said confess your

[2:19:27] the witness the Lord God among us as a
[2:19:29] people it's true Lord
[2:19:37] and we'd give you glory because it's
[2:19:39] nothing that we've done but Lord neither
[2:19:42] do we want to be of a mind as though
[2:19:44] that it's something we've done Lord to
[2:19:48] where there's the presence of God that
[2:19:51] strikes hearts when they walk in this
[2:19:52] door to where in Lord when others come
[2:19:57] this in mind just just feel such a love
[2:19:59] and they know it's it's beyond just any
[2:20:01] just any love but God I pray that from
[2:20:07] the depth of every heart may it be God
[2:20:10] we're burdens are taken on Lord to pray
[2:20:16] for that one Lord to pray for that life
[2:20:22] to stand there Lord as an intercessor as

[2:34:00] try
[2:34:08] Oh Lord God
[2:34:10] [Music]
[2:34:24] you know I think of where Paul and we
[2:34:28] think of the burden now God would so
[2:34:31] place us in the body I look at what Paul
[2:34:36] said when he met the Lord and he said
[2:34:40] Lord what would you have me do what
[2:34:47] would you have me do you know that's
[2:34:51] something when you you look at it
[2:34:53] everyone everyone has a part in the body
[2:34:59] of Jesus Christ you may not be a singer
[2:35:07] may not be a preacher don't don't matter
[2:35:11] you might be one that I say bill Sammon
[2:35:15] sometimes I get I'll twist it up my
[2:35:16] words but you might be one that even
[2:35:20] behind the scenes you're taking needs
[2:35:23] and you're praying about it
[2:35:26] you're one that's reaching out to others
[2:35:31] that you see in need you've got your
[2:35:35] part in the body and that part on once
[2:35:39] you understand as we surrendered to that
[2:35:41] part I think our brother Brent I
[2:35:42] remember how he looked when he seen Oral
[2:35:44] Roberts and all the rest of me said Lord
[2:35:46] I guess you couldn't trust me with
[2:35:48] something like this Ben said I got the
[2:35:50] feeling sorry for myself
[2:35:52] and he said Ben the Lord told me look up
[2:35:56] I'm your Porsche
[2:36:01] brother brand recognized that what God
[2:36:05] had given him to do he said do you
[2:36:06] realize he said you may not be and
[2:36:08] brother been put in those terms a Billy
[2:36:10] Graham Warren Oral Roberts he said but
[2:36:13] if you do what God has called you to do
[2:36:15] he said you are thought of as much as
[2:36:18] what they are in the kingdom
[2:36:21] you see it's what God has called us to
[2:36:25] do Lord what would you have me to do you
[2:36:31] know it's different sometimes people say
[2:36:32] I'll do this or I'll do that and but if
[2:36:35] it don't drop here as a burden when you
[2:36:37] don't feel like doing it you won't do it
[2:36:40] when it's a burden you do it when you
[2:36:43] don't feel like doing it that's
[2:36:47] different but when it's a burden
[2:36:51] you say what do you mean by burden where
[2:36:53] you take it and realize this is my
[2:36:55] church this is my symbol these are my
[2:37:02] brothers and sisters yeah come on
[2:37:05] somebody
[2:37:07] you see I I love all you kids but I
[2:37:10] don't love them better in love mine I
[2:37:12] love mine better I love all of God's
[2:37:15] people God's giving me you know an
[2:37:19] opportunity to meet others and and
[2:37:21] minister but God don't know I'm not for
[2:37:24] everybody but this is the burden that
[2:37:27] God has for me do you understand that's
[2:37:30] the same way when we look at this Lord
[2:37:33] this is my assembly it's not
[2:37:36] well that's brother sango's Church no
[2:37:38] this is my church I said this is my
[2:37:41] church you have that responsibility as a
[2:37:44] gate keeper as a priest in the house of
[2:37:48] God
[2:37:49] and you can say Lord what would you have
[2:37:53] me do what would you have me to do Lord
[2:37:57] and you do that with what God drops on
[2:38:01] your heart you do it with all eyes unto
[2:38:03] the Lord you watch God he up that burden
[2:38:06] he's placed on your heart he makes good
[2:38:08] on it it makes good on it it's very very
[2:38:13] very very very well I think you know a
[2:38:16] services of what God has done here as
[2:38:20] I've said in the past few years I've
[2:38:21] seen more supernatural in the past few
[2:38:23] years here than I've ever seen many
[2:38:26] things taking place not just in healing
[2:38:30] deliverances and other things I've
[2:38:31] watched God do
[2:38:34] but you know what it wouldn't have taken
[2:38:35] place and things the services themselves
[2:38:37] if it weren't people praying it wouldn't
[2:38:41] what I mean
[2:38:41] your so brother Simon you study but I
[2:38:43] don't study what I want to study you see
