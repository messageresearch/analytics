[36:14] a wonderful time uh and i
[36:17] i think we we we identify with that as
[36:20] far as the world
[36:22] it's a it's a terrible time
[36:25] it's a time of great uncertainty it's a
[36:28] time
[36:29] where you know
[36:32] where people are depending upon
[36:35] people but i'm thankful that
[36:38] we're our dependence is in the lord
[36:42] and that doesn't mean we have all the
[36:44] answers but we have the answer
[36:46] we have him that will lead us brother
[36:48] branham of justice hearing brother
[36:50] branham here this afternoon you've heard
[36:52] this
[36:52] story that he would express
[36:56] regarding a schwinn
[36:59] bicycle that was going to be given away
[37:02] and brother branham takes it in in this
[37:04] particular message and he relates it to
[37:08] the place of where all sorts of things
[37:11] are going on around us
[37:13] so back in 1955 he said all sorts of
[37:17] things are happening all around us
[37:20] he said but where i find my joy
[37:24] is in him and where i have my focus
[37:28] brother brahm then takes that story and
[37:31] you know there's just certain times that
[37:34] sometimes there's things that you've
[37:35] heard and maybe it meant something to
[37:37] you before but it just
[37:38] it just even means a little bit more to
[37:40] you just at that time
[37:42] because there was some boys that got on
[37:44] that board and they started to ride that
[37:47] bike
[37:48] now brother brahm tells us that the boys
[37:50] that got on that bike to ride it
[37:52] they were strong apt
[37:56] able boys in other words they were
[37:59] thought
[37:59] if anybody can do it they can do it
[38:03] and they got on there and they fell off
[38:07] brother brown said here come a boy that
[38:09] in the community
[38:10] that was regarded as a right
[38:14] but he climbed on that bike and he rode
[38:17] that bike clear to the end
[38:20] and the rest of the boys that were
[38:21] strong and apt
[38:23] man these were the guys that everybody
[38:25] was they're going to make it
[38:27] they asked they asked him how did you do
[38:30] it
[38:31] he said simple you fellas he said you
[38:34] got your eyes
[38:36] on what was going on around you he said
[38:39] but i kept my eyes on the end
[38:41] [Music]
[38:43] we've got a clear destination
[38:48] we are not a distracted people
[38:51] [Music]
[38:52] are you with me what is the attraction
[38:54] on the mount
[38:56] [Applause]
[38:57] we're a people where god has made
[39:01] a sign known to you and i that we have
[39:03] become
[39:04] united with that same sign and that's
[39:06] him
[39:07] are you with me that's him we've become
[39:09] united with
[39:12] not a church not an idea
[39:15] it's an attraction we have been
[39:18] attracted
[39:19] to him because he's what set us free
[39:25] and our eyes are focused on him
[39:29] let that be our testimony we're being
[39:32] hey listen
[39:33] i could preach a lot on this we're being
[39:36] tested
[39:38] we're being tested we will continue to
[39:40] be tested our character
[39:42] is being tested
[39:46] everything around us is being tested
[39:49] so in the midst of this time let us not
[39:52] be ignorant
[39:54] of satan's devices let us be mindful
[39:58] that just as much as he is always trying
[40:00] to work to put a kink in the hose
[40:03] to try to hinder our focus is
[40:06] in the living god god is seeing us
[40:09] through
[40:10] is that right god is seeing us through
[40:13] god will continue to see us through it
[40:16] amen let us just have our confidence
[40:19] in him amen
[40:24] let's let's look to the lord in a word
[40:25] of prayer before we read in our
[40:27] scriptures
[40:28] here this evening
[40:31] heavenly father we just
[40:34] lord take every one of these requests
[40:39] we take the needs that's on the heart
[40:41] the unspoken request
[40:44] lord we lift him oh god before
[40:49] your throne and we ask that lord you'll
[40:52] just come
[40:55] whether here whether over the internet
[40:57] no matter where we might and where
[40:59] we are gathered together
[41:02] may lord you go forth
[41:06] and minister to that need
[41:10] lord minister that you're the i am that
[41:13] i am
[41:14] minister to that life
[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] lord we just pray that you'll just come
[41:22] speak to our hearts tonight
[41:26] we love you and we thank you father in
[41:28] the name of jesus christ amen
[41:31] amen let's turn in our bibles to
[41:33] ephesians chapter 2.
[41:35] i want to say thank you to musicians we
[41:37] certainly
[41:38] appreciated
[41:42] your prayers we weren't here on sunday
[41:44] but the lord
[41:45] i know that you had a wonderful
[41:48] time in his presence with brother
[41:51] alexander
[41:52] and i think brother alexander for coming
[41:55] we kind of just swapped places i
[41:56] was down there ministering to
[42:00] the saints in in bluffton ohio brother
[42:03] ray erickson's
[42:04] the assembly there and the lord just so
[42:07] richly uh moved there
[42:10] on behalf of the needs of his children
[42:13] as well so we thank god for that
[42:15] because it's certainly nothing we can do
[42:18] it has to be him
[42:20] so ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and
[42:26] notice paul these are familiar
[42:28] scriptures perhaps to many
[42:30] of you but notice how paul would take
[42:32] this and he says
[42:33] and you hath he quickened now he's
[42:37] speaking to the
[42:38] to the real you that has been quickened
[42:42] then he goes into the condition we were
[42:44] in who were
[42:46] dead in trespasses
[42:49] and sins wherein time passed
[42:52] ye walked according to the course of
[42:56] this world
[42:57] according to the prince of the power of
[42:59] the air
[43:00] the spirit that now worketh in the
[43:01] children of disobedience
[43:04] among whom also we all had
[43:07] our conversation that's your character
[43:10] your actions
[43:11] your behavior your life among whom we
[43:14] all had our conversation
[43:16] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[43:20] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[43:23] and of the mind and were
[43:26] by nature the children of wrath
[43:30] even as others if you can really receive
[43:35] this what paul is writing
[43:36] he's eulogizing a dead man
[43:40] you can't eulogize a living man he's
[43:43] still alive
[43:45] i mean if somebody came and said hey i'm
[43:46] gonna i'm gonna read a eulogy of you and
[43:48] you think
[43:49] me i'm not even dead why would you
[43:52] eulogize me
[43:54] but you see the word is eulogizing that
[43:56] first
[43:57] nature dead
[44:00] but there is that new nature that life
[44:04] that was hidden that was dead
[44:07] now has been raised up
[44:11] we're not reading a eulogy we're reading
[44:13] this is our life
[44:16] but god look at this but god who is
[44:19] rich in mercy for his great love
[44:23] wherewith
[44:24] he loved us what was lovable about us
[44:28] nothing out here in this first character
[44:32] but god was looking beneath the darkness
[44:38] even when we were dead in sins
[44:42] hath quickened us together with christ
[44:47] by grace are ye are saved and hath
[44:50] raised us up together and made us
[44:53] sit together in heavenly places
[44:57] in christ jesus
[45:00] that in the ages to come he might
[45:03] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[45:06] in his kindness toward us through
[45:08] christ jesus for by grace
[45:11] are you saved through faith
[45:15] and that not of yourselves it is the
[45:17] gift
[45:18] of god not of works
[45:21] lest any man should boast
[45:24] for we are his workmanship
[45:27] created in christ jesus on two good
[45:30] works which
[45:31] god hath before ordained that we should
[45:34] walk
[45:35] in them amen
[45:40] i'd like to speak here tonight on the
[45:43] sovereign
[45:44] working of the holy spirit may god bless
[45:47] you bless the reading of his word as
[45:49] you're being seated
[45:53] and when we
[45:56] look and you take the
[46:00] whole theme
[46:05] we could say plot theme
[46:08] the main idea what within the scriptures
[46:12] the entire bible there's one goal
[46:15] that god is trying to achieve
[46:20] we find that the the desire
[46:23] is that god's desire is to come
[46:27] and to live inside
[46:31] of his people
[46:35] there's no way that man could make
[46:37] himself fit for this
[46:39] but god himself is the one who does the
[46:42] work
[46:43] and the one who provides for us what's
[46:46] needed
[46:47] in order that we might prepare our lives
[46:50] for his coming you know
[46:53] you look at there's so many different
[46:56] angles when we look at in the scripture
[46:58] that all speaks
[46:59] of the same goal it doesn't matter um
[47:03] what a particular story or
[47:07] when i don't just even like to use the
[47:09] word story but
[47:10] when you look at every expression and
[47:12] every characteristic through the
[47:14] scriptures
[47:15] you see this whole goal
[47:18] is that god's desire is he desires to
[47:22] dwell inside his children there are
[47:23] things of how that
[47:25] god uh you know will will take it in a
[47:28] manner of like a man running a race but
[47:31] yet
[47:31] there is a right way to run that race
[47:35] you know how it is if that race is not
[47:37] run correctly
[47:39] then no matter how a person they could
[47:41] cross the finish line
[47:42] if they have not run it correctly they
[47:44] are disqualified
[47:45] right so there's so many different
[47:48] angles even how paul would take it as a
[47:50] soldier
[47:51] one who would even be be equipped
[47:54] for the battle that he is preparing to
[47:57] enter into and on and on through the
[47:59] scriptures we could go but
[48:00] we wanted even just to look back even
[48:03] how god would set this
[48:05] forth even in genesis 1 where
[48:08] in the beginning you find this the earth
[48:12] itself
[48:12] was under a condition of darkness
[48:15] darkness is
[48:16] judgment it was under that of us of a
[48:19] time
[48:20] of judgment but within that darkness it
[48:23] was void
[48:24] uh there was no uh indication of life
[48:29] but remember
[48:29] god had planted every seed beneath the
[48:33] darkness beneath the waters
[48:35] that was covering that that the earth
[48:38] god had already planted the seeds
[48:42] by his word and we find in the beginning
[48:46] where the holy spirit is brooding
[48:48] over the earth after god has said
[48:52] let there be light and the bible speaks
[48:55] and declares then the spirit of god
[48:57] moved you see
[48:58] the word making a call a purpose
[49:02] a desire the holy spirit comes forth
[49:05] which is the word to perform or to bring
[49:09] into expression
[49:10] what the word is calling for so it's
[49:14] this is god's working in our own
[49:16] individual life
[49:18] we hear what the word is saying but let
[49:20] me just say it to you very clearly
[49:22] we can hear with these ears but it's
[49:24] really hearing down in here and we
[49:26] sense the call of the holy spirit that's
[49:29] the
[49:30] brooding of the holy spirit that comes
[49:33] upon a heart
[49:34] comes upon our life and says i'm here to
[49:37] perform
[49:38] what the word is calling for
[49:42] and so the sovereignty of how
[49:46] that it comes that it's god working it's
[49:49] him that's working
[49:50] the scripture where it speaks blessed
[49:53] are they that do
[49:54] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[49:57] for they shall be filled
[50:01] it is it's god moving to bring forth the
[50:04] desire
[50:06] that is down there on the inside you
[50:08] know a person can have a desire
[50:10] to serve god a desire to be right
[50:13] and yet they've never repented because
[50:15] the repentance doesn't bring the desire
[50:18] the desire is the hidden potential down
[50:21] on the inside
[50:22] in that seed it's something about it
[50:24] that a person can go all their life
[50:26] they can you know get be trapped into
[50:29] all sorts of sin and
[50:30] all sorts of marks and things upon their
[50:32] life but there's still
[50:33] something there about it that they know
[50:36] there's a god somewhere
[50:38] though they don't know about him and
[50:39] though they don't know you know
[50:41] how how will i ever get out of this but
[50:44] yet there's a desire
[50:45] that is there i will call it a thirst
[50:49] that god put within you and there's
[50:52] nothing in this world can satisfy
[50:54] that thirst that desire except the very
[50:58] god himself
[50:59] who placed that thirst that desire was
[51:02] in you
[51:03] and you know many things can come along
[51:05] and you know
[51:06] things that where it will uh try to
[51:09] suppress or to take away that desire but
[51:12] let me just say
[51:13] and that desire can never be quenched
[51:16] that desire can never be taken away uh
[51:19] it might go a long time before it ever
[51:21] comes into expression
[51:23] but when god has given that desire there
[51:26] is
[51:26] no matter of sin no matter how you would
[51:29] rank it there shouldn't be any ranking
[51:31] it doesn't matter about that at all it
[51:34] comes down because we see
[51:36] in the ministry of the lord jesus he
[51:38] could have come to the pharisees
[51:40] and turned them all around that they
[51:42] remember they themselves
[51:44] they were righteous they themselves were
[51:46] righteous couldn't put a finger on their
[51:48] life
[51:49] but jesus came and he began to deal with
[51:52] the inward man
[51:53] because that's what the messiah was
[51:55] coming for is to bring a change on the
[51:57] inside
[51:58] it's not about the righteousness how
[52:00] well that a person can you know what
[52:03] somehow perfect their body and their
[52:05] life of well i don't do this and i don't
[52:07] do that
[52:07] but yet if they still desire sin on the
[52:11] inside
[52:11] i don't care how righteous they are on
[52:13] the outside they still
[52:15] are guilty in the eyes of god
[52:19] maybe in the eyes of man they're
[52:20] innocent like whoa
[52:22] what a wonderful person but in the eyes
[52:25] of god
[52:25] they are still guilty see god
[52:29] came to deal with the inward man with
[52:32] the
[52:33] inward work with the heart with the life
[52:36] of man
[52:36] with that nature on the inside so god
[52:39] would move in such a measure that to
[52:42] bring
[52:43] forth the desire the longing
[52:46] to bring that into a place to where
[52:50] it becomes expressed it becomes
[52:52] expressed
[52:53] in that life because the real darkness
[52:55] the real darkness
[52:56] that covers our life or might be
[52:58] covering your life
[53:00] that darkness is that first birth
[53:04] but if you've received a word from god
[53:07] and god is there moving on that life and
[53:10] saying
[53:11] let there be light and you experience
[53:13] the brooding
[53:14] of the holy spirit where he's moving
[53:16] upon your life
[53:17] and beginning to change even how you
[53:20] think
[53:20] and beginning to change your heart and
[53:23] begin to open you
[53:24] that is a work of the holy spirit
[53:27] working to bring forth
[53:29] that desire to lift you above your first
[53:33] birth
[53:34] and to bring you to a new birth
[53:37] the bible says in ezekiel 36 i want to
[53:40] come back into this tonight
[53:41] in verse 24 for i will take you from
[53:45] among the heathen now remember
[53:47] god is writing this prophetically
[53:50] regarding israel but remember it
[53:52] parallels
[53:53] the hour and the time that we're living
[53:56] in let me read this
[53:57] for i will take you from among the
[54:00] heathen
[54:01] and gather you out of all countries and
[54:04] bring you
[54:05] into your own land now what's your thing
[54:07] think about the jews here that
[54:09] where they had you know many were born
[54:11] in germany and
[54:12] uh there were those you know the
[54:14] ethiopian jews and
[54:15] you have those that were born in other
[54:17] countries you have the jews that
[54:19] were born here you have jews and romania
[54:22] all those other places
[54:23] but god said i will gather you
[54:26] so god is gathering bringing the jews
[54:29] into a place back to their land where he
[54:33] can make himself
[54:34] known to them in other words he's
[54:36] gathering them
[54:37] though they are jews he's gathering them
[54:41] out of the places of where they were
[54:43] born
[54:44] the land of their natural nativity this
[54:47] is what he did to abraham are you with
[54:49] me
[54:49] this is what he does for you and i
[54:53] he calls us out from the crowd from the
[54:57] life
[54:57] from the people that we were walking
[55:00] with
[55:00] just like abraham and he says come out
[55:03] from among them that is part of
[55:07] heeding in obedience to the voice and
[55:10] that is a
[55:11] sovereign work of the brooding of the
[55:13] holy spirit
[55:15] upon your life
[55:20] hallelujah to bring us into our own land
[55:25] our own place the real nativity of our
[55:28] life
[55:28] amen verse 25
[55:31] then notice once now he's bringing them
[55:35] you see
[55:35] you've got to get him into a land you've
[55:38] got to come to a place
[55:39] where he can reveal himself i hope
[55:42] you're with me now
[55:43] he you got to come to a place where life
[55:46] is
[55:47] you can't come to a place where it's
[55:49] just just just
[55:51] church where it's just theology where
[55:53] it's just doctrine that's not the place
[55:54] of life
[55:56] you must come to a place of life where
[55:59] he is together because the bible said
[56:02] that where two or three are gathered
[56:03] together
[56:04] in my name and it's not just saying the
[56:06] name of jesus
[56:07] his name is his life his character his
[56:10] nature
[56:11] it's him amen is that right he said i am
[56:14] come in my
[56:15] father's name hallelujah
[56:18] amen and where where the word
[56:22] the meat is the the meat there where the
[56:25] eagles be gathered together
[56:29] so we might he has to draw us
[56:33] let me just give the example here you
[56:35] are as a person
[56:37] and maybe you're going about you know
[56:39] your own way
[56:40] and god sounds to your heart and you
[56:43] think
[56:44] i didn't hear nothing here he's not
[56:46] sounding to it here
[56:47] he's calling this down here
[56:50] this is the man he's trying to bring
[56:53] into a bear
[56:55] it's a supernatural call that begins to
[56:58] go forth that a person
[56:59] doesn't even understand what's going on
[57:02] god might deal with them in dreams
[57:04] god might deal with them in other ways
[57:06] but remember he will always deal with
[57:08] them
[57:08] according even to their makeup god knows
[57:11] how to get our
[57:12] attention amen
[57:17] so you must bring us into that place
[57:24] into that of our own land
[57:27] then he says in verse 25 then will i
[57:30] sprinkle clean water upon you
[57:35] and you shall be clean
[57:41] water speaks of the spirit speaks of the
[57:43] word
[57:44] from all your filthiness and from all
[57:47] your idols
[57:48] will i cleanse you
[57:52] so the sprinkling of clean water
[57:55] if you catch it it's him
[57:58] he is the word this is
[58:01] the life that is coming forth it is the
[58:05] preaching of the word that deals
[58:09] with the stony heart it's the preaching
[58:11] of the word
[58:12] even when a person would say oh that's
[58:14] hard oh my goodness
[58:16] all this is said but you see god has to
[58:18] come it's not the hardness of the man
[58:20] preaching
[58:21] it is christ the man could just stand
[58:23] right here maybe don't even raise his
[58:25] voice
[58:25] it's not the man's voice it is the
[58:28] presence of
[58:29] the lord that begins to deal with
[58:33] that heart and there's times that god
[58:36] has to point out
[58:37] things that seem very very much maybe on
[58:41] the outside
[58:42] with how the outside is presented why
[58:45] because his desire
[58:47] is not that we patch up the outside and
[58:49] try
[58:50] to make the outside all nice no god is
[58:53] letting us know
[58:54] that there is something lacking on the
[58:56] inside
[58:57] and if you get the inside man you get
[59:00] christ in there
[59:01] the outside will reflect the inside
[59:05] i'm talking about a power the holy ghost
[59:07] is not an intellectual thought
[59:09] it is the power of god
[59:13] in that it brings us into the presence
[59:15] of one who is greater one who's able to
[59:18] minister to our needs
[59:20] that's why there's healing in the church
[59:23] are you with me
[59:24] this is why there's healing in the
[59:26] church this is why we need
[59:28] healing signs and wonders not just back
[59:30] there in the church
[59:32] i thank god we've had signs and wonders
[59:34] we've had that here
[59:35] it's not about signs and wonders of
[59:37] building us up you understand what those
[59:38] signs and wonders are
[59:40] it is a testimony to hearts and lives
[59:43] to see the living god not a man a man
[59:46] can't do those things a man cannot turn
[59:49] stage four cancer around that takes a
[59:52] living god to do that
[59:54] amen you can even take a person
[59:57] that has experienced healing maybe they
[59:59] didn't hang on to their healing maybe
[1:00:01] they lost faith but there was still
[1:00:03] healing are you with me
[1:00:04] jesus said go that way and sin no more
[1:00:07] lest the worst thing come upon you
[1:00:09] satan will be there to challenge healing
[1:00:12] are you with me it isn't just well you
[1:00:14] know i've been healed and might just go
[1:00:16] on no that's why the prophet said
[1:00:18] do not get around unbelievers do not get
[1:00:21] around doubters
[1:00:23] don't entertain any thought that comes
[1:00:25] up and says well
[1:00:26] uh this is just a few days and why don't
[1:00:28] you look at this you cast down every
[1:00:31] imagination
[1:00:33] are you with me because that's really
[1:00:35] where the prophet
[1:00:36] would say i wish i had a tent he said to
[1:00:38] lay in these principles on divine
[1:00:40] healing
[1:00:41] because many times people they leave and
[1:00:44] the spirit
[1:00:44] within that cancer has been cast out the
[1:00:47] life of it
[1:00:48] and then they go off they go off and
[1:00:50] then they begin to look
[1:00:52] and it grows in them but what it is it's
[1:00:54] like a dead dog
[1:00:56] that's been ran over on the road it is
[1:00:58] not that
[1:00:59] big and bloated when you first run over
[1:01:01] it but if you let it set it becomes big
[1:01:04] and bloated that is a sure sign when
[1:01:07] they say i'm sicker than i used to be
[1:01:09] that's a sign you've been healed
[1:01:12] are you with me you're talking about how
[1:01:14] to stand there on the water
[1:01:16] and saying devil you're not coming back
[1:01:18] here
[1:01:20] every time god ministers a promise to
[1:01:22] your heart you've got to stand there
[1:01:24] with the sword
[1:01:25] of the lord god has sovereignly come to
[1:01:27] you
[1:01:28] and you've got a right to stand there
[1:01:30] and say get out of here
[1:01:31] you're not coming back
[1:01:35] he wants to raise up his head take it
[1:01:37] off
[1:01:39] if it took off on monday get ready to
[1:01:41] take it off on tuesday
[1:01:48] thank you hallelujah
[1:01:54] there in the book of revelations he says
[1:01:56] behold
[1:01:58] i make everything new
[1:02:03] god's working the sovereign working
[1:02:08] of god it's not a patch up job
[1:02:13] you know it ain't like you take your
[1:02:15] tire into the store
[1:02:17] and you wonder oh my goodness is the
[1:02:20] tire any good
[1:02:22] and they say now we put some bubble gum
[1:02:24] on it
[1:02:25] or we can put a little bit of i don't
[1:02:27] know what you call that hot and sealed
[1:02:28] stuff or whatever i don't know
[1:02:29] you some of you are a little bit more
[1:02:31] versed in that than me
[1:02:33] it's a patch job you know sooner or
[1:02:35] later
[1:02:36] i better be watching this better not be
[1:02:39] my better not be making you know so many
[1:02:40] trips and i know they guarantee all
[1:02:42] these patch jobs
[1:02:44] you with me they they're guaranteed god
[1:02:48] don't
[1:02:48] bring patch jobs he ain't trying to
[1:02:50] patch your character
[1:02:52] that's not what the working of the holy
[1:02:54] ghost is all about he ain't trying to
[1:02:55] patch you up
[1:02:57] patch it up and make you a patchwork
[1:03:00] quilt
[1:03:02] he's interested in a full display of his
[1:03:05] own life
[1:03:07] and it is the holy spirit that
[1:03:10] works in our life through experiences
[1:03:16] did you know what i said experiences of
[1:03:19] divine grace
[1:03:20] it's the working of the holy spirit that
[1:03:23] is
[1:03:24] moving and he is creating he is making
[1:03:27] all things anew brother iran would take
[1:03:30] that word new and in this scripture here
[1:03:33] in verse 26 he says a new heart also
[1:03:36] will i give you
[1:03:37] and a new spirit will i put within you
[1:03:39] brother braham said that just brings
[1:03:41] such joy to my heart
[1:03:42] you see everything that god does is new
[1:03:49] not recycled sorry tree huggers not
[1:03:52] recycled
[1:03:54] god don't recycle things
[1:03:57] he gives a new heart and a new spirit
[1:04:01] and i will take away the stony heart
[1:04:04] out of your flesh and i will give you a
[1:04:07] heart of flesh and
[1:04:08] the reality is is that no matter how
[1:04:11] what you and i would try to do
[1:04:13] you can't break a stony heart in
[1:04:16] somebody else
[1:04:18] that takes the sovereign work of
[1:04:20] almighty god
[1:04:22] it can take place right in church it can
[1:04:25] take place right
[1:04:26] while they're out there on the highway
[1:04:28] or on the job
[1:04:29] or other place god knows exactly where
[1:04:31] they're at
[1:04:32] amen is that right god knows how to turn
[1:04:35] that stony heart
[1:04:37] remember a stony heart is nothing you
[1:04:39] can sow any seed into
[1:04:41] that's right right well i'm gonna try to
[1:04:43] crack it i'm gonna try to crack it
[1:04:45] words don't crack it right
[1:04:48] well they need this so i'm gonna that
[1:04:51] don't crack it the matter of fact
[1:04:53] that'll make them resent you
[1:04:54] it's a spirit do you understand what i'm
[1:04:56] saying it's a spirit that's on them
[1:05:00] why is it when you go talk to somebody
[1:05:02] and and then you know and maybe you
[1:05:04] start talking about
[1:05:05] things of the lord and they begin to
[1:05:06] resent it you want to know why it's a
[1:05:08] spirit
[1:05:09] amen use discernment within that
[1:05:13] amen you cannot go to battle
[1:05:16] against the spirit with your own wits
[1:05:19] and your own reasoning
[1:05:20] but to recognize there's a greater power
[1:05:23] on the inside of you
[1:05:27] what do i have to do the same way god
[1:05:29] did it for you and i
[1:05:30] he didn't speak to that old character
[1:05:33] that old nature
[1:05:34] god came to call out that desire
[1:05:38] that one that's on the inside that's a
[1:05:40] challenge i said that's a challenge for
[1:05:42] us
[1:05:43] because many times we're looking at all
[1:05:44] the expressions and all these things out
[1:05:46] through here
[1:05:47] but you see the spirit of god makes us
[1:05:49] aware of these things we're dealing with
[1:05:51] spirits
[1:05:55] right it's not the person the spirits
[1:05:59] it doesn't listen to me it does not mean
[1:06:01] they're demon possessed
[1:06:04] it means they are influenced and
[1:06:06] available to that
[1:06:07] influence are you with me
[1:06:11] it doesn't mean they're demon possessed
[1:06:13] yet the devil needs to be cast out
[1:06:16] in other words there needs to come a
[1:06:18] place to there no longer
[1:06:19] is a welcome map that's put out there
[1:06:22] for him
[1:06:26] but god's the one to come down and
[1:06:28] remove the welcome man
[1:06:33] but you see a new heart it's a new way
[1:06:36] of thinking
[1:06:38] it's a new way of thinking you become
[1:06:40] open
[1:06:41] like you all of a sudden you see and we
[1:06:44] could we can all go back into this in
[1:06:46] our own lives
[1:06:47] you see lives all of a sudden they begin
[1:06:49] to become open
[1:06:50] what is it it's god sovereignly working
[1:06:53] because remember god is not going to put
[1:06:55] anybody into a headlock
[1:06:57] god is not going to make nobody serve
[1:06:59] him
[1:07:01] because that's not real servitude
[1:07:04] that's slavery based in fear
[1:07:09] a new spirit is where you begin to quit
[1:07:12] evil in your life
[1:07:15] amen begin to lay it aside
[1:07:18] you begin to recognize you see there's
[1:07:20] something if the spirit of god is
[1:07:22] dealing with your life and you begin to
[1:07:24] recognize
[1:07:25] lay this aside see it's moving in your
[1:07:27] life it's acquitting it's a laying and
[1:07:29] surprise paul said
[1:07:30] lay aside every weight
[1:07:34] things that are slowing you down are
[1:07:36] hindering you
[1:07:37] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:07:40] you let me just say it to you like this
[1:07:42] don't say oh this is hard for me i don't
[1:07:45] know if i can do this
[1:07:46] that might be true because why the
[1:07:49] nature the old nature is still there
[1:07:51] but take the confession of the word the
[1:07:54] bible said in hebrews 3
[1:07:56] he is a high priest that can be touched
[1:07:58] by
[1:07:59] our confession we are to confess what he
[1:08:02] has already done
[1:08:04] there is no nothing you can call into
[1:08:07] question
[1:08:08] in the blood of jesus you cannot say
[1:08:11] that it did not
[1:08:12] meet and suffice the very payment
[1:08:15] that was needed in order to ransom you
[1:08:17] and i brother
[1:08:18] he just did not pay the sin death
[1:08:22] he bought you out of the slave market
[1:08:25] this is what the blood of jesus when it
[1:08:28] was shed for you and i
[1:08:29] that's why when the spirit of god comes
[1:08:32] and deals with our life
[1:08:34] and as he moves in a heart and a life he
[1:08:36] wants he doing
[1:08:37] brother brown would also deal with this
[1:08:39] working and even this time in the new
[1:08:41] heart and new spirit
[1:08:42] here is the holy spirit as the tutor of
[1:08:44] the church
[1:08:45] of the living god are you with me
[1:08:48] it is brother samuel tutoring you it's
[1:08:50] the holy spirit
[1:08:51] he's the one who've been working in your
[1:08:53] life he's the one telling you saying hey
[1:08:55] lay that aside
[1:08:57] lay it aside don't look at oh this has
[1:09:00] always been no no
[1:09:01] hear his voice he's brooding what must i
[1:09:04] say
[1:09:04] yes holy spirit
[1:09:08] you're yielding you're yielding
[1:09:11] he's working and you and you understand
[1:09:15] this even
[1:09:16] the older ones are here you understand
[1:09:17] that this principle never ceases
[1:09:20] it's yielding it's him working
[1:09:26] so don't wrestle with it don't wrestle
[1:09:28] with it
[1:09:29] if dress is an issue don't wrestle with
[1:09:31] it what do i do
[1:09:33] have by faith apply the blood of jesus
[1:09:37] christ
[1:09:37] lord i lay this down in the name of
[1:09:40] jesus christ let me tell you there's
[1:09:42] power in the name of jesus christ
[1:09:45] the bible said if you say to this
[1:09:47] mountain be thou removed
[1:09:48] plucked up and cast into the undersea it
[1:09:51] shall be
[1:09:52] even as thou hast said brother man said
[1:09:55] you may not even see the mountain move
[1:09:56] but it's a grain of sand that has turned
[1:09:59] loose
[1:10:00] and that is a testimony the mountain's
[1:10:02] moving
[1:10:09] so what must i do look paul in that same
[1:10:12] scripture
[1:10:13] looking unto jesus the author
[1:10:16] he who started dealing with your life
[1:10:19] look to him don't get your eyes on
[1:10:20] anything else
[1:10:22] don't get your eyes on yourself keep
[1:10:24] your eyes on him
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:28] now let me let me move into this place
[1:10:31] here
[1:10:32] brother brown would take us over and
[1:10:34] over into the scripture
[1:10:36] right in the midst of where we talk
[1:10:39] about the new heart
[1:10:41] and the new spirit in matthew 12
[1:10:44] 43 when the unclean spirit
[1:10:48] is gone out of a man did you catch that
[1:10:51] it's not cast out
[1:10:52] he goes out willingly what causes the
[1:10:56] spirit to go out willingly
[1:10:58] repentance true repentance
[1:11:02] he does not cast out he goes out
[1:11:07] he walketh through dry
[1:11:10] places seeking rest and
[1:11:14] findeth none then he saith now watch
[1:11:17] this
[1:11:18] i will return into my house
[1:11:23] see this is a house he drank in cursed
[1:11:25] in fornicated in
[1:11:26] did everything in this is my house
[1:11:31] i wasn't kicked out i walked out
[1:11:34] willingly
[1:11:35] amen come on you know how it is
[1:11:38] start talking about the lord at a family
[1:11:40] gathering you get people walking away
[1:11:42] like roaches crawling out when the
[1:11:44] light's been turned on
[1:11:46] you understand what i'm saying you don't
[1:11:47] have to tell them hey i'm going to talk
[1:11:49] about the lord
[1:11:49] get out of here just start talking about
[1:11:51] god
[1:11:52] start talking about it
[1:11:56] is that right see the enemy
[1:12:00] oh i hope you can understand this the
[1:12:02] enemy is not comfortable
[1:12:04] when the word when you begin to tune in
[1:12:06] to what the holy spirit
[1:12:08] is saying to the church when you begin
[1:12:10] to tune into that
[1:12:12] that makes the devil uncomfortable and
[1:12:15] he leaves
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:17] yes
[1:12:21] here's what he said i will return into
[1:12:23] my house
[1:12:25] from whence i not cast out i came out
[1:12:31] and when he has come he
[1:12:34] findeth it empty
[1:12:40] all the things that he had there card
[1:12:42] tables
[1:12:44] everything else he had there let's say
[1:12:47] you know
[1:12:48] make up short skirts and you know even
[1:12:50] the men now with their skinny britches
[1:12:52] and things like that
[1:12:54] come on inspired by homosexuals
[1:12:57] all of the stuff that's out there you
[1:12:58] understand what i'm talking about
[1:13:00] you know he comes he finds it empty oh
[1:13:03] these things are no longer there they've
[1:13:05] been swept
[1:13:06] out not just swept over in the corner
[1:13:08] swept out
[1:13:10] it's been cleaned up it's been garnished
[1:13:18] amen then go with he i want you to watch
[1:13:22] this now
[1:13:24] it didn't say that when he comes to that
[1:13:27] house he sees it like it is
[1:13:29] that he goes right inside but he finds
[1:13:32] it
[1:13:32] that it's empty
[1:13:36] it's empty oh it's sweat it's garnish
[1:13:39] but it's empty
[1:13:40] you know what it means when there's an
[1:13:41] empty house it's available for occupancy
[1:13:45] are you with me a new heart and a new
[1:13:48] spirit
[1:13:49] come on god son i'll give you a new
[1:13:52] heart
[1:13:52] i'll give you a new spirit now notice
[1:13:55] then go with he
[1:13:57] and taketh with himself seven other
[1:14:00] spirits more wicked than himself
[1:14:04] and they enter in and dwell there my so
[1:14:07] now it's not just
[1:14:08] one unclean spirit he he takes with him
[1:14:12] seven other spirits
[1:14:16] and they enter in and they say man this
[1:14:20] is nice
[1:14:22] now they don't come back in let me just
[1:14:23] finish reading the verse
[1:14:25] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:14:27] than the first
[1:14:28] even so shall it be also under this
[1:14:31] wicked generation now let me just tell
[1:14:32] you something
[1:14:34] remember the rebellion that was led in
[1:14:37] heaven
[1:14:38] was not playing rock and roll
[1:14:41] ain't how the angels were led away from
[1:14:44] their first estate
[1:14:45] and when the disco ball got put up there
[1:14:47] come on now
[1:14:48] it wasn't the saloon that got put up
[1:14:50] there it was shaped and told a
[1:14:52] tale a t-a-l-e
[1:14:57] are you with me he preached yeah you're
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:00] are you with me this is why there were
[1:15:03] angels that
[1:15:04] fell they fell with him
[1:15:07] they kept not the bible said kept not
[1:15:09] their first estate
[1:15:11] but you look at those devils those
[1:15:14] demons sure
[1:15:15] we see the debauchery even from now the
[1:15:18] fall
[1:15:18] you see even attributes and whatever
[1:15:20] more of sin
[1:15:21] but this right here if i probably were
[1:15:23] to give this scripture
[1:15:24] to many people and i'm not going to say
[1:15:26] to people here but maybe even for those
[1:15:28] here
[1:15:29] and you would look at this and say man
[1:15:31] more wicked than he's ever been you
[1:15:33] would think man this guy
[1:15:35] he's going to be a drunkard that's going
[1:15:37] around and beating people up
[1:15:39] he's going to be a drug head that's
[1:15:41] going to be doing this no no no no
[1:15:42] that's not at all
[1:15:44] remember when these seven other devils
[1:15:46] come in with this one
[1:15:47] it's not coming back in there to clutter
[1:15:49] the place up
[1:15:50] but it comes back in and it says my you
[1:15:53] know this is nice
[1:15:54] this place has been covered up but
[1:15:56] actually what they do
[1:15:58] they move upon that person and say you
[1:16:00] know what
[1:16:01] you're good you're fine look at you you
[1:16:03] used to be a drunkard you don't drink no
[1:16:05] more yeah
[1:16:06] it's all right i mean you don't have to
[1:16:07] go along with that real what they're
[1:16:09] talking about the holy ghost look at you
[1:16:11] your life is better than it's ever been
[1:16:14] why is that what is the more wickedness
[1:16:16] this is the words
[1:16:17] of the prophet coming in this word in
[1:16:19] this hour
[1:16:20] he says it actually becomes a religious
[1:16:24] devil where you can't tell them nothing
[1:16:27] where they become satisfied he says a
[1:16:29] matter of fact
[1:16:30] they become haters of god they despise
[1:16:33] the
[1:16:34] word challenging their life they look at
[1:16:36] it and say that's not necessary
[1:16:38] that don't need to be and yet you could
[1:16:41] maybe look at the life and say
[1:16:42] well man i used to know them they were a
[1:16:44] drug header there was a prostitute
[1:16:46] or it was this or was that and look at
[1:16:48] them their life is cleaned up but then
[1:16:50] when you begin to look at it a little
[1:16:52] longer you realize
[1:16:54] it's not a real beating of the holy
[1:16:56] ghost
[1:16:57] by the love of god on the inside it's a
[1:17:00] religious
[1:17:01] devil
[1:17:04] it is the worst kind it's the worst kind
[1:17:08] i would rather
[1:17:08] any day to deal with a prostitute
[1:17:12] a drunkard or anybody else than a
[1:17:14] religious devil
[1:17:15] even those who said in message churches
[1:17:17] i'd rather deal
[1:17:18] with that
[1:17:23] that's a dangerous place to be in
[1:17:25] because you know why
[1:17:27] the new heart and the new spirit is not
[1:17:29] the holy spirit
[1:17:31] but it is what god has gifted look god
[1:17:34] has
[1:17:34] gifted that new heart you realize before
[1:17:36] you could ever repent
[1:17:37] i just read the opening scripture it's
[1:17:39] the grace of god not of works
[1:17:41] lest any man should both but it actually
[1:17:44] is the gifting
[1:17:45] of divine grace that we have not merited
[1:17:48] or earned but grace has gifted to you
[1:17:51] and i
[1:17:52] that our faith oh my our faith was in
[1:17:54] shambles and everywhere else
[1:17:56] but remember god will not override our
[1:17:58] faith he will not work contrary to our
[1:18:00] faith
[1:18:01] but god comes to energize our faith over
[1:18:04] and over in the scripture remember
[1:18:05] daughter thy faith has healed thee
[1:18:07] daughter thy faith hath healed me
[1:18:09] my son by faith what is it it's god
[1:18:12] coming and
[1:18:13] moving behind that faith and moving the
[1:18:15] faith
[1:18:16] into a place to actually believe the
[1:18:18] things that god
[1:18:19] is desiring to do within our life so
[1:18:22] it's truly a gift
[1:18:23] of almighty god it's god's grace to you
[1:18:26] and i
[1:18:27] now when you think of it remember the
[1:18:29] holy spirit himself
[1:18:31] even as you would take another type it's
[1:18:33] like a husband and a wife or let's say
[1:18:35] you know a a couple that is courting
[1:18:38] dating
[1:18:39] and here they are you know they become
[1:18:41] interested in one another
[1:18:42] they become attracted to one another
[1:18:44] they've not yet made their vows their
[1:18:46] commitment
[1:18:47] the proposals not been made and accepted
[1:18:50] there's not been an engagement
[1:18:51] because the engagement itself is
[1:18:53] actually the new birth
[1:18:54] of the holy ghost are you with me the
[1:18:57] courtship itself is where god
[1:18:59] is dealing with that heart god is
[1:19:00] calling to that heart now think about it
[1:19:03] what man or what woman really what would
[1:19:05] you want to would you want to marry
[1:19:07] somebody that you're arguing with the
[1:19:08] whole time
[1:19:09] you're disagreeing with the whole time
[1:19:11] there's fussing and fighting going on
[1:19:12] the whole time
[1:19:13] every time you go out on a date it's
[1:19:15] always fussing and fighting and carrying
[1:19:17] on
[1:19:17] somebody disagree remember marriage
[1:19:19] don't change that
[1:19:20] marriage itself just makes it to where
[1:19:22] you're duking at one another right in
[1:19:24] the same house all the time
[1:19:25] are you with me this is the same way
[1:19:27] that the holy spirit
[1:19:29] he is not going to come into a place
[1:19:31] that's disagreeable
[1:19:32] and that is like a wolf he comes to that
[1:19:35] which becomes
[1:19:36] lamb-like one that actually can be led
[1:19:40] one that is actually you know being
[1:19:42] tamed and being
[1:19:43] moved upon by the spirit of god and is
[1:19:45] welcoming to his working
[1:19:47] this is what he will come to
[1:19:51] now we recognize that within any natural
[1:19:54] birth there's three stages you cannot
[1:19:57] skip a stage
[1:19:58] and there be a birth we realize it's
[1:20:02] justification
[1:20:03] it's sanctification and then the baptism
[1:20:06] of the holy ghost
[1:20:07] i have all three of them are workings of
[1:20:10] the same spirit
[1:20:12] it's god working to bring a person in
[1:20:14] justification
[1:20:16] to repentance to recognize that there
[1:20:19] indeed the lamb of god has been offered
[1:20:21] on their behalf
[1:20:22] and their sin debt is paid and that they
[1:20:25] indeed can be
[1:20:27] forgiven because you can't approach
[1:20:31] you can't approach him if you don't know
[1:20:33] you've been forgiven
[1:20:35] are you with me that's just even the
[1:20:37] first step
[1:20:38] just to be forgiven then we find within
[1:20:43] that you know it's just like
[1:20:44] when a woman goes to give birth the
[1:20:46] water breaks that's how that you know
[1:20:47] the brothers know
[1:20:48] it's time to go it's time to go the
[1:20:51] water has broke it's time to go what is
[1:20:53] that justification
[1:20:54] it's time to go it's making ready man
[1:20:57] it's getting close
[1:20:58] then you find the blood begins to come
[1:21:00] forth
[1:21:01] now as we're there within that birth
[1:21:04] we're going into a place listen to me
[1:21:06] we're going to a place where children
[1:21:09] are born is that right
[1:21:13] no matter it's in there it is within the
[1:21:15] womb but in order
[1:21:17] for that child to actually come forth
[1:21:20] into birth
[1:21:20] it must actually come forth and take
[1:21:23] that breath of life
[1:21:25] and then it begins to express it begins
[1:21:28] to develop
[1:21:29] it begins to grow when after it
[1:21:32] is born are you with me i know you know
[1:21:35] i've gotten speaking to some sisters
[1:21:37] that you know they're
[1:21:38] they're they're in couples they're
[1:21:39] expecting right now and you know you
[1:21:41] finally get to a spot i know how my wife
[1:21:42] and i were
[1:21:43] you know well not me but my wife you
[1:21:45] know but you understand what i'm saying
[1:21:47] it'd get to a place and finally she said
[1:21:48] man i'm telling you what i can't wait
[1:21:50] for zachary to get here i can't wait for
[1:21:52] paul
[1:21:52] or benjamin i mean to get here because
[1:21:54] because what it is
[1:21:55] the the child itself it grew inside the
[1:21:58] womb
[1:21:59] but it grew as much as it could grow
[1:22:02] within that place and it needed to be
[1:22:05] released let me just tell you
[1:22:07] it's the working of the holy spirit that
[1:22:10] is moving on a life
[1:22:12] he's growing and developing he's working
[1:22:14] until finally
[1:22:16] the heart says lord i want to be full of
[1:22:19] the holy ghost
[1:22:20] i want to be born again lord
[1:22:26] because we don't want to have stillbirth
[1:22:28] we don't want it we do want premature
[1:22:29] birth
[1:22:30] we want everything to be in the term the
[1:22:32] time the season
[1:22:34] amen now in first john 5 6 let's pick
[1:22:37] this
[1:22:38] up this is he now notice how john would
[1:22:40] write this
[1:22:41] this is he that came by water and blood
[1:22:45] notice how john
[1:22:46] would draw that to you and i by water
[1:22:48] and blood
[1:22:50] even jesus christ not by water only
[1:22:53] but by water and blood notice him
[1:22:54] re-emphasizing it
[1:22:56] because if he came by water only
[1:22:59] it's still sinful blood right yeah
[1:23:02] if he came by water only everyone
[1:23:05] everyone else
[1:23:06] came by water only but he is setting up
[1:23:09] here
[1:23:09] by divine inspiration that there has
[1:23:12] come
[1:23:12] water and blood what is in the blood
[1:23:14] within the blood is the dna
[1:23:17] is the life that's what we're talking
[1:23:19] about god
[1:23:20] wrapped himself in the creative
[1:23:23] blood cell all other blood was polluted
[1:23:27] there wasn't any man could redeem you
[1:23:30] and i
[1:23:30] i don't care how righteous he was how
[1:23:33] holy he was
[1:23:34] it was all together filthy reds before
[1:23:38] him
[1:23:38] amen it required god
[1:23:42] becoming a kinsman redeemer
[1:23:48] is he that came not with water only
[1:23:51] hallelujah but my water
[1:23:54] and blood amen amen
[1:24:01] he had to get himself a son
[1:24:05] because his son is who packs the
[1:24:07] father's name
[1:24:09] are you with me he packs the life of the
[1:24:11] father he's back in the genealogy
[1:24:14] right jesus said i am come in my
[1:24:16] father's name
[1:24:17] hallelujah right he came not by water
[1:24:20] and blood
[1:24:20] so what is it it's god coming under that
[1:24:24] family name here
[1:24:25] his life wrapped into the blood because
[1:24:28] there are more
[1:24:30] of his children sons and daughters
[1:24:33] real seed that they are trapped in that
[1:24:36] first birth
[1:24:37] and they need a deliverance through
[1:24:40] the blood cell where it pays the debt
[1:24:44] and releases the life in that blood cell
[1:24:48] to come back upon the worshiper when i
[1:24:51] say come back upon the worshiper
[1:24:53] not just here not just in the spirit
[1:24:56] your mind
[1:24:58] but to come and bring transformation
[1:25:03] on the inside
[1:25:06] for there are three what look how this
[1:25:08] goes
[1:25:10] let me let me finish that verse it's
[1:25:12] kind of like you know somebody taking
[1:25:13] away the plate and there's still a
[1:25:15] a morsel of cake there it is the spirit
[1:25:18] that beareth
[1:25:19] witness notice who beareth witness the
[1:25:21] spirit
[1:25:22] because the spirit is truth
[1:25:25] for there are three that bear record
[1:25:28] in heaven the father the word
[1:25:32] and the holy ghost three
[1:25:36] that bear record in heaven and these
[1:25:39] three
[1:25:40] are one not one like this
[1:25:43] like this it's three
[1:25:47] attributes of the same god amen
[1:25:51] thank you lord you're like brother drake
[1:25:53] you are a son
[1:25:55] to your father and your mother then
[1:25:58] you get married you become a husband
[1:26:02] then here you have children you have
[1:26:04] little draken
[1:26:05] that a little one that's that's on the
[1:26:07] way but what's your name
[1:26:09] your name is not husband your name is
[1:26:11] not son your name is not father
[1:26:14] your name is drake savage you are the
[1:26:17] same
[1:26:17] person manifesting in three different
[1:26:20] offices
[1:26:22] are you with me that's the revelation of
[1:26:25] jesus christ
[1:26:26] it was god become flesh
[1:26:31] the father who was above us he now came
[1:26:34] on
[1:26:35] and he created a body that he himself
[1:26:38] could come and dwell in
[1:26:40] a blood that he could pay the price that
[1:26:42] you and i could have confidence and say
[1:26:44] i repent of my sins i believe
[1:26:48] in the justification of god he had
[1:26:50] raised from the grave
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:53] and then the holy ghost who's the holy
[1:26:55] ghost the same god who came down amen
[1:27:05] that's why we don't baptize
[1:27:08] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:27:10] of the holy ghost yet we do
[1:27:16] the name of what's his name
[1:27:20] jesus the lord jesus christ
[1:27:26] all right there's a lot of husbands here
[1:27:30] a lot of fathers here
[1:27:32] a lot of sons here but there's only one
[1:27:34] brian hannah
[1:27:35] at least here tonight
[1:27:39] these three are one and there are three
[1:27:42] that bear witness
[1:27:44] in earth notice in earth these bear
[1:27:47] witness
[1:27:48] the spirit the water and the blood
[1:27:52] and these three agree
[1:27:55] in one notice it didn't say they are one
[1:27:58] they agree in one this
[1:28:01] is the sovereign working of god
[1:28:05] to bring a life unto himself
[1:28:11] to cleanse that life and to place
[1:28:14] his life in us
[1:28:20] is that all right
[1:28:24] see that unclean spirit when it goes out
[1:28:26] this is where
[1:28:27] brother brown is as he's laboring by the
[1:28:30] spirit of god
[1:28:31] he says what you find is this where
[1:28:34] it comes to place its intellectual
[1:28:37] conception
[1:28:39] now once you remember intellect just
[1:28:40] does not mean that a person is smart
[1:28:43] and that they're dry and formal
[1:28:46] no no no no intellect is a mind
[1:28:50] mind is connected to your spirit they
[1:28:52] can be dry
[1:28:53] and formal or they can be emotional
[1:28:57] are you with me that's that's the spirit
[1:28:59] realm
[1:29:00] are you with me that's a spirit realm
[1:29:02] this is why the prophet was
[1:29:04] letting us know it's not just emotion do
[1:29:06] we believe in shouting the church said
[1:29:08] amen do we believe in speaking in
[1:29:10] tongues
[1:29:11] do we believe in running jumping yeah
[1:29:13] amen we believe in all of that
[1:29:16] but we want to make sure what it is
[1:29:18] there's got to be a life that after
[1:29:20] all the emotion is done
[1:29:24] there's a life that is present outside
[1:29:28] of church
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:35] you see these are the precious
[1:29:38] parts that which belongs to us as a
[1:29:41] children of god
[1:29:42] see brother brown would take this in the
[1:29:45] message future home
[1:29:46] because remember this earth
[1:29:50] is a redeemable attribute of god the
[1:29:52] earth is groaning and travailing
[1:29:56] the earth prior to the fall in eden
[1:30:00] the earth was under the control of a son
[1:30:07] and daughter of god
[1:30:12] there was no fear
[1:30:15] there was no sin and the earth was
[1:30:19] bringing forth
[1:30:21] in its beauty it was bringing forth
[1:30:26] was no death but then after the fall
[1:30:30] come god said
[1:30:33] this earth will bring forth thorns and
[1:30:35] thistles unto you
[1:30:39] you will you will labor by the sweat of
[1:30:42] your brown
[1:30:43] before that time it was not the sweat of
[1:30:44] the brah
[1:30:47] did adam have to tend to things yes did
[1:30:49] he have to lay was he labor yeah but not
[1:30:51] according to how we think laboring
[1:30:54] how was he laboring by the word by the
[1:30:56] word
[1:30:57] the same way it comes to you and i right
[1:30:59] now where there's things the holy spirit
[1:31:01] deals with in our life
[1:31:02] how we labor by the word
[1:31:05] yes lord be it unto me and we're
[1:31:08] depending
[1:31:09] on the transforming power that's in the
[1:31:12] word
[1:31:15] so the earth is groaning paul writes
[1:31:19] right the bible talks in genesis 6 the
[1:31:22] earth was filled
[1:31:23] with violence
[1:31:28] and god anoints
[1:31:31] a man by the name of noah
[1:31:36] noah being a prophet he was able to see
[1:31:38] paul said in hebrews 11
[1:31:40] he was able to see the judgment that was
[1:31:43] coming
[1:31:44] but as he saw god showed him the
[1:31:46] judgment within that judgment god spoke
[1:31:48] mercy
[1:31:50] prepare an ark for the saving of your
[1:31:52] household
[1:31:56] and what did moses want to know preach
[1:31:58] peter picks it up
[1:31:59] he preached repentance repent
[1:32:03] repent and what happened here come the
[1:32:06] waters
[1:32:08] it wasn't just rain coming down the
[1:32:10] bible said the fountains of the deep
[1:32:11] were broke up
[1:32:13] they were walking and men were walking
[1:32:15] all around despising
[1:32:16] noah's message and they failed to
[1:32:18] recognize the earth standing in and out
[1:32:20] of water they failed to recognize
[1:32:22] that they were walking right there
[1:32:23] judgment was right there
[1:32:26] and what did god do he baptized
[1:32:29] the earth
[1:32:33] the waters covered the face
[1:32:37] of the earth this is why we don't
[1:32:40] sprinkle it's a complete
[1:32:45] submersion not just because of the earth
[1:32:48] that
[1:32:48] that water baptism is a testimony we're
[1:32:51] not even leaving out the nose of the
[1:32:53] individual
[1:32:54] it is a going into a grave
[1:32:57] what are we doing burying you don't bury
[1:33:00] live people
[1:33:02] you don't bury live people you bury
[1:33:06] dead people is that right
[1:33:09] you bury dead people and when they're
[1:33:12] baptized
[1:33:13] they are showing a clear conscience they
[1:33:15] are showing
[1:33:16] a work is taking place inside of their
[1:33:20] life
[1:33:20] they are heeding to the calling of the
[1:33:23] holy spirit
[1:33:26] buried in his likeness
[1:33:30] buried in his likeness he was buried
[1:33:33] in the grave but then
[1:33:36] he was raised in the newness of life
[1:33:41] amen you see the the walking into the
[1:33:43] waters of baptism the water doesn't
[1:33:45] change anybody
[1:33:48] well what is it it's this it's it's a
[1:33:50] declaring
[1:33:51] you're taking upon his name i'm
[1:33:53] identifying with his name i have
[1:33:55] repented
[1:33:56] of my sins and i believe i am forgiven
[1:33:59] these are tied together repentance and
[1:34:02] baptism
[1:34:05] see this is why
[1:34:09] in the heart let me finish this point
[1:34:13] and then i'll close
[1:34:16] this is why in the heart
[1:34:19] a inside the human heart a person
[1:34:23] they can come and they repent
[1:34:26] they repent and they can repent of their
[1:34:28] sin they're convicted
[1:34:30] by the holy spirit like it was on the
[1:34:32] day of pentecost they were convicted
[1:34:34] listen this is why if preaching alone
[1:34:36] won't do it it takes the holy ghost to
[1:34:38] bring conviction
[1:34:42] the holy ghost brings conviction to
[1:34:43] hearts
[1:34:45] and when that repentance notice what
[1:34:47] takes place
[1:34:48] when that repentance comes forth and
[1:34:50] they say lord forgive me
[1:34:53] have mercy upon me lord jesus
[1:34:56] i i repent of my sin you don't have to
[1:35:00] go through and name everything
[1:35:01] because remember behold the lamb of god
[1:35:03] it takes away the sin
[1:35:04] of the world all the other things are
[1:35:07] attributes
[1:35:08] but you have to say lord forgive me i'm
[1:35:11] a sinner lord
[1:35:12] i repent of my wrong lord i want you to
[1:35:15] be my lord and
[1:35:17] savior of my life
[1:35:20] you've got to make a stand upon it not
[1:35:23] just walk around with it and look let me
[1:35:24] just tell you something
[1:35:26] don't look at it and say i don't know if
[1:35:28] i can do it or not
[1:35:29] you listen it's not you that has brought
[1:35:32] you to even a place
[1:35:33] to consider this it is the working the
[1:35:36] sovereign
[1:35:37] working of the holy ghost
[1:35:41] what should i do let go and let
[1:35:44] god have his way amen
[1:35:51] once that forgiveness you see the
[1:35:53] forgiven
[1:35:54] but the snake it's still there in that
[1:35:58] heart
[1:36:00] what's a snake it's that old sinful
[1:36:02] nature
[1:36:03] it's what made you do it it's like
[1:36:07] you go around pulling pulling weeds out
[1:36:09] of a flower bed
[1:36:11] you know how it is if you don't get the
[1:36:13] root you better watch it it's going to
[1:36:15] come right back
[1:36:16] because you snapped it off when you
[1:36:18] listen to me now all of us been there
[1:36:21] i try to get the roots out sometimes i
[1:36:23] can't get them out
[1:36:26] do you go get a tool and get them out
[1:36:28] when it comes to spiritual things i want
[1:36:30] a tool
[1:36:31] but sometimes i get a little lazy in the
[1:36:32] natural and say now i'll go back and get
[1:36:34] it next time
[1:36:37] next few days with a cup of coffee
[1:36:39] around i'll get it
[1:36:41] but by saying i'm looking because you
[1:36:43] know why i know look right there
[1:36:45] because there's a root ball going with
[1:36:46] the surface but when i snap it off
[1:36:49] it looks pretty nice man that brown
[1:36:51] mulch and there ain't no dandelion
[1:36:53] sticking up
[1:36:53] there ain't no clover growing in it man
[1:36:55] it looks real nice but there's still
[1:36:57] roots there
[1:36:57] that's right oh hell it looks wonderful
[1:37:00] when a heart
[1:37:01] has come to the lord and they've
[1:37:02] repented of their sins
[1:37:04] that's tremendous that's a wonderful
[1:37:07] thing it's a wonderful thing
[1:37:08] when a person actually feels
[1:37:12] the load of sin lifted from their life
[1:37:14] they've repented
[1:37:15] you say what is that that's a
[1:37:17] supernatural
[1:37:19] experience of divine grace
[1:37:22] in justification
[1:37:28] then you can you can begin to walk up to
[1:37:31] walk
[1:37:31] up to him and walk up before him you've
[1:37:33] got some confidence
[1:37:35] in his working amen you felt that load
[1:37:38] what you feel is
[1:37:39] the load he already bore away
[1:37:43] you you're feeling what he already took
[1:37:45] and
[1:37:46] dropped in the lowest hell
[1:37:50] that's what you're experiencing
[1:37:53] so that snake is still there that root
[1:37:58] you're forgiven of your sins but the
[1:38:00] forgiveness of sins doesn't take away
[1:38:02] the snake
[1:38:05] it's still there that's the root of evil
[1:38:08] this is where repentance and baptism in
[1:38:10] the name of jesus christ
[1:38:12] he forgives our sins
[1:38:16] now then comes sanctification
[1:38:20] brother brown just simply puts it in
[1:38:21] this way it's the setting of our mind
[1:38:24] in order for holiness to think right
[1:38:30] holiness dress
[1:38:33] and it's not just dress it's actions
[1:38:37] he deals with lust he deals with malice
[1:38:40] he deals with envy he deals with ev why
[1:38:44] it's the spirit of truth bringing
[1:38:47] us in to the truth
[1:38:50] who is the truth not a doctrine not a
[1:38:54] church
[1:38:54] jesus said i am the way
[1:38:58] the truth and the life
[1:39:04] so it sets our mind in order for
[1:39:06] holiness
[1:39:07] you begin to think
[1:39:11] about the things that's going on oh i
[1:39:13] shouldn't do this
[1:39:15] oh i shouldn't do that well i shouldn't
[1:39:17] do this what is it sanctification
[1:39:18] working
[1:39:20] it's setting our mind this is the bible
[1:39:23] well i want to see more of god the bible
[1:39:25] says without
[1:39:26] holiness no man shall see god
[1:39:29] you want you want to see more of god
[1:39:31] become the way of holiness
[1:39:33] the bible says in the book of isaiah
[1:39:35] there will be a highway
[1:39:39] not a highway like this out here this is
[1:39:40] two-way traffic right
[1:39:42] there is not a two-way traffic when you
[1:39:45] were going to heaven it's a one-way
[1:39:47] amendment with me the bible said there
[1:39:51] will be a highway
[1:39:52] and it goes on to say there will be a
[1:39:54] way
[1:39:55] in the middle of the highway
[1:39:59] it shall be called the way of holiness
[1:40:04] when is it it's god his creation amen
[1:40:09] it's him working and you're walking
[1:40:12] you're walking
[1:40:13] you're walking you're walking walking in
[1:40:15] the way
[1:40:16] god's dealing with your life your mind
[1:40:19] your heart
[1:40:20] all of it's set there within
[1:40:22] sanctification and god is
[1:40:23] moving the things out of your life now i
[1:40:26] want you to understand this i have to
[1:40:28] pause your moment
[1:40:31] these parts there is
[1:40:34] no time frame
[1:40:37] such as this takes place this day or
[1:40:40] this month
[1:40:40] then you gotta wait for another month
[1:40:42] then you gotta no no no
[1:40:44] this can take place all at once
[1:40:49] even before a person walks into the
[1:40:51] water baptism
[1:40:53] in the book of acts there were those
[1:40:56] when peter spoke at the house of
[1:40:58] cornelius they were
[1:41:00] full filled with the holy ghost
[1:41:04] then they walked into the waters of
[1:41:05] baptism
[1:41:07] same thing in acts 19 when paul went
[1:41:09] through the upper coast of ephesus
[1:41:12] is that right you see it's not a time
[1:41:14] limit
[1:41:15] or a time frame but i want to just i
[1:41:18] i need just a few more moments because
[1:41:21] within it
[1:41:22] here it's setting our mind in order for
[1:41:25] holiness
[1:41:26] it's where you become aware of things
[1:41:29] maybe it's as i said i'm just trying to
[1:41:30] be very simple
[1:41:32] as god is bringing it here nothing we
[1:41:34] want to be deep anyhow we want it to be
[1:41:35] simple where you can
[1:41:36] put it in your lunch box and pack it
[1:41:38] with you but it's things that god brings
[1:41:40] to your attention
[1:41:41] it can it can be things addressed it
[1:41:43] deals with malice envy strife and
[1:41:45] all these other things is god dealing
[1:41:47] with a life
[1:41:48] to lay this aside lay this aside lay
[1:41:50] this aside it's god working and
[1:41:52] preparing
[1:41:54] and i want you to just take this as well
[1:41:57] he's working with your life
[1:41:59] you're not alone
[1:42:03] but saying i'm not in church you're not
[1:42:05] alone
[1:42:06] he's working with your life
[1:42:10] with a new heart a new spirit he's
[1:42:12] working
[1:42:14] then the next thing that comes is
[1:42:18] the baptism of fire and holy ghost
[1:42:22] it's the fire of god cleansing our
[1:42:25] hearts
[1:42:26] from sin and puts the holy ghost
[1:42:29] inside us then we bring forth the same
[1:42:33] life
[1:42:33] that this did because that's in us
[1:42:39] so it's not when the holy ghost has come
[1:42:44] it's not a struggle
[1:42:47] to live a christian life
[1:42:50] it moves from a mind of holiness
[1:42:54] it moves from the intellectual to the
[1:42:57] subconscious
[1:43:00] are you with me it's just like right now
[1:43:04] you get in the car
[1:43:07] you don't have to think about i mean
[1:43:09] unless you get a new car and you gotta
[1:43:12] but even driving even in your house
[1:43:16] you can walk around in the dark do you
[1:43:19] have to work
[1:43:20] look and say oh let me see
[1:43:23] how much is the step here well let me
[1:43:25] see when you go to somebody else's house
[1:43:27] i could say
[1:43:28] hey hey watch the step the first one's a
[1:43:30] little higher than the others
[1:43:32] i have to tell you that because you've
[1:43:33] never been there right but if you live
[1:43:35] there long enough
[1:43:36] you get used to it you don't even have
[1:43:39] to think about it you just make
[1:43:40] adjustments
[1:43:41] as things come amen
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:48] and i will put my spirit
[1:43:53] within you and calls you
[1:43:56] to walk in my statues i'm closing
[1:44:00] okay i'm closing because i i want i
[1:44:03] i just i want this just to just to
[1:44:07] settle out right here
[1:44:08] i will put my spirit within you so he's
[1:44:11] given us a new heart
[1:44:12] a new spirit took away the stony heart
[1:44:16] of the flesh the stony heart does this i
[1:44:18] don't want nothing to do with this
[1:44:22] how much longer is this going to be
[1:44:25] but a new heart and a new spirit it
[1:44:28] becomes
[1:44:29] open to the things of god right right
[1:44:33] it becomes open to the things of god
[1:44:38] but a new spirit is not the holy spirit
[1:44:41] but it is a work of it amen remember a
[1:44:44] new spirit
[1:44:45] it comes into a place and pressures can
[1:44:47] come
[1:44:52] you believe what what is it you believe
[1:44:55] well you know i mean
[1:45:00] my church teaches an hour to wear
[1:45:02] dresses
[1:45:04] new spirit
[1:45:07] my church believes we ought to have long
[1:45:10] hair new spirit
[1:45:11] all right because when you really get
[1:45:14] the holy spirit
[1:45:16] it ain't that you got to know where it's
[1:45:17] at in the word but you can just let them
[1:45:20] know
[1:45:20] i found a treasure amen
[1:45:24] i found something that's so much greater
[1:45:26] than cutting my
[1:45:29] a hair can say i found so much something
[1:45:31] so much greater than lust and
[1:45:33] pornography and all running around and
[1:45:35] all that i found something
[1:45:37] so much greater what do you mean you
[1:45:40] don't drink no more
[1:45:43] no you know the surgeon general and the
[1:45:45] cdc
[1:45:46] said this week that uh that whoever
[1:45:49] would drink a little bit
[1:45:50] uh it would could really damage their
[1:45:52] liver new
[1:45:54] spirit but when you really
[1:45:59] look i'm not trying to pin things down
[1:46:01] on evidences what the whole thing that
[1:46:02] i'm
[1:46:03] we're trying to bring within that is
[1:46:05] that
[1:46:06] your focus is on him
[1:46:09] who is occupying your life
[1:46:13] you're not ashamed of him it don't mean
[1:46:15] that you got the bible out and you can
[1:46:16] tell them
[1:46:17] this is exactly right here go to chapter
[1:46:18] so and so go to this right here no no no
[1:46:20] it ain't about you having a bible study
[1:46:22] it's about your life being a study that
[1:46:24] reflects the bible
[1:46:29] let's plan and then i'll share a few
[1:46:32] more things
[1:46:36] you see this is where i want you to see
[1:46:37] this just for more it's very important i
[1:46:39] want you to hear this
[1:46:40] he says and i'll cause you to walk in my
[1:46:43] statutes
[1:46:44] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:46:46] them this is not
[1:46:47] and once you stand calls you it doesn't
[1:46:49] mean brother trevor it doesn't mean he's
[1:46:51] putting you in a headlock and saying
[1:46:52] come on you gotta do this you say oh
[1:46:55] lord
[1:46:55] oh lord oh i better do this
[1:46:58] if i don't do this let the lord he'll
[1:47:00] get me i might go to hell no no that's
[1:47:02] not what this is
[1:47:04] he's talking about i will come in you
[1:47:10] and i will live
[1:47:13] my life through you
[1:47:18] that's what his promise is see this is
[1:47:21] this is his focus this is what he
[1:47:23] desires for us
[1:47:24] and let me let me say this here i'm
[1:47:27] wrapping it up
[1:47:29] this when a person stops
[1:47:33] and they stop i don't need to do all
[1:47:36] that
[1:47:37] i don't need to do this you know people
[1:47:40] tell you
[1:47:40] well what's brother saying they're
[1:47:42] talking about i love god
[1:47:44] you can love him with your human spirit
[1:47:47] but that ain't the love of god
[1:47:51] when you love god it's from your soul
[1:47:55] and it's because the love of god is in
[1:47:57] you it's not you
[1:47:59] loving god it's the love of god in you
[1:48:03] loving him that's how you're able to
[1:48:07] pray for those who despitefully use you
[1:48:11] that's how you're able to love those who
[1:48:13] hate you
[1:48:15] why it's not our human level failed
[1:48:17] let's just be honest
[1:48:18] our human love says you did me wrong
[1:48:22] but agape love doesn't mean i'm going to
[1:48:24] go out and have lunch
[1:48:26] but agape love says that's my brother my
[1:48:28] sister or
[1:48:29] agape love can say you know what that
[1:48:31] man or that woman they're a sinner
[1:48:33] like i was right
[1:48:37] see that's one element right now it's
[1:48:38] gone from the world
[1:48:42] they have everything right now that's
[1:48:43] going on people are drawing lines don't
[1:48:44] you cross my line
[1:48:46] don't you do this don't you do that but
[1:48:48] are you ain't doing this and better you
[1:48:49] ain't doing that
[1:48:50] that's the spirit of the world
[1:48:56] but the real spirit of god on the inside
[1:48:59] i don't mean that some of us
[1:49:00] remember many times listen friends
[1:49:02] sometimes they're a trap or whatever you
[1:49:03] can fall in but i want you to understand
[1:49:05] this right here
[1:49:05] what it comes down to is that agape love
[1:49:08] is so much higher than filial
[1:49:11] agape love can pray for that man's soul
[1:49:13] to know
[1:49:14] or that woman is because it knows
[1:49:16] they're shackled
[1:49:18] they're bound that boss that would run
[1:49:21] you down
[1:49:23] that family member that would run you
[1:49:24] down it doesn't mean that
[1:49:26] feeling of love you're like oh oh i just
[1:49:29] i just love being around are you kidding
[1:49:32] you don't love being around that
[1:49:34] don't be hypocritical with it let agape
[1:49:36] rain
[1:49:40] the bible says live peaceably
[1:49:44] with as much that life within you
[1:49:47] so that tells me you need to have
[1:49:49] discernment there's just some people
[1:49:51] you don't need to be sitting at the
[1:49:52] lunch table with
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] they're big mouths and everything else
[1:49:56] arrogant indifferent and so forth
[1:49:59] you what's what's the best thing well
[1:50:01] but at the same time i'm not really
[1:50:02] being a christian no you're being a
[1:50:04] christian
[1:50:05] you're using real wisdom that's what
[1:50:08] you're doing
[1:50:10] you don't have to clown for the devil
[1:50:12] you don't have to prove anything
[1:50:14] you can be away from the person but if
[1:50:16] in your heart you say lord
[1:50:20] help that man help that woman
[1:50:24] maybe they had a bad day maybe there's
[1:50:25] something going on maybe there's things
[1:50:26] in their life
[1:50:30] you see it becomes a new heart and a new
[1:50:33] spirit
[1:50:33] it becomes an impersonation and each of
[1:50:37] us know that in term
[1:50:38] impersonation
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:45] you could try to impersonate me to try
[1:50:47] to impersonate somebody else
[1:50:50] when you try to impersonate you're not
[1:50:52] being yourself
[1:50:56] an impersonation listen with a new heart
[1:50:59] and a new spirit a person is trying
[1:51:03] to live the christian life and if they
[1:51:06] stop right there and say
[1:51:07] well i can do this i can do it i can do
[1:51:11] this
[1:51:11] you know what it is it's a new heart and
[1:51:14] a new spirit
[1:51:15] and they're impersonating everything
[1:51:18] that they do
[1:51:19] every walk every move they make you
[1:51:21] might say
[1:51:22] wow there's t's crossed eyes dotted
[1:51:25] wow this but if it's not
[1:51:29] here it's an impersonation
[1:51:34] god comes with a new spirit
[1:51:38] a new heart and then he puts his spirit
[1:51:42] on the inside
[1:51:46] then it's no longer an impersonation
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:52] let me just say this i'm saying this to
[1:51:54] those on the internet and everybody
[1:51:57] and i hope if somebody's walking around
[1:51:59] their house right now and you think this
[1:52:00] is a time to get up for a drink
[1:52:02] i hope it's a time that the spirit of
[1:52:04] god brings conviction to your heart
[1:52:06] so that you understand it's not enough
[1:52:09] to walk around and say well i don't
[1:52:10] understand everything
[1:52:11] i don't know i don't understand that's a
[1:52:13] cop-out that's an excuse
[1:52:15] what i'm preaching right now and what i
[1:52:18] always have preached
[1:52:19] the whole time where god the very first
[1:52:22] message i ever preached
[1:52:23] august 1st 1996 first message
[1:52:27] god's witness
[1:52:30] you remember that brother bill god's
[1:52:31] witness went through elijah elisha
[1:52:34] acts 2 was talking about the life
[1:52:37] having the life the message is not about
[1:52:41] doctrines
[1:52:43] you can know all the feasts know all the
[1:52:45] seals know all of that and don't know
[1:52:47] him
[1:52:50] it's him it's a life it is to lead us
[1:52:55] into a union with
[1:52:58] jesus christ
[1:53:01] that's what it's about it's not don't
[1:53:03] allow the devil to make it complicated
[1:53:05] so if in your heart you can say i don't
[1:53:08] understand all this
[1:53:09] i don't understand all that just say
[1:53:10] lord reveal yourself to me
[1:53:12] make yourself available say god i want
[1:53:16] more than what i've got right now
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:21] i know i'm preaching to hearts that'll
[1:53:23] pass from death unto life
[1:53:25] i know i preach in the hearts that that
[1:53:27] they have a full work in their life
[1:53:29] and i also know i'm preaching to hearts
[1:53:32] whether as here
[1:53:33] on the internet the archive i know that
[1:53:35] that i'm preaching the hearts
[1:53:36] that have stopped at a new spirit
[1:53:40] but i'm not angry with you god's not
[1:53:42] angry he's not trying to humiliate he's
[1:53:44] trying to uncover
[1:53:46] where satan is trying to keep you
[1:53:49] away from the real treasure that god is
[1:53:52] calling you to
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:54:01] this this is where when it moves from a
[1:54:05] new heart
[1:54:06] and a new spirit where his spirit comes
[1:54:08] in and i'll leave you with this tonight
[1:54:13] this is where it no longer is you
[1:54:18] trying to live a christian life it's no
[1:54:21] longer you
[1:54:22] by intellect no i shouldn't do this or i
[1:54:24] should do that now listen
[1:54:25] there's parts of things as you come to
[1:54:27] it god makes you aware
[1:54:30] of certain things in his word but the
[1:54:32] intellect i'm talking about
[1:54:34] is where you're not looking around is so
[1:54:37] and so here
[1:54:38] oh paul's here oh i i gotta
[1:54:41] i gotta pause here so i i can't talk
[1:54:43] about the boss that way
[1:54:45] no no this is where it's not you
[1:54:49] having to be intellectually i gotta take
[1:54:51] a hold of this i can't do it no no
[1:54:53] it's where it becomes subconscious
[1:54:59] you don't have to think about it you
[1:55:02] know i think about it
[1:55:03] should i wear this should i wear it you
[1:55:04] don't think about it
[1:55:07] because it's his life and listen he is
[1:55:10] the word
[1:55:12] i i can't go into this tonight but you
[1:55:15] see
[1:55:16] he is the word it can't be a
[1:55:18] spirit-filled life
[1:55:20] and not walking in the word
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:25] god has given grace for those who lived
[1:55:27] in overlapping times
[1:55:29] you understand but god
[1:55:33] a life that'll walk into the word it
[1:55:35] doesn't mean that we understand
[1:55:37] everything

[1:55:40] life
[1:55:44] it's his life you love him tonight

[1:55:59] needful

[1:56:04] experience of the new birth

[1:56:10] and the love of the world has died
[1:56:13] within you lord willing we'll get into
