praise the Lord let's just give him the praise oh how we love you Lord and you know what the truth of the matter is is that he's never had a new thought concerning your eye he's never loved us anymore his love has always been the same you say well even when I was in the condition that I was in he still loved you but it's when in that time that finally through his drawing and our yielding that love takes control it's manifested in our lives and it overwhelms us no wonders Solomon could say in the book of Song of Solomon love is as strong as death many times you're her brother brems say try to do something to a dead person you won't get nothing out of that and he likens that to that of the love of God it's taken hold in our hearts the Holy Spirit we now are dead to the world to ourselves but we've been raised in the newness of life in Christ and aren't you glad that this same life the love of God in our hearts it's overcoming it's subduing day by day moment by moment just like when we look around here we can look at pictures of ourselves we see we've changed death itself just day by day moment by moment we see art we see a change but how much greater and how much more real and true is the love of God changing us transforming us pushing his way moving in our life as we're yielding he's grown greater and I'm so glad about that tonight aren't you aren't you glad to be here praise the name of the Lord let's just turn in the word if we could here to Exodus chapter 15 and read just a few verses of scripture tonight it's gonna read the first three verses here out of Exodus 15 then sing Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him in habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name amen let's just bow our heads in order prayer dear Lord Jesus father how we give you thanks Lord for your word tonight Lord and we just pray that Lord is our desires to Lord that it would be in your hands tonight and our lives likewise O God that you would take of your word and father you administer to the needs within our lives Lord for truly dear God you guide and direct us Lord as our hearts are looking to you father you see the needs Lord in our lives and though God just as you looked upon the multitude that day and saw that they were in need physically to be fed they were hungry and you would not send them away hungry Oh God how much more Lord when you can see Lord in our souls Lord our lives we are hungry all God for the bread of heaven Lord for the man or God that you would common and speak to us Lord this evening minister to each life Lord for you know our needs Lord and may you come Lord and just move sweetly Lord and richly and personally lord god father in our lives tonight Lord throughout this congregation or God that father that every single need or God might be met and every heart or god in condition to receive Lord from you tonight we pray Lord we give ourselves to you Lord to come away Lord in these few moments Lord into your presence or God now father we just ask that you'll just take control in the further part of the service in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then God blesses your being seated I want to I want to draw your attention back to that of verse two and just really speak from there tonight when we look at this in Exodus 15 here the first the first part of their journey and God bringing them to a place remember God's the goal that God has even in leading them this way is to bring them to a place that their faith would continue to increase until the time when they are there at kadish and and preparing to cross Jordan that was the point of all of these stopping places along the way and the Red Sea was was very much a part of God's desire that he would make known his power in Redemption that God himself coming on the scene to manifest that not only he's a healer he's a deliverer that he's more mighty than what the mightiest army is upon this earth he's more mighty he's more mighty when we look at this and see it applied that he's greater than than any any devil any demon spirit any anything at all God is greater and so when we look at in the midst of this here day of Moses is moved by the Spirit of God and it begins to utter forth as he entered into the spirit as he begin to look brother brems says he looked and seen what was on the banks of the Red Sea and Moses got in the spirit when he all those dead Egyptians on there and he said Moses begin to sing a song when we realized this that this was not a previous song there no doubt were songs that they had sung but this song was was that of an inspiration of the experience of how God had revealed himself to Israel in the midst of this time and when you look at this this here the Lord is my strength and song and I want to speak on that thought for a few moments the Lord is my song because when you look at this word song here in the Hebrew that's used specifically here it deals with that of a melody so when you look at it it's not just the Lord he's in my song no he is my song he is my song there's no guesswork this song the main theme it's him and he is my song so it's not he's not just interjected every once in a while to make it feel like but he is my song and so when we look at this in the scriptures we realize that songs itself is not just in that of songs where notes and pitch and tone and harmony and all those things brought together but it also deals with a melody that God would place within the heart of our lives to where things themselves that would be a disconnected like notes you could have somebody in common you know maybe me and maybe some of the rest of us in your week might be able to pick out mary had a little lamb on this piano here but you know and you know how it is you pick out little songs you can put pluck notes and things like that but really that in itself and I don't mean to throw off on anybody if you're in piano lessons and that's all you know right now but I want to just say it like this that's in a sense it just plucking out notes but you know when you when you're able to move that and bring notes together and you know when you look at notes on a sheet music where or you know has it used to be in hymns you don't always see notes that are up here at the top of the of of the actual measure you or you see notes that they're up here sometimes notes come down and notes sometimes are beneath the measure of the line the bar lines then they come in the middle then they rise up you know what because you and me in our lives sometimes the notes go down sometimes the notes go up it's all part of how that within our life there's tests there's trials there's high moments there's low moments and yet within at all it's all part of the melody that God has to play out because when everything out of our life has a believer the melody itself is the Lord when it all comes down to it everything that we're we can say praise God I've overcome right here it's the Lord when we can look at it and say my I'm grateful for His mercy that bringing me through this test and trial it's been the Lord so when we look at it then we and ourselves have that true reality that as Paul could say Christ who is our life he is the melody of our life he is our song it's him that brings everything together and it's him that's the one that's highlighted in our life so I look at this within a song as we were kind of you know looking at some of this last week and you know we recognize that how that inspiration just like it did for Moses here there will be that of older songs that God will make known and more personally have more understanding than what it was years before even to those who wrote it as authors but yet then you'll find that inspiration itself will drop in an hour when God Himself is doing something and declaring something and I know sometimes you can look and you can think about different ones believers who have wrote songs and different you know assemblies and different ones that have wrote absolutely beautiful songs of what God has done in this hour the reality is that with some of those you can never sing them in any denominational churches whatsoever they would simply look at you and say what in the world are you talking about what are these things that you're speaking about and yet there are some that have been wrote that you know you could sing across within any of the denominations you know I never forget some of you were there when we were over here on route Road at that Baptist Church there and and the brother that's that's been there I had lunch with him here about a year ago or so and and when we were over there and brother Paul and sister sharing different ones and Lafon things they were singing songs because they had invited him there and the man had known them you know from singing and so forth and many of you can remember there that day on that dinner when we were there and brother Paul and sister sherry brother Isaac and they begin to sing he's the same God that's living in me and you know in the middle of that church right there I tell you the presence of God came down and you know it might have been a Baptist Church but they had a Pentecostal bully in there so I just had to stand in worship when there when the power of God not Pentecost my organization you you understand it's a joy in my heart I just couldn't contain it I've done the same thing when I went to other concerts as well it's just something about it now you know don't get down on me because that's the way that I respond I'm not looking down on you but I remember when the presence of God just come right in there when that song was being sung it's almost like the people they didn't even know what to do they didn't even know what had struck there but the power of God the Spirit of the Lord had so moved within that place in that time so we can look at inspiration is given within a period of time and it's all it's all given to that of the Lord and when you look at it in terms of songs you know as we said last week we don't want to be dogmatic with anything because the Prophet himself when you watch how the prophets approach with things the Prophet himself he stood on the word but he was not dogmatic and so when we look at this if we many times we have to step back and may get the wide-angle lens and begin to look at things instead of sometimes honing in on such little things and then we we look at it but yet you have to get the big picture remember in this hour when we look at the message that God has given to us brother Branham himself was not the first one upon this earth that ever preached cerfancy it wasn't the first time that predestination was ever ministered did remember it was truths that were lost that the Apostles had a rigid the minister remember this city is founded upon that of the 12 apostles you have the 12 patriarchs so it's not a new doctrine the message itself is oh it's something new no it's not brother BAM tells us if it's something other than what is already wrote here then it can't be right because John was told to seal up those things which you hear do not write them so it's not that of something that's adding to but my point is coming to it is that the ministry the message in this hour remember when Elijah went to the mountain there Elisha never picked or packed with him rocks up to this mountain he never you know packed so many rocks and said well I'm packing my own rocks to build the altar but remember when he got there he actually under the word of the Lord that was given to him he assembled what was there laying in disarray and it was an assembly of truths that had been scattered and when that assembly of truth was now brought back in order we now remember here brother Bantam never looked at it even though Calvin went so far off he never looked and said I'm not taking nothing from that man I'm not taking nothing from Calvin he didn't look at it that way brother Bantam knew that you don't get your eyes on an artist I mean or you don't get your eyes upon just something like that you get your eyes upon truth and so he was able to identify there is truth within what Calvin said there's truth and what our mean Ian said there's truth within those things and so it was the Holy Spirit identifying what its truth I say all of that to say this it's the same Holy Spirit that is here that helps you and I identify truth that is around this truth that is within songs truth that comes our way it must be the Holy Spirit I'm just reading here earlier today brother Branham talking about radio broadcasts of where he himself listened and listening to other ministers and brother band said you know what he said I was just listening to a radio broadcast here he said the other day he said in this attorney said something so profound and he said what it is he wondered why that those of the minister and layman why are they sitting around when the coming of the Lord is upon us you see what I mentioned within that the Prophet himself never purported himself as the only source of truth but he linked us identified us with the very person of truth and that is the Lord Jesus Christ we are people of truth we're not afraid we're not intimidated we're not fearful oh my goodness I I'm afraid I'll be deceit no sir the Holy Spirit operating in our life and we have been brought into a thinking man's filter so that we can pass the things through the word if it doesn't pass through the word song saying whatever if it doesn't make you through the word we don't want it it's enough for us because if it's not going to be edifying then we don't want that are you with me so when we look at this brother branham himself now here is a man that you each said that last week brother Branham he would tell brother Branham the phrase that you know about very well brother Branham you don't know your Bible real well blue gram said we'd if we differ in doctrine quite a bit and this man who brother Branham refers to in this that constantly tells him you don't got good grammar if you only knew the Greek that's brother booth-clibborn who brother Branham called his friend brother Graham called a dear friend and I make the point within it because booth-clibborn himself never from what I understand and read never came to the light of the messenger of the truth he passed away in 1969 in Oregon but yet booth-clibborn here he was able to come under the inspiration of Almighty God and write a song that brother Branham says is my favorite song probably most of you know what it is down from his glory and brother Branham many times different ones would sing it before he would come out to minister and this is just one of the times brother REM says my heart is thrilled that's my favorite song if you only knew the background for that song my friend composed that song booth-clibborn in a cornfield one night with his elbows out and on his knees out there in prayer God give him this song look what he says and I think it's a one of the matchless for this day notice its jailers it wasn't something that was just well it's gonna be all know it brings it up it's matchless for this day and brother brand goes on to say why when the deity of Jesus Christ is denied by so many formal believers that he was no more than just a man just a prophet he was Emmanuel so brother Branham we'll look at this song and say this song has such significance to me because it is a matchless one for this thing why because when Satan was working to challenge the very beauty of the Lord Jesus Christ and make him no more than all he was no more than just a prophet he was no more than just a man he was no more than just the second person in the Godhead but here the inspiration of the Holy Spirit would strike a man and brother Branham would speak of this over and over countlessly of how this song would meet and match the challenge of the age or day when it was coming against the very deity of the Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad that the Holy Spirit still inspires songs aren't you glad and the reality of it is that even though you may not be a singer but you still got us all and even though you might not be a songwriter there is still a song that has been wrote in your life and nobody can sing this song like you can somebody could try to sing it but they can't hit the notes like you can so when we look at this here notice how that David would would speak of this because we know that songs themselves they come from experience as songs are not just people sitting around and trying to come up with rhymes and or what word would go with this that you know there might be people that do that but songs that have a meaning for us that the Holy Spirit would press down upon they are from an experience that a person has been through in Psalms 28 verse 6 David said blessed be the Lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and with my song will I praise him now whether or not David has received at this point on song or not whatever song it was if it was a song that was already previous or it was new inspiration that was striking right then regardless it was his song I mean you know how it is you anybody else could come up here and the sole leader could sing on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross but in that service is just something about it that strikes your heart you said that's my song then they might be singing a special he thought I was worth saving and here they come to sing this song and you in the midst of that service it's something that it's just like this song it puts the very strings of my heart and you say that's my song I will greatly rejoice you see you are identifying with the words of a song it's just like how we identify with the word as it's coming forth in this hour we do not count it robbery to be greeted to be counted equal with God is that right we do not look and say why I shouldn't be the word no we say what he has said and once he's given us the word it's our word second samuel 22 verse 1 David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield the Horn of my salvation my Hightower my refuge my Savior thou save us me from violence and I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised and so shall I be safe from mine enemies and David goes on boy what a long song but it is a song that's out of experience where David is singing the song now if you notice here in the book of Isaiah chapter 38 here is Hezekiah now remember Hezekiah God you know was was a pronouncing and had pronounced through the prophet Isaiah of where to set your house in order and prepare to die but how that the Hezekiah had turned his face remember to the Lord and he began to pour his heart out and before God Lord don't remove me until I've set my house in order lord give me an opportunity and so then we find that how that God sent the Prophet back with the word unto Him to let him know that God has indeed he's going to spare your life verse 17 look how Hezekiah speaks concerning this behold for peace I had great bitterness probably some maybe some of you were there tonight some of us have been there for peace I've had great bitterness but thou has in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou has cast all my sins behind my back [Applause] there's a song brewing here you're mine for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for that truth the living the living he shall praise thee as I do this day the father to the children shall make known that truth the Lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord now think of how Dave look how Hezekiah right sir we will sing my songs and remember Hezekiah worship had went to a mom in the tabernacle matter of fact the doors of the house of God had been closed but when Hezekiah came upon the throne then the doors of the tabernacle were opened they begin to move through the tabernacle and then worship itself was restored because Hezekiah realized it's not just enough to have the tabernacle open but David himself pointed singers with instruments and music that this itself would actually create that atmosphere he knew what warship was all about and sometimes you know how it is worship itself is not something that you just flip on like a switch worship itself is you must enter into it as a matter of fact brother Branham would put it like this he says you first have to get in the spirit and you get in the spirit then he says the Holy Ghost can heal you then the Holy Ghost can deliver you he said when you get in the spirit then he can fill you with the Holy Ghost but you see getting in the spirit is getting in the unction and the melody and harmony of the word to where that your soul is lining up with that word and then God is able to move and Hezekiah is identifying here that in his life at one time how his life was being lived to where that God who had become a secondary part of his life but in the midst of his life being taken away Hezekiah realizes that all these other things that I've allowed to put before him they're nothing for the rest of the days of my life Lord and because if I go to the grave I can't praise you in the grave but for the rest of my life Lord we're going to sing my songs with the instruments in the house of the Lord all the days of our life in other words Hezekiah said this song is on a continuous play there is not going to be a stopping of this song it's going to keep on moving because I cannot forget what mercy you have shown to me that you have raised me up and given me another opportunity I'm telling you here tonight you might hear you might not be really serving the Lord or even listening in but God gives you another opportunity and you and I could be sitting here tonight that how many times have we come up short but in His grace he gives us an opportunity he allows you an authorizer brother you talking about a song I'm telling you there's nobody that can give you a song like that except for the Lord Himself and it's not a little sad song but it comes out the Lord is my song because we know he's my Savior he's my deliverer he's my Redeemer David it goes on and says in Psalms 30 how will extol thee O Lord that word extol means to rise to put you high for thou has lifted me up and has not made my foes to rejoice over me o Lord my God I cried unto thee and thou has healed me O Lord thou has brought up my soul from the grave thou hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit sing unto the Lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness of what he alone can do right Billy Bama tell us like this in Mary's belief he says if we didn't have so many other things on our mind you know sometimes we'll come to church thinking about tomorrow I got to do this the next day I got to do this when we come to church we ought to lay aside every thought and everything of the world and enter into fellowship with Christ and worship meditating worshipping in our hearts and giving Psalms and praises to him let me just stop here I just feel just to stop you understand we are not ignorant of Satan's devices I know sometimes you might be Sunday morning paper readers but let me just say it to you like this when if you're having a little bit of a hard time it might be good for you to take a fast from the news and say I'm not even gonna let my mind be upon current events this is the Lord's Day I'm gonna give myself completely to God when I get home from church the newspaper will be there if it's not there there'll be the same news different people tomorrow you see sometimes we allow the enemy to rob us of our meditation looking at this checking that looking at this but you see have a fast come on somebody have a fast why because we're coming to the house of God this is not a tradition this is not just coming here when you get you are coming to battle and Satan is always trying to put things up you've got this notification in that notification and this and that in the other but you know what sanctify yourself and make ready for drug to move that's what God told him there at the base of the mountain there in mount Sanya sanctify yourself just you were told them sanctify yourself on the morrow will crossing over Jordan you know God it's something that God ought to sanctification God will alter alive but says Lord I'm setting myself aside I'm setting aside time Lord for you to enter into prayer your a does it opens you up in a channel for meditation and it takes a wave the meditation of a wonder who's liked it like like like like like you've already been like from the foundation of the world you've been laughs from the foundation of the world come on somebody we're not ignorant of Satan's devices well huh I just got to look over this project and I just got to have it in my mind why so you can think about it all service why don't you just say Lord you are God and I this will be here when I get home but I need help anyhow because I can't make it come together and even if I did I don't want it to be my name on it I want your name to be the one on it Lord [Applause] meditating this is our to enter in meditating and worshipping in our hearts this is before the music ever starts this is before the music ever starts how can that be if the Lord is your song he is the melody of your life you're coming out of your life already sets then atmosphere coming in here meditating worshipping in our hearts and giving songs and praises to him thinking of his goodness and what he means to us worshiping in the spirit singing spiritual songs making melodies in our heart even the said if there's any afflicted let them sing songs be happy be in meditation always expecting God at any moment to appear to you David goes on in that same song Psalm 30 and I'm not going to read all of it for sake of time but David begins to speak of things that if I read it you would recognize what I just read out of Isaiah where Hezekiah himself know what you think of this here has the class not plagiarizing Peter and Paul naresse I'm never plagiarized you see they were in tune with the same Holy Spirit and Hezekiah was not a man ignorant of god's manifestation through David's life how many times out of our life where we're praying friends let me tell you something many of the words I'll just say it that come out of my mouth and prayer are not new words they are words of things that God I've been reading or what I've been hearing and you find when you go along and that strength you wants the presence of God come down and he'll begin to guide you upon other needs and other things to pray for why because you are praying over that word and that word coming forward it's bringing you into an atmosphere because in his word is life his word is not apart from him his word is him maybe something you heard the Prophet say and you start in your in prayer you worship and you begin to go through and the Lord this just struck my heart Lord maybe I don't understand it all the way the Lord it sure struck me real good Lord how this was said right here Lord it blessed me how was reading this today Lord in the Psalms it blessed me I was reading this here you enter in with that right there because let me tell you something communion when you're entering in your community miss word and you watch how the presence of God will move right in behind that and you find David here these things many of them that we already read in Hezekiah in his prayer to the Lord you find him here in David's time but what's how what David says here as for his testimony of that you know from the Lord this experience verse 10 here O Lord and have mercy upon me Lord be thou my helper thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing you can't and I can't turn our mourning into dancing well come on brother Samuel just dance I need him come on somebody Val has turned for me my mourning into dancing Val has put off my sack loaf and girded me with gladness you know David he's been dressed for worship God has brought him through and to the end that my glory makes sing praise to thee and not be silent o Lord my god I will give thanks unto thee forever now over and over we hear the phrase a new song and we hear that by the phrase it's maybe many of your minds that go right to revelations 5 but I'm not going there tonight but you hear a new song and David will express this throughout the writings of the Psalms David will and also the other prophets were all so expressive in those times but we want to look at this tonight because as it goes on to say in Psalms 33 verse 1 rejoice in the Lord O you righteous for praise is comely for the upright I want you to think of it what if the whole constitution of our life is sadness and sorrow and down what joy is there well both Samuel nobody's had it as hard as me these brothers and sisters they have had it harder and whatever they've had listen remember whatever has come our way it is common to man but God is faithful to make a way through it you know we don't want to extol our trial I lift up my trial in the highest praise Mel chair I want to lift up God in the highest priests this is where David said rejoice in the Lord o you righteous for praise is comely for the other now you know what David might get accused here he's just trying to work for people up David when trying to work nobody up David recognize there's victory in your circumstance it just depends on what you're looking at you can read the whole account of the exodus 15 where David himself takes that in Psalm 77 and he applies it to what he himself has just gone through in his infirmity he reaches back in the back testimony and said that is mine also it's what we're looking at rejoice in the Lord O you righteous for praise is comely for the upright praise the Lord with heart sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of Tim strings sing unto him a new song play skillfully with a loud noise for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord think of that sing unto him a new song I think as one writer says like this fresh mercies demand a fresh expression of gratitude another writer would say it not necessarily a song unheard before but one fresh from the singers heart you see there's times a new song is just where indeed it is a new song it's a new experience there's a new thankfulness of gratitude you see more understanding has further opened but then there's also times of a new song where what has been wrote has now when the writers wrote because you realize songs themselves also contain prophecy within and we'll read some here tonight some that contain prophecy within them while we are waiting on that prophecy to come to pass we sing about it we rejoice in it it is the delight of our life in matter of fact it is the song of our life so sometimes their songs that's already been but it's my fresh experience in our hearts how many times their songs that has come back up to you because of something you've went through and many just has a meaning to you it's at the top of your playlist it's number one on your playlist number two and your play this number three on your playlist number four your whole playlist is that song why it's fresh in your heart now notice here notice david picking this up david here under the spirit of god here here he is this of a masonic promise of that would come through the very resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ here he is in Psalms 40 verse 1 I waited patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry now David is not just this this the Spirit of God is not just upon David just speaking of things in the future this is an experience for David as well you as me the Lord has heard me he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God and many shall see it and fear and trust in the Lord this is exactly what took place at the very resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ where he said I will declare thy name in the midst of my brethren I will sing praises unto thee you see in is now not loose prophecies but now the melody of the one who inspired Isaiah who inspired your mind who inspired all of down through time it has now come together in the Messianic promise here of Jesus Christ the true Messiah the true atonement what is it it is the song that is contained and has been wrote all the way down through now the notes have been put together you with me so now within that there's a song that's released because when prophecy hope Lori when prophecy comes together and loose ends are brought together it now brings forth not just a plunking of notes but it releases a song and when that song is released there's got to be somebody here to sing that song so when you look the Lord Jesus here he is the Holy Spirit now here he is in the midst of the church declaring this how is he declaring it he's declaring it by the manifestation of his life he has an aunt 'add men of God that Peter speaks of that BAE's men are declaring the truth of God by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven you know what it is it's a lineup with a very composer of the sheet music the director and those are up on the earth it's now bringing together one great symphony that has a distinct sound that indeed Jesus Christ is the Messiah and the Holy Ghost has come there singing a song Oh does it have ups and downs sure it had ups and downs sometimes they were thrown in prison trial trials that went on then the Bible would say now had all the churches rest and throughout the region and then after rest rest recuperate get your breath trials are coming back again it was up and down with the notes but you know it wasn't like one uncertain sounds brother this is all part of the sounding out so prophesy even when you look and consider when it would speak here of even the Lord Jesus Christ and Isaiah would write of this and Isaiah 42 9 and it would even speak calling our israel's attention to what has taken place here with the invasion and how God brought the word to pass there and notice in verse nine behold the former things are come to pass and new things do I declare before they spring forth I tell you of them sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the Owls and the inhabitants thereof now to think of this here think of Israel Israel singing prophecy prophecy every time when it comes time for the Paschal Lamb there's Pascal songs that they sing there's certain songs they sing at the Feast of Tabernacles certain songs they sing at this feast is it's certain songs that have been designated and wrote for certain seasons of time and you with me but nonetheless even though that Israel they do not see and did not recognize the fulfillment of it and even here when they were waiting on the Messiah before the Lord Jesus ever come they sung these songs it was identified this is with the promise here and how that song would have a meaning and an impact on their life think about it they just like you and I no doubt there were times they got down there were times they got gloomy and when they got down or they got gloomy God had provided song that would be able to minister to their spirit and be able to lift them up glory be to God you see this is where but the man talks about he said an old colored man he said that he knew that would set out beside their old he said up there where we lived in Kentucky he said up there you know it behind his house and he said he would sing you know certain songs at that time and he said it was a certain melody that that man would actually sing and he said he'd sometimes no doubt he said it's why I believe it's when he gotten weary he said that he would sing this song I will rise and go to Jesus he will embrace me in his arms in the arms of my dear Savior oh there are ten thousand charms but man so when he got weary he would sing that I would say no doubt that when he got into the first line he probably did feel like singing that song but there was something about it there that a song there's inspiration that's packed in if there of how that God Himself has so set it forth that it would move right around and you know he may not come out of there skip in and everything else but it had a meaning to him because this was a song that was a part of his life no differ from us their songs they have such meaning to us and to think of it for you and I look we're singing hymns we're singing songs we're even singing songs our inspiration has been given in this hour and because of God's grace and understanding you and I sing of it Redemption we're not just singing a redemption of God heaven Savin a pity party on somebody I'm coming down and hoping somebody will love him no sir we understand that the meaning of redemption it's God coming down to bring back to him what always belong to him what is that that's God's grace that whereby we sing it we sing it with understanding aren't you thankful to the Lord for that now no wonder hear that Paul you know would write as we refer to it last week Paul would write of how to let the Word of God look at this in Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another let it dwell in you richly let it be something that is nourishing it's releasing to you if it's something that you're taking and you're picking people apart it's not dwelling in you richly it is lifting you up and others down it's not dwelling in you richly but when it's dwelling in you richly it's a song that's coming out of your life where notes are coming together and uniting with that word and brother the life itself will speak of a life teaching and admonishing encouraging one another in souls hymns and spiritual songs lord have mercy so it means they had a hymn no only believed songbook any hymns Psalms and spiritual songs come on somebody singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord to the Lord Paul picks this up again now Paul hey this is the first church age messenger right he knows something about worship this is talking about everyday living come on somebody up here you know and the heavenlies are what remember this is everyday living this is warfare speaking Ephesians 5:19 speaking to yourselves in Psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord I tell you when you read some of the statements you know that Luther made Luther himself is known for three things Martin Luther Luther is known for the doctrine of salvation by faith alone he's known that belief that the scripture should be translated into the people's language thank God for that huh and he's known for the birth of congregational singing he felt that music was of God and not of man and he was determined to restore congregational singing in the German language to the church y'all ready for this next part so strong were his beliefs about music and worship that he wrote these fiery words next to the Word of God the noble art of music is the greatest treasure in the world it controls our hearts minds and spirits a person buckle-up who does not regard music as a marvelous creation of God does not deserve to be called a human being he should be permitted to hear nothing but the braying of asses and the grunting of hogs church age messenger are you with me he recognized the our music and the very important statement here music is not of the devil he is not the Creator he is a pervert come on somebody look what he does with his music it arouses all sorts of things sensuality and everything else all sorts of lust and sin and perversion but notice what God's music will do when God's music by the Spirit of God it gets you and I in condition for the word to come on the scene there's some times you and I are like it was when Elijah stood before Jehoshaphat we are in no count or humor for God to move in our lives but we need some good spiritual songs now brother Adam talked to us he said I really like those mellow songs but then there's also you got to read more than the message brother madam also identified there were times where he likes him snappy songs and this was a place for it well you say that's before service no if there's too many other quotes where brother branham is putting the balance well what does it come to brother send yo I don't understand the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's what it comes down to it comes down not to a dogmatic order it comes down to being may being on tune with the Holy Ghost if it's time in this service and the song service is nearer my God to thee and that's what the Holy Ghost is leading let's sing it come on now if the after service is every praise to our God let's sing it but maybe it might be that were this service it might be it as well in my soul in the in the prior service and then the after service it might be pass me an auto gentle Savior but it's same to what determines that he does he does not people's favorite songs he does this is his service it's not us ordering him what songs we want to sing see friends this is why the quotes themselves cannot be isolated you've got to take a wide-angle spectrum and how brother Adam himself would rejoice he said all he said those blacks he said I would go down there he said among brother Smith and the rest of them they would sing it's a highway to heaven he said they would get in there and start he said the chanting back and forth lift him up lift him up he said you know they have their own melody to it he said a wonderful thing I used to love to go down there oh my goodness I'm not alone [Laughter] you with me this is why it takes the discernment of the Holy Ghost so within this when we look at it here then under God's leadership and his direction of how that Luther himself would so set everything to where Luther actually wanted these songs to be printed now listen to me now Luther songs that were wrote these weren't just rambling words this was truth I hope you understanding me this was truth it was truth that had come in that hour and was made known and manifest in that time I tell you what right now if Luther was setting and hearing what you and I are hearing you talking about singing a mighty fortress is our God oh lord have mercy the Deacons would have to just Parral him and set him down Martin Luther man he would be I'll tell you what he'd be shot what a mighty fortress is our God they couldn't stop her out they couldn't destroy her they tried to kill this word they tried to take her down eat her to the roots but praise God she is restored she's standing on her feet brother he know that would break him in the midst of a course who knows he might write a new verse you say would that be a new song yes and no it is a song that was new then but now as the Spirit of God inspires it it was already declaring who God was then and Martin Luther here with him listened with hymns he wanted these to be at home hello somebody this is what I mean he wanted them to be used at homes and he encouraged schools to teach them to the children I don't mind saying this you know what I enjoy a lot of the phrasing worship I enjoy a lot and a lot of the spectrum of things as long as it's truth and not a bunch of mumbo-jumbo you're under with you with me I enjoy things that are truth that passes through the filter but I'll say it like this right here there are truths there I'm telling you there are sermons in those hymns let me tell you something one time my wife about three three or four years ago she was having a kidney stone attack you know a lot of times that's not the convenient time 2:30 3 o'clock in the morning and we were praying there in the bathroom didn't know you know if I was gonna have to take her to the emergency room or what and at that time as we were praying you know we would pray we'd sing a little bit she got a hold of a songbook and she just started reading songs out loud and when she began to read those songs out loud I tell you the presence of God moving in there and then one note I'm that pain was gone you know why because there's a Holy Ghost that inspired them to write those words and that is truth that's why it's powerful you think about it some service is not just singing songs it's entering in and you can enter in you can get your healing come on somebody you see here it talks about about him them right here in Revelations 14 my my my let me try to bring this down here revelations 14 verse 1 here speaking about 144,000 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads and I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their hearts and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts the elders notice they sung as it were a new song was it really a new song yes and no it was a new song to them because it had never become a melody before they had never recognized Jesus Christ as the Messiah so it is a song of notes that have been wrote down through the scriptures but now in this time here when he comes to them notice here they are brought in tune and in harmony now with the music sheet remember the two witnesses of revelations 11 and here when Israel they've already entered back into temple worship and here they are offering up all these sacrifices but then at that time Moses and Elijah appeared to them and what do they do they call them under the seventh trumpet they call them back to that true atonement and they point out this is him who the law and the prophets spoke of and there is a hundred and forty-four thousand of whom the song that was already laid out it that is to be inspired to them and it is a song that only they can learn nobody else can learn it because it's just their part and their eyes see it their eyes come open their eyes they recognize it and they themselves listen now what the Seventh Seal has been to us the unfolding and the making known of the true atonement is the Lord Jesus Christ the true mercy see that same revelation strikes their heart and they are born of the same Holy Ghost that you and I have been born of in that our brother they learned a new soul Oh glory and no man no man can learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand which were redeemed from the earth nobody can learn the song but them you see their names Oh glory to God their names are wrote in the promises of the promised visitation to Israel their names are out there in that word Oh to see Israel gathering here coming back into the homeland but to think about it they're desiring to line up with the word there is a there is an intellect 144,000 that God is sending the message to when the Gentile church is taken in rapture and that message will be brought to them to bring them to the true atonement you're talking about a song a new song well it's like our new song to worthy is the lamb now you've gotta admit there's some songs that we used to know that's an lyrics you used to sing lives we used to live unbelief that used to be present but you see we've learned a new song it's not been taught to us by man but it's been taught to us by the mighty angel the Lord of glory the Holy Ghost the angel the Lord has come and saw the south and say hey you're part of my symphony you didn't know it but you're part of my symphony you're a note you're a life that's identified in descending what's he doing he's drawing that together that was already wrote in the music see what does it do it brings forth a new song for my life there used to be all sorts of things come out of our life unbelief in whatever more but there's a new song a new song that we have learned it's a song of overcoming grace overcoming power of supreme deliverance it's a song that I always was a child of God I am the son of God how eyes was a daughter of God we've learned a new song it wasn't good enough to change a few things we had to learn that song that we were a part of no wonder the Scriptures would speak of Israel here in Isaiah 12 in that day they shall say oh Lord I will praise thee this is Israel this is here after the gathering hear them sealing away thou was angry with me thine anger has turned away thou comfort us me behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my song my strength and my song he also has become my salvation they will sing that same anthem now that was even sung back there in Exodus 15 oh my let me go on here let me just move on down here you know brother branham he makes it known very clear there's so many other things that would you look at Psalms there in the Psalms Psalms 96 Psalms 98 so many that that declare of the Millennium that coming time and the singing that is to take place but you know what we are not waiting to start rejoicing our singing and rejoicing are declaring has already begun worthy is the lamb to receive glory riches power honor and blessings but I'm talking about music he said you know there's something that's got power in it he said you know he's talking about wanting him to get music for him to play to take home with him he says because when I get down I get down a little low and I hear that it makes me feel good to hear good singing I'll tell you I know this is simple but it helps you it helps you here at James 5:13 is there is any among you afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing songs you know sometimes when we come in the house of God you don't feel merry and it is it's a sacrifice but let me just bring this down here if you are feeling merry then you just let the Lord flow through your life as you're singing songs and the Holy Ghost you can let your life be an insulator or a conductor you can either be a styler or you can be a conductor come on somebody this ain't no work up it's a reality what do you want to come here what doing what is your desire when we're coming here I'm not coming here and saying I wonder what God's gonna do I wonder what's gonna be spoke tonight I wonder what no sir I know God has something for me I'm expecting him to move this is not a spectator sport I am tired of this I am a worshiper I'm a believer priest I may not be able to play an instrument but I've got hands that I can clap hey man I've got a voice that I can shout to the Lord that I can praise him I know some hopeful you know some folks want to make out like they don't get excited and that's a lie if you can get excited out there about a ball game and everything else and shame on you for coming in the house of God and said here like start bumps on a loan if you get excited out there about the things of God brother you ought to get excited about the Lord inside of here ain't condemning you I'm just telling you right now there ought to be sending you check up on because sometimes people lie and they say they don't get excited that's a lie they do get excited well I don't get emotional let me get a sledgehammer on your toe and hit at one time well there you go you're trying I ain't trying to work nobody up you got to get in the spirit before anything happens and if there's any merry sing-songs so if you're not married don't get up and sing a song come on somebody we don't want that old loon through here preach brother Samuel I will we need somebody that's able to stand up and you know that is that Mary is when something has struck your heart God has done something for you and it might be a song that's familiar to us that everybody in the congregation can sing it without the words being up here but brother when it is an experience to you and you say this is my song tonight and you sing that song and the Holy Spirit comes right behind that I'll tell you it starts a channel and a flow of the Holy Spirit in the meeting just like it did there on the banks of the Red Sea here comes brother Branham out to the platform the opening of the message the darkest hour then Jesus come along just been a wonderful song that's been sung I mean that's got the people stirred up this is his first words my I know how you feel just like I do let's just say praise the Lord everybody praise the Lord that makes you feel like if you were dying you could go right on through all right wouldn't it that would make you feel like if you were dying you could go right on through all right wouldn't it seem like you'd just be fine oh brother BAM says I can just sit and drink a lot of that in and sit and still not be full he said that's really really wonderful old-fashioned gospel singing when I hear any names off the brothers and all those singing over there I'm telling you it's gonna be wonderful yes sir it sure will be just think what's this we have an opportunity to hear them forever when we get there won't that be wonderful I just love singing I think good old-fashioned singing like that is the backbone of a meeting whoa the backbone of a meeting is good old-fashioned singing because before the word can go forth the trumpeters the singers go forth first god don't want no dry warship he wants our heart in tune ready to receive from him you know what happens well here's what happens Exodus 15 verse 20 and Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron she took a timbrel in her hand lord have mercy where'd she find that tempering I don't know but she found it you see Moses had been singing it just stirred her up she grabbed a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances imitators come on somebody they were not imitating you know what it was they were conductors they were yielded and the Holy Spirit got ahold of them - Miriam just happened to be a little bit more liberated brother them said she got a hot spell when she sold those Egyptians there on the seashore and she took out the notice she's not singing a different song she's echoing the song that the messenger has already declared in that time she's echoing that song it is a calling from her life and there are others who take up and they themselves are charts and they go right down the bank dear lord have mercy they must not been to church of christ Baptist this must have been real message believers oh brother Sammy no no no no no they must have been real believers you see Miriam answer them you see I know they're you know as a person now you may not even get out of your pew but you see you can tell friends even through the Ministry of the word you can catch when spirits are resisting and once and when there is a pooling going on you can catch even in the midst of a song service you may not have a voice any longer that could carry out maybe you know it again as you get older sometimes we got a call for you got a weakness you may not even be able to sing the full lyrics to the but your heart is in it and when your heart is in it God's moving right through that conductor and you know you may not seemingly be able to get out like boy you want to but you might say man in my heart I'm dancing right now my goodness right now I'm having myself a time right now brother BAM you know what he called it he said it was the Holy Spirit he said looked like it was catching from one to another on Miriam it was like Adams in a relay it was being passed from one to another to another what a difference it is when the Lord is my son the Lord is my son we come in here we may not know what songs that God's put upon the song leaders hard tell you the truth the song leader might think that he's got songs that God's put on his heart and maybe a song leader you know just like a minister lord have mercy if I preached everything I had up here I'd have you all here for a week the first time you got dinged Oh God gave all those song over all this to me but I don't have to preach it all tonight but if I can get in tune with the Holy Ghost he might have me sing one or two maybe three songs and say hey it's time get the man of God out here it's time for the word to come forth you see we're not interested in our program were interested in this and when you get to look again you might take one song to song whatever he wants to do whatever he wants to do because after all the Lord is my son he is my song you see you've got a song nobody can sing you now you don't know it we get to the other side you're gonna be singing a special to me right now get nervous don't worry you'll be changed you were changed but the song special is your life the testimony of Jesus Christ that's come through your life don't you love him he is my soul he is my son Oh bless the Lord let's just bow our heads in prayer Lord Jesus you are song Lord father we love you we appreciate you Lord how we thank you Lord God for liberty Lord where you have set us free Lord for Lord where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Liberty Lord you have set us free as sons and daughters of God that that Liberty that we might live as we ought to live Lord it's a melody in our hearts you're that melody you are song you're the delight of our life and Lord we every one of us we just want to be free want to be free in you we want to be sensitive to your presence we just want to worship your Lord or God and just giving of our lives Lord some might have a louder voice some might have a softer voice but father we want to be conductors we don't want to be insulators Lord we want the Holy Spirit to have the right away because we know that the Holy Ghost will never get out of order he's a gentleman he'll always be in order and Lord as long as we're looking to you and we're trusting you we don't have to fear Lord and father if anything would get out of order you're so faithful Lord to bring us back Lord so Lord you have desired rejoice in the Lord as David said for praise is comely upon his saints Lord Jesus we love you tonight may you just continue through the songs Lord that we would sing Lord and worship just continue to minister to the hearts and to every need right now Lord that's upon the hearts of your people if there's one Lord that maybe they're in a time of their life Lord every one of us would like to live in a time where all the notes are on the top bar of the measure but in order to be a song there's got to be low notes and high notes there's got to be the bass the treble in the mid it comes together even the pitch the tone the tempo and then as that begins to be set then there is harmony that comes in to add to that melody and bring it together or maybe one here tonight [Music] say Lord Locke David there may be Lord going through something if it's a sickness and it's a different type of a test or trial maybe it's a need Lord in their life but Lord God they believe at the notes the notes where they're at right now that it's all part of the song Lord God grant own strength father god help us maybe some of us Lord than notes right now in our life maybe they're up there right now but maybe we have such compassion Lord because to know that the notes you brought us F Lord out of the
