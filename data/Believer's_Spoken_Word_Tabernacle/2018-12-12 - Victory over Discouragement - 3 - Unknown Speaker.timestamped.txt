[34:46] probably didn't get I didn't get a
[34:48] chance I keep reminding myself to tell
[34:50] the song leaders no handshaking so I
[34:54] don't know if you got your cancer today
[34:55] or not
[34:56] don't anybody say anything but if greet
[35:04] them from afar but we just thank God for
[35:13] these precious times that we have
[35:15] together and we want to lift a mission
[35:19] offering today and Lord willing here
[35:23] after the first part of the year brother
[35:27] Stephen in Bali was here from Uganda and
[35:30] brother Stephen we've stayed in contact
[35:34] and then I've had the reaching out based
[35:39] on the needs that has been presented
[35:42] there in the in the country of Uganda
[35:45] and I just let you know about that to
[35:49] pray about that Lord willing we'll we'll
[35:51] look into doing and channeling their
[35:54] offering into that with a mission
[35:56] offering after the first of the year
[35:58] maybe take a couple months on that to do
[36:01] what little part we can do because
[36:04] what's happening there is when the
[36:08] testimony brother Stephen had given you
[36:11] have those who are moving out of God is
[36:16] opening their eyes and when they are
[36:19] leaving that in the denomination then
[36:24] everything where the system wants to
[36:26] take everything and the people already
[36:29] Uganda's are very very
[36:31] hard hard place and you know that
[36:34] there's even been believers that's been
[36:36] there that even here over the past few
[36:39] years worth just eight has went to just
[36:41] help them to have at least a little bit
[36:43] of rice and so we want to just if you
[36:47] could there's many needs there's needs
[36:48] for message books and and everything
[36:51] I've been in contact with other Tim Dodd
[36:53] they had contacted me and looking at
[36:55] that and I just got text this morning I
[36:57] had me and that chance to even open I'm
[36:59] and fully look at him it's videos that
[37:00] brother Steven sent me he said brother
[37:03] he said I just got news just today they
[37:06] baptized hundreds within this meeting
[37:08] here and so I haven't even had a chance
[37:11] that to even look at the video here this
[37:14] morning and these things and you see it
[37:16] really surging there in in uganda and in
[37:19] those places so we just want to keep
[37:22] that in prayer if you would and I just
[37:25] want to say God bless you because with
[37:28] what we've been able to do with the
[37:30] mission offering we've not only been
[37:32] able by God's grace to support the work
[37:37] what's going on in in the printing of
[37:40] the message there and getting that out
[37:42] in Honduras but we're also able by God's
[37:48] grace there's been things we've been
[37:49] able to do with other things as well
[37:51] throughout the Philippines which I've
[37:53] told you of so god bless you for your
[37:55] new heart with in it too with because we
[37:59] have one purpose and that's to see that
[38:01] last one come in amen I believe we're
[38:05] real close

[38:32] move upon our hearts in a very special
[38:35] way father you you're the one Lord who

[39:14] direction or God of all of these things
[39:17] Lord into the hands Lord in which they
[39:20] come father we believe that you're a
[39:22] multiplier or God that father when we
[39:25] think in the scriptures that you just
[39:29] did not multiply just enough but the
[39:33] Bible says after that lord of the fishes
[39:36] and loaves that they took up baskets
[39:38] afterwards
[39:40] Oh God you displayed to us that you're
[39:43] not just enough you're more than enough
[39:46] Lord and father we pray this morning
[39:49] that you will just bless Lord God the
[39:52] worshiper Lord as they would give from
[39:54] the abundance of their heart Lord may
[39:56] you multiply to them Oh God
[39:59] father according to their needs we pray
[40:01] Lord guide us now we pray through a
[40:03] remaining part of the service for your
[40:05] glory in Jesus name Amen amen amen god
[40:12] bless you musicians thank you
[40:21] let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew 11
[40:35] and we just want to begin reading in
[40:37] verse one and go down there a little bit
[40:41] let you have your seats in verse 1 and
[40:48] it came to pass when Jesus had made an
[40:54] end of commanding his twelve disciples
[40:57] he departed thence to teach and to
[40:59] preach in their cities and when John had
[41:02] heard in the prison the works of Christ
[41:06] he sent two of his disciples and said
[41:10] unto Him art thou he that should come or
[41:14] do we look for another jesus answered
[41:17] and said unto them go and show John
[41:20] again those things which you do hear and
[41:23] see the blind receive their sight and
[41:27] the lame walk and the lepers are
[41:29] cleansed and the Deaf hear the dead are
[41:32] raised up and the poor have the gospel
[41:34] preached to them and blessed is he
[41:37] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[41:41] was last year just the Lord the Blessed
[41:43] his word as you're being seated and just
[41:46] continue to read there and as they
[41:51] departed the Bible says in verse 7 Jesus
[41:55] began to say unto the multitudes
[41:58] concerning John what went ye out into
[42:03] the wilderness to see a reed shaken with
[42:07] the wind but what went ye out for to see
[42:10] a man clothed in soft raiment behold
[42:14] they that wear soft clothing are in
[42:16] gangs houses but what went ye out for to
[42:19] see a prophet yea I say unto you and
[42:24] more than a prophet for this is he of
[42:27] whom it is written behold I send my
[42:30] messenger before thy face which shall
[42:32] prepare thy way before thee
[42:35] verily I say unto you among them that
[42:37] are born of women there has not risen a
[42:40] greater than John the Baptist
[42:41] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[42:44] kingdom of heaven is greater than he and
[42:47] from the days of John the Baptist until
[42:50] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[42:52] violence and the violent take it by
[42:54] force for all the prophets and the law
[42:57] prophesied until John and if you will
[43:00] receive it this is Elias Elijah which
[43:03] was for to come and he that hath ears to
[43:06] hear let him hear
[43:09] I want to draw your attention back to
[43:14] that scripture that verse and verse 6
[43:17] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[43:22] offended in me brother Branham places it
[43:27] like this he says I believe there's more
[43:30] people offended in Jesus than any other
[43:32] person that ever lived on earth they get
[43:35] offended too quick
[43:37] brother Bram calls this a misplaced
[43:40] beatitude he also calls it the Forgotten
[43:43] beatitude then in another place you say
[43:46] it's the hidden beatitude and to think
[43:51] of this when we Lotus and look at it
[43:53] brother mem says don't be offended in me
[43:57] referring to this scripture no matter
[43:59] what takes place everything's working
[44:02] right on schedule just go ahead and
[44:05] believe it that's all everything's all
[44:09] right just go ahead and believe it this
[44:13] word this word offended I look at this
[44:18] word here within the scripture it's a
[44:20] word that when we look at it you know in
[44:23] the Greek and then we put it down really
[44:25] to English what the word means is the
[44:27] word scandalize and it is that which
[44:33] would refer to a stumbling block or an
[44:37] impediment that's in the way we'd
[44:39] whereby someone might trip or they might
[44:42] fall it's something that can also cause
[44:45] a person to begin to distrust
[44:48] or desert one whom he ought to trust and
[44:51] obey the calls to cause one to follow
[44:54] away to be offended at one to seeing
[44:56] another what I disapprove of and what
[44:59] would hinder me from acknowledging his
[45:01] authority someone who would stumble
[45:04] getting their foot entangled they feel
[45:07] annoyed we're looking at the thought
[45:11] here on discouragement and I want to
[45:14] continue that this morning on victory
[45:16] over discouragement there's not one
[45:20] person here that has not battled
[45:25] discouragement and there won't be a time
[45:29] until we are delivered from these
[45:33] corrupt bodies that we won't face
[45:38] discouragement we're gonna face times
[45:42] and we have faced times of letdowns
[45:46] times where we've been confused and not
[45:50] understanding certain things there's a
[45:53] lot of things even within life itself
[45:56] there's a lot of unexpected things that
[45:59] come our way the best plans that we can
[46:03] ever make yet how many times that all of
[46:07] the plans that we make there's things
[46:09] that come along that we were not whether
[46:14] it's projects you've done around the
[46:16] house whatever it is even when it comes
[46:19] down to your walk with the Lord there's
[46:23] many things that you know you don't
[46:26] serve the Lord because that everything
[46:29] is going to be easy that's not even the
[46:33] thought of it the whole fault and where
[46:35] everything comes is that you come to a
[46:38] place that you just are falling in love
[46:40] with him
[46:41] who is wooing your heart and you just
[46:44] find yourself surrendering to him and
[46:46] and the whole part of falling in love
[46:49] with him and to where that he himself
[46:51] fully comes to a place of bringing us
[46:55] accepting us in him we rest within that
[46:58] not knowing the tests and trials that
[47:01] will come our
[47:02] there's some times in our life where
[47:04] there's things that when you think in
[47:06] your life in your family there's times
[47:08] that no doubt just in your own personal
[47:10] life that you've been prayed for and God
[47:13] has moved in a very miraculous runway
[47:16] within just a moment and then there's
[47:19] been other times maybe for somebody else
[47:21] in your family or in this same assembly
[47:23] that has had the same request or need
[47:26] and they themselves the way that God
[47:28] would lead it it wasn't in a moment that
[47:30] way but the way things would unfold it
[47:33] would seem like things are just kind of
[47:34] lingering and you know Lord did you hear
[47:37] my prayer
[47:38] did you hear what was Lord that we're
[47:40] looking to you for healing
[47:41] sometimes it's the way that God goes
[47:44] about doing things that within the midst
[47:47] of that time it is something that we
[47:50] don't expect but one thing that I
[47:52] believe that as believers if we can
[47:55] always come back to this place and rest
[47:57] within this is to know that he is God
[48:00] and to know that when we have approached
[48:03] his word God will not step over his word
[48:06] but God is faithful to fulfill his word
[48:10] the Avenue the way that God will go
[48:14] about it sometimes those things are not
[48:16] according to what we would want or what
[48:18] we would even look at that would be the
[48:20] best way but God always knows what's the
[48:23] best way as a matter of fact when every
[48:26] time now through tests and trials that
[48:28] God's Amazing Grace has brought you and
[48:30] I through it when you can really look at
[48:32] it as a believer right now you see the
[48:35] test and the trial that God has brought
[48:37] you through and you see it with value at
[48:40] the time we experience the pressure we
[48:42] experience the strain we experience the
[48:45] burden not on our soul but we experience
[48:48] that within our body in our flesh in our
[48:51] spirit in our mind but yet there is a
[48:53] steadfastness in the heart of the
[48:55] believer to know that in the midst of
[48:57] every circumstance that God is still
[49:00] present that God is working and God will
[49:03] bring me through and that's the comfort
[49:05] of the word even how Paul would you know
[49:07] take moments within the scriptures of
[49:10] where that Paul would write to the
[49:12] Corinthians Paul would write to the
[49:15] Saloni ins and on and on and Paul would
[49:17] take such an expensive part to be able
[49:20] to find this an important part to
[49:22] mention to the believers and to comfort
[49:25] them as Paul could say we comfort you
[49:28] with the same comfort that we have been
[49:31] comforted with those things that we have
[49:33] gone through you know God never let you
[49:36] know Paul know every little step of the
[49:38] way he did let him know I'm gonna show
[49:41] you what great things you'll suffer for
[49:43] my namesake but you know that was not
[49:45] something that caused a timidness or at
[49:49] repeting us or a fear within Paul
[49:51] because Paul had his eyes on him who had
[49:54] called him and him who had made himself
[49:56] known to him and Paul was resting there
[49:59] in him so when trials came their way
[50:01] there's sometimes the escape that came
[50:03] that way was by a basket Bend there's
[50:06] other times where the escape itself God
[50:08] and lead him out a different passageway
[50:10] then there's other times where you know
[50:12] they would come into a place they were
[50:14] able to walk out then there's other
[50:15] times when they were stoned and left for
[50:17] dead none of those things were explained
[50:20] and none of those things were laid out
[50:22] all of those things were unexpected but
[50:25] there was one focus that Paul had and
[50:28] that was to serve the Lord and Paul's
[50:31] focus was because he had been captured
[50:34] by the Living God he was known as a
[50:37] prisoner of Jesus Christ it was that
[50:40] light that he was ordained to reflect
[50:43] that same light to be a light unto the
[50:45] Gentiles to take this same gospel and
[50:48] and bring it to the Gentiles and I look
[50:51] at it like this that offenses and things
[50:53] they'll come you know offenses come in
[50:56] there's no way escaping it you know
[50:59] you've been offended I've been offended
[51:01] there there's all types of things you
[51:03] know where we've been offended the Lord
[51:04] Jesus when we look at this scripture it
[51:07] even speaks of those who you know would
[51:09] receive the word the seed and it would
[51:12] be on stony ground but it never takes
[51:14] root and by and by when persecution
[51:17] arises on behalf of the word they are
[51:20] offended and and you recognize that
[51:23] there's something that is so much
[51:25] greater than your eye that
[51:28] must be on the inside of us then there's
[51:31] got to be an anchor on the inside of us
[51:33] that's beyond anything that you and I
[51:36] can explain it's beyond what our
[51:39] understanding or our making sense of
[51:41] these things and so where we rest within
[51:44] that we come to a place that the
[51:46] scripture tells us we walk by faith and
[51:49] not by sight and to realize that faith
[51:52] itself as the Prophet which so evidently
[51:55] declared to us and we see it through the
[51:57] scripture faith itself is a revelation a
[52:00] direct revelation of the will of God
[52:03] it's not something that you or your
[52:05] pastor has said this or Rafat said this
[52:07] or this it's got to be a direct
[52:10] revelation personally that the same God
[52:14] who speaks and made himself known to the
[52:17] Prophet and through the Prophet must
[52:19] also give you an eye that same faith on
[52:22] the inside because this is what Jude
[52:25] said we're contending earnestly for that
[52:27] same faith for this common salvation and
[52:30] to see that it's a revelation of God's
[52:33] will it's sovereignly given by God the
[52:38] Bible says in Hebrews 11 faith is the
[52:41] substance it's something that you
[52:45] possess because it possesses you as a
[52:49] matter of fact it is the very thing that
[52:51] makes you do what you do it's the thing
[52:55] that drives you we're not we're talking
[52:57] about faith for being a substance that
[53:00] why that you would even forsake the
[53:03] world why that you would cling to him
[53:06] why did you would in everything desire
[53:09] to to be closer to him to live for him
[53:12] to reflect him it's a substance it's a
[53:15] reality that takes a hold upon your life
[53:18] that is more real than everything else
[53:21] surrounds you it becomes more real than
[53:24] the trolls that you're wearing it
[53:26] becomes more real than the ground that
[53:28] you're standing on faith itself is that
[53:31] which the believer is possessed by and
[53:34] is a possessor of that same faith the
[53:38] Bible goes on to say that it's the
[53:40] evidence of
[53:41] things not seen and by it be elders
[53:44] obtained a good report through faith
[53:48] this is an important statement through
[53:50] faith we understand how do you
[53:55] understand through faith and we're not
[53:58] talking about the scriptures are not
[54:00] talking about a blackboard here but it's
[54:03] all drawn out that's not what says our
[54:06] understanding is through faith we be
[54:10] close this guy said this here but no our
[54:13] understanding is by faith through faith
[54:19] we understand that the worlds were
[54:21] framed by the Word of God so that things
[54:23] which are seen were not made of things
[54:26] which do appear but the Bible says it
[54:28] just so clearly like this and lean not
[54:30] to thine own understanding nowhere in
[54:32] the Bible are we asked to understand
[54:34] we're not asked to understand it were
[54:37] asked to believe it believe it by what
[54:40] by faith if you understand it then that
[54:44] makes faith unknown glory you can't
[54:51] understand it but you believe it anyhow
[54:54] if I could understand God I wouldn't
[54:58] have to believe God I do not understand
[55:01] God no man understands God I cannot
[55:04] understand the Word of God
[55:05] but I accepted I believe it I am NOT
[55:09] asked to understand it or Robina God
[55:14] Miliband just puts it like this he says
[55:17] this is what he said in his word that
[55:19] he's the same yesterday today and
[55:21] forever he said in because he has said
[55:23] it he said I believe it I look for it
[55:27] and expected he said God promised grace
[55:30] for me he said I look for it I expected
[55:33] I watch for it and I accept that and
[55:36] that's the same thing that was every
[55:39] promise that God has made and every word
[55:41] of God it is not based upon our
[55:44] understanding of it it's based upon do
[55:47] we believe him who made the promise I
[55:50] guarantee you that Abraham did not have
[55:53] all the schematics
[55:54] all the diagnostics and everything that
[55:57] was laid out on how that he being dead
[56:00] when God allowed him to come to a police
[56:02] to where he can no longer father any
[56:04] children and Sarah was dead he did not
[56:07] have the logistics of how that this is
[56:10] going to happen but the Bible said it
[56:11] very clearly he judged him who made that
[56:15] promise he judged him faithful oh girl
[56:20] hurry brother man tell us he said it
[56:22] wasn't so much that Abraham had faith in
[56:24] the word as there was he had faith in
[56:27] who promised the word oh that makes the
[56:30] difference because when you see him who
[56:33] is the word then you can have faith in
[56:36] what he said that everything he said he
[56:39] will surely bring it to pass you see
[56:41] that's why as a believer we do not we do
[56:45] not stand nor tolerate for one word
[56:48] being taken away or one word being added
[56:51] we stand solemnly upon God's word that
[56:54] God has declared and he has revealed and
[56:57] we can stand upon the Word of God and
[56:59] say this is the inspired Word of God it
[57:02] is the scripture this is my promise this
[57:04] is my book this is where the message
[57:07] that God has sent to us and to lead us
[57:09] back to this Bible faith these are my
[57:12] promises as a believer this is why we
[57:21] walk by faith and not by sight remember
[57:27] as we looked at that some time ago sight
[57:29] is not just these eyes sight deals with
[57:34] every part every sense that could be in
[57:38] there in the spirit realm as well as
[57:41] there within the five gates of our
[57:44] natural body and I say this morning John
[57:48] knew his place in the scripture there
[57:52] was not a doubt that John did not know
[57:54] who he was in first John or John 1:19 I
[57:59] hope you'll bear with me here as I read
[58:00] this if I believe this to be important
[58:03] this is a record of John when the Jews
[58:07] sent three
[58:08] and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him
[58:10] who art thou and he confessed and denied
[58:13] not but confess I am NOT the Christ and
[58:16] they asked him what then art our lives
[58:18] he said I'm not art thou that prophet
[58:22] and he answered no then said they unto
[58:25] Him who art thou that we may give an
[58:27] answer to them that sent us what saith
[58:31] thou of that self he said I'm the voice
[58:34] of one crying in the wilderness make
[58:36] straight the way of the Lord has said
[58:39] the prophet Isaiah now I'm going to tell
[58:42] you John spoke this in humility because
[58:46] you see humility is it comes with more
[58:50] than just agreeing that the word is
[58:53] right but humility comes with allowing
[58:55] that word to be the head and the thority
[58:58] of our life John went out there in the
[59:01] desert he was he was placed out there by
[59:04] God and God made himself known to John
[59:07] oh my a place in the wilderness it was a
[59:09] place away from all that was going on
[59:12] there it was in the city he God made
[59:15] himself known to John and revealed the
[59:18] scripture it was something that it was
[59:21] made known to John not just something he
[59:23] read but it was something that was
[59:25] quickened to his heart that I'm a part
[59:28] of this word and this word is speaking
[59:30] about me more my he didn't find it to be
[59:33] robbery as a matter of fact he found
[59:34] that complementary to the Holy Ghost
[59:37] that had revealed to him who he was and
[59:40] his part was in the word he found it to
[59:43] be the greatest compliment that's the
[59:45] way we are as believers the greatest
[59:47] compliment is simply to believe what he
[59:50] said because he said it they which were
[59:55] of the Pharisees and they asked him and
[59:58] they said to him why baptizeth thou then
[1:00:02] if thou be not the Christ nor Elijah
[1:00:04] neither that prophet Jesus and John
[1:00:07] answered them saying i baptize with
[1:00:09] water but their's standeth one among you
[1:00:11] whom you know not he it is who's coming
[1:00:16] after me is preferred before me whose
[1:00:18] shoe lat
[1:00:20] I'm not worthy to unloose I want you to
[1:00:23] notice how sure he was hallelujah this
[1:00:27] heinous had already been revealed to him
[1:00:30] do you realize what brought him out of
[1:00:32] the wilderness he's be close he had met
[1:00:34] God face to face and God had ordained
[1:00:38] him for this moment and he told him
[1:00:40] exactly where to go God told him where
[1:00:43] to go to be standing there on the Jordan
[1:00:45] he told him what to expect and because
[1:00:47] it was revealed personally to him John
[1:00:50] went there and he stood in obedience
[1:00:53] waiting on him to show up John didn't
[1:00:57] know all the specifics but what he did
[1:00:59] know is what he told me he told me to
[1:01:02] come bad eyes and he told me that
[1:01:05] they're the one that were I am standing
[1:01:07] that he will also be standing in our
[1:01:10] midst that Messiah is on the scene right
[1:01:13] now you see John's ministry was
[1:01:16] declaring that the greater one is here
[1:01:19] it was just like Moses and Joshua he's
[1:01:22] declaring the greater one is here the
[1:01:25] one that can do for you what I cannot do
[1:01:28] he is here a greater one are you with me
[1:01:32] John was sure I want you to catch these
[1:01:34] points that revelation of his place
[1:01:37] within the word gave him assurance these
[1:01:42] things were done in Bethabara beyond
[1:01:44] Jordan where John was baptizing the next
[1:01:46] day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and
[1:01:49] said behold the lamb of God which taketh
[1:01:51] away the sin of the world this is he of
[1:01:55] whom I said after me cometh a man which
[1:01:58] is preferred before me for he was before
[1:02:01] me now notice this is he of whom I
[1:02:04] already said his ministry was already
[1:02:07] pointing to what was going to come it
[1:02:10] was already pointing ahead to another
[1:02:12] pool to another transition that was
[1:02:15] going to be coming
[1:02:16] you see God will always identify what
[1:02:19] he's doing by his word and to think how
[1:02:22] that John was standing here within this
[1:02:24] moment he wouldn't have known the Lord
[1:02:27] Jesus except that the pillar fire the
[1:02:30] angel of the Covenant the
[1:02:32] one that led the children of Israel
[1:02:35] there out of Egypt and brought him into
[1:02:37] the promised land except that he John
[1:02:40] being the messenger of the Covenant
[1:02:42] would recognize the angel of the
[1:02:44] Covenant and by that pillar of fire
[1:02:46] declaring the word to John then John
[1:02:50] could say this is the one behold the
[1:02:53] lamb of God John didn't have to ask
[1:02:54] nobody is this the Lamb of God he didn't
[1:02:57] have to consider is he the one he knew
[1:03:00] it how did he know it he noted by a
[1:03:02] personal revelation it was not everybody
[1:03:05] standing there that saw the pillar fire
[1:03:08] but John saw the pillar fire because it
[1:03:11] was promised him that he would see the
[1:03:13] pillar fire let me tell you you and I as
[1:03:16] believers in this last day you may not
[1:03:18] have realized and recognized it before
[1:03:20] but you and I were promised that we
[1:03:22] would see the visitation and unfolding
[1:03:25] and revealing of the Son of Man and thus
[1:03:27] our you and I were promised and written
[1:03:30] right there in the scriptures there in
[1:03:32] Malachi 4 we were identified there I
[1:03:35] named the characteristic of the word
[1:03:38] being revealed in this hour was written
[1:03:41] there and the reason that you and I can
[1:03:43] see it is not because we were worthy
[1:03:45] it's because that the Lamb of God that
[1:03:48] great pillar of fire the angel of the
[1:03:51] Covenant came on the scene and
[1:03:53] identified his earth that he is the same
[1:03:56] yesterday today and forever I've
[1:03:58] remembered my covenant and I am come
[1:04:01] down God is bound and confirmed in his
[1:04:10] word Oh hallelujah
[1:04:14] John goes on and says in verse 31 I knew
[1:04:18] him not this was not a prearranged thing
[1:04:23] John you you know you guys her family I
[1:04:26] didn't know him you mean you didn't know
[1:04:29] Jesus nah I knew Jesus but I didn't know
[1:04:30] Jesus I did not know he's the one that
[1:04:37] was being spoken of I knew him not but
[1:04:42] what he should but that he should be
[1:04:44] made manifest to Israel
[1:04:46] therefore am I come baptizing with water
[1:04:50] this is why in other words why am i
[1:04:52] doing what I'm doing
[1:04:53] he sent me he revealed to me by position
[1:04:56] and he told me to be standing here job
[1:05:00] did you have anything to do with it no I
[1:05:02] just happened to be the one standing
[1:05:03] here when he came it's not what I knew
[1:05:06] it's what I've surrendered myself to own
[1:05:10] Otis he says and John bear record saying
[1:05:12] I saw the Spirit descending from heaven
[1:05:16] like a dove and it abode upon him nobody
[1:05:19] else John saw it do you realize that's
[1:05:22] the same way with your experience you
[1:05:25] must see the Spirit of God descending
[1:05:28] upon the word it must be that which is
[1:05:30] revealed to you you know the message
[1:05:33] brother man puts on like this and trying
[1:05:34] to do God of service many of us have
[1:05:36] looked at those pictures sometimes that
[1:05:38] you look at it and there's some sort of
[1:05:40] a hidden message within it maybe a
[1:05:42] number or this or that or what have you
[1:05:44] and yet you get to looking at it
[1:05:45] somebody says I see this you say where
[1:05:47] do you see that where I can see it right
[1:05:49] there you see what it is it's that
[1:05:51] message inside of that picture they've
[1:05:53] already seen and once you see it every
[1:05:56] time you look at that picture all you
[1:05:58] see is that hidden message that's there
[1:06:00] you see that's what really matter says
[1:06:02] that's the same way it is with the
[1:06:04] message he said once you see the message
[1:06:07] you can't see nothing else it's been
[1:06:12] revealed to you every time when you're
[1:06:15] reading in the scriptures you're looking
[1:06:17] the message all you see is Jesus Christ
[1:06:20] I tell you what this message is done it
[1:06:23] made me fall more in love with my Bible
[1:06:25] the more and more as I read and pray and
[1:06:29] listen and it's reading in the
[1:06:30] scriptures this message is a very
[1:06:32] scriptural message because if it's not
[1:06:35] then it's not a message of God but it is
[1:06:38] the message of the Lord God sent from
[1:06:41] the throne of God for this hour that we
[1:06:43] are living in it's identified by his
[1:06:46] presence God does not need an
[1:06:47] identification by a school of men he
[1:06:50] identifies his word by his personal
[1:06:53] presence
[1:06:54] I saw the spirit descend
[1:06:59] from heaven like a dove and it abode on
[1:07:02] him he didn't leave it's him it's him
[1:07:07] and I knew him not but he that sent me
[1:07:12] to baptize with water the same said unto
[1:07:15] me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:07:18] descending and remaining on him the same
[1:07:20] as he wants baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:23] see God had already identified by his
[1:07:27] word the scriptural signs that John
[1:07:30] would see that would be Clare that
[1:07:33] indeed this is the Messiah do you
[1:07:37] realize that's the same way in our lives
[1:07:39] that's the way it is in the life of
[1:07:42] every believer that's been born again of
[1:07:44] the Holy Ghost the signs of Christ are
[1:07:47] present within your life it's a word
[1:07:50] that's being expressed and lived out of
[1:07:52] your life it is the very fulfillment of
[1:07:54] John 14:12 and Jesus said the works that
[1:07:57] I do shall you do also it's living the
[1:08:01] same life by the same nature on the
[1:08:05] inside it will reflect the word and I
[1:08:12] saw in bear record this is the son of
[1:08:15] God the Bible says again the next day
[1:08:18] John stood and two of his disciples and
[1:08:20] looking upon Jesus as he walked and said
[1:08:22] behold the lamb of God now John if I can
[1:08:28] look at just another account for just a
[1:08:30] moment the Bible here the Gospel of
[1:08:33] Matthew it begins to also record the
[1:08:38] event where John comes forth preaching
[1:08:41] repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is
[1:08:43] at hand
[1:08:44] and the at hand is always a key phrase
[1:08:48] because that hand means that God is not
[1:08:50] only moving now but it's at hand and
[1:08:53] hand could mean it could be fifty years
[1:08:55] a hundred years thousand years 2,000
[1:08:58] years but it's at hand what is it it's
[1:08:59] time where these things are going to be
[1:09:02] unfolded according to God's perfect will
[1:09:06] you realize in the Old Testament when
[1:09:09] they would have the tabernacle of God
[1:09:10] they would pack up the tab
[1:09:12] Natha love God as the people of God and
[1:09:14] they would pack that Tabernacle and then
[1:09:16] when God the pillar fire would let him
[1:09:18] know
[1:09:18] stop right here unpack it and set this
[1:09:20] up they would actually pack it up and
[1:09:23] unpack it the same way every time each
[1:09:26] one had their responsibility to make
[1:09:29] sure that it was set up properly within
[1:09:32] how it was folded up it would be
[1:09:34] unfolded you know the Holy Ghost will
[1:09:36] never unfold the word improperly but the
[1:09:40] Holy Ghost will always unfold the word
[1:09:42] so that it always declares that Jesus
[1:09:46] Christ is the son of God it will always
[1:09:48] declared that he indeed is the
[1:09:51] tabernacle and dwelling place of the
[1:09:53] Lord God it will always unfold him in
[1:09:56] his present revealing and working in his
[1:09:59] body
[1:10:00] it always unfold in that way now why do
[1:10:05] you have to fold things up you folded up
[1:10:09] so it's easier to carry and that's how
[1:10:12] God has done with his word he has folded
[1:10:15] up the word and clothed himself in the
[1:10:19] promises of the word
[1:10:21] and when it's time he will unfold
[1:10:23] himself from his from his own word John
[1:10:31] goes on ministering and he lets it know
[1:10:34] you know the great religious men of that
[1:10:38] day came out and John said who warned
[1:10:40] you to flee from the wrath has it come
[1:10:42] you see it was a noticing there is a
[1:10:47] judgment that's impending and John is
[1:10:50] looking at them and John knows you
[1:10:52] aren't here because of the right reasons
[1:10:56] why are you here right and John begins
[1:11:01] to identify their serpents so when he's
[1:11:06] saying and he goes on now John dealing
[1:11:09] with this I want to get to this point
[1:11:11] he says they acts in verse 10 of Matthew
[1:11:14] 3 he's laid unto the root of the trees
[1:11:15] therefore every tree which bringeth
[1:11:17] forth not forth good fruit is hewn down
[1:11:20] and tapped in the fire I indeed baptize
[1:11:23] you with water unto repentance but
[1:11:26] he that cometh after me is mightier than
[1:11:28] I whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear he
[1:11:31] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:34] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[1:11:38] and he will thoroughly purge his floor
[1:11:40] and gather his wheat into the garner but
[1:11:44] he will burn up the chaff with
[1:11:45] unquenchable all continuing there in the
[1:11:49] scriptures if you see how that the Lord
[1:11:52] Jesus here just in this event as
[1:11:56] recording as there it does in John he
[1:11:58] goes into the speak of this conversation
[1:12:01] where the eyes of the Lord Jesus met the
[1:12:03] eyes of John and where John and humility
[1:12:06] said I have need to be baptized of you
[1:12:08] but the Lord Jesus staying true to the
[1:12:11] word you see he was bound to fulfill
[1:12:14] every word this was the desire within
[1:12:16] him is to fulfill every word over it be
[1:12:21] to God all all of these things were
[1:12:24] necessary parts it was a script that was
[1:12:28] wrote now it was being unfolded things
[1:12:31] that were packed up when Moses would
[1:12:33] stand there and Moses would wash Aaron
[1:12:35] he would wash there the priests these
[1:12:39] things were they would wash the
[1:12:41] sacrifice it was all attacked but inside
[1:12:44] of there there was a mystery to be
[1:12:46] unpacked and you know I got only unpacks
[1:12:49] when it's time to unpack Alleluia but
[1:12:53] everything that's packed there's a
[1:12:55] reserve time for it to be unpacked don't
[1:13:00] worry you and have been packed up if
[1:13:02] you've got the genuine baptism of the
[1:13:04] Holy Ghost the seal on your soul we are
[1:13:07] sealed unto the day of our redemption
[1:13:10] there's gonna come a day there'll be an
[1:13:13] unpacking out of this body there's a
[1:13:16] body that there that's already reserved
[1:13:18] in the heavens it's called our
[1:13:21] representation there in heavenly places
[1:13:23] of theophany there's a body for us to be
[1:13:26] clothed within because we've been
[1:13:28] clothed in our soul right now you with
[1:13:31] me
[1:13:32] there is that waiting on you and I so
[1:13:34] there is a time of unpacking when
[1:13:36] casting time is Oh
[1:13:38] in this life then comes our deliverance
[1:13:46] and here in the Millennium there'll be a
[1:13:49] further unpacking oh my I wouldn't keep
[1:13:54] on going with this
[1:13:58] John knowed what he was talking about we
[1:14:02] will look at this within the Scriptures
[1:14:04] he knew what he was talking about he
[1:14:08] knew all the signs were right he had
[1:14:12] showed them a psych sign and John know
[1:14:15] that he was the Messiah there that's the
[1:14:18] Messiah there's no doubt about it
[1:14:19] so John coming out of the wilderness he
[1:14:22] blasted these things out another place
[1:14:26] where the RAM would put it the Spirit of
[1:14:27] God within him gushing forth these
[1:14:31] things you see what had been revealed to
[1:14:34] him he couldn't he could only do what
[1:14:37] God had revealed to him you see it show
[1:14:40] something to you and I when God really
[1:14:42] has revealed something to you it puts
[1:14:45] you in action according to the voice
[1:14:47] that is spoke to you your life then
[1:14:51] becomes an action of that voice it
[1:14:54] actually begins to express what he's
[1:14:57] revealed to you when God revealed to
[1:14:59] Abraham regarding that child
[1:15:02] Abraham's actions spoke of what had been
[1:15:05] revealed and what has been revealed it
[1:15:07] is faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:15:10] God
[1:15:11] you know Abraham did not see how was all
[1:15:14] going to come to pass but Abraham knew
[1:15:16] God has promised it I'm gonna confess it
[1:15:18] and I'm gonna go up and continue the ten
[1:15:20] dollar payment on the hospital bill you
[1:15:23] know what he was doing he was being
[1:15:24] obedient to the will of God that Abraham
[1:15:28] see every fold at that time no he only
[1:15:32] saw what was made known for that day and
[1:15:36] that hour and his responsibility was to
[1:15:40] walk in obedience in humility under that
[1:15:43] word that God had revealed and when God
[1:15:46] would reveal more been able more would
[1:15:48] be unpacked and Abraham himself
[1:15:51] would walk in that will of God that's
[1:15:52] been revealed remember faith itself the
[1:15:56] righteousness of God is revealed from
[1:15:58] faith onto faith if there's there needs
[1:16:02] to be a continual and there is by divine
[1:16:05] revelation and actual acting out and a
[1:16:09] moving of God within our life by faith
[1:16:11] ghosts anything that you don't do by
[1:16:13] faith it's unbelievable
[1:16:16] is that right this is why Peter would
[1:16:19] say by the Spirit of God make your
[1:16:21] election and a calling sure Paul would
[1:16:25] pick up in Thessalonians brethren no
[1:16:26] your election right it's important to
[1:16:30] know it's not something to be walking
[1:16:32] around and say well you know do I got
[1:16:34] the Holy Ghost or don't I got the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost let God confirm that to your life
[1:16:39] and let me tell you something God will
[1:16:40] confirm it by his word my brother and
[1:16:43] sister it's deeper than a feeling it's
[1:16:45] deeper than an emotion a matter of fact
[1:16:46] brother band put it like this he said
[1:16:48] the Holy Ghost the evidence it's not
[1:16:50] your reaction to the Holy Ghost but the
[1:16:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost is a life
[1:16:56] that is lived by the word not out of
[1:17:00] fear but out of reverence you're known
[1:17:03] as I've told you before would you ever
[1:17:04] think that brother Brennan was being
[1:17:06] accused around the tabernacle of not
[1:17:07] preaching on the Holy Ghost would you
[1:17:09] all ever think that I I don't know well
[1:17:12] you know I've heard this heard it for
[1:17:13] years that quoting I got to thinking
[1:17:15] about it some years ago I thought lord
[1:17:16] have mercy if there's anybody I would
[1:17:18] never think that you could accuse
[1:17:19] because every message I hear it deals
[1:17:21] with the new birth its life it's token
[1:17:23] hour but in the message Satan's even
[1:17:27] high says there's some people I
[1:17:29] understands been saying Wang brother
[1:17:31] Brandon preaching on the Holy Ghost
[1:17:32] around here huh would you see what it
[1:17:36] was their lack of understanding or what
[1:17:38] the true Holy Ghost was you see Bill
[1:17:42] Bratton ease kids time for that to be
[1:17:43] unfolded brother Brett said then here it
[1:17:45] is he said they were saying many other
[1:17:47] things lying by the RAM preaching this
[1:17:48] and many other things and God said here
[1:17:51] it is it's the person of Christ inside
[1:17:54] of you that is quickened to every word
[1:17:58] for this hour and he follows it and says
[1:18:01] don't want
[1:18:03] so much in demonstration but you watch
[1:18:06] it in action the devil can reproduce
[1:18:12] demonstrations but it don't make me
[1:18:15] fearful of demonstrations Wow because
[1:18:19] that Satan's trap dick tactic to try to
[1:18:22] get you an act to rise up and despise
[1:18:25] prophesying this is what see Paul
[1:18:28] bringing these things out
[1:18:30] you see there's things around it but
[1:18:31] you've got to recognize that way that
[1:18:34] remember well brother Bram said when
[1:18:35] he's seen what was going on there out
[1:18:37] there in Mishawaka and then after you
[1:18:39] know he began to see how this one man
[1:18:41] was truly not really converted in genui
[1:18:43] you know brother BAM he didn't want
[1:18:45] nothing to do it the brother BAM said I
[1:18:46] thought it was amongst a bunch of angels
[1:18:47] and then after that I thought I was a
[1:18:49] munch a bunch of Devils right because of
[1:18:53] this but you see God has a way of
[1:18:56] representing things back to the word
[1:18:58] because why God does not want us to
[1:19:01] despise anything Visenya you've got to
[1:19:03] be careful about this be careful about
[1:19:05] this no not as long as I'm following him
[1:19:07] I only got to be careful that I don't
[1:19:08] follow him this listen friends God has
[1:19:12] not made us in this hour that we would
[1:19:14] walk by fear and all you got to be
[1:19:16] careful there's got to be careful that
[1:19:17] that's not faith that's not faith that's
[1:19:20] worried that's unbelief but real
[1:19:22] reverential fear to the Lord is trusting
[1:19:26] him if I didn't have that I'd be a
[1:19:33] nutcase
[1:19:33] I'd be a nutcase from my own life and I
[1:19:36] sure would be a nutcase as a pastor well
[1:19:43] you understood it look here in Luke 7
[1:19:45] look pick up here in Luke 7 verse 11 it
[1:19:49] came to pass the day after that he went
[1:19:51] into a city called nain now remember
[1:19:53] this scripture this account it's right
[1:19:55] after that the Roman centurion his
[1:19:57] servant has been healed now watch this
[1:20:01] that he went into the city called nain
[1:20:03] and many of his disciples went with him
[1:20:05] and much people and now when he came now
[1:20:07] to the gate of the city behold there was
[1:20:09] a dead man carried out the only son of
[1:20:12] his mother and she was a widow and most
[1:20:15] people the city was with
[1:20:16] and when the Lord saw her he had
[1:20:19] compassion on her and said unto her weak
[1:20:23] not and he came and touched the bier
[1:20:27] that they bear him and stood still and
[1:20:31] he said young man I say unto thee arise
[1:20:34] and he that was dead
[1:20:37] sat up and began to speak and he
[1:20:39] delivered him to his mother
[1:20:41] oh lord I could preach your family
[1:20:46] service right now but we'll go home
[1:20:48] verse 16 and I want you to watch this
[1:20:51] verse and there came a fear on all and
[1:20:54] they glorified God saying but a great
[1:20:57] prophet is risen up among us that God
[1:21:00] hath visited his people I want you to
[1:21:04] look at this word visited his people it
[1:21:06] means to look upon it means to expect to
[1:21:10] examine with the eyes to go see one the
[1:21:14] poor and afflicted the sick to look upon
[1:21:17] him in order to help or to benefit to
[1:21:19] look after half care for provide for
[1:21:22] home ah the Lord Jesus when he looked
[1:21:25] upon that woman who she was standing
[1:21:27] there they had caught her in the act of
[1:21:29] adultery you know what he was looking he
[1:21:32] was visiting and looking deeper than
[1:21:34] what the sin that was there he was
[1:21:36] looking to the depths of her heart he
[1:21:38] knew the motive behind those guys he
[1:21:40] knew what they were trying to do he was
[1:21:42] there visiting aren't you glad that it
[1:21:45] was not a formality aren't you glad that
[1:21:47] you can clearly see that the Lord Jesus
[1:21:50] Christ is the very heart of Almighty God
[1:21:53] where God visited his people to look in
[1:21:56] upon what the real media's aren't you
[1:21:58] glad that he looks upon your need
[1:22:00] amen brother man send the message he
[1:22:02] cares do you care brother Bram said
[1:22:04] within that message he said we know we
[1:22:07] know the answer but what's the calls to
[1:22:10] the problem you know God cares about
[1:22:11] what the cause is
[1:22:13] God can go right down into the depths of
[1:22:15] your life and with sin and then he'll
[1:22:17] move down even into that subconscious
[1:22:20] realm where there are things that maybe
[1:22:21] are trapped there and scars from here
[1:22:24] and from there and there can they be
[1:22:25] things maybe why you react in a certain
[1:22:28] way but the Holy Ghost he
[1:22:30] listenin hiss there's no cavity there's
[1:22:32] no door
[1:22:33] there's no chamber that's off-limits
[1:22:35] because remember he brings liberty to
[1:22:39] the captives he'll bring Liberty to
[1:22:42] absolve of something in the past he
[1:22:45] brings a full Liberty he does not leave
[1:22:48] you and I him bondage this is indeed the
[1:22:51] ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:54] visiting his people I believe this and
[1:23:00] I'm a witness to it
[1:23:03] he didn't come just to recite things he
[1:23:06] came to visit his people he came to look
[1:23:09] in Paul adequately even lays that out
[1:23:12] for us how that he would take up on a
[1:23:13] body like unto us verse 17 now watch
[1:23:17] this is known now this is known verse 17
[1:23:21] and this rumor of him went forth
[1:23:25] throughout all Judea and throughout all
[1:23:28] the region round about and the disciples
[1:23:32] of John showed him of all these things
[1:23:38] so what are they showing John John the
[1:23:42] Lord he said this is what the testimony
[1:23:44] among the people are the Lord has raised
[1:23:48] up a great prophet the Lord is visiting
[1:23:52] his people and when they made this known
[1:23:58] to John John calling unto two of his
[1:24:01] disciples he sent them to Jesus saying
[1:24:05] art thou he that should come or look we
[1:24:11] for another brother BAM picks this up in
[1:24:17] Micah the Prophet ran after he's
[1:24:20] preached series on those Forgotten
[1:24:23] beatitude so forth
[1:24:24] brother Graham says now John had become
[1:24:28] he said now Jesus he didn't express it
[1:24:31] exactly that way but he become kindly
[1:24:36] because you see things did not go the
[1:24:39] way he thought it ought to he had
[1:24:42] introduced to Jesus or a Christ the
[1:24:44] Messiah with a fan in his hand and
[1:24:46] purging the floor and burn up the shaft
[1:24:48] and when he come he was real meek and
[1:24:51] lonely and gentle so we couldn't hardly
[1:24:55] understand what that was it looked like
[1:24:59] he had a letdown
[1:25:01] and he was kind of a little bit of an
[1:25:05] offense this is the messenger of the
[1:25:09] Covenant this is he who was spoken of by
[1:25:13] Isaiah it's he who was spoken of by
[1:25:15] Malachi this is him remember what we
[1:25:20] read earlier he was sure how was he sure
[1:25:25] because it had been identified to him
[1:25:29] but now he's in a state of how the
[1:25:32] Prophet would scribe it a letdown now
[1:25:34] I'm not gonna ask you but every one of
[1:25:37] us have had letdowns
[1:25:39] at one time or another of things that
[1:25:43] did not happen or go according to the
[1:25:46] way that we thought they would go now
[1:25:51] that's not God's fault because it didn't
[1:25:54] happen that way because something didn't
[1:25:56] unfold a certain way it's not God's
[1:25:58] fault but we sure do need help when
[1:26:02] those things come and discouragement
[1:26:04] sets in we need help we need help to be
[1:26:10] able to be lifted out of the letdown now
[1:26:15] let's look at the setting here just a
[1:26:16] moment here is a prophet of God one who
[1:26:21] was spoken of warned in whom as the Lord
[1:26:24] Jesus remember his testimony of John
[1:26:27] even after this has come the testimony
[1:26:30] even that this here is not a greater man
[1:26:33] born of a woman you realize all of the
[1:26:36] prophets and the laws they had spoke of
[1:26:38] this hour they had looked for this hour
[1:26:40] of the coming Messiah
[1:26:42] and so here John what he is what he is
[1:26:45] to do is to go forth
[1:26:48] and baptize as we read and he was to
[1:26:51] wait there until the one whom he was
[1:26:54] sent to to recognize and baptize him for
[1:26:58] sparing him for the sacrifice and
[1:27:01] preparing him for the priestly ministry
[1:27:04] as the high priest sometime of the Lord
[1:27:06] Jesus so this is his ministry this is
[1:27:09] what he is supposed to do and he goes
[1:27:12] forth remember watch this the clarity is
[1:27:15] you go here and here you wait there and
[1:27:17] you're baptized and God never told him
[1:27:20] what day he was gonna show up he never
[1:27:24] told him what day he was going to show
[1:27:26] up but John knew the moment in the hour
[1:27:29] when to step out of the Lorna's he had a
[1:27:31] witness of the Spirit of God now's the
[1:27:34] time to move and John was standing there
[1:27:36] and waiting him that time and then after
[1:27:39] the time had come to where here it had
[1:27:42] run to a place behold the lamb of God
[1:27:44] and to see how that the transition had
[1:27:47] come now we find the setting of a
[1:27:51] prophet who's in prison his Eagle Eye
[1:27:57] you've heard brother Evan say this many
[1:27:58] times
[1:27:59] he's Eagle I got filmed over brother
[1:28:02] brambles say in another place his
[1:28:03] prophetic gift wasn't working what is
[1:28:06] that talking about seeing he wasn't able
[1:28:10] I'm at Elmo naturally he didn't know
[1:28:12] what I was going on
[1:28:14] do you realize job did not know what all
[1:28:18] was going on program tells us I've heard
[1:28:20] but now I see he said what was bothering
[1:28:22] job as a prophet of God he knew God was
[1:28:26] doing something he said but he didn't
[1:28:28] know what God was doing he said but Joe
[1:28:31] stood flat-footed he didn't know what
[1:28:37] was going on but now John hears John's
[1:28:39] ministry it's just like that of Elijah
[1:28:41] remember when Elijah came off of Mount
[1:28:43] Carmel he runs ahead of the chariot even
[1:28:46] and Beach hey have there - just real and
[1:28:48] then as we looked at last week he comes
[1:28:50] to the place of the break down his
[1:28:52] nerves are an edge he's come to a place
[1:28:54] I've done all of this according to thy
[1:28:56] word he has fulfilled
[1:28:58] everything that God has asked him to do
[1:29:01] up to that point so he's standing there
[1:29:07] what's next that's next
[1:29:11] you see God here stands John he's done
[1:29:15] all that God has asked him to do program
[1:29:18] would place this in questions and
[1:29:19] answers on the seals and he would deal
[1:29:21] with this in time in in regards to the
[1:29:23] mind of Christ he says here he says like
[1:29:26] John he said I can relate and so jus he
[1:29:29] said to where after God has told you
[1:29:31] revealed something to you and you go
[1:29:34] forth and do it but then when the mind
[1:29:35] of Christ pulls back he said here you
[1:29:38] are standing in that time saying okay
[1:29:40] what do I do now that's where Elijah was
[1:29:44] at this is where John was that he had
[1:29:46] faithfully listened to me now
[1:29:48] he had faithfully finished his
[1:29:52] commission and in a time when all had
[1:29:58] been delivered now is the time that
[1:30:00] brother BAM says the devil took a look
[1:30:03] and said God ain't using him now and so
[1:30:09] I'm gonna go in there and I'm a Paul
[1:30:11] every blanket over him I'm gonna go in
[1:30:14] there and I'm gonna try to get him to
[1:30:16] disbelieve now I'm going to ask you but
[1:30:21] every one of us have had our down times
[1:30:25] if you're honest you have you've had
[1:30:29] times when you're waiting on an answer
[1:30:31] from God and you don't hear nothing you
[1:30:34] prayed and prayed and prayed and you
[1:30:37] don't hear another come on somebody
[1:30:39] Daniel prayed for 21 days Daniel wasn't
[1:30:44] getting little tweets and little texts
[1:30:46] and little notifications Daniel hi I'm
[1:30:48] up here stuck stuck in traffic you know
[1:30:50] just just you know hold on for a little
[1:30:51] bit he didn't get that but then you kept
[1:30:54] praying he knew God he knew he was under
[1:30:59] the sacrifice Daniel didn't care if he
[1:31:02] was in Babylon his body was in Babylon
[1:31:04] but his soul was back at Jerusalem
[1:31:07] he knew where he was standing with
[1:31:09] Almighty God he prayed and prayed and
[1:31:12] prayed and when it came time that was
[1:31:15] more for you and I than it was for
[1:31:17] Daniel I heard your prayer the first
[1:31:20] time
[1:31:24] glory be to God hallelujah oh my he had
[1:31:29] this break down and blue brain goes into
[1:31:31] talking about how did John he says you
[1:31:34] know he said something now when here he
[1:31:36] says he was the Messiah but then
[1:31:38] something went wrong
[1:31:40] John had introduced the Messiah with the
[1:31:43] fan in his hand going up to burn the
[1:31:45] chaff but he found out the works of
[1:31:47] Jesus he was meek and lowly lowly it
[1:31:50] worried him he didn't know what to say
[1:31:53] he said there's something he thought
[1:31:55] listen he thought there's something
[1:31:57] wrong here somewhere where the round
[1:32:00] continues to bring this on down to the
[1:32:03] characterization that's being expressed
[1:32:04] of how that John was looking at what he
[1:32:08] preached and he's looking at the actions
[1:32:12] you see he preached he's a mighty judge
[1:32:15] that's coming Maddi god that's gonna
[1:32:18] burn it all brother BAM said there's a
[1:32:20] lot of Pentecostal brother I'd love to
[1:32:21] get a hold of that everything was
[1:32:23] judgment burn it up burn it up burn it
[1:32:25] up
[1:32:27] remember I said instead of that a great
[1:32:31] mighty man like that here comes this
[1:32:32] meek and lowly oh but he said brought is
[1:32:37] someone no doubt somewhere something's
[1:32:38] wrong he thought it wasn't right he
[1:32:42] become dismayed like many of us do when
[1:32:46] we see things going on that isn't what
[1:32:49] we think is just right oh I'm noticing a
[1:32:53] pattern he thought we think I continue
[1:32:55] to see these words throughout the
[1:32:57] Forgotten beatitude we think he thought
[1:33:00] well what in the world was John looking
[1:33:01] at but same he couldn't have been
[1:33:03] looking at the message no he was looking
[1:33:04] at the message but you see what it was
[1:33:07] nothing was wrong with the message
[1:33:09] nothing was wrong with the prophecies it
[1:33:13] was John's thinking
[1:33:16] who when we see things going on that we
[1:33:21] think isn't just right we become
[1:33:24] dismayed don't be worried it'll be all
[1:33:28] right
[1:33:28] the devil got a hold of him in there and
[1:33:31] brother Brandon goes on now he says you
[1:33:33] know he said sometimes he said we think
[1:33:35] things ain't working right but he said
[1:33:36] everything's all right
[1:33:37] I just refer to these places and
[1:33:39] highlighted John got a little worried
[1:33:43] you've been worried and I've been
[1:33:45] worried me to tell you something God
[1:33:48] will not fail he will not fail what he
[1:33:55] said he performs it may not be according
[1:33:59] to how we think but he never asked us
[1:34:02] what we thought he never asked us do you
[1:34:05] think I'm doing all right what's the
[1:34:09] latest Gallup poll on my job on your
[1:34:11] life how do you think I'm watching over
[1:34:14] the message you give me the latest
[1:34:16] Rutgers poll Reuters poll whatever poll
[1:34:18] it is that smells like a polecat to me
[1:34:21] it's not up to us to give approval
[1:34:24] ratings it's up to us to do what God
[1:34:28] said do and stand there in faith here's
[1:34:34] a little I'm just reading these words
[1:34:37] he's a little meek gentle fella
[1:34:40] shoulders stooped down no beauty we
[1:34:43] should desire him a man of sorrows
[1:34:46] acquainted with grief the remm says he
[1:34:49] got to thinking about all this a fellow
[1:34:51] acting like this something's wrong
[1:34:55] something's wrong no he's talking I saw
[1:35:00] him I know it's him but he don't act
[1:35:03] like that
[1:35:05] remember says it was a little different
[1:35:08] a little humble man you see he said what
[1:35:11] was different from what John John was
[1:35:14] preaching to John it was different but
[1:35:18] to Jesus it was right on track
[1:35:21] it was right on listen this is the
[1:35:24] brother mem cells like this
[1:35:25] he says his preaching was different he
[1:35:28] was pushed around from place to place a
[1:35:31] judge a judge pushed around from place
[1:35:38] to place and running here and there so
[1:35:42] that seemed kind of strange he couldn't
[1:35:46] understand it now remember if you can
[1:35:50] understand it if you can understand it
[1:35:53] faith is a nod if you can't explain it
[1:36:01] faith is a nod did you see there was a
[1:36:04] hidden part I hope you'll just give me a
[1:36:06] few moments here you see as we talked
[1:36:09] about the unpacking of God's Word I I
[1:36:11] could just spend months on this but I'm
[1:36:13] not gonna keep you here months when you
[1:36:18] look at God's Word and John declared
[1:36:21] what we read from Matthew that his fan
[1:36:25] is in his hand he will thoroughly purge
[1:36:27] his floor and gather his wheat into the
[1:36:30] garner but he will burn up the chaff
[1:36:32] with unquenchable fire you see John was
[1:36:36] preaching there that there is a judgment
[1:36:39] that is coming you see there was a
[1:36:42] hidden part that was in there just like
[1:36:44] when you read in Daniel about the 70
[1:36:47] weeks in there is a hidden part of the
[1:36:50] other where the mercy of God is poured
[1:36:52] out to the Gentiles but it's a hidden
[1:36:55] part that has to be unfolded because
[1:36:58] otherwise it just reads it looks like
[1:37:00] it'll continue on but there's an
[1:37:02] unfolding of a hidden part that is there
[1:37:04] you see there hos a redeeming work to be
[1:37:07] done
[1:37:08] listen to me John couldn't see the
[1:37:11] hidden mystery of God veiled in the
[1:37:13] truth of the message he was ordained to
[1:37:15] proclaim it was hidden he didn't see
[1:37:19] this he didn't see oh there's gonna be
[1:37:21] two thousand years oh there's gonna be a
[1:37:24] Gentile bride John didn't see that John
[1:37:27] said he is going to burn it up
[1:37:30] this is what's gonna take place so
[1:37:32] imagine imagine this here you've got
[1:37:35] what as you're proclaiming according to
[1:37:37] the word these are not John's words
[1:37:39] these are not John's thoughts this is
[1:37:41] God's thoughts so you don't have to take
[1:37:44] them back and say I shouldn't have said
[1:37:46] that but what it is is the thinking
[1:37:48] concerning it you see Jesus didn't look
[1:37:51] like a judge but he was a judge you see
[1:37:54] John was looking at through the view of
[1:37:56] when he would come judge and set up the
[1:37:59] kingdom within Israel in the Davidic
[1:38:01] Kingdom you with me John is looking this
[1:38:05] is all he can see you say well he's a
[1:38:06] prophet why can't he see this God only
[1:38:10] reveals and unfolds what's needful for
[1:38:13] you and I to understand right now God
[1:38:16] don't let come on I'm quoting he don't
[1:38:19] let his prophets know everything God
[1:38:22] unfolds it no wonder the Prophet could
[1:38:24] stand there through the message and he
[1:38:27] would tell us in the church ages when
[1:38:28] he's preaching many times Sardis an age
[1:38:30] oh he said I could stand here and preach
[1:38:32] months on one of these points brother
[1:38:34] Ram goes on a minute in places then in
[1:38:36] the opening part of the birth pains he
[1:38:38] said God will send the ministry forth
[1:38:40] after this that will actually be able to
[1:38:42] take the things that have been spoken
[1:38:44] and make more sense of these things it's
[1:38:48] not man's mind but it's the Holy Ghost
[1:38:50] the same one who gave it is able to
[1:38:53] unpack it sometimes God gives packages
[1:38:56] and you got opener and then there's
[1:38:59] other times it's not time to open them
[1:39:01] when it's time to open them you don't
[1:39:03] need a pry bar to open them
[1:39:04] he opens and he reveals them he unfolds
[1:39:10] it and when it's unfolded he don't take
[1:39:13] one part of the word away it don't take
[1:39:16] one thing or answer or we we mean we
[1:39:18] don't need this and no you don't do that
[1:39:19] it keeps Jesus Christ to be the same
[1:39:23] yesterday today and forever
[1:39:26] every time he unpacks himself from
[1:39:31] within his word all glory be to God so
[1:39:34] here was the truth the announcing the
[1:39:37] arrival of the Messiah by the
[1:39:38] vindication of the pillar fire not to
[1:39:40] think about this there there would have
[1:39:42] to be an outpour
[1:39:44] and offering up in order for the holy
[1:39:46] ghost which John preached to be poured
[1:39:48] out by the Lord Jesus there would have
[1:39:50] to be a rejection by the Jews John did
[1:39:53] not see this but there would have to be
[1:39:55] a rejection by the Jews you see there
[1:39:57] were there would be a trimming there of
[1:39:59] that olive branch and there would be a
[1:40:01] grafting in of the wild olive branch as
[1:40:03] a matter of fact listen to me now there
[1:40:05] was none of them that seen it even when
[1:40:07] Peter and them was called to the house
[1:40:09] of Cornelius Peter would have never went
[1:40:11] to that house if God had spoke to him in
[1:40:13] a dream and said listen boy I want you
[1:40:15] to stop calling them clean that which I
[1:40:18] have made clean and when they got there
[1:40:20] there was some other Brethren that came
[1:40:22] and they watched the Holy Ghost fall on
[1:40:24] him and you know what they said it fell
[1:40:26] on them the same as it did us at the
[1:40:30] beginning so they said how could we
[1:40:34] refuse the plan of God but you see it
[1:40:38] was Paul my Peter Paul who would catch
[1:40:42] and unfold the mystery of the Gentiles
[1:40:46] that as Paul said in Ephesians was
[1:40:48] hidden there that hidden mystery it
[1:40:51] would be the Spirit of God that would
[1:40:53] unpack the hidden mystery of a calling
[1:40:56] out of a Gentile bride now I ask you
[1:41:00] whose thoughts would you rather walk by
[1:41:02] your thoughts my thoughts or God's
[1:41:05] thoughts then if we're gonna walk by
[1:41:08] God's thoughts we've got to wait for God
[1:41:10] to fulfill him because if we don't wait
[1:41:12] for God to fulfill them
[1:41:13] nobody judgment judgment judgment
[1:41:17] judgment now remember the mercy of God
[1:41:20] is not looking over sin the mercy of God
[1:41:22] is dealing with it he is a judge are you
[1:41:25] with me he was a judge but he was not
[1:41:28] this was not time to set up on the
[1:41:30] throne it was not the time to call the
[1:41:32] world into judgment this was the time to
[1:41:34] where he was coming to take away the sin
[1:41:37] of the world even John identified this
[1:41:40] he was coming as the judge for what to
[1:41:42] judge the Prince of this world he was
[1:41:45] coming to do away with and help you and
[1:41:48] I by His grace the blood that was shed
[1:41:50] and the imparting of that life to be
[1:41:52] able to come to a place of our sons and
[1:41:55] daughters of God that
[1:41:57] would be anointed by that same spirit
[1:41:59] and he would reveal who we really were
[1:42:02] all of this and so much more packed
[1:42:05] right after that comma right here right
[1:42:08] now all of this is packed in right after
[1:42:10] that when he called it a colon semicolon
[1:42:12] Rob Terry says garner all of this is
[1:42:14] packed right in there how do you get all
[1:42:17] of that in that small space well how do
[1:42:19] you get all that out of his side come on
[1:42:22] somebody but his size was open he was
[1:42:25] not a great big man it was not something
[1:42:27] ring big but you notice he had just
[1:42:29] opened up his side and out of his side
[1:42:31] he took the very elements that was
[1:42:33] needed to make up his bride Jesus
[1:42:36] himself was a mystery and inside of him
[1:42:38] was another hidden mystery and it was to
[1:42:41] be unpacked and unfolded and what would
[1:42:44] it be it would be the tabernacle of the
[1:42:46] Living God being unfolded down through
[1:42:49] the ages upon this rock I will build my
[1:42:52] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[1:42:54] prevail against it he started on a true
[1:42:57] foundation and build it up to the
[1:42:59] capping time in this hour where he sends
[1:43:01] the seventh star the messenger of the
[1:43:04] Covenant to introduce the coming of the
[1:43:06] Lord they introduce this is the time of
[1:43:09] judgment striking the earth all of that
[1:43:13] is packed right there right there it's
[1:43:18] packed but it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:43:21] unpack it
[1:43:23] yeah the okay shippo's go there yeah
[1:43:25] they go there oh yeah the veil goes
[1:43:27] right there and see everybody knows
[1:43:28] their part every scripture all put
[1:43:31] together will declare Jesus Christ and
[1:43:34] he will set in the middle of it
[1:43:37] because before judgment there's mercy
[1:43:40] I imagine brother BAM didn't look like a
[1:43:43] prophet with squirrel blood on him I got
[1:43:49] a thing about down the way to church
[1:43:50] tomorrow dear Lord man he was standing
[1:43:53] there a prophet of God messenger of the
[1:43:55] Covenant here to introduce the angel of
[1:43:57] the Covenant in this hour he would stand
[1:43:59] right there squirrel blood whiskers grow
[1:44:00] it all out maybe stand there with a
[1:44:02] flannel on and whatever more and here he
[1:44:04] was standing there talking to a man he
[1:44:07] identified it rot in nature led that man
[1:44:09] right to the Lord been man was against
[1:44:13] God but in reality there was something
[1:44:15] on the inside down there it was only
[1:44:17] that darkness that was over his heart
[1:44:20] but when the light struck that the
[1:44:22] darkness couldn't stay there no more why
[1:44:25] the angel was passing through the
[1:44:28] neighborhood
[1:44:29] I'm telling you that same angel of a
[1:44:31] covenant is here with us this morning
[1:44:34] that same God he's here with us he said
[1:44:38] I'll never leave you nor forsake you the
[1:44:41] seventh angel came and gone but remember
[1:44:43] he was here to identify there's one
[1:44:46] mightier than I who was here and the
[1:44:50] mighty angel did not leave the scene it
[1:44:57] was a mystery to the Jews
[1:44:59] this was unpacked Paul would unpack what
[1:45:04] was in Hosea I will provoke them to the
[1:45:06] envy by a nation of a people who was not
[1:45:10] a people but have now become a people
[1:45:16] let's just break and come back
[1:45:25] even in the scriptures of Malachi 4 5 &
[1:45:28] 6 when God identifies that the first
[1:45:32] coming of Elijah the spirit upon John
[1:45:35] the Baptist would turn the hearts of the
[1:45:37] father's to the message of the children
[1:45:42] between there and he shall turn the
[1:45:46] hearts of the children to the father
[1:45:47] between that little space 7 Gentile
[1:45:50] Church ages hidden in the word once the
[1:45:56] word is opened then it reveals you bet
[1:46:01] you've seen let's think of this now
[1:46:04] sometimes it's the hidden part that
[1:46:07] troubles us sometimes it's the hidden
[1:46:10] part in a marriage and I'm talking about
[1:46:12] things that you didn't expect things
[1:46:14] that you didn't hear things are hidden
[1:46:15] parts that were with your children
[1:46:18] things are hidden parts on your job
[1:46:19] sometimes it's hidden parts the troubles
[1:46:23] because you see when God's revealed
[1:46:25] something you can stand right there and
[1:46:26] you can stand on it but sometimes it's
[1:46:29] things that's hidden unexpected things
[1:46:31] that come up that you can't see or see
[1:46:38] sometimes even where brother Branham
[1:46:40] would talk about instructing people how
[1:46:42] to hang on
[1:46:45] after being prayed for for their healing
[1:46:50] he would instruct him how to hang on to
[1:46:53] it
[1:46:53] because there was going to be hidden
[1:46:55] parts to it are you with me
[1:46:58] they could be prayed for and maybe they
[1:47:01] were rushed by ambulance into an interim
[1:47:03] urn tomb that had nothing to do that
[1:47:05] that prayer that God was not sufficient
[1:47:08] and answering that prayer and nothing to
[1:47:11] do with it that is only a hidden part
[1:47:13] and a hidden part tests faith
[1:47:19] but if our thinking was I was prayed for
[1:47:24] I shouldn't have to do nothing there's a
[1:47:28] right way to expect and what sure to
[1:47:31] expect is him he might come in in many
[1:47:36] different forms but you'll always know
[1:47:39] him when he comes he might come in a
[1:47:44] different way but just be expecting him
[1:47:48] when those hidden parts comes and on the
[1:47:51] word and say the Lord I'm standing on
[1:47:54] your word this is what you said because
[1:47:57] remember as the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:00] with the mind of Christ that's been
[1:48:03] revealed to you you've got a secret in
[1:48:05] your heart and that secret is I am
[1:48:07] making one more move until he tells me
[1:48:11] if he don't tell me I'm keeping still
[1:48:15] but while I'm keeping still I'm going to
[1:48:17] confess he sealed me because after all
[1:48:21] he is a high priest of our confession of
[1:48:25] our confession that is the word that is
[1:48:28] him a hundred incredible how that in the
[1:48:35] midst of prison in this situation John
[1:48:38] is watching the actions meek lowly the
[1:48:42] Lord is visiting his people and John
[1:48:46] Cena says it's this said this go ask if
[1:48:50] he's the one he's watching the actions
[1:48:52] the actions are right on with the word
[1:48:56] but John's thoughts John's thoughts it's
[1:49:02] not according to John's thoughts you see
[1:49:04] the Lord Jesus had already spoke through
[1:49:07] the prophet Isaiah even when Lord Jesus
[1:49:09] was here in the in the Book of Luke I'm
[1:49:11] coming down the Bible had already
[1:49:13] declared the Spirit of the Lord God is
[1:49:15] upon me I was there 61:1 because the
[1:49:19] LORD hath anointed me you find the same
[1:49:21] thing when the Lord Jesus picks this up
[1:49:23] and it moves it from prophecy to
[1:49:25] fulfillment he takes a word that was
[1:49:28] there and unpacks that
[1:49:30] in that generation the Spirit of the
[1:49:34] Lord God is upon me because the LORD
[1:49:36] hath anointed me to do what to preach
[1:49:39] good tidings unto the meek he has sent
[1:49:42] me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[1:49:44] proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[1:49:46] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:49:48] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:49:51] the Lord now remember in the Book of
[1:49:52] Luke the Lord Jesus he stops right there
[1:49:55] see he's the one he stops right there
[1:49:58] because there's a day of mercy before
[1:50:00] judgment is poured out both say miles
[1:50:03] that are full of love this morning one
[1:50:06] day that same eyes will be full of fire
[1:50:10] I'll tell you friends there's I happen
[1:50:12] to gain and there's a hell to lose hell
[1:50:17] is a real place hell ain't no joke
[1:50:21] there's gonna be many people in hell
[1:50:24] that are disappointed come on somebody
[1:50:30] they've been patted on the back and told
[1:50:32] this and told that and everything but
[1:50:34] they're gonna be disappointed I'm not on
[1:50:36] my boot licker I'm not talking about the
[1:50:38] drunkard I'm tell my church people I'm
[1:50:42] telling you there's a happen to gain and
[1:50:45] I'm telling you this morning that the
[1:50:46] reason that you serve God you don't
[1:50:48] serve Him under the frown of a Serpent's
[1:50:50] brow you do not serve Him because if I
[1:50:53] don't I'm gonna go to hell if I don't do
[1:50:55] this he'll be displeased with me if I
[1:50:57] don't do this no sir you ain't serving
[1:50:59] god you're still under mentality of a
[1:51:01] slave but remember the love of God it
[1:51:04] came down to proclaim Liberty to
[1:51:06] captives a captive is one who could not
[1:51:09] help himself he was sold into bondage he
[1:51:12] was sold but there came an announcement
[1:51:15] that a redeemer has come there is
[1:51:17] Liberty that is proclaimed a blood that
[1:51:20] had been offered atonement have been
[1:51:21] given now let the trumpet of the Jubilee
[1:51:24] sound identifying himself in the word
[1:51:31] once again would we rather stay
[1:51:35] according to the word or go according to
[1:51:37] our thoughts
[1:51:40] Oh mah brother BAM said in God and
[1:51:44] simplicity he said on that Easter
[1:51:46] morning hallelujah that's where he
[1:51:48] purged the floor he swept out the trash
[1:51:51] all right brother
[1:51:52] yes indeed and the wheat was sealed to
[1:51:55] the garner laying there in the ground
[1:51:57] with eternal life resting in it waiting
[1:52:00] for that great day that we're going to
[1:52:01] speak of the coming of the Lord when
[1:52:04] that life will come to life and will
[1:52:06] rise in that resurrection be caught away
[1:52:09] with him in the air and be gathered into
[1:52:11] the garner and the trash will be burnt
[1:52:15] yonder the husk that's wrapped around
[1:52:18] and tried to pull it this way or that
[1:52:20] way will be burnt with unquenchable fire
[1:52:30] but God has a plan did I say I was
[1:52:34] closing
[1:52:38] it's kind of like saying the kingdom of
[1:52:40] heaven is at hand I asked you a question
[1:52:50] what if John would have known all this
[1:52:56] what if Paul would have known Paul just
[1:53:02] take it easy we gotta wait till the
[1:53:07] seventh angel has come
[1:53:08] and then that message has to become
[1:53:11] flesh in those people just I mean you
[1:53:14] can you can you can express it but don't
[1:53:17] be so urgent like it's now see they
[1:53:22] preached it's at hand
[1:53:25] Cosi was at hand for those in though in
[1:53:28] that age you're given an opportunity
[1:53:30] when it's at hand at your door are you
[1:53:35] with me but you see Paul himself said
[1:53:37] though we are alive and remain Paul
[1:53:41] preached it by the vindication of the
[1:53:44] Resurrection in his soul
[1:53:46] Paul was a part of this resurrection
[1:53:49] come on somebody he preached it by
[1:53:52] vindication he preached and said we're
[1:53:54] going to be alive and remain God did not
[1:53:58] allow them he kept that hidden for this
[1:54:01] hour and for this time he didn't see all
[1:54:07] of that you know why there wouldn't have
[1:54:09] been the urgency that there ought to be
[1:54:11] and that's the same way let me say it to
[1:54:13] you there's not one promise one more
[1:54:16] moment there is not one even minute
[1:54:19] that's promised to you and I do you
[1:54:21] realize how close we are to the coming
[1:54:23] of the Lord
[1:54:24] my friends I'm telling you it is very
[1:54:27] close things that were seeing signs that
[1:54:31] were saying and I'm not just talking
[1:54:32] about out there the Prophet over and
[1:54:34] over through the message speaks to you
[1:54:36] and I of where where the word is being
[1:54:38] preached conviction being lifted from
[1:54:41] the hearts of the people and they asked
[1:54:43] the question not just in souls in prison
[1:54:45] but throughout the message is the door
[1:54:47] of mercy being closed think of how when
[1:54:49] brother bran preaches that in souls in
[1:54:51] prison
[1:54:52] brother Ram says Oh God I hope it's not
[1:54:54] I trust it's not Lord could it be he did
[1:54:56] not know after that moment but when he
[1:55:00] speaks that at that moment it is a word
[1:55:02] of an announcement that it is set in
[1:55:05] motion remember that the opening of that
[1:55:08] seven seal Matthew 24 it is the
[1:55:12] beginning of Sorrows it is the beginning
[1:55:14] of the beginning of the end things are
[1:55:20] set in motion and then there's people
[1:55:25] that take those things which you know
[1:55:27] and have known people take things right
[1:55:29] out of context of the word all mercies
[1:55:31] over and this and that and of course
[1:55:32] mercy is over but them and their brood
[1:55:34] they're all in you know they don't sound
[1:55:38] like a heart of mercy at all else
[1:55:41] pouring out are no more than a mercy
[1:55:45] that's judgment but if you have received
[1:55:48] the judgment of the Lord by receiving
[1:55:51] his mercy and been accepted in him than
[1:55:53] you can believe for others what is
[1:55:55] transpired for you can also happen for
[1:55:57] one another this is why brother Branham
[1:55:59] could say when he's asked the question
[1:56:01] should it should it be that we should
[1:56:03] look at it than mercy is over he said
[1:56:05] for goodness sakes don't you ever think
[1:56:08] that let alone say it don't ever think
[1:56:12] it so I don't think it I just keep
[1:56:17] preaching until he says it's over and
[1:56:19] when it's over it's over
[1:56:21] Oh nah but you see John John was looking
[1:56:33] at this the program said you know John
[1:56:35] was looking and said I know that Messiah
[1:56:37] sign is right I just know that's right
[1:56:39] but this meek and lowly and I don't get
[1:56:43] it I can't figure it out I can't make
[1:56:45] ends meet with it you ready for this
[1:56:48] great point you're not supposed to make
[1:56:52] ends meet
[1:56:57] you mean it's not my burden no my burden
[1:57:00] is this is what God has said I want to
[1:57:03] see it fulfilled in my life I want my
[1:57:05] life to be so wrapped in it and it in me
[1:57:07] and I want to see that in the lives of
[1:57:10] my brothers and sisters and so that's
[1:57:12] how I live that's how I pray because
[1:57:14] this is what he's doing and this is what
[1:57:17] he will do you're not supposed to make
[1:57:21] into I can't I can't make sense of this
[1:57:23] okay I can't well how do I have faith ah
[1:57:27] faith is not understanding faith is
[1:57:32] believing you see where John is act in
[1:57:37] his a walk is where you and I come to
[1:57:39] will come to and that is after God has
[1:57:42] revealed his will remember it then
[1:57:45] becomes a holy faith with holy works
[1:57:47] United together and being expressed
[1:57:50] but after John has done all that God has
[1:57:52] told him to do then he must have
[1:57:55] patience and now faith that was actively
[1:57:59] you see it being expressed now that same
[1:58:02] faith is where he's resting by the jelly
[1:58:05] he's just gonna rest he just rest this
[1:58:08] is this is what God has told me to do
[1:58:10] what do you do next I don't know but I
[1:58:12] know what he told me to do and I know
[1:58:13] what he spoke to me so it's resting the
[1:58:16] same faith
[1:58:17] oh my you and look and say well that is
[1:58:19] great as that faith he was out there man
[1:58:21] I mean clothes in the Carmel
[1:58:22] you know the camel's hair and and
[1:58:24] baptizing and this and that then is rain
[1:58:27] is great who it's greater because that
[1:58:32] faith it don't weaken it grows greater
[1:58:34] to hold you in the hours when it's
[1:58:37] silence to hold you in the hours that
[1:58:40] you don't know the next step you don't
[1:58:42] even know the hidden part what's being
[1:58:44] unpacked and going on you don't know
[1:58:46] what you're resting when it seems like
[1:58:50] things are going all wrong holy this
[1:58:54] can't be right ah this and that and you
[1:58:56] see where you're at you see where you
[1:58:58] had just look it shows it shows friends
[1:59:01] anxiousness is never
[1:59:04] a product of the Holy Ghost if you're
[1:59:09] looking at the word and becoming anxious
[1:59:10] that's not the Holy Ghost well I've done
[1:59:15] it you don't have to make Nothing fit
[1:59:17] you have to just believe him walk
[1:59:20] faithful to what he's revealed simple
[1:59:23] words feast of the trumpets walk in the
[1:59:26] light that he has revealed and as you
[1:59:28] are faithful and walk in it he will
[1:59:30] unfold more because God wants you to
[1:59:34] walk on solid ground I'm closing if I
[1:59:43] could tell you this is the very next
[1:59:44] statement if I can tell you the whole
[1:59:47] thing and you note it all and I know it
[1:59:49] at all it would no more be things
[1:59:53] anything that I can perfectly explain
[1:59:57] it's not faith anymore by faith you are
[2:00:03] saved by faith are you healed you just
[2:00:06] believe it you can't explain it you just
[2:00:09] believe it I can't explain how God heals
[2:00:12] the sick I can't explain that I can't
[2:00:16] explain how God say my soul I cannot
[2:00:19] explain that but I know he did it I have
[2:00:23] faith that he did it and if I can
[2:00:28] explain it then it's no longer faith but
[2:00:32] faith rest in his word listen have you
[2:00:38] ever felt like things were going wrong
[2:00:39] sometimes huh huh funny you should ask
[2:00:43] that you ever been discouraged huh oh
[2:00:48] well headway you mean you didn't get
[2:00:50] your flowers right no no I'm talking
[2:00:52] about here I'm talking about here uh-huh
[2:00:57] I've been discouraged just like you have
[2:01:00] but I realize I've got a choice to make
[2:01:03] do I look at that or do I look to him
[2:01:06] who was working and who is the one to do
[2:01:09] something about it
[2:01:11] I got a choice like brother brems said
[2:01:14] brother over and over brother in all he
[2:01:17] said if I look to everything I see
[2:01:19] around me I would be the most
[2:01:23] discouraged person in the world he said
[2:01:27] that what I do I look to the end of the
[2:01:31] road look away to Jesus those who are
[2:01:40] looking for him will he appear the
[2:01:42] second time without sin you see looking
[2:01:45] for him does not mean ignoring it means
[2:01:48] he's the answer
[2:01:49] he's the remedy he's all that we have
[2:01:51] need of he is our sufficiency he is
[2:01:53] performing his word doc didn't need
[2:01:56] sarah's help Sarah performed her help
[2:02:00] before to try to make a perfect it
[2:02:03] didn't work all he endured oon was
[2:02:06] creating a wild man come on somebody but
[2:02:09] God said I don't need Sarah all your
[2:02:11] effort I just need you to believe so God
[2:02:15] had to do something that would force
[2:02:17] that unbelief to the surface so bad to
[2:02:20] judge it and deal with it don't order it
[2:02:23] be the dog and you know what he came to
[2:02:25] liberate her and deliver her right there
[2:02:27] to where Sarah herself would have the
[2:02:29] testimony that her husband did that God
[2:02:32] is faithful and jetsam faithful and the
[2:02:35] Bible says there in Genesis 21 I believe
[2:02:38] it is that the Lord visited Sara as he
[2:02:41] had promised gloried be to God but if we
[2:02:50] looked at the situation's the Lord just
[2:02:54] promised it
[2:02:55] he bruh ham what are you doing going
[2:02:59] down there to Greer you're messing
[2:03:03] everything up that would have been you
[2:03:06] and I you and I would have been no no
[2:03:09] something hey you watching don't let him
[2:03:11] get out this land it's getting barren
[2:03:12] here's a testing time
[2:03:16] ooh I can't believe this him I believer
[2:03:20] look at him look I'm saying gods just
[2:03:23] spoke to him God showed up at the 10 her
[2:03:30] brother Brent says I wondered why God
[2:03:31] would put those things in there I know
[2:03:37] to be unpacked in this generation for
[2:03:43] what for you me we would need that
[2:03:46] comfort of the scripture as the prophet
[2:03:50] put it in his words without that we
[2:03:54] wouldn't know the grace of God for our
[2:03:56] lives
[2:03:57] oh my out of that scripture he unpacked
[2:04:01] God's grace for this generation I'm
[2:04:06] closing and the answer is brother Doug
[2:04:14] you're gonna like that one aren't you
[2:04:15] here's the answer go show John what you
[2:04:21] see he didn't give him a book here oh no
[2:04:26] hold on let me tag these quotes and you
[2:04:28] take all these quotes and you give him
[2:04:29] the John John didn't need more quotes
[2:04:32] are you with me he didn't need more
[2:04:34] quotes he already knew what he needed
[2:04:39] was is the same kind of an experience
[2:04:43] that he had in the desert he needed a
[2:04:47] fresh experience not words not a letter
[2:04:52] he needed a fresh experience to where
[2:04:55] when these brethren would come back and
[2:04:57] show John they would show the presence
[2:05:00] of God accompanying their life remember
[2:05:03] remember said they were taught of what
[2:05:05] the Messiah should be so they were there
[2:05:07] watching in that as the Lord Jesus said
[2:05:09] sit here and watch what's going on and
[2:05:10] they went back and they told John the
[2:05:13] things that were taking place let me
[2:05:15] tell you something that was all that was
[2:05:17] needed the Lord knows how to comfort and
[2:05:20] visit his people
[2:05:23] you know what that did that just calls
[2:05:26] it removed that film upon his I has
[2:05:31] brother BAM told us over and over he
[2:05:33] said what was taken place he said is
[2:05:35] that God he said John what John thought
[2:05:39] wasn't right he thought surely there was
[2:05:42] something wrong he said many times we
[2:05:44] think that too and I'll just listen to
[2:05:46] this point there's many times that we
[2:05:49] think too that it isn't working right
[2:05:53] but it's working right as long as we
[2:05:57] know that he's here what difference does
[2:06:02] it make
[2:06:03] it's working right you see where the
[2:06:06] focus comes back not in making ends meet
[2:06:08] as long as he's here let me tell you
[2:06:14] something the third pole was in
[2:06:15] operation even when the Prophet was
[2:06:17] still looking for the tent
[2:06:19] come on somebody just because he was
[2:06:22] looking for it we're gonna set that tent
[2:06:23] up and we're gonna just because that he
[2:06:25] was looking for it did not mean it
[2:06:27] wasn't in effect remember it is the
[2:06:29] opening of the word that mighty angel
[2:06:32] Christ descending down taking the seals
[2:06:36] off of himself revealing himself and now
[2:06:39] bringing his bride his people into a
[2:06:41] relationship by an invisible union what
[2:06:44] the Prophet could not fully see why
[2:06:47] because it cannot be explained when they
[2:06:54] came out of that little room remember
[2:06:56] brother REM says that light that was
[2:06:59] over me left me and went over that
[2:07:03] noodle and said I'll meet you in there
[2:07:08] there's only room for you and Jesus only
[2:07:12] room for me and Jesus
[2:07:15] and they walk through that little room
[2:07:18] bound with crutches on costs and all
[2:07:21] those other things they came out the
[2:07:23] other side and there was a recorder
[2:07:25] standing there what has happened I don't
[2:07:27] know I was bound now I'm free they
[2:07:33] walked out of that little room with
[2:07:35] authority over what they have been bound
[2:07:38] yet you understand that's the authority
[2:07:41] of this word that same word that is
[2:07:43] brought to you and I a true token
[2:07:45] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:47] Ghost this is the very reason in this
[2:07:50] hour it's time to leave this world it's
[2:07:55] time for the exodus of the leaving of
[2:07:58] this land of these bodies and going in
[2:08:01] to that land in my father's house are
[2:08:05] many mansions as long as he's here what
[2:08:12] difference does it make
[2:08:22] there been a lot of things that happen
[2:08:25] I'm just so I'll just talk for me I
[2:08:28] didn't see it coming but it came there
[2:08:32] have been many services that I preached
[2:08:34] young people services and other places
[2:08:36] right here right here I didn't see I
[2:08:41] didn't see it coming there's some needs
[2:08:43] that were in people's lives that I could
[2:08:45] know about but yet I didn't cut them
[2:08:48] they wasn't explicitly or clearly sated
[2:08:51] right here and he would look at it in
[2:08:53] that service and if you had asked me in
[2:08:54] that service but assignment would you
[2:08:56] have put this service to think that this
[2:08:58] person would actually be delivered or
[2:09:00] liberated in that nothing's impossible
[2:09:04] with God but if you're asking me I'd
[2:09:06] have said that text don't seem like it
[2:09:09] but the testimonies you know what all
[2:09:12] that does and I trust that you've got
[2:09:15] that same testimony you know of all that
[2:09:17] does it just calls us me to trust him
[2:09:20] more I don't know what he's gonna do in
[2:09:24] a service I don't know how is the
[2:09:27] service is gonna end unless he's told me
[2:09:29] at times call a prayer line or do this I
[2:09:31] don't know that sometimes he lets me
[2:09:33] know ahead of time sometimes he doesn't
[2:09:35] let me know I don't know the effect
[2:09:36] sometimes I cannot see the effect of the
[2:09:41] word right then but sometimes it's a day
[2:09:48] later sometimes it's a week later and
[2:09:51] sometimes it'll be when we stand there
[2:09:54] gather together say praise God we made
[2:09:58] it by His grace we made it by His grace
[2:10:03] His grace packed us through brother
[2:10:06] God gave us strength it's been worth at
[2:10:09] all every step of a mile
[2:10:13] no wonder brother Branham comes right
[2:10:16] back around and says tell John don't be
[2:10:20] scared
[2:10:21] don't worry John
[2:10:24] everything is working just right
[2:10:30] everything he said you make sure you
[2:10:33] tell him I'm right on schedule
[2:10:38] John was on schedule Jesus was on
[2:10:43] schedule
[2:10:44] John Benton fully all all the parts to
[2:10:48] Jesus schedule but Jesus did and Jesus
[2:10:52] knew John fulfilled his schedule and so
[2:10:56] all John had to do is John you ran your
[2:10:59] course you know the reed shaken with him
[2:11:02] win you see the devil couldn't shake him
[2:11:04] off his foundation trouble him in his
[2:11:07] fossil this is going wrong and this is
[2:11:09] going wrong this is going wrong this
[2:11:10] isn't right but this sir he could do all
[2:11:12] that but you cannot remove that
[2:11:14] foundation all those battles could go on
[2:11:18] there but you can't move that foundation
[2:11:20] it's solid it's resting there because
[2:11:23] brother Ram would dramatize that he kept
[2:11:25] coming back and said I know I've seen
[2:11:26] that sign I love that I love that
[2:11:30] building Sam do you believe that I
[2:11:31] believe it on my heart I believe that
[2:11:33] was on my heart you know why I'm a
[2:11:34] witness of that you can let the devil
[2:11:37] with the devil can come try to say this
[2:11:39] and try to say that but around comes
[2:11:40] back to testimony and witness that you
[2:11:43] know by personal experience but I saw
[2:11:45] him I know he's the one and John would
[2:11:48] come right back around don't you see
[2:11:49] what John was doing John was battling
[2:11:52] the devil would come
[2:11:53] John was battling he was gaining victory
[2:11:57] over discouragement and then when the
[2:12:01] Lord Jesus sitting back victory
[2:12:03] go tell him go tell him what you see go
[2:12:06] tell him they walked in there told him
[2:12:08] victory over discouragement what was the
[2:12:13] source of his discouragement his
[2:12:15] thinking and the devil was punching him
[2:12:18] around on his thinking but once he got
[2:12:21] his thoughts in line and under the word
[2:12:25] John John could say you liar
[2:12:28] get out here our new use alive I stood
[2:12:31] right here you aren't gonna talk about
[2:12:33] it I watched I know the angel the cousin
[2:12:35] it came suddenly to his
[2:12:37] ball I witnessed it I am a witness are
[2:12:45] you a witness are you a witness by the
[2:12:50] living experience of a living God person
[2:12:54] I don't understand everything that's not
[2:12:56] what I'm asking you do you have faith in
[2:12:59] what he has asked you to do whatever he
[2:13:03] saith unto thee do it if he said roll
[2:13:08] away the stone roll away the stone if he
[2:13:11] said repent billet if he said be
[2:13:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ do
[2:13:16] it if he said submit your life under the
[2:13:18] blood to be sanctified do it if he sad
[2:13:21] be filled with the Holy Ghost do it if
[2:13:23] he said to you be of good cheer for I
[2:13:27] have overcome the world do it if he said
[2:13:31] take my yoke upon you for it is do it
[2:13:34] whatever he sayeth unto thee do it and
[2:13:38] then after you've done it stand and
[2:13:43] having done all to stand stand therefore
[2:13:47] with your loins Girt about with truth
[2:13:51] having armed the whole armour of God
[2:13:55] I know what God's revealed to me I know
[2:14:00] God has revealed himself to me a little
[2:14:04] part a little part inside of me are you
[2:14:07] a seed that was there on the inside of
[2:14:11] us and the quickening power comes what
[2:14:14] does it do it unpacks and unfolds the
[2:14:19] glory of God
[2:14:23] you become a living Tabernacle of the
[2:14:27] Living God's dwelling place he unpacks
[2:14:29] the virtues that have been sealed in you
[2:14:33] he unpacks calling us unpacks patience
[2:14:36] unpacks temperance he he unpacks what's
[2:14:40] already there every leaf every apple has
[2:14:45] already been there in that one seed put
[2:14:50] it in the light put it in the water and
[2:14:52] what happens what is in it will be
[2:14:55] unpacked and made manifest Tabernacle of
[2:15:01] the Living God unpacked by the Holy
[2:15:03] Ghost himself through the word not my
[2:15:08] will that will be done let that mind
[2:15:13] that was in Christ being us also well
[2:15:17] the bomb would say at the end voices let
[2:15:20] my mind let my meditation let everything
[2:15:24] let it be wrapped into this world
[2:15:26] let it be wrapped into this word not my
[2:15:30] thinking Lord not my thoughts but thy
[2:15:34] word the Spirit of God can convey
[2:15:40] Invictus but when conviction has come of
[2:15:42] the Holy Ghost he will always point us
[2:15:45] in the place of restitution is that
[2:15:51] right
[2:15:52] correction itself in the New Testament
[2:15:54] means healing it's to bring healing to
[2:15:59] our lives and a real reality has is Lord
[2:16:04] not my will dying be done not my
[2:16:08] thoughts everything's working just right
[2:16:10] brother Samuel this and this and this
[2:16:12] about the message don't you think no no
[2:16:13] I'm not worried all I can say is I'm
[2:16:17] faithful to what he has told me to do
[2:16:20] and if I'll be faithful to that and you
[2:16:23] be faithful to what he's told you to do
[2:16:24] he who has made himself known will bring
[2:16:28] himself us through it
[2:16:32] because out of it all he's bringing
[2:16:34] forth a bride that's Bible bought word
[2:16:36] solid blood washed and will be raptured
[2:16:39] he is doing that don't you love him the
[2:16:46] same you don't you get concerned oh I do
[2:16:47] don't you get discouraged I do I do
[2:16:51] don't you see things that don't seem
[2:16:52] right yeah I do I do I do
[2:16:57] but like as I said years ago for someone
[2:17:01] who asked me that I said if I focused on
[2:17:02] that years ago and said if I focused on
[2:17:04] all of that or had mercy I'd never have
[2:17:06] victory in my life but what I have chose
[2:17:09] to focus on is him
[2:17:11] because if I will stay focused on him
[2:17:14] then he will produce in us himself you
[2:17:20] with me
[2:17:22] so after all you're not my work I'm not
[2:17:26] your work we're his worthless signature
[2:17:31] addition of Jesus Christ himself or
[2:17:43] Jesus
[2:17:49] I pray Heavenly Father what is your word
[2:17:55] you have spoke to us this morning
[2:17:59] what in these messages Lord
[2:18:06] you had me to move this channel last
[2:18:08] week Lord there's a reason there's a
[2:18:11] purpose Lord Father I pray God for every
[2:18:20] heart listening sometimes the Lord
[2:18:25] there's things that do happen we don't
[2:18:28] understand it sometimes things happen
[2:18:32] and it just seems like that they don't
[2:18:35] seem right the Lord I I've always looked
[2:18:40] in I realized some orders even as you
[2:18:43] your prophet hit tell us we'll clear
[2:18:47] back in question answers 1954 he would
[2:18:52] take lord and reference that scripture
[2:18:54] in the book of Ecclesiastes about study
[2:19:01] the weariness yet Paul would admonish
[2:19:05] Timothy study to show thyself approved
[2:19:08] shows there's a balance and in Lord
[2:19:12] Father I believe in my heart you're
[2:19:15] going to love the truth I love you Lord
[2:19:21] God
[2:19:22] but as your prophet admonished us he
[2:19:25] says don't ever get away from yielding
[2:19:29] he said sometimes he said we're guilty
[2:19:31] of so much of study study study that we
[2:19:34] don't yield board
[2:19:42] you're the interpreter of your word as
[2:19:46] your prophet would speak to us and give
[2:19:48] us counsel and say we should pray for
[2:19:53] Revelation and Lord as we pray there's
[2:19:58] things that we have on our heart
[2:19:59] sometimes there's questions we have Lord
[2:20:03] we'd love for the answer to come right
[2:20:05] then and there but Lord God I know that
[2:20:08] from my own self and there's believers
[2:20:10] here then they've been serving you
[2:20:12] longer than I have but they can share
[2:20:15] this same testimony that there's
[2:20:17] questions that they maybe would still
[2:20:20] have on their hearts and there's
[2:20:22] questions that you've you've answered
[2:20:24] sometimes questions that we've had on
[2:20:27] our hearts for maybe 5 10 15 some years
[2:20:33] those questions lord
[2:20:35] there was no questioning of you buts
[2:20:38] things that Lord that we just didn't
[2:20:40] understand or see clearly but father to
[2:20:44] know that there's a reason why there's a
[2:20:49] reason why you do things you'll say
[2:20:52] things a certain way
[2:20:55] and it's always in your time that you
[2:21:01] open your word to our hearts
[2:21:07] or Jesus it's just like Lord with the
[2:21:10] messages that's here the things that you
[2:21:13] bring or does not wait on the
[2:21:17] inspiration from you to be a minister
[2:21:22] does not mean that I have a Bible
[2:21:26] although I do to be able to minister
[2:21:31] does not mean that I would have message
[2:21:34] search software program although I do
[2:21:38] but it's to wait on you for Lord I'm a
[2:21:45] servant I'm here to serve
[2:21:50] not what things that Lord that I'm
[2:21:52] looking at and study things that Lord
[2:21:55] old mine just glory and delighting him
[2:21:58] but in the simplest of times Lord that
[2:22:03] even you would have me to share with the
[2:22:04] people of how that certain things you
[2:22:06] would put on hold you would say deal
[2:22:09] with this lord god I just I thank you so
[2:22:13] much because Lord every time when I come
[2:22:17] to the house of God whether I come and
[2:22:20] I'm here to be refreshed or I'm here to
[2:22:25] be used as an instrument board I want to
[2:22:28] be spoken to
[2:22:31] what God you know every need you knew
[2:22:35] who is the great judge you know the
[2:22:39] secrets and intents of the heart
[2:22:41] you know our false father you know our
[2:22:46] disappointments you know our
[2:22:48] discouragements what Jesus I pray
[2:22:54] Heavenly Father this morning that God
[2:22:57] throughout this building and Lord no
[2:22:59] matter where one would be father where
[2:23:04] they would be at in their walk with you
[2:23:06] I pray that the Lord that they would
[2:23:09] take courage in you and that their faith
[2:23:14] would say Lord I'm trusting you making
[2:23:21] myself more available to you
[2:23:25] that you would continue your working in
[2:23:28] my life
[2:23:30] what I give my mind to you I commit my
[2:23:34] thoughts
[2:23:36] things that I've had all formed out and
[2:23:39] it didn't turn out this way Ben Lord
[2:23:44] then they take that as an experience to
[2:23:48] just keep my eyes focused on you as you
[2:23:52] had admonished us in your word your
[2:23:55] prophet taking this example don't be
[2:23:58] scared don't be worried everything is
[2:24:03] working right on schedule
[2:24:07] what I just heard your prophet the other
[2:24:11] morning real early in the morning lean
[2:24:14] not to your own understanding as he
[2:24:16] stood there Lord in the latter part of
[2:24:18] that message he Lord God he asked for
[2:24:20] people then no longer wanted to lean to
[2:24:24] their own understanding he asked him
[2:24:27] Lord for those whose had ups and downs
[2:24:30] and ins and outs and they no longer
[2:24:33] wanted to lean upon their self efforts
[2:24:35] but they wanted to lean and rest in the
[2:24:38] promise of the true baptism of the Holy
[2:24:40] Ghost he asked him to stand at that
[2:24:43] moment Lord God and he told him he said
[2:24:46] now as I pray for you you may not
[2:24:50] receive it right here right now but you
[2:24:54] stand on that promise and he said you
[2:24:57] watch God bring it to past in your life
[2:25:00] as you stand on that promise father
