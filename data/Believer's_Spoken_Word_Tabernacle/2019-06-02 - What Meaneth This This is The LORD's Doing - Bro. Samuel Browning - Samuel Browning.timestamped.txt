[25:26] when the brother Tim said that he asked
[25:29] the Lord not to take his mom I hope I

[25:38] way I knew what he was doing

[25:47] so I gave my testimony and then on
[25:50] Friday I stopped where my son was living

[36:08] much I didn't want to keep you standing
[36:11] very long we'll go right into the word
[36:14] here in just a moment when we Lord
[36:19] willing when whenever we finish here
[36:21] this morning then we'll have a little
[36:23] bit better of a time when the worship
[36:25] and testimony service for this evening
[36:28] and just certainly looking forward to
[36:31] that I just really believe with all my
[36:34] heart I I feel that it to be of the Lord
[36:37] you know if you don't it's important to
[36:41] testify of what God has done in your
[36:45] life and nobody can tell it like you can
[36:49] other people get excited about your
[36:52] testimony but no one can tell it like
[36:54] you can and remember that it's a benefit
[36:58] and it's a blessing for the entire body
[37:00] of Jesus Christ don't ever underestimate
[37:03] any testimony and what God has done
[37:07] because the reality is it's what he has
[37:09] done and we need to I believe that we
[37:13] need to give him honor and glory we need
[37:16] to bring peace offerings we need to
[37:19] bring offerings of Thanksgiving as I
[37:22] said in the email we don't want to be
[37:24] like the lepers nine of them that went
[37:26] their own way and they just they David
[37:30] they just you know came they got their
[37:32] healing and then they just left but
[37:34] there was one who went on it gripped him
[37:37] and he turned back around and he came
[37:39] back and he said thank you thank you he
[37:44] came back to worship him and I believe
[37:48] that was on my heart that we have much
[37:51] to be thankful
[37:53] for I'd like to start to speak on that a
[37:56] little this morning
[37:57] and we're just I want to say you know
[38:02] words itself cannot express from my
[38:08] heart what it means when the meetings
[38:14] that are had and then to see the vision
[38:16] and the burden and I I'd just be very
[38:18] honest with you I never seen anything
[38:21] going and becoming a yearly thing that's
[38:24] not what I've ER I and I didn't even
[38:26] envision that it was just the Lord
[38:28] dropped you remember the first meetings
[38:29] were brother cadre digs that was just
[38:31] what God dropped on my heart for that
[38:33] time but since that time I just have
[38:36] felt just such a such a burden and an
[38:38] urgency and I'll just say it to you like
[38:40] this there's no way that it could be
[38:43] possible and done if it were not for
[38:47] each and every one of you there's
[38:50] different ones that are behind the scene
[38:52] different brothers and sisters as is
[38:54] expressed there in the email many of you
[38:56] who sacrificed and you gave maybe you
[38:59] didn't cook but you gave and then others
[39:01] of you who cooked and then two different
[39:04] brothers and sisters who were setting up
[39:06] right out there so that when we came out
[39:08] of the service on Saturday that all of
[39:11] that would be possible for us to go into
[39:14] and names itself would just fail to even
[39:19] be able to call I tried to gather all
[39:21] the different names and I just wasn't
[39:24] able to do that but I know different
[39:26] ones that had did that and I'll say it
[39:29] to you like this right here there's no
[39:31] way that it could have been done without
[39:34] your support for the vision and the
[39:39] burden that God has given
[39:41] there's no way it could be done and you
[39:44] know something when things itself when
[39:47] God dropped something on my heart you
[39:49] know even as times in the past I would
[39:51] ask questions even when we did the
[39:54] marriage banquets and I would get
[39:55] together those who were putting that
[39:57] together and I just asked them how do
[39:59] you feel do you feel you have the
[40:02] strength you feel you have that to
[40:04] continue with in this because it's not
[40:06] anything that I can do I can't bring it
[40:09] I can't bring it all together and I but
[40:12] I want to say that's why we're a body
[40:14] and how beautiful is the body of Jesus
[40:18] Christ because every little thing that
[40:21] that has been done it's not been absent
[40:24] in the sight of Almighty God and we're
[40:27] just we're thankful and I'll say it like
[40:29] this even beyond even with all of that
[40:33] that has been prepared in the natural
[40:35] how much went into these services all
[40:38] your prayers the fasting
[40:43] say brother Sam no it would have
[40:44] happened anyway no it wouldn't it
[40:47] wouldn't brother Tim Humes did not bring
[40:50] these services in his briefcase you'll
[40:54] see a little bit this morning if it was
[40:56] not for hearts that were desiring to see
[41:00] God move God would have never moved but
[41:04] I believe that God you see these are
[41:06] things that we we battle even within our
[41:11] humanity you come out of we come out of
[41:13] the week of services and those three
[41:15] services it was necessary to have a
[41:18] focus of what God would do but remember
[41:21] what God has done you take that
[41:23] spiritual traction and let it propel you
[41:27] onward into the heights of Almighty God
[41:29] sure you're probably now some of you
[41:32] even by the time Thursday rolled around
[41:34] you started feeling the effects in your
[41:36] physical body of where you were standing
[41:39] in eternity you see our bodies were not
[41:43] built for this that's why our bodies
[41:47] that's another reason we're going to be
[41:49] changed you know why we're here in these
[41:51] physical bodies we get tired and you
[41:54] know after you've come down out of the
[41:58] services like that and you know
[42:00] sometimes by the time you know you start
[42:02] you start coming in on Wednesday and
[42:04] Thursday finally and you think my why do
[42:08] I just fill you know you're gonna know
[42:10] you were tired but why do I feel like I
[42:12] do well your body here we word dwelling
[42:15] even though in this building but we
[42:17] moved out of this address we were out of
[42:21] this address we were sitting in heavenly
[42:25] places and what we received in heavenly
[42:30] places it is in effect upon our lives
[42:34] I say God is so good
[42:37] he is so good I I don't even feel like
[42:39] I've got word I got to going around and
[42:43] maybe I told you this already but I got
[42:44] to going around the house like a lot of
[42:46] times in the or you know in the early
[42:47] morning and looking just at the plants
[42:50] and I like to look and see if my
[42:51] blossoms and things like that and I was
[42:53] going around I just got to thinking
[42:55] about the goodness of God what God has
[42:59] done and I think I had a spell coming
[43:01] around that backyard now that really
[43:04] ain't anything new for me but boy it was
[43:07] good to have a fresh experience
[43:09] oh my whether I was looking for blossoms
[43:15] on my roses but there was something that
[43:17] it's so blossomed in my heart I was just
[43:21] oh my taint
[43:22] I lost my I was losing myself and all of
[43:24] a sudden I come around the patio and I
[43:26] see my neighbor's standing on the other
[43:27] side I thought he's not gonna understand
[43:31] this what what language is he saying but
[43:38] God is so good I think God has taught
[43:43] I've said it like this God has taught us
[43:47] so much within these services and I
[43:50] believe that we're constantly as
[43:51] believers growing and we're learning
[43:54] spiritually God has taken these things
[43:59] where we always talk about you get what
[44:01] you what you expect but you see God has
[44:04] brought that to a level of expectation
[44:06] we we see that we recognize you realize
[44:10] that that you have control over these
[44:13] services and what I mean by that is is
[44:15] you're praying you're calling out to God
[44:18] Lord come and meet us here Lord there's
[44:21] a need within my life whatever that need
[44:24] is maybe it's a need for somebody's not
[44:25] even gathered here but you realize you
[44:28] are that point of contact you are one
[44:30] who can stand in for them where lot was
[44:33] down there in Sodom but Abraham was an
[44:36] intercessor when the judgement was upon
[44:40] all the wise men and he in in in in
[44:42] Babylon Daniel was one who could stand
[44:45] there and say don't be hasty let's go to

[50:06] you're being seated turn with me one
[50:08] more place in the scripture in Luke 15
[50:16] turn with me to Luke 15
[50:22] and we just want to I just want to pick
[50:24] pick up here in Luke 15 on verse 20 and
[50:30] to read just a few verses here scripture
[50:37] and he arose and came to his father
[50:42] when he was yet a great way off his
[50:45] father saw him and had compassion and
[50:48] ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
[50:51] and the son said unto him father I have
[50:55] sinned against heaven and in thy sight
[50:58] and AM no more worthy to be called thy
[51:01] son but the father said to his servants
[51:04] bring forth the best robe and put it on
[51:08] him and put a ring on his hand and shoes
[51:11] on his feet and bring hither the fatted
[51:14] calf and kill it and let us eat and be
[51:18] merry now notice the direction who's
[51:21] giving these directions the father the
[51:26] father said bring hither the fatted calf
[51:28] and kill it and let us eat and be merry
[51:34] for this my son was dead and is alive
[51:38] again he was lost and is found and they
[51:43] begin to be merry
[51:47] now let's go here this is where I want
[51:50] to kind of draw from here a little bit
[51:51] this morning verse 25 now his elder son
[51:56] was in the field and as he came and drew
[52:00] nigh to the house he heard music and
[52:04] dancing and he called one of the
[52:07] servants and asked what these things
[52:12] meant nah he's got a problem with music
[52:18] and dancing
[52:22] he caught us what does this mean
[52:27] and that's what I'd like to try to speak
[52:30] this morning a little bit what mean is
[52:33] this what meaneth this I'm not talking
[52:40] about something 2,000 years ago but I'm
[52:45] talking about the effects of what took
[52:47] place 2,000 years ago being manifested
[52:51] in our lives in our myths I'm not even
[52:56] talking about something clear back in
[52:58] 1963 or 1965 I'm talking about what God
[53:03] has done in our midst in our lives this
[53:07] day even that of last week and this week
[53:12] what meaneth this and with going along
[53:18] with that I would like to say also if I
[53:22] can have a little bit of room brother
[53:23] Brian on the title this is the Lord's
[53:26] doing you see every image you say it
[53:34] like this every spiritual happening that
[53:37] takes place every spiritual happening it
[53:40] hidden it is to be interpreted by the
[53:43] scripture when you you consider when God
[53:48] sent Moses down to Egypt he revealed
[53:53] himself to Moses by the promise through
[53:57] the promise and now that promise was
[54:01] working itself in Moses life and it
[54:05] would then be that to think when the
[54:08] people were down there in in Egypt now
[54:11] remember they were down there for 400
[54:15] over 400 years but the Bible tells us
[54:18] that God began to hear the cries of the
[54:22] people now it wasn't that they hadn't
[54:25] been praying I believe they probably
[54:27] were praying but you know their prayers
[54:29] where you know maybe Lord give me a
[54:32] better task
[54:32] Master Lord lord help me and give me
[54:35] strength today so I can make the bricks
[54:37] but all of a sudden the prayers with the
[54:40] time the Bible says in the process of
[54:43] time all of a sudden their prayers
[54:45] became different the prayers began got
[54:48] to a place where I'm tired of being down
[54:51] here in Egypt you see that had to be a
[54:55] longing reach in their heart that would
[54:58] be a longing that would match in God's
[55:01] heart and that would take God moving on
[55:04] their heart as it did God moving on
[55:07] Moses heart you know program tells us
[55:10] God works on both ends at the same time
[55:13] he had to condition the people to
[55:16] receive the word that was coming forth
[55:19] what am I saying the people had to get
[55:22] hungry enough when they got hungry
[55:27] enough then God said now it's time for
[55:30] me to move you see God creates those
[55:34] conditions and I I don't want to leave
[55:38] that out but I want to emphasize that it
[55:40] takes the Holy Ghost moving upon our
[55:43] lives for and for those conditions to be
[55:46] brought forth out of our life if we are
[55:49] and I believe this the people of the
[55:52] promise then has the people of the
[55:56] promise then it is there for God to
[55:59] condition our hearts in our lives to be
[56:02] ready to receive from him as he would
[56:06] make his work known to us it's it's very
[56:09] it's very fitting you see you and I
[56:12] cannot take credit for it and say well
[56:14] you know it was all me I did something
[56:17] you know you can't take credit for
[56:19] anything and let me tell you if you try
[56:21] to do that God will remind you quickly
[56:24] that it's not you doing it even for you
[56:29] let me just say it like this for you for
[56:31] me and God they even give the
[56:33] inspiration that he gave and the focus
[56:36] for the services and the inspiration to
[56:39] pray it was
[56:40] same holy ghost that did that that one
[56:42] brother Samuel it wasn't you it was God
[56:45] moving on our hearts Amen it was God
[56:50] working it was God working there with
[56:53] brother Tim and all of those parts
[56:55] together and you can see when everything
[56:58] just works together to find the mind of
[57:01] the Lord and seeking for God God will
[57:03] come on the scene God will move so every
[57:10] spiritual happening is interpreted by
[57:13] Scripture and I want to say this if we
[57:16] could turn to Ephesians chapter 1 this
[57:18] morning as we would turn to Ephesians 1
[57:21] you find here and I want to make this
[57:24] statement very clear that Ephesians as
[57:28] we were reading there before Ephesians
[57:31] parallels Joshua you see they have been
[57:35] called out of the land of Egypt but when
[57:39] they were called out then here they are
[57:41] in the wilderness and they they
[57:44] themselves are the ones who made the
[57:46] decision to stay in the wilderness they
[57:50] rejected let me just say it clearly they
[57:53] rejected the power of God that's what
[57:57] they rejected they made that decision
[58:00] because they knew they knew that they
[58:03] looked at themselves and they knew we
[58:06] can't do it ourselves but look what
[58:11] Joshua what Caleb said the Bible said he
[58:15] stilled the people sometimes we need to
[58:21] be steeled
[58:26] that God can speak to us and Caleb he
[58:30] made that declaration that he says if
[58:33] God be with us
[58:37] then the inhabitants they'd be bred for
[58:40] us amen
[58:43] they've God be with us he Calif was not
[58:46] looking at the opposition he was looking
[58:50] at God it had to be God that would bring
[58:54] them into the land it would have to be
[58:57] God that would acquit them they were not
[58:59] an army of themselves they were not a
[59:02] trained army but God didn't want him to
[59:06] be a trained army they only want him to
[59:09] be a people that was surrendered as a
[59:11] treasure in his hand that God could take
[59:15] simple people that would be considered
[59:17] offscouring
[59:18] and weakness but God said if you yield
[59:21] to me I'll make my power and my glory to
[59:25] be they know through your life and
[59:27] that's where caleb was standing did all
[59:31] the stand he stood right there day after
[59:35] day brother joy he stood right there on
[59:37] that promise over and over and over he
[59:42] stood there
[59:42] oh my you think about when the Bible
[59:47] tells us you read in the book of
[59:49] Deuteronomy the Bible says in the 38th
[59:51] year they begin to now move and get
[59:55] ready to come into the land as they got
[59:58] ready to come in the land
[59:59] you know God had it to where there was a
[1:00:01] couple kings that God said you go ask
[1:00:04] this king of Bashan or AAG of Bashan I
[1:00:09] don't know if maybe I have it backwards
[1:00:10] or whatever but you get the point when
[1:00:13] you look at this how did God asked and
[1:00:15] said ask him if you can pass through the
[1:00:17] land but you see the Bible says God
[1:00:20] stirred up that King that that king came
[1:00:23] out after Israel but here's a new
[1:00:26] generation that's been rose up you see
[1:00:28] what God's gonna do he's got to manifest
[1:00:30] his power to build faith in the new
[1:00:34] generation they have heard all of his
[1:00:37] testimonies they have seen his eyes they
[1:00:40] have gathered manna day after day but
[1:00:43] they
[1:00:43] need to see the Lord mighty in battle
[1:00:45] they need to see his power revisited
[1:00:49] upon the Church of the Living God again
[1:00:52] to bring back that same face whether
[1:00:55] we're not saved because we know it we're
[1:00:58] saved because there's a faith on the
[1:01:00] inside that when this fails there is a
[1:01:03] faith that moves us another King came
[1:01:10] out as well that King was smitten before
[1:01:13] them two kings are you with me to King's
[1:01:17] were smitten and then there would come
[1:01:20] the crossing on the third God was
[1:01:25] building their faith that's what the
[1:01:31] word of the Lord does it builds our
[1:01:33] faith in him I could say it like this
[1:01:39] this is why God does not want you
[1:01:42] focused on yourself he wants you focused
[1:01:47] on him that's why he moves upon your
[1:01:52] heart and here you repent you couldn't
[1:01:57] do that unless God first calls you
[1:01:59] that's a work of the power of God you
[1:02:03] would keep on going your own way but
[1:02:05] that's a work of the power of Almighty
[1:02:07] God that you would even turn right there
[1:02:12] then God comes along now he can do it
[1:02:14] all at once but I mean then I'm just
[1:02:16] laying this out then God comes along and
[1:02:18] he cleans out the old habits out of your
[1:02:21] life all the things that would have a
[1:02:23] hold upon your life what does he do he's
[1:02:26] manifesting his power he's manifesting
[1:02:29] remember the scripture that brother Tim
[1:02:31] read I think it's 1st Corinthians 1
[1:02:32] verse 30 of how that he hath made him to
[1:02:35] be Redemption sanctification all of
[1:02:38] those things to us see it's building our
[1:02:40] faith not in ourselves well I gotta lay
[1:02:43] this down and I gotta stop this and I
[1:02:45] got to do this no we look to him he is
[1:02:49] our sanctification we
[1:02:52] ask for that power in that blood to be
[1:02:55] released Lord cleanse me Lord Jesus well
[1:03:01] if it it's preparation to cross into the
[1:03:05] promised land
[1:03:06] so Ephesians parallels Joshua because
[1:03:09] while they were in the wilderness they
[1:03:12] could not be recognized the potential
[1:03:18] the reality all of the mystery that was
[1:03:21] wound up in their life could not be made
[1:03:23] manifest it could not be displayed in
[1:03:26] the wilderness now let's read here in
[1:03:30] Ephesians 1 verse 3
[1:03:38] I think I'm gonna have to get some
[1:03:39] cheaters here pretty soon you know even
[1:03:44] you start reading a medicine bottle and
[1:03:45] you got to take these things off I got a
[1:03:54] new set waiting on me on the other side
[1:03:56] [Applause]
[1:04:00] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of
[1:04:04] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[1:04:08] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:04:11] heavenly places in Christ brother when
[1:04:17] this is read this is not something
[1:04:19] forthcoming but what is happening now
[1:04:21] it's because it has already been decreed
[1:04:24] and declared it Christ before the
[1:04:27] foundation of the world and once you
[1:04:30] come into this place then the reality of
[1:04:34] where you were and who you are becomes
[1:04:37] real by the manifestation of his life
[1:04:40] and living itself through you spiritual
[1:04:45] blessings amen
[1:04:48] verse 4 according as he hath chosen us
[1:04:51] in him before the foundation of the
[1:04:53] world that we should be holy and without
[1:04:56] blame before him in love he chose us to
[1:05:00] be that way then you know what it's up
[1:05:03] to him to bring us to that reality
[1:05:08] having predestinated us unto the
[1:05:11] adoption that word adoption you hold
[1:05:13] that that's your placement or your
[1:05:15] position adoption of children by Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:05:22] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[1:05:25] the glory of His grace wherein he hath
[1:05:28] made us accepted in the beloved oh no no
[1:05:36] no no no no no no I did get that out of
[1:05:40] your vocabulary he did
[1:05:45] because what is being manifest now in
[1:05:49] your life in my life is what God already
[1:05:52] knew and declared I'm just trying to
[1:06:01] stand still here when those patriarch
[1:06:07] mothers those when they were giving
[1:06:11] birth there to the sons of Jacob to that
[1:06:14] of Israel when those mothers were giving
[1:06:17] birth they called out the name when
[1:06:21] birth was coming and that name within it
[1:06:25] held a place and a position in the land
[1:06:32] though there were generations that came
[1:06:35] and some of them died in the wilderness
[1:06:37] but you cannot stop nor hinder the Word
[1:06:41] of God from coming to pass God knew who
[1:06:44] he had in his mind when he spoke this
[1:06:48] let me tell you something as much as
[1:06:50] Moses stood with the Spirit of Christ in
[1:06:53] him and interceded for Israel when at
[1:06:56] times God said I'll destroy him why
[1:06:57] because sin will bring the wrath of
[1:07:00] Almighty God but there must be one that
[1:07:02] will stand in the breach for you and I
[1:07:04] until that reality in our life becomes
[1:07:08] fully expressed and when that becomes
[1:07:10] expressed in us brother the intercessor
[1:07:13] is not somewhere out there but the
[1:07:15] Spirit of intercessor is within us that
[1:07:18] ties us into the mercy seat into our
[1:07:21] high priest
[1:07:27] god it's so good any well let's keep
[1:07:31] reading and whom we have redemption
[1:07:34] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:07:36] sins according to the riches of His
[1:07:38] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[1:07:41] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[1:07:44] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:07:46] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:07:49] hath purposed in himself how could we
[1:07:53] know it if God didn't show it hmm
[1:07:57] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:08:00] of times he might gather together in one
[1:08:02] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:08:04] heaven and which on earth even in him in
[1:08:07] whom also we have obtained an
[1:08:09] inheritance see Jesus did not give me an
[1:08:13] inheritance
[1:08:16] whoo hello somebody he did not give me
[1:08:19] an inheritance he brought me to it
[1:08:24] you know I'm quoting he did not give me
[1:08:27] an inheritance he brought me to my
[1:08:31] inheritance
[1:08:32] he's like somebody left you something
[1:08:35] there has to be somebody to make you
[1:08:38] aware of what belongs to you
[1:08:41] what somebody left you amen you were
[1:08:45] ordained to receive life glory he
[1:08:51] brought me to it
[1:08:53] that's how bringing us to the adoption
[1:08:57] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:09:01] that ye should be to the praise of his
[1:09:05] glory who first trusted in price in whom
[1:09:08] also trusted after that ye heard the
[1:09:11] word of truth the gospel of your
[1:09:13] salvation in whom also after that you
[1:09:16] believe not when you believed not when
[1:09:20] you believed after you believed amen
[1:09:24] you've got to first believe the Bible
[1:09:27] said man believeth on to salvation and
[1:09:33] we don't wait on them we don't believe
[1:09:34] in that old Baptist doctrine selling
[1:09:37] people short of a real true experience
[1:09:39] with God it's not about what the Bible
[1:09:42] said the Devils believe in tremble right
[1:09:45] it takes God coming and bringing what
[1:09:49] that belief to a little thing holy faith
[1:09:53] in our life but you first have to
[1:09:57] believe and how can you know what to
[1:09:59] believe unless you know and hear what to
[1:10:02] believe right the Bible said in the book
[1:10:05] of Romans chapter 1 I believe it is how
[1:10:07] shall they hear see there gotta be a
[1:10:11] word that goes out that would cause
[1:10:14] somebody to hear and you know what not
[1:10:16] everybody is gonna white
[1:10:20] you know the Bible says blessed are they
[1:10:22] that do hunger and thirst for
[1:10:23] righteousness for you shall be filled
[1:10:25] do you know you're blessed they meant to
[1:10:29] even hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:10:34] but don't just we want more and more but
[1:10:37] don't just stop if you haven't been
[1:10:38] filled just don't stop with the hunger
[1:10:40] and thirst say God satisfy the hunger
[1:10:43] satisfy the first and you know what once
[1:10:46] you give that brother you become
[1:10:48] addicted yes sir you'll become addicted
[1:10:53] to the Holy Ghost you'll become addicted
[1:10:56] to the word you'll become addicted to
[1:10:58] Jesus Christ I gotta add more and more
[1:11:01] and more of him you know what happens
[1:11:04] you're in love and the Bible says love
[1:11:09] is blind god help us to stay in the love
[1:11:12] of God to where we are blind to the
[1:11:14] failures and faults and mistakes of one
[1:11:18] another help us to be so in love with
[1:11:20] Jesus Christ
[1:11:21] we're so blinded by the blood so all we
[1:11:24] can see is there's help for you I'll
[1:11:27] pray for you God is good he is faithful
[1:11:30] his mercy endures forever
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:34] woo that's the kind of love is blind I
[1:11:38] believe in glory be to God oh my in whom
[1:11:47] also after you believed you were sealed
[1:11:49] with that Holy Spirit of promise which
[1:11:53] is the earnest of our inheritance under
[1:11:55] the redemption of the purchased
[1:11:57] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:11:59] and I can't preach all those scriptures
[1:12:02] today but I'm gonna try but I'm not I'm
[1:12:06] not I know better the Bible tells us in
[1:12:09] Galatians 4 when we look in Galatians 4
[1:12:13] here once again Paul is setting it
[1:12:17] clearly in this chapter here in
[1:12:19] Galatians 4 he talks about the error
[1:12:24] when he opens in verse 1 he said now the
[1:12:27] air as long as he's a child differeth
[1:12:31] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:12:35] but is under tutors and governors until
[1:12:39] the time appointed of the Father even so
[1:12:44] we when we were children were in bondage
[1:12:48] under the elements of the world but when
[1:12:52] the fullness of the time was come God
[1:12:54] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[1:12:58] under the law now look at this in verse
[1:13:01] 5 you see Paul Paul is bringing this
[1:13:04] down let me just say it this clearly you
[1:13:09] did not become a son or daughter when
[1:13:12] you were born again you always were you
[1:13:18] did not become a sheep when you were
[1:13:20] born again but I'll tell you this right
[1:13:23] now there will not be any that are not
[1:13:26] born again going in the rapture that
[1:13:29] means every sheep will be there there
[1:13:34] will not be one son or daughter where
[1:13:35] God looks around and says who ain't here
[1:13:38] there's a rope missing no he's got every
[1:13:43] thing accounted for
[1:13:46] he didn't make too little theophanies or
[1:13:49] too many theophanies he already made out
[1:13:56] to Lilith when people go to have a
[1:13:57] wedding
[1:13:58] they don't just you know say hey give me
[1:14:00] 500 invitations and then they just start
[1:14:03] sending them randomly they sit down and
[1:14:05] consider who they're inviting let me
[1:14:10] just be very clear to you you're not
[1:14:11] invited to the wedding
[1:14:13] you are the wedding you're not a guest
[1:14:17] of the wedding but you are called to be
[1:14:20] united with him right here in this life
[1:14:24] in your shoe pile in your tent with
[1:14:26] inside the bride's body we are united
[1:14:30] with Jesus Christ
[1:14:32] right here in our life there is a you
[1:14:35] now
[1:14:36] with Jesus Christ we go to the wedding
[1:14:41] supper revelations 19 you know the
[1:14:44] marriage of the lamb has come so while
[1:14:49] Paul is letting him know that even
[1:14:52] though he's an error
[1:14:55] he's already a son or a daughter but he
[1:14:59] cannot be recognized as a son or
[1:15:02] daughter he's still a servant but it's
[1:15:07] up to God only God can take that of what
[1:15:11] is an heir a son a potential and God
[1:15:15] bring it to a reality you with me only
[1:15:18] God can do that
[1:15:19] only God can bring a transformation
[1:15:21] within a life only God can do that men
[1:15:24] can do that a church can do that it
[1:15:28] takes the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:31] that's why I pray O God even evermore so
[1:15:35] Lord let me just so clearly Lord
[1:15:37] preaching that before the people
[1:15:39] standing with it I believe I have but
[1:15:42] it's just something that grips my heart
[1:15:43] friends I've always tried to point that
[1:15:46] our faith must rest in the Lord Jesus
[1:15:48] Christ it's not a church that saves us
[1:15:52] it's not being acquainted with the
[1:15:54] message that saves us it's to be under
[1:15:57] the blood that's the only place of
[1:16:03] fellowship that's the only place of
[1:16:06] safety that's the only place where sons
[1:16:09] and daughters come into manifestation so
[1:16:14] Paul was letting him know that Wow
[1:16:17] prior to this coming you see notice it
[1:16:21] took listen to me now it took a coming a
[1:16:25] coming that could actually release the
[1:16:29] sons and daughters of God it took a
[1:16:33] coming to release it when they put him
[1:16:36] on the cross and notice here the hand
[1:16:38] amia coming the Lord had to come he had
[1:16:42] to come and pay the price of redemption
[1:16:45] in paradise they were looking for his
[1:16:49] coming are you with me
[1:16:51] how were they looking for it by the
[1:16:53] blood of the Lamb that they had offered
[1:16:56] by revelation they were looking for his
[1:17:00] coming brother when he came there in
[1:17:02] hail
[1:17:04] he came down there he took our sins in
[1:17:07] the lowest parts of hell and how long he
[1:17:10] was in the lowest parts I don't know how
[1:17:12] many hours how many moments I don't know
[1:17:14] but he went there for you and I he had
[1:17:17] to unload the sin debt and we when he
[1:17:24] begin to ascend
[1:17:26] he came and knocked on the door paradise
[1:17:32] different ones that had saw him in their
[1:17:36] day they saw his day in their day base
[1:17:41] caught the visitation in their day
[1:17:44] hallelujah
[1:17:46] here he comes now and he makes himself
[1:17:48] known what happens where they could not
[1:17:51] get out of paradise
[1:17:52] he is coming releases them out of
[1:17:57] paradise and to think of this right now
[1:18:01] now after he's been offered out and the
[1:18:04] sacrifice has been made and now as they
[1:18:07] would have sinned he has sins on high
[1:18:09] what does he do he sends back the Holy
[1:18:12] Ghost not a first person third person he
[1:18:15] said if I go in I will come again I will
[1:18:21] come to you what was in declaring bears
[1:18:26] are coming bears are coming of the Holy
[1:18:28] Ghost there's a coming of the Lord to
[1:18:31] your life there must be a coming of the
[1:18:36] Lord
[1:18:37] and brother in liberate you it delivers
[1:18:40] you from every hole I've since changed
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:48] yeah when he knocked on the door
[1:18:51] Ezekiel said that's the one I saw the
[1:18:54] will in the middle of the wheel sheriff
[1:18:57] says finally honey on it this is the one
[1:19:00] this is the one we gave the fatted calf

[1:19:06] yeah yeah yeah yeah boy you talk about
[1:19:08] an excitement what does all this mean
[1:19:14] but it's the same way when he came
[1:19:16] knocking on your door that's why I've
[1:19:23] been different all my life that's why I
[1:19:27] couldn't fit into churches that's why I
[1:19:30] couldn't fit in the program that's why
[1:19:33] something was different there was a loan
[1:19:35] there was a craving for reality this is
[1:19:38] the one who got a hold on my life when I
[1:19:41] felt the burden lifted this is the one
[1:19:44] who cleaned me up and now he has come to
[1:19:48] fill you up and lift you up in his
[1:19:52] coming whoo Joey what minha fits this is
[1:20:05] the Lord's doing verse 5 here's what he
[1:20:16] came to do to redeem them that were
[1:20:20] under the law that we might receive the
[1:20:26] adoption of sons he came to redeem he
[1:20:32] paid the price of redemption your
[1:20:34] redemption is it's buying back what
[1:20:36] belongs to you he came to buy back what
[1:20:41] belong to him that what we might receive
[1:20:45] the adoption the placement the
[1:20:47] positioning as sons and daughters of God
[1:20:50] how do we receive that positioning when
[1:20:52] we already are sons and daughters of God
[1:20:54] the lie
[1:20:55] Oh God itself moving in your life
[1:20:59] translate you supernatural
[1:21:02] transportation he it translates you from
[1:21:05] the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom
[1:21:08] of his dear son that's why it wasn't you
[1:21:18] that received the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost received you hallelujah glory what
[1:21:29] meaneth this and because you are sons
[1:21:38] already were because you are sons God
[1:21:42] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:21:45] into your hearts crying Abba Father I
[1:21:54] think it'd be good go ahead and pull up
[1:21:56] verse seven sister tabby I think it'd be
[1:21:58] good if we read this one together you
[1:22:02] ready let's go wherefore thou are no
[1:22:07] more a servant but a son and if a son
[1:22:10] then an heir of God through Christ and
[1:22:18] Sammy we just said now in the son you're
[1:22:20] a manifested son now he's manifesting
[1:22:27] one day in your life all the time you
[1:22:33] just had to get in him
[1:22:38] whoo glory is the thick of molasses in
[1:22:44] it better not go to talking about that
[1:22:51] I'm one son but this coming across
[1:22:55] Jordan think about it God didn't bring
[1:22:59] them up to the Jordan when the Jordan
[1:23:02] was at it you know just a little
[1:23:03] standstill God brought him up to the
[1:23:06] Jordan better bill when the banks were
[1:23:08] flooded he brought him in the time of
[1:23:12] April resurrection season he brought him
[1:23:16] here into this time you know God knew
[1:23:18] what he was doing because as soon as
[1:23:20] they got over there on the other side oh
[1:23:22] oh I gotta go ahead and say it soon as
[1:23:25] they got over to the other side they was
[1:23:27] already some old corn that was gonna be
[1:23:29] waiting on him there was gonna be a
[1:23:32] change of diet that would come hello now
[1:23:37] they had been eating the heavenly manna
[1:23:38] that had been fallen but now when they
[1:23:40] got to the other side they were eating
[1:23:43] of what itself had went in the ground
[1:23:45] had been raised up and now had become
[1:23:47] bread and substance for them what was
[1:23:50] that resurrection power eating of the
[1:23:55] old corn of the land the mature things
[1:23:58] of things that belong to sons and
[1:24:00] daughters of God hallelujah
[1:24:04] so coming across that Jordan you can't
[1:24:07] come a car they couldn't come across
[1:24:08] anywhere they couldn't tell Joshua
[1:24:10] Joshua you know what we're not this
[1:24:13] right here it this ain't fitting it's a
[1:24:16] mess we're gonna go on downstream but
[1:24:20] we'll meet you over there we're going to
[1:24:21] go on downstream we want to go to where
[1:24:23] you know it's not this is too deep this
[1:24:27] place is too deep well how do you expect
[1:24:32] your sins to get buried
[1:24:37] now let me just also put this in here
[1:24:40] wouldn't matter if it's a millimeter I
[1:24:41] hope I got the right measurement of the
[1:24:43] blood of Jesus Christ it's enough to
[1:24:45] take care of every demon out of hell
[1:24:48] it's a right yes or not but you see God
[1:24:51] was letting it be no there's only one
[1:24:54] way into the Promised Land
[1:24:56] you gotta come in by the name of the
[1:24:59] Lord Jesus Christ there is no other
[1:25:02] passage there is no other name whereby
[1:25:06] men might be safe there's only one way
[1:25:09] across amen
[1:25:12] one way repent be baptized in the name
[1:25:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:25:19] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what
[1:25:22] is the Holy Ghost it is the name of
[1:25:25] Almighty God being placed upon you as
[1:25:29] sons and daughters of God where he
[1:25:33] recognizes you this is my son this is my
[1:25:37] daughter you might say I'm a housewife
[1:25:40] you got Authority you got Authority once
[1:25:45] Satan 101 or 1 arise his tongue you got
[1:25:47] Authority sister he hath made us kings
[1:25:50] and priests unto our God amen we are
[1:25:53] royal priesthood sickness rises in the
[1:25:57] home you got a right to stand right
[1:25:59] there with the authority of the Holy
[1:26:01] Ghost he's backing you up you might say
[1:26:04] I don't feel nothing it ain't about what
[1:26:06] you feel you're standing there as a son
[1:26:09] or daughter of God upon the promise of
[1:26:11] God and you call what belongs to you ask
[1:26:16] the Father anything in my name and I'll
[1:26:20] do it
[1:26:24] that's why Jesus said I don't have time
[1:26:27] to read these scriptures here but he
[1:26:29] said it you can have it so you can look
[1:26:31] at it later John 14:26 and he ascends
[1:26:34] the comforter in it the father will send
[1:26:37] it in my name yes sir
[1:26:41] it's got to be recognized it's a living
[1:26:44] God that came down he came down and
[1:26:47] become one of us
[1:26:49] that he might impart his life to you and
[1:26:51] I home aha
[1:26:55] we were ordained ordained to receive
[1:26:59] life and it takes a sovereign act of the
[1:27:03] transforming power of God to place us
[1:27:06] into the body of Jesus Christ the word
[1:27:12] we understand we need to have a home
[1:27:16] church but it was not to where you were
[1:27:18] placed in a home church come on now you
[1:27:23] know that's something that has to be and
[1:27:25] I'm gonna preach on that this morning
[1:27:26] but that son that has to be revealed to
[1:27:28] you personally brother Graham said I'm
[1:27:30] Church using a church home you don't
[1:27:32] choose it based on programs but he said
[1:27:34] there's two qualities you choose it on
[1:27:36] you choose it on the word and the
[1:27:38] working of the Holy Ghost those are the
[1:27:40] two things that you choose a church on I
[1:27:44] don't like how they do this and I don't
[1:27:46] like how to do this when it comes down
[1:27:48] to the word and the spirit that's where
[1:27:51] we make our decision and as I told you I
[1:27:57] think on Sunday you know I don't care
[1:27:59] and I hope you don't care either I don't
[1:28:01] care what people would thinking that
[1:28:03] people think anything you know what
[1:28:05] y'all don't act like me and I don't act
[1:28:06] like you I want you to I want you to be
[1:28:09] free and the Holy Ghost
[1:28:12] you know I preach the people that may
[1:28:14] not they may not shout but they'll sit
[1:28:16] there and cry and they got a big old
[1:28:18] smile on their face home I mean it's
[1:28:20] like they got a big old pot of honey
[1:28:22] sitting on their lap brother they're
[1:28:24] enjoying let me tell you something that
[1:28:25] pulling on the gift of God as much as
[1:28:28] the other person that gets real
[1:28:29] excitable in that way you say what do
[1:28:32] you say we want to be under the
[1:28:34] influence and the effects of the Holy
[1:28:36] Ghost amen we want to worship the Lord
[1:28:40] in spirit and in truth and remember now
[1:28:43] like brother Jack Duff said when he was
[1:28:44] here he said if you haven't been tagged
[1:28:46] with the label heresy then you haven't
[1:28:49] even began to worship yet whoo
[1:28:56] but you know what I really don't care I
[1:28:59] don't I don't pay no attention to it why
[1:29:02] I'm enjoying him I don't get happy just
[1:29:06] when I come to church that's my family
[1:29:14] he's my life just want to be the God
[1:29:19] blessed be the name of the Lord this is
[1:29:22] why the Bible says like I gonna read
[1:29:24] this in 1st Corinthians 12:4 as the body
[1:29:26] is one and hath many members and all the
[1:29:28] members of that one body being many are
[1:29:30] one body so also is Christ I'm talking
[1:29:34] about the promised land now everybody
[1:29:36] with me I'm talking about the promised
[1:29:38] land now for by one spirit are we all
[1:29:42] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:29:45] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[1:29:48] free and have been all made to drink
[1:29:50] into one spirit amen the Holy Ghost is
[1:29:54] our Joshua amen he's the one who takes
[1:29:58] us across in the land
[1:30:02] hallelujah listen half I'm Joshua the
[1:30:06] Holy Ghost I'm talking about the
[1:30:07] fullness as he comes remember it had to
[1:30:10] be alerted in this hour and God had a
[1:30:12] messenger on the scene that just as much
[1:30:15] as Daniel in Daniel 9 I could look and
[1:30:17] understand by the books that it was time
[1:30:19] for deliverance to come brother band
[1:30:21] would stand there and Daniel seventy
[1:30:23] weeks he said I also understand that
[1:30:25] there is to be a Joshua here there is to
[1:30:29] also be a crossing into the promised
[1:30:31] land to all the promises of God brother
[1:30:34] let me tell you something we have
[1:30:36] crossed into the promises of Almighty
[1:30:39] God and brother the final capping of
[1:30:42] every promise is where he himself the
[1:30:45] capstone comes and lifts his bride
[1:30:48] enrapturing grace I understand but the
[1:30:56] books were were out it had to be this
[1:30:59] time for that position and that placing
[1:31:02] a manifestation of the sons of God you
[1:31:05] know what that is that's Brad ty
[1:31:07] it's a Talam when she has a mature woman
[1:31:11] let us be glad and rejoice for the
[1:31:14] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:31:15] wife she hath made herself ready that
[1:31:21] Saint Jesus now living in our flesh
[1:31:34] beautiful scripture in Genesis 48 6
[1:31:37] where Jacob is dedicating Joseph's boys
[1:31:45] and when he's dedicating boy you could
[1:31:49] preach this at a family altar Jacob took
[1:31:53] him and he said the angel of the Lord
[1:31:57] who redeemed me from all evil
[1:32:00] bless the lads the age of the Lord
[1:32:06] brother Jacob didn't have a meeting with
[1:32:09] the secretary he had a personal meeting
[1:32:15] with the angel of the Lord Jacob now
[1:32:20] notice I want you to think of this now
[1:32:23] Jacob got tired of being Jacob did you
[1:32:29] hear me he got tired of being Jacob he
[1:32:32] grew weary of his life he already had a
[1:32:35] blessing pronounced tougher and that's
[1:32:36] remember he ran he he ran off into the
[1:32:38] land he went just seen Laban and that's
[1:32:40] where he was instructed to go the
[1:32:42] blessing had already been prayed over
[1:32:43] his life he had been he had been told
[1:32:46] right the truth the truth had been laid
[1:32:49] out for him
[1:32:49] come on now come on mom and Daddy it had
[1:32:52] already been laid out the truth are you
[1:32:56] with me now now what's this but he had
[1:32:58] to get desperate for the life-giving
[1:33:01] flow to bring the effect into the
[1:33:05] Covenant when he got desperate the Lord
[1:33:09] began to draw him to the place where he
[1:33:12] first met the Lord
[1:33:17] when he came to Bethel he just thought
[1:33:20] he was in a place you know I mean I
[1:33:21] gotta rest here you see what Jacob
[1:33:25] thought I just gotta rest I'm tired God
[1:33:28] had him to come to Bethel it was not by
[1:33:33] chance that he went to that youth
[1:33:34] meeting I mean it wasn't by chance that
[1:33:36] he went to that serve I mean it wasn't
[1:33:38] by chance God has a place that he can
[1:33:46] make himself known to his children that
[1:33:49] I am the living cause this ain't a pipe
[1:33:51] dream I am still the same God I'm still
[1:33:56] the same yesterday today and forever I
[1:33:59] am as he told Jacob the God of Abraham
[1:34:02] by father
[1:34:06] not by grandfather he don't have
[1:34:08] grandchildren I'm the God of Abraham thy
[1:34:12] father
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:15] that's what even told Isaac and on and
[1:34:17] on and on and on wrong but you see he
[1:34:22] brings him back to Bethel water
[1:34:24] spiritual significance happens to Bethel
[1:34:27] this is a type 144,000 coming back here
[1:34:30] - but we won't breech that now Omaha
[1:34:35] just old
[1:34:36] lord have mercy y'all love me you love
[1:34:41] him that's first now you love me you're
[1:34:44] alright but the Lord Himself
[1:34:52] manifested himself to Jacob that I am
[1:34:57] the entrance to this house the house of
[1:35:03] God he were declaring a dwelling place
[1:35:08] called laying it down there in Bethel
[1:35:12] that would become known as Bethlehem the
[1:35:15] branch center the place where that of of
[1:35:19] God's own read the house of God's own
[1:35:22] bread remember it was now God would
[1:35:24] bring Jacob back to this place where God
[1:35:28] had made himself known to it you see God
[1:35:31] don't take him somewhere else
[1:35:32] Oh Lord he brings him back to the place
[1:35:38] where he had made himself known to him
[1:35:41] but remember Jacob had made a promise
[1:35:44] here he said you bring me back here and
[1:35:49] I will give the tithe of all my
[1:35:53] substance you know the time that God was
[1:35:57] wanting it wasn't just the honor of what
[1:36:00] Jacob would take a tenth of that of his
[1:36:02] earthly possessions and give there unto
[1:36:05] the Lord
[1:36:05] but you realize friends that when God
[1:36:07] would require of us to be taught fairs
[1:36:10] to show that of the honor do you realize
[1:36:12] that God Himself is a tax payer he takes
[1:36:17] a tithes of all the earth he gives of
[1:36:22] the riches of himself what was he asking
[1:36:25] for he was asking for the depths of
[1:36:28] Jacob he was asking for that which he
[1:36:33] knew lay there Israel and the Bible says
[1:36:39] was he wrestled with the angel of the
[1:36:40] Lord the Bible says he blessed him
[1:36:45] they're not just Bethel even though
[1:36:50] that's attacked but he blessed him
[1:36:52] they're the Holy Ghost finds its mark in
[1:36:57] the heart of the believer
[1:36:59] it takes that character that life that
[1:37:03] see that has been laying there dorm
[1:37:06] beneath all the evil or you with me
[1:37:08] beneath all the evil and he descends
[1:37:12] down beneath all the evil and the age of
[1:37:16] the Lord redeems that from all evil
[1:37:21] breaking every hold upon the life and as
[1:37:27] we said those patriarchs were born from
[1:37:30] Jacob they were to be divinely placed in
[1:37:34] the land you see like the prodigal when
[1:37:38] we were reading moments ago he was dead
[1:37:41] and sent in trespasses
[1:37:54] program tells us that the mama and the
[1:37:57] daddy were praying in their house day
[1:38:01] after day
[1:38:09] you read on down there and psalms 118
[1:38:12] when you get home the Bible says I
[1:38:13] called him to him in my distress and he
[1:38:16] heard me but been said that mama and
[1:38:24] that daddy were praying there for that
[1:38:26] young man brother BAM said hear he said
[1:38:32] when he got to that place you know the
[1:38:33] Bible he got to a place he was he said
[1:38:36] if they too gave him husks what the pigs
[1:38:40] was he they too gave him some of that he
[1:38:42] to ate it he was that much in need do
[1:38:48] you know what before he got to that
[1:38:50] point he would never have been desperate
[1:38:53] enough
[1:38:56] he was the son and God let him keep
[1:39:00] going until what until finally he got to
[1:39:04] thinking about home home never changed
[1:39:11] are you hearing me Paul never changed
[1:39:15] who was changing he was home wasn't
[1:39:21] changing he was you might look at him
[1:39:27] might seem like you might stand right in
[1:39:29] your face and seemed like if the prayers
[1:39:31] are not being answered but let me tell
[1:39:33] you something the angel of the Lord was
[1:39:36] working there but I'm said the angel of
[1:39:38] the Lord came down in that Pigpen he met
[1:39:45] him there and he said the angel the Lord
[1:39:48] began to deal with this heart about
[1:39:50] going back home
[1:39:54] who is it that is Tron you and I the
[1:39:57] angel of the Lord who is it that is
[1:39:59] brought Israel back into our homeland
[1:40:01] the angel of the Lord prayers that were
[1:40:08] being offered up you might say this is
[1:40:13] an awful long fishing line but don't
[1:40:15] worry there's a hook on the other end
[1:40:22] well this and this and this you stand
[1:40:25] there on God's promise that in thy house
[1:40:31] shall be saved I wish I could preach
[1:40:34] that one this morning to that in the
[1:40:37] house shall be saved that same faith
[1:40:41] that you have and you have in your life
[1:40:44] of what God has done you take that same
[1:40:46] faith and you apply it when you pray for
[1:40:49] that wayward son or daughter of God
[1:40:52] brother the Holy Ghost is still in
[1:40:54] action to bring conviction to hearts and
[1:40:57] lives and bring them back home they
[1:41:05] might say I don't want to go to church
[1:41:07] you keep praying because maybe that's
[1:41:13] see that's all they've ever seen
[1:41:15] he's just Church now don't take that
[1:41:19] wrong I'm not putting anybody down I'm
[1:41:20] saying that when you come and sit here
[1:41:25] it's a mystery until you get lit up you
[1:41:32] think it's something that well the
[1:41:33] preachers making them do it well I'm
[1:41:35] gonna do this reverse I don't want you
[1:41:37] to do it for me you got to do it because
[1:41:38] you love the Lord I don't talk the way I
[1:41:43] talk dressed the way I dress
[1:41:45] after way I act because I'm afraid of
[1:41:47] somebody I do that because the love of
[1:41:50] God is shed abroad in my heart
[1:41:54] even when I don't feel like praying the
[1:41:57] love of God
[1:41:58] that shit'll brought in my heart but
[1:42:00] said boy you need contact with your
[1:42:02] Heavenly Father today but I don't feel
[1:42:04] like listening or reading but there's
[1:42:06] something on the inside that moves
[1:42:09] beyond this needs your daily bread he
[1:42:24] became miserable sometimes when they
[1:42:28] become miserable if they're close to you
[1:42:31] you might get a little miserable but
[1:42:36] they got to get miserable got to get
[1:42:40] tired of being who they are you accept
[1:42:48] the forgiveness of the Lord just bear
[1:42:49] with me a moment that's wonderful but
[1:42:54] you must you must be accepted and
[1:42:58] received in him by the baptism of the
[1:43:02] Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus himself was
[1:43:06] the word when he was born but the word
[1:43:11] had to be made flesh
[1:43:17] now you know how could we could I could
[1:43:20] run through a litany of quotes brother
[1:43:22] Bram said he walked into the water as a
[1:43:24] man but he came up as but God man said
[1:43:31] he walked in the water as a man but he
[1:43:34] came up Immanuel see as a
[1:43:38] twelve-year-old boy
[1:43:40] the word was laying in his life brother
[1:43:42] Ben tells us in Dallas Texas paradox
[1:43:44] 1964 when he as a bully he reasoned with
[1:43:47] the scribes in the temple he reasoned
[1:43:50] with them on the Scriptures they were
[1:43:54] astounded at his wisdom and brother Bram
[1:43:57] goes on to say the father didn't even do
[1:43:59] well in him at the time more than just a
[1:44:04] knowledge of the word you see the words
[1:44:07] got to be made flesh another man tells
[1:44:11] us I believe it's looking away to Jesus
[1:44:13] he said when he came to found of the
[1:44:15] water there the heavens were opened
[1:44:18] why were the heavens open because he
[1:44:21] walked in obedience to the Spirit in the
[1:44:24] message Easter seal brother Ram said the
[1:44:26] Holy Ghost sought him out in perfect
[1:44:29] obedience and he comes to the water to
[1:44:32] be washed there by the water to be
[1:44:36] washed by the Prophet he's getting ready
[1:44:38] to enter into this priestly journey come
[1:44:43] on somebody he's gonna enter into this
[1:44:45] now then the Holy Ghost is sending in
[1:44:48] the form of a death what's he doing he's
[1:44:50] coming to fill his temple come on now
[1:44:55] and through this through this through
[1:44:57] this Union now he'll come through this
[1:45:02] and there will then come forth an
[1:45:04] imparting of life to other sons and
[1:45:07] daughters of God the word had to be made
[1:45:12] flesh
[1:45:13] it had to be quickened that's the words
[1:45:16] that the Prophet used he said when he
[1:45:17] came up out of the water then then was
[1:45:20] the word made flesh
[1:45:25] you see the Holy Spirit in you he lives
[1:45:28] and it'll manifest a word life that's
[1:45:31] expressed I'm not talking about all you
[1:45:33] know you understand I'm not talking
[1:45:36] about all you know
[1:45:44] my
[1:45:49] we may just have to wind this down
[1:45:53] when God moves there in your life like
[1:45:56] that the Holy Spirit coming in in your
[1:45:59] life you then the scriptures that begins
[1:46:04] to move within our lives the works that
[1:46:07] I do shall you do also
[1:46:09] it was the works that were done that
[1:46:12] were interpreted by the word this is
[1:46:17] where brother man would would be very
[1:46:18] clear with us he said sometimes he said
[1:46:21] we people can't wait from one revival to
[1:46:23] the next and everything back and forth
[1:46:25] he said but we come here we come to
[1:46:27] confess and get into that blood of Jesus
[1:46:30] that cleanse us from all sin we should
[1:46:32] focus our self down to see that one true
[1:46:35] Living God standing here who made the
[1:46:38] promise the heavens and earth will pass
[1:46:40] away but his word cannot fail
[1:46:43] stay right there upon that then you're
[1:46:46] not tossed about with winds of doctrine
[1:46:48] carried it back from place to place from
[1:46:50] pillar to post you know where you stand
[1:46:52] because you've been zeroed in with God
[1:46:55] and you see your own life hitting the
[1:46:57] target just like the Apostles did you
[1:47:00] live the way they did you were baptized
[1:47:03] the way they were you see the same
[1:47:05] results that they see you see it
[1:47:07] operating in you
[1:47:21] hallelujah
[1:47:27] when the Lord Jesus came let me just let
[1:47:29] me just skip here just a little bit they
[1:47:34] just move on here when he raised here
[1:47:40] on that Easter morning
[1:47:44] he brought them together
[1:47:47] they were all scattered
[1:47:50] they didn't know what had taken place
[1:47:53] but he went and he gathered them himself
[1:47:58] he began to make known to them the
[1:48:01] promises that pertained to them he's
[1:48:07] building their faith in the word letting
[1:48:10] them see everything that was wrote of
[1:48:12] all these things that he should suffer
[1:48:14] as I suffered he's building their faith
[1:48:17] in the world he's got to give direction
[1:48:19] for their life he's not going to leave
[1:48:23] him back there in Luke 24
[1:48:26] you see they cannot just look at the
[1:48:29] coming that has come there in the flesh
[1:48:32] but they have to now be brought and made
[1:48:36] ready for the coming in their flesh and
[1:48:41] now once he's gathered him by the
[1:48:43] promise then he can begin to make known
[1:48:46] to them there is a promise growing wait
[1:48:50] in Jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:48:55] power from on high
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:00] he's letting him know this is the
[1:49:02] promise here of what is written there in
[1:49:05] the word it was time for the sons of God
[1:49:08] to be born it was time they'll know who
[1:49:12] can bring a son of God to birth it has
[1:49:15] to be the same God Jehovah back there in
[1:49:19] the beginning a man he gave back to his
[1:49:23] sons back there come on now you see it
[1:49:25] takes two to make a birth it takes that
[1:49:28] of the written word confirmed by the
[1:49:31] Spirit of God we must be born of the
[1:49:33] water and of the spirit they men your
[1:49:38] birth the real new birth positions you
[1:49:41] in the body of Jesus Christ it places
[1:49:45] you in the Word of God amen you're not
[1:49:49] just looking over into the promises
[1:49:51] brother you're in the promises crew

[1:50:54] the same God who met you for Jericho is
[1:50:57] the same God that will meet you for AI

[1:51:02] bear or galati's the same God and this
[1:51:08] is your land glory be to God if the Lord
[1:51:17] interpreted in you in a living form here
[1:51:22] you are in your life you know you may
[1:51:25] not be able to quote scripture and verse
[1:51:27] and whatever more that don't matter that
[1:51:29] don't matter but what's most important
[1:51:31] is is you've got the author of the word
[1:51:34] inside of you
[1:51:36] you know how powerful that is everybody
[1:51:39] else can be look around I got the Bible
[1:51:42] you say I got the author I got the
[1:51:46] author of the book living in me and the
[1:51:50] author of the book the Spirit of Truth
[1:51:52] leads and guides us into all truth so I
[1:52:00] don't have to just go to you know some
[1:52:02] borders books can I have a book signing
[1:52:04] can I have your autograph his name has
[1:52:07] been wrote on my heart the Holy Ghost
[1:52:11] the author himself of the word has come
[1:52:13] it's personal every day are you with me
[1:52:18] oh my think of this now
[1:52:24] he was pouring out he poured out his
[1:52:26] life when they came out of the upper
[1:52:28] room
[1:52:31] here they came out of there
[1:52:33] they came staggering out and there were
[1:52:38] people said in acts 212
[1:52:40] they were looking at somewhere in doubt
[1:52:48] only third hour of the day I mean we use
[1:52:50] only get drunk like that around here
[1:52:55] draw our thee to God I want to ask you
[1:52:59] to raise your hand how many been drunk
[1:53:00] on the Holy Ghost before that's the kind
[1:53:05] of drunks I believe in Oh Samuel that a
[1:53:09] scripture it is in acts 2 and if you
[1:53:11] read your Bible in the beginning of the
[1:53:13] book of Esther when winning King Ahaz
[1:53:15] was called a feast the Bible said there
[1:53:18] was an abundance of wine there hmm don't
[1:53:23] tell me that glory be to God but you see
[1:53:27] this is a toxication even after you
[1:53:29] recover and can walk a straight line
[1:53:30] brother you might be able to walk in a
[1:53:33] straight line here but you see what you
[1:53:34] got the plumb line on the inside then
[1:53:36] you're already walking a straight line
[1:53:38] you've been inoculated intoxicated
[1:53:41] whether you're on a drunk until you
[1:53:43] leave this world that's a power of the
[1:53:47] Holy Ghost
[1:53:55] it gives you power even when you feel
[1:53:58] when you get the feeling gloomy you ask
[1:54:01] yourself how can I feel gloomy how can I
[1:54:04] feel down down and you might walk you're
[1:54:07] feeling down you feeling gloomy but
[1:54:08] there's something that rests within the
[1:54:10] bosom of your soul that's you know you
[1:54:16] with me and you've been you begin to
[1:54:18] revisit those grounds come on somebody
[1:54:20] revisit those grounds oh mile could
[1:54:25] preach here when when Jacob remember
[1:54:27] when Jacob left Bethel after his
[1:54:29] experience with God I'm talking about
[1:54:31] the second experience where he got lit
[1:54:33] up when Jacob left remember he went from
[1:54:36] Bethel and that's where he got in
[1:54:37] trouble
[1:54:38] hello now his daughter Deena and
[1:54:40] whatever more he got trouble and God
[1:54:42] never told him to leave Bethel and at
[1:54:46] the end of that chapter God said get
[1:54:48] back to Bethel get back to Bethel let me
[1:54:52] tell you something that's why brother
[1:54:53] Ram said you must always stay where the
[1:54:56] kingdom of God is when you're being fed
[1:54:59] spiritually day and night i buyed there
[1:55:04] in his presence a man or woman comes out
[1:55:10] of there and you know what they asked
[1:55:12] they said what meaneth yes that was the
[1:55:16] question
[1:55:17] what meaneth this
[1:55:20] Peter standing up they appended costs
[1:55:26] these are not drunk as usable better
[1:55:34] there was no shame in him there was no
[1:55:39] shame in him when they noticed before
[1:55:44] they had become one he had denied the
[1:55:47] Lord Jesus Christ but rather he came out
[1:55:50] on the day of Pentecost he had been
[1:55:52] United with the Lord Jesus Christ true
[1:55:56] oneness at table he won the shame he
[1:55:59] stood up and declared he testified what
[1:56:03] had happened in his life they said what
[1:56:05] mean offense he said this spiritual
[1:56:08] happening is interpreted by the
[1:56:10] scriptures in the book of Joel you know
[1:56:14] what he was declaring what was written
[1:56:17] is now living what mean the fist this is
[1:56:24] the Lord's doing God had come and capped
[1:56:31] off their life all the rest of the
[1:56:36] member when the Lord Jesus come you
[1:56:38] remember how it is when you read brother
[1:56:40] Doug you remember how it is when you
[1:56:41] read luck in this and Luke 15 in other
[1:56:43] places the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:56:47] they always had problems with the crowds
[1:56:52] that came to Jesus
[1:56:57] he's a friend of sinners and publicans
[1:57:02] but let me ask you why were they coming
[1:57:04] to him Linda just asked us Pharisees and
[1:57:09] Sadducees why aren't they coming to you
[1:57:13] you create an atmosphere about your life
[1:57:17] if you got an atmosphere we've received
[1:57:20] the message of yeah and everybody ought
[1:57:23] to be like us I don't want to be like
[1:57:25] you I don't want that kind of a spirit
[1:57:27] around me hey man I want the Holy Ghost
[1:57:30] amen I want the love of God that can
[1:57:34] look at a situation and I don't care
[1:57:36] they may have they may have tattoos
[1:57:38] everywhere they may have rings all the
[1:57:40] way up and down their nose that means
[1:57:42] nothing they meant God can move right
[1:57:46] down in that life and break that hold he
[1:57:52] triumphs over every principality he
[1:57:55] triumphed over every demon out of hell
[1:57:57] that was nothing could hold him
[1:58:01] [Applause]
[1:58:04] sometimes we get so religious and
[1:58:06] sanctimonious well I wouldn't have
[1:58:12] nobody in my church that would like this
[1:58:14] or like that well this ain't your church
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:20] and this name brother Sanders Church
[1:58:24] this is Jesus Church and after all I
[1:58:30] can't help it
[1:58:31] I was just pointed to be an innkeeper
[1:58:35] all I know is there's others that have
[1:58:38] the same love of God in their heart and
[1:58:39] they walk up and down the roadways they
[1:58:42] go places and where the religious would
[1:58:44] look down and say who could do anything
[1:58:46] with that they say here we got a power
[1:58:49] oh lord have mercy we got to preach on
[1:58:54] this one they say we got a power you see
[1:58:56] the man who came he had a power he was
[1:58:59] riding on the priest wasn't riding on a
[1:59:02] power but here that man had a power that
[1:59:07] Samaritan had a power and he himself was
[1:59:10] able to take the man he knew how to
[1:59:12] minister and put him up here and he knew
[1:59:14] where to take him better let me tell you
[1:59:20] something I'm only the assistant brother
[1:59:25] Carlos I'm just the guy standing here
[1:59:27] and the chief physician says scalpel Oh

[1:59:48] eeeh that water it's changing lives
[1:59:51] it's healing wounds it's mending
[1:59:54] divisions it's the important chord in
[2:00:03] the wounds being dressed by the Saints
[2:00:06] of fine power the sterilization of the
[2:00:11] blood of the Lamb he's able to dress
[2:00:14] those wounds

[2:00:45] I'm dragging my breath
[2:00:59] Pharisees how in the world is he
[2:01:02] associated with sinners and publicans I
[2:01:06] believe sometimes that people don't even
[2:01:08] read the message they read let alone the
[2:01:12] Bible you know a lot of people don't you
[2:01:14] read the Bible no more all they do is
[2:01:17] quote Coco Coco Coco now I'm gonna be
[2:01:20] honest me the first question I've got is
[2:01:21] what about Jesus I've been saying that
[2:01:25] what about Jesus what about him in all
[2:01:27] this thank God for the messenger thank
[2:01:30] God for the message but let's remember
[2:01:31] who he came from let's remember he's the
[2:01:37] one that that Eleazar came to introduce
[2:01:39] us to and if we're actually feeding from
[2:01:43] feeding on the word how did you hear me
[2:01:45] feeding on the word not just listening
[2:01:47] to the word when they got close to that
[2:01:49] time when Isaac was descending in by the
[2:01:51] will of him that liveth and see it
[2:01:53] forever remember here it was Rebekah
[2:01:55] that she asked Eleazar who's this man
[2:02:01] how many men you think she saw a lot of
[2:02:04] men there was something different about
[2:02:08] this man she had been feeding on the
[2:02:11] message feeding in the word and she was
[2:02:15] united with the character of the where
[2:02:18] she could hear his voice she could
[2:02:21] recognize him she knows he didn't die in
[2:02:26] 1965 she hears his voice hey bossy the
[2:02:38] runway
[2:02:40] I hope I don't got no mechanical
[2:02:46] failures like him new Boeing's do we'll
[2:02:51] hand hit in their high place the Lord
[2:02:54] Jesus here he came he let him know this
[2:02:57] is mercy its mercy its mercy and he told
[2:03:02] them like this he said how he said
[2:03:06] you've missed the mercy of God you've
[2:03:09] missed it how many times he tell him
[2:03:11] that you've missed the mercy of God and
[2:03:13] he told him he said how can anybody put
[2:03:15] a new piece in an old garment then he
[2:03:20] went in and made the statement how can
[2:03:22] you put new wine in old bottles you've
[2:03:25] got to get new bottles new bottles and
[2:03:28] you know what them bottles are made out
[2:03:30] of animal skins I'm looking at animal
[2:03:34] skins come on somebody I'm looking at
[2:03:40] what was once living badgers dead
[2:03:43] badgers but behind the badger skin it's
[2:03:47] veiling the glory of God and when people
[2:03:51] look at you they don't understand what's
[2:03:53] happening what meaneth this this is the
[2:03:56] Lord's doing this is the Lord's doing
[2:04:02] the glory of God is manifest upon your
[2:04:07] life in your life through your eyes and
[2:04:13] God comes on the inside he takes that
[2:04:16] old bottle and he transforms it to a new
[2:04:21] bottle you know why it's got to be a new
[2:04:24] bottle cuz this wines got power in it
[2:04:29] it needs room for expansion it just gets
[2:04:34] to bubble in there all of a sudden there
[2:04:36] might be a day and all of a sudden it'll
[2:04:39] grow okay and then here comes another
[2:04:42] day and it's just fermenting brother he
[2:04:44] don't get weaker
[2:04:45] let's get stronger and here it goes on
[2:04:50] all the sudden what's happening it's
[2:04:53] life there's life in here and the new
[2:04:59] bottle only expresses the life that has
[2:05:03] come into it
[2:05:05] God didn't change coats he just changed
[2:05:10] the man you wear the same old coat but
[2:05:14] you're a new man on the inside
[2:05:16] amen what are you a son and daughter of
[2:05:19] God made manifest by the power of
[2:05:21] Almighty God we ain't got to stop if I
[2:05:31] don't put this up we've got to stop here
[2:05:33] I keep getting little nuggets keep
[2:05:35] flying off of there
[2:05:40] what means this
[2:05:46] the elder son asked the question he
[2:05:49] pulled his servant to the side what is
[2:05:52] all this music and dancing I'm not gonna
[2:05:55] get that today what is all this
[2:05:59] you know you want to turn around to them
[2:06:01] and say hey older brother ya sing this
[2:06:04] song with me if you're happy and you
[2:06:07] know
[2:06:11] the elder son was all was saying a tizzy
[2:06:15] he was all upset what in the world is
[2:06:19] all this music in this dance add those
[2:06:23] two words music and I'll just leave this
[2:06:27] with you it is the word that we use for
[2:06:31] symphony what is this
[2:06:35] Symphony that I hear
[2:06:41] dancing means there's some action and
[2:06:44] movement going on that matches the music
[2:06:49] what is all of this you know the
[2:06:56] elder son I've been here the whole time
[2:07:00] I've done this I've done that I've done
[2:07:05] this and you never one time never one
[2:07:11] time ever killed the fatted calf for me
[2:07:15] you know what his problem was self
[2:07:22] his whole service was about himself he
[2:07:29] was living in the presence of divine
[2:07:34] grace but he chose to work and work and
[2:07:40] work
[2:07:43] instead of receiving the grace of God
[2:07:46] that was staring him in the face the
[2:07:51] father turned to him and said son
[2:07:57] you're here always with me you're always
[2:08:00] with me
[2:08:02] but this
[2:08:04] by brother
[2:08:07] he was lost he's now found it was dead
[2:08:14] but he's alive again and I want you to
[2:08:19] notice the elder brother he never calls
[2:08:22] the younger brother the prodigal his
[2:08:25] brother but he says this your son
[2:08:32] he did not want to identify with the
[2:08:35] prodigal son at all
[2:08:41] the brand says like the modern church
[2:08:43] they don't want them then screaming
[2:08:45] hollering acts 2:38 holy ghosts tongue
[2:08:49] talking youngins around him they don't
[2:08:53] want the Word made flesh at all let me
[2:08:57] tell you we can have all of that that
[2:08:59] was just even expressed right there what
[2:09:02] brother I'm talking about you can have
[2:09:03] all of that but it ought to put you in
[2:09:05] the word but let me say this very
[2:09:06] clearly if it has put you in the word
[2:09:08] then you are subject to every and any of
[2:09:11] the nine spiritual gifts and you will be
[2:09:15] in subjection to every one of God's
[2:09:17] ministerial gifts hello
[2:09:20] under the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:23] so you cannot be in the word and not
[2:09:26] believe in him but when he puts you
[2:09:32] there brother
[2:09:33] you're in the land you're in the
[2:09:36] homeland you can look around all that
[2:09:40] belongs to you it all along I'll tell
[2:09:46] you this morning if you've not been
[2:09:48] there why don't you heat and just yield
[2:09:50] to the Lord
[2:09:51] don't try to live this life on your own
[2:09:54] let him cut everything away from you let
[2:09:58] him bring deliverance to your life and
[2:10:00] lift you into that place now don't don't
[2:10:04] get me wrong now when you're in when
[2:10:06] you've come into the land it don't mean
[2:10:09] you know I brother Brandon goes into it
[2:10:11] then the quote right there it don't mean
[2:10:13] you won't make mistakes but brother and
[2:10:15] sister mistakes are not willful sin
[2:10:18] you understand what I'm saying there's
[2:10:20] times where you have to understand the
[2:10:22] discernment between deliverance when God
[2:10:27] puts you into the land you're free he
[2:10:30] brings a circumcision in your life and
[2:10:32] you know what so you can walk in liberty
[2:10:35] walk as a son and daughter of God are
[2:10:39] you with me seem like we just took a
[2:10:42] little dip there for a moment
[2:10:48] you know listen you know in your heart
[2:10:52] when you've passed from death unto life
[2:10:55] you know
[2:10:57] nobody can take that from you
[2:11:00] because that's not a work of man that's
[2:11:04] a work of the Living God
[2:11:10] these are our promises these are our
[2:11:13] promises they meant to live in this land
[2:11:17] let's let stand stand
[2:12:01] Jesus
[2:12:04] he's every hit is bound
[2:12:09] I wonder if there be any with uplift at
[2:12:11] hand maybe
[2:12:14] in your heart
[2:12:16] since it through the word
[2:12:19] and as the Holy Spirit would speak out
[2:12:24] so what I come
[2:12:29] god bless you
[2:12:42] Lord Jesus
[2:12:46] father
[2:12:49] we are lured satisfied
[2:12:54] what your our strength your our life
[2:12:58] Lord
[2:13:00] truly Lord when we have been brought
[2:13:03] Lord into the land Lord
[2:13:10] Lord brought in by you Oh God
[2:13:16] it's a paradox Lord it's a miracle
[2:13:19] that's what it is Lord God with human
[2:13:24] tongue Lord it cannot be explained but
[2:13:29] Lord out of that spiritual happening
[2:13:32] it's interpreted by the word
[2:13:38] Lord when you were here walking upon
[2:13:40] this earth in the days of your flesh you
[2:13:43] spoke to them in that hour and you said
[2:13:46] if you cannot believe me they leave me
[2:13:51] for the very works sake for the works
[2:13:55] themselves testify of Who I am or Jesus
[2:14:04] it was a life
[2:14:07] the life that was on display
[2:14:10] Lord and in Our Lives your God when the
[2:14:16] blood has been applied it's your life
[2:14:18] that's on display
[2:14:20] it's what's reflected Lord in us and
[2:14:24] through us I pray Lord if there's one
[2:14:29] here this morning that doesn't know you
[2:14:31] maybe they're here Lord and they've
[2:14:34] never even accepted you Lord God as
[2:14:36] their Lord and Savior maybe they went to
[2:14:38] church Lord for many of their lives but
[2:14:41] they've never ever come to a place where
[2:14:43] they've repented Lord really been sorry
[2:14:46] for their sins but Lord God under your
[2:14:50] presence it brings conviction to a heart
[2:14:52] and they would have the question or eyes
[2:14:55] in their heart Lord what must I do to be
[2:14:57] saved
[2:14:58] Lord Jesus would never want to be
[2:15:01] negligent Lord because you are still
[2:15:05] calling two hearts I pray God that may
[2:15:09] lure that heart and life just be Lord as
[2:15:11] it's offered up to you
[2:15:14] god I pray the Lord that you would
[2:15:17] cleanse them Lord if they've never
[2:15:20] walked into the waters of baptism and
[2:15:23] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:15:25] Jesus Christ
[2:15:26] they've never Lord God been identified
[2:15:28] in your burial maybe they've been
[2:15:31] identified with the church Lord but
[2:15:34] father they realize I need to be
[2:15:35] identified with Jesus Christ Lord may
[2:15:38] they this morning
[2:15:40] surrender themselves
[2:15:47] and then Lord making ready to receive
[2:15:52] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:56] Lord it's not a reward it's a gift the
[2:16:01] gift of the Holy Ghost not what we earn
[2:16:05] not what we merit no it's the gift of
[2:16:09] the Holy Ghost
[2:16:11] Lord God may they receive him or not
[2:16:14] pray may it be such a desperation that
[2:16:18] would strike Lord within their heart
[2:16:19] such a hunger Lord
[2:16:21] many parents Lord sitting here right now
[2:16:24] grandparents even Lord God different
[2:16:26] ones Lord had got friends co-workers
[2:16:28] different ones that Lord you've laid on
[2:16:30] their heart and they have them on their
[2:16:31] heart right now
[2:16:32] and Lord God as we come before the
[2:16:35] throne of grace I believe where we're
[2:16:38] standing Lord Lord God we offer prayer
[2:16:41] right now we ask Lord that the Holy
[2:16:44] Spirit the angel of the Lord as you
[2:16:46] dealt with the prodigal when he was down
[2:16:49] there Lord God in that pig pen in his
[2:16:51] lowest part you dealt with him Lord and
[2:16:55] Lord God you begin to turn his heart
[2:16:57] toward home father I ask right now Lord
[2:17:00] God that as the Holy Spirit would go out
[2:17:03] Lord God and begin to deal Lord God with
[2:17:05] that heart Lord and turned that heart
[2:17:08] around Lord God to begin to think Lord
[2:17:10] God about you Lord to begin to think
[2:17:13] about home Lord God Oh father to begin
[2:17:16] to think about Lord father the presence
[2:17:19] of God services that they've said in
[2:17:21] maybe some Lord they don't Lord have
[2:17:23] never said Lord within a service maybe
[2:17:25] they haven't been privileged Lord God
[2:17:27] like some Lord God of our young people
[2:17:29] have been but I pray Heavenly Father
[2:17:32] that God may you go Lord and visit them
[2:17:34] Lord God and Lord calls the Lord God
[2:17:37] their hearts Lord to begin Lord to
[2:17:39] tender and turn to You Lord Jesus I pray
[2:17:42] Brannen Lord God may you move Lord for
[2:17:45] them when they could look at all their
[2:17:47] surroundings Lord they might look at all
[2:17:49] their problems and their difficulties
[2:17:51] they might look at everything around
[2:17:53] their life Lord I pray that God but main
[2:17:56] Lord God their hearts be lifted Lord
[2:17:58] that looks beyond Lord called the Pigpen
[2:18:00] where they're at Lord and it would
[2:18:03] actually begin to look back home Lord

[2:18:07] ask Lord for every backslider Lord for
[2:18:10] every son and daughter Lord God Oh
[2:18:12] father for the grandchildren Lord God we

[2:18:18] Oh father in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:18:21] Lord we send the Holy Ghost Lord God the
[2:18:24] age of the Lord that you'll deal with
[2:18:26] their hearts Lord God granted Lord God
[2:18:29] search them out Lord how pretty father
[2:18:32] and Lord might like Jacob may they get
[2:18:35] tired of being Jacob granting Lord I
[2:18:39] pray thee all Jesus Lord
[2:18:47] as we stand here Lord God as your
[2:18:50] children or than many that standing here
[2:18:56] we come out of services every time Lord
[2:18:58] as we come out of a service I always
[2:19:01] think of what your prophet talks about
[2:19:02] Lord he said a man of God gets done
[2:19:04] preaching on Sunday he said the devil is
[2:19:06] waiting to try to knock every ounce of
[2:19:07] confidence out of him on Monday morning
[2:19:09] everything that the Holy Ghost instilled
[2:19:12] into him Lord Jesus that's not just for
[2:19:16] me that's each and every one of your
[2:19:18] children
[2:19:19] it shows coming to the house of God Lord
[2:19:23] God as your presence comes through your
[2:19:25] word you instill confidence in us Lord
[2:19:27] and I pray Heavenly Father this is why
[2:19:31] when every service is said and done as
[2:19:34] Paul could say I'll never come to you
[2:19:36] with enticing words of man's wisdom that
[2:19:38] your faith would rest in man's words but
[2:19:43] that your faith would rest in the power
[2:19:44] of God Oh Lord Jesus
[2:19:47] how we thank you Lord for lives and
[2:19:50] hearts that you've changed thank you God
[2:19:52] for each and every one I thank you for
[2:19:54] how the Lord you're still working in our
[2:19:57] midst or God Lord there's still many
