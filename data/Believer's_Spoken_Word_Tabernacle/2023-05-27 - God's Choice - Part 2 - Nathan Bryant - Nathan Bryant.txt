know I like how brother Brown said it and I don't know who the brother was but he said brother Mike he said to think about it God looked all the way down through time and he saw even all of our mistakes and all our failures and everything and yet he chose us because choosing was not based on any human Merit whatsoever we were always let me just say it simple we were always his youngins we were always his children we always belong to him God never came to that Revelation you and I have come to that Revelation a man of who God is and he's our father I'm his child oh my God when that Revelation strikes within our heart there's no devil there's no demon that can stand on any of those grounds any longer because at that moment all the grounds have been restored to that believer personally amen Calvary paid for every Redemptive blessing and so here we are this morning enjoying the Redemptive blessings of calvary amen because of God's Amazing Grace he sent back the Holy Spirit to draw us and bring you and I to life oh what a people full of the joy of the Lord as we said last night brother Brandon said that little fishy if it looked at that water and said I better be careful I might drink up all this water and brother Brandon goes on to say he said he would be more easily done for a little fishy to do that than you could ever do that to God you can never exhaust the inexhaustible Fountain of almighty God I don't care what the need is we might think it's too high ask for big things you might think it's God Specializes even in showing you and I he took a little fishy not a trophy Bass not a trophy bass a little fishy I don't even know what it was maybe it was a panfish a bluegill I don't know it was a little fish but I'm grateful because you know why he still moves on little me he moves on my little needs they don't have to be trophy needs God just shows that I'll take situations where it looks like the whole inside of your life has been ripped out but I'm The God Who restores [Applause] that's what this word does for you and I it's a word of restoration oh my God is moving God is moving and you know where he's moving he's moving in his people he's moving in his people that's tremendous I'm glad the move is on aren't you a man so glad to have each and every one of you amen glad to have the different visitors that are here Amen brother Wayne Amen brother Isaac God bless you and then thank for thank you for being here amen sister Carissa and I want to believe that you all came for the meetings and to hear brother Nathan but I see a little bundle back there but I'm not I don't know but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt I know [Music] but Amen brother Nathanael God bless you thank you for being here amen amen if there's somebody else oh brother Daniel Yes Man didn't we just enjoy last week brother Daniel [Applause] the only thing you say is that was good it was real good amen and we just just real privileged to have you here this morning and I want to remind you the fellowship dinner right away after the service at the Mill Hollow but we're not in any Rush we want God to have his way you know I always look at it like this we have when we have Fellowship dinners and things like that I I don't want to put God on a timer because this is more important than anything else right and that's the things that um we just are so thankful to have brother Nathan Mrs Rebecca and the family with us and man wasn't that good last night man it was just good so we just want to welcome brother Nathan and just invite him to the pulpit and just ask him just to mind the Lord just that God would just have his way here I think it'd be good to continue to sing that to think about it where would we be I think brother Brian echoed it and my goodness sometimes I don't know I lay my head down on the bed and I think about the path and where I was going in the direction I was heading and sometimes there are things those are the things I just jerk out real quick and say oh God thank you for your grace thank you for your grace thank you for your grace oh glory be to God aren't you glad where would I be [Music] you and I'm glad you see through eyes [Music] and [Music] [Music] Grace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] friends but now [Music] amen you thankful for Grace this morning praise the Lord good to be in church and appreciate those specials this morning I was thinking back in the inside of 1962 brother Graham said brother Outlaws church and he said brother Billy forgot to pass out the prayer cards that morning he said well he comes when I was in that nice little choir come back up here and sing for us and brother Outlaws song brother Outlaw's son turns loose on I was there when the spirit came and my if you don't like Pentecostal singing don't listen to that tape brother Bram comes back he said how thankful we are for that nice spiritual lift amen so I believe in anointed singing don't you amen praise the Lord let's stand together this morning man God is sure mindful of us isn't he brother Wayne I didn't pay close enough attention to the to the flyer as I said last night I thought this whole time I was preaching Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning and yesterday afternoon I realized oh service is Saturday morning and I was expecting to have all day today to study and so uh that didn't happen but thank God and got to preaching last night and the people started pulling I didn't even get to half of my notes from last night so we got a part two this morning so God knows even when we don't but some of you may have heard but brother Roy Shrewsbury passed away yesterday so we want to want to remember his family in prayer 98 years old he preached till he was 95. I thought my I guess us preachers don't get to retire do we 95 he preached to passed away at 98 years old so we thank God for his Gallant soul and every effort he put forth for the kingdom of God want to remember his family in prayer this morning and no doubt there's been needs already mentioned and represented but let's just go ahead and go to the Lord and I don't normally do this before we go to the scripture but let's go ahead and just go to the Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly Father Lord we are truly thankful Lord for your word for your promises Lord because we know that Lord every promise is true and we're depending on those this morning we're resting on that and we thank you for every believer gathered here this morning and those that are listening in by way of streaming and Lord we we thank you for your presence that we feel here this morning truly Lord we're blessed to be able to to serve you in spirit and Truth Lord Lord we we just want to thank you for the Gallant soul of our brother Lord that spent so many years ministering this gospel and and every effort he put forth and the things he did for the kingdom of God and I pray that you'd Comfort his family during this time with brother Ron Lily there in the church Lord and just Comfort them in a special way and I pray that she would just have preeminence in this service this morning may may each individual receive a Special Touch from you Lord and may we be able to look beyond the The Vessel that's that's been selected to speak this morning and may we see Jesus Christ and Lord because I I have nothing in myself to bring but but I'm depending on you this morning and Lord as Ministers of the Gospel we recognize the Lord we we are inadequate we're enabled to do anything that would that would be of Eternal value but we depend on you for those parts Lord and so Lord we we do the only thing that we can do as brother Branham said he had a gift and that gift was to get himself out of the way so I pray this morning Father that you'd help me to pull into a gear or a channel where I could get out of the way Lord where you could speak something that would encourage people we're not here just to to waste someone's time we're not here just to be seen or to be heard or but Lord we we want to put forth every effort that we can to do something to encourage the Bride of Jesus Christ and that'll take you to do it father so we commit the service to you we thank you for your promise that you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us you said wherever two or three were gathered together you'd be in our midst and so we commit the service to you Lord and thank you for all things that you do in Jesus Christ's name amen we're truly blessed aren't we amen let's turn back to Acts chapter one and and pick up where we left off last night and we looked at David and Moses and Gideon and different characters of the scripture but we got to um just beginning to look at this and and Lord will take this and look at it this morning Acts chapter 1 verse 21 this is after Judas has has went and hung himself and the disciples are in the upper room they realize there's a need for for God to move on the scene and do something I think we've let me try this well we might be better off to do it that way we had the format right there for a minute and then I messed it up it was cutting off on us last night but let's see what we can do God's good isn't he technology is good when it works well we'll just do that and you can kind of see a little better I think if we do it that way I don't think you can squint hard enough to read my other slides there anyhow but get it get ahead of me Acts chapter 1 and verse 21 wherefore of these men which have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us beginning from the baptism of John unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness of us of his resurrection you notice the disciples their stipulation that they were choosing to to pick this man they had it all in their mind of how it was to be and what type of man this would be to take judas's place and and they wanted a good old boy they wanted somebody that had been around since back in the day when when John first baptized Jesus and this was in their mind what the qualification was but you realize this is before the baptism of the Holy Ghost came and God had a different plan and so it says they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the 11 Apostles God bless you you can be seated this morning we want to continue on with this thought of God's choice God's choice we found that as brother Bannon tells us man's Choice many times is not the same as God's choice he says in Hebrews chapter 6 part 2 and 1957 when they selected a man to take judas's place they got the wrong man they got a gentleman Matthias a great scribe a scholar a diplomat they said he'll just take the real place boy he looks like a real man but it wasn't God's choice they with the best of their ability and 120 of them in the upper room and they narrowed it down to two men that they thought well it's got to be one of these two and they cast slots and they chose the wrong man brother Brandon said he never did anything that was recorded in the scriptures yet probably a good man probably would have made a great Deacon or a great Sunday school teacher a great man but wasn't called to this place that the disciples thought that he should be chosen and that was their choice but God's choice as we looked at it last night I want to look at this scripture again this was God's choice Acts chapter 8 verse 3 asked for Saul he made Havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committed them to prison that was God's choice and if you or I had been there if we'd be honest with ourselves this would have probably been one of the last men that we would have chosen but that was God's choice Moses if we had chosen someone to be a deliverer for the children of Egypt if you or I had been there we wouldn't have chosen the man that had tried years before it had failed and had been labeled as a murderer we wouldn't have picked Moses but that was God's choice and many of the characters in The Bible will be honest with ourselves I know sometimes you know we we read it and sugar coat it and and we look at it you know through just our our carnal backwards looking of all my if I'd have been there I would have chosen this manner that man but if we'll be honest with ourselves most of these men as we look at even what is shared with us in the scripture about them many of their flaws and things in their personal life and in their human nature that I'm thankful that the Bible doesn't say those things about me I'm thankful that it hasn't been written for me thousands of years like it was about Samson and David and Moses and Abraham and different ones things that the Bible shares about them but I'm also thankful that it's in there because then with our human Frailty and our human weakness when the Devil comes and begins to beat us over the head and says you'll never make it you're not worthy you're not you know sometimes we make the devil out to be just an absolute liar but there's many times that the devil will use the truth against you yes sir brother banham sat there when little Sharon Rose was dying and he called it his Gethsemane his darkest hour he said he could understand his white dying but to see that little baby go and he said he was standing there and he knelt by the bed and he began to pray and begin to beg God for this child's life and he said it was just as though a dark seat came down beside the bed and as if God had ignored his prayer as if God had refused to answer he said then the devil came up beside the bed and began to whisper in his ear and he said and you say he's a good God and you say he's a Healer and you say that you know he's done all these things and and he said but look at what he's done he's taken your wife from you and he's taking your daddy from you and your brother from you look at all these things that he said everything he was telling me was the truth the devil was and twist it to his own perverted means yes sir a lot of false doctrines got started because somebody took the truth and twisted it to their own perverted means most false doctrines that are out there if you go back and find out how they originated they originated on the truth but then somebody began to sow their own interpretation to it and begin to twist the truth the devil when he met Eve he told her 99 of the truth but then he just added one word and many times the devil will use the truth against us and he'll come and he'll tell us things about ourselves that God would never tell you about yourself you say was the devil more honest with me than God no it's just that God doesn't remember some of those things about you that the devil remembers some of those things that the devil throws in your face God has cast in the sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't even remember anymore but the devil will use those things about you things that are true about us he'll use those things and he'll remind you but remember when you used to be this way and remember when you do this and remember yesterday when you had that thought and remember last week when you you you responded to somebody in a way that you should have just got away and prayed really before you sent that text or before you sent that email or before you made that that phone call and so you responded out of reaction you said something you shouldn't have said and he reminds us of those things and he points us back to those things and many of those things are true about us but that's not God's thoughts of us you see there were many things that David could have thought about himself as we looked at him last night and and some of his human weakness and human errors and there were things that David could have thought about himself there were things that the devil no doubt said to David about himself but it didn't matter what the devil thought about David it didn't even really matter what David thought about David it mattered what God thought about David you know David when he goes down there to fight Goliath and he looks so so uh an uneven match against this Goliath against this giant and he goes down there to fight Goliath and it looked like all the odds were against him but hey I just I'll just say it this way I believe David could have laid down there on the battlefield and just put his slingshot in his pocket and Goliath would have tripped on his way down to him and broke his neck or something it was impossible for David to lose against Goliath it was impossible and and Saul and different ones in the Army looking at it there no doubt they thought it's impossible for this young man to win but it was impossible for him to lose take you until God is done with him brother random was saying the message I know he said oh Trials come he said why did they come he said it's to bring us into a closer fellowship with God he said God takes trials and puts a bit sentence him out and makes the trials he said so no matter how great the trial no matter how great the opposition he said Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you he realized when when Satan comes up against us it'd be like if he was in school and the bully at school came down knocked on the door some some of brother Samuel's Sons here if they if they were in school and they they the bully came up and knocked on the door said Mr Browning I'd like to take your son out in the street and work him over a little bit but there's a law that I've got to get your permission first would it be okay so you get out of here you crazy thing or you'll have a Manning on this ordeal and you realize that's what it is with Satan he has to go and ask my father permission there's a little sister was sitting back there in the hallway with the headache that we we want to remember in prayer this morning that God will just touch her and deliver you realize Satan had to go and knock on the father's door and say is it all right if I give her a headache this morning and you realize if God allowed it to happen that even though maybe it's causing her pain and discomfort there was a reason and a purpose for him to allow that you realize no matter how dark the storm no matter how bad the trial if God has allowed it to come he didn't just do that to punish you he didn't do that because he's an unjust judge he did that because there's a reason and a purpose and we look at a moment in time and we get caught in that but God looks down through eternity and says this is what's best for my child amen things that happen tragedies and things that we don't understand and most people would look at things like the Holocaust even Ministers of the Gospel during that time turned away and became atheists because they couldn't they couldn't reconcile how that God could sit up there in heaven that man wrote the book The Silent God that brother Adam talked about and how did a man could how that God could sit up there and and could just remain silent and watch his children slaughtered by the millions they couldn't understand it but we had a Prophet come and say it was the gentle hand of Jehovah getting his children back in their Homeland well thank God for prophetic insights that we have the ability to look at things differently than some people look at them the gentle hand of Jehovah How could a statement like that be made because that's what it was it's that God has a way of doing things and sometimes they look terrible sometimes circumstances in our life let's just be honest there's probably a lot of us here this morning that right now maybe things don't look good but I promise you they're working together for your good maybe they don't look good for you this morning maybe the finances are bad maybe your health is bad maybe you've been oppressed or tormented or maybe the devil's tried to come at you with depression or or anxiety and maybe the doctors give you up or maybe there's trouble in the home maybe broken families and things and it doesn't look good but I promised you this morning that Romans 8 and 38 or Romans 8 28 is is true in the face of anything things it's easy to say all things when we get that bonus check all things work together when Biden was sending all those stimulus checks all things weren't together for the good of them they love the Lord amen when you meet that lovely young lady finally and Wedding Bells Are Ringing you standing there at the altar all things work together for good but fast forward a few years and brother Brandon said when you first get married everything's just wonderful but he said but then the trials of Life begin to come and that's when you've got to understand one another that's when you got to love one another in the middle of the trial when she's disappointed in you and you're disappointed in her can you stand there and say all things work together for good when the baby's sick in the hospital when the bank account's overdrawn and you're getting those overdraft fees can we stand there and say all things work together for good job had one of the worst days anybody could ever imagine happening and his result his response was not well if that's the way it is I'll just quit church if that's the way it is I'll just leave the message if that's the way it is I'll just stop serving God and be an atheist his response to the worst day that we could imagine was he fell on his face and he worshiped God all right David's response to the greatest sin that he ever did when he falls as we looked at it last night it was he falls into this adultery with Bathsheba and she gets pregnant and he goes and he allows little Uriah there to be killed on the battlefield and his men draw back from him and leave him out there by himself brother said when I get to heaven I want to shake your eye as hands he didn't say that about a lot of people if he had said that about me I'd have a t-shirt printed when I get to heaven I want to say brother Nathan saying I'd go around you've seen this quote stick or whatever yeah home I'd be handling them out in services but he said that about Uriah when I get to heaven I want to shake his hand and David's response to his greatest mistake and when the prophet has come and expose this on him and said David you're the man you're the man that you're proclaiming judgment about when it's not us see we're quick to judge somebody else and say oh yes they deserve bring them up before the church and all exposes when it's us Grace Grace cried the Capstone when it's our family that's why as a pastor when I'm sitting there counseling somebody or trying to encourage somebody or dealing with the situation at church I try to picture what if that was my son or daughter that I was sitting there handling that situation with because someday it may be and if I'm going to handle it different with them because well they're the pastor's child then I am going to be with somebody else then people will see a double standard we see that in a lot of message churches that say well that's the Deacon's son or that so they get to do this but this brother over here oh my when his child did it they just about ran him out of town on a board but David's response he didn't say well uh now now people know that I'm a sinner and so I'm just going to stay home for about three years and stream but it said he went to the temple and he worships he went down to the Tabernacle there and he begins to worship God because even though he was a failure God was still worthy of worship we make it about us well I worked all day and I'm tired it's Wednesday night I don't feel like worshiping Paul I'm sorry I didn't realize it was all about you wow wow I'll let the song leader do it for me I'll let the pastor preach me into it all but there's something brother Adam said but your priests and Kings with the sacrifice of praise on our lips that when we come to church I don't feel like raising my hands well that's the time we should do it Finish Line I don't feel like praising him well he's worthy of it whether I feel like it or not I'm thankful that my dad growing up brother Samuel I'm thankful he didn't only go to work to provide for his family on days that he felt like it there are a lot of days I'm sure he didn't feel like it he still rolled out of bed and a lot of times when I was a little boy he was driving 90 miles each way to work in a chemical plant there and dad's not a fan of heights but he'd go right up in those smokestacks and work because he had a baby and some other children and a wife back home that needed to be fed and he was traveling back and forth working days with pain in his body and sickness in his body but he had an obligation that he had to provide for his family so he went even when he didn't feel like it now that's in the natural but I want to say there's times as Believers we probably don't feel like going to church we probably don't feel like worshiping God but as a Believer I have an obligation to love him and to serve him and to worship him whether I feel like it or not hey he didn't feel like going to Calvary for me but he did it anyhow this man Saul was a persecutor of the church he was going about and putting them in prison and consenting unto little Stephen's death as we looked at it last night standing there holding the coach and God looks down through eternity and he says I choose him that wouldn't have been our choice it wasn't the apostles Choice even when he began to preach they said hey we don't know about this man and Barnabas had to bring him and kind of encourage him hey the Lord's really doing some mighty things for him I know maybe I know all about his past but you ought to come down to the meeting that you ought to see what the Lord's doing something has got a hold of this man and changed him so that wasn't their choice they chose Matthias and they chose wrong but this was God's choice Acts chapter 9 and verse 13 this is when God tells ananias to go and pray for Paul because he's been blinded by this Supernatural light that others couldn't even see but it was so real to Paul that it blinded his eyes and ananias does like us a lot of times God tells us to do something and we want to explain all the details to God we want to inform God but God do you really know about this situation all he knows but God you just don't understand no he understands but God if you'd only been through what I've been through oh he's been through more than what you've been through God you just don't know what type of person all he knows better than you know in fact he knows better than they know you see many of the trials that God allowed the Believers to go down through Through the Ages you realize Abraham when he he's placed in that test and he draws back his hand to slay Isaac God did not need for Abraham to do that to prove Abraham to God God knew what was in Abraham but I believe he wanted Abraham to realize what was really down in Abraham God didn't need to prove job so that he had to test him and make I just I just want a job I want to put she'll really serve me God had already spoke over job to the devil that he said it don't matter what you do he won't turn against me God knew but he wanted job to have that Assurance there's trials we go through and come out the other side we think oh my God there's no way I could have held on through that so I know it was you that was holding on to me and God allows us to go through those times not to prove us to him but to prove us to us so really what the quality that we're made of and it's molding and building that character in a Christian brother Brown said character is not a gift it's a victory all right and so now God tells ananias go pray for this man and ananias answered the Lord Lord I have heard many I've heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints of Jerusalem and here he hath Authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is the chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel he's a chosen vessel God's choice God's choice he realizes it's easy for us to look back there and say that about Paul but can you say it about yourself this morning I didn't choose me God chose me all right as we said last night people want to complain about brother Branham being Malachi 4. hey don't don't come and complain to me don't come and complain to brother Branham I didn't choose him he didn't choose him God chose him you got a problem with it take it up with God God why didn't you choose somebody else well that same Spirit was back there in Saul's day you think there were people that were happy that that's who God chose God why didn't you choose my uncle my he's he has it hardly it's done anything his whole life he's he's been there he's been faithful in the synagogue and all my he walked right with Jesus all the way from the baptism and he was there at this and he was there at this and he did this and he did that he sacrificed over here he gave us in this man's the persecutor of the church and you chose him but God knew there was something down on the inside of Paul that was exactly what he needed to get to the people that he was trying to reach a quality inside of Paul we look at it and say well this brother is a little different than me his personality is a little different his style is a little different his his way of ministry or the way their worship service is or something is a little different than us so I guess we'll just write them up but God has a way of using people like that to reach somebody that maybe we can't reach he's a god of variety yes here my I had a sister at our church she's going through a battle and she got some family members telling her she's going to hell because she believes the message then she's got other people other family members on the other side telling her you're going to hell because you go to the church you do they're message Believers but they think she picked the wrong church so she's going to hell because of that she said what do you think brother Nathan I said I think they've forgotten the Simplicity of John 3 16. that we don't go to go to heaven because of where we go to church or we don't go to heaven because we believe a Doctrine the right way but we go to heaven because Jesus Christ paid a price for us 2 000 years ago that I couldn't pay and because I have accepted what he did for me I'm going to heaven no matter what anybody thinks about me you didn't put me in you can't take me out I get to go to heaven because Jesus paved the way for me [Applause] so he believes the wrong thing or he picked the wrong church or he did this or he did that he don't see it like me oh you know I'm so thankful that God draws the circle bigger amen my [Music] from that time 19 60. brother bam says this is the quote we finally got to it this is the quote I said yesterday I was pushing the lawnmower around the yard and praying about what to preach listening to tape and the Lord just dropped this title into my heart as I was listening to this tape brother man said when Paul got converted perhaps the church said oh look what we got now we got this great big ball we know that that man said under gamalia he's one of the greatest teachers in the land and he's a Pharisee he's oh he's a great man we we'll put him up at Jerusalem and we'll make him the head of the church up there and we'll take Peter of course the Bible said he was ignorant and unlearned and he's got the keys and we'll send him out to the poor dumb Gentiles that's the one we'll send him to because he does a lot of Miracles but this great intellectual man will bring up here at this intellectual crowd huh he says the Holy Ghost sent Paul out to the dumb ones and made him forget all he ever known and took Peter to Dublin and sent him up to the educated ones what's the matter they met God and from that time on the intellectuals didn't count that's right from that time on the record was changed how God does things just contrary to man's thinking [Music] now we look at that and we can look we we're so good as human beings that looking back at history and said oh well praise God yes I would have known that if I was there but Spirits don't die and so whatever your attitude would have been back there is what your attitude is now I've got people you know relatives and things out in the nominal world all they don't have a problem recognizing Noah and Moses and and David and characters like that of course they were prophets but when it comes to today and a man does more signs and wonders than what David did and it's more Vindicated and takes us back to the original Earth they have a problem recognizing that but yet they would have followed a man who said God told me to build a boat when it never rains they would have followed that but couldn't follow brother Branham they would have followed a man who said hey God came supernaturally and spoke to me out of a bush and I walked by and it was burning but it wasn't being consumed and he spoke out of that bush and he said I am that I am did you get a picture of it Moses didn't have my Polaroid with me did you get a sample of that leaf and bring it back to the chemical uh plant to be able to break it down and see what was causing that maybe it was just a maybe it was just a freak of nature maybe it was something maybe there was a chemical on it that did that no I I didn't do that did you get a recording of God's voice saying I am that I no I don't have that you're just going to have to take my word oh I would have believed that man but a prophet at our age no I can't believe that you wouldn't have believed back then your action today shows that we've had more Vindication more evidence than any other age people have a hard time with it why because there was nothing in them to believe they wouldn't have believed back there that's right God takes this man whose name was Saul which meant desired oh my we like that don't we oh my brother's would invite him to Great conventions and things all we we desire this man to come he's friends with K Ephesus and and my he's got a name among the brother and look what he's doing my he's he's really putting the pressure to this Christian Movement over here and my he's a great man he's powerful he's got he's got it in with the governor there to where he's writing him letters and giving him power and authority he was desired and God takes him and says that I can't use you with that name but I'm going to take that s off and make it a p and that's going to mean small or little amen but Lord I'm going to take you from being this desired one from being this popular and I'm going to take you and you're going to be put in prison and you're going to be stoned with rocks and you're going to be beaten and you're going to be almost drowned in the sea on multiple occasions and you're going to be kicked out of towns and out of synagogues I'm going to take this one who was desired and make you small or little how many well I want to ask you to raise your hands but how many of us would have wanted a Ministry like Paul's always say oh praise God my he smote a man blind and he did this and he did he he he told that lady turned around cast that devil out of her and and he look at all the signs oh yes but look at what else followed his ministry he didn't write a lot of his emails to the church from a nice kissy office in a 300 chair but he was in prison down in Dungeons and things he takes this man he says he's going to be a chosen vessel to the Gentiles no way we would have chosen Paul if we had been the ones choosing oh we would have probably been right there voting for Matthias or one of the other brothers oh yes that's a real man of God but when it came time to choose Paul my no doubt the church was shocked but that was God's choice you realize it wasn't just those men in the upper room that would have been shocked by this no doubt it was a shock to Paul that Lord after all this he comes and Paul doesn't just say this to be humble I I hear people all the time brother Wayne they said Oh Brother Branham just made these statements to be humble well then how can I follow that how do I know then when he was being humble and when he was being real and when it's a quote they don't like or they think that it takes away from something oh well we just we think he was just being humble there well why don't you just say we feel like he lied he was just lying to make people happy no you must be following a different man than me that's right brother no when he would stand there before 300 of the Ministerial Association of Chicago and say just bring your Bible and show me he didn't compromise with them because of popularity or political pressure so no I don't believe he said things just to be humble I believe he said what he meant he meant what he said and so I believe the same thing of Saint Paul because he was the same caliber Prophet a prophet messenger for that age and he comes and he says my he said I'm the least among you because I persecuted the church Paul wasn't saying that so people would think Oh my he is so humble look at look at how humble that man is Paul really felt that way and no doubt he'd maybe wake up in a cold sweat sometimes in the middle of the night hearing this Stephen stand there and and say father lay not this to their charge and he'd wake up and think how could I do it how could I stand there and hold the coach of those men you think he didn't feel unworthy you think the devil didn't get on his shoulder sometimes to say who do you think you are Paul who do you think you are to write these letters to these established churches and these men of God who have been Believers way longer than you have who do you think you are to stand there and correct a man like Peter who our lord Jesus said had the keys to the kingdom foreign but it was God's choice [Applause] perfect strength by Perfect weakness again we're going to look at several quotes from this tonight or this morning I thought it was going to be tonight but it's this morning 1961. one of the important things that we must Master now he says remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if ever if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us if we get to a spot we come out as Minister bless God well I've got a gift in my life and I've got this and I've got that when I come to a Pulpit I thank God if you don't show up this is going to be a mess if you don't show up then I don't have anything to say but I found out that he's faithful I found out that he shows up every time there's been times I've got right down to the wire where I thought Lord I have no idea what I'm going to say when I step out there but he's never failed me yet and he shows up and so we depend on him in that way that it is not our human ability it is not my human ability it is not something in me that that I can come out and say oh my I have this as a preacher of the Gospel or as a message believer as as this or that I have nothing to brag on of myself but it's Jesus that does the work brother Branham didn't have anything in his family history to brag about Paul didn't have anything of his great choices that he could brag about but it was God that got a hold of these men and used them because it was God's choice to do so and so as I said last night we can get to a spot where we let the devil take these things and if we're not careful we just become so self-deprecating that we just want to say so many terrible things about it said well I'm just a failure and I'm just no good and I'm I guess I'm just a weak Christian and I guess I just don't have much Faith Brotherhood said that's exactly how the devil wants you to talk he wants you to have that type of confession over your life but then if the devil can't push you to that extreme he'll push you over here well bless God I'm the bride and I I've got bride power and I can do this and I can do that I'll go out here and I ain't going to do nothing without Jesus yes amen hey I believe there's power in the bride but it is not of her own thinking we talk about the third pull watch out brother Branham uses the third pull it wasn't name it and claim it you see there's a great difference between the Pentecostal thinking and what brother Madam actually taught us now there's men in the Pentecostal Realms oh naming and claim it and prosperity Doctrine I Don't Preach Prosperity but I do preach provisions and man God didn't promise me a Ferrari but he promised that he'd provide for me God God didn't promise me a 5 500 000 square foot mansion or something like that but he did promise me that he'd provide for me and so when you look at men like uh uh I'm trying to remember who the man was oh was it Norman Vincent peel that wrote that book power of positive thinking and brother man talked about Norman Vince appeal I've seen his church there in New York where he pastored brother Brandon talked about how he how reverent it was when they went in and out and dismissed Services he'd have three services on a Sunday because they had such great crowds and things and and but Norman Vincent peel would take if you've ever read or heard his book there The Power of Positive Thinking Norman Vincent Peale had a wonderful concept but he placed it in the hands of man that just if you take it and you think about it and and you claim it and you confess it well that's wonderful if you have a scriptural promise if it's in the word then absolutely we can claim that with authority because God's word said so but there's things that people go out and claim that is not in God's word for them to do and so it's not just mind over matter it's not just the power of positive thinking but it is taking the promises of God and confessing those over your life see how close it was but yet then we place it in the hands of man brother Bannon would say it this way listen I hope I hope you you understand this morning what he's saying to us he said I'm not a Healer he said If I Was A Healer their laser my mother dying he said If I Was A Healer I'd go heal her but he said I can only do as he says Jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily stood there and he said I only do that which the father shows me brother Brown said in 20th century Prophet there he said it showed that he didn't do anything without a vision from the father so there are times as brothers we get under inspiration and there have been things that I've said that I thought goodness gracious if that was me I'd be scared to death to say it but God brought it to pass because it wasn't my thoughts it was something he impressed on me over and over and over sometimes as a minister we're standing there saying God Don't make me say that God I don't want to say that he keeps impressing it and impressing okay God then I know that's not me that's not my thought so I'll say it and if it's him better watch out devil every demon out of hell can't stop it but remember brother Neville he had a gift of Prophecy and brother Branham sets him down and says brother Neville you need to be careful and it wasn't that he didn't have a gift wasn't that he wasn't a Godly Man wasn't that he didn't have the Holy Ghost he said you need to be careful because the people are pulling on you so much they're going to pull something out of you humanly that you'll get in the flesh and just say something to try to help them that little girl came there the Simpson girl I think it was and said well brother Branham I had a dream tell me what it is and every time she'd get around and brother banned him you got the interpretation for that dream brother Brandon you got the interpretation she began to get a little frustrated with him and he said what if I would tell you he said I think I know well bless God he's a prophet that's good enough for me he said I think I know but he said but what if I said so and that was just me and then it's not so then what if there's a need and she comes around how can she have confidence in me so I believe it's the bride of Christ we will speak things and they will come to pass but brother Branham said it's not men that's leading the church now some people ran off on a limb and said well we don't need anybody then but read the rest of the quote he said it's the Holy Spirit leading the church through man [Applause] and so if a man will surrender to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will work through him and speak through him watch out Satan but if that happens and then we get in ourself then we say well bless God look what I did it wasn't you it wasn't you that said that and if we begin to depend on our own ability and say well uh look what look what I accomplished and then we go out and try to do it you better be careful [Applause] David was a giant slayer because Jehovah was with him but you take Jehovah out of the equation I doubt David could have whipped very much at all Samson was a mighty man of Valor fought a thousand men but they cut his hair and a little woman led him awaited some Philistine men like a little whipped puppy there was a difference in Samson under the anointing in Samson without the anointing sir there's something about it God can anoint a man and you talk about my as a minister of the Gospel these Minister Brothers Here know what it's like and can relate to it and when we hear Brothers make statements and and then we know in our own little Ministries what it's like what it must have been to him to where there's been times that you know you feel such a brother man would call it a super anointing and you feel so anointed of God and you see God do things I've stood in prayer lines and seen demons cast out of people brother brother Wayne's been in in Indians seen demon-possessed people the spirits cast off of them and delivered when you stand in a prayer line and pray for somebody with a huge tumor on their head and the next day they send you a picture and that tumor is not there anymore you say oh God thank you that that power is still there of the resurrection and then you come out from under that and you're just Nathan Brian again when you felt like you could run through a troop and leap over a wall and then the Devil comes and says who Do You Think You Are it's a battle yes right yeah yes sir and you take our humble Ministries and you compare that to brother randoms where he said he said an hour of preaching be like eight hours with the sledgehammer and then he said one of those Visions would do more than preaching preaching two or three hours and he'd have maybe a dozen Visions maybe 20 30 Visions a night I need to go out and be so delirious they'd have to drive him around try to get him back to himself hey so now when you're way up here it's fine and when you're way down here it's fine but when you're coming down between those two that's when it's hard and we recognize what this that's like a little bit in a and maybe an amateur form as Minister brothers that you come out from another day I've walked off the platform at our church and gone out and there's a little stairwell you go out the back side of the pulpit here and go down the stairs I've sat on the stairs and wept after a sermon and think oh God why because I felt like I was could run through a troop and leap over a wall up here but you get down there and then the devil begins to bombard you who Do You Think You Are as Believers and especially as ministers and as pastors many times the devil will will bombard us with an imposter syndrome oh yeah yeah yeah you look at what you've done but all those people really knew if they knew who you used to be or if they knew some of the things that you battle in your mind how that the devil tormentioned things and he'll get on our back but you know what I say I didn't choose me he chose me a brother stood out here in this entryway last night he said brother he said there's no doubt in my mind that God chose you to be in the area that you're at and I said oh but it was I wouldn't have chosen I wouldn't have chose it I won't say I there was nowhere else in the world that uh that I wouldn't have picked over it I guess I would rather Pastor where I'm at than Siberia or China or Russia there's places but I don't know anywhere in the United States that I wouldn't have picked over where God called me to I grew up there I knew what I was up against I didn't want to choose that but God chose it and we look at it many times and we try to figure it all out but God does the choosing perfect strength again 1961. we've got to get away from that human ability we got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever we are got to surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing me and myself I am nothing but me and Jesus that's a different story you and yourself you're nothing but you and Jesus that's a different story then let God start from there he says then he starts moving working and that includes all of us everyone that's the thing that we got to do we've got to get to a spot where we realize God it's not me I can't just walk out here and pull myself over the Moon by my bootstraps and say look what I've accomplished and look what I did but if I can get in a spot where I'm so surrendered to him and maybe sometimes we say oh God please don't make me do that God please don't make me say that but he's leading us and he's moving then we say well God it's you and Lord even if it's hard sometimes there's times as pastors we sit and counsel people and you know what they want you to tell them but you can't tell them that because it's contrary to the word and knowing that they might get mad and walk off and leave the church I've had people they want you to tell them that they can get remarried and all these things and marriage and divorce situations and if you don't tell it to him they're going to go find somebody that'll tell it to him but you have to stay with the word and people think oh you're so cruel no I'm just doing my best to stay with the truth and it's hard the decisions we have to make sometimes as Pastor Brothers people don't realize as we were talking about last night about covet and different things and decisions that you have to make knowing there'll be people sitting there that absolutely disagree and knowing no matter what you do you're up against the situation there's going to be somebody that disagrees with it no matter what you do so you just do what the biggest tithepayer says right no now you have to follow the leading of the Lord you have to get to a spot where you say God this may not be popular this may not be received well but I know this is the direction that you're leading and then you can sit back and say it was you Lord so I put it in your hands there's things many times I wish that I could say I wish that I could just come out and just take it under control and say well bless God this is the way it's going to be and I wish sometimes I can just take a situation and just straighten it all out and say here it is but God if God didn't call you to do that you be careful you'll be like that man that reached out and said all the ark's fall and I'm going to reach and grab it and fix this situation and it got him in a lot of trouble yet with good intentions but contrary to the word of God I want to look at this scripture this is during the Last Supper the scripture we read it you know at the communion Services over and over many times scriptures like that that we read a lot it just becomes common to us and we lose the depth of what it's really saying but Saint John Chapter 13 Verse 3 it said Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God I asked our church recently if this verse if this was said about you if this was written up here and Nathan knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and then he was come from God and went to God what would the next part of this verse say about us what would the next verse say if God had given all things into our hands and we had power to do what we want to do what would the next verse say would we Smite our enemies blind or or or would we run somebody out of the church or or would we go heal somebody that we wanted to see healed or what would we do but look what he does knowing this knowing that all things had been given into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself knowing that he had absolute power and authority he humbles himself and he gets down on his knees and he begins to wash the feet of disciples and I want to say they hadn't been to Bed Bath and Beyond or Bath and Body Works or whatever it is and got him some nice lotions for their feet their feet didn't smell nice their their feet hadn't been bathed and manicured that stinking fisherman they didn't have nice paved roads they were out there on mud roads they didn't have a they didn't have Teslas or Fords they had some old uh donkeys that they didn't fill them up at the gas station but they might empty out there on the road and they walked on those roads and they put their feet in that water sometimes the sisters you know it's Brothers at church the sisters go down and watch feet first in the basement there and then the brothers come down and sometimes you can tell a sister had a new pair of stockings because they're just lint floating all in that tub I think well at least it's not donkey manure didn't say they had 12 basins there where every disciple got a fresh Basin of water that 12th disciples said oh Lord and we we think something oh I don't want to watch this brother's feet or that sister's feet and the King of Kings and the Lord of lords knowing that he came from God and knowing that he was going back to God and that all things had been given unto him he kneels down and he begins to wash the feet of the disciples why because he was the right kind of leader he wasn't leading by saying now you go do this and you go do this and you go do that and I'm going to lead from behind like a lot of these so-called leaders but he led by example that he said I've given you an example that as I've done to you you also ought to do to one another I know he was talking about washing feet but I don't believe he was just talking about that he said the perfect example of how we should treat one another how we should love one another how we should pray for one another how we should be long-suffering with one another he set an example that we should be that same type of Christians knowing that he had this power and he humbles himself to be a servant God help us God help us again perfect strength by Perfect weakness we've got to get ourselves and our abilities out of the way and surrendered to the will and power of God say well brother I can preach he can't use that as long as you can preach that's sort of I can do this I can do that you can't do nothing amen well then God can't use it but if you yield yourself to God and let him do you know I'm a teacher well as long as you're the teacher why he won't get very far what is it it's the Holy Spirit doing those things brother Banner would say it this way to a group of preachers there at the Tabernacle one time they're having a little meeting and he's answering some of their questions and he said Brothers he said if you've really been anointed he said then you never preached a sermon in your life he didn't mean that away the way that some message folks would take it today oh they had got up behind a Pulpit and they had preached but it wasn't them that was doing the talking it was the Holy Spirit anointing them again perfect strength by Perfect weakness so as long as we're trying on ourselves and depending on our own ability and so forth while we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us remember he would save that man he said that that preacher got up before the Pentecostal preacher and began to use all these great swelling words and things and he said he realized it wasn't going over with the people and he said he came down off the platform with his head down and his shoulder slumped and a man sitting in front of brother Brandon turned around and said if he would have went up the way he came down he would have came down the way he went up you see the Way Up Is Down First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 . Saint Paul says and I came and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God now if Peter had said this we'd say well yeah we know Peter you don't have the ability but see Paul had the human ability to be able to do that he could have got up and preached a great sermonette and brother Branham said we're getting tired of sermonettes by preacherettes and all that you know and and he said oh he could have he could Paul could have got up and said these things he had great swelling words and he had wisdom and he had the speech and the vocabulary and the knowledge of multiple languages and things but he he didn't use that when he came to tell him the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling when we think of an evangelist to invite those are the three qualities that we automatically think of right I want a guy that's going to come in weakness and in fear and in trembling this is how Paul came to them why because he wasn't depending on Paul's ability and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the power of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God my desire is that people would not look and say oh my what a great something brother Nathan oh look how he can memorize look how he can do this without my desire would be that when I leave a meeting whether it be back at home or out like this that somebody would say I know that wasn't that man I know that man didn't know those things about me I know that man didn't know what I needed so I know that that wasn't that man then I don't get the glory but he gets the glory that your faith doesn't Rest In the Flesh of a man because let me tell you if you place I've seen Brothers you know we place it off in the Catholic Church sir we place it off in the denominations but there's men right around the message that they begin to place their their their trust and their confidence in the arm of Flesh and they begin to lean on other brothers and then when that brother fails or it leaves the message or makes a mistake or disappoints them or discourages them then their whole spiritual walk is just devastated because they were looking to the Flesh of a man instead of looking to Jesus Christ I've had people come to me and say brother Nathan we were baptized by brother so and so he doesn't even believe the message anymore or we were married by brother so and so on he he fell into sin out here should we go be re-baptized again or should we go get remarried again I asked him well was she baptized in that man's name no I was baptized in Jesus name well then that man didn't have anything to do with it he was just standing there when it happened did you marry that brother no he just read some vows over me and my wife then it had nothing to do it was not a union with that man it was a union between you and your bride when you got saved in that man's meeting did he save you no Jesus saved me well then it wasn't him and you he was just creating an atmosphere that you happen to get hatched out under oh I got the Holy Ghost and brothers so-and-so's meeting and he's an atheist now well can you imagine being in the upper room 120 of them sitting there and you lean over here hey brother how did you hear about this well I'm a little ashamed to say it but Judas came by our village one day and signs and wonders was following as a Ministry and I never heard anything like that before and it got my attention and that's how I got here hey God used a god used an old donkey to speak through one time that donkey didn't even have a soul but we put God in a box you've got to come this way Lord you got to do it this way and do that way hey I I'll just be a little transparent here this morning we're working to a close I promise give me about five more minutes and we'll that's our estimated time of departure ah I'm not a big Joel Osteen fan I'll be honest I'm not in his fan club but but I I used to you know be a little derogatory in things and say you know different things but we got a family at our church that they had they'd been raised in the message and they went way out in the world way out in the world and they begin to visit our church because their daughters have began to get into some trouble and they wanted to get them around good Christian friends and their plan was just we were just going to drop them off and then we're going to go do our own worldly thing and and the man would sit in the back of the the congregation the song service tears would be begin to run down his cheek and think what Earth am I crying and God began to get a hold of their life and begin to turn him around but prior to that they'd been in a situation in their marriage where they they had almost got divorced several times and things that got bad and he'd left the house several times and and stayed away and then he'd come back sometimes and she'd tell him you can come back but you're sleeping on the couch in the basement and and that their marriage was in a bad place and he went down to Texas with a worldly co-worker and they began to work at a job that they were Contracting at down there and the guy said hey I'm just going to go over this Joel Osteen guys church and check it out and the man got saved at Joel's team's Church and the man came back to Louisville Kentucky and he began to go to eat at him they've branched out into some other things but but anyhow this man began to attend that church and when there when when the couple from our church before they started attending our church and their marriage was almost just completely devastated and they they left each other the man left the house and he said I'm done I just give up this man who'd been saved at Joel Osteen's Church begged him said will you please just let me sit down and talk to you and her and he began to talk to him he said can't you see how much that she's hurting and that she just doesn't understand you and you just don't understand her and he began to work with them and got their marriage restored didn't come the way I would have planned it didn't come the way I expected it didn't come the way I would have chose it but God can use whatever he wants to use [Applause] brother banham had a friend there in New Albany near where our church is at at Main Street Methodist church he called him brother Johnson he was a Methodist preacher he said brother Johnson when he's witnessing to somebody and and they want to get baptized he said well go down to my friend Billy he'll drown you and then he said when I'm witnessing somebody and they said well I was raised Methodist and I want to go to Methodist Church he said I sent him down to brother Johnson say it's a little dry down there not a whole lot of water but you can go on down there you mean a prophet of God would do that look at the example of our Lord Jesus everybody couldn't be a Peter he didn't hand the keys to the kingdom to everybody but there were 10 lepers one time and he healed all 10 of them knowing that only one was going to come back and he was going to be able to help him further but he helped the other ones as far as they would let him help them I wonder if that's our attitude or if we say well if you'll come this way and you'll do it this way and you'll do that then we'll have you I want to help anybody I can just as far as they'll let me help them yeah there's people in our area that'll probably never sit at our church maybe never sit under my Ministry but there's been times maybe three or four o'clock in the morning get a phone call brother Nathan please pray my son or my daughter has run away from home I could say hey you don't go to our church that'd really be the spirit of Christ wouldn't it hey you don't even believe like me but I go to prayer for him why because that same spirit that was in Christ compels me I'll help you just as far as you'll let me help you second Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 7 and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buff at me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness you realize this is one of the great things that separated Judas from the rest of the Depo of the Apostles brother random said that that where Judas lost out was at Pentecost yeah but Jesus didn't even make it to Pentecost so we think well how does that even make sense but see Judas got to a spot he he I just read it to the church Wednesday night if you go back and read the Bible it actually says that when Judas realized what he had done he came and repented anybody know that Judas repented and I looked at that word and I thought surely to goodness brother Duane that can't be the same word that's used in Acts 2 38 so I looked it up and it's two different Greek words and one is brother random talks about is a change of heart a change of mind a changing of directions that's what happened on the day of Pentecost but the other is that after the fact they regret what they did and they're sorry for it and that's where I think a lot of people don't get to the Holy Ghost they come to an altar and they say I'm sorry for what I did yesterday Lord and I'll probably do the same thing again tomorrow but here I am I'm repenting come on brother it's real good and Judas regretted what he did but he was going to be Judas the next day he didn't want to he loved Judas too much to change Judas and he didn't think that that his grace was sufficient to be able to forgive a guy like him he didn't think there was enough Grace to forgive what he had done but Peter denied him three times and he said go tell my disciples and Peter Paul prays three times God take this thing from me and he didn't say okay Paul because you asked I'm just going to take it away he said my grace is sufficient I want to say this morning his grace is sufficient for whatever you're going through his grace is sufficient to cover your past his grace is sufficient his grace has made a way back for you this morning his grace provided a way back to Calvary for us my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me that man there they said was it his sin or his daddy's or his mommies they wanted to figure out who was to blame and Jesus said it wasn't none of that it was that God could be the glory of God could be made manifest many times in our life we go through things I've had people come to me and and come and sit in our church maybe move from other areas or come from other churches and things and and they said brother I feel like I've wasted the last 12 years of my life because things didn't wind up exactly the way they had planned at their old church I said you didn't waste your time the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord the Lord has to bring us my dad was raised Pentecostal and then he backslid and then he married a Methodist girl and they went to a Methodist church and then he started going to the Pentecostal church and then they came to the message why didn't God just bypass all that and just bring him to the message you think those years were wasted no God Was preparing them and bringing them along and taking them from truth to truth because that's what the Holy Spirit promised he do he'd lead us and guide us into all truth and there's some people that couldn't have just received this right away God had to kind of ease him into it there are some people that maybe they could have received it but they had to meet people along their way that they could be a help to once they saw the truth God knows what he's doing these things aren't always our choice but God's choice is exactly right let me read you this last quote musicians if you'd come we'll close this morning again perfect strength by Perfect weakness God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them that's what God is doing in this age if you're full of yourself if you're full of doctrines or full of ideas or full of your own ability he can't use you but when you get so empty that God I'm sick of it all I'm sick of my own thoughts I'm sick of my own failures I'm sick of my own opinions I'm sick of my own ideas it always winds up wrong I wind up like Moses out there trying to take things in my own hands but God I'm so sick of it I want to lay it all here and just leave it and I want to empty out so much that then you can come in then God can do something with you his strategy is to take empty-human vessels and shake the world with them that's Bower heads this morning wonder how many slip up your hands say brother Nathan I don't want it to be me I know there's nothing in me that's good but help me to be that kind of vessel that you're talking about this morning help me Lord let me empty so completely out that he could come and fill me so that he could do something through me God there's people at my at my work there's people at my school there's people in my family that they need to see the truth Lord how will they see it if they don't see it in me maybe they'll never pick up a Bible maybe they'll never attend the message church but God may they see a little bit of Jesus in me hands all over the building the Lord sees each one let's go to prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus so many times Lord we we get so educated even of things that are truth if we're not careful it begins to be about us and what we know and what we can do but God help us help us Lord to stay humble help us to realize it's not within us it's not our ability it's not within our power it's not within our grasp but it's only what you can do if we'll empty ourselves up so that you can do something through us help us to conquer that thought of human ability that Lord we we get to a spot where we recognize lord it's not us it wasn't because we were better than the Baptist or better than the Methodist or better than the Catholic it wasn't because we were smarter than the Presbyterian or The Seventh-Day Adventist or the Jehovah Witness but lord it's just because you chose us it was just your choosing there were people in our area that were better than me they had a better record they had a better history than me God you could have chose them God but you chose me what can I say except thank you Jesus for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you that you'd look down on me and you look beyond my faults and see that there was a need there that there was there was a predestinated seat as you had need to go by Samaria Lord you had need to go by these other places and pick us up maybe you found some on a bar stool may you maybe you found some in an alley Lord somewhere all muddled up maybe you found them on a denominational Pew or maybe you found him in a message Church all confused by false Doctrine Lord wherever it was Lord I'm so thankful that you reached down your hand and found us so then what can the clay say oh my look what a what a beautiful vase I've made myself into it wasn't us it was just the gentle hand of the Potter taking us back to the wheel and molding us and shaping us into what he had seen in his eyes into what his choice for us would be help us Lord may we may we be flexible that the Potter can mold us into his image into what he saw this as brother random would say there God had an image of you in his mind before the foundation of the world God may we step into that image of what she'd have us to be may we step into the calling you'd have for us not just to pastors and evangelists and and teachers Lord but to the housewife to the mechanic to the plumber to the carpenter to whatever it be Lord to the computer programmer or whatever it would be father may they find their place in the body that they have a part to do they can come and pull on the gift in a man's life they can come and raise their hands and worship you and create an atmosphere that when the minister steps to the platform they'll be such a presence of the Holy Spirit and such an atmosphere of the Lord that it just makes it so easy for him to step into a channel and begin to use their part of the body God help us may we not fight against each other may we not be fighting against those that are packing the ball but may we get behind it and support it the Lord these brothers that are represented here Lord bless their churches Lord and may their churches get behind them and support them and and instead of trying to be contentious or or trying to question and tear down everything they do may they catch a vision of Lord the the desire in that man's heart and and Lord the motives and the objectives that he has for the kingdom of God and may they get behind it and support it with their prayers and their tithes and their offerings and every ability that they have to put behind it Lord may we work together as a body may we not be some disjointed confused something but Lord may we work together for the kingdom of God help us Jesus Let each one do their part Lord and then may they not look at the other and try to judge their part by theirs and compare one to another may we not get a spirit of jealousy Upon Us Lord but may we say thank you God for my brother thank you for my sister Lord if you're using them in that way Lord maybe you couldn't use me in that way but thank you for it God bless them continue to bless them thank you Lord and if they're down or they're discouraged Lord help us not to push them down further but Lord help us to grieve when they grieve and help us to encourage them when they need encouragement help us father to do our part Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you love him amen isn't he good to us let's sing this [Music] amen this is my testimony I'm Amazing Grace [Music] shall always be my song of praise foreign [Music] thank you Lord all he loves Beyond beyond all my foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my soul oh he loves Beyond [Music] all my faults standing singing to him this morning and worshiping with all your heart [Music] massage calories [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] one more time together [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the empty and broken I came back [Music] of their soul unworthy [Music] Souls God blessing God I'm not despair he saw it over again [Music] God bless Ed day [Music] [Music] and it's warmth just give [Music] the power me [Music] that's how we watch me oh I like this but when I stumbledore my Soul brain [Music] s aren't you glad that it's over and over and over and over me fashion I am today because Jesus [Music] he's still working on me to make me wanna ought to be true oh he's just working on me to make me wanna be the Sun and the Earth [Music] [Music] questions that I see makes me wonder why he never gave up on me but he loves me as I am and helps me when I pray remember he's the father of all singing he says [Music] [Music] the Sun and the Earth oh how have you made me it's Jesus on the inside working till the outside making a difference in my life always Jesus on the inside [Music] oh in my life is Jesus Oh is Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] Christopher yes it's Jesus this is why this is my face size size [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] supposed to be outside when I think about the Lord how he saved me how he raised me how he feel me with the Holy Ghost how is here me to the other animals when I think [Music] have you picked me up [Music] thank you Jesus you're easy [Music] thank you Jesus when I think when I think oh thank you Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] all the praise [Music] you know I is here this weekend I was out mowing the grass as well wasn't pushing it riding it but you know just something struck in a way with the brand said when John he said what John looked and saw John saw himself he saw his representation John said I see me you know that's a reality when we see our name it's not a name that's wrote out here in the scripture but we see the very character of the word of Christ himself being made manifest and it just resonates and identifies right here [Music] and just like John the prophet said when you have heard this message you've left the other thing and it has become Eagle food to you then heard from your theophany what is that I looked and seen me my representation and that's what the word of God continues to Hold Up Before You and I there's only one thing that can divide and separate you from you and that's him because that part that he placed in you and I that's really him that's really him and just like you can look down pictures and begin to see oh I got Mama's nose or I got Daddy's ears or I got this stature this or that but you know when we look in this time that we're living in and we see our lives it's the same Jesus Christ being made manifest in our lives and there's certain things you can see in pictures now that you might have said oh I don't want Daddy's nose or I don't want Mama's ears but you just give time and certain things begin to show up and that's the same way it is within our life the Bible said grow in Grace and we continue to yield to him it's God bringing out that choice his choice on the inside oh God is so good it's all about us yielding and getting out of the way we we want the man of God we want the minister to stand here and yield and get out of the way and that's the same way that when we're listening to the word in every moment of our life God help me to get out of the way because just as a minister could stand here in their things that God sometimes will keep from him that he'll say when he's standing right here sometimes it'll keep pressing like brother Nathan had said and then there's other times where he's studying on things oh God he's praying God give me Grace give me Grace the whole thing within it is to yield and I'll tell you to me those are examples when God would allow that even for his ministers and the prophet to set that before us that's not just for the prophet it's not just for the ministry it's God himself letting you and I see the Simplicity that he's called us to there's things that all there's everything we have to do is yield and say God help me to get out of the way and you know what you know what brings us to that we can't do that on our own self it's the word of God delivered by the spirit of God and he's drawing us to that place of submission it's not a demand it's not a command it's not a dictatorship it's the love of God taking hold upon the children of God oh how precious is our lovely Lord Jesus amen he's so wonderful he's so wonderful to us so good to us what what a word that we have received from the Lord amen and I'll tell you friends listen when God delivers a word when he delivers it it's not just something that we take in this very moment but I'm going to tell you you take that word and you're going to be tested on the word you receive but I want you to remember you're not standing alone remember the example he gave about somebody coming to my doorstep and wanting to pick on my boys I got some double Barrels in there too you come we're going to go to war but I want you to remember you're not alone I don't care how you feel you're not alone he said he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and that word that he's given stand on that word you say Satan you you might have had me on that before I might have been entertained that before but too late my father spoke to me there's a word that's delivered you have no power over that in my mind or my spirit anymore God is so good so good I just feel good [Music] it's feel good God is so good so good oh my my I tell you the joy of the Lord is certainly our strength amen I I want to say is brother Nathan he mentioned that about brother Roy and uh you know brother Roy is such a such a veteran brother Roy Shrewsbury that went on home to be with the Lord and I think about when my wife and I we got married and you know we as soon as we got married then the next on that Sunday we were there went to be there in in Beckley and that morning brother Roy you know it spoke to us and then he wanted to take us out to lunch and have some time there with us and things and brother Roy just to me just such a an ambassador a representative of this message and always to me my wife and I were talking on the way to church she said brother Roy she said there's just one word you can always think about and I know there's many but a man of integrity and I know maybe some of you didn't get a chance to meet brother Roy Shrewsbury but I really really appreciate brother Roy and I know different ones brother Wayne you preached their regular almost every month for so long many different things and but you know another soldiers went on home to the reward [Music] and how we thank God for the faithfulness and I wanted to say that you know I if it had been I think brother Ray had pointed out here it was because I was asking about ministers and I get in trouble and I start calling out brothers and y'all have to forgive me sometimes I overlook different ones you know I don't mean to do anything like that but even with brother Daniel sitting right there here I am looking right over but I sat down there and I thought here was brother Jim shumi and I tell you I really love brother Jim sister shumate just real real good friends and I appreciate brother Jim there's a lot that I've I've told him this over the years I appreciate his stand and how that God gave him such Grace and holding things together and I just love him amen we're just it just it's just good to be a part of the family of God and I don't know I'm glad that God's have got a variety aren't you I'm glad that he didn't make everybody like me because I can't even put up with me but I'm glad that God's a god of variety aren't you amen it sounds like somebody I was really saying Amen on that one God bless you so much amen I we just want to invite you or the address out there to Mill Hollow where we're going to have the fellowship dinner at shelter number one the address is on the bulletin board brother Richard's going to be standing in the lobby for the whole service the rest of the service and he's going to hold it with two hands that's Brother Richard Sanchez no take a picture of it if you need to for the address I'm just teasing him brother Jim would you come and dismiss us in a word of prayer amen and it's just been good to be here in the house of the Lord I believe God has done many things right here in this service I believe that because you the word can't be spoken and it not take effect it will find and hit the mark sometimes it isn't what we see but God is moving the Bible said the kingdom of God cometh without observation you know God works in such a precise way and you know what he was doing here once again this morning is Jehovah Jireh the same God that provided the RAM on the mountain the same God that provided the squirrels in the woods and even I love how brother Brandon would go in and be so transparent he said I'm you know I'll use the word radical he said I'm going to call for a squirrel to come out of this because there ain't no way that a squirrel is going to come out of this what do you see brother Samuel I see my own life that's what I see who would have thought a Son of God coming out of here a daughter of God coming out of there but what brought us out the word the word has brought us out oh my what is it Jehovah Jireh providing for himself I couldn't help myself but God provided to lead you and I out into full Victory don't you love him this morning amen he has been so good to us brother Jim come and dismiss us in a word of prayer amen God bless you so good to have you [Music] bless you just bow our heads just this afternoon you know his brother Samuel worried about [Music] missing somebody but I look out here and I wouldn't want to miss one of these faces out here the body of Christ and I don't know a lot of your names I may have never met you but I feel so privileged to be a part of the body of Christ and it's uh that has seen the word of God in this hour so many people can't see it what a privileged people we are to see it I want to thank you for that for the word that we heard today that each one of us take it and apply it to our lives amen let's just bow our heads and thank you for the service to the heavenly father Lord God we just want to thank you for allowing us to be a part of this meeting here today Lord God but greater than that we want to thank you Lord God for allowing us to be a part of this last day message Lord this word of God Amen that's drawn us out of a world Lord God Amen to the truth of this hour father we just thank you and praise you for it Lord we pray Lord God we'll take what we've heard today Lord God when the devil would try to discourage us Lord God brother Samuel said Lord God help us to look and see what he's done for us what he's brought out of this old flesh Lord God Amen how that seed of God has been quickened by a word in this hour and the Holy Spirit is drawn it to Perfection father we pray Lord God as you just be with us throughout this day and the fellowship we find here among brothers and sisters of like Faith father we pray Lord God that you just bless our coming together Lord God
