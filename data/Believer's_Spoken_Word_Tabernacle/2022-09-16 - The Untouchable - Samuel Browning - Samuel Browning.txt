your testimony like you it's just so precious amen amen thank god for his mercy once again amen just you know i'll probably say i'll say more on sunday but just want to say for those are there streaming and those that be there just my goodness what a what a display of the love of god yesterday and i just i keep on going back when brother brennan makes a statement mighty god unveiled before us and to me it's a very big statement it takes us to the story of where the little boy was stormy weather his mother came up and began to assure him you know we're christians and so forth but he said mom in this kind of a time i need god with skin and i i believe that's the reality of the son of man in bridefort it's god with skin it's what it is it ought it all comes down to because with all of the mysteries and the opening all of those of the seals coming off of the book is so that we might see ourselves our position and come into that in christ and then it's lived out what is it it's christ it's jesus christ living that same life through your life through my life all of those avenues and all those different ones that we would touch and come in contact with i believe that because this gospel is not it's not a complex gospel man's made it complicated but it's simple i just i know there was just hearing different comments and reports and different ones that you know that were outside of the family or maybe was connected and they're they're seeing that display of love but we didn't do it for a display we did it because we love them and we love god's people and i just want to say thank you for all of those that come together to make that day possible knowing that was that'll not not only would be a difficult day but you know just something was so it was so precious you know i had different brothers praying and um to see how the holy spirit and all of us were praying but you know right there from the very beginning of that service yesterday he came he came and that's what made the difference he came in the room and we just so thank god for that and he's we want to continue to remember the walker family in prayer because every day and moment by moment just when as i mentioned to him at the very beginning i said we just don't we can't think a day we can't think a day ahead we just have to ask god for grace for this moment we just need strength from this moment this minute we'll get to the next minute when he gets here we'll get to the next hour but we need grace for just right now we we can't look ahead and i'm glad that god gives sufficient grace aren't you amen so we just just know that even now that even as we go forward in that um with the walker family and just continuing just to reach out and love amen to reach out to them and just to encourage them and to check on them will we do that amen let's continue to do that amen also remember i just when i spoke with sister michelle yesterday uh brother bobby had been telling me you know he was getting better and and we had even had prayer for him here last thursday night and and he is he's doing he's doing much better we want to continue to keep him in prayer sister linda when i mentioned to you last thursday my aunt linda she was supposed to go remember i said to therapy from the hospital they sent her straight home on friday morning and so we just thank god for that that probably had more to do with insurance but we'd still thank god for that anybody would rather be at home you know than being at the hospital and somebody say hey hey hey excuse me are you resting well i was but uh we so we thank god for that she thanks you for for your prayers and so we just have been in communication with her there also remember brother joseph and sister ethelene in prayer i don't know if i had mentioned to you but a couple weeks ago or maybe as a week and a half ago my times are all over the place on this but sister ethelene had to go to a funeral in south carolina did i mention this to you or she got in a bad accident so on the way back so on the way home uh coming home from that uh funeral where she had to go to in south carolina for one of her uncles and really she was very close to him well she went drove by herself well on the way home she fell asleep next thing she knows her car's airborne and she wakes up so it's the grace of god that there's quite a bit of damage on the vehicle she was able to make it home and um and so we just want to remember continue to remember her in prayer as well i don't know why it wasn't maybe it was when we had that service change or whatever more but that's why i have my wife helping me with even certain things and that wasn't even about this but i i need all of you to remind me that's why when somebody tells me hey brother simon i said just text me because if i don't put a reminder on the phone it's out of sight out of mind not really but i feel that way so don't ever think that your need or whatever is not important it's important it's important and know this that though it may slip my mind it never slips god's mind never slips his mind so also this coming sunday lord willing we plan on having the fire pit fellowship out here just just to get around just the fire fellowship testimonies seeing to have a little bit of time uh let's pray that the lord will just bless us with good weather and so i think that's it with announcements i want to say god bless you paul and musicians and my just wonderful atmosphere to walk into don't you love the lord amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer and as we're just preparing to look into the word of the lord heavenly father lord we're so thankful tonight lord that we can lord truly be able to stand here lord by the grace of god and lord knowing that lord that truly lord you are our comfort lord you're our strength lord and we remember oh god lord continually lord the walker family lord that you would continue to lord minister to them lord the extended family that you'll just continue to minister strength and healing to them lord i pray that oh god that lord for these other requests we give you praise and thanks lord for how that you are moving lord and have moved and kept your hand upon hearts and lives and we just ask oh god that you'll continue to move for every request lord those that were written tonight those that i mentioned those that were unspoken lord may you just move lord thoughts and questions lord that are upon hearts lord we ask that you'll just move in a special way lord oh god we know that lord that you are more than enough lord to move for each and every need now lord we commit ourselves to you and ask that you would guide us lord as we look into your word tonight lord god what you've placed on my heart i'm asking that you'll help me to get out of the way that's the request that i have lord so that you can just speak lord to us what it is lord that you desire to speak lord and come and change our lives come minister to every need that's gathered here those that are stream or archive it lord may you just lord just direct the word right to the mark lord and whatever the need would be lord spiritually physically may you just have your way we pray father and all things lord receive glory we ask in the name of jesus christ amen and amen i'd like to read in job chapter 1 job chapter 1. and i'm just going to read two verses of scripture and we'll let you have your seats boy i hear all those bibles turning if you have your phone use your phone or your tablet i know some people get sticky about that but it's all the bible it's all the bible it doesn't matter if it's on your ipad or your phone and and i get it i like my bible at home that i study out of i write i write notes in it i write i do all my i write cross references of things that as i'm going through it you know i i like my bible but i i get it so we just were able to do that so don't think you won't ever offend me or whatever i'm not you you know me by now i'm not like that like oh we're gonna throw you in the message prison because you're using a phone for you know here uh we're gonna exile you because you're using a phone to look up the scriptures now job chapter one verse nine then satan answered the lord and said doth job feared god for not past thou hast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated would you turn also right to the next chapter job chapter 2 and what we're just referring to is where here was a council sons of god come to present themselves for the lord and satan came also and hear that remember it was a testimony that was going on in heaven job wasn't aware of it and it was where that satan already knew this about job but here in remember in verse 10 satan points out to god what we just read for our text that i can't get to him i can't get to anything about his life i can't get to anything physically matter of fact satan says i can't even harm a blade of grass on his property are you hearing me he said bill samuel doesn't say that it does say that because the first petition is let me affect his environment what's around him and so that's where god had said or satan had said i i you know you've got a hedge around him that's why i can't do it and you know so then in verse 4 of job chapter 2 let me just go straight for there this is where that satan is is come after you know job's sons have been taken and daughters and where you know all of the livestock and everything that's all around servants all of those things have been taken and satan here is once again requesting and says in verse 4 skin for skin yea all that a man hath he will give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life so now satan's received permission to come against job's body see when we understand this satan has to receive permission from god if there's anything that when we see the reality of election and predestination i'm not going to go so heavy upon that part tonight but you can't preach the gospel without preaching predestination and election because the gospel is the message of redemption that is sent from the mind of god to claim those thoughts sons and daughters of god that god had in his mind and his wrote in the lamb's book of life so that's the whole purpose of the gospel but thanks be to god that for there are many others that are not in the plan of redemption but they receive salvation are you hearing me because there is the lamb section of the book of life and then there is the book of life so the lamb section that the lamb section if we can put it in this way the lamb section would be like if i could give an example would be like my children they're my children they they have come from my loins but then the book of life would be like your children i love your children now don't don't go don't misread i'm just trying to give you an example don't say oh you're saying my children the book of life that's not what i'm saying i'm giving an example that my children that come out of my loins they would be that which is the example of the lamb's book of life they've come to express me they they're not going to look like you uh they're going to look like me they're going to have attributes and those expressions of me but you know what your children i would love your children right i love your children and that's that's god the children of god of that of the election is that which was in god before the foundation of the world but because of the fall then the book of life comes into view and in the book of life there will be many that not in the bride but will receive salvation is that right and so that clarity is so set before us because even we can see how brother branham had to address that so but i want to just kind of track back to the point when we're looking at election and predestination that to recognize that satan it's you're not here by chance tonight it's not whoo i got lucky today there's no such thing as luck we are here by design election makes it clear it makes it sure that satan cannot touch anything unless he first gets permission from god not even a blade of grass on your property satan had to go get permission let me touch his livestock let me touch let me touch his dog let me touch his day he had to get permission first of everything that is connected with job and satan has to get permission and he asked that the hedge would be removed so he could touch his surroundings and then he asked to touch the hedge that was regarding his job's physical body and that hedge that was but there was a hedge around job's life satan could only go so far with whatever you know we know it was boils that he that that he came that came upon his body but it wouldn't matter what it was you could take the most deadliest of disease and satan could say i'm going to come at job with this deadly disease but if god has said you can't touch his life it can only go so far and god said that's far enough hallelujah so you know and and the thing of it is as far as our physical life which is this life or the life that we have and god has said you can't touch his life that cannot be touched until the purpose of god has been served or fulfilled and i want to speak tonight on the untouchable the untouchable you see when we look at this satan has given permission to touch he has to get permission to even touch the part of us that is touchable there is a part of us that's touchable that's our flesh it's our mind that's her spirit that's touchable but he still has to get permission he has to get permission of all of our surroundings he had to get permission remember because and i think of and it's not just ministers sometimes the way satan will work i find a lot of times within ministry but you know you you find it how satan if he can't come maybe directly at you or he's not coming at you he gets permission let me touch their child remember sister rebecca the condition as a little girl that she had and that condition where it just couldn't keep anything down it was just the sickness and finally as it as god made it known to his prophet remember brother braham stops the car takes her out and he prays for and never again did she suffer from that see god had permitted that and it was satan that it touched some of his surroundings so sometimes it isn't even satan coming at us as far as in our flesh or in our mind or in our spirit but he'll ask let me touch their surroundings because he believes that if i can do something to affect them i can get them off track i can move them off track but let me say this i i've been mentioning this just as it's burning on my heart god's purpose can't be defeated we might get off track somewhere but there is the grace of god to bring us back on track and grace is given for us to say lord help me and to teach me lord because to realize as long as we're in this life there's going to be times where our surroundings are touched so he can come in any of those areas those are touchable areas but he has to get permission but once the soul is sealed it's an untouchable part let me just say this until a life even is made ready to go soul hasn't been sealed but until that life is made ready to go in the economy of god i don't care how many devils want to come against it it cannot take it until it's ready to go it can't happen because god is in control of it all and god's got a purpose you and i can't always understand or see the purpose in some things sometimes the purpose itself we we we look at purposes and we look at achievement sometimes even in longevity of life sometimes we look at longevity of life or if i can get to retirement and that's an achievement there is an achievement in that but that isn't that in itself is is is is uh subject to the eternal purpose and that is the eternal purpose is serving god's purpose to be filled with the spirit of god and then that life to operate through you and i the purpose that he's called us here for there's a reason there's a reason for all of it i just just trying to go very slow with this so there's a reality let me just deal with that untouchable part the reality that untouchable part is the real you that seed of god that satan wanted there was something about your life that even from the beginning that satan could seek after it to try to destroy it even when he knew what was coming on with moses he sought to destroy and he just said i don't know which one it is we'll just swipe them all out it would have looked like oh my goodness how are they going to make it he just made a blanket statement and we'll just wipe every israelite baby out but it just goes to show god's got a purpose and god himself his purpose will not be defeated but god allowed it to be displayed that in the midst of it all that here moses comes forth in the time of the lord jesus we already knew when you and i can look back and see the prophecies that were already spoken regarding his life and how that their things have transitioned down in egypt and so forth and what was spoken jeremiah regarding rama all of those things that was speaking of that but yet when it came to be notice there was one that was present herod and he was moved at that moment we here a spirit of jealousy just comes upon him and he says there's nobody going to be king but me and here comes another blanket statement just kill all of them from i can't remember the age was it three years and down or two years and down okay so don't don't don't put me out yet two years in doubt i just don't remember that point but at any rate you know this you know that's always the point that also uh validates and puts forth he wasn't a baby when the when the wise men came to him because because the the the description was to put it that it's got to at least be two years old and down when when did this appear to you so when you look at a blanket statement we would look at it and say oh my goodness how is it going to make it now that would be you or i sometimes we don't feel like we're going to make it but let me just assure you you're going to make it there is nothing that can take you or touch you until god's purpose has been fulfilled nothing there's an untouchable part of you and that's that seed of god that gene of god that son and daughter of god that came predestinated from the mind of almighty god that's a part of him it's a part of the word there is a part to be expressed when the bible says he gave unto them power to become the sons of god that phrase become means to come to pass and you were a part of the prophecy that was to come to pass that seed in you is a part of the word that is to come to pass so when the holy spirit has come to your life what is it it's god bringing his word to pass hallelujah so here all of this with the holy spirit moving and directing our lives this is why in job 14 5 it says concerning man who's born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has to point at his bounds that he cannot pass i emphasize that the number of his months are with thee with who the lord there's no bartering on that there's no altering on that satan can't say let me just remove a few days in a few months he cannot bark or barter on that god's got a purpose that is to be fulfilled and nothing can thwart that purpose his months are with me thou has to point in his bounds that he cannot pass hallelujah turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as a hireling his day in psalms 34 7 you make maybe just let me read and refer to these places i know we're so you i'm and i'm used to everything moving that's one of the reasons i had them do the scriptures on here i said because on the midweek services i want to move but you can write them down psalms 34 7 the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them deliberate ongoing the ongoing delivereth them there's things that you and i have been delivered of no doubt today we're not even aware of it sometimes there's things that can come to your attention and somebody can bring it to your attention say oh you were driving this car like this you didn't want anyone aware of this you were driving this fast and your tie rod was like this tell me somebody because i know i'm preaching i've got some people right here that have told me those testimonies and there's other times that we don't even realize it but it's god delivering us it's not because we're better than nobody else because he can sit in the same church and god delivered you from being in an accident and somebody else was in an accident it isn't god loves one more and one less but god's got a purpose because there's maybe for one hey there's something you need to go do and take care of and god will have somebody else to be a testimony in the midst of it to say that you know what no matter what comes or goes god is still worthy of all my praise the counsel of god is beyond you and i figured out our understanding and putting everything together but i'm just glad that we can just trust him psalms 34 19 many aren't the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all ongoing delivereth them out of him all oh my this is why brother braham said after you get past 25 years old i'm 46 how are you 29 how are you don't worry sisters i ain't going to my 24 38 he said 34. you say 34 others said 25 i'm going to say jesus forgive him once you get that's 25 years old death sets in wrinkles sets in gray hairs start coming in i would be thankful for them it's going to cause death is after you and one of these days it's going to take you no matter who you are it's going to take you so death doesn't show up and say uh oh they got a good stocks we'll back off from them no debt don't care but notice no matter who you are it's going to take you you'll get in the corner here god will get you out of that corner you'll get in this corner here death will almost have you over here but after a while it'll get you but then what can death do after it takes its full toll and it's done the best it could do god brings you back in the resurrection and he removes everything that death ever set in boo devil hallelujah the only thing death can do he said it because it'll it will pull you into this corner into that corner after a while it's going to take you but that's all it can do paul would write in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 he would write in testimony to the corinthian church of letting just not bragging but let them know of everything that has has taken place in order to bring this gospel and he made this statement i was in depths plural oft i was in depth plural oft remember paul writing his conversion after he receives the holy ghost in acts chapter 9 he begins to preach the word and all of a sudden some of the of the jews were so stirred up that they wanted to kill him and they purposed in themselves we're going to kill this man that god wasn't finished so god i'm just going to say it god anointed some men to catch this same ears caught this can i preach a little bit some ears cough is that this department's getting ready to shut down you need to build bid over to this department come on and preach with me now you see sometimes we wonder about things that we're doing and fail and sometimes fail to recognize it's under the oversight of almighty god god had people catch this and move at that moment and paul was let down over a wall in a basket here's god's mighty prophet being let down over the wall in a basket but you know what that was the way of escape right it was a way of escape in that moment how was that made possible because god's purpose wasn't fulfilled and god had everything arranged just like god has it arranged that if it ain't your time to go don't worry faith is coming to bring you out of that circumstance glory be to god oh hallelujah notice paul would go on in another place here he was paul was such a loved man that when he would come to preach they greet him with stones so here he is he's being let down by basket here in paul is in another place he's drug out of the city and stoned to death now think about when he's heading to that place he knows the results from being stoned because he has held the coats of others while they did it right if there was one thing about it there were some professional stone throwers in that day too he was left for dead now you let's look at it just a moment paul could have had he could have had a right for his life to draw back and go back in a cave and say i ain't going nowhere i don't know what's out here man they might kill me the next place i go you think those thoughts didn't come you think those thoughts didn't come holy if this happens it might kill me this might take me this might this and this man all those things were all around but paul also you can read this clearly what paul writes he writes by a divine expression that when he could say oh death where is thy victory it wasn't just at that moment paul lived with that reality because he knew by being in the predestinated plan of god nothing can take me until god is finished it didn't cause him to be arrogant what it did it brought a rest it brought a rest paul could write in second corinthians chapter 1 when he writes concerning the pressure that had come to them when they were in asia in second corinthians 1 and verse 8 brethren we will not have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead now watch this what's this application paul knows that god is the one who raises the dead not because of just a historical event paul has experienced this same resurrection in his own life so paul knows that it's god who raises the dead now watch it come down into this place right here why did god raise you me who were dead in sin and trespasses because god had a purpose it wasn't that we became seed we always were seed of god and god had a purpose to raise us up and paul is cooperating by that in the midst of all of the environment and all that pulls around let me tell you it wasn't a comfortable place it was a hostile time in many of those cities think about even when paul no doubt he wanted to get out of corinth but god told him fear not stay right here i got much people in this city right there was lives that needed to be quickened by the spirit of god they had to hear that gospel trumpet sound they had to receive that word of reconciliation they had to receive that reality of the atonement that i was included in redemption and because of that reality god which raised up the dead verse 10 paul could say who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us glory be to god delivered over and over again this is why the scripture when it could say in ecclesiastes 8 8 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death brother brown says it like this i just these things are so burning on my heart here for these times but i was talking about healing and he goes through all of this with healing and how that healing is of god he talks about where doctors have their parts and all those things and he says god alone has purchased for us our heal it's up to us to do everything that we can in our life and in every way that god has given us for our healing but it's god that heals so notice brother branham because brother brahm you you know this by now brother brown was number one who taught against doctors neither did brother branham teach the doctors and surgeons surgeries and medicines that that's for the weaker faith brother brahman never made that difference that's men's traditions from denominations that have tried to come in but to recognize it doesn't matter if it's surgery medicine it doesn't matter if you're standing here the matter all healing comes from god and i'll tell you if i had to go through surgery or you or anybody else is just as glorious as standing right here as a matter of fact brother branham tells us in the message that he preaches in erie pennsylvania it takes greater faith for that endurance over the long haul than it does for a miracle because over the long haul guess what you're going to have the oh really you're going to have a baby are you buying diapers for abraham you guys know this is not possible that's why it takes greater faith it takes greater faith to take a promise and say god said so and walk with all sorts of things around us but see our way of thinking about it is that the miracle is greater but it's all a miracle it's a miracle day by day that you can stand right there with the promise of god and say god's word is true i don't care how i feel i don't care what thoughts are coming through god's word is true and what god has said he will fulfill though i don't see it he's working now notice brother braham says this if god calls you home tonight there isn't enough medicine in the world that'll keep you here can i read that again if god calls you home tonight there isn't enough medicine in the world we'll keep you here there is nothing going to keep you here and if he determines if he determines you to stay on earth no matter how many physicians says you're going you're dying you're not going it's all up to god see sometimes we get so fast with things instead of recognizing it's god in control oh of that doctor this this church and this and this this and this who's above all of that the devil is above it all when i when you no matter who it is go into anything we are looking for god to be present there the doctor is not the final word he is not the amen of god the amen of god is the amen of god it's jesus christ hallelujah brother brown let me go on now it's those crucial hours that press us under those sacred sands it wasn't the bible and remember no matter how great the distress is satan cannot take your life until god has finished with you there's nothing can happen to you unless god permits it there is no evil can come unless god permits it and it's for your good he is working that the flood couldn't destroy no because noah had a purpose to serve the lion the big kitty cats would mean could not destroy daniel because there was a purpose to be fulfilled the fire could not destroy the hebrew children there was a purpose to be fulfilled god's purpose can't be defeated i would say god if you just help us all of us resting within that reality because who was it that came in the lion's den the reason the angel of the lord came as he did as a deliverer that night was because daniel's purpose was not fulfilled if daniel's purpose oh i can't dwell on this tonight but if daniel's purpose had been fulfilled the angel the lord would have still been there for he is the light to guide me through the valley of the shadow of death hallelujah glory be to god in the highest it couldn't do anything because there was a work for him to do brother brown said now we don't want to be mistaken satan has a has a power satan has a power and that power is death satan is the one who takes your life when god will let him do it but god can hold your life and satan can't take it until god lets him do it he can only use that power as god will let him use it i'm just trying to stay on this tonight and not get hit he can only use that power as god will let him use it you know that's why they said you know what death is it's god harness death up to a bug and the only thing death can do is pull the believer in the presence of his maker brother brown said hey it ain't a bad thing after all he said i wouldn't want to live in this old guest house all the time remember and paul standing here just just throwing these examples here's paul he's you know been brought in you know what accused him of being a rebel rouser and here he stands there in that whole division between sadducees and pharisees in acts 23 and uh you know between the nia high priest he's there and so forth but after when god has remember there was men that was sent to take paul and bring paul out of that mess that was going on there with the with the pharisees and sadducees and and they they brought him there to safety but that night god spoke to paul and he told paul be a good cheer paul for as thou has testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at wrong now god tells him in the midst of conflict god doesn't tell him the conflict's going to go away but he lets him know be of good cheer because what you what's been done here in jerusalem i'm taking you to rome so that you can testify in rome as well god doesn't need to let him know i'm going to remove everything here i'm going to take away trouble there i'm going to no no god just lets him know gives him that that word and lets him know hey i'm not finished yet i'm not finished yet all right oh lord have mercy think of this now paul here he goes and remember you remember even after this particular moment when this was made known to paul by the lord remember there was also men once again right here in this same chapter that were conspiring against paul they were waiting when this guy walks out the city we're getting him right they already had they had the mob set up they were ready they had men that were planted but the purpose wasn't fulfilled and god let it be that there was one who was there that heard overheard this discussion passed it on to the young man her son and he went and he told the keeper of the garden they passed it on and then they got paul out even the time of the day you say how was that done you said samuel these are people that were getting him out that were not believers but it was all in the hand of god god will have people sometimes you were looking remember god can come in many different forms the bible said be not forgetful to entertain strangers for some have entertained angels unawares hallelujah glory be to god i've been the way god will come and god is letting you and i know what it what is it all about it's not about you or me it's god what's he doing all of that when god would say about your job or this or that it's god whole thing letting you and i know i've got this i've got it covered you don't have to worry about it your life is in my hands i just want you to serve my purpose what a rest that brings to our lives so paul after this he's delivered once again now here they are on the way to rome and you know remember the account in acts 27 here they come sailing and they come to a place uh the fair i can't remember fair havens they shouldn't have left there paul told him he don't leave here don't leave here there's going to be bad things coming down the road don't leave here he was a prisoner on the ship but the centurion listened to the ship master and captain before he listened to paul but we could preach on that while but at any rate they loose and then hear that great wind that comes up like a typhoon is how they describe it and to notice that within that here the people are you know they're throwing things overboard they're lightening the load and all that but paul here he is that whole is paul god bringing paul to rome if i can say it like this if there was one ship to be on buddy that's a ship you want to be on you wanted to be on that ship you know why oh i know they said the titanic was unsinkable i know they said it but man said that man said that in his bragging and his post but when god's in the boat it ain't going down we're going to the other side oh we could preach right now this message ain't defeated this word is not defeated we're going to the other side amen your walk with god he's not defeated we're going to the other side we might have to throw out some things out of our life that are weighing us down in the midst of a storm that's a time to evaluate and say really don't need this really don't need that really don't need this really don't need that a storm brings evaluation glory to god he brings evaluation to what's really important and the angel of the lord shows up to paul paul be of good cheer fear not verse 24 for thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee they may not be serving him i mean they may not be in the ship right now but god has given all that sale with thee the word of god is so precious isn't it i love when he comes on it and just starts putting that bow on that violin and just starts stroking there and bringing out the promises and the reality of god hallelujah be of good cheers my brethren for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told what they got to do paul just stay in the ship now the ship was gonna it suffered a breakup right the ship suffered a breakup but no lives were lost the ship was touched but nobody's life was touched it don't say that these men who were with him went on and served god you would think here's a man that has just said that the angel of the lord came to me and i don't believe it was just words if when paul said it there would have been an identity you know there was something there was a presence on this boat last night come on somebody and here they were they make it to an island no surprise it's what god had said i wonder how the thoughts and things would have come to their mind even thoughts would have tried to come to paul's mind and then here is paul getting wood on the island of moline all part of this journey reaches in to get wood to help out with the fire a viper latches on not just anybody this wasn't a garden snake this was a vibe deadly viper as a matter of fact they were waiting for paul to fall over dead but do you realize unless god would have given permission that viper would have had to sit right there while paul wretched are you with me but god gave permission you know why god said i got some people here on this island and they need to see something more than a man you're an actress oh my gosh he's been bit by a snake oh he's been bit by a snake oh you've been bit by a snake quick quick quick he's been bit by a snake and god said i've got this i got this you know why because god's purpose can't be defeated but wasn't a snake handler he just was doing what god told him to do and satan got permission and that vapor struck out but it couldn't take his life but the same wonder what kind of anti-venom that i see every drug company and everything would like to get a hold of that they might start writing shots out of it but you see god has everything under his control as i bring this down here think about brother branham he wants that weatherby magnum rifle right one brother said he can get it bored for him just the right way brother branham and he preaches a message out of this letting off the pressure dumb devil dumb devil brother brandon brought examples out of that message it was so powerful out of that i mean out of that experience because when he's shooting that rifle it was a i went into what what winchester and him had said it was 6 900 pounds of pressure that's going off when that shot is fired the bolt brother tells us the bolt went flew behind him and went clear down to the deer conservation floor it blew apart his head shouldn't have been on his body are you hearing me it shouldn't have been on his body this wasn't a cat gun it was an explosion but you know what brother randy tells us about it he said satan i've realized he said i'm standing here tonight and he said boy it's good to be here he said well i realize this satan tried to kill me but he can't he can't do it until god is finished with me and he said when he's finished i'm ready to go lord be to god you know why because we've been made a possessor of death he have freely given us all things and brother branham ties it in and he ties that in and says death is given to the believer because we're not under death but death is servant to us it's not us saying death get back but we are serving the purpose of god and until that purpose is served death can't touch us i could read you the quote right here tonight he said even death we possess death he said possess death brother branham brother said well glory i don't forgot about the explosion of the gun why didn't why didn't he kill me because he couldn't god wasn't ready see any brother brandon made me brother brown's not saying i'm untouchable i'm a believer you know a believer can't get sick what like some nonsense well if you're a real believer you'll not get coveted really let me know let me let me know when you get it because your flesh is no different than anybody else's flesh are you hearing me friends it's no different than anybody else even in the spirit do you realize brother braham said that a person can be totally insane in their mind and yet sealed with the holy ghost what is it an affliction in their mind mentally are you hearing me this is why satan can come with depression he can come with anxiety he has to get permission it isn't that oh well somebody's so weak it ain't that it's satan has to get permission and the devil will exploit situations not gonna go there tonight but god is still a deliverer so the untouchable part is that of the soul and we're here until that purpose is fulfilled when the purpose is fulfilled then comes down radio from on high mission completed come home and like enoch we walk home hallelujah he said god wasn't ready he said he could come as much as he want to talking about satan he could come as much as he want to but he can't take because death on the grave's already been conquered think of the lord jesus then in pilots hall pilot you know pilate has a position on earth don't you know i have power to release you jesus standing there here's the work of election and predestination where it's working at quickening power it's a rest in his life he knows because you know why they tried to take him many other times and they couldn't take him because his time hadn't come yet are you with me in a corner got out of it in a corner got it you had to be fulfilled and here is jesus standing not arrogant as a believer we're not arrogant it's a rest to us that jesus could say you should have no power over me unless it was given to from above here was one [Music] that was able to express that authority that was to be delivered to the sons and daughters of god and understanding because they didn't have that understanding before but this understanding has come by a living reality that you could have no power unless it's given satan can't touch it unless he's given to you this is why satan would love to bring and that's why he likes to try to bring us to worry worry's not from your soul worries you get a thought in here oh this is going to be could this be and could that be and we can get to thinking about those women now listen let me just stop here without i don't want to preach them because sometimes we can say ah brother brian don't worry let me pull your strings on the things that you worry don't go around here higher mighty don't worry don't worry let me pull the strings on things that you worry about because there's things that you can get worried about oh have faith we could tell you the same thing have faith in the midst of that time you see god knows we're all made up in a certain way and there's certain things that can come to you and i we should encourage one another but every one of us every one of us experience those things from time to time but god delivers us no doubt i'm right here standing before people right here tonight that you've been delivered right here in service you've been delivered right now during this day there's things that god has delivered you may not have been a sickness but it might have been tormented in your mind it might have been something in your spirit it god couldn't write even in your body things that can be delivered glory be to god oh hallelujah don't you love him notice when paul could announce the time i depart not at this very moment but at hand at hand means i'm aware it's coming just like interesting i was down there once again and uh oh i just i love setting taco brother nathan bryant's daddy brother jerry brian he came over on this sunday night i'm so glad he did i mean i love talking brother nathan on it too but man brother jerry has all those different background testimonies and i just sit and listen you realize that even things that brother brown was going into brother branham was aware he was things he would see of what was coming even down the road and so you know god has a way of preparing us god has a way of preparing us sometimes we don't even realize and it isn't always an age you understand me it isn't always an age oh you know they were you know they were 70 years old or 80 years old it isn't always there god had a preparation for a young man right here and this a symbol god was preparing you that were at the fellowship dinner heard it yesterday even as his mother said which i i knew that before but his mother even said it to all who were there mr belinda over the last two years if they see things where he begin to tune a change in him who's doing that god god see nothing can take us until god's purpose is fulfilled i was when i was thinking of this i had text stay in contact with sister cindy soriano and we were just he was texting me so we were about some things that they just had did a big presentation in the philippines when it was that last sunday my brother rowell and uh that we can get that sent out on the link to that an email you know brother rowell in 2013 you remember the congregation he was in serious condition serious condition where i thought he was useful you know the doctor said that's how serious he's in the hospital you know at least but you know what god's purpose wasn't finished none of my dad too 1999 a february he goes to have a heart cast on it and as he and they're going into it finally they come down to a little room where we're sitting something's going on something's going his body's filling number one walking around we begin to pray there in that room mall browning was there um like catholic priests in there too same you little catholic real sure we'll take all the first we can get but we're sitting there praying and my dad had just been preaching a series in the midweek services of behold it is on me let's begin to pray that came out that statement came out about that time just as i'm sitting in my into your leg your trouser legs are like this and all of a sudden i just felt the freezer and dad was at the end of the hall down there we were in a little room but then about five minutes or so they come back and say hey i don't know what happened but everything's good we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna let you come back and see him right now that we're gonna go ahead with the heart cath go from there when we went down to see my dad my dad said and begin to talk to him and he said where were you sitting he said well we were setting get down the hallway he was laying on the table like this we said we were out this whole way right down there to that little room he said that's the direction he came he said it was like brother bradham describes he said that death he said is a fog that fog was rolling in a thumb he said but when he came he said he came walking from that way and he said he walked in and said you're going back because your work is not finished and the wall death had to let go i thought you know just so many different examples even right here in the congregation of things that how right here we're live by accident or others i could go on and on but nothing been taken until god is fine nothing can take us into a goddess family but there's one thing we can take from there the reason i i looked at this and i thought just how's god was bringing this to me even over a week of going so this began i was kept on meditating on these things and looking at it putting it putting things down as it's coming to me jesus was so pulsing anymore i said god if we can all take a hold of this that's perfect love that drives home it drives out the fear satan's business is to try to bring fear and worry matter of fact brother brown says that's what his imps do is bring fear worry and disease but god's army cast them out so they're going to come but we're anointed to cast them out satan gets permission but we're anointed to cast them up and there's not one not one blade of grass and satan time unless he gets permission what a rest that god help us to operate in that rest to operate in this time even that where we've been lit there's a rest you're not going anywhere i'm not going anywhere there's no such thing as oh brother so-and-so would have been here but they were so ignorant about this nonsense you're not going anywhere until god's finished are you hearing me oh brother samuel i know so-and-so committed suicide brother branham tried to twice he grabbed a hold of the electrical line guess what it wasn't his time to go it doesn't you understand we're not taking these things lightly but when recognizing that if it's god's purpose for you and i to be here no matter what condition you're in god is going to anoint your faith get ready for deliverance because he delivers and delivers and delivers and that's why no matter what it is expect and look for deliverance because god is a god who delivers what a rest one of the greatest deliverances is a deliverance from worry deliverance from fear that recognize you know what god's got this in his hands hallelujah oh my i remember even my wife and i were going you know to have children and things like that and how the enemy wanted to try to different times try to come and get in my mind about different things in our mind and try to say this but thanks be to god god's a deliverer i said god's a deliverer he can try to come in any way to get your mind tangled up to where we become occupied with this we become occupied but to realize nothing nothing can stop god's purpose paul's not on the other side and the rest of them say ah paul shouldn't have said what he said did what he did he went too early no he went right in the time of god oh elijah shouldn't no no in right in the time of god see you and i look at things like that oh brother so-and-so oh such a so-and-so oh you know how they are you know how this wait a minute it didn't matter oh how they are they're not going anywhere unless god's purpose has been fulfilled oh we can rest these are not just these are not brother samuel's words this is the word of the law we can rest nothing can come our way unless god permits it and if god permits it he's there to deliver god help us like they did on the ship throw out things that are unnecessary in that time let it be a time of evaluation you know god help us father thank you for your mercy tonight i trust the lord lord of the thought that you've replaced your lord with these things that lord that we right here as an assembly lord and experiencing the lord seeing before us god how i thank you i know we can say this as an entire assembly thank you for your love and your care lord during this time lord in all times lord but father how you would speak to us so clearly that lord we can draw draw from you we can have a real arrest lord you want us to rest in all things and i pray tonight oh god may that lord i pray be that which lord that we are able lord to take and receiving from that tonight lord from you that there is nothing that can ever defeat the purpose of god nothing lord can take us lord before our time has come lord and that purpose has been fulfilled because it all comes down to the purpose of that's what it's all about it's the purpose of them help us lord to be faithful lord help us in serving your purpose lord moment by moment daily lord surrendering our will to your will we love you and thank you now lord and father i pray that your god throughout lord of these times lord may you just reach to every life and every heart lord lord if there's one even here tonight or in the sound of my voice lord that doesn't lord have that reality lord where their life oh god beating out lord in unity with the word of god where there's been a a real change that has come within them lord reflected o god in their life that assurance lord grant it tonight lord may the lord settle that tonight lord with you lord just where they can walk lord with that rest and that peace lord no matter what other needs there are lord among us lord may we rest in that lord that your purpose cannot be defeated and lord we just want to give ourselves more and more in your hands help us father i pray in the name of jesus amen don't you love him let's just stand if we could amen i know it's things that we already know but like peter said there's as long as i'm with you to stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance sometimes it's not just even that the statements of and we're not going anywhere until god's purpose is finished but i think the other part is as i said that sometimes we're always looking out of oh if you know the doctor hadn't done this and the doctor hadn't done this and this and that nobody's going anywhere unless the purpose of god is painful nothing and that's a rest that it brings to us because that rest is him it's in him we're here for a purpose that word is to be fulfilled in our life you may not be a preacher you don't have to be you just you you're still the word you're just as much the word as the preacher would be the book you're no less god has a purpose in what he's doing our lives it's it's christ being reflected in our lives it's him making contact with his people and i'm just i'm so grateful i'm just so thankful just just taking this in just even today just thinking upon us oh god thank you lord once again it shows the predestinated plan of almighty god no doubt like i said we could go through this maybe you have no doubt personal testimonies loved ones father mother so we could probably maybe we share some of that on sunday evening i i don't know but i know beyond the shadow but that we have testimonies here that we could say if it hadn't been for the mercy of god and i would not be but god has you here for a reason so if god spares your life it isn't that he's giving you more life god
