[34:15] midst of of goshen
[34:18] when there was a darkness that struck
[34:20] over the land of egypt but yet the bible
[34:22] says
[34:23] that they had light in their dwellings
[34:26] in goshen you see it was a light
[34:30] this was we're not talking about a
[34:31] candle light
[34:33] they had shekinah glory
[34:36] the word of that hour had brought light
[34:39] into their
[34:40] dwelling just like as we this place
[34:43] would be lit right here today
[34:45] it was a type of you and i being in this
[34:48] hour where darkness is all around a
[34:50] darkness that can be felt
[34:52] but yet in the midst of it there is
[34:54] light that has come
[34:55] to our dwellings oh thanks be to god for
[34:59] his mercy
[35:00] don't you love him i tell you you feel
[35:03] like brother branham says
[35:04] and does god change his mind he says
[35:06] when you see that that god has revealed
[35:08] these things to you
[35:09] and for what he's done in your life he
[35:11] said it makes you want to go over in a
[35:12] corner and just cry
[35:14] and you for what he's done amen well i
[35:18] could talk to you all night long
[35:20] i'm not going to preach on that but we
[35:22] want to just look into the word of the
[35:24] lord here tonight and just ask that god
[35:26] will just
[35:27] take control thank the musicians amen
[35:30] then for all of their work and the
[35:32] yielding
[35:33] let's just go to the lord in a word of
[35:35] prayer if you'd like to stand just for a
[35:37] moment we'll
[35:38] just offer a word of prayer and go right
[35:40] into the scriptures and then we'll
[35:41] just move forward into the message here
[35:45] this evening
[35:47] heavenly father lord as we just come to
[35:50] you this evening
[35:51] lord how precious it is that dear god
[35:54] that we can come and dwell together
[35:57] dear god is the writer of the song lord
[35:59] by divine inspiration
[36:01] oh god would record that of how pleasant
[36:04] it is
[36:05] lord for brethren to dwell together in
[36:07] unity
[36:08] oh god as he described it as that
[36:10] anointing oil that was
[36:12] poured out upon aaron and it ran down
[36:15] oh god through his upon his head through
[36:18] his beard lord upon the clothes it ran
[36:20] down to
[36:20] every part of his garment the body oh
[36:23] god
[36:24] was anointed lord and it flowed from the
[36:26] head
[36:27] oh god all the way down lord we're
[36:30] thankful god to be in unity and
[36:33] and lord we realize that even the
[36:35] admonition of the holy spirit that would
[36:37] speak to our hearts to
[36:39] endeavor to keep the unity lord so we
[36:42] realize there's a charge there's a
[36:44] responsibility that even that you have
[36:46] given
[36:46] us lord we know that in ourselves that
[36:49] lord
[36:49] that we alone can't do it but we can
[36:51] yield to you and you're the one who
[36:53] brings a real unity lord
[36:55] so we just ask o god here tonight that
[36:58] even as we come together lord they
[37:01] gathered in the upper room and the bible
[37:03] says lord that they were in
[37:05] one mind and one accord oh god
[37:09] that invited the holy spirit to bring
[37:12] such a unity
[37:13] and this is our desire god to lay aside
[37:16] everything of this world
[37:18] lay aside our thoughts and our cares
[37:20] though they might be ever so
[37:22] real and and very important but you care
[37:25] lord and you said that the lord and
[37:27] would ask of
[37:28] us to cast our cares upon you because
[37:31] you care for us
[37:32] so lord for every need is here tonight
[37:35] god i asked as we place some lord upon
[37:37] the altar of god and ask that the fire
[37:40] of god would
[37:40] come down and consume them and emit and
[37:43] address those needs
[37:44] that lord you would minister to our
[37:46] hearts in a very personal way
[37:48] as we are gathered here lord to walk in
[37:50] your presence lord
[37:52] and to be changed lord we love you and
[37:54] thank you now in jesus precious name
[37:57] amen amen one verse of scripture
[38:00] first corinthians chapter 13
[38:04] verse 4. and i'm just going to read here
[38:08] and then we'll let you be seated
[38:11] paul writing with that of charity and
[38:15] that of love
[38:17] charity suffereth long
[38:20] and is kind charity envy if
[38:24] not charity vaunteth not itself
[38:28] is not puffed up amen may god bless his
[38:31] word and bless you as you're being
[38:33] seated
[38:36] sorry if you didn't get turned to it
[38:38] soon enough that's okay
[38:40] i heard some movement on pages but we
[38:43] just
[38:44] when we look at this and discerning the
[38:46] love of god and i want to continue to
[38:48] look at this
[38:50] this portion in the word i believe the
[38:52] word is set forth to admonish us
[38:54] as children of god to the rights and to
[38:57] the privileges
[38:59] to be reminded of what belongs to us
[39:02] that the spirit of god would bring
[39:04] discernment to our hearts and situations
[39:06] and
[39:07] i don't believe that it's god's desire
[39:09] that we it would just be
[39:11] reserved to where we come to the house
[39:13] of god and that's the only place of
[39:15] discernment
[39:16] but the reality is that every son and
[39:18] daughter of god that is
[39:19] born of the spirit of god you receive
[39:22] the spirit of discernment
[39:23] and we discern we recognize that our
[39:26] discernment
[39:27] is sharpened by the word of god and the
[39:30] word is the bible which would speak to
[39:32] us in hebrews 5 that you know
[39:34] milk itself is necessary in the
[39:37] beginning but then
[39:38] as we grow that strong meat belonging to
[39:41] them that are full age who have their
[39:43] senses exercised to discern good from
[39:47] evil
[39:48] we have situations that even in our life
[39:50] at times that we go through
[39:52] and there are things that i will say it
[39:54] like this that if we
[39:55] ever get to a spot that we feel like
[39:57] that well i'm going to get to a place
[39:59] that i'll never make a mistake
[40:01] you're aiming for a place that you'll
[40:03] never make it
[40:04] but the reality is is that is to have a
[40:06] real
[40:07] a real change on the inside when we have
[40:10] that change on the inside then we have
[40:12] the righteousness and the grace of god
[40:14] we've got the direction of god and
[40:16] we have that which seeks to please god
[40:19] and to follow his will
[40:21] and we learn as we go through things
[40:24] within our life there are situations and
[40:26] things that we
[40:27] can just come to a place and i think
[40:29] that we can
[40:30] speak freely in this to where you say
[40:33] lord
[40:34] help me to be ever more discerning in
[40:37] this in a situation because
[40:39] every situation sometimes it becomes
[40:42] somewhat the same but yet it comes in a
[40:45] different
[40:46] appearance we see that even in the
[40:47] temptations of the lord jesus
[40:49] this is where we need discernment and
[40:51] this is where to say lord let me live
[40:53] ever close to you
[40:55] that when things arise and come that god
[40:57] that i'll know i may not understand
[41:00] what's going on but there'll be
[41:01] something
[41:02] that i'm very sensitive to to let me
[41:04] know be careful in your step be careful
[41:06] what you're going to say
[41:07] be careful in your mood we want to be so
[41:10] under the control of the holy spirit and
[41:12] this is where
[41:13] with the scripture here as we're reading
[41:15] and i want to just touch a little bit
[41:17] here this
[41:18] this evening trying to uh move through
[41:20] this part here just a little bit
[41:22] uh and brother branham is is dealing
[41:24] with this here in the message influence
[41:27] and this
[41:27] i want to read this quote to you here
[41:29] he's speaking of of reverence he's
[41:31] speaking of
[41:32] uh of the the seraphims there in the
[41:35] temple
[41:36] and he says reverence we ought to honor
[41:38] one another
[41:39] respect one another as brother and
[41:41] sister
[41:42] and love one another with undying love
[41:45] and you say well i just can't
[41:47] well just stay here a little longer than
[41:50] you will like people too
[41:52] you'll love those who doesn't love you
[41:54] that's a really good
[41:55] sign of christianity when you can
[41:58] from your heart love those who does not
[42:02] love you love the unlovable
[42:06] jesus said and we read from this last
[42:08] time jesus said if you just do
[42:10] favors for those who do favors for you
[42:14] well the publicans do the same thing
[42:17] but you see you must be kind to those
[42:19] who are
[42:20] unkind to you do good
[42:23] for those that would do evil to you
[42:27] always remember that i think that's a
[42:29] very fitting
[42:30] uh admonition always remember that
[42:34] keep that before you that god is
[42:36] watching
[42:37] he's watching you remember god was good
[42:40] to you when you were
[42:41] evil to him while you were yet sinners
[42:45] christ died for you it's a very
[42:48] basis in the reality of our life we are
[42:51] we are taught to love by
[42:54] the love of god itself coming into our
[42:57] lives
[42:58] this is where that paul paul would write
[43:01] in many also different places and we
[43:03] find this admonition to the believers
[43:06] and you would you would look how paul
[43:08] would write this
[43:09] a concerning love and he would say let
[43:12] love be
[43:12] without dissimilation in the book of
[43:15] romans that means hypocrisy
[43:17] abort that which is evil cleave to that
[43:20] which is good
[43:21] be kindly affection to one another
[43:24] with brotherly love in honor preferring
[43:28] one another i think he would paul would
[43:31] write this he's not writing this
[43:32] to unbelievers truly with among the
[43:35] church there would be unbelievers
[43:37] there's make believers
[43:38] and believers but it's not up to you and
[43:41] i to decide
[43:42] who is a believer who's not a believer
[43:45] and frankly
[43:46] even if a person would even proven to be
[43:48] an unbeliever
[43:49] still the bible says he is kind to those
[43:52] who are unthankful see they're
[43:54] to recognize that even when judas was
[43:56] there among the lord jesus
[43:58] there was not one not one mark in his
[44:01] response or action toward judas even
[44:04] though he know
[44:05] who he was there was nothing that you
[44:08] could point out and say
[44:09] something's wrong here
[44:13] is that right right i think we all could
[44:15] say put both our hands and both our feet
[44:17] in the air and say
[44:18] help me jesus but being
[44:22] kindly affection to one another see god
[44:24] knowing that here
[44:25] you and i even after the change and
[44:28] after
[44:29] that there has come a real birth on the
[44:33] inside
[44:33] there's a change that's taken place let
[44:35] me just say it like this
[44:37] you used to live at the address of
[44:39] unkindness
[44:41] that used to be known you know how when
[44:43] you'd have you know kids going down the
[44:45] street
[44:45] don't walk in that guy's yard don't walk
[44:48] in that lady's yard they'll come out on
[44:49] the porch and yell at you
[44:51] there used to be and how god would write
[44:54] this at through paul to titus
[44:56] we once he writes it like this lived
[44:59] in malice lived in hatred
[45:03] hating one another we once
[45:06] lived in these places but
[45:09] god has delivered us
[45:12] there's a ransom that came as titus
[45:15] records through the kindness of our lord
[45:18] jesus christ
[45:19] that that kindness overwhelmed even
[45:22] our our first man was a contentious man
[45:26] the bible records
[45:27] a carnal mind as enmity and strife
[45:30] against god
[45:31] but what a paradox it is for god to get
[45:33] that man
[45:34] to come into a place of agreeance and
[45:37] laying down to where then he can move to
[45:39] bring about a real birth on the inside
[45:42] that is a paradox to where god can
[45:45] change
[45:46] a person's mind begin to change their
[45:48] thinking
[45:49] what did that the kindness and appearing
[45:52] of our lord jesus christ
[45:54] to us personally there's an effect that
[45:57] he has had
[45:58] upon our lives so here the scripture
[46:01] said be kindly
[46:02] affection one to another with brotherly
[46:04] love
[46:05] this this scripture it deals with that
[46:08] family
[46:08] that that love that is to exist between
[46:11] that of a family where you
[46:13] cherish your kindred you know i mean you
[46:15] know how it is i mean
[46:16] i found it out as a pastor i found it
[46:18] out in other situations
[46:20] blood's thicker than water blood's
[46:23] thicker than water i mean you just
[46:24] you know in in situations you you
[46:27] recognize there's a cherish sometimes
[46:29] between
[46:29] that can be and this family this person
[46:32] can be against this one don't get
[46:33] between it right there
[46:34] you get yourself killed because there's
[46:37] still a cherishedness that's there
[46:38] there's still a
[46:39] a a a part that's there that we should
[46:42] cherish that of our family but you see
[46:45] it raises to another place here
[46:47] we're not just talking about filial love
[46:50] we're
[46:51] talking about agape love where there's a
[46:54] real
[46:54] cherishing of our kind let me just say
[46:57] it like this the bible would say there
[46:58] should be peace toward all men we spoke
[47:00] of this
[47:01] there should be a love toward even those
[47:03] on the outside
[47:04] just because somebody doesn't see what
[47:06] we see or whatever more
[47:08] you know but we're we we are to love
[47:10] them and to be kind
[47:11] but how much greater it is to me to be
[47:14] able to come
[47:15] and be able to fellowship with brothers
[47:17] and sisters of light precious faith
[47:19] to be able to sit down with a brother or
[47:22] a sister
[47:23] and to be able to have fellowship around
[47:25] the revealed word of the hour
[47:27] to be able to come together with the
[47:29] body of believers let me just tell you
[47:31] something
[47:31] when we come together like this everyone
[47:34] bearing a lick of fire it's more of the
[47:37] godhead bodily coming together
[47:39] it's a fellowshipping of the attributes
[47:41] of god it's something that we cherish
[47:43] that
[47:44] you know how it is you can walk you can
[47:46] work around
[47:47] people and maybe there's people all
[47:49] around you and yet you feel so lonely
[47:52] but how precious it is that there are
[47:54] others that you can come to and there's
[47:56] a
[47:57] there's a cherishing just to be around
[47:59] brothers and sisters it's not even
[48:01] anything you've got to say or
[48:03] anything you've got to do you don't even
[48:05] have to have a partner service
[48:06] it's just a delight to be able to be
[48:09] gathered together
[48:10] with brothers and sisters there's a
[48:12] cherishing to this
[48:15] it's something that we cherish we
[48:17] cherish
[48:18] brothers and sisters and this is why the
[48:20] scripture is speaking of
[48:21] being kindly affection one to another
[48:24] and this word it deals with that kind of
[48:27] a love that would exist between
[48:30] of a children and parents where it's
[48:32] reciprocal
[48:33] now you think of this there's many
[48:34] places in the scripture like when it
[48:36] speaks
[48:37] of husbands and wives it never says one
[48:39] place in the scripture
[48:40] wives love your husbands
[48:43] it does say for the four the children
[48:47] honor father and mother and it ties in
[48:50] with that promise
[48:51] of of of longevity of life really
[48:54] speaking of the quality of your days
[48:57] and it speaks of these of these things
[49:00] but yet
[49:01] these things how can that be gained when
[49:03] we talk about
[49:04] honoring father and mother when we talk
[49:06] about wives
[49:07] you know that just submit as we read on
[49:10] sunday submit and
[49:11] and be subject under your husbands all
[49:13] of these things are to be
[49:14] governed by love but there must be a
[49:17] source of love a fountain of love as we
[49:19] spoke on
[49:20] where this right kind this love is being
[49:22] drawn from and this love
[49:24] has an effect it's effectual and that's
[49:27] why within this
[49:28] love here in order for it to be
[49:30] reciprocal it must be
[49:32] something that is flowing through the
[49:34] body because for something to be
[49:36] reciprocal
[49:37] it's what's expressed and then what's
[49:38] expressed it flows back
[49:40] i pray to god say god let there not be
[49:43] any damns in my life
[49:45] let there not be nothing that hinders
[49:48] the reciprocal flow
[49:49] of the love of almighty god even my
[49:52] thoughts on something i may not agree
[49:54] i may not feel but don't let me pull
[49:56] myself off because
[49:57] charity will never do that
[50:01] let it be a reciprocal let it be
[50:03] something that can be received
[50:05] as the moon can receive the light of the
[50:07] sun and reflect it back
[50:08] let it be something that our lives
[50:11] there's a reciprocal
[50:12] cherishing that that is taking place
[50:15] before
[50:15] our lives because this is where you know
[50:18] brother bran will tell us in a very
[50:20] simple way he talks about how
[50:22] you know the doctors told uh a hope when
[50:26] billy was born you know
[50:28] uh you know don't be picking that baby
[50:29] up all the time you
[50:31] let it lay in the crib by six months it
[50:33] ought to be quite broke and
[50:34] if it's crying let it lay in the crib
[50:36] brother bram said that don't sound like
[50:37] a doctor that sounds like a witch doctor
[50:39] to me
[50:40] you've got a choice as he said he said
[50:42] you know that little baby
[50:44] it's something that god has given to you
[50:47] and he says
[50:48] god's given it to you to spoil it and to
[50:50] love it he says take it and you love it
[50:52] because why how does a child learn love
[50:55] unless
[50:55] love is expressed is that right how can
[50:58] a child learn how to love
[51:00] and sometimes i understand that through
[51:03] when we speak
[51:04] to a congregation i understand we've all
[51:06] come from different backgrounds
[51:08] and different walks and sometimes these
[51:09] things sometimes would be like well
[51:11] that's just normal that's just natural
[51:13] but remember
[51:14] how does a child learn how to love
[51:16] unless they first are taught by an
[51:18] example
[51:19] how do they learn how to reciprocate a
[51:21] love and bring a love back and i know
[51:23] even our makeups can be different but
[51:25] this but such a love
[51:27] a love that is expressed how could you
[51:29] and i know how to love in this way
[51:31] if there hadn't been one who loved us
[51:33] when we were unlovable
[51:35] this is what paul says ye yourselves are
[51:38] taught of god
[51:39] to love one another god has taught
[51:42] us we were unlovable then listen there
[51:45] was a quarrel between us
[51:47] there was enmity between us there was a
[51:50] situation we were going completely
[51:52] the opposite way there was there was at
[51:55] odds
[51:56] but yet god himself he came he
[51:59] dealt with our life he spoke to
[52:01] something that was
[52:02] much deeper than the condition that we
[52:05] were in
[52:06] he spoke to the very depths of our life
[52:08] and his love
[52:09] brought a change love didn't pat us on
[52:12] the back
[52:12] but love spoke to the real need that was
[52:15] in our life
[52:17] love was able to discern this is the
[52:19] real need you see
[52:20] the real love of god is not just
[52:22] something that's a bubbly on the outside
[52:25] without any depth and density on the
[52:27] inside
[52:28] the real love of god is that it goes
[52:30] beyond emotion
[52:32] it's something that propels us it's what
[52:34] holds us
[52:35] it's what keeps us in the thickness in
[52:37] the darkness of the trial
[52:39] it's the love of god that we are not
[52:41] separated from
[52:43] it's what helps us when things look dark
[52:45] it helps us to look up
[52:47] when we feel down he lifts us up when we
[52:50] are discouraged he encourages
[52:51] us what is that that's the love of god
[52:54] amen
[52:56] oh hallelujah this is why when the
[52:59] scripture
[53:01] as it would speak to us there there
[53:04] in ephesians 4 it says be kind to one
[53:07] another
[53:08] tenderhearted you know
[53:12] you just kind of take that for granted
[53:13] well yeah you should be kind to one
[53:15] another
[53:16] but be kind to one another
[53:20] these are admonitions that when we know
[53:23] they're going to be times we really need
[53:25] that admonition there's times when we
[53:28] want it to come
[53:29] we want to be available to where god can
[53:32] bring it to our heart and say
[53:34] be kind you say oh lord
[53:37] yes lord jesus lord help me
[53:41] be tenderhearted
[53:44] that doesn't mean to be a but to
[53:48] be tenderhearted it deals with
[53:50] where there's compassion
[53:53] there's compassion and once again
[53:58] sometimes backgrounds but i don't
[53:59] believe i'm speaking to people here
[54:02] because sometimes the reality is in our
[54:04] life we want to when we can't see
[54:06] what we want to see in our life or we
[54:08] look at things and we say
[54:10] you don't know the family i come out of
[54:12] but i'm not talking about your natural
[54:14] family tree
[54:15] that's a cursed tree anyhow i'm talking
[54:18] about if you are born of the spirit of
[54:20] god you're of the tree of life
[54:22] so now you're not just looking at you're
[54:24] not under
[54:25] that of the strains of that natural tree
[54:28] you've received that strain of
[54:30] life that comes from the tree of life
[54:32] that lifts you into that place to where
[54:34] these are are the attributes and those
[54:37] parts that belong to us
[54:38] as sons and daughters of god
[54:44] it doesn't mean that you're not going to
[54:45] feel things out here
[54:48] this is why you've got to have an inside
[54:51] man
[54:52] charity on the inside that's able to
[54:54] pull that outside man
[54:56] in subjection to be tenderhearted
[55:00] this word in being tenderhearted it's
[55:02] the same
[55:03] word that's used in colossians 3
[55:07] well in referring to it put on therefore
[55:12] as the elect of god this word put on i
[55:16] i'll tell you it becomes more real i've
[55:18] looked at it over the years put on
[55:20] it's sinking into a garment
[55:23] it's this where this garment of the new
[55:26] man the new birth
[55:27] becomes more preeminent amen it's
[55:30] overtaking in our life
[55:32] it becomes more and more preeminent
[55:36] the less man like we are the more
[55:38] god-like we become
[55:40] put on sink into
[55:43] that as the elect of god holy and
[55:45] beloved bowser mercy
[55:47] kindness this word kindness is the same
[55:50] word in the new testament that deals
[55:51] with
[55:52] goodness the goodness of god the
[55:55] gentleness
[55:56] of the fruit of the spirit but put on
[55:58] this and it speaks of bounds of mercy
[56:01] this is where that compassion that
[56:04] tender
[56:04] heartedness you know one of the first
[56:08] thing that god deals with in our life
[56:10] when he's bringing us to himself
[56:14] he changes our heart the bible says i'll
[56:17] give you a
[56:18] new heart and a new spirit
[56:22] so even with the tender heartedness god
[56:25] moves even to really affect even our
[56:28] thinking
[56:29] in the situation amen
[56:33] that god works so deep within our life
[56:38] and helps us to see things sometimes in
[56:40] a way
[56:41] that we can't see it and we need that
[56:45] we sometimes can't even see it even when
[56:47] it's presented to us
[56:49] and we can look at it sometimes the
[56:51] argument
[56:52] or the point of contention is is we're
[56:54] looking
[56:55] more at the wound or the grievance
[56:59] than actually at the admonition are you
[57:02] with me
[57:03] sometimes the wound and the grievance
[57:05] can cause people to ignore
[57:08] the healing that is present
[57:12] wound is a very serious thing a
[57:15] grievance
[57:16] there's probably not one of us in here
[57:17] that haven't been grieved
[57:20] i'm not talking about the holy spirit in
[57:21] your life i'm talking about you
[57:24] a grievance and those things but there
[57:27] is one who can take
[57:28] care of that wound but if you keep your
[57:32] thinking about it
[57:34] that wound will only canker it'll spread
[57:37] through your whole body
[57:39] and it'll overtake the system
[57:43] this is why there's got to be bowels of
[57:45] mercy this deals with
[57:47] a reserve like that of the spleen in our
[57:50] body that takes
[57:51] old cells that we would look at and say
[57:55] just get rid of them what it does it
[57:57] takes those cells i know i'm speaking to
[57:59] doctors here and
[58:00] everything there's some that studied for
[58:02] doctor and those are nurses and so forth
[58:04] but it takes those cells and it takes
[58:07] them in
[58:08] and instead of recycling them back into
[58:10] the body or just
[58:11] passing them on through it takes breaks
[58:14] down
[58:14] and it forms new cells i said god
[58:18] help me with bowels of mercy
[58:22] to have that when something comes like
[58:24] brother baby says when something comes
[58:26] your way oh you heard what so and so or
[58:27] you heard this
[58:28] let it be bowser mercy says let me have
[58:30] that sale take that sale
[58:32] and not pass it on to somebody else say
[58:36] this sound doesn't need to be loose in
[58:37] the body
[58:38] it's a corrupt cell this is why the
[58:41] bible says
[58:41] that let no corrupt communication
[58:44] proceed
[58:45] out of your mouth but only that which
[58:47] would minister
[58:48] grace and edification to the hero
[58:51] we're responsible this is not just a
[58:53] duty of a pastor of a deacon
[58:55] we all are responsible in these things
[58:58] we
[58:58] all are to put on we all are to have
[59:01] that a charity
[59:02] we all are responsible to where we look
[59:04] at it and i'm just saying even for this
[59:06] church where you say
[59:07] this is my church this is my i'm talking
[59:10] about you saying that this is my church
[59:13] this is not coming in here we're not
[59:15] entertaining that
[59:16] hey did you hear about stop it right
[59:18] there
[59:22] glory be to god
[59:25] this is this is where the scripture goes
[59:28] on let me just
[59:29] just trying to wrap up that first part
[59:30] of that verse it deals in the scripture
[59:33] even in the stature of a perfect man of
[59:36] how that peter
[59:38] is dealing with you know from the
[59:39] foundation of faith and
[59:41] bringing it all the way up to the
[59:43] capstone but within there within
[59:46] the last age and the time that we would
[59:49] be in
[59:50] it's the admonition this is what the
[59:52] word
[59:53] would bring about a brotherly kindness
[59:56] remember the one one brother the way
[59:59] this was described in the vision
[1:00:01] was that where you had the water being
[1:00:04] poured into the church
[1:00:05] which is the holy ghost the the the the
[1:00:08] holy ghost being preached
[1:00:09] but inside of the church brother braham
[1:00:11] says there's all sorts of people
[1:00:13] it isn't that water itself as it's
[1:00:15] poured in that well everybody the whole
[1:00:17] church holds that water
[1:00:19] that water is a type of the holy spirit
[1:00:21] and it is poured out
[1:00:22] and there are individuals who receive
[1:00:25] that life
[1:00:26] and become born again
[1:00:30] but then you have the honey coming down
[1:00:34] brother says that honey was coming down
[1:00:36] he described that
[1:00:37] as brotherly kindness and look pouring
[1:00:39] it in
[1:00:40] that rock box it looks like you know the
[1:00:42] box that has like holes in it he says
[1:00:44] it looks like that honey would not stick
[1:00:48] but he says it does stick now these are
[1:00:50] the things that he speaks concerning
[1:00:52] this brotherly kindness he says so much
[1:00:56] where you know somebody could say you
[1:00:58] know i sure don't like brother neville
[1:01:00] i sure don't like brother jones i don't
[1:01:02] like brother so-and-so and something
[1:01:03] like that
[1:01:04] but just let something happen to him
[1:01:07] and your heart is broke it just nearly
[1:01:11] kills you he said see we can obtain
[1:01:14] brotherly kindness and
[1:01:15] feeling for one another
[1:01:19] feeling for one another you know
[1:01:21] sometimes
[1:01:23] feeling of having brotherly kindness and
[1:01:25] feeling for one another
[1:01:26] god sometimes can allow you and i to go
[1:01:28] through something
[1:01:29] so we can develop a little bit more
[1:01:31] feeling
[1:01:33] sometimes it's always so easy to think
[1:01:34] well why is this person going through
[1:01:36] this or why is this or why is that and
[1:01:38] why
[1:01:38] but you know each and every one of us we
[1:01:40] got our own
[1:01:42] tasks trials struggles what however you
[1:01:44] want to word it
[1:01:46] and this is where as we enter in brother
[1:01:48] graham called it like this
[1:01:50] schools of suffering that we have that
[1:01:53] we go through
[1:01:54] in order to know what someone else might
[1:01:56] be feeling
[1:01:58] and to have sympathy for them this is
[1:02:00] where even kindness comes in
[1:02:02] is to be able to look at it and he takes
[1:02:04] it even a little deeper he says now
[1:02:06] why he says do you care for that brother
[1:02:09] it's because you broke bread with him at
[1:02:11] the altar
[1:02:12] you fellowship with him you shook hands
[1:02:14] with him you worship with him
[1:02:16] he's your brother he might do something
[1:02:18] in the flesh that
[1:02:20] you would disagree with but you just
[1:02:23] kind of
[1:02:24] and because of that you just kind of
[1:02:25] stay he's saying stay away which
[1:02:28] you want to do he said but you shun him
[1:02:30] a little
[1:02:32] that's a natural tendency yeah someone
[1:02:35] said well that's not my tendency
[1:02:37] you're lying there's i'm talking not
[1:02:40] talking about your soul if you're born
[1:02:42] again
[1:02:43] there is no one that likes to stick
[1:02:45] around with somebody
[1:02:46] where there's contention and
[1:02:48] disagreeable or something see
[1:02:49] that's seal parts this is the mystery of
[1:02:52] even as we
[1:02:53] come together as a body of believers you
[1:02:56] know we sat down long enough it's like
[1:02:58] just
[1:02:58] when i sat down with ministers there's
[1:03:00] things that you know what we may not see
[1:03:02] i don't
[1:03:03] that's good let's move on let's move on
[1:03:06] i'm not we're not there to try to well
[1:03:08] let's try to hash this out and try to
[1:03:10] get this and we're not about that i
[1:03:11] i'm not interested in that right there
[1:03:13] there are some things that are important
[1:03:15] and there are other things
[1:03:17] that ain't going to stop or hinder the
[1:03:18] rapture you might feel it this way
[1:03:21] and i might think this way or whatever
[1:03:23] mark don't matter
[1:03:24] let's the main thing be settled is that
[1:03:26] you know jesus christ
[1:03:28] in the power of his resurrection and
[1:03:30] many times
[1:03:31] as we get into that it all depends on
[1:03:33] our makeup too sometimes others have to
[1:03:35] reign on this
[1:03:36] a little bit more sometimes people are a
[1:03:38] little bit more geared they gotta prove
[1:03:40] their point
[1:03:40] they gotta do they'll be tested in that
[1:03:43] just as much
[1:03:44] as others can be tested that are
[1:03:46] withdrawn but there are times that
[1:03:47] they've got to stand and say
[1:03:49] hey this is that there's got to be times
[1:03:51] and this is where
[1:03:52] we need the discernment of the holy
[1:03:54] spirit it has nothing about well i know
[1:03:56] what word comes and i know how to lay
[1:03:58] this
[1:03:58] in and you may know all of that but it's
[1:04:01] waiting on him
[1:04:02] to know what does he say do at that time
[1:04:05] this is where the love of god it governs
[1:04:08] that and that's what we want
[1:04:09] we do not want the knowledge without
[1:04:11] love we want love to govern
[1:04:13] our understanding this is where
[1:04:17] he says now but from the bottom of your
[1:04:19] heart now notice
[1:04:20] it will cause you to shun a little bit
[1:04:22] but notice brother ram takes this
[1:04:24] but in the bottom of your heart
[1:04:27] separating now
[1:04:29] if something happened to that brother it
[1:04:31] would just
[1:04:32] nearly kill you or that sister
[1:04:35] i'm an old man i was once young and now
[1:04:38] i'm old i'm just going to stop here just
[1:04:40] for a moment
[1:04:40] i wish i had a picture up here that
[1:04:42] somebody sent me a long time ago
[1:04:44] it showed two it showed two adults you
[1:04:47] know it looked
[1:04:48] you know it was like a a see-through
[1:04:50] body and it's just an outline of people
[1:04:52] and it showed uh two body come up here
[1:04:55] paul for a minute
[1:04:57] you might see through this guy but not
[1:04:59] me
[1:05:00] just stand stand with your back up next
[1:05:02] to mine it had
[1:05:04] and fold your arms like like no fold
[1:05:06] your arms out there like like you're
[1:05:08] upset
[1:05:08] and it had two adults standing like this
[1:05:12] and they're just facing the other way
[1:05:14] just
[1:05:16] but inside it showed two little people
[1:05:19] that was pushing
[1:05:20] to try to get together two little people
[1:05:23] like a little person in me
[1:05:24] a little person in there that's actually
[1:05:26] trying to get together
[1:05:28] but it's me and him keeping us apart
[1:05:32] you ain't moving me from my way i dug in
[1:05:35] i've created an imaginal line right here
[1:05:38] you ain't gonna budge me buddy
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:47] i thought of that just now there's
[1:05:50] things sometimes that
[1:05:52] that that within a person's life they
[1:05:55] know you know what i need to let this go
[1:05:59] let me tell you what comes to you and
[1:06:00] says no keep it going it ain't the
[1:06:02] spirit of christ
[1:06:04] it is satan because his business
[1:06:07] is to divide
[1:06:11] what should i do let the inner man
[1:06:14] have the right of way and humble
[1:06:18] yourselves
[1:06:21] as a little child
[1:06:27] see because in the bottom of the heart
[1:06:29] this is what brother braham said
[1:06:30] a person outwardly would chunk but in
[1:06:32] the bottom of the heart
[1:06:34] you still you have such a feeling for
[1:06:35] that person
[1:06:37] sometimes what it is you're trying to
[1:06:39] even process how to even
[1:06:41] how do i even interact with a person i
[1:06:44] don't know about you but maybe you
[1:06:45] haven't
[1:06:46] sometimes i've had that where people i
[1:06:47] don't know how to even interact with
[1:06:49] them
[1:06:50] i don't know i don't even know because
[1:06:53] it's just kind of the way things are
[1:06:55] when when things happen brother simon
[1:06:56] you as a pastor i'm just being honest
[1:06:58] with you
[1:06:58] so what do you do well you just try to
[1:07:00] you try to be friendly you're trying to
[1:07:02] be kind
[1:07:02] you don't know which way to go you know
[1:07:04] what way to say
[1:07:05] sometimes you know you've been around
[1:07:07] people that you say this right here
[1:07:09] they're coming to correct that wait a
[1:07:10] minute brother just chill out
[1:07:12] we're not here this isn't about anything
[1:07:14] we're just coming to
[1:07:18] just ease up you know where everything
[1:07:21] is all around and it's
[1:07:24] fine i don't call that fellowship
[1:07:28] but still maybe that brother maybe that
[1:07:31] sister
[1:07:32] maybe they're intense maybe there's
[1:07:35] things in their life that needs to be
[1:07:37] humbled
[1:07:38] and god is saying i got something i
[1:07:40] gotta rub off on you too
[1:07:42] samuel
[1:07:45] isn't it amazing we always look my that
[1:07:48] person
[1:07:49] god help that person god said i
[1:07:52] am and i'm trying to use you
[1:07:55] and trying to help you
[1:07:59] oh my once again hands and feet in the
[1:08:01] air help me jesus
[1:08:04] i'm an old man i once was young now i'm
[1:08:06] old i've seen it
[1:08:07] down through the age you hear people say
[1:08:10] i just won't have no more to do with it
[1:08:12] and something happened to that man that
[1:08:13] nearly kills you he thinks oh god
[1:08:16] i let my precious brother go without
[1:08:18] making friends with him
[1:08:20] see that's brotherly love brother brown
[1:08:22] would also describe it that that
[1:08:24] brotherly
[1:08:25] kindness it's putting yourself in his
[1:08:28] place on the matter
[1:08:31] i wonder why maybe the brother maybe
[1:08:33] there's maybe there's something back in
[1:08:35] the life
[1:08:36] maybe there's something that's been it
[1:08:37] doesn't make what they've done right
[1:08:39] that's not what it's saying
[1:08:41] but it's trying to understand why are
[1:08:42] they responding this way
[1:08:44] why are they going about this way why is
[1:08:47] it
[1:08:48] i mean it's just like when i've had
[1:08:50] things where people just do not trust
[1:08:53] as a pastor they don't trust
[1:08:57] everything's a conspiracy tell me why
[1:08:59] this
[1:09:03] what do you mean why
[1:09:06] things are just done
[1:09:10] but you know when you start to look at
[1:09:12] something you begin to realize
[1:09:14] what's behind that person's life and i'm
[1:09:17] not talking about a devil now
[1:09:18] i talk about sometimes there can be
[1:09:20] things sometimes it goes deep maybe into
[1:09:22] the raising
[1:09:23] maybe they have been scarred maybe they
[1:09:26] have been burnt but let me just tell you
[1:09:27] something
[1:09:28] if you've been burnt and you've been
[1:09:30] scarred and every one of us have had
[1:09:32] some sort of offense
[1:09:36] don't let that offense become an excuse
[1:09:41] i ain't never gonna trust nobody else
[1:09:44] that's natural to come that way you know
[1:09:46] that when you get burnt with things like
[1:09:48] that
[1:09:48] that's a natural tendency i don't care
[1:09:50] who you are even if you're a pastor
[1:09:52] it's a natural tendency to say i ain't
[1:09:54] trusting nobody
[1:09:56] no more we got quiet i know seeds
[1:10:00] dropping it's natural tendency i said
[1:10:03] it's a natural tendency
[1:10:04] i didn't say it was a god tendency
[1:10:08] this is where the battle comes in this
[1:10:11] is where it requires the strength of the
[1:10:14] lord
[1:10:14] within our lives this is where it
[1:10:17] requires leading us this is where it
[1:10:18] comes to that place
[1:10:19] and say god teach me lord help me lord
[1:10:22] and maybe
[1:10:23] in your life maybe there's things
[1:10:25] complexes that you didn't even realize
[1:10:28] and now a situation arises and you're
[1:10:30] looking at that situation and god
[1:10:32] is allowing that situation to highlight
[1:10:35] our need for more of him
[1:10:36] and that our lives might be further
[1:10:38] dissolved
[1:10:40] to become more of an instrument
[1:10:42] sometimes we're looking god
[1:10:44] i want to be such an instrument of you
[1:10:46] but you can't go past your abc's
[1:10:48] and become a great instrument here you
[1:10:51] have to
[1:10:51] in order for algebra it takes abcs
[1:10:55] is that right these things that we
[1:10:58] we see within it it takes it takes
[1:11:01] god to help us as brother braham says
[1:11:04] putting
[1:11:04] ourselves in under the brother's place
[1:11:07] he would say it in this manner if he's
[1:11:08] out of tune
[1:11:09] don't be impatient with him right
[1:11:12] anybody ever like anything out of tune
[1:11:14] like what if this piano we you know just
[1:11:16] had it out of tune or a guitar
[1:11:18] you would set out there and
[1:11:22] let brother so-and-so play air guitar
[1:11:23] tonight
[1:11:25] just let so-and-so play air piano
[1:11:27] tonight everybody can play air piano
[1:11:29] like beethoven
[1:11:30] let them play that tonight
[1:11:34] but i'm talking about when somebody gets
[1:11:36] out of tune you know what out of tune
[1:11:37] means
[1:11:37] they're not in one mind and one accord
[1:11:39] one mind and one of corn means
[1:11:41] where like everybody is a note and you
[1:11:43] you'll yield yourself to a harmony
[1:11:45] and when someone wants to start pulling
[1:11:47] off their note
[1:11:49] i mean their note might be a bigger note
[1:11:51] maybe an eighth note 16th note half note
[1:11:54] whole note
[1:11:55] man it's a better note no it's not it
[1:11:58] goes with the rest of the notes there's
[1:12:01] no big eyes or little u's
[1:12:04] your note on its own cannot make a song
[1:12:07] but if you yield your note it'll come in
[1:12:09] and it'll be part of the song and
[1:12:11] there'll be a beautiful melody
[1:12:15] that's what happened on the day of
[1:12:16] pentecost the great composer came down
[1:12:19] and the arrangement he put every note
[1:12:21] that was laying in their life and
[1:12:23] brought it to a divine expression
[1:12:27] oh god so when we get out of tune you
[1:12:30] know sometimes they
[1:12:31] appear on these instruments they get out
[1:12:34] of tune my father-in-law has these elec
[1:12:36] electronic tuners and you know they we
[1:12:38] have we have individuals that come in
[1:12:40] here
[1:12:41] and tune this piano same guy that goes
[1:12:44] over and retunes them over you know in
[1:12:46] other places in the cleveland areas goes
[1:12:48] into the halls and other places and
[1:12:50] tunes them and then we have guys that
[1:12:52] have to come in here and they have to
[1:12:53] look at this on the
[1:12:54] on the organ they try when the guy comes
[1:12:57] in here i've been here when he's done it
[1:12:58] that guy some of your brothers brother
[1:12:59] richard brother carlos you remember it
[1:13:01] before
[1:13:01] first time we had that guy come here
[1:13:03] about this tall he got behind that piano
[1:13:05] right there
[1:13:06] and the brothers were up there talking
[1:13:07] in the sunday school room he said
[1:13:09] pastor go tell them to be quiet please i
[1:13:12] need to hear because he don't turn by
[1:13:14] electronic he tunes by ear
[1:13:15] and his pitch he said no i need somebody
[1:13:18] to play that organ
[1:13:19] he tuned this to match that organ so
[1:13:22] that things would operate in a way he
[1:13:24] didn't want no
[1:13:25] even in this building he couldn't take
[1:13:26] any talking i started to whisper
[1:13:28] at that time
[1:13:33] he was tuning you know why you and i
[1:13:36] don't think about it we just come in
[1:13:38] here
[1:13:38] god is good all the time
[1:13:43] but you appreciate things being in tune
[1:13:45] don't you but
[1:13:47] because listen every once in a while
[1:13:50] that gets out of tune
[1:13:52] how bit not because kids are coming up
[1:13:54] here and beating on it
[1:13:56] it's because of use it just gets out of
[1:13:59] tune
[1:14:00] and sometimes you and i get out of tune
[1:14:04] and god has to come down and we're like
[1:14:06] oh lord
[1:14:10] be still and know i'm god
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:29] you see how terrible that would be for
[1:14:31] that to take place while we're in
[1:14:33] service what if we all came in here
[1:14:34] and we sat down tonight brother brian
[1:14:36] here that guy came up he walked right
[1:14:38] down and says hey
[1:14:39] i'm here to tune the piano you know what
[1:14:40] you'd look at and say you're here at the
[1:14:42] wrong time
[1:14:44] this is not the time to be tuning it
[1:14:46] it's a time it needs to be tuned
[1:14:48] because we need to use it right now
[1:14:50] that's how we
[1:14:52] have to look at our lives we need god to
[1:14:54] come down
[1:14:55] but we will in our lives individually in
[1:14:58] our walk with god
[1:15:00] god keep me tuned up lord i want to be
[1:15:03] so in tune
[1:15:04] with him to where like when a guitar
[1:15:06] needs to be tuned
[1:15:07] you can say brother brian strike a c on
[1:15:10] that guitar and brother brian does it
[1:15:12] and i say okay let me
[1:15:13] i'm tuning mine up i don't know how to
[1:15:14] do it but i'm tuning mine up because why
[1:15:16] his is in tune
[1:15:17] i said god let our lives be in tune that
[1:15:21] somebody else
[1:15:22] could have an effect upon their life
[1:15:24] that if it's out of tune
[1:15:25] it could get into this is what the love
[1:15:27] of god will do
[1:15:29] amen oh my god let me just let me start
[1:15:33] into
[1:15:34] another part here i'm just going to
[1:15:37] start here
[1:15:38] but i want you to look here at this part
[1:15:40] of the scripture
[1:15:42] it suffereth long is kind we just looked
[1:15:45] at that
[1:15:46] but charity envieth not
[1:15:51] it envies not this out of the amplified
[1:15:55] it is
[1:15:56] love never is envious
[1:16:00] nor boils over with jealousy
[1:16:06] doesn't do that now when you realize
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:12] from a gumpa in love when you take
[1:16:16] feeling of love which
[1:16:17] so love we have is you know between
[1:16:20] parents and
[1:16:21] children and philadelphia would be that
[1:16:24] of a
[1:16:25] brotherly love but we recognize that
[1:16:28] the love that we're to have for one
[1:16:30] another it's a love that's drawn
[1:16:32] from the love of god we draw from that
[1:16:34] strength
[1:16:36] even in situations that are very hard
[1:16:38] we're drawing
[1:16:39] from the love of god we're saying lord
[1:16:42] that fountain that i'm tapped into lord
[1:16:45] i need to draw
[1:16:46] from that fountain i need that fountain
[1:16:49] that's open in the house of david i need
[1:16:51] to know that
[1:16:52] i need to draw from that fountain that
[1:16:54] life lord that's within me
[1:16:55] i need to draw from it in this situation
[1:16:57] lord
[1:16:58] i need strength lord i need to look at
[1:17:00] this in the right way
[1:17:02] let me just tell you something god
[1:17:03] doesn't like actors
[1:17:06] the bible says i read to you let love be
[1:17:08] without dissimilation
[1:17:10] you know when you go to talk to him tell
[1:17:12] him what's on your heart
[1:17:14] yes if you feel like you've been wrong
[1:17:17] just say god
[1:17:18] this is killing me this is hurting me
[1:17:22] stay there don't just go tell him that
[1:17:25] stay there and say but god
[1:17:29] you took what was wrong in me and made
[1:17:32] it right
[1:17:34] you projected a love toward my life
[1:17:38] that passes all understanding
[1:17:41] lord i have been affected i've been
[1:17:44] changed by that love
[1:17:46] now lord this situation has arose
[1:17:50] change my thinking lord change my
[1:17:53] feelings lord lord you're stronger lord
[1:17:57] and able to dissolve
[1:17:58] that feeling in my life
[1:18:01] that part that wants to pull away i
[1:18:03] don't want to pull away
[1:18:05] i want to pull away lord i want to yield
[1:18:08] that note that you've given me it might
[1:18:09] only be a little eighth notes quick it's
[1:18:11] gone but
[1:18:12] i need to yield my life lord
[1:18:17] charity in these not but chad but this
[1:18:21] envy
[1:18:23] envy doesn't come from that of agape
[1:18:27] envy comes it can be associated with
[1:18:30] that of
[1:18:30] the filial love but the brand describes
[1:18:33] the difference between that of a
[1:18:35] we're a wife he said a man
[1:18:39] would would say something to her or
[1:18:40] flirt with her whatever more he said
[1:18:42] fellow love would cause you
[1:18:43] to rise up he said uh you know you'd
[1:18:46] want to he says
[1:18:47] you know shoot his brains out that's his
[1:18:50] words
[1:18:52] you i think you get the picture but
[1:18:54] agape in love would make you pray for
[1:18:55] him and
[1:18:56] you know as i've said that before it's
[1:18:57] not shoot his brains out then pray for
[1:18:59] him afterwards
[1:19:01] sometimes we pull the sick shooters out
[1:19:05] and then pray
[1:19:05] oh god lord forgive me for being such a
[1:19:09] good shot
[1:19:16] and sometimes you know before it's the
[1:19:18] face off at the old
[1:19:20] corral the shooting practice at home oh
[1:19:23] preach really saying
[1:19:26] you know hitting the target you got
[1:19:27] everything
[1:19:29] this is wrong this is
[1:19:33] what should i do leave the gun in the
[1:19:36] truck
[1:19:38] like the prophet when he walked through
[1:19:40] the pasture he didn't even know he left
[1:19:42] the gun in the truck when he faced the
[1:19:44] bull
[1:19:47] say god help me to rest on you
[1:19:50] as my defense and not be defensive
[1:19:56] he said i'm your sheep and buckler
[1:20:00] yes i'm your defense may just
[1:20:04] let me just pause right here with this
[1:20:06] on envy
[1:20:08] let me just leave this here and we'll
[1:20:10] just close on this tonight
[1:20:11] envy envy's a terrible thing
[1:20:17] it's a terrible thing envy itself
[1:20:21] you can never put in the own god
[1:20:25] but satan himself
[1:20:29] rose with envy in heaven
[1:20:35] not on the earth in heaven
[1:20:40] he wanted a kingdom more
[1:20:44] beautiful and bigger than michael's
[1:20:46] kingdom
[1:20:48] what prompted him to do what he did
[1:20:53] envy see out here it looked
[1:20:57] mine this it might have seemed something
[1:21:01] grandiose but it was envy look what envy
[1:21:03] did
[1:21:05] it brought rebellion it brought division
[1:21:09] envy is a horrible thing
[1:21:13] it begins inwardly in a life it can even
[1:21:16] be envy itself is something
[1:21:18] that can start but it's got to be
[1:21:20] attended to and let me just say this to
[1:21:22] you and i'm closing
[1:21:24] with in any of these parts here in any
[1:21:27] of these things
[1:21:29] there's a part about it where we can
[1:21:32] look at us and
[1:21:33] we want to be real reflected that's the
[1:21:36] only way we're really helped
[1:21:37] is to be able to say god help me
[1:21:44] well brother samuel but i when i read
[1:21:46] into this or
[1:21:47] you're ministering or i'm looking at
[1:21:48] this i feel like i've got to go so much
[1:21:51] taller
[1:21:52] i've been preaching from this i've been
[1:21:54] reading from this i've
[1:21:56] and you know what as i told you weeks
[1:21:58] ago every time when i look back over
[1:22:01] there's not a time i'm not challenged
[1:22:03] there's not a time that i'm not looking
[1:22:05] at a situation i'm just trying to tell
[1:22:07] you
[1:22:08] you never get to a place that you
[1:22:11] outgrow things
[1:22:12] bothering you but you can grow to a
[1:22:14] place
[1:22:15] to where you catch it and say i'm not
[1:22:17] going to let you
[1:22:19] continue any longer
[1:22:22] that's where discernment comes not i got
[1:22:25] this feeling no
[1:22:26] that's you're you've not lost you're not
[1:22:28] been defeated
[1:22:29] understand me you've not been defeated
[1:22:32] but remember
[1:22:33] overcoming is recognizing the devil
[1:22:37] at every one of his tricks
[1:22:40] don't worry one of these moments we're
[1:22:43] going to get the change that'll match
[1:22:44] the change on the inside
[1:22:47] and not only will there not be oh boy
[1:22:50] when we get to the side that person's
[1:22:52] going to be
[1:22:52] changed they won't be pushing my buttons
[1:22:54] your buttons won't be there either
[1:22:58] thanks be to god
[1:23:01] see this is why we need to be changed
[1:23:02] more than just young people brother
[1:23:03] shane
[1:23:04] we need to be changed but there's a
[1:23:07] there's a god who's working on the
[1:23:08] inside
[1:23:09] i believe i'm speaking tonight brother
[1:23:11] dave to delegates brother aaron
[1:23:12] of that city there are there are
[1:23:15] delegates of that new jerusalem
[1:23:18] that are received of that life that are
[1:23:19] represented do we have battles

[1:23:24] yes there's offenses
[1:23:26] are there trials sure there's trials is
[1:23:28] there
[1:23:29] is there adversity that wants to raise
[1:23:32] its head
[1:23:32] against this word that we're looking at
[1:23:35] tonight
[1:23:36] yes but i want to remind the devil
[1:23:39] greater
[1:23:39] is he that's in me than he
[1:23:43] that's in the world i used to live at
[1:23:45] that address
[1:23:47] i don't live in there no more
[1:23:50] god bless you let's stand
[1:23:54] amen brother brian or whoever's going to
[1:23:56] come and take the service
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:02] do you love him amen let's just
[1:24:06] let's just look to the lord in a word of
[1:24:08] prayer heavenly father
[1:24:12] lord jesus i know lord if i ask for
[1:24:15] hands throughout this building
[1:24:17] i'm certain lord hands would be lifted
[1:24:20] up
[1:24:21] my hands as well god fill me lord
[1:24:25] with more of your love lord jesus
[1:24:29] help me to be more sensitive more
[1:24:32] discerning lord
[1:24:34] lord as you put it tonight in a manner
[1:24:38] the lord tucked away with you
[1:24:41] to where that my life
[1:24:45] lord could be in tune that somebody else
[1:24:47] might be able to be helped
[1:24:49] and i certainly would want to be helped
[1:24:52] by my brother my sister lord
[1:24:54] we need one another lord we need one
[1:24:58] another
[1:24:59] lord truly right here
[1:25:02] and i don't mean just in this assembly
[1:25:04] but i mean among the bride body
[1:25:07] this is lord god where the love of god
[1:25:11] resides in the earth this evening
[1:25:17] lord god help us lord
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:21] lord jesus we're tested sometimes lord i
[1:25:24] know
[1:25:26] that we can lord in a place
[1:25:29] we can feel lord maybe a little down
[1:25:32] and i pray that god that you would help
[1:25:34] each and every one here this evening
[1:25:37] may they recognize lord of the strength
[1:25:40] of that inner man may they as paul would
[1:25:42] say
[1:25:43] put on that new man may they as we read
[1:25:46] put on
[1:25:46] as the holy as beloved holy elect of god
[1:25:50] vows of mercy
[1:25:52] help us lord i pray in our lives that
[1:25:55] god when situations and things arise
[1:25:57] tendencies maybe there's a tendency lord
[1:26:00] maybe
[1:26:01] for one to withdraw and there's a
[1:26:02] tendency for another to be able to try
[1:26:04] to get their point or their case across
[1:26:07] help us to realize lord that in either
[1:26:11] way help us lord
[1:26:14] we do not want to be of that where we've
[1:26:17] got to prove our point neither do we
[1:26:18] want to be of that lord god
[1:26:20] where it's just pulling away help us
[1:26:24] lord
[1:26:25] i realize lord that satan as your
[1:26:28] prophet he said it over and over
[1:26:30] it's realizing lord that it was the same
[1:26:32] way that satan wanted to try to come in
[1:26:34] among the ephesian church the galatian
[1:26:36] church
[1:26:36] the church in thessalonica on and on and
[1:26:38] on and on and on
[1:26:40] his objective was to try to break unity
[1:26:43] no wonder paul would write to us to
[1:26:46] endeavor that means to be strategic
[1:26:48] teaching
[1:26:49] endeavoring to keep the unity
[1:26:53] through the bond of peace help us lord i
[1:26:56] pray
[1:26:58] lord may we rely and rest upon you when
[1:27:01] situations arise
[1:27:03] may we really take it to you in prayer
[1:27:05] and may we not just lord leave it in
[1:27:07] prayer of complaining about it
[1:27:09] but may we take it to you and lord as
[1:27:12] we're there in prayer ask you to change
[1:27:14] us
[1:27:15] change my feelings toward it change my
[1:27:17] attitude
[1:27:19] lord god i don't want to leave out of
[1:27:21] this presence

[1:27:25] draw from the fountain lord god
[1:27:27] and i'm asking you lord jesus let my
[1:27:30] life be so
