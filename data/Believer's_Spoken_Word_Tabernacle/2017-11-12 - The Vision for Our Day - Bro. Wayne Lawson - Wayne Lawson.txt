Moses me all the doors yes Lou and more bad I need is to be with amen your boys Godspeed and like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know that you're in this place please let me stay in of God's grace O Lord as the brothers would come we want to go right into the lift in the mission offering this morning I don't want to take too much time away from the word of the Lord we certainly had us a wonderful time last night in the presence of God amen and to know that the Word of God is the word will not return back to him void and you know it just is one of those things that sometimes the Lord is so personal and so direct to maybe call out a need or a situation in your life and then there's other times where God knows it but he won't necessarily say it word by word but there's the current of the Holy Spirit coming by way of the word and if we yield to that it'll lift us then to where we're actually able to see things that we really have need of but we can't see it when we're there in that wonderful because we're made to see things not from this earthly realm but were born and made to see things from a heavenly realm David said in Psalms 27 when the Lord has set me upon this rock he said now now is my head lifted up and I can see all of this around me God's sovereign grace that moves for us to be able to see the things in the way that we need to see in amen Lord willing next next week next Sunday I'll take a little bit of time before the service and just two or before I'm minister and just share some things with you from the Philippines from the visitor and so you get to see some things as well as some things that are upon our heart that may be and if the Lord will allow us to actually get behind as an assembly on top of everything on top of the other things that we're doing as well and Lord willing as well next Sunday I have a stack of the things of Earth Paul sent over regarding the Spanish translation that's going on it has within there I'll have them out there next week it the the point and focus with it is it goes through and it gives you a little bit of a background on those who are actually translating the message into Spanish so you can kind of read a little bit within behind them catching that that burden and knowing that they're translating but that part of it that God has helped us to be able to be able to do in a small way is just to support the printing part of it that that would that would go forth of what they're translating that it gets out into the hands of the people so let's just let's just pray that that God would also would be merciful I also want you to keep in mind there's a situation that has taken place some of you don't aren't aware of it but with current news and things like that there is you remember some months ago that the the government of russia had rose up to where that it has been it's been about five six months ago the where that they actually had made a statement the where that they are eliminating everything to where it's just they want state recognized churches and they had declared even at that time that Jehovah Witness to be a cult and so you know where all those things lead to there's actually been a stoppage of books just some brothers had shared it with me of the day there's been a stoppage where they stopped some books of the message and tapes that have come into the country and right now they're looking into it if because if the government of russia declares that to be a cult and be out of line then they're gonna bail confiscate the churches and everything that is associated with a message it's all in God's hands and we just we want we want we know this is that there's not one thing can advance beyond God's timing and we're needs to advance so let's just would you keep that situation in prayer be be prayerful with that so let's just look to the Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are dear God for thee the opportunity Lord that you have given us to be able to gather here once again this morning Lord and father Lord there's truly Lord as you spoke to our hearts last night there is a fight that remains within us Lord a desire that Lord beyond all of the elements and everything that we see around this Lord is David so portrayed at Lord of where we stand in this ours the bride of Jesus Christ Lord we are surrounded but father what a wonderful place that we are in we're in the secret of your Tabernacle loin you have hidden us there Lord you've placed this their Lord and father how we thank you Lord for that great comfort and consolation that we draw from you loin being lifted in your presence I pray that God that Lord here as we lift this Lord little mission offering we just pray that God that you'll bless Lord each and every one of your children as they sacrifice the law to to give Lord and father we ask that you would take it Lord and multiply Lord direct it Lord God to the use Lord that father it would be beneficial and intended for Lord for the furtherance of your kingdom we pray Lord we love you and we thank you Lord and just ask that your presence would just continue to move in among us Lord in a real special way through the Word of God we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah just want to say that God bless you each every one of the visitors that were able to be here with us we certainly enjoyed you being here with us and trust that you just have been refreshed and amen and we're looking for the for the Lord just to come by our way once again this morning and to speak to us what MA we'd be so miserable if we came here without expectation you know but when we come here with an expectation from the Lord week we can have that confidence that God is going to speak to us you know sometimes there's things that God will say that it might be things that we have we know and we can go right down we can go right down the line you might be able to finish the quote or the scripture afterwards but that's not that's not why we're here in church we're here that we can have that discernment of the Lord to say Lord where is this at in my life where can I receive help how does this fit how does this apply to me Lord where do I fit within this because this is truly an hour of divine placement by the Spirit of God in that true amen so we have that that confidence that God is moving and working amen right here amen to do what he alone can do I want to say also the brothers they were in here this week and they took full advantage of us not being here on Thursday and they sanded down and brother Richie put both of these sets of windows in and they sanded down they painted the sanctuary I think they have one more place maybe back in the back here that they have to paint but I think they did just a wonderful job don't you really we reach Thrones we certainly appreciate that amen let's just let's stand if we could and we'll just just invite brother Wayne to come on let's keep singing that song word of god speak Amen this is our desire Lord finding myself at a loss for words and the funny thing is it's all the last thing I need yes to be [Music] what you would say [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man that's a that's her heart's desire this morning isn't it a man that the Word of God would speak to our lives and amen where what would be B this morning if the Lord hadn't spoke to us amen when we amen we're going our own ways and doing our own thing but God who is rich in mercy huh I appreciate that scripture as Paul wrote it that we were dead in sins and trespasses but God but God who is Richard mercy He Man I'm so glad that he spoke to our lives and this morning we're trusting that he'll you'll do it again amen and we want to say God bless you and to you that we're here last night while we sure enjoyed ourselves and the presence of the Lord we want to thank you for your your support and their pool for the word of the Lord and and we just I tell you Sunday mornings to be honestly it's my favorite service of the week I enjoy Sunday morning service amen and it's always a blessing I I didn't recognize last night that we have brother Jerry with us god bless you both it's been a long time god bless you it's good to see you man my I don't know how long it's been but it's it's been a few years 14 15 years amen yeah and so it's just been a real pleasure to see you again god bless you and amen and so we won't - this morning if we can to turn to the book of John and we're going to look in the fifth chapter here you know that this is the this is the scripture here where Jesus has been at the Pool of Bethesda and he done a strange thing he healed one man there was a lot of people there at the pool they just healed one man and then the scripture says that he tells him to take up his bed and walk and on top of that this is a Sabbath day so it's a little bit questionable again of why he's healing on the Sabbath and if you study the scripture you know it's amazing that Jesus actually does seven miracles on seven Savas so he was always upsetting the the cart for the for the legal assigned he was just tearing up their thoughts and and but in the in the seventeenth verse we find that they're they're asking Jesus and Jesus answers and he says but jesus answered them saying my father worketh hitherto and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because not had only he had broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father making himself equal with God then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father doeth for that things whatsoever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise a man let's just bow our hearts this morning Heavenly Father we're so thankful today for the word that you have given and Lord we're just asking you this morning that your presence Lord would just fill the room today Lord the hearts and the lives that have gathered here under your word may you touch them if there's one here today that don't know you lord I pray that you would be merciful to them father if there's some here today that have been distant in their relationship I pray that they would draw nigh to you today I ask you Father for your children that have gathered in this meeting today that may you give them the bread of life may you feed them Lord the the meat that's in due season and may you strengthen their resolve to serve you and love you and I pray that you build them up in the faith of God I ask you today Lord that you would heal the sick Lauren that you would touch them in their bodies that have need and we ask that you would bless them bless they hear of your word today father we'll commit this service into your hands asking you for these things in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord we pray a man and a man and and may God bless you as you be seated today I want to to speak to you on this portion of Scripture and if I would title the the sermon today I want to speak to you upon a vision for our day a vision for our day and and I've just just some things here that I appreciate the Lord for what he's done in our generation and we thank God for the word that has been delivered in in our time and and what God has done in other ages is wonderful and we love to talk about it but there's something special about seeing what had God is doing in your generation and and to see what what part you're playing I was just looking at the scriptures and realizing that many times I don't know if we always think about it but but the the Bible itself is actually of look of visions many of the things that you read in the Bible is actually visions and either it was visions of that time or visions of the future and so but but the Bible itself is a book of visions and it's the answer that Jesus is giving to the people that was asking him about his healing on the Sabbath and about him healing this man and and when they start asking him his answer to them is that I see it with my father then I do it so he's letting them know that his actual ministry was a ministry of vision so Jesus wasn't just doing whatever thing that he wanted to do with the power of God he was using the power of God to fulfill a vision or the will of God that was set forth in his life now maybe sometimes you know you hear people say well if Jesus if God is alive and he and he heals the sick we'll go down to the hospital in E all the hospitals program said you've got to be careful with that because you see that there's never been a ministry in the Bible that used the power of God at their wheel it was always the will of God that controlled the power if you see that Jesus that was the proposition that to him he said cast yourself down you up again he propositioned him to use the power of God for his own weal and so what we find is that there is a wheel or there is a vision and that vision is the is the purpose of God for the generation or the time that someone lives or what it is that they're doing so so when I start finding that the Scriptures are some strange things happening and they're strange things that we believe today is odd to the to the natural mind but as Jesus said in that day it's because of the vision that we have and that vision has come from the father so that so the Bible itself is a book of visions and and if you sometimes you think about our Lord when when the strange things that he would do and and you look at this generation of the strange things that's happening but it's because of the vision of God when when you look in the Bible and you think about how that the Scripture speaks of visions and and I'll just say maybe like this sometimes things happen differently than then that we think they ought to happen but if it's if it's within the vision of God when Jesus just described one action maybe that he had when when can you imagine one of you being great friends with Christ and he eats at the house of Mary Martha very very commonly and I can imagine that there was times that Lazarus would sit there and hear the stories and he would speak to them on a personal level being friends and one day Jesus has gone from the house and and Lazarus fall sick and Mary Martha think immediately we're we're friends with the Prophet we'll just send word and he'll come here and he'll Lazarus and everything's going to be okay but when the word went to Jesus that Lazarus was sick rather than him coming he turned and went a four-day journey from the problem looking like that he was walking away from the problem hey man but do you see but the reason that he did it is because that there was a vision of a resurrection amen and and if Jesus had have been there that would have been no death but he had to he had to make a journey and go away that that that death could come that when he returned that could show the power of Resurrection and the amazing that Jesus was never late but when he when he came remember that Martha began to tell him lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't died and and Jesus said but Martha even even now and we know the troubles is there but but I am the resurrection and the life and and when Christ was standing there remember remember the the way that Martha when she would have spoke to him Lord I know he'll raise up in the last day but Jesus was trying to to make sure they understood that he was the resurrection not that he was going to be coming but that he is the resurrection amen and and he said to them he meant that Martha even now right now all I have to do is call for his life and you remember the scripture that he actually says to him with a loud voice Lazarus come forth amen and and so because of the vision the way that Jesus follows the vision they're able to see that he is the resurrection they're they're able to see that because of the vision because of the way that he did it now they're going to see that he's the master over corruption is that right amen corruption had already set in on the body had had corruption not Citian they would not know he was the master of it but because corruption had set him it was in the vision that not only would last was rise but Martha would know that God had the power over corruption amen and Jesus could not not not only is his Lazarus already corrupted but he's already a four-day journey from the body he meant so so you see there has to be an anointing under that vision that could bring life back to the body it could bring a man who's for days gone from the body and bring him back into that into that body he meant all at the spoken word all because Christ called for it to happen can you imagine what it was like down there in paradise when Lazarus heard the call of the Lord that he's to come back to that body he meant everybody else sitting around him there was other people there that he even been fellowship maybe his old friends and everything he said y'all I hear the master calling and they did not hear what he heard because it was not a time for a general resurrection but it was a time for a name calling hey men that one name would be called and that it would answer the Masters call it was in the vision Amen that there would not be just a general resurrection but that would be a one-man resurrection because you see the things that were done in that time in that vision was only putting a shadow of things that was going to be happening in other ages they meant that that would come a time that it would not be a general resurrection amen but that will be an individual resurrection in the last days it will not be everybody raising from the dead but it'll be them whose names are being called is that right so so you can see that Christ by vision was doing the will of God that he might show forth his power that he might show forth what he was and what he does in written in the Bible that there's coming a time that he will show forth who is the only king of kings and the Lord of lords hidden in it spoken of that there was coming a time that he was show that he is God and I believe that the Bible said in the last days he would reveal himself as the son of man he would reveal himself in the evening time people said by the way why is it got so bad why is the trouble the way it is why is the situation's of the world how did God ever let it get like it is now he had to show forth who is the only king of kings and the Lord of lords and the god of might until all of the revival is gone and the denominational world you don't recognize the revival that God has brought by this message payment but he's the master of corruption he said I'll not leave your soul in hell and I will not leave you in corruption but there's come a word in this generation by vision Amen the call us out of the dead dark denominationalism and bring us back because he's the master of the corruption he's the one who can overcome it and bring us out into life and I think God this morning Haven some of my family didn't hear the voice and and some of my friends didn't hear the voice but I heard my name my name called the master called me and I come out of the grave and when I come forth but I I want you to know this morning God was not just satisfied with Lazarus coming to life he meant but it was also in the vision that he would be loosed is that right Lusine and let it go though there's a vision concerning Lazarus that was a type of it concerning you that this generation this bride has come out of dark denominationalism will not just come out to sit in a message pew and be abound continue and live your life under the jealousies and ideas and businesses and churchianity Amen I think it's time maybe that we come face to face with the reality that something is paulus to life and and whatever that is that brought us a lie Amen it's not animation that she would be bound up this morning remember the vision says she will be loosed and be set free haven of all the great closer I pray God this morning but like whatever it is has bound up your life and the Holy Ghost were coming this meeting this morning and bags you by the Holy Ghost that you can rejoice and you can enjoy the things of God I don't believe Christianity is just a bunch of humdrum and and barely making it and we're barely getting by Oh bless God pastor we're we're barely making it these days listen I believe that there's a power of God that's in the Church of the Living God and we're not just merely Amen but I believe somebody's going back into glory we're not returning to heaven in defeat Adam and Eve left in defeat but we're returning in victory as a vision of you this morning in victory and power and reality or I tell you it's time to lose some let him go amen I believe that don't you if you're married to somebody and they had to repent and they come back to the Lord Amen don't know don't hold them to that the rest of their life lose some and let them go let let the Spirit of God come over their lives let him enjoy the fellowship of the Lord and and let them come in and rejoice and the power of God I'll tell you this morning I believe there's a vision of a powerful church a church alive a church with movement Amen if it's dead bury it hey man if it's dead bury that you love my brother man said twice dead and plucked up a man twice man I always wonder what brother man meant by twice then I'll tell you what it is hey man it was already dead and then some preacher come along he killed it hey man I'll tell you what it it's enough degeneration but you know amen I don't believe that the ministry are to be appreciate against worship I don't think the ministry ought to be preaching against the Holy Ghost move of the church I think if they're if there's any church sin order or to have some power in it I believe it's the bride of Jesus Christ if there's any church they don't have some movement in it it's a church that's alive but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I think there were to be some ministers of God that's got enough sand in them they meant to stand up for the power of God and the Church of the Living God that there's a manifestation in this hour I think God this morning for good pastors I thank God for brother Samuel Browning Haven a man of God a man that will stand by this anointed word in this generation and and I believe y'all to get around him and lift him up among the Church of Living God and stand with a man that will present the word and such truth in this hour they met you you know I know it seems like a strange thing but see it's a part of your vision it's a part of the vision of the church when you when you start understanding you know if you if you study the ministry but brother Branham you're going to find out brother branham's ministry was a ministry of vision do you realize that brother Branham many times when brother Branham says things brother Ram is not just telling stories but he's telling you vision you know that when he teaches that the white wigged one of Revelations wand he teaches him as the judge do you know that he actually asks theologians why Jesus had white hair in that scripture and they said it was because they his maturity brother man said something didn't ring a bell he said but now he don't tell it to later in the skin the scripture not in the church age but later he said I walked in one morning praying about it he said there he stood in a white wig he's seen the vision of Jesus wearing a white wig and come back and told us the revelation that judgment was given unto him and the wig was placed upon him and we didn't know it now until the last days that the angels were his very wig hey men they were the one that made the wig upon him and put him in judgment amen now the Bible said he come forth with his angels in judgment then so there's there's a lot of beauty here when a prophets able to see it you know I don't know but many times you think about the Garden of Eden do you know when water from the rock brother BAM tells us that he saw the Garden of Eden in vision and wanted from the rock and why he's preaching brother man there so if there's a 1955 believers while he's preaching he's coming along preaching he's talking about Calvary and he begins to talk about how that Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden and remember he says I see him leaving the garden now I see them wrapped in goat skins and sheep skins he said and I hear it slapping their legs and see the blood draining down the leg of Adam he said Adam didn't have to leave the garden but he left the garden for Eve and I see them walking out together he's sitting out the scene has changed and I see Jesus Christ walking up the hill of Golgotha I see a bloody garment upon him he said he's wearing a white garment remember he said one spotted blood he said there's another spot another spot he said it's made agree he said I now see the blood dripping down his legs I hear the sound of the cross as it drops across the rocks thump pump pump going up the hill amen you see brother man the next service brother Ram comes along and he says remember last night when the inspiration come he said I was in the envisions amen he was actually see the vision while he was preaching to the people of what was going on in the Garden of Eden and at Calvary he meant to recognize he meant that what we have experienced in the age that we're living in is were not here this morning by a chance so we're not here just guessing or but trying to figure out but there's a vision concerning the Church of the Living God in this age and William Brennan saw that vision and took it to the Bible and showed you all over the scripture that this vision was seen by Moses it was seen by Elijah it was seen by malachite was seen by Ezekiel amen every prophet in the Bible saw the vision of our generation and wrote of it in the Bible and here we are this morning wondering how are we going to do this brother how are we gonna live it Samuel how are we gonna overcome this are you kidding me you're gonna overcome this because it's a vision of the old magic pod has come this morning to anoint you and place you in the age that you're living here somebody's gonna recognize that's me daddy that's that's me mama I'm in the vision when I think about it today I think about the visions of God that's been placed upon our lives and and what's being fulfilled you know it's one thing for one person to have a vision about you but when all the prophets had visions about you hold on when all of the prophets had visions about you know I don't have time I guess I can go through this Bible and show you every vision ever that every prophet did have a vision about you but if you go back in the scriptures and you start noticing that it's in proverbs 29 and 18 with a Bible well the greatest and wisest men in the Bible he says where there is no vision the people perish where there is no vision the people perish now if you feel like you're perishing this morning is because you've not recognizing the vision you're not realizing that there's a vision for your life amen but but but see real power the source of real power comes from vision that's that's the source of your power that's the that's the source of the faith that you have that's where perfect faith comes from but man said if I can see the vision he said there's nothing can keep me from that remember when he goes out there and and there's there's a boy in Finland you remember he tells it years before it happens and when he goes to Finland and there's a dead boy laying in front of him now you don't get a greater challenge than that as a preacher Amen the blood of life is gone from the child it it's it's it's past hope it's it's in the realm of impossibility amen brother man said I walked away from it that's how bad it was he walked away from it as a man as a preacher he walked away from it but there was something draw his attention back to the scene amen and when he draw back to the scene he didn't see the negative anymore he looked at the rocks he looked at the trees he looked at the car and the negative turn to a positive because he knew the end of the story by vision I tell you if all you can see is the problems of this age and the troubles of this age you are a most miserable person but if you can ever see it's a part of the vision it's Society of the rapture but in the middle of all of this there's going to be a resurrection of the voice of a prophet of God and look and see brother man said when I saw where I was standing the rest of it was drama I'll tell you I could never get I could never get tired of telling that the rest was drama y'all know what drama is it's when there's a part to be played it's already written and it's how it's gonna happen and brother man said he already seen himself kneeling brother man that hurt the words he would say before he ever said him he saw the child raised up before he ever raised all he had to do was just step into that vision and fulfill what he had already saw and the powers they're not brother branham's power but the power of God was there to fulfill the vision that was written and sing before he ever come to it I'll tell him said when I said thus saith the Lord rise up child he said they nothing could stop it then I read there ain't nothing can stop it then they met and when you when you recognized he meant that unstoppable resurrection power of Almighty God may I'll just tell it to you like this they tried to stop us amen everything has tried to stop us denominations to realism forces and fights and Church arguments everything is trying but it ain't work mainly they stopped you amen because there is in the nineteenth upon our lives that's an unstoppable anointing and brother man said you can stop the Sun before you can stop this ride you cannot stop this ride well I'll tell you what there's a vision of it it's she's unstoppable but mem said she ain't gonna be stopped I'll tell you what Amon I can I just preach to you minute hey man she's an unstoppable force I'll tell you what's wrong sometimes brother we give him the devil a piggyback ride that's right we give him the devil a piggyback ride if you never tried to ride somebody's back that wouldn't bend over they meant you you you you know when you was a little kid and you had buddies and you're gonna fight you know you jump on one back and guy jumps on the other than you ride away well your buddies always bend over and give you a nice hey then you jump on there and they walk around kinda but as you ever try to get on somebody's back they don't want you on their back Amen you know what he meant let me say to you like this it's hard to ride the back of a man that won't bend over and I think it's time that the Bride of Christ quit bending over amen but it's time to pull your shoulders back and tell the devil you ain't riding me you're not riding me even I believe this morning but there's a bride here that in the vision he didn't see the devil on your back but in the vision he saw the devil under your feet that's an overcoming power this morning in the vision of God Satan and son to the feet of the pride of Jesus Christ there's an anointing you say brother you act like the devil ain't nothing let me tell you if you can see the devil out of the eyes of God he is an adversary but he said defeated adversary you see you recognize that that that's where the power comes from it's the power of the vision what's brother man when he spoke that that little boy that boy raised up from the dead because the vision said he would amen and nothing's gonna stop that I'll tell you what they ain't nothin gonna stop you either and in the vision the devil ain't riding on your back he's under your feet so you tell the devil to get his own ride home this morning we might have wrote you the church but he don't have to ride you home he mighta roads you to the service but I tell you right now you ought to tell the devil get off devil you ain't did not beat God didn't like me to give the devil a ride y'all didn't give me this ministry that I carry a spirit with me and put the people under bondage and under legalism but but he gave us some ministry that we would be able to lift the children of God into the position of where God anointed them to be I'll tell you what he made you to be made you to be sons and daughters of God he never put you in a position to put one another down he never put you in the position to they tried to deflate one another he puts you in a position to lift your brothers to lift your sisters until the devil don't have no place to get in [Applause] no reason Todd I say get out of the way devil we're gonna have church this morning and many don't make no difference amen I don't know about you but I come to the house of God to enjoy the Word of God to worship I think people give the devil too much credit I think people give the devil too much credit I think I think you give him too much credit I think it's time to the right of crisis go ahead and pull your shoulders back say no more that's it who says it's that easy it's that easy it's that easy cuz you're the boss come on I know I said it hillbilly style but brother brems said you're the master of every circumstance you're the boss it's your origin to master the circumstance your own impotent with God but man said the doctors are limited man is limited but God is unlimited and when a man finds out who he is in God then that man is unlimited that's an omnipotent power resting in the church right now right now right now we are the sons of God we're not gonna pay we are right now and that's an anointing on your life to smash the enemy do you know that the very anointing on you is to smash the enemy it's written of you in Genesis the third chapter he said the woman seed shall bruise the head of the serpent that's right in the surface bruise the heel of the woman's seed that's that's you got to recognize that the only thing that devil conduce bruise your heel then he's limited in what he can do to you God has already put limits you can only what what would he'll when he attack job the greatest attacked in the Bible but God put a limit on him you can't never forget the devil is a limited enemy he can only do what God lets him do and whatever God lets him do you already been equipped to overcome whatever he is you don't know you can but I'm telling you this sport and God knows more about you and you know about yourself you think you're about to fall apart you're about to fall under the law but I say you're just getting ready to be a ripping even but get ready to really overcome my Moses didn't know what he had in him till God took the spirit off of him and put it on 70 men and he still had the power gone gods put enough in you to take what's on you and put it on 70 other women and you still overcome oh yes sir you're more than enough see you got to recognize that this comes from God this is not what we're doing if you're doing it yourself then you're in trouble but if this is a vision the devil's in trouble is that right that's why brother man said watch out devil watch out devil cuz this one this was a word pride this is not just another denomination not just another church this is a word pride but men said see she won't fail like that first he did I always didn't understand that I didn't get the secret of it brother man said later he said the secret of it is that the word is in the bride he said that first Eve could fall from the word but the second Eve can't because she is the world she came close she is the word they meant were not riding the Bible we're not riding books but the books have wrote about you it's a fulfillment of the manifestation of what the Bible is spoken about in that age hey man people think I'm odd they may think I'm different but let me tell you there's a vision about this age and that's the answer to our prince it's a vision and when you when you look at this and first Kings you'll find the story is written of Elisha who exhibited great power over 400 prophets of Balaam one of the greatest showdowns in the Bible was when Elijah faced off 450 prophets of Bale and he done it according to the Bible by a vision Elijah would have never challenged the devil on his own merits Elijah would have never challenged 450 prophets on his own merits he meant but he knew where he was standing with God by a vision because in the 36 vs. 18 chapter the Bible says I have done these things at thy word they meant what what kind of what kind of what kind of tenacity what kind of strength what kind of of resolve has a man got with a vision I'll tell you the county has he has the kind to walk right up in the face of a king have you ever thought about how did Elisha get in to talk to a king you just decide you're gonna go talk to President Trump tell me how that goes for you you can think anything you want you go down and try to talk to him you're gonna find out there's a lot of channels you got to go through and then you still might not talk to him he meant but when God told Elijah to go talk to AB he just walked up and talked to him don't think that that's mate don't think it was any different than it is now that King was protected a protection protection protection attention but listen my God can open doors my god can open door say man he meant you you see when I lied you got ready to go talk to AB he had the word of the Lord you just went told him I'm shutting up the heavens now three and a half years is gonna be I mean rain come until I call for it any of us would have called that arrogance but it wasn't arrogance he knew who he was he knew what he was doing there and he noticed what my idea of this comes from God so he was not there in arrogance he was there in assurance of who he was and what his job was with God you see what he done he he actually did that the Bible said that he lived in the time and that the god of bail was worshipped more than the god of Jehovah they had put high places ever high place had a temple you you see in the scripture said even a.m. the Bible talks about was the worst King because he even rebuilt though that gates to Jericho whom Joshua Kersey it was a horrible time it was a horrible situation but God called Elijah to show them that God still has power he come to humble them God has power over the heavens and over the earth you may think you're in power but you're not in power listen friends I don't care what any man thinks or says God always had power there's nothing out of control that's nothing out of order that's more than you you may think everything is just maybe you're just barely getting there and maybe think listen God had Daniel stand and tell it King Amen before it ever happened how his kingdom came how he was gonna lose his kingdom he told him the ruling kingdoms for the next for the next millennia of how that the world would be possessed in the battles of those possessions he told us who would rule and what time they would rule can you think that God is not lost control he knew exactly who would be ruling he knew exactly how things are going to be Amen so God already knows now watch when God actually calls Elijah to tell them he's he invites him up to a to a mountain to heaven to have a showdown and Elijah is a gentleman he tells him look I'll tell you what you do you take your 450 prophets and y'all build an altar and put a Bullock on it and don't put any fire under it and he said I'll do the same and he said whoever's God answers my fire will serve that God now the reason he chose to answer my fire cause Paul tells us the secret he says our God is a consuming fire so Elijah knew they didn't have the power to bring down that fire that that power come from God so he actually he was a real gentleman because you know what it lied you actually let him go first you read the scripture and find out Elijah to let him go first and Elijah give them all day long Elijah said y'all go ahead and take the whole church ages I'll just take right here at the back hand back no go ahead and take the whole day long amen and y'all do what you want now but as the as the evening Sun begin to show up and the daylight begin to disappear and Elijah got bolder and bolder he got more bold and more blown as the day went on because he began to say to him what's the matter with you God as he is he cannot hear maybe you shouldn't yell louder he's on vacation or something something's happening your God's not answering here you're doing the talking but there's no answer coming back and and Elijah begin to make fun it wasn't arrogance it was he knew who he was he was not making fun of God he was making fun of their ridiculous ideas of God and any begin to grow stronger and stronger and watch what he done he began to say to them well you know good they maybe you should they cut themselves and they danced and they've done everything they could do but there was no fire there was no fire come and being the gentleman that he was he give him all day long and he said when it when the evening time come he said now this is my time because what Elijah knew that they didn't know is Elijah could have built that altar at noon and wouldn't be no fire he meant but Elijah knew that the the fire would come in the evening knew the fire was coming in the evening listen listen friends the Bible said that in the evening time there shall be alive what light is that that's the same light that led the children of Israel that's the same lie statement that appeared over the river with John in Jesus that's the same light that returns from the end time that brings the Church of the Living God in the faithful Chevy lights in the evening times you see when Elijah built his older look what he done he built it in the correct timing with God I'll tell your friends if you ever see God's timing amen the devil that devil don't have no chance because you see this is your time to move he meant you see that was time sense maybe it wasn't the right time but when it becomes time that's when you defeat every enemy you look at what happens when when Elijah begins to build that altar he builds the altar and he builds it out of the Bible said he took stones one for all the tribes he took wood and then he took flesh has any of you ever tried to burn a no mule or cows just burn it on the fire he don't burn very good you know way down south we have a we have a funny saying saying he could burn a wet mule with hundred-dollar bills now you know a man's rich if he can do that because it takes a lot of it takes a lot of fire to burn out to burn an offering but you but you watch what happens is is Elijah seemingly has built an offering that would not burn according to the mind of man Elijah's offering will not burn stone don't burn flesh don't burn the only combustible part of his anointing or his system was the wood that he placed there when he placed the wood upon the altar look what he does he goes and gets water and he don't just poured on the offering but he goes and digs a trench around his offering and and he says bring me four barrels of water and pour it on this offering now now now you're gonna get in just one idea weight loss and I'm not preaching this for doctrine then I'm putting this out in front that's just my opinion he meant but I always wondered why in the world would brother Branham why would Elijah pour so much water on that altar I always wondered why and I just studied maybe maybe it's right maybe it's wrong but it's just good for thought they met but you see what would happen if a fire came and then that evening one of them bail profits come up there and said well whatever happened was our God started that fire and now Elijah is just getting off of the reputation that he's acting like he's won it done kind of like our presidents you know he meant but you know they always blame it or accept it from the other president and you see but what's what Elijah does under the wisdom of God he pours water on everything he puts so much water on it there's got one strange fire on the altar that he spilled there there's no strange fire there at all Haman it's no fire from any of their ages maybe I said to you like this he put out all the fires he meant just in case see there's no Baptist anointing on that altar there there's no Pentecostal anointing on that altar there's no denominational he put out everything maybe he was sure you know it's dad it's dad this is a dead altar there's nothing here at all amen and there won't be till I call for it Oh [Music] sometimes we wonder why God put all the lights out why why did the Baptists lights go out why did the Pentecostal lights go out why did all the lights go out he wanted you to know what it was to not have a light hey you see hey man what's that in that cave when the little boy standing there with his sister and the man says they meant without lied in this cave it's the darkest place you can live and the man turns the lights off of the little girl screams what she gets a stark reality of how dark things really are but her brother says to her don't worry little sister there is a man here that can turn on the lights you see why brother man must show the darkness of the age he wasn't showing that darkness to to bring us into a negative he was showing us the darkness to let us know what it would be without this messy where would she be this morning without a license ministry we would be in the darkness of Laodicea but that angel draw a little light in the pattern he meant remember now he stood back from the altar and said according to that word according to that word Lord he said let the fire fall on this and the Bible said the fire came down on that altar and it consumed the wood and it consumed the stone and it consumed the water and it consumed the flesh amen it consumed everything brother Kevin it assumed everything you see on Elijah's altar there is a fire that is an all-consuming fire amen but that's where Zachary in the book of in the book of Samuel there were judges that when Gideon is talking to the angel remember he's talking to an angel and he don't know if that angels just an old man with a stick or not so he says if God be with us were some miracles and he goes and builds a fire or it goes him puts an altar and he put some meat on the altar and the man that was there had a stick and just touched it and fire consumed the altar if you're at an altar of God there is a fire hold the altars of God there's a fire on the altars of God listen for him this morning we have an altar the world don't know about we got an altar you can come to Amen that will consume everything you can bring only listen this morning you don't have to live with habits in your life Amen a person you don't have to be here this morning that's a cigarette smoker and think oh I wish I could get over it and I'm gonna chew this gum and this and that listen I serve a God and if you can come to his altar and you can sacrifice your life there's a fire that will come out of heaven burn everything out of your life he said God this morning that can consume the habits of our life he can take the things that have so so disgraced you listen for him this morning I don't believe you had to live with these things I really don't I want Christian that believes in clean living I believe in the grace of God but I believe in clean living but I don't believe you can clean yourself up I don't believe you can make yourself clean I believe there's a fire from God that's the coming clean are you not clean the way God made you clean amen this much idea of legalism ain't done nothing but make a bunch of hypocrites out of the church but if there's a desire in your heart amen be open with that desire and cut before the Lord and let the fire of God come down and make you a clean man make you a free man make you a loose man he's got a fire this morning let her consume everything is that right is a consuming fire he's a consuming God he can make a man so free this morning I'll tell you friend we're not having denominational alders here there's a fire of God on this altar a man used to Mullane how do you know I've been to the altar a man it wasn't in this church but that's Paul said we have an altar that they don't know about amen we have an altar that they don't know about it's an altar of God where the fire comes down when that fire comes think of this now because immediately he meant immediately when this fire comes it's there were Elijah Amen rise us up and tell say HAP you go get something to eat and drink because I hear the sound of the abundance of rain I tell you what a powerful thing when a prophet announces rain they meant in animation at the same time the fire came it's the same time that the denomination of prophets were proved wrong it's the same time that a rain in abundance was coming on the earth he meant you don't think this vision wasn't speaking of another generation another time Amen when they evening sacrifice under Elijah's ministry disproving denominational ideas at the same time he announced rain is coming upon the earth you go eat and drink a member but rain is coming and they go up on the mountain and the old prophet is tired and weary and he puts his head between his legs and tells his servant go look seven times remember go look seven times because he went look the first time and he went looked he said do you see any rain he said I don't see nothing at all and he come back to the Prophet and tried to tell him I don't see that and he said you ain't looking right go look again you go look seven times to your vision lines up with God's wish amen you see things can be happening that you don't see things can be taking place that you don't eat in here as he said you just keep looking Haman don't you look at this message one time and say I've learned it all but you keep looking till you see the revival that God is sent upon the earth you keep looking till at the grace of God comes in your life you see what he said he said you go look seven times nother what you keep looking till you see something and finally the man come back and said Elisha hacia a cloud I see it coming up out of the sea it's about the size of a man's hand what much to go home it wasn't much of a point to make but when Elijah heard that amen the prophet of God said the old prophet become refreshed because he's seeing the moving of the supernatural see he knew man didn't put that cloud apparent he knew his word put that cloud apparent and the first move the first move of the supernatural set human action no adult prophet I tell y'all think we're a little bit you think we're a little bit wiring crazy the preachers all jumping around you already been up there that more of that prophet that old man he been sitting there his bald head and his mantle around him Bible said he was Haman and sitting there was man around him and when he be when he heard the noise of that cloud out there from his service you know what the Bible says he says he stood up refreshed but men said we movie must have been refreshed because he was an old man and he outrun the chariots of Ahab down to the city of hey you see what he does he got so full of the stimulating power of the Holy Ghost that he's an old man standing up and he takes off running down the hillside with everybody watching him ray p'mote Church I'm telling you right can you imagine what it was like that morning ray sister when it starts raining God sends rain it's not just a little drip drop God sends abundant rain God sends abundant rain to our lives that wasn't even anything there there was nothing there was no rain in the sky the only sign of rain was a little cloud but when that prophet of God become under a refreshing come on it's written in the Bible that we refreshing in the last stage and it comes from the presence of God and it odd that that word presence means face and there's actually been a cloud appeared in this age in the face of Jesus Christ and when a prophet of God saw it he become refreshed and told you all it's the coming of the Lord hello friends back cloud was not a corporal coming but it was the sign of the coming of the day we're going to see that clapping by that cloud the first move of seven seals right in the wire to the church what was it it was the prophecy of Joel chapter 2 I will pour out my spirit saith the Lord and it will be both the former and the latter rain in the last days saith the Lord you see what that former rain was a teaching rain the latter rain is a is a rapturing faith that comes from that plane and you know fall in the same season oh don't you tell me we need a return ministry we need somebody to believe this we need somebody to believe this message we need to believe what God has sent to us to that mother I tell you what I think it's amazing they went from nothing to abundance they didn't have nothing and then they had everything they had no rain they had abundant get the barrels out he said get the barrels out Haman he meant before I spoke there was nothing now there's everything you see what Elijah's ministry does it takes you for nothing and brings you into abundant revelation into abundant grace [Applause] what the bible does teach us amen the Bible teaches us great things it teaches us that under the ministry lots of things change quick to me and sitting in a gate there lepers is that right thanks things are bad in the city God lets you know how bad it was that one woman build another one's baby and they ate it and the next day they were supposed to build the other woman's baby and eat it that's how bad it was in the city now you can spend all day focusing on the bat if you want to amen but let's move another chapter let's move another verse and let's read the king went to Elisha and begin to telling the trouble and while he was telling the trouble he said I hear what you're saying but by this time tomorrow he meant by this time tomorrow that will be through to plenty that wouldn't be abundance among you a man who was leaning up against the door heard Elijah's prophecy of abundance and begin to laugh and Elisha said to him said you're gonna see it but you won't get to taste it is that right and the very next morning before daylight two lepers are sitting at the gate and they're sick and there's an entire army out there besieging the city and they can't go out and they can't come in and then they're at the gate and they're about to die and one looks at another and says why do we sit here till we die Amen why I let fear make us Senate the gate why let fear be between two opinions he said let's just go out and see what we find payment in the middle of the night God had caused the rustling out of the desert and those Syrians thought that there was something coming to capturing and they got up and left and the entire army left their spools and those lepers come up on the camp they went from nothing brother - to the spools of an entire army under the Ministry of Elijah [Applause] you got the Ministry of Elijah you got everything come on you you can read about a shooter Batwoman you can read about a widow a winner there you can read about how a little widow woman down there and Sarah path she was out of barrel she was out a meal in her barrel the Bible said and what did she say when Elijah asked her what are you doing what are you doing and she said I'm gonna cook a cake and me and the boy are gonna die what are they gonna do they're going to perish and unless Elijah would come the whole earth will die with a curse the whole thing will perish according to Amos II a chapter that's a famine that will strike the land not for food and wine but for the hearing of the word of God but without a vision we will all perish but the same Bible that said there was a famine coming and said I'll send them to you Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord [Applause] abundance was prophesied with a curse at the same time payment as prophesied there is the prep for prophecy of abundance what'd he say - he said you go and make yourself them cakes he said but you make one for me first and then you make it for the boy and yourself she didn't have enough to make one he told her to make three but if you make one for Elijah you'll have enough for everybody else to is that right her meal was gone and the Bible said she lived off of that barrel for many days until there was no more need they met and it never went dry again I mean let me just possess and say this he met her present this and say this she did not live on meal after that day she lived on the sand for Lord I'll tell you where we're living today we're not living off of the milk barrel we're living off of the safe alone barrels were intact but thus saith the Lord put in abundance in the message of the hour you see what it done until it was thus saith the Lord it was just another message friends but when it becomes thus saith the Lord it become meal in the barrel which it's Christ is the same yesterday today and forever bro there's something that follows a message is that right amen ask that little woman that was about to sell her children into slavery because of the debt she hold is that right at the debt shield until that she went to Elijah and he said to her you got any oil in the house she said a little he said go out and borrow some vessels and not a few is that right go out and barber and then we're not involved all they could and the Bible said they filled them everyone with the all that she had she went from no money to abundance under the ministry of Elijah listen friend if you're not under a ministry of Elijah you're in famine you're in darkness would come under the ministry and there's an abundance of revelation and truth and reality and revival you see when he died he man he filled them I tell you what is a preacher I'm glad to read places like that because mother samuel is well on same list there's a time in our life where we wonder if we ask him to come with God filled them remember it's a paradox that I can preach to you to repent your sins and be baptized and gotta fill you with the Holy Ghost I can't do the feeling brother I don't have the power to do the feeling all I can do is the preaching but you've got to believe that the God that put the vision in process will feel the body hey maybe you got to start pouring and let God fill it up amen and eventually it becomes a revelation to you he can fill as many as you can get to come amen is many vessels as you can bring God can feel you gotta remember he's the God that filled the waters of the he's the one that filled the oceans with rudder he said god that can feel every heart with the Holy Ghost don't think that he's sparingly this morning can barely hear you know it's a powerful thing when you start seeing that they moved by that you see the abundance of it listen you see without the Ministry of Elijah you don't even have angel but if you come on the Ministry of Elijah look what happens there's the man named guy Heiser he's with Elijah he's in the cabin here comes the Syrian army off of the mountain the man's very nervous amen but Elisha don't get nervous hey man Elisha don't get married why don't he get nervous because he knows there is angels all about him until finally he tells the Lord he said Lord would you open this boy's eyes but he might be able to see if you don't want the Bible said when his eyes was opened then he didn't see one angel but he literally saw that the mountains were full of the chariots he went from no Angels to abundant angels he did he was he was not aware of one angel in the building but under the ministry of Elisha his eyes was open to all of them that was there oh listen this morning buh-bam said Elijah never even saw those angels and I should never even saw those angels but had knew it from the songs where it said the angel of the Lord and camp about them that fear him he said Elijah was standing on the word and knew they were there by the scriptures you might not see him this morning with your eye but the scripture says the angels of God Horan kept the Baptist well I'll tell you what if your vision was open this morning you'll see the angels of God is here the power of God is moving in this myth has a bright light flashing and moving across this building back and forth what's it doing it bringing you to the abundance of revelation that has been programmed for your age do you see a refreshing come from the presence of God and when that refreshing come that was that long-awaited revival of rain that they've been looking for you see this is what happens when God brings you into something by vision remember last night we approached Moses who was there under vision now Abraham had knew that the children of Israel was going to be delivered four hundred years went by with no movement at all but when Moses saw that light in the bush he said I am the I am let's come down out of heaven to deliver this children out of the Egyptians and put them into their land you see that was a vision laying there remember that vision become open now watch because in the ninth verse it says this the third chapter of Exodus enact verse he says therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have seen the oppression of the Egyptians and how they press them now what's this the Bible tells us that God appears to Moses comes down to him to deliver his children because the cry of the children have reached his ears now watch this what what I don't know I think different patterns maybe but whatever possessed that bunch of slaves to think that they could be delivered whatever God in their mind that they deserves freedom how in the work that was generations born that had never saw freedom amen all they had was a was a story that they could be free but they believed that story was a promise from Jehovah right now if that was him the promise of Jehovah they had a right to expect what God had promised them so all the sudden we realized that expectation is linked to promise amen if you don't have promise you don't have expectation you have promised you can expect God to do what God said he would do even if it seems impossible is that right so the Bible says that they would cry so watch now here here is people approaching God for what he prophesied what he said would be they had a right to pray that way and ask God for this to be fulfilled now we find out in the scripture that when God fulfilled this vision with Moses it happened at the same time Amen that a prophet was on the earth you watch God always fulfills his word in the time of a prophet the Bible said in Amos chapter 3 the Lord our God will do nothing until first he reveals his secrets undo his prophets so when a prophet comes on the earth you're looking at a junction of time and eternity you're looking at a vision that has just been laying there unfulfilled but when a prophet comes down to the earth at the same time Christ returns to the earth what's what happens the time mates the junction of fulfillment now what's because we see that that many people get troubled in the delay but when God gets ready to fulfill it in other words as a Christian you got to be ready to wait and you got to be ready to run you've got you've got to be ready to wait and you got be ready to move you've got to know you're waiting on God but when God moves you time to go and now some of you sisters know that you've waited on your husband and you can wait waitwait only but when he's ready to go he's ready to go so you got to learn how to wait you gotta learn how to go is that right now as a Christian people you got to learn how to wait on the Lord but when the Lord moves then it's time to move right pull the professor told us that you might wait months but when the angel troubles the water time to get in is that right amen now the reason that it is because they knew that it happened before it'll happen again they knew it wasn't whether it would happen it was a matter when it would happen so watch now we find out that the scripture is telling us that there goes ages sometimes with no open vision now we can find this in the book of Proverbs again watch now with no vision the people perish let's get her get her context here we're no vision people perish now watch because in 1st Samuel 3 the Bible tells us that there was a time of the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the Bible said the word of the Lord was precious in those days where there was no open vision now watch that can be a vision but it not be an open vision in other words you don't have the say if the lower brother man said a vision is a direct word from God a vision is a direct word from God a vision I'm quoting him a direct vision of God's a direct word of the Lord now watch because you can actually be reading a vision and it not be open to you the Bible itself is a book of visions watching Isaiah 29 watch how the Bible handles this when it says and the vision of all has become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men delivered to one that has learned saying read this I pray thee and he said I cannot before it's sealed so here what we have in the Bible is we have a book that has had visions of every prophet has had visions of this generation but though that this book has been delivered in the hands of many they have not yet seen the vision clearly of what was to happen in the end see they had the book but the book was sealed so so we find out then every story in the Bible has a vision for this generation maybe maybe I'll say it to you like this all of them foreshadowed something that would become clear in the last days we find out that when this clarity comes it is at the same time as a prophet in other words the vision will become open or resealable at that time when you read the Book of Ezekiel now I know your Bible studies and you go home and read it if you hadn't read it currently but in the Book of Ezekiel he was a prophet called the son of man the word of the Lord came unto him and God told him that he dwelled in amongst the people that couldn't see he died howdy ears couldn't hear called him rebellious house and one day he told his Hickory said I want you to prepare all your stuff and I want you to carry it out of your house I want you to knock a hole in the wall and I want you to carry your stuff out of your house carry through that wall and I want you to do it where the people see you I want you to do it in the evening time when they see you do it and while they're seeing you do it and once you put a veil on your face to let them know you've got eyes but you can't see you're gonna become a sign the Bible said he's going to become a sign under the people what was was that a car it was prophesied they would be carried out of Babylon but they are carried out of Israel Jerusalem and to be carried out through that wall with their stuff and so God was showing them by side this has been told but now it's come time if you if you study your Bible you'll tell it here in Ezekiel 12 and 22 son of man what is the proverb that you have heard in the land of Israel saying the days are prolonged in every vision field no they had actually had a same in Israel the divisions are failing the days are prolonged but it says it like this tell them thus saith the Lord I will make this proverb to cease and they shall be no more use of it as a proverb in Israel but I say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision the effect of every vision in other words every vision was going to become effective that had been had for that carrying away so there comes a time when there is an end of delay and the visions become effective amen see the Bible becomes a new book during that time but it's not just it's not just the old violin no more Amen it's becoming the hand of the master of the visions are becoming effective the Bible is becoming a new book the story of David is another story now the story of Samson is another story now the story of Shankar's another story now is you see the Bible takes a new look because when the vision is opened up it becomes a clarity of what was really trying to be presented in those days for this generation that we're living in now what's because that you've seen here it is at the specific time a mint but but we find him the Bible that there is a necessity that God would have you pray for what he's going to do remember he said go and going to the pray that God was saying harvesters and laborers in the vineyard time the hardest relevant said God was going to send him anyhow but he asked him to pray for what he was going to do it was in the will of God now watch because God actually puts a presentment in front of you and promised that would cause you to pray to fulfill the promise that he's made let me give you an example of men that prayed for things that seems it seems crazy to pray for this in the book of Job in the 42nd chapter in the third verse this is Joe talkin to God and he says who has he had as counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that understood not and things that were too wonderful of me which I knew not I beseech thee therefore and I will speak I demand of me declare that one to me now who talks to God like that you see who talks to God in that level I demand that you declare unto me now what's what he's doing he's actually showing you he meant that he's declare he's asking God to show him something did declare to me something God now now you have to ask where did this man get these words but these are the words which was spoken by God to joban choked the 38th chapter this is what Joel was asked of God he said to him job where were you before the foundations of the world when the sons of God was shouting for joy where were you choke now watch because Joe was trying to answer the questions of his problems and and his little friends there and they were trying to answer all these problems in God comes down and says now stand up I want to talk to you like a man where were you when I was doing all these things now watch Joe had never thought about where he was before the world began but when God asked him the question where are you jumps of wait a minute you mean you can no witness is a possibility I've never realized that I could know where I was before the founder what you mean I can actually know where I was when God was putting the planets in their places and he was and the sons of God was shouting for joy then somebody has this knowledge oh come on now when he realized somebody had the knowledge he talked to the one that had the knowledge and said tell me what it was tell me where I was tell me what's going on listen church you've got a right to pray that God declared to you what he knows about you Oh God you got a right to say to the Lord show me God show me where I was show me he meant make it clear to me Lord you see you have a right to ask God to declare him and where I was where I was doing what was happening you see you never even had that thought that God made you think higher than you thought he brought you out of the realm of humanity and took you in the realm of immortality made you think about things you never thought about before is that right this message makes you think about things you never thought about before is that right Amen what's the little woman at the well who met Jesus remember Pharisees couldn't help her her friends couldn't help her but Jesus told her her sins in her past and immediately remember he meant she began to say I know you're the Messiah I know that you're a prophet we're looking for one to come brother man said something struck the seed he gave her a higher thought he gave her a higher thought this message has given you a higher thought it's lifting you higher in your thinking oh thank god there's something that can get us out of this mess that we're in thank god this ain't all we got to look at something can lift us up higher what's the Bible it tells us in the book of psalms that David himself a chief musician begin to sing and since as the heart pain a fact of the water Brooks my soul longeth doctor the old God after it live in God he meant how many have you been to Israel and sit there I actually had blessed to go Leah's for a few years ago and sat on the on the altar that they built and Dan there under those golden calves I said on the altar while you're sitting on that altar you can literally hear a spring almost a mile away there's millions of gallons of water coming out of the ground and while you're sitting on that altar you can hear that spring coming out of the ground and the historians believe that David was sitting on those steps when he wrote that song amen he was sitting there hearing the sound of the water spout and he was sitting on the steps of the altar of a dead God saying my soul longeth after a living God the one that's the god of that stream out there you see what's what's here where we are in the slough to see an aged but when the seals begin to open up on the word begin to open up something and you begin to say I want that after that you see but something happens to you all the sudden a Bible story Amen in distance somebody tell a little Bible story some little some little sermon and all of a sudden that doesn't satisfy what's on the inside of you and people want to get on to you because you say well I had to go so much because I just couldn't get fan and they get on to you but you got a ride to hear this message you got a ride to hear the declaration of the word of your age you don't have to send some Pentecostal nonsense or some underpacked aside here we've got a ride to hear a man declare the message of the hour amen I believe there's a power that is in the Declaration of the word of the south you've got a right to pray have you got a right to expect Amen you got a right to ask I know it's strange sometimes Amen but the very expectation of your life is telling you there's been a change how come on now you know good and well that you live with your wife for 20 years and she had she had eggs and bacon every morning for breakfast you get up one morning she wants ice cream and pickles and some chocolate syrup on top of it for breakfast you said something's happened something's happened it declares there's been a change her hunger tells you something's happened amen what happens there's another life in there and there's a baby coming now and the baby is causing her to crave but she never craved before and you see you're craving that makes you the odd one amen only declares that there's a gene of life in there that's not satisfied Amen with a barred religion you're not satisfied with lukewarm church auntie but there's something in you that said preacher preach the message declare the words of Elijah preach this message preach the message of the hour let me know where I come from let me know what I'm doing here show me a divine path that I'm living on today well I'll tell you what there's some believers in this message it don't think brother ram's coldly too much there's some believers in this message that knew want the preachers to quote the message let some believers in this message it don't want a Pentecostal doctrine they're ready for the thus saith the Lord let the word lie come on children bring power you can have a vision in this generation and that vision comes from God you've got to write a man you've got a right to pray watch what's what's brother Branham tell you pray for revelation what's Apostle Paul in Ephesians 1 when he said the Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may he give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him but the eyes of your understanding being lightened that you may know the hope of his calling what is the riches of his glory inheritance a wait a minute you mean you can know the hope of the calling you mean your eyes can be open you can't have wisdom you can't have understanding Amen this is not a fairy tale this is not this is not somebody making up a false hope but here Paul says you pray that your eyes be open you pray that understanding comes to you no man said pray revelation strikes your heart that's no greater prevailing power than the power of Revelation if you know who you are what's the devil gonna do with you if you know who you are what's the devil gonna do with you it don't matter what comes your way you're gonna rise up in the morning and say I'm the son of God I will sit to this home to believe this message in this world I didn't know what I was gonna do but when God revealed I was a son then that was over I was over the devil lost the battle right there it's finished see in James chapter 1 and verse 5 said if any man lack wisdom let him ask God you have a right to ask God do you recognize that what you're wanting to see is the desire of every Asian he said many rich men have longed to see many kings have desired to see and have not seen them but blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears for you see what they long to see and you see it now you you've heard what they look listen friend can you know I don't know if I can present it the way that I see it but you're blessed you're blessed people and I don't know I don't know sometimes if we really connect with the reality of the blessings on our lives but they don't matter to me if you've got enough money to pay your house payment you're blessed if you're in this word and you're reading this message and you're believing it in your heart you're a blessed individual you don't matter what else is happening in your life you're blessed amen I believe that with all of my heart I want you to do me a favor now you turn around and tell somebody beside you you're blessed do you do you realize do you realize that if the preachers don't preach this the rocks are going to do you know that if I could put a microphone on the tree out there he would preach my sermon this morning if I could knock the tree there's a life running in that tree saying to you young lady come on you're a daughter of God do it you can do it my son that's right if I could knock the grass out there the Bible said all great creation groaneth the station of the sons of God you see the rock we're doing the rock knows more about you than you know about you come on church the rock was there the rock was there is so creation it a rock know what happened in the garden the rock knows the rock knows that King was killed Abel the rock knows the rock knows the rock seen all of it he heard all of it come on amen and the rock can preach it hey man the rock can preach it but I don't know about you but I go letting a rock take my place [Applause] it's my message oh that's right Moses had his day David had his day Luther had his day Wesley had his day but this is your day mister sure this is your time you're the you're the one in the scene now the vision has changed to to bring and incorporate a bride into that and in and to think that this very message the thing that people have tried to shut up is the very thing that God is said to make you aware and open the vision to your life to help me the vision if you've got your answer might call you and say I've got a dream for you and then they don't tell you you're not tell me the dream you told me you had a dream tell me the dream God said to you I have a vision I say God tell me the vision if a preachers don't preach to me tell me the vision but what is in my life what what is God about to do for me give me the vision let me know what the vision is you see this vision this vision this vision your vision Daniel saw didn't he Daniel saw your vision Daniel said the wise shall know their God remember he said I sing the books open and I heard a voice say to me Daniel seal it up until the time of the end and when the time of the end knowledge shall increase he meant and then he said to him what does it what does what is the sign of the end when show that thing be and he said I saw two men one standing on one side of the river and one on the other and there was a man clothed him why it's standing on the river brother man said watch that man and white on the river that's the Holy Ghost he said he's standing on the river the waters in the Bible is a multitude of people he said when you see the Holy Ghost on the people it's the sign that God give Daniel on the end I meant what happens in the end the Holy Ghost comes down and brings himself into the church he meant watch Daniels ceiling up until the time the in this vision was seen but sealed until the end time John solid in Revelations 10 John said I saw the mighty angel come down with a book in his hand I seen him set one foot on the land seems that one little sea but John's sealing up John's sealing up until the seventh angel begins to sound what Romans chapter eight manifested sons waiting for that time and when everything was waiting for revelations 10 and verse 7 everything waits on that everything waits on the prophet of God but when a prophet comes the world don't want to receiving but when a prophet comes a bride who's in the vision was seen accepting the message and becoming in the power of God in this generation well I'll tell you what it pals up after a wild only - it piles up after a while it piles up to mean something this message is meaning something more than just put you in a church it's meaning something it's meaning your son and daughter of God you're that rites are northern brightness going to change the body this in the vision you like your Bibles I love my Bible let's read the Bible a minute reading second Corinthians I'm watching the 3rd chapter and what child here in the in the Bible says in the 13th verse and not as Moses which put a veil over his face but the children of Israel could not steadfastly look upon the end which is to be abolished but their minds were blinded for until the day remain if the vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which veil is done away in Christ but even until this day when Moses is the red the veil is upon their heart so blinded Minds is veiled hearts watch what he says now but nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord when it shall turn to the Lord now do you think Paul don't know that Malachi 4 is coming when it when the art is turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away so in other words watch your eyesight it switches the heart when the heart turns the eyes come open the switch is not in the mind the switches in the heart so when the hardest turned the eyes come open there's only one ministry that turns the heart and opens the eyes and when the eyes come open look what he's saying to us he says then watch nevertheless then she'll turn the Lord the veil should be taken away and now the Spirit of the Lord where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now now you all I don't have time to teach this but to you that study what he's speaking of is John chapter 8 the Sun is set free it's free indeed for he the Sun set free is free indeed remember now and it begins to say that the Sun is not a servant and brother bam splits the Sun and servants in John chapter there and he begins to tell you that a servant had no inheritance in the land but a son had an inheritance in the land so when you're free you're free to return to your original inheritance so the Liberty that God is bringing here is a Liberty of Jubilee to return to sonship you were already sons you were already sons but you didn't know it you didn't see it but when the heart is turned you'll see your sonship was originally with God see it's a Liberty to see who you were to begin with in God what's what he says because we were all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changing the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit so Paul is telling you when you see this openly it changes you when you see it openly it changes you now now the same right or turn the first Corinthians 13 and watch now we won't lose our we won't lose our pattern but I want to show you something here in first Corinthians 13 what's Paul start with he starts with love is that right and he starts telling you about love and we know that love it's the capstone is that right love is the capstone now watch when Paul comes down to the be end of the verses here in the eleventh verse he said when I was a child but we just go above it not first when we know in part and we should prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come that would impart has done away now watch there's no more parts to be added so you no more have the message in parts you see you now you've got the message and it's added apart added about mr. data part Lutheran's added apart Western had a part but now there's some more parts to be added now you have perfection when does perfection come at the same time that love comes so the cat stole now comes in view at the same time perfection is upon the earth now watch what he says for he says for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face so Paul is saying at my time I'm seeing through a glass darkly but then when perfection comes you'll see it face to face now what's Paul just done he's just laid expectation before you he's just told you I'm seeing it darkly now but there's come at a time perfection is coming to the church amen now watch what he's doing he's setting your expectation above the gifts now I don't believe in gifts God uses gifts and that uses me and gifts oh I believe in gifts but gifts as gifts is apart but watch Amen it's like I don't know if some of you raised your kids and you bought them Walmart toys I bought my kids while my toys my daughter owns Walmart dolls and tell my mother-in-law started buying them 100 dolls and then she had to buy the dolls from that home but but but it's like your kids is in the floor and they're playing with dolls they're playing with Walmart doll and they got a Walmart truck and it's three or four dollars for this and three or four dollars there and they have those things and then you walk in and say hey kids how would you like to go to Disneyland si si they was ok with what they had until you said let's go to Disneyland all of a sudden what they're playing with has lost its value in the idea that we're going to Disneyland come on church we ain't losing nothing you're not losing nothing it's Disneyland you see once a we're not losing anything this is the coming of the Lord we're not losing we're gaining the powers of God in the fulfillment of the word of promise in this age Amen when I start looking at this I see the scriptures now start bringing start bringing perfect sense now you're up Bible studies so you know what 2nd Peter says don't you it says that there should be added to faith and knowledge and temperance and godless brother the constant once you go right up the ladder what's the last thing it's love it's capstone right at the coming of the capstone follow the scripture right after the capstone comes Peter says there would be an entrance ministered unto you abundantly amen at the time of the coming capstone perfections coming abundance is going to be preached but glass will be seen clean clarity our hearts will be turned what's what he's doing he's placing all of this at the capstone time amen what's in first John chapter 3 beloved what manner of love is this the father it bestowed upon you to call you the sons of God what manner two kinds right one of them was agape love at the coming of agape love you start understanding sonship but watch what he goes on to say but when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is how many realizes this message is the appearing of the Lord sure amen watch what brother BAM does he comes alone and says now the Bible says all the mysteries will be revealed in Revelation 10 7 - watch now because there's a great question on who's Melchizedek this is that right Melchizedek was God but when you brother man chases it down in the scripture he goes back and picks up Abraham a vision in the Old Testament and picks up Abraham and says watch Melchizedek talking to Abraham and he's reading his his heart and he's telling him who he says now what was that but the word he said that was the word discerning the heart of Sarah that was discerning the heart of Abraham that was the word he said see in the beginning was the word and the was with god and the word was god so Melchizedek was God in the word formed theophany is that right and Sophie often he had stepped in the flesh and had talked to Abraham that was in the vision but it was still under a glass darkly we seen the vision but we didn't see the clarity but when Melchizedek appears then we shall see him as he is and we shall be like him amen watch now because when we see Melchizedek like he is he meant we did have no clue that we had a theophany we knew God had a theophany we had no clue we had theophany but when milk acid had come among us all the sudden it opens up the revelation it's not just God that has something offered he you have a theophany and to think right now that if they search the tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting in the heavens it's in the vision that we haven't been often in this morning hey man then what's they're never going to do to us you destroy this body but we've done a theophany another tabernacle all we were already waiting what's the scripture now because what is starting to do is it's starting to clear up it's starting to clear up who you are the vision becomes clear and then watch because it follows follow the scripture now we'll close very quickly follow the scriptures in the fourth chapter therefore seeing we have a ministry as a received mercy we faint not but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty walking in crashes nor handling the Word of God deceitfully he says but by manifestation of truth concerning ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God now how did the message come to us not dishonestly it not come to us through the ideas and little stories and that no no no no it came to us by manifestation now watch because Paul is going to say something that if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in it beautiful that Paul uses the word our how many ever studied beyond the curtain of time and when the prophet of God begins to reveal to you that you have theophany remember milligram goes over there and he says these are your converts and all of them converts was over there listening and they heard the conversation between the angel and brother branham and brother Graham says he says you'll have to come back and be judged for what you preached and he says well Paul have to be judged for what he preached and they said yes Paul had to be judged by them said well I preached exactly what Paul preached and look what it the whole crowd says were resting on that william branham and paul had the same gospel see paul said if our gospel it was it was the same gospel amen and here Paul and William branham's gospel being the same but if it's hid its hid to them that are lost who the god of this evil age had blinded their minds what's the next word is said lest L est lest lest the light of the glorious gospel Christ shine unto them into the image of God now watch unless in other words less than we get the they get their hands on this less do you know that word L est is the same word used in the book of Genesis when Adam and Eve sinned and they said we'll go take it the tree of life and the Bible said that God put cherubs around that tree to keep them lest they would take of the Tree of Life so there was something keeping them from taking the Tree of Life see and that was keeping them from that but if this gospel be hid its hid to them lost listen so if this gospel is opening up it's opening up the way for you to take the Tree of Life do you ever notice revelation 22 the way it's written that John comes at a time when he's kneeling down to worship one who he thinks is Jesus Christ and at that same time brother Kevin when he's trying to worship that angel that angel said don't worship Me he said I'm only one of the Brethren I'm a prophet that what he told him and when when that ministry came what's John John was told not to worship him worship God then that angel told him John it's times at hand now unseal the book sound the trumpet release the prophecies watch that same angel was revelation chapter 10 and verse 7 once a mighty angel come down from heaven don't don't open it yet John but when the seventh angel sounds then you open it John right when the seventh angel sounds here we are in revelations 22 and here we are with an angel standing there who John's trying to worship but said John released the book now that ministry was the difference between the vision being clear and the vision being held what's what's what's John here he is in revelations of fifth chapter and John is seeing that there's no one worthy to take that book is that right John said I couldn't take the book that liyan he said that no man in heaven or earth was worthy until the lamb come and took the book in Revelations the fifth chapter John is forbidden to take the book but in revelations of death chapter after the seventh verse John is commanded to come and take the book you've got to come now and take the book chop a mint take this book and eat this book and the word shall be in thy mouth Amen do you see what he said he meant to tip whenever this message came you've got a right to take of the tree of life may I say to you this morning you've got a right to the Tree of Life you've got a right to pray but the message we preach you've got a right to believe the message of the hour you've got a right to seek the revelation of the word you've got a right to feed upon the unfailing body word of the son of man listen friends that's exactly what a heavy right did that's exactly what heavy right done he meant Hattie Wright was feeding on the right thing when she heard brother BAM tell the story of those swirls is that right when she heard the story them squirrels and she said that's nothing but the truth remember both men said now you say whatever you'll have Hattie and had had he been studying Oral Roberts ministry she would have asked for that million dollars hey men she would have asked for that healing amen but she had been feeding on something else come and take the bukchon and eat the book prophecy and the word will be in my mouth and John said I ate the book fulfillment and the word was in my mouth he meant this morning friends if you're feeding on this message you're feeding on the tree of life but it's coming to you in this age and the words of life is coming to you I'll tell you this morning it's time for the Bride of Christ to tell the devil amen this is as far as you're going Amen that's as far as you're going devil we've come far enough now I'm throwing my shoulders back I've taken the Tree of Life I'm feeding on the Word of God I'm speaking the word against you I will not put up with you no more Amen listen I I think it's too much now that but the mothers are starting to have been worried a little bit whether it was true or not what the Prophet said to you but that's a token to you mothers you claim them children and they will come don't you let the devil talk you out of that don't you let the devil push you back on that it's written in the book of Isaiah the 65th chapter they shall be their will their offsprings I don't know how God's gonna do it but it's the word of the Lord and I look at the troubles I look at the circumstances but fish and it's fair to look at this morning come on friends you can't just keep looking at the world you got to look at the vision you're going to put your eyes on the vision you got to put your eyes on this word and begin to preach it and focus and let your heart by the way you don't know what I'm going through you don't know what others have went through and you know why you don't know cuz they didn't tell you every time you stop they don't tell you their problems they don't tell you sir well that's so-and-so they got the best live in that night they got as many problems as you the difference is they ain't telling everybody the problems they're telling everybody how good Jesus is not a vision with your head down and barely coming to church that's not the vision the vision is the Church of God where their shoulders back their foot on the devil their heart full of the Holy Ghost the power it's the revelation of Jesus Christ I know things get bad brother III see it I'm not I'm not ignorant to it Amen but I don't choose to talk about it nice tell them brother Samuel in the back room this one said you know I said I just went through a study on the church ages and I was in the church age book and I come down to that verse where John said he was only-- Isle of Patmos and and you know what I told him I said I spent two days studying it says most unfruitful study I ever had in my life I studied two whole days on the Isle of Patmos and you know why it was the most untruthful thing you can't find nothing about it you know it you know that John wrote three other books besides the book of Revelation and you can't find one mention of any situation he faced on the Isle of Patmos in animation that it took a historian to tell you John got bold and all because John never told you but John wrote entire three other books and the book of Revelation and he never expressed what he went through on the Isle of Patmos but he rather wrote the revelation of Jesus Christ I bet you don't know what he went through other than he was there I'm sure there were hardships but John knew rapturing faith was never coming to you by telling you how bad of trouble he was having on Patmos but the power that was coming to the church what's going to be the revelation of Jesus Christ and there's a revelation this morning for every believer sitting here Matt revelation is bringing your life up in the power of God it's a clear vision this morning hey you you're showing up with your foot on the devil brother I'm ready I'm ready to fulfill the vision he foots on the devil your heart's full of the Holy Ghost life is in your soul speaking the Word of God I spelled the church some time ago brother I think it was brother telling the admin told me he said by the way night he said he's seen it maybe I may have told you I don't know he said Cena he's seen a story about a about a about a about a cat in a mouse it was at a wedding supper and the story goes that the cat get after the mouse chased him all over the building there after a wild little mouse he went up across the table and felling the window on that little mouse swim across the wine boat got up on the out the other side and when he came up outside that window he said he got up on the side of the boat and stretched his shoulders back said where is that cat that Devils running you all over the place but I think it's time to get in the wine bowl let's get the stimulation of the revelation of this message in our soul who is that devil honey mother tell him he's a liar but that was a liar this morning we're the sons and daughters of God were not here bluffing there's something in us we've heard the call but some reality to this message thousands of indications vision Activision's a man I listened to hundreds of tapes and listened to hundreds of tapes and you know what in the Bible the Bible said Jesus had a ministry of visions do you know William Branham had a ministry visions do you know that those discernments were visions in the scriptures and that discernments he had in the end of those tapes were actual vision do you know that little woman at the whale heard one vision from Jesus one vision of a filthy prostitute heard the Jesus say to her you've got six husbands ones five husbands ones you're living with now is not yours and she said sir I perceive your profit do you know the tapes that you have almost every one of them on the end has got five to ten visions of a prophet discerning the heart of the people amen and listen that woman hurt that one time and said serve your prophet how much are our faith be this morning in listening to all of those sermons and hearing that prophet say those things in this generation I'll tell you what one thing that I've rejoiced it's the thing sometimes you don't find on the tape but things you don't find you don't find what happened to John it's a rejoicing because John didn't tell it he focused somewhere else there's another beautiful thing you never hear and that's on the tapes and you hear brother BAM with service after service after service tell people what their history was but their names was what their addresses was what their car wrecks were about what their injuries were what their surgeries was what the doctor said to him what happened they were little kids things that he had no clue about you nothing I never heard on a tape I've never heard one of them people on that tape say brother Branham that's not right but every one has always said that's nothing but the truth amen do you believe this morning you got a right to believe you got a right to love this word you've got a right in this vision this vision is of you this morning and you have a right to move forward in what God has set for your life listen friends I'm ready to step in the vision of God fill its power in your life this morning step into it and feel it feel the power come into you you can stand in laugh at the enemy you understand brother Ram said there's a place that a son of God can go the devil don't even know what to do with him see you're a part of that vision today you're a part of that vision if I don't tell you this the trees are going to you're a part of this vision that vision opening up in our lives gives us a place this morning that we can step a fire our musicians could come I'm a part of this visions you're a part of this vision but but do you know brother Branham had to make his choice standing over that child he had to make his choice to be a part of that vision that's what the vision said but brother man said when I recognized what I was where I was standing he said then I just it was just drama you ever talked to people that was a part of a vision sometimes they didn't even know it they didn't even realize it was happening but all of a sudden their lives become real and they see they see where they come from they see where they're going I believe this morning Rance I believe the Holy Spirit has given us a right a right to the Tree of Life got a right to love God this morning we've got a right to loving we got a right to serving I know what it is for the devil to pile on yeah and I know what that feels like I remember when I was about 21 years old and I was I you know sometimes young people grow up in church and there you know is TV and then they want out of church but they're in church so this was like they're in prison and their heart they really want to be out there but they're in here well that was just opposite of what I was I grew up in the world from time I was nine year old to time I was 20 and I wanted to be in church and I was in the world yeah but there was something that there was things that I couldn't get over spirits I couldn't get delivered from I didn't understand how that I could do it but when the Holy Spirit began to deal with my life and begin to bring me in I found out that that at some point there that this was actually a choice God gave to me and if it's my choice I'm gonna serve God sometimes sometimes the enemy sometimes the enemy tells you that you've been too far it's not the vision sometimes the enemy says you went too far he twists Hebrew six it's amazing how a twist the wording he'll twist that word around to make it say something he doesn't say you can't make the word lie and John 5:24 it said he that hears my word or the words been quickened too has already passed him death in life and shall not come into condemnation how can you take Hebrew six and make John 5:24 lie so Hebrews six is saying something different than people think it is brother Brent said see there's two seeds there and one of them is a seed of God the other the seed of the world and the Holy Ghost falls on both seeds now watch when that Holy Spirit begins to fall on that seed and you begin to you begin to realize so so I tell you what I tell a lot of people this whenever the devil tells me you went too far and you can never repent and you can't come back to God and you can use the kids you done that it I'll tell you what I tell them I said well if it don't matter they've allowed to serve the Lord then if I went too far it don't matter what I do so I'm just come serve God don't matter what I do I'm lost anyhow I'm just going to serve the Lord it's best life a man can live I'm going to serve the Lord and loving but if he puts me in hell and I'll go there but but for now this is the best thing could happen for any man's life come on love God serve all my soul my mind my box so some point you some point you got to stand up to the devil you got to stand up and say look I'm done you push me all you're gonna push me you've took me as far as you're gonna push I'm standing up this morning I don't know maybe maybe right here this morning there's a vision for your life and you've allowed the enemy to just keep pushing you and keep pushing you and keep pushing you and you feel like the pushed one but you know what you don't have to take that anymore you don't have to take that anymore there's something that God has done for you this morning that you can accept you can accept the payment made you can accept the price paid I wonder here this morning if you're ready to say to the devil that's enough it's enough I'd no longer the servant of sin I'm a child of God I'm not going no further with this Satan I want it right here this morning face might be a might be a person in the building I'd be many so by the way I've been pushed around enough I'm ready I'm ready to serve God with all my heart I don't wanna I don't I'm not gonna take no more from the devil no I'm not gonna take no more fat bet you this won't you stand up silent we'll take no more I just don't tell you table yeah I surrender I'm not gonna take no more you're not gonna push no more no sir I'm not gonna take no more it's been enough ain't it it's enough when the Bride of Christ had
