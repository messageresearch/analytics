to see him Saturday evening and brother Claudio he was in they were operating to stop some bleeding here today so I haven't received any update as of yet from brother Greg but we want to remember the Claudia's sister Suzanne's father we want to remember him in prayer that the Lord would just just be merciful to him in this time and so we want to just hold him up in a word of Prayer amen aren't you aren't you glad we have a place aren't you glad you've got a rock oh my rock that's that's higher than I when they would say lead me to the rock that's higher than I and I'm so grateful to God that we we have a refuge we have a place Amen where we can go to Amen I'm grateful for that because we you know so many times in our lives and many of you have even been in the journey a lot longer myself but you we realize so many times again and again we don't have the answers but he is the answer he is the answer for every situation amen and he he always he's always he's always on time he's always faithful he knows exactly what we have need of you know we don't as believers we we realized this is not just words that we expressed these are our experiences he's right on time amen it's you know we we look at it and many times when we're praying for different situations and different needs and sometimes the tendency that can even be around us is we want to try to make something happen or become anxious with it that's the part of the human part about our life but the reality as we know Lord if you just step to the bow of the ship if we can just help me Lord to get this outer man under control that you can take control then that's when it's that's when it's all over it's all settled amen so we just thank God for that over and over you know it's the it's the little things and I certainly don't mean to make light of anything but it's the little things that mean so much to us God's the the everything how God with details in our life and how he ministers to us with every with each and every need I also want to remember brother Carmelo in prayer the God will just continue that Lord would just move for him and give him direction and what to do with this with this foot there we have a

my brother David new bra that he will be able to move to Ohio okay so remember those different requests in prayer is there any other request anyone have any other requests that you didn't write down and you happen to think of okay so brother Doug request a prayer and then also remember the Scott Walker his job situation yeah any others brother Richard praise the Lord amen amen I'm not going to ask you my raise of hands but how many of you lost keys classes and you know it sometimes you know you the first thing is who moved them who moved you know honey where'd you put my my glasses at you know and they weren't honey did I it wasn't honey it was you know I left him down somewhere else or you know but it I'm sure every one of us have found that where you just finally come to a place in your diligently searching but you finally come to place and say lord help me because I can't even trace in my mind where I would have put him I remember one night I was walking around in the house and I was you know because I have boys that are driving now and and so I was walking around some one of them had given me the keys and so I put the keys in my pocket so I came in and I was looking on the key wreck I said who who had my keys my keys are hanging up oh I had the whole house searching finally I'm not through searching in the car reach back and they're in this pocket in his back pocket so I had to apologize I said forgive me but I wasn't used to having him in that you know I just did sometimes we get things on our minds and we just take stuff and put it and but I think God for His mercy aren't you I'm just so thankful to the Lord that he's mindful one I knew there was something else I had as well brother Jason to Mars he requested prayer they're going to be going back to Turkey and Egypt in early June they had a real they had a real good trip in February and the Lord willing they're going to be going back over over into turkey here back in June so we want to keep them in prayer the other thing is his mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer and it's spread quite a bit they're doing chemo and he said we just joined with him there's Mary Hoffman Mary Hoffman so brother Jason to Mars which most do you remember brother Jason was here in the first part of December and their work that's among the Persian countries there so let's remember that in prayer as well so just just going back over that brother Ray's job situation the missions and missionaries and Churchill Lorraine Rhoda sister rodas having this surgery lost souls for Angie Brown also for brother Jewell so for brother Carmelo and there's requests here for unsaved loved ones among among many to hear many different ones that are wrote down also brother herb and then also sister Rita's sister Teresa that

and her mom's blood pressure and then also for brother Bobby carpet for his healing and the Claudio and sister Mary and the children so let's just remember each one of these requests in prayer and there's different ones that come to your heart as we're praying you you just take that always just be obedient to the Lord because if there's a need that stands out to you out of what's been read here or there's someone else that comes to your heart maybe it's someone who's back saluting they come to your heart just stand right in there it's the Lord putting that on your heart and just stand right in there and pray you know and sometimes we we look at things and I don't know probably every one of you have found yourself this way too you know you try to write down every single thing in every single need and you try to remember every single request and I'm talking about over the course sometimes of weeks and things and you know sometimes you you hear things you think I I wish I would have remembered that more I wish I would have remembered this and you know it's not that you Eve willfully forgot it sometimes we were as we're praying it's most important is that we recognize we're a body we're a body and you know the Lord is mindful of our needs and to think of how that he'll drop that need in that request it's not going unattended it's being attended to by the redeemed of the Lord taking that before the throne of God so tonight we just want to we just want to go into prayer here tonight and just ask the Lord would just move on behalf of these needs you love the Lord amen glory
