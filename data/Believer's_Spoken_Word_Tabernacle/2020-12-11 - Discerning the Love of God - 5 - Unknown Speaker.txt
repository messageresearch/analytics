name of the Lord Jesus Christ and um we just say we're just so thankful for the mercy of the Lord once again this evening that we're able to be able uh to come together and gather around the word and knowing that God is he's mindful he's an omnipresent God and so we want to just look just for a moment a few things that I want to go over with with you as a congregation before we go into the service the ministering of the word and those things I'd like to go over with you are in regards to the resuming of the in-person service is here on Sunday I'm not going to labor this we sent out an email uh this past Monday as well as posting it there on Facebook for those of you who are connected with all of that uh the and so you've read that and I really don't have any other points to make other than what is on there and to reiterate some of those and that is that um with a mask itself The Mask will be worn uh at all times while we're in uh here uh in in the services and so forth um we uh want to also want in in looking at this is is what we've been I've we've been uh relying upon uh one another that if in in coming to Services if you if you have a fever you're not feeling well it there's no question whether you love the Lord or not just just stay at home and stream just just check it out to be sure what it is um so we need you that's why we've been the whole time that we've been working with these things we need you just to do that the other part is is that and just to make that other point very clear is if you've had contact with someone that's suspected in other words you've been around someone and they've been they're suspected because each and every day we can come in contact with different numbers of people or whatever more we're talking very specifically here if you have there're suspected that you've been in contact with someone and you you kind of know that whether it's been uh of something and you just to take inventory of that we need to be real stewards about these things and so uh to be mindful of that and and obviously if uh if you've tested positive for covid well um you know you know that you're not to come but we just we want to be proactive and I wrote on here a quote that actually is from Benjamin Franklin but it's true an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure uh and so we want to just just try to be very simple with that the other thing is I want to mention to you what we put in there is that we've done we've done a good job with the spacing and for and and thankfully here we've been able to to social distance and we tried to do all that we can in to be prudent to be wise with everything that we are doing and uh and I think for the most part we have done a very good job with that however coming back here and in this in this time on this is also going to be along with the mask until further notice in here and that is that the deacons will seat you they'll kind of look at where everything is at and they'll seat you because I know even even on the Thursday nights we've had we've had uh almost close to a Sunday crowd on the Thursday night so we we want to be careful with that that we're not just we talked about that the last time that we're not just sitting behind one another and sometimes that happens somebody sits down doesn't aware of somebody's at the restroom so the deacons will be overseeing that just please understand uh you may not uh be seated in your normal place and that's okay it's just an opportunity to show that you can serve God no matter where you set in church um so you know and you're you're you're like a fire might be needed in another Pew or another side of the building so uh we want to be understanding of that and the deacons I've really asked them to really be on that part of it to stay with that and they've done a good job here in the past so please understand that coupled with that um this is something that I want to mention to all of you as a congregation and that's on our arrival time um I want you just to think about coming to church like you would coming to work now some of you maybe you do clock in late at work I I don't know um but uh I want you to think of it in this terms the doors are locked and brother Richard has to get up each and every time and so I want you to think about this it's not about Brother Richard getting up each and every time but it's about the fact of more or less when we're coming to the house of God let's just think that getting here early and us coming in here and getting settled and praying it's not just about us it's about the whole body and so that in itself will also during this time um would make it just even even a lot better instead of you know having things coming in late and and we can just be very Frank and very honest with one another sometimes I understand circumstances come up but I think we can be honest sometimes it's just habits that we just need to break and get out of and and really be determined on this part and just to really to see the value of it so I want to encourage you uh within that part of it as well so that that'll help out so the email is there the Faceook Facebook uh post all that was done on Monday and if you have any if you have any questions if there's anything you've got a question about this is the same thing that has um whether you should come or not this is the same thing that's been throughout that I appreciate that when you call me I would as I said I would rather look at something and let's let's think it through than just just to assume we don't want to do that so let's we just want to move forward with that as well so so uh at this moment we want to just just turn our attention to the word of the Lord here tonight and um we just like to just invite you to the word of the Lord and maybe as we're preparing to turn there in 1 Corinthians 13 uh one uh let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer tonight and just ask for his Direction and his Mercy as well uh Upon Us Heavenly Father Lord we are just so thankful dear God lord for the mercy and the grace of God lord Jesus we lord don't know what we would do without you lord you're our life Lord You're the you're are the guide of our life Lord through every circumstance of Life Lord and every little detail Lord we ask you for your help and your guidance Lord there's nothing that we take for granted I I know Lord in myself and I'm certain that Lord in the lives of others that even when it comes to Lord the tasks of life or things that we take on and are doing Lord around the house or whatever Lord we just ask you sometimes we run into things that we don't know Lord Lord how do I how do I approach this and Lord I'm so thankful that Lord we can come to you in everything Lord and just to know that God that you're mindful Lord of every need and we just pray tonight Lord that you'd minister to the hearts of each and every one of your children I pray that God that you would just help me to be able to step aside tonight that you can come Lord and that you can deliver the word oh God to our hearts Lord that you would just minister to our lives in such a very special way tonight Lord we just Lord commit ourselves into your hands now we want to say we love you and we appreciate you and we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen in first Corinthians chapter 13 um we want to look here in First Corinthians 13:1 and I want to just come back into this this place of it and as we look at it here tonight Paul would write and this is counsel that is really that's given to the Corinthian Believers but it applies to all of us though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol or I am become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so a lot of these things would be very very good things or we could say they could be things that would seem to be very helpful to that of others or to the body but Paul is is directing them that this is not what you are to rest upon they seen the supernatural taking place but Paul is letting them know that do not rely upon the supernatural taking place or or you being used of that but make sure the number one thing is that of Charity the love of God that you have been sealed by the Holy Ghost because that's the ground that's the source that all of this is the gifts and everything else is used for the body and it is those are Gifts of God's love so we want it to it is to be used by the love of God the next scripture I'd like to just read before we maybe would be seated or however you are there in 1 Corinthians 14:1 Paul says follow after charity and I think that's very key follow it's to pursue or to seek after eagerly follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy so may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated when I look at when we look at this part here uh many of many of these things that we look at with the love of God these are things that Paul is dealing with of even how that a Believer is is admonished and encouraged in their walk with God this is real counsel and Leadership that's given to to the Church of the Living God and to see that when as we've been looking at this thought on Discerning the love of God and we know that we must have spiritual discernment these are things that we need the Holy Spirit to discern things out even in our life we need we we need to rest upon him and this is where when Paul would say follow after charity is that let let it be that it's the love of God that is leading us that's Direct ing us and we are following the love of God and I I look at this and I just just recognizing that within our lives as you and I we were to we were looking at last week when we look at this with charity and the love of God love can be is a term that can be thrown around or uh taken very lightly or spoken very lightly of and we recognize as we looked at it last week that in the scriptures where the the Lord Jesus I believe in John 21 was asking Peter lovest thou me and he's speaking in that term of agapo me that love that is from and is of god it's pure and Peter's response was I ailio Thee I love thee thou knowest I aelo Thee and we recognize that that that is the only measure that Peter at that time was able to love the Lord in with with that of the fial love but here God would would would impart to Peter and to each of them on the day of Pentecost and to disciples and Believers on down Through the Ages even as it comes down into our present time and into our lives that God would would release into our hearts the love of God this is this is what brings leads to a real transformation in a life because we realize that we are not drawn to God out of a out of a law but it is God drawing our hearts in a love affair that then there would come a uniting and as we kind of been looking at that on Sunday that there must be a death first of the old man and then there's a a uniting of with that seed with that life on the inside and so that is all it's all a work of the love of God and so when we look at this there there is when we approach into these scriptures as we Paul would begin to look and deal with this of Charity We There is a very important part to recognize that we as Believers have a resource and that resource is him and he is our life if we have been born again he is our life and this is why brother brandham would say it like this in the Hebrew series he says could you imagine before there even was an earth before there was a light before there was a star before there was anything there was a great Fountain going forth of spirit and out of this Spirit came the most pure of love because there was nothing for it to come from but love now we what we call Love Today is a perverted love but just as we get an essence or a little bit of that love in US it changes our whole opinion so if you notice brother said just in essence if just as we get a little bit of that it changes our whole opinion it begins to change our Outlook it begins to change our attitude begins to change you know the love of God even working in in a measure in our life it begins to change to where our heart will be moved in Repentance and then that same love working it'll it'll it'll move that life in order of sanctification where the mind is set in order for Holiness where the things they begin to looking at the things you know that's around them but then let the love of God it goes deeper to lead to a death and to a union and see it's all the love of God that's bringing about the change within our life it's the same love after we've been born again that actually is moving ministering correcting as well as bringing that maturity within our life brother B says now when these great lights went out or great rays of spirit love peace that's all there was was that there wasn't no suffering there was no hate nor No Malice it couldn't come from this fountain that was Jehovah that was Jehovah God now I want you to think about this it could not he is the Fountain and the source and from this great Fountain this great spirit God here comes forth the very pureness of Love itself out of that Fountain and to think of it that that how that for that part that out of him there could come no hatred No Malice it couldn't come from this Fountain let me just say it that when a person you have been born again of the spirit of God remember the holy spirit that is the love of the father it is the love of God and there is no hatred or malice can come from that Source within our Liv life but it's to let that source that love if there's a love that's going to govern we do not want FAL love governing Our Lives we want our lives to be governed by agape love even with felio love that would uh be among Brethren F your love that would be uh between a husband and wife between and that of a family but yet we want that under the governance of agape love this is why Paul could write right husbands agopa your wives even as Christ Agape the church so it's to recognize this is the kind of this is the kind of love and that love is not anything that we can attain to on our own s but there is a resource it is in God's hands and it is that which God deposits and he by the new birth then we have an access we have a resource we have a fountain and then the whole of our life is to be LIF the expression from that resource from that Fountain and so you know this is where with that with that Fountain I want you to keep that in mind this is our resource and we must continue this is our life is to be lived from that resource and so notice Jesus would say in John 13:34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another you see Agape Love is a love that creates it's a love it brings forth an atmosphere it brings forth a change it's real it's substantive it's that which others can see that these people really love one another and that's that was the testimony among the early church when they would would speak of them and they were first called Christians the things that were so moved by that of the Heathen and the Pagan that were around they looked at them and the testimony they had of their own lives is what love that is a that is among these individuals let me just tell you something that that is a work sovereignly of almighty God and it requires that our life is drawing from that resource from that Fountain of Life so Jesus goes on to say in John 15:12 this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you Greater Love have no man than this that a man would lay down his life for his friends notice love one another as I have loved you these things I command you that you love one another so there's only one way that that can be done the only way one way we can love one another in that manner as he did it has to be the same love of God in our hearts that was within him 1 John 4:7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God I want you to take notice of these scriptures here beloved let us love one another you see this is encouragement this is an this is admonition the gospel is not something that just goes on autopilot the gospel encourages us because when you have been born of the spirit of God you're still dwelling in this sticky house that's here and it's got to be admonished to bring everything else in subjection to the word and here's the admonition of the word beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God so notice how the scripture here goes on to say he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love it's very clearly laid out here in verse 7 and verse 8 without the revelation of Jesus Christ which is the the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the word experience without that reality in that life to where now the tenderness of the love of God has come into your heart and the love of the world is gone and your whole desire your whole life becomes him you love him nobody's making you serve him you serve him because you love him he's the one you desire to please and with that that aspect of it this is where it ties together because remember brother BR would say the Pharisees oh he says that you know they had love he says Christian Science they can outshine many people but the difference is that what the Pharisees have Christian Science that's not the love the agape love they can have love and you know expressing love but this love we're talking about is a love that works in harmony with God it is positioned in his word and it's a love for the body of Jesus Christ and a love for others 1 John 4:11 beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us this is one of the evident signs in a life hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he ha given us his spirit so as we said before a person can say well I I just love everybody but they don't walk in step with the word they don't walk in step with the body then this isn't they don't have the love that we're talking about here the love we're talking about here is a love that comes from the word itself being revealed because it is God himself deity coming to Tabernacle the person of Christ coming to Tabernacle in his children it becomes a love for the word of God first Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren notice purified the souls there's been a leading to death by what obeying the truth you can't get anywhere without obedience obedience comes out of love so purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that notice this admonition see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently in other words be let this be intentional let it be to the Forefront see that ensure that this is the part of your life don't become loose on this being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever you see the same as as the revelation of the word of God because the word is active the word is a person as that word performed through Abraham's life Moses life Joseph life and I'm just I'm not just talking about in the signs and wonders I'm talking about in the times of adversity when things were that come against them things were said about them mistreated look how the word the resource that they were able to draw from the word gave them a living resource to be able to draw from this is where our resource 1 Timothy 1: 15 now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience ious conscience and of faith on faith notice charity out of this is the resource the fountain tapped in to that Fountain where is that Fountain here that life that spirit that portion of that belong to you here he is dwelling in that seed that life that he has raised up you have access you are tapped into a fountain that's why Jesus said he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall be rivers of Living Water 2 John 1: 15 and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and this is love that we walk after his commandment ments this is the Commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning you should walk in it you see it's impossible to love one another and not be walking in the word of God it's impossible and it's also impossible to be walking in the word and not love one another they go hand in hand because if you're walking in the word you're walking in Christ Jesus you're walking in the body of Jesus Christ This is why Paul said Discerning the Lord's body so then you have one motive and one objective and that's Christ and this is why brother Randon would say this and I I I just this just so so striking to my heart he talks about our attitude our objective our motive he said that's where the church is standing ing today if your objective and motives is right towards God the love of God will stream down like a fountain motives and objectives this is why brother randam would take take the time because it is all the way through the scripture we could go on and on but brother random would take us and he would talk about uh even when he was talking to brother Collins about knowing of Something's the will of God he says even if it is the will of God I want to test my motive and objective in it because if it is God's Will and yet my motive and objective is wrong it's the same as it not being God's Will and he would tell us in power of transformation among many places test that motive and objective this is where we need the discernment of the love of God we don't need feelings we need the discernment of the love of of God and I believe with all my heart that the discernment that God brings to our heart the discernment that we have need of and it's not just something that I'll say that's out here it's what's in here but it's us staying in contact and in fellowship with him in a real closeness of Fellowship that we'll know as the prophet said the least little thing that would disturb him he said I'll know it and flee from it now when we come into this and I want to just as we I say all of that from my heart before we come into this part of it in verse four of first 1 Corinthians 13 because I don't know about you but every time when I read through these chapters and I read through in the book especially 1 and 2 third John and it's all through the New Testament Paul it's in so many different places where we speak of Charity and how charity is expressed and how how the life is conducted I don't know about you but every time when I'm reading and as I look through this right here I just always find myself saying oh God help me Lord to live a little bit deeper Lord not just a little bit but knowing that God that this is what I have need of you not saying that I haven't seen victory in my life no more than you could say but to recognize Lord and to this and this part of it it's something that grips within our lives because we realize these are things that are still where we drawing from that fountain in our life that many of these things that we read about are not things that require love in the so-called good times but this is where the love of God stands in the time of adversity and opposition and this is where that from that Fountain we can't draw from out here in that first realm we've got to draw from The Fountain and that's why we were looking at that in the opening tonight we've got to be in contact and drawing from the Fountain of God in order for this to be expressed 1 Corinthians 13:4 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not vth not itself is not puffed up in the Amplified Bible if I can read that first part it says love endures long and is patient and kind love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy is not boastful or vain glorious does not display itself hotly I want to look at this first part charity suffereth long and is kind this this part of it is a description of where that this I believeth on my heart that the love of God in our heart it will move us in this way and I also believe that through the word as these are things that God deals with our hearts that it it should be that the word brings us to a place of Greater self-reflection in other words words we're not looking at everybody else but we recognize that this takes place that takes place but the first place that we look is right here because regardless of what that person does we have to ensure that our hearts and our lives stay in a place that's open before God and that there be nothing that is held against the person that takes that takes takes the love of God suffering this word here suffereth long this means to be of a long spirit means to be of a long Spirit In other words it's not quick on the draw it's of a long Spirit it means to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish it's okay you can say Lord help me because of every Victory there's things that I can look at and see victories in my life but even with those victories and those parts that are there it still comes back into these things to where still having to deal with and pray and say God let there be nothing that resides here or gets hung up here that takes that takes the work of the Holy Spirit and what I mean by that is that doesn't mean that we sit back and just say God you got to do it no it's where we take the value of that and say God Purge it out of my life really get desperate before God because remember this guy is not converted right 1 Thessalonians 5:14 what our Paul would direct this now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men not just them who are of the household of faith but toward all men all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men notice follow that which is good following after charity these are things that notice the spirit of God bringing out to the believer and is really drawing the attention down to this that these are things that if these things are left and it becomes careless then we find the supply in our life we wonder why isn't our life going on the way it is why do I have things going in my life the way that they are and we have to come back to the simple principle of how is our attitude how is our heart toward others how are we conducting ourselves and listen we even in the midst stuff we're these things we're talking about suffering long this isn't because somebody made you a beautiful birthday cake and oh I just got to suffer with it and you know eat it all this is not what this is this is where offences have come and to be of a long Spirit wow well once again the only way you and I can be of a long Spirit suffereth long we've got to be able to draw from the Fountain of him who is known as the longsuffering one the Lord 2 Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance notice he's longsuffering to us word so the longsuffering of God even as it was in the days of Noah think about it the longsuffering Peter is writing this here in this time that the longsuffering of God it was that which God himself his word had went out and God within the midst of it though you and I had gone astray but in our or the ordained time of God how God would draw us to himself but in the meantime it was the longsuffering of God that waited for you and I think about that the life that we live or maybe you can saywell I didn't go out and drink and I didn't go out and smoke and I didn't go out and do all this but maybe you just did something that was even as just as bad you sit in a church pew and you would not turn your life over to the Lord and yet God himself would be longsuffering to you he would keep on dealing with your life he would keep on ministering to your life he would even take care of you and me when we did not deserve to be taken care of when our lives were live directly in opposition to his word and his will and we would get up we would forsake and not actually surrender our hearts but yet what was it what was it that kept us from being removed it was the long suffering of the Lord and the last part of the scripture not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance notice the longsuffering of God think of it is not just that for the elect of God because the elect of God that is the will of God and the will of God cannot be defeated but this is dealing with God's willingness God does not want to see anybody miss it as a matter of fact he he will give opportunity after opportunity maybe it's your life in the place where you're working or among your family and that life that's being live and you're having to deal with this or having to deal with that but in your life it can actually be the expression of the longsuffering of almighty God or that soul that son that daughter that life maybe they're not even elect but maybe they're just to be part of those that are saved but your life and the longsuffering of God can let them know there is indeed a true and living god notice Proverbs 19:11 the discretion of a man deferreth his anger it's okay when offenses have come you don't feel like blowing sugar kisses oh brother the Samuel I'm full of the Holy Ghost well so am I but when offenses come they then have to be dealt with because there is a part about it that it that that part can so get stuck in our lives it can get stuck in our spirit it can get stuck in our mind you say how can that be you ever talked to somebody and they can recall an event from years ago and when they talk about it they have there is a part within it when they go to talk about it that it's almost like they're reliving it and you don't you do not catch any peace when they're telling it they're still telling it where there's an anger a resentment a bitterness why is that they've never dealt with that they've never allowed God to adequately deal with it but what a blessing it is that God could bring us to this attention to say that is to be dealt with and there is a way to deal with it the discretion of a man the wisdom of man deferreth his anger now notice I was speaking here the wisdom of man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression there's no way there's no way that a person's going to just be able that to draw from strength if they really haven't been giv themselves to the Lord and walking in the word as they ought to be I'm talking about walking in fellowship with God and praying and so forth there's no way because you're feeding the wrong dog you with me notice the wisdom James 3:17 but the wisdom that is from that is from above is first pure Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so when an offense has come now the choice is for Wisdom that defers anger this is where we need as Paul would say in the book of G ations in two different places if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit that our lives are are are regulated by the spirit of God and those are things that friends the further as we go in the journey down the down the road the further the journey the more and more I realize more and more that this guy is my enemy I'll just be very honest with you the very first thing that I look for when something comes up or this AR Es are this this is right here the first guy that I look at because this guy right here I know that this guy there needs to be attended to this guy can very easily there could be things accumulated things brought about these are things that I have to look at you are the same way you have to look at him the same way you say brother Samuel what are you saying I'm saying where we come to a place in maturity but we're not looking at well why did so and so have to say this or why did so and so have to do that that is not the suffering long of Charity that's looking for who can I blame and make an excuse for my attitude notice the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace now every all throughout those you streaming the few of you that are here we've all planted things the word sewn here is not dealing with a plant like one of these up here even though they're fake it isn't like taking one of these and you know you transplant it outside and now you know it has a good start no this word sown it deals with that of a seed and when you sew a seed it's got to be the right kind of a ground that it's swn in we know that the word itself is is that even of a seed now many times when a seed is sewn you're looking at that seed and you wonder and say when is that seed going to come forth when is this going to be turned around maybe it's something that you know an offense that has occurred between you and someone else in the assembly maybe it's in your family maybe it's with someone on the job and you're looking at a situation you're praying about it and you're asking God Lord help me with this and we're looking at that but remember when the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace first of all it must be that you have tapped into the peace of God that's dwelling there in your life because there's got to be then seeds that seed which is sown in peace that will lead to peace now I want you to think of this it's got to be then a cultivating of that you said let me just say be very simple with this what does that mean that means that when you're sewing in peace it means that you're not walking around and ignoring those whose tread upon you oh if the internet could ring right now it means that you're not just shunning them that have actually done you wrong but in order to sow peace somebody has to swow peace not a peace that the world giveth but a peace that comes from God God from the peace of God that's in your heart brother Samuel that sounds impossible I will agree for the first man but not for the new man who's been born again it's not impossible we have a fountain to draw from this is why James would go on be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord notice the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain he has patience for his word that has been sown be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth not notice be patient the coming of the Lord is upon us be patient be faithful enduring and giving of yourself notice the very next verse Grudge not a one against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door so how are we to live our life well brother Samuel I didn't speak to this person for a week the Lord does not have to give you a week's notice that he's coming oh you know pipe send out you know a tweet Samuel get everything ready buddy I'm coming on Friday morning at 11:00 no we are to live ready at any moment we are living ready there would be nothing that would hinder now you think well brother Samuel what if he doesn't come he does come he comes every day he comes every service there is a coming of the Lord where God visits our hearts and that coming what is it doing preparing us for his physical return Colossians 1:7 notice how Paul would write of this this report that is brought to him from aapas a fellow servant faval minister of Christ he declared unto us your love in the spirit for this cause we also since the day we heard it did not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness oh my my my my my it's one thing to suffer long but suffering long with joyfulness how can you have joyfulness what does Joy consist of what is Joy about the scripture as it speaks in the book of Nehemiah that's a Time the joy of the Lord is our strength it's dealing in the time of the Feast of Tabernacles which is a feast that looks back to the work that was done through the lamb that was offered up through the life Pentecost that had come forth so where does our joy lie in the midst of suffering long it is not in the Suffering The Joy is not in the offense like Oh Glory they they offended me I'm so happy you're a liar that is not what this Joy is talking about this Joy where do you draw Joy you know who you are you know who you belong to and you know you've got a fountain that you can tap into and draw and say Lord Jesus Lord I bring this before your throne Lord God help me Lord God help my brother help my sister help my boss Lord help my husband Lord help my wife Lord but most of all I'm the one who needs the most help in this situation me just take just a few more moments here charity suffereth long there's not one person that I'm talking to not one that hasn't suffered and won't suffer not one person but how how are we able to suffer how are we able to be of a long Spirit how are we able to be slow and to have that hold where it's it's not coming out because let's just be honest there's no doubt every one of us there's no doubt about it we've had to repent and say Lord should have been in prayer about this first over and over can't even get anywhere close to it tonight brother Brother Brad will let let us know very clearly he says if you're feeling this certain way don't you go talk to that person till you pray through prayer prayer has a way if we really get in prayer the right way prayer has a way of Us coming into a place to where it'll help us to see the other persons not their problem but it'll help us to see Lord no doubt there might be going through something Lord help them Lord Jesus see this is what this is what real prayer is real prayer is not complaining real prayer is not complaining about this is going on or this has happened or I've been wronged or I've been wrong and I look we've all been wrong that's not insensitive it's just counsel to help us to recognize in this place that to where than in our lives to see that there is a way to approach this and we have a source we have a fountain that we can we can go to let me just wrap let me just close out with this right here there's no way I can get into this another part of it but I want you to see this charity suffereth long and is kind Paul prayed that the people that the children of God would be strengthened with all might unto patience and longsuffering with joyfulness that God would give them the strength to stand like that and here the scripture said charity suffereth long and is kind so this is this is how the love of God it works works it's coupled with kindness suffering long is coupled with kindness it'd be one thing to suffer long but real suffering long doesn't mean that well you know you're just silent you're just off to yourself but it's come it's paired together the longsuffering is where it's not you're just being quiet and you're holding I'm holding this I'm holding this I'm just daring them to say something oh they just say something I'm just going to lay it out right here and you got your binders you know that the binders are this thick you've got them laid out you know you're ready to present your case that's not suffering long suffering long as of a long spirit it's not not saying that oh I'm going to pretend there was any wrong that pretending is not is not what we're talking about it's recognizing there's wrong there's offenses things may be sad or things done but the suffering of long is where as we're entering in to prayer with the Lord think about Moses let me let me just bring this together in the book here of Nehemiah with this part and we'll just stop with this here tonight there's much to say on this with kindness but in Nehemiah chapter 9:1 17 speaks of Israel they refused to obey neither were mindful of thy Wonders that thou did among them but hardened their necks and in their Rebellion appointed a captain to return their bondage but thou art a god ready to Pardon if I can say this one thing I want to be a Son of God who's ready to pardon I want to be ready to leave I want to be ready to Pardon that doesn't mean it's going to be easy but a Readiness a Readiness a Readiness staying in a place gracious and merciful slow to anger of great kindness and forsook US them not goes on to say when they made a molten calf and they said this thy God that brought this is the god that brought thee up out of Egypt and had wrought provocations yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsook us them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the in the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them light and the way wherein they should go thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheld us not thy Mana from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst did they deserve it no this isn't about what's deserved yay 40 years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not on the contrary they did everything listen to me now this scripture that we just read Nehemiah writes Lord this was you thou are a god ready to Pardon how were these scriptures made manifest God told Moses step aside I'm gonna kill them all right there's a part of the word injustice judgment but notice this Word of Promise dwelling in the heart of Moses at that moment how was these scriptures made manifest fulfilled it was Christ it was the Lord himself fulfilling his promise and he himself staying with his word even though for them he could he could have walked away from them they they hardened their necks as the scriptures said they did everything but the Bible said he was slow to anger and what I'm trying to say is this was manifest through a man who did not even have the new birth Moses wasn't even born again like you and I have had the privilege to be born again but he was in the presence of God and he came under the full effect that could be allotted in that time and where was he drawing from it was that of Christ that spoke out in that crucial moment in that crucial time let me just say this to you there are times in our life that where the spirit of God has so moved down upon our life and to help us in a crucial situation where we're aware he has taken over and you're aware he's got it in control I'm telling you what brother B talks about the maniac on the platform talking about the bull talking about the Beast I've witnessed that many times not just in that office back there counseling it I've witnessed it in the in over the phone I've witnessed it face to face I've witnessed this many times in many situations but then listen to me that in itself still does not take away that sometimes even in the midst of something that where the love of God can take over and there's ways God will guide that circumstance and when I come out from under that there can be hurt there can be things that have been said there are things that you know have been mentioned a certain way brother Samuel what do you do I must go to God In Prayer because you know why I don't trust this guy I'm just going to stop there tonight I'm probably talking about bride material I'm talking about bride material listen Saul Saul himself you watch how Saul conducted himself Saul was jealous saw what sought everything about David he was envious look how David conducted himself he had multiple times to take Saul's life but you see God allowed his character to be tested in situations he was already anointed king you've already been anointed Queen but God's allowing situations to test your character to prove the character for the throne that's fit to rule and Reign easy no this is not this is not something we're looking into and preaching that's just oh this is just easy it requires us dying it requires us really looking in on our lives and looking at things you understand what I'm saying when I'm praying I'm not looking at the other person oh the hurt and or whatever and everybody's been through there this is not this is not this is not sad stories this is reality I'm just sharing from from in my life and in my heart because it's a person can say oh yeah charity suffereth long and it's kind yeah praise the Lord amen I'm talking about living it I'm talking about an experience it ain't just something that just comes and goes but these are things that we must give ourselves too and these are experiences in our life there's things that you know even though God teaches us he trains us we come through experiences in our life it doesn't make the next experience easier it just builds faith that God will see me through this one the same way he's seen me through that one there's not one of us that would raise our hand and want to go through certain things again Lord I don't want to go through certain things again I don't want certain troubles in the church again I don't want this again I don't want to face this again I nobody wants to do that but to know this one thing that God who has seen me through seen you through seen us through that same God will see us through again but how do I suffer long suffering long with kindness and in that prayer as I told you sometimes that praying it takes quite a bit of prayer I'm just telling you takes quite a bit of prayer now what I'm telling you it should not be anything new to you but I just say it like this it takes more than me just praying over my oatmeal of the morning he take some real as brother Brian would call it grubbing out with with with that Garden hole digging things out digging it out I say Lord prepare me Lord help me Lord Jesus this is this is my desire that this be even further manifest in my life I'd say tonight if the thing that we could do is say God help me to be more sensitive let me say this to you the great Mysteries that had come forth but God has opened to us the word in this hour I want you to think brother Ram himself he had to take a break because when he had developed that complex he got he got to a place and what did he say he said I can't be of a help to nobody as long as I feel this way and you recognize this is why it's so crucial what I see in the ministry also of brother brandham I don't only see that in 1963 I can we can see that I can show you that down in 19 1955 it can show you at 57 show you in 60 brother brandham evaluating his own life not pointing fingers at somebody else but recognizing his need of more of God fenses come situations come they will come but within this part of it Lord in the suffering long taking it to God and prayer and being kind that takes along with that that takes the help of the Lord to be kind Jesus said pray for them who despitefully use you may God help us Heavenly Father Lord tonight dear God your word as we look into this Lord Lord just pouring over these things Lord for some time lord just meditating and looking into it to know that lord it's your desire to really help us lord it's your desire Lord to help any life that maybe has not come into that place Lord where they have this resource or this fountain that they're tapped into but dear God it's available to them may they just continue to surrender to you may they just continue to fall in love with you in simple obedience to your word simple obedience Lord God as you spoke to Abraham the Bible says in the selfsame day he took ishmail and those of his household and circumcised him he was obedient to the word of God lord Jesus I pray father for those of us Lord in our lives our walk with you then we realize Lord that it's moved into that place in our life or our life it's governed by the love of God but Lord no matter where we would be or how long we've been serving you we find ourselves Lord when we look at this in the scripture this is so contrary to that first nature I think of how brother Brandon would talk about in the message explaining the healing of gyrus his daughter he said here comes a man walking down the street and somebody says look at that old Holy Roller going there he said how that Satan would suggest to the flesh get even with him the flesh would suggest to the Mind get even with them he said but by the time it gets back to the inside if the good man of the house is there he say vengeance is mine saith the Lord it will come out Lord an emanating of love oh it isn't that Lord we don't feel the hurt it isn't that Lord that hurt is not felt charity suffereth long how could there be a suffering if there's not an impact to it there is is an impact a feeling to it but dear God you give us Grace to be able to be of a long Spirit help us Lord help us to recognize Lord God as children of God more and more clearly Lord You're not expecting us to do this on our own but dear God we've got a fountain we've got a re Source Lord Jesus I'm so thankful I'm so thankful dear God that there is strength there is virtue in that of the love of God the Lord Jesus would move in our lives in such a way that would help us to seow peace it would help us Lord that as Paul would bring it by the spirit of God it would help us Lord with the suffering to do it with kindness Lord I know this is this is so against our first birth our first nature but Lord God it's so in line and in tune with that new nature our new birth Lord God it's right in line with it this is this this is the desire from our heart Lord help us Lord as you fulfilled that word through Moses life where it was demonstrated that you pardoned you were slow to anger Moses also had his times where Moses displayed some anger so it showed the humanity that was still there but this portion of scripture that we read here tonight Lord in Nehemiah 9 the display of that longsuffering of the kindness that's the kindness of God you took a man subject to like passion such as we are a man who did not even have the Holy Ghost as we have it Lord but father to show the power where that word would find its place in the life oh God we want to give ourselves and live live from that Fountain Lord help us Lord help us to drink from that Fountain when offences come when things come our way may we lord draw from that Fountain Lord may we take Time Lord in prayer Take Time Lord to really consecrate ourselves before you you're the only one Lord that can make this word live and live it through US Lord God forgive us Lord of our mistakes our failures Lord our sin I pray that God may we lord God as we would come through this Lord and as you would take us Lord through these scriptures Lord May our hearts Lord be really warmed by your presence May there be a deepening in our life and in our walk Lord may it bring about in our life Lord the desire the achievement Lord that you would have help us Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen for I could never ever I love my Lord oh I want to live the way that he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love for I could never ever I love my Lord oh I want to live yes Lord the way
