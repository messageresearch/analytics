our hearts Lord for before you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you amen let's turn in the scriptures to second Corinthians chapter 4 now for Terry some days or weeks I'll be gathered together I'm glad that we're looking forward to a time where we will never depart real comfort that here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 Paul says but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not alive well we could just stop there on that scripture and just just preach and preach and preach and preach when you look at how that Paul would declare this this treasure the treasure is Christ's own life and to put this great treasure you would think that you would take something of a great such great value in such great treasure and you would want to put it in something that would somehow be what we would look at this is a worthy place for this treasure to be placed and you know how it is when you go to put flowers and different arrangements and things like that you know you really don't want to take nice beautiful flowers and put them in an ugly pot is that right nobody well you you look at that and you'll say my this arrangement and I look at this pot but you know God has chosen that he would display his power through earthen vessels and the earth and that whole word that Paul would choose clay its frailty and you know we're ever so strong but in the midst of when tests and trials arise that goes beyond our ability it shows up our and you know what God loves he absolutely loves to do verse 8 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always look at this word always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body so the manifestation of his life requires that death even within our body our life us dying it's one great death that gives us the opportunity to continue to die or we which live are always delivered unto death or Jesus see that the life also Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life and you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause now look at look how he words this year in verse 16 for which cause we faint not so there's a part of us that could experience to where that we would within our physical and within our emotional part faint but for this cause what cause it's not for the trial but for what will come out of it is where we are strengthened yet we don't know everything that's going to come out of it but we know this like job could testify in the very beginnings after all this is said and done I shall come forth as pure as gold job was testifying there's parts that is going to be removed from me that more deity can display itself but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at things which are seen but at the things which are not seen but the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen may God richly bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated brother Branham in a message of total deliverance and just meditating upon this hold here for some time now bella bream says it like this he says we may go through lots of troubles and trials just remember there's someone who knows lights the way makes it real so there's someone who is right there who knows who's lighting the way so that I can move through this trial this trouble that has come my way he makes it real he makes himself real he makes the whole the whole part of it not only making himself real but in the midst of this time God makes that faith that is residing and resting within you which is not our own ability it's not our mental capacity because our mind could completely fail but it's a faith that resides within is not a meant but it's a supernatural thing it holds in the midst of all things even when our in our own emotional realms would waver with things but yet that faith that is of him it holds ever steadfast he says I do not know what's behind the curtain but I know one thing and I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling every day trying to live for that great event that will take place someday when I shall see him face to face and tell the story saved by grace that's the day I live for leaving those things behind which are I want to press on and just keep going that's what I want to deal with tonight he makes it real God makes the whole the whole situation where his light and his presence he makes it real within our lives and you know I know that tonight no matter the scope that I'm speaking to that there are things that even in the midst of when you're going through a test or trial not just when you come out of a test out of a trial out of a situation but even in the midst of it there is an awareness and a supernatural part of it that you realize that it's not you that's even being able to hold yourself together to have this kind of an outlook that's it's it's just not there and you know I'll say it like this if it is within us to believe that we have some sort of ability to keep our look then that invites God to prove that we don't have that ability because God himself likes to declare that it is his power the excellency of it and God likes to show that his his power his glory but the only way God can do this is through that frailty of earthen vessels and God will allows you and I to come into situations as a matter of fact he just doesn't allow it he leads us into these situations that actually show forth the frailty the vessel there's not one of us in here that our vessel would be standing in line for a trial there's not one of you in here that would pray for a trial there's not one of you in here that would pray for a test not one of us never forget years ago and probably some of you remember as well brother you know brother jewel and brother jewel just has a way of saying things and brother jewel said you know he had a buddy a friend you know that saying man I'll tell you what I ain't had the devil ain't bothered me and so long he said man he said that guy he said he done nothing to me and so long he said I'd be said I'm just standing here saying bring it on brother jewel said I wouldn't be praying like that if I were you so jewel said the next thing you know he said that he said the devil got permission and he really poured it on that guy you see that's without wisdom we're not praying for these things but God because you see if it's us praying for him then it's us trying to tell god what to do but we recognize that our whole life as a believer is likened to that of a sheep and to a lamb one who is led that is completely not dependent in ourselves but dependent completely upon Almighty God and so when we look at this finding of how that God will lead us into these places and you look at how in this in Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 the Bible says that it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and saying to Abraham and and he said he behold here am I and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get the into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the young and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and cleaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went into the place of which God had told him this was not a test or a trial and let me just say it in this manner where Abraham where he was being tested by the surroundings of a work place or a surroundings of family or surrounding that this was not the setting and we understand that but this very clearly it was God who led Abraham into this place of being tested you see God's desire is to lead us and to bring us into these places of testing because remember God himself he's not the author of confusion he's not an author of frustration there is a purpose within it all and we understand that through the midst of every test and every trial as the author would inspire Peter to write it the fiery trial its fire that reduces and takes together things that are alloyed together and reduces it to where what will come forth is purity and it separates all the dross God has a purpose for every test in every trial and there's no way that when we can look at things remembering within this that everything is personal the Prophet uses these terms in the church age book he says it's personal temptations he talks about from the personal temptations he says and notice that each one of these are seasons there are seasons of temptations they're seasons of trying I'm glad for that because there is not one of us we are in within ourselves we're not even able to make it just even a day nor an hour nor time of trying of our own strength but it's God who gives us the strength to be able to move through what he has led us into and through the midst of it to think of it if there wasn't seasons there wasn't seasons it was one great big long process then you never see any development it's just like the seasons that are set forth here those seasons themselves are witnesses to you and I when we look at this now we have a witness that there is a springtime coming here's that right you know even in the new heavens and new earth God is gonna have witnesses of eternal life the Prophet as he said in the message future home he says where the Kings will bring the leaves and their trees will bear all those twelve different manners of fruits and he said the leaves will come in and brought in as a reminder to you of eternal life so God reminds these things through the changing if we could say of the seasons the fruit it's a reminder of eternal life and the seasons that God permits of testing of trying to come in our life and perhaps the season that you have just come through or you're in or you will go through it's not like any other season you've been through because not every season is exactly the same not everything is exactly the same entertaining the truth not every manner of testing and trying as far as the instrument or the vehicle of which is permitted he is always the same for each and every one sometimes you find others they're tested and they're tried within find answers for you you know even like maybe like myself that's everything with spreadsheets everything's at stood you're watching every penny you're watching everything like this you might say well how in the world this or how in the world death but then again remember here God allows everything to be tested sometimes it can happen with sickness it can happen with other things that can come up with family oh there's all types of things that can come up even to where the Prophet brings where there becomes even sometimes distress and a loss of joy within the church but God is testing to see what are you and I gonna do about all this hallelujah and I would say this right here Lord I do not want to dare to think that I am in a certain place and beyond testing but I I know that I need testing and I need trying that doesn't mean I'm inviting it I know that that is necessary for my growth and so it takes God and His infinite wisdom to guide us and that's a there's no point despawning honing in right here with Abraham that the Bible says that God did tempt Abraham and that word tempt is to test to try to prove and I love the word that's used here to assay so in this word it deals with that word of say means where there is a core sample that has taken from Ben need a surface where there's a great big drill that goes down and it pulls up a core sample and it shows what's beneath the surface you see everything can look ever so good upon the surface but it's one is beneath the surface and that's what without the testing without the trying what's beneath the surface doesn't come forth so God allows that drill to go down and pour out that core sample to determine what quality is there and here God lays this out with Abraham Abraham is at another crossroads and God brings him to this place he's brought to a place but Abraham here's where God is able to step in in the midst of this leadership is because Abraham even after what God has told him Abraham does not pull away but Abraham goes on the thick of this here Abraham knows what's going to be required he does not know that there's gonna be a ram stand there he doesn't know that he doesn't have that kind of a promise but what he has is is that God has told him to take his son you see if we knew all of this at the end of it it would no longer be by faith but here is by faith he didn't have to make that known to Abraham Abraham there had been such a tutorship that had taken place to her Abraham said had come to such a place - I can't explain it I don't know how it's gonna happen but I completely trust him and brother branham takes that verse of scripture right there and he relates that he said for I have received him as one from the dead and he said as though I've received him as one from the dead he's able to raise him back up again and the Prophet takes this scripture right here and he likens it to the quickening power of the new birth the same God that had brought before from death unto life is the same God that will change my mortal body it's trusting him trusting is not about understanding you see we believed God but Trust is where things don't make sense that's where trust comes in - think of how this equality all the way to the end let's look at another example here in the scriptures here is God coming down and fulfilling a promise that he's made to the fathers there through Abraham has been rehearsed and here they are in Egypt under bondage and God brings them out visits them and brings them out with a mighty hand and notice in verse 17 he said it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said less peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt look at this God is mindful of what you and I are able to bear you know God could have just opened up a full thrust when when when he first got ahold of your life but God knows what you're able to do he's not interested in overthrowing faith God's not interested in you and I failing but God's interest is is that as he permits in his great wisdom that tester trial he knows what is needed at that time of our journey and his word by His grace moved through that moment then God it's building in our life the word is coming the word is shaping and molding us preparing us that more of his life would come forth in the season of God's choosing so to see this here just for a moment do you have the PowerPoint up there can you or I want you to I want you to see this just for a moment and then I'll move on if you look at this map here just for a moment don't don't don't try to study it perhaps but just to look at there's many things the point that I want to draw you to you see of how that God brought them around the way that God took them if you're I were you were sitting down to draw a map about where you're gonna go and you're gonna go on a trip there's no one of you in here would say I'll take the long way around now I don't know how maybe I better retract it because there's some people say I want to take the scenic route and I want to ask all the gas station attendants which way do I turn and but not everybody wants to take the scenic route you know we're interested in getting the fastest way there is that right how to get there fast man I want to get there early but near notice they took not God did not lead them in the way of the land of Philistines which is right along the coast this route right here was a heavily traveled route it was a route that was paved where there was food that was water because there was all types of trading posts that was along the way all sorts of things that were there but along that way along that way that was right there there was all sorts of Garrison's that were along that way and that's what God knew you would look at and say God why don't you take him to easy way I think is if you take them the easy way they don't gotta cross nothing you know they don't gotta cross they don't gotta cross the Red Sea they don't gotta cross the Jordan they can just walk right through but God has a way and his way is beyond what our mind on our natural mind would be able to comprehend but listen this is what I want to get to you and in place like this it's God leading can you go to the next slide maybe that's a little bit more visual for the people you can see this right in here how that that let process going right through here if they God did not lead them up the coast right here right into the land of Canaan but God chose to bring them down this way God shows if you go back to the scriptures for me he knows what we're able to bear the Bible says it like this in verse 18 of Exodus 13 but God led the people about this wasn't this wasn't understand this God was leading the people Moses was there God was given directions and orders and Moses was giving that in that direction that leadership but remember where Moses as we said on Sunday Moses was getting gives instructions and directions from the very logos of God the pillar fire that was right there now to think of this God how that the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up harnessed that means they were inland sent you know set up there militarily out of the land of Egypt and here they come into this place and God speaks to Moses saying speak unto the children Israel that they turn and in camp and goes through all these places before it shall you can't by the sea for favor will say of the children of Israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness has shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon Pharaoh and a bonus all his hosts that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so so what is this what if why are they going this way who's this about it's not about them this way it's not about them this way is about God it's love that's choosing to lead them this way that's why now you could hear that the statements of how that the Prophet could say many times of how that no doubt that the Pharaoh could say it led them into a death trap what a poor general then that Moses that their God is but you see God was leading but God was not confused this was not without a purpose God was leading it that his glory might be displayed I want you to look at this in the Hebrews series chapter three God loves to bring you in trouble and the church said he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it Wow he loves to he don't begrudgingly he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it he just stopped up the Red Sea and the first thing you know March them right on into this place then Pharaoh Martin sent Pharaoh after them he said you see how God likes to do it he loves to display his power and love he is God and he just loves to show you who he is hold on to that now the trouble of it is today people say all them days is past how can God display himself when you're taught such stuff as that but God loves to manifest himself here the situations that you are going through or half went through or will go through it may not be something that has the Red Sea name upon it but it is just as much as an opportunity for God to show his power and his love amen notice this in the message conference he says to whosoever will let him come and write in the line of duty you hit the blockade oh I guess all nature just quivered why look what a thing here was Moses and Israel right in the line of duty with a pillar of fire leading them and led them right down into a trap the pillar fire to purify the H of the Covenant let the people into a trap oh so my focus should not be on the trap on the trial my focus should be upon God that's the whole sum of it all is not about the trial it's about God who's guiding and directing my footsteps so the pillar fire was leading them but remember God led them into this trap but it was not a trap to consume them but it was a trap that he might display his glory Oh hallelujah glory be to God now could that be mental telepathy says notice he said notice God likes to get his people in traps and see what they'll do every son that cometh to God must first be tried and chase him let me tell you something what God when God has done I'll work with in your life where there is a union in your life as we were looking at last Thursday a real union let me tell you something there is nothing that can take you away from the presence of Almighty God there might be all sorts of winds and terror tests and storms that will come your way but there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God you say brother send me what are you talking about I'm talking about a God who can reside in a life to where people and tests and trials come they don't fall out of church and fall back in but there is a power on the inside that hopes that keeps that maintains within it cuz sendin you saying that people can't get down discourage friends I'm not saying people can't get down and discouraged but I can I'm preachin by experience if you asked me to tell you what nyquil tastes like I can't go by what you say I know what nyquil tastes like because I've had it and I know the keeping power of the Holy Ghost cuz I've got it and he's kept me time and time again you see what I'm saying weekend you can't you can't talk things by well I know this quote and I know that do you know it by experience you gotta know God by experience and then we're not talking about things about you know what we've read or what we know that's all knowledge it matters about experience and experience comes forth through testings through trials through situations absolutely I don't think you have much stock if every time I felt down and discouraged I said you know what I ain't gonna be there tonight just send somebody else in I'm too downed tonight I'll tell you what if you had enough respect for God's Word you'd say you know what I find somebody else to come to me when I've got a time of need come on somebody we're talking about a God who keeps a God who establishes we're talking about one who is there that when we're going through the midst of something and all right there's one like David said in my distress I called unto the Lord and I said lead me to the rock that is higher than I david was emitting the situation is beyond me david said when my heart is overwhelmed leave me to the rock that's where I need to go to the resource hallelujah oh ma sure we get down sure I'll as the scripture said the outward man perish but friends let me tell you something there is an anchor that must be there within the soul that there is a love affair that when things are not going the way that we think they ought to go or what we've expected it to go that we say Lord in the midst of it all I trust you I trust you Lord God will send you in that faith in a way he trusts is faith but trust is greater because faith itself trust is not in that are the same but trust itself is where you cannot explain what's going on we don't serve God like that anyhow but trust is where we said Lord I have just committed to you I don't know how this is going to come out I don't know how it's good because you know what Lord I'm right now I'm just cancelling my order of brick I'm cancelling my order I'm not gonna build no more bridges come on now you know how Lowe's pulls up in your yard get the nice get the nice you know a will or Al than they and where would you like this load deposited but you know tonight you can just say Lord I surrender all the bridge-building take all the two by fours and all the framing and all the cement I cancelled the order but tell me you don't need a bridge no I just need a way through it I need Hill who lives the way to make the way through it he gets them to notice every Sun that cometh to God must first be tried and chasing he gets them there he brings you here he puts you in between opinions now could that be mineral at empathy telepathy could it be he'd put you in a trap to see what kind of a decision you're going to make the brand says search to go ahead and search the Scriptures they are they that testify of me think of this time right here Moses Syria's in the midst of this journey and he comes out and he speaks he prophesized in the midst of this time the presence of God is there right there because God's never departed he's right there in a camp to address the need in the situation and God moves upon Moses and Moses prophesized to them that they should not fear but stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and then immediately the very next verse how that Moses himself forgets his commission are you it you know the Prophet tells us that he forgot his commission you say well how did he forget his commission because the Commission is not just with one little certain angle in it the Commission is all encompassing what it is is that every obstacle that would come throughout the way God has said that I have come down to deliver them out of Egypt and bring them into the land of promise when God was making that known right there and commissioned Moses he had commissioned him that no matter what obstacles come out the Commission remains the same let me tell you something when you have been commissioned by the Holy Ghost himself it does not matter what tests what trials what obstacles come your way you don't matter how down you feel how low you feel you have been commissioned and you are commissioned to speak and go forward come on friends this is my workshop this is a living reality you have been commissioned by Almighty God and God comes down and he makes it known to Moses he's forgot his commission he forgot the authority that he had been given let me tell you you have been given authority when you have been filled with the Holy Ghost you have been given authority from on high Oh behind you when you stand with that word and you confess that word you stand there own that all of Heaven is behind that word because it's not your word it's God's words well Sammy I'll just think about how about say it he didn't say if you think to this mountain come on somebody if you think to this mountain but he said if you say to this mountain we're better salmon you got to think first you gotta let his mind be in you I absolutely agree let his mind be in you that he is the same God yesterday today and forever the same God that delivered my soul is the same God that delivers me in the midst of my afflictions how that God allowed Israel to see this great work you know that is just God's mercy he's already brought him out of Egypt he delivered him from the greatest nation on the earth that's what the Spirit of God had Moses to recall their attention to when has this been done before that a nation was delivered from a nation he's causing them to what consider the impossibilities you realize that in the book of Deuteronomy God takes even people who are not of the inheritance and he would remind him even those of he saw that had thought Giants of the land that they ran from before and God delivered him the horns all of those imps there wasn't this Israel one the only one that's seen Giants Diana comes were not the only Giants they were one of the many but there were others who were not even of the Covenant promise but they smoked Giants in there and God let Israel know hey these are people that are don't even have the inheritance of me behind them but they took what was theirs and drove them out how much greater what God on our side the riveters do surrendered to him how much greater God would be able you say oh brother Samuel these people they were organized people they had the ability with great armies and great sword you're going back to reasoning again you're going back to this was a man's strength this is not how the word is fulfilled by the strength of man but God allowed situations like that to be that he could prove and say look you want to see things these are not things that's impossible you know God can allow you to hear a testimony of somebody that don't even believe this message you can God allow you to hear a testimony of somebody you know I'm saying they don't even know what you and I know and God can allow even a testimony of somebody who don't even who don't even claim to serve God and it might be a concerning a surgery or whatever more and why would God allow that to happen for you God will allow that word to come across your way to do what encouraged you to over to be tagged on do you see friends we are people of truth think of this here it would have been easier if we look at it the natural way it would have been easier for God to take him up the way of the Philistines because all he had to do was wipe out a few of the legions he just destroyed the most powerful nation on the earth wiped out their army but God has a way God wanted to let them know I'm not only a general but I am your father I am your provider I am the one who keeps the clothing on your back Laurie I am the one who supplies for you when I brought you out of Egypt I was not without the thinking that you were going to need something to eat you're gonna need something to drink I've already provided that along the way God was letting them know everything to you oh that you have everything to you that's why your friends the greatest mistake that we can make is when we feel like that there are areas and parts of our life that somehow or another that we can oversee oh brother Samuel this in very spiritual I don't think I need to pray whether I should buy this car or buy this house or buy that I just think you know you've got to be able to know this right here you can take that mental frame of thought if you want to but I believe it's all in my heart that God's desire is to be over every area of our life and I just think he desires that that's my desire I want to know he's not about whether I can have something I want to know is this what you would have for me why because in every situation and in everything we are going to be tested and trial just because God makes known his will doesn't mean that it's going to be easy when God makes known his will for you to go it means them and means quite the opposite that you're gonna be tested and you're gonna be tried but him revealing his will is what gives you strength to look to him for deliverance in every situation he could have let him by the way of a fell Philistine but he chose not to do it that way so when we look at this here the scriptures in Matthew 6 verse 9 notice this scripture here I found it interesting a few weeks ago might have been a month ago or so by now I think was only some weeks ago as soon as I got out of a certain Thursday night service somebody sends me a text about this at this very portion of scripture that the Pope himself wants to change he doesn't like this portion of Scripture in him and a lot of the bishops and a lot of the lot of the Roman Catholics do think that somehow this is entirely wrong but we're reiden I'm not reading it because of that it's just because of what he's led down for tonight after this manner therefore pray this about prayer our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name back kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation this is what they want to get rid of and lead us not into temptation why would God godwyn lead anybody to temptation but he you got to understand the word temptation and we've already seen just two examples of how God leadeth come on somebody here's prayer and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen delivering us from all evil brother Brennan it says it like this I don't have it down but he refers to that part delivering us from all evil all unbelief all sickness all diseases all afflictions all super systems everything deliver us from evil he says deliver us from the evil of sickness deliver deliver us from the evil of depressed deliver from all evil this is how you to pray lead us not into temptation so as a believer now here we do we have this instruction our instruction is not Lord send a trial my way Lord send to test my way are you thinking you're big enough to handle it and you ain't even big enough to handle them when they come your way and you're not asking for him lead us not into temptation what's what to speak of weakness not weakness in within ourselves as far as sons and daughters of God that part that Zoey life that is inside the soul but weakness lead us not into temptation this word temptation is that experiment that attempt at trial that proving the trial of man's fidelity the faithfulness the integrity the virtue the constancy adversity affliction trouble sent by God and serving to test or prove one's character faith and holiness I want you to kick this into mind here lead us not into temptation he didn't say begging God God please don't say no trans Ord please don't send no trial know what I can't take nothing else right now nor that's that's not what he's saying but this this prayer this is the very part of our life because it this this life this prayer lead us not into temptation is not a prayer to dodge it this is not the prayer the prayer is not to dodge it but the prayer is lead us not in temptation showing that within ourselves we there is that weakness within ourself but our dependency is on his complete oversight that he leads us into those things and if he leads us there he's there with us where he led Israel to he was there where he led Abraham to he was there and I'd say I praise God for that I just want to say thank you lord thank you Lord Jesus there's three kinds of believers brother Branham he talks of it like this concerning the very trying and trial of the Lord Jesus himself and he says notice he says you've got something to do God's got something for you to do you may have some heartaches and some troubles and you may have some disappointments but do we pray to shun them no now notice how he broke this up with the testings and trials there are troubles there's disappointments I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands that every one of us has been disappointed you know brother Branham says it in prayer Lord you've broken my heart over and over again but I love you told him no do we pray to shun it we've had heartaches we have hardens their troubles we have disappointments but do we pray to shun them I didn't put this word on there but I have it right here before me but you I think we pretty much know what Sun means shun means to persistently avoid you know how you won't go down certain roads or certain things you avoid it it isn't like oh yeah I just bypassed that road now sometimes we do that oh I just bypass my exit but this is talking about knowingly persistently avoiding to ignore something to reject it so we don't pray to shun it notice the prayer the prayer lead us not into temptation is not Lord let me avoid but I don't want nothing to do with any test or any trial but lord please leave me not into temptation notice how the Prophet finishes this up he says Lord take me through them whatever they is whatever it is don't let me escape them if they're set for me just give me grace to go through that that's all so don't remove I'm not praying for tests and trials to be removed but give me the grace to go through it now let's look at this just hone it in just a little bit more into our sacrifice here stands the perfect Lamb of God his life upon earth he knows his purpose in knowing listen now in knowing who he is walking in a world of perfect faith he knows his purpose here after one of the greatest men great miracle has taken place in Matthew 16:21 the scripture says from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day he began to show them these things he knows his purpose then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying being far from the Lord this shall not be unto thee now that's love but it's not love in the same level that God has for him he's not reflecting that love yet because he hasn't received that love yet but he's only reflecting the level of love that he knows and he what he's doing is he's trying to preserve trying to hold back now notice Peter if you had asked Peter just at this moment if we could pause for a minute Peter what are you doing well I'm helping him out he don't need to go up there we need to safeguard him he don't need to go anywhere around Jerusalem he said this that then we know they don't like him up there but you see Peter there's an influence and the Lord Jesus deserves the influence but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan thou Satan aren't an offense unto me for thou Satan savourest not the things that be of God but those that be of man so he was able to separate luck job remember when Joel his wife spoke and said why don't you just give up and curse God and die Jim didn't say you speak you're a foolish woman he said you speak like a foolish woman so this discernment this offense thou art an offence to me this this offence the same word that's used like that of a stumbling block it's the word scandal a trap of snare any impediment placed in the way causing one to stumble or fall the Lord Jesus would not even allow that to remain there you know he could have walked on he could have walked on but he saw fit to address that spirit I will not allow that to have any residency why this is against the purpose that God has called me for I'll tell you what when the devil raises his voice against the purpose that God has called you for you've got authority to stand there and say get behind me Satan if there's anything that raises up against that purpose no matter what it is friends you've got an authority just stand there as a matter of fact not just having authority you've got a mandate by God to stand there and say get behind me Satan remember you don't have to rail against him you don't have to pronounce and give him lines of judgment the Bible said that God didn't even when Michael was disputing concerning the body of Moses he did not bring railing accusation your judgment is coming you know it the sentence will be read over you in the meantime get behind me I don't need to recite to you all of the Scriptures about your judgment you know and I'm telling you get behind me I know sometimes you might be in the middle of the shopping mall or the shopping part and you might feel like lord have mercy what if I do this out here Security's going to be around on me you can say it right there you can say it right there here might be just something you've formed with your lips because remember it's not Satan hearing the veracity of your words he's hearing the faith pulsation of your heart and what is that faith that he is my I am his child you know that trust is communicated that faith is communicated Jesus is getting rid of any impediment Oh was this impediment this impediment was siding with you don't need to go you don't need to go this was siding with him you know sometimes friend we need encouragement from one another yeah right but at the same time we don't need siding with as far as life can you move over I'll get down in the hole with you you got enough extra shovel I'll help you dig you understand I'm saying I know sometimes that I've looked at they listen friends I'm just telling you from me I don't preach on you obvious preach on me sometimes I've thought about when things have said and enquiries I'm encouragement maybe it comes in and you know I could sit there and think well I don't know what I'm going through they don't know what I'm facing I could I can dwell on that those thoughts can come to me friends and they do come I can dwell on that or I can say Lord you laid it on their heart to sin that you had them say that Lord God they could have went on by they could have passed us on by but you had him say that or you had this be done or this or this or drop this my way I can do that your understand friends that God it's not about God wanting to come down and make the hole bigger for us he wants to make himself known and take us through there's difference we can have compassion without having sympathy because sometimes when we get into a place of such sympathy we get into such a place that the person that we're trying to help they they come out of there and you step on their head and get on up out of the hole because they've all the holes already went bigger while you been in there but the same time only speak in fact some facts you need to keep your mouth closed because God is greater than all things [Applause] somebody's brought it up to me little while ago years ago when I preach the whole series of messages when the truth is not the truth the truth was there were giants in the land but that wasn't the truth the truth is I have given you the land you've got a balanced truth with the truth glory be to God this is greater than Ripley's Believe It or Not here's the Lord Jesus here stands the Lord Jesus look what he's looking as he's in verse 38 my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death terror you hear and watch with me he went a little further fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible now watch this if it be possible let this cup this trial this test this temptation let it pass from me if it's possible nevertheless not as I will but as thou his will was let it pass but he surrendered his will you see he could not go here being drugged he had to be led God doesn't drag us into trials he leads he leads he didn't drag him out of Egypt no he didn't lead him to that place by the Red Sea or dragging he let him he didn't drag Abraham up to mama rocky Letty now you know as it goes on here when Jesus says he comes and he sees him he says watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak his own flesh was weak you know brother Bram so so in many places but they were looking over one place for the RAM says he knew what awaited him he knew the lacerations that would open up and bones would be there he knew of all of the suffering that would come his way it doesn't say here now is my soul joyous my soul is sorry even on to death was a time of departing now watch this like Abraham at this very moment right here there is no strings on him this is not an act he's not a puppet he could have went and hid he could have fled to another country he could have done that but he remained faithful unto the end his love kept ting their love for what his love for the word his love for the father his love for the father was brett has been projected to you and me it was that love he could have fled there was no Springs on him but he surrendered his rights to be led nevertheless not my will vine will be done three times not once three times you say don't don't let the devil call you when you're praying about something don't let the devil get on your back well you must be it you must be faithless because you're asking God no no right here he prayed three times this was not an act he prayed three times if it's possible let this cup pass from me he wasn't praying to shun it he wasn't praying to shun it but he surrendered his will to the will there's a greater counsel at work here this is where the scripture could pick up and say that he was led as a lamb to the slaughter he was led as a lamb to the slaughter like a lamb dumb before his Shearer he opened not his mouth you know the scripture says in isaiah 53:7 look at what it speaks of you and i he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her Shearer's he's done this is the measure of suffering that Paul could speak of that is left to us as the Church of the Living God this measure of suffering so he opened not his mouth sheering it's shaving off I think a lot of us we know a lot of that we understand that but you know that that shearing off of that wool is very important there's a season for it they don't do it all the time but that wool is something it's not something that it's just it comes out it's not something we have to try to manufacture it just comes out but it gets to a time to where that there's a season that that wool needs to be removed and I don't I don't know if you've ever watched it I've watched it countless hours of things when I've studied on sheep over the years and looking at so many different things especially in other countries they still are still such a great even high occupation of this there's going in some of this things with the shearing there's sometimes Nick's cuts and everything else that comes but the shearing is to remove the wool because in that wool there can also be a buildup of parasites and it's necessary to be sheared down but the shearing down is such a great thing that they they don't even want to give the the sheep you can't let him eat as a matter of fact before you're gonna share him they want him cleaned they said don't you have dirty sheep when a Shearer comes to sheer it's got to be clean if you know it's gonna rain keep them in the barn so the door everything doesn't get matted and in an amazing how God and he's washing us by the law of the word what's he doing getting us ready for shearing he's getting us ready to be sheared we're land we're not forced we're not drugged we're led you know this is where that in the midst of it let me just let me just let me finish this point up here Paul said and I've we spoke to this here before Paul said in verse 10 of Philippians 3 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection not just that my soul has been raised from death unto life and as we looked at last week these opening scriptures that we read right here it's a dying a test or a trial that comes it's a dying to self but God's grace raised from the test from the trial we can say Lord if it was not for your grace that has raised me up as Paul said he had delivered us from so great a death he does deliver us and he will deliver us because the trying is what it's a dying what that the life of Christ might be made manifest if he had not went to count remember it was Almighty God who led the lamb the Calvary led him to Calvary aren't you glad he went aren't you glad he was led to that place if he had not been led to that place in obedience we would not enjoy the life that we have the night in him but he was led to that place and to think of how that Paul would say in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death being made conformable unto his death the Fellowship of his suffering I want you to think of this here tonight we understand that character itself you have an invitation to have your character mobile and that invitation is that call of the gospel that brings you and I through all of those processes into that of the new birth then by that new birth that life event is the character of life in us then our character is molded is being shamed and listen to me character we understand this statement is very clear what a tremendous statement it's not a gift nobody can give it to us I hope you understand this Jesus Christ Himself cannot give you character he can't give but he will bring forth his character in shaping earth because it's not what he's already given us eternal life and by the character of life within us is what molds our character so character is not a gift it's a victory if character is a victory that means there's battles there's opposition's there's tests that comes character is not given through preaching and teaching but character is necessary how so where does the ministering of the work where does that come in as Paul said that we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and that we come into the full measure of the stature of Christ we grow up in him so what does the word doing the word God is teaching us he's admonishing us he's showing us this himself is leadership in the word and what does it do our understanding being opened then we submit to that and God will mold our character taking that word and bringing forth through experiences you see that's why yes it's important the Word of God is so important word is just the presence of God the minister Lord is so important but as the brother Ram tells us that knowledge of the Son of God is where he said we can come into certain things and we say I don't understand this I don't understand that he said but if you sit down with it and just say Lord I don't understand it will you remedy it all together then then he said that's Holy Ghost knowledge but we need that understanding of the word and God has his way of communicating that so it's just like this we can leave out of here we have understanding in our life and here we can leave right out of here tonight understanding has come and we come face to face what in the world's going on you see but in the midst of all of a sudden your mind can come back it's not our mind over matter but the word is there and we say Lord let your word be formed in my life that word is the truth I give myself to you mould me shape me make me Lord in the midst of this time as you're leading me lead me through what is to be brought out of my life let it be Archie I'm glad to know that he's in control glad to know that he's over all the works at his hands and they're wonderful hey man you love him tonight anyone want to be remembered in prayer tonight as we go in prayer let's pray let's all pray together Lord Jesus we're just here tonight Lord is Lord of a family Lord a part of that great family of God Lord Jesus we're so grateful Lord tonight Lord you would speak to us Lord concerning these things Lord in our life Lord truly you come Lord to encourage us to strengthen us Lord you come Lord Father to direct us Lloyd your father I pray tonight that Lord behind each and every every hand nor the hearts Lord that are lifted up with for you your God I pray that you administer Lord to each one grant to them Lord God what they have need of Lord I pour my hand my heart is up with Lord as your prophet said there's times Lord in troubles we have disappointments things sometimes Lord don't go the way that we're thinking they're gonna go we have heartaches Lord but father we know that within it all that it's not Satan overriding you he can't do one thing unless he gets permission from so Lord we can see in your word that you're God how that you led the children of Israel how you let Abraham Lord God time would felassan all these examples but you've let your children in the midst of these times that father through the midst of it you might make yourself known Lord God within each and every one of our hearts Lord in our journey and our walk with you Lord you never intended Lord that our walk would be easy Lord as far as no tests and no trials but during the midst of it dear God you said and you promised and we have Lord God that testimony you have never forsaken us you are faithful Lord you are with us or God guiding us and directing us lord help us Lord with this northern understanding that's come Lord we want to submit Lord God ourselves Lord to the Word of God just asking Lord that that word will just takes such a hole in our lives Lord I pray the Lord in the midst of Lord suffering as your prophet led us into that he said this is where character is me is through something or I don't believe in any way then Lord that that we have to walk down and discourage I don't believe that that's what God that you would desire out of our lives for suffering yet we could Lord God and we all have been there may be some tonight Lord maybe there's a condition there's a situation in the life Lord but father they're looking to you tonight and deep within Lord beyond all of the disappointments and the feelings of their spirit in their body deep within Lord they have that blessed assurance that I know that the Lord will deliver me he's seeing me through him guide me through all this huh I can't see I can't I can't make sense of all this but my trust is in Oh father I pray tonight Lord granted Lord Jesus by way of your word your Holy Spirit taking that word Lord to our hearts Lord God we want you Lord to have the right away guide us Lord strengthen us each and every one more father our desire is to bring glory to your name Lord and help us Lord in the midst of it all Lord that God may our trust continue to grow greater and greater Lord in you Lord we love you and we praise you today thank you Lord for the tests and the trials that God that you permitted to come our way his true Lord as the scripture said we have prayed and we still pray lead us not into temptation Lord God we stand there Lord just as the Son of God Himself would pray let this cup pass from me Lord there's been many tests there's been many trials there had been many there's been many Lord of sickness and different things Lord that that we have I've asked I've asked that he would pass and I would want it to pass in a certain way hard father dear God you have given grace that is sufficient Lord each time and that's what we want to praise you for it forgive us Lord for when we have tried to form or direct you and tell you Lord what needs to be done or how there's but God we know Lord that you are over your over our lives you're guiding us you're directing us Lord all that you ask of us is just to be yielded to you and you make yourself known to us as all sufficiency nor do we love you you make it real to us Lord and we want to say that we love you from no wonder Paul could say I am persuaded that neither height nor depth nor creature nor Angels the power and the principalities nothing shall be able to separate us from the love God we have in Christ that love oh god how we think what a relationship what a union
