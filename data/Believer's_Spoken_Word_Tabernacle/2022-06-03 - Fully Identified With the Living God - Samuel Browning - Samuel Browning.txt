walking [Applause] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it's a wonderful way isn't it amen what what grace amen that god has given to us you know and we we truly realize that the grace of god is not just is god coming and instructing us teaching us correcting us moving among us in a special way amen it's not grace that just allows us to go and to live in sin and that's not real grace but real grace is a manifestation of his love and you know when his love has been projected and it comes to its end then sovereign grace steps in and produces what love has called for and that's the grace of god that comes out without love there would be no grace but the grace of god comes along and it touches our lives begins to deal with our hearts brings correction to our lives that's real grace amen and we are when one thing we're thankful for is we can have all the grace in the world coming to us but to have a heart that's able to receive his grace to have a heart that can receive his grace and to recognize that amen we are we are very privileged people tonight [Music] i want to say i'll say some more on sunday but i want to just say thank you for all who participated in the in the meetings and uh my what a wonderful time that we we had amen you know when we you come through times like that in in special meetings and they are special they are our special moments and special times that where god strengthens us he moves for so many various needs needs and you know sometimes when you as you come out of a special meeting whether you're here or whether you're someplace else it god it just gives you a charge it gives you a charge and gives you strength and you know god doesn't have to wait until a special meeting time but you you all know and you know even as you as as we mature in the lord there's a there's even a special atmosphere that gets set around special meetings [Music] if i could say it like this during a special meeting even somebody who's not called to preach could preach such an anointing it's here we don't believe in women preachers but a sister could preach it's such an anointing you know why everybody coming together with just so much of a one mind one heart one accord and we come together in those times and what god does for us in those times it has an effect upon our life now within every other service and every other part in our life and if that's why they're very special times and we thank god for those special times if we didn't have those special times or if those special times were every single time we wouldn't appreciate them as much but they're special times amen and so i'm just so thankful to the lord i really appreciated the ministering of the word and just what god has done right here among us so many different testimonies that had already begun to come in as of sunday even well even before sunday saturday night from from the prayer line different ones that begin to just speak and just to testify of the things that god had did right here and then even afterwards sunday morning and i know there's no doubt more to come and we just thank god for that i also want to they're not here at the moment i know they're on the way but brother joseph and sister ethylene whom we baptized here on on sunday morning the lord willing they should be here in in a little bit they got a little bit of a start they're coming from from akron and lord willing this is they're making this their home assembly so i also want you to pray for her son brother benjamin we were praying with on sunday night and just been just been communicating with him also and his heart is really tender and um so i just i say that to you because you know how it is sometimes when you go somewhere that's new we want to reach out to them and one thing about it i will say this is as i mentioned that statement the one thing that was a testimony and i'll probably reiterate this on sunday that among the believers from south carolina when they came here the very first thing that they made it made mention they said when we enter those doors right there there's an atmosphere already and they mentioned that even those that had come the first time and we want you know that's something that we would desire that it would always be an atmosphere that when lives enter you say well what about this one what about this one but you have to look and say what about me god doesn't need a whole multitude to create an atmosphere all he needs is one person brother ramsey tells us he said god will do more with just one person then you can have ten revivals you take one life that gets set on fire for god and it'll do more than just having ten revivals so that's what we want in our own lives because through that then it can affect others too but an atmosphere and i i to me if there's one thing that would stand out i i mean i believe god has given us a beautiful building and the work that the brothers have labored on i just i'm thankful for that it speaks of what we think about the kingdom of god it does the things that we do around here it speaks of what we think like david said i'm dwelling in a house and and the ark is growing in a tent david said no no no but one thing that i would rather have people to notice than to mention is to say the presence of the lord is there because there's there's buildings that will outshine this building maybe more elaborate and everything else but the second thing that was said over and over is how loving that the people are here i would rather have those two things that are mentioned than anything else you know brother branham was asked the question when the tabernacle first started early and the question was what are you preaching what's going on why do these people they love one another they can't wait to get together such love among them brother braham says the only thing i know to tell you is he says is i preach the gospel because it's a work of the holy spirit and we we all we always want to be that you know sometimes this is where it takes into effect you know sometimes you might feel like running to your car but remember we're here to serve priest is just isn't when we we we go away we go and we we praying for people that's part of priesthood but another part of priesthood is reaching out to one another well so-and-so knows i love them when's the last time you told them [Music] well they know i appreciate when's the last time you told them you see coming coming to the house of god is more than just an experience of setting on pews it's reaching out to one another eternal life is living for others and we see needs we see just like this with brother joseph who we baptized sister ethelene then brother benjamin we want we don't know what god what god will do but we want to encourage them amen and be and just continue just to really just to welcome them make them feel at home so oh thank you lord i also want to say today we have a real special guest here tonight and we have a one who's graduated and they're preparing now to take their boards for nursing that's brother william [Applause] i thought it was so wonderful today we watched him to walk and receive his pinning ceremony you know i look down through there each one of them and i said everybody every one of these peoples are coming through they all have been on a journey everybody's been on a journey and you know what the journey is not what you focus on but the journey itself is what also speaks a lot about our lives you know and so we just want to say congratulations brother william amen and i sure do appreciate the grace of god and i tell you we've got so many different people that are associated with medical maybe instead of building a fellowship hall we just need to build a hospital this is a spiritual hospital exactly this is the spiritual hospital but i thank god thank god for each of you amen could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning or this evening heavenly father we are lord just so thankful and so grateful for your grace lord once again that you lord have brought us together lord you've made a way that we can be here this evening lord father forgive us in times when we've just taken it lord for granted we we don't want to do that lord there's a purpose in our coming here lord this evening that's to hear from you lord there's many many needs among us dear god only you can meet every need that to me lord it stands as a paradox how that you can take a service and you can speak to this need and speak to this need sometimes lord you will say things very directly and then there's other times the lord that even in the midst of that has the holy spirit is speaking directly yet there are things the inspiration the spirit of truth just begins to direct us lord that the word might be applied to our lives we we just invite you lord this evening these next few moments that we would take lord in your presence we pray that god that you'll come and speak to each of our hearts lord i believe that everyone as they're gathered here this evening they've not come here lord to to be seen oh how we love to see one another but we've come lord to hear from you we ask that god you'll just let the man part step aside let every part of our being be yielded to you lord may you come be the speaker here lord this evening and speak to our hearts in a personal way we pray in jesus precious name amen god bless you tonight if we could i'm going to ask you if we just read one verse of scripture of joshua chapter 5. joshua chapter 5 and verse 1 and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart that their heart melded within them neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel may god blesses the reading of the word as you're being seated just going to a few moments here tonight and we've been looking for some time on prayer and i want you just to see a direction that we're going because in this particular service and some of the previous services you may not hear as far as maybe the word prayer although it's used continuously but remember that with every prayer that is that is offered up prayer is to be offered up with faith and it is faith that is looking to every promise of god and then once we have come then we that was good and i felt like something just killed here uh something once we come into christ fully then it's the token that's presented with our prayer remember jesus said in his word he said ask the father anything in my name and i will do it so it's according to his character his name and he said i will do it so it's god not looking at our words but it's god is looking at the heart and he's also recognizing the token because the token the holy ghost is an assurance of every promise of god so when we all through the scriptures we've dealt with this on prayer since back in january we know that when jesus how many times that the lord jesus here he would express and speak to us ask ask ask ask so there's things that god knows that we have need of and there are situations that we come to and we don't know the will of god in a situation when this is where we begin to ask and we begin to seek after god because as a believer god wants to so build our lives and our hearts into a place to where we're not pro-approaching any promise of god with a question but we're approaching that promise with a certainty that's from everything that's from deliverance to the baptism of the holy ghost healing on and on and on and be you know coming into the land and then once you're in the land everything because look if a person doesn't even approach the baptism of the holy ghost in in in the right way of looking at it and approaching it as a certain promise that that's a promise that belongs to me then they'll not receive it but when they can approach it brother branham would say it over and over he says it's a promise and you must fight for it it's fighting and it's worth fighting for you fight beyond all unbelief you fight beyond everything because it is a promise that is certain and it's ringing out to your heart that's how it is with every promise so that's kind of just in a direction the way that we're going and how god would be taking us here in this of joshua because joshua is a type of ephesians of where the believer coming into christ to where all promises are yea and amen and we come into this scripture here after uh they have brought up we looked at the last time the the they brought up the the stones uh out of jordan and then they placed other stones in jordan where the feet of the priest were and it was a testimony those stones were a testimony as they would set there when when it would come by and the children would ask of their fathers and say what does this mean it would be a testimony that how that god had parted the jordan and god brought up out of the waters and made a way for the children of israel to cross into the promise i'd say that was boy that would have been quite a family devotional time i'd say that be a time that where it finally started to peak in the heart of a child or you know of a young person begin to look and they could point back to those stones and said the same god that did it for me is the same god for you it would be a witness a a marker that they could point to and let me just say it in this way that witness and that marker is not something that we are pointing to out here but now within our own lives we can point to the work of the lord jesus in our own lives and say i've got confidence that what god did in me i didn't do it but he came and did it and the same one that made a way for me is the same god to make a way for you now when we look at this here in the scripture in verse 1 you know the bible begins to speak how that they the all of the kings and different ones on this side of jordan aware of where israel had crossed and now here they were they crossed through the jordan and we know that the jordan it it types that of death and and when they were passed over notice the this this working and this is what i want to bring you to this working of what they were witnessing it was the lord that dried up the waters of jordan so not only had he done that on the red sea but these other inhabitants had heard how the lord had dried up the waters of jordan before the children of israel until we were passed over now notice their heart melted at one point you know these people in the land canaanites jebusites all of them they were warriors they were people that were ready for battle they were accustomed to that but when they heard of what god was doing for his people this wasn't the people doing it it was god doing it and the people were walking in the way that god was opening and when they heard that their hearts melded there was not even any spirit meaning any courage it's what they even would have within them to stand up to it was gone all of these inhabitants of the land why was that because the lord was moving and the people of god were moving in step with what god was doing oh my wish i could really preach here you see this is why even when you're walking the scripture says walk in the light as he's in the light you see god shows you a little light unfolds and you repent of your sin it's god opening away and as you walk in that way satan begins to tremble and god begins to open more through sanctification and you walk in that it begins to change your mind and your way of thinking about things of of things that you once thought about now you're in your mind and your way of thinking you know i don't want to do that i i'm not going to do that that's not pleasing to the lord what is it it's a working of sanctification and as you begin to walk in that the same thing begins to happen as in this verse satan begins to tremble you say how would i know he's trembling because he'll start and he'll try to put everything in your mind he'll try to do everything he can to hinder and stop and take your focus away from what god is doing and then god further opens his word in that of the holy spirit moving down because remember the holy spirit the seal of god is only more of the same holy spirit that's already been working through justification sanctification now he has made a way for himself to come fully into your life see it's walking satan doesn't care how much we know about the word how much we can quote it but it's walking in step with the word of god let me just say it like this it's walking in step with the angel of the lord it's walking in step in the name of jesus christ and it makes the devil tremble hallelujah this is why there's a power of your confession just like when a heart is surrendered to god and they might have all sorts of things in their life and brother brahm says you begin to confess that you're saved and then you act like you're saved you believe that and he said you watch it works righteousness why because it's not your word that you're confessing you're confessing the word of the waymaker the lord jesus christ hallelujah he's the high priest of our confession i i want to speak here a little bit and i want to go to joshua 2. but i want to speak about being fully identified with the living god and in joshua chapter 2 this is going back to where the spies had went down there into jericho they when the children of israel were still they were still on the other side of jordan they hadn't crossed but i i want to go back to this and listen to the words that are mentioned here by rahab she said to the men in verse 9 i'll go right to that one i know that the lord might give you the land no what does it say hath given you the land now once you think about this here is rahab she doesn't even have the token yet but she is standing there and witnessing how god is moving and she knows what god starts he finishes there's already been testimonies that are going before the children of israel and she's standing there listen to me she doesn't she at that time is not fully identified as a believer but she oh my mama she is choosing to identify herself with the things of god and she said i know that god hath given you the land you that's where every one of us must be is choosing to identify with the word because the word comes among us and he identifies himself with us we don't deserve that that's the grace of almighty god but i want to be found as one when the word comes to identify himself in our midst i want to identify with him i know that the lord had given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you i want you to think of this now your terror they don't have it that's not them but what are they doing they're walking in step with the word as god is making a way let me tell you i couldn't get myself out of where i was and you couldn't get yourself out of where you were but you see this this is this reality here it only becomes a continual unfolding in the life of every believer because we in the land come up against obstacles that you do not know how we are going to overcome we know how but when we don't know the pattern or how is god going to do it but we know this one thing that god is more than able and i am a believer and he's still a waymaker how because he made a way that i could be free from sin what are the walls of jericho then to anything when god has freed you from sin what is anything then before you because now inside of you is the very deity of almighty god the very one that created the devil you've got the one inside of you who's greater than every devil who's greater than every demon who's greater than every wall of jericho [Applause] you can label those walls of jericho however you want to label them cancer disease and whatever you want to do but the god in you is greater notice this your terror and because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of amorites were that were on the other side of jordan scion and og whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man what's this say because of you now i thought it was god who was doing it right it is god who was doing it but god operates and proves his word through believers believers are channels that are reserved for god to manifest his word through god is a supernatural god everything he does is supernatural it's a paradox think of this because of you so it's them walking and they are identifying with god as god is opening away they're identifying with it god opens another way they're identifying with it you know what it is it's allowing god then to move through their lives yet even at this point they're not fully identified with the living god but they're in the right direction they're on the right pathway you see because god the bible didn't say that enoch hopped with god enoch jumped with god enoch skipped with god the bible says enoch what walked with god walked with god one foot in front of the other he walked with god that's the same way it is with a believer it's see every every every footstep is possession that belongs to you god has opened up that way now the bible says in deuteronomy 28 10 and all the people here was moses letting the people of god know and all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee is that right even when a person is baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they are taking on his name is that right they begin to walk in his name they begin to the bible says let them that name the name of christ depart from iniquity they begin to walk in making footsteps and making possession and the holy spirit is working in that life it's cleansing that life it's a holy spirit bringing it along and you know sometimes where we get we get to looking at we we want to look for mile post markers but you know what mild post markers is the greatest discouragement that you could ever have to your christian walk but what you should do is look unto jesus who is the author and finisher of our faith and he that began the good work in you will perform it to the day of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah because he is faithful and that he is faithful it's that same god that releases strength to you and i and brings faithfulness within our own lives i tell you what we'll never get anywhere with looking at our own self you know you can look in the word of god and as the words being preached you can look at the word and you know there's a shortcoming there that's a shortcoming there oh i need but instead of looking at it that there is grace sufficient to overcome there is grace sufficient to prevail god ain't speaking to put nobody down god's speaking to call you out it's grace sufficient for the challenge of the hour amen they shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord you know why the inhabitants were scared how many read in the bible where god told them in exodus 15 he said i'll send hornets before you what do hornets do sting what was that saying the angel of the lord shall go before thee my angel in whom my name rests why see look if the people of god would have just stopped right there and said well you know i praise god here we are up to the jordan there would have been testimonies up to that of the jordan but remember it was one thing for the red sea to be opened but it's another thing to see that that same god that opened it 40 years ago is the same god right here that it's god who has made a way into the promise and it took courage from the people i'm talking about the inhabitants of the land but it was building faith in the hearts of god's children you see god could not cross into that land i refer to this the last time we ministered god could not cross over into the land with unbelievers you see this is why god's not interested in debating god don't debate you know even when brother bosworth wanted to go down there that wasn't a debate brother brandon wanted one to stop brother bosworth that wasn't a debate he went down there to stand now think of this brother bosworth asked one question but that question was a platform that the angel of the lord came down are you hearing me now it was one who could say that it'll answer this question is jehovah of the old jesus of the new amen that question was a platform that invited the presence of almighty god to come down there in houston and vindicate his promised word in that hour let me tell you something brother bosworth was a very with a very astute man when you you read uh you know uh i think christ christ is our healer and you find how brother bosworth such a student of the word of god and more than a student brother bosworth believed in the supernatural he believed in the power of almighty god a matter of fact brother bosworth would take a chair and he would sat down on the platform he says i'm not getting up till everyone is healed he knew that god was the god of his word and yet brother bosworth was the one sitting next to brother level and when that began to operate brother bosworth had been in the meetings over and over and brother bosworth looked over and he said this is what i've been waiting on it was promised in the word of god that god would send this ministry at the end time you see brother bosworth was able to identify it's something he was waiting on oh my you see we are not as the children of god we don't get cabbage down or held down in one little part we're looking at going on with god as god would continue to reveal and unfold himself we will make footsteps after footstep after footstep why we are believers [Applause] [Music] i tell you every footstep you make with god will cause the devil to tremble it'll shake the gates of hell why because it's god making a way for his children hallelujah this is not man-making away it's god making a way man can make a way that maybe you'd fit in a church in a certain way and we'll do this for you we'll do this for you we'll do that for you but that ain't how god works god already knows who belongs in his church and god sends his word to seek out his children and the light begins to unfold and they make a step in water baptism and repentance they make a step in sanctification they make a step in the baptism of the holy ghost how god is opening the way and when god opens away and we'll make a step right there the angel of the lord that's leading us goes before us and when the enemy wants to raise his ugly head we can stand right there and say he that started the work in me will finish it and in the name of jesus christ i'm standing here not by my own strength not by my own doings i'm standing here by the grace of god that god has opened the way for me god's opened away from me god opens a channel of faith for you and i to be able to believe him for all things amen brother joseph says here i think god bless you amen good to have you here [Applause] god will do it through believers remember the rest of them they went over and spied out the land and remember before the 40 years had come they went over there the only thing they could come back and talking about was all the giants those are the kind of guys that you wanted to defend off your facebook page all they could talk about is that we cannots and we can't and we can't but joshua and caleb were in the minority ain't nothing wrong with being in a minority when god's on your side and when god's on your side if god be for us who can be against us when god's making a way tell me what devil can stand hallelujah oh my they came back talking about that but there was two that came back and they all they could talk about was the grapes they had the land of promise that promises exactly like god said what god promised our great great great great great great grandfather abraham what god made a promise there what he came through the message of moses i'm telling you it's just as true as true can be you know what that did when they focused on what the promise was it further released faith and a trust to believe god beyond every circumstance that was before him what was it the angel of the lord making a way who glory you see god crossed he crossed over jordan in his people god was walking right among them there ain't no man could cry could could not only part the jordan but it was dry you know how it is when it rains around here a little bit you go out there like a rain we had yesterday you go out there after just a little bit squishy squish squish right but when god dried up he parted the jordan it was dry let me tell you something when god makes a way he makes a way [Music] he knows how to make a way he could have took him any other way you know he could have took him another way into the promised land but god remember you can't pass into the promised land without going through jordan and jordan is a type of dying to self when a life comes to that place and says i'm tired of being me like jacob said i'm tired of being jacob when he got to that spot then it was time for that man that was on the inside that israel that was there the whole time it was time for that man to be released what was it the angel of the lord making a way you're here and we're here to not believe and you know why because the angel the lord made away he made a way oh god crossed over through them you see ordained for this moment you see this is why when we look at it of being fully identified with the living god to think how that god i want you to think of this here has god parted the jordan and they crossed over into the promises of god what was happening it was a promise it was a message that god had given and that message is more than letter that message is a person and that person is the person of jesus christ are you hearing me now so here within that of the jordan when they were crossing the jordan what they are crossing into is where god said i'm sending you as he told moses to bring them out of the land of egypt and into the land that floweth with milk and honey because redemption is two parts we come out of the world and then we go into christ is that right so now here that message that was spoken what had been rehearsed down in the slime pits and everything else now that message it was beginning to unfold it was opening there was a sounding of that word that was going up now when moses crossed off the scene god didn't send another message but god had joshua on the scene grace had been there the whole time now it would take grace to open a way to where the message was no longer a letter but now the message became a place of dwelling it became a place where they could worship my mama it became a place that they could raise their children a place that they could dwell in a place where they could really be who they really were let me say this to you in the message proving his word brother bannon preaches it down there in jeffersonville brother branham identifies the promise when the spirit of god came down on the howe river pillar fire came down as they were baptizing that person and there out came a voice from the pillar fire that said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of jesus christ so shall your message forerun the second coming of jesus christ the lord jesus is not coming to be united with a church building he's coming to be united with the bride one that is born of his bone flesh of his flesh one that came from him he is coming to be united with his bride glory be to god and as the prophet could look around and he would compare the ohio river to the jordan river because remember what came down on the ohio river was the announcement of the message that would forerun the second coming of the lord now remember there is a coming we are looking for as far as the literal corporal body of the lord jesus christ right and right now we have received the appearing of the lord jesus christ he has come in the fulfillment of his word and the holy spirit standing right here among us and vindicating his word to do what build faith in the promise and make us ready for his coming so the same way that message it opened up the way so has the message of the hour that god has spoken it has opened the way and through the message of the hour which is jesus christ we cross into the promised land hallelujah where you and i think of it where people can read the bible and they're reading it according to man's understanding but notice how the anointing of the hour begins to move and what does it do it opens up and unfolds unseals the writing of the book it makes christ known to you and i what is it it's the way that's being made for you and i that we can enter in with boldness it's the blood going before us that's what the message is that's why i'm being fully identified this is why as all of them many had walked remember in in and up there in those before they rejected gordon the land many of them had walked around that of the message but then when it came to moving on into the promised land they said no no we can't do that our children you know we have to do this and our children and we can't all their giants are too big but you see there was something that was ordained to the promise you see it's like something that just kind of wet your appetite a little bit you know how it is when you you know you cook a little bit and especially if you get privileged to be the one that does the grilling everybody else in the house you go ahead and have you a hot dog before anybody else has one cut your little piece of steak off you're right i'm letting the cat out of the bag again you can look at that and say man that's good oh boy that needs a little bit of seasoning but you see these are things that whatever you all you did was taste it but then you never sat down and really ate it come on now but you see when i taste it when i taste it my goodness i can't wait i want to open that door and say hey is everything on the table it's about ready to come off why because i'm wanting to be fully united with what i've tasted [Applause] glory what i have tasted is so good i want to be fully united with it and that's how it is with jesus christ i have tasted of him and he is so good i want to be fully united with jesus christ i want him to be the lord of my life i want him to be over everything in my life hallelujah we're not just sympathizers like a man would look at a woman say you know she make a good wife and everything else and checking off all the boxes and everything else we're not sympathizers you could go along with that all day long but until you take her and she becomes your wife brother says that's the way the message of the hour is you can sympathize with it well it's pretty good it's all right but until you take it personal and when you take it personally become fully identified then listen to me now this just don't just let this be a quote but now the same anointing is with you as it is with others this message is the anointing of the messiah upon the children of the living god this ain't a man's spirit man's spirit get on you you act like that man that's why these athletes and different ones they want to do everything like brother benny was pointing out everybody trying to jump from the foul line why getting the anointing of michael jordan's spirit on them right somebody want to shake their head a certain way or do they get an anointing of another spirit but brother when the anointing of the messiah which is jesus christ it comes upon your life brother it makes you act like jesus christ it's an anointing upon your life let me tell you something even when you're sitting here and you're looking to the promise of the holy ghost it's the anointing of the messiah anointing you to believe the promise for your life boy i feel like preaching it's anointing you to believe the holy ghost's mind it's anointing you to rise up beyond all unbelief beyond everything oh my my mama you see it's a parallel resurrection the disciples they walked with the lord jesus i mean i mean they weren't the only ones that had ate fish bread they weren't the only ones who ate that there were many others they were they were there they seen them they seen the uh uh the miracles uh they they see no they were associated with them they were so associated with them to where when they took him here was peter standing there and one of the ladies in that time a woman came up to him and said ah you're one of them aren't you you're one of them you you one of his followers see they had been associated with the message come on they had an identity with the message but they weren't fully identified are you hearing me now you see how could they have an identity because they had walked in what god had opened up to that part how many know there was prophecy that the bible said in zechariah smith the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered you see the disciples didn't know that that scripture had to be fulfilled right but here they were there was an association but once he rose on that third day here came the shepherd looking for his sheep just because peter had denied him did not change his status from a sheep to a golf he was still a sheep [Applause] oh hallelujah he was always a shape andrew was a sheep bartholomew was a sheep every one of them were sheep but they needed the shepherd and when the shepherd came he began to draw them back together why because they had to come fully into the promise to be fully identified with him i want you to think about this the word was not ashamed when it rose on that easter morning and said good gracious peter i'm s i'll tell you what how in the world man could you do what you did you just you dis disowned me it had already been prophesied before the croc crows three times you will have already denied me you see the word is identifying present actions but the word is not removing who he really was he was always a sheep he needed leadership out of that condition it would take the resurrected lord jesus christ the great shepherd to come amongst his children he began to you tell peter that i'm i'm rose i want you to tell my disciple and i want you to tell peter peter you know probably was lower than the padding under this carpet good lord how could i have done this how could i have done this peter it was already identified you were going to do it but you see what was happening the word was able to identify what was laying there and when the word it carried a personal invitation let me tell you something the word comes with a personal invitation for our life it's the word that calls your name it's not a man that calls your name it's the word that speaks beneath all the darkness and all the muck and all the sin and all the unbelief it's god coming after his sheep oh i know we all acted like pigs and everything else but down on the inside was a sheep that needed to be led into a place of life who could do that but the angel of the lord the great shepherd in whom dwells the name of the lord and would begin to open away oh that ought to give you confidence every step along the journey should give you confidence for the next step over the samuel i'm already in the land then you ought to have such confidence that even when there's walls that are so thick where they could drive chariots on like that of jericho it ought to give you such confidence to say that my god that's living on the inside of me he brought down walls that were bigger than that he brought down things that was walled in why what did he do he comes in and he's dealt with complexes in your life strongholds in your life he's dealt with pain he's dealt with hurt oh my what can stand before him [Applause] parallel what a parallel time they have been associated with the message but oh my after pentecost they were identified he was no longer twain like two people on an altar these two had become one hallelujah why because god had made a way let me just try to bring this down because there's no way i'm going to get to what we thought we're going to get through tonight but i want you to think about this in joshua chapter five let's read just a few more verses of scripture here tonight maybe just lay a foundation the lord willing for next thursday night here but i want you to think about this the stones you see we we can look at types of those stones that come up out of the jordan they were brought up out of the jordan and there were other stones that took the place of where those stones were at and we know that we deserved hell we deserved it you see this is why that even before uh calvary there was paradise paradise was not hell but paradise was a place that they were waiting all of the the believers that had been down through time that were walking by revelation and offering up the lamb of god you see they were there in paradise it meant something it was not church to them or it wasn't just doing things because daddy did it and mama did it and so and so did it it was something that was personal to them that when they they could believe god and and be able to stand there upon their sacrifice no matter how they felt no matter what it looked like think about job when job was being accused all around job was able to stand flat-footed on the sacrifice how could he stand there like that because god had revealed it to joe personally oh it might have been something that a daddy or mama would instruct their son but it had to come to a time to where it was no longer daddy's god and mama's god but it became my god it can't be the prophet's god the pastor's god he wants to be your god stones that come up out of there and i want you to think of this thought stones are decisions that are made in joshua 5 2 can i have just a few more moments in joshua chapter 5 verse 2 at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time now here was this here was the group that had not even been circumcised in the wilderness that was essential that's identifying you in the abrahamic covenant that's a sign and god seen they needed this sign right so here they are they crossed over the jordan dying to self and they're in a place now that god would tell joshua make sharp knives to circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rode away the reproach of egypt from off to you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day let me just say it like this gilga is the starting point gilgal is the place of trajectory in other words where you move forward from because gilgal is the place after you've crossed the jordan you've died to yourself now gilgal becomes grounds where you can start and you can stand upon are you with me it was that gilgal that elisha moved from a place of just associating with elijah being identified with him remember how he was walking and elijah could say you just stay right here i'm going to go on elijah said you ain't leaving me here i'm going where you're going and then a good thing another step you just stay right here no no no you're not leaving me here i'm going where are you going you know why because elisha listen to me now when elijah came by elisha he simply just threw the mantle on him and he moved it away what is the mantle the mantle is the anointing of the holy ghost it wasn't words that stirred up elisha elijah came by one who had the mantle upon his life and he places it upon elisha and justin he just brings it right around and elisha knew at that moment the holy ghost has touched my life and at that moment he made a decision this is it no more plowing here no more this anymore i'm following you what do you want i want a double portion of that spirit [Applause] i want what has touched my life what came to me and caused the decision to move from this field i want that double portion elisha didn't have one eye over here and one on elijah it was single and he kept walking god was making away think of it the word would say you can stay right here but elisha said no i got a greater promise than just this i got more of a promise than just he is a savior and the forgiveness of my sin i've got a promise of the holy ghost i've got a promise he's a sanctifier i've got a promise that he's a seal i have a promise and that's what i'm longing for gilga is a starting point how many times let me just try to just try now to bring this down here for just it's hard to try to find a stopping point because there ain't no stopping point sometimes you look at things you think well move through this thought right here and man i just i'm trumping at the bit to get into it and here we are 45 minutes later and where are we at but lord jesus it's been good not me no not me but lord it's been good the things that god's unfolding brother how many times that brother branham would tell people over and over in the prayer line you can look this up on your own he said you're standing here tonight because you've always wanted a place that you could put your foot and start from and he said tonight's your night a place that you can put your foot where god has dealt with your heart god has dealt with your life sometimes that's where our lives and hearts need they need a strength from god to come along and give them courage to put down a footstep and say he is my savior he is my lord and i believe he's my redeemer i am not resting until i am united fully with him why because it's his desire moving upon my life a starting point that we can place our foot upon let me just close with this stones themselves are confessions many times as we can hear where a confession starts and a confession is a wonderful thing when a person can begin and repent of their sins and make a confession and i confess as paul would say confess the lord jesus christ believe that he has rose from the grave raised up and he's ascended up confess with thy mouth thou shalt be saved and a confession is a starting point you're hearing me remember enoch walked with god didn't hop with god didn't skip with god he walked stones are confessions think how god brought those stones up out of the water it was confessions it were decisions that were made you know we sing that song i have decided to follow jesus you you know like brother benny he quoted that of winston churchill if a person can't change their mind then you can't change nothing and remember where decisions are made they're made in the mind and that's also the battlefield can i preach as it's coming the mind is no man's land so you know what that means it's going to be filled with something are you hearing me now oh the devil just feeling like this let me tell you something if we put a bunch of pianos up here there's all kinds of room up here right now but if we put a bunch of boxes and everything else and things pretty soon you can look and say there ain't room for nothing that's how we ought to feel our mind [Music] come on friends that's a no man's land we should fill our mind with the things of god oh brother samuel i want to fill my heart you can't bypass the mind and get it to your heart it starts there and it comes in through the channel of the mind and it drops down because let me tell you if you don't feel it with the things of god the devil will and he won't fill it with the things of god he'll try to fill it try to turn the word on you he'll try to fill it with all sorts of stuff what's he trying to do drag you down [Music] but that's no man's land but let's just fill it up let's fill it up with god let's fill it up with god hallelujah oh my that's why i'm listening to the message of the hour that's why as we read the bible that's why listening to good gospel music that's why staying in a real atmosphere what is it it's choices that i'm gonna fill my life with the things of god sure that's another message in itself but man but you see there's got to be a cutting of that stone brother bran says what good is there is a stone if there isn't a stone mason there to shape him into a son of god see you've taken that stone and then it's it's honing away it's cutting away the things of the world it's not the man you see a man could tell you and you know we could pull you aside or pull this aside and say will you stop doing this and you stop doing that now i believe the word comes across the pulpit it's a discerner i believe the holy spirit as it comes across it's the holy spirit that is the sword of the lord and what he's coming to do he's not come to injure us he's coming to cut out sons and daughters of god you know everything that michelangelo cut on that statue of moses everything he cut away was that which was not part of that image and god brings his word what's he doing because inside of you inside of me is a son and daughter of god and there's only one thing that can liberate a son and daughter of god and that's the sword of the lord to cut us into sons and daughters of god honey i hope it's all right she's probably saying dear lord what's he going to say and one night we sat down i don't know if his chicken or steak or whatever maybe i think probably chicken breast will eat a lot she said down and you know i've got to have i have to have a knife and my wife she had these butter knives laying there you know because we had used all the steak knives hey we usually always have steak knives here we had this butter knife i said what's this this this is what what's the cut your chicken butter knife see look it's got serrated edges but ain't the same ain't the same you know what i mean when you cut chicken i don't want the chicken to look like this when i when i cut it i want pieces that i don't have like you know like a like like a squid all over and i say that because of this god has not given his church butter knives because a better knife won't cut sons and daughters of god a better naphthouse were smearing butter a better night for putting jelly on you but the sword of the lord is for catting away everything that's unlike god and let me tell you as a son and daughter of god you are an offspring of god and god knows how to cut away everything that's unlike a son and daughter of god we ain't got no denominational butter knife good thing my wife is as sweet as she is huh god didn't give us no butter knife you can't cut nothing away with butter knife only thing a butter knife is make oh good members and butter them up and sugar them up and coat them up we're not interested in coating this up because i don't care what kind of home you came out of i don't care who you are i don't care if you were raised in this message i don't care if you know every quote if you know every scripture you still have to meet jesus christ in a personal area i don't matter if you were so good that nobody could put a finger on your life you must be born again it takes the holy spirit taking the word that has been promised and it raises it from a letter to a sharp two-headed sword where it's a word that you're just not reading but you're experiencing that word as it's going through your life it's moving through your life has a sharp two-edged sword what's he doing he's setting sons and daughters of god free he's shaping us into his image let's pray heavenly father you are our waymaker lord you've made a way lord for each and every one of us sitting here tonight that no matter lord where we might be in our journey lord like we looked in the very beginning that every step that we make lord as you would open your word and you would deal with our hearts as we'll make a step in that word then we have the promise it's you that's going before us it's you lord god that's your presence and as we would obey oh lord you you don't ask us to do nothing but obey you but to believe you that's the greatest compliment that we could ever ever give you is to believe you lord help us father all across this building lord those that are streaming no matter lord what the need might be or maybe it's for deliverance tonight habits lord god maybe lord god it's for the holy ghost tonight maybe it's for healing in their body i don't know their need but you know it lord but may they oh god as a child of god may they walk like you would identify that all the people shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee may lord god is a children of god we walk lord in your word that you're confirming your presence as you're dealing with our life now look at ourselves can i do this no will i be able to do the whole but may we lord god look unto jesus oh god you know the needs here tonight lord may you move accordingly lord for every need lord jesus may you find hearts that are willing and yielded to make footprints to walk in the way that you're opening up as the children of israel would walk across they lord those different kings that would be smitten before they would ever come to the jordan just lord god some of the some of the last few months before they'd ever come to jordan you would smite those different powers those kings lord no doubt god's sitting right here there's kings that's been upon lies but even lord god where you would begin to deal with those spiritual kings that would be setting upon lives lord god that would want to hinder keep back from the promise of god but you lord god would begin to deal with those kings lord god oh father and then bringing lord as your children to the place of jordan what is it every spiritual happening to the believer it builds our faith more and more and more lord jesus as we look to you and you said ask ask the father anything in my name and i will do it lord jesus i pray here tonight lord for whatever the need might be i wonder as our heads are bound our eyes are closed i mean wonder is an uplifted hand to the lord and say lord you know my need god knows what your need is spiritual physical financial god knows what that need is but here tonight you would like to say lord i have a need and i also am raising my hand to confess you are my waymaker lord you made a way lord god for me lord jesus i'm standing here to testify for this need that's in my life maybe it's healing in your body deliverance the holy spirit whatever it might be know that god is your waymaker father grant these petitions tonight lord that same angel of the lord that opened the jordan the same angel of the lord that met joshua on the outer walls of jericho that same angel of the lord is here tonight lord god granted may you continue to confirm your word to the hearts of your children lord as they would move forward in confessing the word of promise and saying lord be it unto me like mary be it unto me lord according to thy word grant it lord i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you love him tonight [Music] hallelujah oh let's keep making footprints let's keep taking possession oh brother samuel this is a fight it's worth fighting for it's worth fighting for god did not say when you come into the land or coming up to it and think about it what they faced was giants what they saw over there was giants god then there wasn't people in that land that was you know puny and short and everything else but notice what was there that stood out to those other ten god never said you know what i'm just going to wipe everything out y'all just walk on in but god could say it was a testimony that i'm the same god who parted the red sea and you walked on dry ground tell me when that's ever been before explain how that can be done well lord i i can't do that that's a paradox okay tell me who brought down these kings augabashan tell me who brought them down well lord you know we're not even we're not even a trained army exactly so that would be what that be a paradox lord okay tell me who opened up the jordan that you walked on dry ground lord nobody but you what's happening god's bringing things to their attention to rehearse you know sometimes you have to rehearse where god brought you from you've got to remember it's god that opened the way it's god that brought me where i'm at and the same god that brought me right here is the same god that'll take me the rest of the way hallelujah he did that to build my faith [Music] aren't you glad i tell you god likes testimony meetings i said god likes testimony meetings and his children love testifying like david said i will boast on the lord all the day long remember when the devil came over to brother branham said you know this man they call jesus he wasn't nothing but just like one of these preachers [Music] ah he really didn't do this brother brown said i thought just a moment he said satan you that's talking to my conscience i want to ask you a question [Music] you tell me how his life fully fit every prophecy and he made a promise that he would pay the price go away and send back the holy ghost don't stop there brother brahma said and i've got it [Music] you're going to start testifying about the things of god come on friends there's enough things we talk about that's negative there's enough negative all around us you go to start testifying on what god is doing in your life well brother samuel he ain't done something like what so and so no sir don't compare yourself to nobody else the bible said only a fool compares themselves to somebody else [Music] are you hearing me now we don't compare ourselves with one another but we let that word as it comes and it deals with our life and i don't care if god has done just this much in your life he's done more than you could have ever done and the same god that's done this much if the same god will do this much this much this much this much and you know what you'll be able to say it's all god it's all god i'm here because of god it's all god oh lord and the devil starts getting uncomfortable he starts getting uncomfortable with some russian matter the terror the terror of the lord is setting in upon him you know what's happening is you are identifying with the word [Music] hallelujah oh we're not people that's worked up we know where we're standing [Music] we know where we're standing we know the ground that we're standing on hallelujah oh i tell you if god be for us who can be against us hallelujah greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world [Music] oh glory be to god hallelujah in his presence so wonderful hallelujah it's so wonderful anything anything can happen in his presence oh blessed be the name of
