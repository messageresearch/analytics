[36:10] the
[36:16] amen not just
[36:18] any king
[36:20] but the king
[36:22] you know as i made mention last night
[36:24] you've heard me mention it different
[36:26] times here
[36:28] there's a lot of things taking place
[36:30] there in genesis 14 a lot of kings that
[36:32] were around king of sodom and all the
[36:34] rest of those kings
[36:37] but abraham
[36:39] by being a seed of god was drawn
[36:41] [Music]
[36:43] to melchizedek
[36:44] and melchizedek had come there
[36:47] because of abraham
[36:49] and you look abraham and melchizedek had
[36:52] a meeting right in the midst
[36:56] all of that was taking place
[36:59] temptations were being given i'll give
[37:01] you this i'll give you this i'll give
[37:03] you this remember abraham in the midst
[37:05] of all that he said i will not take even
[37:08] a shoe legend
[37:10] because my motive and my purpose
[37:14] is for god
[37:17] so he surrendered all
[37:19] to the king
[37:21] just a wonderful atmosphere here this
[37:23] morning in there
[37:25] amen
[37:26] and i say this morning if if if you
[37:29] don't know that god this is what the
[37:31] atmosphere it's god himself he inhabits
[37:34] the praises of his people and that same
[37:36] that same presence that same liberty
[37:39] is not just to be here at the house of
[37:41] god
[37:42] but it's to go with you
[37:44] in your life
[37:46] no matter what what situation no matter
[37:48] if you're you need to get your life
[37:50] really right with god to get it
[37:51] surrendered that's a liberty that's here
[37:53] this morning that you can lay everything
[37:56] down
[37:56] if there's things that need to be
[37:58] reconciled it can be reconciled right in
[38:00] the presence of god that's what liberty
[38:02] does so that then we might walk in
[38:05] liberty

[39:36] and
[39:37] appreciate everything how that the lord
[39:39] just uses brother wayne i appreciate his
[39:42] surrendering knowing that not only when
[39:44] you see that brother wayne ministering
[39:46] it's behind every good man there's a
[39:48] good woman
[39:50] and so sister karissa and the family
[39:52] supporting that standing behind how god
[39:54] would use the gift and we appreciate
[39:57] that and
[39:58] and
[39:59] i really appreciate sister bethany i
[40:01] told her last night i said you you can't
[40:03] just sing one you've got to sing at
[40:05] least two
[40:08] and
[40:09] she sang two of my favorite songs course
[40:11] she sang a favorite one last night and
[40:12] maybe it's just every time she sings you
[40:14] just
[40:15] but you know what i appreciate anointed
[40:17] singing singing
[40:18] i just appreciate anointed singing
[40:20] singing that comes out of experience and
[40:22] i really appreciate that and and man
[40:24] appreciate her and and brother isaac
[40:27] hatfield and for those of you don't know
[40:29] they've they've tied the knot
[40:31] back in august and they're
[40:34] officially married amen and we just want
[40:36] to say congratulations to you all
[40:39] amen
[40:41] we're hungry for the word of the lord
[40:42] aren't we
[40:44] i just believe that god has everything
[40:46] that we have need of no matter where
[40:47] we're at no matter what we're going
[40:49] through no matter what it is he has
[40:52] everything that we have need of
[40:55] and so let's just let's just look to the
[40:56] lord as we just invite brother wayne
[40:58] just to take his
[40:59] liberty this morning just god move and
[41:02] god god lead and guide our brother and
[41:04] remember
[41:05] brother wayne is he
[41:07] he could study and he can have a
[41:08] direction for what he feels
[41:11] right now to take but when he gets here
[41:13] and gets under that anointing and that
[41:15] channel and the polling starts taking
[41:16] place
[41:18] all of those things with with
[41:20] a minister and as a minister goes on
[41:22] with the lord and years he just learns
[41:24] to follow that anointing
[41:26] that leading because it can go right
[41:28] away from where the notes or the channel
[41:31] and he may not get to where he thinks he
[41:33] was going to get to
[41:35] but it's where god wants him to get to
[41:37] because the ministry itself it it's not
[41:40] about
[41:40] a message being delivered per se it's
[41:43] about god coming and meeting the needs
[41:46] of his people
[41:47] and that's when a message has really
[41:49] been conveyed because a person can
[41:51] preach a message and not yet preach a
[41:53] message
[41:54] but when god comes in and delivers it
[41:57] god comes to minister to our needs
[41:59] and aren't you glad that god just
[42:01] doesn't operate on the highway he'll
[42:03] come down a little street
[42:06] he'll come a call to sack
[42:08] god will come down a dirt road oh i'm
[42:09] glad
[42:10] aren't you glad for that
[42:12] let's just let's just invite him amen
[42:14] let's just invite him just to draw near
[42:16] whatever the need is this morning let's
[42:18] just invite him to draw near amen so
[42:21] good to see each and every one of you

[50:30] want to say that these men
[50:32] the leadership of the age of these men
[50:34] of god that are
[50:35] fighting this battle they're worthy of
[50:37] the honor that you can give them man in
[50:40] the book of joshua
[50:42] i want to read here uh
[50:43] in the first chapter if we could read
[50:45] here
[50:46] in the seventh verse
[50:49] excuse me let me start in the sixth
[50:50] verse
[50:53] now be strong and of good courage
[50:57] for unto this people thou shalt divide
[50:59] for inheritance the land
[51:02] which i swear unto their fathers to give
[51:04] them
[51:05] but only be thou strong and very
[51:08] courageous
[51:09] that thou mayest observe to do according
[51:12] to all the law
[51:14] which moses my servant commanded thee
[51:17] turn not from it
[51:19] to the right hand or to the left
[51:22] that thou mayest prosper
[51:25] whatsoever thou goest
[51:28] this book of the law
[51:30] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[51:33] but thou shall meditate therein day and
[51:36] night
[51:37] that thou mayest observe to do all
[51:40] according to that which is written
[51:41] therein
[51:43] for then
[51:44] thou shall make thy way
[51:46] prosperous
[51:47] and then thou shalt have good success
[51:52] we ask the lord to bless his words you
[51:53] may be seated i want to speak to you
[51:55] just a few minutes this morning
[51:58] on a joshua generation
[52:01] with an elohim revelation
[52:04] a joshua generation
[52:07] with an elohim revelation
[52:09] and joshua the first chapter here
[52:12] amen i think it's powerful at the vision
[52:15] joshua is having
[52:17] that god is commanding joshua in the way
[52:20] that he would be prosperous
[52:21] in the way he would have success and i
[52:24] believe each of us want to have success
[52:25] i believe we want to prosper in our
[52:27] lives and we want to be successful and i
[52:29] believe our success and the prosperity
[52:31] of our life depends on how we approach
[52:34] the word of god
[52:36] when the scripture here speaks of this
[52:38] it says
[52:39] that if joshua would be strong and
[52:41] courageous and he would meditate on the
[52:43] word then the word would make him
[52:45] prosperous and i believe that still
[52:47] remains true to the church today
[52:50] that they would meditate therein day and
[52:52] night that they may observe now
[52:55] to think about the word that they had
[52:57] received
[52:58] in such a time
[53:00] that god would have an entire nation
[53:03] focusing on the things that were spoken
[53:06] by this man moses i think it's
[53:08] tremendous to think about how powerful
[53:10] the words of moses were
[53:12] that an entire nation would dwell upon
[53:15] those words and then they would worship
[53:17] their god through the things that was
[53:19] spoken by this man i think it's powerful
[53:22] when you see that not only were they to
[53:25] uh to read his words but the bible said
[53:28] that the law should not depart out of
[53:30] their mouth so it should be spoken about
[53:32] it should be meditated on the word
[53:34] meditate don't just mean to think but it
[53:36] means that they would utter it and muse
[53:39] it and they would meditate and they
[53:40] would devise it and they would plot it
[53:42] and they would speak it and they would
[53:44] roar it and growl it and groan it and
[53:45] utter it and meditate it means to
[53:48] imagine it means to mutter to other in
[53:50] other words the word meditate don't just
[53:52] mean to sit and think about it but it
[53:54] was becoming the focus of their thoughts
[53:56] it was the focus of their lives it was
[53:58] how they set up the order of the
[54:00] tabernacle it was how they set up their
[54:02] homes it was how they lived their life
[54:05] it's how they approached the sabbath day
[54:07] the orders of their worship everything
[54:09] that was in their life was coming from
[54:12] their ability to meditate and to think
[54:14] upon the things that moses had spoke to
[54:17] them now to
[54:19] many people of course this had to be
[54:21] very strange that these people were
[54:23] gathering around words that were spoken
[54:25] by mortal man it was a very strange
[54:28] thing to a lot of the the people in that
[54:30] generation and time period now you're
[54:32] reading moses after you know thousands
[54:35] of years and in a rear-view mirror this
[54:37] was a great thing but in that time
[54:40] period amen moses had just departed from
[54:43] the people and to many people it was
[54:45] just another man it was just just a man
[54:47] who who it had had all these problems
[54:50] and he didn't speak well and you know
[54:52] there was all kinds of issues here but
[54:54] but see but but god had put something in
[54:58] the people that they had understood
[55:00] something had happened with moses uh in
[55:03] the unveiling of god brother brahm said
[55:04] it like this he said they seemed
[55:06] something happened and how he was
[55:08] different from the rest of the
[55:10] israelites he was different his message
[55:13] was different he was different from the
[55:15] priest he was different from anything he
[55:17] was a different person and those people
[55:20] seen something had happened amen the
[55:22] people had seen something had happened
[55:25] now what had happened is god had veiled
[55:28] himself in a prophet to speak his word
[55:31] to them
[55:32] that's what he had done moses was that
[55:35] living word to the people he was veiled
[55:38] by the pillar of fire speaking what was
[55:41] to be later veiled behind the badger
[55:43] skins that's what it see had something
[55:46] had happened is god had hid behind the
[55:49] veil of a man to speak words that would
[55:53] go in behind the badger skin and they
[55:56] would worship the words that was spoken
[55:59] from this man so there wasn't just words
[56:02] of man they wasn't just man's words but
[56:04] rather amen according to scripture now
[56:07] it gets a little strong here but thank
[56:09] you think of what you're thinking about
[56:10] now in the unveiling of god brother man
[56:12] said the word had to come to moses first
[56:15] the moses had the word and they were
[56:17] written by god and nobody could
[56:20] interpret them because moses had to
[56:22] interpret them first that's the reason
[56:24] he veiled his face do you see it here it
[56:27] is amen see we could pick this up we
[56:30] could pack it and everything else but
[56:32] it's got to be revealed in order to
[56:34] reveal it moses had to become god to the
[56:38] people you say that's nonsense but he
[56:40] told even moses himself you'll be a god
[56:43] and aaron will be your prophet see
[56:46] therefore he had to veil himself because
[56:48] god is always veiled moses wore a veil
[56:52] because god always veils himself that
[56:54] was god using a prophet to speak a word
[56:58] to deliver the children of israel and
[57:01] give them an order and way of worshiping
[57:03] their generation see god was not asking
[57:06] israel to just worship he was giving
[57:08] them order of worship he was teaching
[57:10] them how to worship him and not worship
[57:13] the god of baal or stardust or it
[57:16] separated nation of israel from all
[57:18] other nations in they had an approach to
[57:21] god they had they had a way they could
[57:24] come to god and it wasn't just the
[57:26] imagination of someone it wasn't just a
[57:28] something somebody pulled out of the air
[57:30] but it was god by divine order hiding
[57:33] behind the veil and speaking his word
[57:36] that they would have a proper place of
[57:38] worship now i'm going to use the
[57:40] scripture here in exodus chapter 4 and
[57:42] verse 16 the bible said god speaking to
[57:45] him he said it shall be he said thus
[57:48] he shall be thy spokesman of the people
[57:50] and he shall be even he shall be to thee
[57:52] instead of a mouth and thou shall be to
[57:55] him instead of a god amen in exodus 4
[57:58] and 16. so moses was told to be a god to
[58:02] aaron and that aaron was going to be a
[58:04] prophet unto moses in other words he was
[58:06] going to say the things that moses had
[58:09] said that would be the order of
[58:12] arionic priesthood it would be that they
[58:14] would speak the things that moses said
[58:17] amen and i believe that that should be
[58:19] the order of the ministry today amen
[58:21] they should speak the word of god they
[58:23] should say the things that had already
[58:26] been said amen he wasn't aaron wasn't
[58:29] pulling things out of the air aaron
[58:31] wasn't having his own ministry or his
[58:33] own ideas he was under an order and as
[58:36] long as he stayed under that order amen
[58:39] everything aaron said come to pass
[58:42] exactly the way aaron said it as long as
[58:44] aaron was willing to humble himself go
[58:47] read your bible sometimes and we say
[58:49] moses rod remember what it did but you
[58:52] reckon understand that aaron it was in
[58:54] his hands when it happened amen that
[58:56] aaron was the one that called for the
[58:58] plagues aaron was the one that called
[59:00] for the blood the water all those things
[59:02] were happening but they were happening
[59:04] by aaron through the order amen that
[59:07] they was under a prophet of god and i
[59:09] don't believe this is an hour for the
[59:11] fivefold ministry or the priesthood of
[59:14] this hour to come up with their own
[59:15] ideas and revelation but i believe that
[59:18] in this generation amen and if we can
[59:20] hold ourselves under the word of god the
[59:23] same pillar of fire that was speaking
[59:26] through moses is the same pillar of fire
[59:28] amen that is upon the church of the
[59:30] living god in this hour and in this day
[59:33] i believe it's important to see the
[59:35] authority that we're under amen if we're
[59:38] under god if we're under his authority
[59:41] amen then god is behind the words that
[59:44] has been spoken amen he is actually able
[59:47] amen to see the success and the
[59:49] prosperity of it i believe we should
[59:51] understand our dave i believe this i
[59:54] believe that we are a generation amen
[59:57] likened unto joshua
[59:59] joshua was in a season that he existed
[1:00:02] after moses had passed after moses the
[1:00:05] man that god spoke through he was now
[1:00:08] gone from the scene he was no longer
[1:00:10] there they hey man they they thought
[1:00:12] maybe that it was moses all this time
[1:00:14] their eyes was upon moses but now we
[1:00:16] begin to understand that god didn't say
[1:00:19] amen just moses but he was saying focus
[1:00:22] on the things that moses had spoke unto
[1:00:24] you amen that the words that moses spoke
[1:00:27] was what was behind the veils and the
[1:00:30] pillar of fire was over it wasn't the
[1:00:32] man moses they didn't lay moses his body
[1:00:34] back there it was the things that moses
[1:00:37] spoke because moses was only a veil that
[1:00:40] god could speak to the people amen wait
[1:00:43] a minute isn't it amazing that the
[1:00:44] revelation flows through the entire
[1:00:46] bible that god can use a veil you don't
[1:00:49] glorify the veil you glorify the words
[1:00:52] that are spoken through the veil because
[1:00:54] those words are words coming from god
[1:00:57] and they will make a successful marriage
[1:01:00] they will make a successful church they
[1:01:02] will make a successful life you've got
[1:01:05] to focus on the vindicated word that was
[1:01:08] spoken
[1:01:10] now we we look at this and i i think
[1:01:12] that if we study the scriptures and and
[1:01:15] i i'm a bible believer i'm a i'm a bible
[1:01:18] worshiper i i believe that the bible is
[1:01:21] the infallible word of god
[1:01:23] i'm one that believes from cover to
[1:01:25] cover this is god's word 66 books of it
[1:01:29] and i believe every word of it's
[1:01:30] inspired i believe every word of this is
[1:01:33] good for doctrine
[1:01:35] i believe that jesus himself said in
[1:01:38] search the scriptures and in them you
[1:01:41] claim to have eternal life and they are
[1:01:43] those which testify of me i believe this
[1:01:46] is the testimony of jesus christ i
[1:01:48] believe that the word of god is so real
[1:01:50] and true that every word of this bible
[1:01:53] will produce jesus christ if it's
[1:01:55] approached correctly you will see jesus
[1:01:58] in it amen amen and and we hold this
[1:02:00] bible it's the canon of scripture that
[1:02:02] we have but we think back about the
[1:02:05] bible and we think about and we we can
[1:02:08] carry ourselves back in scripture we can
[1:02:10] go back in the beginning of creation we
[1:02:12] can look at the things that happened in
[1:02:13] the floods of noah and we could we could
[1:02:15] we can carry scripture all the way
[1:02:17] through but but most of the time i don't
[1:02:20] think that we stop to remember that
[1:02:22] scripture was not written at those days
[1:02:25] but scripture didn't begin until moses
[1:02:29] in the days of noah or in the days of
[1:02:32] abraham or the days of adam those days
[1:02:34] they didn't have a written text that was
[1:02:37] called scripture
[1:02:38] until god gave a scripture in the book
[1:02:41] of exodus when god came and met moses
[1:02:44] and began to reveal to moses that's
[1:02:47] where the books of the bible begin amen
[1:02:49] the jewish people call it the books of
[1:02:51] moses or the the law or the torah it's
[1:02:53] the same thing you have amen but it
[1:02:56] didn't they didn't have it until that
[1:02:58] time i think brother branham said it
[1:03:00] like this moses wrote the five books of
[1:03:02] the bible the old testament of course
[1:03:04] then it said here in works at face to
[1:03:06] express both of them said they had no
[1:03:07] bible to read from
[1:03:09] they didn't have a diseases we got it
[1:03:11] amen see others who took it remember
[1:03:13] they only had it by revelation now
[1:03:16] that's the real thing see some some say
[1:03:19] uh say it by joseph in genesis there was
[1:03:21] no bible moses wrote the bible he wrote
[1:03:24] the exodus leviticus none of these
[1:03:25] characters in the bible had any bible to
[1:03:28] read from see see they didn't have it to
[1:03:30] help them in their crippled condition
[1:03:32] they were rugged men who was revealed to
[1:03:35] them by god and they stood right there
[1:03:38] and nothing could move them you think
[1:03:40] see
[1:03:41] they had that rugged faith because it
[1:03:43] was revealed to them of course we get in
[1:03:45] the season now where everybody's arguing
[1:03:47] about the absolute amen but but but you
[1:03:49] got to understand that the absolute is
[1:03:51] christ amen it's the revelation go back
[1:03:54] in the in the days of job amen or look
[1:03:56] in the days of adam or look in the days
[1:03:58] of abel abel didn't have a book to read
[1:04:00] from so the book wasn't the absolute it
[1:04:03] was the revelation it was the absolute
[1:04:05] amen and that absolute today is the
[1:04:08] revelation because you can hold a bible
[1:04:10] and hold a wrong opinion about the bible
[1:04:13] so the bible is only an absolute when
[1:04:15] the bible has a revelation that has been
[1:04:17] revealed then the revelation becomes the
[1:04:20] absolute of those people amen and i
[1:04:22] think about it today of how that god
[1:04:25] would meet with moses amen and he would
[1:04:27] bribe the bible now if you go back to
[1:04:29] the book of exodus it gives you a great
[1:04:32] example of how our bible was written
[1:04:34] that god met moses back there on the
[1:04:37] back side of the desert and appeared
[1:04:38] unto him in a burning bush now when that
[1:04:41] burning bush began to speak to him he
[1:04:44] introduced himself as the god of abraham
[1:04:47] isaac and of jacob since the beginning
[1:04:50] of the bible began with the pillar of
[1:04:51] fire meeting this man moses showing us
[1:04:55] amen that it took the pillar of fire to
[1:04:58] write this bible amen then this bible is
[1:05:00] not the works of man this bible is not
[1:05:03] just a good a good man got together and
[1:05:05] put their ideas together but it was the
[1:05:07] works of god appearing to a prophet in a
[1:05:10] pillar of fire now i think it's a
[1:05:12] powerful thing now he mentions well it
[1:05:14] don't take the pillar of fire well what
[1:05:16] about moses then i think moses is a good
[1:05:18] example amen that education has always
[1:05:21] failed amen
[1:05:22] if you if you want to think about how
[1:05:24] you should approach god then what about
[1:05:26] moses who was 40 years old when he
[1:05:29] decided he would not be the son of an
[1:05:31] egyptian prince but be
[1:05:33] recognized as an israelite he was a 40
[1:05:36] year old man before he decided that and
[1:05:38] then he decided he'd do something for
[1:05:40] god amen but he was a prophet by birth
[1:05:43] now he was a gene seed of god he was an
[1:05:46] abrahamic seed he was taught by his
[1:05:48] mother he was an israelite and taught
[1:05:51] that he was a deliverer of that lamb and
[1:05:53] he went out and killed one man and
[1:05:56] become a complete failure and was
[1:05:58] banished 40 years in the desert because
[1:06:00] he tried to do it through intellectual
[1:06:02] power let me assure you if moses could
[1:06:06] not do it by intellectual power then
[1:06:08] neither can the church of the living god
[1:06:11] it will absolutely take amen a divine
[1:06:14] revelation of the word of god and when
[1:06:16] moses met the pillar of fire he met what
[1:06:19] he lacked in that pillar of fire
[1:06:22] and from that pillar of fire then that's
[1:06:25] how the scriptures were being written
[1:06:26] now i don't have a a lot of time to
[1:06:29] detail these things but i'll just say
[1:06:30] this amen do you recognize when moses
[1:06:33] wrote the word at what point in history
[1:06:35] he is how many stories that was
[1:06:38] existence how many things that had been
[1:06:40] told the oral scriptures or the stories
[1:06:43] from adam had been crossed down all the
[1:06:46] way to moses that's all they had was the
[1:06:48] stories they set around now now adam
[1:06:51] would have of course visited with his
[1:06:53] great grandsons and he lived to be 900
[1:06:55] years old nearly he was he was i don't
[1:06:57] remember exact age but methuselah was
[1:06:59] 900 and something years old so the the
[1:07:02] stories would get generations it would
[1:07:04] be like you getting to sit and talk with
[1:07:06] your father's father's father instead of
[1:07:08] hearing your dad tell the story you
[1:07:10] would have heard your father's father's
[1:07:11] fathers tell the story so the oral
[1:07:14] scriptures would pass through the
[1:07:16] generations of how it was but i don't
[1:07:18] care how well you tell them hey man
[1:07:20] stories grow and and stories reduce
[1:07:23] things and and stories has a certain way
[1:07:25] of having influences of certain families
[1:07:27] or how
[1:07:28] now how the family see it wouldn't
[1:07:30] matter how you tell the story how a
[1:07:32] certain family would feel or how a
[1:07:34] certain situation would come amen but
[1:07:36] you recognize this it meant when it come
[1:07:39] down to the place when the pillar of
[1:07:40] fire met moses moses was getting the
[1:07:43] story from god how it really happened so
[1:07:47] when moses comes along and deuteronomy
[1:07:49] he said don't you add one thing or don't
[1:07:51] you take one thing from what i have said
[1:07:54] now notice this moses's revelation was
[1:07:57] superior to everything that was in front
[1:08:00] of him every story you heard every
[1:08:03] opinion that was given when moses's
[1:08:06] revelation was superior it may have been
[1:08:09] contrary but it was certainly superior
[1:08:12] to every other revelation i think it's
[1:08:14] powerful to to recognize today amen that
[1:08:17] revelation is more accurate than memory
[1:08:20] revelation is more accurate than it is
[1:08:22] amen now i i could go through here but
[1:08:25] i'll just pick it in a simple way but
[1:08:27] the apostle paul must have been sitting
[1:08:29] on the steps when jesus christ himself
[1:08:31] was at the temple and and gamalia was
[1:08:34] teaching paul the laws and the
[1:08:36] scriptures and there was jesus standing
[1:08:39] right there amen but but james and john
[1:08:42] and peter and all of them was walking
[1:08:44] with jesus amen but when the new
[1:08:47] testament was to be written and the law
[1:08:49] was to be divided amen the pillar of
[1:08:51] fire come to paul and paul's revelation
[1:08:55] was superior to every one of him and he
[1:08:58] even said in galatians though he says
[1:09:00] though a man or an angel would come to
[1:09:03] you he said if he says any other thing
[1:09:05] than what i have said let him be
[1:09:08] accursed amen he was including himself
[1:09:11] he was including peter he was including
[1:09:13] john james any of them that had walked
[1:09:16] any story that they had
[1:09:18] must line up with the revelation that
[1:09:21] paul was given he even went so far to
[1:09:23] said if any man think he'd be spiritual
[1:09:25] or prophet let him acknowledge the
[1:09:27] things that i have said unto him then
[1:09:30] real true spirituality is what a man can
[1:09:33] bring his life under the order of the
[1:09:36] revelation that god would release in
[1:09:38] that season i know a lot of people
[1:09:40] thanks to spiritual but show me how
[1:09:41] spirits you are amen how much can you
[1:09:44] agree with the spirit of god that has
[1:09:46] been released in the age that you have
[1:09:48] come if you want to see a real reality
[1:09:51] get your life in agreement with the
[1:09:53] revelation of the age you're living in
[1:09:55] him and prosperity will come to you and
[1:09:57] success will come to you and when it
[1:10:00] visits your home it will bring a
[1:10:01] blessing upon it amen now now you find
[1:10:04] out of course that that was god that
[1:10:06] appeared unto moses it was god that
[1:10:08] appeared unto paul and when he appeared
[1:10:11] unto him in the pillar of fire he
[1:10:12] separated the law from the from the from
[1:10:15] the grace and gave him a new testament
[1:10:17] do you know that the pillar of fire has
[1:10:19] appeared in this last days
[1:10:21] and it has appeared for a purpose do you
[1:10:23] know the bible promises that this pillar
[1:10:25] of fire would return to us amen that the
[1:10:28] word itself would be vindicated in the
[1:10:30] last day the very author of the bible
[1:10:33] amen promised that he would appear in
[1:10:35] the last days that the son of man would
[1:10:37] reveal himself now why would he do it he
[1:10:40] made a promise in john he said see i
[1:10:43] have some things to say unto you but i
[1:10:45] can't say them now but when the spirit
[1:10:48] of truth shall come he shall speak these
[1:10:50] things unto you amen now now that was a
[1:10:54] prophecy of the coming of seven seals
[1:10:56] jesus was saying i got things to say but
[1:11:00] according to revelations the 10th
[1:11:01] chapter they had been sealed until the
[1:11:04] day when the seventh angel began to
[1:11:06] sound and in the day of the seventh
[1:11:09] angel would be the same hour that a
[1:11:11] mighty angel would come down out of
[1:11:13] heaven he meant a pillar of fire would
[1:11:15] return at the same time a prophet was on
[1:11:18] the earth because that pillar of fire
[1:11:20] cannot come to the earth unless there's
[1:11:23] a prophet to introduce it every time in
[1:11:25] the scripture there's always been a
[1:11:27] prophet to introduce the pillar of fire
[1:11:30] amen what did it do it come to open the
[1:11:32] seals he'd come to give the bride the
[1:11:34] appropriate place of worship in an age
[1:11:36] of deception it come to bring pure
[1:11:39] authority back to the church of the
[1:11:42] living god we're not here on i hope so i
[1:11:45] think so maybe so it could be we have
[1:11:48] returned to the vindicated word of god
[1:11:51] and a supreme revelation in this hour we
[1:11:54] are not here on hope souls and maybe
[1:11:56] we're standing on the solid rock of the
[1:11:59] revelation of the word of god and if
[1:12:01] you'll stand on that rock the gates of
[1:12:04] hell
[1:12:04] cannot prevail against you the gates of
[1:12:07] hell will fail at your feet because god
[1:12:10] is given a supreme authority and supreme
[1:12:13] revelation amen it may be contrary but
[1:12:15] it's supreme
[1:12:17] it's supreme see paul wrote this new
[1:12:20] testament see what did he do he
[1:12:22] separated himself amen and went down in
[1:12:24] the desert for three years to get the
[1:12:26] revelation according to galatians he
[1:12:28] didn't go to a school he went to the
[1:12:29] spirit of god and paul separated the
[1:12:31] word now remember this god sent william
[1:12:35] branham out to tucson
[1:12:38] and he separated him
[1:12:40] even from the tabernacle from all of his
[1:12:42] friends he separated him and sent him
[1:12:45] out in the desert for the same purpose
[1:12:48] that god sent paul into the desert he
[1:12:50] also sent william branham into the
[1:12:52] desert to bring back a pure revelation
[1:12:55] concerning the opening of these seven
[1:12:57] seals now i know that people think
[1:13:00] they're spiritual but if they're
[1:13:01] spiritual let them acknowledge what god
[1:13:03] has done in this age
[1:13:06] amen now now i know uh i know it's
[1:13:08] something like you if you go back to
[1:13:10] apostle paul and you think about paul
[1:13:12] who wasn't even in the upper room when
[1:13:14] the spirit fell
[1:13:16] and that's something paul wasn't even
[1:13:17] there when the holy ghost came and 120
[1:13:19] were filled when the holy ghost paul
[1:13:21] wasn't even in the room he wasn't even
[1:13:24] there amen but you know what it was paul
[1:13:26] that told him what they had
[1:13:28] he wasn't there but it was paul told
[1:13:30] them what they had
[1:13:31] amen brother branham likens it a little
[1:13:33] bit hey man he likens it to to uh
[1:13:36] amen of how when the when they first
[1:13:38] found lights you know he said that one
[1:13:40] of them said that he says i believe
[1:13:42] there's i believe there's power in that
[1:13:44] lightning amen i believe it's franklin
[1:13:46] wasn't it he caught the key hey man he
[1:13:48] said there's power in that lightning and
[1:13:50] he got a lightning strike to come down
[1:13:51] and he got that that power in the bottle
[1:13:54] he had lightning in the bottle amen he
[1:13:56] see but edison wasn't even there when
[1:13:58] that happened amen but later edison come
[1:14:01] along and did something with the power
[1:14:03] that franklin had found amen but paul
[1:14:06] did the same thing paul set the thing in
[1:14:08] order and told them what they had when
[1:14:10] they had the holy ghost he told them it
[1:14:12] was christ in you
[1:14:14] the purifier has come into the church
[1:14:16] and he identified the position of the
[1:14:19] sons of god by the baptism of the holy
[1:14:22] ghost and set an authority in the church
[1:14:24] and gave it back its power in the book
[1:14:27] of ephesians set the church in heavenly
[1:14:29] places by the authority of the word of
[1:14:32] god now i don't know amen i hope i have
[1:14:35] the liberty to say this i know i do with
[1:14:36] brother samuel so i pray you you're okay
[1:14:38] with me but i i'll say it i believe this
[1:14:41] with all of my heart i don't believe
[1:14:42] william branham was here in 1906 when
[1:14:44] the holy ghost fell out there in azusa
[1:14:46] street amen brother man wasn't here when
[1:14:48] the holy ghost was falling amen
[1:14:50] throughout those 30 years he wasn't on
[1:14:52] the field during that time amen but amen
[1:14:55] the power was coming but they didn't
[1:14:57] know what they had they didn't realize
[1:14:59] what had come but here comes the prophet
[1:15:02] and picks up the baptism of the holy
[1:15:04] ghost and never does away with the holy
[1:15:06] ghost but he tells them you've got the
[1:15:09] lightning in the bottle but quit blowing
[1:15:11] it out the steam pipe and put it to work
[1:15:14] amen let the holy ghost come in the
[1:15:16] church and make an action of god come in
[1:15:19] power and then demonstration hey we're
[1:15:22] not fanatics here we're not just a bunch
[1:15:24] of emotional nuts come to scream and
[1:15:26] holler we've got a message and that
[1:15:28] message is a word and there's an
[1:15:30] authority that is returned in the church
[1:15:32] again come on you know i'm telling you
[1:15:34] the truth the gentile church amen
[1:15:37] actually has an authority according to
[1:15:40] the roman centurion they understood god
[1:15:43] and when jesus said i'll come to your
[1:15:45] house and heal them the man said you
[1:15:47] ain't got to come your personal body
[1:15:49] your corporal body don't have to come to
[1:15:51] my house if you'll just speak the word
[1:15:54] there's authority in your word that has
[1:15:56] the power of deliverance and truth and i
[1:15:59] believe today that god has spoke his
[1:16:01] word over the church of the living god
[1:16:04] and set it up in authority so brother
[1:16:06] branham comes along in the message
[1:16:08] trying to do god of service and he says
[1:16:10] so say i in the name of the lord. don't
[1:16:12] you add one thing don't you take one
[1:16:14] thing don't you put your ideas to this
[1:16:17] you say what i said on these tapes you
[1:16:19] do exactly what the lord has commanded
[1:16:22] you to do and don't you add to it now i
[1:16:25] i'm not going to spare any spirits of
[1:16:26] unbelief this morning
[1:16:28] i'm not going to spare any spirits this
[1:16:30] morning is that all right well y'all if
[1:16:32] i just preach the gospel this this
[1:16:34] prophet did not say you play what i said
[1:16:37] on the books and tapes he said you say
[1:16:40] what i said on the books and tapes now
[1:16:42] if we're going to believe this message
[1:16:44] let's believe what a prophet of god said
[1:16:46] and he set the order of a church not a
[1:16:49] tape recorder in the pulpit but a man in
[1:16:52] the pulpit that believes this message
[1:16:54] with power and authority hey man i i
[1:16:57] have to share what i believe i believe
[1:16:59] that we got a bunch of cowards who won't
[1:17:01] have enough manhood to stand in a pulpit
[1:17:04] and preach the gospel of jesus christ
[1:17:06] they hide behind the tape player and let
[1:17:09] brother branham say it but i want the
[1:17:11] world to know i believe what william
[1:17:13] branham said i believe it's the message
[1:17:15] of the hour i believe enough to say it i
[1:17:18] believe enough to stand on it i believe
[1:17:20] it enough to die for it but all of
[1:17:23] heaven is behind it this is not the
[1:17:25] ideas of some man it's the return of the
[1:17:28] pillar of fire that is coming the church
[1:17:30] of the living god and is trying to take
[1:17:33] over a body it's trying to take our lips
[1:17:35] and our eyes and our mouth and our hands
[1:17:37] and our ears god don't just want your
[1:17:40] ears he wants your feet he wants your
[1:17:42] mouth he wants the gifts of god
[1:17:47] amen i believe it i believe that with
[1:17:49] the situation we're in now amen that
[1:17:52] they have so bound the gifts of god in
[1:17:54] the church and a gift couldn't operate
[1:17:56] if it wanted to i'm not talking about
[1:17:58] your pastor i know i know but i know
[1:18:00] this little church here amen this is not
[1:18:03] the hour of the restoration of gifts so
[1:18:06] that's not the focus but god has yielded
[1:18:08] vessels and if he wants to operate a
[1:18:10] gift he's more than welcome to operate a
[1:18:13] gift as long as the gift is in order but
[1:18:15] if you think you're so spiritual that
[1:18:17] you can bypass the office of god you can
[1:18:20] bypass the things of god amen you ain't
[1:18:22] nothing but a spiritual heretic that
[1:18:24] needs to come under the message of the
[1:18:27] hour if the word of god has got an
[1:18:29] authority and it's got a power and if
[1:18:32] you want to be successful get under the
[1:18:35] message of the hour and let our priority
[1:18:38] come upon your life
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:41] now one thing about it ephesians the
[1:18:44] fifth chapter we did not put in this
[1:18:45] bible it's there and don't you add to it
[1:18:48] and don't you take from it
[1:18:50] god will have a fivefold ministry that
[1:18:52] is his dress where that's the way that
[1:18:55] god comes into the church he operates
[1:18:57] through the gifts amen not just gifts of
[1:19:00] tongues and knowledge tongues is the
[1:19:02] least of the gifts what about
[1:19:03] inspiration and knowledge and faith and
[1:19:05] healing there's nine of them all you
[1:19:07] ever hear about tongues because it's the
[1:19:09] easiest one amen to impersonate any old
[1:19:12] devil can speak in tongues but it takes
[1:19:15] a real child of god to come under the
[1:19:17] word of god and submit their lives to
[1:19:20] the power of the word of god in the
[1:19:22] season we're living in we're not looking
[1:19:24] just for an emotional caring away we're
[1:19:26] looking for a change of our bodies a
[1:19:29] change of our natures hey man now now
[1:19:32] you know me well enough to know i'm i'm
[1:19:34] one that believes i'm walking the back
[1:19:36] of the pews if you feel like it
[1:19:38] hallelujah and shouting glory to god but
[1:19:41] there got to be a reason why we're doing
[1:19:43] it
[1:19:44] this is not a pep rally this is a place
[1:19:46] for the house of god where judgment and
[1:19:49] truth and anointing comes upon the
[1:19:51] church but if it's got anointing and
[1:19:53] it's got truth then it will punctuate
[1:19:55] something on the believer's heart that
[1:19:58] they'll say amen to the word of god now
[1:20:00] if you want to have church like you've
[1:20:01] never had in your life open your mouth
[1:20:04] and say amen to the word of god you'll
[1:20:06] release something in your life amen
[1:20:08] there's something that will come right
[1:20:10] into that amen now i don't have time to
[1:20:12] go into it but i could i could show you
[1:20:14] amen it matters what you say
[1:20:22] gloria i think we're going to have some
[1:20:24] church in here today
[1:20:26] [Applause]
[1:20:29] now look what is going on so say i am
[1:20:32] the name of the lord you know the modern
[1:20:34] church
[1:20:35] in its present condition
[1:20:37] cannot bring on this rapture
[1:20:40] the modern church cannot fulfill the
[1:20:42] great commission go ye the world preach
[1:20:44] the gospel brother brown said so in the
[1:20:46] visible union he said it cannot finish
[1:20:48] up the great commission in his current
[1:20:50] condition
[1:20:51] the church world cannot fulfill mark 16
[1:20:55] in its condition
[1:20:56] because that it has denomination that is
[1:21:00] harnessing it from being a full believe
[1:21:02] in church
[1:21:03] they got to take they got to take pieces
[1:21:05] out of the bible and i i don't wanna i
[1:21:07] don't wanna act smart i don't mean to be
[1:21:09] smart but i am a little sick of people
[1:21:12] telling us we follow a man amen and
[1:21:14] they're belonging to some denomination
[1:21:16] it's a little bit heartbreaking to me
[1:21:18] they said well we just believe the bible
[1:21:20] then then just help me just a little bit
[1:21:23] amen amen just help me a little bit if
[1:21:25] you're not following a man then why is
[1:21:28] it that you'll turn down first
[1:21:29] corinthians 11 when it said a woman
[1:21:31] shouldn't cut her hair
[1:21:32] a woman shouldn't cut her hair that's
[1:21:34] what the bible said but the denomination
[1:21:36] will say something else and you follow
[1:21:38] the denomination then who is it
[1:21:40] following a man amen but but there's a
[1:21:42] bride on the earth we don't have to tear
[1:21:45] one page out of this bible we don't have
[1:21:47] to take one word out of this bible we
[1:21:49] can preach every word that's on this
[1:21:52] bible because the pillar of fire has
[1:21:54] returned to the church of the living god
[1:21:56] we're not scared of the anointing we're
[1:21:58] not scared of holiness we're not scared
[1:22:00] of the power of god when it comes to
[1:22:02] this bride you can't preach it too hard
[1:22:05] you can't preach it too deep you can't
[1:22:07] preach it too shallow as long as it's
[1:22:10] the word of god there is something on
[1:22:12] the inside of them amen preach the way
[1:22:15] brother amen let the power of god flow
[1:22:17] in the church amen it is the thing that
[1:22:20] will put the church in condition if the
[1:22:22] church can't do it in its condition and
[1:22:25] it's the commission god gave us then god
[1:22:27] is responsible to give the church in a
[1:22:29] condition it can fulfill
[1:22:33] so brother wayne what would that be
[1:22:35] brother brown says it like this
[1:22:37] he said see they're trying to do god a
[1:22:39] service without being his will
[1:22:41] but god is sovereign
[1:22:43] and people today are wondering why we
[1:22:44] can't have revival
[1:22:46] but do you believe god is sovereign the
[1:22:47] bible speaks it this way i was
[1:22:49] discussing with a group of my baptist
[1:22:51] friends not long ago
[1:22:52] and they said brother branham
[1:22:54] we can only have revival when we can
[1:22:56] take the word by word page by page and
[1:22:58] letter by letter
[1:23:00] he said i believe page by page two
[1:23:03] he said but they've been trying to do
[1:23:04] that all along
[1:23:06] he said we must find the greek
[1:23:08] interpretation of the word what the
[1:23:09] greek says i said i he said i haven't
[1:23:11] read too much but reading the history of
[1:23:13] the church pre-narcia and i see a
[1:23:15] council now i see a father's he said
[1:23:17] they were arguing back there about the
[1:23:19] greek
[1:23:20] he said that's 2 000 years ago one man
[1:23:23] says this and one man says that that's
[1:23:25] what the greek word means do you see
[1:23:28] amen people think when we get that page
[1:23:30] by page letter by letter hey man when
[1:23:32] when we whoa boy when we get it all
[1:23:34] lined up then we're going to have
[1:23:36] revival
[1:23:37] they've been arguing about the
[1:23:38] interpretation of that greek for a
[1:23:40] thousand years
[1:23:42] now brother adam actually tells us what
[1:23:43] happened he said god spoke it in a
[1:23:46] common language and they're trying to
[1:23:47] interpret it in an educated language and
[1:23:50] they're missing the meaning
[1:23:51] because the bible said the common people
[1:23:53] heard jesus gladly he spoke a common
[1:23:56] language and these bunch of
[1:23:58] intellectuals are trying to make it like
[1:24:00] he was an intellectual giant and he
[1:24:02] wasn't amen and he wasn't an
[1:24:04] intellectual he was a deliverer to god's
[1:24:08] people and he spoke a common language
[1:24:10] and the things jesus said now they're
[1:24:12] trying to take it by the greek and
[1:24:14] they're trying to bring it so brother
[1:24:15] branham turns around and he says see
[1:24:17] revival will never come till the
[1:24:19] sovereign god sends it amen that's the
[1:24:21] way it is and then he'll take some
[1:24:23] little nitwit that knows not even good
[1:24:25] english let alone greek and use him
[1:24:28] that's the way god does things
[1:24:30] he uses hey man hey man think about
[1:24:32] hattie right when god blessed her home
[1:24:34] how many important people would have
[1:24:36] liked to sing that in their home but god
[1:24:39] took a nobody and made us somebody
[1:24:41] because the supernatural god ministered
[1:24:43] in that home people people people long
[1:24:46] to meet this little woman had it right
[1:24:48] and before that supernatural was told
[1:24:50] nobody would have cared to meet her
[1:24:53] nobody cared nothing about the woman she
[1:24:55] was a poor widow woman but when god done
[1:24:58] the supernatural inner that's when she
[1:25:00] becomes special and i tell you every
[1:25:02] believer here today when god does a
[1:25:04] supernatural thing in you you're not
[1:25:07] just another people you're a
[1:25:08] supernatural people by the things of god
[1:25:11] amen our revival comes when god sends it
[1:25:15] so our revival is not denominational our
[1:25:17] revival is not intellectual our revival
[1:25:20] is a word revival do you see that's the
[1:25:22] only reason it won't end
[1:25:24] this revival of the bride will not come
[1:25:27] to an end every other revival ends in
[1:25:29] about three years look what it does it
[1:25:31] burns a little while it ends it burns a
[1:25:33] little while the reason it does it is
[1:25:35] because the life is passing through
[1:25:37] and it goes from the stalk to the husk
[1:25:40] and then it goes from the hust to the
[1:25:41] seed but once the life reaches the seed
[1:25:45] it's in a place you can hold on to it
[1:25:48] i don't know how to explain it other
[1:25:49] than just hillbilly amen go out in the
[1:25:51] corn patch in the middle of may or the
[1:25:53] middle of july or june just before the
[1:25:55] harvest starts coming and pick a stock
[1:25:57] of that corn put it in your cabinet see
[1:25:59] how long it lasts it'll rot on you
[1:26:02] because it's not in the right stage yet
[1:26:04] but when it comes to corn you can keep a
[1:26:07] carbocorn for years because the life has
[1:26:10] come to its fullness it's come to its
[1:26:13] reality and we're living in a season
[1:26:16] when god releases the revelation in its
[1:26:18] fullness it is a word revival we have
[1:26:21] come to and the word remains the same
[1:26:24] every day i don't care what you're going
[1:26:26] through i don't care the problem in your
[1:26:28] life i don't care the situation i don't
[1:26:30] care what is happening in your life if
[1:26:33] you'll focus on the vindicated word you
[1:26:35] will break out into revival any place
[1:26:38] anywhere anytime under any condition
[1:26:41] because it's a word revival and every
[1:26:44] revival has a miracle that follows it
[1:26:46] amen and divine healing sure is phil is
[1:26:49] following this bride's revival but
[1:26:51] there's a greater healing that is
[1:26:53] following this revival it is the change
[1:26:56] of our bodies this revival ends into a
[1:26:59] great rapturing revelation
[1:27:02] that will carry the church now
[1:27:04] you cannot bring this through greek you
[1:27:06] cannot bring it through intellect
[1:27:08] because god sealed it
[1:27:11] in revelation chapter 10 the seventh the
[1:27:13] sixth verse the bible said that it
[1:27:14] should be sealed
[1:27:16] god sealed it revelation 10 and 4 i
[1:27:18] guess it is god sealed this book same as
[1:27:20] he did in the days of daniel so the
[1:27:22] seven thunders according to brother
[1:27:24] branham now in the third seal he said it
[1:27:26] be the thunders that caused the revival
[1:27:27] the bride
[1:27:28] is that right
[1:27:29] then john and daniel both saw those
[1:27:32] thunders
[1:27:33] john in revelations 10 daniel in daniel
[1:27:35] 12. in both cases he told him to shut up
[1:27:38] the revelation until the time of the end
[1:27:42] so the revelation wasn't never written
[1:27:44] but the revelation was going to be given
[1:27:47] is that right and god would have to send
[1:27:49] a prophet to introduce the revelation of
[1:27:51] what daniel and john were talking about
[1:27:54] amen do you see what it is now and we're
[1:27:56] closing up but god has to unseal
[1:27:59] something to the undenominational bride
[1:28:02] so that they can fulfill the commission
[1:28:04] of go you under the world and preach the
[1:28:06] gospel you see amen i know i know people
[1:28:09] think all the times well they're
[1:28:10] preaching the gospel they're not
[1:28:11] preaching the gospel they're preaching
[1:28:12] creeds and doctrines and orders of man
[1:28:15] creating a bunch of heretics amen
[1:28:17] denominational people who say they love
[1:28:20] god and hate his word come on now i'm
[1:28:23] sorry amen but god is his word
[1:28:26] you cannot separate god from the word
[1:28:28] you you can't do it god is his word amen
[1:28:31] now when i say that i i believe then
[1:28:34] that god is actually got to open up to
[1:28:36] the church as he said in revelation
[1:28:39] chapter 22 the scripture says that that
[1:28:42] john met somebody amen that told him to
[1:28:45] unseal the book for the time is at hand
[1:28:49] so there comes a moment in scripture
[1:28:52] when the book becomes unsealed for 2000
[1:28:55] years men probes and can't get in it
[1:28:58] because god sealed it
[1:28:59] the bride's revival was sealed
[1:29:02] it didn't matter who tried to make it
[1:29:05] but when god opens it it's open and
[1:29:07] don't matter who tries to close it when
[1:29:10] god opens something it's open
[1:29:12] when he seals something it's sealed and
[1:29:15] you are living in the generation of the
[1:29:17] unsealing of the prophecy god has
[1:29:20] unsealed the word in this generation we
[1:29:23] have had an unsealing among us listen if
[1:29:26] you don't get nothing else out of this
[1:29:27] service this morning i want you to know
[1:29:30] your revival's been unsealed
[1:29:32] i want you to know your blessing has
[1:29:34] been unsealed i want you to know your
[1:29:36] position has been unsealed it is no
[1:29:39] longer a secret of who you are of what
[1:29:42] you're supposed to do or where you're
[1:29:44] supposed to go hey man do you know
[1:29:45] perfect faith is revelation isn't it
[1:29:48] then that's why i said and rahab by
[1:29:50] faith and moses by faith and noah by
[1:29:52] faith then there's a bride by faith by a
[1:29:55] revelation of the divine will of god she
[1:29:58] can take this devil she can take this
[1:30:00] age and she can put it under her foot
[1:30:03] because her revival has been unsealed
[1:30:07] so
[1:30:07] maybe i could say it to you like this
[1:30:09] then you're blessed this morning
[1:30:12] well it really don't matter what else is
[1:30:14] happening in your life you're blessed
[1:30:17] you want to help me preach somebody tell
[1:30:18] somebody say you're blessed
[1:30:21] you're blessed this morning
[1:30:23] amen i don't care the car you're driving
[1:30:25] you're blessed
[1:30:26] i don't care the house you're living in
[1:30:27] you're blessed a blessing does not come
[1:30:30] from
[1:30:31] from things and materialism in this age
[1:30:34] amen the blessing is that you have eyes
[1:30:36] to see and ears to hear the things that
[1:30:39] god has done kings have longed to see
[1:30:42] this and have not prophets have longed
[1:30:45] to see this and has not but unto you
[1:30:48] it's been given to know the mysteries of
[1:30:50] god because christ is the mystery of god
[1:30:54] revealed come on church the revelation
[1:30:57] couldn't come to the end time is that
[1:30:59] right and there's going to be an end
[1:31:01] time people then the revelation is not
[1:31:03] effective until it comes in the flesh
[1:31:06] you are the revelation of the mind of
[1:31:09] god from the foundation of the world
[1:31:11] this is the age of the unsealing he's
[1:31:14] unsealed a pride it has authority they
[1:31:17] have his name they know who they are
[1:31:19] they know where they're going my you've
[1:31:21] wondered what that bride is this is that
[1:31:24] this is that bride this is the mind of
[1:31:27] god you just don't know who you are but
[1:31:30] if it would strike you this morning no
[1:31:33] devil no power
[1:31:34] nothing will withstand that
[1:31:38] see you've got to give authority to the
[1:31:40] revelation
[1:31:43] because that authority has to be greater
[1:31:44] in the way you think
[1:31:47] come on not just about your hair
[1:31:49] not just about your dress
[1:31:51] amen it's got to have a greater
[1:31:52] authority not about just your teaching
[1:31:54] of the doctrine but it has to have a
[1:31:56] greater authority of even what you think
[1:31:58] about yourself
[1:32:00] even even if you can let your mind come
[1:32:02] to the mind of christ and see what god
[1:32:06] intended you begin to respect what god's
[1:32:08] done in you you respect how god's using
[1:32:11] you amen if a minister can only
[1:32:13] understand the reality that god is using
[1:32:16] them for then it don't matter what
[1:32:18] anybody else says they know their
[1:32:20] position with god and that's exactly
[1:32:23] what they have to do
[1:32:24] this is the unsealing of it in
[1:32:26] revelation 22 and 10 he said seal and
[1:32:29] unseal it for the times at hand
[1:32:31] now to me that's powerful
[1:32:33] then we are living in a season of the
[1:32:35] unsealing of that revelation
[1:32:37] he unsealed it amen now nobody can seal
[1:32:41] it back
[1:32:43] oh my
[1:32:45] no matter how many people says it ain't
[1:32:46] real
[1:32:47] no matter how many people says it ain't
[1:32:49] open
[1:32:50] it's been unsealed to this bride
[1:32:52] it's been unsealed to her now look what
[1:32:54] it is amen behind those seals was
[1:32:57] redemptive rights
[1:32:59] every redemptive ride of the church has
[1:33:01] now been unsealed she knows her rights
[1:33:04] we're living in age of rights aren't we
[1:33:06] they meant even they got grandparents
[1:33:07] rights uh in-law rights child rights
[1:33:10] they got kids suing their parents for
[1:33:12] their rights you know what a crazy world
[1:33:14] everybody's eat up with rights amen but
[1:33:16] there's a bride that has redemptive
[1:33:18] rights amen we have redemptive rights
[1:33:20] and we've got a right to tell the devil
[1:33:23] that our ground has been paid for listen
[1:33:26] if you went home today and somebody was
[1:33:28] sitting in your lunch here in the middle
[1:33:30] of your living room drinking your coffee
[1:33:32] hey man you've got a right to tell them
[1:33:34] this is my house i got a title to this
[1:33:37] house you've got a right to tell them to
[1:33:39] leave because it belongs to you and
[1:33:43] listen god has unsealed the bride's
[1:33:45] rights and every redemptive promise that
[1:33:47] has been made to the church is a right
[1:33:50] that belongs to you and if satan is
[1:33:52] camping out on your rights this morning
[1:33:54] you've got a right to tell that devil
[1:33:56] you are trespassing on the things of god
[1:34:01] it belong to me
[1:34:02] you're the right to kick them out you
[1:34:04] got a right to pull them out
[1:34:06] and tell the devil i don't care where
[1:34:07] you go but you can't stay here
[1:34:11] i'm not responsible for your ride home
[1:34:14] well we might as well preach haven't we
[1:34:16] hey man i'm not responsible for your
[1:34:17] ride home i mean y'all know what i'm
[1:34:19] talking about how many times you ever
[1:34:20] give a devil ride to church
[1:34:24] come on now i think it's time to break
[1:34:26] the date off today
[1:34:27] and say you might have rode with me to
[1:34:29] church but you got to get your own ride
[1:34:31] home
[1:34:35] you got to get your own ride home you
[1:34:37] ain't riding with me you ain't riding
[1:34:39] with me back to the house you've done
[1:34:41] all the damage you're going to do i
[1:34:43] think it's time for the church to shrug
[1:34:45] their shoulders back a little bit and
[1:34:47] say listen amen i'm not being arrogant i
[1:34:50] know who i am this is not about
[1:34:53] arrogance it's about humility amen
[1:34:55] you've got to be humble enough to say
[1:34:57] what the word says about you
[1:35:00] come on now
[1:35:02] arrogance arrogance actually isn't
[1:35:04] saying what the word says about you it's
[1:35:06] being too arrogant to say what the word
[1:35:08] says because you're thinking that you're
[1:35:09] doing something yourself you can't do
[1:35:12] none of this none of this is nothing
[1:35:14] about you this is the blood of christ
[1:35:15] that bought it for you so it belongs to
[1:35:18] you but it's been given to you so
[1:35:20] there's no reason to be arrogant about
[1:35:21] it it's been unsealed for you
[1:35:23] and joel chapter 2 the bible said i
[1:35:26] shall restore saith the lord the
[1:35:28] unsealing of the book is for the
[1:35:30] restoration of a true bride if you
[1:35:32] really want to be a true bride this
[1:35:34] message is for you
[1:35:36] if you really want to be the true bride
[1:35:38] of christ this message will bring you
[1:35:40] liberty to be that true bride amen
[1:35:43] listen this is the season when god will
[1:35:45] release both the former and the latter
[1:35:47] rain now according to the prophet in
[1:35:49] spoken word original seed there's three
[1:35:51] seeds planted there's a seed of oral
[1:35:53] roberts that was planted there's a seed
[1:35:55] of billy graham that was planted and
[1:35:56] both of them are growing fine he said
[1:35:58] but then there's a word seed to be
[1:36:00] planted
[1:36:01] is that right and that word seed was to
[1:36:03] be planted by the end time messenger
[1:36:05] brother graham said the gentile
[1:36:06] dispensation will be finished with the
[1:36:08] church age and when the anointed message
[1:36:10] arrives he says he will plant the seed
[1:36:13] of the entire bible
[1:36:15] plum from the serpent to the messenger
[1:36:17] in the former rain and then he will be
[1:36:19] rejected now people today hey man they
[1:36:22] have a lot of trouble saying well
[1:36:23] brother brown's rejected they're
[1:36:24] wondering if we should follow the
[1:36:25] message and all this but the bible says
[1:36:27] he would be rejected how many knows that
[1:36:29] how many knows the bible said that this
[1:36:31] message would be rejected you've got to
[1:36:33] know what you're looking for now but in
[1:36:35] revelation chapter 3 of the layout of
[1:36:36] seeing ages said christ is on the
[1:36:38] outside of the church
[1:36:41] do you see that christ is on the outside
[1:36:42] of the church and some people ain't even
[1:36:44] come to the realization yet the message
[1:36:46] is christ
[1:36:47] but the message has been put out of the
[1:36:49] churches because men doesn't have the
[1:36:51] strength to preach the word in the face
[1:36:54] of contradictions in the face of old
[1:36:57] heresies and old stories and old ideas
[1:37:00] that have been told they've not seen the
[1:37:02] supremacy of the revelation so they let
[1:37:04] somebody push him away from preaching it
[1:37:07] amen because see the messenger is
[1:37:09] rejected now here's the thing the
[1:37:11] message has been rejected but the seed's
[1:37:13] been planted
[1:37:15] the messenger has been rejected but the
[1:37:17] seed has been planted can i just can i
[1:37:19] just say it like this amen it don't
[1:37:21] matter how they treat the messenger the
[1:37:23] message is already here
[1:37:25] do you see what it is we can stand here
[1:37:28] today and see them it'd be like a man
[1:37:30] planting a row of corn and at the end of
[1:37:33] the row somebody comes along and hits
[1:37:35] him in the head to stop that corn well
[1:37:37] i'm sorry amen you should have dug the
[1:37:39] seed up because hitting the messenger
[1:37:41] doesn't change that he's already planted
[1:37:43] the corn amen and when the message has
[1:37:46] already been planted in the church amen
[1:37:49] the church can say satan you're too late
[1:37:52] the seed is already in the bride oh god
[1:37:56] come on church that first eve fail
[1:37:59] because satan got there before adam got
[1:38:02] there but in this season amen god got to
[1:38:05] you before the devil got to you amen
[1:38:08] that's why she's a sealed bride she's
[1:38:11] sealed to the devil but she's open womb
[1:38:14] to christ in his word
[1:38:16] she's a virgin bride she's taking the
[1:38:18] seed and we can say to satan this
[1:38:21] morning satan you're too late
[1:38:22] you're too late satan it's already a
[1:38:25] finished work the word is already in the
[1:38:28] church the power of god is already
[1:38:31] released in the church
[1:38:33] hey
[1:38:34] come on brother ma'am told us the story
[1:38:36] remember the story when the world war ii
[1:38:38] when the dove remember the world war ii
[1:38:40] story they there was a a group under
[1:38:42] attack and they tied a message to the
[1:38:44] dove's leg and they sent the dove home
[1:38:46] and the dust started flying away he said
[1:38:48] the germans shot it he said they cut its
[1:38:50] wings and broke its beak and broke its
[1:38:53] legs he said a little thing bloody he
[1:38:54] said but after a while he said that
[1:38:56] little dove landed in the camp
[1:38:58] and he said they had the message he said
[1:39:01] see the dove was hurt the dove was
[1:39:04] mistreated but he landed in the camp
[1:39:06] with the message listen amen the message
[1:39:08] has already been given amen they can
[1:39:10] keep cutting off the head of the prophet
[1:39:12] but the church already has the message
[1:39:14] the word has already been planted and
[1:39:17] this what you're feeling is the latter
[1:39:19] rain on the message of the hour your
[1:39:23] pastor's sermons are
[1:39:25] rain sermons and it's maturing the
[1:39:27] church in the harvest reign i'll tell
[1:39:30] you what you might not recognize it you
[1:39:32] might not understand it but i'll tell
[1:39:33] you this you are going in a rapture by
[1:39:36] these sermons you're hearing this
[1:39:38] message is preparing you for adoption
[1:39:40] authority for the changing of your body
[1:39:44] my
[1:39:45] no wonder the devil's after this
[1:39:46] preaching no wonder he's after the word
[1:39:49] of god
[1:39:51] isaiah might be after it too
[1:39:56] now god
[1:39:57] sends his holy ghost on the planet word
[1:40:00] now what is it been planted in here
[1:40:01] brother brahm says it like this you know
[1:40:02] pentecost was a shuck
[1:40:04] right
[1:40:05] he said now the shuck has given strength
[1:40:07] into the seed
[1:40:08] he said it was a good chuck it served
[1:40:10] its time but it is the word bride of the
[1:40:12] word groom
[1:40:14] therefore we must be that word bride
[1:40:16] it's the manifestation of the hour
[1:40:18] the living oracles amen i'm going to
[1:40:21] skip through it the living oracles and
[1:40:23] the attributes of god in the formation
[1:40:25] of the bride isn't that something an
[1:40:27] attribute of god in the formation of the
[1:40:29] bride people want to see god well look
[1:40:31] around a little
[1:40:35] you're literally seeing the mind of god
[1:40:38] manifesting itself in the attribute of
[1:40:40] bride it's in the form of pride if you
[1:40:43] can see it in a rose why couldn't you
[1:40:45] see it in a believer
[1:40:46] if you can see it in a lily why couldn't
[1:40:48] you see it in a believer if you can see
[1:40:49] it in the sun and the moon and the stars
[1:40:51] why not in the believer she's the
[1:40:53] redeemed of god
[1:40:55] amen do you see amen i know i know that
[1:40:58] word brian now we we can put all kinds
[1:41:01] of translations to that and i know that
[1:41:04] we we have certain uh sections
[1:41:07] among us and and good people but they
[1:41:10] get a little in the direction they get a
[1:41:11] little bit a word bride means
[1:41:14] intellectual
[1:41:16] it's what word right means it means
[1:41:17] intellectuals so if we put all the
[1:41:19] quotes together correctly see then we
[1:41:21] become uh we become real educated
[1:41:23] message guys
[1:41:24] but let me let me just give you a news
[1:41:26] flash this morning you can put together
[1:41:28] the words of god with intellectual power
[1:41:31] and it only brings intellectual
[1:41:32] stimulation
[1:41:35] that's the reason some services really
[1:41:37] never get off of the ground and people
[1:41:39] never really get saved or get filled
[1:41:40] with the holy ghost because there's a
[1:41:42] lot of intellectual preaching
[1:41:44] amen and after a while people get a
[1:41:46] taste for intellectual and they want to
[1:41:48] draw the word of god through an
[1:41:50] intellectual filter amen but you know
[1:41:52] when god really puts a gift in a man's
[1:41:54] life that gift is to take the word of
[1:41:56] god and put it together under a
[1:41:58] supernatural instruction and if you hear
[1:42:01] a sermon under the supernatural there is
[1:42:03] a supernatural power released with that
[1:42:05] sermon that's why the preaching of the
[1:42:07] gospel is how people are saved the
[1:42:10] preaching the gospel is how people get
[1:42:11] the holy ghost do you know that people
[1:42:13] amen i just say this amen i've been in
[1:42:16] meetings preaching meetings and people
[1:42:17] receive the holy ghost in the middle of
[1:42:19] the sermon
[1:42:20] amen brother sam you know what i'm
[1:42:22] talking about people are healed in the
[1:42:24] middle of the sermon amen some
[1:42:26] intellectual come up and say well
[1:42:27] brother wayne's not very smart i'm not
[1:42:28] trying to be smart
[1:42:30] i'm honestly not trying i think if i
[1:42:33] wanted to be smart i probably could get
[1:42:34] educated and try to go down that line
[1:42:37] but i'm not going to surrender the
[1:42:38] supernatural for the education i'm not
[1:42:41] going to surrender the supernatural for
[1:42:43] the intellect what i really want to see
[1:42:45] is that god would come down in the
[1:42:47] service and heal souls and give the
[1:42:50] baptism of the holy ghost and refresh an
[1:42:52] anointing in the church of the living
[1:42:54] god and i believe it i believe there's a
[1:42:56] word born bride
[1:42:58] i believe she's born by the word but not
[1:43:00] intellectually it's the revelation of
[1:43:02] the word that comes in the church now i
[1:43:05] can show you what brother branham said
[1:43:06] about it now some people really don't
[1:43:08] like these quotes very well but i kind
[1:43:09] of i kind of enjoy them
[1:43:12] he says it like this he said see he
[1:43:14] meant now the church is bringing forth
[1:43:15] members all the time so it's not that
[1:43:17] people don't have members he said they
[1:43:19] bring forth members all the time he said
[1:43:21] but she don't want none of them
[1:43:23] screaming hollering
[1:43:24] blabbering acts 238 miserable creature
[1:43:27] she thinks they are it would certainly
[1:43:29] embarrass her see it would ruin her
[1:43:31] educated ethical scientific society
[1:43:33] church that she belongs to they would
[1:43:35] throw her out at the next council she
[1:43:37] can't have it she don't want to be
[1:43:39] pregnant with the word because that's
[1:43:41] the only kind the word brings forth
[1:43:45] you'll know the difference in what
[1:43:46] you're hearing of what brings forth if
[1:43:48] it brings short hair bobbed hair makeup
[1:43:51] amen pant wearing women in your church
[1:43:53] social societies and entert that's not
[1:43:56] the word that did that the word of god
[1:43:58] will produce a bible bride the word of
[1:44:01] god will produce an acts 238 tongue
[1:44:04] talking baby it'll produce people that
[1:44:06] are filled with the spirit of god and
[1:44:08] they're ready to walk the word of god
[1:44:10] that's what it'll produce it won't
[1:44:12] produce a bunch of murmurs and
[1:44:13] complainers and oh come on now church we
[1:44:16] might as well preach since we're here
[1:44:18] amen i tell you what the devil's been
[1:44:19] punching on you won't you punch back a
[1:44:21] little bit the devil's been pushing on
[1:44:23] you won't you push back a little ain't
[1:44:25] it about time to push back on that devil
[1:44:28] and say satan get off of the grounds at
[1:44:31] the baptism of the holy ghost i believe
[1:44:34] in getting the holy ghost with power and
[1:44:36] with demonstration and with anointing
[1:44:40] in joel chapter 2 is it not prophecy
[1:44:43] that god would pour out his spirit in
[1:44:44] the last days
[1:44:47] and the unveiling of god brother bam
[1:44:48] says in joel 2 i'll pour out my spirit
[1:44:50] saith the lord
[1:44:51] now watch he says you have to watch
[1:44:53] those words now watch the difference
[1:44:55] brother branham was not against
[1:44:57] preaching and using greek words
[1:45:00] he was not against preachers studying
[1:45:02] and getting in the depth of the word and
[1:45:03] bringing out the greek meanings and
[1:45:05] pushing together the scripture he was
[1:45:07] not against it he's against doing it
[1:45:09] without a revelation of it to begin with
[1:45:12] but brother random goes into the
[1:45:13] scripture and says in the beginning
[1:45:16] elohim he said now you've got to watch
[1:45:18] the difference see you've got to watch
[1:45:20] the difference in the greek word elohim
[1:45:22] and the english word god
[1:45:24] because the english word god in the
[1:45:26] beginning god that could mean that piano
[1:45:29] any object you worship can become a god
[1:45:32] but in the beginning elohim and the word
[1:45:35] elohim means a self-existing one
[1:45:38] it just means god who is all-sufficient
[1:45:41] and self-existing in other words the
[1:45:43] greek meaning aligns with the revelation
[1:45:46] of what we know god to be he's not a
[1:45:48] piano he's not a church he's he's a god
[1:45:51] that is self-existent and in the
[1:45:53] beginning elohim so you can make a you
[1:45:56] can make an idol out of everything but
[1:45:58] nothing but god is self-existent
[1:46:01] nothing but him is self-existent and he
[1:46:04] pours himself out into the church he
[1:46:06] only changes his mask
[1:46:08] now watch the scripture
[1:46:10] timothy says without controversy great
[1:46:12] is the mystery of godliness
[1:46:14] god brother baby uses the word elohim
[1:46:17] see elohim amen do you see the word
[1:46:20] elohim veiled in human flesh elohim in
[1:46:22] the beginning elohim was made flesh see
[1:46:25] great is the mystery of elohim
[1:46:27] great is the mystery of a self-existing
[1:46:29] god amen but when we look here in exodus
[1:46:32] he the self-existing one
[1:46:35] introduces himself to moses
[1:46:38] i think it's powerful today to realize
[1:46:40] that the self-existent god would
[1:46:42] introduce himself to a human being and
[1:46:45] speak to him through a fire
[1:46:48] i think it's powerful when you when you
[1:46:50] read here amen that god introduces
[1:46:52] himself to abraham or to moses and he
[1:46:55] said i am the god of thy father the god
[1:46:58] of abraham the god of isaac the god of
[1:47:00] jacob and moses hit his face for he was
[1:47:02] afraid to look upon him now watch moses
[1:47:05] had met abraham's god and he introduces
[1:47:09] himself as elohim
[1:47:11] now now here's a powerful thing to me
[1:47:13] when you read genesis the first chapter
[1:47:16] amen the word elohim appears 36 times in
[1:47:21] 31 verses
[1:47:23] amen now what he's doing moses is
[1:47:25] letting you know who it is he's about to
[1:47:28] introduce to you
[1:47:29] this is elohim now the greeks the greek
[1:47:32] theologians will take the word elohim
[1:47:34] and they'll tell you the word elohim is
[1:47:35] plural
[1:47:37] so they'll say it's a plurality it's
[1:47:39] elohim it's plurality
[1:47:41] but to the believer you understand
[1:47:43] there's not more than one god
[1:47:45] so the polarity must mean something
[1:47:47] different than multiple gods amen but
[1:47:50] what is it he is plural in attribute not
[1:47:53] in person he's not many gods he has many
[1:47:57] attributes of the same god he is father
[1:48:00] he is son he is holy ghost and moses met
[1:48:03] him elohim and introduced himself do you
[1:48:06] recognize that when jesus introduced
[1:48:08] himself to john amen he introduced in
[1:48:11] the book of revelations he introduced
[1:48:13] himself as the almighty god he
[1:48:16] introduced himself and john begins the
[1:48:18] book by saying he was almighty god
[1:48:21] brother bram said that's the first base
[1:48:22] revelation that jesus christ is god it's
[1:48:26] the first and the last the first
[1:48:29] revelation you've got to get is jesus is
[1:48:31] god and the capstone revelation of the
[1:48:34] entire bible is jesus is god so god
[1:48:37] begins you and finishes you with the
[1:48:40] revelation he is god he is self-existent
[1:48:44] we're not worshiping the second person
[1:48:46] of some godhead we're not worshiping two
[1:48:49] or three gods up there there is only one
[1:48:51] god and his name is jesus christ and his
[1:48:54] name is above everything
[1:48:57] [Applause]
[1:48:58] now he's got to let you know who he is
[1:49:01] and moses amen is meeting one who's
[1:49:04] going to tell you who he is now we go
[1:49:06] back in the scripture and we read the
[1:49:07] book of genesis and we read there about
[1:49:10] how abraham
[1:49:11] met god
[1:49:13] and we we read it from genesis 17 and
[1:49:16] genesis 18
[1:49:17] powerful powerful encounters
[1:49:20] with the god of all creation elohim and
[1:49:23] abraham visits with him can you imagine
[1:49:26] amen the bible tells us that elohim is
[1:49:29] visiting with abraham under the name of
[1:49:32] el shaddai
[1:49:35] now do you see he's a he's one god but
[1:49:38] he's plural in attribute
[1:49:41] so what's he saying in the message
[1:49:43] approach to god he says if you want to
[1:49:45] come to god
[1:49:46] there is an approach to god
[1:49:49] and what he's doing is he's showing
[1:49:51] abraham how to approach elohim
[1:49:54] is to approach him through the name of
[1:49:56] the almighty god
[1:49:58] he's got to come through el shaddai
[1:50:01] to realize elohim
[1:50:03] now think of this here brother madame
[1:50:05] will tell us this
[1:50:07] i i don't know about you all but i think
[1:50:09] it's pretty powerful because what i'm
[1:50:11] reading in genesis 17 abraham didn't
[1:50:13] write it
[1:50:16] abraham didn't write genesis 17.
[1:50:19] and if something happened to you and
[1:50:21] another individual and i know about it
[1:50:23] and since i never talked to you about it
[1:50:25] you know i must have talked to the other
[1:50:28] person to know the story
[1:50:30] amen and abraham didn't tell moses the
[1:50:33] story
[1:50:35] abraham didn't tell moses what to write
[1:50:38] but the one that abraham was talking to
[1:50:41] told moses what was said and done to
[1:50:44] abraham
[1:50:46] and jesus looked at that story and said
[1:50:50] in the days of the end time it will be
[1:50:53] like this day here
[1:50:56] so moses was only telling us what god
[1:50:59] told him about abraham so we got the
[1:51:02] important part of the conversation
[1:51:06] got the important thing that god wanted
[1:51:08] the church to know about abraham in
[1:51:10] genesis 17 1 he said when the abraham
[1:51:13] was 90 years old and nine the lord
[1:51:14] appeared unto abram and said unto him i
[1:51:17] am the almighty god walk before me and
[1:51:20] be thou perfect i am the almighty god
[1:51:23] walk before me and be perfect see it's
[1:51:25] an approach to a name the almighty is
[1:51:28] most powerful and brother bram said the
[1:51:29] word el shaddai of course it means
[1:51:32] breasted one if you read greek
[1:51:34] theologians they do not none of them
[1:51:36] agree on what el shaddai means
[1:51:40] but we have a supreme revelation of el
[1:51:42] shaddai now that supreme revelation is
[1:51:45] he is a blessed god and he gives his
[1:51:48] word and look what happens is when god
[1:51:51] manifests his word he vindicates his
[1:51:53] word he manifests as his word it's like
[1:51:55] a mother who opens her breast to her
[1:51:58] starving child
[1:52:00] and the life that is in her can be
[1:52:02] approached through those breasts see the
[1:52:04] child has no existence on his own he
[1:52:07] only gets alive as he approaches his
[1:52:10] mother through the breath see there's no
[1:52:12] other approach to the life of his mother
[1:52:15] other than those breasts and there's no
[1:52:17] approach to god's life outside him
[1:52:20] manifesting his word and it's in the
[1:52:23] holy ghost power you see then the life
[1:52:26] is drawn through the word
[1:52:28] my if you want that holy ghost let it
[1:52:31] come through the word and it'll come and
[1:52:33] give you power and strength amen
[1:52:36] i'll tell you i i i studied one time a
[1:52:39] little bit deeper in this area and i
[1:52:41] found out that some of the first milk
[1:52:43] that come from my mother they call it
[1:52:44] liquid gold
[1:52:46] because they say things come into a
[1:52:48] child from its mother's breast in the
[1:52:50] first hours he's that builds immunities
[1:52:52] for things that are years down the road
[1:52:55] coming out
[1:52:56] things come in at the birth and through
[1:52:58] that meal that years it takes to get it
[1:53:00] out through the strength of it so
[1:53:02] they're carrying things in them that
[1:53:04] they nursed out of the breast they don't
[1:53:06] even know what's in them yet until later
[1:53:08] times when certain diseases attack them
[1:53:10] or something and with something put in
[1:53:12] them at its birth that's the reason we
[1:53:14] don't need no denominational bottles we
[1:53:17] need the rest of el shaddai we need the
[1:53:20] life of almighty god and bring strength
[1:53:23] into the church with authority and power
[1:53:26] brother ram said see who said abraham
[1:53:28] was like a baby he said it was 99 years
[1:53:30] old but it was a baby to god
[1:53:32] and god brought him to his breast he
[1:53:35] brought him to himself he said the name
[1:53:37] the name think of this the name
[1:53:39] el-shaddai was given to abraham as a
[1:53:42] pledge
[1:53:44] when i give you my name el-shaddai it's
[1:53:46] a pledge i will be your sufficiency
[1:53:50] i will be the strength of your life i
[1:53:53] will be what you need for everything
[1:53:56] that i have ordained for your life i am
[1:53:59] thy strength giver if god said you're
[1:54:01] going to be something he has the
[1:54:02] strength to make you that
[1:54:04] whatever god says he has the power to
[1:54:07] produce it
[1:54:09] i don't have time to preach this subject
[1:54:11] but let me just say it like this when
[1:54:13] when mary heard from the angel she was
[1:54:15] going to have a child it was going to be
[1:54:17] a virgin child you know what she said i
[1:54:19] don't know a man
[1:54:20] but he said to her amen with man it's
[1:54:23] impossible with god
[1:54:25] all things are possible is that right go
[1:54:27] to the greek on that it means that no
[1:54:30] word of god is spoken without power
[1:54:33] that any word god speaks has the power
[1:54:36] of fulfillment with it god doesn't send
[1:54:38] it amen and it's not a fulfilling word
[1:54:41] but if god prophesies to you the power
[1:54:44] to fulfill the word is in the word when
[1:54:47] it's spoken to you amen who has to put
[1:54:49] anything in a seed a seed has everything
[1:54:52] in it it needs to come
[1:54:55] at its season and when jehovah pledged
[1:54:57] this the name el shaddai was i'll be
[1:55:00] your strength i will be that see see
[1:55:02] then el shaddai was the place that
[1:55:05] abraham could draw strength
[1:55:08] i want you to see this i think it's
[1:55:10] powerful i'm the creator that hung
[1:55:12] between the heavens and the earth see
[1:55:14] see is there anything too great for god
[1:55:16] i may shadow you're my child though
[1:55:18] you're weak i'm letting you get to see
[1:55:20] what you'll do about it i'm going to
[1:55:22] make an example out of you hereafter
[1:55:25] that men will believe my word and i'll
[1:55:27] stand by no matter what it takes how
[1:55:29] long i'll do it i'll stand by it i'm el
[1:55:31] shaddai draw your strength see el
[1:55:34] shaddai he's the breasted god new and
[1:55:35] old testament draw your strength
[1:55:37] everything you have need of the baby is
[1:55:39] helpless to pull strength from the
[1:55:41] mother that's the only way it gets its
[1:55:43] strength the only way a believer gets
[1:55:45] his strength is you got to pull it from
[1:55:47] god
[1:55:48] you got to pull it from god do you see
[1:55:50] why you need to pull on the ministry
[1:55:53] do you see why you pull on the ministry
[1:55:55] you don't just listen you pull on the
[1:55:57] ministry because you pull out of the
[1:56:00] ministry words that give you strength
[1:56:03] for the season that you're living in
[1:56:05] amen we don't just come on i don't i i
[1:56:08] know y'all don't believe in this and i
[1:56:09] don't either but i think it's the word
[1:56:11] amen we don't believe in just the man
[1:56:13] behind the pulpit and people enduring
[1:56:14] the preaching
[1:56:16] but it's got to be a body activity it's
[1:56:18] got to be a body word the gift is only a
[1:56:21] gift of preaching amen but that gift has
[1:56:24] to have an operating power and the
[1:56:26] church pulls from the gift the preacher
[1:56:28] preaches and the church is edified and
[1:56:31] god is spoken and strength comes into
[1:56:34] the church
[1:56:35] strength
[1:56:36] strength of god the strength of god's
[1:56:39] promises now now i want you to realize
[1:56:42] that abraham didn't get the miracle the
[1:56:44] same day he went to draw from the breast
[1:56:46] but brother brahm said like a wading
[1:56:48] child he said crying snotting he said
[1:56:51] but when the mother picks up the child
[1:56:53] he said two things happen it brings
[1:56:56] strength from the breast and the breast
[1:56:58] give it satisfying portion so the baby
[1:57:00] will quit crying because it's satisfied
[1:57:03] at the same time it's getting its
[1:57:04] strength and when the church gets a hold
[1:57:06] of a word they get a hold of a promise
[1:57:09] of god amen that promise don't only give
[1:57:11] you strength it gives you satisfaction
[1:57:14] that god is answering your prayer so
[1:57:16] when you need strength it comes from el
[1:57:18] shaddai now abraham the bible told us he
[1:57:21] had the resource from god in romans
[1:57:23] chapter 4 when paul wrote about it he
[1:57:25] said he staggered not through unbelief
[1:57:27] but was strong in faith
[1:57:30] now his strength was coming from the
[1:57:32] word i think it's important to know
[1:57:34] where your strength comes from
[1:57:36] because you can renew strength if you
[1:57:38] know where strength comes from
[1:57:40] if you don't know the source then you
[1:57:42] don't know how to get it but if you know
[1:57:44] where the source of strength is then you
[1:57:46] will never be weak you'll always have
[1:57:48] strength amen now watch this david said
[1:57:51] in psalms 27 i think it's the rapture
[1:57:53] scripture powerful he said the lord is
[1:57:55] my light and my salvation of whom shall
[1:57:56] i fear for the lord is the strength of
[1:58:01] my life
[1:58:02] the lord is the strength of my life do
[1:58:05] you know david says it in psalms 84 he
[1:58:07] said blessed is his man whose strength
[1:58:10] is in thee
[1:58:11] now the man that's really got a blessing
[1:58:14] is when his life strength is in the lord
[1:58:17] because if your strength is in the lord
[1:58:19] it will never fail thee
[1:58:21] amen it doesn't matter where you're
[1:58:23] walking you can walk according to david
[1:58:25] in the valley of baca amen in other
[1:58:27] words it's a dry place but god will make
[1:58:30] a well out of it he'll fill the pools
[1:58:32] with water because your strength is
[1:58:34] coming from the lord and david says it
[1:58:36] like this i think it's powerful psalms
[1:58:37] 84 and 7 he said they will go from
[1:58:40] strength unto strength amen to them that
[1:58:43] pull on god will go from strength to
[1:58:46] strength if you latch on to the
[1:58:48] ill-shotty out breast you go from
[1:58:50] strength to strength now somebody said
[1:58:52] well preacher what does that really mean
[1:58:54] it means in the amplified bible that
[1:58:56] says it this way increasing in
[1:58:59] victorious power
[1:59:00] you go from one strength to another
[1:59:02] strength you're not going from strength
[1:59:05] to weakness you're not moving downward
[1:59:08] you're moving upward you're going from
[1:59:10] strength to strength
[1:59:12] now
[1:59:13] you may feel weakest if you've ever
[1:59:15] filled in your life right now you you
[1:59:16] may say well wait i i don't really feel
[1:59:18] any stronger now than i ever have can i
[1:59:20] can take two minutes of your time and
[1:59:22] say something to you
[1:59:23] you're in the darkest age it's ever been
[1:59:27] right and and i i think that it's fair
[1:59:29] for me to say this
[1:59:30] the last two years
[1:59:32] in this america and this world is the
[1:59:35] hardest two years any peaceful has ever
[1:59:37] lived in the history of known time that
[1:59:39] we know about
[1:59:41] i don't think any society has been hit
[1:59:43] harder through politics through science
[1:59:46] through religion through education
[1:59:48] through the internet through television
[1:59:51] through radio you're being attacked from
[1:59:53] every quarter
[1:59:54] come on now it's the truth it's the
[1:59:56] devil and he's attacking the church from
[1:59:59] every quarter hey man if you you turn
[2:00:01] towards one way it's attack turn another
[2:00:03] way it's an attack everything around you
[2:00:06] amen look at what's happened amen for
[2:00:08] two solid years it has been a absolute
[2:00:12] battle
[2:00:13] come on now
[2:00:14] amen do you let me just say this you may
[2:00:17] not feel any stronger but if you're
[2:00:19] sitting here this morning you are
[2:00:22] stronger than you were two years ago or
[2:00:24] you wouldn't be here this morning
[2:00:27] if god hadn't given you strength
[2:00:29] sufficient for the hour you wouldn't be
[2:00:31] in the house of god this morning but we
[2:00:34] are here this morning
[2:00:36] and we're not just here we're here in
[2:00:38] strength we're here in authority
[2:00:42] we're here shouting the victory of god
[2:00:45] amen i tell you what sometimes you are
[2:00:47] to just tell the devil i'm still here
[2:00:49] satan
[2:00:50] and you ain't got enough to take me you
[2:00:52] ain't got enough to destroy me i'm the
[2:00:55] church of the living god you're not
[2:00:57] going to keep us from marching you're
[2:00:59] not going to keep us from coming because
[2:01:01] of the power of god has come in this age
[2:01:04] we're moving brother from strength to
[2:01:05] strength amen i know every further up
[2:01:08] the road that we were before it is
[2:01:10] impossible for you to survive now in the
[2:01:13] same level of strength you had two years
[2:01:15] ago god has given you strength and it's
[2:01:17] time to recognize he's the strength of
[2:01:20] my life he's the power
[2:01:22] of god in my life my strength comes from
[2:01:25] the lord
[2:01:30] they that wait upon the lord
[2:01:32] shall renew strength
[2:01:34] come on church amen paul said because we
[2:01:37] have this ministry
[2:01:39] we faint not what kind of ministry paul
[2:01:42] said it was a ministry a manifestation
[2:01:44] he said i have manifestly declared these
[2:01:47] things unto you and god has manifested
[2:01:50] this message unto you with power and
[2:01:53] authority and if you will turn your eyes
[2:01:56] to the vindicated word of god you don't
[2:01:58] have to wait any longer you don't have
[2:02:01] to wait for strength this morning there
[2:02:03] is strength in the look you can look one
[2:02:05] time come on church and victory will
[2:02:08] return to your life you can look at it
[2:02:10] one time and see really what it is i
[2:02:13] think it's time to look yes
[2:02:16] yeah amen this church ain't getting
[2:02:17] weaker but samuel we're not getting
[2:02:19] weaker hey matter of fact we're getting
[2:02:21] stronger we're moving from strength to
[2:02:23] strength let me give you let me give you
[2:02:25] a bible on it in the joshua generation
[2:02:28] 45 years after the death of moses
[2:02:31] caleb amen came to joshua and said give
[2:02:34] me the mountain moses said i could have
[2:02:37] he knew his rights in the generation he
[2:02:40] lived in came from the things moses said
[2:02:44] oh god somebody said caleb show me your
[2:02:47] title he said moses said i could have it
[2:02:50] that's the title for the bride of christ
[2:02:53] if a prophet said we can have it then we
[2:02:55] can have it if you're strong enough to
[2:02:58] duck the giants off of it it belongs to
[2:03:01] you if you're strong enough to take the
[2:03:04] sword of the lord and knock the giants
[2:03:06] off of it say well brother wayne i'm
[2:03:07] getting tired no we're not getting tired
[2:03:10] we're just getting started
[2:03:12] amen i know people say well by the way
[2:03:14] uh uh things are tight and all actually
[2:03:15] we're just getting started amen i think
[2:03:17] of brother bosworth who was about ready
[2:03:19] for retirement but when he seen the gift
[2:03:22] of operation in brother braham's life he
[2:03:24] come out of retirement and said i have
[2:03:27] just begun to fight because he's seen
[2:03:29] the bible living in manifestation well
[2:03:32] let me tell you this i don't believe
[2:03:34] this bride's about done i don't believe
[2:03:36] she's ready for retirement i think it's
[2:03:38] time for the church to pick up the sword
[2:03:40] amen and as a caleb of the hour say i'm
[2:03:43] as strong now as i ever was and i want
[2:03:46] to take this mountain away from these
[2:03:48] amalekites and anax
[2:03:51] what are you talking about by the way
[2:03:52] i'm talking about take the sword in your
[2:03:54] hand it's time for strength to manifest
[2:03:56] itself in your life elohim el shaddai
[2:03:59] has come upon the church of the living
[2:04:01] god and has put you in condition to see
[2:04:04] god
[2:04:05] now you wasn't in condition for bride's
[2:04:07] revival you wasn't in condition for
[2:04:09] rapture you wasn't in condition to hey
[2:04:11] man you wasn't there you didn't have the
[2:04:13] strength there was no condition for it
[2:04:15] but you know the bible actually says
[2:04:17] amen in the book of revelations 10 and 1
[2:04:20] that a mighty angel would come out of
[2:04:21] heaven
[2:04:23] a mighty angel a strong one would come
[2:04:26] down to the church of the living god
[2:04:28] where are we getting our strength out of
[2:04:30] this message we're getting our strength
[2:04:32] and the weakest of all the ages but our
[2:04:35] strength is coming from the lord he has
[2:04:37] opened up the fountains of youth and we
[2:04:40] are renewing ourselves in the power and
[2:04:43] the manifestations of god it is a shady
[2:04:46] eye that has came down amen oh i'll tell
[2:04:49] you strength has now come
[2:04:52] strength has now come for the church
[2:04:55] amen there's a strength here that is a
[2:04:57] supernatural strength
[2:05:00] it's a supernatural time
[2:05:03] because actually
[2:05:04] amen that is god's charistic
[2:05:07] if you want to know you're worshiping
[2:05:09] god
[2:05:10] it will always be supernatural
[2:05:12] you cannot worship god without it being
[2:05:14] supernatural
[2:05:16] because god is
[2:05:17] the supernatural
[2:05:19] and i think this is the season for it
[2:05:20] don't you
[2:05:21] i think this is the hour to worship
[2:05:24] like we never have worshiped church
[2:05:26] i think it's the hour to believe like
[2:05:28] we've never believed
[2:05:32] don't grow weary
[2:05:33] don't grow wearing well doing
[2:05:35] your strength comes from god
[2:05:38] amen can our musicians come this morning
[2:05:41] your strength
[2:05:42] your strength that comes from god
[2:05:45] what a season to live i believe it i
[2:05:48] believe with all my heart
[2:05:51] that you can pull your strength
[2:05:55] brother brahm said after that time
[2:05:57] abraham was now in condition
[2:06:00] to see the son
[2:06:03] that's what put him
[2:06:05] in condition
[2:06:07] to see it
[2:06:10] wouldn't it be something today
[2:06:12] if you pull on it and get get in the
[2:06:13] condition to see god
[2:06:16] to see him revealed right here in this
[2:06:18] meeting this morning in your life
[2:06:22] i believe you got a right this morning
[2:06:25] now
[2:06:26] y'all know me well enough to know i'm
[2:06:27] not done with my notes but i feel like
[2:06:29] we've reached that point
[2:06:32] but elohim
[2:06:35] has been manifest
[2:06:38] among the church of the living god
[2:06:40] as the all
[2:06:42] mighty god
[2:06:46] do you know what he did right after that
[2:06:47] holy ghost fell upon abraham
[2:06:50] changed his name
[2:06:54] and gave him seven letters that ended in
[2:06:55] h.a.m
[2:06:59] after the name of the church was changed
[2:07:02] they set an order for a condition
[2:07:06] to receive the son
[2:07:09] and god called his name abraham
[2:07:13] which meant a father of nations
[2:07:15] he had drawed something he drawed
[2:07:17] something from the breast of el shadia
[2:07:20] he drawled an h
[2:07:23] right out of those breasts
[2:07:25] he drawed an h into his name
[2:07:29] can you imagine
[2:07:32] bringing bringing a name change
[2:07:34] from fatherless
[2:07:36] to the father of nations
[2:07:38] that's what he took from the breast of
[2:07:40] el shadia
[2:07:41] he was a fatherless man
[2:07:44] and drawed strength to be the father of
[2:07:46] nations
[2:07:48] a man without a son and god calls him a
[2:07:50] father
[2:07:52] because he had now given me strength to
[2:07:55] fulfill the commission
[2:07:57] that he had been given think of this
[2:07:58] today you as a church of the living god
[2:08:03] one it was called barren
[2:08:05] but now fruitful
[2:08:09] what about florence nightingale when she
[2:08:10] flew in over there
[2:08:12] came in the room with a prophet
[2:08:16] skin and bones
[2:08:18] she had no strength or power
[2:08:23] but when a prophet began to pray
[2:08:26] strength began to come back in that life
[2:08:29] [Music]
[2:08:31] i think one of my favorite stories i
[2:08:33] ever heard brother graham taylor tell
[2:08:34] was the story of georgie carter
[2:08:36] i think it's one of the most powerful
[2:08:38] stories i've ever heard
[2:08:39] a girl late 99 years later on the bed
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:46] nine years
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:52] do you know
[2:08:53] she couldn't walk
[2:08:55] she couldn't get up
[2:08:57] there's a lot to that story and i i
[2:08:59] guess i should tell this point of it i
[2:09:00] didn't know this for years by the samuel
[2:09:02] but my brother em tells it he said that
[2:09:04] georgie carter had tuberculosis
[2:09:06] he said but it was put in her because
[2:09:08] her uncle raped her
[2:09:11] and he said it was the abuse of the
[2:09:12] uncle
[2:09:14] that caused
[2:09:15] the herd in her body and tb set up on
[2:09:17] that
[2:09:18] she was taking in piano lessons or
[2:09:20] something
[2:09:21] so some people are crippled today
[2:09:25] no fault of their own
[2:09:27] some situation they were in some
[2:09:29] sickness settled down on that
[2:09:31] they begin to lay down
[2:09:33] they become paralyzed
[2:09:35] and they get stuck in the place they're
[2:09:37] in
[2:09:39] but georgia carter picked up a a little
[2:09:41] book and read
[2:09:44] about a nail girl that had been healed
[2:09:46] and she believed that jesus christ was
[2:09:48] the same yesterday she even told her
[2:09:50] mama that she wanted to be prayed for
[2:09:52] and be healed and your mama told her
[2:09:53] said honey god don't do them kind of
[2:09:54] things anymore
[2:09:56] when brother branham come around and
[2:09:58] started preaching divine healing by
[2:10:00] vision the mother called him
[2:10:02] a false man and said he's building false
[2:10:05] hope in the child that she could be
[2:10:07] healed
[2:10:09] can you imagine
[2:10:11] she was saying it was false hope
[2:10:14] it was false hope that strength would
[2:10:15] return to her daughter that she'd get up
[2:10:17] out of that bed
[2:10:18] it was false hope to believe that god
[2:10:20] would do things like he did in the bible
[2:10:24] but god was there to prove it wasn't
[2:10:26] false hope he was there to restore the
[2:10:29] hope of the entire church
[2:10:31] and used one little girl
[2:10:33] so we could stand here this morning and
[2:10:35] tell you
[2:10:36] in these crippling conditions the same
[2:10:38] god
[2:10:39] that raised up georgie carter can raise
[2:10:40] you up
[2:10:42] and remember when brother brown seen
[2:10:43] that pillar of fire and brought strength
[2:10:45] that brought strength come to him and he
[2:10:47] had thus saith the lord he walked in the
[2:10:48] room of george he laid there nine years
[2:10:50] brother bram said he said to her thus
[2:10:52] saith the lord george stand up on your
[2:10:54] feet
[2:10:55] and that's what brother branham i always
[2:10:56] thought it's amazing the way he said it
[2:10:58] he said i heard myself say stand up on
[2:11:00] your feet and then he said then i
[2:11:02] thought in my mind
[2:11:04] hey man she ain't been on her feet in
[2:11:05] nine years there's no muscle in her legs
[2:11:08] how will the little girl stand
[2:11:10] without any muscles how would she do
[2:11:12] what i just told her to do in his mind
[2:11:15] he's thinking that he said but then i
[2:11:17] realized if god told her to do it he'd
[2:11:20] give the strength for it to happen
[2:11:22] and the power she stood by was not her
[2:11:26] own power it was the power of the word
[2:11:28] of god and the same word that brought
[2:11:31] georgie carter off of that bed is the
[2:11:34] same word we're preaching in the house
[2:11:36] of god this morning and i believe it's
[2:11:38] time for the church to rise up and walk
[2:11:41] in authority and walk in power i don't i
[2:11:44] don't care what it is that's happened i
[2:11:46] don't care what the situations are it's
[2:11:48] time to rise up like never before
[2:11:51] keep pressing the battle if you could
[2:11:53] open the heavens right now and a voice
[2:11:56] was coming out of the beings of the
[2:11:58] angels that you would hear them say to
[2:11:59] you press the bible church press the
[2:12:02] bible amen the the finish line is right
[2:12:05] in front of you it's not a time to stop
[2:12:08] not a time to lay down the sword it's
[2:12:10] not a time to retire it's not a time to
[2:12:13] give up and to walk away it's an hour
[2:12:16] like never before for the church to
[2:12:18] gather together the strength that god
[2:12:20] gave them pick up the sword of the word
[2:12:23] of god and take back what the devil has
[2:12:25] taken from you saying satan the joyous
[2:12:29] mind the peace is mine the holy ghost is
[2:12:31] mine life and you have no right taking
[2:12:35] it from me
[2:12:37] oh i tell you i know i know what it is i
[2:12:39] know satan says to you satan says to you
[2:12:42] if you just back up a little bit i'll
[2:12:44] let you have some peace
[2:12:45] you won't have to fight seek to come to
[2:12:47] church and to be a part of a body it's a
[2:12:49] fight and satan says well if you just
[2:12:51] quit coming around you'll get you a
[2:12:53] little peace that's a lying devil
[2:12:56] and amen all you've got to do is ask
[2:12:58] israel about this when the palestinians
[2:13:00] told them we'll give you peace if you
[2:13:02] give us land it's a lie they will never
[2:13:05] be happy as long as israel's alive come
[2:13:08] on church and land for peace is a lie
[2:13:11] satan is lying to you don't you give one
[2:13:13] inch of the ground that god gave you
[2:13:16] don't you give one thing back to the
[2:13:17] devil that god has given to you i
[2:13:20] believe it's time for the church to
[2:13:22] possess the borders of every promise of

[2:27:31] being revealed and unfolded and made
[2:27:33] known to you and i that he's the same
[2:27:35] god
[2:27:36] brother bran made this statement he said
[2:27:38] it all depends on the attitude
[2:27:41] that you take toward it as whether it'll
[2:27:44] do you any good or not
[2:27:46] and we want to have the right attitude
[2:27:49] to the things of god sometimes it isn't
[2:27:50] you know we we know what it's like to
[2:27:52] have a
[2:27:53] bad attitude we've all been there
[2:27:55] sometimes where our attitude's just not
[2:27:57] right but you see the right remember
[2:27:58] brother bram tells us the right mental
[2:28:00] attitude toward any promise of god will
[2:28:03] bring it to pass
[2:28:04] it's not just like christian sciences
[2:28:06] was just positive thinking no it's it's
[2:28:09] it's taking the word because it's the
[2:28:11] word that has life in it and when you
[2:28:14] take the word into your life the word
[2:28:17] has within it just as the lord spoke
[2:28:19] here this morning it has the power
[2:28:21] within it to fulfill and bring to past
[2:28:23] what god has said
[2:28:25] and so it's not just good thinking but
[2:28:27] it's taking the word of god into our
[2:28:30] being and if we can just take that
[2:28:32] regardless of whatever the the thoughts
[2:28:34] are it'd just be like this if you went
[2:28:36] to the doctor's office and the doctor
[2:28:37] said maybe you've got whatever it could
[2:28:39] be back leg whatever it could be and the
[2:28:41] doctor could say you're going to be in a
[2:28:43] wheelchair you know it depends on
[2:28:45] whether or not you entertain that
[2:28:47] thought as to whether you'll be in a
[2:28:48] wheelchair
[2:28:49] a person can come to you and sometimes
[2:28:51] there's some things that can be
[2:28:53] earth-shattering to our outer two realms
[2:28:56] the flesh and the spirit they can say
[2:28:58] you've got cancer and that word cancer
[2:29:01] itself just saying it it brings it can
[2:29:03] bring a fear
[2:29:05] is that right
[2:29:06] but when there is that anchor that's in
[2:29:08] the soul that you can look back to a
[2:29:10] promise and say this is what the doctor
[2:29:12] has said it's there in my body but i'm
[2:29:15] looking to a report that is greater and
[2:29:19] is above every other report
[2:29:22] and when we can just look at that and
[2:29:24] come back because see all these things
[2:29:25] that come about at times is to take our
[2:29:28] focus away from what really belongs to
[2:29:31] us
[2:29:32] and we can get a person can take
[2:29:34] something like that and not saying that
[2:29:36] that's not something real but they can
[2:29:38] become wrapped up in that
[2:29:40] and they forget about
[2:29:42] it's god
[2:29:43] that has watched over your life all
[2:29:45] along
[2:29:46] and it's the same god that's watched
[2:29:48] over your life is the same god who's
[2:29:50] present to bring you through that
[2:29:52] situation
[2:29:54] don't ever stop don't stop drawing
[2:29:56] strength from the lord he is our
[2:29:57] strength
[2:29:59] amen well even as we're prayed for
[2:30:01] remember it's the strength of almighty
[2:30:03] god because it's the quickening power in
[2:30:06] the body of believers it's quickening
[2:30:08] power that moves through that pair to
[2:30:10] strengthen you and i and then what do we
[2:30:12] do what's the strength you've received
[2:30:14] keep feeding on the word of god you
[2:30:17] might say brother samuel i i don't seem
[2:30:18] like i'm getting nothing it don't seem
[2:30:20] like i'm it's not about what you feel
[2:30:22] you're getting or whether you feel
[2:30:24] anything or not as a matter of fact
[2:30:26] there were so many that sat right in
[2:30:28] brother branham's meetings even in
[2:30:29] dwight moody's meetings and they were
[2:30:31] healed while the word was being preached
[2:30:34] and some could sit there and think i
[2:30:36] don't got enough faith to be healed
[2:30:37] think of this sitting there in their
[2:30:39] first conscience and they didn't think
[2:30:41] they had enough faith to be healed but
[2:30:43] the subconscious man is where it really
[2:30:45] lays and it was in contact with the
[2:30:48] supernatural god it went beyond their
[2:30:51] first conscience and brought down
[2:30:53] healing into their life i'm glad that
[2:30:56] there's a greater you than you
[2:30:58] there's a greater me than me on the
[2:31:00] inside
[2:31:02] that's that part of god that's really
[2:31:04] him
[2:31:06] that's really him it draws from the word
[2:31:08] so if we can just look at that and just
[2:31:10] take the right attitude towards the word
[2:31:12] of god and just draw strength from the
[2:31:14] word of god keep looking keep focusing i
[2:31:17] believe that's what the spirit of god
[2:31:18] has
[2:31:19] really really spoke to our hearts in
[2:31:21] this hour and you see when when when the
[2:31:24] spirit of god comes around like this
[2:31:27] how that god will come around and he'll
[2:31:28] speak right directly to our hearts the
[2:31:30] greatest thing we can do you know
[2:31:31] sometimes maybe if you're you're guilty
[2:31:33] or you're in this situation you can take
[2:31:34] one or two things you can either get
[2:31:36] offended at the word because the word's
[2:31:38] touching right where you're at
[2:31:39] or you can say yes lord
[2:31:42] yes lord i don't want to be offended in
[2:31:44] the word
[2:31:45] because the word has come to help me
[2:31:48] and i need the discernment
[2:31:50] of the living god the living word
[2:31:53] to discern things out
[2:31:55] in my life
[2:31:56] amen aren't you glad
[2:31:59] amen
[2:32:00] oh my let's just give the lord a
[2:32:02] handclap of praise
