[34:59] bless you have you here
[35:04] math
[35:07] then we'll let you have your seats and
[35:09] just have a testimony
[35:12] I'd like to be given here
[35:18] he's got Paul's Mike
[35:24] yeah
[35:25] he has Paul's mic
[35:28] okay
[35:29] so in the Jewish way
[35:36] God bless you
[35:39] I just want to
[35:41] thank the church and uh
[35:45] for all the players because it's been
[35:49] more than almost two years since I start
[35:54] going back and forth to Congo to get
[35:57] married and
[35:59] initially start with uh like a fiance
[36:03] process through the immigration for my
[36:06] wife to come here and get married but it
[36:09] took so long that we decided that we
[36:12] have to get married and we can get the
[36:16] marriage license here
[36:19] so back in March in February actually we
[36:24] got married
[36:25] but there was no answer
[36:28] you guys the church been praying through
[36:31] all that and uh
[36:33] I'm very thankful for that
[36:35] so
[36:37] late March we got the initial approval
[36:41] from the immigration
[36:43] usually it's
[36:45] taking uh very fast after the
[36:48] immigration approves but for some reason
[36:53] from The Fallout of the kovid the
[36:55] pandemic and pandemy and everything so
[36:59] things scatter very stretched out
[37:03] so by God grace the case cutter to the
[37:07] Embassy in Congo in June
[37:09] and also it's supposed to be fast after
[37:13] it gets to the embassy it's like a few
[37:16] weeks
[37:17] but for some reason the embassy had its
[37:21] own problems also
[37:23] um
[37:24] turns out that
[37:26] people I sent there to check on how fast
[37:29] we can get the case
[37:31] approved to the Embassy they told them
[37:34] that it's going to be up to 2025.
[37:38] so it was like a very traumatic
[37:41] but through it all
[37:44] we trusted in God
[37:47] and us
[37:48] so that's why sometimes
[37:52] we let by let things pass we don't
[37:56] testify but this I know that it's uh the
[38:00] hand of God that intervened that this
[38:02] time this week it's been since Monday
[38:06] I was back and forth the embassy to see
[38:09] what can be done
[38:12] and there was not like Assurance any
[38:15] anyhow so
[38:18] but by Friday
[38:20] we got the email that they cut the
[38:23] interview for her for November 22nd so
[38:28] that's I was very thankful and I want to
[38:32] say that God is able everything that
[38:36] can be
[38:38] beyond our mind our in my imagination
[38:41] just give it to a god hands easable so I
[38:47] thank God and thank you guys for all the
[38:49] prayers God bless you
[38:57] thank you

[39:43] our thoughts and our attention to the
[39:45] word of the Lord
[39:47] we just approach him this morning and my
[39:51] what a what a song what a testimony
[39:54] through it all
[39:57] through it all yes
[39:58] you know if God takes to test and Opera
[40:02] tests and trials
[40:04] and our flesh doesn't like him
[40:07] no matter how old we get we don't like
[40:11] but God knows what's best for us
[40:16] and not only is God molding us and
[40:18] shaping Us in the midst of that
[40:21] and it's not that God's discovering
[40:22] something new about us God already knows
[40:25] what laziness
[40:28] but God wants you to see
[40:30] what lays in you
[40:32] like how brother Bram said it like this
[40:34] when he talks about job he says you know
[40:36] when the tests and Trials come he said
[40:38] what God was doing he was bringing out
[40:41] the qualities
[40:43] that are in a believer
[40:45] and that's tremendous so there's nothing
[40:48] that brings out the qualities
[40:51] of a believer
[40:52] as a test and proud
[40:55] because you know what it does it puts
[40:57] this person
[41:00] down to the down to the place there
[41:02] where we realize I can't do nothing I
[41:05] can't do nothing
[41:07] this is a frail vessel
[41:11] depend on him
[41:13] that's what God told Paul Paul my grace
[41:16] is sufficient
[41:18] and aren't you glad for that amen I'm so
[41:21] grateful for that
[41:22] amen it's him that's holding me
[41:26] not me holding him
[41:28] I don't have that kind of strength to
[41:30] hold on
[41:31] but it's him
[41:34] it's him it's him and that's why we
[41:38] could stand and we could sing again to
[41:40] God be the glory but
[41:42] we need to move on into the service but
[41:45] I say to God
[41:47] to God be the glory
[41:51] God bless you for the just read we're
[41:52] happy
[41:54] when he called me last night I thought
[41:56] oh Lord I thought Lord I hope I'm going
[41:59] to be able to go to bed tonight
[42:00] and sometimes you know it's things that
[42:02] you know my mind's pondering with the
[42:04] service coming on and
[42:06] I was just really weary and when he
[42:08] called me I said oh my God you know when
[42:11] you see God you hear God moving to me it
[42:13] isn't excitement those are things
[42:16] excitement is when you see God moving
[42:17] you hear a testimony those are the kind
[42:19] of things that just cause me to want to
[42:21] run on just a few hours of sleep
[42:23] and uh but I just it's the God is so
[42:27] good so I want you to continue to pray I
[42:31] told Brother Joshua I said this is what
[42:33] we're doing I said we're going to pray
[42:37] as a church not only
[42:40] through the interview but until she
[42:42] stands on this soil
[42:44] [Music]
[42:49] until like it was
[42:51] when Peter knocked on the door
[42:56] so let's keep praying don't pull back on
[42:58] your prayers you know that's one thing
[42:59] sometimes when you you hear God move for
[43:01] a situation A need that we're praying
[43:03] for a sickness when you start hearing
[43:05] things getting better that's not the
[43:06] time to pull back that's the time to
[43:08] even be pray even more
[43:11] because when challenges come brother
[43:13] Brown talks about how one of the best
[43:15] signs of healing just that phrase best
[43:17] sign is when you start getting sicker
[43:20] things start getting worse my brother
[43:22] bam takes that whole thing in deep cult
[43:24] the Deep takes a whole part of it and
[43:27] goes through that there that's the very
[43:30] time that when someone's going through
[43:32] that we want to stay steadfast in prayer
[43:34] until they're not
[43:36] on the door amen don't you love the Lord
[43:39] amen isn't it good to serving
[43:42] amen Hallelujah well God bless you

[47:24] request that Lord is laying upon the
[47:27] hearts of your children that God we even
[47:30] as we hear the testimony Lord that God
[47:34] will brother Joshua the Lord the first
[47:37] announcements that was made to them is

[48:41] you would have your way in this service
[48:43] may it all be done for the glory of God
[48:45] in Jesus name amen God bless you
[48:49] and you're being seated
[48:51] I want to speak here just a few moments
[48:54] on a on the thought
[48:57] Grace
[48:59] to the humble
[49:00] and um
[49:02] it's quite subject we've been looking at
[49:05] with Grace
[49:07] and uh to see here I'd like to just I'd
[49:10] like to open I'd like to read this quote
[49:13] that brother Branham
[49:14] makes her at the end of the message
[49:16] token and this is where a lot of it just
[49:18] started to move
[49:20] brother Bram says Lord Jesus most
[49:22] gracious one when the world was in sin
[49:26] and no one could help God in Mercy for
[49:30] showing by a type that there was coming
[49:33] a token that could take away sin not
[49:36] just cover it but could take it away
[49:39] amen and Jesus came in the right time
[49:43] he always comes in the right time
[49:45] and he shed the blood his own life
[49:48] making us an atonement for our sins and
[49:53] then presenting him back in the form of
[49:56] the Holy Ghost which is now a token
[49:59] that's to be kept to the church until he
[50:02] comes so a token would be like that if
[50:05] you have a bus fare or you have an
[50:06] airline ticket and probably every one of
[50:08] us and you you we have awareness of that
[50:10] I remember when I was going to school
[50:12] there was such a thing that you know you
[50:14] you couldn't just walk up to the lunch
[50:15] lady it got to a place for us you
[50:17] couldn't just walk up and pay him for
[50:19] something if you wanted a lunch you had
[50:21] to buy what they called little tokens or
[50:23] maybe you had a lunch card that was
[50:24] punched or there was something and and
[50:26] that way they handled the money the
[50:28] purchase was made they knew how many
[50:30] lunches to provide and then you went
[50:32] with your little card or whatever it was
[50:34] your token same thing with an airline
[50:36] you just don't go to an airport matter
[50:39] of fact you're not going to get into an
[50:40] airport without an even into security
[50:42] without having your ID and having that
[50:45] they can see see that you actually have
[50:47] a ticket so that ticket itself is a
[50:50] token it's so it shows that you've
[50:52] already paid the price for the fare so
[50:54] that's what that's what the profit is
[50:56] referring back to the Token than even
[50:58] that God said that when I see the blood
[51:00] in Exodus 12 when I see the blood
[51:03] meaning a life has already been given a
[51:06] life has already been surrendered
[51:07] there's already been a sacrifice and
[51:09] when I see the blood then I will pass
[51:12] over you so God was looking at for the
[51:16] sacrifice for the blood so now let me
[51:19] just move on with that he says it's a
[51:21] token that's to be kept to the church
[51:23] until he comes for the Apostle Peter
[51:25] said the promise is unto you and to your
[51:28] children and to them that are far off
[51:31] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[51:33] call Lord by your grace your help I
[51:37] claim everyone that hears this message I
[51:40] claim them for God I pray thee Lord both
[51:44] here this morning and those that will
[51:45] here on tape if there be a seed anywhere
[51:48] that's predestinated Lord to hear the
[51:52] word of this last day may they come now
[51:54] sweetly and humbly and lay their
[51:57] trophies down at the cross or their self
[52:01] as a trophy of the grace of God that's
[52:04] called them and may they be filled with
[52:08] the Holy Spirit and display the token of
[52:11] the life of Jesus Christ in his
[52:13] resurrection as long as they remain here
[52:16] on Earth
[52:18] what a privilege it is
[52:21] to be called to be bitten by the Holy
[52:24] Spirit to come and what a privilege it
[52:27] is to have a heart that would say yes
[52:30] Lord
[52:31] amen laying down our trophies not our
[52:33] accolades not what we could do or what
[52:35] anything that we have to present because
[52:38] as the scripture says our righteousness
[52:41] alone is as filthy rags in his sight
[52:44] and so to think what a privilege it is I
[52:47] you know we could be identified with a
[52:50] lot of people and sometimes men will
[52:52] strive to get into certain companies or
[52:55] groups and allotments of people they'll
[52:58] do a lot of things but to think that
[53:00] here is one that it's not you or I
[53:03] seeking to get into identity with him he
[53:06] came down and was identified with us
[53:08] he's the one that's extended an
[53:10] invitation to you and I come take my
[53:13] yoke upon you and learn of me come unto
[53:17] me all you that are heavy labor Laden
[53:20] and I will give you rest and then to be
[53:22] able to just surrender to an invitation
[53:25] so it's not us trying to work our way
[53:28] into a place with somebody and you know
[53:31] make it in their friend list her you
[53:34] know we're a part of their group or but
[53:36] the thing that God himself come down and
[53:38] invited you and I and has drawn upon us
[53:41] and all we have to do is accept the
[53:44] invitation just like when an invitation
[53:46] is given in your mailbox for a wedding
[53:49] all you've got to do is check with an
[53:51] RSVP I'll be there and that's the same
[53:54] thing the Holy Spirit comes down to says
[53:57] will you surrender your life will you
[53:59] give your all and uh you know I'll take
[54:02] your life and I'll make out of it what
[54:04] you could never dream possible I'll take
[54:06] care of all of your Sorrows I'll take
[54:09] care of all of your sin problem I'll
[54:11] take care of whatever the healing
[54:13] complex whatever it is in your life just
[54:15] come to me and and I'll take care of it
[54:18] all and to think what a privilege to be
[54:20] associated with the Lord God Almighty
[54:24] that where even Abraham could say and be
[54:27] regarded as a friend of God
[54:30] ask somebody to be friends with
[54:33] so the way up
[54:35] the way up is actually down because how
[54:38] that the world is always contrary to
[54:40] that and so the way up is always down so
[54:43] to become a real Christian to be filled
[54:46] with God's own life it is only going to
[54:48] come by humility in the message
[54:50] believeth thou this he says if you ever
[54:52] get anything from God you have to humble
[54:55] yourself and become nothing before him
[54:59] and know nothing but one purpose that is
[55:03] you're trying to find Jesus then when
[55:07] you humble yourself down God will exalt
[55:10] but when you exalt yourself
[55:13] God will see that you are not brought to
[55:16] a base he said so in his word so we
[55:19] don't want to be found as proud you say
[55:22] well what would proud be proud would be
[55:24] to resist him who is making himself
[55:27] known to you
[55:30] that's Pride
[55:31] but the humility is to see him and to
[55:36] lower ourselves not just not our body
[55:39] but to lower our hearts because we can
[55:42] we can do a lot with our body we can do
[55:45] look there's a lot of religions in the
[55:47] world that my that when it would come to
[55:50] as far as even when you look at
[55:52] Christianity and my the way that they
[55:54] will treat their body and everything
[55:56] else even with you know I I think of the
[56:00] poor Roman Catholics that moved through
[56:02] the streets there in Manila in the
[56:04] Philippines and they are having you know
[56:06] people are lined out and they're
[56:07] carrying crosses and they're taking
[56:09] whips and they're whipping their back
[56:11] and all that takes place during the
[56:13] Easter time there and but to think that
[56:16] you know within this right here of how
[56:19] God within his Mercy that we recognize
[56:22] that God's desire for us is that our
[56:25] hearts would be moved in obedience to
[56:29] God
[56:31] we don't want just something that's on
[56:33] the outside we want that move on the
[56:36] inside
[56:37] man remember Satan chose the head God
[56:41] chose the heart
[56:43] James 4 10 humble yourselves in the
[56:46] sight this is the presence of the Lord
[56:49] and He Shall lift you up the very thing
[56:53] that has been mentioned all through the
[56:55] scriptures but here we've drawn from
[56:57] this in the New Testament and he shall
[56:59] lift you up so notice humble yourselves
[57:03] in the presence of God and he will lift
[57:05] you up to be lifted up or the word exalt
[57:08] from our text is to lift up on high to
[57:12] raise to the very summon of opulence and
[57:14] that means of abundance of richness and
[57:17] prosperity now I'm not speaking you know
[57:20] of a smiley tooth text and gospel here
[57:22] I'm talking about a real abundance of
[57:25] God's grace in your soul I'm talking
[57:27] about of how that the Paul would speak
[57:30] about that the commission that he was
[57:32] under is to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[57:35] Christ that we might know the riches of
[57:38] his grace which is Christ in you the
[57:41] hope of glory to exalt to raise to
[57:44] dignity honor and happiness and to think
[57:47] of it of how that you know Satan is
[57:50] always from the very fall in the
[57:52] beginning his enticement and his
[57:55] lurement even in heaven when Satan
[57:57] preached there in heaven and he led a
[58:00] third of the Angels astray he presented
[58:03] a kingdom that was more brighter more
[58:07] beautiful than that of Michael's Kingdom
[58:10] and there was a third of the angels that
[58:13] fell and were LED of weight now we know
[58:15] those angels now is demons they're
[58:18] they're spirits but there were
[58:21] two-thirds who never left their first
[58:23] estate is that right and now we find
[58:27] that from that of battle in heaven then
[58:29] when here upon Earth we find that Satan
[58:32] in the opening there uh in Ezekiel we
[58:35] find the call even in gym job one of how
[58:38] that that Satan himself was walking
[58:41] through and fro throughout the Earth
[58:43] even in Ezekiel while it was forming and
[58:46] Satan was wanting to lay claim upon this
[58:48] Earth he saw that God this God took an
[58:51] interest in this Beyond every other
[58:54] planet every other planet has its place
[58:56] for a sign but you know I could save
[58:59] NASA a lot of money
[59:01] quit wasting your money going out there
[59:03] and seeing if a bug can survive and move
[59:06] quit wasting your money to see is there
[59:09] another life out there God there's no
[59:11] other planet that is spoken of in terms
[59:14] of life outside of the word of God yet
[59:17] they're all in there as far as being
[59:19] parched within of the scripture but God
[59:21] took interest and Satan could see that
[59:24] there however that Satan is able to pick
[59:27] this up and Satan while the great
[59:29] volcanics was bulching belching up he
[59:32] was walking upon it wanting to lay a
[59:34] claim on it but you know Satan cannot
[59:37] lay claim on anything that belongs to
[59:40] God
[59:41] he might take it underneath his control
[59:44] for a while but there comes a ransom to
[59:47] release it from the control and the pawn
[59:50] shop of who's got a hold of him
[59:53] is that right now to think of how then
[59:56] through the fall in the beginning how
[59:58] that Satan Works same way he did in
[1:00:00] heaven he works in a way to try to
[1:00:02] present it in a manner to Eve that this
[1:00:04] would be a more a beautiful route and
[1:00:07] this would be a a wonderful thing you
[1:00:09] would be as God and he's drawing upon
[1:00:11] her and you know what he's doing in that
[1:00:14] moment she has never felt Pride before
[1:00:18] but in that moment she is being Anointed
[1:00:21] with unbelief in the word of God you say
[1:00:24] how can it be unbelief any anointing
[1:00:27] that leads you astray from the word of
[1:00:30] God is an anointing of unbelief I don't
[1:00:34] care how good it looks I don't care how
[1:00:36] good it feels I don't care how emotional
[1:00:39] it is or not anymore I don't care if it
[1:00:42] leads you outside of the word it is an
[1:00:45] evil spirit
[1:00:48] and let me just tell you the holy spirit
[1:00:51] will always lead you to the word through
[1:00:54] the path of the word because in order to
[1:00:57] fulfill the word there's got to be a
[1:00:59] door open for you and you can't go
[1:01:01] around that door you've got to come
[1:01:02] through that door
[1:01:04] is that right we find that without me
[1:01:06] elaborating we find that with Ahab and
[1:01:09] Jehoshaphat Ahab wanted to go take Ramos
[1:01:11] Gilead it belonged to him but you see
[1:01:13] Ahab was not coming through the open
[1:01:15] door Ahab was wanting to come in his own
[1:01:18] way with his own character but God had a
[1:01:21] man that wasn't ashamed of Elijah's
[1:01:23] message and he knew Elijah's message was
[1:01:25] true because God had Vindicated Elijah
[1:01:28] to be the voice of God in that day and
[1:01:30] Amica could stand there before all of
[1:01:33] them when they had zedekiah going around
[1:01:35] with horns and man you talk about an
[1:01:37] anointing man they were having such an
[1:01:39] emotional time but no Direction by the
[1:01:43] word
[1:01:44] is that right and then Micah stood there
[1:01:47] and he said but I've seen he said a line
[1:01:50] Spirit come up and he said that lion
[1:01:52] Spirit when God asked who can I get to
[1:01:55] get go down there and deceive them in
[1:01:58] their mouth and who can I get and the
[1:02:00] lion spirit said I'll go down there I'll
[1:02:02] tell you friends isn't that a sad thing
[1:02:04] that the lying Spirit could actually
[1:02:06] know if you let me go I can lead them
[1:02:09] outside of the will of God yet Ahab
[1:02:12] could argue and say this is God's word
[1:02:14] this is God's word but remember the will
[1:02:17] of God is the spirit of God and when the
[1:02:20] spirit of Truth has come he will lead
[1:02:22] and guide you into all true that's how
[1:02:25] you know whether you got the holy ghost
[1:02:27] or not if they lead you away from it it
[1:02:29] ain't the Holy Ghost if there's things
[1:02:31] coming out of your life that doesn't
[1:02:33] line up with the word it ain't the Holy
[1:02:35] Ghost because when he comes he'll lead
[1:02:37] you into the word
[1:02:39] not away from
[1:02:44] it we were born to be Sons and Daughters
[1:02:46] of God
[1:02:47] brother Brandon says it like this he
[1:02:49] says but you let the devil get a hold of
[1:02:51] you and you want to become glamor girls
[1:02:53] and populars and everything else but
[1:02:56] humble yourself before the hand of God
[1:02:58] so God can make Sons and Daughters out
[1:03:02] of you I'll tell you that's the kind of
[1:03:03] exalting God's talking about this
[1:03:06] exalting is not about a personality it's
[1:03:09] not about a family name it's not about a
[1:03:11] who's who this exalting is about
[1:03:14] exalting that seed that was beneath the
[1:03:17] darkness as the Son and Daughter of God
[1:03:19] let me tell you the woman at the well
[1:03:21] when she came there she submitted
[1:03:24] herself under the mighty hand of God and
[1:03:27] I'll tell you what you saw leave that
[1:03:29] well was no longer a woman of ill Fame
[1:03:32] but you saw a daughter of God that had
[1:03:35] been exalted by the mighty hand of God
[1:03:38] because she was willing to Humble
[1:03:41] herself
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:43] so to Humble ourselves I'll say it this
[1:03:46] way it's the grace of God to recognize
[1:03:48] him
[1:03:49] amen his presence his word and humbling
[1:03:53] ourselves in obedience to his voice
[1:03:58] don't ever underestimate obedience
[1:04:01] you could have everything else in the
[1:04:03] world
[1:04:04] but if you don't have obedience you've
[1:04:06] failed
[1:04:08] Saul was offering up offerings he was a
[1:04:10] lot of things right Saul could prophesy
[1:04:13] Saul could get under the anointing of
[1:04:15] the spirit of God is that right
[1:04:17] come on I'm talking scripture now
[1:04:19] but but what Saul couldn't do is humble
[1:04:22] himself in obedience to the world
[1:04:25] now we're not against all those things
[1:04:27] you understand when one against David
[1:04:30] prophesying all of those things but what
[1:04:32] it comes down to is is everything itself
[1:04:35] our discernment our strength our
[1:04:37] fortitude our foundation is the word of
[1:04:40] God
[1:04:41] nothing else
[1:04:44] are you hearing me
[1:04:46] amen so then we find humility is what
[1:04:49] opens the gates to the transforming
[1:04:51] power of God that's what opens it and we
[1:04:55] can say well God you humble me no that's
[1:04:57] not God's remember God says you humble
[1:04:59] yourself
[1:05:00] and if you don't I'll humble you
[1:05:04] right because you say well well I'm not
[1:05:07] exalting myself if you don't humble
[1:05:09] yourself in his presence you're exalting
[1:05:10] yourself above the word you can't stand
[1:05:12] eye to eye with the word
[1:05:15] you'll never see it in the right way
[1:05:16] you'll see it as somebody wanting to
[1:05:19] rule over your life but when you get
[1:05:21] into the right position like the man who
[1:05:24] was looking at the painting and the
[1:05:25] painting looked horrible
[1:05:28] but the man who knew about that painting
[1:05:30] said you're looking at it in the wrong
[1:05:32] perspective
[1:05:34] kneel down here get down on your knees
[1:05:38] Now look up at it and when he knelt down
[1:05:41] and he looked up at it a total different
[1:05:43] scene a total different picture why the
[1:05:46] perspective was changed based on his
[1:05:50] stature
[1:05:52] I'll tell you when our heart is in place
[1:05:54] and he said brother say no how do I
[1:05:56] bring my heart into that place he will
[1:05:58] lead you you're in sheep he's a shepherd
[1:06:01] He knows how to lead our hearts into
[1:06:03] that place where we humble ourselves
[1:06:06] under his hand
[1:06:09] so that's what opens gates to the
[1:06:12] transforming power of God and that'll
[1:06:14] Lift You above whatever you're facing
[1:06:16] Isaiah 66 1.
[1:06:19] thus saith the Lord the heaven is my
[1:06:22] throne Earth is my footstool where is
[1:06:25] the house that ye build unto me and
[1:06:28] where is the place on my rest for all
[1:06:31] these those things hath mine hand made
[1:06:33] and all those things have been saith the
[1:06:36] Lord you know there wasn't one material
[1:06:39] think of this in the Tabernacle in the
[1:06:41] wilderness
[1:06:42] that was God's desire God was giving a
[1:06:45] foreshadowing
[1:06:47] now his is the purpose of redemption is
[1:06:50] that God might come in Tabernacle inside
[1:06:53] of man
[1:06:54] he had that when he walked in Eden in
[1:06:58] his people
[1:06:59] he was tabernacled inside of him now
[1:07:02] every every element they have the gold
[1:07:04] the silver the brass all of those things
[1:07:07] even even the different extracts that
[1:07:10] they would take from the animals and so
[1:07:11] forth to make the dyes all of those
[1:07:14] things from the wood to the gold to the
[1:07:16] silver to those animals he the Lord had
[1:07:19] made
[1:07:20] they were only taking from what God had
[1:07:23] made and it looked just to be trees a
[1:07:26] gold silver brass but you see under the
[1:07:29] vision of God then those things that the
[1:07:33] wonderful in their own but yet under the
[1:07:36] vision of God they came into a place
[1:07:39] that would actually Express God's desire
[1:07:42] and the Mystery that God had in himself
[1:07:46] that God wanted to Tabernacle inside of
[1:07:50] man and God tells them what can you
[1:07:52] build me other than what I've already
[1:07:54] made
[1:07:55] I've provided all these things but you
[1:07:58] see God he is Jehovah Jireh he provides
[1:08:03] for himself and that's where that seed
[1:08:06] of God comes from on the inside it was
[1:08:09] not you putting it there it's not a
[1:08:12] Sunday school teacher putting it there
[1:08:13] it wasn't when your heart was pricked
[1:08:16] that put it there it was there the whole
[1:08:18] time what is that that is God has placed
[1:08:22] that there as a place that God can step
[1:08:25] into and the prophet said receive
[1:08:28] himself
[1:08:30] into his Temple
[1:08:33] it's God it's not you receiving the Holy
[1:08:36] Ghost it is God the prophet says it like
[1:08:38] this it's the faith of God receiving
[1:08:41] himself into the temple not made with
[1:08:44] hands
[1:08:45] so how can we glory in anything we can't
[1:08:51] Grace is given to the humble
[1:08:55] but to this man
[1:08:57] verse 2. will I look notice what God
[1:09:01] said this is what's going to get my
[1:09:03] attention
[1:09:03] even to him that is poor meaning humble
[1:09:07] end of contrite spirit of broken a
[1:09:11] broken spirit
[1:09:13] and trembleth
[1:09:15] at my word
[1:09:17] I want you to think of this here let's
[1:09:19] go to Genesis 4. and let's look here
[1:09:22] that after the fall
[1:09:25] where two boys Came To Worship
[1:09:29] here they came Abel and Cain
[1:09:31] now I'm going to tell you that both of
[1:09:33] them came to worship God
[1:09:36] and I'm going to tell you that both of
[1:09:37] them was humble
[1:09:40] don't worry I've got quotes to stand up
[1:09:42] both of them was coming to worship
[1:09:46] verse 3 of Genesis 4 and in process of
[1:09:49] time it came to pass that King brought
[1:09:53] of the fruit
[1:09:54] of the ground and offering unto the Lord
[1:09:57] and Abel he also brought of the
[1:10:00] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[1:10:03] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[1:10:06] Abel and to his offering
[1:10:09] here's one thing that's very certain
[1:10:12] God's had contact with Abel
[1:10:19] I tell you something about tremendous of
[1:10:21] showing up with a Vindication that you
[1:10:23] know I'm going to be accepted yeah not
[1:10:26] an arrogance not a pride
[1:10:28] but God has made himself known that I'm
[1:10:31] walking with the confidence
[1:10:33] it's not a maybe when I get down to the
[1:10:36] last to my last breath or when something
[1:10:39] had no no but to walk with a certainty
[1:10:41] in this life
[1:10:43] you say how how would that come about by
[1:10:46] God coming down to reveal himself and
[1:10:49] make himself known
[1:10:51] Cain's coming too but Cain's certainty
[1:10:55] is not based on the same thing Abel
[1:11:00] but under Cain and to his offering
[1:11:03] offering he had not respect
[1:11:04] and Cain was very rough and his
[1:11:07] countenance fell
[1:11:11] and the Lord said unto King why thou Raw
[1:11:15] and why is that countenance Fallen
[1:11:18] you understand
[1:11:21] God is looking at something that I would
[1:11:23] say
[1:11:24] we couldn't even see if we could look in
[1:11:27] outwardly you wouldn't even see this on
[1:11:29] Kings
[1:11:31] but God's looking down deep
[1:11:35] and God sees where his countenance is
[1:11:37] interpression is falling
[1:11:40] he's rough he picks up listen God is a
[1:11:43] discerner friends we can we can look any
[1:11:46] way we want to look but God knows the
[1:11:48] heart
[1:11:49] them Pharisees which was religious as
[1:11:51] religious could be but the word is a
[1:11:54] discerner and let me just tell you this
[1:11:56] the word don't come to shame you are you
[1:12:00] hearing me the word comes to expose
[1:12:03] Satan's works
[1:12:06] and uncover him
[1:12:09] notice what God Said in verse 7 if thou
[1:12:12] do us well
[1:12:13] shalt thou not be accepted and if thou
[1:12:16] doest not well send life at the door
[1:12:19] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[1:12:22] thou shalt rule over him
[1:12:24] I want you to think of this brother
[1:12:26] Brown says it like this in the great
[1:12:28] warrior Joshua he says if God only
[1:12:30] expects you to be Fundamentalist
[1:12:33] then he could not condemn Moab and
[1:12:35] accept Israel he'd be unjust
[1:12:38] Cain was just as fundamental as Abel was
[1:12:42] he was a believer
[1:12:44] build a church and worship offered
[1:12:48] sacrifice and humbled himself before God
[1:12:51] who did that Cain did it
[1:12:56] all of this King did
[1:12:59] but yet Cain did not receive Grace
[1:13:03] he didn't receive Grace he built a
[1:13:06] church
[1:13:07] that took some labor
[1:13:08] that took some sacrifice can't you see
[1:13:11] why Paul could say in First Corinthians
[1:13:13] 13 though I give my goods to feed the
[1:13:15] poor though I speak in tongues though I
[1:13:17] prophesy though I do all these other
[1:13:19] things unless I have love I'm not
[1:13:22] talking about an ooey gooey powdered
[1:13:25] sugar feeling I'm talking about the love
[1:13:27] of God that loves God loves his word
[1:13:30] above everything even above your own
[1:13:33] thoughts
[1:13:34] that's the love of God
[1:13:37] everything else will eventually cease
[1:13:40] but charity never failures
[1:13:45] Cain was just as fundamental as Abel was
[1:13:47] was a Believer build a church worship
[1:13:50] offered sacrifice humbled himself before
[1:13:53] God if it only takes to be a believer
[1:13:56] well you say I'm a Believer well if
[1:13:58] God's never give you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:00] you're not a Believer yet for God is
[1:14:03] under obligation to give you the holy
[1:14:05] spirit scripture when he said repent and
[1:14:08] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:10] for the remission of sins you shout not
[1:14:13] maybe not might not could be you shall
[1:14:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost God's
[1:14:19] under obligation to do it for it forts
[1:14:23] to who the apostles no sir Peter said
[1:14:25] it's for you and your children and them
[1:14:28] that's far off even as many as the Lord
[1:14:30] Our God shall call no matter how far it
[1:14:33] is it's for every believer
[1:14:36] now notice when we look at this of how
[1:14:39] that even in Christ the mystery even how
[1:14:41] Lucifer we talked about in heaven when
[1:14:43] where everything was painted up so
[1:14:45] beautiful there is in heaven and how
[1:14:47] that even came to Eve and said surely
[1:14:50] you know oh you know God doesn't care
[1:14:52] that don't matter to God surely you
[1:14:55] won't die I'm going to tell you
[1:14:57] something anything that deviates from
[1:14:59] the word and tells you it's all right
[1:15:01] you better run from it because it is not
[1:15:04] of God
[1:15:05] it doesn't matter if it's inside a
[1:15:08] church
[1:15:09] it doesn't matter if it's as religious
[1:15:11] as religious could be remember John was
[1:15:14] given a personal tour on the Isle of
[1:15:17] Patmos and here in a vision he saw that
[1:15:21] that woman on a Scarlet colored beast
[1:15:23] and John was breathtaken by the Bible
[1:15:26] says oh he was an awestruck by her she
[1:15:29] was decked out in Garb that seemed to be
[1:15:32] so holy crosses and everything else but
[1:15:36] once it was uncovered what was in her
[1:15:39] was the blood of the martyrs she was not
[1:15:43] one that wanted to promote life she was
[1:15:46] one that wanted to take life
[1:15:49] wow I don't care what the Roman Catholic
[1:15:51] Church says they're the biggest
[1:15:52] promoters of abortion there is not just
[1:15:55] naturally but spiritually
[1:15:58] that happens in those convents come on
[1:16:00] friends we're not ignorant of these
[1:16:02] things not only does it happen in the
[1:16:04] natural it's happened spiritual that
[1:16:07] same Babylonian spirit that anointed
[1:16:10] Pharaoh in Egypt that wanted to kill all
[1:16:13] the children and try to get to the
[1:16:15] promise that's the same way the spirit
[1:16:17] of the devil will do is to try to kill
[1:16:20] and bring an abort to what God is
[1:16:23] wanting to bring forth in your life
[1:16:30] Satan could say my we're a beautiful
[1:16:32] church I mean God surely well look at
[1:16:34] our great buildings look at all these
[1:16:36] other things
[1:16:37] but that's not what God's looking for
[1:16:40] in paragraph 62 he said the same thing
[1:16:42] that's the same thing Cain did brought
[1:16:44] in the pretty fruits from the ground
[1:16:46] that he had tilled toiled and worked and
[1:16:49] brought in the fruits and rejected the
[1:16:52] humble blood of the Lamb
[1:16:55] Cain didn't want nothing to do with that
[1:16:56] that's too messy
[1:16:58] I don't want nothing to do with that
[1:17:02] now Cain didn't come in offer God
[1:17:04] some of these hydroponic tomatoes we get
[1:17:06] out of wherever
[1:17:08] some of these I tell you there's one
[1:17:10] thing on my wife y'all know this already
[1:17:11] my wife would send me and we know when
[1:17:13] we go I'd sometimes try to help her out
[1:17:14] and go to the store and things like that
[1:17:16] you know the part by the way that I
[1:17:17] hated I hated going to produce
[1:17:20] especially I'd look on there and see
[1:17:21] pick up Tomatoes you say why because
[1:17:23] they are fake
[1:17:25] I don't like those Tomatoes they don't
[1:17:27] look real
[1:17:29] when I was a little boy I remember
[1:17:30] Tomatoes they actually were the color
[1:17:32] red not pink
[1:17:35] not keep them on your windowsill for two
[1:17:37] years and they'll be ready for salsa in
[1:17:39] two years from now
[1:17:41] yeah
[1:17:43] what am I saying Cain did not bring God
[1:17:46] just some haphazard something
[1:17:49] he did not bring him apples or tomatoes
[1:17:53] or things where worms are crawling out
[1:17:55] of it
[1:17:56] he brought him
[1:17:58] his very best
[1:18:06] now watch this in God's power to
[1:18:08] transform
[1:18:10] he said Abel's message had been received
[1:18:13] his message remember God had revealed
[1:18:16] himself to Abel you can read it in
[1:18:17] Hebrews 11. Abel's message had been
[1:18:20] received how do I know it's been
[1:18:22] received because the fire came down on
[1:18:24] the altar
[1:18:26] how do I know when my message when the
[1:18:28] message from my heart when it's received
[1:18:30] the fire will come down and consume for
[1:18:33] our God is a consuming
[1:18:36] fire
[1:18:38] well how do I know how how do I know how
[1:18:40] to build the altar well the altar's
[1:18:41] already been established the altar is
[1:18:43] Calvary and that altar of Calvary will
[1:18:46] lead you to an altar in your own life of
[1:18:48] self-surrender
[1:18:50] and when you're following the word he'll
[1:18:51] let you know how to put the wood in
[1:18:53] order he'll let you know how to put
[1:18:54] everything get your life in order well
[1:18:56] brother Samuel I just want the fire of
[1:18:58] God listen to me friends you can ask God
[1:19:01] for the Holy Ghost without having your
[1:19:03] life in order
[1:19:06] this time I want quotes on that I can
[1:19:08] give you an abundance of them brothers
[1:19:09] brother random why don't you teach these
[1:19:11] women how to receive great gifts why
[1:19:13] don't you this is a quote doors and door
[1:19:15] why don't you teach them how to receive
[1:19:17] the Holy Ghost he said they won't even
[1:19:19] let their hair grow how can I teach them
[1:19:22] to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:19:25] see sometimes we're looking at things
[1:19:27] and we know the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:19:29] it'll consume the desires it'll change
[1:19:32] our life but sometimes we're wanting God
[1:19:34] to do every single thing in our life and
[1:19:38] that's why it's missed we must ourselves
[1:19:41] humble
[1:19:42] ourselves
[1:19:45] before him
[1:19:47] then he will exalt you
[1:19:50] in due time
[1:19:51] how long Lord in due time
[1:19:55] don't put him on timeline
[1:19:57] don't put him on a timeline
[1:20:00] are you hearing me friends now let me
[1:20:01] just say this do I believe that God can
[1:20:03] take care there can be a man that's a
[1:20:05] severe alcoholic and right here this
[1:20:07] morning why are the words going forth
[1:20:08] even as the service maybe we'll have
[1:20:10] prayer at the end God will absolutely
[1:20:13] can come right down if that man's desire
[1:20:15] is to really surrender his heart to God
[1:20:17] God will take care of that alcoholic
[1:20:19] Spirit he'll take that right out of that
[1:20:21] man's life and God can feel that life do
[1:20:24] you realize full obedience it's not all
[1:20:28] together at my works you can come into
[1:20:30] full obedience while the words being
[1:20:32] preached
[1:20:33] and then that entitles you
[1:20:36] to the token
[1:20:38] is that clear
[1:20:40] notice this he's seen Abel's message had
[1:20:43] been received and Cain saw it
[1:20:46] and know that God had Vindicated that
[1:20:48] message right
[1:20:50] but he just
[1:20:51] couldn't do it his pride oh what a
[1:20:55] horrible thing pride is his pride kept
[1:20:58] him from it that's right his pride kept
[1:21:01] him from doing it he's seen God
[1:21:03] vindicate the message do you catch what
[1:21:05] the prophet's saying here his pride kept
[1:21:07] him from doing it it wasn't that Cain
[1:21:10] didn't want to do it his pride
[1:21:13] there are things that he thought of that
[1:21:15] Satan flashed before his eyes flashed
[1:21:18] before him if you do this friends will
[1:21:20] turn on you if you do this this could
[1:21:22] happen what was it it was shaped and
[1:21:24] operated in that door of pride
[1:21:29] he wanted to but he couldn't
[1:21:32] that's why brother Graham could stand at
[1:21:34] the end and preach not only in this
[1:21:35] message but he goes on to preach and the
[1:21:37] message Shalom actually was a year
[1:21:38] before he preached these messages and he
[1:21:39] says I've realized he said I feel sorry
[1:21:41] for the people he said the gross
[1:21:42] Darkness that's upon the people there's
[1:21:44] people they want to do right he said
[1:21:46] there's women that hear you shouldn't
[1:21:48] cut their hair that's according to
[1:21:49] scripture yeah here men and all these
[1:21:51] other things that are laid out there
[1:21:53] even in those very basic things that we
[1:21:55] in ourselves can do in honor and
[1:21:57] humility to the word of God but he says
[1:21:59] they want to do it this is the prophet's
[1:22:01] words but something won't let them
[1:22:05] what is it spirits
[1:22:10] but I'm glad there's one here
[1:22:13] that's present to break every spirit
[1:22:16] oh friends I'm not just announcing and
[1:22:18] I'm also a witness of that a witness in
[1:22:20] my own life and I am a witness through
[1:22:22] this congregation I am a witness where
[1:22:25] God seen in God's stand countless times
[1:22:27] even throughout the world the places
[1:22:29] even I've been and watch God break
[1:22:32] Spirits where Spirits themselves have
[1:22:35] lost their hold on a life and the life
[1:22:37] stands there and says I'm ready for my
[1:22:39] Liberty
[1:22:43] that's the hymn his pride kept him from
[1:22:46] doing it he's seen God vindicate the
[1:22:49] message he says oh it seems to be now so
[1:22:52] hard for people to Humble themselves to
[1:22:56] the word of God they just don't want to
[1:22:59] do it they'll humble themselves to the
[1:23:02] Creed of the church
[1:23:04] but not to the word of God
[1:23:09] everything The Humble everything
[1:23:10] remember Cain humbled himself but
[1:23:13] they'll humble themselves up to
[1:23:14] everything
[1:23:15] but the new birth
[1:23:17] they'll humble themselves up everything
[1:23:19] but to death
[1:23:22] to self
[1:23:26] I want you to think of this here
[1:23:29] Cain's offering
[1:23:31] was indeed a production or a product of
[1:23:33] life
[1:23:34] it was life life that had traveled
[1:23:36] through the vlines through the tree
[1:23:37] through all the plants and he came to
[1:23:39] offer up those fruits
[1:23:41] but within that
[1:23:43] his offering didn't require death
[1:23:47] it didn't require Cain going
[1:23:49] taking back his knife and slaying the
[1:23:52] Apple
[1:23:54] right cutting the tomato
[1:23:57] but Abel's offering had life in it
[1:24:03] it was a pre-figure
[1:24:05] of the Lamb of God
[1:24:08] an innocent one
[1:24:10] a first sling of the flock
[1:24:13] one it would be a firstborn to pay the
[1:24:16] price for the other firstborns that were
[1:24:17] coming on
[1:24:19] and he would lead him there that land
[1:24:24] he was leading him there the whole way
[1:24:26] there when he placed him on the altar
[1:24:30] came places his fruit over there Abel's
[1:24:33] lamb is placed there and Abel rears back
[1:24:35] and he's having to you know hold it
[1:24:37] right there and it begins to make that
[1:24:39] cut
[1:24:41] and that live that gurgling is going out
[1:24:43] that life
[1:24:45] that's what happened on Calvary yeah
[1:24:49] he was it was life
[1:24:51] is going out
[1:24:52] blood that was being shed
[1:24:55] why was it blood because blood had taken
[1:24:58] us out
[1:25:00] why did God have to become through that
[1:25:03] of a virgin-born son
[1:25:05] because the blood was polluted
[1:25:09] there was not I don't care how righteous
[1:25:11] a man could be he was not worthy to die
[1:25:14] for another man because he himself was
[1:25:17] born in sin and shaped in iniquity it
[1:25:19] took God himself coming down and
[1:25:22] creating a blood cell
[1:25:26] that he could go and pay the price for
[1:25:28] you and I
[1:25:31] are you talking about Grace
[1:25:35] Matthew 18 1 the same time came the
[1:25:38] disciples unto Jesus and said who's the
[1:25:40] greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus
[1:25:42] called a little child unto him and set
[1:25:44] him in the midst of him watch this great
[1:25:47] deep deep deep deep answer who's the
[1:25:49] greatest who's the greatest and he
[1:25:51] called out a little child
[1:25:53] he's called a little child come here
[1:25:56] set him right in the midst so their
[1:25:58] focus will be upon this child
[1:26:00] he said except you be converted and
[1:26:03] become as a little child you shall not
[1:26:07] enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:26:11] so to come into a place of repentance
[1:26:15] and become like that of the little child
[1:26:17] who is it that can bring repentance it's
[1:26:19] not man it's not friends it's nothing
[1:26:21] but God do you realize when you
[1:26:24] recognize listen to me now when you
[1:26:27] recognize you're wrong that is the
[1:26:29] presence of God
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:31] but how dangerous it is for lives that
[1:26:35] don't recognize they're they're wrong
[1:26:36] why they don't recognize his presence
[1:26:40] but when you can recognize his presence
[1:26:42] and say God have mercy on me
[1:26:45] Lord help me Lord I'm in need Lord Doug
[1:26:49] it says Grace his presence that's a time
[1:26:52] to humble yourself
[1:26:56] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[1:27:00] as this little child
[1:27:02] the same is greatest in the Kingdom of
[1:27:04] Heaven you know a real a real little
[1:27:06] child there's something about it there
[1:27:08] have to be couldn't be a teenager right
[1:27:09] here it'd have to be something maybe
[1:27:11] could have had to be like a toddler or
[1:27:12] smaller because you know what he's
[1:27:14] speaking to you and I on the Simplicity
[1:27:16] of a child childlike Faith to Simply
[1:27:18] believe God and trust him
[1:27:21] that's what it takes for a child but you
[1:27:23] know the older we get the smarter we get
[1:27:24] and actually the Dumber we get we trust
[1:27:27] everything else the less We Trust more
[1:27:29] in our own selves We Trust more on our
[1:27:31] own abilities and we didn't even give
[1:27:33] ourselves those abilities you never put
[1:27:35] those talents in you or I went to
[1:27:37] college let me tell you something there
[1:27:38] ain't a professor one that taught you
[1:27:40] how to be this or taught you how to be
[1:27:42] that those skills were already in you
[1:27:46] and you've come to find out what God has
[1:27:49] placed within you that he will direct
[1:27:52] and provide for himself
[1:27:55] God promised he'd be a provider he'd
[1:27:57] take care of you
[1:27:58] I don't have time to spend time on that
[1:28:00] and go back to the book of that citizen
[1:28:01] prove that statement but that's
[1:28:02] scripture now I want you to understand
[1:28:04] this these very things to become as a
[1:28:08] child the same as the greatest in the
[1:28:10] Kingdom of Heaven what to be born of the
[1:28:12] spirit of God to allow the spirit of God
[1:28:14] to lead us in Repentance to move Upon
[1:28:17] Our Lives into a place of surrender to
[1:28:20] where we are born into the kingdom of
[1:28:22] God that is the greatest
[1:28:26] Luke 10 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced
[1:28:29] in the spirit and said I thank the O
[1:28:31] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[1:28:33] thou Hast hid these things from the wise
[1:28:35] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[1:28:37] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:28:40] in thy sight boy I'm so thankful for
[1:28:42] that
[1:28:43] you might say brother Samuel will you
[1:28:45] you know you've got a Bachelor's degree
[1:28:46] and a master's degree but I don't
[1:28:47] understand God by a bachelor's degree or
[1:28:49] master's degree
[1:28:51] I don't understand God that way
[1:28:53] listen the scripture tells us in the
[1:28:55] book of Isaiah 29 that they delivered
[1:28:57] this book to one who is unlearned and
[1:28:59] the unlearned says I cannot read it
[1:29:01] because I'm not learned and they
[1:29:03] delivered delivered it to the Learned
[1:29:05] person and the Learned person said I
[1:29:06] can't read it because the words of this
[1:29:08] book are as the words of a book that's
[1:29:10] sealed
[1:29:11] so there's only one that can reveal the
[1:29:15] contents of this book and that's the
[1:29:17] Holy Ghost it's the same holy spirit
[1:29:19] that moved upon the prophets of old that
[1:29:23] gave them and lifted them Beyond this
[1:29:25] Dimension that they were dwelling in and
[1:29:28] begin to let them tap into the thoughts
[1:29:31] in the mind of God let me tell you we
[1:29:33] might be sitting here at 15 30 Lake
[1:29:35] Breeze road but we are privileged to
[1:29:38] enter into Heavenly places where the
[1:29:41] thoughts of God are breaking over our
[1:29:43] lives and we're being lifted by the
[1:29:46] thoughts of almighty God
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] thank you
[1:29:51] in fellowship with the Holy Ghost in
[1:29:54] fellowship with the prophets in
[1:29:56] fellowship with all the sages of old we
[1:30:00] are partakers of the same life that
[1:30:02] anointed them lifted them gave them
[1:30:04] Grace to live and the same Holy Ghost
[1:30:07] has returned after Calvary and Has
[1:30:10] Lifted us into the thoughts of God
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:16] reveal them unto who babes
[1:30:24] we think we're big stuff we don't need a
[1:30:26] car seat anymore a booster seat and
[1:30:28] we're big stuff
[1:30:30] I can ride in the front seat now
[1:30:33] law says you got to be 18 to ride there
[1:30:36] just don't check that out I'm only tease
[1:30:37] it
[1:30:39] I can ride up front now
[1:30:41] and this and but notice isn't it look
[1:30:44] look how look look how it works it works
[1:30:46] so contrary to the way that in our human
[1:30:49] nature we are purported and told come on
[1:30:54] come on come on you got to pick up
[1:30:55] responsibility come on come on nothing
[1:30:56] wrong with that come on come on come on
[1:30:58] in come on and you know sometimes things
[1:31:00] go along and depending on how
[1:31:01] backgrounds will be even lives are told
[1:31:04] don't cry sissies cry you shouldn't cry
[1:31:06] you're a boy you're a man Sissy's cry
[1:31:10] I don't know how I got on that
[1:31:14] would you understand all of these things
[1:31:16] come along and all those things it may
[1:31:19] not be even a crying here but it can
[1:31:21] teach such a hardness down here
[1:31:24] this is manly and this is this aren't
[1:31:28] you grateful for the grace of God that
[1:31:30] comes to teach us
[1:31:32] I'm glad for it I thank you Jesus
[1:31:37] everything is so within the world
[1:31:40] everything is so contrary to that of
[1:31:43] humility the world is let me step on you
[1:31:45] till I can get there
[1:31:48] that's that's how the world everything
[1:31:49] is is placed around because remember
[1:31:52] Satan who is the perverter and now this
[1:31:57] world not the Earth the world the system
[1:31:58] that's on it is started based on that of
[1:32:01] Pride started based on that of Love
[1:32:03] desires and things outside of the word
[1:32:05] of God
[1:32:07] and drawing people into that place
[1:32:09] always purporting and pushing other
[1:32:10] things ahead but notice what the
[1:32:13] contrary
[1:32:14] he reveals unto babes
[1:32:18] to be able to become little
[1:32:21] to say Lord
[1:32:23] show me your word Lord
[1:32:27] I look at Moses here he was Moses had
[1:32:30] met the pillar fire he had come out of
[1:32:32] Egypt God had led him to this place but
[1:32:34] he asked God show me yourself
[1:32:38] show me yourself
[1:32:41] Lead Me Lord oh it never stops to our
[1:32:44] lives as a Believer Lord show me
[1:32:46] yourself Lord make yourself known more
[1:32:50] to me Lord
[1:32:51] think of it to me that of a babe the
[1:32:54] room says you don't have to be smart you
[1:32:55] don't have you just have to humble
[1:32:57] yourself God's words are Secret Love
[1:33:00] Letters to his church
[1:33:03] my mama and Faith once delivered to the
[1:33:06] Saints he says be a baby now that's the
[1:33:08] only time you'll hear a pastor say that
[1:33:10] be a baby humble yourself and say oh God
[1:33:14] here I am just make yourself known to me
[1:33:18] I love you
[1:33:20] God will reveal himself to you he will
[1:33:23] make himself known
[1:33:25] notice I love you see friends that's
[1:33:28] where it all begins
[1:33:29] everything else that can be done that's
[1:33:32] fine but but most importantly fall in
[1:33:35] love with him
[1:33:37] you fall in love with him
[1:33:39] he'll take your life over
[1:33:42] lord I Love You Lord teach me show me
[1:33:45] Lord help me move upon my life Lord
[1:33:47] bring me into that place oh brother the
[1:33:49] same you don't know how many times don't
[1:33:51] be proud don't resist him
[1:33:54] let's say God help me lead me to that
[1:33:57] place Lord even in my heart in my life
[1:34:00] help me to stay tender help me to stay
[1:34:02] humble Lord in the midst of a world that
[1:34:05] is so divided such division everywhere
[1:34:08] such hatred such and Tall so many things
[1:34:11] but God help me to stay humble
[1:34:14] help me Lord
[1:34:20] James chapter 1 verse 22 be ye doers of
[1:34:23] the word
[1:34:24] and not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:34:27] selves
[1:34:28] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[1:34:31] not a doer he is like a man beholding
[1:34:33] his natural face in a glass
[1:34:36] for he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[1:34:38] way and straight we forgiveth what
[1:34:39] manner of man he was that's like getting
[1:34:41] up in the morning
[1:34:42] and not taking care of your bed head

[1:35:08] could try to get you distracted with
[1:35:09] friends family on and on and on we could
[1:35:12] go any way anything he can see that'll
[1:35:15] get you to take your eyes off what the
[1:35:17] spirit of God is wanting you and I to
[1:35:19] focus on maybe it's we need to comb this
[1:35:21] maybe we got the big spot on our shirt
[1:35:23] and we're like oh my I just got
[1:35:25] everything straightened out I got this
[1:35:26] big spot maybe you put your jeans on to
[1:35:28] go to work and you got the big bleach
[1:35:29] spot right here and you know here you
[1:35:31] got to go out and sail that day and you
[1:35:32] look at it and all of a sudden oh my
[1:35:34] goodness I got to get going oh I forgot
[1:35:36] I gotta run by here first I got to go to

[1:35:41] see all it takes are you hearing me now
[1:35:43] it isn't all together willfulness
[1:35:46] friends
[1:35:47] it's sometimes the things that we allow
[1:35:49] to distract us
[1:35:52] from what God is wanting us to focus on
[1:35:56] but here's verse 25 but whoso looketh I
[1:36:00] love this looketh in into the perfect
[1:36:05] are in he being not a forgetful hero but

[1:37:14] through it all
[1:37:16] everybody okay
[1:37:20] so there's a great great difference
[1:37:22] between being religious
[1:37:25] and having Revelation it's a great
[1:37:27] difference
[1:37:29] I mean there's people that listen
[1:37:30] friends people can be so religious they
[1:37:33] can quote you scriptures quote you the
[1:37:35] Bible
[1:37:36] buddy you put one scripture they'll
[1:37:37] finish a chapter for you
[1:37:40] that's
[1:37:42] if there's no life behind it
[1:37:44] that's only religion
[1:37:47] and religions are covering
[1:37:50] whether it's quotes whether it's
[1:37:51] scriptures
[1:37:53] that's not I say it in a way that we
[1:37:56] might understand God's desire is not
[1:37:58] religion God don't want you and I to
[1:38:00] impress him
[1:38:03] I don't want you you and I had to
[1:38:04] impress him we don't have to try to gain
[1:38:06] his approval
[1:38:09] he has already expressed his love to you
[1:38:12] and I he came and he gave them his life
[1:38:15] for you and he sent back the Holy Ghost
[1:38:18] you want to know what he thinks about
[1:38:19] you he's continued to knock at your door
[1:38:23] God ain't just sending you a word he
[1:38:26] himself is coming and Knocking at Your
[1:38:28] Heart let me in let me take control of
[1:38:32] your life
[1:38:33] amen that's God's thoughts towards you
[1:38:36] there's a great difference between being
[1:38:38] religious and having Revelation the
[1:38:41] Bible says in second Timothy 3 5 I don't
[1:38:43] have time to read the whole scripture
[1:38:45] but it says they then this hour we're
[1:38:47] living in a Peerless times men would
[1:38:50] have a form of godliness but would deny
[1:38:52] the power thereof
[1:38:54] but the Bible said like this they'll
[1:38:56] preach the blood
[1:38:57] they preach the sacrifice and they
[1:38:59] preach all the fundamentals of the
[1:39:01] scripture
[1:39:02] but they leave out the new birth
[1:39:05] and they'll call the new birth for being
[1:39:07] born again as you just sign your name to
[1:39:09] a book or you accept Jesus Christ as
[1:39:12] your savior hey that's a start but when
[1:39:14] he comes in
[1:39:16] he wants to be Lord
[1:39:18] not your savior
[1:39:21] but he wants to be Lord
[1:39:23] of your life
[1:39:26] Hallelujah I thank God for salvation I
[1:39:29] fellowship with anybody on salvation the
[1:39:31] job Barbershop wherever more hey we'll
[1:39:33] Fellowship on that but I also know
[1:39:35] there's a deeper walk it may not be a
[1:39:37] deeper walk for them but I'm encouraging
[1:39:38] and knowing this right here that when I
[1:39:40] went a church or anybody says hey this
[1:39:43] is where it's all at and this is no
[1:39:44] there is there is a further walk with
[1:39:48] God and God's desire is for himself to
[1:39:51] Tabernacle inside of you
[1:39:54] I don't believe that's necessary
[1:39:57] is that Pride
[1:39:58] or humility
[1:40:01] as I'm based on my thoughts it's based
[1:40:03] on the word of God
[1:40:05] is that right remember God will resist
[1:40:08] the proud
[1:40:10] Hallelujah now notice this is to me is
[1:40:13] one incredible in verse six where it
[1:40:14] says for this sort they are they which
[1:40:16] creep into houses and Lead captives
[1:40:19] silly women not Holy Ghost Field silly
[1:40:21] women Laden with sins LED away with
[1:40:25] diverse lusts in other words they're
[1:40:26] just looking for something that will
[1:40:29] allow them to feel religious
[1:40:31] and still have all of this in their life
[1:40:36] coverings
[1:40:38] ever learning to me when I read this
[1:40:39] scripture
[1:40:40] scripts what a sad What a Sad condition
[1:40:43] ever learning
[1:40:45] learning you know the Bible said in
[1:40:47] Daniel in the last days that knowledge
[1:40:49] would increase
[1:40:50] ever learning
[1:40:53] and never able
[1:40:55] to come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:40:59] I tell you when I read that it makes me
[1:41:01] thankful for the grace of God
[1:41:04] it makes me thankful for God's grace not
[1:41:06] just not just say Lord oh my all that
[1:41:09] he's shown us but yes all that he has
[1:41:10] shown about what he's done in her life
[1:41:12] to where the very desire of our life
[1:41:14] beats for him not just show up on a
[1:41:17] church service but our life is him and
[1:41:20] him alone
[1:41:21] notice brother Brown would say it like
[1:41:23] this here in another place in the
[1:41:25] message he said Cain's children became
[1:41:28] intellectual religious because their
[1:41:30] father was intellectual Cain religious
[1:41:33] and Cain built an altar Abel built on
[1:41:36] altar Cain made an offering Abel made an
[1:41:38] offering Cain worshiped Abel worshiped
[1:41:41] and if God only respects a church its
[1:41:46] order its worship its offerings and so
[1:41:49] forth if that's all God respects he was
[1:41:53] unjust for condemning Cain
[1:41:57] because he was just as religious as Abel
[1:42:03] was but he didn't come the right way
[1:42:08] so what Paul said if a man Strife he has
[1:42:10] to strive lawfully in order to be
[1:42:11] crowned right
[1:42:12] I mean you don't you don't get up and
[1:42:14] sign you know when we used to have field
[1:42:15] day back in when I was in elementary
[1:42:17] school that's where you signed up for
[1:42:18] all them races you know and things like
[1:42:19] that are carrying an egg on a teaspoon
[1:42:21] or you know the the potato sack race or
[1:42:25] whatever it was they called it you know
[1:42:26] all those things you know and you get
[1:42:27] them ribbons and you know the ribbons
[1:42:28] and make people feel good and everything
[1:42:30] else and here you got first place you
[1:42:31] were dead last but your first place in
[1:42:33] my mind and all those things you know
[1:42:35] that goes along just like that but
[1:42:36] notice if you were running that race you
[1:42:38] could not just cut across the track and
[1:42:40] come to the finish line and say hey I
[1:42:43] made first place you're disqualified
[1:42:46] and unless you come God's provided way
[1:42:49] you'll be disqualified at the end
[1:42:51] Nathaniel would god really do that yes
[1:42:54] he said he'll do that to even people who
[1:42:56] preach in His Name Lord did I not cast
[1:42:59] out Devils did we not preach in your
[1:43:02] name didn't I do this yes but depart
[1:43:05] from me you workers of iniquity I never
[1:43:08] even knew you
[1:43:13] oh dear God
[1:43:18] let me close here
[1:43:23] you're in the message I'm going to see
[1:43:25] what message power transformation
[1:43:27] Cain was such a person religious indeed
[1:43:31] but it had the wrong seed in him see
[1:43:33] therefore it brought forth the serpent
[1:43:35] seed Satan had hissed over this seed of
[1:43:38] Eden and that's what brought forth a
[1:43:40] cane he put his poison upon how many
[1:43:42] know the scripture tells us that Cain
[1:43:45] in the Book of John was of that Wicked
[1:43:47] one
[1:43:48] Adam wasn't Wicked
[1:43:50] in the book of Jude it says Enoch VII
[1:43:53] from Adam
[1:43:55] Enoch couldn't have been the seventh if
[1:43:57] Cain was from Adam he would have been
[1:43:59] the eighth
[1:44:01] right notice Cain knew listen to this
[1:44:05] now Caine knew the perfect will of God
[1:44:08] he knew the perfect will of God Cain
[1:44:11] knew it
[1:44:12] but he refused to do it
[1:44:15] he proved then to be the serpent seat
[1:44:17] when he seen the perfect will of God he
[1:44:20] refused it he had seen God vindicate
[1:44:23] Abel's message he noted it was the will
[1:44:25] of God he's seen God vindicate Abel's
[1:44:27] message and what did God say to him
[1:44:30] he said do the same do worship like your
[1:44:33] brother and you'll do well you think
[1:44:36] about this it would not have changed
[1:44:38] Cain of who he was but Cain God's not
[1:44:41] asking to be a per impersonator but Cain
[1:44:43] if you don't understand it you know I
[1:44:46] have Vindicated it because you have been
[1:44:49] upset that I didn't vindicate yours
[1:44:51] but if you will do as Abel is doing
[1:44:54] though you may not understand it
[1:44:57] I still accept you
[1:45:00] sure oh God think about it what an
[1:45:03] opportunity God wasn't playing around
[1:45:05] with Cain he would have accepted him
[1:45:09] but Cain was unable to Humble himself
[1:45:13] as a matter of fact Cain's attitude was
[1:45:15] you either take what I bring you
[1:45:18] or forget it
[1:45:24] I think about brother Bram tells us in
[1:45:26] the church age book he said we never
[1:45:27] even see this type of interaction
[1:45:29] between Satan and God himself
[1:45:31] yeah that's good he said here Cain
[1:45:34] withstood God in a way we've never seen
[1:45:36] before
[1:45:40] but you see he's seen the perfect will
[1:45:42] of God but he didn't want to do it he
[1:45:44] wanted to add something to it and these
[1:45:46] theologians see this Bible let me tell
[1:45:48] you something friends this message has
[1:45:49] not been done in a corner
[1:45:52] as a matter of fact many of them you
[1:45:53] watch some of the phrases and
[1:45:55] terminologies and things they have let
[1:45:56] me tell you something Billy Graham had
[1:45:58] every one of these messages in his study
[1:46:00] Billy Graham wasn't was a messenger we
[1:46:02] understand that by the scripture a
[1:46:03] messenger to that church right
[1:46:05] same way Oral Roberts was to the
[1:46:07] Pentecostals brother Ram called him
[1:46:09] messages of God's mercy but he said
[1:46:11] we've got a different message we've got
[1:46:13] a message where there was one who stayed
[1:46:15] back with Abraham while the two angels
[1:46:17] went down to Sodom right
[1:46:19] we have received a message of rapturing
[1:46:22] Grace a message that will bring Christ
[1:46:24] preeminent not just before our Pandora
[1:46:27] but inside our teenage
[1:46:30] the same God who speaks to us will
[1:46:33] return and visit according to what he
[1:46:35] has said over our lives
[1:46:37] yeah you will
[1:46:39] think of this it's not been done in a
[1:46:41] corner this is known
[1:46:45] but see it's been Vindicated men have
[1:46:48] witnessed this word
[1:46:51] they have witnessed God showing up even
[1:46:54] so much look at these statements T
[1:46:56] Osborne said we had forgot
[1:46:58] what we had forgotten what Jesus was
[1:47:01] like but God made himself known once
[1:47:04] again in this generation
[1:47:06] not the flesh but the same Jesus
[1:47:10] revealing himself to be the mighty
[1:47:12] conqueror night after night after night
[1:47:15] not just in signs and wonders but also
[1:47:19] when we're revealing of his word
[1:47:25] this ministry friends I just have to say
[1:47:27] it this ministry was not of I think
[1:47:29] somebody out there has got a headache
[1:47:31] duh who doesn't
[1:47:33] I don't mean to be make a lot of
[1:47:34] anything but this was not a hit and miss
[1:47:37] let me tell you something what it was
[1:47:39] about was that you and I that we might
[1:47:41] recognize who it is that's in our midst
[1:47:44] there were many people that were
[1:47:46] enthrilled with the Miracles with the
[1:47:49] signs and wonders so much so they wanted
[1:47:51] brother Branham to come but they had
[1:47:53] made a request if you'll just compromise
[1:47:56] on your Doctrine don't go to preaching
[1:47:58] this you don't have to preach this they
[1:48:00] were not concerned with the word
[1:48:02] whatsoever they wanted vicious and loads
[1:48:06] right yeah they were willing to Humble
[1:48:08] themselves to invite him in for that of
[1:48:11] a healing meeting but aren't you glad
[1:48:14] that there came a healing that was
[1:48:16] greater than just the healing of our
[1:48:17] bodies
[1:48:18] the son of righteousness the same Holy
[1:48:22] Ghost has arose in the evening time with
[1:48:25] healing in his wings
[1:48:27] to bring healing
[1:48:30] in the lives of his people
[1:48:33] let me try to finish this he says
[1:48:34] theologians see this Bible they read it
[1:48:36] they don't know what to do it shows the
[1:48:38] serpent seed they have seen the
[1:48:39] Vindicated so simply before the people
[1:48:41] but it seems like it's so hard for
[1:48:44] people to Humble themselves to the word
[1:48:46] of God then he says don't you all find
[1:48:48] when you're talking you women talking to
[1:48:50] the sisters don't you find it when
[1:48:52] you're talking to girls about wearing
[1:48:53] long hair and they say why you got long
[1:48:55] hair why your hair long why do you wear
[1:48:58] your skirts down long like that why do
[1:49:00] you go to talking to them they kind of
[1:49:02] give you the shoulder oh brother Samuel
[1:49:04] that's because our church does it that's
[1:49:05] not why it's the word of God
[1:49:08] God permits me in coming Services we'll
[1:49:11] just dive into that it's God's word
[1:49:14] amen that's why when people want to walk
[1:49:16] away from the message remember the first
[1:49:18] things they do is they want to take off
[1:49:20] the skirts and put on the britches they
[1:49:22] want to cut their hair listen god
[1:49:24] brother Branham never came up with
[1:49:25] Holiness that was already in the word
[1:49:28] the church fell from it
[1:49:31] well I think they look good that way
[1:49:33] that's because you are unconverted and
[1:49:35] you need a conversion in your own heart
[1:49:37] and let God take that lust spirit away
[1:49:39] from that
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:45] what bank puts their gold out on display
[1:49:49] tell me when you're going for a loan did
[1:49:52] you see their gold
[1:49:53] do you see it no you don't see it but
[1:49:55] you borrow based on not the dollars
[1:49:58] you borrow dollars are made off of gold
[1:50:01] but you never see the gold
[1:50:05] that's the same way that God expects in
[1:50:08] our bodies
[1:50:09] that's why there's a covering that's
[1:50:11] given that's why God's laid it out in
[1:50:13] his word it's a spirit friends
[1:50:16] notice this don't he says don't you see
[1:50:18] he says they say they know it's right if
[1:50:21] there's any lady in them they know
[1:50:24] that's right but you see they can't
[1:50:26] humble themselves to it that's see
[1:50:28] that's what Cain did he couldn't humble
[1:50:30] himself to the Vindicated word of God he
[1:50:32] couldn't do it now watch this even the
[1:50:35] Pentecostals will say glory to God
[1:50:37] hallelujah I cut my hair and speak in
[1:50:40] tongues that shows right there
[1:50:42] something's wrong the seed is bringing
[1:50:44] forth something different
[1:50:47] it doesn't matter how much anointing how
[1:50:50] much spirit I don't care if they speak
[1:50:51] in tongues and they hit it on the dot
[1:50:53] every single time if it is against the
[1:50:56] word in their life it's false
[1:50:59] what is spoken out that what is spoken
[1:51:01] out that's no Marvel Balaam himself fell
[1:51:03] into that and what Balaam said what came
[1:51:06] out was truth is that right but look at
[1:51:08] balaam's life it was not a life that was
[1:51:10] lined up with the word aren't you
[1:51:12] grateful for the grace of God in this
[1:51:14] hour because it has been promised false
[1:51:17] Christ would come in this end time that
[1:51:20] means false anointed not people walking
[1:51:22] around with Palestinian garbs on and
[1:51:25] with you know putting nail prints in
[1:51:26] their hands but men men those that would
[1:51:28] be Anointed with the same Spirit but
[1:51:31] would lead you away from the word
[1:51:33] aren't you grateful for God's grace in
[1:51:35] this hour you know what that is God
[1:51:37] keeping his grace keeping his word his
[1:51:40] mighty hand to you and I
[1:51:43] am oh brother REM said a seed cannot a
[1:51:46] seed of God cannot bring forth a
[1:51:47] bald-haired woman it can't do it not
[1:51:49] just can't do it because the Bible said
[1:51:50] so it can't do it oh he said it seems so
[1:51:53] hard
[1:51:54] to Humble to God's word
[1:51:57] I just say it in this way if there's one
[1:51:59] thing we can
[1:52:01] friends to be thankful for
[1:52:03] is to have a desire
[1:52:06] that desires to please God
[1:52:10] if you've got a desire in your heart
[1:52:11] that desires to please God
[1:52:13] and say Lord
[1:52:15] I just want to serve you with all of my
[1:52:18] heart
[1:52:20] I want to walk in full obedience to your
[1:52:22] word
[1:52:24] just humbling in his presence
[1:52:28] God doesn't expect you and I to know
[1:52:30] everything but this is his request will
[1:52:32] you humble yourself
[1:52:34] in my presence
[1:52:37] I want you to remember I'm close I'll
[1:52:38] close on this on this point
[1:52:41] there was a man in the scriptures
[1:52:43] by the name of Naaman how many remember
[1:52:45] Naaman
[1:52:47] he was a general there in Syria
[1:52:49] Mighty Man of Valor the scripture says
[1:52:53] but
[1:52:54] he had a secret
[1:52:56] that nobody else knew
[1:52:58] but the little Maiden that had been
[1:53:00] carried captive from Israel she knew
[1:53:03] he was a leper
[1:53:06] and you can only keep that secret so
[1:53:08] long
[1:53:09] because leprosy will spread
[1:53:12] and leprosy is sin
[1:53:14] it'll keep going
[1:53:19] so the maiden told him said hey
[1:53:21] go down to Israel
[1:53:23] there's a prophet down there and that
[1:53:25] required a lot of humility because he he
[1:53:27] had been whipping Israel God had
[1:53:29] delivered Israel into syrian's hand in
[1:53:31] Syria's hand because Israel was walking
[1:53:33] in Disobedience Israel wasn't humbling
[1:53:36] themselves and God speaks to this man
[1:53:38] and says there's a prophet down here
[1:53:41] now this man in Syria has a lot of Gods
[1:53:43] but go down here here's a there's a
[1:53:45] prophet he comes down to the king the
[1:53:48] king looks at it can you imagine the
[1:53:50] king the king looks at himself like why
[1:53:51] in the world can I help you
[1:53:53] you know I'm paraphrasing the scripture
[1:53:55] said the king rent his clothes and said
[1:53:56] what am I to do my God
[1:54:00] Elisha heard about it and Elisha aren't
[1:54:03] you glad Elisha heard
[1:54:05] how did Elisha here I don't know the
[1:54:07] scripture don't say that
[1:54:09] it did it have to be that a messenger
[1:54:11] ran out of the king's court didn't have
[1:54:13] to be because remember God had already
[1:54:15] been shown Elisha before where the
[1:54:17] Syrian Army was going to be you meet him
[1:54:19] right here you'll whip him right
[1:54:22] however it got there and Elisha sent
[1:54:24] word up there said hey hey tell him to
[1:54:26] come down here
[1:54:28] come to come down here
[1:54:30] so he comes down
[1:54:32] right there and I wonder how Naaman felt
[1:54:34] Naaman if I thought here he comes he
[1:54:36] comes down
[1:54:38] and Elisha knows he's getting close
[1:54:40] Elisha sin's word out he don't even go
[1:54:43] out to greet him
[1:54:44] he just sends word out
[1:54:47] he said tell him to go down to Jordan
[1:54:49] and dip seven times
[1:54:52] and he will be every wit made whole
[1:54:58] and name it God well he's Disturbed
[1:55:01] I am Naaman
[1:55:04] he didn't even come out this is what the
[1:55:07] scripture said I thought he would at
[1:55:09] least come out you see sometimes our
[1:55:11] thoughts can get in the way
[1:55:14] of humility
[1:55:16] because it ain't coming the way that we
[1:55:19] think it ought to come
[1:55:20] I think it should come this way I think
[1:55:23] I should feel this I think I
[1:55:26] just humble yourselves under the mighty
[1:55:29] hand of God
[1:55:30] knows what he's doing
[1:55:33] this guy got mad I'll tell you you
[1:55:36] talking about Grace he got mad the Bible
[1:55:38] said he was mad
[1:55:40] and one of his servants real small guy
[1:55:44] may not been a short guy but he's a
[1:55:46] small guy
[1:55:47] because he was a servant
[1:55:49] it don't don't even know his name but he
[1:55:52] had some words of wisdom see it took
[1:55:53] something very small to speak to
[1:55:55] somebody who was being very big and said
[1:55:57] hey wait a minute
[1:55:58] if he asked you to do something real
[1:56:01] great
[1:56:02] Naaman said but what about these other
[1:56:04] rivers I mean I can go over to this
[1:56:06] River I can go over the Baptist River I
[1:56:08] can go to the Pentecostal River I can go
[1:56:10] to the Methodist River
[1:56:13] come on God's gave you all those other
[1:56:15] gates to tempt you
[1:56:18] is that what it said in the book of
[1:56:19] Deuteronomy gave all them other gates to
[1:56:22] tempt you
[1:56:23] but there's one gate
[1:56:25] where he's chose to place his name
[1:56:27] there's one place God placed his name in
[1:56:30] Christ his life is that right he placed
[1:56:33] it in his word
[1:56:35] Naaman said no
[1:56:38] that little guy I don't know
[1:56:42] friends tell me they didn't have one the
[1:56:43] courage of God for that servant to speak
[1:56:45] up to his master
[1:56:47] it was God
[1:56:50] aren't you glad that God has servants
[1:56:51] aren't you glad that God
[1:56:53] speaks to us when we get on our high
[1:56:56] horses about things
[1:56:58] God will speak to us and say hey wait a
[1:57:00] minute
[1:57:03] he said hey if he asked you to do some
[1:57:05] great big thing you'd have done it
[1:57:08] all he told you to do he said go down
[1:57:09] there and dip in the Jordan seven times
[1:57:11] you'd be you'd be whole what you're
[1:57:13] fussing about
[1:57:15] Naaman goes down there
[1:57:18] I don't know if that's a new Kentucky
[1:57:19] translation or what but he's going down
[1:57:21] there to the Jordan and just just dip
[1:57:23] dip into dip in the water right there he
[1:57:26] went down there and he dipped into
[1:57:27] Jordan I wonder when he got up next to
[1:57:30] it squishy mug
[1:57:35] dirty water I can't even this ain't like
[1:57:38] the Bahamas today I can't see my toes
[1:57:41] you know what it didn't look real
[1:57:43] appealing
[1:57:45] and the new birth itself
[1:57:47] is not something that's pretty
[1:57:50] it's a death and a dying to self
[1:57:55] you know where you know the reason he
[1:57:57] ended up in that water is because the
[1:57:59] first of all he was willing to receive a
[1:58:01] word
[1:58:03] and forsake his thoughts
[1:58:05] his way
[1:58:07] and submit to the word of God
[1:58:10] and he dipped seven times and he came
[1:58:12] out of there completely
[1:58:16] why because he humbled himself
[1:58:21] to the mighty hand of God
[1:58:23] and God exalted God brought forth
[1:58:27] a life that was clean a life that was
[1:58:29] free
[1:58:30] a life
[1:58:32] that was full
[1:58:34] healthy once again
[1:58:37] grace to the humble
[1:58:39] I want more grace
[1:58:41] I want more grace
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:44] I believe there's Grace here this
[1:58:46] morning whatever your need is
[1:58:49] I believe that I know there's Grace here
[1:58:50] this morning whatever your need is maybe
[1:58:52] it's a habit maybe it's something a
[1:58:54] besetting sin
[1:58:55] there's Grace here this morning
[1:58:58] if you're willing to Humble yourselves
[1:59:00] under the mighty hand of God
[1:59:02] there's Grace to set the captive free
[1:59:05] there's Grace
[1:59:09] that's able to bring Liberty
[1:59:12] to hearts that are bound
[1:59:13] there's grace to the humble what do I do
[1:59:16] just humble yourself don't try to figure
[1:59:17] it out
[1:59:18] just give yourself to him surrender your
[1:59:21] heart to him
[1:59:22] Surrender Your Life to him
[1:59:25] oh brother Samuel what about this don't
[1:59:27] worry don't don't let Satan Satan you
[1:59:29] you're not going to get in this door
[1:59:30] you're not going to use my door Pride
[1:59:31] not gonna do it I'm not gonna do it I
[1:59:34] want to walk with the Lord
[1:59:36] I want to walk with him
[1:59:38] hey man let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:59:40] Prayer
[1:59:52] I wonder here this morning how many want
[1:59:54] to be remembered in prayer
[1:59:57] but there's in your heart in your life
[1:59:58] God bless you God bless your hands
[2:00:02] lives may be a life that
[2:00:06] it's at a place right now maybe you're
[2:00:07] at a junction you're at a point you're
[2:00:09] at a place
[2:00:10] you need God to move you you need a
[2:00:12] miracle
[2:00:14] you need God to move in a special way
[2:00:16] let me tell you something God still
[2:00:17] Specializes
[2:00:19] in freeing the captives
[2:00:23] God Specializes in Healing The Sick
[2:00:26] God Specializes in filling his children
[2:00:29] with his life
[2:00:33] don't let Satan put off at everything
[2:00:35] all it's everything in your life has
[2:00:36] been failures remember everything that
[2:00:39] we try to do it does in our own selves
[2:00:41] and we rely upon that that is a failure
[2:00:44] and God allows it to come to that place
[2:00:45] not to disappoint us but to cause us to
[2:00:48] come to a spot to look up
[2:00:50] and realize I need something more
[2:00:54] I need I need I need him
[2:00:57] maybe all you've known is religion
[2:01:00] all you've known is churches
[2:01:02] but I'm going to ask you this morning
[2:01:03] have you ever met him
[2:01:06] this I mean I've worshiped
[2:01:08] I've made an altar
[2:01:11] I've come to church but I'm asking you
[2:01:13] have you ever met him
[2:01:15] I shook hands with a preacher that's not
[2:01:16] what I'm asking you Cain did all of that
[2:01:19] but have you met him do you know him in
[2:01:23] the power of his resurrection
[2:01:25] have you repented of your sins
[2:01:28] have you been baptized in the name of
[2:01:30] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:01:32] of your sins
[2:01:34] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:01:37] you have believed
[2:01:41] oh I tell you
[2:01:43] his grace is sufficient
[2:01:45] it's grace to the humble
[2:01:47] but he did say he'd resist the proud
[2:01:51] I'd say right here this morning there
[2:01:53] wasn't what an opportunity that God has
[2:01:55] moved right down
[2:01:58] to our doorstep once again
[2:02:00] let's not let this moment go by
[2:02:04] let's not let this moment go by
[2:02:07] let's Let The Mighty God take a hold
[2:02:09] whatever your need is whatever the
[2:02:12] situation friends were here
[2:02:14] we've come to have a meeting with God
[2:02:17] God knows God can take the things like
[2:02:19] brother Joshua Joshua he testified here
[2:02:21] this morning even things in your life
[2:02:23] circumstances
[2:02:25] that maybe have taken the wind out of
[2:02:27] yourselves
[2:02:29] but there's a God
[2:02:30] I want you to know he cares for you
[2:02:33] he's mindful of you
[2:02:35] why don't you just cast your cares on
[2:02:37] him you know you know he made a way
[2:02:39] through Calvary that you could actually
[2:02:41] care
[2:02:42] he made a way that you could care
[2:02:45] what do you mean to care brother Samuel
[2:02:47] to where your heart is moved to say Lord
[2:02:49] I need you
[2:02:51] I want you Lord
[2:02:53] he made a way through Calvary that you
[2:02:56] could care
[2:02:58] otherwise
[2:02:59] you wouldn't care
[2:03:02] it's Grace
[2:03:04] to the humble
[2:03:05] I say this morning
[2:03:08] I not only have received that Grace but
[2:03:10] I want more and if I could say it the
[2:03:12] right way
[2:03:13] it was his grace that allowed me to
[2:03:15] receive that Grace
[2:03:17] that's what it was
[2:03:19] if I could say it even in this measure
[2:03:21] it was his grace that received me
[2:03:25] I was like that one you were like that
[2:03:28] one the prodigal
[2:03:30] was in a pig pen
[2:03:31] a shameful condition
[2:03:34] if I could just get back home to my
[2:03:36] father's house
[2:03:39] something had changed
[2:03:42] it was no longer a proud proud young man
[2:03:47] that he had become a humble young man
[2:03:49] that was willing whatever it takes to
[2:03:53] get back to Father's house how about it
[2:03:56] this morning
[2:03:56] whatever it takes to get back to the
[2:03:59] Lord Jesus
[2:04:01] whatever it takes to get back home
[2:04:05] and he made his way back home
[2:04:08] the father met him
[2:04:10] he met him
[2:04:11] welcomed him back
[2:04:13] that's the same Grace right here
[2:04:16] that comes to receive you
[2:04:19] to take control
[2:04:21] of your life of your heart
[2:04:23] to do for you what you can't do
[2:04:26] no program can change your life no book
[2:04:29] can change your life only Jesus Christ
[2:04:33] can change your life
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:41] as our heads are bowed and our eyes are
[2:04:43] Clovis would there be one that want to
[2:04:45] accept the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:47] as your savior
[2:04:52] and God bless you
[2:04:54] one that would want to make him say Lord
[2:04:57] forgive me of my sins I want to accept
[2:05:00] you as my savior
[2:05:03] I want to receive that pardon
[2:05:05] right here this morning
[2:05:09] Hallelujah

[2:24:54] and we will use
[2:25:08] [Music]
[2:25:12] tell you of our love just listen to our
[2:25:19] hearts I want you to think of this
[2:25:24] how many members in that cybernetian
[2:25:25] woman she came
[2:25:27] and she came and she said thou
[2:25:30] son of David have mercy on me
[2:25:33] he wants son of David to her
[2:25:35] he said I'm not even sent to you
[2:25:39] you're you're your nation is nothing but
[2:25:41] dogs
[2:25:43] she said that's the truth
[2:25:46] but she said Master she said but the
[2:25:48] dogs they take the crumbs from the
[2:25:50] master's table
[2:25:52] she humbled herself
[2:25:55] underneath the word
[2:25:58] and he said for this saying
[2:26:03] that which was upon your daughter has
[2:26:06] left
[2:26:07] for this sake
[2:26:12] brother Brown goes on to say he says
[2:26:14] whether your healing comes like this or
[2:26:17] it's gradual
[2:26:19] it's on its way
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:24] it's on its way we're going to worship
[2:26:30] [Music]
[2:26:31] that's a time of humbling ourselves
[2:26:33] we're not looking for a feeling we're
[2:26:36] not looking for a sensation we're
[2:26:39] looking for the evidence
[2:26:42] and the evidence of God is indisputable
[2:26:46] you might feel it there might be
[2:26:48] sensation but there might not
[2:26:50] but I guarantee probably some way or
[2:26:52] another when you do see it you'll be a
[2:26:54] little happy
[2:26:55] you'll be a little thankful people know
[2:26:56] about it the main thing is what it is
[2:26:58] you'll be rejoicing about something you
[2:27:00] know that's sure
[2:27:01] so what do I do I would worship and I
[2:27:04] would thank God I would receive what God
[2:27:06] has for me foreign
[2:27:10] Lord I'll take crumbs if that's what it
[2:27:12] is
[2:27:13] brother Brown said we got any Chrome
[2:27:14] takers I'll be a chrome taker
[2:27:17] not in this hour brother Samuel we got
[2:27:19] the whole loaf no no I don't want any
[2:27:21] Pride Lord I'll take crumbs
[2:27:23] because crumbs come off the same loaf
[2:27:26] Crumbs are they shall lay hands on the
[2:27:28] sick and they shall recover didn't say
[2:27:32] how long but he said they shall recover
[2:27:34] I'll take the crumbs Lord while the rest
[2:27:37] of the world said I don't want crumbs I
[2:27:39] want a piece I want a loaf I'll take a
[2:27:41] chrome
[2:27:42] I'll take a clump
