[22:04] nobody else like you know
[22:07] [Music]
[22:12] you are there is no one else like there
[22:28] is no a man well that ain't nothing but
[22:42] the truth
[22:44] you know before you look to you about a
[22:46] lot of things they said wow this is just
[22:48] something how this took place a lot of
[22:50] miracles but there's one miracle that
[22:52] once you experience that then the whole
[22:54] whole paradox the whole reality opens up
[22:58] of the Lord and that's that miracle of
[23:00] the new birth amen and it's a paradox
[23:03] how Christ how he's drawn us to himself
[23:05] to even think that where we would have a
[23:08] desire it's because he gave and placed
[23:10] that desire within us and so then moving
[23:13] him moving upon that to draw us and open
[23:16] up to us the way that we can come that
[23:19] the desire that he placed in our life
[23:21] might come to a fulfillment in him
[23:23] there's no other place that we could
[23:26] ever be fulfilled because there's
[23:27] nothing that could fulfill and match
[23:29] that desire outside of the place that it
[23:32] was ordained for and that was in Christ
[23:35] you know how it is with a plan you go to
[23:37] ask him about a plant and they'll ask
[23:39] you how much Sun you get you get when
[23:41] when's your Sun come up is it a 2 to 6
[23:43] hours 2 to 4 hours they want to know how
[23:45] much light because if they give you a
[23:46] plant that needs more light it's going
[23:49] to die there because it doesn't get
[23:51] sufficient light so vice versa but I'm
[23:54] thankful to God we can testify from our
[23:57] lives we were not made for just one or
[23:58] two hours of light we were made for the
[24:02] light amen and our lives our strength
[24:06] everything about our life it comes from
[24:09] him who is the light God is light and in
[24:13] him is no darkness oh my just reading in
[24:17] Isaiah chapter 30 and we were dealing
[24:19] with last week in there of how that it
[24:21] speaks of where that be son
[24:24] itself and the moon would actually give
[24:25] the show that scientists the strength of
[24:28] the Sun in its time it would actually
[24:30] shine in a Sevenfold manner to think in
[24:33] this hour that we're living in it's not
[24:35] just one lamp it's not just one light
[24:37] but it is all of that light that has
[24:39] come together to show us in this hour
[24:42] make known to us no wonder the scripture
[24:45] could say
[24:45] rise and shine for thy light has come
[24:49] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[24:52] thee we're not just walking in a partial
[24:56] light we are walking in the fullness of
[24:57] the light in this hour when Christ
[25:00] Himself has as the completion and the
[25:02] finishing of his body once again the Son
[25:05] of man living in human flesh amen that's
[25:08] a reality in this hour for our lives
[25:10] it's a very precious day to be living in
[25:13] for the world oh my it's a it's a
[25:16] terrible day but it's a wonderful hour
[25:18] to be a Christian
[25:19] and if them today if that's not settled
[25:21] in your heart what a more perfect time
[25:24] than to have that settled in your life
[25:26] amen God is so mindful we want to just
[25:29] welcome brother Don and sister Loretta
[25:32] you're with us and sister sherry we
[25:35] appreciate them being here with us this
[25:36] morning
[25:38] amen and we certainly appreciate the
[25:42] liberty of the Holy Spirit we really
[25:44] appreciate the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[25:47] you know that's a great precious
[25:49] precious reality in this hour and we
[25:53] thank God for that and we just want to
[25:55] pull on the gift of God this morning
[25:56] what God has for us as we're asking when
[26:00] asked sister sherry she's gonna come and
[26:02] sing for us this morning
[26:04] as brother John would make his way on
[26:05] out while she's singing but I'd like to
[26:08] she's making her way on up I'd like to
[26:11] raise the lift the mission offering this
[26:13] morning and brother Steven tabali we
[26:16] remember we had taken a special offering
[26:18] back in January and we sent that into
[26:21] Uganda there
[26:23] and we're also as soon as I get back to
[26:27] reports and things from that brother Tim
[26:28] Dodd who is one that has actually been
[26:32] overseeing that a lot of the the
[26:36] distribution there I've I've had
[26:38] probably I just had another video pop on
[26:40] my phone here this morning where brother
[26:41] Tim Dodd is is ministering there two
[26:44] ministers have come out of the Baptist
[26:46] and their wives the Pentecostal and
[26:49] their wives and he's ministering to them
[26:52] in this time and you just see so many
[26:54] that that as the light has touched their
[26:57] lives they are just rejoicing in this
[27:00] light and matter of fact the video that
[27:01] brother Steven of Bali sent me this
[27:03] morning there's not even room to sit
[27:05] down people just kept coming there's no
[27:07] room they ran out of chairs so people
[27:09] are just and we're not just talking
[27:10] about a little building like this we're
[27:13] talking of a much larger place they just
[27:15] don't have room and so you know I know
[27:18] that you know God will bless in the
[27:22] efforts and though we may not ever see
[27:24] them but yet we know the purpose that we
[27:27] have a desire in our heart and that's
[27:28] that everyone itself would come to know
[27:31] the Lord Jesus Christ in the power of
[27:33] his resurrection that this message that
[27:35] God has sent us to it points us and
[27:38] brings us into that reality with the
[27:40] Lord Jesus Christ that's our desire for
[27:42] every heart every person we talked to
[27:44] that they would know the Lord Jesus in
[27:46] that way and we also want to continue to
[27:48] pray as we've also been channeling the
[27:51] funds continuously down there for the
[27:53] printing work in the and I don't mean to
[27:56] keep your brothers stand-in here over
[27:58] the work that's going on there printing
[28:00] over there in in Honduras and some
[28:03] things possibly I'll just speak at a at
[28:05] a different time because there's no more
[28:08] books themselves are no longer being
[28:10] printed by the voice of God but there's
[28:13] a need for books to continue to be
[28:15] printed and I can share that with you
[28:17] and we have a little bit more of a
[28:19] detail of time and how that that is such
[28:22] a need that has been expressed by
[28:23] pastors overseas and the Bari coffee has
[28:27] actually been inventoried that need and
[28:30] seeing that and thankfully there's some
[28:32] places where they've been able to
[28:33] contract
[28:35] and actually get it to where that there
[28:37] are books that they can have produced
[28:39] even in other places such as the seven
[28:41] church age book the seven seals which
[28:43] are massive books to print you can't
[28:44] print those off a printer like like the
[28:47] other books that we're dealing with
[28:48] right now you can print those books off
[28:49] of a printer but the other but some of
[28:52] the other ones they they just can't do
[28:54] that so they've contracted with a
[28:56] printer for other places overseas to do
[28:58] that and we'll just talk about that in a
[29:00] little bit later time when we have some
[29:02] more time but let's just let's just
[29:05] approach the Lord here in a word of
[29:06] Prayer
[29:07] Lord Jesus we just thank you for this
[29:10] wonderful day lore that you've given us
[29:12] nor though it is a day when we look
[29:15] outside it's it's awful gloomy but
[29:17] father we're speaking of the day that's

[42:46] as a little girl she's three years old
[42:51] she was born she's had probably
[42:54] I don't know four or five operations in
[42:56] the heart or stomach
[42:59] just all kinds of complications and the
[43:01] last thing was they
[43:02] they found that
[43:05] the blood that normally goes into the
[43:09] heart and the heart pumps it to the rest
[43:11] of the body was not working properly
[43:13] because the blood flow was going the
[43:16] opposite direction and
[43:21] so she
[43:23] she was thank you
[43:30] she was had to go back into the hospital
[43:32] because they had to do they had to hook
[43:36] her up to all these machines this this
[43:38] week and and while the machine was doing
[43:43] all of her you know rerouting her blood
[43:46] so that her body would function up early
[43:49] they cleaned up her heart and operated
[43:53] and so the flow would reverse itself and
[43:56] go the right direction it said
[44:01] I'll forget how many
[44:03] weeks four days I forget what it was she
[44:06] would be in the hospital and then
[44:07] recovery she's just been a miracle baby
[44:13] ever since she was born we've played
[44:14] different times for her and God has been
[44:17] gracious to her well Tuesday when I had
[44:21] eye surgery Monday on my left eye and
[44:24] for cataract surgery and I had to stay
[44:27] there and go back the next day to the VA
[44:29] so when we get out fall and I just five
[44:33] minutes away was the hospital where she
[44:34] had been was being operated on so we we
[44:38] drove over there and they were in the
[44:40] waiting room when she was in surgery at
[44:41] that time and so we had prayer with my
[44:44] with my nephew and his wife and her
[44:46] parents were there and we got to meet
[44:48] them and talk a while and had prayer and
[44:50] my sister came and we prayed we prayed

[47:49] verse 1 very familiar to us know this
[47:52] also of in the last days perilous times
[47:55] shall come how many believe we're living
[47:57] in the last days perilous times shall
[48:00] come
[48:01] for men shall be lovers of their own
[48:03] selves covetous boasters proud
[48:06] blasphemers disobedient appearance
[48:08] unthankful unholy without natural
[48:10] affection trucebreakers false accusers
[48:13] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[48:15] that are good traitors heady highminded
[48:18] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[48:20] god having a form of godliness but
[48:24] denying the power thereof from such
[48:32] Heavenly Father we want to thank you
[48:34] this morning for the opportunity to be
[48:37] in the house of God what an honour Lord

[48:59] just want you to speak to us today Lord
[49:02] just open our hearts dropped a little
[49:05] nugget in you'd have to be their God and
[49:06] touch our hearts God make them what they
[49:09] what they should be Lord and may every
[49:12] need be met this morning I pray in Jesus
[49:15] name Amen
[49:16] the church said god bless you you may be
[49:19] seated so I'd like to I'd like to speak
[49:25] on this this morning that the hour that
[49:28] we're living in the Bible said that
[49:29] though this also in last days perilous
[49:31] times shall come and I in the in the
[49:33] Greek died gallant that word perilous
[49:35] there is trying trying seasons i thought
[49:40] lord have mercy I think every one of us
[49:43] have been under trials and testings from
[49:45] time to time so I'd like to speak on the
[49:48] thought though of of you know I'll just
[49:50] title this it's a crazy world any
[49:57] complaints for the title
[50:03] what am I doing wrong guys Kinect can I
[50:05] turn my little mic off
[50:07] yeah be alright no no okay well just
[50:13] watch me because if I get loud I can't
[50:15] get so I subtitle this okay it's a crazy
[50:23] world is a title but I'll subtitle this
[50:25] how to live sanely in an insane world
[50:30] that'd be alright
[50:42] that's your mom
[50:45] your wife you treat her right
[50:48] everything good hello hey I'm talking to
[50:53] you that's better I think maybe we
[50:55] should move this one out of the way now
[50:56] with that move there he'll probably
[50:58] alright
[50:59] that's thank you sir every time I come
[51:02] here somebody has to come up here take
[51:06] care of me
[51:09] so
[51:11] let me get back to my thought because
[51:14] I told Sam I was only gonna be about an
[51:15] hour long and he said that cheery sing
[51:17] for 45 minutes and the preachers
[51:21] but you know what he thinks of my
[51:24] preaching doesn't it but I understood
[51:26] that because I like everything and and I
[51:29] and I like to be short I really do but
[51:31] when all those years I didn't learned
[51:34] that and I should have learned it but
[51:37] now I'm
[51:40] Oh be what should have done on the years
[51:44] quickly the thought
[51:48] how to become how to live scene lien and
[51:51] then in same order we know that it's no
[51:58] floow2 us or no surprise to us that
[52:01] people are going insane there it used to
[52:05] be some kind of common sense some kind
[52:09] of normalcy about about life and about
[52:12] people and the way they think you know
[52:15] there used to be normal thinking people
[52:17] on the earth that that rational and they
[52:20] made proper decisions and they they had
[52:23] respect for others didn't matter who
[52:26] they were they respected each other and
[52:28] they you know you didn't have to lock
[52:30] your doors you didn't have to do all
[52:31] these kind of things but you better not
[52:33] do that now because it's a crazy world
[52:36] you know what's on there but but you
[52:37] know anymore it's just I want it as it
[52:42] goes by week after week and month after
[52:44] month and I just think Lord when is it
[52:46] ever gonna end and then I think of that
[52:49] scripture that it lays there in the
[52:51] scriptures has said they'll pray even so
[52:54] come quickly Lord Jesus and I've often
[52:57] pondered on that Scripture I want to
[52:58] help what would make us pray come
[53:00] quickly Lord Jesus do you know what if
[53:03] it gets any worse I don't know I don't
[53:06] think I want to be around that long I
[53:07] really don't I I don't think I want to
[53:10] stand again a crazy
[53:12] the house world that he it is it's
[53:16] getting worse all the time
[53:17] listen to what the other band said in a
[53:20] message called Christ is identified this
[53:22] is the first slide
[53:24] the same in all generations 1964 he said
[53:28] but the Bible said it'd be that way and
[53:32] even even to men it's just their their
[53:35] their changed see it's going to get
[53:38] worse in another if the world would
[53:41] stand another 50 years the whole world
[53:45] would be totally insane you know how
[53:50] many years ago he said that 55 years ago
[53:56] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[54:00] hey man look at this sanity he says I'm
[54:03] finishing the quote from 40 from 20
[54:06] years ago till this time see and then
[54:10] another another quote here from from God
[54:12] provided place of worship 1965 he said
[54:15] look at all the televisions the things
[54:17] getting getting these fictitious things
[54:19] in order
[54:21] it'll-it'll come a time I predict that
[54:24] people will be completely totally insane
[54:28] the world will be and and I've got to
[54:33] say in my little time on earth it has
[54:36] evolved so far down the road I'm amazed
[54:40] at what I hear our leaders our
[54:45] politicians that are supposed to be
[54:48] standing for our our country and our
[54:50] people and insane things that are being
[54:54] said and adopted and forced upon us and
[55:01] I wonder Lord Corsa go ahead it's crazy
[55:06] see he said look at all the televisions
[55:09] and things getting getting these
[55:10] fictitious things in order to become a
[55:13] time I predict the people will be
[55:15] completely totally insane the world will
[55:16] be the Bible speaks of such hideous
[55:18] sights as they show in movies today and
[55:22] some prehistoric creatures eggs that
[55:24] lived in the earth so many thousands or
[55:26] millions of years ago hatched and come
[55:28] forth that that's that's just a minor
[55:32] thing
[55:34] all those horror movies and thing you
[55:37] see in hideous sites you see that's just
[55:40] a minor thing to what's coming or
[55:45] locusts with hair like women and teeth
[55:48] like lions why the world will be
[55:50] completely totally insane it's not just
[55:53] about about one degree from it now show
[55:55] that show that that's slide I got this
[55:58] off the internet it's not real good but
[56:00] this is kind of what he's looking at
[56:02] it'll have it'll have locusts are we're
[56:05] not showing slides that I've missed the
[56:06] slides on to our side you haven't seen
[56:08] you slides yet okay oh we don't it's
[56:12] under image images
[56:15] okay don't worry about that here we go
[56:21] they're like women teeth like lions face
[56:24] like a man tailed it stings like a
[56:26] scorpion I got it all she had brought
[56:29] just in case no I did that's not it's
[56:33] not about but when he talks about these
[56:35] things here now he's mentioning all
[56:37] these things here in this these these
[56:39] come from from the book of revelations
[56:41] chapter 9 if you want to turn there will
[56:43] go to revelations chapter 9 I just read
[56:45] a little bit and let me just preface
[56:47] this by saying this let me just say this
[56:49] you don't want to be here with his hands
[56:56] you do not want to be on planet earth
[56:58] when this happens
[57:04] all right revelations chapter 9 verse 1
[57:08] and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a
[57:11] star fall from heaven unto the earth and
[57:14] to him was given the key of the
[57:17] bottomless pit
[57:18] it's Lucifer that Satan and he opened
[57:21] the bottomless pit and there arose a
[57:24] smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a
[57:27] great furnace and the Sun in the air
[57:28] were darkened by the reason of the smoke
[57:30] of the pit and their name out of the
[57:32] smoke locusts upon the earth and unto
[57:35] them was given power as a scorpion of
[57:38] the earth have power and it was
[57:41] commanded them that they should not hurt
[57:43] the grass of the earth neither the green
[57:45] thing neither any tree but only those
[57:49] men that have not the seal of God in the
[57:53] forth
[57:59] only those men they have not the Holy
[58:02] Ghost the seal of God in their forehead
[58:07] and to them it was given that they
[58:09] should not kill them but that they
[58:11] should be tormented 5 months and their
[58:14] torment was as a torment of a scorpion
[58:16] that he when he strike as a man and in
[58:19] those days shall meet a crown of gold
[58:21] and their faces were faces of men and
[58:23] they had hair like women and teeth like
[58:26] teeth like lions and and they had
[58:28] breastplates and they were and the
[58:30] breast plates of iron in his sound of
[58:32] their wings would make the sound of
[58:33] chariots of many horses running to
[58:35] battle and they they had a tail like a
[58:39] scorpion and they were stings in their
[58:41] tails and their power was to hurt men
[58:44] for five months and he had a king in him
[58:50] they had a king over them
[58:53] the angel of the bottomless pit whose
[58:55] name in the Hebrew tongue was Abaddon
[58:59] but in the Greek tongue hath a name
[59:01] apollon listen church listen to me one
[59:05] more time you don't want to be here
[59:08] whatever it takes you don't want to be
[59:10] here then you need to get serious about
[59:12] your walk with God you need to get
[59:14] serious about your life and make sure
[59:17] your heart is surrendered to him these
[59:20] things are real and they're coming and
[59:21] the movies are preparing the mindset of
[59:23] the children to see these things as they
[59:26] look upon them there it's pretty dark
[59:28] but I'm sorry you know give you the best
[59:32] but that's but look what they see in
[59:34] movies and they call them you know
[59:39] they're for kids pg-13 oh that one's got
[59:44] to be okay they're preparing their minds
[59:48] because they're gonna get in this
[59:49] fictitious world when these things are
[59:51] coming and they're gonna wonder is this
[59:52] a when they put those goggles on will
[59:55] they call that thing and they what do
[59:57] they call that
[59:59] yeah reality right they won't know if
[1:00:03] they're dreaming they won't know if
[1:00:05] they're if this is real is this a movie
[1:00:07] what's going on but it won't be no movie
[1:00:13] they're gonna feel the sting they tell
[1:00:16] me I've never got stung by a scorpion
[1:00:18] but I've come close they tell me that's
[1:00:21] worse than a snake bite sometimes the
[1:00:23] poison and what it does and how it hurts
[1:00:25] how it follows up like that
[1:00:29] so we got a watch now you can see by
[1:00:33] these quotes the Prophet predicted that
[1:00:35] these things would come in these last
[1:00:37] days in church we are here we're living
[1:00:40] in a world that has gone totally insane
[1:00:45] decisions that are being made
[1:00:48] you look at abortion how it started it
[1:00:53] used to be years many years ago I can
[1:00:55] remember when when a mother's life was
[1:00:58] in danger then the decision could be
[1:01:01] made they they would it would take the
[1:01:03] baby and save the mother
[1:01:06] and and then they've decided well you
[1:01:09] know in extreme cases of a woman being
[1:01:15] raped or something like that and in Roe
[1:01:17] vs. Wade came in which was the abortion
[1:01:20] law to legalized abortions and the
[1:01:23] woman's choice then whether she wanted
[1:01:25] to keep a baby or not keep a baby and
[1:01:28] then and then partial birth abortion
[1:01:30] came in and then if you saw the news
[1:01:34] back of two or three months ago the
[1:01:36] governor of Virginia they declared a law
[1:01:39] there brought a law into into reality
[1:01:42] there that if a mother had the baby then
[1:01:46] this law would permit them to keep the
[1:01:50] baby comfortable this is a baby now a
[1:01:53] life not partial not not pre this is
[1:01:58] this has evolved into this place that if
[1:02:02] this child is born they make the baby
[1:02:04] comfortable until the doctor and the the
[1:02:07] woman can the mother can have a
[1:02:09] conversation or whether or not she wants
[1:02:11] to keep
[1:02:13] I'm serious that's not abortion that's
[1:02:18] murder and it's been all the way along
[1:02:21] they just have made us see it but I want
[1:02:24] you to know that's not this isn't the
[1:02:25] age of of where this all came from you
[1:02:28] go all the way back to Exodus chapter 3
[1:02:30] and you find where Pharaoh told the
[1:02:33] midwives of Israel to take all the mill
[1:02:35] children that were born all the men
[1:02:37] children and kill them
[1:02:39] drowned them
[1:02:42] and let the women I'll live because they
[1:02:44] were afraid Israel was going to rise up
[1:02:45] and have more people on the earth and
[1:02:47] take over the country so he already
[1:02:49] brought a form of abortion him in his
[1:02:53] day and it was full term abortion if you
[1:02:55] please but it's gotten worse I'll tell
[1:02:58] you it's just you look at it and it's
[1:03:02] insane and yet you treat an animal bad
[1:03:07] somebody see you swat your dog or keep
[1:03:11] your dog or something like that and
[1:03:13] bunny they'll put you in jail faster you
[1:03:15] animal rights will come down on you and
[1:03:18] you'll just look like you just I don't
[1:03:20] know why I did and just I know he bit
[1:03:26] three of my children but I love animals
[1:03:30] not gonna be wrong I'm not suggesting
[1:03:32] you kick any animals well I'm just
[1:03:34] suggesting this it's so the thinking and
[1:03:39] and how they're doing it it makes no
[1:03:42] sense it's insane you look at the the
[1:03:47] game gay right movie that used to be in
[1:03:51] the closet and then they one-by-one
[1:03:55] started coming out of the closet
[1:04:00] and then some of them begin to get
[1:04:01] prominent jobs news casting and whether
[1:04:05] people in and movie stars now and all of
[1:04:09] them is coming out of the closet you can
[1:04:10] tell they watch a show or anything
[1:04:13] anymore that that doesn't have some kind
[1:04:14] of a connotation toward that that way
[1:04:17] and then you better not say anything
[1:04:19] about it buddy they'll they'll block you
[1:04:25] up they'll put you away they'll have me
[1:04:27] every kind of right coming against you
[1:04:34] God has an order to things
[1:04:38] but they just thumb their nose that God
[1:04:41] we live in an insane world we don't we
[1:04:46] looked at people today you don't know if
[1:04:48] it's a he or she or in it
[1:04:54] I had to bite my tongue sometimes I just
[1:04:56] had a fella walk in front of me he had a
[1:05:02] full beard he had a dress on
[1:05:06] I forget what color his hair was now
[1:05:07] this is back a few years back I come
[1:05:10] that close but I'm saying
[1:05:17] but you know you don't dare say that
[1:05:20] you employee employers have to hire
[1:05:24] get in trouble if they don't hire in
[1:05:26] churches they've even got laws now that
[1:05:28] if you don't have any of your bylaws or
[1:05:30] something to protect you they can come
[1:05:32] right in here and end up sitting on the
[1:05:34] boards they need to be on a board all
[1:05:38] right so Ward's board
[1:05:39] they need me scrubbed out real good
[1:05:42] that's the Gospel according to brother
[1:05:44] John you look at profiling the the
[1:05:50] racial profiling that goes on
[1:05:55] you don't know what to call people
[1:05:59] I mean he used to be the black community
[1:06:03] is to be the Negroes and then they were
[1:06:05] the blacks and then they were other I
[1:06:08] guess they're still maybe
[1:06:09] african-american I just don't know what
[1:06:12] to say you you're afraid to open your
[1:06:14] mouth and say anything cuz somebody's
[1:06:16] gonna get out here yo you know he made a
[1:06:18] slur back about 50 years ago fifty years
[1:06:21] ago it wasn't a slur it's crazy you just
[1:06:28] don't know what to do the media and
[1:06:30] Hollywood have blessed you for being a
[1:06:32] Christian they'll they'll nail us to the
[1:06:34] cross for doing that again but you
[1:06:36] better not say nothing against their
[1:06:39] what they're standing for
[1:06:44] it makes no sense
[1:06:47] I mean
[1:06:50] I don't know sometimes
[1:06:53] you just don't say anything because
[1:06:54] you're afraid of offending some
[1:06:59] there's gonna be offended people let me
[1:07:01] tell you this coming
[1:07:05] seems like we're under check as
[1:07:07] believers
[1:07:10] on every side
[1:07:12] but second Timothy if you what
[1:07:15] think of a scripture second Timothy 3:12
[1:07:17] said this 2nd Timothy 3:12 said ye and
[1:07:20] all that live godly in Christ Jesus
[1:07:22] shall suffer persecution shall suffer
[1:07:28] persecution it's not new when you look
[1:07:33] at the Apostle Paul and what he had to
[1:07:35] go through you read his testimony his
[1:07:38] life story 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 if
[1:07:41] you would beginning at verse 25 tells a
[1:07:44] little bit about his perils 2nd
[1:07:47] Corinthians chapter 11 verse 25 said
[1:07:50] thrice was i beaten with rods not
[1:07:52] compared this to your walk compare this
[1:07:56] to your life have you gone through this
[1:07:58] yet 2nd Corinthians 11:25 thrice was i
[1:08:02] beaten with rods once was i stoned
[1:08:05] thrice thrice I suffered shipwreck a
[1:08:09] night and a day I have been in the deep
[1:08:11] that means he was in the ocean in
[1:08:13] journeyings often in perils of waters
[1:08:16] and perils of robbers and perils of my
[1:08:18] own countrymen in perils by the heathen
[1:08:20] in perils in the city in perils in the
[1:08:23] wilderness in perils went to sea in
[1:08:24] perils among false brethren in weariness
[1:08:27] and painfulness and watchings often in
[1:08:30] hunger in thirst and fastings often in
[1:08:32] cold and nakedness besides those things
[1:08:35] that are without that which cometh upon
[1:08:38] me daily the care of all the churches
[1:08:44] I mean he had a hard time but nobody
[1:08:49] said it was going to be easy serving
[1:08:50] serving Christ people think sometimes I
[1:08:54] had a lady just complained about
[1:08:56] everything because it wasn't we wasn't
[1:08:57] preaching what she liked and things
[1:08:59] weren't going were away and we wouldn't
[1:09:01] straighten her husband up so she was
[1:09:03] always complaining I never had any
[1:09:04] problems until I came to this message I
[1:09:08] believe that
[1:09:12] I can't believe that the problem is no
[1:09:16] you didn't want to believe you want to
[1:09:19] live your own way and do your own thing
[1:09:20] and still still keep it on here but when
[1:09:22] you when you look at puffle all the
[1:09:23] things that he went through you talk
[1:09:25] about spiritual pressure being among
[1:09:28] wolves that are in sheep's clothing
[1:09:30] gurgi bees Twilight and you don't mind
[1:09:32] being I'm taking my time and and I'm
[1:09:35] trying to talk slow because I don't want
[1:09:36] to get too excited but I am excited he
[1:09:40] was 12 26 and 27 said whose voice then
[1:09:43] shook the earth but now he has promised
[1:09:46] saying yet once more I was shaking out
[1:09:48] the earth only but also not just out
[1:09:53] here now now we're coming home now we're
[1:09:55] coming within in the heavenly realm
[1:09:57] things are gonna be shaking up and they
[1:10:00] had been sure the Bible talks about a
[1:10:03] great falling away and I said for years
[1:10:05] and years and years I said that's not
[1:10:07] just people out here in denominations
[1:10:08] that's coming right in our ranks because
[1:10:12] you gotta have something to fall away
[1:10:13] from first and that right and we've seen
[1:10:16] it happen here over the last few years
[1:10:17] there's been a great falling away that's
[1:10:19] come we couldn't have believed it we
[1:10:20] wouldn't want to believe it see who's
[1:10:23] voice then shook it said in this world
[1:10:26] verse 27 yet once more signifying the
[1:10:28] removing of those things that that are
[1:10:30] shaken as the things are that are made
[1:10:33] that those things which cannot be shaken
[1:10:35] may remain
[1:10:37] and what brother branham say this little
[1:10:40] bride will not be deceived
[1:10:47] we have a firm foundation
[1:10:50] we're something that we can stand upon
[1:10:52] something they've been sure something we
[1:10:54] can depend upon we're not we're not only
[1:10:57] got got got to deal with the world and
[1:11:00] the things that are out here in the
[1:11:01] world but now we've got to deal with all
[1:11:03] this as going on around us within our
[1:11:05] own ranks those that have fallen away
[1:11:07] from the message and coming against it
[1:11:09] and and and and you're trying to get get
[1:11:12] us to walk away ourselves there there
[1:11:15] there are some who even think everybody
[1:11:19] ought to do things the way they do it
[1:11:21] you ought to preach that guy preach
[1:11:23] believe what I believe sing like I sing
[1:11:26] walk like I walk talk like I talk well
[1:11:30] that's good but what if you're wrong
[1:11:36] well I ain't wrong bless God careful
[1:11:41] that every men's would be a lion gods
[1:11:44] the truth there's an absolute and you're
[1:11:48] not it
[1:11:54] like that you know what I'll keep that
[1:11:58] one no here's an absolute in your not
[1:12:02] even thank you lord
[1:12:05] oh my I love him don't you hey hey man
[1:12:09] so so we're not going to be with all
[1:12:11] that we're looking at
[1:12:15] I like what the president said our
[1:12:18] president said here back I guess it's
[1:12:20] been a month ago or so with the State of
[1:12:22] the Union when he was talking about the
[1:12:24] country and he made this statement right
[1:12:26] right at the end of the the address that
[1:12:28] I was listening to he said we he said we
[1:12:30] will never be a socialist country he
[1:12:35] said we were born free and we're going
[1:12:38] to remain free not love America
[1:12:44] and I know the Prophet said don't pray
[1:12:45] for it I know he said it's gone and I
[1:12:47] you can see that but I'm still in
[1:12:50] America I'm still thankful that I was
[1:12:54] born in America I'm still thankful for
[1:12:56] the truth that we at one time embraced
[1:12:58] and believed in but when he said that I
[1:13:03] thought you know what that's true I'm
[1:13:08] free
[1:13:12] this message
[1:13:14] came and it set me free set me free from
[1:13:20] denominations

[1:13:24] and all I I don't even know if that's a
[1:13:26] word and a sudden sorry English teachers
[1:13:29] ideologies I don't know maybe I got it
[1:13:31] somewhere sometimes I'd like to be big
[1:13:33] and think I don't ok so just look I'm
[1:13:37] sorry I I feel sometimes like people
[1:13:42] just don't don't want us to be free but
[1:13:46] when you look at the Word of God and
[1:13:48] what has it done for us we got freedom
[1:13:51] to worship
[1:13:55] got no soldiers back there telling us we
[1:13:57] can't worship this one not yet nobody's
[1:14:02] saying you can't do that freedom to
[1:14:05] praise we can worship God like we feel
[1:14:08] like we want to worship God amen because
[1:14:11] we're in a free country freedom to walk
[1:14:14] this freedom way the song says freedom

[1:14:43] believing God sent a prophet and you
[1:14:46] believe what that prophet talked you're
[1:14:49] a blessed person because nobody can tell
[1:14:53] you any different nobody can take away
[1:14:57] those freedoms in those truth you're
[1:15:00] free you should be happy are you happy

[1:17:18] live saintly in an insane world and I
[1:17:21] hope you'll just listen carefully I want
[1:17:23] to read from Ephesians chapter 6 first
[1:17:25] year seasons chapter 6 beginning in
[1:17:29] verse 13
[1:17:33] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:17:38] of God that's the complete word now she
[1:17:41] may be able to withstand the evil day
[1:17:45] that's that's today and have having done
[1:17:48] all having done all to stand stand
[1:17:54] therefore
[1:17:59] what do we do
[1:18:01] well John what do we do Stan
[1:18:07] uh-huh
[1:18:10] but don't tell me what to do stand the
[1:18:16] song says stand for holiness stand for
[1:18:20] righteousness I don't know the tune and
[1:18:23] be counted among them that rain with him
[1:18:25] you stand when you stand your stand with
[1:18:27] your friends begone Stan Stan Stan
[1:18:29] I don't know Stan when you're all alone
[1:18:30] and believe he show us what do we do
[1:18:35] having done all to stand stand
[1:18:41] you don't have to perform
[1:18:44] you don't have to stand up and say
[1:18:46] that's all align you all shut up you
[1:18:49] stand because the longer you stand there
[1:18:53] the grittier testimony becomes that
[1:18:57] you're one of them
[1:18:59] that doesn't revile back when he's
[1:19:02] reviled against
[1:19:07] all right
[1:19:09] let's go to let's go to Daniel chapter 3
[1:19:12] you with me just a few things here want
[1:19:17] a background Nebuchadnezzar who was the
[1:19:22] king of Babylon
[1:19:25] heeey
[1:19:29] he had a dream
[1:19:33] and
[1:19:35] in this dream he saw things and when he
[1:19:39] woke up the next morning he couldn't
[1:19:41] remember couldn't get it straight in his
[1:19:43] mind
[1:19:44] he's never had a dream you couldn't
[1:19:45] remember it you know it was a great
[1:19:46] dream but you could you when you have a
[1:19:48] great dream so he had the first thing
[1:19:50] you want to do is go back to sleep you
[1:19:52] don't to leave that I hate it when the
[1:19:54] alarm goes off er
[1:19:55] don't go off anymore hardly for me but I
[1:19:57] hate it when I have to get up you know
[1:19:58] and I've had a dream and it's time to
[1:20:00] get up and so he comes to all of us
[1:20:03] people is there's musicians and
[1:20:06] magicians and all the soothsayers and
[1:20:08] all the sheriff's and the princes and
[1:20:10] the governors and I've had this dream he
[1:20:12] says and whoever can tell me the dream
[1:20:14] I'm gonna make you a very rich man and
[1:20:16] he's a little king that's wonderful just
[1:20:18] tell us what you dreamed we'll tell you
[1:20:19] what it means and he said no I don't
[1:20:21] remember what I dreamed and he got
[1:20:24] frustrated with him and said unless you
[1:20:25] tell me what I dream I'm gonna take your
[1:20:27] heads off and when Daniel heard about it
[1:20:31] Daniel spoke up and said give me a
[1:20:36] chance so let me pray about it I'll come
[1:20:39] back so he goes off and he prays and he
[1:20:46] comes back to Nebuchadnezzar and he
[1:20:49] gives him the dream tells him what he
[1:20:51] dreamed even left out I mean he even
[1:20:55] told him parts that the king could rent
[1:20:58] out I told him what it meant and so in
[1:21:02] verse one here that that I had to pull
[1:21:05] up here in verse one here it said in
[1:21:07] Daniel three verses well I'm gonna read
[1:21:09] one two six but first one said he never
[1:21:11] connects with the king made a golden
[1:21:12] image in an image of gold whose height
[1:21:15] was threescore cubits and breath leer
[1:21:17] I've excused and set it up on a the
[1:21:19] plane of Dera and the province of Babel
[1:21:21] and so here he is he has a stream
[1:21:24] and and and and this is what a dream you
[1:21:27] got that you got that image of I got to
[1:21:29] do these things off the internet once I
[1:21:30] had brother Lonnie's slides on you got
[1:21:32] that one it's a it's it's the king it's
[1:21:35] the image of Daniel you got the other
[1:21:38] one how did you do that and now you
[1:21:39] can't get this one that's not it there
[1:21:44] now you got to make that thing real big
[1:21:46] real big blow that thing to pieces can
[1:21:50] you see it all right back down the back
[1:21:52] anyways this is what he dreamed so he
[1:21:57] begins to tell him he said said King
[1:21:59] what you dream in verse 2 of chapter 3
[1:22:05] I'm sorry let me back up here first
[1:22:09] chapter 2 verse 46 chapter 2 verse 46
[1:22:14] after Daniel did this told him all this
[1:22:19] he said he said this is your image he
[1:22:24] said the head of gold is your kingdom
[1:22:25] it's Babylon the breastplate of silver
[1:22:30] is the Medes and the Persians another
[1:22:32] kingdom to follow the thighs of brass is
[1:22:36] Greece legs of iron he told him what
[1:22:40] they represented he said it's wrong then
[1:22:44] he said the feet in the clay himr he
[1:22:48] said that's
[1:22:52] what's going to come in this end time
[1:22:54] two divided Nations which was the United
[1:22:58] States and Russia remember back in the
[1:23:01] 60s when Khrushchev and Eisenhower met
[1:23:04] remember that Khrushchev took his shoe
[1:23:07] off and pounded on the table at that
[1:23:09] meeting brother branham spoke and said
[1:23:10] that's it said that's that iron and clay
[1:23:12] they won't mix brought it right down
[1:23:19] into modern time we're at when he did
[1:23:24] that never Canasta fell on his face and
[1:23:28] worship Daniel he literally fell down
[1:23:34] and worshiped Daniel you can read it I'm
[1:23:37] gonna read it to you Daniel 246 Daniel
[1:23:41] 246 he said then king nebuchadnezzar ii
[1:23:45] fell upon his face and worship daniel
[1:23:49] and you talk about a red flag you don't
[1:23:55] do that you worship God and God only God
[1:23:59] is a jealous God nebuchadnezzar fell in
[1:24:04] his face and worship daniel and
[1:24:06] commanded that they should offer an
[1:24:08] oblation and sweet odours unto him and
[1:24:11] what he did he built this image he built
[1:24:17] this statute and the statute of the land
[1:24:20] says was was of daniel now this is
[1:24:27] hitting pretty close to home with this
[1:24:30] message we don't worship the prophet
[1:24:35] church it's wrong to worship the profit
[1:24:40] but we worship the one the Prophet led
[1:24:43] us to you hallelujah
[1:24:49] you get in the Prophet worshiping you
[1:24:51] got a problem I had a friend of mine one
[1:24:58] time used to go preach for him quite a
[1:25:01] bit and we were buddies I thought we
[1:25:05] were I saw her I guess she'll contact
[1:25:08] each other once more haaa but he told me
[1:25:10] one time you said brother John said we
[1:25:13] would say that's house I've gone to
[1:25:16] preach a meeting for him he's with
[1:25:18] church and he said I got to go somewhere
[1:25:21] I gotta do something cuz I want to ride
[1:25:22] along yeah so we're right along he looks
[1:25:25] at me in the car he says brother John
[1:25:26] said he said I believe brother Branham
[1:25:29] is the Holy Ghost so he told me it's
[1:25:33] right in the car not a clear blue sky
[1:25:36] and I said he took me back I just I said
[1:25:39] what did you say I thought he was joking
[1:25:42] he's not believing of the random was it
[1:25:44] is a Holy Ghost I said well why do you
[1:25:47] believe that he said well who is it in
[1:25:50] this day that has led us and guide us
[1:25:52] into all truth
[1:25:54] these are the profit so I breed the
[1:25:57] profits the holy ghost I looked at him I
[1:26:01] said well brother I said you can believe
[1:26:03] whatever you want to believe but I don't
[1:26:05] believe that so I looked at her ready I
[1:26:08] said what's that do with our meeting
[1:26:10] this coming up tonight Oh got nothing to
[1:26:14] do with that he said no that's fine you
[1:26:15] just come preaching no problem but you
[1:26:18] better be careful God is a jealous God
[1:26:24] even in Revelations when John fell to
[1:26:29] worship the angel picked him up and said
[1:26:32] no worship God the Angels lead us to the
[1:26:42] word I'm so glad for the angel but I
[1:26:49] can't worship the angel and standing in
[1:26:52] that crowd as you look at it here and
[1:26:54] you want me to continue to read it I can
[1:26:56] I can read it but you know it already
[1:26:57] Nebuchadnezzar he had gathered this is
[1:27:00] verse 2 of chapter 3 chapter 3 Daniel 3
[1:27:02] 3 and verse 2 said and then never can
[1:27:04] answer the king he gathered together all
[1:27:06] the princes and governors and captains
[1:27:07] and judges some treasures and counselors
[1:27:09] and sheriff's and all the rulers of the
[1:27:11] problems to come together to the
[1:27:12] dedication of the image which never can
[1:27:14] measure the king had set up and when
[1:27:16] they all got together then he told him
[1:27:17] at the command everyone's gonna fall
[1:27:19] down and worship and when they heard the
[1:27:22] sound of all the musical instruments
[1:27:24] everybody bounced down and worships this
[1:27:26] golden it was an image of Daniel and
[1:27:29] everybody when they heard that sound
[1:27:31] everybody bow down except for three
[1:27:43] they didn't bend they didn't bow they
[1:27:47] didn't burn but the ones this room and
[1:27:53] the furnace did they went bye-bye quick
[1:27:59] what did they do what did the heap of
[1:28:03] children do when it come time to make
[1:28:07] this tough decision they did nothing but
[1:28:13] Stan you don't have to defend this you
[1:28:20] don't have to argue this you don't have
[1:28:22] to debate this
[1:28:23] you just stand for truth everybody else
[1:28:27] around he's falling everybody else is
[1:28:30] crushing under the pressure and doing
[1:28:32] the things the world wants them to do
[1:28:33] and the devil wants to know they're just
[1:28:35] he's got them's like puppets on the
[1:28:36] string it pulls this and does this and
[1:28:39] everything but the bride is just
[1:28:40] standing we're looking for her second
[1:28:47] coming
[1:28:50] having them all the stand stand there
[1:28:54] for I love it church oh there's such a
[1:29:00] truth so what do we do we do nothing
[1:29:03] they just stood there they stood for it
[1:29:06] thou shalt have no other gods before
[1:29:08] thee
[1:29:14] there's three things I want to end with
[1:29:16] three keys to being successful as a
[1:29:22] Christian
[1:29:24] in 2019 this is
[1:29:30] for me
[1:29:32] number one I believe these things are
[1:29:36] must must be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:42] we must be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:46] Romans 8 verse 11 said it like this but
[1:29:51] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:29:52] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:29:55] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:29:57] also quicken that means to be make alive
[1:30:00] your mortal body that's his bodies here
[1:30:03] by the spirit that dwelleth in him
[1:30:10] Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the Holy
[1:30:12] Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:30:15] unto the day of redemption you see I
[1:30:22] like it but the man talks about that
[1:30:24] seal he talks about going behind the
[1:30:27] veil into the presence of the Shekinah
[1:30:31] glory you saying you let the curtain
[1:30:33] fall he says it seals the world out and
[1:30:37] it seals you in are you see over you
[1:30:44] just keep going through this land you're
[1:30:46] just standing that's all you're doing
[1:30:48] there's something different about that
[1:30:50] person something different about that
[1:30:52] guy
[1:30:53] something could differ about that woman
[1:30:55] they wonder what it is the last time for
[1:30:58] the berry took his group over there
[1:31:01] George brother George I'm sorry George
[1:31:02] Smith took his group over to Israel I've
[1:31:05] been at the last time here the time
[1:31:06] before that here a while back brother
[1:31:08] Jack Duff did he tell you the story
[1:31:10] about about the the guide did you tell
[1:31:13] you the story about the guy brother
[1:31:14] brother Jack
[1:31:16] brother Jack was on that on that tour
[1:31:18] with with with with George Smith and
[1:31:21] he'd think a lot of his church went but
[1:31:24] the guy pulled brother George off to the
[1:31:27] side and he said he said I've been a
[1:31:29] guide for I forget what he said 34 years
[1:31:32] he said I've seen a lot of groups come
[1:31:34] through they said what is it about you
[1:31:37] women but your women about your people
[1:31:39] that's different and brother George said
[1:31:43] well we're Christians no no no no no he
[1:31:46] said I've had every kind of church
[1:31:48] people go through here
[1:31:49] I've had Pentecostals I've been Baptists
[1:31:52] I've had you know Methodist I've had all
[1:31:54] there's something different you're women
[1:31:56] dressed like our women that are that are
[1:31:59] Orthodox what is it about that in
[1:32:07] brother George said well we believe God
[1:32:10] sent a prophet he looked at him and said
[1:32:14] a prophet he says you believe in
[1:32:16] prophets don't you George said he said
[1:32:17] yeah he said well I'll tell you what he
[1:32:22] said I want to give you this little tape
[1:32:25] this little I've taped Edie I don't what
[1:32:29] was one of the messages you take it and
[1:32:34] listen to it so that guy took it home
[1:32:37] that night and he came back to the next
[1:32:40] to hand couldn't hardly wait to get a
[1:32:43] hold of other Georgian he told him he
[1:32:47] said he said I listened to that tape and
[1:32:52] he said I had a dream I don't remember
[1:32:59] everything to went on in the dream I'm
[1:33:00] sorry I don't brother Jack would tell
[1:33:02] you the story and he said in this dream
[1:33:05] this man came to my house and expound
[1:33:09] two things and told me things and he
[1:33:11] going on and he said I'd never never
[1:33:15] thought about it was said that's that
[1:33:17] that man's a prophet he said there he
[1:33:20] said what he said you got any pictures
[1:33:25] towards his I got picture say pull out a
[1:33:27] picture by the random and his face got
[1:33:30] white he said that's the man that came
[1:33:32] to my house
[1:33:36] you think God's not real
[1:33:39] you just stand for what's right makes
[1:33:47] you feel religious done oh my goodness
[1:33:52] church I got two more things I got a
[1:33:54] close two more things the second thing
[1:33:58] I'd say is a must
[1:33:59] you've got to have a consistent prayer
[1:34:02] life
[1:34:04] the Bible says pray without ceasing if
[1:34:11] you don't have anything else to pray for
[1:34:13] pray for a little fun to any family pray
[1:34:17] for one another pray for your pastor
[1:34:20] pray for your family pray for your loved
[1:34:23] ones pray for this little bride James 5
[1:34:31] and verse 16 said the fervent the
[1:34:34] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:34:36] man availeth much
[1:34:44] in a message called this is on a slide
[1:34:47] number five what
[1:34:50] what does out here this was 1959 I like
[1:34:54] this other branch said this I might sing
[1:34:59] too much I might preach too much I might
[1:35:00] shout too much I might cry too much but
[1:35:03] I'll never pray too much and then in
[1:35:06] seed seed is not air but the shucks and
[1:35:08] he's 65 he said you might eat too much
[1:35:11] oh you might drink too much you might
[1:35:14] laugh too much you might walk too much I
[1:35:16] might add you might talk too much
[1:35:19] unquote but you'll never pray too much I
[1:35:24] would that men pray everywhere lifting
[1:35:26] up holy hands without doubt or wrath
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:34] the third thing that I'd say is a must
[1:35:38] for living as a successful Christian
[1:35:41] life is we got to keep feeding on the
[1:35:44] word you know what happens if you go
[1:35:49] without eating too long you get weak
[1:35:54] hello
[1:35:56] you get weak what do we do - stay strong
[1:35:59] read your Bible every day and pray
[1:36:01] that's what he said
[1:36:04] in the scripture and I'm closing John 5
[1:36:08] and verse 51 he said this I love this
[1:36:11] word I love this word I am The Living
[1:36:18] bread which came down from heaven If any
[1:36:23] man eat this bread he shall live forever
[1:36:27] the bread that I shall give him is my
[1:36:30] flesh which I give for the life of the
[1:36:34] world fixing to have communion tonight
[1:36:39] it's a symbol of partaking
[1:36:43] of the body and the blood of Jesus
[1:36:45] Christ
[1:36:48] you know what a privilege that is
[1:36:53] to be poor taker
[1:36:57] with the sacraments
[1:37:00] this do in remembrance of me not
[1:37:03] transfigured in anything but American
[1:37:06] remembrance of what Christ did for you
[1:37:12] what he gave for you
[1:37:15] verse 53 said the Jews therefore strove
[1:37:17] among themselves saying how can this man
[1:37:19] give us his flesh to eat then jesus said
[1:37:22] unto them verily I say to you except you
[1:37:24] eat my flesh the flesh of the Son of Man
[1:37:26] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:37:28] you whosoever eateth my flesh and
[1:37:30] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:37:33] I will raise him up the last day for my
[1:37:35] flesh is meat and read him my blood is
[1:37:36] drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[1:37:39] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[1:37:44] and I in him
[1:37:51] let's stand together and bow our hearts
[1:38:05] I want to pray for you
[1:38:09] you can pray for one another
[1:38:12] what do we do
[1:38:15] your heads behind your eyes closed
[1:38:18] what do we do
[1:38:22] if we get caught
[1:38:25] it's one of these spirits
[1:38:31] you know I I'm paraphrasing a quote
[1:38:34] right now to you paraphrasing it but
[1:38:37] brother branham said that the closest
[1:38:40] paraphrasing we can get to being the
[1:38:44] most spiritual we can be is just one
[1:38:47] step from insanity because we're dealing
[1:38:50] in the spirit world before I pray I want
[1:38:55] to close with this quote in demonology
[1:38:58] he said many times you can see a person
[1:39:03] may be of insanity now they may be yet a
[1:39:07] converted person filled with the Holy
[1:39:10] Ghost and yet be totally insane see
[1:39:14] that's right it has nothing to do with a
[1:39:17] soul
[1:39:18] it's a tormentor it's something that
[1:39:21] torments
[1:39:23] so you may know someone today who was
[1:39:26] going through the most hideous things
[1:39:28] and torments and yet you know they've
[1:39:33] been a good person and they love God you
[1:39:37] need to pray for
[1:39:40] you need to pray for one another
[1:39:44] everly father
[1:39:46] just closing this quietness now
[1:39:51] even though we live in this crazy world
[1:39:55] we have a whole beyond the river
[1:39:59] we have a LifeCare Lamb of God that we
[1:40:03] didn't deserve it but you shared your
[1:40:06] life with us
[1:40:09] and we're able to partake of that life
[1:40:16] and Lord we thank you for that I want to
[1:40:20] thank you today Lord for your word for
[1:40:26] your profit for brother Sam and the
[1:40:29] Saints here this little assembly god I
[1:40:33] love coming here I love the people and
[1:40:36] Lord they're good people
[1:40:40] and they see they see the insanity
[1:40:43] that's going on in Lourdes if we focused
[1:40:46] on that we'd get so discouraged but
[1:40:50] we're not focusing on that let the world
[1:40:53] go let the world do whatever they're
[1:40:55] going to do those we're living in
[1:40:57] heavenly places in Christ Jesus we walk
[1:40:59] through these doors and Lord there's
[1:41:01] something that happens to us we're
[1:41:03] transformed and we we worship and we
[1:41:05] praise you and we sing and we we hear
[1:41:08] the precious Word of God Lord were so
[1:41:13] thankful for that

[1:47:22] let's see this last verse again you
[1:47:26] notice there every one of these verses
[1:47:27] it starts out just as I am there's not
[1:47:31] one of us not one can make ourselves fit
[1:47:39] fit to come to him but he provides all
[1:47:44] that we need him to come to him
[1:47:48] and he provides in order to take care of
[1:47:51] and make us fit to stand in his presence
[1:47:56] it's his work it's his work and at the
[1:48:03] latter part of every one of these verses
[1:48:05] old Lamb of God that's the focus just as

[1:51:38] let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[1:51:43] Lord we thank you for your word this
[1:51:46] morning
[1:51:49] Lord it's so true that
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:52] we not only see it around us we've since
[1:51:55] the pressure sword Lord it's all around
[1:52:00] us as it's recorded in Psalms 27
[1:52:07] enemies gathered all around
[1:52:11] Lord we feel we feel pressure not just
[1:52:13] from the world
[1:52:15] we feel pressure all around us from
[1:52:18] within our ranks and on and on Lord your
[1:52:22] God as you brought it from Lord insanity
[1:52:25] that's out there you dealt with things
[1:52:28] Lord Jesus right here that Lord our
[1:52:32] message is not exempt from it but the
[1:52:35] message never produced those things our
[1:52:37] God Lord would realized that certain
[1:52:40] things that we see and we face Lord we
[1:52:45] know it by the term of fanaticism but
[1:52:48] yet that in itself Lord God it speaks of
[1:52:51] the truth then we have been gathered to
[1:52:55] Lord if it wasn't for that Lord God it
[1:52:59] would cause us to wonder
[1:53:01] but father we know that Lord in you is
[1:53:05] our stain
[1:53:07] no wonder the scripture would speak to
[1:53:10] us say Lord in this time of trouble you
[1:53:15] would hide us in your pavilion in the
[1:53:20] secret of your tabernacle
[1:53:24] David would say now I am set up on a
[1:53:27] rock and my head is lifted up above mine
[1:53:32] enemies yeah I will sing praises of joy
[1:53:37] in the tabernacle of the Lord certainly
[1:53:41] not joy was not something that
[1:53:44] originated from what he's seen or from
[1:53:46] what he felt but from where by the rock
[1:53:49] that he was placed on that his head was
[1:53:51] lifted to see beyond all of this that is
[1:53:56] around all the pressure all the tests
[1:53:59] all the trials we see the end is here we
[1:54:05] see Lord just any moment we're going to
[1:54:08] be changed in a twinkling of an eye Lord
[1:54:11] God to look beyond Lord and with
[1:54:14] anticipation looking for your coming
[1:54:17] Lord God believing Lord God by the
[1:54:19] coming of the Holy Ghost in our soul
[1:54:22] that we are a part of that coming Lord

[1:54:27] Blessed hope of the Church of the Living

[1:55:10] second coming of the Lord for this is a
[1:55:13] promise to us as believers it's a
[1:55:15] promise that all believers believe that
[1:55:18] we will see there is a literal Jesus
[1:55:22] that we will behold and be caught up

[1:57:11] probably a 4 o'clock we're going to
[1:57:14] start and move on into communion taking
[1:57:18] the Lord's Supper and then foot washing
[1:57:20] and if your your heart your life is
[1:57:26] right with God
[1:57:28] we're more than welcome to be here to be
[1:57:32] a part of that community it's a
[1:57:35] wonderful opportunity wonderful time a
[1:57:39] man to give witness and worship the Lord
[1:57:43] you know if I'll say it like this if
[1:57:47] there's something that's not going to
[1:57:49] get it right
[1:57:52] get it right don't let it linger get it
[1:57:56] right
[1:57:58] brother Brown preached the message
[1:57:59] Jubilee year in 1954 I believe it is
[1:58:02] preaching that message standing right
[1:58:04] there in that time as he goes on the
[1:58:10] minister that he said here we're gonna
[1:58:11] be coming and taking communion tonight
[1:58:14] no he's just as to the church that
[1:58:17] morning Word made flesh India trip to
[1:58:20] pray for him because he had developed a
[1:58:22] critical spirit in his life the prophet
[1:58:26] called that critical spirit a selfish
[1:58:27] spirit that was always wanting to tell
[1:58:30] everybody else where they were wrong so
[1:58:33] brother brems already told the people
[1:58:34] that morning that he preaches Jubilee or
[1:58:36] what a fitting message to preach for
[1:58:37] communion service and he would tell the
[1:58:39] people sitting right there in the seat
[1:58:42] he said if there's something he said in
[1:58:44] your heart something that's not right
[1:58:46] before you come to the table make it
[1:58:48] right
[1:58:49] you see it doesn't take God a long time
[1:58:53] to do a quick work it simply takes a
[1:58:57] heart that's surrendered and in tune
[1:59:00] with him and to recognize the effectual
[1:59:03] working of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:05] Christ if you said something a little
[1:59:08] wrong if there's something wrong get it
[1:59:09] right with him because this blood isn't
[1:59:13] something to you and I have to work with
[1:59:15] it's the blood that works in us it works
[1:59:18] upon us and it works in us amen
[1:59:22] god bless you I want to keep any longer
[1:59:26] Lord willing we'll be gathered back here
