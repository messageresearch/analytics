We wait all you long and as we pray unto you speak your word to our hearts and heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. So good to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so so appreciate seeing each and one of you and I know some weren't able to make it and um we always kind of leave that to the discretion of each one and but I'm thankful that God made a way that we could be here &gt;&gt; and um others that would be connecting and through streaming and so forth. But it's good to be together. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in his presence. And uh I certainly always believe every time we come together, God has something for us. &gt;&gt; And he knows just what we have need of. And sometimes it's not exactly that we see what God is seeing, but God knows what lays just right ahead. And God is always working to prepare us &gt;&gt; uh for victory. He's he's not a God does not relish in defeat but he rejoices in the victory in our lives and that victory is his word. It's where his will has had been able to prevail over our own will and so we that's a that's a very great thing. Amen. I think how brother Ram says it in um God be with us where be all the miracles. And he says at the end of it, he said, "God, if there's been anything accomplished in this past year in our lives, it's because your spirit &gt;&gt; has overrode our stubborn rebellion &gt;&gt; that your word might be fulfilled through us." &gt;&gt; You might say, "Brother Sammy, I'm a believer." Brother Brandham was a believer too. Brother Bram was not praying that because of the people there. But you see, it's when you be begin to see those things within us and recognize by the word to be able to separate what is the son and daughter of God and that other part that's around us. Because remember the quickening power never come to bring uh the dirt to life. It come to bring the seed on the inside. And so what grace, what grace that God has given us. Amen. Let's just stand. And I want to say thank you to the musicians and um just so good to be together. &gt;&gt; And um you have to forgive me. I forgot. I standing here looking at it. I'm thinking that's not the text I'm using. So, I forgot on my first couple slides to put my text in, but um we're going to go to Isaiah chapter 7 here this morning and um to get into our our thought here. So Isaiah chapter 7 and verse uh verse 10 and I want to work with this um scripture if the Lord will help us here for the next little bit. And um I understand that this is the the Christmas season, but this is the text I'm taking is not because of the Christmas Christmas season. Uh this the text that I'm taking is just really the burden that's been on my heart for actually uh a few months and uh throughout weeks has just continued to compile as we've been going through this in Leviticus chapter 8. And uh so I I believe that God will help us to see the the thought within this. And um so let's read here in Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 10. Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, "Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God, and ask it either in the depth or in the height above." But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And he said, "Hear ye now, oh house of David. It is a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?" Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. For behold, for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land that thou aboreest shall be forsaken of both her kings. Let's just ask the Lord's blessing here upon his word here this morning. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we just come before you, Lord, here this morning and just uh are so thankful that God that you have uh made a way that we could be here. We thank you, Father, for just giving strength, Lord, in in our body, Lord, for for just giving for touching us, Lord. And Father, watching over us upon the roads. And we just Lord we so thank you for your mercies Lord here this morning. It's just such a privilege Lord that to be able to come Lord and to gather Lord around the word of God. Now we Lord are asking that Lord that you would just now take Lord the word take our lives and God may you open the word and reveal yourself unfold it to our lives and may we may we see and may we hear your voice oh God and may we Lord just move with grace Lord to act upon your word we pray we just Lord commit this service now into your hands and ask that you would just be with every need, Lord, that's been spoken and unspoken. Those that are able to be here and those that are streaming, Lord, may your presence, Lord, just move just so freely, Lord, right here among us, Lord. And just, oh God, to convey that burden, Lord, that you have placed, Lord, in my heart, Father, as a man, I'm insufficient, Lord, to to do this, Lord. But, Father, I'm trusting in you. You are my sufficiency and Lord, we're looking to you that God that it's what you desire to deliver, Lord. So, I just commit myself and this congregation into your hands and we ask for your perfect will, Lord, here this morning. And we thank you, Father, for your mercy once again in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Um, I want to take with this focus and just to kind of focus our attention here for a few moments on God with us because that is the name or his name being called Emmanuel is God with us or with us is God. And in the book of Matthew, remember it even with all of this being uh prophesied and known uh the prophet, I love how he uh dramatizes this in the message. Um and with this of Joseph and Mary and just speaking how that even in their uh courtship of how that they were fellowshipping about the promise of Isaiah and in that promise of Isaiah, you know, brother Brandham was dramatizing it of how that when they went to the synagogue, they uh were hearing uh things expressed such as just God being a God of history and that of the Red Sea and and and so forth. But as they fellowshipped, there was things that it's so as believers, it just something wasn't resonating just right. And I think how that when you know, Joseph in that drama would actually begin to express about that of Isaiah and you know, they were talking what do you think about this? And Joseph just simply said, you know, brother Bam, dramatizing, if God God has spoke through his prophet, it will not fail &gt;&gt; because it's God's word. That's right. &gt;&gt; It will come to pass. &gt;&gt; You see, the the battles that we have always before us, the battles um do not change. Sometimes the front's the way it looks, but there's always been opposition. This is why that there's always been a battle. There's always been a conflict. When God gives a word and he's fulfilling his word in that season, it's always calling the people back to one thing, back to the true reality of the living God. that then through that revelation that the people then might be able to recognize who they are by seeing God and then recognize the privileges that God has for them, the rights and the relationship. And we we so within looking at this, it's very important as recognizing that God being there and being present with us because when when Matthew uh records this and the referring to this scripture and how that Joseph when these things were taking place even though they were well-versed in the word and in the scriptures but one of the things that I I love so so much is how the scripture says that even through all of these things, Joseph himself, he thought on these things. So, it's so important of taking in the word and meditating on the word of God. There's things that God will drop and deliver our way. And there's things that to be quite quite honest that even as while the word is coming forth at times that we're not always going to see the application we're not always going to understand it but it's to take the word in and just just just begin to take the word just to pray over that word and and just as we're we're dwelling upon that you know the prophet would always take the scripture draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh to you and he'll tie that scripture in James to that of us in our thinking and the thoughts that we entertain and we know that we are living in a time that in an hour that where our mind is constantly embombarded it's it's really um it's very can be very difficult to just shut everything out and I'm talking about uh the bombardment from all the things of media and everything else we have the devices and our all around we've got devices I mean you've got devices in your cars now that everything is is all around in in order to um keep people connected. And I think if that's if that's so prevalent where they would have things to where to keep people connected with Wi-Fi and our cars and everything and oh that's so important and everything, then I think it's a it's an age and a time and an hour where there's a bride who wants to be more than just a of a connected. She wants to be in tune. Lord, I I want to I want to be in tune at all times. I want to be I want to be right where you're at. I want to be moving. I want to be help me to catch what you're doing in this moment in this season. And so when when when when Matthew or is recording this and we see that how that God he visits Joseph by a dream and we know that that's because there wasn't a prophet on the scene at the time and God worked through a secondary way. It wasn't anything that would be of great symbolic uh stature because when God would give something of that nature, God will have a prophet on the scene to interpret that. And so there are are things that when we when we look at this in God with us and I want to just hone in on this phrase with the significance of God with us because when and I don't I don't want to lose you but I want re to to kind of reflect back there in Leviticus 8 when their priests are coming into consecration that whole process is done over and they continue to go through the same process. Yes, seven days for a complete consecration. And God has taken his bride through seven church ages. &gt;&gt; And so we're living in the hour where the bride, where the promises, where the marriage of the lamb has come. We are living in an hour that the word that has come has come to unite us to Christ to where that these two are no longer one. And so we recognize within that fulfillment of that word, that's what brings the unity. That's what brings the harmony. This is why if you think back to a few of the services that we've been in even as brother Josh right in the same vein was here last week it it must be the word for this season and that word being ministered of this season in order to bring the evening time results. So you we don't need to go back and make the gospel simpler because the gospel can be no more simpler than Christ himself being revealed. &gt;&gt; And uh you know we see that it's the word it's not to understand it in this way. It's not your duty. It's not my duty to make someone see. But it is it is God in his mercy because it it's nothing that we did to make ourselves see. &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard this brother preach. It wasn't that brother. &gt;&gt; Uh you know, oh I I heard brother Brandham on tape say this. It wasn't brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you &gt;&gt; but my father which is in heaven. And that's what gives us the confidence because it's not and that's why as we see this message, this message is not the understanding of William Bran. That's right. &gt;&gt; This message is is is the son of man being revealed. It's simply God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; And that's where that the word being spoken in season, it's the inspiration, the Holy Spirit to bring the quickening to the seed for that hour. And it's God with us. Now it's it's it's very very very true that when we see this with God, God with us, the ultimate is God's desire is to dwell in us. And that God would have preeminence in our lives. &gt;&gt; Because even after God comes in in us, he now wants preeminence in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that of preeminence is not is not a is not a gift. It's a victory. &gt;&gt; And so we find that to where that he's becoming the chief in all things. He's becoming the head of all things. It's resting and relying in him. And we and that is built. I want you to understand this is all built where God by his presence revealing himself is what brings the confidence. It brings security. It brings rest. It It brings about a yielding within the heart and life of the believer because God is a gentleman. He won't force himself. But we must yield our lives to him. And that's what God wants us to do is simply to yield. And how do we yield? By faith. And how DOES FAITH COME? BY HEARING the word of God. And what is faith? It's a revelation of God's will. God shows you what is the truth and then you walk in it because he has spoke to you. &gt;&gt; So here the prophet picks this up in a very short message the presence of God unrecognized and he says if he is present then everything is settled. &gt;&gt; That's a big statement. &gt;&gt; If he's present then why everything is settled? He made the word. He's here to confirm it. He proves it. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We see him night after night, infallibly, day after day, year after year. Not one time has he predicted anything, regardless when it was that it would happen out of the thousands of times, perfectly right on the dot. And he said, "Those of you that know the ministry know it to be true. Regardless how even impossible, it's happened just the same. He is God. And if we would just recognize that and take a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, if we could only do that tonight, people, if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose, and that's to release our desires that we have in him to us. But we've got to recognize his presence. And now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest. Not the promised word of Moses age or any other age but the promised word for this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God has God in the fulfillment of the promise of his word. It releases if when we can recognize his presence, then it releases the desires we have in HIM BECAUSE ONLY him revealing himself can actually re release the desires that he put within us. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE THOSE DESIRES THAT ARE WITHIN YOU? Where did they rise from? They're r they are RAISING FROM THAT SEED that he put within you. as the seed is desiring for that water is desiring for that light and the prophet ties the water and the revealing of the word TO THE INSPIRATION OF THE HOUR THAT IS POURED OUT upon the people of God. &gt;&gt; And so it's to recognize him uh and and he's appearing he's making himself known to us. And I think that's this is not just words to be forgotten, but it's to understand God making himself known to YOU PERSONALLY. RIGHT? EVEN in the midst of a service, God revealing himself personally to you. &gt;&gt; He's didn't get a mistake. HE DIDN'T DELIVER SOMETHING TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. HE'S NOT SPEAKING TO THE WRONG PERSON. He's speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to me. And so I want to just look at this here a few moments on this portion of God with us and how that God is if faithful in the fulfillment of his promise to uh move in our lives and our hearts to build the faith that is needed in order to obtain the promise in that hour. Now notice when HERE WHEN GOD AS GOD became one of us, we we understand that that purpose of God becoming one of us was indeed in purposed in redemption. That's true. And God also, he came that he might uh be a uh a faithful and merciful high priest, one that would so uh faithfully understand all if all of the complexities of humanity. Brother Ram said he had frustrations. &gt;&gt; That to me is powerful because it didn't it's not saying that he was but he experienced those things. So he experienced that those parts of humanity you know even headache and so forth. Brother Bram goes into that and draws from it because in his body he was absolutely totally MAN BUT INSIDE totally God. &gt;&gt; And that's why THE PROPHET SAID HE MADE A CHOICE IN TOTAL DELIVERANCE. HE MADE A CHOICE. He could have been a man, BUT HE CHOSE TO deliver his natural being into the hands of the God who lived in him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who was he? He was God. &gt;&gt; He was Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT TO JUST JUST JUST LOOK AT THIS HERE just for a moment. Let me just go through a few passages of scripture. And here he comes. Remember, the responsibility of God coming is is for redemption. That is true. to die upon the cross uh to TO PAY THE PRICE FOR sin debt. But I want you to see ALSO THAT THE WHOLE TIME of the journey even of the three and a half years and then after he raises there and walks with them in Luke 24 IT'S IT'S ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THEIR FAITH HAS TO BE BUILT IN THE LIVING GOD AND THEN INTO THE PROMISE that pertains to them. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND GOD HAS SEEN TO IT THAT IT'S NOT UH UP TO US TO TRY TO FIND OUR WAY, &gt;&gt; but he said, "I'm here to lead you." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO GUIDE YOU ALL the way. He's here to bring faith. HE'S HERE TO BUILD FAITH WITHIN THE WORD. BECAUSE A PERSON COULD NEVER CAN NEVER THEY could have never RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT UNLESS THEIR FAITH HAD BEEN BUILT FOR IT. I I DON'T CARE. I KNOW YOU COULD SAY, "WELL, THEY WAS OFFERED UP ON CALVARY." BUT UNLESS THEIR FAITH WAS BUILT FOR IT AND TO REALIZE WHAT HE HAD DID FOR THEM AND THAT IT WAS FOR THEM, THEY WOULDN'T RECEIVE IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET TELLS US BACK, HE SAYS, HE SAYS, IN ORDER IN ACTS 19, THEY HAD TO COME TO THE PRESENT REALITY THAT THE ATONEMENT HAD BEEN OFFERED UP BEFORE THEY COULD RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; SEE, THE WORD, IT'S NOT GOD JUST SAYING, WELL, YOU KNOW, WELL, I RECEIVED THE WORD IN A B OR I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN A BAPTIST CHURCH. NO, YOU DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; OH, I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH. NO, YOU DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED A BAPTISM, BUT YOU NEVER RECEIVED A WORD BIRTH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE NEW BIRTH COMES UNDER THE MINISTRY OF THIS HOUR. THIS IS THE HOUR OF THE SEALING ANGEL. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID HE WOULD SEND THE SPIRIT IN IN MY NAME. AND WHAT IS HIS NAME? IT'S HIS WORD BEING REVEALED. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Just watch this in the scripture here for a few moments in John 7 VERSE 33. THEN SAID JESUS UNTO THEM, YET A LITTLE while &gt;&gt; and I am with you and then I GO UNTO HIM THAT SENT ME. &gt;&gt; SO HERE HE IS, GOD WITH US. HE'S WALKING WITH THE DISCIPLES. And remember he says you you'll seek me but you won't find me. Where I am thither you cannot come. Now, he's not talking to the disciples. He's speaking to that of of the Pharisees of the Jews that were surrounding him even in that time. And here the as as they're asking the question, how how is this going to be? And what do you mean we can't find you? AND SEE WHAT JESUS IS POINTING THEM TO IS THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO CATCH THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IN THE MESSAGE DESPERATION, HE SAID THE BIRTHRIGHT IS RIGHT AMONG US. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT'LL PASS RIGHT THROUGH US. BRANDOM tabernacle &gt;&gt; and Esau. Now, I don't want TO GO THERE, BUT WHEN WE LOOK HERE IN THE SCRIPTURES, JESUS GOES ON TO SAY, "IN THE LAST DAY, THAT GREAT day of the feast, JESUS STOOD AND CRIED AND SAID, IF ANY MAN THIRST, let him come unto me and drink, and he that believeth on me, AS THE SCRIPTURE SAID, OUT of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." And this he spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive. For the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified. IN JOHN CHAPTER 12, JESUS SAID UNTO THEM, "YET A LITTLE WHILE IS THE LIGHT with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you. For he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth. While you have light, believe in the light that you may be the children of the light. And these things Jesus spake and departed from them. SO HE'S DRAWING JESUS HERE DRAWING this attention that here what is PRESENT IS LIGHT FOR them to walk in. You say what light? To lead them from where THEY ARE TO WHERE THEY need to be. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AS THE PLYAS PETER WOULD WRITE UNTIL THE DAY STAR RISE IN YOUR HEART AND THE PROPHET SAYS IT'S THE DAY STAR THAT IS LEADING US TO THAT PLACE TO THE REAL GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE TO BE BORN IN OUR LIVES. SO GOD SENDS HIS WORD AND HE IT'S GOD ACCOMPANYING HIS WORD GOD WITH US TO LEAD US INTO THE PLACE THAT HE IS CALLING US TO. GOD DOES NOT TAKE HIS HANDS OFF. GOD DOES NOT JUST SAY, "WELL, HERE'S THE WORD. YOU FIGURE IT OUT." GOD IS WITH US. &gt;&gt; HE'S INTERESTED IN HIS WORD COMING TO PASS. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO FORCE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WE'RE BELIEVERS. HE STAYS RIGHT THERE UNTIL FAITH RISES TO TRUST HIM AND TO BELIEVE HIM. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE WALKING in that light. &gt;&gt; WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SCRIPTURE. You could see it even throughout the ecumenical world. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED when they rejected uh the Lord Jesus and then WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAD COME, THE JEWS TURNED THAT DOWN AND THE PROPHETS SAID THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE IT WAS THAT'S where it was sealed away right there in Acts. THEY THEY THEY REJECTED THAT OF the Messiah. They rejected THE HOLY SPIRIT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE BLIND. BUT THERE WAS ALSO THE PARALLEL THAT WALKING IN THE LIGHT TO RECOGNIZE THE LIGHT OF THIS HOUR. HERE HE WAS WALKING IN THEIR MIDST. AND HERE YOU FIND MEN THAT COULD NOT EVEN READ THEIR NAME AS the prophet SAID ABOUT PETER. IF THEY WROTE HIS NAME ON A BOX CAR, HE WOULDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE IT. NOW, THOSE ARE NOT JUST LITTLE VERNACULARS THAT THE PROPHET WOULD P PUT IN THERE TO JUST TRY TO FILL SPACE, BUT HE'S LETTING US KNOW THAT IT'S NOT BY POWER. IT'S NOT BY MIGHT. IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT. IT'S GOD REVEALING HIMSELF TO YOU AND I OF WHAT THE WORLD MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE OUTCAST AND NOT WORTHY. AND TRULY, WE'RE NOT WORTHY. NO MAN COULD BE WORTHY. NO, NOT ONE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE WASN'T A PHARISEE WORTHY. &gt;&gt; NOBODY was worthy. &gt;&gt; But God placed it in that way. And it's God working in our lives because it's super it's a supernatural. &gt;&gt; It's supernatural, friends. &gt;&gt; While you have the light, walk in it. Jesus would go on to say in John 13 when he was gone out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him and if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while and I am with you &gt;&gt; you'll seek me and as I said to the Jews whether I go you CANNOT COME SO NOW I say unto you And Peter says,"Lord, whether goest thou?" And Jesus said, "Whether I go, thou canst not follow me now." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But thou shalt follow me afterwards. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Knowing full well Peter what he would do, deny him three times. &gt;&gt; SEE ALL OF THIS, GOD ALREADY KNEW. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW. LISTEN NOW. HERE IS THE GOD OF GLORY, GOD WITH US, EMMANUEL. AND HERE WAS JUDAS RIGHT with him. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And it never had the effect on Judas. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That it had on Peter. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It never had an effect. It never had he was always, you know, like like like like as Judas always trying to always trying to fit it in. You know, the prophet also places it very clearly in three kinds of believers. He said Judas was that one was never really just quite just sold around, you know, he was always looking for a a loophole in it. &gt;&gt; See, this is what may this is the something that I listen to and I look very carefully for because God has not entrusted the ministry in this hour to go around and decipher brother Brandham meant this here. Brother Bram didn't mean this over here. Brother Brandham meant this. That's a that that's not the spirit of God. That's that's that's not God. I I you know because this is where I simply would stop at is where's your vindication? &gt;&gt; Was there a pillar of fire over your head? &gt;&gt; You see, BEGIN TO THINK HE BEGINS. WE'RE GOING YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME THINGS THAT WE CAME OUT OF. &gt;&gt; GOD BROUGHT A PEOPLE OUT FROM UNDER THE REASONING OF MAN. &gt;&gt; WELL, FRIENDS, LISTEN. WHAT A BLESSING IT IS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR GOD'S VOICE AND TURN TUNE OUT ALL OTHER VOICES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm just GOING TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. IF I'M NOT SPEAKING TO THE MESSAGE THROUGH THE MESSAGE AND IN THE MESSAGE, THEN I'M WRONG. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE, GOD HAS ALREADY VINDICATED IT. AND I'M NOT HERE, I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE TIME, OH THAT I HAVE TO PROVE THAT. THAT'S I'M NOT GOING INTO THAT TRAP. GOD HAS ALREADY VINDICATED IT. AND HE'S VINDICATING IT IN LIVES AND HEARTS EVEN THROUGHOUT THIS CONGREGATION. NOT JUST IN THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, WHICH IS TRUE, BUT HE'S ALSO VINDICATING IT IN LIVES AFTER THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS come being changed and changed and changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, I say this respectfully, but I don't have time for that. &gt;&gt; I'm settled. &gt;&gt; No questions. SO GOD WITH US. Walk while you have the light here in this moment. Think of even the beginning. Now just make a make a track with me back to Genesis 1. Here is the earth void without form in darkness. And God speaks and says, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And the Bible says there was light. And the spirit of God after God spoke, the spirit of God began to move upon the waters. The Holy Spirit began TO MOVE. SEE, THE WORD being spoken, GOD GOD WAS CALLING for what was needed IN THAT HOUR. LET THERE BE LIGHT. AND THE PROPHET SAID HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE DARKNESS THAT WAS COVERING THAT OVER. LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS. MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT even the message where brother Brandon will say he said you you see a person and you you see how this is he said but you KNOW HE TALKED ABOUT A YOUNG MAN he said I see this young man he said he was all chained up and so FORTH HE SAID I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO WATCH AND SEE WHEN THE HOW THIS YOUNG MAN IS WHEN HE GETS OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THOSE CHAINS AND SO BROTHER RAM'S JUST WATCHING this in a vision and he SEES WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN GETS OUT FROM THOSE CHAINS HE'S LIKE MY HE'S NOT EVEN ANYTHING LIKE HE WAS ACTING HIS HIS BEHAVIOR AND WHATEVER MORE. SO WHAT WAS IT? THE BEHAVIOR WAS NOT THE YOUNG MAN. IT WAS THE CHANGE OR THE SPIRITS OR THE DARKNESS HE WAS UNDER. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE WORD COMES TO DIVIDE TO DRIVE BACK. THAT'S WHY LISTEN FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY I I UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORD THERE IS A MOLDING AND THERE IS A SHAPING THAT'S VERY TRUE IN OUR LIFE AND A CONTINUAL MOLDING. BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S SITUATIONS AND THERE'S THINGS THAT IT'S NOT PERSONALITY. IT'S DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; It's darkness &gt;&gt; that must be cast away. &gt;&gt; Because the people are good people, but it's the darkness, the influence. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? That's why brother Brandon will pick it up in the message shalom and he's talking about he said you TAKE PEOPLE THEY WANT TO DO RIGHT THEY HEAR ABOUT NOT CUTTING THEIR HAIR AND ALL OF THESE THINGS HE SAID THEY WANT TO DO RIGHT HE SAID BUT IT'S DARKNESS GROSS DARKNESS UPON THE PEOPLE THAT'S DRIVING THEM I SAY GOD HELP US TO HAVE THAT REVELATION THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH FLESH AND BLOOD &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T APPROACH IT WITH REASONING &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THE ONLY THING HE SAID THAT'LL CAST OUT A SPIRIT IS DIVINE LOVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU DON'T CAST OUT SPIRITS BY CRUEL AND INDIFFERENT LIVING. AND JUST A QUICK SYNOPSIS ON THAT, YOU DON'T APPROACH THE SPIRIT THE SAME WAY THAT IT'S COMING. YOU APPROACH IT WITH STEADFASTNESS AND CONFIDENCE IN THE WORD OF KNOWING WHO YOU ARE. AND LORD, THAT'S YOUR SON. THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER. I'M GOING AFTER THEM. &gt;&gt; GY. &gt;&gt; That's so good. So that first light that struck the earth was not sunlight. It was shikina light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God's light by his word that began to set everything in motion. It began to move as the prophet said in rising of the sun with love and compassion on that first day to drive back and turn darkness INTO NIGHT. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS GOD WITH US. GOD WITH HIS ATTRIBUTE CALLED THE EARTH. GOD WITH US SEEDS THAT WERE LAYING down beneath that earth. &gt;&gt; And I want to just say once again, I know I've we have really moved through this in previous services and once again, brother Josh, just stepping right in that same vein. God creates the conditions by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN GOD WHEN GOD when when the need was for a body change FOR ABRAHAM AND SARAH, GOD CREATED THE CONDITIONS by his word. &gt;&gt; You see WHAT IS NEEDED? GOD CREATES BY HIS WORD THE FAITH THAT'S needed for this hour. That's so good. &gt;&gt; So when you find here Moses, Moses comes to the burning bush and God remember God attracts here his attention. He's attracted and God begins to make known, I've come down. I've heard their cries, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I've come down to deliver them. And here God makes known to Moses. Certainly, I'm going to be with you. BECAUSE MOSES, HE WOULD HAVE THE SAME uh response that each one of us EVEN IN OUR APPROACH TO THE WORD OF EVEN GOD DEALING WITH OUR LIFE WHEN HE'S BRINGING A HEART AND A LIFE ALL THE WAY THROUGH OF JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, baptism of THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEN EVEN WHERE THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION WORKING IN OUR LIFE TO BRING US TO THE FULLNESS OF ADOPTION, IT'S THE SAME THING THAT WE LOOK AT AND SAY, "GOD, ME, &gt;&gt; HOW CAN I?" BECAUSE WHERE WHERE WE LOOK AT MANY TIMES, AND THIS IS WHERE GOD IS WORKING BY HIS WORD TO GET US TO A PLACE, IT'S NOT THAT HE HE DOESN'T WANT US TO BE AWARE OF OUR WEAKNESSES. HE DOES. BUT WHEN HIS PRESENCE IS BEING REVEALED, IT IS NOT TO TO CONDEMN US OR TO LOOK DOWN ON US, BUT IT IS TO EXPOSE OUR WEAKNESSES AND OUR NEED OF HIM. AND IF THERE'S ANY PLACE GREATER PLACE OF SAFETY, there is none other place outside OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD REVEALING HIS WORD WHERE WE CAN JUST COMPLETELY OPEN OUR HEARTS AND SAY, "LORD, ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. ME. &gt;&gt; And yet, YET THIS IS WHAT GOD IS WORKING WITH MOSES IS TO surrender those weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And certainly I will be with thee. I've sent thee and I'm going to bring you back to this mountain and you're going to worship me on now. He didn't tell Moses. He didn't tell him everything that was going to transpire between there and getting back to that mountain. &gt;&gt; If he had, it probably would have been overwhelming. YEAH, &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD FIRST TOOK A HOLD OF YOUR LIFE, IF HE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING FROM HERE TO THERE, IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMING. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS THE PROMISE. CERTAINLY, I WILL BE WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; God made real, I'll keep EVERY PROMISE. THAT'S WHAT GOD WAS MAKING known there in the burning bush. HE WAS CALLING in to Moses attention the promise that he had already made through Abraham. There's three words and the prophet would preach this message uh a couple times here and these three words are very very significant. Hearing &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; recognizing and acting on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's very it's very key because often times when we can come out of service or we get or we get away uh the enemy knows how to all of a sudden start to draw upon our minds, our hearts and other things to try to ful try to put the pressure that we forget the things that God has spoke to us &gt;&gt; that God is desiring to call forth from our lives, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so, you know, you might have been able to put the insurance bill to the side. You might have been able to put um uh the things with with job to the side. And all of a sudden, all it takes is just something just of a little trigger. And we begin to get focused upon those things. And it isn't that we shouldn't be mindful, but everything has to stay in its right priority. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD." SO, I JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS. IF A PERSON SAYS, "WELL, I'M GOING TO GET all this in order and then I'll serve God." Satan will keep you running on a rat race from now to the rapture. &gt;&gt; You you this is Listen, let me tell you something. The complexities of life, life is complex. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Uh, and we NEED TO JUST APPROACH IT IN THIS WAY AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO BE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE ME TO BE AS A as a as A SON OF GOD, as a daughter OF GOD, AS A HUSBAND, AS A WIFE, AS A FATHER OR MOTHER, WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE. I WANT TO BE WHAT YOU'VE CALLED ME TO BE, LORD." &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO US TO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT, BUT TO FOLLOW HIM. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Good preacher. So here when God speaks to our hearts uh you know he begins to hear that voice coming from from there I've heard the cries of my people and I remembered my covenant and I've come down TO DELIVER THEM. THE FIRST THING he heard God's word and he recognized it was God because it was the word and HE BE TO EXAMINE IT BY THE WORD. AND IF GOD MAKES A PROMISE IN THE WORD THEN GOD WILL BACK UP THAT PROMISE. AND HE SAID HERE HUNDREDS OF YEARS LATER HE HEARD THAT VOICE AND THAT VOICE WAS SPEAKING TO HIM WAS PURELY SCRIPTURAL. SO HE WAS IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; I wanted TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. IT'S MORE THAN JUST DOCTRINE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God is moving on a PEOPLE AND CALLING A PEOPLE THAT HE SEES CHARACTER. AND THAT CHARACTER THAT GOD SEES IS HE'S SEEING THE POTENTIAL THAT LAYS WITHIN OUR LIFE. JUST LIKE HE SAW IT IN REBECCA'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRAM SAID HE ELEAZAR WAS SEARCHING FOR A BRIDE THAT WOULD STAND STILL AND LISTEN AND LET ELEAZAR TAKE THE CLOTHING OF THE WORD AND DRESS HER FOR RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S SO GOOD. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT KIND OF A CHARACTER? A WILLINGNESS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO GOOD. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I'M TALKING ABOUT BRIDE MATERIAL FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST KNOWING THE DOCTRINES THAT WHEN WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT HERE TO UH TO JUST TO SAY WELL YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE DOCTRINES. BUT YOU KNOW THE THINGS OF IT IS IS YOU CAN KNOW THE LETTER AND MISS HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; HE IS THE LIFE IS CHARACTER. AND WHEN THE WORD BEGINS TO DEAL WITH OUR LIFE IN OUR CHARACTER AND IN OUR WALK AND IN OUR LIFE, OUR BEHAVIOR, OUR CONDUCT, AND IF WE PULL BACK, WE GOT TO EXAMINE, IS THAT GOD SPEAKING TO US? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF THIS WORD DOES NOT PRODUCE A CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER, THEN IT'S FAILED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But I say this word can't fail. &gt;&gt; It will produce a Christlike character. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. Amen. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is brother Ram says, God gives a promise and when his spirit comes, it fulfills that promise. The first thing you hear it preached, then you recognize that that's God's truth. Then you go into action. The carnal mind thinks you're just off the deep end. Let me just say this. Come back to this once again. Then you recognize here. recognize it being you hear it preached, you recognize it, then you go into action right here between these places right here. And I said this here just moments ago, but I'm going to say it as it's really coming fresh right there. Let me just tell you something. Brother Brandham recognized in Misha Walka. He heard the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He seen it was truth. &gt;&gt; But right in between here, he made a fatal mistake. He went and and brought it to his mother-in-law &gt;&gt; and it cost him. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Abraham. Now watch how the prophet will take this. And and when I say that, brother Brandham let brother Brandham left that out for you and I life story. Let let my mistakes in those things let them be stepping STONES FOR YOU. GOD ALLOWED THAT TO BE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET WAS NOT ONE THING YOU FIND ABOUT brother Brandham? He wasn't a proud man. &gt;&gt; That ain't lifting brother Brandham up cuz I'm NOT. CUZ LET ME TELL YOU, IF you read how it was before the Holy Ghost come, remember brother Brandham was always like a a a hothead. &gt;&gt; Come on. You know, you read read through read through life story. Read through the supernatural PART. EVEN WHEN THEY HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IN A SUIT LIKE THAT, YOU LOOK LIKE A PREACHER. HE WAS READY. HE SAID, "YOU take that back." &gt;&gt; Is that right? HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO EXPLODE. THAT'S WHO HE WAS. BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT CHANGED THAT? THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then that's where the prophet said to you AND I SWEETEN YOUR TEMPER WITH PRAYER. &gt;&gt; SO THIS PART HERE, THIS IS WHY THE PROPHET SAID REGARDING ABRAHAM, HE SAID ABRAHAM WHEN GOD REVEALED TO HIM ABOUT OFFERING up Isaac, he didn't even say a word to Sarah. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because Sarah had been trying to talk him out of it. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; YES. THINK ABOUT IT. HERE HE WAS. HE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING. AND THIS IS WHY THE PROPHET SAID EVEN AS THAT THAT WAS GOING OFF AND HE SAYS THAT LITTLE BUZZER THERE WAS GOING OFF IN ABRAHAM AND HE SAID EVEN WHEN ABRAHAM there walking up the MOUNTAIN AND HE GETS UP THE MOUNTAIN HE SAID HERE THE SATAN COMES AND SAYS WHAT'S Sarah going to say about this? &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM'S ALREADY SAID WE'RE GOING UP HERE TO WORSHIP. WE'RE COMING BACK OFF. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE IN BETWEEN IS GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I'M GOING INTO ACTION BECAUSE I'VE HEARD GOD'S VOICE. I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOD THAT'S SPEAKING TO ME. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I understand, friend, sometimes this right here within this, and I think we don't have to spend, you know, a month of Sundays on that that sometimes people say, "Well, God has spoke to me and this and that." And then you begin to look and you think, well, it's completely out of the word. &gt;&gt; So, who spoke to you? &gt;&gt; THIS IT HAS TO FOLLOW CHARACTERISTICS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; NOW, watch this here. Here. He's going down into Egypt. And I want you to watch how the prophet says this here. He's going down. He's heard the voice. He's recognized it and he's obeyed and he says hear uh this voice and he's obeying it and and you say, brother Bram says and you say I can't do it. Yes, YOU CAN. IF GOD SPEAKS TO YOU, RECOGNIZE IT TO be his promise AND GO INTO ACTION AND SEE WHAT GOD DOES will take over. The says, "I CAN'T WALK." YES, YOU CAN. JESUS SAID SO. THAT'S RIGHT. WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, believe you receive them. You shall HAVE THEM. MAYBE THE MAN'S GOT CANCER. HE SAYS, "I CAN'T LIVE." YES, YOU CAN. GOD SAID SO. &gt;&gt; SEE, the the THE THE ANSWER TO IT, GOD SAID SO. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SAID SO, IT'S A YES, YOU CAN. &gt;&gt; When they came to the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; HERE THEY COME TO THE RED SEA AND THEY'RE STANDING THERE. AND I WANT YOU TO remember these ARE VERY FAMILIAR PARTS WITH THEM. HERE IS GOD WITH US. &gt;&gt; HERE IS GOD. HE'S BROUGHT THEM OUT OF EGYPT. BUT REMEMBER THE PROMISE IS TO TAKE THEM IN TO the land. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; AND THEY COME HERE AND MOSES under inspiration. The people I want you to catch this friends. The people were, "Oh my, WE'RE GOING TO DIE. OH MY GOODNESS. WE'RE GOING TO BE OVERTHROWN. AND HERE WE ARE. YOU BROUGHT US OUT HERE. THEY'RE THEY'RE SEEING IT AND IT'S FEARFUL. IT'S TREMBLING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES STANDS THERE WITH THE PROMISE OF GOD IN HIS HEART. AND HE SAYS, "THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU AND YOU SHALL hold your peace." AND HE CRIES AND GOD SPEAKS TO MOSES, "SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT THEY GO FORWARD." &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE TO GO BUT FORWARD. WE CAN'T GO BACKWARD. WE GOT TO GO FORWARD. WE CAN'T GO BACKWARD IN OUR THOUGHTS. WE CAN'T GO BACKWARD IN OUR ATTITUDE. WHATEVER THAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU, KEEP GOING FROM THERE. &gt;&gt; MAKE ANOTHER STEP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THAT. KEEP GOING. &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER SAMUEL, THERE'S OPPOSITION. THAT IS ONLY TO TRY TO HINDER YOU AND GET YOUR ATTENTION OFF OF THE REALITY. GOD IS WITH US. So good. &gt;&gt; God didn't give him a map down in Egypt and say, "Here, here's some tapes and books. Figure it out." &gt;&gt; He didn't do that. &gt;&gt; But God accompanied his people &gt;&gt; all the way through all of their ups and downs. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Now, notice this on the Red Sea. I love how the prophet places this in the supersigned message. He said, "At the Red Sea, he showed that he would make a way for those who were trying to do right and follow his commandment. No matter what cuts it off, God proved at the Red Sea and gave a sign that he could open up the sea. &gt;&gt; In every temptation, he'll make a way of escape. &gt;&gt; You say, "Mother don't believe it. Daddy don't believe it. The church don't believe it." I don't care who don't believe it. If you believe it, God will make a way of escape. &gt;&gt; HE GAVE A SIGN THAT HE WOULD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, THIS IS YOUR SIGN. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS MADE A WAY of escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YET, IT'S VERY HUMBLE. IT'S VERY HUMBLE. YOU YOU KNOW, EVERY EVERY SIGN THAT GOD DISPLAYS AND HE MAKES AND HE GIVES FORTH, IT REQUIRES HUMILITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT SIGN. AND SURRENDER TO WHAT GOD IS SAYING BEHIND THAT SIGN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's speaking through that. &gt;&gt; Watch the Bible says they were on their way straight to the promised land where God promised them and the Red Sea shut them off and they got in trouble. They didn't know what TO DO. GOD SHOWED THAT HE WOULD make a way of escape in every temptation and every trial. Right? &gt;&gt; I don't have to ask for hands. We've been there. &gt;&gt; And if we haven't, if we're not, remember, if we're not in a trial, we've just come out of one or we're heading into one. &gt;&gt; But God PROMISED HE'LL MAKE A way of escape. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and it's not about our flesh escaping. It's about his word coming to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't quit smoking, take God one time. &gt;&gt; You can't quit lying, can't quit stealing, &gt;&gt; can't quit having temper, take God with you one time. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel like going to church and you can't GET ANYWHERE, TAKE GOD WITH YOU ONCE. TAKE HIS PROMISE. HE PROVED IT AT THE RED SEA THAT HE'LL MAKE A WAY OF ESCAPE. GOD HAS GIVEN MANY A SIGN. SO WHAT WAS THE SIGN WAS TO BUILD FAITH IN THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; THEN AT THE RED SEA, THIS IS WHERE ISRAEL WHERE DAVID WROTE IN PSALM 78, THEY MISUNDERSTOOD. &gt;&gt; THEY JUST KEPT ON LIKE A HOG UNDERNEATH TREES, APPLES DROPPING AND YOU KNOW JUST EATING UP THE APPLES AND AND JUST WALKING THROUGH THE RED SEA. THEY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE, WAIT A MINUTE HERE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHAT DID GOD SAY THROUGH MOSES? THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU. HOLD YOUR PEACE &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN THEY COME THROUGH THE LAND WHEN THE NEXT OPPOSITION OR THEY COME THROUGH THE RED SEA AND THE NEXT OPPOSITION THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU THAT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING OF WELL THE PAST IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE A SIGN THAT GOD WAS LETTING ISRAEL KNOW I'LL BE WITH YOU THROUGH EVERY TRIAL through every temptation &gt;&gt; so the previous listen now the previous experiences in your life that God has brought you through. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is what has increased your patience now &gt;&gt; to where you can stand, listen, you can stand in trials now that you never would have been able or fit to stand in prior to. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying when I say fit, I'm not talking about you losing the Holy Spirit. I'm just talking about things that would just so overwhelm you. But even in the midst of it, there's things that we do feel overwhelmed, but there's an anchor that holds us and and there's a there there's a maturing. See what it's God with us that's bringing us along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that, friends. &gt;&gt; Very, very thankful for that. When you when we consider that of how every every believer passing through the Red Sea, let me just skip a few things and get to this get to a couple points here. Satan also wanted to break that of with us. &gt;&gt; When Israel even after knowing what was right, ten commandments so forth, then and God had already spoke chapters before and here Israel makes a golden calf. And it was Moses, Christ and Moses, and I want you to catch this, that stood in the breach and in the gap for the people. &gt;&gt; It's quite amazing how that when Moses goes down there, the part of a man, it flares up and he threw the commandments. out of frustration, &gt;&gt; out of anger. Is that right? Brother Ram tells us that to that place that was temper, &gt;&gt; right? But isn't isn't it tremendous how that Satan's desire was to try to break that away where Moses it would break that ele that element of God with us because you see it was Christ in Moses that was God bringing the people to the promise of the hour. &gt;&gt; Right? And Satan does his best to try to bring discouragement. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; And I want you to see it like this. Brother Brandon will take countless points throughout the message of how that you said people wonder, "Brother Brandon, why are you still going out among the Pentecostals? They're wrong." And brother Bram will say in another place greatest file perseverance on and on throughout the message he said they were the wrongest that's a word but he says that's who I'm to go to. I want you to catch this. The prophet had got to such a place that he had lost the feeling for the people. He had become I'm talking about brother Brandham now. He had become frustrated, right? Why? Because it's just like they were rejecting. It's like they weren't they weren't coming in and following along. But let me just tell you something. God didn't excuse that behavior. &gt;&gt; And neither could God use him as long as he was frustrated or discouraged or looking down on the people. &gt;&gt; Can't be used. But you see how Satan would like to break that? He'd like to break that in homes. He'd like to break that. Let's bring it down. He'd like to break that in the church &gt;&gt; to where it's just oh my oh my I tell you the word's being preached and why isn't this Listen, &gt;&gt; you've come here individually not to look at the church. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I can see the needs, but I've come here to feed. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you daily it's taking the needs and daily and weekly God let my heart be right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because otherwise it can be of no help. &gt;&gt; What what is that? THAT'S SATAN'S DESIRE TO BREAK GOD WITH US. &gt;&gt; GOD'S DESIRE IS TO HELP US. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE I SAID, IT'S VERY EASY TO GET DISCOURAGED. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO JUST LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING and you can see this and you can see THAT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU IT'LL START RIGHT IN YOUR HOME. IT'LL START RIGHT IN YOUR FAMILY. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHAT WE NEED WITHIN WHAT WHAT IS NEEDED WITHIN THIS HOUR IS TO REMEMBER WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR LIFE AND OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. GOD IS WITH US. IT'S NOT US THAT'S BRINGING RESULTS OR THE CHANGE. IT IS GOD THROUGH US. &gt;&gt; THAT IS SO GOOD. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T LET MY WIT BE SMOKY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TRIM IT LORD. THIS IS LAMP TRIMMING TIME SO THAT THE LIGHT MAY BURN WITH CLARITY, intensity &gt;&gt; because it's hard to express and have the joy of the Lord and have frustration at the same time. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; It won't. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; It won't. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And listen to me. Having frustration is not anybody's fault. &gt;&gt; It's not the people's fault. It's not your family's fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you have frustration, it's because of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you have to stay in the right channel. And let me say, let me listen. Oh, brother Samuel, if I was Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham being a prophet, &gt;&gt; didn't even catch it when it was taking place. He's preaching the seals. This had already started. A powerful series of messages. It had already started in his life. And being a prophet, you know what that shows over and over? What brothers tell us, brother? Oh, brother Brandham, I guess you don't have to. You know, God just shows you everything. He brings it right down to us. He says, "No, he doesn't. I have to work it out just like you do." &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Brandham, he does he doesn't even catch it until he's there and God working with him through the seven peaks, through the, you know, seeing seeing that of the bum on the side of the road on on you. You understand? and standing in the gap. But what God's doing, God's working with him, and God brings him back into that place to where first of all, he had to recognize, I've lost a feeling, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And remember over and over, even with the services I spoke to on Thursday nights, you can't serve God unless you're willing to serve his people. &gt;&gt; Right? and the only way we can serve. So, let me let me just move on in this part of it that it it's Satan's desire to try to bring discouragement. &gt;&gt; And when I say it's our fault, I want to say it like this. It's not it's not something that even as I mentioned that with brother Bham that all of a sudden you're going to come to a spot and say, "Oh, I recognize it. Oh, I recognize it." It just it can come in. soul to a place. And you know when you start to catch it is when you recognize, wait a minute, I'm complaining. Uh &gt;&gt; oh, &gt;&gt; I'm complaining. That's a heart issue. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, friends? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's a heart issue. When you begin to complain, even in your home, it's a heart. Oh no, it's my husband. Oh, it's my wife. Oh, no. You You're missing it. because you'll never win them if your heart is not right. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; See, see how Satan wants to block God with us. &gt;&gt; It takes the presence of God moving with us to bring us into the promises. What if Jesus had said, "You guys arguing over who's going to be the greatest." Such carnality. Lord, give me some give me some people that are got a little bit more oomph to them. &gt;&gt; Got a little bit more understanding over here arguing about this. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing that's went through all the way through the scriptures. Humanity. Humanity. But you know what? All of that within humanity, it didn't stop God from dwelling with his people. Because let me tell you something. God's got a vision that's greater than our vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's important that we are in tune with God's vision. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; So now within this part of even how God had let Israel know, I'm going to send my angel before you. He'll bring you into into that place. I think that's a that's a scripture. Sorry. As God said here, I'll send an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring thee into the place that I prepared. Beware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke him not for he'll not pardon your transgressions. For my name is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I'll be an en enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries. Here was here was Joshua and Caleb. And here they are after them seeing and witnessing the evidence of what God had spoke through the prophet and they were witnesses of it. And when the rest looked at this sign of a land that flows with milk and honey, they forgot. They were not looking at what they should have been focused on. God is with us. &gt;&gt; God has brought us safe thus far. But instead, it was looking at the giants, looking at the obstacles. Friends, anytime we get our focus upon all the obstacles, all the why, and all the can't be, and all of this, we're getting our eyes off of the God who's with us. &gt;&gt; The God who is with us is the God who will take us all the way through. &gt;&gt; God being right there present to lead and to guide. And then here they come. They come to to this moment with Balum. It says after here they come to this moment with Balum and there were those that go after you know and Balum you know Balam is just looking down upon the people all he can see is their faults. &gt;&gt; He got up to he got up to a place. This is why that when we look at this and you you hear you know as I said within things where things begin to pick out and this and pick and pick. I just tell you when when when picking is going on, we're in the wrong position. &gt;&gt; Balam was was HE WAS UP IN A HIGH PLACE AND LOOKING DOWN ON THEM. AND ANYTIME I DON'T CARE LIKE BROTHER RAM SAYS, I DON'T CARE WHAT WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE, THEY WERE WRONG. BUT WHAT BALAM FAILED TO SEE WAS THE PILLAR OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T GOD EXCUSING THEIR WRONG. BUT IF ALL YOU CAN SEE IS A BUNCH OF FAILURES, YOU'RE NOT LOOKING THROUGH THE PILLAR OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS WHAT LOOKS DOWN AND THERE CAN BE EVER SO MUCH BROKENNESS &gt;&gt; CAN BE EVER SO MUCH WELL I DON'T SEE THIS AND I DON'T SEE THAT AND I DON'T SEE THIS AND I DON'T SEE THAT and I see this and I SEE THIS AND I SEE THIS. ARE YOU SEEING anything in the word? &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go. IS THERE ANYTHING? BECAUSE SEE, THROUGH ALL OF THESE COMPLEXITIES OF THINGS, GOD'S WORKING IN OUR CHARACTER AS INDIVIDUALS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be patient, to be temperant, and to all this because certainly God has certainly patient with us. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's certainly been patient with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God working, God with us, right? There guiding and bringing them along. And so here when Israel did they come into that place, brother Ram just said it like this. He said regarding Balum, he said what he failed to see was the smitten rock and the brass serpent and that pillar of fire. He tried to judge them from a moral standpoint. He failed to see the higher call of God by grace, by election. They were in line and with God's word. Did you catch that? They were they were in line with God's word. What are you saying, brother Samuel? I'm saying that the word that calls is the word sufficient to do the work. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, it's God working. Same God. Let me I'm trying to just tie this here. T just a couple more points. We've seen this with Abraham and Sarah. Taken that in a few services. How that God was right there with Abraham. He calls him out of of of the valley of Shennar. And God works with Abraham through all of his ups, through all of his downs, AND THEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when Sarah is in a place uh and all through all of their misunderstandings. I don't want to dwell upon that portion, BUT IT WAS GOD THAT WAS WITH THEM THE WHOLE time for what purpose? IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SPOKEN. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; What if the first time and wonder what if the first time when Abram doesn't even he doesn't fully leave out of the land of Shener? Oh. Oh, I knew he wouldn't come very far. Well, he's just like a lot of other people. &gt;&gt; What faith is that? How can you You can't You can't have fa You got TO HAVE FAITH. FAITH IN WHAT? IT'S NOT FAITH IN PEOPLE. IT'S FAITH IN GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND ABRAHAM HERE HE IS WALKING ALONG AND GOD AND GOD DEALING WITH HIS LIFE. GOD KNOWS HOW TO DEAL WITH EVERY ONE OF US. THIS IS WHY THE WORD IS SUPREME TO WORK AND TO MINISTER AND TO BRING CONVICTION TO DEAL WITH OUR HEARTS TO DEAL WITH OUR LIVES JUST IN THE RIGHT SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is why God &gt;&gt; will work right through his word. He's a faithful father. And the attribute of pastors that is much different than evangelists and so forth. Evangelist is like the uncle that comes in town &gt;&gt; you know and sometimes the teacher is like the you know we we all understand that friends you know but but the pastor let me just SAY BECAUSE WITH THE PASTOR a person says well I I hear I I hear you KNOW IT PREACHED ON this and we shouldn't do this and we need to LAY THIS ASIDE. THEN I'M HEARING YOU KNOW IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD TAKING CARE OF IT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S OUR FATHER MINISTERING TO US WHAT WE HAVE NEED OF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T COME AND HIS CHILDREN TO TOTALLY WIPE THE SPIRIT OUT OF THEIR LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT SAID PROVOKE YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO ANGER. &gt;&gt; HARDNESS WILL KILL THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW CORRECT YOU ARE WITH THE WORD. HARDNESS WILL DRIVE AWAY THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; It's not about being correct. It's about being right. in correcting God's word, correcting your spirit, correcting your heart? &gt;&gt; Because hardness breeds resentment. &gt;&gt; And God does not work with his children to bring about hardness. This is why that God working with us as his family. There's times to sit down. There's times to talk. There's times to encourage. And to catch catching that time, it's catching the season just like it is with your with with your own family. You have to catch that moment. You have to catch that season. It's not the same pattern all the time. It's catching that season and that moment of even of even as they get older and you know there's no longer going down to the basement you know and taking genuine leather and and yet still even talking then uh you know and really working why what the purpose and all that but even then it's working with them to to minister to what THEY HAVE NEED OF AND NOT JUST EVEN OF SOMETIMES the things that is done that you think oh dear God but don't respond in hardness &gt;&gt; because God's not hard &gt;&gt; no sir &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; God even knows the time to talk about certain things. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can think, "Oh, you know, it's been like at times my wife and I and uh oh, there she is. Don't worry, I'm not going to say anything bad." But there's even in those times because you know what? We've never passed this way before that I can look and say, "Not now. Not now." And you know what? Let me just say this. She's done the same thing to me. She told me, "Honey, no. No. Just wait." I said, "Thank God we're thank God. God knows what you're doing putting it together." You know, because there's certain little things and you know that for me and there's certain little things for her. But you know what? In listening to that, I found that to be God. &gt;&gt; I found that to be God. I'd love to be able to say, "Man, I listen to it every time. Every time was perfect." No, I I couldn't be able to say it like that if I hadn't made the mistakes. &gt;&gt; But you know what? When you make mistakes and you recognize you make mistakes, be quick to apologize. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And humble yourself. Because you know what that's also doing? That's teaching your children of what the life of the Holy Spirit is all about. &gt;&gt; It's not about, well, I know. I know everything. I've got everything right. Everything I've done, you know, it's just like it's like God touching Earth. No, that's not true. That's not true. That's that's false. Oh my. Let me leave with this. Here's Elijah standing on Mount Carmel and here the children of Israel are gathered together. And even after here they are, there's you don't see any courage. You don't see anybody stepping forward. Nobody stepping out on the word. They they they believed it. You see, there were 7,000 that believed &gt;&gt; Jehovah God. &gt;&gt; But they needed to see God. &gt;&gt; They needed to have that reality. God with us. And it would bring a courage in their hearts. They had been told, brother Ram dramatized it like this in a true sign overlook look as though Jehovah doesn't care. And he says absolutely Jehovah cares about his word. &gt;&gt; And Elijah showed us the simplicity bringing the stones back together, getting the wood in order and the sacrifice in order, laying everything according to the order of the word. I'm so grateful in this hour that God through the ministry of Elijah, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; showed us how to put our lives in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for that? &gt;&gt; It it is God working under that to put to show the order. Even the order of a home, order of family, order of marriage order. God showed it's all under this order. It must all be founded upon the altar of God. So the things that we want, we're desiring God to come to things we're praying about, things we're looking for. But if we'll follow God's order, sometimes that order, it might require humility. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Well, it will always require that, but it may require that of humility. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To repent. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because we understand that repentance is not just sorry and I'm sorry and I continue on. It's real repentance. Real repentance is sorrowful. Real repentance uh as I said even when things are are made right or wrong and forgive me and you are extending that out you you recognize that anytime there's repentance then there's got to be trust rebuilt maybe with persons or parts around us. Is that right? Well, we got quiet there. You see, many times we're looking say, "Well, hey, wait a minute here. If I've repented, then you just forgive me." And we go on. There's a truth to that. Forgiveness will lead to trust. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Bring forth fruits meat for repentance." &gt;&gt; In other words, what can bring confidence that that repentance was godly? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So sometimes this and then this is where all of that comes that all comes to play and then it's coming into this place God right there with Israel and here the fire of God after all the water after all is poured on here God comes down and vindicates his word that he's given Elijah and he vindicates that word I'm with you. What did that do? Elijah didn't see it. Elijah didn't see the 7,000 coming out of the caves. Elijah didn't see that. It was God that had to tell him after he took off running. God had to tell him, "Hey, I've got 7,000. You're not the only one. You feel all alone. You feel You feel that you're the only one." He wasn't running him down because that's a real feeling. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? LIKE, LORD, I'M THE ONLY ONE. I'M THE ONLY ONE STANDING FOR TRUTH. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S STANDING. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S RIGHT. OH, GOD. I'M THE ONLY ONE. AND GOD HAD TO SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I USED YOU AS A CHANNEL &gt;&gt; TO COME up there and for the WORD TO BE PUT BACK IN PUT IN ITS PLACE AND THE PEOPLE HAVE ROSE WITH COURAGE IN THEIR HEARTS BECAUSE YOU WERE A CHANNEL FOR ME TO COME DOWN THROUGH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I think you're SEEING VERY CLEARLY GOD'S CALLED US TO BE A CHANNEL. CALLED US TO BE CHANNELS, BUT HOW EVEN THE ENEMY WOULD LIKE TO GET IN THERE AND hinder that channel. &gt;&gt; Because even throughout the congregation, WE HAVE LIVES, WE HAVE HEARTS, lives that HAVE JUST COME TO KNOW THE LORD. LIVES ARE IN JOURNEY, LIVES THAT ARE MAYBE YOU MIGHT SAY, "WELL, THIS PERSON'S BEEN WALKING FOR 15 YEARS OR 20 YEARS OR 30 YEARS." BUT LOOK BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND LOOK DOWN AND SAY, "A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We must have that. We must have that &gt;&gt; because that's what God has for us. It's God with us. And God being with us, it brings us to that place for him to fulfill his word in our life. So God just doesn't just do something. God just didn't do something in the lives of the disciples, but he he manifested himself. He walked with them. He was right there with them the whole way. This word, what God is even desiring to do in our lives, he's right here with us to bring us all the way. &gt;&gt; No matter the obstacles, because we're going to have them. &gt;&gt; You're going to have opposition. You're even going to have times of up and down. David said he knows my in- and-outs. He knows my up uprising and my downside. He knows that. But God also knows and has confidence in his word. His word knows how to straight line things. &gt;&gt; He knows how to bring things right in line and bring things right in order. And sometimes God will speak and deal with things right through the word. And it will be word by word by word by word by word. And then there's other times the Holy Spirit will come and it's God making known his word, God making known his promise. And it just calls to the person, calls to the individual's heart, calling to our lives, hey, it's time. It's time to rise and take the promise of God for your life. It's time. It's time to rise. And you know what? The only thing that can actually deal with and dismiss every excuse, every fear, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; is the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Because there's no other, as the prophet said, and I close with this, there's no other higher court of appeal than the presence of God. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; When God has spoken, don't look at yourself. Look at the word &gt;&gt; and go to action upon that word. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I might be in the flesh. That's the devil. You go upon the word. You've heard the word. You recognize this is God speaking. You recognize it. You go into action upon that word and take a hold of that word and watch what God will do through your life. &gt;&gt; Why? God with us. &gt;&gt; See, the God that's right here with us is the God who comes in us. And yet, he's right here still right with us, guiding us all the way. It's him that's revealing, even showing up our weaknesses and our deficiencies. But isn't it incredible? He's as a faithful father, he's not doing this in a way to dishearten us. &gt;&gt; If you feel disheartened, it's not the voice of God. &gt;&gt; God's voice is not trying to take anything from you. As a matter of fact, he's trying to let you know what he already has for you. &gt;&gt; That's why he's here to encourage you. Is God with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, how thankful we are. I Lord as I've just spoke Lord just from my heart here this morning many things Lord that been very very present Lord as we've been looking at these uh points Lord of being fully consecrated to the word by the spirit and just Lord just to see that that aspect your prophet would would catch it even among uh the people that would even be there to where their hesitancy at times to just grab a hold of the word and and just to take what the word was saying. Lord, I'm so glad that you you have provided what we have need of. Lord, every one of us, how many times as your prophet when he takes that of Abraham and Sarah and he brings it right down to our lives, he said, "How many times?" Like he said, "God would have killed Sarah if she hadn't been part of Abraham." He said, "Oh, how many times would we have been dead?" even things Lord that we have looked at in our life and the words speaking to our hearts. Oh, it it may not be where we would where we would see it like Sarah laughed in her heart, but yet when the word comes to speak to us, then all of a sudden, Lord, there's that voice and that thought, "Yeah, but you tried before. Yeah, but you said before. And then the thought, well, how how many times are are you going to have prayer? How many? But Lord, I pray may in your presence right here. Your name shall be called and is called Emmanuel, God with us. It's in your presence. like your prophet as he said there in that message is super sign. Take God with you. If something that's troubling, maybe it's a besetting sin, maybe it's a weight, take God with you. Put it into God's hands. Maybe there's something that Lord that we just don't know how to get beyond. But your grace is sufficient. Father, you accompany your word. And where your word is preached, the Holy Spirit moves, oh God. No greater move, Lord, that we could could ask and be thankful for it than that our hearts would be moved, Lord. For Lord, through that it'll set everything else in motion. I ask right now, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord God, may you just pierce through every doubt of darkness, every doubt of unbelief. Oh God, may every heart, Lord, the request that they would have on their hearts, needs that they have, petitions, Lord, promises. I pray, Father, may it be focused in upon your voice, looking unto Jesus, who's the author and the finisher of our faith. Lord, you're right here with us to guide us, you've never forsaken us. And even if Lord that we've maybe gotten away from you, maybe like your prophet said, we get the feeling that maybe we've got a right for this or a right this. And he said the spirit of God, the dove will just take its flight. But it don't go very far. It just goes up on that limb and the only thing that we have to do is become a lamb again. &gt;&gt; Invite the dove of the Holy Spirit. invite him back to lead us, Lord. I pray may you give grace to every heart to just realize, Lord, and just to just pull and draw upon that simplicity, your desire for fellowship, your desire to be right there with us, Lord, to not only to be with us, but to walk in us and to bring us into that place that you prepared. I'm asking that Lord that you would help me as the pastor of this assembly. Lord, help me Lord that Lord that I would have the patience that's needed for this season, for this hour. Lord, you know, over and over I as I come to you, Lord, I see Lord in my own self that need of you, Lord. Oh, I know, Lord. I've I've said that over and over, but I just see Lord, within this time, oh God, as I've asked you, Lord, you can have my hands, but I want you to have my heart. I want you to, Lord, everything, every part, every every aspect of my life. Just Lord God, I commit it, Lord, all to you. Because when my heart is right, then Lord, the hands, they'll be right. There's a lot of battles, Lord, that we come through. There's a lot of things that can be discouraging. I don't just speak, Lord, as as a pastor, but Lord, I know I'm speaking to families, father, mother, husband, wife, so forth. Oh God, help us to be in tune. Help us to be in tune, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, so temper us in this moment. Oh God, it's in your presence, Lord, where our hearts are softened. It's in your presence, Lord. Help us. We don't want to go through motions. We want to enter in saturate our lives. Lord &gt;&gt; with the due of heaven. Lord, &gt;&gt; forgive us Lord of Father the slackness. Forgive us Lord of Dear God just just allowing and and not recognizing. But I believe your presence is here to help us to catch these things, Lord. As we have families, we have hearts, we have loved ones, Lord, there's others right here in the assembly, right here, each and every one of us. God, use us how you would see fit that others might see you to see you. Grant it Lord I pray. We love you Lord. We thank you for your mercies. &gt;&gt; Oh grant it Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
