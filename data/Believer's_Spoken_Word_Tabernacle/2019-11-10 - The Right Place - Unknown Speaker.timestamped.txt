[43:22] [Applause]
[43:24] [Music]
[43:29] [Applause]
[43:33] [Music]
[43:37] praise the name of the Lord if you have
[43:40] your Bibles this morning we want to go
[43:42] right to the book of Philemon I want to
[43:46] say this I know some are a number of
[43:48] people that stayed down after the
[43:50] wedding yesterday and just had just such
[43:54] a wonderful time and so happy for mother
[43:59] Brian sister Mariah and so just just
[44:05] good - it's also good to be back home I
[44:10] feel like I just got out of a suitcase
[44:13] there on Friday night and the boy said
[44:16] dad I bet you're tired in a hotel said I
[44:18] am I said I'm not much for many how but
[44:21] I I'm just I'm glad to be back home so
[44:26] good to see each and every one of you
[44:27] and we just want to look here in the
[44:30] word of the Lord this morning for a few
[44:31] moments and so glad to have brother
[44:34] Jerry here with us and I think the Lord
[44:35] willing he's going back on Tuesday
[44:37] mornings so we just just want to ask the
[44:40] Lord just to be with him and just
[44:43] refreshing for all the sacrifice that
[44:44] has been made so here in the book of
[44:49] Philemon I want to just start with verse
[44:50] with verse 8 is where I'd like to start
[44:53] with and when we look at this this this
[44:59] book for layman I know I've ministered
[45:02] out of it before and different things
[45:04] but when you look at it you realize that
[45:07] that Paul would take great great pains
[45:11] to write this letter personally to
[45:13] Philemon who was a believer this this
[45:16] letter accompanied the letter that was
[45:19] sent to the Colossians search that we
[45:22] know as the book of Colossians but Paul
[45:24] would see fit that this would be wrote
[45:26] personally to Philemon who was a brother
[45:28] who was the one who actually had the
[45:31] church enclosure in his home because
[45:33] remember they didn't have public they
[45:36] didn't have buildings like we do now
[45:37] that was until about 300 years later
[45:41] but they would gather there in their
[45:43] homes or in public places and this is
[45:45] where they had church so here is his
[45:48] flamin he's roped Paul is writing to him
[45:50] and I just want to pick it up in verse 8
[45:52] he's commended him and talked about his
[45:55] character and now he writes to him and
[45:57] says wherefore though I might be much
[46:00] bold
[46:00] in Christ to enjoin thee that which is
[46:05] convenient yet for love's sake
[46:07] I rather beseech thee being such an one
[46:11] as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner
[46:15] of Jesus Christ in that tremendous Paul
[46:19] is actually in prison at the time that
[46:21] he's writing this but Paul did not say I
[46:24] am a prisoner of Rome he realized the
[46:28] circumstances that he was in they were
[46:31] not going to dictate his joy and who he
[46:34] was Paul said I'm here this is not an
[46:38] accident but I am a prisoner of Jesus
[46:41] Christ
[46:41] I'll beseech thee verse 10 for my son
[46:44] honest honest whom i have begotten in my
[46:49] bonds which in times past was to the
[46:52] unprofitable but now profitable to thee
[46:56] and to me whom I have sent again thou
[47:00] therefore receive him that is mine own
[47:03] bowels my heart's affection whom I would
[47:06] have retained with me that in thy stead
[47:09] he might have ministered unto me in the
[47:12] bonds of the gospel but without thy mind
[47:15] would I do nothing that by benefit
[47:18] should not be as it were of necessity
[47:21] but willingly for perhaps I want you to
[47:25] look at this verse for perhaps he
[47:27] therefore departed for a season that
[47:29] thou should astre sieve him forever
[47:33] not now as a servant but above a servant
[47:38] a brother beloved especially to me but
[47:42] how much more unto thee both in the
[47:44] flesh and in the Lord if thou count me
[47:47] therefore a partner receive him as my
[47:52] self if he have wronged thee or Oh at
[47:56] the art put that on mine account I Paul
[48:00] have written it with mine own hand I
[48:02] will repay it I'll be it I do not say to
[48:05] the how thou owest unto me even thy own
[48:09] self
[48:10] besides the a brother let me have joy of
[48:14] the in the Lord refresh my bowels in the
[48:16] Lord having confidence in thy obedience
[48:19] I wrote unto thee knowing that thou will
[48:22] also do more than I say amen may God
[48:27] bless you bless the reading of the word
[48:28] your being seated you know just just
[48:35] something just struck my heart Lea I was
[48:41] reading through this portion just was
[48:44] directed back here and reading through
[48:45] this portion of scripture and you know
[48:50] when we look at this with a personal
[48:53] letter that is wrote on behalf of
[48:56] Philemon here he is or behalf of Anissa
[48:58] --mess it's wrote to Philemon and it's
[49:00] on behalf of a runaway escaped slave and
[49:04] you you you're aware would you read the
[49:06] New Testament where Paul would write
[49:08] even in the book of Corinthians that
[49:10] every man abide in the calling wherewith
[49:14] he was called and Paul would write in
[49:16] many of the different epistles that you
[49:18] had brothers and sisters setting within
[49:21] the church and you would have those who
[49:24] were servants and those who were masters
[49:26] and it wasn't the stigma or the
[49:29] connotation that we would maybe have in
[49:31] our mind from some of the things that
[49:33] are tried to be presented to us here
[49:35] within you know recent years and other
[49:37] things it wasn't it wasn't in that
[49:39] manner but yet Paul himself as a matter
[49:41] of fact you traveled to many of the
[49:42] other countries even when I've been to
[49:44] the Philippines and I've been to other
[49:45] places you find many times where it's
[49:47] not uncommon for them to have servants
[49:50] within their home and it becomes a
[49:52] manner and means of employment for
[49:54] somebody to be there and when you we
[49:57] consider this how Paul would write about
[49:59] masters and servants and how that you
[50:02] one is to conduct themselves and how
[50:04] they're to have their place and that we
[50:06] are truly indeed brothers and sisters in
[50:08] the Lord I look at the setting within
[50:11] this of where that Anissa --mess here he
[50:15] is Paul is in is in is in prison far
[50:20] away from where oh nice or nice Amos and
[50:24] Philemon are residing but when Anissa
[50:28] mmus here he is is stolen from his
[50:31] master and he and he actually departs
[50:34] and it begins to he flees and you know
[50:37] the reality is is that I don't know what
[50:40] kind of a man then onesimus was all
[50:43] together I don't know what the Bible
[50:45] does not tell us and even in history
[50:47] accounts of all together what type of a
[50:50] man did he have a shady track record I
[50:53] don't know but there is something about
[50:56] it that there was that which Paul
[50:59] himself wasn't the anisa mmus was not
[51:02] unknown to Paul Paul knew him and to
[51:06] think about when onesimus would would
[51:08] would take off and he would run from
[51:11] what he has done you know you can't help
[51:14] but wonder how that Onesimus no doubt
[51:16] was having to look over his shoulder
[51:18] everywhere he was going because you know
[51:22] there's something about it when a person
[51:24] is guilty
[51:25] they feel like everybody else knows
[51:27] their guilt it's something about it that
[51:30] no matter where they go they just seem
[51:32] in English and so they've got their head
[51:34] over their shoulder and there's an
[51:35] unrest there's a nervousness there's a
[51:38] that which comes about their life that's
[51:40] an unsettledness and there's no doubt
[51:42] about it that Onesimus was home that he
[51:45] was on the run and Oney tzimmes did not
[51:47] and there's no doubt he did not realize
[51:50] that where he was heading that there was
[51:53] going to be a man who would know him but
[51:56] more importantly than Paul knowing him
[51:58] there was a there was an event that was
[52:01] going to take place in his life that
[52:03] would bring a change that would be
[52:06] eternal he did not realize this he was
[52:10] just trying to run away and you know you
[52:12] think about it from the very beginning
[52:14] when
[52:14] the fall came in the garden it is always
[52:17] within the nature of man to want to hide
[52:21] himself from the presence of God when he
[52:25] knows he cannot stand in God's presence
[52:27] justified he wants to run from it then
[52:30] in reality to understand this that's why
[52:33] they that's why when the presence of God
[52:35] is moving in and a service you watch how
[52:37] that spirits themselves will get anxious
[52:40] and get nervous and calls people to do
[52:43] certain things the same services where
[52:46] the Holy Ghost is falling and people are
[52:49] being filled with the Holy Ghost let's
[52:50] say on this side there are Devils rising
[52:53] up right over here I've witnessed it
[52:55] again and again within meetings and the
[52:58] witness said that even how that you know
[53:00] Satan sometimes will will get up on when
[53:02] people need to really be aware of the
[53:05] presence of God and give themselves to
[53:08] the Lord who can help them with in that
[53:10] moment but there's something about it
[53:12] that fear will arise up and the reality
[53:15] is is we in in with the Lord we have
[53:18] nothing to be afraid of if there's
[53:21] anyone that can help us and truly the
[53:24] only one who ever can is the Lord Jesus
[53:27] himself there's other people who can
[53:30] talk to you they could appease you but
[53:32] there's nobody that can bring the
[53:34] settlement rupee's elect the Lord Jesus
[53:37] himself can give and I and I wonder you
[53:41] know when the nisi mist comes into this
[53:43] time if no doubt you know he's looking
[53:45] around and he probably thinks you know
[53:47] Here I am in this place and my nobody's
[53:50] gonna know me I can start Life all over
[53:52] but the reality is it wouldn't matter
[53:54] where he goes his situation goes with
[53:58] him well I'm gonna preach now that's why
[54:02] sometimes you see friends the the the
[54:04] real reality is not so much in a person
[54:07] changing their location out here it's
[54:10] getting into the right place in Christ
[54:13] you know you can change from church to
[54:15] church to church but the reality is
[54:17] you've got to get in Christ if not the
[54:22] same things happen
[54:24] pattern repeats itself given time and
[54:27] situations it will only continue to
[54:30] repeat you cannot there's only one that
[54:33] can break that pattern and that is the
[54:36] Lord Jesus Christ and coming into the
[54:39] right place and that's what I want to
[54:42] talk about this morning the right place
[54:45] only tzimmes did not realize it but he
[54:48] had arrived at the right place here was
[54:52] a man that he knew a nice Ennis and I
[54:56] wonder how it was when Paul would say on
[54:58] these Simmons I wonder if he looked
[55:00] around and thought maybe there's
[55:01] somebody else here that's the main that
[55:03] as well because they even to have the
[55:05] mention of his name
[55:07] it would mean somebody knows him and
[55:11] knows his situation knows his background
[55:15] knows his past but Paul was one that
[55:19] knew what it was to be forgiven Paul was
[55:23] one who you know went on ISA mister
[55:26] there there was such an accompanying
[55:28] presence that Paul was not one to take
[55:31] on nice him ascend and just say well you
[55:34] know we love you in this and that and he
[55:36] would continue on in the same condition
[55:38] but there was that we understand that
[55:41] Paul had to had the Ministry of the
[55:44] gospel of Jesus Christ of the true
[55:47] atonement to where that he would be able
[55:50] to minister to honest honest what he
[55:53] actually needed to lift that
[55:55] condemnation over his life and be able
[55:59] to place within that life the real
[56:03] reality of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:06] to wear how nice in this was no longer
[56:10] he wasn't just going to be forgiven but
[56:13] there had to come a change in his life
[56:15] because if you just forgiving there is a
[56:18] there is a point where the pattern can
[56:21] come right back again there's got to be
[56:23] one who can break the pattern for us it
[56:28] becomes a sample and a cycle is meant to
[56:31] be broken
[56:32] and there's only one that can break that
[56:34] and it takes the Lord Himself to come
[56:37] down into that heart to tie us back in
[56:40] to where we were chosen in Christ before
[56:44] the foundation of the world a new
[56:47] creation is an ad is an act of Almighty
[56:50] God coming down into that life and
[56:53] bringing a change to where that person
[56:56] is not trying to be different they're
[56:59] not trying to be good there is a life
[57:02] that has entered in there that is not
[57:05] them who's living any longer but it is
[57:08] Christ who is living his old life
[57:11] through them oh girl repeated God I'll
[57:17] think of this here on Intimus he comes
[57:19] to that that one of the first star in
[57:22] the right hand of him who sat on the
[57:24] throne and it wasn't just enough to get
[57:27] to Paul but Paul was able to take him to
[57:31] a place through the Ministry of the word
[57:33] to her own niece Ennis could walk out of
[57:36] there and he was free there's no doubt
[57:41] about it
[57:42] when Paul would write this letter and
[57:44] he's going to send this letter back and
[57:47] aneisa miss is going to be a bearer of
[57:49] this letter there's no doubt about it
[57:52] he's going to have to go and face he's
[57:55] going to be calling to face those that
[57:58] knew all about him they knew the
[58:00] situation they knew all of that let me
[58:02] just tell you friends this morning you
[58:04] can run and run and run and run but
[58:08] you'll never get away from the guilt and
[58:11] the condemnation until you get
[58:14] enterprise well actually not only
[58:17] forgives you but he changes your nature
[58:21] [Music]
[58:22] sometimes people try to bury themselves
[58:25] in so many other things they take
[58:28] hobbies they take all sorts of pleasure
[58:31] and they try to hide
[58:33] that's so that's crying out and it's
[58:36] longing for life they'll bury it in work
[58:39] they're buried in all sorts of other
[58:42] things but the reality is there's only
[58:44] one way it's got to face the reality
[58:47] then Lord I need your touch this was not
[58:56] a City of Refuge by name but he was he
[59:00] was not horny Simas was not running as
[59:02] he were to a City of Refuge but to
[59:05] understand how God had given cities of
[59:08] refuge in the Old Testament that for
[59:11] those who had you know slayed somebody
[59:14] an accident had happened and they could
[59:18] go to the city of refuge there were six
[59:21] cities that were appointed and all of
[59:24] that spoke in time of the Lord Jesus
[59:26] Christ himself now I want you to catch
[59:29] this very closely it was not enough just
[59:31] to come to the gate of the city and sit
[59:34] there if you came to the gate of the
[59:37] city the pursuer when then you know
[59:40] maybe they were chopping like the
[59:42] scripture would say they were chopping
[59:43] wood and the axe head it came off and it
[59:47] killed a man the person never intended
[59:50] to do that but they could not wait
[59:52] around and try to explain it to the
[59:54] family that would be pursuing them they
[59:57] simply had to drop everything and run to
[1:00:01] that city of refuge but it was not just
[1:00:03] enough to come there to the outside gate
[1:00:06] because the manslayer this is number six
[1:00:09] could actually lay ahold of that person
[1:00:12] and kill them they had to come in to
[1:00:15] that City of Refuge miss a clear it's
[1:00:18] not enough to be in a church where the
[1:00:21] truth is being preached it's not enough
[1:00:23] where the Spirit of God is where that's
[1:00:25] not enough it's not enough just to know
[1:00:28] the message you've got to get in the
[1:00:31] our church because the manslayer the
[1:00:36] Avenger is out and he's after the ladies
[1:00:40] and here Onesimus he comes to that place
[1:00:44] and he reaches this place to where Paul
[1:00:49] could write what we just read he
[1:00:53] departed from you for a season but he
[1:00:59] said this departure he's returning to
[1:01:03] you more profitable than he ever could
[1:01:06] sometimes departure is hard there's
[1:01:11] sometimes there's things that we want it
[1:01:12] to go in a certain way maybe Paul wanted
[1:01:15] on Lisa Messiah Lord deal with him I
[1:01:17] wanted to stay right here but God knows
[1:01:20] how to deal with each and every one of
[1:01:23] us God didn't make them nice you must do
[1:01:26] what he needed to do but God was
[1:01:30] watching over and orchestrating every
[1:01:33] part you tell me how did Anissa must get
[1:01:39] to this place where Paul was he didn't
[1:01:43] run because he knew Paul was there but
[1:01:48] God seemed to it he got to where he
[1:01:50] needed to be he got to one who could
[1:01:55] point him to the remedy that he needed
[1:01:57] in his life he departed from Philemon
[1:02:01] but what God did for him he was not just
[1:02:04] returning as the slave as a servant but
[1:02:07] oh my after this he was returning as
[1:02:11] they beloved brother he was returning as
[1:02:14] one who has been transformed by the same
[1:02:17] holy goes back to layman had experienced
[1:02:21] that transformation
[1:02:22] it was now apparent in Aneesa mice's
[1:02:25] life think about it this was roped here
[1:02:29] within this time and how that when you
[1:02:32] know Anissa Massoud returned no doubt
[1:02:35] the devil was trying to you know
[1:02:37] upon his mind and what are people gonna
[1:02:39] think and what is this going to be and
[1:02:41] what is that going to be but you see
[1:02:43] onesimus had already experienced the
[1:02:47] greatest act of redemption upon his soul
[1:02:50] he wasn't just hearing about the cross
[1:02:53] of Calvary out here listen this morning
[1:02:55] he wasn't just believing on Calvary but
[1:02:58] there had to come the effect of what
[1:03:00] Calvary paid the price for that it would
[1:03:03] be released into his heart in a personal
[1:03:06] revelation of Jesus Christ so he was not
[1:03:10] returning back from where he ran from
[1:03:12] under the same condemnation but he had a
[1:03:16] witness in his life that had been
[1:03:20] redeemed he came to the right place
[1:03:29] sometimes we we look at things and I
[1:03:32] think of the scripture that even when
[1:03:34] Paul would write this you know in
[1:03:36] Kalasha one of the last scriptures he
[1:03:40] would speak of Onesimus to the whole
[1:03:42] congregation and he would describe him
[1:03:46] as this a faithful beloved brother who
[1:03:51] is one of you they shall make known unto
[1:03:55] you all things which are done here
[1:03:58] Gorillaz friends I've preached this for
[1:04:01] years you can only live up to the depth
[1:04:03] of the sacrifice that's revealed to you
[1:04:05] personally if you've only lived to the
[1:04:09] depth of forgiveness and it's still
[1:04:11] things that turn your life you'll still
[1:04:12] have eyes of charge and other people
[1:04:15] come on somebody but to understand when
[1:04:19] you live to the when that depth of the
[1:04:21] sacrifice that that there is one that
[1:04:23] has atoned completely for my life I was
[1:04:29] included in that payment
[1:04:33] they've met one that has come that has
[1:04:35] brought a complete change and
[1:04:37] transformation in my life then you can
[1:04:40] look at others that there might be a
[1:04:42] situation that is bleak a situation then
[1:04:45] might is hopeless and even here that the
[1:04:48] molding and character has reset with
[1:04:50] brothers and sisters of lack precious
[1:04:52] faith yet we are looking at one another
[1:04:55] through the depth of Calvary sacrificial
[1:04:58] lamb it's important the right place that
[1:05:03] the Holy Ghost finds the right place in
[1:05:06] your life it's not enough just upon your
[1:05:09] flesh you can come here in this church
[1:05:12] oh I love the music oh I loved it
[1:05:14] I love the preaching or I love the
[1:05:16] atmosphere or I love but it's kind of no
[1:05:19] more than your flesh because you'll come
[1:05:22] here and you leave out the same way you
[1:05:25] say what are you talking about I'm
[1:05:27] talking about your heart it's got to go
[1:05:30] more than your spirit what's just your
[1:05:33] mind well you've got a right thinking
[1:05:36] about things that's all important it's
[1:05:38] all necessary but it's necessary that
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost that he has the right
[1:05:43] place in your life you understand the
[1:05:46] Holy Ghost breeze a person to repentance
[1:05:49] a Holy Ghost brings the person into
[1:05:53] sanctification all of that is a work of
[1:05:57] the Lord and listen all of those are
[1:05:59] experiences of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:02] are you with me sometimes people wonder
[1:06:04] what happened to me when I felt what I
[1:06:06] sense what are this what are that
[1:06:08] but the reality this is where it comes
[1:06:09] down to this is why we rest our faith in
[1:06:13] the redemptive work that places us in
[1:06:16] the body of Jesus Christ Saint call all
[1:06:19] of that of a feeling you you might have
[1:06:21] felt this or felt that but when it comes
[1:06:23] down to is what is the effect after all
[1:06:26] that you said and done hallelujah this
[1:06:33] is Aroo bubbles message he was given the
[1:06:37] plumb line to measure up Jerusalem as
[1:06:41] their right measure it up to the
[1:06:44] standard of the world
[1:06:46] all of that is necessary how would a
[1:06:49] person know the Lord you could hear
[1:06:52] about it but God brings an experience to
[1:06:55] a person that they might seek him the
[1:07:02] Holy Ghost wants to ride away he wants
[1:07:04] to right place that is your inheritance
[1:07:09] once you think about this Aaron's rod
[1:07:12] was a dry dead rod it had been removed
[1:07:19] from a tree it was dead but there was a
[1:07:23] question that was called up there was a
[1:07:28] question in the vindication and God and
[1:07:32] now has them to put the rods in to the
[1:07:36] innermost part of the tablet not the
[1:07:38] first court there was no life not the
[1:07:42] second court but it was into the holiest
[1:07:45] of holies it took what was a dead branch
[1:07:51] and within 24 hours
[1:07:55] come on somebody
[1:07:57] they met victory don't take days
[1:07:59] different look how quick that this
[1:08:02] victory was within 24 hours it blossom
[1:08:08] and budded you see in look the
[1:08:11] blossoming the blooding the putting
[1:08:13] forth of almonds took place all in that
[1:08:16] time showing what that that place is the
[1:08:19] place of life it is the right place for
[1:08:22] the believer to dwell to where Christ
[1:08:26] himself his own life in you and I it
[1:08:30] produces the word through us what a
[1:08:35] comfort that is that comfort was in our
[1:08:37] life to know that we have passed from
[1:08:39] death unto life brother Samuel I don't
[1:08:46] see all things yet but you have you see
[1:08:48] and you have that resting within your
[1:08:50] hearts back there has been
[1:08:52] bass in my life amen
[1:08:58] Moses you know here he was called to
[1:09:02] replace and God is going to make himself
[1:09:05] known to Moses when Moses is asking the
[1:09:09] question you said you was going to send
[1:09:11] somebody with us who is this Lord who is
[1:09:15] he see Moses is asking God and God
[1:09:19] reveals himself his personage here God
[1:09:23] makes known and tells Moses Moses he
[1:09:27] said I you you cannot see my face he
[1:09:30] said but I will make my goodness and my
[1:09:33] mercy to pass before you and he told him
[1:09:36] he said come and stand by me there is a
[1:09:40] place by me he had to get in that place
[1:09:45] in the cleft of the rock in the place of
[1:09:49] safety and God put his hand there upon
[1:09:52] that when he was in the cleft of the
[1:09:54] rock and he passed by and he removed his
[1:09:56] hand and he saw behind her parts of a
[1:09:59] man he was in the right place but notice
[1:10:06] come by me Moses there's the place by me
[1:10:11] our place as believers our rightful
[1:10:14] place is heavenly places that's not
[1:10:20] something we earn or we merit that is
[1:10:23] our rightful position not one of the
[1:10:27] tribes in Israel not one of them
[1:10:30] could look at it and say well you know
[1:10:33] this land right here you know I'm gonna
[1:10:35] take this land it belongs to so-and-so
[1:10:37] but I'm gonna take it no sir it was a
[1:10:40] land that was given to them their newest
[1:10:43] all kinds of you know Canaanites and
[1:10:45] different ones that were around that
[1:10:47] land but brother they were not fighting
[1:10:49] for something that didn't belong to them
[1:10:51] they were fighting for what belong to
[1:10:54] them the fight with
[1:10:56] in them is because their inheritance had
[1:11:00] been ministered to them and so there was
[1:11:02] a faith within them the rose up to say
[1:11:05] this land this promise belongs to me and
[1:11:10] that's why even when God has so placed
[1:11:13] you in Christ that you look at all the
[1:11:16] promises that are around and within
[1:11:19] Christ every promise is yay and amen
[1:11:23] you are approaching those promises not
[1:11:27] with hope you promise them you approach
[1:11:31] of with faith - no he is faithful who
[1:11:34] promised he will perform and you are his
[1:11:38] son you are his daughter these promises
[1:11:41] belong to you these promises were made
[1:11:43] for you to take and inherit
[1:11:46] you're not a stranger you're a stranger
[1:11:49] in this world but this land of the Holy
[1:11:52] Ghost the revealed word of the hour this
[1:11:55] is our homeland
[1:11:56] [Applause]

[1:12:48] with this appointment had already been
[1:12:50] made she was coming to the right place
[1:12:52] when she left that well she left there
[1:12:56] with a different testimony I hope you
[1:12:59] understand what I'm saying she didn't
[1:13:01] leave there with a pamphlet she didn't
[1:13:03] leave there with a track she met the
[1:13:07] Living God and when she went back into
[1:13:09] the city
[1:13:10] it wasn't days later it wasn't weeks
[1:13:13] later there was a witness that took
[1:13:16] place in her life when she went back in
[1:13:19] the city know that she came face to face
[1:13:21] with everybody who knew her past but
[1:13:25] rather there was a presence that
[1:13:26] accompanied her life as a daughter of
[1:13:29] God they had to give witness there is a
[1:13:33] in her life she got to the right place
[1:13:40] like a woman caught in adultery
[1:13:43] oh my you know what was going through
[1:13:47] her mind she being drugged pulled and
[1:13:53] they throw her down at the feet of Jesus
[1:13:56] I don't know I don't know what was going
[1:14:05] through her mind maybe she's waiting
[1:14:06] just for the first rock to hit first
[1:14:09] stone to hint but see there was one
[1:14:14] listen to me now they would stone it in
[1:14:16] the Old Testament they would remove that
[1:14:19] folly from the camp but there was one
[1:14:22] who was present that was able to lift
[1:14:29] and bring judgment by not removing from
[1:14:32] her and placing it back upon the one who
[1:14:37] made her do it in the first place there
[1:14:39] was a greater than song and there was a
[1:14:41] brother he was able to desert and know
[1:14:44] down beneath all this darkness of muck
[1:14:47] and mud there is a daughter of God down
[1:14:50] here he was able she had come to the
[1:14:53] house of God judgment was being married
[1:14:57] measured he was being lifted and put
[1:14:59] back on the accuser hallelujah
[1:15:04] woman were about users
[1:15:14] there's nothing more he said neither do
[1:15:19] i condemn thee go and sin no what about
[1:15:29] the woman who came to Simon's house
[1:15:32] Simon the Pharisee had invited Jesus
[1:15:35] there to make fun of him once you think
[1:15:37] of this he invited him there to ridicule
[1:15:41] him Jesus went ahead and went even when
[1:15:47] he knew what was waiting on him he
[1:15:52] didn't go there for Simon
[1:15:58] he went there because one of his
[1:16:01] redeemable thoughts was gonna be there
[1:16:05] hey man there was an apartment there was
[1:16:09] a daughter of God that was gonna hear
[1:16:11] he's gonna be there and just as much as
[1:16:16] he persevered to be there she was gonna
[1:16:20] persevere
[1:16:21] she laid everything on the line she
[1:16:23] bought the right point meant and she was
[1:16:25] going to go there to ignite the Lord
[1:16:28] Jesus she didn't realize she was also
[1:16:33] being led to anoint him for his burial
[1:16:38] God was working all these parts out she
[1:16:43] was in the right place while they were
[1:16:44] making fun of him men saying if he knew
[1:16:48] what kind of a woman was touching him he
[1:16:53] knew but he also knew what was beneath
[1:16:56] the darkness in her life and he said
[1:17:02] daughter thy sins will they be many they
[1:17:05] are all forgiven
[1:17:08] I want you to think of that this morning
[1:17:11] a double L all-forgiving what about the
[1:17:18] man at the pool of siloam laid there he
[1:17:20] was 38 years old he had laid there for a
[1:17:23] long time he never could get to that
[1:17:26] pool somebody beat him to it but this
[1:17:30] day the one who sent the angel to
[1:17:34] trouble the water
[1:17:35] supernatural winner the same one who
[1:17:38] sent the angel who sent one angel after
[1:17:42] never in the same blood who sent the
[1:17:44] seven angels
[1:17:47] coddled somebody that st. wasn't
[1:17:50] descended down and he came right to
[1:17:53] where that man was at hey man that man
[1:17:58] needed deliverance they might not have
[1:18:02] seen like maybe much of a condition he
[1:18:05] could have lived a long life
[1:18:06] oh I hope you hear me this morning he
[1:18:09] could have lived a long life his disease
[1:18:11] was not a cancer or something like that
[1:18:13] he could have lived a long life but it
[1:18:15] just goes to show that the Lord Jesus
[1:18:18] does not want you walking under any
[1:18:21] little thing he came down and he brought
[1:18:27] us deliverance in that man's life he was
[1:18:33] in the right place how many times that
[1:18:36] he probably fought like a movie little
[1:18:38] closer I can move a little closer but
[1:18:40] God knew right where he was what about
[1:18:49] Joseph and Mary here they are they've
[1:18:52] already went through things that well
[1:18:55] Mary was almost you know put away and
[1:18:58] going to be stoned if it came out God
[1:19:04] reveals to Joseph so here they come and
[1:19:09] you know they've already now come
[1:19:11] through this part of it but now arrives
[1:19:15] as a decree every person must go back to
[1:19:19] their native province or or their their
[1:19:21] native land or country or city for
[1:19:25] taxation and census it's not convenient
[1:19:31] woman who is this far along it's not
[1:19:34] convenient this wasn't an
[1:19:38] air-conditioned Cadillac this wasn't
[1:19:41] come free you know leather seats with
[1:19:43] power recline and lumbar support she was
[1:19:48] gonna ride on a donkey
[1:19:51] it was not a comfortable time but you
[1:19:54] see God was getting them in the right
[1:19:57] place
[1:20:00] there was prophecy to be fulfilled and
[1:20:04] they had to be in that place in order
[1:20:07] for the prophecy to be fulfilled they
[1:20:10] did not know what was going on but God
[1:20:13] was getting them in place it shows it's
[1:20:17] not important that we know it's
[1:20:19] important that we're submissive in you
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:26] now I'm not gonna paint Joseph and Mary
[1:20:29] up to be some some eye idol Saints that
[1:20:33] well they never thought anything wrong
[1:20:35] they never and they never even said man
[1:20:37] this is rough man I don't understand
[1:20:40] what's going on let's be real they were
[1:20:43] humans just like you and I sons and
[1:20:46] daughters of God no doubt they'd
[1:20:48] complain just like you and I complain
[1:20:50] but the something deeper that I
[1:20:53] complained there's a lot of things that
[1:20:58] happened we don't understand here the
[1:21:03] king of globe is going to be born and
[1:21:05] they come to the town of Bethlehem and
[1:21:08] they come to a place naturally it would
[1:21:12] be natural to go to the inn hotel motel
[1:21:15] whatever you're going to go that and ask
[1:21:17] for a place to stay they were informed
[1:21:21] no vacancy no vacancy so they gave them
[1:21:30] barn stable out here now look at this
[1:21:34] we're coming up on a time of the year
[1:21:37] they have out the manger scenes but for
[1:21:41] many that's all it is
[1:21:43] we know he was not born in Christmas and
[1:21:46] on December 25th and I'm not here to
[1:21:47] preach on that this morning but what I'm
[1:21:49] trying to say is many times people
[1:21:51] glorify that and they failed to
[1:21:56] recognize that was a tiny
[1:21:59] here the Lord of glory the Messiah was
[1:22:03] coming among the Jews and they would
[1:22:05] reject him he found no place among them
[1:22:11] but there was going to be a Gentile
[1:22:15] bride one that was Val had no promise of
[1:22:20] covenants got no promise of adoption it
[1:22:23] was all hidden and sealed in everything
[1:22:26] Old Testament but he said I will come in
[1:22:29] a life that is filled with stench
[1:22:31] it's vile it's everything but I will
[1:22:34] come there he would come to the right
[1:22:42] place
[1:22:45] what about Elijah you know he's done
[1:22:53] pronounced judgment it's not going to do
[1:22:56] nor doing a rain gonna fall until I call
[1:22:58] for it God tells him I've got a I've got
[1:23:03] a place for you by the brook Sheriff
[1:23:08] don't worry about taking vittles with
[1:23:10] you I got it all come in larger you're
[1:23:17] not a lot to Kay believer you're a
[1:23:18] believer come on somebody
[1:23:23] you know like people I'm stocking up
[1:23:26] water and I'm strong we'll go ahead if
[1:23:27] you plan on being here for the
[1:23:28] tribulation you might need it but I'm
[1:23:33] not in preparation for the tribulation
[1:23:34] and preparation to leave this hallelujah
[1:23:43] the Bible says my God shall provide for
[1:23:47] all my needs according to his riches and
[1:23:50] glory delight thyself in the Lord and He
[1:23:53] will give me all the desires of the
[1:23:55] heart acknowledged the Lord in all thy
[1:23:57] ways and he shall direct thy path Lee's
[1:24:02] not gonna like you there the rest are in
[1:24:05] famine
[1:24:10] he's enjoying well whatever your
[1:24:13] favorite sandwiches he's enjoying the
[1:24:17] places because in this verse of
[1:24:19] scripture Elijah does not type the
[1:24:21] messenger he types the bride that bride
[1:24:26] that is hidden away in the Christ she's
[1:24:31] in the right place just listen judgment
[1:24:35] itself already is being poured out upon
[1:24:39] this world before God could ever bring
[1:24:44] that of judgment in the days of Noah the
[1:24:47] people had to get in the spirit and God
[1:24:53] brought judgment upon that but there was
[1:24:56] a man by the name of Noah he got in the
[1:24:58] spirit - but he was in the Holy Ghost
[1:25:03] then man he found himself a place of
[1:25:06] safety he was in the right place when
[1:25:10] the water started to fall
[1:25:15] hallelujah the Ravens were bringing in
[1:25:18] light you just what he had need up and
[1:25:20] when the brook dried up he told Elijah I
[1:25:27] got a word a woman down here I've
[1:25:32] commanded her to sustain thee nowhere in
[1:25:37] the scripture does it say that the Lord
[1:25:39] had spoke to the woman of Zahra pyth and
[1:25:42] let her know there's a man coming down
[1:25:44] here by the name of Elijah in this and
[1:25:45] that's gonna take place how did he
[1:25:47] command her she was afeard on the word
[1:25:51] she was standing upon the Word of God
[1:25:54] brother
[1:25:55] what did she recognize it was not the
[1:25:57] outward message of Elijah that she
[1:26:00] humbled herself till she humble herself
[1:26:03] to the revelation of the person of
[1:26:06] Christ being revealed in that hour she
[1:26:11] was not a worshipper of Elijah
[1:26:14] she was a worshipper of the same God
[1:26:17] that Elijah worshiped hallelu that's a
[1:26:25] relief anybody can recognize Elijah he
[1:26:29] could have pictures out there and they
[1:26:31] could say that's Elijah come on now I
[1:26:36] can read scriptures I can quote clothes
[1:26:38] but it's important to recognize Christ
[1:26:41] in the midst out the way doing the
[1:26:44] speaking not just enough well that's a
[1:26:48] quote that's a scripture that's a quote
[1:26:49] natural scripture anybody can read that
[1:26:52] anybody can quote that but it takes the
[1:26:57] person of Christ to make it real and
[1:27:00] bring it down personally in our lives
[1:27:02] that's who we want to recognize we don't
[1:27:04] want we do not want our eyes tied to the
[1:27:06] Vistage of a man we want our eyes our
[1:27:09] hearts tied to Christ
[1:27:13] she was in the right place
[1:27:16] she was fellowshiping with the Lord
[1:27:18] things got a little bare little slim in
[1:27:20] her house
[1:27:21] God knew about it see God had all that
[1:27:24] rearrange your I would have been biting
[1:27:27] her nails or you know putting posts on
[1:27:31] Facebook and everything we would have
[1:27:33] been doing something but we're believers
[1:27:39] aren't we man what about this what about
[1:27:47] this man who's robbed on the road and
[1:27:54] Jesus is talking about that of eternal
[1:27:56] life and love and he talks about a
[1:28:00] Levite the leave I saw this man laying
[1:28:05] on the side of the road and the Levite
[1:28:07] said I ain't gonna touch him if I touch
[1:28:11] him I'll be defiled
[1:28:13] he was already defiled I don't care how
[1:28:19] ceremonial he was he was already defied
[1:28:23] because his heart was defiled one who
[1:28:27] was guilty of what point in the law is
[1:28:29] guilty of it all if he wouldn't
[1:28:34] recognize his separation is based on the
[1:28:38] blood come on sure it was but here Jesus
[1:28:45] lets it be known here comes the here
[1:28:48] comes a Samaritan we know the story by
[1:28:50] the Good Samaritan this out of Luke 10
[1:28:52] here comes this man now this man's got
[1:28:56] the Holy Ghost he's got a beast he's
[1:28:59] riding on he's got a power that's
[1:29:02] carrying him a man and there not a
[1:29:05] situation that can take this power from
[1:29:08] his life come on now beached him the
[1:29:11] Bible of beasts of burden his power he
[1:29:15] comes off of that beast and he goes over
[1:29:17] and he ministers to this man who is
[1:29:20] wounded
[1:29:25] I'll tell you sometimes the wounds are
[1:29:27] much deeper than what superficial wounds
[1:29:29] are outside here
[1:29:32] there's wounds that are deep within the
[1:29:34] spirit
[1:29:35] sometimes there's wounds that lay so
[1:29:37] deep within people even after God has
[1:29:39] done such a redemptive work in their
[1:29:41] life the enemy will try to bring that up
[1:29:44] in their memory
[1:29:46] it's a wound but let me just say this to
[1:29:51] you there's one who knows how to
[1:29:53] minister to your wounds no saying I may
[1:29:58] have a scar there but a scar is a sign
[1:30:00] of healing
[1:30:01] a scar is a witness there was a wound
[1:30:06] the heart here but now it has been
[1:30:08] healed
[1:30:10] there might have to been thread that'll
[1:30:13] hold that thing together until the cells
[1:30:16] that are directed to bring it all about
[1:30:18] and bring it back together but here
[1:30:21] there is sufficient to minister to that
[1:30:24] wound brother Brown called this this man
[1:30:28] he was identified as the Evangelist
[1:30:32] passing through and the Evangelist picks
[1:30:35] him up he he bonds up his wound
[1:30:37] first he pulls in oil and wine I love
[1:30:40] that don't you
[1:30:41] he had me he had the necessary essential
[1:30:44] oil in one frankincense it wasn't
[1:30:48] lavender it was the Holy Ghost
[1:30:50] hey man he had some essential oil of the
[1:30:53] Holy Ghost he had some wine so
[1:30:55] revelation brother that would give power
[1:30:58] to believe I can't be home that's what
[1:31:03] the ministering of the word does he does
[1:31:05] not take away from you it ministers to
[1:31:08] you what you really are you can rise in
[1:31:15] that He pours in the oil and wine and
[1:31:16] then he binds up the wounds and he puts
[1:31:19] him on his Beast and then he takes him
[1:31:23] to the inn and he told the innkeeper he
[1:31:27] said you take care of him
[1:31:30] and he said if there's anything else
[1:31:32] that's needed
[1:31:33] he gave him two pens is that right
[1:31:36] he gave him two pens to care for him the
[1:31:39] spirit and the word the spirit and the
[1:31:44] word he said you take care of him if
[1:31:47] there's anything he said that's needed
[1:31:49] more than that I will repay thee when I
[1:31:51] return he was there because God had
[1:31:56] brought him there and the same God that
[1:32:00] brought us here is the same God who
[1:32:02] ministers to our needs I just said to
[1:32:05] you this morning you don't have to keep
[1:32:07] packing around wounds don't walk around
[1:32:13] like well you know you don't know what
[1:32:15] I've been through and you don't know how
[1:32:17] I've been wronged and I'll you are
[1:32:19] remaining in that because you want to
[1:32:21] remain in it that is one who relieved
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:28] you've got a choice to make
[1:32:32] Calvary is not a pity party Calvary is a
[1:32:35] reality that releases lives there's a
[1:32:41] lot of horrible things that happen to
[1:32:44] people but there is a blood
[1:32:48] I don't care what Satan's lies there is
[1:32:54] a blood that patch power
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:33:05] what about John I'm telling my John the
[1:33:10] Beloved they're sitting around and Jesus
[1:33:14] said what is it to you if there be some
[1:33:19] that stand by which shall not taste of
[1:33:23] death till they see the kingdom of God
[1:33:26] come with power those who were there did
[1:33:33] not understand what he was saying
[1:33:37] Jesus knew he was going to reveal the
[1:33:42] kingdom of God coming in power the
[1:33:45] outpouring of the Spirit of God from the
[1:33:49] offering up of the to atonement coming
[1:33:52] back upon the worshiper it would show
[1:33:56] John think of this now he would take job
[1:33:59] and here is John John's gonna be one and
[1:34:04] the Bible says that the saying went
[1:34:06] around this a man's not gonna die til he
[1:34:11] see the Lord come they didn't understand
[1:34:15] but you see Jesus already had said it
[1:34:19] because that's how it was going to be he
[1:34:22] was going to get John in position where
[1:34:25] John was supposed to be in order to see
[1:34:28] this of how this outpouring of the Holy
[1:34:32] Spirit after John was born of the Spirit
[1:34:34] of God notice John the Bible says I John
[1:34:37] in Revelations 1 am your brother and
[1:34:41] companion in tribulation
[1:34:46] I was on the Isle of Patmos for the
[1:34:51] testimony of Jesus Christ and that's the
[1:34:56] last time you heard about the Isle of
[1:35:01] palace matter of fact you can't find
[1:35:06] nothing out about it other than it was a
[1:35:08] snake-infested Island John don't ever
[1:35:10] mention it anymore I tell you friends
[1:35:16] the enemy would love to get you trapped
[1:35:19] in things of the past
[1:35:21] oh brother Sammy I've got over it no you
[1:35:24] still talk about it as though it was
[1:35:26] just yesterday and it's 25 50 years ago
[1:35:29] you still talk with the same hurt come
[1:35:34] on somebody it's understand week
[1:35:37] listen there's places in the world that
[1:35:40] much people feel it's not comfortable
[1:35:43] are you with me the Bible says that we
[1:35:47] are to forgive even as God for Christ's
[1:35:51] sake has forgiven us over and over in
[1:35:52] the scripture those are not comfortable
[1:35:56] comfortable promises to be fulfilled but
[1:36:01] they must be they must be they have to
[1:36:06] be fulfilled and it requires sometimes
[1:36:09] and it's not well this person is so
[1:36:10] wrong and this for so sometimes God
[1:36:12] allows people to do certain things to
[1:36:15] test and see how are we going to respond
[1:36:23] and even though they can be as wrong as
[1:36:26] wrong to be but our attitude can be
[1:36:30] wrong oh god help us John didn't realize
[1:36:38] the circumstances he was going to have
[1:36:39] to be in in order for these things to be
[1:36:42] revealed certain things in our life I
[1:36:45] guarantee we did not know we still don't
[1:36:49] know of things to come of places that we
[1:36:52] will have to be in in order for our
[1:36:54] character to be molded and fit for the
[1:36:58] throne wonder if we could have told jock
[1:37:02] John me this is this revelation is going
[1:37:04] to come to you it's gonna be a
[1:37:05] tremendous revelation but you're gonna
[1:37:08] have to watch where you step there's
[1:37:11] going to be scorpions snakes and
[1:37:12] everything else around it's called the
[1:37:15] Isle of Patmos wonder if John would have
[1:37:18] taken it but he was led there you said
[1:37:22] he was put there as an exile but notice
[1:37:24] he was led because he submitted to the
[1:37:28] Lord we wouldn't even have the back a
[1:37:32] book of revelations if every chapter
[1:37:34] John said remember me I'm in the Halep
[1:37:37] Atmos which I'll remember me I have such
[1:37:40] a terrible trial I'm in the Isle of
[1:37:43] Patmos chapter 2 Isle of Patmos chapter
[1:37:46] 3 Alabama's chapter 4 Alabama's chapter
[1:37:49] 5 Alabama's would you under read the
[1:37:51] book of Revelation your life and my life
[1:37:54] is a book those chapters you need to let
[1:37:58] these chapters and stop letting it
[1:38:00] become your book come on somebody I'm
[1:38:10] ready to pass from this chapter into
[1:38:13] another chapter I don't want to keep
[1:38:17] this chapter going let's transition
[1:38:20] let's make a transition Lord boy the
[1:38:26] testing trials in our lives this is
[1:38:30] something that came to lot to me as well
[1:38:32] you think of Joseph Joseph received
[1:38:37] dreams as a as a young man your brother
[1:38:42] and are going to bow to you seven the
[1:38:46] sheaves are gonna fall down Joseph went
[1:38:49] he told it remember even his father was
[1:38:52] looked at him a little bit strange
[1:38:56] Joseph didn't ask for that dream Joseph
[1:38:59] didn't ask for that position but that's
[1:39:03] who he was my goodness from the time God
[1:39:11] revealed it to the time he would set on
[1:39:13] the throne what he would have to go
[1:39:16] through this was necessary right here
[1:39:21] between the dream and the throne this
[1:39:24] was necessary for who Joseph there are
[1:39:31] things in our life that comes out of
[1:39:35] experience I told a person here even the
[1:39:40] other day we're talking about some
[1:39:41] things I said what I'm sharing with you
[1:39:43] is not from book knowledge
[1:39:45] it's from experience these things are
[1:39:50] shared are from experience in our lives
[1:39:54] Joseph would have to be loaded rejected
[1:39:58] rejected molded and shaped to think of
[1:40:04] it the prophetic eye in this hour would
[1:40:07] be able to look back down through there
[1:40:08] and see there was just a little bit of
[1:40:12] pride than Joseph's life and God would
[1:40:18] have to work that pride out of his life
[1:40:21] you and I would have looked in and said
[1:40:24] what's he doing in that jail what's he
[1:40:26] doing in that judgment he's in the right
[1:40:28] place
[1:40:31] God is molding and shaping him for the
[1:40:35] throne character is not a gift it's a
[1:40:42] victory
[1:40:45] the experiences in our life come from
[1:40:49] the molding of character we come here
[1:40:53] for the preaching of the word it touches
[1:40:56] our life but it does not mold our
[1:40:59] character it shapes our conscience it
[1:41:02] deals with a lot but what does it do it
[1:41:04] reveals and brings us into a yielding a
[1:41:08] submissive but it takes God molding
[1:41:12] character through tests trials and
[1:41:15] tribulation anybody want to sign up for
[1:41:18] some more I'll be honest with you I
[1:41:22] don't but he knows what I need so my
[1:41:27] rest and my faithfulness is even though
[1:41:29] there's things tests and trials hey
[1:41:31] let's be honest there's tests and trials
[1:41:33] let's come right now
[1:41:34] then when window and they come every
[1:41:35] time they count we look at it and say
[1:41:37] Lord Lord you know what's going on and
[1:41:41] yet down on the inside we know there's
[1:41:43] got to be testings and trials then it
[1:41:49] comes into that place of saying Lord
[1:41:51] just let me hold your hand Lord
[1:41:55] take me through the Lord Jesus take me
[1:41:58] through Lord I'm telling you we're in
[1:42:03] the right place for rapture the Bible
[1:42:09] said blessed are they who die in the
[1:42:11] Lord
[1:42:12] henceforth and forevermore those who are
[1:42:17] in Christ are a part of that first
[1:42:20] resurrection it's the right place for
[1:42:22] the rapture warious in Christ in Christ
[1:42:27] is the right place for the rapture I can
[1:42:30] say this without any flinching at all we
[1:42:34] have received the right message
[1:42:43] we have received the rat Holy Ghost
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:42:50] hallelu we have received as God hath
[1:42:54] sealed and the vindicated his world of
[1:42:57] promise in this hour by his own person
[1:43:03] through her to be the God we are in the
[1:43:06] right place for rapture we're in that
[1:43:10] safe place the Bible said by one spirit
[1:43:13] we are all baptized into one body then
[1:43:17] that brought into class we are in that
[1:43:19] place where Enoch walked he had a
[1:43:23] testimony before he was translated that
[1:43:27] he pleased God Enoch was in the right
[1:43:29] place walking with God he was in the
[1:43:32] right place at the right time we've been
[1:43:41] called back to the land of promise the
[1:43:46] church got out of the land of promise
[1:43:49] the church down through at times God
[1:43:53] would send a word but then here it would
[1:43:57] come right back into organization but
[1:43:59] there was a truth that stood in age
[1:44:02] after age after age but God here in
[1:44:05] keeping a promise of his word
[1:44:07] I think of the bones of Joseph as a
[1:44:10] memorial it was a memorial they walked
[1:44:14] by every day listen to me now it was a
[1:44:16] memorial that they walked by and it was
[1:44:19] a witness
[1:44:20] Joseph said we're going back to the land
[1:44:22] and he said when God visits you you take
[1:44:26] my bones back to the land in Burien what
[1:44:29] I let him know my bones here but there's
[1:44:32] the right place for my burial
[1:44:34] we're going back to that right place let
[1:44:37] me tell you something the very memorial
[1:44:40] of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:42] setting on the right hand of God or the
[1:44:45] throne of God it is the memorial that is
[1:44:48] the testimony that has he himself will
[1:44:52] come and receive a bride unto himself
[1:44:57] God at a church in the beginning that
[1:44:59] also was a memorial of that remember for
[1:45:03] the first age ever started there was the
[1:45:05] Alpha bride Amen where the Son of man
[1:45:09] was walking in phonus in their lives on
[1:45:12] the day of Pentecost they were in the
[1:45:14] right place amen and rushing mighty you
[1:45:19] in came down and have filled their
[1:45:21] vessels brother the Holy Ghost didn't
[1:45:23] get the wrong address he got the right
[1:45:25] address he didn't miss it and come to
[1:45:31] the Upper Room instead of the temple it
[1:45:33] was coming there was already a
[1:45:35] transition that had been made these were
[1:45:38] the temples he was coming to and the
[1:45:44] cloud was on in this hour come out of
[1:45:46] her my people come out of that
[1:45:52] organization that Roman that Roman
[1:45:55] Catholicism and control the demonic
[1:45:59] influence upon my people come out of her
[1:46:01] my people regulations 18 and be not a
[1:46:04] partaker of her place you know as well
[1:46:08] as I do the Bible said she had become a
[1:46:10] cage of every hateful and unclean and
[1:46:13] foul spirit I'll tell you that's not the
[1:46:16] Church of Jesus Christ that he claims
[1:46:18] for his own because the Church of Jesus
[1:46:20] Christ is where the breath is applied
[1:46:23] upon the doorpost and the Holy Spirit is
[1:46:26] there to lift and catch out every
[1:46:29] unclean and fast spirit
[1:46:33] hallelujah aren't you glad for that if I
[1:46:39] can just get rid of this let him lift it
[1:46:42] this morning we're in the right place
[1:46:47] I say you're in the right place this
[1:46:50] morning you might have come here and it
[1:46:53] might have just been Sunday morning and
[1:46:55] you had it all planned out but you come
[1:46:57] to the right place
[1:46:58] it's more than this building but it's a
[1:47:02] very presence of Almighty God maybe
[1:47:04] you're the one you're the only
[1:47:05] semester's morning and you're running
[1:47:08] and you're looking over your back you've
[1:47:11] got to always check wonder who's
[1:47:13] watching me close this down on the
[1:47:16] screen wonder who's watching me
[1:47:18] maybe you're the only CMAs this morning
[1:47:20] you have to live life like that you do
[1:47:23] not have to live like that anymore
[1:47:25] you can come to the right place that's
[1:47:31] in Christ fully where you're not looking
[1:47:35] over your shoulder wondering who's
[1:47:37] watching me he sees you
[1:47:43] he knows and he loves and he wants to
[1:47:48] set you free
[1:47:53] maybe here this morning in your life you
[1:47:56] need healing but it's not from a
[1:48:00] physical condition it's something in
[1:48:03] your spirit and you need healing I'm
[1:48:08] telling you he's still the same God that
[1:48:13] ministers oil and wine he bonds up the
[1:48:19] wounds
[1:48:21] he's the healer he's able to bring
[1:48:27] something from of his own self through
[1:48:30] your life that like Joseph could say
[1:48:33] regarding one of his boys he hath made
[1:48:36] me to forget all the toil and labor of
[1:48:41] my father's house
[1:48:42] it was a birth that caused him to forget
[1:48:49] he's still the same God this morning
[1:48:53] let's bow our heads
[1:49:00] I wonder how many maybe somebody here
[1:49:03] you want to be remembered in prayer this
[1:49:06] morning
[1:49:09] god bless those hands I want you to
[1:49:13] understand this
[1:49:14] this might been what I read on a fool in
[1:49:17] Philemon but this right here of onesimus
[1:49:20] this is you this is me God knows the
[1:49:25] need within your life maybe in your life
[1:49:27] it's for a complete healing in your life
[1:49:31] maybe in your life it's for healing
[1:49:34] maybe something in your spirit maybe
[1:49:36] you're wounded but let me just encourage
[1:49:39] you you're in the right place you've got
[1:49:41] an audience with the King this morning
[1:49:44] he can Deacon right here move right into
[1:49:47] where your end and by just your
[1:49:50] submission and recognition of his
[1:49:52] presence saying I'm not going to keep
[1:49:54] looking over my shoulder I'm gonna look
[1:49:56] away to Jesus I'm gonna look away to
[1:49:59] Jesus I'm gonna look to him who's the
[1:50:02] author and finisher of my faith he that
