needs we've prayed for needs and this would come in a little bit late and it's a a need little Drake jr. his brother Drake and sister Rebecca's little boy he got his fingers caught in a treadmill so he just needs he needs prayer so let's just go to the Lord behalf of all these the other requests you've got a need on your heart even as we're approaching the word of the Lord God is mindful he's mindful there's no need that's that's too small for him you know it's one thing to say it we believe it but God came in this hour and he demonstrated that to us there was a little fishing not a big one not a big one a little one where it's in size had been pulled out it was impossible for that fish to live again but because of that God came down and he spoke alive to that little fish I've never heard how brother branham said how did did the intros get back inside him how those things I don't that to me the details apart about it it don't matter God came down and did it the one thing about it is he's the same God that restores cells that are out of line he's the same God that can give new lungs new liver new heart new kidneys he's the same God he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God that when you feel maybe in your life I don't have nothing left maybe you've been wounded you've been hurt but he's a healer he don't just heal cells but he'll come down and heal your spirit he's a healer let's everyone of us has priests unto God let's take this need and other needs before God in prayer Heavenly Father how we just so appreciate your presence Lord oh god it means the world to us to be into your presence Lord then you would come among us Lord there's a work to be done there's an accomplishment there's an achievement so our desire Lord as we lift these requests

brother Drake and sister Rebecca I pray that God your presence will move right there in that home Lord I pray you'll move over the cells Lord of his body Lord Oh God may you just Lord minister Yingling Lord to his little body well god I pray Lord these other requests Lord that are all around us and in our hearts Lord every need Oh God you're the same God whether it be a physical need

Dan a god bless you so good to see you all and so good to see sister Suzanne keen are here with us and brother Greg as well and then sister Marissa brother Ricardo god bless you amen so good to see CH and every one of you and we just I just want to say thankful for that testimony from sister Suzanne and we want to continue to remember sister Suzanne in prayer as what was spoken in that request and also continue remember sister Shirley kress in prayer as well brother Dave she goes the doctor tomorrow right now it's everything sister everything sister kress could do for them too for her not to be in church and so she's how so had a another very major surgery but God has brought our sister through and a wonderful thing sister Rita god bless you good to see you amen amen well I could stand here all day and because it's so good - there ain't nobody else I'd rather be with amen think about it brother joy we're gonna spend eternity together you might as well get used to me now what a day that will be amen let's look in the word of the Lord here this morning the first Kings chapter 19 and I'm just gonna read a few verses of Scripture and then we'll just let you have your seats just wanted just some things that you know we've been dealing with here with how God just dropped all of that together with the stability in the midst of instability but this is one of those parts within it and just not knowing exactly where that God would have it to be but I want to just speak to you this morning if the Lord would help us on strength for the journey before you strength for the journey before you first Kings chapter 19 verse 1 and an a had told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with a sword then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the one as the life of one of them but tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to bear Sheba which belongeth to Judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and he said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I'm not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto Him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake Baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said rise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the Mount of God Whitten who like to get a hold of this one what kind of meat was this he went in the strength of this meat for 40 days and 40 nights and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and the hold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto Him what doest thou here Elijah may God bless his words you're being seated so much within God's Word and we see there's always an application the word is how the Spirit of God will take it and always apply it and just address present needs in each of our lives we find here Elijah where as a servant of God there's three stages that we we notice here we see Mount Carmel and from Mount Carmel experience where the showdown was where Israel was divided between two opinions his bail God or as the Lord God and here God in His mercy came and made himself known to bring the separation so that the people were no longer held between two opinions what took place on Mount Carmel did it make everybody a believer it did out of all of those who spoke on that mountain the Lord he is the God the Lord he is the God but yet it didn't make everybody who was there a believer but then we find that after this when we look at it that Elijah himself if I can just read this to you and going into this brother Brannon would say it like this I don't have this on the screen but I want you just to listen to this you said Elijah was worn out his nerves were all on the edge he said it's just like the people today we need a juniper tree he said I preach to tired people nervous people I pray for nervous people and it's a nervous neurotic upset world right now that we're living in everybody's just on the edge as to say or to speak like it's just any little so upsets them listen to me now God's people is that way the world is that way we all need a juniper tree a place to rest pressure itself there is no one that is exempt from pressure pressure as brother Brandon would put it it makes the good act this way and makes the bad act this way it makes the unbeliever act this way it makes believer act this way pressure has an effect even after a life has totally been born again but remember your spirit and your flesh never got born again it's not an excuse but it's the reality of that in this life that we walk as Jesus said we walk in this world but we're not of this world we have to experience pressures and sort through things that come our way when you're on the job this report comes or this rumor comes or this statement comes and it's a time that you've got to sort all that out you have to be able to take that and put it into the hands of God and put your life there but how have a great of a testimony when God would allow those things to rise and God would give us grace to be able to do that there is a thing that when pressure comes many times weariness will follow it when sometimes when a person gets sick weariness will follow sickness when weariness follow sickness then there's things that thoughts can start bombarding a person and they can get down and they get weak and you know it was even in those times when brother Branham was interviewing sister Bruce he was explaining even of how the enemy was coming to work on her in her makeup but he pointed out you're sick and you're weary and that's when the enemy likes to come and during those times of weariness and you know to realize we are in a time that within not just in this time but all the way down through the scriptures there is a need for every one of us to come aside and rest sometimes we can go get so focused on everything that's going on in life but yet there's a time that we must and we need to be refreshed there has to be a renewing in our lives Elijah you know brother Brandon would put it that he was weary he was feeling blue within himself and you know you think about Elijah and think about within him brother bran would say many times he said people think God's prophets they just ought to be continually going and bombarding and continually he said like a rocket he said but let me say this he said that when you go as hard like a rocket like that you're eventually going to fall like a rock because the reality of it is your only there is only so much that you can do in your natural strength but you say well I've got God's strength behind me but remember this thing gets tired and it gets weary whether we like it or not and whether you want admit it or not there's times even sometimes in a service we can get tired and weary hope it's not this morning but the reality is why this body can only handle so much it can only it can only take so much we are going to a place we are going into a land where we'll never have to worry about that again but your is there is good counsel that for all of our lives it it behooves us for what God has commissioned us to do I'm talking about as husband has wife has family for each and every one of us in our life there is a need for us not to just all the time be goin goin goin goin goin goin goin there's a need to rest Jesus sit come aside brother branham in the message thy house preached in Tifton Georgia just in a little living room he spoke there in that house and he said many people he said now he said they come to ask me and say brother Branham how in the world if the coming of the Lord is upon us how in the world do you got time to go fishing you see the thought listen that's not that kind of a thought right there is a thought sometimes it could permeate in our minds but you realize if you don't rest and refreshed you can't go on we all have we all have limitations brother Branham had to recognize this and it wasn't something that just come easy it was something he had to deal with something he had to go through look in the journey of Israel here they come tomorrow after Marah hard bitter trials and tests there's any lien Elaine was a place of palm trees a place of Springs of water a place of rest where they could be refreshed and prepared for the next part of the journey brother Branham made this statement in regards that question he said if I didn't if I didn't he said with all that if I let it weigh on my mind he said it would go crazy I've got to get out brothers don't call off sick tomorrow and go fishing wait till you get the honey-do list then you can know that wouldn't be good counsel would it but there's got to be there's got to be in taken an output and we think about what we're taking in and you know brother Branham would say like this he said many times we you know as we sat around in these meetings he said we're taking in two things of God but there needs to be a giving out in our life what we're taking it but you know the only way that what God is giving to us what we're feeding on can come out of our life is when we take that and pray over it and submit to it and then God in weakness moves behind and brings that word to pass you see it's nothing where we can take the word and say I am gonna take this word and I'm gonna mime just gonna go along that way we find ourselves down because it's not us that can do it it's got to be him that doesn't mean that we as believers just go off and forget about it it means we giving ourselves to him what God is illuminated to our hearts and our lives we give ourselves to him because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God how much you think of this statement here just for a moment brother Branham would take this this this whole part right here with Elijah how did Elijah was tired and he was weary but God prepared a juniper tree for him it was not by chance I want you to look at this he takes off and he runs to bear Sheba to Judah with his servant then he leaves his servant there and he goes on out into the winters he's alone but this is all under the plan of God sometimes the plan of God and what God is doing in our life he doesn't even make sense to us much less to anybody else but God is at work he's not the author of confusion amen he is overseeing everything every test every trial that comes away every sickness every circumstance he's overseeing it sometimes you and I feel so alone you get weary you feel so long Elisha was in this condition he was feeling so long that's what he speaks in latter parts here of the word and the only one is left he felt alone you know it's not good for a man to be alone we can move that on into the spiritual but I want you to see here God provided the loving kindness of God provided Elijah with the juniper tree that to me is so tremendous how God seen to it and knew his prophet was going to come to that place and it was God's orchestrated measure that Elijah would come to that place so God prepared that juniper tree for Elijah think of this a prepared place when Moses was there God told him come and stand upon the rock there is a place beside me it was a prepared place when Elijah he had already remember when the dew had been cold and God had spoke to his life he comes out of the wilderness and said it'll not rain or Dew glut told him to say that good 2 a.m. and speak those words and he went and spoke those words and God withheld the rain and the dew from Israel and here he was provided a place down there get thee to the brook Cherith he goes to that place he goes and he's he's fed by Ravens he drinks from the brook that brook dries up I hope you hear of me now there's sometimes God has to let things dry up why there's another Junction [Music] sometimes we don't understand that it's called moving us along the way he's maturing our lives he's bringing us into appointed places that he has for us and he said I commanded a little woman to sustain me down there in therapist well is what she had it didn't look like that he had commanded her to sustain him but a little did he know God's command well she had a heart that was willing to be submissive a heart that could recognize God's presence and God's voice and God sent his servant down there and his servant here he comes think of a God had a there was a need in the prophets life for him to be sustained but she needed to be sustained as well God was working on both ends sometimes you do not even know whether the things that have befallen you things that have come out to you come on Joseph I'm talking to you there are things sometimes that comes out you don't know why you're in certain places and what this has come about but God has put you there to preserve life and you wonder why am I here that don't even make sense it's things that you wouldn't have even chose but God has chosen you see the scripture let me just drop this in here the scripture says in Philippians 2 verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus it goes on to talk about he took the form of a servant just submitting in the submissiveness of his life once again I find this this portion of Scripture would not had an opportunity to speak on it but I find this really incredible that Paul this unction and this would be given during a time when he is in prison and he's writing of the greatness of the mind of Christ being in the believer and Paul writes in the book of Philippians this is the same book where we find the text read of the mighty Gordonville before us unveiling of God in this hour think of it it's a text that when we look at it the whole book of the book of Philippians it deals with singleness of mind it deals with the focus among the believers and of a yielded submissive servant's heart that God might be expressed I say we need help to come into that servant place we need help 1st Corinthians 2:16 who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ let me just say this even when we received the Holy Ghost that's the mind of Christ yet we need God's help to yield not take our own thinking but let his thinking be preeminent women God we need the grace of God in that overriding of our lives Lord let my thoughts be overrode what you think of this as out of the Seventh Seal just think of this the Seventh Seal when the supernatural he's talking about this experience with Elijah when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ you become so far away from your own thinking so he said your own mind always said don't let me try to explain it cuz I can't I couldn't do it there's nobody could do it how could that man that's the Elijah stand up there on the mountain under the presence of God and pulled down fire from heaven then rain right behind the fire then closed the heavens it didn't rain for three years and six months go back and call the rain on the same day and under that anointing how many know I'm talking about when the Prophet stood there in that bull pasture when he stood there when the maniac came upon the platform when he stood there and the Hornets came out of the nest what did he say he says oh I wish I could stay under that anointing all the time but recognize what invited that anointing the mind of Christ to move in what invited that what did the Prophet élysée said he chose to think different thoughts they were thoughts that considered the humanity of that man he was bound by Devils but God who through his prophet he showed you and I do not get caught in that warfare with that and looking at like it's flesh and blood recognize it's a spiritual warfare [Applause] you'll never defeat spirits with our own strength don't happen you can't outward it you can't out reason it you cannot it but there's one thing there's one thing that the devil can't stand in the face of and that's the love of God that's what Jesus took and whipped the devil with the love of God he stood upon that word his love for the word of God hallelujah under that anointing he took four hundred priests and killed him that's what Elijah did then he run into the wilderness screaming for his life on a threat of one woman Jezebel she swore that she'd take his life when they happen all of them was there to see the presence of God and great miracle done the spirit had left him in his natural way of thinking he didn't know how to think you know brother Branham would say it like this people speak even in before then of Ministers but I believe it applies to all of us he said you watch after God has used you he said within that service the next day he said Satan is there present to try to knock every ounce of confidence out of you that the Holy Ghost has instilled let me just tell you something that is not just for me the Holy Spirit jesus said my words they are spirit and life Paul said I was with you and great trembling and weakness that your faith might stand in the power of God God is in stealing confidence in your life the Holy Spirit is instilling confidence in our life strength for the journey that lays before you the reality is you don't know and I don't know what lays before us even in the oncoming hours we don't know what lays before us tomorrow we don't know what next month or next year or we don't know those things but God does Grund us it is natural way of thinking he didn't know how to think he couldn't think for himself remember the angel putting to sleep rested him raised him up gave him some cakes put him back to sleep rested him raised him up give him some cakes again we don't know what happened to the man for 40 days then he was pulled back in a cave somewhere and God called him I love how brother bran will take this and he'll dramatizing showing God's care to each of our lives Elijah was in it was in a place to where he felt like what good is anything doing I've preached of labor and it's still going on the same way listen this gets down to children and you know loved ones and on and on and on sometimes you just get weary because the weariness comes we're coming to the end of our rope God don't do things how we think he's going to do it he specializes in rolling up our plans you know why cuz he's God he don't have to do it our way who have known the mind of the Lord that we might instruct him how weariness many times come from that plans or things are not going according to how we think they ought to go but it doesn't mean that nothing's happening he's weary me to say like this he was depressed he was discouraged I'm sorry this is the Bible this is the mighty prophet of God but God didn't chose to hide or cloak that humanity he's weary he's tired he's made a request just let me go let me let me come on home let me come on home sometimes you know even in the midst of things you can get weird you can get tired whether it's disease whether it's affliction whether it's trials battles you can just get weary and we've all been there if you haven't you couldn't do it and the Prophet the voice that the Holy Spirit spoke back to me in the adoption series from brother Brad sir let me just come on home he said are you trying to escape your trials trials are the molding ground sitting under this Ministry of the word it doesn't mold your character you know I preached if we preach these things it doesn't mold your character you're coming and feeding on the word it and gives you strength but the molding of our character your character my character it comes through the things we suffer trials and tests in different ways who God had the juniper-tree fruit he already had it prepared now this wasn't a five-star hotel but all the service it had there this is one of them little places you might have passed up it was a nice little bed-and-breakfast it had really some incredible cooks there as a matter of fact with all the angels brother Brown said here when it Elijah came in he laid under that juniper tree all the angels that was gathered around he said God looked upon his servant God said which one have you got the softest hands come on you do I want you to stroke his brow brother Branham said then god looked around again and said which one of you is the best cook world had counted him as an outcast he had been rejected the message had seemingly been rejected he could not see any results sometimes you ever been in a in a setting in a situation sometimes you don't see results you're looking for results and sometimes you're not seeing results it can discourage you I'm preaching to myself as much as I'm preaching to you but God brought down the best cook and he with the softest hands God who's going to care for his servant his servant had done everything that God had asked him to do he rose up that angel was there for the brem said he just wasn't you know moving his head over the brow and hanison Elisha you stood for the Lord he's taking care of you now just just just eat this now going back to sleep God not only provided the juniper-tree he provided the drink and the sustenance he let him go back to sleep then he came back over the Bible says then the age of the Lord came a second time and woke him up and said my John come on you gonna you got to rise up you need to you need to eat and Elisha you know brother Branham to say it like this he said Elisha his little frail hands were shaken when they woke him up and he was trying to wipe his eyes and and get him open his humanity the weakness the frailty it was on display he was alone just where God wanted him and he told him arise and eat you've got to raise up and eat he said because the journey is too great for you there's no way Elisha could have went forward any further if God hadn't sustained him he had a need for strength he was in a time of despair he needed strength for him he didn't see a journey ahead of him he didn't know what would lay ahead of him but God knew there are plans there are things yet that you are to do in the midst of trouble God provided care for his servant you know there's a need for strength let me just say this to you the scripture would talk about it in the book of first John chapter 3 and it would talk about the young men youth the strength of your youth stamina that you have as young people as young men and young women but even in your natural strength when it comes to walking with the Lord you need more than your natural strip you need God's strength to back up and to flow through your natural strength because Isaiah said in Isaiah chapter 40 that even the youth would get faint and weary as is talking in a very this is the Holy Spirit talking in a in a deep level there and Isaiah's talking about the inner part of an individual he's talking about that though the Eagles need to renew their strength if that renew wait on the Lord renew their strength they'll mount up think of this work we're living in the time here that what lays before us we need strength for the journey that's before us last year ain't good enough last month ain't good enough you've got to have strength for the journey right now hallelujah God came and he touched him once you think of this here program said God laid him down under the juniper tree and put him to sleep so he could rest awhile huh my did he not have a lot to do he did was it not things that had to be carried out he did but God knew he needed rest might say after liquor preach here sometimes as I've said here in moments ago we need rest brother Brennan said you know many times brother Brown say well I'd rather wear out than rust out but then balance that on down in the message there were others that brother branham said I've got a word from the Lord to take to that brother that it's not his business to try to do all the work I said thank you Lord you see go and go with the desire but God had come to a place the mind of Christ had pulled back in this moment where the brem said he knew he was hungry he woke him up an angel touched him and there were some cakes baked and laying on the coals and he ate the cakes and went back to sleep again he must have really been tired that revival and their miracles that he had performed the supernatural upon him he was wore out and then the angel let him sleep a little more and when he woke him up again he said eat some more because the journey is very hard listen this and how oh how we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and to feast on the Word of God so that it'll give a strength not just listen to it feed on it that was God's complaint into the Sundays and AIDS they were listening to the word to gain positions and debate and laram said they did not receive it for practical out working in their life when we reckon we receive it as practical out working when we're standing there and recognizing that God I need you to come Lord and to make this manifest in my life let my heart let my spirit love my mind let all that is within me be an alignment Lord with you night after night go to the room and rest and come back the next morning fresh and eat some more for there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church I believe we have been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now we've played and frolicked as children but now we're gonna have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity Paul say when I was a child I speak as a child he's because he's sucked as a child but now it's time that we think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business in the words that the Holy Spirit would speak through fall for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed this is a time for maturity a time that to stand as men and women of God redeemed by the blood of the land born of his spirit here's God he's giving sustenance to his tired and weary servant that mind of Christ was pulled back Elijah didn't know the next move to make remember Elijah didn't go up there on Mount Carmel by his own thoughts or something he wanted to do it wasn't listen to me he did not go to Mount Carmel because he saw a need he's the need he saw but he gave himself to God and God said this is how I want to address that need prophets wait on God's leading the Lord had mightily used him but in the midst of a threat of one woman he ran what if you'd been living in that day there goes your prophet running but God was in control God had prepared a juniper tree for Elijah sometimes what the world closed defeat looks like when it's all washed up that's when God's getting ready to step in he's got to let it get to that place whoa breach with me now he's gotta let it get to that place with you and me when I get to the end of our way he's going to extreme Fannin larger though to me this is quite a paradox it really is because it's so as I said contrary to our thinking what we saw when Elijah steps out of we you know we know it Tishbite but we don't know we don't have any background there's no family there's nothing that we can go to it's like he just stepped out of a middle of nowhere that in itself is the same pattern God uses nobodies God uses nobodies because he has the hardest time getting somebody's to become nobodies that's what Paul said he said do you see cannot you see by your choosing how God is not chosen the great and mighty things to call into himself there's a view but is it God has chosen the weak things of this world to confound I think it would not be that way come on now you know our preacher it's just like when you're picking kickball teams or whatever more forgive me for dragging you back on the elementary playground but you know the person who can't kick well can't catch well is the last one on the wall and whatever team wants and takes them Foursquare tetherball whatever you going to do but not God God don't big based on abilities higher and gods picking was from his minds from the lines of his mind and we would look at those of God's children that would be earthen vessels that the glory of God would dwell in we would never pick them [Music] but after all it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord this mountain shall be removed god don't need our strength he needs our yielding I wonder if the prayer requests going in a church on it like pray for brother Elijah he said well I just feel a little down he's a little discouraged he's a little depressed he's a little upset he's wanting to go on home some of us say ho my that's terrible and it is we would feel because we would love brother Elijah but little do we know God said this place I've prepared it but God the situation's yeah I allowed the situation's to go like that you pulled back your mind yeah how did he know to come to this juniper tree well I knew this is where he was going to end up and his pathway was guided the whole time think about it brother harun he did not feel at that time going in there leaving his servant gone to the juniper tree I guarantee you he didn't feel spiritual he didn't feel spiritual you know what I'm talking about there's times you go in your prayer closer there's times when you're walking and things of God it's heavy in the mill you don't feel spiritual but God is leading hallelujahs sub dungeon you go through a surgery you go through a sickness you go through a trap you don't feel spiritual you're not to have that Mount Carmel every day in every situation but there's a need for juniper trees God needed Elijah to get weak he needed Elijah to get to a place where it's just him all alone ask you some questions this had monition of the angel of the Lord that came and woke him up the second time fed him the first time put him back to sleep woke him up the second time rise and eat for the journey is too great for thee he received strength what strength do you have where is your place of rest have some questions where did you make your place to let off the pressure well I'm all worked up so you know I just get on the computer sometimes that's just like pulling gas on fire think deep now what what do you make your place of rest when you're under pressure what do you make your refuge what are you feeding on is it giving you discernment to see impending judgment does it bring clarity to your walk with the Lord come on now this discernment in this hour you're discerning don't just be looking at what you see out here discern the spirits that are behind it the message of this hour it took us back from just looking at and just sing denominations it gets back to the root and the motive of it the motive of it is that it is a refusal to go on with the Word of God a rejection of his life and they take another life that's why they bear their names Eve was not called Eve she was called Adam but when other seed was found in her then she was called Eve which means mother of all living oh god help us the journey is too great for you you need strength from this meat I'm talking about this meat that is in due season God has sent us a message in this hour and as even keepers in the vineyard we are charged to give meat in due season but this is not based on a man's intellect it's God's work famine you know what famine is where you say well family you know it's a it's a lack of food famine ain't all together like a food famine is a lack of the proper nutrients let me just make it simple you can get hungry and grab your so-called Snickers bar and a few moments later your Sugar's done spiked and you're ready for another one you don't answer not proper nutrients you can be eaten but not getting proper nutrients you've got to be feeding the scripture said there'd be a famine for the hearing for the hearing where would it be at the famine would be in the hearing so it shows that within that this journey from this body of Duncan the journey were on is a journey from this dimension into that other dimension this journey that we are called upon right now is a journey that all of the ages have been waiting on amen the seven churches they have been marching in step they have marched in step and in beat with that word that God had given that out but they have been waiting and looking for the coming of the Lord Paul preached it Paul announced it Paul would express that of the rapture that was coming this journey is too great we need strength hallelujah to live a victorious life it's too great for you you need to give yourself strength from this meet you didn't bring your soul into rapture you don't catch you away from the world listen Satan is drawing listen to me now Satan is drawing a focus to his kingdom don't you thinking going down without a fuss he's trying to draw focus me to tell you something that devil is way too slick to try to pull you up a fifth of whiskey and pour you a glass here take this ain't no deception in that you've already overcome that he wants to try to bring it real close even within word and situations you see he's all about trying to get your focus off of the prize the Bible said look unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith [Applause] sames trying to draw it his attention the attention of the people to his kingdom look what his kingdom's made up of worry frustration enmity hatred hatred strife that's not God's kingdom let me just tell you something we ain't taking God's kingdom and trying to straighten out satan's kingdom we've received your kingdom that cannot be moved there is a land brother where we're going to [Applause] well I feel like preaching on the Millenium right now but I got to just hold that this is a time that we're living in where the Bible said that Satan is as a roaring lion going about he's got announcements he's got this seeking whom he may devour we're living in a time where he's getting ready to be cast out I said he's getting ready to be cast out and when he's cast out the Bible said in the Book of Revelations chapter 12 woe to the inhabitants of the earth then rather all these things and corn moles and plagues and everything else that ain't even been the head man it's been a demon in the place in the man of sin a demon has been there but when he is kicked out the demon that's been a placeholder is removed and the devil himself sets right down I don't plan on being here matter of fact I'm making plans daily not to even get involved with them [Applause] you're not going to be able to you're not going to be able to stem this tide without a proper diet he went independent strength of this meat let me just narrowed this down he went into strength of this meat for 40 days and 40 nights brother David that was more than just organic from Whole Foods or wherever it is on where you get this stuff this wasn't man-made engine ingenuity man didn't provide this food let me remind you man hasn't provided the food that we're eating on the Bible has been with us for hundreds of years but when blood comes along brother he takes seed and it becomes bread it becomes realize to us no longer just seed promises it becomes life to us it becomes our daily bread it becomes everything to us and it keeps on multiplying but Briony don't ever run out hallelujah 40 is temptation he went in the power of this meat through every temptation and they just tell you something greater is He that is in you there is power in this word pajamas powers in this word you can be sent here covered over with all kinds of spirits you can be sitting you're covering over with all sorts of things about your life but all you've got to do is believe in him that's freaking to you hallelujah Satan starts losing ground you might be under a juniper tree I can't go on I just can't go on I just can't keep pushing but God knows right where you're at [Applause] he's seen do it this place has been provided for you my strength is all gone I just don't feel like they can make another step this place is for you let me just tell you something the God that prepared that juniper tree was there to meet his servant the places God prepares he's there to meet you Elijah what are you doing here what do us now here Aichi are he has if God didn't know brother answers if God didn't know but God needs Elijah to come to his end in the message perfect strength where the bream talks about God allowed all of the church in that day all of that to walk away from Elijah Elijah took off running and Elijah was in a place of such weakness but God said this is where I want but Lord what's gonna happen I'm gonna cap his ministry cap his ministry you shouldn't it be another quadruple Mount Carmel experience oh this is gonna be greater how is this gonna be greater because I am going to fully achieve the purpose that I've intended to achieve through his life and God would allow this brother brand would bring it in perfect strength God would allow Elijah to get to his in so much that it Elijah said I'm the only one I've done this what they've done is they've slayed your prophets they've done this they've done that remember how Paul picked it up in Romans 11 how did he talk to you about Elijah was interceding against Israel or look what they've done look what they've done look what they've done look at it oh this was God's justice but God's mercy said I've got 7000 there's a real net they're very small but I've got a rim that [Applause] you maybe don't see the effect of your message out there but I want you to know there is 7,000 that when you have yielded and courage has been given to them they're gonna stand now [Applause] we need those times I said we need those times we need those times when we feel like that our wheels are just spinning and it don't seem like there's no results we need those times for God sometimes they remind us but God doesn't always come down when we're crying about it God doesn't always come down when we're complaining about it but it's when we finally get to a place because the complaining doesn't invite him on the scene but when we get your place to say Lord I need you to fulfill this word in me Lord I can't do it on my own that's what maturity brings it brings a realization of our need for him let me just say this to you it might be a simple carnal example but I'm telling you right now my wife that little sweet heart that God gave me I need her more now than what I thought I did when we got married I realize now that Lord God haha I need her I need her I need her coming that's just here in this thing this time she is my best friend there's nobody I can talk to nobody can speak to me like she can how much more God you know if that means brother Carlos I know right now I need him more than ever but Trevor my strength won't cut it I need him brother Tommy my strength won't cut it I need his strength [Music] just like God let Elijah get to this place to where he'd come to the end of his way God said this what I wanted to hear I wanted to hear that take me on home I'm no better than my father's I'm the only one left that's just what I wanted to hear he's in a cave now now Carmen juniper tree forty days to a cave this listen look what the strength of this meat did the strength of this meat carried him to the next appointed place I thought the third pool is just a no it's a it's not a public show it's not a public show look away to Jesus brother bream said don't ever let him tell you you're gonna be walking into hospitals and empty in her mouth you're not gonna be doing that that's not the working of the third pool the working of the third pool oh yeah miracles signs wonders yes but the overcoming this is individually God capping lives God comes and caps your life he caps my life in the way that he chooses here is Elijah what do us down here he's in a cave maybe he's quarantined is it okay what's the use of going out there nobody else I'm the only one God comes down and calls him out of there here comes a wind the Lord brings a wind Lord brings earthquake and he brings a fire but what followed that was a still small voice all of that earthquake wind and fire were all effects of God moving but it was the still small voice that calls the Prophet to wrap his face with his mantle and come out and talk to the Lord you see that cave that still small voice you can experience a lot of earthquake wind and fire but there's nothing that'll settle your soul like a still small voice from God after it's all said and done after the shouting after the jumping after the running I believe in that as much as anybody else but you know what I'm talking about when that's all said and done a still small voice is where you stand in authority God has spoke to you person and it's just it's settled let me just say something to you you watch how God can move so precisely in a service he'll move just like that supernatural star that guided the wise men and nobody else saw it it came to Jerusalem and it went out but when they left out of Jerusalem when none of the people could answer him as soon as they left out of Jerusalem that star came back to him and the started Adam to where it was taking him they thought Jerusalem might be able to help him you think a church a church you know maybe the church should be able to help but remember God is the one who has been dealing with your life sure some of you started in a church or you started here maybe God dealt with your life maybe in a Baptist Church or a Pentecostal Church or you know maybe it was even that a Catholic Church it might be hard might blow your mind about it but remember if that Catholic is trusting in Jesus Christ they mean their part of the bride but they're saved but you see a man had just been part of your journey God had something more for you but in the cave is where now God calls him out and he speaks to him in a steel small voice Elijah is at his end he can't take another step he can't go forward he doesn't see anything in front of him all he all he can eat weary he's worn he doesn't see why should I go on I'm the only one but God comes and strengthens him lets him know of the effect of the word but it's a still small voice that speaks to him God was letting him know what took place on Mount Carmel yeah there was a lot of noise there was a lot of movement but what you didn't see was that still small voice that spook to that 7000 you know it's deep things things that are great they don't make a lot of noise think about how much noise you make in the middle the night but getting a glass of water or even during the day and yet the Sun drinks up billions millions of gallons whatever it is don't you got the point evaporating it you don't hear it you don't hear going on when the daybreak comes on you hear people sometimes flickering on lights and everything else but when the day breaks you don't hear it a wagon that is empty you hear it but when it's loaded you don't hear it as much it's the great things are the things that are still that are quiet it's God moves in and that stillness and once you think about this cave this cave today it's not a man may it's not a cave that's up in Horeb but this cave today that God calling you to calling me to this cave it might be a cave in your spirit it might be a cave in your mind it might be the cave in your soul and God is speaking to our hearts there's things let me just say it's to you very clearly there's things sometimes that you can get to looking at within your life let me just say the scripture said if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart there might be things that you've got that are condemning you because you know you're not standing where you need to stand with God at one time you were fervent with God but you've lost your fervency and you started feeding on other things instead of the Word of God you see what happens when sin starts in alive and there's things that you fail to make right you say brother Samuel ain't no way I can make it right there's a blood for you to make it right there is a Holy Ghost that says make it right I mean you say it in terms get that monkey off your back there might be things in your spirit that is so poor up maybe things that you've set maybe light as you've told may be things you shouldn't have said maybe a way you shouldn't have talked to your wife or talked to your husband you got to make that right this is what the cave is for is to come to that place and say God I need you Lord I'm sorry Lord God forgive me that's all it takes it takes a real pouring out in your heart come on church it takes a real pouring out God brings us to this place why God's there he's not away from you he meets you there why you need strength for the journey that's before you God wants to use you hey listen Elijah God wants to use you there's three things you have left to do in order for Jehu Elijah Jehu and hay ZL to be anointed you got anoint Elisha remember the three things God told Elijah to do he anointed Elijah but it was Elijah that did the other two same God working through another vessel but it's necessary all those parts that are there got to work his brother Brent said sometimes in a cave of our memory there's any condemnation lay it out before God say Lord forgive me you win a straight god forgive me don't let the devil put you don't listen it ain't it is not God that puts you back in the cave God doesn't keep you remember he spoke to Elijah to draw him out of that cave to call him out of that cave into that place where God can let him see it's a still small voice that you need Elijah it's a still small voice that you need to minister to your life it's a still small voice for those of you this morning you're without strength in your life and you've come to a spot to say I'm not the end of my road let me just help you if you say I can't do it it's got to go a little bit deeper I agree you can't do it but if you can say Lord I can't do it I need you to do it Lord I need you to do it Lord I can't turn my life around I need you Lord help me Lord you wants God step on the scene he come right into that cave to that place right there in your life God will step right on the scene I wonder here this morning that many say Lord I want to renewal I need to renew I'm weary so tired I need a renewal Lord I need a refreshing remember this refreshing it doesn't just come without confession let everything if there's anything at all just lay it out you don't have to search real deep if there's anything right there that's before in your mind to your heart just lay it out say God forgive me cleanse me Lord and let him come by in that still small voice and let him strengthen you he's got to work for you to do this is a camping it's a camping this working of this furtherance of the minute it's a camping Matthew six he's whosoever will hide himself and his closet and pray I will hear and he the father who sees in secret will reward thee openly it's not a public show it's a work that's taking place right inside the life of the individual it's not a little room somewhere you're going to it's right here you meet you right here I say Lord all of us if you need the Lord this morning if you need that just don't take this as just another service but really say God I need you I need your strength Lord I need you Lord God I need your help Lord I can do nothing on my own I give myself to your Lord help me help me Lord help me as a husband and need you Lord though she has a wife lord I need you as a father as a mother as a grandfather Graham I need your Lord as a brother as a sister as a pastor as a trustee as a deacon as a song mayor I need you Lord I need you I need you let's pray father you're Jesus I give this audience of myself Lord we're in your hands these needs that Lord that you would speak to this morning you would speak to our hearts strength for the journey that's before us it's not according Lord to the minds of man you come in such simplicity like the star that moved the wise men as your prophet would tell us he said that star can move right through an audience of people lives will be changed hearts are become so aligned with you the Scriptures would speak the kingdom of God cometh without observation now Lord I've prayed with and prayed for many many people many of your children but there's one thing that I can't see unless you would help me to see it it always begins it's in their heart you're you stood on the outside where they put you out on the outside of the church knocking in Revelations three who ever hear my voice and will open the door I will come in now Lord I can't no other man can bring a heart to that place but you're the one to bring a heart to that prepared place that you have for it to where it's willing to lay down that you can step in I pray God that even if they're not for that point yet I pray that God let these be words if they would take with them yes it would be words that when they lay their head on their pillow at night they think about it even become Lord of prayer in their heart that would say God bring me to that place that my pastor is talking about through your word bring me to that place Lord where I'm willing to lay it all down I got too much I'm trying to solve too much I'm trying to get right like a leopard you try to lick your sponsor they only stand out more you can't take away your spots you don't have the power but there is power in the blood of the Lamb there's power to loosen you it set you free not praying for you this morning father as many of your children here they've already received that experience with you they've had a cave experience Lord sometimes in the course of life your prophet talked about when you brought him into a little cave he had a little situation with that tax case and you called him into a cave he had to get condemnation away from his heart you gave that as an example to us to me I can so relate to a man like that I appreciate dear God that he he never tried to hide his humanity it just shows your greatness Lord but what an encouragement is I read Lord through the message over the years of listening and listening and listening I find over and over I find that the Lord is I'm listening to the message over and over not just in perfect strength but I find your prophet making the statements like he did in perfect strength when he said this Tabernacle needs a killing and I need one with it when he would say we're too strong when he would say in images of Christ while the Tabernacles have a revival I want to have a revival I want more of the Holy Ghost to take over more of William Branham he said I know that it'll take more it'll take more than just reading it'll take him to do it how so Reid I hear your prophet saying or this statements it struck me so much one of the other places when he was talking about the on coming of the third pole he told brother Leo write this down he said that will not be so much a change in my ministry as it will be a change in me Oh God that's what you're doing circumstances situations test trials these prepared places Lord that we wouldn't choose no one would choose as far as to say to feel the way that Elijah felt in yet Lord we've all been there maybe some are there this morning but that was a prepared place it was all in your orchestration now then don't seem very glorious to us but it Lord it's what you were going to bring out of that out of the juniper tree out of the cave lord I pray for your children right now each of us Lord [Music] you said Lord if there be any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let anoint them with oil and if there be any sin it shall be forgiven you said if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness lord I pray they write here this morning it'd be a fresh cleansing Lord I pray that God that your spirit would just move for every life and every heart right now may we leave out of this place this morning as we return to our homes and places may we leave out of here a better people more determined may we leave out of here Lord God where we've let everything down before you [Music] granted Lord we pray in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen they're already gone if you'd like to stand you can [Music] it's my hand [Music] for me

halleluyah halleluyah think about it for a moment Paul would write under inspiration he was crucified in weakness but he was raised in power think about it says in Isaiah 53 everybody was just looking on oh he was such a great man why don't the Angels come and deliver him now they were mocking I think the Bible says God seen the travail of his soul and was satisfied what no one else knew was taking place was the greatest victory he already won the victory in Gethsemane it's being manifest right here but the rest of world didn't see it even caught satan by surprise here's the great the great one but you see it took that that weakness coming to that place but then God stepped in and raised him on that Easter morning at times how God brings us into those times not just in the new birth but then even after that then what his power might strengthen us my lift is up in the valley he restores my soul [Music] aren't you grateful to the Lord I just I just appreciate it so much they're just such a sweetness of his spirit just a a renewing you know it's good to fill those times like was when you first got saved it's good to feel those times go out just sweeping down everything is cleared out
