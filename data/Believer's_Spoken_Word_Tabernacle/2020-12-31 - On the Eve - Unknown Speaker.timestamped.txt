[39:54] than when we believe
[39:57] the night is far spent the day is at
[40:00] hand
[40:01] let us therefore cast off the works of
[40:03] darkness
[40:04] and let us put on the armor of light let
[40:07] us walk honestly in the day
[40:09] not in rioting and in drunkenness but in
[40:12] shame
[40:13] not in chambering in wantedness not in
[40:15] strife
[40:16] and envy but put ye on the lord jesus
[40:20] christ that that
[40:21] that phrase you would see that very much
[40:23] in the scriptures
[40:25] it's to sink into the garment and the
[40:27] clothing
[40:28] put ye on the lord jesus christ and make
[40:31] not
[40:31] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[40:34] lust thereof
[40:36] in ii peter chapter 3 verse 9
[40:40] peter would write in this manner
[40:43] the conditions are are are given in the
[40:46] first
[40:47] scripture in the first scriptures of
[40:49] this chapter
[40:51] scoffers conditions and you know brother
[40:54] branham would take
[40:55] time and he would deal with
[40:59] conditions that would exist we know a
[41:01] promise that we're waiting on
[41:03] of the rapture but he would take being
[41:06] pressed of god
[41:07] to show us even conditions that would
[41:10] exist
[41:12] even coming into that of the rapture
[41:14] brother branham would say it
[41:16] from works as faith expressed then he
[41:18] would go into the message the rapture
[41:19] and he would read
[41:21] psalms 27 and he would say it in this
[41:24] matter i want to read this
[41:26] for a background for the rapture a
[41:29] background has a lot to say
[41:31] it's one thing for you to have a
[41:33] testimony
[41:34] and what really makes a testimony is is
[41:37] the background
[41:38] is to think god in this age that it is
[41:41] an
[41:42] age of god godlessness
[41:45] it's an age of hatred it's an age that
[41:49] where the bible will just plainly say in
[41:50] the book of romans
[41:51] haters of god and so we
[41:55] find all of these conditions but yet
[41:57] it's in the midst of this age right here
[42:00] that god is taking a people in rapture
[42:04] it's a paradox and so he he lets it be
[42:08] known they're scoffers
[42:09] somebody's got to fulfill that part of
[42:11] the scripture
[42:13] that's not the part that i want to
[42:14] fulfill amen
[42:17] and first in verse let's go to verse 9.
[42:20] the lord
[42:21] is not slack concerning his promise as
[42:24] some men
[42:25] count slackness but is long-suffering to
[42:27] us word
[42:28] not willing that any should perish but
[42:31] that all should come to repentance
[42:33] but the day of the lord will come as
[42:36] a thief in the night in the which the
[42:40] heavens shall pass away with a great
[42:42] noise
[42:43] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[42:44] heat the earth also and the works
[42:47] that are therein shall be burned up
[42:50] seeing then that all these things shall
[42:52] be dissolved what manner of persons
[42:54] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[42:58] and godliness looking for and hastening
[43:02] unto the coming of the day of god
[43:05] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[43:07] be dissolved and the elements shall melt
[43:10] with fervent heat nevertheless we
[43:13] according to his promise
[43:15] look for new heavens and a new earth
[43:19] wherein dwelleth righteousness i want
[43:21] you to look at this very clearly
[43:23] nevertheless according to his promise
[43:24] this is not just
[43:26] the written promise but it is the living
[43:28] god
[43:29] who has had interpreted the written
[43:31] promise
[43:33] it's his it's the anointing that comes
[43:36] upon our eyes to see
[43:38] the promise that this is the day and
[43:41] this is the fulfillment this is the
[43:43] pathway of this promise
[43:45] and to see that we're a part of it so
[43:47] nevertheless we according to his promise
[43:49] look for new heavens and a new earth
[43:51] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[43:54] beloved seeing that you look for such
[43:56] things
[43:57] be diligent that you may be found of him
[44:00] in peace without spout and
[44:04] blame amen may god bless you as you're
[44:07] being seated bless his word
[44:10] brown you know he would many times when
[44:13] we
[44:13] look at this and brother branham would
[44:15] approach coming into
[44:19] a new year's eve and and i know that
[44:21] that many
[44:22] uh you know i would hear brother branham
[44:24] ask different ones have you already
[44:26] given your new year's eve message and
[44:28] and there were things that god was just
[44:30] dealing with the culmination of the year
[44:32] things that what god has already done
[44:35] what he's been fulfilling and things
[44:37] that then through that what we are to
[44:39] look forward to and i i look at this
[44:42] that many times you know as the question
[44:46] would come up and brother branham would
[44:48] reiterate it to us he said
[44:49] people have asked me the question what
[44:51] do you think about
[44:52] the future and you know he says i don't
[44:55] know what the future holds
[44:57] but i know who holds the future and so
[45:00] that's the thing he said if i can keep
[45:02] acquainted with him and i think that's
[45:05] the real
[45:06] objective and i want to just just speak
[45:09] just for a few moments on just three
[45:11] simple words
[45:12] on the eve on the eve
[45:15] now when we look at this you know on the
[45:18] eve when we
[45:19] we have a few days of the year of times
[45:23] that we have on our calendar such as we
[45:25] have a christmas eve and here we are
[45:28] today gathered in a
[45:29] new year's eve and the eaves themselves
[45:32] are
[45:33] those things that are a precursor or
[45:36] what comes
[45:37] ahead of time of that day it's something
[45:40] it's one day
[45:41] that leads right into an another day
[45:44] there's no gap
[45:45] between the eve and then the next day
[45:48] matter of fact it rolls from right from
[45:50] the eve right into the next day
[45:53] and so we recognize that even within
[45:56] thinking of this
[45:57] we when you're on the eve of anything
[46:00] of an actual event the eve itself
[46:04] is when when it's captured and
[46:06] recognized it
[46:08] creates an expectation it creates
[46:11] an anticipation and and with that uh
[46:15] a real expectation and an anticipation
[46:18] when it is
[46:19] when it is rightly in tune then
[46:22] it is it is viewed and is received
[46:25] as a time of preparation remember
[46:29] in the days of the lord jesus many
[46:32] were looking for a promise of the word
[46:34] to be fulfilled
[46:36] and they were looking for it but yet
[46:39] when it came
[46:40] they were they were caught off guard
[46:43] and how that god how it would even come
[46:46] and it
[46:47] bypassed as paul said the princes of
[46:50] this world
[46:51] he's talking about the intellects the
[46:54] reasoning
[46:55] and this is what jesus said it's beyond
[46:57] that father i think the thou has
[46:59] hid it from that of the smart and the
[47:02] intellect and the great reasoners but
[47:05] you have revealed it unto babes
[47:08] and brother ramon always had this on
[47:10] such as would learn
[47:12] it deals with a receptive heart a
[47:14] humility that's
[47:15] able to be taught by god at that it's
[47:18] something that you and i
[47:19] did not give ourselves but when we look
[47:22] at this on the eve
[47:23] because i certainly believe with the
[47:26] opening scriptures we read
[47:28] we are living on the eve of the change
[47:31] of the body
[47:32] we are living on the eve of the rapture
[47:36] we are living on the eve of of of our
[47:40] loved ones appearing we are living on
[47:42] the eve
[47:42] you see there's no other age to come
[47:47] there's no other message to come the
[47:50] star
[47:51] that has arose uh remember the same
[47:54] morning star
[47:55] is the same evening star it just depends
[47:58] on the position
[47:59] of where you're at that star remember
[48:01] the wise men
[48:02] were in the east then the star was in
[48:05] the west and they traveled
[48:07] unto the west we are in the east we have
[48:09] seen a star
[48:10] and to think of how that in the time
[48:13] that we are living in
[48:15] we recognize this is a this is a
[48:17] finality
[48:18] of a time that we're living in we do not
[48:21] have exact dates
[48:23] nor do we even try to worry or to even
[48:26] expend
[48:27] time in trying to find the day or the
[48:30] hour
[48:31] jesus said no man knoweth the day nor
[48:34] the hour
[48:34] so we're aware that there's certain
[48:36] things that we're not to expend
[48:38] our energies for but what are we to do
[48:41] we are to recognize
[48:43] this is the time of his coming and then
[48:46] recognizing that we're in a state of
[48:48] alertness
[48:49] we're in a state of watchfulness we're
[48:51] in a state to where we're watching
[48:53] what steps we're taking we're ensuring
[48:56] that our lives
[48:57] are not becoming burdened but rather
[48:59] we're unloading
[49:00] we're making ourselves light and and
[49:03] ready
[49:03] for the translation this is the effect
[49:06] of when the eve is revealed that this is
[49:09] there is an effect
[49:11] upon the lives of the people you know
[49:13] there's many eaves
[49:14] that that are given down through
[49:17] scripture
[49:18] such as you'll find on the feast days
[49:20] it'll say on the moral
[49:22] you'll find things that god will place
[49:25] as as an anticipation
[49:27] as an expectation you find that even
[49:30] where god would speak you know
[49:32] uh to to joshua in three days
[49:35] tell the people to prepare themselves
[49:37] you're going over the jordan
[49:39] god set the eve of expectation
[49:42] and when it drew near god was there to
[49:45] declare
[49:46] this is the eve of the time of the
[49:49] crossing you see
[49:50] man can't declare the ease because the
[49:54] eve
[49:54] is is ordained for there are people
[49:58] who are part of the eve that are to move
[50:01] into that day
[50:02] in other words they are part of this day
[50:05] that is dawning
[50:06] that leads us into that new day so we
[50:09] recognize that with this
[50:11] in mind this is why paul would say you
[50:14] are not
[50:14] children of the night but of the day
[50:17] paul would write be not
[50:18] drunken he's talking about overwhelmed
[50:22] and carried about with the things of
[50:24] this world
[50:25] to where you become intoxicated with it
[50:28] you saw there's an eve there was even an
[50:31] eve on an easter morning
[50:33] where as the scripture had prophesied
[50:36] and jesus stood there and he declared it
[50:39] destroy this temple in three days i'll
[50:41] raise it up again
[50:42] but remember the disciples had forgot
[50:44] they had
[50:45] now been under a gloom they forgot about
[50:47] that because it wasn't happening
[50:49] how they thought it should happen but
[50:51] god that did not stop god
[50:53] from fulfilling his word
[50:57] he fulfilled it anyhow
[51:00] and he came to them and he let them know
[51:03] this is the fulfillment of the word and
[51:06] indeed
[51:07] i am the fulfillment of the word i'm not
[51:09] the fulfillment of your thoughts
[51:11] but i am the fulfillment of the word you
[51:14] see the word
[51:15] came to change their thoughts and line
[51:17] their thoughts
[51:18] with god's thoughts because there was a
[51:22] desire that god himself would come
[51:25] and bring a transformation in their
[51:27] lives so when they went up there on the
[51:29] day of pentecost
[51:30] it was an eve and they were waiting
[51:34] that day to break into their lives
[51:37] you see the eve made them ready for the
[51:40] day
[51:41] and so when we think of this you know
[51:44] down through time we think of
[51:46] you know when uh the emancipation
[51:49] proclamation was wrote
[51:50] and in there in the writing it was
[51:53] declared
[51:54] that those who were being held as slaves
[51:57] that they could go free but even though
[52:00] the documents said
[52:01] you could go free it was allotted a
[52:03] specified
[52:05] time it said on a certain date
[52:08] and it had to be on that date was when
[52:10] the sun
[52:11] would arise then the slaves could go
[52:14] free so here was a written document
[52:16] and there was people who were tied in to
[52:19] the day
[52:20] they were on the eve of that day as as
[52:22] you know brother randall would describe
[52:24] it and history records it
[52:26] they were there there was some down in
[52:28] the valley where the encampment was
[52:30] and they had slaves on the way up that
[52:32] mountain side
[52:33] they were holding hands by hand they had
[52:36] somebody
[52:36] up on top of that mountain on the peak
[52:38] up there that was able to say
[52:41] the sun is arising and able to holler
[52:44] back down there to the slaves and let
[52:46] them know your
[52:47] time of liberty what the promise in the
[52:50] document
[52:51] has said the son is now declaring
[52:54] you are free somebody
[52:58] had to see the sun come up and declare
[53:00] it down in the valley
[53:03] it was an eve that led to the day
[53:06] in the time of the first exodus
[53:09] everything was mounting
[53:11] the evening time everything was drawn
[53:14] close
[53:16] you find many events were happening
[53:19] plagues things were taking place in
[53:22] egypt god sent a message to declare
[53:25] this is the time to leave it didn't
[53:28] happen the way the people thought it
[53:30] should happen
[53:31] the people didn't realize that that that
[53:34] it was there was going to be
[53:35] some challenges and satan is always
[53:39] there
[53:39] to challenge and to oppose the word he'd
[53:42] do the same thing
[53:43] in your life he's there to try to
[53:46] challenge
[53:47] and oppose the word but you see that
[53:50] don't stop god
[53:51] even in a time where you and i could you
[53:54] know
[53:54] look and we can wonder it doesn't stop
[53:56] god god's word
[53:58] is going to be fulfilled and god is
[54:00] fulfilling his word
[54:01] listen my brother and sister it is not
[54:03] up to you and i to get ourselves to
[54:05] believe
[54:05] it is god coming on the scene that he's
[54:08] the one who moves
[54:09] and stimulates and stirs and builds up
[54:12] our faith
[54:13] that's the same way it is for the
[54:14] rapture it is not you and i
[54:16] building ourselves up but it is god that
[54:19] is building us up
[54:20] and brother when that morning rises and
[54:23] our loved ones appear before us
[54:25] i'm telling you you talking about a
[54:27] stimulation
[54:28] it will release a body change around
[54:31] this world
[54:32] hands that are tied together there will
[54:35] be a cry
[54:36] of liberty it's time for the atoms to
[54:38] change
[54:39] it's time for the bodies to change
[54:42] goodbye
[54:42] world goodbye
[54:44] [Music]
[54:46] it was a time of exodus
[54:50] there came a final moment get the lamb
[54:53] slay the lamb take the lamb apply apply
[54:56] the blood
[54:57] you see this time of anticipation
[55:01] on the eve they had to apply
[55:04] the blood and when they applied the
[55:06] blood that was the necessary
[55:09] requirement of preparation
[55:13] when they applied that it cleared
[55:16] their past and gave them a
[55:20] clear future that blood being applied
[55:24] it showed they were identified with the
[55:27] covenant
[55:28] that the living god had made to abraham
[55:32] confirmed to him make real to him
[55:35] and then he had raised up his servant
[55:38] moses
[55:38] to preach under the authority of that
[55:41] covenant
[55:42] being revealed to a covenant people they
[55:45] were identified
[55:46] with the god of abraham
[55:49] hallelujah you see
[55:53] this is where on the eve that we stand
[55:56] the bible says this in psalm 62
[56:01] look at this scripture truly
[56:05] my soul waiteth upon god
[56:09] from him cometh my salvation
[56:13] he only is my rock and my salvation
[56:18] he is my defense i
[56:21] shall not be greatly moved
[56:25] how long will you imagine mischief
[56:27] against a man
[56:29] you shall be slaying all of you as a
[56:31] bowing wall
[56:32] shall you be and as a tolerant fan this
[56:35] is talking about rising up against the
[56:36] vindicated word
[56:38] the living lord jesus christ verse 4
[56:42] they only consult look what they do to
[56:45] cast
[56:45] him down from his excellency
[56:48] they delight in lies they bless with
[56:52] their mouth
[56:52] but they curse inwardly are you with me
[56:56] my soul so notice what david's talking
[56:58] about this is a condition
[57:01] this is a condition remember the words
[57:04] out here don't create an atmosphere
[57:06] words creating an atmosphere come from
[57:08] the atmosphere that's within
[57:10] america is that right that's why there's
[57:12] got to be an atmosphere on the inside
[57:14] then when the words come out it's not
[57:16] just words but jesus said my words
[57:19] they are spirit and life they come out
[57:21] with the atmosphere of god to create
[57:26] he noticed this my soul wait thou only
[57:29] upon god
[57:30] for my expectation is from him he only
[57:33] is my rock and my salvation
[57:35] he is my defense i shall not be moved in
[57:40] god is my salvation and my glory
[57:43] the rock of my strength and my refuge is
[57:46] in god
[57:48] he's your rock he's your revelation
[57:52] revelation cannot be explained you can't
[57:54] break it down on paper
[57:56] but it's a reality inside of your life
[57:59] hallelujah it's an anchor it's a rock
[58:02] storms may come
[58:04] tests may come but there's a greater
[58:06] reality on the
[58:08] inside it's the revelation of god that
[58:11] you are
[58:11] anchored in jesus christ
[58:15] it's a rock that we are built upon
[58:18] oh glory be to god trust in him
[58:22] look at this trust in him at all times
[58:26] g people pour out your heart before him
[58:29] god is a refuge for us
[58:32] we think about you know a new year
[58:35] and you know many times people look at a
[58:38] new year and i don't want to say
[58:39] just people i say for every one of us
[58:42] you know a new year
[58:43] sometimes you know you have different
[58:45] goals or different things you want to
[58:47] be able to accomplish i think the first
[58:49] things that we ought to be able to
[58:51] really
[58:52] uh focus on is be able to evaluate
[58:55] spiritually but we don't have to wait
[58:57] till december 31st to do that
[59:00] really for a believer it's every day of
[59:02] your life there's a tension
[59:04] that you've added to your life when you
[59:05] became a believer and that tension that
[59:07] goes on in your heart
[59:08] am i pleasing to my lord that's daily
[59:12] that's
[59:12] it's being taken up daily there's an
[59:14] inventory but
[59:15] to think that within this time and the
[59:18] year that you know as we're living
[59:20] it brings you know it brings a new hope
[59:23] because
[59:24] we also know that we are one year closer
[59:27] to the coming of the lord this day
[59:30] has passed for one day closer to the
[59:33] coming of the
[59:34] hour has passed we're one hour closer so
[59:37] in this as a believer we do not want to
[59:40] look back
[59:41] we want to look forward people you know
[59:44] we could say now i wish we could go back
[59:46] to 20
[59:47] 19. and i don't know you know as far as
[59:50] with
[59:50] the inconveniences and everything that's
[59:52] happened in 2020
[59:54] but you know the reality of it is
[59:57] godding never took a break in 2020
[1:00:00] he's still the same god he's still a
[1:00:02] healer
[1:00:03] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:00:05] forever
[1:00:07] glory be to god he's the same god these
[1:00:10] things that happen are opportunities for
[1:00:13] god to make himself known
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:16] brother tells us right in the times of
[1:00:18] junction that's when omnipotence speaks
[1:00:21] and declares itself to think of it
[1:00:25] not to turn a new page you know you
[1:00:28] think of how
[1:00:28] brother ran talks about a man you know
[1:00:30] opening up you know the paper and
[1:00:32] his wife said what's in the paper he
[1:00:34] said same old stuff
[1:00:36] just different people doing it is that
[1:00:38] right
[1:00:39] it's a new page it's a new paper you see
[1:00:42] this is why
[1:00:43] for a new year many people have
[1:00:45] resolutions
[1:00:46] or they make promises you know many
[1:00:48] people get exercise equipment
[1:00:50] just you'll go to the garage sale in
[1:00:52] march they'll be selling it you'll get
[1:00:53] it dirt cheap just if you can hold out a
[1:00:54] little bit
[1:00:55] because that soon wears off all day oh
[1:00:57] man i'm going to get this and get that
[1:00:59] you can just go to a good garage sale
[1:01:00] you'll get one for dirt cheap because
[1:01:02] it'll either be in the basement or it'll
[1:01:04] be in the garage but samuel that's very
[1:01:05] low of people
[1:01:06] you know how it is you you know how it
[1:01:09] is there are things
[1:01:10] that sometimes that we've intended to do
[1:01:12] and you find out a year later ah
[1:01:14] a year later i still ain't painted that
[1:01:15] room yet what happened between that time
[1:01:18] what happened life right is that right
[1:01:21] so sometimes when we look at the mix of
[1:01:23] this we just don't want to turn a new
[1:01:25] page because
[1:01:26] we realize turning a new page will never
[1:01:28] ever change
[1:01:30] time doesn't change nobody
[1:01:33] is that right you know as i've thought
[1:01:36] i've heard it said so far
[1:01:37] very very clearly you take a a a a young
[1:01:40] man that's a dirty man
[1:01:42] you let him become a middle-aged man
[1:01:43] he'll be a dirty middle-aged man
[1:01:46] if he keeps on he'll be in the nursing
[1:01:48] home a dirty old man
[1:01:50] why time don't change you can turn
[1:01:53] try to turn a new page but there's one
[1:01:56] who can take the control
[1:01:58] of your life brother he don't turn a new
[1:02:00] page but he transforms your
[1:02:05] your life becomes a new life not that
[1:02:08] you've got to live
[1:02:09] it's him living it through you see this
[1:02:12] is why
[1:02:12] that as paul would say paul would make
[1:02:15] the declaration
[1:02:16] i i i i'm here not to count myself he
[1:02:19] said
[1:02:20] as though i have apprehended but i reach
[1:02:22] toward those things that are
[1:02:24] before me and he says looking you know
[1:02:27] counting those things that you know
[1:02:29] forgetting what's behind me
[1:02:31] and i reach forward to watch before me
[1:02:34] you know in order to reach before you
[1:02:36] you've got to have authority to forget
[1:02:38] what's behind you
[1:02:39] so there's got to be a greater power
[1:02:42] than our mind
[1:02:44] there's got to be a power that if satan
[1:02:46] can try to bring something up
[1:02:48] in your mind there's got to be a power
[1:02:51] that's greater
[1:02:52] than any memory brother there's got to
[1:02:54] be a power to say
[1:02:56] that's not who i am that's who i used to
[1:03:00] be
[1:03:00] but that old man don't live here no more
[1:03:04] you're not tied to the past that's how
[1:03:08] you can reach to the future
[1:03:11] that right so i want to press toward the
[1:03:14] mark of the high calling
[1:03:15] of jesus christ i want to reach out
[1:03:18] reach out to that day itself till we
[1:03:21] stand
[1:03:22] within that moment in a complete
[1:03:24] identification
[1:03:26] when all time fades into eternity
[1:03:30] you see let me just say it like this
[1:03:32] when we talk about future
[1:03:34] you know somebody can say well you're
[1:03:37] going to be all right
[1:03:39] now i believe in encouraging people i
[1:03:42] believe in looking in the word
[1:03:43] there's things sometimes that unless god
[1:03:46] speaks and drops something you know
[1:03:48] we've got promises in his word where we
[1:03:51] can look at it and say
[1:03:52] according to the word of god this is a
[1:03:54] promise
[1:03:55] that we can stand upon come on now
[1:04:00] and we can stand upon that promise but
[1:04:02] you see it's one thing then
[1:04:04] when god will come down and he will
[1:04:07] declare
[1:04:08] what the past is you see because the
[1:04:10] future brother brown would
[1:04:12] approach to approach it in this manner
[1:04:13] he would say if i told you
[1:04:16] sister come here i'll pray for you
[1:04:18] you're going to be well
[1:04:19] he said you would have a right to doubt
[1:04:21] that
[1:04:22] but he says if he comes and he tells
[1:04:26] you something that's in the past he said
[1:04:28] then he
[1:04:29] who knows the past surely he knows what
[1:04:33] your future will be
[1:04:34] there is no one that can be but he that
[1:04:37] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:04:39] candlestick
[1:04:40] he which was which is and which shall
[1:04:43] come he
[1:04:44] that is alpha and omega both root and
[1:04:46] offspring
[1:04:47] of david the living god if he can come
[1:04:50] and reveal what your past is then he can
[1:04:53] reveal what your future
[1:04:54] is let me tell you something god has not
[1:04:57] come to make
[1:04:58] known what your past was that you
[1:05:00] remember
[1:05:01] but god comes to tie you in with where
[1:05:04] you
[1:05:05] always were and to bring you because if
[1:05:08] you can see the past
[1:05:09] brother then you can also see the
[1:05:12] destiny
[1:05:13] your future becomes clear it becomes
[1:05:16] sure
[1:05:19] you see this is why when brother adam
[1:05:22] would pick it up like this
[1:05:23] you see i watch i watch how the things
[1:05:26] are unfolding and working
[1:05:27] and the placing of it when brother adam
[1:05:30] is dealing
[1:05:30] here in the midst uh of the message
[1:05:34] shalom
[1:05:35] because you see when he takes us here
[1:05:39] in the message shalom and he's dealing
[1:05:42] with
[1:05:42] what you have witnessed god do
[1:05:46] in the events that's been taking place
[1:05:50] and he ties this in now think of it in
[1:05:52] the message shalom
[1:05:54] he's tying it in to god
[1:05:57] of many miracles and many things that
[1:05:59] have taken place
[1:06:00] that the people saw take place you and i
[1:06:03] are witnesses
[1:06:04] of these things we we're not
[1:06:06] eyewitnesses but you see
[1:06:07] this is why the bible says blessed are
[1:06:10] you who are not even there but yet you
[1:06:11] believe
[1:06:12] you can't explain to somebody neither
[1:06:14] can you make somebody believe
[1:06:16] by explaining something that's
[1:06:18] sovereignly given by god
[1:06:20] those keys belong to god alone
[1:06:23] that's why jesus said flesh and blood
[1:06:26] had not revealed this unto you you
[1:06:28] realized he was standing there
[1:06:29] in flesh and blood but it was not the
[1:06:32] flesh and blood
[1:06:33] of jesus christ that revealed it it was
[1:06:36] god
[1:06:36] that revealed it hallelujah think of it
[1:06:40] many of them come face to face
[1:06:42] with the lord jesus is that right he was
[1:06:44] there many of them sit there
[1:06:46] under his teaching i'm talking about a
[1:06:48] teaching that the bible says
[1:06:50] never a man speak like this man
[1:06:53] you know what it was if one that he had
[1:06:55] all the vernacular correct
[1:06:57] it wasn't that he had all the peace and
[1:06:59] q's and the eyes and the t's
[1:07:00] and pronounced it all correctly the
[1:07:02] bible said the common people
[1:07:04] heard him gladly you know what it was
[1:07:06] there was a god
[1:07:07] behind the word to back it up
[1:07:10] that's why they said never a man speak
[1:07:13] like this let me tell you
[1:07:14] there was men all the way down through
[1:07:17] the scriptures
[1:07:18] who spoke by the authority and unction
[1:07:21] of the revelation of god
[1:07:22] it was wrapped up and culminated there
[1:07:25] of the old testament
[1:07:26] in the bridegroom the lord jesus christ
[1:07:29] and now
[1:07:30] in this hour that we live in now that
[1:07:33] same lord jesus
[1:07:34] is in his body the bride of jesus christ
[1:07:38] it is that same word that's being spoken
[1:07:41] by the same deity that's spoken in the
[1:07:44] beginning
[1:07:44] it's having an effect
[1:07:48] you see brother ryan takes us in this
[1:07:50] message
[1:07:52] and he's trying to what he's dealing
[1:07:54] with is the future
[1:07:56] the future how can you deal with the
[1:07:58] future if you don't deal with the past
[1:08:01] right somebody says i want to be well
[1:08:05] that that's the that's future right
[1:08:08] whether it's the next second
[1:08:10] whether it's the next minute or the next
[1:08:11] hour but in order to
[1:08:13] move to there you got to also deal with
[1:08:15] the past
[1:08:17] you got to deal with sin got to deal
[1:08:20] with unbelief are you with me
[1:08:22] you see and somebody says well i i you
[1:08:25] know i want the holy ghost
[1:08:26] well you got to deal with the past you
[1:08:29] can't go on to the future without
[1:08:31] dealing with the past
[1:08:32] this is the prescription that was laid
[1:08:34] out in acts 2.
[1:08:36] you people want i want more of god you
[1:08:38] got to deal with the past
[1:08:39] and before you can go forward is that
[1:08:41] right this is called consecration
[1:08:43] confession sincerity now notice brother
[1:08:46] graham will take it he says
[1:08:47] now think of this he's trying to place
[1:08:49] the assurance of the people
[1:08:51] upon the word that god has fulfilled is
[1:08:54] fulfilling
[1:08:54] and is going to fulfill in the season in
[1:08:57] the hour
[1:08:58] he takes them to three events of how
[1:09:00] they're right there
[1:09:01] in the tabernacle after the seven church
[1:09:04] ages
[1:09:04] were drawn out he said that pillar of
[1:09:06] fire it came into the room and he drawed
[1:09:09] out
[1:09:09] those seven ages right there on the wall
[1:09:12] then brother adam takes us into another
[1:09:14] place and he says
[1:09:16] there out there he said on mount sunset
[1:09:19] he said when the seven angels came down
[1:09:21] with that
[1:09:22] inspiration he said god came down to
[1:09:24] with the inspiration
[1:09:26] to loosen those seven seals that was
[1:09:29] there
[1:09:29] and where the blood had been sealed up
[1:09:32] but now god came down with
[1:09:34] inspiration to unfold that book to you
[1:09:37] and i
[1:09:39] then he brings the third one into a
[1:09:41] place
[1:09:42] to see the third one he goes into the
[1:09:44] place of the blackout where the heavens
[1:09:47] are blacked out and he deals with how he
[1:09:50] said
[1:09:51] after you know the event took place and
[1:09:53] it goes into
[1:09:54] the pope going to jerusalem brother
[1:09:57] brown will continue to talk about them
[1:09:58] blackouts he said watch these blackouts
[1:10:00] he said it's a sign
[1:10:01] of the coming of the lord and he deals
[1:10:04] with how
[1:10:05] that then when the pope he said here are
[1:10:07] the phases of the moon
[1:10:08] that took place right there and they
[1:10:10] snapped that picture on that day
[1:10:12] there all the way through and the very
[1:10:14] final picture
[1:10:15] the seventh one it was completely the
[1:10:17] moon was completely blacked out
[1:10:20] now you know that the moon represents
[1:10:22] the church is that right
[1:10:24] the bible tells us in revelations
[1:10:26] chapter 12 when we look at that
[1:10:28] in revelations chapter 12 it speaks of
[1:10:30] how
[1:10:31] that the woman remember the bible says
[1:10:33] here she was she had a crown
[1:10:35] uh you know upon her head uh you know
[1:10:38] and she she had that she was clothed
[1:10:40] with the sun moon under her feet
[1:10:42] upon her head a crown of twelve stars
[1:10:45] you see she had crossed over there under
[1:10:48] her feet
[1:10:48] was the jewish orthodox law she had
[1:10:52] crossed over
[1:10:53] from the law under and come under the
[1:10:56] holy spirit
[1:10:57] the foundation the 12 apostles that
[1:11:00] ministry
[1:11:01] she had come under the holy spirit there
[1:11:03] had been a crossing over
[1:11:04] just as it was in the days of joshua you
[1:11:07] see there's got to be a coming out of
[1:11:09] and are going into and it's identified
[1:11:12] you see
[1:11:12] what is happening the spirit of god
[1:11:14] these are not we recognize in the
[1:11:16] scripture
[1:11:17] that this is why the inspiration in this
[1:11:19] hour it come to let you and i know
[1:11:21] these are not just stories these are not
[1:11:24] just happenings in the scripture
[1:11:26] that are given to try to you know excite
[1:11:28] and stimulate faith but it is prophecy
[1:11:31] that god himself is fulfilling in this
[1:11:34] hour in this time
[1:11:37] to show moon itself represents the
[1:11:40] church
[1:11:41] you know the church the moon the moon is
[1:11:43] given
[1:11:44] to to display the light in the absence
[1:11:46] of the sun
[1:11:47] is that right but remember what happens
[1:11:51] when when something gets between the
[1:11:54] earth
[1:11:54] and the sun what happens
[1:11:58] it becomes worldliness shadow is that
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] it gets a shadow upon the earth when
[1:12:04] something comes
[1:12:05] between we know it as an as an eclipse
[1:12:08] is that right
[1:12:09] something comes between the sun and the
[1:12:11] moon we
[1:12:12] receive these things there that are in
[1:12:14] the heavens david said
[1:12:16] the heavens declare the glory of god
[1:12:20] they display his handiwork so we see
[1:12:24] that in this let me let me back up and
[1:12:26] pick up you know
[1:12:27] this scripture that we look at here in
[1:12:30] this time
[1:12:31] in exodus or isaiah 60 verse 1 the
[1:12:34] scripture says
[1:12:35] arise and shine for thy light is come
[1:12:40] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[1:12:42] thee
[1:12:43] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:12:46] earth
[1:12:47] and gross darkness the people but the
[1:12:50] lord
[1:12:50] shall arise upon thee and his glory
[1:12:54] shall be seen upon thee now we know the
[1:12:56] promise in the scripture says
[1:12:58] in first child walk in the light as he's
[1:13:01] in the light
[1:13:02] then we have fellowship one with another
[1:13:04] and the blood of his son
[1:13:06] cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[1:13:09] and let me just say to you we're not
[1:13:11] just walking in light
[1:13:13] we are light jesus said
[1:13:17] as long as i'm the world i'm in the
[1:13:19] world i'm the light of the world
[1:13:21] is that right then he turns right around
[1:13:23] in the book of matthew believe chapter 5
[1:13:25] and he says ye are the light of the
[1:13:27] world
[1:13:28] right placing it together paul said you
[1:13:31] were sometimes
[1:13:32] darkness but now are you light in the
[1:13:34] world you weren't just in darkness
[1:13:36] you were darkness but now we're not just
[1:13:40] in light we are light in the lord
[1:13:44] not to think there within there's a
[1:13:46] gross darkness
[1:13:47] a gross darkness upon the people there's
[1:13:50] two spirits that's at work
[1:13:53] there's a holy spirit and there's satan
[1:13:57] there's two spirits that's at work even
[1:13:59] in this time
[1:14:00] and in this hour this is why that when
[1:14:03] we we look at it
[1:14:04] that when we see a gross darkness we're
[1:14:06] talking about
[1:14:08] we're talking about demonic oppression
[1:14:11] we're talking about listen friends we're
[1:14:14] in an hour
[1:14:15] there's an influence that's on you're
[1:14:18] either going to be influenced by god
[1:14:20] or you're influenced by satan are you
[1:14:23] with me
[1:14:24] i want to be under the full measure of
[1:14:26] god's influence
[1:14:28] i want an influence that's not just when
[1:14:30] i come to church
[1:14:31] thank god for that i want an influence
[1:14:33] that goes better
[1:14:34] than my buddy i want an influence that
[1:14:37] goes deeper
[1:14:38] than a husband or wife or a mama or a
[1:14:40] daddy
[1:14:41] i want the god who is the soul
[1:14:43] influencer
[1:14:45] to come on the inside and influence
[1:14:48] every part
[1:14:49] of my life that's the kind of influence
[1:14:52] that we want to be under because then it
[1:14:55] don't matter where you're at who you're
[1:14:56] around or whatever more
[1:14:58] you're the same it presses you know
[1:15:02] brother brown was saying like this he
[1:15:04] said the people themselves
[1:15:06] you know he says you feel sorry for him
[1:15:08] it's just he said as jesus said on the
[1:15:09] cross
[1:15:10] father forgive them they know not what
[1:15:13] they
[1:15:14] do you see it in this hour
[1:15:17] you see it even in politics you see it
[1:15:19] in many of this measure but the rabble
[1:15:20] bring
[1:15:21] all these things around you think it you
[1:15:22] look at things and you you
[1:15:24] you just look at it around and you
[1:15:26] realize pete there ain't no way somebody
[1:15:28] could say this
[1:15:29] or somebody could think this or how can
[1:15:31] people just you know lay down on some
[1:15:33] how can this happen
[1:15:34] it's spirits that are pressing in let me
[1:15:38] just tell you something
[1:15:39] god ain't losing the battle whatsoever
[1:15:41] god
[1:15:42] whatever the enemy's getting is because
[1:15:44] god's allowing him to get it
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:48] this world system
[1:15:51] it's not our home we're just
[1:15:54] passing through this is why we're on the
[1:15:57] eve
[1:15:59] all of them down through the ages have
[1:16:01] waited
[1:16:02] as though they were living in the eve of
[1:16:04] his coming
[1:16:07] is that right this is why we find this
[1:16:11] this this great of darkness that's
[1:16:13] setting in
[1:16:14] you find that of even how the time and i
[1:16:17] don't want to lay so much
[1:16:19] into the types but i want to pull it out
[1:16:21] uh you know
[1:16:23] seeing how brother brown lay it in the
[1:16:24] scripture he would tie in how that
[1:16:27] when abraham was coming after there in
[1:16:30] genesis 14
[1:16:31] the battle with the kings was where lot
[1:16:34] had been taken captive lot had no
[1:16:37] defense in sodom
[1:16:38] kings are you with me kings came in
[1:16:42] and overthrew sodom but there was one
[1:16:45] king
[1:16:47] went under the inspiration of god
[1:16:50] abraham
[1:16:51] abraham was a ruler placed by god
[1:16:55] are you with me and he knew that satan
[1:16:58] has come
[1:16:59] and taken something that belongs to me
[1:17:02] brother ram said abraham
[1:17:03] he didn't have to ask he just looked at
[1:17:05] it that way
[1:17:06] god gave me the land and lot's part of
[1:17:08] the land i'm going to get him
[1:17:10] amen oh let us not try to reason
[1:17:14] his satan has come along and there's
[1:17:16] something that belongs to us
[1:17:17] just identify and say god under your
[1:17:20] anointing under the inspiration
[1:17:22] i go after that loved one i go after
[1:17:25] that wife
[1:17:26] i go after that husband i go after that
[1:17:29] lost one
[1:17:29] amen here extends
[1:17:33] all these kings come out wow what a
[1:17:36] victory celebration
[1:17:38] but in the midst of it here comes the
[1:17:41] king
[1:17:42] the king of king and priest
[1:17:45] of salem melchizedek
[1:17:49] brother brown tells us the reason he's
[1:17:50] come out from jerusalem
[1:17:52] he's been put out of that city
[1:17:56] just as christ was put out in
[1:17:58] revelations 3.
[1:17:59] he was put out listen now they hold the
[1:18:02] bible
[1:18:03] hold scriptures but remember he's not
[1:18:06] welcome
[1:18:09] this is why i stood you know sorry over
[1:18:11] a year ago
[1:18:13] and a man was trying to tell me well
[1:18:14] these people you know they believe the
[1:18:16] bible i said brother they don't believe
[1:18:18] the bible
[1:18:19] if you reject the vindicated word you
[1:18:22] reject the very god
[1:18:23] who inspired the prophets and inspired
[1:18:26] the bible
[1:18:26] i said that is false you know better
[1:18:30] than that
[1:18:32] you see how people can get under under a
[1:18:34] thing but you see
[1:18:35] look at this where's melchizedek and he
[1:18:38] brings
[1:18:39] what abraham needs abraham recognizes
[1:18:42] him
[1:18:42] abraham did not pay tithes and offer he
[1:18:45] did not pay ties
[1:18:46] to nobody else he recognized there was
[1:18:49] one king
[1:18:50] that stood out above all the other kings
[1:18:52] it was a spiritual discernment
[1:18:54] in the midst when sodom was trying to
[1:18:56] offer him
[1:18:57] oh here let me give you something let me
[1:18:59] reward you but abraham said
[1:19:01] i did not come for a reward let me bring
[1:19:04] it personal
[1:19:05] i'm not serving god for a reward i know
[1:19:08] there are rewards over there but i'm not
[1:19:10] serving him
[1:19:11] because there's a reward i'm serving him
[1:19:14] because i love him
[1:19:15] he has changed my life
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] so i don't on about bill buy him out
[1:19:24] too late too late but already been a
[1:19:28] call
[1:19:28] on his life and for the first time he's
[1:19:31] seen
[1:19:32] that one who spoke to him standing
[1:19:35] visible
[1:19:37] are you with me here he makes himself
[1:19:40] known see how this is a parallel within
[1:19:43] the scriptures
[1:19:44] letting us know the time that we're
[1:19:45] living in this is a fulfillment
[1:19:48] this is a season it's a time because
[1:19:50] remember
[1:19:51] never never never in the scripture did
[1:19:54] it a lot
[1:19:55] that the earthly jerusalem was our
[1:19:56] mother
[1:19:59] galatians 3
[1:20:02] that new jerusalem that heavenly
[1:20:04] jerusalem
[1:20:06] that is mother of us all
[1:20:10] that same one that john in revelations
[1:20:13] 21
[1:20:15] that it speaks i saw that new jerusalem
[1:20:19] i saw that city coming down from god out
[1:20:22] of heaven
[1:20:23] as a bride adorned and prepared
[1:20:27] for her husband she's been part of the
[1:20:30] eve that leads into the day
[1:20:34] she's been part of the preparation as
[1:20:37] jesus said
[1:20:38] upon this rock i will build my church
[1:20:40] each one of the bride members
[1:20:42] that are part of that body they have
[1:20:44] found their position
[1:20:46] in christ down through the ages it's a
[1:20:48] complete
[1:20:49] body in this hour he's not rapturing a
[1:20:52] partial body
[1:20:53] but it's a rapturing of the entire bride
[1:20:56] body
[1:20:57] that has been down through the ages as
[1:20:59] he makes himself known
[1:21:01] in the power of his resurrection and the
[1:21:04] fullness
[1:21:04] of this person right here among us
[1:21:08] the same living god these are not
[1:21:10] fantasies
[1:21:11] these are not stories these are
[1:21:12] realities
[1:21:15] these are realities that you're not
[1:21:17] resting on somebody else's
[1:21:19] revelation it's your revelation
[1:21:24] you know what you were and you know what
[1:21:26] you are
[1:21:28] who did that the same god this
[1:21:31] melchizedek
[1:21:32] this same one who is right here in our
[1:21:34] midst making himself
[1:21:36] known the bible says paul would spend
[1:21:39] countless time
[1:21:40] in the book of hebrews and he would
[1:21:42] declare that
[1:21:43] this one who had neither father nor
[1:21:46] mother
[1:21:46] nor beginning of days nor ending of life
[1:21:49] and brother bran will pick it up whoever
[1:21:51] this
[1:21:52] man is he's still alive tonight he's the
[1:21:56] same
[1:21:56] yesterday today and forever just as
[1:22:00] john could stand there under the
[1:22:02] revelation of his ministry
[1:22:04] and say he's right here in the crowd
[1:22:06] he's right here
[1:22:07] he's right here then another day would
[1:22:09] come john would be back there baptizing
[1:22:11] he's right here
[1:22:12] he's right here one day brother the he
[1:22:15] is right here
[1:22:16] came present john stood faithful
[1:22:20] to that revelation
[1:22:24] the same word that you hold dear i am i
[1:22:27] am redeemed
[1:22:28] god has changed my life he transformed
[1:22:31] my life
[1:22:32] that same revelation you hold in your
[1:22:34] heart and you're declaring
[1:22:36] i'm part of that rapture i'm part of
[1:22:38] that bride
[1:22:39] i'm numbered with jesus christ i'm
[1:22:41] united with him
[1:22:43] that same confession and profession in
[1:22:46] your life brother
[1:22:47] one of these days that change is gonna
[1:22:50] strike
[1:22:50] in your life what you have been
[1:22:52] declaring by the power
[1:22:54] of the holy ghost in your life will one
[1:22:57] day become a reality
[1:23:02] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:23:06] hallelujah we're not just walking in
[1:23:08] light
[1:23:10] we are light and why when the pope
[1:23:14] brother brown picks it up the pope went
[1:23:16] over to jerusalem
[1:23:18] and that's where he ties it in we're not
[1:23:21] of that earthly jerusalem
[1:23:24] i've heard with different brothers
[1:23:26] that's went there
[1:23:28] i remember a couple years ago brother
[1:23:29] wayne and i were together in a meeting
[1:23:31] and we were sitting there and brother
[1:23:32] lane was talking about he said but
[1:23:33] samuel he said it's really quite
[1:23:35] awe-inspiring when you stand there
[1:23:37] you know to to think about i'm right in
[1:23:39] the area where my
[1:23:40] future home is going to be but to
[1:23:43] realize
[1:23:44] it will not be that
[1:23:48] you with me it will not be that but it
[1:23:51] will be that which comes from above
[1:23:54] even in the millennium it'll be that
[1:23:56] which god builds
[1:23:58] is that right so you see this is why
[1:24:01] even in the time we're living in
[1:24:03] the two messengers that went to sodor
[1:24:05] remember there was one that stayed back
[1:24:06] with abraham
[1:24:08] one that stayed with him but two went
[1:24:10] down to sodom
[1:24:11] is that right went down there
[1:24:14] they went down there and they ministered
[1:24:16] but remember their ministry
[1:24:19] it blurred the eyes to the door blinded
[1:24:22] them
[1:24:23] the people could not see to the to get
[1:24:25] to the door
[1:24:27] that ministry of billy graham and oral
[1:24:28] roberts but let me just say this to you
[1:24:31] so you understand
[1:24:32] brother branham called it in god warning
[1:24:34] before judgment
[1:24:35] he said it's messages of god they've got
[1:24:39] their message
[1:24:40] he said and we've got our message
[1:24:43] and it's all the mercy of god hey listen
[1:24:45] now when lot was brought out
[1:24:47] lot would never be an elect of god
[1:24:51] but i think look at the scripture says
[1:24:53] lot good even in what he had received
[1:24:56] thou hast multiplied thy mercy to me
[1:25:01] he received listen to me now he received
[1:25:04] what god had given to him
[1:25:08] he never could see what abraham seen but
[1:25:10] he never tore it down either
[1:25:13] are you with me now i want you to think
[1:25:16] of this here
[1:25:17] this is why we're living in a time this
[1:25:19] is why brother right now he brings it
[1:25:21] around he says now
[1:25:22] where we're at he said what i believe
[1:25:24] that god is fearing to
[1:25:26] feeling is doing and he takes the
[1:25:28] scripture fear not little flock
[1:25:30] for it's your father's good will to give
[1:25:31] you the kingdom he said god is
[1:25:32] separating the light from the darkness
[1:25:35] think darkness gross darkness is upon
[1:25:37] the people
[1:25:38] churches it's been blacked out when the
[1:25:41] pope went there to jerusalem
[1:25:43] you blacked out it blacked out
[1:25:47] showing for the church it's black it's
[1:25:50] darkness
[1:25:51] what is it worldliness
[1:25:55] darkness has crept in where people
[1:25:59] if they don't want to do that they don't
[1:26:01] want to be that way
[1:26:03] but as brett brown put it he said it's a
[1:26:05] darkness that presses them
[1:26:08] you realize there's people listen
[1:26:10] friends these why this is why
[1:26:12] in these times like this you're not you
[1:26:14] know when you look at things
[1:26:16] this is why the discernment on things
[1:26:17] there are sometimes when you're looking
[1:26:19] at things
[1:26:19] you're not talking to people you're
[1:26:21] talking to demons
[1:26:24] i'm talking about in religious realms
[1:26:27] it ain't putting nobody down it's
[1:26:29] recognizing let me tell you something
[1:26:31] the bible said when that evil spirit is
[1:26:33] cast out it walketh in dry places
[1:26:35] if it returns and it finds the house
[1:26:38] empty
[1:26:38] garnished and swept it returns with
[1:26:41] seven other devils and does
[1:26:42] the lastest day of that man is worse
[1:26:45] than the first
[1:26:46] it doesn't mean that he becomes a worse
[1:26:47] drunkard or a worse this or that that he
[1:26:49] ever
[1:26:50] was he becomes something worse than a
[1:26:52] drunkard he becomes a religious
[1:26:54] inspired man
[1:26:57] and religion is the worst devil there is
[1:27:02] somebody preached with me a religious
[1:27:05] devil it's got everything mastered on
[1:27:08] its own
[1:27:10] come on friends your religious devil now
[1:27:13] think of this
[1:27:14] in this time that we're living in this
[1:27:16] is why
[1:27:18] the scriptures we read in psalm 62
[1:27:22] this is why i was looking at this that
[1:27:24] we can look forward
[1:27:27] with the certainty to the future now
[1:27:30] just stay with me here just a few
[1:27:31] moments
[1:27:33] it's times of darkness that we're in
[1:27:39] we've seen fear
[1:27:42] in this a in this time this year fear
[1:27:45] has come and gripped people
[1:27:48] and if people just stop and think for a
[1:27:50] little bit
[1:27:52] just think but how fear has gripped them
[1:27:55] fear has caused people to compromise or
[1:27:58] question certain parts of the word
[1:28:00] that are not even to be questioned
[1:28:02] you're going to preach with me or no
[1:28:04] one has done that fear
[1:28:08] the bible says trust in god at all times
[1:28:12] there's not one scripture in the bible
[1:28:14] that's wrong with superscript that you
[1:28:15] go to the bottom of the page
[1:28:17] that says well this is optional in times
[1:28:20] of
[1:28:23] you understand what i'm saying i'm not
[1:28:25] saying that to be hard
[1:28:26] but i'm looking at when did god make his
[1:28:28] word optional
[1:28:31] jesus help me here you see we're living
[1:28:35] in a time
[1:28:37] before the rapture which is going to
[1:28:39] take faith like never before
[1:28:42] and the worst culprit an enemy of faith
[1:28:45] is fear
[1:28:46] and worry dread uncertainty
[1:28:52] and that's satan's job listen to me it's
[1:28:54] satan's job to even
[1:28:56] try to come and hit at you to try to get
[1:28:58] you thinking about yourself
[1:28:59] to try to make you uncertain and if he
[1:29:01] can pull you out from out from living in
[1:29:03] the soul realm
[1:29:04] and get you out here in your thoughts
[1:29:06] you'll start tripping like your trip
[1:29:07] downstairs
[1:29:09] are you listening to me this is why
[1:29:11] you're made to live brother brad was
[1:29:12] saying like this in one of the millions
[1:29:14] he said that real baptism of the holy
[1:29:16] ghost on the inside of your life
[1:29:18] he said that's what you're to drink from
[1:29:21] that's what you're to draw from
[1:29:22] it's that experience on the inside and
[1:29:25] that's where you grow
[1:29:26] you grow by drawing from that reality
[1:29:30] that's inside of your life you draw from
[1:29:32] that you set here as a son and daughter
[1:29:34] of god
[1:29:35] and you feast on the word to know that
[1:29:38] this is my promise
[1:29:39] these are my promises i have passed from
[1:29:42] death unto life
[1:29:46] my time belongs to him
[1:29:50] come on friends in the days of noah they
[1:29:53] exalted science above the word
[1:29:55] preach with me now it's always science
[1:29:58] has always come to try to challenge the
[1:30:01] word of god
[1:30:04] is that right they told noah phooey
[1:30:07] you can't there ain't no such thing as a
[1:30:09] rain
[1:30:11] i don't care what you could say you
[1:30:13] couldn't get the revelation out of his
[1:30:15] heart
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:17] what i'm trying to tell you tonight you
[1:30:19] might have lost contact with the
[1:30:20] revelation in your heart
[1:30:21] but there's a time that you can get back
[1:30:23] in contact with that reality
[1:30:29] oh that just don't make sense so when
[1:30:31] did we start going by that
[1:30:35] come on now we walk by faith
[1:30:38] not by sight
[1:30:42] hallelujah you see he holds my future
[1:30:45] amen he holds your future
[1:30:48] is that right this is why brother ryan
[1:30:51] would put it like this you know from
[1:30:52] what we read
[1:30:52] in psalm 62 he said so i just put my
[1:30:55] life in his hands
[1:30:56] it requires patience
[1:30:59] and to pick this up patience
[1:31:04] but sam you're just preaching right
[1:31:05] behind the prophet i feel safe i've
[1:31:06] always done that
[1:31:09] because this is a revelation of jesus
[1:31:11] christ
[1:31:13] you see with patience it requires
[1:31:15] patience to obtain promises
[1:31:18] how many of you have ever had to wait on
[1:31:19] something right i'm not even talking
[1:31:21] about the promise of god
[1:31:22] i've never had to save for something and
[1:31:24] wait on it
[1:31:27] sometimes you have to say man i like a
[1:31:29] new gun or i mean i'd like a new sofa
[1:31:31] you know and you got to save a little
[1:31:32] bit for it maybe it's only ten dollars
[1:31:34] here and
[1:31:35] ten dollars there and you still you
[1:31:36] start looking at and you're like man
[1:31:38] that thing i hope it don't increase in
[1:31:39] price boy i hope they get a sale and
[1:31:41] this and that you know sometimes when
[1:31:42] they get the sale you're
[1:31:43] oh my goodness man this is the best sell
[1:31:45] of the year they've just marked it down
[1:31:47] one penny right i've really got to move
[1:31:50] on it now
[1:31:52] and we get impatient because impatience
[1:31:55] that's not part of our soul that's part
[1:31:58] that's here
[1:31:59] those are things that we deal with
[1:32:01] sometimes we get impatient
[1:32:02] maybe sometimes when you get to looking
[1:32:04] and feeling like i'm not doing a good
[1:32:06] job
[1:32:06] or am i really growing as much as i
[1:32:08] ought to be and you get to looking at
[1:32:11] the wrong thing
[1:32:14] now when we look at these patients you
[1:32:17] see
[1:32:17] patients how does patients come patients
[1:32:20] we know there's trials we know there's
[1:32:21] tests
[1:32:22] but what also brings patients by knowing
[1:32:26] that god is he's the same who was
[1:32:29] he's the same that we'll be and brother
[1:32:31] ram will continue now tying this right
[1:32:34] in
[1:32:34] again in the message see it's a pattern
[1:32:36] he's showing us
[1:32:38] he said now the same god who came and
[1:32:40] gave the seven church ages
[1:32:42] the same god who came out there in
[1:32:45] sabino canyon
[1:32:47] the same god he said that now put those
[1:32:50] signs in the heaven
[1:32:51] he said the same god look he said he's
[1:32:53] vindicated it
[1:32:54] he said there's been three witnesses of
[1:32:57] vindication
[1:32:58] the same god he said that did that is
[1:33:01] the same god
[1:33:02] that's to fulfill the promise of the
[1:33:05] change
[1:33:06] of our bodies
[1:33:09] so where is our faith at well you see
[1:33:12] it's not just in us
[1:33:13] looking at events we are the product
[1:33:17] of this message this message is not an
[1:33:21] idea
[1:33:22] this message is not a man's thoughts
[1:33:27] this very very clearly as brother
[1:33:28] brandon put in mighty god unveiled
[1:33:30] before us he said to think the message
[1:33:31] of the hour
[1:33:32] the express thoughts of jehovah
[1:33:35] it's simple you know gory goes right
[1:33:37] above of people's heads it goes right
[1:33:39] over
[1:33:39] because why you can't explain it it's
[1:33:41] not for the intellect it's not for the
[1:33:43] smart paul even said as i read it here
[1:33:45] on sunday you see many that are not wise
[1:33:47] and noble and mighty that are called
[1:33:49] but what is it many who are weak and
[1:33:51] every out here but see on the inside
[1:33:53] there will be people that maybe you can
[1:33:55] look at and say well my
[1:33:56] man they ain't even smart at all but it
[1:33:59] ain't about how smart you are
[1:34:01] there's people can be a whole lot
[1:34:03] smarter that may be able to quote a
[1:34:04] whole lot more scripture
[1:34:05] but that ain't what counts what counts
[1:34:08] is
[1:34:08] is do you have the life on the inside
[1:34:11] because it don't matter how much you can
[1:34:12] quote
[1:34:13] it matters how much he can live through
[1:34:14] you
[1:34:17] glory be to god amen now notice how how
[1:34:20] this you know would go
[1:34:21] because many times a person could say
[1:34:23] i've tried i've tried
[1:34:25] brother and we picked that up with a
[1:34:26] patient brother grandma tried i tried he
[1:34:28] said we'll keep waiting
[1:34:31] sometimes this is why people have hear
[1:34:33] that god has made them a promise
[1:34:35] and they've walked away they got they
[1:34:38] got impatient with god
[1:34:40] and then the devil comes down it's not
[1:34:42] for you it's not this and not that
[1:34:44] but if god's made a promise
[1:34:47] god is present to back that promise up
[1:34:51] what do i do wait that's scripture they
[1:34:53] that wait upon the lord
[1:34:55] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:34:58] mount up with
[1:35:06] look at the future you see the only way
[1:35:09] you can look into the future is to know
[1:35:13] your past is clear amen
[1:35:18] and the past being clear isn't just well
[1:35:21] i ain't done that in a while
[1:35:22] no no the past is where there's been a
[1:35:24] pass inside of here
[1:35:26] you're passed from death onto life it's
[1:35:29] something that just
[1:35:29] it's settled it's just settled
[1:35:33] it's a satisfaction you see this is why
[1:35:36] this message as i said moments ago this
[1:35:38] isn't doctrine
[1:35:45] so much deeper than that it's the life
[1:35:47] of jesus christ
[1:35:50] it's a token that's to be on display
[1:35:53] it's a living god
[1:35:55] who lives inside of a husband living god
[1:35:58] who lives inside of the wife
[1:36:00] a living god who occupies in a home a
[1:36:02] living god who declares
[1:36:04] to this generation this is who i am
[1:36:07] amen and god's got some tools that are
[1:36:11] yielded
[1:36:11] as instruments to bring that realization
[1:36:15] let me tell you
[1:36:15] the prophet the prophet god sent in this
[1:36:18] hour
[1:36:18] was an example was a witness of how god
[1:36:22] wants to use
[1:36:22] every son and daughter of god because
[1:36:25] when the prophet
[1:36:26] left the scene god in his fullness of
[1:36:29] his word
[1:36:30] did not leave the scene that same mighty
[1:36:33] angel
[1:36:34] that descended in revelations 10 is the
[1:36:37] same mighty angel
[1:36:38] the same god that's right here in his
[1:36:41] bright body
[1:36:43] are you with me he's the same yesterday
[1:36:45] today and forever he's the same pillar
[1:36:47] of fire
[1:36:48] the same god discerning the thoughts and
[1:36:50] intentions of the heart the same god
[1:36:52] baptizing with the holy ghost the same
[1:36:54] god casting out devils the same god
[1:36:57] healing the sick he's the same yesterday
[1:36:59] today and forever amen
[1:37:04] he's got a bride on earth who's
[1:37:06] established on the rock
[1:37:12] we've seen a lot when i say see a lot
[1:37:14] over the years
[1:37:15] there's been a lot of things that some
[1:37:17] of you that's older seen a lot over the
[1:37:18] years
[1:37:19] where you've seen people that rise up
[1:37:21] and they come under an inspiration and
[1:37:22] they're this new person or they're this
[1:37:24] or
[1:37:25] they're that right
[1:37:28] but what was that the lack of patience
[1:37:32] before the bride of jesus christ the
[1:37:34] bride that stood on let me tell you
[1:37:36] something friends
[1:37:37] let me tell you something i've heard
[1:37:39] things where people have said things
[1:37:40] well this brother can't quote much
[1:37:42] scripture or this brother you know not
[1:37:44] much spiritual
[1:37:45] and sometimes the very one that's doing
[1:37:46] that is the one who talks and runs down
[1:37:48] everybody else
[1:37:50] that has nothing to do with it being
[1:37:53] spiritual let me tell you something
[1:37:54] being spiritual isn't even that you've
[1:37:57] been used and god has performed miracles
[1:38:00] through you that's not even being
[1:38:01] spiritual being spiritual
[1:38:04] scripturally scripturally is to be
[1:38:07] spirit-filled brother said it like this
[1:38:10] he said i've seen many people
[1:38:12] who have faith to perform miracles and
[1:38:14] yet they weren't spiritual at all
[1:38:17] because to be spiritual is to be spirit
[1:38:20] filled
[1:38:21] paul said let him that is spiritual
[1:38:24] acknowledge
[1:38:25] the things that i write unto you are the
[1:38:27] commandments of the lord
[1:38:29] you never said let him that's spiritual
[1:38:31] they speak in tongues or they do this
[1:38:33] and do that no no no spiritual is to be
[1:38:36] spirit-filled
[1:38:37] and to have faith in that word not
[1:38:40] knowing how
[1:38:41] how it's going to come to pass but god
[1:38:43] said it and the god who said it will
[1:38:44] bring it to pass
[1:38:46] what are you gonna do ain't gonna try to
[1:38:48] figure it out but he's gonna find me
[1:38:50] waiting
[1:38:52] i'm gonna be looking and i'm gonna make
[1:38:54] him making sure
[1:38:56] as peter said being diligent be found
[1:38:59] that i'd be found blameless
[1:39:00] i'm not trying to wash myself but at the
[1:39:03] same time i have to rub shoulders with
[1:39:04] the world
[1:39:05] so i want to make sure that stench don't
[1:39:07] stay on me sometimes when i'm out there
[1:39:09] and the supermarkets are
[1:39:10] around different ones or sometimes you
[1:39:12] hear certain things
[1:39:13] things that i didn't ask to hear certain
[1:39:15] words that you didn't ask to hear
[1:39:16] certain sites you didn't ask to see but
[1:39:18] thanks thanks be to god
[1:39:20] there is a lutron a washing a laver
[1:39:23] there is a place
[1:39:24] that you can come and you can wash up
[1:39:27] and brother you can wash yourself
[1:39:29] you can wash your mind you can wash
[1:39:32] yourself
[1:39:32] from the contaminants of the world why
[1:39:36] there is a place provided for you
[1:39:40] because as priests you're to enter and
[1:39:42] wash your hands
[1:39:44] and wash your feet your doings
[1:39:48] and your goings and god's provided that
[1:39:52] in his word
[1:39:55] a clear future because this inspiration
[1:39:58] has come
[1:40:00] the same god that has brought this word
[1:40:01] has brought the change in you
[1:40:05] so this is the question i asked
[1:40:09] you see a future wow that's a
[1:40:13] it's a great thing for many people
[1:40:16] it's sad things that's happened in this
[1:40:19] past year
[1:40:22] i just looked out here i just come up
[1:40:24] here today there they identify
[1:40:27] biden as the second catholic president
[1:40:29] in 60 years
[1:40:30] this is not this is not you know this is
[1:40:33] their
[1:40:34] this is their how do you say it their
[1:40:37] their channels or whatever
[1:40:38] that's putting it out there the first
[1:40:40] proclaimed catholic president
[1:40:42] in 60 years
[1:40:45] think of it we never had fraud like this
[1:40:47] since 60 years ago
[1:40:49] i'm not here to get in politics i'm not
[1:40:51] i'm not that's not even my focus
[1:40:53] i want you to understand if you can't
[1:40:55] these are things that's so obvious sure
[1:40:57] there's always been fraud this is so
[1:40:58] obvious
[1:40:59] but you're showing it shows think of the
[1:41:02] people think friends
[1:41:03] this is not our certainty our certainty
[1:41:05] as people's not tied into this
[1:41:06] brother brahma identifies they said see
[1:41:08] there's no certainty in democracy
[1:41:10] now you look at this this is not where i
[1:41:11] said can you think of what the rest of
[1:41:13] the people
[1:41:13] has to look forward to think of what the
[1:41:15] people out there they think why don't we
[1:41:17] devote the next time
[1:41:19] right i know what i even do and what do
[1:41:20] i even care what do i even want why
[1:41:22] don't i do this why don't you do that
[1:41:23] you see it's like
[1:41:24] anything there was a lease a little bit
[1:41:26] of hope
[1:41:28] but that's not so with you because your
[1:41:31] eyes are not set upon those things
[1:41:36] sure i appreciate a good president but
[1:41:38] our eyes aren't set up on those things
[1:41:41] but to see the time that we're living in
[1:41:44] a future
[1:41:46] wow a future
[1:41:50] to see the way people are going
[1:41:53] they don't even think of you realize
[1:41:55] when people don't have a real clear path
[1:41:58] and their eyes are not open they can't
[1:41:59] see what's before them
[1:42:01] when they come under an anointing like
[1:42:03] that listen to me i'm talking about even
[1:42:05] people can sit inside a church
[1:42:07] and they don't even recognize when all
[1:42:08] of a sudden they start pulling back on
[1:42:10] the word
[1:42:11] they start pulling back on the word what
[1:42:13] happens you're turning your tent door
[1:42:15] from the word and you're turning it to
[1:42:17] the world
[1:42:18] and i'm going to tell you when you turn
[1:42:20] your tent door to the world
[1:42:21] it's not you controlling you but sodom
[1:42:24] will eventually
[1:42:26] grawl you into her grasp
[1:42:29] that's all lot did he turn his tent door
[1:42:32] and begin to face sodom and eventually
[1:42:34] before you know it he's the mayor of the
[1:42:36] city
[1:42:38] it has a pool sodom has a pool
[1:42:42] the world has a pool
[1:42:46] but so does god have a pool
[1:42:50] it's a pool that's greater than the
[1:42:52] world brother
[1:42:53] without bull that's moved inside of your
[1:42:56] life
[1:42:56] it's something that's drawing you
[1:43:01] even if you're not fully surrendered
[1:43:03] it's a power
[1:43:04] that's drawing you
[1:43:06] [Applause]
[1:43:09] hallelujah what's he trying to do
[1:43:12] he's trying to let you know i'm the god
[1:43:14] who can deal with your past
[1:43:17] i'm the god who can give you a real
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:22] future he took a woman at the well who
[1:43:25] had a past
[1:43:26] she was so ashamed of she had a pass
[1:43:30] she couldn't go to the well at a certain
[1:43:32] time
[1:43:33] but then he came he dealt with her
[1:43:37] past in such a way brother
[1:43:40] that she left her pots and went back
[1:43:43] into the city
[1:43:46] what happened there was a word that came
[1:43:49] to loosen her the smart
[1:43:53] educated and religious elite
[1:43:56] in that day they looked on him and said
[1:43:59] blc pub
[1:44:00] scoffing at him but when he came to her
[1:44:04] he found a heart oh sure her life was
[1:44:07] dark
[1:44:08] but beneath the darkness was a receptive
[1:44:11] heart
[1:44:11] amen was a heart that could be spoken to
[1:44:17] you know brother adam tells us he said
[1:44:18] where there's a resentful spirit
[1:44:20] the holy ghost won't reveal nothing
[1:44:24] this is why it makes all the difference
[1:44:26] in the world to have a receptive heart
[1:44:29] we don't want to have a resentful
[1:44:30] because anytime you you ever see like
[1:44:32] that you've been left in that no doubt
[1:44:34] i've been left and sometimes
[1:44:35] you're left in places you think lord
[1:44:37] where are you at where's the words where
[1:44:39] where
[1:44:39] are the words not coming you know what
[1:44:41] god's doing god's protecting that person
[1:44:43] and that individual because it's setting
[1:44:45] with the resentful spirit
[1:44:47] and they're not receptive but you
[1:44:50] realize when you go to speak to a
[1:44:51] receptive
[1:44:52] there's a connection there's something
[1:44:53] that starts to happen and there's things
[1:44:55] that start flowing and you're like
[1:44:56] man i'm not even putting this together
[1:44:58] this is not things you've been studying
[1:45:00] it's things that yes you might have read
[1:45:02] and you know maybe in your devotion
[1:45:03] things
[1:45:04] as you've heard in the message but you
[1:45:05] realize it's not you putting it together
[1:45:08] how it's coming out that way you almost
[1:45:10] say my goodness i'd like to sit down and
[1:45:11] grab a seat by me saying this right here
[1:45:14] why because it's not you that says it
[1:45:17] that's why jesus said take no thought
[1:45:19] what you shall say
[1:45:21] in that hour it shall be given to you
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:25] this is why we don't fear
[1:45:29] oh my so here this this clarity this
[1:45:32] future
[1:45:33] i said i was closing i know you say yeah
[1:45:36] right you say that all the time
[1:45:39] but once you think of this brother
[1:45:41] branham he comes back from africa he has
[1:45:43] that amoeba
[1:45:45] he comes into that place and they
[1:45:48] brother brahm has amoeba because
[1:45:51] of things that happen over there but i
[1:45:52] want to focus on the amoeba
[1:45:54] and i want to focus on what the lord
[1:45:56] told him
[1:45:58] but brem's been suffering for months
[1:46:01] it was about six months suffered
[1:46:04] he suffered with that amoeba parasite
[1:46:08] in his system up all hours of the night
[1:46:11] and other things you can
[1:46:12] you you know sometimes how it is when
[1:46:13] you're sick and everything else but it
[1:46:15] says oh god
[1:46:17] you begin to just think about what
[1:46:19] brother bondsworth had told him
[1:46:21] oh god he already says are you going to
[1:46:24] heal me of this
[1:46:26] lord is this going to keep on going in
[1:46:28] my body or
[1:46:30] how long is this going to be how long is
[1:46:32] it going to keep on going like this
[1:46:35] he said about that time
[1:46:40] you said he came walking in the room
[1:46:43] he hadn't spoke to him in months but he
[1:46:46] came walking in the room
[1:46:48] and he took typewriter paper
[1:46:52] and he typed on it brother branham he
[1:46:55] said
[1:46:56] he speaks to him he says you've been
[1:46:58] wondering
[1:46:59] what's your future going to be like
[1:47:03] brotherham said he took those papers out
[1:47:06] and he said he just threw them papers
[1:47:08] and he said every one of the papers
[1:47:11] he said they went right on up he said it
[1:47:13] was a pathway
[1:47:15] right on into heaven and he said
[1:47:19] what was spoken out don't worry
[1:47:22] your future is clear
[1:47:27] well there brother bran said at that
[1:47:28] moment he said
[1:47:31] he said i asked him well don't leave i
[1:47:33] how long i want to know
[1:47:35] i want to know lord is this is this it
[1:47:37] is this done

[1:47:45] examination

[1:47:48] you know the banker two witnesses
[1:47:51] they had had dreams and revision things
[1:47:53] like that brother brown walks into that
[1:47:55] clinic where the doctor's at
