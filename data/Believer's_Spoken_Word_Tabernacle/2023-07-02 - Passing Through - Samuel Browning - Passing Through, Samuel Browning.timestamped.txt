[45:29] I just so appreciate the Lord is his presence and I've just um you could tell from in the
[45:44] back having just a wonderful time in the Lord you know it's uh something about it that when
[45:50] you you see your name you know what he's done for you and where he's brought you from
[45:56] there's a praise that rises out of our hearts that even in the midst of times that our Darkness
[46:02] David called it the night seasons there's a praise that is not dependent upon how we
[46:08] feel amen amen but it's a praise that's based on knowing whom I have believed and I'm persuaded
[46:16] he is able not I'm able he is able to keep that which I've committed to him against that
[46:23] day amen don't you love him man so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen
[46:30] and we just want to turn our hearts to the word of the Lord I'd like to read our text
[46:36] this morning and then we are I have some slides that I'd like to show you from the Youth Camp
[46:41] there just a little bit of a background and then going into my subject this morning so
[46:45] if you'd like to stand with me in Hebrews chapter 11. I just want to say it's so good
[46:51] to see each and every one of you and good to be here with you amen and uh just so thankful
[46:56] knowing that God has things has great things in store for us you believe that amen are
[47:01] you glad to be here this morning amen amen I'm certainly am
[47:05] I want to read out of Hebrews chapter 11. and beginning with verse 8.
[47:09] they're not going to you know they do have it up there but okay so Hebrews 11 verse 8.
[47:12] by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive
[47:16] for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went so even in that
[47:22] obedience is just simply yielding to his voice it's not trying to figure it out not knowing
[47:28] god just told him come to a land that I'll show you and so all Abraham had to do was
[47:35] obey the voice now you think about this in this regards this has to be something greater
[47:39] when we speak of these things this is something greater than just a mortal speaking to a mortal
[47:44] the reasoning of a mind pulling upon the reasoning of another mind this is a supernatural work
[47:51] though Abraham's not in the land Abraham doesn't even know who he is he's never met God yet
[47:56] he's heard of God but it shows the supernatural when God begins to deal with the heart that
[48:03] God begins to draw that life beyond all of their reasonings and of Beyond everything
[48:05] that would seemingly make sense because for Abraham it made no sense to leave the land
[48:09] of UR of chaldees that's where the family business was it made no sense as far as within
[48:17] things of this life but there was a pull that Abraham was receiving from God so when we
[48:22] see this by faith Abraham that faith that even Abraham received at that moment to walk
[48:26] from Ur of khaldi and then even before entering into the land is father's still with him lots
[48:32] still with him but it has still been the working of the supernatural upon his life God draws
[48:37] us and he brings us to himself step by step of the way and so it's not just all of a sudden
[48:44] a supernatural moment it is a supernatural moment when we are born again and completely
[48:48] transformed but I want you to see the supernatural has always been around your life God has never
[48:55] lost sight of you that's why the enemy could never take you whether it was by car accident
[49:01] or whether it was by trying to ensnare you and everything else there's nothing he could
[49:06] do that could stop the for knowledge of God from taking place in your life it's God at
[49:13] work it's supernatural so we can say I obeyed but how could I obey how could you obey if
[49:20] now God did not give us Grace by a supernatural unction so that's where it takes for by Grace
[49:28] not of works that we are saved it's not us it's God has given us Grace and his presence
[49:35] has moved upon us to draw us to a place that's to just obey but I don't know what's going
[49:43] on I can't figure this out but there's something greater something I can't explain verse 9
[49:50] by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[49:57] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city
[50:08] which have foundations whose Builder and maker is gone now that City the brand was very clear
[50:17] about that that City he was looking for is the same one that he had met the king and
[50:21] Priests of that City Melchizedek so he knew that City it's got to be right here very very
[50:27] close through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered
[50:32] of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore
[50:37] spring there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude
[50:43] and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received
[50:50] the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embrace them
[50:54] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such
[51:00] things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that
[51:05] country from whence they came out they might have had an opportunity to have returned but
[51:10] now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[51:15] called their God for he hath prepared for them a city by faith when he was tried Abraham
[51:21] offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
[51:25] son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was
[51:33] able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure amen
[51:45] may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated
[51:50] I like to if I just just take a few moments I had some different ones that had asked and
[51:58] I just would like if I could just just a few moments to show you some slides here of the
[52:01] the Youth Camp there in uh in Australia that we went to and just to kind of to point that
[52:09] out it was in you know Australia going go to the next line uh you know when you're looking
[52:14] at it to me all I see is this on the map when I got down there I realized one of the brothers
[52:21] come in they one of one of the families they were in through here some of you that were
[52:37] probably more versed than I am on Australia this in here is just it's just desert and
[52:43] it's it's really nobody dwelling there what happened there is the same thing that's happened
[52:48] in the states the Aborigines have been given places out in here like the Native Americans
[52:54] have been given places and places where I was at in Arizona I walked into those places
[53:00] and I looked at them I said this this is Extreme you know but here one of the brothers that
[53:04] I'll show you in a picture in a minute they traveled from Perth and this is very very
[53:11] warm over here it took them to get down to Melbourne and then up here uh it took them
[53:16] five over five hours just to fly to that one side of Australia wow so you know you and
[53:25] you and I kind of have that relation that if you're going to go from let's say Phoenix
[53:31] uh over to Atlanta or up to Detroit you're going to be traveling about four and a half
[53:36] hours so now you may have already had this down but I was not aware of how wide this
[53:44] thing was and you know I said my this is a big place you know actually and then brother
[53:55] Paul started looking it up of what it would be the distance you know in converting you
[54:05] know they still haven't caught up with learning things in miles they still do things in kilometers
[54:13] I just tease them you know I told him over there I said you know you you all need to
[54:17] start driving on the right side of the road you know you've received the message of the
[54:24] hour you've done the greatest right thing there is but now you need some
[54:31] so they put up with me as long as they could then they put me back on a plane but but it
[54:41] was all good so here we were in Brisbane this is where I flew in and it was Queensland Queensland
[54:48] you know from what they'd say over there that is where like considered the Florida of the
[54:53] country and you know and so I praise God that that's the first place I visited uh but it
[55:00] was it was their winter time over there so being that it was Winter it was uh uh you
[55:05] know in the days it would get up to 70 and 70s and then at night it was down into the
[55:16] high 30s and 40s now to me the whole time I was there you'll see me in jackets the whole
[55:22] time because to me it was cold in the 70s it was cold uh that's uh that's how it was
[55:28] for me so when the the sun came out the one day and it came out pretty strong and uh the
[55:36] one sister told me on the way up to because there's a path I would take to go up to the
[55:42] Tabernacle and at night is when I spoke so you know you could only see so far and the
[55:47] one sister said uh brother Samuel today we had to remove a carpet pilot off of the sidewalk
[55:54] that's it so what did you do brother Simon well what I would do the very next night because
[55:58] it was warm that next day I turned took my flashlight on my phone walked up to the service
[56:02] and so you know I I you know first thing I asked him is there any brown snakes out no
[56:07] they're in hibernation well that carpet python was supposed to be in hibernation too but
[56:12] it wasn't so um but in at any rate this is where we were if you go to the next slide
[56:18] it's just something to run through these are uh this is Brother Daniel and sister Cheryl
[56:24] this was the host pastor and um so brother Daniel is just just a tremendous brother and
[56:29] such a burden and a love for the word of God and just some things that God's really um
[56:34] just really moving there with him I believe this was the eighth year they did the Youth
[56:39] Camp brother Paul and sister Esther they're from Perth on the other side they're the ones
[56:43] they really just work hand in hand with uh brother Daniel and sister Cheryl as well as
[56:51] the congregation there but Brother Paul's just a uh just a tremendous brother same with
[56:56] sister Esther then over here here this is um brother Freddie and sister Doreen uh brother
[57:00] Freddie we shared the meetings together he's originally from Cape Town South Africa but
[57:05] he is there he passes a church in Auckland New Zealand and brother Taz his son-in-law
[57:10] is there and so the lady who was taking the picture must have thought this guy didn't
[57:15] need to be in it so go ahead and go on please
[57:19] go ahead so this is just another picture of all of us there uh pretty much after the pressure's
[57:24] been released the meetings are over and so uh there we are all together and go ahead
[57:29] and so I I didn't I was really reluctant about sharing some of these views with you because
[57:33] if I shared some of the views and the places where I stayed on this Camp I've never been
[57:38] at a camp that looked like this sister Cheryl told me when I came up there she said you're
[57:42] gonna have to remember you're here to work he said because it's it's like a resort and
[57:47] I said that's good I'll make sure I don't share that with my church but it was just
[57:51] a you know it wasn't too much this of a morning is what I get up and get my coffee and go
[57:54] out there and stand for a few moments and and see that and it's it's and it it's uh
[58:00] at a Somerset Dam where this Campground have been put up it's a seven-day Adventist ground
[58:06] and brother Daniel and them remember is just young people going there when um they would
[58:14] have family camps and things like that so that grounds they're still renting the really
[58:19] nice setup the young people there I guess some of them have been to other places they
[58:25] call that I mean like the Cadillac of the youth camps and so uh you know I I guess you
[58:31] know when you're looking at it and go ahead and go to the next one the the mountains and
[58:38] things are all around there kind of reminds me almost of appellation the way those those
[58:44] mountains are these are a lot of the the youth that are together some got a little cut off
[58:53] here but this was the the group of Youth uh that had come in for the meeting and they
[59:02] have their Banner the theme of it was Masterpiece God's workmanship and so you'll see mixed
[59:10] through here uh these are majority are from Australia there are a few in here that have
[59:18] come from a few other countries but there are also a lot of African brothers and sisters
[59:26] that live within Australia Perth and Brisbane Sydney Melbourne a lot of them that are you
[59:30] know from different places Zimbabwe and things like that that they have lived there some
[59:33] of them have um they've been there with their families uh well I don't want to say as long
[59:39] as I've been alive but but pretty close to it so uh they've been there go ahead and go
[59:46] so this is just some pictures brother Daniel shared some of these pictures here with me
[59:53] I had others but he shared some of these go ahead and go so that's just kind of another
[1:00:00] view and just a little bit of a lake right there of the brothers go ahead okay so all
[1:00:08] right so some of them that came in they came in from New Zealand as well I'm flowing over
[1:00:15] there okay go ahead and go it's a little bit more all that confetti on the ground was after
[1:00:21] somebody won a contest so they they had their teams the teams that have the banners here
[1:00:28] they had a contest they had to a few different things they had to do they had songs that
[1:00:34] they had to kind of um uh go through and then they had uh they had to take and construct
[1:00:42] the statue of a perfect man but dealing with it within the the full working in our lives
[1:00:49] so it's it was really unique and you know among some of the young people you you get
[1:01:04] some of them and my goodness like it's hardly stopped laughing the one night I preached
[1:01:11] over there the last night I preached on the thought complete and I just took the scripture
[1:01:20] it's not good for man to be alone and just dealing with that that whole word alone because
[1:01:26] that word alone in the Hebrew it is spelled out b-a-d bad and so I didn't catch it when
[1:01:33] I was preaching him but there was one Young Brother on the front row the brother Daniel
[1:01:38] spoke about it later I guess that brother hung his head and he was you know catching
[1:01:42] it in this spiritually but he was like oh yeah it's bad very bad so we you know those
[1:01:49] are just those are precious moments you know in there you just laugh you know so uh this
[1:01:57] was this was here all of us together and brother Freddie and sister Doreen and myself and then
[1:02:06] brother Daniel sister Cheryl and brother Taz go ahead and go on police uh this young man
[1:02:12] right here brother Elijah uh I'm I I was asked by the Bible Way Christian Academy to present
[1:02:18] this award Zachary and he are classmates and uh so with with um Elijah I wanted that was
[1:02:24] the first night I got there well second night and I wanted to meet him at the opening uh
[1:02:32] moment because Elijah his dad had just passed away from cancer it was in an 18-month battle
[1:02:39] and yet that young man uh with the award that we presented to him I took with me from the
[1:02:48] school there and uh he top within grades stayed focused and threw it all in a such a resilience
[1:02:57] what a wonderful spirit and just a real faith that through it all and you know I I reminded
[1:03:02] when I saw Elijah and I talked with him and just speaking with him and reminded you know
[1:03:07] of what how brother Brown talked about the young lady the stats sister where she said
[1:03:12] I must not have had enough Faith or as my baby would have been raised up when brother
[1:03:18] Bannon pointed out to her he says oh no he says you have great faith because when God
[1:03:23] had decided to take your little baby you have remained faithful so I was thinking of that
[1:03:26] when I looked at with Elijah because you know he and his mom and I just asked you to keep
[1:03:32] them in prayer because there's a lot of transitions that they're in they're moving actually closer
[1:03:38] to the church they're in Brisbane uh you know and so and it's also a lot of transition where
[1:03:44] sister um uh the sister is having to go to work now and all of those processes so an
[1:03:49] 18-month uh battle and some of the last of it is where you know his mind speech all those
[1:03:54] things were lost you can't imagine you know you try sometimes the things when you see
[1:03:58] and you hear whether it's testing trials that take place here in the assembly or things
[1:04:04] like that you reflect in your own and to me at least I look at this and I think what have
[1:04:08] I what am I going through what am I going through what have I got to complain about
[1:04:15] right you know sometimes you look at things like that and you think my goodness I mean
[1:04:18] my my you know and I just I just so appreciate that young man I wanted to share that with
[1:04:25] you and ask that you'd keep him in prayer his name's Elijah go ahead and go for me please
[1:04:30] so this is the setup it's one big Hall this is where they had church we had the services
[1:04:34] the podiums up there they actually had to put in more chairs when it got down into the
[1:04:37] Saturday and Sunday you had people traveling up to it and so but just with the youth and
[1:04:41] then uh some of the older youth that were there uh I think it was about 125 which is
[1:04:46] not a real big camp but it's good because you get to be very intimate with one another
[1:04:50] talk to one another and it's almost kind of like the numbers of our youth retreat the
[1:04:53] brother Paul and brother Berry does so it was very good that was actually the biggest
[1:04:56] camp that brother Daniel and them have had up to that point go ahead please so you'd
[1:05:00] see it's kind of the way the setup is here's where you would have the services and then
[1:05:06] over here you see these tables which that's right over here this picture's a little close-up
[1:05:10] this is where they would eat and that was the cafeteria and things like that and uh
[1:05:16] the one one night I was preaching and I I can't remember at what point I was making
[1:05:21] but you know everything surrounds food and so uh you know I was talking about you know
[1:05:28] don't you know don't don't try to just give me uh oatmeal there's a desire within that
[1:05:34] something greater than oatmeal well little did I know that's what they were going to
[1:05:40] serve every morning so the one brother was in the kitchen from South Africa because I
[1:05:43] got a taste of their bacon they're baking it's out in Australia I I told him I said
[1:05:49] somehow we're getting cheated here in America you guys must be taking the good portion of
[1:05:55] the pigs and shipping the rest to us because that bacon over there oh man if you like bacon
[1:06:07] that bacon over there it I mean it wouldn't even recognize this bacon and so eating that
[1:06:14] with some poached eggs and things oh my we get going there right now uh but anyhow you
[1:06:20] know that's what I was talking about so the brother said how would you like your eggs
[1:06:28] tomorrow so brother I'll be fine in the morning you don't have to worry about me so this was
[1:06:33] their eating the eating area so kind of you know for it may do for two two things go ahead
[1:06:41] and go please okay that's it all right so uh I have a uh yeah you can refer to that
[1:06:49] in just a minute I'll need that slide here in just a little bit okay for the service
[1:06:55] but I want to just um take a thought here this morning and uh as I was just getting
[1:06:59] settled on the the plane there in Brisbane and getting ready to take off to Vancouver
[1:07:02] and coming back home the Lord just all of a sudden they just dropped the inspiration
[1:07:06] I'm just waiting and so the inspiration just began to drop and I just started putting down
[1:07:12] everything uh that the Lord was bringing to me in that moment and I want to speak on a
[1:07:15] thought from the text we read passing through passing through because when we consider within
[1:07:16] this here the scripture had said here that they all died in the faith verse 13 and not
[1:07:18] having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and
[1:07:23] embrace them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth and when
[1:07:28] you consider that you know I I think about that even in myself and you when you've went
[1:07:35] other places vacation or maybe business or something of travel that place that you're
[1:07:41] going to is only a destination for a small amount of time you've got things that you
[1:07:48] are intending to do there there's a purpose for it you just don't go anywhere and say
[1:07:50] well I'm here you you want to go with the purpose and so whether it's vacation business
[1:07:53] or whatever it is but that place that you go to is not your destiny but your destiny
[1:07:59] is is where you come from so as you go there all the places you go along the way every
[1:08:07] mile marker every post every gas station every stop if you're flying every airport all those
[1:08:13] things are just little Junctions on the journey they're not the Final Destination sometimes
[1:08:16] you run into those Junctions and they can you can have great difficulty in certain Junctions
[1:08:24] maybe it's a certain gas station or a certain airport or certain certain things in life
[1:08:31] that we come across and we are expecting nothing but a smooth journey and that's what we desire
[1:08:39] we desire I believe that the Bible would instruct us even in our lives that we would be at peace
[1:08:50] with all men that Christians Believers we are lovers of Peace that's what we desire
[1:08:55] why because we have been born of the Prince of Peace he has done for us and brought us
[1:09:04] settling in our lives that nothing else can do so In This Moment In This time of Journey
[1:09:11] that we are that we are in we recognize that we are coming through uh moments and Junctions
[1:09:16] we're just passing through and that's really what this in this whole entirety of this life
[1:09:21] this life and it's self as it is is not your destiny it's not our destiny it's just a passing
[1:09:28] through we are passing through this moment every test every trial it's not your destiny
[1:09:33] it's a junction that we must pass through there are things even things that we see as
[1:09:40] we pass through this journey there are not all things as we pass through here that are
[1:09:46] Bleak and dark and dismal but there are things that as we see a contrast night and day light
[1:09:55] and darkness you'll find things that are of Duty and then you'll find things upon the
[1:10:04] Earth that are not of beauty whatsoever you'll find all of that we find that as we're passing
[1:10:11] through but there must come a moment and something in our lives to wear them as we've walked
[1:10:18] is whether Americans or Puerto Ricans or whatever your nationality or ethnicity or whatever
[1:10:23] more there must come a junction in our life to where that we meet almighty God and we
[1:10:31] begin through that reality we realize that though I am here in this shell and I'm here
[1:10:39] I'm walking in this body but this body as it is through and by that first birth that
[1:10:48] sexual Earth this is not my destiny it's not my end then here I've I've come I've I've
[1:10:56] been uh uh come into this life I've come down into here God has permitted all of this because
[1:11:05] of the Fall we've come this way we didn't ask to come this way but even though we've
[1:11:14] come this way I want you to remember God's word can never be defeated yeah we might have
[1:11:22] some snags and Hang-Ups at airports we might have some things that happen let me just give
[1:11:29] you an example when I'm getting ready to land in Brisbane I get on my phone comes up a message
[1:11:36] one of your bags has been delayed it will be delivered tomorrow morning so I thought
[1:11:42] okay I wonder what bag that is I wonder if that's the one with my suits in it or it's
[1:11:50] the other one with other things in it I don't know because I can't tell by the numbers you
[1:11:58] know when they give you the the ticket stubs so I land in the airport I find get one of
[1:12:03] my bags and by the way one of my bags uh you know the those four rollers are nice on those
[1:12:09] bags one of the whole compartment is snapped off I wanted to I told the one lady I said
[1:12:14] I don't even use this bag this is usually the bag my wife uses don't try to blame it
[1:12:20] on her foreign but one of my bags so I come to find out when they they escorted me over
[1:12:26] to uh the baggage information center and there was somebody waiting on me they had the information
[1:12:32] they we put a file number through and uh you know they said Mr Browning here we'll you
[1:12:39] can follow this bag and we'll deliver it to you where you're going to be in Brisbane we'll
[1:12:42] deliver that and I said well I appreciate it um you know I'm thankful for that and I
[1:12:47] really didn't want to have to go out and buy you know any sport coats or things like that
[1:12:54] if I had to preach in jeans I can preach in jeans uh you know we can do that in tennis
[1:13:01] shoes and I'm sure the young people wouldn't mind that either but you know you you you
[1:13:07] you when I'm looking for that of what I've packed so I finally you know the next morning
[1:13:13] I I get a get a get a text even from the lady very nice of her to do that sent me the text
[1:13:21] let me know it was on the way and then I could track it it was like a FedEx type thing that
[1:13:28] they delivered it and I got my bag now I will tell you that when I I when that happened
[1:13:36] I had some people pray I called my wife I call my you know different ones and said hey
[1:13:45] would you just pray they lost one of my bags and you know I don't I'm not sure because
[1:14:01] when when they say you know fill this out and this out you may not get it for a week
[1:14:08] I stood in the airport with a gentleman who had um uh come in from uh he was over in France
[1:14:15] and he was over there on vacation and his bag didn't come to him until a week later
[1:14:22] so those types of things happen I mean I you know I don't know of anybody else unless you
[1:14:30] pack up a bunch of clothes that you don't want no more and you're saying please let
[1:14:46] the airline lose it I'd love to go shopping right there's times you might like to go shopping
[1:14:53] but it's not in those kind of situations where you're expecting things to be lined up just
[1:15:00] like this that's ending called an inconvenience because it just so happens at that time you're
[1:15:06] not window shopping you're looking for things at your size and it just so happens your size
[1:15:12] is not on the rack at that time ask me how I know about that so there's hiccups that
[1:15:17] come there's things that come in the journey but we're expecting smoothness but things
[1:15:19] happen but it's to keep in mind that we're just passing through there are things such
[1:15:23] as our luggage getting lost there's sometimes that you know what you can lose your joy there's
[1:15:27] some times where you can lose different things in your life you can lose of your happiness
[1:15:30] and it seems like you can lose that thrill but but listen let me tell you something there
[1:15:37] is one who's greater than any baggage recovery team the same God who gave you that in the
[1:15:41] beginning threw him by the imparting of his life is the same God who knows right where
[1:15:45] it's at and he's able to direct us back there greater than any recovery of any baggage system
[1:15:52] why we're just passing through just passing through so as a stranger and as a pilgrim
[1:15:59] and we journey in these times and you know uh we go there I I wasn't you know uh trying
[1:16:13] to figure out do I want to stay there or not I had one young man that was riding with me
[1:16:24] on the way home and we got out and I don't know how it is these days I try to keep up
[1:16:44] with different things but you know you get people talking about I'm getting Vibes of
[1:16:53] this environment what Vibes of what but I didn't say it I'm thinking that you know I'm
[1:17:00] getting Vibes you know when I was in Australia I think it's really nice and this and that
[1:17:05] and so forth well that's okay that that's wonderful but you know sometimes it's because
[1:17:10] everything in this age and I don't just say this everything is so heightened on feelings
[1:17:14] this feels right or that don't feel right and I don't feel like somebody likes me everything's
[1:17:18] Vibes and feelings friends I'm not just saying that that is an effect upon this generation
[1:17:23] where everything that is done is based on feelings
[1:17:25] my I tell you there's times when you know how it is there's times that I don't feel
[1:17:37] you don't feel and there's times when there's things that don't feel good but you know what
[1:17:45] you don't quit a job because I don't feel good these are I'm not getting Good Vibes
[1:17:54] I'm not getting good feelings I'm not getting
[1:17:58] forgive me I just those are things when he said that I I was chuckling inside I said
[1:18:06] oh no but we're pilgrims we're strangers once you recognize Who You Are and the only way
[1:18:10] you can recognize is who you are is who your father is reveals himself to you and then
[1:18:15] that begins to break the holds of this world because the Earth doesn't belong to to the
[1:18:22] enemy the Earth itself remembered the administration that's on there is the world and here when
[1:18:28] God moves down because remember we are coming heir to this is that right we're coming air
[1:18:34] to this not to the world we're coming heir to this of the Earth
[1:18:39] but once we've met God face to face and that's been revealed then this this world itself
[1:18:44] holds no nothing for you and I sure there's things of of pleasure there's times that we
[1:18:50] spin with family no doubt as as many will even in the upcoming days but that in itself
[1:18:57] is not your source of Joy that's not your source of delight there is nothing you could
[1:19:02] as a Believer ever be able to draw Delight out of this world and be satisfied and betrayed
[1:19:08] frankly the truth that's why then every Mortal that's why people become drunks that's why
[1:19:12] people become addicts and so many things why because there is a place inside a man that
[1:19:17] was made to thirst God put that first in there it's the thirst after God it's a vacant place
[1:19:27] it's called the soul and there's only one thing that can satisfy that and that's the
[1:19:32] comforter and once he you've met him then you recognize I'm not of this world can I
[1:19:36] say it just as brother random said it he said and recognize it he said I'm not the son of
[1:19:42] Charles and Ella Branham he said Boop that little seed came to life I was born again
[1:19:45] what was it you see the real birth when you recognize it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:48] breaking upon your life it frees you from the holds and constraints where you can look
[1:19:52] down your family tree and say it stops right here why because the black line is drawn right
[1:20:01] here it stops right here you have no claim right here you might try to come into this
[1:20:07] body by different diseases there might have been things down through time but I'm under
[1:20:13] another Covenant and I recognize this is not my destiny what Grandpa did Grandma did Mom
[1:20:20] did Dad did that's not my destiny I'm just passing through
[1:20:24] Paul would write it like there Peter would write it like this First Peter chapter one
[1:20:30] verse one he said we're an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout
[1:20:35] Pontius galatious Cappadocia Asia and Bethany elect according to the foreknowledge of God
[1:20:39] the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood
[1:20:43] of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied do you see strangers that are scattered
[1:20:50] look here we are here we are scattered in Lorraine there's no say scattered throughout
[1:20:57] Costa Rica scattered throughout Africa scattered what is it scattered you see God does not
[1:21:03] want everybody to be in a commune are you with me that's why God allowed the adversity
[1:21:08] to strike the church the early church why because man would have stayed in a communal
[1:21:11] way is that right we've seen that even rise up even when the the you know in the prophet
[1:21:15] and the message and different things like that and I've talked to the different ones
[1:21:18] and brothers those that were a part of that impress God and other things and then you
[1:21:24] have that in Zion Illinois why it because there's a desire now let me listen to me now
[1:21:29] there's natural desires God has placed in you and I and the Holy Ghost doesn't strip
[1:21:34] those natural desires out but what we receive the Holy Ghost is that there might be a reigning
[1:21:40] authority over those desires just like it's a natural god-given desire for a woman to
[1:21:44] want to be beautiful but we don't want the enemy handling and interpreting and directing
[1:21:54] that they we want it under the leadership of almighty God it's a natural desire to be
[1:22:01] loved and want to be loved that's a natural desire but we do not want that under Satan's
[1:22:05] rulership we want it under the governance of the Holy Ghost it's a natural desire a
[1:22:10] man and a woman natural desire but we do not wanted under Satan we want it under the influence
[1:22:20] of the Holy Spirit and that's what coming in contact with the god of Glory like Abraham
[1:22:27] did when Abraham met him on the plains of memory Abraham had heard his voice Abraham
[1:22:36] had been gripped in his life he had walked but now the same voice that spoke to him the
[1:22:43] same God that showed him step by step now the same God was standing there veiled and
[1:22:49] revealing himself as the king and high priest of that city of what belonging is in your
[1:22:55] life and he revealed to him that Abraham you are of the most high God why because your
[1:23:03] your origin reveals your destiny you see God listen friends faith is not something that's
[1:23:07] built Loosely of well I felt this no it's God revealing where you come from it's God
[1:23:11] revealing Who You Are we might have acted like pigs but we were sheep all the time we
[1:23:18] might have acted like the restaurant but we were Sons and Daughters of God all the time
[1:23:22] and you need the voice of authority you need Melchizedek to come down your way and say
[1:23:25] hey you're not of this world [Music] amen it's his voice it's his presence it's him
[1:23:30] that's Among Us that's what the message of the hour revealed and released and brought
[1:23:32] Among Us Melchizedek is not a history lesson it's not something on a tape it is the god
[1:23:36] of Glory right here veiled in a body of believers why wouldn't this is not our destiny we're
[1:23:41] just passing through
[1:23:42] even has Abraham was in the land in the land of promise where God told him this is where
[1:23:47] you're to dwell but Abraham still had Parts in his life that had to be worked out and
[1:23:54] he had to pass through he had to pass through a separation to lot he had to pass through
[1:24:03] the Temptation God never forced him to go down to Egypt and tell a lie but they had
[1:24:12] to pass through there right now you say why did Abraham have to pass through there well
[1:24:20] I'll tell you the prophet would pick it up in souls in prison and say I would wonder
[1:24:24] why why this could be and how a man could you know this and why God would include it
[1:24:28] he said but now I understand he said if we didn't have those examples we would not understand
[1:24:31] and know the grace of God you see the grace of God is Not based on if I'm not never Iron
[1:24:37] Crossing every T we believe in living according to the word that's the desire in our heart
[1:24:41] but it I am not standing here and you're not standing here because of our own goodness
[1:24:46] I did not put myself on the ground in Brisbane because I could fly the plane I couldn't fly
[1:24:53] the plane but there was somebody who was qualified
[1:24:56] who had passed all the tests was able to say even as I overcame you shall overcome also
[1:25:03] there had to be something that would encourage me to step on and take my seat in the plane
[1:25:14] something that encouraged me to get on The Old Ship of Science and say I trust him I
[1:25:20] I can't understand everything there might be some turbulence and some bumps in my drink
[1:25:28] might get tossed around but I'm just passing through the turbulence is not my destiny [Applause]
[1:25:34] sometimes sometimes the seat belt sign comes off
[1:25:37] right
[1:25:38] now like me those of you that's made long flights like that I make sure I am I'm strategic
[1:25:45] I want an aisle seat and I want to be close to a bathroom because I know in that bathroom
[1:25:50] there's a big old space back there I go back there and stand I'll Stand stretch my legs
[1:25:57] and and everything even sometimes when the seat belt is on because you know if you're
[1:26:02] by the bathroom they're not going to tell you sit down because they think you got to
[1:26:09] go to the bathroom but you know you're supposed to stand up and you can get blood clots and
[1:26:15] stuff on that longer flight you're gonna tell me what are you saying I'm saying that there
[1:26:20] are times in this journey where we have periods where the seat belt sign can be taken off
[1:26:24] and the pilot can say the seat belt sign is off what means you can move about the cabin
[1:26:32] freely but then there comes some hard times and and they can say hey there's a storm on
[1:26:38] the horizon now there's some things coming the way there's some things heading personally
[1:26:45] things heading the church hey Buckle out there's turbulence ahead
[1:26:50] there's times of up there's times of down there's times a buckle times of unbuckle there's
[1:26:56] times of rest there's times of press but it's all passing through [Music]
[1:27:03] amen that's why Jesus could say in John 6 38 I came down from heaven not to do my own
[1:27:14] will but the will of him to send me I think if there's any declaration that should be
[1:27:19] upon our heart as God I'm not here to do my own will let all of my desires let every decision
[1:27:26] let it be pulled through the word of almighty God Amen Hallelujah notice Jesus would say
[1:27:30] in John 13 3 I like this scripture Jesus knowing this is that when they're white what should
[1:27:35] be Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands now watch what this
[1:27:42] understanding did and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and
[1:27:47] laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself notice what this Revelation
[1:27:52] here is coming in preparation for the cross they're at the last supper now has been you
[1:27:56] know uh the washing of the feet and and you know that that part of it where Jesus is locked
[1:28:02] in and notice when he knows that he has come from God and going back to God he already
[1:28:10] he declared that all along he knew them but knowing that everything you see what was he
[1:28:17] saying he was a recognition that he had Authority not just authority to call Ten Thousand Angels
[1:28:22] but he had an authority that when situations along the way turbulence would arise turbulence
[1:28:28] would Arise My Father if it's possible let this turbulence pass from me let this cup
[1:28:36] pass from me but he knew all things was given into his hands as the Son and Daughter of
[1:28:48] God As I said to you I think on Thursday night I'm not interested in controlling this Earth
[1:28:54] out here I will be doing good and well if I can just have a sufficient Grace to control
[1:29:01] this piece of Earth that I'm in right now that's what the Holy Ghost is for the reflect
[1:29:04] God through this piece of Earth this Earthen vessel that's trial it's frail and fragile
[1:29:12] but God has given Grace and knowing that all things are delivered into our hands what should
[1:29:16] it bring humility reverence to the word of God amen a humility girding ourselves with
[1:29:23] his presence with his word with the truth humbling ourselves to the word no matter we
[1:29:31] manner no matter what it is but God but being able to understand friends being able to understand
[1:29:36] and take that with the will of God that is moved and influenced our lives and changed
[1:29:41] us to understand we have to subvert our own will many times because let me tell you this
[1:29:47] guy is always about the easy way
[1:29:49] ask me ask me if I'd have turned it down if they gave me first class
[1:29:54] let me tell you something that first class on them long flights like that I had one one
[1:29:59] time going to London not because I paid for it they bumped me up into it I was like a
[1:30:04] country boy walking into the city as soon as I walked in there they wanted to take my
[1:30:11] shoes and hang up my coat can we bring you anything to drink and while the rest of the
[1:30:19] cattle are being loaded I'm up here in the front and the seat that I'm sitting on is
[1:30:27] about that wide it's about that thick nice leather you push a button it goes completely
[1:30:31] across down there's the down comforter oh not just them little itty bitty pillows that
[1:30:37] are nothing but kleenexes but I'm talking about pillows that actually knew there was
[1:30:48] a duck or a goose that put feather in them that's what first class and when they give
[1:30:56] you the menu it isn't choose it's uh this is all that's coming to you get ready
[1:31:03] so sometimes when we are looking in this part of it there's there that that part that we
[1:31:11] must go through in and have to move through within those moments and those channels and
[1:31:20] we we then maybe didn't ask for that but you see there's a lot of things that within it
[1:31:26] as I was saying this guy will take the easiest way let me just say this to you and and listen
[1:31:30] to me now this guy still don't like to pray
[1:31:37] this guy does not jump out of bed and say Let me listen to a tape
[1:31:47] good preaching now I'm not preaching to Angels I trust I'm preaching to other pilgrims and
[1:31:56] strangers that's passing through but you see those are moments you've got to pass through
[1:32:00] and don't allow your flesh to now begin to navigate the course you want to look at that
[1:32:10] time and say no I'm not buckling down on this I'm not going to make this a habit in my life
[1:32:16] where all of a sudden now this becomes the new formed habit and new way in my life let's
[1:32:23] just put the devil in the corner and let's just twist his nose good you don't do the
[1:32:29] same you know I I think if I really had something in me you know I I'd really be wanting to
[1:32:37] do that and I'd be doing let me tell you your flesh don't ever want to do it My Flesh don't
[1:32:45] even want to preach some things not that I don't agree with them and not that I don't
[1:32:54] like them but some of the times even afterwards and I'm dealing with the effects of it days
[1:32:58] later but I say it in this way we do it because it's the right thing to do it's God that's
[1:33:05] leading us to do it listen don't walk by your feelings walk by the leadership of the Holy
[1:33:12] Spirit and there's times that the devil says buckle up let's just settle down here but
[1:33:18] you can listen and say that don't sound like the voice of the pilot that don't sound like
[1:33:21] the voice of the crew that sounds like another voice because my God said go forward and the
[1:33:28] pillar of fire is moving this is a time to get unbuckled and a time to move on when you
[1:33:34] buckle up with Jesus it'll never hinder you but when you buckle up with the cares of this
[1:33:37] world it will bring you down
[1:33:38] it's almost like when they're bringing them them trees start coming down the aisle multiple
[1:33:43] it's about like Pablo's dogs time to eat it wouldn't matter what they're throwing out
[1:33:49] dog treats everybody just been everything and everything and you're just looking at
[1:33:53] it and I think sometimes we you know you eat more on those things and then you do any other
[1:33:59] time but you know there's a time you recognize hey here comes the cart what do you do clear
[1:34:10] the stuff off put your laptop away iPad phone whatever it is book you put it away and get
[1:34:22] ready for that tree you've got a space about this size it's not a space where you're going
[1:34:25] to be able to be an elbow eater like you do to everybody else you ain't gonna be able
[1:34:35] to do that especially if you're in cattle class you're like this all right so you've
[1:34:42] got to clear things what are you saying by the same you got to set priority what is priority
[1:34:51] at this moment and that is something every moment in your life you must take account
[1:34:58] of everything what is priority and there's times friends what's important is feeding
[1:35:09] on the word of God you'll never get out of here you'll never live in Victory the way
[1:35:18] you should be and could be and what God desires for you if you keep other things on the tray
[1:35:25] and say no thank you information you know when I was on that long flight 14 15 hours
[1:35:28] you know how much water they passed down the walkway goodness it was constant with water
[1:35:37] of course I'm by the bathrooms Bring It On but I know you know what I knew I knew you
[1:35:50] better you better keep drinking yeah so I I would tell them they bring in the water
[1:35:58] bottles come on Cup come on water I mean they're not just walking around I want to say this
[1:36:05] in a nice way they ain't just walking around just trying to wow we're just going over the
[1:36:10] top no everything's regulated right they ain't gonna give you one more drop of water than
[1:36:13] what it is in the budget all right so it ain't like wow this is just excess they've got these
[1:36:19] things timed out planned out regulations and everything so what is it when they're coming
[1:36:25] down with the cart get things cleared off when it's time to go to the house of God get
[1:36:33] things cleared off when it's time to drink let's let's be ready to drink let's get the
[1:36:44] holder you might have had your phone in that cup holder on the tray get the phone out of
[1:36:49] the way and make way for the cup to come with the water I know this is very simple but that's
[1:36:56] what he put on my heart we're passing through
[1:37:00] Hebrews 12. wherefore seeing we are compassed about we're so brain a clown of witnesses
[1:37:05] let us who us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let
[1:37:13] us run with patience the race that is set before us how looking unto Jesus the author
[1:37:22] and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross
[1:37:29] despising the same went through the turbulences I mean it sat down at the right hand of the
[1:37:36] of the of God of the Throne of God he went through all the turbulences he went through
[1:37:42] the Hall of critics he went through all the unpleasant things why because he was just
[1:37:48] passing through what strengthened him the joy I'm just being that real isn't that right
[1:37:52] you should have seen the prayer beads come out I believe if people would have had to
[1:37:56] cut a hole in the airplane floor to get their prayer beads out of their suitcase they would
[1:38:01] have listened to me now you might say all them bunch of Catholics let me tell you something
[1:38:05] they made sure they had their pair of beads with them don't look down on them I understand
[1:38:15] they may not know no better but have you you have god with you have you put God first in
[1:38:27] everything because when there's situations that come up you're gonna have to call out
[1:38:32] to God there'll be situations that you're going to need his Saving Grace there'll be
[1:38:37] situations that fear will try to come in things will make a loud boom pop and you'll be looking
[1:38:44] for pieces all around but in the midst of that time that's why you got to know that
[1:38:51] you know that you know that you know that Somebody's gotta hold of me and I'm just passing
[1:38:57] through
[1:38:58] unless brother Brian said you know he said the problem we get into he said is Abraham
[1:39:02] tells that story over and over about a guy you know he was a packing up all kinds of
[1:39:09] stuff and they were packing up all this stuff to go worship they got all these Little Dream
[1:39:16] said they brought all this stuff they got put on the camera telling the story they got
[1:39:24] all their card tables and all this stuff they got it on the camels camels couldn't walk
[1:39:32] right maybe it's like after your wife does all her packing and you think where's room
[1:39:37] for me
[1:39:38] honey you can wear those clothes seven days you look good in them
[1:39:41] it's all right to smile you
[1:39:42] see here some things that brother Brown has given a story people sometimes pack up to
[1:39:47] go on a trip I remember as a young boy sometimes you know what you know I was trying to pack
[1:39:57] up on a trip even when we made that trip back and forth from the pancake land of Ohio Celina
[1:40:02] and we traveled up here three and a half four hours and they have the turnpike and everything
[1:40:12] together I look for stuff to entertain me sometimes that ends I would pack stuff up
[1:40:18] now I'm not giving a license to get on phones and things now I could probably I can preach
[1:40:22] a total different sermons on those things I see too much of that where parents passing
[1:40:31] things off to their kids and phones become pacifiers and they don't even know how to
[1:40:35] behave themselves in Social settings come on friends oh my brother Samuel you know you're
[1:40:40] giving me bad vibes that ain't me giving you bad vibes that's the Holy Ghost trying to
[1:40:43] point you to your duty and your responsibility and remember this is not our destiny stop
[1:40:48] buckling up on the things of this world and cut loose [Applause]
[1:40:51] I know sometimes my dad you know who'd have to look around at me of course I was the only
[1:40:55] my brother was already gone at that time and man sometimes I'd have that back seat filled
[1:40:59] you know now when I look at our boys and they got their backpacks man they've got things
[1:41:04] packed in there now I don't pack stuff to keep me entertained I have a special bag that
[1:41:09] has treats in it so when I get somewhere special treats you know what I'm talking about Brother
[1:41:15] Ray you got special treats I got special I got some special well we're going to it I
[1:41:18] got some of them but you see there's certain things we pack along the way and think man
[1:41:24] I'm gonna take some of this and we'll take some of this and take some of this and the
[1:41:31] camel goes I can't even move I can't walk the car is like this foreign
[1:41:41] all these things that you thought were going to be necessary let me just say something
[1:41:46] to you that there's a lot of things that we pack up and and keep and and listen God's
[1:41:51] dealing with our lives it's one thing for me to go if I went and told my boys or told
[1:41:58] somebody else just a general statement and said hey you need to get rid of some stuff
[1:42:06] yeah
[1:42:07] I was gonna I'm not gonna make a comment there but it's like saying you know get rid of some
[1:42:16] stuff a lot of good that's going to do you're going to have to sometimes get down in that
[1:42:25] bag and start looking at things that are there why because there's not enough room so if
[1:42:28] you're not going to go through it then we're going to go through it yeah you see I've given
[1:42:34] you Authority as a son and daughter of God to take the word and evaluate your own life
[1:42:40] but if you won't do that I love you too much to weigh yourself down and weigh down the
[1:42:45] rest of the body you and I I'll send some evangelists will send some Ministry and we'll
[1:42:57] go through the bad together to where the things are pulled up and you realize wait a minute
[1:43:02] I really don't need that after all wait a minute I really don't need that after all
[1:43:08] let me tell you something God is still doing that for you and I because there's some things
[1:43:15] that God is pulling out of our Lives it has nothing to do with pleasure but it's simple
[1:43:21] crutches that we have rested on when times got hard or situation arose and God comes
[1:43:27] in his infant and mercy not to condemn us but to open up our lives and say you don't
[1:43:33] need that you got me you don't need that you got me here you don't need that you got me
[1:43:39] come on and most importantly I got you
[1:43:42] yeah but you see that's what turns that's what turns it back you get to you're trying
[1:43:48] to carry too much of the world brother Ram said it turns you back he said here he said
[1:43:55] you know that guy said I'm packing up to go to heaven brother REM said I'm not packing
[1:44:03] up to go to heaven I'm unpacking the Rapture Cut Loose of everything and he quotes that
[1:44:10] scripture brother said I could see his wife go around and say John what's the matter boy

[1:44:28] going well you don't even have a compass I know some of you are like Compass what was
[1:44:39] that what was that that was the thing that was the Archaic Period prior to smartphones

[1:45:11] no that don't say that
[1:45:12] the Bible don't say cast your cares upon Google because let me tell you google don't care
[1:45:17] for you [Music] whether it's Android Apple or whatever more God never put a device and
[1:45:21] give you a device that should be smarter than you
[1:45:23] come on Friends AI artist artificial intelligence they cannot create it can only take what's
[1:45:28] been presented and mimic it
[1:45:31] are you hearing me that's all that it can do and that's why the reason oh it can do
[1:45:42] this now why because it has been fed that you understand artificial intelligence will
[1:45:47] never be able to replace God I know I'm preaching the choir on this one but I'm just trying
[1:45:52] to tell you that shows your position as the Son and Daughter of God you are an amateur
[1:45:56] creator you can create an atmosphere in your home and your children aren't little AI robots
[1:46:01] but they will mimic what they see out of Mama and Daddy they'll come under that atmosphere
[1:46:08] the creative atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and it'll flow through that home why Cobra

[1:48:13] strong in the what Grace what does grace do Grace gives to you and I well we have need
[1:48:24] of grace instructs us Grace is that even what corrects us and Grace is also the accompaniment
[1:48:32] of God's divine power to bring us into harmony with what he's calling for Grace be strong
[1:48:38] in it well how can I be strong in it by letting your will my will be lost in his will and
[1:48:44] be strong in his grace because let me tell you something he that begun the good work
[1:48:53] Hallelujah he that led you to take this trip take this journey you didn't ask to be on
[1:49:05] this journey you didn't even know you were part of this journey come on Rebecca you didn't
[1:49:14] know you were part of this journey but God knew you were a part of it and the same God
[1:49:22] that has led you each step of the way he'll bring you through every airport he'll bring
[1:49:29] you through every turbulence he'll bring you through every Junction he'll bring you when

[1:49:51] just passing through
[1:49:52] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses
[1:50:00] the same commit that of Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also thou therefore
[1:50:04] now watch this this admonition here I'm coming coming down here thou therefore endure hardness
[1:50:10] as a good soldier of Jesus Christ he didn't say become hard that'd be easy in it sometimes
[1:50:17] we we can't be very easy let me just say this be very easy for us in our Humanity in our
[1:50:23] spirit to become hard sure with the with the cares and things we've been through things
[1:50:30] that maybe things been said on your job or things but sure listen friends I'm just going
[1:50:34] to say a plane as I know how to say it your your spirit and your flesh didn't get the
[1:50:38] Holy Ghost Paul's talking to Timothy he's admonishing him there's going to be some trials
[1:50:41] some hard afflictions that'll come your way but here's what here's what I'm encouraging
[1:50:44] you as a good soldier well what does a soldier do they fight I I never was a soldier as far
[1:50:49] as in that regard Brother Carlos brother brother you know I think brother Gomez different ones
[1:50:56] I know you don't wear your dress blues all the time Brother Carlos didn't wear that white
[1:51:04] hat and that blue uniform with the you know the red stripe and I hope I got it right he
[1:51:11] didn't wear that all the time matter of fact that was for that was when they did their
[1:51:16] shows and parades he didn't wear that when it came time to crawl in the mud and shoot
[1:51:22] but when it came time for that the camouflage was on
[1:51:25] you know what camouflage does blend in with surroundings you know how we fight we blend
[1:51:28] with the word of God we blend with the Holy Ghost we blend with the anointing of his presence
[1:51:35] we blend right in with him and then it's not us but it's Christ in us the hope of glory
[1:51:42] anything there's times for dress blues and there's times to have your Greens on endure
[1:51:47] heart as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth entangleth himself with the
[1:51:52] Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier so Affairs
[1:51:59] of this life will come but remember who chose you to be a soldier on one day I just went
[1:52:08] in and enlisted you know I just I walked up to the Altar and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:14] before the foundation of the world he knew about you you could not have even have a desire
[1:52:21] matter of fact brother Rama says it in one place and lean not your understanding he said
[1:52:25] something he said something was drawn you that is he said even not according to your
[1:52:30] own nature a place this morning I was looking at he said you didn't even have it was not
[1:52:38] of your natural desire but what is it that which was placed down on the inside that you
[1:52:42] couldn't explain you couldn't fit in here and you couldn't fit in there and tried to
[1:52:47] find Comfort here tried to come from the comfort there but you see God never lost sight of
[1:52:53] his Eagles he knows exactly where they're at he knows all of the scattering he knows
[1:52:55] all the situations and God himself has come and he is drawn upon our life and how Paul
[1:53:02] admonishes us don't become involved with the Affairs of this life now you might scratch
[1:53:09] your head and think how do I not become involved with the Affairs of this life I mean we'd
[1:53:15] all like to say glory to God I'm going to apply that when it comes to insurance bill
[1:53:23] not getting involved there buddy car payment not getting involved there buddy medical bill
[1:53:26] not getting involved there
[1:53:27] gas is free today buddy not getting involved there but we understand like Paul could write
[1:53:32] in First Corinthians 7 31 they that use this world you have to use this world you've got
[1:53:37] means in this world things that you have to take care of I don't care just like me and
[1:53:41] you things that we don't like doing there's turbulences I don't like going through there's
[1:53:44] things I don't like God I don't like dealing with there's things I don't you know and same
[1:53:49] with you I don't think anybody likes bills I don't like anybody likes going through all
[1:53:53] those things right anybody get a well I don't know I don't get a delight out of going and
[1:54:03] gassing up the car that's right no sir
[1:54:04] but Samuel what are you saying I'm saying that we have to use this world there's things
[1:54:08] but remember don't let the world use you you use the world you use the things that's given
[1:54:13] but don't let it become your God don't let it become your master you use those things
[1:54:19] that's needful but don't let it take and begin to use Mastery over your life why because
[1:54:32] this is not your destiny you're just passing through don't buckle down on those things
[1:54:38] not using this world as not abusing it because it passed away so don't become involved involved
[1:54:45] with that's what entanglements mean or caught up don't become wrapped up in this life I
[1:54:51] know this is very simple it's very very simple but you know it's the simple things if we
[1:54:58] just do the simple things when I got on that airplane they I don't they could explain everything
[1:55:04] to me about how the J how the engine works buddy all I want to know is it works
[1:55:13] the fuel gain all I want to know is we got plenty to go over the Pacific Ocean [Laughter]
[1:55:26] let me tell you how we made this chicken breast or whatever I don't need to know that
[1:55:33] you see I don't need to get wrapped up in it sometimes you can get wrapped up into things
[1:55:39] that are not sinful but it becomes a trap and you become buckled down in areas and you
[1:55:42] should be able to walk free you were walking free before you did run well what's hindering
[1:55:49] you
[1:55:50] Place God first in every decision I believe it ought to be a council in our homes in every
[1:55:58] decision how is this decision how is it going to impact Us in serving God
[1:56:02] amen oh God always be there remember there's a Rapture at hand and the prince of God's
[1:56:06] going to live from this Earth and if you don't value his presence right now it's a sure sign
[1:56:14] right now you need to move closer you need to move deeper and you need to ask God lord
[1:56:22] cut everything of this world away from my life if there's desires that I've got that
[1:56:29] are not like you and are not pleasing to you God I'm not here to put on a show put on a
[1:56:36] mass but I'm here to call on your Divine Mercy Lord because if there's anywhere I want to
[1:56:42] be I want to be where you are [Applause] that's why I put the lord always before me he's at
[1:56:49] my right hand and I shall not be moved that's why I said if what God said listen if What
[1:56:56] God Says in his word don't matter if it don't matter to you and you don't see the need of
[1:57:05] it I'm just I'm just giving a little bit of diagnosis here and you don't see uh to have
[1:57:21] the desire to pass your decision through the word of God then you first need to pass your
[1:57:30] soul through the word of God you need to pass it through the blood I don't say that to be
[1:57:41] hard
[1:57:42] with you on the other side we've been laboring right here I don't labor and preach and pray
[1:57:49] and every I don't do that that I might be the only one I don't want to be the only one
[1:57:55] I want to be there with The Ransom of almighty God and what's better than to P than to be
[1:58:03] right there us being together we won't be our own little group over here we'll be with
[1:58:07] the ransom that's been all down Through the Ages but God has allowed us to walk together
[1:58:13] shoulder to shoulder pray for one another fact battles back Devils off pray for the
[1:58:19] sick the Holy Ghost come we've been right here we have been ordained to finish this
[1:58:26] mission
[1:58:27] now
[1:58:28] I'm almost done can you give me that slide
[1:58:30] well I really appreciate sister Brianna back there I think she's teaching her daddy a few
[1:58:41] things
[1:58:42] go ahead and go to that where uh that one that says Brisbane
[1:58:56] that right there and it probably a lot of you traveled you've been in airports how many
[1:59:00] of you hear that term duty-free well duty-free means that you can buy something and you're
[1:59:06] not gonna pay taxes
[1:59:08] wherever you buy it this is something right here and this is where that thought it struck
[1:59:16] me because you know there's sometimes how God will deal with God will deal with me like
[1:59:28] that and inspiration and and this is what happened to me when I got off the plane in
[1:59:37] Brisbane oh I didn't have an airport map here but so you just have to bear with me when
[1:59:47] I got off the airplane I had to go and you know you're going to collect your baggage
[1:59:58] first of all I got to pass through all the customs and you know all the stuff put your
[2:00:17] passport in and they scan it and everything's okay you've got your Visa everything's good
[2:00:24] you're going down you get this little ticket you declared all the stuff that's in your
[2:00:30] suitcase and this and that you put all that there and you know there was even some things
[2:00:43] on my declaration list you know they group a lot of things together one of the I think
[2:00:53] uh number one on there was like I mean some of the stuff was like whoa this is some hard
[2:01:05] stuff but you know that because medicine was included in that I asked the gentleman that
[2:01:15] was from Australia beside me had a wonderful older couple sitting beside me I thank God
[2:01:24] for them when we were going over and I said I got medicine in my bag what did he said
[2:01:36] he said just err on the safe side he said go ahead and declare it and he said and then
[2:01:46] you can let him know what it is he said they ain't nothing to it well see I had medicine
[2:01:54] in there because y'all know I had that kidney stone in the first part were kidney stones
[2:02:01] first part of May and on my mind I did not want to be in the air and get one in pains
[2:02:09] my wife had me on some of these other herbs and things like this and things we ain't done
[2:02:14] no rain dancing but we got we do we got herbs and stuff that we do and I got pain I got
[2:02:23] I got the pain I kept them in my backpack brother right they're right there all I had
[2:02:30] to do was of course I said Lord help me but that's why I saw what you know what I had
[2:02:35] to do I had to I didn't want to go through that line I want to go through that I've been
[2:02:39] riding for a day but you know what you better do it they they played the same video on that
[2:02:44] plane over and over and that video it kept letting us know it's better to go ahead and
[2:02:52] declare it and let somebody else say it's all right thank you that's right that's good
[2:02:56] four times around on the video wasn't enough brother Sammy had to turn and ask the older
[2:03:01] gentleman do you think ought to do this [Laughter] thank God for the family of God and for the
[2:03:10] family of God with God's dealing with their life thank God for the family of life that
[2:03:15] there's hearts that we can say brother I'm having a difficult time sister I'm having
[2:03:19] a difficult time and what do they do encourage me go ahead give it to the Lord let God sort
[2:03:30] it out
[2:03:31] so I went through that line you know eventually when I had my bags you know the one bag because
[2:03:42] the other bag weren't there but I went through the line and you know they're bringing me
[2:03:48] through and they were escort me and I let them know everything you know it was just
[2:03:57] like they probably that's enough guy but then they walked me on over and took me to another
[2:04:06] place you know because I had Organics or whatever those the herbs and they took me down through
[2:04:12] there and so anyhow I get in there and uh then I uh I'm able to uh leave in the airport
[2:04:19] but you know before I got to my baggage I've never I'm not I've been to a lot of airports
[2:04:27] International I've been to airports here a lot I mean different different ones and there's
[2:04:34] airports I won't name them but there's some of them I don't care if I ever go back to
[2:04:43] them again why they don't have good food they don't have coffee near it it looks like you're
[2:04:51] just at a processing plant the Samuel food means everything is Comfort buddy it's nice
[2:04:57] to have some coffee when you've got to wait there in three or four hours or have someplace
[2:05:06] instead of just walking up and having a sandwich they made in China five years ago
[2:05:15] here's what I'm saying this was something unique Brother Ray I've never seen this before
[2:05:26] in my life never go to the slant next slide before when I got off the plane and I scanned
[2:05:35] my passport Then I then I gave them the first slip of paper not the card that I wrote stuff
[2:05:42] on and declared but the first slip of paper before Brother Richard I could get to my bags
[2:05:48] I didn't have an option I had to walk through this duty-free shop and that thing was big
[2:05:54] it was every bit the size of this building and probably twice as wide you talking about
[2:05:59] beautiful you went from like the Dark Ages all of a sudden and nice shiny floors and
[2:06:05] you got all these and it's good smelling things perfume and cologne and you're walking by
[2:06:12] maple syrup chocolate I mean it and it's just presented just right and you know how they
[2:06:21] got it angled they got it so that every way you turn it can catch your eye brother Aaron
[2:06:30] I couldn't go around it you couldn't go around even say I don't want to go through that duty-free
[2:06:35] shop you had to you had to I had to walk right down through it all and I could either get
[2:06:43] off here you see their stuff they had all that liquor and everything else they got there
[2:06:49] go to another slide that's what I'm talking about they had all kinds of candy I couldn't
[2:07:04] run over on this side then they had maple syrup and other things and this is what struck
[2:07:18] me
[2:07:19] I was after my bags
[2:07:24] I was just passing through there so even when I went to get back on the plane to go home
[2:07:45] you know what I had to go through before I could ever get to my gate after I cleared
[2:07:58] security to travel back home
[2:08:01] you had to walk back through a duty-free shop you can't say oh I'm just not going to go
[2:08:13] in there I had to if you want to get to your gate and where they release you you had to
[2:08:30] walk through that area this one just like other shops set up around and what I'm saying
[2:08:42] is like this right here there's a lot of things in there there's things on that first slide
[2:08:54] that as far as when it come down then the alcohol and whatever more well I wouldn't
[2:09:06] have been you know there's nothing that I'm going to go for that but on this other slide
[2:09:16] that you looked at the next one there now there are some things right there I can get
[2:09:22] trapped in maple syrup and chocolate and man I mean some you know they had it laid out
[2:09:29] but Samuel what what are you saying well I'll just tell you like this that there's a lot
[2:09:36] of things that when I walk through there and we walk through this life there are there
[2:09:43] are things that you don't get a choice well I'm gonna go around this you've got to walk
[2:09:49] through some places you've got to walk through temptation but just because you're tempted
[2:09:55] temptation is not sin what do you do turn your head and keep going I was tempted to
[2:09:58] buy some maple syrup I was tempted to buy some chocolates sure I was they had some unique
[2:10:04] KitKat bars there [Laughter]
[2:10:06] I don't know they didn't have kangaroo in them but I don't know what they had in them
[2:10:13] but they were unique I didn't see the flavors here in the States you see every why are you
[2:10:20] saying things are out there to try to draw me in and so here I was I was all packed up
[2:10:27] and ready to go but if I'd have went through there and I've started buying stuff I'd have
[2:10:34] been like the other people walking around with a brown bag there were some people by
[2:10:39] the time they got to the gate they had a cart and I'm thinking where is that going to go
[2:10:47] where is that going to go because I know where my feet is going
[2:10:54] and you know where my feet near your chocolate you understand there's only so much room in
[2:11:07] the overhead compartments you got to put it under your seat I didn't know where to go
[2:11:11] what happened they wrote it down with duty-free stuff stuff was catching their eyes and appealing
[2:11:17] to their taste there's a lot of things that can appeal but as Peter could admonish Us
[2:11:23] in First Peter 2 11 dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[2:11:28] fleshly lust which war against the soul in other words you see something that's coming
[2:11:33] down the road don't wait to see if it's a car or a truck get out of the road having
[2:11:41] your conversation honest among the Gentiles whereas they speak against you as evildoers
[2:11:46] they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation
[2:11:53] let me read this in closing can I read that I'm going to read a quote out of the message
[2:12:06] communion I'm closer I'll close on this
[2:12:10] the Bram said almighty God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who raised him up from the
[2:12:22] dead and set him at the right hand of the Majesty ever living to make intercessions
[2:12:32] upon the things that we believed that he did for us and confess it to be so we pray Lord
[2:12:40] God that tonight that you forgive our sins we want to keep under the blood all times
[2:12:43] for we don't know just what might happen all things are about wound up we feel Lord that
[2:12:47] the coming of the Lord is at hand and we're fixing to take a journey and as we think of
[2:12:59] a journey we might think of suitcases and extra clothing extra shoes but how different
[2:13:09] from this journey it's not packing up it's unpacking laying aside
[2:13:11] and then you say Lord
[2:13:13] go through my baggage
[2:13:16] maybe there's some things I've got that's extra maybe you've been through the duty-free
[2:13:21] shop of life you've got caught into traps of things that you say Lord I want to unpack
[2:13:27] that all it's doing it's slowing me down it's a weight it's hindering me maybe you become
[2:13:36] involved with things in this life that you realize emotionally sometimes it's not even
[2:13:43] physically sometimes it's emotionally you have become involved with things that you
[2:13:48] realize oh I'm just going to Pieces because God never built you to handle those things
[2:14:00] it's to cast your cares upon Him and let me just say this to you there are some things
[2:14:44] that you can become involved in that you can't all of a sudden just say I'm not going to
[2:15:01] be involved in any longer but you can when God deals with your heart say Lord lead me
[2:15:23] out of this award and teach me Lord give me the wisdom so the next time I'm passing through
[2:15:44] the duty free shop of life I'll remember I'm not here to count down I don't want things
[2:15:51] of the world added to me I only wanted things added to the Statue of a perfect man that
[2:15:54] God desires in my life that's what I want amen anybody join with me and say Lord grant
[2:15:55] it
[2:15:56] amen let's go to him in prayer Heavenly Father
[2:15:57] Lord simple thought as I set their lord on the tarmac that day and that inspiration dropped
[2:16:19] I didn't know Lord I didn't even know clear up through this morning I've waited on you
[2:16:46] you know that I didn't know if it'd be for today or for another moment or another time
[2:17:05] but God even as the morning went on it continued to press and press and press and press having
[2:17:35] multiple Lord things upon my screen even looking this morning but yet the Press Lord father
[2:17:51] were passing through Lord and you're mindful you have Lord designated there are stops along
[2:17:59] this journey just like those carts that would come down the aisle at designated times give
[2:18:14] us a snack or give us a meal or give us the Lord that of a beverage of choice water pop
[2:18:40] tea coffee whatever things that Lord that would be given in that moment Lord you know
[2:18:56] what we have need of
[2:19:09] father as your children were passing through this world is not my home it's not our home
[2:19:55] we're just passing through as pilgrims and strangers well I know that Lord when people
[2:20:22] will ask us where are you from I'm from Lorraine oh really but God we realize that may be appear
[2:21:09] upon this Earth as far as a physical location that others could be able to identify with
[2:21:50] but God what is the most important is that Lord that we recognize I've come from God
[2:24:36] and I'm going back to God Lord that Revelation working in our hearts and our lives gives
[2:28:23] us strength it gives us strength Lord that even in the moments and times when we might
[2:30:44] get sidetracked in that duty-free shop God how you'll come down in your grace and remind
[2:31:23] us hey there's a trip to complete there's a purpose to be served this life this world
[2:32:24] is not your destiny it's not your home
[2:32:35] oh God hands throughout this building Lord in my hands lifted with them Father I pray
[2:32:56] that God that you would forgive us Lord where that we have become entangled and when we
[2:33:07] have with the Affairs of this life sometimes the Lord it isn't even where we've went certain
[2:33:12] places or done certain things but God our emotions have become so involved in things
[2:33:16] that God I know we can't cut that part out of our life but Lord sometimes it's just even
[2:33:18] within that and God how that Lord that we need your grace to help us Lord to bring healing
[2:33:21] in our lives forgiveness release of bitterness and resentment Lord father well I know we
[2:33:26] may not be picking up chocolates and other things like that but sometimes Lord there's
[2:33:28] things that we've picked up that we need to let go of help us may we take and accept the
[2:33:30] grace of God that's come by here this morning Lord to lay aside every weight and every sin
[2:33:34] that does so easily beset us Lord father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus God for
[2:33:37] every heart you know behind every hand I pray that God that you would Grant overcoming Grace
[2:33:39] for every besetting sin may you grant Lord God of that strength and that confidence that
[2:33:41] Lord as it simply has directed us in your word lay aside every weight Lord God it's
[2:33:45] under your Authority we don't even have to explain it we don't have to try to Lord but
[2:33:48] God in your presence where our bag you know the contents of our bad Lord God as I've been
[2:33:52] there upon the different places some of the places now when you go through security you
[2:33:57] don't even have to take off your shoes you put your bag right on there they don't even
[2:33:58] have to take out my laptop and my iPad and everything else leave it all in there because
[2:34:00] there's certain machines and the way they're able to just scan everything now now Lord
[2:34:01] forgive me but I'm still a little skeptical because it's something that man made and I
[2:34:02] know there's some I know there's a blood I know there's a sacrifice Lord that's been
[2:34:03] offered I know there is the anointing of your person that's right here Among Us that God
[2:34:04] as we will allow Our Lives to pass through the great scan of the Holy Spirit Lord would
[2:34:05] you help us if there's things that we've got in our bag that needs to be taken out and
[2:34:06] I'm sure there is Lord my hands are up with them Lead Me Lord maybe it's things of character
[2:34:07] maybe it's things Lord God that we've become entrapped with sometimes the Lord is the children
[2:34:08] of God we do not become entrapped by things that we would look at and say well I'm going
[2:34:09] to do something bad but things Lord sometimes that are good but sometimes Lord we let our
[2:34:10] compassion and our reasoning get way out of line the duty free shop would like to pull
[2:34:11] us that way God may we not compare ourselves with one another I pray may we not try to
[2:34:12] compare and fit in with this world because Lord this world is going straight to hell
[2:34:13] I am not going that direction I was headed there in one with landlord but your grace
[2:34:14] intervened you spoke to my heart and Lord God the hearts of others that are right here
[2:34:17] and say hey hey hey you're headed the wrong direction
[2:34:18] you've come from me you've always belonged to me it's time to come home oh God help us
[2:34:19] Lord help us I pray as your prophet and that quote said Lord keep us under the blood at
[2:34:20] all times Lord we want to stay in step and in fellowship with you as our heads are about
[2:34:21] I believe there I believe the grace of God right here among us to be strong in his grace
[2:34:22] if you've been trapped in something if you've become entangled why don't you just accept
[2:34:23] the grace of God right now identify what it is yes this is entrap me certain things decisions
[2:34:24] I never would have made like this before maybe it's where you love the Lord but you realize
[2:34:25] that there's things that you've just been allowing to be put before God and you feel
[2:34:26] so empty it's because the rightful position should always be God your family than yourself
[2:34:27] never put your family ahead of God never put loved ones or others ahead of God put God
[2:34:28] first and he is the word and if the order ever gets out of line brother Brown would
[2:34:29] say in an earlier part of the message then he picks that same statement up and how can
[2:34:30] I overcome that is the pathway to overcoming so if there's anything that you have been
[2:34:31] entrapped and snared with let the Holy Spirit not only come down and give you the grace
[2:34:32] to relieve within that but say God let there be a testimony bloom in that area of my life
[2:34:33] Grant it Lord Jesus granted Lord this morning Hallelujah Heavenly Father we commit Lord
[2:34:34] this service to you commit the words Lord that have been spoken into your hands May
[2:34:35] everything that's unlike you Lord may we lord God surrender it to you I pray in the name
[2:34:36] of Jesus Christ amen amen you love him
[2:34:38] all blessed the Lord O my soul amen if you'd like to stand
[2:34:40] you know it's always important to know what you're taking
[2:34:41] on the plane there's things now since 9 11 that you just can't put in a carry-on and
[2:34:42] take on
[2:34:43] it's even so specific
[2:34:44] you walk up with a water bottle in your bag to the security
[2:34:45] they will ask you you want to stand there and drink it or you want us to throw it away
[2:34:49] now water you could drink water but one of the I think it was the second time brother
[2:34:58] Jerry and I went to the Philippines but Jerry had a had a bag that he could take with him
[2:35:08] on the plane a little personal bagging with a carry-on and then um they started passing
[2:35:13] that through well brother Jerry had some bigger bottles of hand sanitizer he had some other
[2:35:18] toiletries that had certain ounces in them that were not travel size
[2:35:22] so when they got to the end of that security they had all this bundled up and they said
[2:35:24] you want us to throw it away or do you want to take it and go back out there and try to
[2:35:25] get it put in your bag now my heart dropped for him because I
[2:35:44] know he went into all the labors to put that in the bag but you see it wouldn't have been
[2:35:47] anything wrong if the certain powders and everything like that jail had been in compliance
[2:35:49] with what was requested so you don't want to add or take away from you want to be right
[2:35:52] in compliance because the machine's not going to just pass you on and say oh that's that's
[2:35:54] brother Shane you can have a big bottle of hand sanitizer no no they don't care who you
[2:35:55] are this right here doesn't fit in you wouldn't believe all the stuff you see in the trash
[2:35:56] what no brother Jerry he had a choice anybody ever been that condition before at the end
[2:35:57] of the okay you got a choice you got a choice to say do I want to go back through that whole
[2:36:05] line again
[2:36:07] do I want to go out there and then try to have him find my bag and try to put this stuff
[2:36:13] in the bag that goes under the plane or you just say ain't worth the trouble it might
[2:36:16] I'll tell you it might it might you might talk about it you might eat your breakfast
[2:36:20] not even know what you've ate because you're still bothered by that got thrown away come
[2:36:21] on now we're human right right but it'd be better to not get involved with it it'd be
[2:36:22] better to let it go and say God give me Grace to get over it and go beyond it because I
[2:36:23] ain't going back I ain't going back I've already come through security check I've been right
[2:36:26] in the line with what's been asked I ain't going back I don't want to go back Wayne where
[2:36:27] you going I want to go to where my ticket says that I'm going
[2:36:28] my token says I'm going home that's where I'm going you know you might have to throw
[2:36:29] this way throw that away it ain't worth taking if Something's Gonna Keep Me here it ain't
[2:36:30] worth it cause I'm just passing through
[2:36:31] God gives us Grace to evaluate do you want to keep it do you want to keep it see you
[2:36:32] just don't reach in and yank things out of it you want to keep it I'll say Lord there
[2:36:33] might be things I want to keep but I know that there is a bomb in Gilead that can Minister
[2:36:34] even to things that maybe that I felt comfortable with certain ways that we have a family doing
[2:36:35] things now don't get quiet on me now we all have them and it's not saying one's right
[2:36:36] one's wrong we're there ain't no family that's the standard the only standard family there
[2:36:37] is is the family of God
[2:36:38] but there's certain things about us that we see as the word begins to examine over our
[2:36:39] lives we might have all of the right ounces of toothpaste all the right answers of all
[2:36:40] the quotes all the right ounces [Music] but see God wants to go even deeper than that
[2:36:41] maybe maybe we've got the right answers in their experience with God but then through
[2:36:42] that God begins to move down in our lives and certain things show up in certain situations
[2:36:43] where did that come from it was there the whole time but that situation allowed the
[2:36:44] scan to come up and you to see it oh Lord that's still there yeah what do you want to
[2:36:49] do with it you want to leave it here Lord where should I take it to you know brother
[2:36:54] Brian they don't ask anybody they didn't ask my brother they don't ask none of them people

[2:37:36] a decision with everything in your life even in the beginnings of your journey and then
[2:37:37] throughout your journey there's always a decision and every time you make a step towards God
