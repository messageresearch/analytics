so good to me every day he's blessing me every day is a day of thanksgiving take the time [Music] [Applause] we're so thankful for the good news amen of this gospel that he is alive amen amen we're not serving a dead god but a living god amen god bless you we just appreciate the opportunity to be here always feel so at home here i don't think there's hardly a church anywhere that feels as much like home as this church except for home amen but i'm glad to be in my home away from home to celebrate easter with you and fellowship around the word of god so god bless you let's turn to mark the 16th chapter and we'll just go directly to the word i want to greet all our dear friends that are here bring greetings from the home church for the ray the family send their love mark chapter 16 and we'll just start there at the ninth verse and i just want to pull a few things out of this uh this scripture part of the easter story and maybe we'll go a little bit different direction with it today but we trust the leadership of the lord the word says here now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not notice that there after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went in and told it to the residue and neither believed they them but afterward he appeared to the 11 as they sat at meat and uprated them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen so jesus appears with a personal presence and it changes the whole perspective uh when he when he proved it to them they couldn't help but believe that he was alive right amen so it changed it changed the narrative there and that's my that's my text this morning changing the narrative changing the narrative but let's just finish up this this wonderful chapter here it says uh that he appeared to the eleven and he said unto them now that he's changed the narrative now that he had now that uh faith has struck their hearts they believe the good news of the gospel now it turns around to be a commission he says go into all the world and preach the gospel the good news to every creature he that believeth in his baptizes shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god amen amen mercy first and appearing then a believing amen and then a change of the narrative and then a commission to speak the good news hallelujah uh before we pray let's let's just quickly grab matthew chapter 15 as well just verses 10 and 11 there in matthew 15 where jesus says this he called unto the multitude and said to them hear and understand it's not that which goeth into the mouth that defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man can you say amen to the reign of the word let's have just a word of prayer heavenly father we just want to thank you lord in this easter time father for the gospel that we're carrying lord a good news a positive gospel lord not only positive in that it's good news lord but positive in that we can be sure of it lord it's a sure word of prophecy it's vindicated unto us you've proved it lord even with your personal presence i pray lord that as we would just fellowship around the word this morning lord that you would just come in our midst lord and and bring our everything our our lives our attitudes our confessions lord in line with the word of god but because lord we know that that's the channel that has life in it oh god i pray that you would just be able to minister to your people father that you would just address lord we don't know the needs of the congregation here lord and even if we did lord we would not presume lord that we could bring anything lord that would be a help but we're trusting completely in the leadership of the holy spirit and asking that you'd have your way oh god as we surrender ourselves we surrender our beings we surrender our minds and our and our testimonies unto you and your word father in the name of the lord jesus christ we dedicate this service to you in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated this morning and we just want to take a little thought on changing the narrative amen it's a timely time for for uh that type of a thought so if you'll uh if you'll bear with me i want to lay uh take a a lengthy time here and just lay out a foundation uh so turn with me to james the third chapter and this is that familiar scripture where james begins to talk about the power of the tongue the power of the tongue and i believe that i believe that as christians especially as believers there's a power there's a there's a strength there's a there's a there's a power in the words that we say the things uh uh our testimony not even the necessarily just the words you say but your whole outlook your you know your your attitude all those things have a power just in the world but especially to a believer there's a power amen so james chapter 3 and we'll start the second we'll come down to the 10th verse james says here for in many things we offend all but if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body he said behold we put bits in the horse's mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whether so ever the governor listed even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire it's a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and it setteth on fire the course of nature and it's set on fire of hell now james is you might think your pastor's ever preached on you but get let pastor james get to go on he's he's pretty rough but he says for every kind of beast and birds and serpents and things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of man but the tongue can no man tame amen it is an unruly evil it's full of deadly poise and therewith blessed we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing he said my brethrens these things ought not to be so james is is admonishing the church about a power that's in the tongue of power in the words that we say and though it would be a little thing yet it has a great power in our life amen and uh and and so uh james is taking it on the negative side there but i want to take it to the positive side and preach on changing our narrative amen to to to uh to come into harmony with the word of god because i believe there's a power in the words that we say but especially when we begin to speak the word and we make our confession match the things of the word amen there's a power in the believer amen that that will bring your whole life into subjection to the word that you're saying amen because it's his word not just our words now now you notice the analogies here in the scripture that james is talking about uh uh and all the analogies of the scripture are perfect they're not haphazard but they they have a perfect meaning he he compares the tongue to a bridle in a horse's mouth a bit amen he he compares it to a little helm that steers a whole ship and so what the tongue is is a seed of control in other words whatever spirit is ruling your tongue is ruling your confession the things that you say that's controlling your whole life but it's all happening here in the seat of control of your tongue amen so the tongue has a power and that power can either be harnessed by god or it can be harnessed by the devil they both both of them operate by that same power it's a seat of control and so your whole christian life is going to be controlled by whatever power rules your tongue because that's where that's where the control is happening you you have all the everything else going in your life there's many factors there's many mechanical things many machinations of of your life and lots of moving parts and moving pieces amen but it's it's this one seat it's this one place it's this one it's this one area where we either succeed or we fail all of all of victories are won by the tongue all of our defeats happen by the tongue a good a a good attitude a good confession a good testimony or a bad one all happens in the tongue amen amen and that's why the bible says that jesus christ and brother branham begins to talk about this i'm using the word narrative but i'm not bringing some crazy thing brother branham uses the word confession or profession amen and he talks about it a whole lot because it's something very important very vital in the life of a believer that that we have the right confession because the bible says that he is the high priest of your profession of your confession not a brother branham's confession or what your pastor's preaching necessarily or the way that you were raised and what your parents taught you but he's the he'll be the high priest of your confession in other words you have to have a confession you have to have a testimony you have to you have to be using your mouth to speak the word of god so that god can come and empower that that's god's that god's law it's god's system we find how brother branham brings it out how that it works uh there's a there's a there's a law that god operates by it's the law of confession uh and and the way that that works is you begin to hear god's voice how shall anyone believe except they hear amen except god sent a preacher how would we we begin to hear the word and it begins to bring faith up in our heart based on what we're listening to faith comes in the heart now now in your heart you begin to believe it you can either believe it or disbelieve it there's a power in you to either accept god's word or or reject god's word right and then but if you believe it you begin to confess it with your mouth it begins to change your testimony it begins to change your confession amen and then god will act upon your confession amen uh he doesn't just come and and program you like a robot or just or just forcefully uh uh bring you through the the different happenings of your life but he's operating upon the confession that's on your mouth based on your belief in the word that you're hearing amen and that's god's system it's it's it's his law he operates that way the bible says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness amen and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation right so the heart believes but then the mouth speaks and the confession is made with the mouth unto salvation so the power of salvation unto you is to believe god's word believe in his uh believe in the purchase price of calvary but then you begin to speak it you begin to confess it i am saved i am covered by the blood amen i am a i am a justified son of god brother bran has said this very powerful thing he said he cannot do one thing for you until first you believe in your heart that he has done it and then say that he's done it he can't do one thing for you notice that unless you believe in your heart that he's done it and then you say that he's done it and the minute you believe it and say it he said he's there to make intercession on your confession now he said now look you can come now speaking of salvation now he says now you could come to the altar here you could scream and cry walk up and down the floor and scream god save me a sinner he said that won't do one speck of good you could do that tonight all night all day tomorrow and the next night beat on the floor anything that you want to do he said you're just giving vent to your feeling but you can never be saved unless you first believe it and then you confess it amen amen now we're not preaching against altar calls or emotion amen or or or or uh you know you service anything like that but but there has to be something that happens in the heart to to accept what god is offering amen in other words you yourself you can't beat it out of a bench now i'm a young man who went to a youth camp and beat his fist on a bench thinking that he could beat the holy ghost out of a bench amen and not knowing any more in my spirit but but out of desperation amen we get desperate with god god i want the holy ghost god i want to change in my life i want keeping power i want a reality in my life but you know you can't beat that out of an altar amen but what it comes when when the holy ghost comes amen where it came from me was by a revelation amen somebody take me aside and say are you here for the holy ghost yes i am well then what you got to do just thank him for it because it's for you amen and then the revelation drops down in the heart and a young heart believes it believes what brother brown said that he wants to give you the holy ghost more than you want it amen but you've got to believe it then you begin to confess it thank you lord for the holy ghost amen and upon the law of confession your life amen has to come up under the authority of the word but he can't do it for you until first you believe it and then you say that he's done it amen that's the system that god has created that's how he operates by the law of confession that's not that's for the holy ghost that's for salvation that's for healing that's for deliverance everything that the the blood paid for is ours but you have to believe it and you have to confess it amen that's the law that's the system that god created now now how many understands god's law of confession now but you how many know that the devil can't create the devil's not a creator the devil cannot he cannot take what god has put into place and and create something new because he's not a creator what but what the devil does is he takes what god has created and then he perverts it amen amen he he he will pervert it it's what he's done to this fallen world god created the world god made the systems god made the laws of physics and things by which the world operates but the devil came in and perverted that but he couldn't bring something new so in other words the devil is bound to god's system he's bound to god's law of confession and he can only twist that system to work for evil now brother braham said the reason if you don't believe in divine healing he said that the reason for that is the devil found a weak spot in you and he perverted it because god is the healer amen but to not believe in your for your healing means the devil perverted something amen that that god had there in the first place now that's why we're fighting the greatest battle ever fought and we're living in such a time brother sister where we're just bombarded day after day and minute after minute every voice in the world is screaming at us there are so many distractions there are so many things to be discouraged by so much negative that we could focus on and what it all it's all a battle that is in the battleground the ground that's being fought over is your mind because that's where decisions are made that's a and so the satan is trying ins he's he's he's set up satan's eden to influence our minds right amen because the mind is the gateway to the spirit now now that's where james in chapter one there james says uh he said a double-minded man he's unstable in all his ways that that the the greek translation that is actually a two-sold man in other words somebody who's got two powers wrestling for his soul he can never be anything but unstable but one of those powers has got to get the control amen and that's that greatest battle ever fought through the mind the gateway to a spirit now satan has the power to bring an oppressive spirit into your life because he's operating by the law that god put in place now that's that's the way that a son of god or a daughter of god can be oppressed by a spirit be afflicted those things is because the reason the devil has the power to bring that on you is because he does it using god's law and god's law is the law of confession now watch eve now eve fell how did he fell he fell when she chose she chose to believe one word amen she didn't believe the full word of god amen but but uh because she chose to believe satan's lie instead of believing god's word and when satan came with a lie the lie had no power on over eve until she until she believed it and then she began to speak it we shall not surely die now i want you to notice there that's that that the devil didn't come with a new philosophy he didn't come with a different word than what eve had already received but what he came was a different narrative a different spin a different interpretation well he didn't mean you'd really die he didn't mean you know when when when when the lord said he's saying when the bible says this or brother brown said that he didn't really mean that he didn't you know it wasn't an absolute it was you know and it was that spirit of beginning to mess with god's narrative that's where satan that's where he fell and that's where every son or daughter of god will fall amen come under affliction make a mistake or get slipped up it always comes back to one thing where you departed from the word of god and you listen to the devil's lie amen and the reason and the reason that it has power over you is because it's operating by god's own system and you make this decision freely isn't that amazing you make it freely amen uh bro uh brother braham said the inside of your spirit is a soul and that will be controlled by one thing your free will your free will now he said you can accept what the devil says or you can accept what god says and that will determine what spirit is in there he said if it's the spirit of god it will feed on the things of god and it won't feed on anything of the world amen now see now now i can only think like uh like an engineer that's that's my trade that's my calling and so i like a system i like to understand a system i like when there's a law that's working like the law of confession i like that because if i if i can understand how a system works then i can understand why it fails i can do a failure mode analysis on that system because and so when when when you begin to look at god's system how it's supposed to work is you're supposed to be hearing the word of god amen and so the problem comes when we get away from hearing the word of god and we begin to listen to other voices and and it'll fail right there well now you believe that you hear the word of god but then there has to be the next part of the system there's got to be a faith in your heart you got to believe that word latch onto that word amen reject your thought about it and accept god's word accept god's narrative and believe that now okay you believe it you believe god's word there's a sincerity you believe the message you believe god sent a prophet but now wonder what's your testimony what's your confession what is your mouth saying what is the what are you speaking from your heart amen that's where we fall and so satan has the power to bring those things in amen because he's operating by god's own law it's not and now now listen so when we fail brother sister it always comes back to this law of confession that's where the devil that's how he works he can't create he has to operate by god's law and so the devil will cause you instead of belief instead of hearing the word of god he's trying to bombard you with his voices and his lies and then he's trying to get you not to believe god's word but to disbelieve and believe what he's telling you believe what the devil's telling you amen and then based on that he wants to change your confession until we have a bunch of negative christians and we have a bunch of people talking about defeat talking about how we'll never get over problems talk about the problems in the church and problems around the message and this and that and and make a negative testimony and when he's got you there brother sister he's got you right where he wants you amen do you know that when you fail brother sister amen you didn't fail for a lack of power and when a little mistake in your life or something goes awry there was no lack of power that caused you to fall amen there is enough power in a son or daughter of god to speak another world and go live on it there is not a lack of power amen why we fall when we fall brother sister it's not for a lack of teaching it's not for lack of understanding we've got an open word we have a gifted ministry we know the word we know where we stand we know what we believe so it's not a lack of teaching that causes us to fail it's not even a lack of faith amen now listen to this now it's not even a lack of faith it's where you decide in your mind to place your faith is where you fail you say well you see the devil will tell you you don't have enough faith amen and then he and what is he doing there he's getting you to believe that you begin to say well i don't have enough faith and then what are you doing you're using the faith that you have but you're putting it in the lie of the devil and he's hijacking your own god-given faith god's own system god's own law of confession the devil gets right in there and causes you to confess that your faith is not enough but you had enough faith to believe what the devil was telling you amen and that's what brought the power of the devil in your life but you have the right to choose glory be to god oh brother brown said it's a strange thing that so much thought of people they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian anybody ever spoken that way that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right there he said you must never say that amen don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it amen and see that's where the battle is amen is when we begin to uh sometimes it seems like we can't help it that's where brother brahm talked about the farmer he couldn't stop a bird from flying over every now and then but he could stop it from building a nest and we have the right we have the power friends you know when the brother bran was preaching these things amen he is he's telling you you can either choose the word of god or you can believe satan's lie you can choose you have the right to do it but see god in respect to your own free will and i don't want to go all into this tonight but i've got the quotes on it god in in in a manner of speaking he limits himself to the law of confession because he's respecting your free will to choose to make that decision to confess god's word amen see and so this this battle is being fought amen and now now now the devil come in and those birds will fly that'll come in you know you you hear the you hear uh we're just bombarded by this world and and these discouraging thoughts come in these dark thoughts come in but we don't have to entertain them brother man said don't entertain it you sound you might not be able to stop it but don't let it don't let it set up shop in your mind in other words don't let it change your narrative don't let it change your perspective your attitude toward the word of god when the devil comes all you have to do is say boo devil amen get thee behind me satan you don't have to argue with the devil you don't have to debate with him you don't have to give him the time of day amen young man when that little thought of lust comes in you don't have to mess with it argue with it prove something to the devil you just reject the devil identify it's the devil and call it a devil and move on speak the word and go forward amen or we mess around too much with the devil we get to reasoning with him arguing with him he's the master of that he created that not created but he he perfected it amen amen oh hallelujah now and we overcome now look at that so there's this great battle being fought over the minds of the leader why because god chose to operate by the confession of faith and so the devil is battling with everything he can he's coming at you full force poured out all the devils of hell amen trying to get into a seed of power and you know what that seed of power is it's your mouth it's your words it's your testimony because there's a power when a believer begins to speak the word of god god honors it the high priest works upon it and so the devil wants control of that amen oh now see now how do we overcome we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the blood of the lamb amen paid the price for deliverance the blood of the lamb paid the price for healing it paid the price for peace for the price for joy the price for every redemptive blessing that we have need of was paid for by the blood of the lamb but the bible says we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony amen oh this word works this blood works but not if you don't speak it not if you don't confess it amen let's bring our whole minds our whole attitude our whole confession subject to the word of god you know that's the only thing you'll that's the only way brother brahm said you will receive something from god watch this now this is this is a a powerful quote amen brother brown said this he said here's what it is friends he said you're a christian because you believe you're a christian and it's all settled because he's a high priest now i thought i thought we were a christian amen because we we caught we got 10 years of church attendance you know and we got a worldwide ministry and uh and you know we we got this uh we we got this seniority with the message and we can talk about all the mysteries and we can do all those things no a man is a christian or a woman is a christian because they believe they're a christian and because their confession amos says that they are a christian and it's in respect to god's word which says you are a christian and it's all settled because he's a high priest now notice he's the high priest of your confession what you confess you are that's what you are that's what you are not what not what your eyes are telling you not what the devil's telling you you are not what the world thinks of you but what you confess you are by the word of god that's what you are brother bran talks about a drunk man he thinks about drinking he talks about drinking his whole life is about drinking and so he's a drunk because his because his confession is that he's a drunk his testimony is that he's a drunk but what about a christian friend who thinks about christ who talks about the word of god who believes the message with all their heart and their whole life is around it it's their their whole ef their whole being is based upon it then you are a believer then you are a son or daughter of god amen not because you might make a mistake or you get or condemnation tries to come on you or people criticize you or call you all kinds of names or fanaticism amen but because you believe that you're a christian then you are a christian because he's the high priest of that confession what does that mean friends it means you will never get any higher in christ than you are right now without a change to your confession that's what i that's what if if that's if nothing else gets across this morning the only way to get to the next step with christ the only way to come up higher the only way to bring more revival in the church more liberty the spirit the only way to the next step is a change in the confession because god operates by our confession that's why i'm talking about amen the narrative the narrative it's all important in your life amen now now what does that mean brother nathan that it's the it's it's it's the narrative now everyone in here every one of us in here every christian every person every human amen that's come to church this morning we will go through hard times we'll go through good times we'll win victories and we'll suffer defeats sometimes we'll be up on the mountain sometimes we'll be in of every single one preachers deacons amen a church member a musician every one of us amen will go through the cycles of a christian life amen and and and every one of us will suffer those things and so what it turns out according to the word of god is that it's not so important what happens in your life but what is most important is the way that you choose to interpret those things amen the way that you choose the the absolute by which you measure what you are going through amen the reality that you accept the narrative you understand what i'm saying amen where what is your truth what is that what is that where are you reading the story of your life because you'll hear many different versions amen uh you we could take the uh you know we could take the uh the institution of marriage for an example now i thank god for a message when it comes to when it comes to being a married man i i love this message because that revelation of an eternal mate and glory brings so much peace to a marriage amen i work with a co-worker and uh he was taught he was kind of confiding me one day and uh uh uh he he he ended up getting married he moved down to columbus and he bought he bought a real nice like 350 000 house beautiful house and and all this kind of thing and him his wife both work and so they could afford this this nice house and he was telling me one day he's like yeah you know i i've been losing sleep over this because you know here we got marrying we got this whole house and i can't afford that mortgage just on my salary you know and and i'm just looking at statistics now a lot of marriages don't last a lot of relationships don't last i thought i'm sure glad i've got something better than that amen to it because but that was the that was the narrative that was the understanding now watch if you're under that brother sister watch what happens in a marriage let it get into somebody's mind that something's wrong in the marriage or maybe they got the wrong one or maybe you're just not compatible and then you know you might have good days you might go on a nice date and have a romantic time and things like that and it but it doesn't really affect the narrative because in your mind it might not be okay it might it might be doomed to fail and then every little argument every little disagreement every little harsh word whether it's men or not it becomes part of a narrative isn't that right and then so and so what does that do it takes control of the whole thing amen because it doesn't matter how many good things happen every little bad thing serves to prove that the ship is sinking well it's the same way in your marriage to jesus christ amen you let it you you let a christian walk along life's journey and then they make a little mistake or they make a little failure they begin to think maybe i'm not saved maybe i never had the holy ghost maybe god doesn't maybe god doesn't choose me maybe i'm not elected maybe maybe i'm not going to make it maybe i've sinned away my day of grace and and that becomes you let that narrative begin to come into your mind amen and and it begins to just take every it takes control of everything because every mistake serves to prove that you were never called in the first place that god's grace is not for you amen because it all goes to prove the narrative but it's the wrong narrative it's not what the word speaks over you friends amen when you begin to when you begin to have the word revealed to you that grace is upon you that you are justified that the blood has covered all your sins amen that's the narrative of the word and when you've got the right narrative you might have a bad day but it's nothing but a bad day just a bad day just a temporary setback a temporary devil but there's an eternal seed on the inside that will hold you you've got to accept the narrative of god's word amen and then you begin to believe that it begins to take you to the next level it begins to take you to heights that you never thought were possible why because you were trying to climb based on your own power but the just are not saved by their works the just are not safe by their efforts the just are not saved by their religious excellent the just are safe by faith hallelujah you're a christian because you believe you're christian but that's why christians get stuck in that cycle of condemnation and it seems like they can never get out once a christian gets under there why because you'll never get out from under condemnation unless you change your confession amen condemnation we were dealing with the young people on condemnation a couple months ago and that is such a cruel devil and that's really the one that that that devil of condemnation is really the one that gets people messed up amen you know you know the things that we deal with you know lust or temper or or or selfishness or jealousy those things that'll trip you up but it's condemnation that gets on top of you and puts its foot on your neck and it makes you sit there and grovel under it until you feel like you've atoned for it amen until you gotta you you can't have joy because you've got to wait a week or two being miserable until you've paid for that mistake friends but you don't have to the word says you don't have to spend one moment under condemnation after a repentance amen repent and forget about it speak the word and go forward amen but that condemnation amen it has such a power it's such a powerful devil because it gets hold of your tongue it gets hold of your tongue doesn't it condemnation's a religious devil you ever get to start just preaching about no there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus there's no there's no condemnation on you no guilt no shame you are clean amen you're holy you're pure according to the word of god and the blood of the lamb you begin to preach that to christian people that know the word and that religious devil starts arguing with you well brother nathan we don't believe we believe in grace not disgrace we believe that you know we believe in the blood and we believe in justification but there's got to be a life that follows it we don't just believe in just living in any way you know we're not just full calvinistic you know of course we believe those things of course there's a balance we know that there's a balance between between works and faith amen that we know that there's a balance there between law and grace but let me tell you something you will never strike the right balance unless you start with grace you will never you will never work your way to the right balance you will never you'll never climb out of the pit that you're in you will never get there with god you will never get the revelation right unless you start with grace because until your narrative is right until your confession is right then god can't stabilize your life he can't bring peace to you amen he can't even he can't even bring those works he can't even bring that our testimony unless you start with grace god here i am a sinner but i plead the blood of jesus christ and i know that i'm forgiven of my sins not only forgiven but justify amen i remember as a young man crying out to the lord in the ignorance of youth and and just not understanding of the lord like i do now and but how oh god you know i'm trying i i'm doing my best lord i want to turn over a new leaf i want to get somewhere i'm tired of dealing with these things that i'm dealing with and one day i threw up my hands i said god maybe i'm just praying about it wrong god instead of me instead of that lord just let me fall in love with you more let me experience more of your grace let me appreciate your mercy over me let me appreciate the blood that was shed for me amen i accept it lord i know that in myself i'm not what i want to be but thanks be to god according to the narrative of the word amen none of these things that i'm going through are written onto my life he's writing the book of my life and my failures aren't written in there brother sister your failures aren't written in there what's written over you is a hall of faith believer amen what moses thought what moses struggled with is not written in the scripture amen the things that were going through noah's mind on that ark as he was tossed on those dark waves all the doubts all the discouragements all those things are not written but what is written is faith of whom the world was not worthy heroes champions that's the narrative of god's word that's the story of your life hallelujah because you believe you're a christian brother bram said if you look back and say oh i'm doing this and i'm doing that then you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and then you realize that you've overcome amen you know but you say well brother nathan but you know i made this mistake i i'm going through this trial i'm struggling with this thing and and it's real i i'm experiencing it it's there you know that you can base different narratives on the same facts just like the you know like you look at political realm today they'll take the same study the same event the same thing that's happened and they they tell 10 different stories with the same fact until we want until it's like everybody's living in a different world a different reality amen and because it's not just the facts it's the way that you spin it and that's the way the devil comes your life the devil doesn't come with the the devil doesn't come with fairy tales he doesn't make something up he comes with the facts about what happened in her life and he comes with the word but what's wrong with the devil is not it's the word's not wrong but the way the devil's trying to use the word in your life is wrong and you've got to reject the devil's narrative and embrace amen the message of the bible the message of jesus christ then brother braham said you realize that you've overcome see the devil doesn't come with fiction he comes with the scripture he comes with a big long list of your sins and your and your shortcomings and all those things you say well brother nathan it's reasonable it stands to reason i was there it makes sense i'm struggling i i've been through this i came from that situation this is my background it makes sense what the devil's telling me it's reasonable of course it is that's why it's called reason you know brother branham preached a message called wisdom versus faith he said what we got to do we got a cast down reason your reason has nothing to do with it what's true what's absolute amen what is truth is the word of god and the word is speaking good things over you brother sister to give you an expected end hallelujah brother braham said we don't reason believe no matter what the circumstances don't pay attention to circumstances believe we need a change in the narrative we got so many people carrying condemnation caring and it's been able to pile up because of the confession of their life oh i don't know if i'll ever get over this brother nathan i don't know this is too strong this too hard for me this tri this happened to me that happened to me i came i've been through this that person said that and all these situations all these circumstances brother nathan amen but but and so it begins to pile up and condemnation doesn't just doesn't just come up all at once it kind of builds up we it kind of you don't really build a narrative just in one conversation you've got to keep enforcing that you've got you've got there has to be keep you got to keep speaking it until till there comes a faith till there comes a belief that's how god works that's how the devil works amen and so we begin to confess and confess and confess and it builds up and builds up amen i was i was explaining to the young people like i like to go backpacking my wife and i enjoy backpacking and camping you know and and sometimes i'll put on a backpack you know and when you get that loaded up with food and water and everything it'll weigh 20 25 pounds you know and i always have the same experience every time that we hike you know i'll get to the hike up to the top of the hill carrying that weight and i said my you know uh oh my you know i'm just wheezing and and uh and gasping because i'm out of shape you know and i've been expanding my borders and the pants i used to wear i wear them no more you know but but you're carrying that up and then you get to the top of that hill and just let it off and i always have the same experience because you let that thing off why you feel like you could just jump 10 feet in the air because that weight that's just come off and i always have the same thought like ah at 20 25 pounds that's how much i need to lose yeah but when it comes on you know evening after evening with some cheese and crackers here and a bowl of cereal before bed there and it begins to build up slow slow so you don't realize that you're carrying it so many christians have been carrying alone there's people been 50 years in the church and carried condemnation every step of the way and no wonder you're exhausted and tired and fatigued and discouraged amen but you know condemnation doesn't come off like this it doesn't come off by by you know a year or two years of of of work and effort and sweat condemnation comes off like a backpack condemnation comes off like a bird and it roll this word can roll it away and all that it takes friends is believe what the word is speaking over you and change your confession and the and there's a high priest which will operate on your confession he's not operating on what your eyes are telling you he's not operating on the circumstances of your life but he's pain he's operating paying respect to your respect for his word when you say there's no therefore now no condemnation on me amen no weight on me i'm laying my burden down brother sister change your confession change your confession oh hallelujah brother braham said before you can be healed you have to confess it first you have to believe that you are healed and then when you believe you're healed god makes your body obey your confession and when you change your confession to match the word circumstances will bend to your faith amen oh he said if you'll take the right mental attitude toward any divine promise god has made it will bring it to pass what is the right mental attitude he explains it here he says if you'll just simply say it's god's word it's not for me to try to figure it out that's god's business he's spoken and that's all that's necessary brother ram said something will take place amen one of my one of my little testimonies in my life of healing one of the few times i've experienced divine healing one time i was work back when i worked for united airlines handling baggage and i was a little little bag came down the belt loader and i kind of yanked on that thing to throw it up in the cart it was a lot heavier than it looked and you know when you just when you move a little bit wrong and you're like oh i messed up you know what i'm talking about and it was one of those things where it's not going to go away in a day or two it was it was i messed up and so you know i hear i've got this pain in my back and i'm still trying to work there and i begin to say well lord you're my healer i believe you're a healer i believe you're a great physician i believe in divine healing i believe those things and so i begin to put that in my mind he's a healer you know i believe for my healing i want to put i want to exercise faith in my healing and the way that i did it you know brother bill is kind of funny how we how we think sometimes i begin to think well you know maybe uh maybe i'll just hold this faith and then like a tingle will go up and down my spine and all the pain will just sit or maybe it'll be like a warm feeling it'll just settle over my shell maybe it'll be this or that and then i and then i thought what am i doing i thought god i don't need to understand i don't need to know how you'll do it i don't need any control over this i just need to believe your word i said god i'm just going to forget about it i believe and i'm going to go about my day about half an hour later i hadn't even i didn't even realize it all of a sudden i noticed hey the pain's gone it's all gone why because that's what god doesn't need your input he doesn't need you to understand it that's the way it is not just for healing for your deliverance for the victory in your life to reach the next step of god you don't have to know how it's going to happen you don't have to get it all figured out just confess god's word it's all that's required of us believe it and confess it and the high priest will operate upon it he will intercede hallelujah oh it's easy friends it's simple simple faith not a great big faith just enough faith to believe god's word the same amount of faith it takes to believe the devil's lie amen if you put that faith in god's word and simply confess it all the power of heaven is behind it amen god's word won't fail now notice now this and this is not psychology brother sister this is the message it's the message it's not some this is not some uh some fanatical thing you know some kind of hippie juju of positive vibes and you know think positively and good things will happen in the universal kind of you know rearrange or anything it's the word of god watch now what bro graham said you know that a lot of christians get under superstition when it comes to faith and you know they're you can even get to a place where you know a christians like they'll go to the doctor and find out what you got high blood pressure and then and then a fear could come on a believer you know because uh we we believe in the power of confession and then you know you go and tell somebody well you know i got high blood pressure and then you get under condemnation you know because uh because uh because you know you said it you understand what i'm saying you said it and so now there is a right application of that kind of faith like the blind man in the barber chair you know you just you don't you don't talk about the circumstances you just say what you just speak the word you just speak the word of faith now that's right but but see people will get a fear on them about it a fear over confession watch how brother brahm deals with that and how can i overcome i think this is marvelous he said now you know that he's a devil you can't say i got a sickness and i don't believe it is a cygnus brother braham said oh yes it is a sickness you got cancer you don't believe it is a cancer he said it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he said you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him oh doesn't that just take the pressure off of you friend we're not in denial we're not trying to just hold something mentally and apply some mental pressure to our problems and try to put positive vibes out into the universe amen we're just believing god's word believe that greater is he that's in me than what i'm going through than what my eyes are telling me then what my flesh is feeling greater is he that's in me hallelujah oh it's not mentally straining brother bram said you can't muster up faith that's what we try to do sometimes it's like it reminds me of uh uh the testimony uh the one charismatic fellow his name escapes me but he talks about brother brandon being first time he was in brother brown's meetings and somebody came up for prayer and and he went up there and and you know all the preachers got around and brother brown just prayed a little simple prayer i believe as a blind girl or something like that and her eyes came open and the guy said well we hadn't even got to shouting yet we were a bunch of pentecostal we haven't even started shouting yet she was already healed you see it's not what we can apply to the problem but it's what what we it's what we speak it's what we believe it's the law of confession but it's very simple and yet it's the thing that trips us up so many times it's the it's it's it's over and over again the the real problem the real root of it in our life is when we depart from the word of god we begin to confess what our eyes are telling us what our flesh is feeling watch this now this is a powerhouse quote brother graham said it's not the thought as christian science makes it like mind over matter no that's not it but he said but your mind accepts it it grasps it and your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it oh my god and then it brings life into you the life is not in you not in your ability not in this world not in the problem not in our analysis not in what we think about it not in our interpretation of it the life is in the word and when you put your mind when your mind when your spirit grasps that word then there's a channel to that word and life that's in the word comes down that channel and brings life into you but the life is not in you it's in the word and all that we have need of is in the word of god but what we've got to do is speak it give it a channel to operate latch hold of it hey man oh brother he said when life comes down that channel into you the word of god is manifested in you the word is the only channel that has life friends what we need to do is cut off from every other voice what i believe about this message i believe that to come to this message and for this message worked for you all of your old denominational ideas have to die if you didn't come out of a church maybe you came out of the world all your worldly ideas have to die all your thoughts all your background all your traditions those things have to die for the message to work for you because the bride has the word she has only the word amen i'm saying this because this is my reality it is my testimony it is my everything it's my world amen this message works amen but but but it's got to be everything to you amen what i suggest you what i recommend brother sister is for you to cut off from every denominational idea from every worldly pleasure from every from every uh from every political party from every pundit from every philosopher from every thought leader from every influencer from every celebrity from anything that is not the word of god because the bride has only the word and that's why she knows what he wants done with the word she's not under any other influence but her life and her narrative and her testimony and her confession is fully subject to the word of god and nothing but the word no book but the bible no law but love hallelujah not any other narrative not any other agenda not any other spin not any other direction not any other poll the bride has the word why do we see message churches becoming lukewarm and formal and powerless we see we see religious spirits coming in we see denominational uh spirits working we see so much to be discouraged about brother sister what it has all come back to somebody got dissatisfied with this message and wanted to bring in some kind of modern theology or bring in a bestseller from the bible bookstore or bring some other idea or some other lien or some other some new or some new thing amen something outside of the word of god but i tell you if you will cling to this message and make it your absolute and make it your everything and make it your confession i i will promise you it will work for you i have a right to promise it to you because god's word promised it first amen oh there's life in it it will vindicate itself the life will be manifested in you when you believe it and give it a chance to work in your life and make it your confession make it your reality make it your everything it's the only channel that has life amen why is there all this why are all these things we look around we see so much to be discouraged about uh physically speaking through what our eyes are seeing people falling away critics rising up this and that church is falling apart formal spirit formality the holy spirit uh the movie and spirit departing from the church all those kind of different things that we look when we see around the world amen amen but what what what brings that formal spirit what makes a church formal we think that formal is you know when you're quiet and starchy and nobody says amen that's formal that's formal well you know that most the time when brother brown is preaching about formalism he's preaching to pentecostals he's preaching to the pentecostal church formal's not what we think it is brother sister formal is normal let that sink in for a minute formal is normal when we think that we're just gonna live our life the way we always have we're gonna attend church the way we would sing the way we always have preach the way we always have all those kind of then then then somehow you know or or in your personal life you just go on just the way you always have treat church the way you always have ta treat as it's just a tradition it's what you do it's just it's just normal normal is the enemy of progress normal is the enemy of deliverance normal is the enemy of revival amen when you do this when we do the same things and have the same attitude and the same confession the same testimony amen the same narrative and then expect things to change expect things get better the devil will have the devil have a playground with that amen the devil loves normal i i uh some things in my heart this morning say god don't ever let me be guilty of being a normal christian i'm not looking for normal christianity i don't want to be a normal preacher i don't want to worship normal sing normal i don't want to get caught in a rut of what is normal to me but god i want to every day die more to my own thinking and and more and more because just perfectly confess your word i want my testimony i want my life i want the whole narrative of the story of my life to be your word oh lord because i know that the only way that i'll soar higher with you is to set my wings to the word of god amen and let the holy spirit blow across that and lift me up out of the mess that i'm in friends you want to soar amen who wants to soar with me i want to sort of new heights amen i i want i want more oh we've had revival in the church but we can have more amen god's done great things in our midst but we could see more we've got this one marvelous revelation of the message of the hour but we could have more light more of a walk with god more reality more power we could have it amen but not if we don't speak it not if we're not willing to change our confession the church won't go any higher i skipped the quote earlier but it's perfect for this moment brother brown said any man will never live any higher or any farther than what he thinks he's living what he believes what his confession is you'll never get any higher than than what you believe you're living so if you so if you're if your walk with god is well you know i go to church on sunday and then monday tuesday wednesday i do my own thing i go to midweek service i sing the songs i like the songs i listen to my pastor preach i like my pastor i pay my tithes i have my daily devo i have all those things but it's just it's just a normal experience maybe it's a social gathering to you maybe maybe maybe the message is just you know it's what we believe because it's what mama and daddy believed amen oh friends because it's what that's what they preach at our church i don't want to be guilty i don't want to be formal i don't want to be normal you say don't worry brother nathan hallelujah but the church won't go any higher without a new narrative watch what brother graham said at kadesh barnea now in catus barney he's preaching about you know uh how people uh uh he's preaching about their caters barney where they're making the decision do we go over the land do we not so they're caught between two opinions and he's so he's talking about people halting in a season of change when god is doing the work when god's when god's making a move when god is when god's changing lives but but the people begin to halt they begin to get caught between two directions he said why are you halting between two opinions why isn't the church on fire why isn't the place packed out with people why aren't great signs and wonders done don't lay it on the pastor it's you he said we've got a mixed multitude one's pulling this way and one the other but you've got to come to a time of decision what are you going to do brother he said god's put the responsibility upon you friends and that's what we get in a church many times when god has anointed a pastor and the pastor's bringing the leadership to the church and god just puts it on his heart here's the direction we're going to go this is the way we're going to do this is the order of it how we're going to do it and then but you've got one one wants to go this way and one wants to go that way and one's listening to that voice and one's listening to that voice and they're both pulling on both sides amen and you get if you ever get that in a church where one's going that way one's going that way that's why we don't get anywhere what we've got to do brother sister is get with the narrative amen trust in the leadership god's given you amen and get with the narrative of the word that's the most important thing all the nonsense of this of this mortal life and the things that we go through in politics and and in daily living and all those kind of things that has no bearing on the bride of jesus christ amen but what we're after is that word amen that word amen the word that's speaking through your pastor the word that speaketh through a prophet amen latch hold of that word and get in with it get with the narrative of it don't just let it wash over you you speak it you begin to push don't pull get behind and push and when we get the whole church excited about the word of god confessing the word of god get getting with the narrative until it becomes more important than your opinion more important than the direction you wanted it to go what is important to you is let me get with the narrative what the holy spirit is leading my church and then we can get somewhere and we can see revival like we never had then we could see young people be you know god has just done something sovereign in our church just in these last two months we've had 11 young people receive the baptism of the holy ghost just the sovereign grace of god amen god is moving friends amen the bride has a revival the move is on for the bride we know that there's a move but you got to move with it you got to get behind it amen you got to support it we all do amen in our local church in the message in the bride body around the world in our individual life we've got to get with the narrative of god's word hallelujah he said god's word said we can have a revival he said god's word said he would raise up in the last days and do signs and wonders and he's done it he said the thing that we've got to do is just get together and start the revival oh friends the word spoken let's get with that narrative amen we read there about how on the road to emmaus jesus comes and walks with those disciples and here are those disciples uh those they were believers these were disciples they were they were believers of jesus message but the problem that they had was wasn't that a lack of faith it wasn't that they weren't sincere wasn't that they didn't believe but they were their perspective was wrong amen because all that they knew about was all the horrible things that happened on good friday they didn't know good friday was good yet amen because they saw the dark they saw the crucifixion they saw those dark clouds they looked around saw the darkness they felt those earthquakes they felt that instability and that's all that they had on their mind because that's what they were looking at that was their whole narrative and and when they were looking at that they couldn't even see jesus christ walking down the road with them they couldn't even recognize his presence because they their narrative their perspective was wrong and so they began to they're just walking with him and they're complaining you know didn't you hear that about the earthquake it didn't you see the darkness didn't you hear about that church fell apart and that that pastor walked away and backslid and didn't you hear about this and that jesus just kind of talked to him he begins to explain the word he said yeah but but you know the bible said he begins to take the old he takes the prophets he begins to deal with him he said you know the bible said there'd be a great falling away amen the bible said there'd be false anointed ones the bible said there'd be darkness and earthquakes and there'd be all those things and he begins what's he doing he's beginning to change their narrative amen he's beginning to change their perspective on the things that were happening and then what does he do he comes in amen and that personal presence of jesus opens the eyes of the believer when you realize that he's present in your life you realize that he's not forsaking you he's not angry at you he's not kicking you away because you made a mistake but he's with you and he's in you and he begins to fellowship with you and break the and what is he trying to do take your eyes off the storm take your eyes off the earth's place take your eyes off the darkness amen and begin to think about the word amen begin to think about the word he he changed their narrative amen he reveals his presence and oh that's what we have friends we know that we have his presence we know we know that he's here amongst the bride of jesus christ he's he's appeared to us he's revealed himself to us he's present amongst us so we're not looking at what's happening out here in the world our narrative is the word our perspective is the word and that's what gives us that good news gospel amen oh here they're all they're all they're stuck in good friday they didn't even they didn't know the easter had come hallelujah friend you might be in your life you might be in the hardest struggle you've ever been through just just discouraged just down just struggling and you you feel like it's a yeah it's a blackest storm that you've been through but it's easter friends you know you don't know it but it's easter amen and you're looking at the wrong things because you're looking at all the misery in your life and the misery in the world when jesus is walking with you easter's here it's the rising of the sun the revelation of his presence changes the perspective last time i was here i preached on that prince of peace there's the disciples tossed on stormy seas and they're tossing those waves and they were so discouraged because what they expected they were seeing because they thought that jesus would come he'd overthrow the roman rule he'd bring peace to the whole world he'd be this great shining empire and all those things and there was no peace in jerusalem there was no peace in rome there wasn't even peace on that boat but the prince of peace was in the boat and when they recognized his presence amen it changed the narrative it changed their perspective amen and our prince of peace has brought us a shalom you know brother graham preached that message shalom and that was his message to the bride it was not to bring us worry but bring us peace amen to change our narrative change our perspective as but you know brother brown sits there and he goes there in sierra vista and he begins to break open shalom and he's preaching and he talks about the darkness that's on the earth and he talks about gross darkness that's on the people and all these dark things and wickedness and all the horrible things going on in the world and he's talking about those things and then he must have discerned something that was happening in the minds of the people because he stops right in the middle and he says listen now he says i'm only showing you the darkness to get to the light to get to the light and he's told the bride of jesus christ he said the reason he said the reason we feel that pressing of the darkness is because there's a light that's pressing out they said the the reason that darkness is weighing so heavy on us is because the the light is pressing again that's why he said it's always darkest just before the dawn because that light begins to press and congeal that darkness friends if it's the darkest day of your life today amen that that that's just more proof that there is a light amen and you can have a peace you can have a shalom but we got to take our eyes off all the negativity and all the things going on around the world and even around the message forget about those things that's not our narrative that's not our gospel it's not our perspective easter changed the narrative amen it's the rising of the sun the darkness is banished you might be in the valley of the shadow of death but the shadow only proves there's a light that's with you step out from behind that rock amen get into the sun lay in the message let it ripen you let it let it bring sunshine to your life let it change your confession from misery to joy don't look at the political realm don't look at the worldly sin don't look at those things all of it is is unstability it's satan's eden it's all falling apart and all of it is only dark to prove that you have the light what we need friends amen it's somebody that will take this message and not just believe it but speak it brother man said what we need is thousands of lived voices amen not just somebody who'll just pay lip service but somebody who will live a life and have a testimony and have a confession that this message is the truth then he said you know what that would be that's the thunder that shakes the devil amen so then when you've got that thunder in you friends and you're tossed on the storm like those disciples and things aren't going the way that you expected and there's disappointments and you're upset with god and you can't understand why everything's happening but then that thunder begins to roll amen and the darkness of this world sweeps over and you feel that cold rain in your face i'll tell you what you do thunderback amen we got to thunder back when the darkness pushes on you let that light rise up in the inside and push out amen when the earthquakes come and the darkness come amen we know that our easter we know that our resurrection is at hand glory be to god let's stand amen let's stand hallelujah amen amen i wonder if somebody here today would raise your hand and a witness say brother nathan from this day forward i'm changing my narrative i'm changing my confession i i'm not looking at the circumstance anymore i confess that i am healed i confess i am delivered i confess i got my joy restored i confess i've got peace in the middle of this storm that i'm going through i confess this message is true i confess that god is good i confess that that that that that
