the family just as I woke up on Tuesday morning since the prayers of the Saints I stood up in bed I said my I said this is tremendous just your sense then and then you know you you start with things

begin to speak to my heart and I'll tell you throughout the time throughout this whole time I shared this with my mom was shared it with my wife I said there's been statement after statement while I've been traveling on the roads and doing everything's I've heard the voice that got used in this in time I heard brother branham's voice I heard different quotes being said to me over no rehearsing scriptures and quotes just coming from messages throughout the time I'll tell you what that I'm further although spirit he said I'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever things I've said unto you Amen you know we just I tell you I think God to me it's more precious the message that God has sent to us is more precious to me now than it ever was it's more precious that the relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and to know him as as my redeemer is so precious I thank God for His mercy in His grace and I think the Lord for mine for by the Giri being here during this time and it just been just

degree [Music] so logical [Music] we're recién is last drop of blood for me [Music] the first degree as he stood there in the judgment hall that day I find no fault in him Pilate did say angry crowds set Barabbas free but they found Jesus guilty of love in the first degree water in the quarter would you bring the prisoner forth please and what sir is your name and he said Jesus of Nazareth you're accused of healing on the Sabbath day and many other things the elders did say and they say the disciples put corn on the seventh day and did eat and that you yourself set with sinners at meat and what have you to say but he kept silent that day but wait let's see what the witnesses have to say [Music] [Music] my name is Bartimaeus I was blind and could not see the light of day oh but I can see today because of him and then another came in another and then there was another and he said I was a leper I was one of the ten and I've come back this final day just to glorify Him and on and on they came that day and Egypt had for him kind words to say but then the crowd began to cry crucified crucified give us Barabbas this man here he must die so they took him away to a place it's called Calvary and nailed him to a cross between two thieves for the jury that surely found him guilty guilty of love in the first degree [Music] guilty of love in the first degree [Music] we reach it his last drop of blood for me [Music] beauty hey man if you could stand with me please I just want to talk to the author for a moment before we open the word Heavenly Father Lord way as we stand behind this sacred desk you're gone approaching Lord this time in this service Lord we do it with all respect and honor the position in which you've placed us dear God and and the seriousness Lord where we stand lord I ask God this you will guide this now Lord may your anointing rest upon me Lord to be able to speak to the people Lord be a help to them just strengthen and lift them up they're gone to encourage them Lord Lord we ask all these things and thy name into the glory of God amen perfect meeting your Bibles if you would to Hebrews chapter 6 I'd like to read Hebrews chapter 6 verse 11 through 15 we desire that every one of you should shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise but when God have made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise now if you could turn me to Hebrews chapter 10 I want to read verses 35 and 36 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise you may be seated I want to speak on patience it's something we all have need of it's something that this world doesn't have the message of the Queen of Sheba brother Branham says the only way you can be saved is by faith you've got to look at the unseen and the whole armor of Christianity is supernatural how that a man can say that he believes in God and preaches in a church and says he does not believe in the supernatural when the full armor of God the full armor of Christianity is supernatural what is the armor of Christianity love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness patience faith Holy Spirit all those things are supernatural what is love what is joy go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarters worth of it by me a quarters worth of patience I need it right now you can't buy love joy peace longsuffering goodness patience gentleness and faith you can't buy it it's supernatural and the whole armor of Christian is supernatural worth bidden by the scriptures to put on the whole armour of God be girded about the whole armour if we could if it can be bought then people would be buying it but then maybe not this world is set up on the one and everything faster faster faster faster faster I can remember with my first computer when I got it why it had to think a while when I was looking up something and I used to joke that there was a man in there chiseling everything out in rock how slow it was then I got a better computer and it was a little faster and then faster computers came out then the internet came out and it was on dial-up and sometimes you'd drop your connection but you'd have to if you researched anything and looked up anything it would be a while that it'd be searching before it could bring something up and then it would take a while to even load it and if it had pictures on it forget about it and then you know they developed faster and faster ways and yet people are still not satisfied they want it faster than fast I was standing in line at McDonald's one day and heard can people complaining because they weren't getting their food fast enough it's a fast food restaurant you're getting it as fast as they can put it out they're back there working you know but they wanted even faster maybe they should go to a machine where they can just put in money and pull out a sandwich or something but impatience and this young generation has come up why they're even more impatient they want to grow up right now they want to be out on their own right now they want to be have their say over what they're going to do right now they turned fifteen years old they want to be 18 and they can't wait until they get old enough to move out and be on their own and some of them will even do it before they get old mouth just can't wait I remember my grandmother telling me don't loose your life away and when I was 15 wanting to be 16 I didn't really understand what she meant by that now at the age of 54 I realized what she means if I don't wish your life away let's read from Luke 21 19 Luke 21 verse 19 in your patience possess ye your souls in your patience possess you your souls it takes patience to have self-control takes patience to have forgiveness perseverance humility an impatient person does not possess or control their soul their soul is possessed by impatience anger greed revenge hatred doubt self caused ignorance and blindness among the things Christians may have to face our indifference on the part of others reproach misrepresentation intense hostility hatred even sometimes among relative family mistreatment this calls for endurance without this essential quality a person simply could not come into possession of eternal life this is because it counts what counts as the finish not the start jesus said he that endureth till the end for the random citizen to Philadelphia in church age is quoting from revelations 3 and 10 said because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth what does he mean by the word of his patience Hebrews 16 13 through 15 for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee multiply and I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the Spirit is speaking about the Word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of the word required patience even as it did in the case of abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word was finally fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instance you prayed you would never learn patience but would become more impatient with life let me show you this truth more fully Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises the Word of God offered up his only begotten Son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise most think as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good promises of God that there could be could not be a trial but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise God give us exceedingly great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patients into our souls for only in patience do we possess life there's where he's speaking about impatience possess we are souls may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the sixth age learn patience we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome and over in patience and haste it requires patience to be able to endure when you're going through a trial a test and you know these trials and tests there for character building there for training it is and sometimes it's for correction and when we're going through them we pray and we are looking for the end of it sometimes we wonder how long is this gonna take how long is he going to live or be in humans we would like it to be over quickly but to be Christians we must learn to endure and the only way you can learn to endure is for you the trial to be sometimes long for the testing sometimes for you the trial you don't see the end of it there are some times when your tribe buy something and as soon as you're being tried you can see the end you can see why you're being tried but there are other times you go through it to where you can't see the andum you don't know what you're supposed to learn from it yet and it takes patience to wait on God when we see someone in our family going through something I know myself I'd like to jump in and take care of it for them but or my church members in this in the congregation I'd like to just jump in and take care of it for but there's some times when there's nothing I can do there's times when I don't have the answer all I can do is pray for them sometimes you think well if I could just say something no sometimes it's best if you remain silent and just take it to the Lord in prayer because the whole thing is in God's hands and there might be times you think you know what you're doing but he knows what he's doing that's never a question and he knows God sees the beginning from the end and he knows it's the devil that comes to brains sometimes these temptations and these God allows him to bring these times of trials sickness sometimes can be a trial and you're praying and asking for a healing and you wonder how long is it's gonna last and you know that God can heal you instantly you know that God could perform a miracle he's the one that created these bodies and yet it seems like you're healing seems to be beyond you and you just wait on the Lord but I can tell you this every time that I've been through a test that dealt with my health I have come out learning something I have come out a better Christian I've come out stronger and I wouldn't trade to one of those times further or an easier route when I went through other trials I can look and say at times at the end of the trial say boy I hope I pass this one cuz I really don't want to go through it again I don't want to have to take a test over again hey older ministers done went on used to say that if you if you God gives you a test and you fell it well you'll just give it to you again until you pass it you just have to take it over again and I've watched people take the same test over and over and over when it's a testing of your where you're going to stand it'll come in different ways but it's still the same test when it's a testing of whether you're going to put family first or put God first different situations it'll come in different situations but it'll still be the same test when it comes to your faith it can come in many different ways it can come through illness it could come through finances it could come through so many different ways and yet it's the same test he's trying us and he's building patience to wait on him for the answer to wait on him to bring us through it I've been in the midst of a trial to where I would to put my own hand to it I would try to devise the way whereby it would be over and I would try to be very clever about it and then he wouldn't work out and I think Lord this would have been so much easier if you'd have done it this way but that's the human part of us Lord if you'd have done it the way I seen it we'd be over this by now but you see he's not worried about the test or the trial he's not worried about whether he can bring you through it or not what God is concerned with is what happens during it abraham was tried first to see if he would believe the promise and the promise was given there was a time of delay a time between when the promise was given and when the promise was fulfilled and during that time of the delay it's where a lot of people fail but he was tested first to see if he would believe the promise irregardless of what the circumstances said as he and Sarah grew older and they got beyond the ages of childbearing they were beyond the ages of the reproductive systems working but would he still believe the promise [Applause] the change in their bodies didn't come right away it came because they endured because abraham believed the promise and in believing the promise it brought about the fulfillment of the word but then after he received the promise sometimes we think I have to receive it then the trials over with no Abraham was tried even after he received the promise what was tried whether he would still believe Hebrews chapter 11 verse 8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange land a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise where he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth Abraham knew that Isaac had come from the dead in the first place the God from the dead in other words their reproductive system was dead it was shut down on both of them and from that God still brought about the promise and brought about this son and Abraham seen the Bible says that if he could bring one from the dead he could raise him back up again and so when he was tried to see if he would offer his only begotten Son he was faithful and obeyed the word of the Lord and I'll tell you what you sometimes there is a there are tests like that where it seems like that all is going to be lost you look and you see all the things that God's given you and then sometimes you'll go through a trial where it seems like maybe it'll all be lost but there was a ram in the thing he was Jehovah Jireh he provided himself the sacrifice amen Psalms 105 19 says until the time that his word came the word of God tried him this is talking about referring to Joseph until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him speaking of Joseph Joseph you think about it you know the story he was taken by his brothers who were jealous of him envious of it and they sold him into slavery but something about Joseph Joseph never got down Joseph there was something about him that hope was always there hope of what that God Jehovah would take care of him Jehovah had given him dreams and in the dream his brothers were going to fall down before him Joseph believed those dreams he didn't know how they would come about and Joseph wasn't looking at the dreams in a way of trying to lift himself up he wasn't looking at the dreams in a way of having what we would call a big head than him wanting to see his brothers die before him he's looking at us God showed him something he didn't completely understand it or how it would come about but he believed that it would be Joseph had to keep faith through everything that he went through and every and the reason that you see kept faith was in every situation God still blessed him even when Potiphar's wife falsely accused him then he went to prison God still blessed him there and you look at it and say how was he ever going to get to the right hand of Pharaoh when Joseph's case the way up was down humility humble himself and he was patient to wait Joseph couldn't see what was going to happen from one situation to the next he didn't know when he was first given to Potiphar why as he was blessed Potiphar was blessed Joseph didn't see what the next step was going to be when he was thrown in prison he didn't know what the next thing was gonna be but he was patient and that he knew it was in God's hands and he depended on Jehovah you don't hear of Joseph crying in despair but Joseph helped everyone that he was around Joseph must have thought of others and not been a self-centered individual had he been self-centered Potiphar would have never been blessed but he wasn't self-centered that's something that this generation coming up is very so everything is about them every situation if they get around you a situation you're going through they'll somehow turn around to be about them not everything's about you where Joseph had fainted and he waited and then there was a time when God raised him up to be at the right hand of Pharaoh he was second in command in Egypt nube and then he couldn't see how the dreams were going to be fulfilled but then a famine came into the land to try the children of Israel and so because of Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams he was able to store up grain for these seven years of famine you wonder during those seven years of plenty was it just plenty in Egypt or was it plenty everywhere I imagine it was plentiful everywhere because Jacob and his sons had no need to go anywhere else they must not have been very frugal during those years of plenty because when the years of famine came they had nothing and so the dreams came to pass in a way that none of them could have ever seen it happen was there to actually deliver them from their time of need the spoken word is the original seed brother branham said that's what's a matter today they don't want to wait for God's time they want to get something else and so the devil's got the wisdom right there to give it to them just couldn't wait I've got a little story here I read some years ago and if you'll allow me and bear with me it's something even the children could understand and I'll read it to you it's called the Frog and the toad and the flower garden here are some flower seeds plant them and soon you will have a garden said frog how soon toad acts quite soon said frog toad ran home and planted the flower seeds as fast as he could now see and start growing toad said as he walked up and down and up and down watching for signs of growth the seeds did not grow tongue cut down on his knees to get closer to the ground and said now seeds start growing the seeds did not grow maybe they can't hear me very good thought toad cold but his mount very close to the ground and shouted now seed start growing the seeds still did not grow frog come running to see what all the noise was about and toad explained about his seeds not being able to hear him problem said that's nothing to do with it just leave the seed alone for a few days let the Sun Shine on them let the rain fall on them and they'll start to grow soon enough as the darkness of night began to approach toad still could not see any signs of growth on the part of the seeds they must be afraid of the dark he thought I will read them a story so he got a candle for light and a book to read to the seeds so it's a calm there fear you read to them as the candle light cast around the mouth but still the seeds did not grow the next day told sang songs to the seeds to make him feel happy but the seeds didn't grow the next day he read poems to them to encourage their cultural awareness but the seeds did not grow the next day toad played music to make the seeds feel lively but still the seeds did not grow by the end of the day told was very tired and out of ideals of how to make the seeds grow he's head down to think about it at a last fell asleep sleep from exhaustion the Sun rose the next morning and found toes still asleep told slip all through today and all through the night the next morning he was awakened by frog and said look toad your seeds have started to grow toad looked and saw a little green shoots coming out of the ground and says it's about time they started to grow after all the hard work I've done now I have to do it all over again I suppose to get them to have flowers sometimes that's the way we sing we'll do this and we'll do that and we'll do the other and we'll do something else and we're trying to figure out how to to produce this answer to our problem but it's all you got to do is wait just as the seeds had the germ of life in them that that was all that was required to make them grow so is the seeds of the word I told you it was just a simple little story but here's some quotes do along with it when you sow a seed you don't dig it up every morning to see if it come to pass if you do your seed will never come up you got to plant it commit it to the earth and let alone it's up to nature God to water it and see that it produces is that true that's the way we receive every word of God causes the seed we receive it into our heart and committed to God and forget about it God does the rest of it cause he promised he would and show us the Father he says now when you bury a seed you farmers you take and go out there and plant your corn you don't go out every morning and scratch it up and say let's see now is it growing anything happened to it no put it back down late the next day you say I want to see if it's getting along all right scratch it up again it'll never grow like that well the thing you do with the seed you commit it to the ground and cover it up and that's all you can do about it it's up to God to do the rest of it well that's the same way it is with the Word of God if you'll take any divine promise of God laid in his Bible and put it in your heart and water it every day with the praises of God that's going to that it's going to come to pass it'll grow you don't have to quit if you don't quit fooling with it you'll just leave it alone don't say let me see can I move my finger any better today do I feel any better is my headache a little better oh no it'll never be that just committed to God walk away and leave it alone that's God's seed it'll grow every time you dig it up you delay it and he's talking about divine healing he says in doubt son of David have mercy on me says but we don't always know you know God's works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform now just commit them to God that's all you have to do don't put your hand on it anymore let God have it if you're going to do something about it then God will stand back and let you go ahead till you get finished but when you committed to God and let him have it then he will do it you just believe him and stand back and don't work but believe that's where grace is imputed for righteousness if you believe that God will I've been there when God stand back and say we'll go ahead and do what you're gonna do Jerry and then when I get to the end of it let's say well it didn't work and then where am I at right back at the start again where am I at right back to where I should have been committed it to God in the first place God in his people he says he can't do it until as long as you're holding it now I will see if I'm any better see if this will work you committed to him and forget about the rest of it go testify of things you don't even see you believe it it's not what you see it's what you believe that's how you're saved is by faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you don't see taste feel smell or hear you just believe it and act as though it was act as though it had already happened the word is a seed the seed is in the right kind of ground it'll grow you don't dig it up every morning to find out whether it's grown or not you just plant it committed to God leave it there that's the way to let it grow just leave it the way in the ground and that's where I'm it's supposed to be the ground of your heart faith is watering it hourly saying if God said so it's mine that's the way to do it he asked here how long does a baby cry until he gets what he's asked for God recommends this for his children God recommends this for his believing children he did not intellectual speeches not some theological teaching he wants you to cry out for your needs that's right crowd for it you're too stiff and starchy you'll never get it if you're ready to limber yourself up a little and cry God will give it to you he likes to hear his children cry cry your needs to God God wants it that's his provided way cry out that's the way the baby cries that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry until he gets satisfied that's the way the believing Christians should do God's child if you see God made the promise don't give up cry until it's answered cry until you see God vindicate his word when God vindicated it's working proofs it's here then you don't have to cry numb worn you've got it walk away and thanking for it until you do that scream out do you get it I like that persistent holding on not a high-bred plant not one that has to be babied petted and packed them around Christians are real genuine born articles of God they fight for their position and they fight til they're finished on this earth every move of it is a fight now this crying is not complaining seen folks go through trials or a time of testing testing to see if they'll believe for their healing and they'll call around and complain to everybody you ask them you ask them out in the parking lot how are you feeling and then you immediately wish you hadn't asked I like the testimony of the woman who said all is well even in death she testified all is well why it was committed to God she believed that if she could get to the prophet of God that God was gonna raise her boy back up so when she was asked how is it with you your husband and your child she said all is well it's always that way for the believer for the believer all is well all the time why because we're in God and He is give his angels charge over you to watch over you here with me to Genesis chapter 17 wanted to read verses 1 3 when Abraham was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now listen to this and I will make my covenant between me and thee who is gonna do it God and will multiply the exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful was it up to Abraham no God says I will make you exceedingly fruitful I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting covenant to be God unto them and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God it's not within our power anyway but he promised that he would take care of us he promised to be our Shepherd he's our Savior and he is faithful Genesis 48 verse three and four and Jacob said unto Joseph God Almighty appeared unto me that lust in the land of Canaan and blessed me and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee i will make of the multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession so we first read where he was speaking to Abraham and he was telling Abraham I going to do this and then in the fulfillment of that promise to the generations after Abraham he comes to Jacob and again says in rehearses what he had said to Abram years before I'm gonna make you fruitful I'm gonna multiply you exceedingly God's gonna do it who's gonna bring about the answer that we need God will now he's got many different avenues in which he'll bring it sometimes he can bring the answer through your pastor but then there's times when the answer is not going to come to you until the end of the time of testing and then you can look back and you see all there's what it was patience you imagine the patients that Noah had Noah was given the Word of God that he was gonna flood the earth and he was given instructions on how to build the ark detailed instruction and you know I think if it would have been maybe you or I in Noah's place Noah being human just like we are Noah had no idea that it was going to be a hundred and twenty years before it happened but Noah set forth to work on the ark like it was gonna happen tomorrow and he had patience because brother branham said he was mocked by the people brother branham gives an example of he says like mr. skeptic and mr. critic and they would come by and they would laugh at him because of what he was doing the work that he was doing and what he said was going to happen had never ever happened before in the beginning the earth was watered from a mist that rose up from the ground but now he said water is gonna fall from the sky and it's gonna rain so much that it's gonna flood the whole word and the only ones is gonna be saved as those that get in this art with me now God knowing the beginning from the end made room for eight people [Applause] but Noah still had to preach that to the people for a hundred and twenty years patient and on year 90 he believed it just as much as he did on day one not knowing that it was still yet going to be thirty more years before it happened how long 120-year as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man I wonder when will be that time to where we're preaching the souls are in prison now you realize last one comes in then there's going to be a time when that part of the third pool is fulfilled I believe that in many instances there are people who hear and know about this truth and they've already rejected it they're in prison now they're waiting for the time of judgment that's all they're waiting for that's how close we are we've heard preaching that there's going to be a rapture and time has went on we don't know if there was anybody else that might have at first thought maybe he's right maybe snow was right maybe there's something to that but in the time of the delay they said no no he's not right there's nothing to it we've heard about a rapture coming for years we've believed I can remember as a little boy I never thought I would reach adulthood I thought the rapture was gonna take place already I can remember the time the world was where the United States rather was celebrating their 200 years 1970s thing and I can remember thinking we only got one more year and yet time went on and we're in the time of the delay right now the Bible said they would say the LORD hath delayed his coming and they would stray from the truth we were closer and what we've got to do is patiently endure because the end is near I don't know how they could go on much longer few days ago I was talking to one of my uncle's and he said I can't see it going on another 25 years here but we've got it in doer I don't know how long it's gonna be but in the same token we don't know how many more days we have as individual when is our time up when is it our time to go so endure be patient death we grieve we're grieving for our loss we're grieving for the times that we know that we're going to miss them knowing that we won't be able to sit down maybe and drink another cup of coffee with them we rise up they're not going to be there and we grieve but they're not grieving they have endured until their time and they are rewarded actually by being taken they're ready whenever I think of things like that I think of brother Branham and his first wife hope and I think of her having two young babies brother Ram talks about trying to warm up Billy Paul's bottle with his body yeah so Billy Paul was still young enough he was a baby and another baby sharing road and a young husband they were just a young married couple and yet she says to him why did you call me back something happened a few moments before that her mind may have been on those two children her mind may have been on her leaving her husband her mind me have been on those things but then after she catches a glimpse of that other side she says why did you call me back to me that says something about where we're going [Applause] and it says something about where our loved ones are I wouldn't want to call my dad back he suffered a lot the last few years I wouldn't want to call him back to that but through all his suffering he endured he was patient never complaining but patient we have need of patience the bottle that I encourage you with this message that was on my heart this morning let patience have it's perfect way in you tribulation worketh patience the Bible said amen I'm gonna close before I get into the next message I'll read this to you this is the message of getting in the spirit what we need today is back to the fruit of the Spirit love joy peace faith long-suffering God can send a gift among them and they will call it telepathy they'll call it the devil they'll call it something else if one church is sponsoring it the other one will pick it up it's all right now because this one had something to do with it it's no good oh my what a pitiful condition yes sir we realize that the fruit of faith the fruit of love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience patience why they can't bear seven days with one another hardly seven hours sometimes not even seven minutes they'll jump up and round the church if you say something that's not exactly what their little pet theory is they got to get up and run out of the church over it oh they can't sit still in wait a minute they got to get out of there all that ain't what pastor so-and-so says hallelujah I don't have to listen to that no such stuff oh you miserable there you are go ahead patience now in closing I've got one thing that I can tell you that if you want to have a feeling of I can't hardly wait for something to happen let it be this you got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church and how we behave ourselves in Church of God how we got to come in here together and sit in heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers and sisters if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got the brain because we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us much more as we see the Day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another that's right stay right together reminds me of brother Bentham saying the angel said to him when he was beyond the curtain of time says only perfect love and enter here something all these things is fruits of the spirit they all go hand in hand long suffering something we need to be with one another we're human we're still in this flesh let me make mistakes and we're not perfect and sometimes we say things and we didn't mean it to come out the way it came out sometimes we say things at the wrong times but be long-suffering love one another be patient with one another those dogs working on us all amen god bless you [Applause] what a word of encouragement you know I just take it how that God comes down through his word and he gives it's how God gives leadership you know the precious reality in this hour that we live in you think of the message where the Prophet speaks leadership and right before that he speaks on come follow down me it's still the message of leadership and brother Branham is cautioning even in that message come follow thou me he cautions even the young people he says I don't want this message to be intellectual I believe that's caution to all of our hearts and I believe that real leadership that real leadership becomes by this presence of the Lord coming down through his word because when you look in many times through the scriptures it says as it the promise and Joel - that he pour out his spirit upon all flesh young men shall dream dreams or prophesy they will mentioning dreams all of those things in there it the Spirit of God falling throughout this earth but yet God being mindful as the Lord took brother Jerry and God Reed made the promise known to Abraham he rehearsed it to Jacob he rehearsed it on down through and that saying God has been generation age after age rehearsing the promise that he made when the Holy Spirit comes down through the word it's not just a feeling it's not just something to wear that was a mine just-just-just forbidden and then the presence of God called my the Holy Spirit but it gives leadership and you say well how do you know that it gives leadership because we hear his voice it's not just something we feel we hear his voice and then we see as we yield to that and Submission we see that leadership that word takes preeminence in our lives to guide us from where our feelings might be thoughts might be even to guide you maybe even this morning from some that are here and where your soul might be but yet the voice of God speaks to bring things and bring you bring me where we need to be what do I have to do do the same thing that he has done once again this morning he has submitted himself to you the Lord of glory has come and submitted himself to your needs and my needs when God makes a promise in his word Ephesians 5 submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God he gives his word is who he is so he came here this morning to submit himself to minister to our needs so what does that do to us it draws from us to say yes Lord be it unto me Lord God Lord if there's any cloud of doubt Lord God you are light the Rays or God of your presence as Moses could say the Lord bless thee the Lord keep thee the Lord make his face to shine upon thee that's our promise that's our promise if there be anything Lord at all that's out of line Lord Jesus forgive me Lord let it be brought back in line if there's anything that's hindering that patients that steadfastness to look at things the way that I ought to look at it Lord Jesus cleanse me Lord God allow the bathing of the word of the Holy Spirit to just move and just and do what he alone is able to do and receive it because that words already come the words already been washing take your opportunity this is your labor this is your Lutron this is your place that God has provided that you can bathe in this word this morning and bathe by the way by the way all trepidations bathe away fear bathe away doubt they the way anything that would hinder because the word Christ Himself standing in the midst of it is our absolute a minute he though the vision Terry it shall surely come to pass Amen God is faithful and you know I I couldn't help but think brother Jerry I've really enjoyed that story that toad in the Frog because what I thought of is this there's some times that we might not see results in the manner and in the time that we want to see him and when it doesn't happen in that way then Satan will come and try to try to poke doubt at you as to there's something wrong with you because he knows he's not going to be able to poke to you that there's something wrong with this truth but I tried to say there's something wrong with you so then what is what is this what is this whole objective to get you looking at you oh that's dangerous it's dangerous that's what happened with Bildad in life as and I don't remember the other fellas name that came to Joe or the gene they got the talking to him and all of a sudden they got Joe away from talking about his sacrifice Jobe started looking at himself trying to justify himself but I'm so glad that there was Ellie who became Ella who said I'll let all the rest of him speak because he said I thought those were ancient would have words of wisdom I let him speak God has led or everything speak but a lion came to roar and Ella who said I am clay as thou art clay I am in thy stead in the stead of God for thee amen he came to speak and prepare Joe for God to come down and speak to him it was gone all along it was God in Ella who God has prepared it's God moving it's God directing us sometimes and I think of that that story but Raven stuffed my hair the toad was wasn't singing over it and everything he was doing I've been told I've been told but when you look at it this is what I was was so inspired to my heart is just remain and just let the word by the Spirit of God have it's perfect work just keep laying under the word letting the word just move in your hearts move in our lives and watch God bring forth what he alone is able to do it's not our strength is history I'll tell you sister faith that we have to stand for this moment it's not something that we have given ourselves but it's God who has created and brought the faith that we need for this moment it's all sovereignly jehovah-jireh you're loving this morning just a greater dedication just let God fulfill his promise let it draw you when God has made a promise to your heart just let just say Lord I surrender to that promise God makes a promise to fill you with the Holy Spirit let him fulfill that promise give yourself to that promise any promise that God has made when it is a promise of healing just give yourself to it say Lord this is my promise and our warship here Lord I worship your Lord we have promised for your home promise for marriage I warship here Lord I worship you the promise for the rapture I worship your Lord I worship you let's just pray or Jesus your presence is so wonderful Lord such a sweet sweet presence or Jesus Lord Jesus thank you you come down Lord here this morning and speaking to our hearts your presence largest moving Lord right here among us Lord God father to let each and every one of us know your love your care your complete provision Lord I pray father that Lord for each and every one law that is here and under the sound Lord of a voice your God may it just Lord be just a submission Lord to how that what you have spoken Lord by way of your word here this morning sing Lord draw me Lord Jesus I come Lord I yield to you Lord you Lord are the fulfillment of your word Lord Lord for that need for how that you've spoken to that hard and that life may they not look and get their eyes on all of the disappointments Lord because you've never disappointed no one has never been one believer that's ever been disappointed but Lord our disappointments is bitten because things didn't either happen according to our way or our time but your grace just as it was to John with John speaking the word that was true but yet he had his thinking of how would come about and your prophets that he became offended but then you sent the word to say go tell John but ghosts show him and are these things that take place oh my lord you knew what John needed you did not become focused upon he is a cloud of his Eagle Eye you knew what was needed Lord it was the word the word of the Lord being fulfilled that would bring John out of that place Lord Father here this morning Lord how did you Lord came and have ministered to our hearts Lord how we praise your wonderful name I pray that Lord if there's one year this morning that doesn't know you may they surrender Lord Lord you surrender Lord to you Lord to the promise that you have given Lord for your faithful Lord Jesus may they Lord just set their sights on that promise Lord Lord God until step by step Lord in everything that they do Lord step by step they become one but that promise Lord Father for healing Lord some here this morning some are not here with us Lord because they're sick and they're body lord I pray Heavenly Father that Lord God that may that promise Lauren as they hold that dear to their bosom Lord knowing that father that what you have promised Lord you certainly fulfill Lord I pray God give them strength Lord if they're weary strengthen them Lord may they receive strength Lord an encouragement Lauren that will so lord help them law to move through that weariness Lord some here this morning Lord that perhaps Lord in the midst as our brothers spoke of a test a trial or maybe even that of the healing of the body to where they don't see the end Lord God may Lord they receive strength Lord here this morning receiving Lord what you've delivered Lord God to us through your word that you are mindful Lord may they Lord God receive strength Lord to be able to Lord to push back Lord the weariness Lord even taking a step to say yes Lord I see Lord that you are watching over all things Lord and Lord if there be any Lord and if we could say it like the story was spoken this morning if any of us have been being towed lord over the ground and over the seeds and over the promises forgive us Lord forgive us Lord have we've been digging it up and looking at it forgive us Lord father may this be us moment Lord of solemn commitment Lord to you father lord I pray right now God within every heart for every life Lord for every need Lord father we just ask God for just a a complete committal Lord here this morning Lord from that heart if it's a heart that says Lord I maybe it's a loved one maybe it said Lord some other need and seems like that I just so feel like I can let go of it but God may they be honest with you and say Lord helped me to get to that place of committal Lord because I know that that is your word Lord I'm not gonna fake it I'm not gonna pretend it but I'm asking you lord help me to come to that place Lord of commit Oh Lord God to where I can commit it Lauren fully Lord into your hands Lord granted Lord we pray father Lord we love you this morning it's appreciate your goodness and your mercy Lord all Lord Jesus how wonderful you are father thank you Lord Jesus thank you lord thank you Jesus we bless your wonderful name Lord Oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus a minute now [Music] don't claim to be a hero all the answers [Music] to stop was over [Music] it's not because I'm good not because of grace not because I'm strong I just had ask me how it is but I'm still standing you wonder have made the stone I can boast of any special powers there's no secrets I just held on and the head gym store was sold I don't play to be a hero don't have all the answers [Music] cheers No now because I'm good happy cause and great now because I'm strong just [Music] I can tell the things finally happened I've got blessings now I can call my many times I wondered if I would make it slower you're in I just can't and [Music] the small [Music] not because [Music] that's beautiful isn't it I bet you thankful for God's grace hallelujah amen I thought about what brother Jerry what he mentioned here and with brother with his lot in Noah's life try to try to hinder and try to come in priorities things but always remember this life it's fleeting everything that you can have and whatever in this life nothing is worth the Lord not being first and I'll mean that with all my heart nothing is worth it if there's an ambition if there's any goal if there's any objective let it be one thing and that is the coming of the Lord live for it live for him each and every day and every moment so beside me I want this thing it's not worth it's not worth it if it comes between you and dedicating your life to the Lord fully but both Simon finally worked like for Sunday's I can have it you're out of the will of God that's thus saith the Lord God will never cause you to compromise his word never it's us sometimes it needs to come back to the place to say Lord I'm I want this but this is not according to what you have for me let him be first that's a principle he's first in all things and he said all these other things will be added unto you sometimes you seem like you got a lot on your plate he said I got this on my plate I got this on my plate I got this on my plate but remember if you sacrifice anywhere don't sacrifice on coming to the house of God you sacrifice meals sacrifice time of pleasure sacrifice every other thing but don't sacrifice come into the house of God because if God led you to that job and if God has opened a certain door for you you owe him everything that you are that he is first in everything because when you start taking back and taken away from it then what you're telling the Lord is is Lord I got this I got this but see you cannot overcome that principle seek you first God is faithful one thing for sure we know that we're not going we don't have an easy journey there's nothing easy nothing comes easy we fight for everything everything you fight for I would rather have the Lord standing with me than me trying to fight it on my own me man I just love him this morning amen we're gonna let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus and let's sing that song as we are being dismissed in the presence of Jehovah hallelujah in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty the Prince of Peace troubles vanish and hearts are mended in the presence of the [Music] [Music] oh it's
