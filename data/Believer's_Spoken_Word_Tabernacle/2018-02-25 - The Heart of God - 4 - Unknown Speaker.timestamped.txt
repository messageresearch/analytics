[31:25] that we would think they need to go he's
[31:28] still good you know there's times in our
[31:32] lives and it sometimes it's easy to
[31:35] worship sometimes it's it's more
[31:39] difficult to but it's it's when we look
[31:42] at it it all comes down to a sacrifice
[31:45] that's when that's when a real sacrifice
[31:47] and you know when you think of how that
[31:50] David even mentioned in the scriptures
[31:52] David said I will sacrifice a sacrifice
[31:55] of Thanksgiving unto you now to think of
[32:00] that even when we don't seem to have our
[32:06] prayers answered for all of these things
[32:09] but David said yet in the midst of all
[32:11] that I will sacrifice a sacrifice of
[32:14] Thanksgiving I'm still going to thank
[32:17] him even when I'm praying and I don't
[32:20] have the answer but I'm going to still
[32:22] think he's worthy we have that we have
[32:28] that assurance that he is working all
[32:30] things truly after the counsel of his
[32:33] own will we just want to just say I just

[37:23] you for the congregation Lord grouping a
[37:26] believers Lord that Lord Jesus of lay
[37:29] beside Lord of their time Lord to be in
[37:32] the house of God because Lord we realize
[37:35] that these things Lord our time though
[37:38] it being Lord but a temporal moment but
[37:40] Lord it is eternity Oh God
[37:43] these are eternal things Lord God for
[37:46] it's you Lord Jesus we want to feed upon
[37:49] you Lord this morning father Lord speak
[37:52] to our hearts now I pray in the name of
[37:55] Jesus Christ amen
[37:56] God blesses our being seated
[38:08] we know that with when we look at
[38:10] pulsations and many times they'll look
[38:14] at the pulse the pulse or the heartbeat
[38:17] of an individual and sometimes they'll
[38:19] be able to tell whether or not that a
[38:22] person whether they're truthful and you
[38:26] also be able to tell what that person
[38:28] sometimes is going through sometimes we
[38:31] also know that it's things sometimes
[38:33] that can be said that would cause maybe
[38:36] a pulse to really become rapid sometimes
[38:39] it's thoughts that come into our minds
[38:41] and things that would arise and if we
[38:44] would we entertain and we find ourselves
[38:46] and our pulse gets really up but you
[38:49] know there also is what they call a a
[38:51] resting pulse or a resting heart rate
[38:53] and that that really is is well
[38:55] something that they'll use many times to
[38:58] be able to tell where maybe a person is
[39:01] within their health but we know that
[39:03] there is without the heart itself in our
[39:06] body that there is there's just no way
[39:10] for us to live and I think we all agree
[39:12] with that from youngest to oldest but we
[39:14] see that with the heart itself how that
[39:16] such a responsibility that the heart
[39:19] would have were in that it would pulsate
[39:23] and it would send forth not just a
[39:25] gathering of the blood but then it
[39:27] serves to take the blood and and
[39:30] replacing it there in the lungs and then
[39:33] taking the oxygen out of the lungs and
[39:35] putting that through the body as well as
[39:37] taking the different nutrients of foods
[39:40] that we have eaten and breaking down all
[39:43] of those foods and taken that to the the
[39:45] cells of the body that the cells and the
[39:47] different organs and all those things
[39:49] can be properly nourished and at the
[39:51] same time that same blood is what
[39:53] carries away all of the different
[39:55] metallic wastes and things that are
[39:57] within the cells and it moves through
[39:59] the body and within the body as we
[40:01] looked at that that there is a an actual
[40:03] part there even in the body called the
[40:05] spleen that will actually take care of
[40:07] all of the damaged blood cells it'll
[40:10] repair those and break them down and
[40:12] recycle them and and at the same time
[40:14] it'll also bring a cleansing to that to
[40:17] that stream of flowing of blood as well
[40:19] so it's all working to get
[40:21] they're in a great harmony and I'm
[40:22] thankful to the Lord for that and if
[40:24] that in itself we see that it's just in
[40:27] the natural as we can see God would
[40:28] inspire Paul to take that as an example
[40:31] of how that we are to be as a body of
[40:34] believers and truly that's how the body
[40:36] of Jesus Christ is it's it we're not not
[40:39] one of us is the heart within ourselves
[40:41] but we are identified and positioned in
[40:44] that body and it's Christ who is the
[40:46] heart of God he's the heart of the body
[40:49] it's him that that it's his life that is
[40:51] pulsating through the Church of the
[40:53] Living God
[40:54] it's his life that makes sure that you
[40:57] and I it's him overseeing to see that we
[41:00] receive what we have need oven and also
[41:03] to move in our lives to to carry away
[41:06] all of those things that we don't need
[41:08] within our lives and what a what a
[41:10] privilege it is to be identified in
[41:12] Jesus Christ we find that how that you
[41:16] know the Prophet makes this statement
[41:17] and souls are in prison now I've I've
[41:19] always loved this quote but it just even
[41:22] became even more more precious to me as
[41:24] I've been studying this for weeks now he
[41:26] says it's not speaking in tongues and
[41:28] he's talking about evidences and he says
[41:30] it's not speaking in tongues it's it's
[41:32] not by dancing in the spirit it's not by
[41:35] joining a church it's not by fruit of
[41:37] the Spirit Christians science
[41:39] consequence can outsmart anyone that and
[41:42] and even and deny even Jesus Christ was
[41:45] divine it's not bad but it's the word
[41:48] living there it is if they have only
[41:51] looked he was Messiah he was the Living
[41:55] Word made manifest now they were looking
[41:58] at him remember they they did see him
[42:01] as far as where he was at with in his
[42:03] physical manifestation they saw that but
[42:06] yet they really weren't looking at what
[42:09] they needed to be looking at because
[42:11] where they had drifted from was the word
[42:14] and that's why the very manifestation of
[42:17] the word is not something that's apart
[42:19] from the scriptures but a true
[42:21] manifestation of the word will always be
[42:24] properly identified in the word because
[42:26] that's the real comfort of a believer
[42:28] you know we can have signs we can have
[42:30] wonders and I believe that signs and
[42:32] wonders are given to the Church of the
[42:34] Living
[42:34] and let me just say it like this I
[42:36] believe that we need them God knows
[42:39] exactly what we need in order to spur
[42:41] and stimulate our faith you think how
[42:44] many times where the Prophet would say
[42:46] now if he will show me something about
[42:48] your life will that help you to believe
[42:50] and we need that we need the testimonies
[42:53] we need to see God moving and coming in
[42:56] confirming his word and that just does
[42:59] something to our hearts as a believer
[43:00] maybe when a a life is surrendered to
[43:02] the Lord or you take where God has moved
[43:05] on the scene and he's brought healing
[43:06] and a life and to think how that we have
[43:08] been out of that maybe that that been
[43:10] offered up in prayer right across here
[43:12] or maybe in prayer closet but
[43:14] nonetheless we know that it's taken God
[43:16] to do it and and that's that's worth
[43:18] rejoicing about with we don't ever want
[43:20] to let that become common because that's
[43:22] God coming by our way and just letting
[43:25] you and I know that I'm still the same
[43:27] I'm still interested in all you might
[43:30] say whatis I know I've been filled with
[43:31] the Holy Ghost for years now but yet the
[43:34] Prophet would even say at the end of
[43:35] third Exodus Lord will you come by our
[43:38] way every now and then again and confirm
[43:41] your word and and make a sign in
[43:43] Denton's bring healing and do something
[43:46] Lord that'll stir our faith you see the
[43:48] real stirring of our faith
[43:50] it doesn't stir us to a personality it
[43:52] doesn't stir us to a church the real
[43:54] stirring of our faith it stirs us to
[43:57] Jesus Christ that's he's the love of our
[43:59] life he's the object of our life he's
[44:01] the one that we want to give ourselves
[44:02] to so when they were looking here at him
[44:05] they looked at him and they called him
[44:07] Beelzebub they said he had a devil day
[44:09] then this is where they were at but
[44:11] Jesus said search the Scriptures for in
[44:14] them you think you have eternal life but
[44:17] they are they which testify of me what
[44:20] he was letting him know is what was
[44:22] written and this is what he said
[44:23] concerning Moses he said you don't even
[44:26] believe Moses riding I tell you those
[44:29] were some really power packed words
[44:31] you're talking to people who knew Moses
[44:35] message and yet he could stand there and
[44:37] say you don't believe it
[44:39] nah they could quote it and somehow it
[44:43] seemed as though that they were living
[44:45] by it but yeah
[44:47] when the word was made manifest of what
[44:49] the heart of it was they rejected it and
[44:52] he told him he said if you believed his
[44:55] writings you would believe my words
[44:58] because you see the writings themselves
[45:01] with when people say I don't want
[45:03] Commandments no more hey when the word
[45:05] is revealed within that word is sealed
[45:08] up the life it's sealed up the nature
[45:10] it's sealed up the very thought behind
[45:12] that word and when that word itself is
[45:15] fully opened and revealed what comes out
[45:18] of there is the very direction and
[45:21] leadership of commandments of the Lord
[45:23] our made manifest that's why Paul could
[45:25] say let whosoever if faker's himself and
[45:29] seemeth to be spiritual a prophet or
[45:31] whatever more let him acknowledge that
[45:34] those things that I have written they
[45:36] are the commandments of the Lord so he
[45:39] had a message that message that was not
[45:42] a different message but what was laying
[45:44] down there in the Old Testament that had
[45:46] been laying there but now it comes forth
[45:49] the season for that which is laid bare
[45:51] and been sealed up it's time for that to
[45:54] be made known and when it's made known
[45:56] it's never contrary to the word that's
[45:59] already written it only lets that word
[46:01] that's been written that people have
[46:03] been tied to and identified with it
[46:05] brings it alive and it issues the very
[46:08] pulsation of God and they become a real
[46:11] true reflection as God interprets his
[46:14] word through their life this is a real
[46:16] reality it's the word living you see
[46:19] there's a lot of when when we look at it
[46:21] there's a lot of demonstrations but you
[46:23] see this is where the Prophet tells us
[46:25] in Satan's Eden he said it's not so much
[46:28] don't watch it so much in demonstration
[46:30] because you see brother Branham he's
[46:32] answering a question there in Satan's
[46:34] Eden because you know when I look at
[46:36] this quote I looked at it over the years
[46:38] I thought how could anybody say that
[46:40] brother Branham won preaching the holy
[46:41] ghost but brother this got back to
[46:44] brother Branham that there been people
[46:45] saying he won preaching the holy ghost
[46:47] and brother Brent said here's what it is
[46:49] he said it is the very person of Christ
[46:53] in you he said to watch it so much in
[46:56] demonstration but watch it
[46:58] the action of the word you see
[47:02] demonstrations can be things of like
[47:04] little things to say well here and this
[47:07] is this is it this is a proofing and yet
[47:09] we need demonstration is that right Paul
[47:12] said in his word he said that our gospel
[47:14] came not unto you in word only but with
[47:16] power and demonstration so there's a
[47:20] need that did that demonstration well
[47:22] the word is coming forth is to make the
[47:24] people aware that the presence of the
[47:26] Living God is there and our God is
[47:29] coming to confirm his word it ought to
[47:31] be something we're looking at it within
[47:33] the word when God sent Moses down there
[47:35] to Egypt he never came with a message
[47:37] that was greater than the promise but it
[47:40] was the very promise that was given made
[47:42] manifest that's why as believers I
[47:46] believe in this hour we are you know
[47:48] maybe not too many of us have been have
[47:50] seen a lot of things where we speak of
[47:52] the the false anointed ones and so forth
[47:54] but I believe we're living in an hour I
[47:56] believe we have been I believe we're
[47:57] living in an hour even right now where
[47:59] it behooves us has the bride of Jesus
[48:02] Christ to try every spirit we're living
[48:06] in that time not to take anything for
[48:08] granted but try every spirit where is
[48:10] this spirit pointing me to hallelujah so
[48:15] in order to try that spirit you got to
[48:18] see what's the projection of the word
[48:19] that's being used now listen don't let
[48:21] down your guard just because we're
[48:23] quotes being read but neither does God
[48:26] wants you to sit here conservative I you
[48:28] understand what I'm talking about you
[48:30] just can't let down on them ever it has
[48:32] to be every spirit it must be tried
[48:35] where is it trying to point us to who is
[48:38] it trying to lift up there's only one
[48:39] great one among us only one and that's
[48:42] the Lord Jesus Christ there's no one
[48:45] equal there's only one it's the Lord
[48:48] Jesus Christ is that right he is the
[48:51] infallible one in our midst thank God
[48:55] for that so they looked he was Messiah
[49:00] he was the Living Word made manifest and
[49:04] notice the Prophet says and a man that's
[49:07] got the Spirit of God in him or a woman
[49:10] lives that word
[49:12] it lives right out in them that's the
[49:17] heartbeat the predestinated for the word
[49:20] of the Lord comes to them and they are
[49:24] the word to the people written epistles
[49:32] read of all men lives that in any other
[49:39] manner maybe don't even own a Bible
[49:43] maybe don't even read their Bible do you
[49:46] realize that your life listen friends
[49:48] the Prophet says it like this he says
[49:50] God because he said the people get away
[49:53] from prayer people get a railway from
[49:55] reading their Bible he said people get
[49:57] into such a condition and when that
[49:58] happens he said God sends a prophet on
[50:01] the scene to do what he has a sign and
[50:04] he brings it on down he says and that
[50:05] prophet in this hour is the Holy Ghost
[50:08] oh ma you see that's why the Prophet the
[50:11] Holy Ghost he never went off the scene
[50:13] as far as the gift and that what God
[50:16] ordained for this hour but remember as a
[50:18] bride of Jesus Christ we are we are
[50:21] ordained as a prophetic class of people
[50:24] the elect or a prophetic class of people
[50:27] we're not prophets but we are ordained
[50:29] to be able to receive that word not by
[50:33] our abilities but it is God himself God
[50:38] has ordained to it that that word would
[50:40] come and illuminate earth it has meaning
[50:43] to our life it is something in that that
[50:47] reaches down and it holds within it what
[50:49] what is really true and we begin to find
[50:52] the mystery of our life beginning to
[50:54] unfold it's a heartbeat it's the
[50:58] heartbeat and the word of the Lord so
[51:01] now when that life that has been the
[51:03] born of the Spirit of God you know you
[51:06] couldn't live you just can't live with
[51:08] demonstration it's got to be a heartbeat
[51:11] you can't live by you know needing to
[51:14] have what we need to have a
[51:14] defibrillator we need to have a
[51:16] defibrillator we need to have you know
[51:17] what God don't want you to have a
[51:18] defibrillator experience come on
[51:21] somebody well we got to keep a
[51:23] defibrillator here at church cuz we got
[51:24] a
[51:25] every once in a while no God God's God
[51:28] has it all supplied that you don't need
[51:31] to live a defibrilator life he's got it
[51:33] supplied that he himself stepping on the
[51:36] inside of you he pulsates his life
[51:38] through you you might get discouraged
[51:43] but greater is He that is in you you
[51:46] might get down but greater is He that is
[51:49] in you it doesn't matter where you're at
[51:53] on the mountain or in the valley
[51:55] he's still the center of your life
[51:58] that's a life it doesn't matter if
[52:02] you're in church or not it's not a it's
[52:04] about a life where your life is there
[52:07] reflecting Jesus Christ you're a
[52:09] reflection of Christ on your job your
[52:11] reflection of Christ in your home you're
[52:14] a reflection on you in your neighborhood
[52:16] you are a reflection of Jesus Christ
[52:18] just such a place that God's design I
[52:20] believe that ought to be the prayer of
[52:22] our heart Lord God let my life be so
[52:24] United with you to where others like
[52:27] they did for Peter
[52:28] they took knowledge they had been with
[52:30] Jesus there was something about them
[52:32] they knew that they had been with Jesus
[52:34] he wasn't because that they could talk
[52:35] Galilee and talk it wasn't because of
[52:37] that but they had been there in the
[52:39] upper room and that image had been
[52:41] pressed upon their heart it had released
[52:44] that seed that was there it came into
[52:46] divine expression and here they were
[52:48] living out the prophecy in that hour
[52:51] that was a living image of Almighty God
[52:54] he's still the same yesterday today and
[52:56] forever in all essence he's still the
[53:00] same the courage the scriptures are
[53:06] clear there's nothing new Under the Sun
[53:09] there may not be words in the Bible
[53:12] about Facebook but there ain't nothing
[53:13] new Under the Sun because when we come
[53:18] back to is is we look at where
[53:20] inspiration sources are coming from is
[53:23] that right it's like right now and I'm
[53:26] not here on a political stump or
[53:28] anything like that because I don't
[53:29] really pay attention to love that stuff
[53:30] but you know it's just like over the
[53:32] over the time or whatever more now I
[53:34] don't want to offend nobody but you know
[53:36] everybody keeps on talking about
[53:37] well gun control
[53:38] this and gun-control that and going but
[53:40] they fail to look at what's inspiring
[53:42] this cuz when you get to look at their
[53:46] inspiration it's gonna take you clear
[53:49] back to the departure from Christ where
[53:53] all these other influence just start
[53:55] coming in and all these other things and
[53:57] you notice a well people you know
[53:58] they're not maybe mentally right now
[54:00] that I can see that I understand that I
[54:03] know that there are things that mentally
[54:05] is not right but I also look at that
[54:07] where the scripture said concerning the
[54:09] days of Noah that they their Bible said
[54:12] that the earth was filled with violence
[54:14] through them somebody's got to be a
[54:17] channel for that demonic inspiration to
[54:21] flow but of their channels for demonic
[54:24] inspiration to flow they gotta be a
[54:27] channel on earth for heavenly
[54:30] inspiration to flow
[54:32] amen I believe tonight I believe right
[54:34] here that I'm part of that I believe
[54:36] we're part of that channels where heaven
[54:38] can actually begin to express itself and
[54:41] that's our parent that I will be done in
[54:44] earth even as it is in heaven
[54:48] you see you look and you found you look
[54:51] and you say well where does this
[54:53] inspiration come from you know for all
[54:55] these creatures looking like this and
[54:56] this and then I told you you know years
[54:58] ago that when the Lord first got ahold
[55:00] my life I was looking at something in a
[55:02] store and I backed up and I backed over
[55:04] on on something you know what I'm trying
[55:06] to get a perspective on something and I
[55:07] ended up backing into one of those um I
[55:09] didn't know at the time but it was when
[55:12] I turned around with on the Star Wars
[55:13] displays and it's such a hideous thing
[55:15] how about jumped out of my skin I really
[55:19] did because I was not expecting that at
[55:21] all but the first thing that hit my mind
[55:22] is where did that inspiration come from
[55:24] where who looks like that
[55:28] I've better never see something like
[55:30] that in the woods
[55:33] and the bow and more than gun and
[55:35] everything else whether that inspiration
[55:39] come from its inspiration when those
[55:42] images are coming on earth if that's
[55:46] happening then there is also channels
[55:49] were the image of Christ is coming upon
[55:52] the earth hallelujah
[55:55] there's another kingdom moving in
[55:58] there's not something way out in the
[56:01] future remember this ministry that God
[56:03] this evening light this message and when
[56:06] we're standing at the very end of time
[56:09] within these things remember it's that
[56:11] ministry that catches the stone as the
[56:15] stone begins to fall it's a ministry
[56:17] what does that ministry do it alerts us
[56:19] to the time to the season to where you
[56:22] and I are living at and where has that
[56:23] stone struck oh it's moved right down
[56:26] and it has broken the very hole of
[56:29] organizational ISM and all enzymes
[56:31] inside the hearts of the bride of Jesus
[56:34] Christ amen a stone that ministry has
[56:37] caught that stone as it's coming out all
[56:39] is not a stone that has been hewed out
[56:42] by the hands or the isms of man but it
[56:44] is a stone that God had provided to
[56:47] absolutely eradicate the very whole of
[56:50] all the things of this world upon your
[56:53] life what do you say
[56:54] it's a rapturing stone it's a rapturing
[56:57] grave it's the capstone of his mercy
[57:05] inspiration it's a heartbeat you know
[57:15] here we find that the Pharisees
[57:20] different ones remember you couldn't put
[57:24] the prophet tells us like this a finger
[57:27] on their life not a finger not a finger
[57:32] you couldn't put one finger on their
[57:35] life but we understand what was beneath
[57:37] the surface was uncovered I said that's
[57:41] a different thing
[57:43] and the word it comes to reveal what's
[57:46] beneath the surface when we look at that
[57:50] and say not a finger on their life we
[57:51] could look at that and say well that
[57:54] wouldn't what aren't they living
[57:55] according to the word yes and no they're
[57:59] living according to the writing or to
[58:01] the print of the word but you see it's
[58:05] really not the word itself being
[58:06] expressed in their life because they're
[58:09] not living by the life that is released
[58:12] in that moment to live according to that
[58:14] word because even when a promise is
[58:17] preparing to be fulfilled God releases
[58:21] the life to catch the people identified
[58:24] in that promise and it's also released
[58:26] to make them ready for when that promise
[58:29] and the season is matured and the people
[58:31] are made ready by that promise so it's
[58:33] not a fulfillment of a promise and then
[58:35] and then it's just let go
[58:36] but everything itself is maturing that's
[58:39] the same way with the promise of the
[58:41] rapture it's not we're just sitting here
[58:43] and waiting around remember the Prophet
[58:45] tells us she the bride will be waiting
[58:48] on that revelation of the rapture
[58:50] it's a quickening quickening quickening
[58:53] quickening it's continually it's gone
[58:55] unfolding and revealing when you and I
[58:57] have need of the rapture might happen
[59:00] tomorrow it might happen in the next
[59:02] hour but God's going to provide what we
[59:04] have need of in order to be ready for
[59:06] that moment that's the promise he's made
[59:09] to himself once you just to hold that in
[59:15] your heart here we find in the scripture
[59:21] my I go back to this scripture here
[59:25] where the Bible speaks of when the Lord
[59:28] Jesus himself when he when he came in
[59:30] this time here they were in Psalm 69
[59:35] verse 22 if I can read this just for a
[59:37] moment Paul refers to this as well in
[59:42] the book of Romans let their table
[59:47] become a snare before them I want you to
[59:51] notice this carefully God is quick quick
[59:55] to distance himself
[59:57] from even things which he has given when
[1:00:00] it no longer resembles his purpose when
[1:00:05] he spoken in the book of Isaiah what did
[1:00:07] he say in Isaiah he says I don't want no
[1:00:11] more of your feast yet these are the
[1:00:14] feasts of the Lord but they no longer
[1:00:17] resembled what he had given maybe
[1:00:22] perhaps my letter but not with substance
[1:00:25] it had become we know as the Prophet
[1:00:28] tells us it had become just a formality
[1:00:30] it becomes something that we're just
[1:00:32] doing and you know friends I'm just
[1:00:34] going to say it like this it's easy for
[1:00:37] things just to become formality it's
[1:00:41] easy this is this is a battle things
[1:00:44] it's easy for things to become common
[1:00:46] I'm talking about even in the incoming
[1:00:48] to the house of God let alone an hour
[1:00:50] let alone in our lives it's easy for
[1:00:53] things to become common and we begin to
[1:00:55] take things for granted instead of
[1:00:57] coming with expectation we come just you
[1:01:00] know and our expectation is really just
[1:01:02] well you know here we are and I'm sure
[1:01:04] this probably gonna happen or this but
[1:01:06] you see when there's a an expectation I
[1:01:08] believe that's what God wants us to have
[1:01:10] when we have an expectation God Himself
[1:01:13] moves according to that expectation to
[1:01:16] where that we're standing in the sound
[1:01:17] what you think of it the spirit of this
[1:01:19] age says I don't have need of nothing
[1:01:21] I'm spiritually rich it sits where that
[1:01:25] church itself is no more than formality
[1:01:28] that's all it is it's not something that
[1:01:30] we're that it's a life or an expression
[1:01:33] it's something that is just about creeds
[1:01:35] and ideas and isms but yet within it
[1:01:38] this is where you and I have to be
[1:01:40] careful that the spirit of that age we
[1:01:43] have to be able to say Lord discern my
[1:01:45] heart that there not be subtle invasions
[1:01:49] that would somehow lead me from the
[1:01:51] purpose of which you've told me to we
[1:01:54] need his help on that bus and I know
[1:01:58] some it doesn't matter how much you know
[1:01:59] the message we need his help
[1:02:04] we need the leadership of the Holy
[1:02:07] Spirit that he can take things that are
[1:02:09] rip in there and bring it to light to
[1:02:12] you and I and when he brings it to light
[1:02:13] what it actually does light exposes
[1:02:16] darkness it presses back the darkness
[1:02:18] any darkness that is trying to overtake
[1:02:21] your life in your heart in your home the
[1:02:24] light will press that back
[1:02:26] that's why David's testimony and there's
[1:02:28] a reflection of where we stand as the
[1:02:30] bride the Lord is my light he is my
[1:02:36] salvation he is the strength of my life
[1:02:42] so we are victorious because of his
[1:02:46] victory living through us but his
[1:02:51] victory living through us that in itself
[1:02:53] is a victory in us because it's his
[1:02:56] victory having victory in us it's his
[1:03:00] life
[1:03:01] being able to move in not by force but
[1:03:04] by love subdue us to where he can come
[1:03:07] to the forefront Oh glory be to God you
[1:03:10] love him this morning
[1:03:11] this is our desire so here you find this
[1:03:15] their table let their table become a
[1:03:19] snare before them so there was a
[1:03:21] difference between their table
[1:03:23] and God's table a prepared table is a
[1:03:28] table that is set forth in preparation
[1:03:32] for the fulfillment of God's Word the
[1:03:36] prophets themselves moved by the Holy
[1:03:39] Ghost they were moved by divine unction
[1:03:42] there was a table that was actually
[1:03:45] prepared within every time every season
[1:03:49] every age you know down through the Old
[1:03:51] Testament and every time that table it
[1:03:54] staff I'm going to tell you who was
[1:03:55] still the centerpiece of it all
[1:03:57] Christ it wasn't a different centerpiece
[1:04:00] they had there it was the same
[1:04:02] centerpiece every prophecy all the
[1:04:05] prophets all the Psalms everything was
[1:04:07] pointing to him though the people in
[1:04:13] that time they didn't see all of that
[1:04:16] but you see the life of that promise
[1:04:18] they were identified in the opening and
[1:04:23] the
[1:04:23] morning two of the fulfillment and
[1:04:25] promise of the Messiah that was to come
[1:04:28] God released what was needed out of that
[1:04:31] promise to print to bring to pass over
[1:04:33] Commerce in that day it's just like when
[1:04:36] we look at God restoring his word here
[1:04:39] in this endtime in this hour God
[1:04:41] released so much of the promise of the
[1:04:44] complete birth and he released so much
[1:04:46] in the days of Luther and what did it do
[1:04:48] the people who came under that word the
[1:04:51] life itself brought the people in
[1:04:53] preparation for a further fulfillment of
[1:04:55] the promise how did it do that by
[1:04:58] releasing the promise of life that was
[1:05:00] needed at that time that's why we must
[1:05:03] come through every step of the word you
[1:05:07] can't bypass one part of the word it
[1:05:11] must come word by word he said upon this
[1:05:14] rock I will build my church
[1:05:18] hallelujah so we're talking about a
[1:05:21] table here because when we look at this
[1:05:23] here there's a table of ideas and those
[1:05:26] ideas lead the tribulation but then
[1:05:30] there's also at the same time there's a
[1:05:33] table where in a where divine revelation
[1:05:36] the unction of the Holy Spirit the
[1:05:38] Spirit of God being poured out upon that
[1:05:40] word and that word living and the people
[1:05:42] of God beginning to move into that place
[1:05:45] within the word of a real union with
[1:05:48] Almighty God there is a table of divine
[1:05:50] revelation where people are no longer
[1:05:52] living their own lives
[1:05:56] glory it's it's tables that are better
[1:06:00] set forth one table right now is a table
[1:06:04] that's preparing people for gentlemen
[1:06:08] but there's another table where judgment
[1:06:11] is right now where we're being judged by
[1:06:15] the word where the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:17] searching out our lives what's he doing
[1:06:21] he's separating he's drawing us unto
[1:06:24] himself this is where the scripture said
[1:06:27] and that look what and that which should
[1:06:30] have been for their welfare let it
[1:06:33] become a trap
[1:06:37] remember as we were looking at a few
[1:06:39] weeks ago Israel God stated that right
[1:06:43] through Paul Israel had the advantage in
[1:06:47] best Paul said chiefly in every way the
[1:06:51] covenants were to them the promises were
[1:06:54] to them all of these things were written
[1:06:55] out but yet hidden within the old there
[1:06:59] was the new hidden within the Old
[1:07:01] Testament there was a bride amen and
[1:07:05] that's why Paul Paul's ministry the
[1:07:08] Spirit of God bringing that unction it
[1:07:10] would reach back in there and now begin
[1:07:13] to make make manifest and known those
[1:07:16] promises that concerned you and I but
[1:07:19] even though here we were hidden but God
[1:07:22] has now revealed his purpose and we
[1:07:25] understand that he's only turned away
[1:07:27] from the Jews his brethren for just a
[1:07:30] period of time but he's done that he was
[1:07:32] put in exile because they were envious
[1:07:35] of him but all of that was in the plan
[1:07:37] and program so that he might bring forth
[1:07:40] his Gentile bride what love what love
[1:07:47] you might feel like today no sender I've
[1:07:49] got a need in my life mentally I can't
[1:07:52] even think of a promise that fits that
[1:07:57] but let me tell you something whether
[1:07:59] you can think of a promise that fits to
[1:08:01] that know that what your need is God has
[1:08:04] already provided whether you can
[1:08:07] remember or have knowledge of that
[1:08:09] certain promise that maybe would would
[1:08:11] fit your need but yet God himself has
[1:08:14] already provided and he is the
[1:08:16] sufficiency of all that you have need of
[1:08:18] there might be things to where you say
[1:08:21] it's a new disease but he already got it
[1:08:23] covered
[1:08:23] I'm the Lord that healeth all thy
[1:08:25] diseases as I write this table you see
[1:08:32] this table what should have been a a
[1:08:34] welfare what should have been a place to
[1:08:38] wear that they would have been
[1:08:39] comforting and brought them into
[1:08:41] expectation like it did for Simeon and
[1:08:44] Anna and all the remnant that was living
[1:08:46] there that's the way it should have been
[1:08:48] but yet it wasn't because they're eating
[1:08:52] was not an eating of faith this was an
[1:08:56] eating of works works when even the
[1:09:04] sacrifices themselves became works so
[1:09:08] how could it not be how could it be
[1:09:10] faith and not works they still had to
[1:09:13] bring the lamb or they had to bring this
[1:09:14] offering but it's the heart it's the
[1:09:18] heart
[1:09:19] is it just works that well this is what
[1:09:21] God expects and this is what God
[1:09:22] requires us this time of the year and
[1:09:24] this is it just works are we doing it
[1:09:27] don't well if I do this and you know I
[1:09:28] believe if I start doing this I I
[1:09:30] believe God will have more favour on me
[1:09:31] I believe it can be works
[1:09:34] you see there's things that yes that we
[1:09:37] want to have prevail in our life you
[1:09:41] might want to have in your life and say
[1:09:43] you know I want a deeper I want a deeper
[1:09:45] experience I want uh you know I want I
[1:09:47] want more of God I want to give more of
[1:09:49] myself to the Lord at first listen
[1:09:52] friends it's gonna require something out
[1:09:54] of you but where it's a dying time to
[1:09:56] where that it's you giving way it's you
[1:09:59] redeeming the time but as you continue
[1:10:02] to go it's no longer it's not something
[1:10:05] that you just see is right and you're
[1:10:07] just giving yourself to but now it
[1:10:09] begins to move within your life and you
[1:10:11] find the pulsation you find out God it's
[1:10:14] just from just on giving you the
[1:10:15] strength to be able to nourish me
[1:10:18] because what it is you find listen when
[1:10:20] you find something that's good you find
[1:10:22] something that gives you nourishment you
[1:10:23] find something that tastes good
[1:10:25] tell me you don't want it again you can
[1:10:31] look at a lot of us and know we eat a
[1:10:32] lot of things but their table have
[1:10:36] become a snare what they were teaching
[1:10:39] was not building the people up in faith
[1:10:45] see in faith faith creates an
[1:10:49] expectation the Ministry of the word
[1:10:53] it ought to create an expectation in our
[1:10:55] lives sometimes we you may leave and you
[1:10:59] might you see well I don't feel
[1:11:01] any different it's not about how you
[1:11:02] feel the Word of God coming forth and us
[1:11:06] receiving that word that word has the
[1:11:09] power to bring about the transformation
[1:11:12] that is needed but everything that they
[1:11:18] did we see this
[1:11:19] they placed the veil it became a trap
[1:11:22] everything because everything was by
[1:11:25] works but they had also started to
[1:11:28] create and it had been down through time
[1:11:31] traditions you know years ago I remember
[1:11:36] when I was looking at this on traditions
[1:11:39] there the Russians pick it up and it's
[1:11:41] like where you get a group of kids in a
[1:11:42] circle and I tell you brother
[1:11:45] Enoch so then you take what I said and
[1:11:48] you tell brother Brian brother Brian
[1:11:49] takes what he says he tells brother Dave
[1:11:51] but the day takes what he says he tells
[1:11:53] brother his suits but they soothe it so
[1:11:57] it's it's not direct it's not direct it
[1:12:02] starts coming through and there's bits
[1:12:04] and pieces and there's certain things
[1:12:05] and maybe Enoch feels like if I had this
[1:12:07] little further glorified or if now this
[1:12:09] really in a major point but time it gets
[1:12:11] to Brian by the time it gets back around
[1:12:13] to the original person it's entirely
[1:12:17] different story it was no longer this
[1:12:20] kind of a man and he had this honor and
[1:12:22] whatever more the by the time it gets
[1:12:23] back they've got somebody who was a kid
[1:12:25] or maybe a woman or whatever more what
[1:12:27] is that that's the breakdown of the
[1:12:30] human mind trying to tell things I don't
[1:12:34] have a problem with recall but let me
[1:12:36] just say this that's why if that our
[1:12:38] gospel is not a recall it takes the
[1:12:42] presence of Almighty God the living Lord
[1:12:45] Jesus Christ coming down in every
[1:12:48] generation to every believer personally
[1:12:51] but you don't know something second
[1:12:53] handedly you know it by firsthand
[1:12:56] experience that he is alive and well
[1:12:59] what he was back there
[1:13:01] he still is the same he's not changed in
[1:13:03] essent or nature berries nobody can take
[1:13:06] that away from you
[1:13:07] as a rock in which you are resting upon
[1:13:11] it becomes the pulsation and the life
[1:13:15] that lives for you and you live by that
[1:13:18] and no matter what Satan tries to say
[1:13:20] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[1:13:24] that revelation because that's a
[1:13:27] revelation that God Himself came down
[1:13:30] personally personally and when he comes
[1:13:35] personally that lets you know who you
[1:13:37] are
[1:13:40] you're no longer taking somebody else's
[1:13:43] word for it but you're following this as
[1:13:48] an overcomer you're not part of a
[1:13:51] movement but the movers in you
[1:13:55] hallelujah yes sir
[1:14:02] tables make a difference you know the
[1:14:12] Bible said that they sought this
[1:14:15] righteousness by their own works and not
[1:14:18] by faith but that one everybody that one
[1:14:22] everybody David throughout the Psalms
[1:14:25] would say you're the God of my
[1:14:27] righteousness my righteousness is come
[1:14:33] from you lord
[1:14:36] David caride of that same righteousness
[1:14:39] that was made known and reveal to
[1:14:41] Abraham but you see there begin to come
[1:14:46] recipe variations you know some people
[1:14:52] just can't leave a recipe alone like you
[1:14:57] know my wife makes something a certain
[1:14:59] way when I'm in my house that's the way
[1:15:01] I want it
[1:15:03] please don't come and say sister Kim
[1:15:05] maybe you add a little bit of this don't
[1:15:06] do it brother Samuel notice it at the
[1:15:08] table I know I need to have better
[1:15:11] manners than to say hey what's wrong
[1:15:13] with this my wife you know she's
[1:15:16] covering it up
[1:15:19] you understand what I'm saying you have
[1:15:21] an expectation is that right you know
[1:15:25] you don't come here and expect Creed's
[1:15:27] to be served out you don't come here and
[1:15:31] expect anything less than the Living
[1:15:34] Word of God by his presence to move
[1:15:37] forth and speak to our lives we have
[1:15:44] need of him we need him to come and
[1:15:46] speak to us
[1:15:46] he knows the situations and conditions
[1:15:49] in our life and he manifests himself
[1:15:51] that he's still the same God I know
[1:15:57] people think sometimes I think people
[1:15:59] get to thinking that dog died God didn't
[1:16:01] die God still speaking not a new message
[1:16:08] but it is the message that was given and
[1:16:11] God is declaring that what was declared
[1:16:15] over this generation and God Himself is
[1:16:18] declaring to you and I personally glory
[1:16:25] be to God tradition free we don't need
[1:16:32] we don't need we don't need the message
[1:16:34] where we need to just lift it up and God
[1:16:36] already vindicated it the way we really
[1:16:40] lift up the real Word of God is our
[1:16:42] lives the Bible said I would been men
[1:16:45] everywhere we're lifting up holy hands
[1:16:47] is that right the Prophet tells us in
[1:16:51] Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[1:16:52] said hold up the hands of your pastor
[1:16:55] know right now what I was holding up
[1:16:59] it's the word we're not holding up a man
[1:17:01] come on friends we're not trying to
[1:17:03] introduce this generation to a man we're
[1:17:05] introducing to Jesus Christ he is now
[1:17:09] here in the fullness of his word
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:19] blow would be to God but man start
[1:17:25] tampering with recipes they're changing
[1:17:28] the food and just you know how it all is
[1:17:31] is well I like this flavor a little
[1:17:32] bitter I like this a little bitter I
[1:17:34] like they begin to drift its man's ideas
[1:17:39] friends we don't need man's ideas I
[1:17:42] don't want my ideas I want his I want
[1:17:47] his thoughts this scripture here I read
[1:17:55] that I read I referred to this to last
[1:17:56] time but drawn back here in numbers 4 7
[1:18:00] in the tabernacle there was a place in
[1:18:03] the tabernacle there's a table that was
[1:18:06] placed there in thee in the Holy not the
[1:18:10] holiest but the holy place it's called
[1:18:13] the table of shewbread they were to
[1:18:17] spread a cloth of blue and put their own
[1:18:19] dishes and spoons and bowls and what was
[1:18:23] needed and this shewbread this this word
[1:18:27] that's used is the word pan IAM which is
[1:18:31] his face his presence his person
[1:18:35] remember when moses was standing there
[1:18:38] in exodus 33 and then in Exodus 34 Moses
[1:18:43] asked to see him he said you no man can
[1:18:49] see my face
[1:18:50] it wasn't face time yet you who isn't me
[1:18:54] it wasn't face time yet face time was
[1:18:57] gonna come but he said as he begin to
[1:19:02] make himself known Moses said Lord don't
[1:19:08] carry us up any further if your presence
[1:19:11] is not going with us now we understand
[1:19:16] what happened when it came that the ten
[1:19:19] spies came back over and said were not
[1:19:21] able to do it that all of a sudden that
[1:19:25] the people you know we understand the
[1:19:27] things that
[1:19:28] begin to take place in the camp but we
[1:19:30] read of how the next day that they took
[1:19:32] it upon themselves to try to move in and
[1:19:35] say well we're gonna go up and we're
[1:19:37] going we're gonna smite them right now
[1:19:38] but you see even though you can look at
[1:19:41] it and say man that seems like that
[1:19:43] would that's right on a promise of God
[1:19:44] but it wasn't in the time we see what
[1:19:47] time there was they rejected him who is
[1:19:51] the one that fights the battles it was
[1:19:55] not now it was him it was not their
[1:19:59] strength that would open with my battle
[1:20:01] but because they rejected the bread of
[1:20:05] his presence they went on their own
[1:20:07] strength and when they went on their own
[1:20:10] strength Moses told him don't go up
[1:20:14] because What did he say God's not with
[1:20:16] you it shows us that it is we we want to
[1:20:22] say God help me to be in a place to move
[1:20:25] when you're calling us to move you see
[1:20:29] what it is it's moving us away from what
[1:20:31] we want you see the word comes it
[1:20:33] doesn't come to make us comfortable but
[1:20:36] it comes to pull us beyond our comfort
[1:20:38] zone
[1:20:38] the real comfort zone is us it's us
[1:20:43] certain things that we like certain
[1:20:45] things we feel one but here God comes
[1:20:47] down and he deals with us to call us
[1:20:49] beyond our comfort zone I'm telling you
[1:20:52] every one of us we need to be called
[1:20:53] beyond our comfort zone every one of us
[1:20:58] the moment that we think we're fine
[1:21:01] you're too comfortable you're too
[1:21:04] comfortable God doesn't want the people
[1:21:07] of Zion settling down and where we're
[1:21:11] just looking you know no the reality
[1:21:13] there's a rest but it's a rest and
[1:21:15] expectation when that little woman would
[1:21:18] she knew that there was a promise of the
[1:21:21] owner the owner's son was going to come
[1:21:23] to the ranch
[1:21:23] she didn't set out she made ready she
[1:21:28] was up busying herself but it was she
[1:21:31] was not doing it by works but grace
[1:21:34] itself was expressed divine grace that
[1:21:38] had been given now her works were
[1:21:40] demonstrate
[1:21:41] appreciation for grace that had come our
[1:21:44] way she was washing she was cleaning up
[1:21:48] she was scrubbing down she was enduring
[1:21:50] all the persecution all the reproach why
[1:21:53] a promise that had been made she wasn't
[1:21:58] sitting around we're not in autopilot
[1:21:59] mode no sir you see all these watch how
[1:22:07] things are spoken when when the Prophet
[1:22:10] kids talk about the things or the
[1:22:11] stabilizers are put on the ship that
[1:22:13] doesn't mean that we all of a sudden
[1:22:14] kick back and cross our feet oh that's a
[1:22:16] praise the Lord it's just it's all it's
[1:22:19] yes that song it's already done it's
[1:22:21] already done the battle is over it's
[1:22:24] already done
[1:22:25] I agree with that but it doesn't mean
[1:22:29] for us to just kick back the bride has
[1:22:34] made herself ready moving moving this is
[1:22:42] why the Prophet could say listen friends
[1:22:44] the Prophet never looked at this message
[1:22:46] and said oh they can never denominated
[1:22:48] he never thought that way as a matter of
[1:22:50] fact he thought contrary he stood right
[1:22:52] in his own pulpit there in the Hebrew
[1:22:55] series and he said God oh who know it's
[1:22:57] hard to tell what kind of spirit will
[1:22:59] wind its way in bran of tabernacle some
[1:23:01] day that's what he said then he goes on
[1:23:06] to tell us in God's chosen place of
[1:23:08] worship they're dying Lamb of God may
[1:23:10] the people who follow this message never
[1:23:14] stand still for a denomination the key
[1:23:20] word is not denomination but key phrases
[1:23:23] stand still there's an element that we
[1:23:26] do need to stand still but then there's
[1:23:28] also a time where we've got to be moving
[1:23:30] we need to be standing still enough for
[1:23:33] the word to be able to address us and
[1:23:35] clothe us and work with our life but in
[1:23:37] order for that to be it's also going to
[1:23:39] take us surrendering our lives and
[1:23:41] letting God guide our hands into the
[1:23:42] sleeves I don't want to stand in steel
[1:23:49] Coast and and steel stagnation
[1:23:53] that's a sister we want this is a living
[1:23:58] water to us this is a fountain open in
[1:24:02] the house of David
[1:24:03] this is returning to the true atonement
[1:24:06] the real true cleansing the bread of his
[1:24:11] presence oh my notice how Jesus when he
[1:24:14] would refer to this the bread of his
[1:24:16] presence the bread of his face he said I
[1:24:18] am that true bread that my father has
[1:24:22] sent down from heaven he was the bread
[1:24:24] of the very presence of Almighty God
[1:24:27] want you to look at this how that David
[1:24:30] himself David was a feeder on the word
[1:24:34] you believe that David was not a quoter
[1:24:38] he was a feeder it was not a poster he
[1:24:43] was a feeder he was not a blogger he was
[1:24:46] a feeder hello somebody what's how David
[1:24:52] and it's just a few examples watch how
[1:24:53] David himself more to me design he's
[1:24:55] talking about the law more to be desired
[1:24:58] are they than gold yay they must find
[1:25:00] gold sweeter also than honey and the
[1:25:04] honeycomb my David he shouted about the
[1:25:10] law sometimes we come into service and
[1:25:15] it's just like
[1:25:20] listen friends I'm not here shaming
[1:25:22] anybody but I'm saying what what God has
[1:25:26] done for us understand that this it's
[1:25:31] what the enemy wants to take from you it
[1:25:36] ought to be your worship it ought to be
[1:25:40] our delight a man who is planted in the
[1:25:44] Lord the Bible says his delight is in
[1:25:48] the law of the Lord it is love does he
[1:25:52] meditate day and night meditation comes
[1:25:57] from what you're immersing yourself in
[1:26:00] what you're thinking on what you're
[1:26:03] dwelling on what you're meditating on
[1:26:05] comes from what you immerse him look
[1:26:13] what David says the Psalms 34 verse 8 o
[1:26:16] taste and see that the Lord is good I've
[1:26:22] never been something where you look at
[1:26:24] something you think some of you look and
[1:26:31] say I never met nothing I didn't want to
[1:26:33] eat every one time I was growing up I
[1:26:39] need to have this beef stroganoff oh I
[1:26:41] couldn't stand how that stuff looked but
[1:26:44] one day brother Dominic I tried it mmm
[1:26:47] one of them football banquets I had to
[1:26:49] be at who I tried it that was it that
[1:26:51] was it I said man the looks was hiding
[1:26:53] something awful good
[1:26:56] he'd become one of those comfort foods
[1:26:58] that you think about in this time of the
[1:27:00] year you know when it's cold that well
[1:27:01] we won't go on that but I tasted it but
[1:27:04] you see I had to first taste it I didn't
[1:27:06] get a big lot on my plate
[1:27:09] I put just a little bit but when I had
[1:27:12] that little bit I hate it oh that was it
[1:27:15] I was back up in line I found something
[1:27:19] that was good and when I found what was
[1:27:22] good I was no longer tasting it I became
[1:27:25] a feeder on it tasting it will never
[1:27:32] suffice tasting it you can say I like it
[1:27:37] now it needs a little bit more of this
[1:27:39] or a little more but when you just feel
[1:27:40] a taste of the Lord just taste of it but
[1:27:47] something do I got to know just taste of
[1:27:48] him
[1:27:49] what mother said I got this in my life
[1:27:51] just taste of him but said I need the
[1:27:56] Holy Ghost just taste of him just taste
[1:28:02] and then what see that the Lord is good
[1:28:13] what we have need of is in him Fred you
[1:28:19] can't get the Holy Ghost outside the
[1:28:21] word the Holy Ghost fallen there he on
[1:28:26] the day of Pentecost what did he come he
[1:28:28] came according to the season and
[1:28:30] fulfillment of the word he said I'll
[1:28:34] send the promise the father will send
[1:28:36] the promise of the Spirit in my name the
[1:28:42] right he preached the word and when he
[1:28:45] preached the word and brought conviction
[1:28:47] it drew them they work tasting of the
[1:28:49] Lord and as they would feed upon that
[1:28:53] word what were they doing what must we
[1:28:54] do what have been doing hey we tasted it
[1:28:57] what must we do
[1:28:58] so here Peter is he starts serving up
[1:29:00] the prophesies that's been fulfilled you
[1:29:03] see it's a table now what was once
[1:29:05] stored up what was once stored up was no
[1:29:11] longer just stored up cans and
[1:29:12] vegetables but now not Peter but the
[1:29:15] Spirit of God had made that promise an
[1:29:18] actual
[1:29:19] sustance for that moment and here's
[1:29:21] Peter serving it up he's serving it
[1:29:25] Peter didn't cook it Peter didn't make
[1:29:28] it all Peter did we'll serve it the
[1:29:36] understand what I'm talking about
[1:29:37] remember when there was some that
[1:29:39] actually had a problem with brother
[1:29:40] Neville serving food in the tabernacle
[1:29:44] wooziness spirit but what do one do it
[1:29:47] and say he what was he serving he was
[1:29:50] not the originator of it he was only
[1:29:53] preaching that message that God had
[1:29:57] already brought it wasn't on a cart it
[1:30:03] wasn't on machinery come on somebody
[1:30:05] these are not my words
[1:30:06] these are the words of the messenger is
[1:30:08] that right God does not use machinery
[1:30:14] that's not God's way that's not his
[1:30:16] pattern God uses the agency of man yes
[1:30:24] he does he still does that because this
[1:30:27] is an apostolic gospel it's the same
[1:30:31] gospel that was given in the beginning
[1:30:34] and he's still the same yesterday today
[1:30:37] and forever do we thank God for the
[1:30:39] tapes and books absolutely I immersed
[1:30:41] myself in it it's the message of the
[1:30:43] hour but it does not override the
[1:30:46] pattern of what was given the messenger
[1:30:48] himself being a true messenger held true
[1:30:50] to the true pattern glory be to God oh
[1:30:54] ma notice where David are going to say
[1:30:57] he said I will take the cup of salvation
[1:31:00] and call upon the name of the Lord how
[1:31:05] sweet are thy words unto my taste the
[1:31:12] rest of it was just machine it was just
[1:31:16] I do this we do that Moses said do this
[1:31:19] we do this we do that we do this not a
[1:31:21] finger then put a finger on their life
[1:31:24] but it was out without feeling there was
[1:31:29] no heart in it like Paul Raider when he
[1:31:35] walked out of the house remember that he
[1:31:37] walked out of the house and he got the
[1:31:38] thinking the brem says he got the
[1:31:40] thinking Paul Raider said my heart
[1:31:42] started beating bigger bigger bigger
[1:31:43] bigger bigger and I got the thinking you
[1:31:46] know my wife what a sheet there when I
[1:31:47] get back Lord what would happen to her
[1:31:50] so he runs back in throws open the door
[1:31:54] kisses her this time it ain't a pet it
[1:31:59] maybe had a little bit of butter he said
[1:32:05] what was the difference the second one
[1:32:06] had feeling in it the first one was
[1:32:09] formality the second one had feeling see
[1:32:14] God doesn't want our formality he wants
[1:32:17] feeling God's designed maybe the son
[1:32:20] little sing the same song twenty five
[1:32:23] minutes straight oh lord have mercy
[1:32:26] maybe he'll sing at twenty five minutes
[1:32:29] straight but you see it ain't about the
[1:32:31] song he might sing the slow song in the
[1:32:34] world are you with me it ain't about how
[1:32:38] fast the songs are sometimes songs gonna
[1:32:42] be so fast and people get worked right
[1:32:44] up in such a fast but then when the word
[1:32:47] comes for this you're missing it you're
[1:32:54] missing what that song was all about
[1:32:56] nothing wrong with fast songs nothing
[1:32:59] wrong with slow songs either you could
[1:33:01] sing it is well with my soul the power
[1:33:04] of God just moved right down we don't
[1:33:12] have to work nothing up all we have to
[1:33:14] do is surrender brother BAM till desist
[1:33:17] this over and over and over
[1:33:19] worship is spontaneous is that right it
[1:33:23] should be spontaneous
[1:33:25] he also said are you familiar with a
[1:33:27] quote he said give me one man one man
[1:33:31] surrendered to God God will do more with
[1:33:33] that one man in 10,000
[1:33:37] what if everybody says Lord when I'm
[1:33:39] coming into church today I am gonna be
[1:33:42] your surrendered vessel lord have mercy
[1:33:46] what will take place is that right oh
[1:33:54] mama may get a place here david said in
[1:33:58] psalms 23:5 i'm i'm getting ready to
[1:34:00] come down here we'll just find a place
[1:34:03] they'll prepare us a table before me in
[1:34:09] the presence of mine enemies
[1:34:14] now you and I both know if you're if an
[1:34:17] enemy's around you're not thinking about
[1:34:20] a picnic lunch like this you know I say
[1:34:31] Enoch you tell me what's over my back
[1:34:33] and I look behind you and so I'm doing
[1:34:36] like this

[1:34:48] shepherd my lord prepare us me he's got
[1:34:54] your name card right on this place this
[1:34:59] place has been reserved for you could
[1:35:05] only be to God and you received an
[1:35:09] invitation he's prepared this table in
[1:35:14] the presence of mine enemies
[1:35:17] oh well not only not only are we talking
[1:35:25] about Satan and all his aunt's but we're
[1:35:27] also talking about an enemy who's closer
[1:35:29] than that our own selves
[1:35:36] I'm feeding look think of this you and
[1:35:39] me are feeding on this word our souls
[1:35:44] are being benefited our spirits are
[1:35:46] being benefited and even our body our
[1:35:51] flesh because our flesh and our spirit
[1:35:53] is very quick to side with the enemy all
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:56] but it's benefiting from us feeding on
[1:36:00] the word as we're feeding on the
[1:36:03] promises I'm the Lord that healeth all
[1:36:05] thy diseases what's happening is we're
[1:36:07] taking that in as a son and daughter of
[1:36:09] God and we're believing that what is it
[1:36:11] doing it's putting an order into our
[1:36:13] life the pulsation of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:15] that's coming through that word his
[1:36:18] words are spirit in life what's it doing
[1:36:20] it's putting in order into our body our
[1:36:23] body is benefiting from this you believe
[1:36:29] that it's benefiting my mind benefits
[1:36:33] from it my spirit benefits from it
[1:36:37] sometimes where our spirit gets all
[1:36:39] gloomy and out of sorts come on friends
[1:36:42] message a perfect faith right at the
[1:36:45] beginning brother Graham says I get
[1:36:46] moody too I get them same kind of spells
[1:36:49] right what did they sell he tells us if
[1:36:51] we can look at it he says it's when I
[1:36:53] get overworked and he said when I get
[1:36:58] overworked he said then Satan comes
[1:36:59] telling me nobody loves you
[1:37:01] see nobody cares about you you see them
[1:37:03] people then people don't want nothing to
[1:37:04] do with you then people he said but then
[1:37:06] I look out and I see people who have
[1:37:08] drove from such a long ways away he said
[1:37:11] and I put it right back in his face you
[1:37:13] see you've got to take what God is
[1:37:16] putting right there
[1:37:17] it wasn't a chapter it wasn't a quote
[1:37:19] but he put forth what the enemy was
[1:37:21] trying to tell him nobody cares for him
[1:37:23] he put it right back and said they care
[1:37:26] about me they love this word
[1:37:30] you tell me expressions of love don't
[1:37:33] mean something you tell me expressions
[1:37:36] of win you have on your heart to call
[1:37:38] somebody or I'll stop by or send them a
[1:37:41] card or Cinematheque you tell me that
[1:37:43] don't mean something when God puts that
[1:37:45] aren't you on your heart that's one of
[1:37:46] the gifts working in the body you need
[1:37:49] to be obedient to that they'll prepare
[1:37:54] us a table before me in the presence of
[1:37:57] the enemies of mine enemies thou
[1:37:59] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:38:01] runneth over you see brother Branham he
[1:38:09] says this let me read this quote to you
[1:38:10] God hath provided way can I read this
[1:38:14] let me think you brought gonna read it
[1:38:16] anyhow but at least wants you to be open
[1:38:20] to it God hid in sundry times he wanted
[1:38:26] his children to have the best so he made
[1:38:28] the preparations he foreshadowed it
[1:38:31] through the prophets he revealed it in
[1:38:32] Christ and the table set today and every
[1:38:35] man and woman that's invited has a
[1:38:37] welcome to come to this table for he was
[1:38:40] wounded for our transgressions and with
[1:38:42] His stripes we were healed it's all
[1:38:45] foreseen it's provided and prepared the
[1:38:48] meals ready but Col is given he foresaw
[1:38:52] it he made preparations it's God's
[1:38:54] provided way for you when your souls are
[1:38:56] hungry your souls hungry you get a
[1:39:07] little soul brown or some soul food
[1:39:18] [Laughter]
[1:39:21] glory be to God and the only way you can
[1:39:23] have soul food you need fire we better
[1:39:27] go on a lady look said he said a lady
[1:39:31] said to me just this morning she said I
[1:39:33] walked into one of those meetings I seen
[1:39:35] the people so happy said I wasn't happy
[1:39:39] and then I looked at him and I said
[1:39:41] surely they had something I wished I had
[1:39:46] that but I wonder how people look at us
[1:39:59] the happy don't mean we're bubble
[1:40:01] dancing but there's a part of happy your
[1:40:05] countenance our countenance and there's
[1:40:10] an atmosphere listen friends the things
[1:40:12] that we think on and we feed on creates
[1:40:15] an atmosphere around us the Prophet gave
[1:40:19] those examples in spiritual food and due
[1:40:21] season he talks about in the
[1:40:22] supernatural where Elijah feeding on
[1:40:25] that word he said Elijah was living up
[1:40:27] in a different atmosphere he spoke about
[1:40:30] the prophets in spiritual food in due
[1:40:31] season he said how that they themselves
[1:40:33] so lived in that word wrap themselves in
[1:40:38] that word till they in the word became
[1:40:41] the same thing where they could speak
[1:40:43] things that was not according to their
[1:40:46] thinking and beyond their own
[1:40:47] understanding that's real Liberty what
[1:40:54] liberated Elijah what a liberator
[1:40:56] what Liberator Jonah what liberated your
[1:40:58] mind what liberated eyes a you say all
[1:41:00] go to Samuel they were special men but
[1:41:03] remember they still had to surrender and
[1:41:08] will come down on this point they still
[1:41:10] had to surrender God didn't just come
[1:41:14] down and forcibly take them over when
[1:41:17] the Prophet you remember how the Prophet
[1:41:19] stands a Jeff talks about the maniac of
[1:41:20] getting of Ganner are not in Oregon
[1:41:23] right read some parts of the message
[1:41:25] brother remember say I wasn't afraid
[1:41:26] read another parcel message brother
[1:41:28] himself was afraid but say no one man
[1:41:32] aren't you bothered by that the man was
[1:41:36] not infallible God is infallible he's
[1:41:40] been waiting but there's a part of him
[1:41:41] that wasn't fear and there's a part that
[1:41:43] wasn't inferior come on somebody there's
[1:41:47] a plaque that was afraid there's a part
[1:41:48] that wasn't afraid but the Prophet said
[1:41:51] he began to get thoughts concerning that
[1:41:53] man remember some star to size him up a
[1:41:57] gospel preacher starting to size him up
[1:42:02] see God didn't do it for him God didn't
[1:42:06] do it for him but he said I started
[1:42:09] thinking this poor man no doubt got his
[1:42:16] husband got home family he began to
[1:42:18] change his thoughts but Graham does say
[1:42:20] that he said I chose to think
[1:42:23] differently
[1:42:26] he ordered he ordered his thoughts
[1:42:28] around and what happened when he ordered
[1:42:31] his thoughts around then the Holy Spirit
[1:42:33] could step down and take on the
[1:42:35] challenge but God did not do it for the
[1:42:38] profit but the profit began to move into
[1:42:42] that place friends I wonder I wonder if
[1:42:47] some of the perplexing things about our
[1:42:49] life is not because his big is because
[1:42:52] then we don't choose to order our
[1:42:55] thoughts differently well we can say
[1:42:59] Lord let the meditation of my heart and
[1:43:01] the words of my mouth be acceptable in
[1:43:03] your sight the Friends of God came down
[1:43:07] and took control that situation see the
[1:43:11] presence of God look how sweet the Holy
[1:43:13] Spirit is he won't demand it of us that
[1:43:15] he comes to bring us into a place of
[1:43:18] surrender let me finish this this lady
[1:43:25] how she was saying you know I was these
[1:43:26] people are so happy brother man said
[1:43:29] sure the table was set for that poor
[1:43:31] hungry soul and before the service was
[1:43:34] over she was eating from the same table
[1:43:39] she tasted good whew this is good I need
[1:43:47] some oh she was eating no longer just
[1:43:51] tasting eating so our brother Graham can
[1:43:56] tell us hearing recognizing a new day
[1:43:57] and his message he said right there in
[1:43:59] your seats God can transform your life
[1:44:01] you can promise he said to turn over all
[1:44:04] kinds of leaves he said that when the
[1:44:05] fire of God will issue forth he said
[1:44:07] it'll bring a change right there it will
[1:44:09] not be a turning over of a new leaf but
[1:44:11] he will bring a change right there
[1:44:14] the word bringing a change glory be to
[1:44:19] God
[1:44:20] feeding ourselves right into the promise
[1:44:23] of God glory be to God hallelujah oh my
[1:44:29] a lady from the audience says brother
[1:44:32] Branham that was me that's that's it's
[1:44:35] right that same lady says and now I'm
[1:44:38] happy today
[1:44:40] when I read the next paragraph you'll
[1:44:42] know who he's talking about
[1:44:43] drunken wall-eyed drunk alcoholic to the
[1:44:47] limits the doctors had give her up here
[1:44:50] she is happy and rejoicing Rosella
[1:44:54] Griffith
[1:44:56] she ate while the word was coming forth
[1:44:59] she started eating on the word there
[1:45:06] would be no God and that's been about
[1:45:07] two years ago I guess three years ago
[1:45:09] and look it's still holding out Rosella
[1:45:14] Griffin just did not get an anointing on
[1:45:16] her flesh she just does not get a
[1:45:18] movement of a mana upon her spirit but
[1:45:20] that mana fell down into the holiest of
[1:45:23] holy and she became a feeder on the word
[1:45:27] you say what are you talking about you
[1:45:29] can't feed on anointing you feed on the
[1:45:32] word a man might be anointed and move
[1:45:36] all over the place but a man could stand
[1:45:38] right here
[1:45:39] and under the same anointing of the Holy
[1:45:41] Ghost and maybe wouldn't raise his voice
[1:45:43] at all but the word is coming forth and
[1:45:46] we're feeding on that word if you ever
[1:45:53] come to that table once and set your
[1:45:59] feet under it
[1:46:02] this ain't no cocktail party this ain't
[1:46:06] no meet-and-greet you ever come to this
[1:46:09] table you pull off the chair you sit
[1:46:12] down yeah this is my name on it
[1:46:17] I mean hallelujah that means I've got a
[1:46:23] place at the table I already have a
[1:46:25] portion for me I can begin to eat and
[1:46:30] feast on this word on Christ taking him
[1:46:36] into my life as a feeder as a feeder a
[1:46:44] feeder listen to me friends testimonies
[1:46:48] are wonderful but you've got to be a
[1:46:52] feeder on the word send me one brother
[1:46:57] Brandon went up here brother Ram did all
[1:46:58] that those are all wonderful those are
[1:46:59] things that God would allow you and I to
[1:47:01] know that he's still the same God and
[1:47:03] God wants to be that real to you and I
[1:47:06] but if all you know is the testimonies
[1:47:08] you're not a feeder you need to be a
[1:47:11] feeder because a feeder itself requires
[1:47:15] you to surrender and as you begin to
[1:47:18] feed what you're doing is you're taking
[1:47:20] in the nutrients of the word notice I
[1:47:25] mean I can explain super serpents II you
[1:47:27] might be able to do that but that don't
[1:47:29] mean you're a feeder
[1:47:30] I can explain baptism that don't mean
[1:47:32] you're a feeder you see this is not
[1:47:35] about doctrines and the accumulation of
[1:47:37] knowledge
[1:47:37] this is feeding on him it's his life
[1:47:42] taking his life within us this is what
[1:47:44] we read in the opening scripture to kind
[1:47:46] of set this groundwork here this morning
[1:47:48] it's feeding on his life on him jesus
[1:47:52] said except you eat the flesh of the son
[1:47:54] of man and drink his blood you have no
[1:47:57] life in you is there right this feeding
[1:48:01] it's like in the natural if you or me in
[1:48:05] the natural we stopped feeding what
[1:48:08] happens eventually our body starts
[1:48:10] turning on us that right things start
[1:48:13] actually taking place and they're
[1:48:14] setting in and are in our
[1:48:16] in our bodies and in our lives our
[1:48:17] immune system starts breaking down
[1:48:19] because our body even though you might
[1:48:21] eat that hamburger or that steak but the
[1:48:23] way that everything is broke down in the
[1:48:26] stomach and then from the stomach all of
[1:48:28] that how it's all process brought back
[1:48:30] in through the blood all of those things
[1:48:31] its nutrients that's in there
[1:48:33] my cells on my skin or on my head or
[1:48:35] wherever more or in my liver it's the
[1:48:38] same way it is with you they're not time
[1:48:40] thinking about hey Samuel I would like a
[1:48:42] hamburger today no its nutrients they're
[1:48:45] calling for nutrients sometimes you know
[1:48:48] how it is if you're forgettin and
[1:48:49] sometimes you know you forget to eat and
[1:48:51] and hours have gone by and you find
[1:48:53] yourself maybe you should go getting low
[1:48:54] in you you find things you don't happen
[1:48:55] to me you got a headache and you think
[1:48:57] oh my goodness I ain't even ate today or
[1:48:58] what am or what is it it's your body
[1:49:00] giving signs to let you know hey I need
[1:49:04] nourishment but you see I just can't
[1:49:07] take a hamburger and go boom right there
[1:49:09] into the heart know I've got to eat it
[1:49:11] first
[1:49:12] now when I eat it my beef sells out here
[1:49:15] are the cells in my legs or or whatever
[1:49:17] more they may not get the the experience
[1:49:20] right been in there but if I'm taking
[1:49:22] and I'm feeding on that I have a
[1:49:24] confidence in the process of those
[1:49:26] things that are put in the body it'll be
[1:49:28] able to break it down and get it to
[1:49:31] where it needs to go I'm glad that God
[1:49:33] is not lifted up to you and I had to say
[1:49:35] uh you you tell me where to put the word
[1:49:36] this morning Brian you tell me where to
[1:49:38] put the word this morning
[1:49:39] Shane you tell me where to put the word
[1:49:41] this morning Joey you tell me where to
[1:49:42] do that know what we have to do is
[1:49:44] surrender to Him he'll see to it that
[1:49:46] the word itself gets to the area of our
[1:49:50] life he'll address that area and then if
[1:49:52] we'll feed on that word and take that
[1:49:55] word into our life right within our life
[1:49:57] the very spiritual gastronomic of the
[1:50:00] Holy Ghost will begin to cook that lamb
[1:50:02] roast that lamb begin to break it down
[1:50:05] in our life to so much so to where it
[1:50:08] can actually make its way into the
[1:50:10] tiniest smallest cells and we can be
[1:50:13] benefited in our lives right now this
[1:50:18] morning right now this morning you can
[1:50:20] be benefiting right now this morning
[1:50:22] from maybe what more has been taking
[1:50:24] place from last week
[1:50:27] the word itself is just as you let it go
[1:50:30] throughout the week
[1:50:31] you're just meditating on it you're just
[1:50:33] thinking God for it but saying I don't
[1:50:35] feel nothing yet no we're not told my
[1:50:36] feeling anything we're talking about
[1:50:37] praising him when the word is went forth
[1:50:40] as a seed it's just like when I've eaten
[1:50:42] that hamburger or eating that grilled
[1:50:44] cheese I can begin to say thank you my
[1:50:47] cells can say it's on the way
[1:50:49] it's on the way I already know he's put
[1:50:52] it down there down his pipe it's coming
[1:50:54] it's on the way nutrients are coming you
[1:50:56] and I can begin to water with praise
[1:51:01] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:51:03] thank you for your word this morning
[1:51:05] thank you Lord God for your presence in
[1:51:07] my life you get up tomorrow tomorrow it
[1:51:10] might seem like all clouds are around
[1:51:11] you but you can say thank you lord why
[1:51:14] because your faith has not been placed
[1:51:16] in the enticing words of man's wisdom
[1:51:19] your faith is resting in the power of
[1:51:22] Almighty God and what God Himself is
[1:51:24] sowed into your heart and you've taken
[1:51:26] that innocent thank you lord
[1:51:28] God baby took one one scripture for
[1:51:32] scriptures maybe a part of a quote and
[1:51:34] God took that little lads lunch but out
[1:51:37] of that little lads lunch he multiplied
[1:51:38] it and brought it right down to this day
[1:51:41] right here February 25th 2018 and what
[1:51:43] does it become a light unto my feet my
[1:51:48] pathway is illuminated by his presence
[1:51:52] you see our feeding it affects
[1:51:56] everything in our life you find yourself
[1:52:00] where you find you'd seem like you don't
[1:52:01] have strength it seems like the
[1:52:03] temptations and things is getting hard
[1:52:04] check your feeding check what's your
[1:52:07] feeding check your feeding and your
[1:52:08] prayer life remember if you listen if
[1:52:10] you starve the white dog you're only
[1:52:11] feeding the black one you starve the
[1:52:15] white dog how do you start the white dog
[1:52:17] by feeding the black dog so the thing
[1:52:20] that you want to do is starve the black
[1:52:22] dog how do I starve the black dog my
[1:52:23] feeding the white dog it's very simple
[1:52:27] who you feed is who you say has
[1:52:28] dominance motive being a god so what is
[1:52:33] it our feeding it's our overcoming the
[1:52:36] Prophet said keep life
[1:52:39] in you taking that word in feeding on it
[1:52:45] let's have me there's a situation or
[1:52:47] there's something in my life
[1:52:49] feed on that word friends pray I got to
[1:52:53] looking at some of the things too this
[1:52:55] week had been staying on some things on
[1:52:56] wounds and things like that and I got to
[1:52:58] looking at different things and you know
[1:52:59] that even your diet when you've got a
[1:53:01] wound can affect the healing I got to
[1:53:04] looking at that I got to looking at how
[1:53:05] there's things are myths where people
[1:53:07] have always believed certain things
[1:53:08] about healing the wound and they were
[1:53:10] tell me you know you always pour it full
[1:53:11] of hydrogen peroxide man I hated that
[1:53:13] stuff when I was little I never want to
[1:53:15] get a cut but they start talking about
[1:53:16] how that those things actually harm the
[1:53:18] cells they said but there's a natural
[1:53:20] alkalinity that is a part of your body
[1:53:22] with the Seleka saline solution to where
[1:53:25] if you actually take the wound and rinse
[1:53:27] with what is already your body is used
[1:53:29] to you don't end up destroying cells but
[1:53:32] it actually ends up being promoting
[1:53:34] healing sooner but sometimes there's
[1:53:37] things get stuck in those wounds you
[1:53:40] with me I remember when I cut it was
[1:53:43] this thumb right here when I was I cut
[1:53:44] that when I was in school the first year
[1:53:47] of college I cut that hole it's called
[1:53:48] called a tendon or ligament on what
[1:53:50] that's called but you popping up through
[1:53:52] there when I went to the hospital and
[1:53:53] boys I said when I did it I never had
[1:53:56] stitches in my life but I did it and the
[1:53:58] guy said browning come on you get in the
[1:54:00] van he said I said no there's coastal
[1:54:01] football practice I said I'll just put
[1:54:03] something on it it'll heal up
[1:54:04] he said browning that ain't gonna heal
[1:54:07] that way that's a wound I know I said I
[1:54:11] just brought back it real good I'll bet
[1:54:12] you two get in a van I didn't know I was
[1:54:16] in shock at the time that's what hurt us
[1:54:17] but I get there and you know what before
[1:54:20] when I had they had to say let me see it
[1:54:22] I had to pull this stuff off of it it's
[1:54:26] hard sometimes when you got to look at
[1:54:28] things but you know what they wanted to
[1:54:30] make sure before they sealed it up they
[1:54:32] wanted to make sure that I didn't have
[1:54:35] fragments from what I had been cutting
[1:54:40] sometimes picking them fragment sounds
[1:54:42] like when they had to they were looking
[1:54:43] in there you know pushing it around and
[1:54:45] doing with the tweezer Oh
[1:54:50] but they were able to make sure that the
[1:54:52] wound was clear once they got it clear
[1:54:59] they could sew it up and it could heal
[1:55:04] they didn't ask me what kind of knife
[1:55:06] you use they didn't ask me what kind of
[1:55:08] entertainment center was that or
[1:55:10] whatever it was that I was working on
[1:55:11] the shelf then it asked me they did not
[1:55:14] even talk about that you know where
[1:55:16] their focus was the wound aren't you
[1:55:20] glad that God knows where to focus this
[1:55:25] word friends as we feed on this word it
[1:55:28] has the power and the potential to heal
[1:55:33] in our lives maybe even areas of our
[1:55:37] life we're not even aware but God knows
[1:55:40] and he'll see to it that that pulsation
[1:55:43] it'll take those nutrients and it'll
[1:55:45] bring it right to where it needs to be
[1:55:47] what I need to do just feed just feed
[1:55:50] just feed just fede fede fede fede fede
[1:55:53] as you're feeding you're giving yourself
[1:55:55] to him so how many times the brother
[1:55:59] brand of my brother brand will talk
[1:56:01] about the different parts and he'll say
[1:56:03] he said he said you say aye brother
[1:56:05] branham I want the Holy Ghost
[1:56:06] he said feed on the word you see the
[1:56:11] feeding on the world what's it doing is
[1:56:12] conditioning it may not happen right at
[1:56:14] that moment or right but what's it doing
[1:56:16] it's bringing us into that place it's
[1:56:17] feeding on that word
[1:56:22] what's your loving this morning Lord I
[1:56:26] want to feed I want to feed I want to
[1:56:30] feed I know he'll see to it it gets to
[1:56:32] where it needs to get to I'm confident
[1:56:34] of that he's supplying what we need out
[1:56:37] of the promise in this hour to
[1:56:39] strengthen us one of these days one of
[1:56:43] these moments where the dominant could
[1:56:44] be the final quickening it might be when
[1:56:47] you're getting ready for work they when
[1:56:49] the kids are getting ready for school or
[1:56:51] man you're thinking man I got this I got
[1:56:53] this midterm exam and all of a sudden
[1:56:56] but you won't be shouting because you're
[1:56:58] going to take a midterm
[1:57:00] you'll be Sheldon because I made it I'm
[1:57:04] stand-in here Gord thank you thank you
[1:57:08] Lord for your strength thank you Lord
[1:57:11] for your deliverance Oh glory be to God
[1:57:15] you love him this morning I surrender
[1:57:20] all to You Lord I give myself Lord
[1:57:23] giving myself to you Lord tasting of the
[1:57:27] Lord
[1:57:27] seeing these good feeding on that word
[1:57:29] feeding on that word you find yourself
[1:57:32] battling with things find yourself maybe
[1:57:34] in your mind or what feed on the word
[1:57:35] look back and say what's my what's my
[1:57:38] diet been like this week what's my diet
[1:57:40] been like this month what's it been like
[1:57:42] what's my prayer time just evaluated
[1:57:46] he's not here to put you down but just
[1:57:48] evaluate it because to know that God
[1:57:52] himself
[1:57:52] meets you and his desire is to sell
[1:58:04] father
[1:58:08] or Jesus we surrendered Lord our hearts
[1:58:14] to you this morning Lord I'm it's not
[1:58:17] just Lord of myself as a speaker but
[1:58:19] this congregation father we're looking
[1:58:24] to you because Lord our confidence as
[1:58:28] you have spoke to us then Lord there's
[1:58:31] times we don't know we don't know Lord
[1:58:33] that why maybe our body responds in a
[1:58:35] certain way in the natural we don't know
[1:58:38] what it is what's lacking the Lord I
[1:58:41] think of how that the prophet used the
[1:58:43] simple example of natural cases and even
[1:58:48] applied there in the scripture where
[1:58:50] David would speak about the longing
[1:58:53] within his heart Lord a deep calleth
[1:58:56] unto the deep at the noise of that
[1:58:58] waterspouts probably talked about how
[1:59:01] that by example brought some of those
[1:59:04] little boys I think one of them Lord how
[1:59:05] they would eat the the petals off a
[1:59:07] bicycle that seems to us we think my
[1:59:10] goodness who in the world could do that
[1:59:12] but it wasn't the pedal it was a craving
[1:59:15] that he had within him for a certain
[1:59:18] substance Lord to me it's a paradox at
[1:59:23] his body that that direction would have
[1:59:25] been it would have been known that
[1:59:26] that's what he needed in his body Lord I
[1:59:30] believe that you know just what we need
[1:59:32] I believe that Lord I believe that God
[1:59:34] but even now as we're sitting here in
[1:59:36] the house of God but I believe Lord when
[1:59:37] we are there in our devotions of a
[1:59:39] morning and father in the evening and
[1:59:41] throughout the day Lord God when we're
[1:59:43] listening Lord to the message when we're
[1:59:45] reading in the scripture I believe that
[1:59:46] Lord I believe Lord God but we you know
[1:59:50] just what we have needeth North to see
[1:59:52] how that you'll drop little nuggets
[1:59:54] along our way sometimes Lord when we're
[1:59:56] listening or we're reading or we're
[1:59:58] praying sometimes Lord it seems like
[2:00:00] that it seems like I don't seem like I'm
[2:00:03] understanding everything it seems like
[2:00:04] my mind is going and going and going but
[2:00:06] Lord we realize Lord that is we're
[2:00:08] feeding on that word sometimes the Lord
[2:00:10] God we don't understand we do not know
[2:00:13] Lord where that word and how that it's
[2:00:15] going and moving in our life but I
[2:00:16] believe with all my heart if we're truly
[2:00:18] just feeding on it Lord God I'd be
[2:00:21] Lord God that you will bring it to pass
[2:00:23] Lord and make it known in our lives you
[2:00:25] give to us just what we have need of
[2:00:29] Lord Father how I thank you so much Lord
[2:00:31] God thank you Father Lord for your word
[2:00:34] thank you for your leading Lord thank
[2:00:36] you Lord God for the Holy Ghost Lord
[2:00:39] thank you Lord God Oh Lord Jesus that
[2:00:41] you've lifted up Lord your word out of
[2:00:43] the pages Lord God of the scripture Lord
[2:00:46] it's substance Lord it's it's a
[2:00:49] sustenance to our life Lord we're living
[2:00:51] Lord God not by bread alone but by every
[2:00:54] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[2:00:56] God
[2:00:57] Lord to see how your prophet would place
[2:00:59] that Lord I love it he spent said Lord
[2:01:01] concerning that of the eagle the eagle
[2:01:03] is one who feeds its eaglets by its
[2:01:06] mouth and it's you Lord God you the
[2:01:08] great Papa Eagle Lord feeding us as your
[2:01:11] children Lord your eaglets your feeding
[2:01:14] us Lord by your mouth Lord you are
[2:01:16] placing Lord God that meat Lord God
[2:01:19] right into our mouths Lord God may you
[2:01:21] find mouths that are open Lord hearts
[2:01:24] that are open as it were Lord for Lord
[2:01:26] Jesus we need you Lord God I pray that
[2:01:29] father that you'll just give strength
[2:01:31] equipping each and every one Lord may be
[2:01:33] here today Lord God there's one that
[2:01:35] doesn't know you
[2:01:36] Lord God maybe they don't know you in
[2:01:38] the depth lord of the experience that
[2:01:40] has been ministered in the presence that
[2:01:42] they felt this morning Lord but I pray
[2:01:44] father that they will surrender Lord
[2:01:46] father Lord to that to you Lord to
[2:01:48] you're working Lord - you're moving upon
[2:01:50] their life and say Lord I want that Lord
[2:01:53] like that woman she's seen her God that
[2:01:55] there was a real happiness Lord and so
[2:01:57] when she saw that Lord
[2:01:59] she sat underneath she pulled up to the
[2:02:01] table sat down and begin to eat Lord God
[2:02:05] I pray this morning Lord may each and
[2:02:07] every one of us Lord no matter what the
[2:02:09] need is within the life Lord may we eat
[2:02:12] Lord God of the promised word of
[2:02:15] Almighty God may we feed upon this word
[2:02:17] Lord God granted Lord Jesus I pray
[2:02:20] father we love you Lord we thank you
[2:02:23] Lord God help us Lord God in our daily
[2:02:26] walk Lord Father if there's any that's
[2:02:28] tripped
[2:02:29] Lord any Lord God that would be out of
[2:02:31] fellowship Lord I pray this morning Lord
[2:02:33] just by the simplicity Lord of their
[2:02:36] heart Lord being turned and open to you
[2:02:38] and say Lord restore me Lord God Lord
[2:02:40] restore me Lord that fellowship Lord God
[2:02:43] restore Lord God forgive me Lord for
[2:02:45] allowing the things of this life in this
[2:02:48] world more to get in the way Lord God
[2:02:50] but I want to be a feeder on this word
[2:02:53] granite Lord Jesus
[2:02:54] may it be when each one looks and each
[2:02:58] of us looks at our life
[2:02:59] may it be Lord God that what we find
[2:03:02] what is the principal source of our feed
[2:03:08] may it be you Lord God to a lot of other
[2:03:12] good things Lord the things that could
[2:03:13] be around us but Lord there's one
[2:03:16] principal source that we have need of
[2:03:19] and that's your God help us Lord help
[2:03:23] those the Lord that maybe when they're
[2:03:25] looking in Lord at faith is Lord in the
[2:03:27] word and they say they feel like well I
[2:03:28] don't understand this but may they put
[2:03:30] their confidence not in their
[2:03:32] intellectual ability but may they put
[2:03:34] their confidence in you Lord that you
[2:03:37] Lord God will reveal to them Lord God
[2:03:40] this word granite Lord Jesus I pray we
