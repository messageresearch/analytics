you Lord for bringing brother Dale Smith through that heart operation Lord today oh God just receiving notice moments ago Lord that he's been moved to the I see you Lord and even how that they found

congregation there Lord in Arizona Lord we ask o God that Lord you would just have your way now father you know our needs Lord we just give ourselves to you Lord along with every other request in Jesus name amen God bless you this evening if you'll turn with me to Job chapter 19 there I'd like to say it's good to be back home um just so enjoyed the service I was able to listen to the service and just so enjoyed that and uh we just um just looking to the Lord amen and what God has in store for us here and uh I want to look I want to break in here in Job chapter 19 I want to just move into verse 8 and start right there um in this thought here in the going about this tonight and here's job he's he's ex he's expressing that when he speaks of he he's speaking of God in verse 8 he hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths you know there is truth to what job is saying because a trial itself is an ordained meeting place with God and the Bible says that there's no temptation that has taken us but such as what's common to man and there's no exit doors in those trials we look for them our flesh looks for him it's just true we look for them if there's one time we would like to have a trap door I'd like to be that time so there's a truth I want you to see this here as we look at it tonight you can see there are things that job he understands about God's nature but where Joe blacks is the understanding of what's taking place with me true and that's the that's a part of it that remember this is where he says he hath fenced up my way in other words there's no escaping out of this right here that I cannot pass and he hath set Darkness or removed understanding in my paths but it just goes to show in the midst of it all that we're not walking by understanding we do walk by understanding but we don't walk by understanding we walk by faith because faith is real understanding it's understanding to know that God is present I belong to him and he's guiding me that's the understanding we have need of right that's the understanding that where a change has come into our life that's real understanding not not this up here that I have all of this figured out but I've got an understanding that God is with me now in verse 9 he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head he hath destroyed me on every side and I am gone and my hope hath he removed like a tree he all he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counted me unto him as one of his enemies his troops come together and raise up their way against me and in Camp round about my Tabernacle he hath put my brethren far from me and mine and mine acquaintance are very estranged from me amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated there this evening just want to by the help of the Lord just continue to look at that thought of a right application in the midst of that of a trial in the midst of situations and we know that there is a real we need the help of the Lord in applying the word correctly and looking at things correctly and the thing that we find within it all that which is so prevalent to misinterpret what's taking place is the enemy and there's a part of us that's that's kin to that of the enemy a part of us that's receptive to listen to that that's that that part even though we've been delivered of that first birth but that flesh and that Spirit can be moved and Satan can come and Whisper to that brother Brown talked about how that when Satan came there when his wife had passed and when his little girl and he's standing right there and brother Brahm said he came right up and stood right beside there and if you can you catch what brother Brown was saying is it's more than Satan standing right there by the side of that bed where little Sharon Rose was was at Satan had been standing there right next to his reasoning and was beginning to declare many different things to him he was rehearsing a lot of things to him and remember the very thing that brother Brown told us in that time this the testimony that he said Satan could not he could not tell me there was no God I already knew him but what he came in that moment was to try to convince him he doesn't love you he doesn't care about you and he's the same devil he doesn't have any new tactics he works the same way and the one thing about it is is God doesn't have to have any new tactics either God's given his word in the beginning and his word when we as Believers will take that word and stand on it it'll defeat the Devil any time any place and anywhere and that's the truth we're standing as Witnesses these aren't these aren't just things that we're quoting we're Witnesses of this we're expressing expressing of these of these things by an experience and this is where when we look at this thinking as brother Brandon would bring it and and you know speak to us that as long as Satan could make job believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whip in other words job did not understand that what is taking place God is Desiring to make something more out of you God is Desiring to bring forth something more out of you now once you think about this we could maybe accept this if we looked at it and said well job's a young man he's a middle-aged man the prophet tells us clearly job was he was an older man he was just a little a few few if we could say a few years from the grave but yet in the midst of it all it just goes to show you and I that we never come to a place on our own to where it's just I've reached a climax I've reached the summit I've read God has always there's always more that God has in store I can't say I fully understand all that I I there's no way because if you try to explain how is it that an individual can walk with God and maybe be 85 years old and they're taken home to be with the Lord and while they're here their character is being molded the whole time and then you take another life then here is changed and transformed and it's not here for that duration of time and yet it's on home to be with the Lord explain that you can't I can't explain that you can't explain the infinite wisdom of almighty God this is where we trust him this is trust comes from that reality that that love affair and it's not just that I'm in love or you're in love with an idea of God because that's the human spirit and that'll fail because when he begins to permit things that don't match our concept or that that depth of love that just resides in our spirit then it shakes a person to a place of departure but when the love of God has come into the soul then there's nothing can separate us of divine love because Divine love is is there and it stands that even when I don't understand what's taking place like job said I'm going to worship I'm going to worship and we're brought to those different places in our life sometimes they come in very precarious ways ways that were tried that we didn't even expect and it just can almost take the breath out of us and it isn't always something that we put in saying think something to be so devastating or maybe a sickness perhaps tonight if I'm if God permits me to refer to one I refer to one that even where the Prophet designates as an ash Heath that perhaps you or I would not have even thought of being an ass sheep but it lets us know all of these ways that you and I that God allows things to move and come about that it might draw us closer to him that we might be more of a yielded vessel to him because this whole life our whole life here it's not about ourselves the Bible says we are not our own we are bought with the price it's not about us and yet the greatest battle and the and where where the battle lays it's with us it's with us now he'll try to do the same thing as he did with job as long as he can make job believe it that way he had job whipped now not only were his friends and all those around him they were aligning themselves against him but it was Satan it was Satan moving that but job even in himself if you would even have expoke to job even in the midst of this time job would not have been a refreshing person to be around are you hearing me now he would not have been a refreshing person he would have been one that would have if we can say it in this way that could have almost taken your breath away by the things because as we find chapter after chapter after chapter job at different times would say my complaint I'm in the bitterness of soul and what I'm going through and all of that he had a right to all that he felt all of that bitterness are you hearing me he felt all of that Jesus said let this bitter cup pass for me no trial is Pleasant no test is Pleasant it's bitter right it's better it's not pleasant but it's where in the midst of it that we can receive a refreshing from the Lord in the midst of it is where we need the grace of God to help us Lord that my thoughts would be yielded to you Lord and looking to you I don't know sometimes that I have times when I've you know you try to encourage someone or this or that and sometimes it seems like in times that even you can express something and it's almost like it's like a black hole it goes in and there's there's nothing that even just comes out on the positive end so many can be going through something and you just give it to them yeah I know that but you know this is a real depressing situation and I'm not doubting that person or Downing that individual we all come into those moments where you feel down you feel a little discouraged you feel like what's going on I've just come through some of the what's going on here looking at certain things and what brings us through and our thoughts were the Battleground is the battle in our mind you can't discount our your thinking at all or make it as though it's not anything at all it is something and God wants us to have our thoughts so to lined up with him God let my thinking be under your influence Lord we need that Lord if my thoughts not right here tonight Lord may your presence come down lord and supernaturally Lead me as my shepherd Lord I need that our thinking matters because you if you are defeated or I am defeated in my thinking it'll affect your perception and it'll affect your confession your outlook on everything will be negative and your confession will be negative and we can all maybe some more than others but this we can be prone to these things but this is where to understand that is Satan's objective is to get us defeated in our thinking that's what he wanted to do to job because if he could get job's thinking off no matter how much Revelation was packed inside of his soul no matter how sealed and a son of God with authority that he was but if his thinking Satan caused him to believe it was God doing it to him he's got him whipped think about it power that resided within this life think about in your own life my life power that resides there Divine Authority but if Satan can affect our thinking he's got us Satan can affect the thinking in the service affect your thinking or my thinking even a service or even walking up here in any way if he can do that he can affect you he can affect me how much more in a trial this is why just think of this scripture I you know I've read from this scripture here many times it just struck me here today as I'm just just pouring over you know just been pouring over the Book of Job even as I've been out and on trips that just I just keep going over and just keep listening keep meditating keep going through these these things and there's just been some wonderful things of God by his grace will allow us to speak and move into But First Peter chapter 4 verse 12 don't you love the Lord look at this very first verse we know the scripture by Heart Right beloved think it not strange concerning concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but what's important is beloved the very first word beloved who is that is that of the Beloved the esteemed the dear the favorite the worthy of love who is the Beloved you are the Beloved I am of the Beloved we have been accepted into beloved he who was lovable made us who was unlovable lovable we have been accepted in the Beloved and now by his life operating through that seed of himself in our life he says beloved this is why brother Brandon would say it like this thinking of and I want you to think about hear our thoughts and regarding tests and trials but the brand will say I like this the more loyal you are the more testings come this is out of the Messi's Victory down let me just pull a few statements on here more loyal more testing now I want to qualify testing and trials here in just a little bit more loyal more testing God think of these statements I want you to understand this when I'm reading this here in the message of the hour let me tell you where I believe we're standing we're standing in the same place where God spoke to job out of the Whirlwind because Allahu has stood up and he has taken the book The Lamb has prevailed and God is speaking here in job 42 what all of this has all been about it's been God trying and proving his church down Through the Ages and God working in your lives God think of this word this is at now an understanding that comes to you and I and I'm just going to say it like this not that they did not have understanding down through the seven Church ages there are many men that had understanding those Messengers had understanding regarding testings and trials because let me say this every Overcomer when it said he that half an ear and an every age to every Overcomer there was a test yeah and that test was the word they were tested upon that word that they had received and believed and you know what it was that did the Sorting that sorted everything is the word it's the word that brings the sorting out the sorting out because many can come around it but it's the word that does the sorting out because remember the word is a seed and it was thrown on four types of ground right but it's only the good ground which is the pre prepared ground that's ordained to receive that seed and it's not you or me or anyone that has done that it's God has placed and reserved that womb that expression that Candlestick God has reserved that place for himself that we might receive him in this hour so all glory goes to him because if not for God's grace this message would go right over our head we would view this message as no other thing than just another move of God we would view this message as oh it's just another view of Calvary that's how we would view it but when we can really recognize that this message it is Jesus Christ being revealed to me personally it's deeper than a religious affiliation hallelujah it's through this message that God is fulfilling in time prophecies where a people are united and take upon his name glory be to God no longer saying this shall be this shall be but we are able to say this now is and I say that with this understanding that God would issue out regarding test and trials what an understanding job didn't have this job didn't have this let me say this other ages didn't have this but God has reserved it because it's needed for right now that's why the lamb took the book it's needed for right now it's to invoke full Authority in the Church of the Living God think of this statement to me these statements here these statements this message is not from the mind of William Branham this meant these thoughts are from the very heart of Elohim [Applause] amen it's God standing before our tent door think of this think of this think of this being breathed into our life God has counted you Worthy when you have a test I want to know if I've had God's head I love you I've given you a test wow totally contrary to our thinking huh right I think he is if God really loves us then it ought to be smooth you know it's got to be putting without any bits of the mixture and I mean it's got to be Blended smooth all right one more statement in here it shows the grace of God has found you and you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test he did the same thing by Joe brother Brown said this is what God said about job he's my pride and my joy who is he he beloved you see if you got around God God was going to talk about his children you think you got pictures of your grandchildren or pictures of your children nobody has God beat nobody has got to be God loves to show off his children he loves to show and display and that's what he was doing with Joe job let's beloved he's my pride and joy God had confidence in job the prophet said and when it looks like this is so important when it looks like everything has gone wrong how many know what I'm talking about I mean it looks like everything has gone wrong God has given you a trial he's got come after baby you around now you can understand God could have come right away in chapter three when job started after job worshiped in chapter one he turned and worshiped in chapter two and then the beginning of chapter three you think where'd this guy go he ain't singing specials no more where did he go now he wasn't he wasn't accused he wasn't coming out and cursing God right but he got after in the worship then you have a little bit of time in chapter three he says oh I would to God that the day had never come that I had been born let me tell you what all that's about job and God said that's why this trial is here because I got to get some selfishness out of you isn't it amazing isn't it amazing you or I we can look at it and think my what selfishness mine the most unselfish person in the world I don't know and then God allows something to come and what does it do it does not highlight the real quality of a Believer or expose that at first what it exposes is this flesh now job remember God said remember Satan said you let me touch his kids and I'll cause him to curse you let me take everything from him I'll cause him the curse you couldn't do it then he came around and said let me touch his flesh a man will give everything for his health he'll do everything in the world God said go ahead and do it but you can't take his life but notice here that shows there's still an element of self-preservation about us and you know what that will be there until the change of our bodies it is nothing that you'll ever come to a place or I will come to a place and will hang it up and saying man I'll never be bothered with that no but it's glory unto Glory God is dissolving it little by little by little and he knows just how to do it oh oh brother the same now you know there's got to be some real hard preaching no remember heart preaching only brings conviction right yeah but around lots of snow any adoption seriously said preaching itself is what brings conviction leading people to the altar to get right with God he said but it takes the teaching of the word to positionally place us now I believe the holy spirit is in both Realms don't you and I believe it's absolutely necessary we need the teaching of the word we need the preaching the word I believe God can bring it right together but notice this he doesn't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real Christian God is giving you a test to see what you'll do about it then he quotes that of Peter and he says many times we him and Hall I don't we probably don't do that that's something God give you notice this that something God give you to overcome put his trust in you brother the rhyme goes on to say we fret about this but I want you to remember these trials come upon us and are only done because God loves us he give it to us because he's got confidence in us he believes that we have faith and love for him that will be able to overcome he'll see to it I love that he believes will overcome he'll seat to it you know what that means that when a test or trial comes along the way God does not abandon me he's right there with me though the paths seem dark and I cannot understand what's going on but that's the time when faith will really declare itself faith is not when I know everything that's going on when I got everything that's figured out do you realize that God the greatest thing that God is working with in our life is to get self-dissolved the biggest problem we've got is self oh no brother Sammy you got that wrong the biggest problem I've got is with so and so no it's with you it's not so and so you see what it is God allows that to come up to let you and I see there's still that part about you and I that has to die and be submitted to him and God will see to it that we overcome that you might be sitting here and it might be 30 some years later and say I still ain't got to be on this but God is very long-suffering he's patient he'll send test after a test trial after trial because God never gives up on himself glory be to God and sometimes what we cannot see then God comes along and he's giving us Grace well I love that statement he'll see us through and may we not fret and stew about it it's a powerful statement I don't know if I'll get to this tonight but may we just walk up there and speak the word and walk forward and they go on from there this is why the Bible would say for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith there have been times you feel like you got stuck sure you ever been in the midst of a test or trial and you feel like you got stuck there's a testing going on and you're battling there's thoughts and everything coming into your mind and everything else I know I'm speaking to humanity tonight Sons and Daughters of God that are veiled in humanity and in the midst of your battling and bringing that thought subject and bringing this thumbnail I'm bringing that how are you able to bring it subject because you're acquainted with the nature of Christ that's in you and you realize if I entertain that in that way it will move and it will absolutely defeat me My Confession will become negative my perception on things will become negative over the Samuel that's positive thinking well if you call that positive thinking you've got a lot of scriptures to take out of your Bible I call it the mind of Christ I don't find anywhere in the scripture you can find me if you want to text me tomorrow email to me tomorrow go ahead and do it find me one place where God ever instructed any of his children to walk around negative he said let the weak say I'm strong let the redeemed of the Lord say so right on and on we could go with scriptures so it's powerful that in our Faking It Matters our perception and then our confession because if Satan has us defeated in our thinking then might as well not even walk up there and speak the word because well I don't know I don't know if we should have came out of Egypt I tell you there's such big chariots and all that back no he didn't say go up there and reason with it speak the word for this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and sometimes we get stuck but thanks be to God faith is that motor that power in our life that like a boat when a boat gets stuck in in some weeds or over there you know it's it's fishing there's a power in that boat it's more than paddle power there's an engine behind it that's able to get it unstuck I'm glad that this engine is not able just to take us out into the deep but I'm glad it's able to get us unstuck when we get stuck because sometimes we get stuck in our own thinking and you know what that's overcoming don't make overcoming well I haven't walked on the water today find me the person who has because he walked on the water to let you and I know that there is Authority where we can walk above our first birth we can walk above and with authority and in Dominion in our life right but for the same I feel like I'm drowning reach up like Peter and say help me Lord lest I perish remember it's not the trial of my mind my spirit or my body it's the trial of my faith and they overcame him the Bible said by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony oh my is carrying off the victory that's what overcoming means it means to maintain the cause carry off the victory I believe that with all my heart that's what a Christian life is to be it's a Victorious Life it doesn't mean that we don't we don't experience letdown sometimes we do it doesn't mean that we win every single battle no we don't but the war's already been won you see the greatest the rule and the battle that matters the most that's already been won is that battle already down in the soul and reality that battle was already won it's just us receiving the Liberty that he already has purchased for us and then when that battle is said it'll settled on the inside then we've got God's soldier on the inside and then we have strength to move and navigate through all these other channels where the enemy would like to come right back in but those are all opportunities to overcome now think of this through all of these things God will allow strange things he says it just to happen that we do not understand and we can't understand it but by faith because we do not walk by understanding we walk by faith is that right and so everything that God does in the midst of a time after after that our lives have been given become his property our confession our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every child that comes is to perfect us for his glory to bring us to a place to where God can make himself more real to us brother Branham ends that part with this statement and remember he says in all these things Satan tries to make us nervous oh so in a time of not understanding Satan comes to make us nervous you ought to back that Old Devil up tonight because that nervousness doesn't speak anything about you as a son or daughter of God are you hearing me no all that means is you're still trapped in this flesh something has come up and there can be a thought or a thought and we can entertain that thought and we take that and we become nervous oh brother Samuel if people only had the faith to keep it away just sit tight you'll have to deal with it sometime and when you deal with it then it's an opportunity to overcome because it can come but thanks be to God there is a tower down on the inside that's able to hear from God and when there's another thought that is transmitted and we can benefit from that what does it do perfect love cast out all fear Oh Glory Satan tries to make us nervous and upset us probably not any of us but to get us to to get us to think why did this happen why couldn't I have been like this now what brother Brown's talking about right here is an ash Heap in this message it's a short message I know if you get a chance to listen to it 59 minutes I've probably listened to it I don't know how many times a year in the past few months wonderful what a blessing but brother Ram talks about an ash Heap now I'll be honest with you when I first listened to it you know I'm rejoicing but it blew me away I thought I would have never have regarded this as an ash Heap you know what it was he was invited to tour Oral Roberts facility he walks into that facility and he tells us he had just finished coming out of Tommy Osmond's remember both of them got their start out from underneath brother Branham are you with me what they saw was the god of reality remember what Tommy Osborne if you you read what Tommy Osborne I've got it at home in a in a testament or more of the Tommy Osborne speaks of it in this manner he said we had forgot what Jesus Christ was like and God came in this generation and now we know exactly what he was like one making brother random Jesus Christ but it was Christ reproduced in the ministry of Malachi 4. that is Luke 17 and 30. but I'm glad it didn't stop there it's that same Ministry reproduced in The Bride of Jesus Christ for the works that I do shall you do also and greater than these right but notice this ashy we wouldn't have thought of that I wouldn't have but brother Brown tells us he went out of there and when he left out of that building what brother Brown himself he said I looked around and he said I thought when I came out of there and I seen them great pillars and all that was in the building all those things that was going on what a beautiful structure brother Brown says I looked at all that right there and he says what I thought was God surely I have become a hypocrite surely I have become an outcast somewhere for these men's Ministries come off of mine I ask you was this the right application no let me just read on and I thought what maybe I am so untrusted Lord that you couldn't trust me with anything like that even the little few dollars that you let me pay for the campaigns and things now they're trying to send me to the penitentiary for it remember he's in the tax case and why am I such a hypocrite or why am I such an untrusted person brother said I was on the ash Heap as job was oh so sometimes the ash heaps look entirely different but you know what it is it's all personal God knows what's needed to dissolve these things in US now think about this because we look at a test or trial well I don't have no I don't have no choice a test or trial just comes brother Bram had a choice whether he wanted to visit this place or not come on coming home he had a choice whether he wanted to visit that place or not God wasn't telling that you're going to go to oral Robert's place and you're going to go see Tommy no this was just like passing through and seeing something and here he is passing through and seeing it and right in the midst of it his thoughts on the ash sheep his thoughts I must be a hypocrite I must be an untrusted person but then God speaks to him he says I want you to look up I am your portion did you see his thoughts his thoughts were affecting his confession it was affecting his perception but he was able to receive from God oh friends God's not going to stop the tests and trials and the hardships and things that come around our life but what is important is is that we can remain available to receive from God oh brother Samuel I'm just going to wait and close it all down I I just need to talk to you in person I need to talk why close this out God is mindful of our needs many times we forsake our mercies because we're looking for some answer to come in some way and God is ministering service after service and time and time again but we're sitting there and because it's not agreeing with us we wait for a different answer well let me tell you something God don't change his mind God don't change his mind and I am a firm believer I am a famous of it that if you pray I'm praying I believe that God directs and I know God directs God will change thoughts God will change things right here at the local church just as at times when I've been out why it's for the needs of his people because Ministry is not about me speaking the things that God maybe has revealed or made known to my heart it's about what are the needs of the people there's been many times where things have dropped in such a way and I'm studying and going through and Gathering as fast as I can gather it and God don't even have me to preach that for that time I don't know when it will be and oh I'm rejoicing of that and I realize I want to look at it Lord do I bring that to to this group do I bring that in I can't feel that Liberty you see that's why Ministry it's not about preaching what I'm seeing it's God ministering to our needs and God will lead God will lead right through the local Pastor God will direct all that and you watch watch how God will direct everything right through the local pastor and watch how God God is working throughout the body of Jesus Christ around the world and there are things that God will continue and everything will be lining up and bringing that same angle that same direction why because we are under one Pillar of Fire right might be a few different quotes might be but notice there are certain things and you know how it is you look around you turn around like oh my goodness what is that that's God letting you know hey I'm leading this bride this bride is not a man-made organism this Bride is a living a living vassal of almighty God as a matter of fact the prophet called it an oracle of God in this hour think of it I am your portion and then brother Branham began to worship and begin to thank God well I've Got Confidence I know I know how God's changed my thoughts many times how about you I know when God you know what that's the expectation I have I have need of that when my thoughts and maybe my thoughts on battling and bringing this sense of objection bringing this but I look at and say God I have a need from you Lord I have a need from you I need to hear from you Lord so jobs thinking regarding the whole thing his thinking was wrong it was actually God that was permitting him but notice job's thinking though his thinking was wrong and I want you to catch this his thinking was wrong but it's very incredible how he had such understanding that God was the one in control I could show you scripture after scripture and hear job 19 that's what he's saying he hath he knew this couldn't happen unless God permitted it I could not be turned over into the hands of the wicked unless God permitted it he knew that but he had the wrong application a man that can know what is truth knowing what is right he had met God he knew God's requirement but yet he did not have under he did not have understanding as what was going on that God was making something out of his life yet his thinking his thinking was being affected by the enemy because are you with me you're thinking and my thinking is not sealed your spirit and my spirit is not sealed the soul is what gets sealed brother Branham Will Tell Us in greatest by ever thought he said Satan he said once he's been put out the soldier has stepped in he said if he can get down one of those senses reason imagination conscience memory he said if he can get down in there he's got you routed now he cannot change and undo the new birth he can't because there's nothing to go back to but what he would like to do is get him routed and get our perceptions and such a certain way oh brother Samuel that can't happen really brother man just takes one example and they're an imagination he said you get somebody he said that maybe in the church he said you get the thinking that they've walked by you and not shook your hand he said and you watch you start acting funny towards that individual he said what is it you've just imagined it however you know you might talk to somebody I could call Brother Joshua but the Joshua he said no Sarah I'm willing to stand on it they ignored me so what are you going to do about it what are you gonna do about it you're gonna pout about it you're gonna get on Facebook about it tell everybody else about it you're going to let it ruin your testimony oh but it ain't mine it's showing Souls really what's what's I think you think rounded Satan has got the arousing that he wanted oh but sometimes those Ash heaps don't look like ash heaps but the ash heaps are places to die you ever heard there's a place you know when I taught school we had a phrase I don't know it's not just for school but you pick your battles pick your battles you can make everything in the world a battle but let me tell you something there's a place to live and die there's a hill to live and die on and not every Hill was meant to live and die on are you hearing me now Lord I don't feel like I've gone even anywhere tonight let me just let me just try to close up here on this part but I said here it was when he's talking about Israel coming out to Jordan I want you to listen this very carefully he said here it was that the Red Sea is before him he said now you think about it it's only a few years later when the Trials come and the church got All Shook Up as it's so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it's supposed to be now you catch that it's easy for a congregation to be so shaken up when things don't happen the way that it's supposed to be or don't seem we got quiet you ready for this next statement God makes it that way you mean God in one calling around and saying Hey do you understand this Hey Brother change sisterly can I come over I want to make sure you understand everything hey Mr Brenda hey Paul remember no God does it that way you know why because it shows believers it shows God allows things to happen God allows that God allows it matter of fact here's what he said I just read it God makes it that way so it's not like God fumbling around like oh my goodness I didn't mean for that to happen no God makes it happen that way remember he's a god of purpose listen to this next statement God brings tensions into the church God brings tensions into the church now Lord you know my heart I'm not asking for this I'm just preaching as you're servant what's you you're laying on my heart I'm not asking for it because I don't like tensions I don't like them I mean I don't got too much more hair to go notice he let sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it he really brings the perspective because what happens in these times for every one of us including this old boy right here self Rises up self so and so shouldn't have said that this shouldn't have happened oh if they really have the love of God let me guess that they would act like you just did or you mean they would throw a fit like you did oh no I get it I see when the enemy came with that thought they would have threw a fit at the Devil said that's what you're acting out right you see what it does it shows self as much as we can walk around and say I'm nothing we still believe we're something you just want to know how it shows when a test or trial comes certain words come our way there's quote after quote and I don't know and you know I just know there's certain things that I've read and I maybe have read this no doubt I've read this quote before I've read many of these quotes but you know how it is the spirit of God can just cause things to stand out to you before like it never stood out and as I read through the Book of Job how many chapters and that we've been through so far here in chapter 19 and I still didn't even get to where we were going but how many times even with this opening text that he writes about his friends being removed from him his close acquaintances even those that should have he should have received impression and encouragement from instead they accused him and remember in the one chapter they said by the way all of everything that happened to you it didn't even measure what you deserved you know I read that to you wow what encouraging words from a buddy right dear friend but you know it shows there's so much of self but this is what I'm thankful for I'm grateful that God not only included these examples but I'm glad he's working on me I'm glad he's working on me because you know what God allows Samuel to come in situations that brings to light one thing too much of you boy too much of you and you know what the fun thing of it is you can be aware of it write what's going on man you know in the midst of it you're saying Lord help me help me Lord help me what are you doing bringing your thoughts those thoughts in subjection remember with your thoughts you can be defeated brother Branham stood outside of those great things of Oral Roberts and in his thinking he was defeated but he was available for God to speak to him to me it's what a paradox what a mystery in our lives but you know what it causes me to do it causes me that when I come here to the house of God when I look in the word of God I'm expecting for God to speak to me I know that he knows what I got need of yeah and I'm expecting him to speak to me that's what my thoughts are regardless of what my feelings are my thoughts of the of the day I'm expecting God to speak to us to us oh I love him don't you Lord let my thinking be influenced Lord by you let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Here We Stand Lord and what job Lord himself is going through is dealing with each and every one of us Lord had to are or will and Lord how I'm so thankful that we can be reminded and refreshed in these things Lord words of encouragement we'll never get to a place to where Lord it comes just like as though we pull into a certain gear and oh oh I know this now and this trial this is wow this trial is nothing no no no because the trial itself it comes to make something out of us your Prophet tells us that over and over and over it comes that we might be further strengthened than you than Lord I'm a know of it and I know the people sitting here know it as well in order for there to be more of your strength and there's got to be less of Samuel there's got to be less of me Lord they can put their name right in it and Lord Jesus you know that we need that Divine assistance Lord we need it Lord the part about us would pick the easy road that not the soul not the soul but that flesh part of us oh my God would pick the easy way we don't want Lord to have uncomfortable situations we don't want to have Lord misunderstandings we do not want to have things said about us nobody does part but God I pray that you would help us take these Lord thoughts Lord that you've placed on My Heart Lord and would speak to us in such a way to encourage us and help us to see that Lord that the trial itself help us Lord even as we take from this service and we pray over it Lord to realize Lord sometimes the things that can happen and are going around Lord It's All About Us dying to self help me Lord help me Lord is my prayer Lord God there's been a lot of things the Lord that you've showed me and I know by that there's a lot more other things Lord I need your grace Lord this congregation we need your grace Lord Jesus Lord God for in times we do not know sometimes Lord when an ash we might be on an ash Heap and it will come unawares to us because that's how the ash Heap does but it's on that ashy Lord where you choose to make yourself so real to us Lord more real to us Lord God help us Lord I pray help every one of us Lord help us the Lord I pray God may be here tonight Lord in one's thinking Lord and thoughts that the Lord has just went on and on Lord in their mind maybe looking at scenarios and situations and looking at things Lord maybe it seems like Lord that the Lord people are against him I thank Lord hear Lord God some Lord past meetings ago I had a little sister that came up Lord at the end of the service in meetings elsewhere and she came up Lord after and prayed for many different people and here she stood and what a Godly looking little sister and she stood right there and she said brother Samuel she said I need a touch in my body and she said I've been in this church for years and years and years but Satan wants to make me think nobody loves me Lord God you know Lord as I entered there in prayer it was the Lord Satan Lord there had worked through many many many situations though she set with the congregation but by entertaining those thoughts Lord God even though she did not go out in the world there I believe God a real experience in her life but it is so isolated her from the joy of the body but Lord You Came you came Lord and Lord God how we're so thankful Lord that in these moments Lord that you come to us we're not ignorant of Satan's devices because of your grace Lord help us Lord sometimes we don't always recognize it right away brother Branham did not recognize walking out of Oral Roberts would be an ash Heap he did not recognize it for that no doubt he may be gone up that morning there was plans coming out of that meeting to go visit that place who would have thought Lord I know when I've listened to that message and then Lord it was some time ago Lord I remember stopping at that day and thinking what and I went back and Lord I just begin my heart just began to open and say thank you Lord you show us that Lord the ash Heap is not our conception of things but the ash Heap is a place of death where we are LED as a lamb to the slaughter help us Lord because the Real Enemy that we have is our own selves it's us that gets in the way Lord but Lord I know you're here to help us and remind us and encourage us tonight and Lord thank you for dropping thoughts down Lord God your thoughts tonight and Lord in every service Lord should you tarry in Sunday's service Thursday service go Lord we need you Lord we need you Lord there's many lives the Lord is coming here Lord some not only attest your trials but some Lord God trapped in sin may need a thought to drop the Lord oh papa may you just moved down lord for your children we need you Lord we need you father we love you and we thank you Lord in Jesus name amen Hallelujah if you'd like to stand you've got a song on your heart go ahead amen oh praise the Lord oh my don't you love him aren't you thankful he just comes in at all control reminds us and speaks to us of these things it encourages us it encourages me you know what I told you and I know I thought there as I sat there and I'm looking been looking over things I thought Lord I know the people are praying as a matter of fact when I got there in different times the brothers were sitting around there in Mexico he said brother Samuel speak about these things that God's been dealing Ministry on job in those services kind of feel a little odd you're sitting around in a circle and they're wanting you to express and go through these things but you know what it is it's encouragement to our lives encouragement God knows for just what we need I think when I was there the time before last didn't know what I was going to speak and God began to lay certain things on my life on my heart little did I know some of the things that I'd be speaking about in that time well the church at that time was going through many different things but then less than a week later or just a week later we would have this situation that we had where Ryan Walker went on home to be with the Lord trial test right that God knows I'm just so thankful that we can draw strength from him oh he is El Shady eye we can draw strength from him I may not know what is going on I may not have the understanding but in the midst of it I can take this that God has given to us but I do understand this I found favor with God when a trial has come you found favor with God as a matter of fact brother Brandon would word it like this and how can I overcome he said the test is the greatest thing to ever happen to you wow I don't know about you but I say wow right can I give you one more brother Graham said we ask God for peace and comfort and he gives us the best that he could give us tests trials and tribulation wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I asked him for peace and comfort but he gave me the best test trials and tribulation now this same message yeah he said because our peace comes on the other side but you see what that's all about right here don't you like it when things are going good hey I do I'll just be honest I love when things are going good I love when things are running real smooth don't you sisters love it when you're preparing that meal everything's going just right man everything it's real good isn't it well it's hard when everything's not lining up right the biscuits are getting burnt and the dogs wanting outside oh what's going on right you see it's not how we think that's not how we think brother Shane [Music] but God brother bear says puts bits in the mouth of that test or trial and he directs it for his glory because this whole part of our journey right here it's a Proving Grounds it's the molding grounds that's what this whole journey is about but yes do we like peace do we like Comfort I do I do right the Bible said follow peace with all Man Without such no one shall see God right live peaceably with each man as much as pot and that lies within you I believe in that I love peace I love peace I don't I don't love to argue I don't love the fuss I don't like to debate I I'm I don't like that I'm not the kind of guy well let me prove you on that's just not me that ain't Lord that's just not me I don't I love peace I believe God's children we love peace right I love peace God help us help us sing so I don't see no more he's got it all in control glory be to God he's got it all foreign [Applause] way down in my soul he's got it all in control so I put my life [Music] Lord God with an understanding of your mercy that's delivered to us Lord so

father knows what I need let's sing that verse one more time my father knows Lord you know what I need Lord my father knows Lord Jesus not what we want Lord but what we need so every child I go through you know what's best for me [Music] let that Faith part on the inside speak out he's got it all in control speak the word and go forward [Music] down in my soul he's got it I don't want to keep it back but I want to put my life in his hands I put my life in Lord God in my hands it's only enough for a little lad but in your hands it'll feed a multitude Lord so every rose [Music] and my father knows what I need [Music] my father knows what I need for every trial I go through he knows what's best for me yes he does yes he does [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]

[Music] you never let my feet [Music] standing on his promises one by one well I may have to walk through this [Music] evening [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] what a powerful reality living in his word I will overcome how many witnesses living in his word I will overcome standing on his promises one by one remember God is given to us that we might have something to overcome and the real overcoming it's me it's me it's the attribute Son of God or the attribute daughter of God overcoming and bringing this guy in subjection to the word of God you're talking about victory well brother Samuel I can't wait I'll tell you to the Millennium to where we you know can give rain and this no before we get there right here but God has given sufficient Grace to control this hunk of dirt you believe that because our lives right here are really a pre-figure of that New Jerusalem because in the New Jerusalem the lamb is the light who's the light of your life he's the light of my life he's the light of your life and God has equipped us he may not may not always feel like it but he's equipped us so we stand in what he has done amen God bless you tonight you're dismissed in the name of the Lord and maybe as we sing that again he promised to hold my hands [Music] you know standing on his promises [Music] his family [Music] straight [Music] says [Music] [Music]
